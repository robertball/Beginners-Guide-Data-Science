I was leary of making this without first pre-cooking the meatballs, but this is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made.  The meatballs ended up a nice brown color, they were not over cooked and I think putting them in before browning allowed some of the meat flavor to seep into the sauce.  I great recipe.

Five star rating is based on the following changes.  Instead of using all ground beef, I opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef (12 oz ground beef, 4 oz ground pork) -instead of plain bread crumbs, I used pre-seasoned breadcrumbs, I increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz. 

With the sauce, instead of using 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes, I used 1 (28 oz can) of whole tomatoes, and then two smaller cans (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes.  After simmering the sauce, I ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste, plus for added flavour I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, and 1 tsp garlic powder.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!

This was absolutly the most wonderful spaghetti. This was my first time making homemade spaghetti. I work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal, so what I did was use my slow cooker. In the morning i sauteed my onion and garlic, combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker. Had my husband turn the cooker on low at his lunch, so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours. one hour before the sauce was done, he put the meat balls in. We did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid, but the flavor was amazing. By using the slow cooker for us working cooks, it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this.

This sauce was very easy to make and quite delicious.  I do agree with some reviews that the meatballs were a bit bland, but to each his own, my husband liked them.  I will never use bottled sauce again, that's for sure.  Note:  to others who who mentionned they substituted turkey or other poultry for ground beef  ...  you are never supposed to use breadcrumbs, that type of meat is quite dry, breadcrumbs only makes it worse!

For Celeste, who found the meatballs too dry, may I suggest adding 1/2 cup of water, or milk, or tomato sauce to the meatballs?  The eggs will bind them, but not make them moister - adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy.  Also, if you want a lighter meatball, substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - measure it first, then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs.  I added 1.5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil; added 1 tsp seasoned salt, 1 medium green pepper.  I was very, very happy with the sauce.  Put it into a 250 degree oven while I cooked other stuff, for about 2 hours,it was wonderful.  :D

Oh wow! These meatballs were phenomenal. I coated them in flour and sauteed them in olive oil first to seal in juices. I rolled them about the size of a silver dollar. This will be something I make often.

This is a great recipe - although I did alter it a bit from the beginning.  Do brown the meat balls first, before adding them to sauce.  I think this adds a little flavor.  I also spiced up the meatballs with some stand-by italian spices (basic, oregano, etc.) and I upped the garlic (to taste).  Also, I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs, and used a little less than called for.  This made a very solid and yummy meatball - for those who have "spongey" meatballs.  For those who used store-bought sauce with the meatballs - nothing compares with this sauce!

I simply loved this recipe as it resembled on of my own.  In the meatballs, I used only 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausage; 1/2 cup crushed buttery crackers i.e. Ritz; 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder toi taste, 2 Tbsp chopped onion, 1 Tbsp Bell pepper, 1 Tbsp chopped celery and 1/2 pkg hamburger or meatloaf seasoning mix.  I prepared my meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then added them to my sauce.  My Sauce included 1/2 stalk chopped celery, 1/4 chopped bell pepper 1 Tbsp sugar and rather than 2 28 ounce cans whole tomatoes, I used 1 ea. 28 oz can Crushed Tomatoes and 1 ea. 28 ounce can Tomato Puree.  This eliminated the lumpy tomato chunks.  I eliminated the tomato paste altogether.  I reduced my cooking time to 30 minutes and then 30 minutes after adding the meatballs.

This recipe shouldn't be "made over" but put together as written, the meatballs and the sauce are just wonderful, unlike the mass produced, thick jarred stuff.  I've read some comments that things were added/deleted, come on, it changes the whole recipe when you do that!  Try it as written and you will not be disappointed, it is the only one we use now.

Delicious spaghetti and meatballs!  I like cooking the meatballs in the sauce as directed because it gives the sauce a rich flavor.  Be sure to use fresh bread crumbs to keep the meatballs moist.

Very good!! 
I didn't have bread crumbs, so I just used croutons that I crushed up. I used Garlic Herb ones and didn't add anything else besides the egg. Worked out great!!

If you use veal and pork with your ground beef (you can buy meatloaf mix) your meatballs will be so moist and soft.  I know from years of cooking with my grandmother and mother - trust me.  My grandmother was from Naples, Italy (right off that boat!) and taught my mother (who was German) everything about Italian cooking - she wanted my father to eat like he was still at home with her!!  Plus, brown your meatballs before you add them to your sauce.  And, make sure to cook that sauce (on low -  simmer it) for at least 2 hours or until that "raw" smell goes away.  All of a sudden, your kitchen will smell like an Italian restaurant - that's when you are sure that sauce is cooked - we call it gravy - that's one way to tell a genuine Italian!  Enjoy -  your recipe just needs these few small changes/additions - you are on the right track!!

This is one of an almost infinite number of very good "Italian" spaghetti tomato-sauce recipes. I am always intrigued when the recipe calls for "Parmesan" cheese ("Parmigiano Reggiano" cheese)- the supposed ultimate in Italian grating cheeses. Occasionally, because of almost status-symbolism, it has been referred to as the "Yuppie" cheese. In reality, a significant percentage (perhaps a majority) of Americans of Italian descent use imported Pecorino Romano cheese (I prefer the Locatelli brand)in their pasta sauces. This very tasty and usually much more reasonably priced cheese has been described as somewhat salty, spicy, sharp, and tangy. It is a sheep cheese that becomes increasingly robust with age. Try it when a pasta tomato-sauce recipe calls for Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese. You may be pleasantly surprised - certainly, your wallet will be.

This truly is delicious although, since my ground beef wasn't terribly lean, I browned the meatballs a bit before adding them to the sauce (after draining the fat).  My thanks to the person who gave us this recipe; it's great, and makes a delicious spaghetti supper!  Also, using small zip-loc bags, I put a bit of sauce and three meatballs in each to use in the future for meatball-subs on Hoagie rolls.  Wonderful to have in the freezer.

I have NEVER liked spaghetti & meatballs but one night my boyfriend asked me to make it for him and thanks to your DELICIOUS recipe, I am now a spaghetti & meatballs LOVER! I follow this recipe exactly except I use Panko bread-crumbs in the meatballs, which are the bread-crumbs I prefer for everything. This recipe does take a long time but if you plan ahead and follow it exactly- its SOOO WORTH IT!!! Plan at least 2 hours  of cook time and get the sauce going first- instead of doing the meatballs first like the recipe suggests. You have to cook the sauce for 90 minutes so you might as well do the meatballs while the sauce is cooking rather than doing them before you even start the sauce, taking on another 15-20 minutes to your entire cook time. This recipe tastes SOOO FRESH and authentic, thank you again!! I wish I could give you more than 5 stars!

The best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had! I used fresh parsley and basil and fresh-grated parm. And I used italian seasoned bread crumbs. Other than those changes I followed the recipe and it was wonderful. I had all day to cook the sauce so it ended up cooking 3 hours before adding the meatballs and I think that made the sauce even better.  Next time I will cut the olive oil at least in half so I won't have to get the oil off the top when it's done. This is one of my all time favorites from this site!

I have a suggestion: with regards to the dried parsley....I always use about 1/4 bunch of large sprigs of parsley(stems and all) of fresh parsley...this is a tip I got from my mother in law who got it from a lovely Italian neighbor of hers years ago.  Not sure of the exact difference, but her sauce recipe is to die for.  Simmer the parsley in the sauce until ready to serve, then scoop the pieces out of the sauce.  They claim it is essential to the sauce!!! Dry parsley has no taste in their (and mine) opinions!

I made this for my family during the holidays - I received rave reviews. I however improvised on a few things. I added 1 lb. ground pork (along with 2 lbs ground beef), used more cheese and a seasoned breadcrumb mix. I also added real garlic instead of powder, and used Italian seasoning with a dash extra of basil. I also added a little milk. After I rolled them, I put them in casserole dishes in one layer and baked them uncovered at 350°F for about 20 min. - until browned. Meanwhile I had the sauce simmering for about an hour (I started the sauce first on the stove top). In addition to the whole tomatoes, I added 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can tomato paste. I didn't use bay leaf but added the Italian seasoning again. I poured the sauce over the meatballs, covered and returned back to the oven for about 20 -30 minutes. Turned out fabulous and everyone said they were wonderful - even the kids. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. I didn't read the recipe  correct because was in a hurry and didn't saute the onion but put them with the olive oil right into the tomato sauce and it turned out just fine. Not a problem at all and saved effort if you are in a hurry to get it mixed up. I actually simmered it for about 3 hours.  My husband said he liked but thought Prego was just as good... Prego does have a good sauce!  So may not put this much effort for awhile  to sauce since  my family liked prego equally as much. THe meatballs were very good... I have made them like this but used soda cracers instead and liked that alot too.

Best tomato sauce I've ever made, really flavoursome and tasty. I think 2 tsps of salt is too much, I had to add another can of tomatoes to make it edible! I used cracker crumbs instead of breadcrumbs because that is what I had on hand and it was great. I was sceptical about putting the meatballs straight into the sauce without browning, but they turned out great! Brilliant recipe.

Rating based on the following changes:

SAUCE:  BLENDED the whole tomatoes for a smoother sauce.  Added 1 stalk chopped celery, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, 1 tsp garlic powder.  Doubled the tomato paste (13 oz can).

MEATBALLS:  Used ground steak instead of store bought ground beef.  Added 1/2 cup milk, 3/4 cup minced onion, 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning.  Doubled the garlic powder (1/4 tsp) and eggs (2 eggs).  Omitted the parmasan cheese.  Simmer meatballs for at least 1 hour (they were still pink after 30 min).  Meatballs were mushy, so I would recommend browning or cooking in the oven for a firmer meatball.

A GREAT recipe if you make these changes.  It was my first homemade sauce attempt and tastes better the next day.  Even after freezing, it tasted great.  Just add some of the pasta water to it and some salt, and it's perfect.

After making a different sauce recipe, I am definitely returning to this one.  Just make sure to blend the whole tomatoes if you prefer a smooth but thick sauce.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork, which makes all the difference in my opinion. I used 2-28oz cans of whole San Marzano tomatoes, and 2-28oz cans of crushed tomatoes. I sauteed the onion and garlic then transferred to my crock pot with the other ingredients and set on low for 7 hours. I also used 3/4 cup of Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the fresh bread crumbs. I never follow a recipe to make sauce and meatballs, but this is great, and my changes are because of personal preference. Instead of the basil, an Italian seasoning blend would work just great. Wonderful, classic meatball and sauce recipe! Thanks for sharing :)

The sauce was way too sweet.  It was also a bit bland.  I tried it again without the onion and sugar, and added some oregano and a bay leaf and it was much better.

Awesome! I have never made a sauce completely from scratch that I liked so I have always doctored up bottled sauce. Not anymore! I am salivating just thinking about this recipe. I love not having to brown meatballs first. Cooking the meatballs in the sauce really does add to the flavor. I made this as written the first time but the second time I put sauce in blender before the last additions to make the sauce smoother. Excellent both ways!

Fantastic!  Who needs pre-made meatballs or jarred sauce anymore?  I did add 1 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning and doubled the garlic for the meatballs.  To moisten them, I added 1/2 cup of milk to the meat before mixing in the seasonings.  It really makes them tender and moist!  I added 1/2 cup of red wine to the simmering sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe, and easy as well. I like to add a little red wine in the sauce for an extra kick.
And Diane, please refrain from correcting everyone's spelling. Reading your posts, your grammar isn't exactly book-worthy, either. This is supposed to be a recipe exchange site, not an English test.

I had never made home-made spaghetti sauce before and am I glad I chose this one as my first! I followed the recipe almost exact, made a huge pot for family and company. It was all eaten! Our family loves italian sausage so I added some to the meatballs. Very, very good recipe! Thanks so much.

I have made this twice & yum, yum, yum!! It is pretty easy to make & it tastes like it takes a lot longer. I use a lot more garlic cloves & onion only because we love them both! I also use a 28 oz can of crushed or diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones & use a big 28 oz of tomato sauce. I put extra garlic & pepper in the meatballs too, along with 1/2 c milk. I do let the sauce simmer longer than 30 min with the meatballs, just to be safe! But my two teen stepsons who are picky as picky can come, LOVED it & said they had never eaten any spaghetti & meatballs so good! My husband raved over it also which is rare because normally he just says, "oh that was good, thank you" I made it again last night & my brother was over for dinner & he cleaned his plate & took some home after saying yum it was! Great recipe with few modifications.

I won't give 5 stars for any recipe because there's always room for improvement, but this recipe is da bomb!  As some suggested I added 2 eggs and italian seasoning to the meat mixture and used half pork and half chuck as well as some dried CRUSHED RED PEPPER.  Now that is a-one-a-spicy-a-meat-a-ball-a!  The mild sauce with this meat mix is good harmony.  My husband's a tough spaghetti critic but loved this one.

As a born and raised Sicilian - I have to say this gravy recipe rivals my grandma's!  For those cooks who had their recipes turn out badly, surely you didn't read or follow the recipe correctly as it is a fairly easy and perfectly porportioned dish.  I do like the idea of using 1/2 sausage to 1/2 ground beef ratio and will try this.  The somewhat negative comments received here were due to preparer error.

This is a great recipe!!  I added some more garlic in the sauce and added some italian seasonings into the meatballs and it was so delicious!  I rolled my meatballs a little big so I had to cook them for a little over 45 minutes.  I served it with thin spaghetti, homemade garlic bread and a cesar salad!  5 stars!

This recipe got rave reviews from my family.  I used fresh herbs rather than dried, and cooked the sauce in the slow cooker all day.  I then browned the meatballs and added them for the last 45 minutes or so before serving.  We will definitely have this again!

The meatballs were very moist and tasty, probably because they don't need to be browned.  There were visible pieces of white bread in them - don't know if I should have broken them up smaller or actually toasted the crumbs.  The sauce was nice and thick, very good, but I added a lot more sugar and some red cooking wine.  Found this quite easy to make and one of the better sauces I've found.

Very good recipe--my husband wanted a spaghetti dinner for his birthday and everyone enjoyed it.  1/2009 Update--the meatballs turn out tastier when 1 tsp of both basil & oregano are added.  Also, I roll them smaller, about 1-1/2 inches and cook them in the sauce for about 45 minutes.  Use 93/7 lean ground beef and you won't have any worries about excess grease ; ).

After reading all the great reviews on this recipe; I was very anxious to make this sauce/meatball recipe.  VERY disappointing.  Meatballs were tasteless and sauce had only a tomato flavor.  Even with adding spices as others advised this is not a keeper.  I really do not understand why this got such high ratings.

This recipe was amazing and easy & quick enough to make for dinner after work. My husband and I loved it! I only made a few changes to the recipe. I used two 6-ounce cans of tomato paste and I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I also added 1 tsp. of oregano and 1/4 cup of red wine (merlot) to the sauce half an hour before it was finished. As the recipe says, the meatballs do not need to be fried or baked prior to being added to the sauce. They cooked thoroughly, retained their shape and were moist and delicious. I'll never try another sauce or meatball recipe again. Thank you, Jeremy!

I absolutely love this recipe for spaghetti sauce and have made it several times now. Very flavorful and easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of many other reviewers. 

For the meatballs: 1. I used seasoned vs plain breadcrumbs and I let the breadcrumbs soak in about 3/4c of milk BEFORE adding them to the meat. This makes the meatballs tender and moist. 2. I doubled the amount of parmesan cheese.  

For the sauce: 1. I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes on hand, so I used crushed tomatoes instead. 2. I added to small cans of tomato sauce which gave the sauce a very thick, rich body.  3. Instead of seasoning with just the basil, I used italian seasoning which made the taste PERFECT. Everyone loved the recipe, will make again and again.

Great recipe!!!!!  Not sure what happened to my initial review.  I made this dish last week and it was delicious.  I felt so domestic in the kitchen as I have been using jarred sauce all my life....NO MORE!!  I've been so inspired by this site to experiment with cooking and trying new things.  I'm looking to create traditions and solid staple recipes for my son and I. Wishing my grandmother was here to taste...

This is a good recipe. There are different Italians as they come from different parts of Italy so things are made differently. With that in mind, I will add my two cents in on this recipe. First, I NEVER use sugar or Bay Leaf. I also use CRUSHED TOMATO using more GARLIC and more BASIL. With the meatballs I add 1/2 lb. GROUND PORK to the 1 lb. GROUND BEEF. I do not use the "cheap" meats ever. If one buys cheap, end results will be cheap. I bake my meatballs in the oven to cook them. Some people prefer meatballs on the side. Add Parmesan cheese to the meatballs also. Maybe 1/4 cup to above meat amounts. With that in mind, enjoy!

I made my sauce in the crock pot. It is great on hectic days. Cook the onions and garlic in a small sauce pan, Add to crock pot when done. Place meatballs in botton of crock pot add your ingredients. I added an extra 28 oz can diced tomatoes. Cook on high for 5 hours. I removed the meatballs, and took a sub. blender to the sauce to create a smooth sauce added the meatballs back and cooked another 30 minutes. YUM Makes alot so I will try freezing the rest to enjoy later.

I have been making this exact sauce for about 5 years now and it never fails to turn out great.  I do substitute Italian seasoning for the basil and I do sometimes add any additional ingredients such as ground beef, ground sausage, peppers, mushrooms, celery, zucchini, carrots and squash instead of the meatballs for a chunkier sauce.  I usually add about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper too for that bit of bite.  As far as the meatballs go, to get the best flavor from them; mix up the meat mixture the night before you plan on eating them and let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight, you will be amazed the difference it makes!  I do have my own recipe for meatballs but mixing it up the night before is a MUST.  If your sauce turned out sour tasting, it was probably from not letting the sauce cook long enough after you added the tomato paste.

This was the first time I'd ever made meatballs and despite reading so many differing opinions on cooking them, I decided to make them in the sauce without cooking first, so I chose this recipe. Simple, delicious...we loved them. There was no "extra" grease in my sauce, which I'd read often happens and I even added Italian sausage to the beef! I doubled the recipe and sent half to my in-laws and froze half our our remaining half. There's plenty! Will definitely make again.

good starting recipe. we use romano cheese in the meatballs, and fresh garlic and bread soaked in milk for moist meatballs. for sauce, fresh garlic, onions, EVOO, puree and paste, s&p, sugar, dried basil and oregano, red wine and pinch of baking soda to ease the acid from the tomatoes. this sauce cooks for about 5-6 hours on low and stirring often or it will stick and burn, even in nonstick pot. and reseason about 2 hours before done. s&p, basil, oregano, and top off with EVOO and more "homemade red wine" if you have it. this comes from mom and grandmom, from naples, and grandpop from scilly. all excellent cooks. can't give recipies, we never measure, cook to taste only.

I only made the meatballs and used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Since lots of reviews were saying they were "bland" I added about 3/4 cup diced white onion, 2 cloves garlic, a little extra garlic salt, dried basil and made sure I had seasoned bread crumbs. Someone had mentioned adding a little milk and it really made them moist. Overall, great though!

A teaspoon of oregano makes this dish even better than it already is. :D Thanks for a great recipe! The leftover meatballs are wonderful stuffed into a hoagie bun, topped with warmed sauce, pizza cheese and placed under the broiler until the cheese melts. YUM!!!

I've made this recipe at least 3 times and have been asked for the recipe by so many people.  The only changes I made were to use Italian sausage in place of the ground beef and I always soak my bread crumbs in milk and squeeze the milk out before I put them in the meatball mixture; this step will guaranty very moist meatballs.  The total 2 hour simmer time is essential; it is what makes this sauce so rich and intense with basic ingredients.

Fantastic! MADE THE RECIPE TWICE AND 
AFTER FOLLOWING IT EXACTLY MADE SOME 
CHANGES.

Options I used:
Added some salt to the meat ( a mix of
veal, pork and ground beef) and
a dash of red pepper too.

Definitely cook the meatballs in the
sauce. Soooo tender and delicious.
I cooked them for 35 minutes. Done!

Sauce Options:
Like some others I used one large can
of whole tomatoes and cut them up and
a large can of diced tomatoes.
Also, I added a few dashes of red
pepper flakes to the sauce.

Two cans of tomato paste for a richer
sauce.

Also I added one Cuban Pepper. Cut some slits into the whole pepper.
 Cooked in sauce and tossed before
serving.

Cooked in my crock pot. A great meal!

These were easy to make, but absolutely tasteless. I would have cut down on breadcrumbs and increased the spices had I taken the time to think about the combination of ingredients.  I had to add water to the mixture to make it moist enough to work with.  I'm certain there are recipes for better tasting meatballs out there.  Don't bother with this one.

Sorry, I'll eat just about anything but I think this is really bad.  I'm not sure what all the raves were about.  It's partly my fault though for using ground turkey.  Even with beef, I think it would be too "doughy" as 1 cup of breadcrumbs is way too much!  Also, it was almost tasteless, except for the breadcrumb taste.  Fortunately my reliable Prego spaghetti sauce savaged the meal.

 Some diced eggplant and sliced mushrooms added to the saute is good to

This is the best meatball recipe I have found yet! My family loves it...I have experimented with this recipe a lot. I cooked the meatballs in regular store bought spagetti sauce, which was good... and I have even tried making the meatballs with ground turkey and cooked them in a cranberry sauce, which was also delicious.

AWESOME!!  Oh, this is so good!  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I did use ground turkey in place of the hambuger and Ritz cracker crumbs instead of the bread crumbs...easily the BEST meatballs I have ever eaten.  For the sauce I follwed very closely..after the first 90 minutes, I did use a potato masher on the chunks of tomato (I was afraid my 5 year old won't like it with *lumps*!)  I was also a bit leary of adding the meatballs raw, but they cook up moist and just perfect in the 30 minutes of simmering.  This is WELL worth the prep time!!!

This was very good. I followed the recipe just like it was and really did not need any changing. I do think the meatballs are what make this meal. The sauce is average and I prefer some of my other sauce recipes over this one. However, I would definitely make it again. Also, making the meatballs is a fun thing to make with the family/kids :)

Edit: Have made this a couple of more times since the first review, and now the sauce kind of grew on me ;) Yummy.

I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but this was too awesome not to not leave feedback. Like others, I was a little hesitant to cook the meatballs without browning them first but I've always hated the process of browning the first because it takes constant attention and usually has to be in several batches. I don't regret not browning them one bit: they were tender and moist but still held together really well. 
That said about the delicious meatballs, the true star of the show is the sauce. It has such a fresh, bright flavor and nice chunky texture: I could eat it with a spoon like soup! AND, as a matter of fact, I've added it to soups, used it for lasagna, on homemade pizza and on top of ravioli. I'll never buy commercially prepared sauce again! I've made this at least six time since I originally made the spaghetti and meatballs two months ago. 
The ONLY change I made (and this is just personal preference) was to add a little oregano and a few flakes of red pepper for some kick. 
Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This was beautiful.  I loved both the meatballs and the sauce separately, but together, so very good!  I made them gluten free because of a wheat allergy by making my own breadcrumbs with GF bread but other than that I kept everything else the same. Served it over rice noodles.  Made meatball sandwiches the next day for my sister and her family and she asked for the recipe after her picky 4 year old gave it a thumbs up!

This was AWESOME! We had a pound of ground hot italian sausage so we used that instead of the beef and also used the whole tomatoes with basil and it was PERFECT!  This is definitely going in our rotation.

I'm giving this two stars because the meatballs were pretty good. The sauce, however, was awful! Two cans of tomatoes was way too much, and they were too large. The whole thing turned out bland, boring, and incredibly oily. It wasn't any better than a jar of Ragu (which I would never use). Will definitely not make this again!

These are great meatballs! I have a big family so I tripled the recipe put fresh garlic in place of the powder, added a little onion powder to the mixture. They held their shape and was nice and firm with a little chew to them. The sauce is super easy and the longer it simmered the better it tasted. I didn't have the best pot for the job so I had to stir it alot to keep it from scortching on the bottom. We are also big mushroom eaters so I added that to the sauce didn't change the taste. My family loved it and we plan to use the few leftovers for dinner tonight and make grinders. I can't wait. Oh yeah I too was nervous about the meat not being precooked but they cooked up very well I simmered mine for 45 mins just because I had so many and they were all done. Thanks for a great recipe.

Long story short, I thought I had spaghetti sauce in the cupboard.  I didn't.  I had to make sauce, so I chose this recipe because I had all ingredients on hand and it looked easy enough. 

Fast forward to now.  The only reason my husband has stopped raving about this meal is that he went to bed.  He said that this ranks in the Top 5 meals I've ever made.....   He also asked me to make additional batches to put in the freezer so we always have some on-hand.  I've never gotten this kind of reaction from him before.  Who knew it was this easy?  
Anyhow, I made the recipe almost as written.  I only had crushed tomatoes, so I used those instead of whole.  Also, I did have to add about 1/3 cup of water toward the end of the final 30 minutes, but that was it.  Obviously I'll be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe, Jeremy!

I found this recipe terrible.  I followed the instructions exactly.  Left a bad after taste in our mouth.  I went back over the recipe to see if I had missed anything and as far as I can tell I didn't. Had to add a bunch of spices just so we could eat it.

The only thing bad I can say about this sauce is that I am depressed that it took me this long to find it.  I have probably tried dozens of recipes for the perfect sauce over the years, and while some are better than others, overall I always just felt like something was missing.  At first I almost didn't try the sauce because it sounded so darned easy and had so few ingredients.  I am so glad I did - it is literally what I've been looking for my whole life.  I cannot comment on the meatballs because I didn't make them.  I have made the recipe as written about a half a dozen times.  The only change I make is a slight one - I add ground beef with the onions and garlic, because we like a meaty sauce.  At the end, before I serve, I remove the bayleaf and use my emulsion hand blender to blend the sauce in the pan so that it is a smooth sauce (kids hate large pieces of tomato in their sauce.  The result is literally a thing of beauty, and it clings to the pasta perfectly.  If you are not preparing to make this sauce right now, you are missing out!

My first homemade spaghetti sauce was fabulous!!!  Minor substitutions:   I used one 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes and one 28-oz can of diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic & oregano.   I also used only 1 tsp of salt.   After sauteeing the onion & garlic, I put everything (except the tomato paste, basil & pepper) into the crockpot and let it simmer on low for about 5-6 hours.   I added those last 3 ingredients along with 1/4 cup red wine (malbec) and my own homemade prebaked meatballs for one more hour.    SUPER!!!!   Goodbye jarred sauce!

Delicious! The meatballs came out perfectly tender. The key is the fresh breadcrumbs, they soak up sauce and become "moisture blobs" in the meatballs. lol. I added more garlic to them and threw in a little salt and a small amount of red pepper flakes to avoid the bland tasting meatballs that some other reviewers mentioned. I will definitely make this again. As with all recipes that call for basil, I implore you to use fresh basil (Use 3X the amount when using fresh!), it's so much better than dry basil.

This recipe was really good.  It was so simple, that I had my doubts.  But the flavors all came together beautifully.  It was perfect on hoagie rolls for meatball grinders.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I come from a Sicilian family and have scoured the internet looking for a sauce recipe that mimicked my mom's, what she calls "sugo"...well this is it.  The meatballs are delicious and the sauce is perfect, this is the only sauce recipe I use now.  Thank you so much!

Very good, just a bit salty. Reduce salt to 1 teaspoon and adjust after that.

I am a Italian food freak, especially when it comes to spaghetti. I really loved this recipe.  I simmered the sauce all day which really helped to break up the whole tomatos.  I may use diced in the future, but using whole makes it taste a little more authentic.  I also baked the meatballs until they were half cooked. I just could not get myself to cook them in the sauce.  Cooking them half in the oven and finishing them in the sauce worked great for me.

Only okay for me and I would not make it again. I found the meatballs okay but bland when made as per directions. Just needed something more.
The sauce needed more flavour and some spice. I used fresh basil and still needed zip. I did not find it overly sweet but did add only 1 tsp of salt as it just seemed like too much.
Probably just my taste but if you are looking for a really tasty spaghetti sauce with meatballs, I would not make this.

Pretty good, except I felt there was too much olive oil in it.  If I make it again, I will definitely reduce the amount of oil.

It was good, but for the time it took I was expecting something amazing!  I didn't think the sauce had a lot of flavor, I added mushrooms and red peppers in the last 30 minutes and this helped.  At 90mins I also took out the whole tomatoes and ran them through the food processor so the sauce was smoother.  I don't think I would make it again, especially based on the time.

Only thing I did different was left out the tomato paste because I'm just not a fan. 5 stars for taste, and while the meatballs were good, the outsides had a slightly slimy quality I wasn't crazy about, so 4 stars. No one else said anything. I may have been the only one who noticed. Maybe I'm just very spoiled, but I will brown the meatballs before they go in the sauce next time. Thanks Jeremy!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made some minor adjustments.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole and added dried oregano to the sauce.  This is the BEST pasta sauce I've ever had.  The meatballs were DELISH!!!  Thanks for sharing.....

This was amazing. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it came out pretty oily. Next time I think I will reduce the olive oil to about 2 tablespoons. But other than that, this was delicious. I made this without the tomato paste and it still came out great! I'm never buying bottled sauce ever again!

Very good meatballs!  I cooked them in the oven though.  350 degrees for 20-25 minutes, turning them once.  Came out Crunchy and held together in the sauce.

This is how I have always done it! Put the seasons in first though to flavor the sauce and while it's cooking prepare the meatballs. Try tons of fresh parsley (1/2 cup) chopped up for the meatballs, as well as Italian seasoned bread crumbs! Who needs to fry-Throw em in for healthy and they are more moist from the sauce. Just make sure to NEVER PUT THE MEATBALLS IN UNLESS THE is BUBBLING Hot! They will fall apart if not.

Really liked this recipe. I just did the meatballs since I already had some marinara sauce but next time I'm going to make the entire recipe. The meatballs were delicious, and I liked how you could cook the meatballs along with the sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe. And so easy to simmer the meatballs in the sauce. Like many spaghetti recipes, this one just gets better and better by the second day. I like to make it ahead of time and reheat before serving or let the sauce simmer all day. Fabulous! Thanks for sharing.

I made this yesterday for dinner.  With the exception of adding cayenne to the meatballs and red pepper flakes to the onions while sauteing I followed this recipe.   Magnifico!!!.  The meatballs being cooked in this fashion made the sauce incredible, not at all greasy.    The sauce was so rich and the perfect consistency.   This is my way to prepare meatballs and sauce from now on.   Absolutley wonderful.  If your looking for a wow' em meatballs and sauce recipe; your search is over. Serve this on a date night you'll win him over for sure!!!  If you want them spicier then add the additional spice you want.   Can't go wrong with this one. !!!  Can't wait for superbowl this year this will definitely be on my menu served as sandwiches.

Awesome sauce.  Matches my own that I have used for years, but much easier.  Found the m/balls to be a little 'bready', so may cut back on the crumbs a bit.  But other than that, highly recommended !!

This was really good & really easy!  Who knew so few ingredients would make such a tasty sauce.  I was nervous about putting raw meat into the sauce... but it turned out great.  I thought the meatballs were very flavorful and not at all dry.  I may try this next time in a slow cooker.  Thank you for sharing!

After reading reviews, I gave this recipe a shot even though I, like other reviewers, was skeptical about not pre-cooking the meatballs.  Dont be!!  Fantastic Recipe.  My reason for giving 4 stars? First, I hate whole tomates, and even though I used them this time, I will definately use diced the next.  And also the Directions.  Make the Sauce first, then the meatballs.  To me, it was just bad time management to not have the sauce simmering while making the meatballs.  Great tasting recipe and I look foreward to making this again.  **Update**  I made this again with turkey, because it's always good to have a healthier option.  It was terrible.  The meatballs turned out extremely dry and tasteless.  Even the sauce tasted different.  From now on, I'll only use extra lean ground beef.

Great recipe!!  It tasted  better than most spaghetti and meatballs I've gotten at some nice Italian restaurants!  I pretty much followed the directions, except I added about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the meatballs and a tad more garlic powder than called for... they turned out amazing!  The meatballs went really fast, but I still had a lot of sauce left over.  Next time I make this, I will increase the meatball recipe to 1.5 to 2 pounds of meat, or half the sauce recipe.

Made this for the 2nd time tonight and still am not completely sold on it. However, once again, my fiancee loved it. The sauce just seems like it's missing something to me. I added a pound of mushrooms (sliced) when I added the meatballs. I also did give the meatballs a quick sizzle in a frypan to get a little of the fat off before putting them in the sauce. This is really good, just needs a little more spices I think. Thank you :)

I thought the sauce was really good with a whole chopped onion, San Marzano canned Italian crushed tomatoes, 1/2c chianti, & 1T Italian seasoning rather than the dried basil.  I made the meatballs as written, but thought they tasted odd and were not very tender.  I prefer my regular meatball recipe, so will use this sauce with that recipe, in the future.  Thanks, Jeremy!

The sauce was a little runny and a little clumpy (b/c of the whole tomatoes). So, I let some fluid simmer off before adding the paste and other ingredients and I mashed the whole tomatoes w/a fork in the sauce pan. With those changes, it's definitely FIVE stars.

I USED CANNED SAN MARZANO TOMATOES (ANY ITALIAN STORE), THEY COST ALOT  MORE BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL DIFINETLY TASTE THE DIFFERENCE IF YOU USE THESE IN ANY SPAGETTI SAUCE. ALSO ADDED SOME ITALIAN SAUSAGE SEASONING. THIS WS AN VERY EASY RECIPIE TO MAKE. YOU WILL FIND IT VERY HARD TO USE SAUCE FROM A JAR AGAIN!

love this recipe!! I add 1 tsp of onion powder and 1 tsp of italian seasoning to the meatballs and usually bake them for about 20 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees before adding them to the sauce.  with the sauce I use one can of whole tomatoes and one can crushed tomatoes as we like it a little thicker.  we have this at least a couple times a month, it's soooooo delicious!!

I didn't make the sauce, just used jars of sauce. But I used the meatball recipe with some ground venison and it was a BIG hit! My kids loved it, and my husband (who has not been a big fan of venison) even ate a good share of it. I made this in the crock pot and let it simmer all day. Yum!

I've been using this recipe for about a year now.  I use diced tomatoes rather than the whole.  I've even made just the sauce and used it in other pasta dishes.  This works VERY well with lasagna.  True Italian flavor ... now, if only I could master the homemade pasta!

This was delicious!  I made it for my daughter for her birthday.  She wanted Spagetti and meatballs and so I looked it up and found this one.  I browned my meatballs before adding to the sauce.  We had it for two dinners and then I froze the rest.  It tasted just as good after being frozen.  I will make a double batch and freeze several portions the weekday dinners.  Enjoy!

These meatballs turned out so delicious - we had this dinner for three nights in a row (I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef)!  I have always made my own sauce, pretty much the same as this recipe calls for, except I always add about half a cup of ketchup and a couple tablespoons or so of worcestershire sauce (these really make a difference), as well as a splash of red wine and lots of herbs.  I baked the meatballs for about 20 min @ 350F to get some excess fat off, but finished them off in the sauce.  They were tender and delicious.  Try adding a bit of cayenne pepper if you like things a bit spicy too.

Maybe I'm not a good judge of meatballs, but I don't know what the people who didn't like this are talking about. I even made it with ground white turkey and I still thought they were good. I took some of the suggestions to roll them in flour and brown them in olive oil before cooking them in the sauce. I also added a little red wine and 1/4 t. of crushed red pepper flakes for some kick. I love it! My guest loved it! It was even better reheated the next day (and I'm not a lover of leftovers). Will make this again and again.

This dish is phenomenal!!!....I make it regularly!!!! ??  
I doubled the recipe for my family if five. *FYI - 2 lbs of meat = about 40, 1" meatballs and did half ground beef and half Italian sausage.  I used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs.  For the sauce I pureed Aldi organic canned diced tomatoes for a smoother sauce.  I used half the amount of sugar. I didn't have bay leaves so used oregano this time. Also added Italian seasoning.  **And yes, the raw meatballs cook perfectly in the hot sauce...they started turning brown within minutes of being added.
Oh SOOOOO yummy!!!!!!!

This came out great. I used ground chicken, and put a little milk into the meat mix and it was moist and delicious. I ended up just throwing the ground meat right into the sauce without forming the meatballs. Mixed into spaghetti, this meal was delicious!

If I could give this 100 stars, I would!  This review is mostly for the sauce:  This is hands down the best, easy spaghetti sauce I've ever made.  It's better than anything from a jar - and just as easy to use.  The batch is enormous - so you can make it and freeze half, and have it on hand for those emergency dinners when you don't know what else to make.  The first several times I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  I now triple the onion, double the garlic and basil, and add an equal part of oregano to the basil.  Delicious and oh-so-flavorful.  The meatballs are delicious and tender but not any better than any others that I've had.  I do like that you cook them in the sauce, and it does add another flavor dimension to it.

The sauce was nice - nothing earth shattering, but easy and tasty. I made it in the crockpot based on another review here, great idea! I would make this again, but I would make the meatballs about half the size next time. The recipe says to make 12, but they are really big, and as some have noted here they have kind of a bready texture from all the breadcrumbs. I think if you didn't have to cut into them but could just pop them in your mouth they would be more appealing. I would also add a little minced onion or something to them next time. But overall, nice recipe.

I love this recipe and give it, along with the dry ingredients to brides for a shower gift.  I do find the recipe incredibly salty, so always cut the salt in half.  I'm sure it probably tastes better to also follow the cooking instructions, but I throw all the ingredients in the pot, bring to a boil and simmer until meatballs are cooked through (approx 30 min) saves time at the end of a long work day.  Spaghetti with meatballs just feels more special then mixing ground beef into the sauce.

I have made this recipe several times and it's a big hit! I will say I followed the directions to the "T" the first time I made this sauce so I could factually report on someone else's recipe. I'm not sure how someone can give an accurate critque on any given recipe when they write I followed the recipe except I did... (xyz). I have never been able to understand that that. Any way now my soap box speech is over, I have changed the sauce a little. Instead of using cans of whole tomatoes, I used crushed instead and I used 4 cloves of garlic instead 5. The meat balls I made as directed and continue to do so. My family loves this recipe. It takes longer than opening a jar but it is by far worth the effort.

Loved this recipe! My family raved over it tonight as they ate all up. I doubled the meatball recipe and made eight large meatballs. I also used fresh basil and parsley from the garden in the sauce. Also added about 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the sauce before putting in the meatballs. My father-in-law who is from Croatia and whose mother is from Italy taught me to do this 20 years ago when he first taught me how to make his mother's spaghetti sauce. It cuts the acidity and gives the sauce a smoother taste. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This sauce is great! For years I've been looking for a good spaghetti sauce. I didn't make the meatballs but added 2lbs ground chuck instead.

For the tomatoes I used 2 28 oz cans of diced tomato with garlic and olive oil because that's what I had in my pantry. Before adding the bay leaf I ran my immersion blender through the sauce to smooth it out because my husband doesn't like tomato chunks. 

We really noticed how much lighter this was than jarred sauce. It was great without all the added sugar and preservatives. It was delicious!

Next time I'll add some chopped green or red pepper and some portabella mushrooms. You could also add shredded carrots and zucchini. If your family doesn't care for added veggies, you could sautee them and puree them in a food processor to hide them. :)

I have not tried this sauce yet, but I made the meatballs and they are the best meatballs I have ever had. They are so moist and just amazingly delicious! It is the perfect amount of seasoning. They just melt in your mouth. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to brown the outside of the meatballs in a panand then tossed them into the sauce to cook the rest of the way. I wanted to keep any excess fat from going in as well...trying to eat healthier. But I must say, I will never eat another meatball again! I am trying the sauce next week, I can just imagine how delicious that will be. Thank You for posting this recipe--A true delight!!

I was excited to make this recipe because of the very high ratings it has received. However, I followed the directions exactly and thought it was very acidic. It had a very sharp flavor that none of us enjoyed. I will definitely stick to our family's usual recipe from now on. On the bright side, the meatballs were really good, and I would definitely make those again!

Very good sauce! I doubled the batch and used 2 cans whole tomatoes and 2 cans pured tomatoes (meant to buy diced). I was scared of not pre cooking the meatballs and was a little short on time so I browned them slightly (didn't fully cook them) before putting them in the sauce. The sauce got rave reviews!

This is an easy, great tasting receipe and was a big hit with my wife. She always cooks her meatballs first, so this was a departure from our norm. My notes: (1) If you're in a hurry start the sauce first, then the meatballs. (2) With the meatballs cooking for 30 min. in the sauce they were really moist and nice. I modified the recepe a bit as well based on other reviews. For the meatballs I added a tsp of fennel and cooked a Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage, put it in the blender, and added it to 12 oz beef/4 oz ground pork. (3) As blondeprincess mentioned after the 90 min. of simmering I took the peeled whole tomato sauce and put it in the blender to puree the sauce - great idea. (4) I also added to the sauce 1/4 cup of red wine and a tsp. of italian seasoning.

Well, that was ok. the meatballs seemed to have too much bread crumbs. It didn't really have a robust flavor like I was hoping. Good, more like average. I have definately had better. Made 19 smaller/medium meatballs, just fyi.

I made this as written with the exception of using 1 can of diced tomatoes and one can of crushed tomatoes as some in my family are not fond of large pieces of tomato in the sauce.  It is very good!  I used 90% lean ground sirloin for the meatballs though which may have been a mistake as they were on the dry side.  Think I will use 80% next time.  Also, will try fresh basil next time and think this will take this recipe over the top!!

My family love this! We are italian, and we have our own recipe that is similar to this. We altered this recipe to our own liking and taste, which we added more garlic, oregano, italian seasoning just a touch to the sauce. It was delicious with whole wheat spaghetti. Delicious!

I am on a relatively low carb diet, and was craving spagetti and meatballs. My husband said to just open a jar of sauce. I said NO WAY! This was easy and so worth it. Made as is, except used splenda instead of sugar.

Love this recipes! Have made it several times. I put everything in a crockpot (including uncooked meatballs) and it comes out great. I have browned the meatballs before to get a little crisp on the outside. I use 1 can crushed italian style tomatoes and 1 can chopped.
Thank you for the great recipe!!

I was not all that impressed with this recipe and I had such high hopes after reading all the reviews.  The meatballs and the sauce were fairly bland.  I am moving on to try and find a different, more authentic spaghetti recipe.

Awesome. I am a novice cook and I made this for my family last night. Super easy, and REALLY GOOD (I'm talking impress-the-parents good.) Only changes I made:

Sauce:
Added some red pepper flakes to sauce before simmering (we like it spicy)
Used one 28 oz. can whole tomatoes and one 28 oz. can crushed - better consistency
2 tsp. of sugar instead of 1 - it was tasting a little too tomato-ey
Added 1/2 tsp. each of sage, rosemary, and thyme (Simon and Garfunkel knew what they were talking about)

Meatballs:
These were so great. The only change I made was adding 1 tbsp. of ricotta to the mix.

Otherwise I followed the recipe as is. I would print it out and frame it if I could. Love it, love it, love it.

Happy cooking!

A really good easy recipe.  I will use this again.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of the garlic powder.  I grated lots of garlic into the meat mixture because we love garlic.  This one's a keeper.

This was really good. I added some sliced bell peppers and mushrooms to the sauce, and some chopped onions and a little milk (about 1/4 cup) to the meatballs. I also cooked the meatballs in the oven because I didn't have lean ground beef on hand. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

The rating is for the sauce only. I made a double batch to have for future meals. This was my 2nd time making red sauce and I definitely prefer this recipe. I served the sauce with penne pasta and freshly grated Parmesan which made for a simple but tasty meal due in large part to this sauce. Tonight I made meatballs using the Meatball Nirvana recipe and made meatball subs. SO GOOD!

I am different than most...I love this recipe for the sauce.  Even though this sauce is amazing, we don’t like the meatballs, hence my 4 star rating.  Trust me though, the sauce really is great and since I can't cook to save my life (really I can't), I look like a chef with this one...you can't go wrong.  I pull this one out now when I want to impress people because I want people to think what a great cook I am.  Thanks! UPDATE:  I've been making/canning this for at least nine months, maybe more.  This is a HIT everywhere I go and people beg me for a jar (or 2).  People swear my sauce is absolutely the best sauce ever made.  I will admit, over time I've made a few adjustments (don't we all).  I rarely make just one batch of this at a time.  I almost always make at least 2 or 3.  And when I'm canning it I make 6.  I use A LOT more garlic.  The recipe calls for 5 cloves, but with that amount, we couldn't taste the flavor.  So I use a large bulb per 2 batches.  I know it sounds like a lot, but it really isn't (especially if you like garlic).  I used at least 1 large sweet onion per 2 batches.  I also now make it so the spices at the end are 1t basil, 1t oregano and 1/2t pepper (per batch).  I read somewhere (maybe here) that if your sauce is bitter it could be from the paste and you just need to simmer it longer. I cook mine for 90 min before adding the paste/spices and then at least 90 min if not more before serving.  HTH someone!

Best spaghetti and meatballs recipe I have tried. I followed the recipe exactly as written (how else can you rate a recipe??) There is no need to pre-cook the meatballs; I used ground round. People who have tried this recipe at my house think it's a secret family recipe (my folks are Italian). And I love the fact that I know what I am feeding my family (no artificial anything!) Thanks, Jeremy!

This was really good, I'm giving it 4 stars because I did make some modifications.  I added a little bit more sugar, substituted 1 can of the whole tomatoes for diced, added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, a jar of pizza sauce and more stewed tomatoes.  I let it simmer for quite a while and processed it through a food mill to get a nice consistency.  The only thing I did different on the meatballs was use plain bread crumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs.  They turned out great.  My 2 year old son had a blast putting them together with me.

My family loved this.  I even made a second batch the next day to give to my best friend for Valentine's Day.  Was skeptical about cooking the meatballs in the sauce, but turned out great!  My husband asked me to use less onions next time.  I cut down to    1/2 c onions with the second batch.  I added some salt and basil to the meatball mixture.  So simple, and so delicious, makes the house smell great!

I love this recipe, it is delicious!!  I followed to a T the first time, but the meatballs were kind of grey, bland and unappetizing.  So, instead after rolling them out, I put them on a cookie sheet and stick them in the oven at 350 for like 30 minutes.  They get nice and toasty brown with mega flavor.  Yummy!!

This is a great basic sauce.  Nice and clean tasting compared to the sauce I usually make that has tons of spices and lots of sugar.  I made this exactly as written.  My husband thought it was a little too chunky, so next time I might use diced tomatoes instead (maybe....I loved it as is).  I also might put in a few red pepper flakes for a little zip.  Like other reviewers, I questioned putting in the meatballs raw, but they browned nicely and flavored the sauce too.  Yummy!!!

Wonderful! Delicious and easy. A great compromise between prepared out-of-a-jar type of meal and a slave-over-the-stove-for-hours meal. Due to the crowd I had, I tripled the recipe. In doing this, I did substitute one pound of beef for a pound of ground pork (essentially, 1/3 of the meat was ground pork, the rest ground beef). I also served as grinders, so had a lot of sauce left over -- made two killer lasagnas to use it up! Thank you, Jeremy, for a ton of really great food!!!

Not a meatball left after making a double batch for a family get together...enough said? :)    Would have given a 5 star rating but I did change it very slightly to match my ingredients on hand:   made the meatballs with 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork  added some italian seasoning to the sauce for personal taste.  YUMMY!

This is such a great recipe! The only thing I did to change it was to add a cup of Pinot Noir...added a delicious flavor and my friends and family loved it!  Best part is it's easy!!  And spaghetti always warms people up :)

Soo good!  For my first attempt at meatballs, these were delicious!  The sauce was fantastic; I might add some more canned tomato sauce for leftovers.

Delicious! I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatos and one 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes to have a smoother sauce and in the end I still ended putting about 1/2 in the blender to smooth it even more. My husband can find a chunk of tomato with his eyes closed and absolutely hates them. Other than that substitution and the blending I stuck to the original recipe. It did take a good amount of time but it was well worth it. Far better than any jar of sauce you can buy and the meatballs were a wonderful texture and flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly for the ingredients, but opted to cook it in my slow cooker to make it easier.  I made the meatballs in advance the night before.  Then, before I left for work, I prepared the sauce in the slow cooker and added the meatballs.  All day cooking allowed the flavors to really blend together and the meatballs were so tender.  A new family favorite that will be used very often with my slow cooker.  Just a fabulous, delicious meal.

This review is for the meatballs only; I use a different sauce recipe.  My husband is Italian, and he and his family raved about these meatballs.  I used the "meatloaf mix" (pork, veal, beef) instead of just ground beef.  I also used two cloves of finely chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and a mix of basil and oregano instead of parsley.  I've made these meatballs a few times now, and they are always perfect!  They're so good, I made them for myself for my birthday dinner!

The first time I made this, I thought it was good but nothing all that special.  My friends and family absolutely love it though, so it's become my go-to spaghetti sauce recipe, and I make it often.  I add a pinch or two of Italian seasoning when I add the tomatoes, and use about a pound and a half of ground beef for somewhat larger meatballs.  Also, adding a tablespoon or so of milk or half and half to the meat mixture makes for a more tender meatball.  Recommended!

Good base.   I have a big family and doubled the recipe; I used 2 28-oz cans of crushed tomatoes rather than whole; 1 15-oz can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic; 2 15-oz cans of tomato sauce; and 1 can of tomato paste.  I was afraid that adding another can of tomato paste would make the sauce too thick once I added the meatballs.  Other than those changes and a sprinkling of Italian Seasoning, I made this recipe exactly as described.  We all loved the meatballs, and the sauce was tasty.  I also made some italian sausage in the oven to serve with the spaghetti...I bet that would be awesome thrown (precooked) into the pot in the last 15-min to 1/2 hour!

The sauce in this recipe is EXCELLENT. Try it add your own additions. You will never buy a can sauce again. Don't be afraid of the whole tomatoes they will mash or blend easily. I will be freezing this in 1 quart containers from now on.

I threw a dinner party last night, and this was definitely a huge hit. I was a little worried about cooking the meatballs in the sauce itself, but it turned out wonderfully! I just let it simmer an additional 10 minutes. I also added some green bell peppers and some chopped celery. Everyone loved it! I would definitely recommend it!

This sauce is absolutely incredible. I did add a little more garlic and a tad bit more salt, but those were the only modifications I made. It came out excellent! I will never use prepared sauce ever again. This is well worth the effort!

I made this over a year ago and had no desire to make it again until now.  Although both times I thought it was good, next time I think I will cut down on the breadcrumbs as the meatballs were a little too dry and bready.  I will also brown the meatballs before dropping into the sauce, either in a skillet or in the oven.  The carmelization on the meatballs from browning will add flavor to the sauce (says Rachael Ray) LOL.  I think that will also cut down on grease in the sauce.  The sauce is acidic as some have said and I'm not sure how to remedy that.  Might try draining the tomatoes and adding  beef broth instead.  I look forward to making again with these changes.

I (like several other reviewers) don't get home to make a fabulous meal that takes 2 hours or I would be eating at 9pm each night. So I cheated on this recipe - I made the meatballs exactly as the recipe called for. They were delicious!! Really flavorful - great texture and perfectly cooked. I didn't make the spaghetti sauce myself, instead using just Bertolli's olive oil and garlic spaghetti sauce. I simmered the meatballs in the spaghetti sauce for 30  minutes and they cooked perfectly. I also only cook with whole wheat pasta (used penne for this).  My husband loved them too! Definitely going on the repeat list. I have tried several other meatball recipes on here and I think this is the best! Thanks for sharing!

This is WAY TOO SALTY!!!!  I could hardly finish the one serving I had.  I liked the richness of the sauce with the meatballs cooked in it.  I will try this again, but next time I will just leave out the salt completely.

We LOVE this spaghetti sauce!! My husband calls this restaurant quality. The first time I made this I accidently left out the pepper and basil and tomato paste and it still turned out great. The second time I remembered all the ingredients, but halved the tomato paste and we thought it was even bettter. I recommend using less olive oil than it calls for. So great and fresh tasting, everyone I've served this too has loved it!

Wonderful!  I was looking for a spaghetti sauce only, not the meatballs.  I have not tried the meatballs, so I'm just rating on the sauce.  The first time I made this sauce it was wonderful.  The next time I made the sauce I added a bag of Italian Sausage veggie crumbles.  It went from wonderful to sensational!  Thank you!

This was just OK.  I think 1 cup of bread crumbs was just too much and the Parmesan not enough; overall the meatballs were bland to our taste and definitely needed salt.  Will try again with 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, and a bit of Cavender's Greek seasoning.  For the sauce I will use brown sugar, a heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon of fennel; just dump it all together in my slow cooker and add the meatballs about 45 minutes before we are ready to eat.

I really loved this recipe..I did add some more spices to the sauce and the meat balls and also added red wine ( really good red wine) to the sauce in the last 30 min. of cooking.  My hubby, who is italian, LOVED the whole meal!  He said it's his favorite sauce and meat balls ever.  I think another sauce I make is a little better but can't agrue with the ITALIAN taste buds! I made this with split french bread with butter, garlic powder, italian seasoning and shredded italian cheeses...thanks Jeremy for a great recipe.EDIT: I HAD A LOT OF THE SAUCE AND MEATBALLS LEFT OVER SO I MADE MEATBALL SANDWICHES IT THEY WERE AMAZING!! JUST TOAST YOU BUNS IN THE OVEN WITH SOME BUTTER AND TOP WITH SAUCE AND MEATBALLS. FAB!!*****update*****  I have used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it's just as good!

I'm from India and love Italian food. If there is ONE recipe I'd want to take away from Allrecipes in all these years- it's this one! This recipe is delicious, easy and comforting & always has me looking forward to leftovers the next day. I cook just for myself & to reduce cooking time I either freeze some of the meatball sauce for later or I just freeze the meatballs flat in a ziploc bag to add to a new batch of sauce whenever I make it next. Leftovers can also be layered into lasagna or meatball subs. I make sure I have firm but moist meatballs by adding a little milk to the breadcrumbs. My meatballs used to crumble (rupture rather) initially but I think the issue was in the rolling-- roll them with no cracks in the hollows of your palms. (I have practice from rolling gulab jamuns!) I also use only fresh tomatoes, plumped & skinned in boiling water. The recipe is pretty flexible and I'm partial to upping the garlic sometimes (20 cloves), using lots of fresh basil if on hand, mushrooms and peppers and sometimes even half a cup of good red wine. It's a easy and forgiving recipe if you're cooking in a kitchen where you may not have all the ingredients & the main key is to let it simmer for those full 2 hours so all the flavors meld into deliciousness!

Very good, Hubby likes them! (picky hubby) I liked the meatballs on spaghetti and on a sub sandwich. Only thing I did different was use diced tomatos instead of whole, turned out great any way.

I only made the meatballs, but they were awesome. I used jarred sauce (I know, I know, but I didn't think to make my own and didn't have the ingredients on hand). They cooked in about an hour and made the jarred sauce divine!  Update: I finally made the sauce a few times and it's great. I like to use fresh Jersey tomatoes though - yum!

I did not cook the sauce but only meatballs.  The meatballs came out real good but I added a 1/2 cup of milk so they would be more moist.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it a few times. It tastes great as listed without modifications but I wanted to add a couple issues.   Browning vs Not Browning It honestly works both ways; however, I felt like browning the meatballs made them more flavorful. When i didn't brown them, they were a bit bland in the sauce. My Italian boyfriend even could tell the difference. I would suggest browning for more flavor.   Bitterness: One time the sauce came out bitter. I still am not sure why. I think it might have been the dry ingredients instead of using fresh or possibly sauteing the garlic too long. I used more sugar and was able to cut the bitterness out.   Tricks/Tips:  Couple things I tried made the meatballs awesome! Seasoning the egg with salt, adding 1/4 cup Parm cheese to the meatballs, and soaking the bread crumbs in a little bit of light table cream (I'm sure milk works too).   I hope this helps some with the same questions that I originally had.

Before I start my review, I want to say the 5* are from my husband, I would give it 4*, only because Im not a huge red sauce fan to begin with, but this was pretty darn good.  I was nervous as well about the raw meatballs...VERY, so I ended up cooking them longer then she said, but they still turned out very moist.  I had cooked dinner ahead of time, so my husband had eaten without me, and he had eaten a tupperware full of sauce and meatballs himself, and he isn't a meat fan with his red sauces.  I did EVERYTHING like she said, except I added mushrooms, cause I love mushrooms in my spagetti sauce.  Oh and I also made the meatballs smallers, so it made like 30-35 of them, so I divided them in half and put half the uncooked meatballs in the freezer for another time.  Definatly a great recipes...very impressed, all I can say is DON'T BE AFRAID TO COOK THE MEATBALLS IN THE SAUCE RAW...they do cook beautifully!  Thanks for sharing!

My family is still raving about this recipe and I made for them over a month ago.  I've made this recipe and used it for eggplant and chicken parmesan, lasagna, meatball subs, and it's intended spaghetti and meatball purpose.  I made 2 modifications.  1st I only put in 2T of tomato paste rather than an entire can.  2nd I used diced tomatoes rather than whole.  The first time I made this I found that it was really acidic from the canned tomatoes, so I added 1/4t of baking soda at a time until the acidity was very mild (I think I used about 3/4t total).  Adding sugar makes the sauce sweet, but baking soda will cut the acidity without adding any sweetness.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Okay, so basically I used this recipe as a guideline, that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  With my modifications it's 5 stars folks, and easier too!  Here's where it's at:  I followed the sauce recipe pretty much exactly, but when I sauted the onion and garlic, I added 2 extra cloves of garlic and 1/2 an extra onion.  After the onions are translucent and you've added the garlic, spoon about a third out and dump them into the bread/milk mixture I'm about to tell you about. I was in a time crunch so I just cranked the heat and left the lid off and the sauce thickened up just fine in about 30ish minutes.  I revamped the meatballs completely.  Before you start the sauce, tear up 2 slices of white bread and pour about 1/4 cup of milk over them.  Let them soak while you get the onions and garlic cookin'.  After you've added the onions and garlic, add 1 tsp. each oregano and basil, 1 tsp salt and a few grinds of black pepper.   Then add the 1 lb of ground beef.  Lastly, squish it all up with your hands.  Fun.  Roll them into golf ball sized balls, and after they are all done, toss them in the sauce.  Don't freak out if you can see some chunks of bread.  It's fine, really.  Hope that's not too confusing!

Oh my god oh my god oh my god! The spaghetti sauce is I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E. I make my own marinara sauces all the time (way healthier and way better tasting than the bottled ones), and this one outshines them all! I plan on sticking to this one from now on... in lasagnas, on pizza, on pasta... amazing! Since I'm a vegetarian I don't have my own opinion on the meatballs, but my boyfriend devoured them quickly and said they tasted great... so I'm definitely giving this recipe 5 stars... and I would give the sauce 10 stars if I could! Thanks for the delicious recipe Jeremy!!!

With a few alterations, this would be a 5 star recipe.  Use two eggs for meatballs and simmer (covered) in sauce for 45-60 minutes.

If using fresh garlic cloves, 2 or 3 is plenty.  Also, increase sugar to 2 teaspoons.  I left out the onion because my son doesn't like them.

Instead of breadcrumbs I added 1 cup oatmeal to make them lighter. I also added 1 5oz can evaporated milk to make them moist. I also browned them in some olive oil first & then removed them from the pan & started the sauce. I think its too much onion in the sauce but we aren't huge onion people so next time I will cut the onion down to 1/2 cup. I just felt like the sauce was all onion. I also added oregano & some garlic salt to the sauce. I simmered all the sauce ingredients for 45 min. because I was short on time & then added the meatballs & cooked for 30 min. I think it helped to brown the meatballs so they weren't so raw going into the sauce. Overall, this is a really easy, yummy recipe & I will definatley be making it again!

Wow. I'm only rating the meatballs but mine turned out so tender by cooking them slowly with my sauce. I've never tried that before. I believe it also gave my sauce I a nice added flavor. I was worried that 30 minutes wasn't long enough to cook them through so I tried them at an hour and they were cooked through. I didn't have fresh bread crumbs so I used plain dried bread crumbs and only had half the amount called for (which was probably the correct ratio anyway). I did add a little oregano, basil and fresh garlic. They turned out perfect. The best ones I have ever made (and I married into an Italian family). Thanks for the recipe.

The sauce was great! I used garlic and herb flavored bread crumbs for added oomph and baked the remainder of the meatballs for subs the next day. I think next time I'll stick with baking all but a few of the meatballs in the oven, as I enjoyed the slightly firmer texture those had. Thank you!

These meatballs cooked in the sauce are fantastic.  They're juicy and moist and after making them this way, I will never go back to precooking.

This was my first time making my own red sauce and meatballs. I have to say that it was simple, with delicious results. I was very proud to serve the finished product. I don't know why people are making a fuss about the sugar. 1 teaspoon of sugar didn't make much of a difference in the taste. Consider that there is much more of all the other seasonings. I recommend trying the recipe the way it's presented here. It's definitley worth the risk.
There are only two of us, so there was quite a  bit left over, instead of cutting down on the recipe, we used the leftovers for meatball sandwiches! Best meatball sandwiches I have ever had!

This was my first time making spaghetti and meatballs from scratch and I was surprised by how easy it was and how delicious the sauce was!  To the meatballs, I added a few extra spices as recommended (basil, oregano, garlic, chili powder) and I used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs.  I added some tomato sauce to the spaghetti sauce and doubled the spices.  I agree with the other reviewers that cooking the meatballs in the sauce gives it SUCH a savory and delicious flavor.

There were a lot of mixed feelings about this sauce at my house. Some devoured it and others just picked at it. It's very good but it seems to be lacking something in the sense of an "old world" taste. It's worth cooking at least once though if tomato sauces aren't your forte.

My family and I love these meatballs! I had to alter the recipe as follows, but it still turned out great.

I used italian bread crumbs that I bought from the store ustead of fresh, instead of making the sauce I used a jar and a half of my favorite jar spaghetti sauce that I had on hand, and I browned the meatballs on two sides and then cooked them in my jar sauce until cooked throught. Yummy!

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews but I was so disappointed because the meatballs were too bread-y and I couldn't taste the meat at all.  I made this dish for my friends and they were not impressed at all.  This dish tastes below average, like cafeteria meatballs.  I am not cooking this again.

I was afraid to make the meatballs by using the sauce, so the first time I made this recipe, I sauteed the meatballs. They turned out great and the sauce was so good that I made it again!

But this time, I did it exactly as the recipe calls for.  OMG - GREAT!  My kids loved it, my husband loved it - there was nothing left for leftovers!!!

I will not use jar sauce again as this is so good!  I will tell you to start this early - this is not a recipe that you can make last minute and turn out right!

I would have given this recipe more stars if the recipe had included oregano from the beginning.  It's true what some of the other reviewers have said about the sauce-it is very tomato-ish, without the oregano it almost tastes like plain tomato sauce. Soooo, try adding 2- 3 teaspoons oregano (I also added 1 tbsp cilantro).  This fixed it for me.  Much better!

As for the rest of the recipe - it's really good!

This is a basic recipe and very blah.  The meatballs didn't really have any flavor, on the first bite, it tasted like biting into a round hamburger ball.  Def need ALOT more spices/herbs. As for the sauce, using whole tomatoes makes the sauce very thick and even after simmering for 90 mins, some of the tomatoes still didn't crush/dissolve, so next time save the trouble of blending and buy crush tomatoes instead.  Also the sauce was very acidic.  Using 1 teaspoon of sugar for 2 (28oz) cans of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste is not enough!!!  I cut the acidity by adding atleast 3 tablespoons of sugar and maybe 2-3 tablespoons of butter. Next time I will add more herbs to both the meatballs and sauce.

Absolutely delicious! Made this the other night for dinner and it was superb. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. I did put mine in the oven for a few minutes to cut some time then tossed them in the sauce so that they can finish cooking. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. Will definetly make again.

it was good but very tomato-ey. i know some people like that but i was expecting more flavor. the meatballs were fine, i made them about the size of half dollars and broiled them a little bit first since i didn't want to wait too long for it to cook. it was a little oily and i had to spoon that out and i even used less oil than recommended.

This is an excellent recipe. I have, however, made a few changes. I always make a double batch of the meatballs using equal parts of ground beef & sausage. I also use store bought italian breadcrumbs and use the canned diced tomatoes rather than the whole tomatoes. I've tried this recipe with both the original suggestion of cooking the meatballs in the sauce and prebaking them because my DH is squemish about all of the extra grease that is added to the food. I prefer to cook the balls in the sauce.

Absolutely easy (for meatballs) and was a huge hit at cottage dinner of 14ppl. I've made this many times, and my only suggestion is to not add the juice from the canned tomatoes right away, but only add as needed.  Otherwise it turns out very soupy.

This was my first time making sphaghetti sauce and it came out very good.  I did add some extra spices (garlic, pepper, red pepper flakes, salt)and 1 bell pepper, 1 pkg of fresh baby bella mushrooms and 1 cube of beef bullion during the process. (oh and some Vegeta..but thats the European in me)  I also used 2 (6oz) cans of tomato paste instead of one (someone else recommended that on here). I topped the  pasta/sauce with garlicky shrimp. Next time I think Ill add some oregano, red wine and extra garlic.  It is a very tasty sauce, and if I ate meat, Id probably try the meatballs too!

These meatballs are sooo deliciously good. It's the only receipe I'll use for meatballs. They are so soft, perfect for my 10 month old baby to chew. The only changes I made to the meatballs was I added half a cup of 2% milk and half an onion finely choped browned in olive oil on the skillet. The sauce is equally delicious.. it's a little hot/sharp... but I love it!! Thanks for a great meatball receipe!!

This is by far the best homemade sauce I have ever made or eaten. I have even made it without the meatballs, subbed turkey balls, spinach balls, vegies, etc. You just can't go wrong here. Add what ever you want, heat through and serve. Very good the next day as well.

I have used this recipe for years now, mainly making just the meatballs, and adding them to my own sauce, or to make meatball subs, sweet n sour meatballs and even BBQ meatballs, they are really delish. I do add 1/4- 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to the meat mixture.
Thanks for your  recipe Jeremy.

This is a great sauce recipe. Easy to make, great taste, just like most of the other reviews - i'll make again & again. I just added a little red wine & 2 small cans of tomato paste (in stead of 1) to thicken. Great stuff   - thanks for posting.

Excellent!!! I took a suggestion of another cook and added a little milk to the meatballs which made them moist. I didn't have parmesan cheese in a can, so I added the real shredded cheese to the meatball mixture. I believe I was able to cut down the cooking (simmering) time by 30 minutes because we were so hungry and it turned out great. We WILL be making this again. YUM!

Delicious!  I used two eggs as other reviewers suggested, and I also added a little onion powder and Italian seasoning.  I made these with half ground beef and half pork, and they came out great.  Will make again.

This was a good sauce, lots of pure and simple flavor without a huge list of ingredients. This is not at all like the sauce in a jar! My hubby loved this one and asked me to fix this one every single week. Next time I am going to start the sauce cooking sooner and give it another thirty min to an hour to simmer. I added about 1/8 tsp of onion powder to the meatballs, otherwise followed as directed. This is just good home cookin'. I served this with homemade focaccia bread. Thanks Jeremy, this is one of our favorites!!!

This recipe was an absolute hit with my whole family..something that doesn't happen very often!!  The first time I made it, one of my sons ate 5 of the meatballs before I even served dinner.  Therefore, I now double the meatball part of the recipe. The only change was that I added 1 1/2 cups of breadcrumbs, instead of 2 cups, to the 2 pounds of ground sirloin.  I use petite diced tomatoes and double the amount of chopped onions.  One time I sauteed sliced mushrooms with the onions and the sauce was also fabulous.  Today, I used a hand blender to partially puree the sauce.  I add on an extra 15 minutes of cooking time for the meatballs.  This is such a great recipe, you can "tweak" it any way you like and it still comes out GREAT!!  Thanks so much!! This is definitely a keeper!!  Better than our favorite Italian restaurant!!

My family loves these meatballs! I have this meatball recipe on my fridge and I make it once a week, although it's so simple I could make it by memory now! I use jarred pasta sauce and cook the raw meatballs right in the sauce for about thirty minutes. I also make my meatballs half the size and they are still plenty big. These are also very good to make the night before and store in the refridgerator. These are not too dry by the recipe (at least not when I make them, lol) and the taste is amazing!

This was good I used two eggs and 3 tablesponns of milk in the meatball mixture to tenderize the meat. I used crushed tomatoes and only let the bay leaf simmer for 30 min then removed it.

These meatballs were good.  It was little soft (even after adding extra 1/4c of bread crumbs) and bland for my taste.  Next time, I will add more bread crumbs, some salt and/or more grated Parmesan cheese, and perhaps fresh minced garlic for more garlic flavor.  Thanks for the good recipe.

I have made my own spaghetti sauce for years.  Did the simmer for 8 hours the whole bit.  I was in a rush and thought this recipe looked interesting and my husband liked it better than mine.  I was afraid of all the garlic so used 3 cloves instead of 5 but next time will try 4 just to get a little more garlic taste.  It's so easy to make and I think it's terrific.  I now have more time when making spaghetti sauce

I thought this was an outstanding recipe.  My husband said that he could "drink" the sauce it is so good.  Like another person, I added tons more garlic.  I used a head of garlic.  I disagree with the other person who claimed it was not as good as other marinaras.  I have made many other marinaras and this one was not only easy, it had complex flavors due to the longer simmering time.  Thanks Jeremy for this recipe.  I will make no other spaghetti and meatballs but yours.

Beat recipe on this site. I’ve made it so many times I just absolutely love it over jar sauce. It is time consuming in a sense so I do make a double batch to help for future use. I freeze the rest in quart size bags. I do make the meatballs fresh each time. I’ve done a few versions of this after following the recipe the first time. This is what I do. Extra garlic. Half crushed tomatoes half diced tomatoes. One can of tomato paste per double batch. Add salt at the end so I can add more if needed. Use what I need for dinner and just cool off and freeze remainder in quart size bags. I’m only a family of 2 adults and a 5 year old so I have plenty of sauce for future uses. We eat either spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant Parmesan, chicken Parmesan, or lasagna every week or 2, so saving 2 hours each time is worth it. I can’t say enough about how good this recipe is.

This was delicious! I actually make my sauce and meatballs almost identical to this recipe except I always bake the meatballs first, then add them to the sauce. I made this recipe exactly as written (which is how I believe recipes should be reviewed. If you change it then you are reviewing your recipe). I left the meatballs simmering in the sauce a little longer just because I wasn't ready to eat. I'm sure they would have been ready in the time suggested in the recipe. The meatballs absorbed the flavors of the sauce. They are much better this way. No need to brown or precook. This is my go to recipe from now on!

This was REALLY GOOD!  I adjusted a bit using one 28 ounce can of tomato sauce and one 28 ounce can of whole tomatoes, and also used 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning in the meatballs (vs parsley). I put Italian seasoning in the sauce too. I put in the crock pot on high for a few hours and then turned to low.  I did feel like the whole tomatoes were still too chunky so I did puree them in my Ninja blender.  This was SO DELICIOUS! Very easy and definitely go-to spaghetti and meatballs recipe for the future!

I love this recipe! My whole family loves it as well :) the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was delish, but I had lots of sauce and no more meatballs. Now I double the meatball recipe and roll up about 18 slightly larger meatballs, it works great and I don't have to change the sauce recipe at all.  Makes enough for a family of 5 with some leftovers that way.  Oh and I usually use crushed tomatoes instead of whole bc the store I always shop in never has whole tomatoes and it's slightly better with whole but still super yummy with the crushed. Enjoy it!

This is my second review for this recipe and once again, I give it 5 stars.  I'm adding another review today because I read through a ton of reviews today before starting and was surprised by a few.  I cannot believe the people that said that this dish is bland, be it the meatballs or the sauce.  This dish is so flavorful!  And I love, love, love the way my house smells while its cooking!  Those that think it's bland or just tastes like tomatoes are obviously doing something wrong or their ingredients are poor quality.  It's also possible that they're not cooking for the full amount of time.  Today, I made this dish exactly as the recipe is written, no changes AT ALL. It is time consuming but worth every minute.  My husband and both of my kids, 14 and 7 say that this is the best spaghetti and meatballs that they have ever had.

Hubby requested spaghetti and meatballs one night and I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Success!!!!!  I ran low on parsley so did not put very much in the meatballs but it still turned out delishous.  I did baked the meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but will probably try just putting them in the sauce to cook the next time I make this just to see what the difference is.

We loved this, we have sophisticated pallets and are not sure why there were so many saying it needed so many changes. I simmered meatballs in the sauce, I only changed two things using fresh parsley not dried and half beef half ground pork.(tip to others about dry meatballs the recipe calls for fresh not dry bread crumbs so just cut into small pieces or thru a mini chopper, if you are using dry you must soak about half the amount in milk with fat). On the sauce I added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper because we like heat and I used San Marzano tomatoes. Perfect!

THE BEST SAUCE I'VE EVER MADE! This is my 1st time leaving a review (although I've been on this site for many years- I HAD to review this one!)Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you- it's wonderful! I used ground turkey (all I had on hand at the time) so I omitted the breadcrumbs and upped the Parmesan cheese to 2Tbsp. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. No need to precook the meatballs- cooking them inside the sauce is what I believe makes this sauce so delicious. I will Never use another recipe- and that says a lot because I'm always switching things up here and there-but don't mess with perfection once you find it! Thank you Jeremy!
Update: I forgot to add that before I put my meatballs into the sauce to cook for the final 30 minutes I pull out the bay leaves and then  I drop an immersion blender into the pot and blend it into a completely smooth consistency- it's a personal preference- my family likes a smooth sauce and it blends all the flavors together so nicely.

I found this recipe to be very tasty.  I omitted the salt and used "no salt added" tomatoes for a healthier sauce. You can't tell that the salt is missing.  I also used fresh parsley instead of dried, I think it has better flavor, and added some Pecorino Romano and Parmesan about a Tablespoon or so of each. Since I had already made meatballs and had them frozen, I just added them to the sauce to defrost and heat up. This is now my favorite sauce, when I make it I make enough to freeze for later and it tastes even better after it has been frozen.
This one is a keeper! Even my husband loves it.

Love this recipe and have cooked this several times now!  Huge hit with husband and kids.  The only changes I made were I used Italian sausage instead of lean ground beef and I add fennel seeds, Italian seasoning and extra garlic powder to the sauce for extra flavor!

I looooove this meatball recipe!  I followed the meatball recipe exactly as it was written.  Because I wanted larger meatballs, I changed the serving from 6 servings to 9 servings so that I can use 3 pounds of beef.  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to measure out my meat portions so that they could cook uniformly--which brought it to 11 giant balls.  For the sauce, I used a ready-made sauce due to time and added some extra ingredients to make it my own.  Overall, the meatballs came our tender and flavorful.  This will be my go-to recipe for meatballs from now on!

Unfortunately, his recipe didn't work for me at all. The sauce burned and the meatballs disintegrated into the sauce while somehow remaining raw... I must have done something wrong because with so many glowing reviews it's hard to imagine that other people had the same problem.

This was a huge disappointment! The meatballs were not completely done despite being in the sauce for more than the two hours (it was closer to three!). We didn't find this out, however, until the food was on the plate and we were eating (should have cut one open - my mistake!). I had to heat both plates in the microwave to finish cooking the meat. 

The sauce was okay, but really needed a little more kick to it. Not sure what it needed, but just didn't do it for either one of us. Won't be trying this one again.

Very good with some slight alterations.  Pre-cooked the meatballs for 15 min at 425 to seal in flavor and brown the outsides.  For extra gooeyness, added 1/4 c. shredded mozzarella cheese to meatballs and used refrigerated garlic.  For sauce, sauteed garlic (refrigerated) and 1.5 small onions in 2 T. olive oil.  Added 2 large cans of crushed tomatoes, 2 cans tomato paste (we like really thick sauce!) and 2 bay leaves.  Let simmer for 90 minutes total at low heat.  YUMMY!

My four star rating is based on the accuracy of the recipe. Follow the instructions and it'll turn out pretty good. One thing I would say is that the meatballs were horribly bland. To fix it simply, add 1 tsp of salt to the meatball mixture. To fix it the best, use another meatball recipe. I've made a few tomato sauce based recipes, and one tip I can give is when using whole canned tomatoes, pulse them in the blender to smooth them out before putting them into the sauce, or put them through a food sieve. Without this step, you'll find huge chunks of tomato in your sauce which make it difficult and unpleasant to eat.
 Also, be sure to remove the bay leaves before serving, these become papery or leathery when cooked, and are unpleasant to eat.

Delish!  I probably simmered the sauce for more than two hours, and I used "Meatball Nirvana" recipe on this site instead.  Super good.  Warning:  Will probably result in food coma.

sauce was AMAZING! (I only changed two little bitty things...added 1/4 cup red wine and like 1/4 t red pepper flakes....oh yeah...and I slightly browned the meatballs before adding to suace "aka GRAVY, according to my Itailian firend who said I should brown the meatballs just a tad).  I got her two thumbs up, so I am waaaay happy! (ps...I used meatball recipe form this site called "meatball Nirvana")

Excellent sauce recipe.  The only change I made was to add 3 tbsp of chili sauce to sweeten it up a bit.  The sauce is very thick.

I've tied many recipes for spaghetti sauce but none of them come close to this one. It is definitely my "go to" spaghetti sauce. I typically have to double or triple   the servings because my family and friends love this!

I've made this a couple times and it's been pretty good.  Use crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes though- I prefer not to eat large chunks of tomato in my sauce!

I found this recipe to be a disappointment.   Essentially you are boiling the beef.   That makes for a firm and chewy , somewhat bland meatball.   I prefer to brown meatballs thoroughly in a frypan first,  and then simmer them for a few minutes before serving.   Also adding a lot a of oregano and some dijon mustard increases the flavors immensely.

I LOVE these meatballs! I do make them a little differently now just to cut time: I use Italian bread crumbs that has all the spices already, then I add a little milk as was suggested to keep the meatballs from drying. Instead of making the large meatballs, I just roll them into smaller meatballs, bake them in the oven at 350 for about 10- 12 minutes then throw them in with my own spaghetti sauce. They taste just as good and my husband loves them!

I added the meatballs without browning and they browned nicely and were rated as very tasty by the family.  I only substituted for things I didn't have and am looking forward to doing this in the slow cooker.

A really great sauce and a tasty meatball. I usually don't follow a pasta sauce recipe as written and always tweak it here or there.  This time I even measured and I'm glad I did.  A keeper for sure. Thanks.

I was surprised the meatballs cooked well in the sauce, without browning first. The sauce is good. There just wasn't enough sauce for us! I'll probably add a bit of water next time.

The meatballs were fantastic! Unfortunately, the sauce was a bit too thick and acidic. It was like eating the tomato paste directly from the can with onions added in. We ended up mixing in an entire jar of Newman's spaghetti sauce.

I really loved this sauce!! It had SO much flavor!  I'll be honest though, I wasn't overly impressed with the meatballs but that is just my opinion. I did a few things differently, which could have caused them to taste different (like forgetting the Parmesan cheese lol...). For one I browned the meatballs in a skillet, then deglazed it with a little brandy and put that into the sauce. In addition, rather than using two 28 oz cans of whole tomatoes I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes (with garlic, basil, and oregano), and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I also added a bit more seasoning than it called for, as well as oregano, parsley, and onion and garlic powders. 
For the meatballs, I was planning to add half pork, half ground beef but they were out of pork at the store. I ended up cutting open a bratwurst and putting that in, but it didn't make much of a difference. Maybe I'd add some Italian sausage or something next time. I want to close this review by saying, this sauce is awesome!!! I would definitely make it again!

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt @ spaghetti & meatballs for my husband's birthday. Only variations were: NO white sugar or bread crumbs, and I used a blend of ground pork & ground beef, AND added red wine to the sauce while cooking.  It was EXCELLENT and very easy!

This recipe was really good but needed a few things to make it great.  I added sausage spice seasoning (from Penzys) to the meatballs which made them delicious- about a tsp.  Also, the sauce needed some Italian seasoning and more garlic to give it a kick.  All in all quite yumm!

I absolutely love this recipe! Like others, I was concerned the meatballs would not cook through because the recipe did not call for browning them first, but they were perfect.  I make batches of the sauce often and freeze it.  It's perfect to use over spaghetti, lasagna and even as pizza sauce (yummy!).  The only modifications I made were using 2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled and omitting the parsley.  I also blended the 2 cans of crushed tomatoes to get rid of any large chunks because I have some picky eaters in my household.

I used this recipe strictly for the meatballs - I used turkey instead of beef. I added them to a jar of spaghetti sauce and let them simmer for 1 1/2 hours. The fiance and I loved it! Will be making it again.

I liked the meatballs alot but the sauce seemed too "tomatoey" to me. And I suppose it would with the cans of whole tomatoes and tomato paste added to it. I did have to substitute smashed up crackers for the bread crumbs. I liked it but will probably look for a different recipe for sauce next time I make spaghetti.

Didn't make the meatballs but followed the recipe for sauce exactly, just halved it. I always surprise myself when i make something really good because I'm a terrible cook, even with a recipe, I have issues. This was super yummy! I added a splash of balsamic vinegar in at the end (I saw Jamie Oliver do that once), and added in prepared turkey meatballs from Trader Joes about 20 minutes before it was done. Fabulous super easy recipe.

Delicious sauce and meatballs.  I'm not a big spaghetti fan because I hate the store bought sauces.  After making this homemade sauce, I've become a fan of spaghetti again.  My family enjoyed this recipe too.  Definitely a keeper!

I would give this a 3.5. I made modifications and added extra flavoring (more garlic, more seasonings in the sauce, more parm. cheese in the meatballs) but it still fell a little flat.  The meatballs really lacked flavor, but the sauce was good. I used 1.5 tablespoons of sugar and it was still too acidic tasting, so I might do 2 tablespoons next time. I also added 1 pack of mushrooms, 2 red bell peppers, and 1 green pepper. Next time I will add carrot to make it sweeter.

Easy and DELICIOUS! It was my first time to make homemade sauce and meatballs (because my boyfriend refuses to use store bought sauce) and I couldn't be happier with the result!
I made just a few slight modifications to the original recipe: I used half a pound of hamburger and half a pound of Italian sausage for the meatballs, I added about half a teaspoon of oregano to the meatball mixture, and I browned the meatballs in a skillet before putting them in the sauce (I prefer that texture, plus I wanted to drain the grease/fat off also).
I started preparing at 11:30am, and once it was done I just let it simmer for hours. Excellent recipe!!

The best meatballs I've ever made!  I haven't had a chance to try the sauce yet, but the meatballs are delicious. I pan fry them since my husband likes them to be crispy on the outside.  I've taken to dropping two or three into my store-bought sauce while it heats up, which adds a nice flavor to the sauce.  I can't wait to give the sauce a try, I'm sure it's delicous!

The meatballs were good although I decided to simmer an extra 10 minutes to make sure they were thoroughly cooked.  The sauce I thought was a little thin so next time I'll add more paste.  With 30 minutes left I broke up the whole tomatoes because I'm more of a fan of tomato chunks.

Well, it looks like we're definitely in the minority on this one.  Both Hubs and I thought this was really bland.  I even tried to improve it by adding a tuscan italian seasoning and additional basil.  Sorry, but we won't be trying this one again.

This is great.  Only minor changes was the addition of a 1/2 cup red wine and some fresh oregano.  I did not have tomato paste and the sauce and meatballs were wonderful. Don't be afraid to cook the meatballs in the sauce!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Was a very bland sauce.  Tasted like canned tomatoes.  I am sure it serves as a good base, but will still be looking for a better recipe.

We LOVED this recipe. Served it to company and they asked for the recipe. Both the meatballs and the sauce were excellent. I made only the slightest variations; I made a triple batch and used 2 pounds of lean (93 percent) ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork.  Also, I didn't have bread for fresh crumbs, so I just used seasoned panko. I did cut the bread crumbs in half since I was serving some diabetics who are carb conscious, and the meatballs were still outstanding. Also, I made mine in the crockpot so I didn't saute the garlic and onion ahead of time - I added it fresh in the crockpot and bypassed the olive oil and the sauce was perfect.  For Newbie - it's two 28-ounce cans, for a total of 56 ounces.

What can I say that hasn't already been said by over 1,000 reviews!  I've made this many, many times after finding it on this site.  A few changes that I've made: add milk to the meatball mixture, it'll make them more flavorful and lots of fresh basil.  I try to make this the night before so the flavors have time to "set."  Use any extra meatballs with a little sauce for meatball subs too!

Very good! I omitted the breadcrumbs and just made the meatballs bigger. I will add additional seasonings to the meatballs as they were a little bland for me. The sauce was great and easy to make. I will never buy bottled sauce again!

Fantastic. This was my first spaghetti sauce. I tweaked a bit because it wasn't sweet enough for me, plus I wanted a little extra spice. I used 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning and 1/4 tsp basil. I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper, 1/2 tsp sugar, and half a can of tomato soup. I pureed the tomatoes as well, for a smoother sauce. I simmered for about 3 hours on low. I found the sauce to be a bit too rich and chunky so I added 1/4 cup water and pureed in the blender. The meatballs were good but I had to add another egg and leave out some of the bread crumbs.

The sauce was great! As suggested by others, I used one can of whole tomatoes and two smaller cans of diced tomatoes. I was disappointed with the meatballs though. I will definitely decrease the amount of breadcrumbs next time, that was all I could taste. I also increased the parmesan to 4 oz in the meatballs but the breadcrumbs were so overwelming, I'm not sure if it made a difference.

Great meatballs.  I didn't use the sauce but instead added a honey garlic sauce to them after I baked them.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I made some out of fresh hot dog buns.  I also added fresh garlic and a few tablespoons of full fat milk.  Baked on parchment in my toaster oven at 300 degrees for 30 minutes, then added to the honey garlic rib sauce I was simmering on the stove, just for about 5 minutes.  Served with homemade mac & cheese and sliced cucumbers.

I rarely make meatballs because mine never turn out right. They are always too dry or over cooked. I used only the meatball portion of the recipe and they came out great! I was worried about not precooking them, but they were fully cooked and moist!

Anybody who doesn't like this recipe obviously did not do it right! I made a few small changes, such as using a combination of diced and stewed tomatoes, added some italian seasoning to the sauce, used a combination of ground beef and ground turkey, soaked italian bread crumbs in milk for the meatballs instead of using fresh bread crumbs, and baked the meatballs in the oven as I didn't want it to be greasy (who can afford lean ground beef these days), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out fantastic and my family absolutely devoured it. I made a double batch but barely had enough leftover for meatball subs the next day. We will never go back to the bottled sauce again!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  This recipe tastes like an authentic Italian restaurant meal.  I made this for the first time and my husband cannot stop raving about this.  The only changes I made was that I used a combination of beef, pork and veal and added 1 1/2 eggs for moister meatballs.  I am sodium restricted and used 4 cans (14.5 oz) of petite cuts no salt added and added 2 bay leaves.   I baked the meatballs for 10 minutes at 350 and turned them over and baked for another 10 minutes and then added them to the sauce.  They were even better the next day I found it hard not to have them for breakfast.  Thank you Jeremy for making my first time making meatballs and sauce a total hit with my family.  This is a keeper and is top of the list.

Rating the meatballs only. I make my own sauce which is almost identical to the sauce with this. I will use this recipe again, but less bread crumbs. I may add onion or raisins just to give it a little variety. I have always cooked my meatballs in the oven. This is way easier and less messy! Thanks for the recipe!

We used a whole lg. onion and still didn't that much oil -- a couple of tbsps is plenty.  Used a combo of whole peeled, italian stewed and diced tomatoes for more of a medium texture. Needed more sugar to cut the acidity and more basil PLUS oregano.  Mushrooms would be a good addn., as would a little bellpepper.  If you don't have fresh breadcrumbs, be sure to use less than the full cup called for, or your meatballs will be dry/crumbly.  Added a little italian seasoning to the meatballs too.  All in all -- good as written, but you may need a few tweaks on the seasonings to get it just right for you.

I recently made this for a family gathering and got many compliments. A couple of people even said these were the best meatballs they had ever had. The only changes that I made were to add some more herbs.
I added basil and oregano to the meatballs.  Then added extra basil, oregano, and some Cavender's Greek seasoning to the sauce. 
Served with salad and some Rosemary Olive Oil bread. Yummy!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was great!  I read way too many reviews that said the meatballs were bland, so I decided ahead of time to use 1/3 pound of ground beef, 1/3 pound pork breakfast sausage, and 1/3 pound ground venison instead of only using ground beef.  No blandness there!  The meatballs were full of flavor!  If you don't like or don't have venison, you could use 1/3 pound ground turkey too.

This recipe is Italian restaurant quality! I couldn't get enough of it--so glad there were leftovers! The only thing I would probably do different the next time would be to cook the meatballs before adding them to the sauce. Putting them in the sauce raw puts too much grease in the sauce, even using 90% lean ground beef. I will definitely make this over and over again, as even my picky eaters loved it!

I recently made this and found the meatballs to be cooked perfectly and good taste. My only issue was the last 30 minutes the sauce began to burn and stick to the pan. The taste was great but the consistency a bit thick for my taste.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't made the sauce, but the meatballs were simple and delicious.  I was skeptical about not precooking them, but really it was perfect.  I just used jarred sauce and simmered for the time that was called for in the recipe.  My husband (a bit of a meatball addict and former restaurant cook) loved these!!!

Wow! So flavorful. I have always made my own spaghetti sauce but this combination just clicked. Like others, I was skeptical of cooking my meatballs right in the sauce. I kept thinking of all that grease released from the beef, floating around in the sauce. To ease my mind a bit I used ground sirloin which is leaner than ground round or chuck. I've learned my lesson about changing up a recipe before I have even tried it. I now make new recipes the way they were intended to be made, unless it's an ingredient I really don't like. Having said that, I did make one tiny change that didn't affect the flavor. I added about 1/3 of a cup of milk to the meatballs. Next time I will add a few more spices and garlic to the meatballs, but this is great as is. Thank you Jeremy.

Excellent! I used crushed tomatoes and did add more spices (oregano, italian blend and cayenne). I baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes then added to the sauce and simmered for another 15 minutes.

I'm rating this for the sauce only.  It was delicious!  I doubled the garlic thinking I was doubling the recipe, but discovered that the recipe took 2 cans of tomatoes.  By that time it was to late. I also used an immersion blender to make a finer sauce.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing Jeremy!

This is amazing!! I didn't have ground beef so I used 1/2lb of ground turkey and 1/2lb of spicy italian sausage. I mixed the two meats together and used the same measurements for the rest of the meatball ingredients. This was the first time I had made meatballs and my husband loved them.  The sauce was great. I added an extra 14oz can of tomatoes and used a mixture of diced and stewed tomatoes as that was what I had on hand. We had company over when I made this and I have never had people rant and rave about my cooking until this dish. I am now going to make this be my specialty for when we have company over.

I'd rate this at 4 1/2 stars. My family loved it! The only problem was that I didn't let my pasta cook long enough so it threw the meal off to me. :-( I'd make this again.

WOW! so easy and delicious!  I used 1/2 pound hot italian pork sausage with 1/2 pound hamburger and wow were the meatballs tasty.  The sauce is so fresh!  I recommend using crused tomatos instead of whole, just easier.

I pretty much made as written.  But I didnt have any paste.  The tomatoes were pretty chunky for my kids so I did run those threw my little processor and that did the trick.  My tomatoes werent plain either, they were Italian.  I dont recall making sauce before, so this was great!  I put the meatballs in as instructed.  They were yumm-o too!  Oh, they weren't fresh breadcrumbs, they were Italian so I didn't add the dried parsley.  Thanks for sharing!

The meatballs were wonderful but the sauce I felt needed a lot more flavor, I ended up adding more basil, oregano, salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! I did change a lot, per reviewer’s recommendations and necessity. For the sauce- Used 1 (28 oz) can of crushed tomatoes with Italian style seasoning, 1 (28 oz) can of tomato puree, added ¼ bunch parsley sprigs and scooped them out, added italian seasoning, left out the bay leaf, and added a bit of red wine. For the meatballs- added Italian seasoning, used Unikass Robusto cheese from Whole Foods (all I had at hand) instead of parm (and I doubled the amount), and used ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs. I also used hot sausage and ground beef. Lots of changes, but delicious!

This was good, I added 1/2 cup of diced onions, 1 cup of diced green bell pepper. I cut the garlic back to 4 cloves and I added 16 oz of sliced mushrooms during the last 20 minutes. I think next time I may add a can of tomato sauce as the sauce seemed a little thin.I added dice onion and about a teaspoon of hamburger grill seasoning to meatballs.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this. It might take a couple of hours, but there isn't a lot of work involved. I followed the recipe as is, only subbing mozzarella cheese for the parm as we prefer it. Definitely will make this again!

I took a gamble and made this for a dinner party...it was great! I received many compliments and I noticed many went back for seconds and thirds (but who's counting!) Thank you Jeremy for a terrific recipe.

Nothing to say..except..OUTSTANDING!! Just made this for dinner tonight. I have an allergy to eggs, so I just browned ground beef with the onion and garlic and then followed the recipe for the sauce exactly as written. I will never buy sauce in a jar again..you have upped my standards too high haha. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

I made this recipe with no changes and it was fantastic.  The effort was truly minimal.  It took longer than a jar of store bought sauce would have taken, but that was simply because of the time allowed to simmer. it was no more difficult.  I put the meatballs directly in raw form and it came out fine.  I suspect that technique may have added flavor to the sauce, but who knows, I'd have to ask a chef master about that.  I just know everything came out perfectly following the recipe to a T.  Very well received, clean plates and seconds and high praise.  of course, i deferred the praise to this simple recipe.    Happy cooking!

Delicious!!!  I've made this 3 times now, each time, it just gets better and better!  The first time, I followed it to the T, but baked the meatballs instead of frying them.  The last 2x, I used grounded venison instead.  Venison tends to lack flavour so I added a lot of spices and herbs.  Also, the last time I made this, I made venison burger patties and then pan-fried them.  I enjoyed this recipe every time I made it. :)  Definitely a winner and something that I will use again and again in the future!

I give this a 2 1/2 stars.  I just expected more given the reviews.  I should've known, having 2 cans of whole tomatoes in it - it was very tomatoey.  I was hoping for more of a thick blended sauce, but this is a chunky tomato sauce and I don't care for whole tomatoes.  As another reviewer mentioned, you can break up the tomatoes after it simmers.  The meatballs, also, eh, just average, nothing special.  I would call this a good basic recipe.

I'm not sure why this recipe got a high rating.  The sauce wasn't that great.  The meat balls were stiff and weren't juciy at all.  I follwed the recipe to the tee.  Just didn't like it.

This was excellent!  I don't understand how anyone's meatballs were bland or dry unless they didn't follow directions.  I followed the recipe and everything was great!  If you change a recipe and it isn't perfect, don't give it a low rating, it's not the submitters fault!

This is delightfull. Lick bowl worthy. I am in love.  I did not have bread crumbs (I usually crush stale bread with a rolling pin) so I toasted bread and crumbled it.  To the meat balls I added cyanne pepper and hot sauce because i like it spicy. I also made the meatballs smaller, a bit smaller then a gold ball. Because they were smaller i added them in the last (about) 22 minutes instead of 30.   To the sauce I added dried basil and oregano.   I served over thin whole wheat spaghetti.  All so amazing and easy. Left overs are very good too.

Holllleeeyyy  these meatballs are good! I used a bit less Italian breadcrumbs, fresh garlic (I despise garlic powder), and added fresh chopped basil and oregano. Oh my, these are tender, flavorful and delicious.  I dare say the best meatball and sauce I have had. Sorry mom.

I've used this recipe for a few years now.  The only thing I do differently is after all the sauce ingredients come together, I transfer it to a crock pot so that my sauce doesn't scorch in the pot on the stove.  The meatballs are the absolute best!!!!

YUM YUM YUM....the ONLY suggestion I have is to add a packet of dry onion soup mix and 1/2 cup of milk to the meatball mixture--it adds a great flavor and a little moisture.  But it's still a five-star recipe without my suggestion!

Great recipe!  I added beef stock since the sauce seemed really thick and mied Jimmy Dean sage Sausage to the ground beef (half sausage/half ground beef), bread crumb, egg, and seasoning mix. My whole house smelled wonderful and the kids were excited because they helped make the meatballs!  I did not pre-cook the meatballs, just dropeed them in when the sauce was simmering.  This is my third time making this and the recipe is consistently good.  Definitely gives restaraunt spaghetti and meatballs a run for their money!

I have never made meatballs before and but these are so easy and so flavourful.  My only change was more parmesan in the meatballs and I served them with wholewheat spagetti.  Most definitely a keeper.

the meatballs are delicious! I used ground chuck instead of ground beef (because it was cheaper) and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Since I didn't make the sauce, I cooked them in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes. I then used them to make meatballs subs, with a hoagie roll, Parmesan Ricotta pasta sauce, and provolone cheese. DELICIOUS!

Wow, this is great. I don't usually eat meatballs, but I ate these and loved them. The sauce was the best, I will never buy another jar sauce again. The hubby says I need to pat myself on the back for this one. He LOVES meatballs. I'm about to make it again but for meatball grinders!

Thank you for the great recipe! I prepared exactly as you wrote it and the sauce and meatballs were delicious.  My sister even went for seconds (hardly ever does that) and didn't put any extra grated cheese over it (always does this).

This recipe is perfect with meatball nirvana recipe from this site. Add a little extra salt to the meatballs but it makes this recipe over the top good! I make this about every two weeks - I used to make it as directed but now I throw everything into the Crock Pot right at the beginning, I cook on low 6-8 hours. It turns out great and my Italian husband absolutely loves it! This sauce is better than you can buy and less expensive too!

I made this for dinner this evening and it turned out FANTASTIC!!!!  I have been looking for a spaghetti sauce and meatball recipe for my keeper collection and I have found it.  I modified the recipe a bit.  I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes and tomato paste.  I also didn't have 90 minutes to simmer the sauce and it still tasted great after only 30 minutes.  For the meatballs, Instead of cooking them in the sauce, I baked them on a cookie sheet, covered with foil, at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  I got approximately 20 out of the recipe.  Can't wait for leftovers for lunch!!!  YUMMY!

I made the sauce exactly as mentioned and it was beautiful. I tweaked the meatball recipe, and cooked it in the oven and added them in with the basil, pepper and tomato paste. This recipe is amazing, it also provides a great base for tomato based pasta sauces.

I made a much larger recipe.  With 3 lbs. ground beef & 1 lb. italian sausage, I made 150 golf ball sized meatballs.   I simmered it all afternoon; my guests could smell it cooking outside the front door.  It's a very easy & really tasty recipe.

Fabulous!  I will admit a change or two...  First of all for the sauce, I used 3 cloves of garlic and will next time use more like 1 1/2...  next, I changed the tomatoes around some.  I used a 28 oz can of Tomatoes (ended up chopping them up - could've used diced) and a 28 oz can of tomato sauce - I left out the sugar and bay leaf totally (too sweet for me).  For the meatballs, I used 1 1/2 #'s of a meatloaf mix of ground beef, ground veal and ground pork.  I used Ritz crackers (3/4 cup) instead of bread crumbs  and about 1/3 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix ~ no garlic powder needed.   I cooked the sauce at 2 hours, then added the meatballs and 6 oz can of tomato paste, 12 oz tomato sauce and black pepper.  The meatballs cooked about another 1 1/2 hours or a little more...  Served over the little pasta 'nests', spinach w/cucumber and tomato salad and fresh Italian bread.  Served with a Sterling 2002 Merlot... absolutely magnificant!!!  Spectcular Dinner...  with a simple modification to this recipe... can't wait to taste the leftovers...  OMG - the best I've ever made

Great recipe! I would give the meatballs alone 5 stars; the sauce 3 because it was bland.   To make it 5-star, I added more spices and seasonings to the sauce as it was cooking. (crushed red pepper and basil and oregano) I also cooked the meatballs in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes before adding them to the sauce; otherwise it was much too greasy.   Delicious!

Great homemade recipe. Used more garlic and onion than called for. If you don't want possible tomato chunks, you may wanna use diced or crushed tomatos. Used more tomato paste cause I don't like my sauces thin or runny. Meatballs were excellent. Used Italian bread crumbs. Also seasoned to taste while sauce was cooking.

Even though I used a lean ground beef, cooking the meatballs totally in the sauce made it very greasy.  I think this could be helped by not using the entire quarter cup of oil that the recipe calls for to sautee the onions, and by the using the leanest possible beef, or perhaps ground turkey or chicken instead.  Also, I thought the sauce needed some more flavor.

I have made numerous "from scratch" tomato sauces and quite a few meatballs and was hoping to find another keeper. I was disapointed with the lack of flavor in the sauce (in spite of using home grown tomatoes) as well as the texture of the sauce (too runny). The meatballs were tasteless - actually would have been tastier to sprinkle ground beef on top of the spaghetti. Perhaps there needs to be salt added to the meatballs before cooking? Or maybe adding more parmesan cheese would help.

Look no further!  This is a fantastic, flavorful Italian sauce.  I made the meatballs, which I lightly browned before adding to the sauce,  smaller to go further and added 1 T. dried Italian seasonings, increased the Parmesan to 3 T., and also partially pureed (in the Cuisinart) the tomatoes. A family hit!!!

The sauce was outstanding!  I used 1 - 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes & 2 - 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes that I ran through my food processor first to more or less puree them.  I left all the other measurements for the sauce the same.  The meatballs were okay...I found them to be a little dry.  Maybe from too many bread crumbs added.  I did up the parmesan cheese and garlic powder a little.  I will definitely use this recipe again and try to alter the meatballs a little.  Thanks!

I never made homemade sauce before this and I have been wanting to make my own for awhile now. This was an absolute hit. Im now making it a second time in a two week period, because it came out sooo good  and I cook for a household of picky eaters. I love how simple it is too. Did not change a thing...just strained some of the fat from the meatballs while it was cooking with a large spoon. Thanks for a great recipie that I feel comfortable experamenting with in the future too! UPDATE: Just so you know, I am always being bugged to make this sauce whenever I cook something requireing sauce. Still a huge hit!

This was an amazing sauce! It is very flexible and can be added to or altered to fit individual tastes but the basic recipe is still 5-star. I used whole tomatoes but then crushed them with a potato masher. I added some fresh zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms with everything, simmered for about 45 minutes, then added the meatballs and simmered for another 30 minutes. I did puree some of the sauce to thicken the consistency (the zucchini made it a little watery) and served with parmesan and some fresh basil. Delicious!

A little time-consuming but well worth it!  Great sauce! I loved the meatballs. We doubled the parmesan since we're cheese lovers.  I used diced tomatoes instead.  I doubt we'll ever go back to sauce in a jar.  There's simply no comparison.

I started with the sauce first, let it simmer while i made the meatballs. then just threw the toonie-size meat ball in the sauce for 40 minutes. turned out beautiful! Everyone loved it.I also used just 1 can of crushed tomatoes, added my own seasoning choices near the end. A must try.

My house smelled so good!!!  I used very lean organic ground beef and diced tomatoes instead of whole ones the second time I made this, which just seemed like less fuss to me...  I did use an immersion blender to smooth out the sauce a bit before adding the meatballs.

This recipe turned out very well. I took another user's comment to add 1/2 cup of milk, water or sauce to the meatballs when using ground turkey, otherwise the meatballs will be too dry. The only problem I had was the cooking time. It took much longer for the meatballs to cook with the added liquid. Next time I will brown the meatballs a little before adding to the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

this is a wonderful base recipe. i've made this several times now and tweaked it to my liking. in the sauce i added more chopped garlic, red wine, crushed tomatoes (intead of whole), oregano, fresh parsley and as another user suggested, a pinch of baking soda.  i used half ground meat and added half italian sausage in the meatballs, as well as fresh garlic and parsley, and a slpash of  milk.  this is now one of my family's favorites.  ps...this recipe makes enough red gravy to freeze and used it later on for a delicious chicken parmesan!

This recipe was excellent by itself, and looks like a good starting point for personalization, both as a single dish and also using the meatballs and the sauce seperately.

This was a super easy and delicious recipe. Two recommendations: 1. Next time I will use WAY less salt, it was very salty and I ended up having to put some water in the sauce near the end of the cooking process (this also helped because alot of the sauce evaporated and I did not overcook). 2. I put alot of extra seasoning in to spice it up a little - a pinch more garlic, some cayenne pepper, extra black pepper and some dried cilantro. I really think this improved it dramatically. Overall a great recipe to impress friends with who are wanting a good home cooked meal.

Like some others I was hesitant to put raw meat in my sauce...but it turned out fantastic. I made a few changes based on some of the other reviews. I used 2 slices of bread that were soaked in milk then blended them. Sounds weird if you have not made meatballs before but trust me it makes all the difference! I also added a packet of Lawry's seasoning for spaghetti to the sauce. When my boyfriend came home after the sauce had been cooking he said it smelt just like an Italian restaurant. I had to remove the meatballs and add another can of tomato paste (i was afraid of messing up the balls by stirring in the paste) This is time consuming but WELL WORTH IT! Next time I will do the meatballs the night before put the sauce in the crock pot and let it simmer ALL DAY so we can have a wonderful meal on a week night! Do add soggy milk bread to your meatballs, it adds moisture and gives an amazing texture!

I give this 4 1/2 stars.  It was very tasty.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked it in my crockpot all day.  I couldn't wait to taste it.  I used petite diced tomatoes and they were just the right texture.  I think next time I will add finely chopped carrots in with the onion and garlic. I think this would give the sauce a little more sweetness.  I will definitely try this again.  It would even be a good one for company.

I started this after 7 on a week night so I had to take a few shortcuts.  I followed the recipe up to and including the onions and garlic and then for the sauce I used a jar of marinara, a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added 2 tblsp of italian seasoning then added the meatballs and simmered for about 45 minutes.  This was very flavorful and my husband loved it.  I was put off by adding the raw meatballs to the sauce but its so good so I will be doing that from now on.  Next time I will do it the long way....on a weekend!

I enjoyed this recipe, but used my crock pot and browned my meatballs first.I would use tomato purree next time as the sauce was somewhat pulpy for my taste.But all in all I will make this again, Meatballs were great...

I thought this was great but the meatballs did not stay together. Next time I'll definitely saute them first to brown them up and then let it simmer in the sauce a whole lot longer to flavor the sauce more.

I was hesitant on how to rate this recipe.  For the time that I put into ccoking the recipe I have to say I was disappointed.  Too salty!!  Although the meatballs were ok, we were not blown away by them.  We will not try this one again.

I'm rating the meatballs only, as I did not make the sauce.  They were ok.  They needed a LOT more seasonings.  I had to add 1 chopped onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, bread crumbs out of crackers, more parm cheese, seasoned salt, meat seasoning, italian seasonings...  This was a good base recipe, but for my tastes, needed tweaking.  Update:  I used my leftover meatballs to make subs last night.  Reheated the meatballs while toasting some hoagie rolls that I buttered and put some garlic powder on.  Then I hollowed out slightly, cut the meatballs in half and loaded up the sandwiches.  I topped with lots of mozzarella cheese and threw back in the oven until melted and bubbly.  Very very very good use of leftovers!

Good stuff - no changes needed! I was nervous about NOT making all the changes recommended by others but it was very good. I must confess to browning my meatballs a bit before adding to the sauce. Maybe next time I'll be brave enought to toss 'em in uncooked. I did remove some of the sauce before serving to puree and use for kids who do not like chuncky stuff in their sauce. Even worlds pickiest 8 yr old liked it!

I thought the sauce was so yummy. I will definitely make again. As for the meatballs, I wasn't a big fan. My husband liked them though. They were really moist which was great. I also cooked this in the crockpot. I cooked the sauce for 4 1/2 hours on low then added the meatballs for 2 more hours. The meatballs just tasted like they needed something more. I think next time I will add some sausage to them. I really loved the sauce though. It tastes tomatoey which that was what I wanted.

This was absolutely delicious and very easy to tailor to our specific food preferences (lots of garlic and spicey). I was also able to increase the recipe with ease, my husband stuffs himself when he likes something. He loved this, i'm glad I doubled the recipe.

This recipe is TERRIFIC!!!!! I doubled the recipe and the only thing I did different was to brown 1 extra pound of ground meat because I like to have meat in my sauce. My husband and kids raved on dinner and my husband is even taking leftovers in his lunch. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

UPDATE: I did make the huge batch for meatball grinders for the Superbowl party. They disappeared! I made the meatball a week before, froze them and finished the recipe the day before. Just warmed it in a crock pot to warm in the morning and transered to a chafing dish to serve. Easy! --- This was fabulous! I was concerned about cooking the meatballs in the sauce but if you don't, you will miss the true value of this recipe submission. The spice aspect seemed flexible; add what appeals to you. I liked this so much I am going to make a huge batch for Superbowl and use it for meatball grinders.

Outstanding! I love spaghetti but since my favorite sauce was discontinued, I needed a new one (and I'm picky). This is it! It's delicious even without the meatballs (although I made it with.) 
A time saving tip...
I got the sauce started to thepoint where it needed to "simmer for 90 minutes" then made the meatballs and put them into a 9x13 baking pan and baked them for 25 mins at 350 degrees, turning them once. By the time they were done, I blended 3 cups of the sauce in a blender and added it back to the pot. I just added the meatballs in and they were wonderful! Plenty of compliments without the 2+ hours. Delicious!! Thank you!!

I didn't want to hassle with making meatballs, so just used some sweet ground Italian sausage.  Crumbled and browned that with the onions and garlic.  Simmered for almost two hours after that.  Quite tasty.   Update- tried it again, making the meatballs this time.  Very good.  Almost needed a little more liquid in the sauce.  Might add some broth or wine next time to thin it a little.

I loved this recipe. I wasn't sure about adding the raw meatballs since I'd always either pan fried or baked mine, but these came out perfect without a bit of grease. Just be careful when you first add them--fold them into the sauce, don't stir very hard or they will break up. I used the fresh bread crumbs and I did take one reviewer's advice and added a half cup of liquid (I used tomato sauce) and the meatballs were perfect. I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole so the sauce only had to cook for about 45 minutes before adding the meat. I also added about half a cup of parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce just before adding the meatballs. It did take a bit longer for the meatballs to cook, but that could be because I used a blend of ground beef, ground pork and fresh Italian sausage. (about a third pound of each). I was actually just looking for a good home made sauce, and the meatballs were a pleasant bonus. This will be my standard sauce from now on.

I made this and I "definitely", loved it. I usually don't follow a recipe when I make mine but I "definitely" will again with this winner. I did however add an egg to the meatball mixture..Great recipe.

If you are not using lean beef or pork in the meatballs, it is wise to brown the meatballs to render some of the fat from them that can be a considerable amount that is hard to extract from a thick sauce. 
Concerning Parmesan Cheese...Parmesan is the French trans for Parmigiano and the trade name is protected in the European Union, PDO (protected designation of origin) but not other countries where there are poor imitations of the Parmigiani-Reggiano called Parmesan

Sorry, I followed this recipe to the T. The sauce was bland and way too "tomatoey". The meatballs had no taste and the texture tasted like mush. I read alot of the reviews and was quite confused. I let it sit in the refriderator overnight thinking it would taste better, but it didn't. Will defineately look elsewhere.

This is a perfect recipe with the modifications suggested by newlywedws.  The sauce comes out fabulous.  I put all of the sauce in the blender to smooth out.  My kids just aren't into chunky sauces. Color and taste were perfect.

5/10/10 update. made this again exactly as written and it is fabulous! it really does not need modification.

The meatballs were great; however, there wasn't near enough sauce.  I added 3/4 cp. water and 1 jar store bought spaghetti sauce to stretch it.

This is the best spaghetti I have ever had... I make the meatballs frequently, don't change a thing except I use ground turkey... makes the best meatball sub!  Very authentic Italian taste... just like my grandmas,  that we could never recreate.. this is sooo close!

This recipe was really delicious.  We used ground turkey and added an extra egg and it turned out well -not too dry.  The meatballs cooked the whole way through in a half hour although we were worried they wouldn't.  We'll make this again!

This was very good.  My husband and kids really liked it.  It took awhile because of the cooking time, but was easy and worth the wait.  I did have to make a few changes.  I added more garlic (because we love it) than called for and did not use a bay leaf because I didn't have one.  I substituted with a small amount of oregano and basil (just a pinch of each, not measured).  I also used diced tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce because I did not have the whole peeled tomatoes or tomato paste.  I did only simmer the sauce for an hour before adding the meatballs because we were all hungry and didn't want to wait an hour and a half.  The only change I would make next time would be to use 1 tsp salt instead of 2 tsp because it was a little salty.

I like using a mixture of equal parts of ground pork and ground sirloin. The pork increases the flavor incredibly. Then brown the meatballs in very hot olive oil on all sides before putting them in the simmering sauce for the last 2-3 hours. As for the sauce, omit the 1 tsp sugar and add 1-2 cups of a good port wine. That will give you all the sweetness you want. (A tip from my great great grandmother's Sicilian recipe.)

I only made the meatballs, so this is not for the sauce.  They were very good.  I did use packaged bread crumbs.  I only used about 1/2 cup.  They were seasoned.  I also omitted the cheese and used fresh parsley since I had it.  They were very good.  My 4 year old loved them and so did my picky husband.  Update:  The sauce is ok.  I have made better.  This is the recipe I still use for my meatballs though.

My daughter can't eat milk products, so I didn't put in the parmesan cheese and it still tasted great.  I would use less oil since it was a bit greasy, but otherwise it was perfect.

WARNING! Don't use sauce from the jar, I think thats why this came out so bad. The meatballs were okay, but after simmering for 45 minutes (I was nervous about the meatballs cooking thoroughly) the sauce was really watery and oily. It was definitely from the fat in the meatballs. If the recipe was followed, it might not have been like this. Only a few reviews I saw mentioned the oily issue. Good luck...but I won't be making it again. I'll stick with baking them.

Yum!  My family of 6 said that this tasted like they were in a restaurant. I have never made sauce from scratch and this was fabulous.  I takes a long time to simmer but it is easy.  I made this with soft garlic breadsticks also from this sight.  Both were amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed recipe except for 2 small changes - In the meatballs, I added 1/2 tsp. salt and used saltine crackers in place of bread crumbs.  

This is a good recipe.  We usually prefer a thicker sauce, but I will make this again when we're in the mood for something a little different.  

Save yourself some time - the meatballs do not need to be browned before adding!

My husband loves this recipe.  He brags to his friends about how "my wife makes the best spaghetti!".  Sometimes, if i get impatient I'll put the sauce in a blender to break up the tomatoes since we like smooth, non-chunky sauce, and it turns out great too. Delicious!!

I made this sauce and meatballs according to the recipe and it is a good recipe but I think it works as a really good base to add to.  We loved the meatballs so I did not change those the second time around. My second time I sautéed green peppers with the onion and garlic.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I added a lot more spices like oregano, parsley, a little more basil and some garlic powder. I like a sweeter sauce so I added a little more sugar. Overall this is a good start to add to.

I don't mean to be a party pooper because the recipe got such good ratings- and maybe I did something wrong, but I did not care much for this recipe. The meatballs were really good, but the suace had a really weird aftertaste. I think that if I were to make it again, I would just get store bought spaghetti sauce. That would save time too.

I used this recipe just for the meatballs. I used Ground Turkey and added about 1/2 c. finely chopped onions. I was little pressed for time, so I broiled the meatballs (5 mins each side) before adding them to my own marinara. I can't wait to taste them the next day after they've been soaking in the sauce!

excellent recipe!  this is the first time my husband wants to bring a batch for his parents to try!
i made some modifications based on previous reviews, and also because i have celiac disease and need my meals to be gluten free.

meatballs:
added 1/4 tsp basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme and onion powder; used fresh garlic and fresh onions; used gluten free bread that i blended to make 1 cup of crumbs; added 1/2 c milk; doubled parmesan.
-still needed some flavor.  however, since the sauce is sooo flavorful, it was a good balance so i wouldn't change anything.

sauce:
added 1 tsp basil, 2 1/2 tsp oregano

the meatballs cooked through after 30 minutes and i did not bake them beforehand.  

really great recipe!

This is by far the best best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made and I am known to have tried quite a few.. I used crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes in the place of the whole tomatoes, I also added green peppers and orgeno.I made this Last night and it was all gone and now the family is making me promise to make it again this week.

This was so good and easy! I made the meatballs ahead of time an just threw them in when it was time. Be sure to buy very lean ground beef as it can make the sauce slightly greasy. Just think of all the grease on the pan when you bake meatballs and then think of it in the sauce. I am giving it 4 stars because it was delicious and simple to make if you subtract the time it took to strain a lot of fat off the top of the sauce.

I was so dissapointed in this recipe concidering its RAVE reviews. My husband who eats anything would not eat anything but the meatballs.  The sauce was SO bland like we squeezed tomatoes on our pasta.  the meatballs were nothing great either. Concidering it took 2 hours to make i will definately not make again...

I thought the meatballs were way too bread-y.  I just made my traditional sauce, so no comment on it.  I would recommend cutting the bread crumbs to 1/2 or 3/4 of a cup at most.

My first review set!

Excellent; I comined this delicious sounding recipe with Anne Enyons "Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs" since the recipes sounded almost identical.  The difference is where I added the extra items from Annes recipe-- like celery (1stalk diced), 1 bell pepper (diced), onion, garlic clove & salt/pepper (in meatballs).

The only things I changed are: 
(1) an extra can of diced tomatoes-- it looked like too little sauce for all the xtra meatballs I accidentally made; (2) used 1 clove garlic and 1 chopped onion in the meatballs as Anne's recipe notes; (3) I used more sugar (just a little over 1/2 tsp sugar), and more salt to the sauce 2tsp; (4) I added xtra stuff to the sauce at the "sautee" stage: 1/2 jalepeno pepper diced, whole small red pepper diced, small can of sliced mushrooms, and the celery/bell pepper noted above; (5) I omitted the milk in the meatballs b/c it sounded weird; but may try it next time.

Overall, excellent recipe! Also, fairly easy to make.  

(Note, this is my first time making spaghetti from scratch since a junior in late 90's).

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!! I wasn't sure it would taste good with so little ingredients in the sauce, but it was AMAZING!  I ended up sauteeing the garlic and onion and putting the rest of the recipe with the sautee in my crockpot.  I set it on high for 3 hours and in the last 1.5 hours I added the basil and tomato paste.  We don't like super chunky sauce, so I took the big chunks of tomatoes and put them in my blender.  Definitely added milk to the meatballs and baked them before putting them in the sauce.  Used fresh pasta and viola!  it was delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

With an Italian mother, I know good meatballs, and these were rather bland. I suggest that 1/2 veal and 1/2 Italian sausage be substituted. Also, used a cup of fresh parsley chopped with fresh garlic and about 1/2 cup of grated cheese and at least 4 eggs and gently roll. The sauce was OK...I wouldn't call this recipe "Italian".

I only made the sauce part of this recipe because I make my meatballs from Jenn's out of this world spaghetti and meatballs (from this site).  I have to say that the sauce tastes great and is so easy to make.  I am going to be making this my standard spaghetti and lasagna sauce from now on!  Thanks for sharing:)

I didn't use the sauce recipe, only the meatball.
I modified it to serve 100 for a boys summer camp.
I baked the meatballs because I was working with such a large amount, when I tasted one after baking them I was unimpressed, but when I put them into the sauce...WOW!
I received many compliments!
Thanks for sharing a great & easy recipe!

My family really enjoyed these meatballs.  I used Italian bread crumbs and I baked the meatballs for 20 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees and then added them to the sauce for a few more minutes.  Like another reviewer, the meatballs may have tasted like it had too much bread, but I think the next time I make this recipe I'll add chopped garlic and other spices to make the taste of the meatballs stronger.

We love good spaghetti sauce. Both of us pleased with results. We simmered the sauce in crockpot several hours, then added meatballs uncooked for a couple hours. Only concern, a fair amount of grease in sauce. A leaner ground beef and a little tweeking and it's a winner!

I really enjoyed this sauce I've made it a few times.  I have even tried diced and stewed tomatoes...its still great!-I make my own meatballs...same way as this recipe though I just add cold water to the mix and definately cook them in the sauce every time for a soft meatball.  Be careful of what type of meat you use, Sirloin will make the meatballs harder (they're still good) and chuck will make them softer.

I'm not a big spaghetti fan, but I find myself craving it after having made this recipe a couple times now.  The taste is fresh, the sauce is thick, and the meatballs are just perfect.  My only change was to use two cans of crushed tomatos because my daughter doesn't like a chunkier sauce.  With crushed tomatoes it comes out thick and hearty.  Meatballs need no prior cooking or browning, just plunk them in the sauce and they cook to perfection.  This is now a once a week family favorite!

Awesome!  Used the butcher's blend of pork, veal and ground beef I found at the market for the meatballs instead of straight ground beef.  Also didn't add the tomato paste to get more of an al fresco taste to the sauce.  Everyone loved it!  Even my fiance who is Italian.

This was the best spahetti sauce and meatballs recipe I've ever had.  My fiance loved it and he's a tough critic.  The only changes I made:  I browned the meatballs in olive oil before adding to the sauce and I went ahead and put all the ingredients in the sauce at one time.  We actually made Meatball sandwhichs with the leftovers - yummy!

I'm giving this 5 stars on the faith that I know this sauce would be excellent because the meatballs in the recipe were the best I've ever had.  I was looking for a good meatball recipe and came across this one.  I would have made the sauce but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand that I needed (so I had to use jar sauce). But these meatballs were amazing.  They were so flavorful and juicy.  I had so much pasta and sauce left but not a single meatball.  Next time I will have to double the meatballs for my family.

Delicious! As recommended I used 3/4 c. breadcrumbs and also added 1/4 c. tomato juice and 1/4 c. milk to the meatballs. To the suace I added 1 c. water and used petite diced tomatoes. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of my own fear in the cooking time of the meatballs.  There is no way they could be done in 30 min. cooking in the sauce alone. I baked them for 45 min. at 325 degrees then added to the sauce for the time stated and was still uneasy about them being done. Made 18 meatballs.

I love this recipe! I have never made spaghetti and meatballs from scratch. I feel like a real Italian girl even though I am not. My boys (10-7-5) loved it and my husband said it tasted like our favorite little Italian restaurant. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I was worried about putting the raw meatballs in the sauce but it made it more flavorful. I did add fresh minced garlic and onion and homemade bread crumbs to the meatballs. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jeremy!

I took the idea of this recipe and tweaked it to my liking. I used 1 lb of 95% ground beef, 1/2 lb of italian pork sausage, 3 eggs, 3/4 C plain bread crumbs, 6 cloves of garlic finely chopped, a TON of italian seasoning and garlic powder, salt&pepper for the meatballs.  For sauce, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato paste (along with 2 tomato-paste-cans of water).  I sauteed the meatballs in a deep skillet w/ extra virgin olive oil.  Then added more garlic and onions.    Then diced tomatoes/paste.  I seasoned w/ more italian seasoning, dried basil, garlic powder, little bit of sugar, salt&pepper. If you don't like chunky sauce, use crushed tomatoes instead. I let it simmer for about 2.5 hours.  It was a huge hit with everyone!

For the amount of time this took I do not think it was worth it. The meatballs were pretty good, (a little on the dry side though) but I did not think the sauce had enough flavor. It just tasted like tomatoes and sweet. Instead of the recommended tomatoes, I used crushed. I even added alot of extra spices and it just tasted kinda bland. Don't know if I will waste time making this again. I may use the meatball portion, with a little altering.

This recipe was delicious! I made it  when I had family over for dinner. everyone commented on how great the sauce and meatballs were. However, for the sauce, I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole (because I prefer a smoother sauce) and I added gradually about 2 cups of water. I also added some italian seasoning. I will definitly use this recipe for my new Sunday sauce.

I only made the meatballs from this recipe and found them just "okay". I used two eggs to avoid dryness and even seasoned the meat with additional spices but in the end they were still a bit bland.  Maybe next time I'll use less breadcrumbs and add salt.

Only 4 stars because of some *small* changes I made. Added an extra egg to the meatballs, they seemed just a touch too dry. Added 
1 tbsp. Italian seasoning to the sauce and used Pomi brand strained tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes...my family does not like tomato chunks in their sauce. Pomi tomatoes have a nice  fresh taste to them and the sauce came out tasting fresh, with the herb taste shining through. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are simply the best meatballs I have ever had! I tried a new recipe the other day, and my whole family complained. I will never try another again, we all think these are the BEST.
The sauce is also wonderful. Thanks for sharing these recipes with us, they will become tradition for our family!

This recipe is excellent! I have made it a few times. The second time because of time for a dinner party I just made the meatballs with store bought sauce,  while everyone raved about it and how good it was. I knew that this sauce was so much better than the store bought stuff. I am very picky about my sauces since I made this.

We tried this recipe in a pinch because it looked quick and easy and the recipe rating inspired some confidence.  Unfortunately, its not like mom's.  If you're used to homemade sauce (as opposed to Ragu or Prego), you'll probably be disappointed.  Also, I highly recommend a traditional mix of ground beef, veal and pork to anybody serious about making their own meatballs.  Using only ground beef will leave you with dry meatballs, as evidenced by this recipe.

This was very good and very easy.  I did use several of the other reviewer's suggestions such as additional spices and cheese in the meatballs, added some Merlot during last hour of cooking, and I used 1/2 crushed tomatoes and 1/2 diced. I had a large group to feed so I quadrupled this and added 1 lb of browned Italian sausage to the sauce to stretch it even further.  The meatballs were good, the sauce was even better.  Thanks so much for a good recipe that we all enjoyed!

Wonderful. The Garlic was a bit much for me and I LOVE garlic id put one less 3 cloves next time. A tip though make the meatballs AFTER you have the sauce simmering. You have plenty of time in between.  Wonderful recipe moist perfect meatballs. I added about a half a cup of Merlot wine also.

This recipe was alright. The sauce had huge tomatoes in it and I just took a pair of sissors and cut them all up. I made a lot of small meatballs instead of the 12 large. There wasn't much flavor to the sauce.

Excellent!!  I did things a bit differently.  I sauteed the onion & garlic.  Meanwhile I put the whole tomatoes, paste, and sugar in the blender and just blended very lightly.  I put the sauce to the crockpot and added the onion & garlic, basil and bay leaf.  Cooked on low for a few hours and then added the meatballs and continued to cook for another hour or so.  Came out great!  Thanks!

Great! I followed the recipe and cooked the meatballs in the sauce; they turned out very soft (unlike the ones fried). To give the sauce an extra flavor, I substituted the dried basil for 2t of homemade pesto sauce. Everybody loved the meatballs and the sauce. I will definitely do it again. Thank you!!

This is my new favorite saucemeatball recipe.  I used 1/2 venison  1/2 Italian sausage for my meatballs, added some onion and Italian Herb seasoning even forgot the bread crumbs and they were great.  I rolled the meatballs in four and browned them first as others had suggested.  The sauce was really good too.  I will make this again and again.

I only made the meatballs and it was great!  I added two chopped shallots to the meat mixture, garlic powder, onion salt, seasoning salt and a dash of worchestire sauce.  I suggest you oil your hands, that way when you roll them into balls, it's not sticky.  Instead of adding the meat raw to the spaghetti sauce, I browned them first in a pan so it wouldn't fall apart in the sauce (just in case, if it did).  Tastes great, thanks!

My boyfriend says these are the best meatballs ever! I used 1 lb of ground beef and six ounces of hot sausage.  I forgot to add the cheese, so I rolled the meatballs in parmesan cheese and then browned in olive oil before adding to my own sauce.  I did not get a chance to try the sauce, but i will rate it as soon as i do.  Great recipe.  We enjoyed them so much we had them two nights in a row! Thanks-

I love this recipe.  I have made it twice already and last night I served it to guests.  They loved it just as much as my husband and I do.  I cut down on the amount of bread crumbs in the meatballs and doubled the garlic.  It was delicious!

Did not make the sauce, but did make the meatballs. Added Bob Evens sausage as part of the meat, Italian flavored bread crumbs, onion powder.  I also browned mine. They really were very good. I'm not a meatball fan so I'm giving you my hubby's review. He loved them in the sauce, ate them a few days later as a sub, and I have a small portion frozen for either a quick dinner or another sub lunch.  I will review the sauce also when I have a chance to make it. Delicious recipe and basic so it's easy to adjust it to taste.

Yum, yum, yum! I like my sauce marinara-style, so this was perfect. I also browned the meatballs before adding them to the sauce. I make alot of it for Sunday night family dinners. My husband loves to take a meatball parmesan sub for lunch the next day, if there's any leftovers! This is a winner.

This sauce turned out rather salty for my taste.  Also I used my immersion blender to puree all the sauce ingredients to make a smoother sauce.  OK but will add no salt next time.

I have to admit I cheated and just used a jar of sauce; but I did make the meatballs...WOW! I spruced them up a bit with garlic, onions, and some extra cheese.  They were great!!  I took about half the meatballs and made a gravy for them with beef consume and a bit of flour and water to make a brown sauce as I don't eat tomatoes. It too was great.  I'll definitely make them again.  These could also be used as an appetizer or on a buffet.

This is great recipe.  I would suggest maybe adding some spice to the meatballs though.  I used pre-made bread crumbs... no problem - worked like a charm.  Very good recipe.  Kudos.

I will definitely be making this sauce again.

Tried this recipe  a few times. Bake the meatballs, add more liquid to the mix. Cook the sauce at least  3 hrs. Then add m. balls.   Seasoning works better with a long slow cook. Like most recipes, play with it till you own it. This is an extremely good starting point.

Great recipe. I did it exactly as written.   The only difference was smaller meatballs.  I made 24 and before adding them, I used my ground meat chopper to break the large chunks of tomato.

Absolutely not. I made this recipe exactly as written. The meatballs were super dry and there was nothing flavorful about the sauce itself. I'm all about from scratch, but if it were between this recipe and frozen meatballs with jar sauce I'd take the latter in a heartbeat.

Made just the sauce with Chef John's meatballs, and loved the taste and convenience of it. Will definitely make again, and will try the meatball recipe too. I do have to share a tip for making meatballs that has saved my sanity! Roll the meatball 'dough' into a log (or two) and split the log into the meatballs. It's so much easier than dealing with a bowl full of raw meat!

I keep coming back to this recipe.  It's perfect in every way, except that it does take a lot of simmering time, so I can only make it on the weekends.  It is worth it though.  Just perfect with no modifications, except the ones I do out of laziness (dried breadcrumbs instead of fresh).  Yum.  Thank you!!

My mother is from Italy and makes the best sauce ever but I still can’t seem to perfect it cause she has no exact recipe for it.  Tried this and I have to say, this is as close to my moms as I’ve tasted.  I highly recommend! It was fantastic and my family loved it!!  I love garlic and onions so I added an extra garlic clove and onion.

I made it as described; it tasted very good.  Gotta love those knuckleheads who comment how they rated the recipe 4 or 5 stars AFTER they made their own changes;  so they're gonna rate themselves 5 stars for their own recipe in the comment section for another recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe. We've been making this since we found the recipe a few years ago. So much better than the junk at the stores. It may take a while to cook, but it is worth the wait. And the meatballs!?!? Hands down the best meatballs I've ever tasted. My hubby raves about them to everyone. :)

This was great. I tripled the recipe for a party. I used 2 lbs of beef and 1 lb of pork. I added more cheese to the meatballs. I blended the tomatoes in my food processor to make it smooth. I added basil and  oregano to the sauce.  I will make it again. The kids loved the meatballs!!

First time ever making spaghetti and meatballs, it turned out great but I had to leave the meatballs on low to simmer for almost 2 hours before they cooked...did others actually find that their meatballs were cooked after 30 mins?!? So here are the changes I made that would render the recipe 5 stars in my opinion, many of which I got from the lovely folk who left reviews here:
-I used fresh herbs instead of dry. On their YouTube  video they said to use a ratio of 1:3 dry herbs to fresh herbs conversion so I used 3x fresh herbs (I.e. 3 tablespoons fresh parsley etc)
-I let the meatballs simmer for 1 hour and 45 mins
-I added a teaspoon of oregano to the sauce 
-added a clove of fresh garlic in addition to the powdered garlic for the meatballs. Next time I’ll likely add 2-3 cloves.

My boyfriend was a firm believer that spaghetti was simply pouring store-bought sauce over boiled pasta. Thanks to this recipe, I have converted him to a new way of thinking.

Recipe was great, meatballs were awesome.  My grandma asked how i made them, said it reminded her of how spaghetti used to taste.  She now wants me to make enough of it to serve at the family reunion.  She is hard to please so if she loved it, it gets five stars.

This recipe was great for me and my family. Everyone loved it!
The only change that I made to the recipe to make it more gluten-free friendly was substitute the 1/3 bread crumbs for 1 & 1/3 cups of rolled oats.

This is a good basic recipe you can add to. I feel it is missing flavor, it could use some fresh basil, rosemary, parsley and onion, and garlic in the sauce.I used fresh garlic and parsley in the sauce, gluten free oats in place of bread crumbs in the meat mixture.I baked the meatballs in the oven for 20 minutes before adding to the sauce.
The meatballs were tasty but found the sauce flat.
Thank you for the recipe.

Will definitely make this again and again.  I was skeptical about cooking the meatballs in the sauce instead of frying or baking them first, but they were fully cooked and the flavor was delicious.  Bonus:  eliminating that extra step makes for less prep time and one less pan to clean.

This was awesome spaghetti and meatballs!! I was a little nervous trying it out for the first time for our Christmas dinner. Did not precook the meatballs, but prepared just as the recipe stated and they were perfect--flavorful and moist. I doubled the recipe for 6 adults and 2 grandchildren...all of the meatballs were eaten (24) and there was enough sauce left over for us 2 to have the next day. A breadcrumb tip I learned from the lady at our store's deli...put 2 slices at a time of fresh bread in a blender to create excellent bread crumbs (4 pieces total, since I doubled recipe). She actually said to toast the bread first, but I didn't and it turned out great. I did have to shake the blender a little to get the pieces to fall and blend. Definitely plan to make this again!

I made this recipe exactly as it is printed.  I thought it was good, however, my husband said it was absolutely the best spaghetti he has ever had.  He said the best thing about getting up the next day was that he knew he'd get to eat this leftover spaghetti again.  He is a bit of a foody, so I was pretty surprised he was so effusive about it.  But there you go, the best ever.  Thanks for sharing!

It is a lot of work and a little pricey but it is worth every bit of it. I have made it a few times the next time I’m going to triple the recipe and freeze what I don’t use. I never want to buy sauce again.

I made the meatballs per the recipe. Super bland. Why this recipe has so many up-votes eludes me. I wont make it again.  I didn't even try the sauce with all that sugar.

So amazing. By far the Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever made in my life. Spaghetti is always been a thing my parents fed us as kids. So it wasn't very attractive to me as an adult. But this recipe is outstanding. It has made spaghetti a wonderful thing again for me. I'm definitely keeping this in the recipe bank and making it again in the future. Thanks so much.

I loved the recipe! The only thing I tweaked was using fresh garden Roma tomatoes (since it's summer and they were available from the farmers market) and a small can of whole peeled tomatoes. Also, (as someone else posted) I was leery of putting raw meatballs into the simmer without browning them first, but it worked wonders!

Did not use the meatball part of this recipe - used Chef John's meatballs instead but sauce recipe was very close to how my Daddy taught me to make it. I had lost his recipe so was happy to find this one.

I've never made meatballs and spaghetti before. We just sat down to eat it, my husband and I, and we kept saying how delicious it was and how flavourful it was. It was the best I've ever tasted! Even better then my moms and my mothers in law (my husband said 'don't tell her yours is better then hers') So thank you thank you for this amazing recipe from YOUR mom!! Keep passing it on!!

The spaghetti sauce and meatballs made a nice dinner, with garlic bread and a salad.  I did add in a bit more seasonings to the meatballs and I think the sauce needed a bit extra as well.  Overall it was a nice recipe, but to make it a favorite, we would of liked it a bit richer and a little more flavorful.  It still is a great recipe to make.  Thank you for the recipe!

I added 32oz of chicken stock, red pepper flakes, lots of brown sugar, and some dry white wine and let it cook for a couple hours before putting the meatballs in.  My family really liked the sweet and spicy sauce.

Very good! I will definitely be making this one on a consistent basis. It does take kind of a long time as you need to let it simmer in total two hours, but worth it. I gave it four stars because I did have to add a few more spices, just a teaspoon of Italian spice and an extra half teaspoon of basil. But that's it! Delish!

Great, I find that this recipe is a good base. You always have to taste your sauce! Don't think that it's going to taste exactly the way you like it, because your tastebuds are your own. I added an extra tbsp of dried basil to the sauce, garlic powder, dried parsley and onion powder. I also added about a 1/2 tbsp of sea salt to the sauce as well and 1/4 tbsp sea salt to the meatballs. I read the reviews beforehand to make sure that I had this recipe to par! I never made spaghetti sauce from scratch before and this was fantastic! Definitely won't be purchasing those spaghetti sauce jars anymore because the ingredients for this was about the same price. I didn't sauté the meatballs beforehand, but I did put the meatballs in the sauce for 45 minutes instead of the 30 minutes presented in the recipe. They weren't dry at all! They tasted moist and smelled wonderful when I was rolling them up! 

Thank you for posting this recipe! We loved it!

I've made this many time. Each time it's delicious. I always use fresh tomatoes making sure to take this skin off. I make the meatballs smaller, and add more basil and some oregano. A definite keeper!

I made this for someone who wanted meatball subs.  I doubled the recipe for the meatballs and made them all about the circumference of a quarter.  I fried the meatballs for about 2 minutes just to get a little brown around them.  I made the regular recipe for the sauce which was plenty.  My friends loved them and could not believe I made them...cause I'm a guy...;-)

Thank you Jeremy.  I too got this recipe from my parents years ago and I've made it from memory and shared it with my children.  Now, I can actually print it out and send it to them so they don't forget how to make good, simply food that is good for you.  KUDOS to you.

Was teaching my son to cook, we picked this recipe and the meatballs are the best! So light and tender! The sauce could use more seasoning, but that was an easy fix, just added garlic, and Italian seasoning and salt. Delicious!

Used oats instead of bread crumbs 1/2 pork 1/2 ground beef.  Used two eggs and about 1/8 cup of milk.  Sautéed onions, peppers and zucchini threw them in slow cooker with two tins of tomatoes which I puréed first.  Put on high for 1 HR and then low for about 3 hrs.  Added meatballs raw and cooked for about 7 hrs in total.  M.B. Held together nicely.  Had to Doctor sauce though as need more spice.  Should have followed the exact recipe for the sauce as it was definitely needing the tomato purée or sauce.  WOULD MAKE MEATBALLS AGAIN THEY WERE NICE AND LIGHT WITH THE OATS INSTEAD OF BREADCRUMBS

I've made this recipe plenty of times, but only for the sauce.  I just made the meatballs and my husband raved!  He said they were the best he has ever had!  I will definitely will be making then again!

Yummy!  I've made this at least 10 times. It's my go to when I make sauce. The meatballs are tender and the sauce is just right. It is sweet though so if you don't like it sweet, leave out the sugar!

OK.  I'm not really a cook.  What I mean by that is that if there isn't a button on my microwave, it didn't get cooked.  Well...this recipe made me look GOOD.   Especially read the reviews - there are great suggestion!

My first time making homemade "gravy" was a success!  I love this recipe, and followed it exactly.  Hubby says it was a winner!  I would allow more time to simmer next time, as an Italian friend of mine says she simmers hers for 6+ hours.

Have made this recipe "as written" several times before reviewing, it's now my favorite.  Also I have made the meatballs with Italian breadcrumbs instead and omitted the other seasons, both types of meatballs were great.

This is by far the best sauce I've ever made. I added a teaspoon of better than bouillon-beef flavor to the sauce and used balsamic vinegar instead of the sugar. It was a big hit with family.

I followed this recipe, but I didn't have dry parsley, so I used fresh and I didn't have fresh bread crumbs, so I used packaged. This was very good!

This recipe was simple to make and absolutely delicious! I did as another reviewer had suggested by using a half pound ground beef and a half pound ground Italian sausage. I also used 28 oz diced tomatoes and 28 oz whole peeled tomatoes for the sauce. At the 90 min mark, I crushed the whole tomatoes with the back of my spoon, tearing them apart against the side of my pan. Everything else I left as is and couldn't have been happier with the results.

Next time I plan on adding more garlic and sugar. The sugar will help cut out the acidic/tart taste of the tomato. Also I think adding dried oregano and Thyme is essential! These herbs really helped with the flavor. I, like another reviewer, opted for 2 cans of crushed tomato to replace one can of the whole tomatoes, but next time I think I'll opt out of the whole tomatoes can completely. I like my sauce a bit more thick and consistent. Lastly, I will add in a pound of Italian sausage cooked and crumbled to the sauce. This WAS my first time making homemade sauce and it really helped me figure out what I'm looking for, but all in all was easy with a great flavor. I just need a bit more.

Phenomenal!!  I just made it this evening with my kids.  It was very easy to make, uses everything I already have handy,  so delicious.  I divided my meatballs in half.  Tried flouring half then put in pan with olive oil.  Then the remaining exactly how it says in the recipe.
Leave the recipe alone.  Make exactly as it says.  Beautiful.

This has to be the best spaghetti and meatball recipe I have ever made! So easy and so delicious. I must have read the recipe wrong and added the meatballs in the beginning when assembling the sauce. The meatballs ended up simmering for almost two hours in the sauce and I'll tell you they weren't any worse for it! So good! Don't know if thats what made them taste so good but I'll definately do it again. My new spaghetti recipe!

I am not much for pasta dishes but this sauce and meat balls are fantastic.  Meat balls great on a sandwich with some good fresh buns.  Add cheese and it's so yummy.  I make the meatballs and sauce all the time

This is an awesome recipe that impressed some pretty picky people!  I allowed it to simmer on the lowest heat setting for 4 hours and the flavors of the sauce and meat was just amazing!  This is my go-to from now on.  Will never buy jar sauce again!

I have botched a few batches of tomato sauce in my time. This recipe is right on. I enhance it with fresh basil, oregano,  bay leaves and some kind of flat dried pepper for a little kick. Not to Bragg,  but my gravy comes out excellent every time now. This recipe is my backbone for a delicious meal. Great with spaghetti & meatballs,  chicken parm, raviolis, you name it. Thanks.

Since I was too hungry and I didn't want to wait that long so, I precooked  the meatballs in the oven... Delicious! And I'm not an Italian cuisine lover..

The Meatballs were great! I just added some oregano and basil to the ground mix. Also a bay leaf to the sauce.

I make this often . I never cared too much for the meatballs so I know just make my preference meatballs . I also have switched from two cans of tomatoes to one and then one can of puree. I just like sauce texture better and then no paste is needed . Sauce is yum .

Followed the recipe, but added some fresh Italian parsley to the meatballs, a healthy tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the sauce. Was worried it would be too bland, and am glad I added the extra seasoning.  Braising the meatballs in the sauce was initially a weird idea to me, but it worked well.  Not spongey, and medium brown!  However, I still think I prefer the texture achieved via the traditional method of separately browning them first.  The only reason I am not giving this five stars is the addition of the tomato paste at the end.  I should have trusted my instinct and pre-cooked the sauce in a bit of oil to get rid of that canned taste.  I followed the recipe and just dumped it in...the tomato paste flavor never really went away, even after more than 30 minutes of simmering.  I added some balsamic vinegar to mask it a bit, but hubby still noticed the paste first thing.  So, with a few tweaks, this is a keeper!

Great recipe.  I add oregano to the sauce because spaghetti sauce needs oregano.  Sometimes a little rosemary too.  But I love this recipe!

This sauce was amazing. I followed the instructions as written, but used San Marzano tomatoes in the can. They cost a little more, but have amazing taste. After 9- minutes, I used am immersion blender to blend the sauce, and then added the meatballs. I used the meatballs and sauce to make meatball sandwiches for dinner, with salad and fruit. It got rave reviews from the kids and hubby. This will be in our regular rotation of meals. Next time I plan to double the recipe and freeze the sauce in containers for a quick weeknight dinner. Thanks for sharing!

This really is a good recipe for sauce and meatballs. I used dried Italian bread crumbs for the meatballs instead of regular bread. To adjust for the lack of moisture, I added about a 1/4 cup of 2% milk. I cut the parsley in half since the Italian bread crumbs had some already in it. I also added in a few shakes of onion powder, garlic salt, and upped the parm a little with some freshly grated. I really mashed the meatball mixture together to make sure the ground beef was mixed well with the other ingredients. I refrigerated the raw meatballs until it was time to add them to the sauce. Cooked the meatballs in the sauce on low for about an hour.

Made this tonight.  Perfect!  Didn't change any measurements.  The only thing I did different was make the meatballs smaller so there were more.  Loved the smell of the house while the sauce was simmering!

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the sauce was amazing, really delicious, but the meatballs were a little too "meatloafy" for my preference. Don't get me wrong, they were still great, I'd probably use less breadcrumbs next time though. Great dish!

This was a very interesting, complex sauce!  Next time, though, I think I'll definitely add more garlic, and use my immersion blender to smooth out the sauce before adding the meatballs.  Think I'll also add milk to the meatball mixture; the meatballs were good, but not super tender.  Amazing sauce though--I had seconds!

GREAT FOR HOSTING VEGANS AT A NON VEGAN DINNER!

I made the sauce completely without the meatballs, then separated out some for my vegan guests. I then added the meatballs and finished the sauce as it was meant to be. My vegan guests could eat the same meal with us and enjoy it and EVERYONE loved it! 

My only complaint is that the meatballs could use more seasoning. Next time I'll just add more of everything.

Overall this was a fantastic recipe that I will make again and again.

Great starter recipe .  I made the following changes:  with meatballs - increased Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup....used Italian bread crumbs .....added trinity seasoning to meat(includes garlic onion bell pepper and celery) used zatarans  creole seasoning instead of just pepper....added no salt Italian seasoning....half ground meat and half sweet Italian sausage.  With sauce- again trinity seasoning instead of just onion....28 oz crushed tomato....28 oz diced tomato...add can of Italian seasoned tomato sauce to final batch..added zatarans seasoning and Italian seasoning instead of just pepper...and increased sugar to 3 tsp.  Well seasoned and very tasty.  Absolutely love it!

My boyfriend is Italian and this is as close to home as he's ever felt since his move to Minnesota to be with me.  He loved this recipe but he did insist that I bake the meatballs prior to adding them to the sauce.  I use this recipe at least 3 times a month!  Thank you!!!

This was really good but also a little too soupy. It wasn't bland at all to me. When I make this again I will probably drain the tomatoes first. My husband wasn't crazy over it because of it being so soupy and also having clumps of tomatoes. I like the clumps though. I browned my meatballs a little before adding it to the sauce and they were really good!

I am having trouble rating the recipe, because as is I found the sauce to be really good, but the meatballs were flavourless and dry. For sauce I would rate 4/5 but for the meatballs I would rate it 2/5. 
I made modifications to the sauce following some advice from thedailygourmet review as well as well as some of my own modifications. The sauce went from good to amazing.


For the meatballs I used the existing recipe as a base but added a lot to it


For sauce - 
Used 2 28oz cans of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. 
Added 1 tsp of italian seasoning, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp garlic powder
Reduced salt to 1 1/3tsp of salt as I found 2 tsp way too salty (and I love salt).
I also found the original recipe too runny, so I used two cans of tomato paste. Next time I might try using tomato sauce
I also used immersion blender to purée the sauce


For Meatballs-
Used 1/2 lb lean ground beef and 1/2 lb lean ground pork
Used italian seasoned breadcrumbs.
Added 2 cloves of minced garlic
Added 1 tsp of marjoram
Increased parmesan cheese to 1 tablespoon
Added 1 tsp of salt
Increased black pepper to 1/2 tsp
Added 1/2 cup of milk. 
Next time I think I will reduce the amount of breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup as I think it is too much and then reduce the amount of milk to 1/4 cup
Browned meatballs in frying pan before adding to sauce. (Although this is a personal choice, it's the way I grew up with)
I found these meatballs having way more flavour and nice and juicy

This was a very good recipe.  I made only a couple of alterations.  I added a splash or red wine just because I don't think it is red sauce without a little red wine.  Instead of dried basil, I added Italian spice which is a blend of basil, thyme, etc.  I am not sure why a reviewer felt this recipe was overly sweet.  In fact I like my sauce a little sweeter than what this recipe called for.  The meatballs were very good.  They reminded me of the ones made by many of the Italian cooks in my hometown.  I think they always put them directly into the sauce and never browned them first.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  12/8/14  I just made this sauce again.  I used fresh herbs instead of my usual Italian blend.  I used about 2 tsp fresh oregano and 3Tbsp of fresh basil.  This really kicked up the brightness of the sauce.

I just made the meatball part. I baked them on a cookie sheet. I also used fresh parsley. My boyfriend loves them but pretty much likes anything red meat. I thought they were a bit dry even with store bought spaghetti sauce on them. They are quite large if you make the suggested # of meatballs, but we just cut them up.

Only made the sauce.It was very simple to make & I had all the ingredients. The only thing I thing I changed was I added was oregano. After dinner I froze leftover sauce in 15 oz. containers. I would recommend this recipe to a friend

Wow so good!  I was skeptical about cooking the meatballs in the sauce but now I can't imagine making it any other way.  They came out tender and oh so good, I will have to double the recipe my husband and son couldn't get enough.  Very good recipe.

My husband, Mr. "You need to spend some time with my mother so you can learn how to cook," LOVED THIS and said I need to tell his mother how I made the meatballs.  Enough said.  Well, almost. I added 1/2 lb spicy Italian sausage to the 1 lb of beef and added gobs of garlic and extra italian seasonings to the meatball mixture and sauce.  I seared the meatballs before adding to the sauce.  YUMMMMMMMMM

A few slight changes. I used about 1-1/2 pounds of meat; a half cup of seasoned bread crumbs and half cup of wheat bran (no noticeable texture difference). I forgot the Parm cheese in the balls, but no biggie. I just added it to the finished dish. I also baked the balls 30 minutes at 350, then slid them into the sauce, which I already had underway. I happened to have a half-finished bottle of red wine (!), so I added a cup to the sauce. After cooking down for the recommended time, the sauce was VERY thick, so I added a little more wine! And a small can of tomato sauce. ;-) My dad, who is a gravy fiend, LOVED it. Easy, quick and delicious - my three favorite ingredients!

This spaghetti sauce was fabulous!! I didn't have enough canned tomatoes for the sauce so I add in a can of tomato sauce and I didn't have fresh garlic so I used more garlic powder. I added extra Parmesan cheese to the meatballs. I will definitely be making this again even my 3 yr old loved it!!!!

I thought the flavor was fantastic but my meatballs didn't look cooked through so I kept cutting them in half and again and again. So that increased the cooking time by another 30 minutes. I'll absolutely try this again but with cooking or at least browning the balls before I toss them in.

fantastic base to a very good tomato sauce however, try adding a beef stock cube to the sauce and some fresh basil leaves instead of dry ones. also add chicken stock powder to the meatballs... adds so much to the flavour of them.

We found this recipe a few years back and it is the only sauce recipe we use!  It is just fine the way the recipe is stated, nothing needs to be changed!  It is impossible for meatballs to be dry when they are simmering in this amazing sauce!

Yummy! First time making meatballs, and will never buy frozen again. It was a last minute decision and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, which makes this recipe even more user-friendly.
Did not try the sauce yet. But if it's as great as the meatballs, that'll be next!

Been using this as the base of my sauce for at least 5 years.  These are the things I've changed over the years.  I use one half teaspoon of fennel, two bay leaves instead of one, add a mushrooms and green pepper to onions when I sauté them, and I use the meatball nirvana recipe from this site.  If sauce looks too thick I use one half cup dry red wine.  The recipe is good as is, but with these changes it is craveable.

My 4 star rating is based on way too much gravy for just 1 lb of meatballs, and the sauce needed a little extra flavor.   I actually made 3 lbs of meatballs (1 lb. beef and 2 lbs  turkey).  I kept the proportions the same, but did add a 24 oz jar of my favorite jarred wine flavored spaghetti sauce.  Even with 3 lbs of meat there was sauce left over when the meatballs were all gone, and I was surprised at how good the meatballs turned out -- and so easy to make -- just scooped the meat with  an ice cream scooper, and dropped them in the hot sauce after rolling into balls.  Will make again.

I CANNOT COOK. Despite this, on my first day as a stay at home mom, I decided to wow my family and surprise them with a home cooked meal.  When the 3 year old requested spaghetti and meatballs, I almost cried!  I followed the recipe to the letter (though I accidentally used 2# of meat) and it was AMAZING!  I'm a spaghetti snob and found this to be the best sauce I have ever tasted!  I won't be able to order it at restaurants anymore b/c there's no way I'll enjoy it as much.  The meatballs were perfect too - I can't believe they cooked through so perfectly - even with the extra amount.  Thank you, Jeremy's mom!  I can cook!

FINALLY a recipe that tells you to cook the meatballs in the sauce! I used to frown at any recipe that tells you to brown the meatballs in a skillet or in the oven. WRONG, you lose all that beefy flavor when you do that not to mention you'd have a more flavorful sauce. I do think a few changes could be made such as adding 4 oz of cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs, a 1/3 cup of milk, half vadalia onion diced and sauteed until softened and italian herb seasoning, 1-28oz can crushed tomatoes and 2-14 oz cans diced tomatoes (italian herb). After adding everything in the pot (I used a crockpot) spoon it out and into a blender to make a smooth sauce. Drop each meatball in and let it stay for at least 1 hour before stirring (to get all that beefy flavor mixed in with the sauce) Other than adding a little more flavor the recipe overall is a great and easy way to make the perfect meatballs especially in a crockpot on low (it helps to maintain a consistent temperature and no need for constant checking)

I have never made homemade spaghetti sauce before, nor meatballs. The directions were easy to follow, and everything turned out great! SO much better than store bought sauces. My husband and stepson approved it also. I will definitely be making this again! :)

Great recipe. Didn't have bread crumbs so I blended some corn flakes and used that. I was surprised I didn't have to cook the meatballs first, but it was less work and tasted great!!!

Best Italian sauce I've ever tasted. I did add salt and onions to meatballs and sautéed them in some spray oil before. The rest I did exactly the same and I ate for 2 days in a row. My husband absolutely loved them as well.

I followed the recipe as written. The sauce was great but the meatballs were lacking flavor. I will be making this again but adjusting a few things in regard to the meatballs. I'll also make the meatballs smaller from now on because my kids thought they were too difficult to eat.

I really don't like when reviewers give 5 stars to a recipe that they have modified.  I didn't have time and made this recipe as written and wasn't pleased.  I felt the meatballs were dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor except for tomatoes and garlic.  It needed more italian flavor.  I remember my family meatballs being more fall apart tender.  I won't make this recipe again but might try one of the revisions.  I wish when rating recipes, the reviewers are asked if it was made as written or with revisions!

This was awesome! Used panko breadcrumbs because that's what I had and 1/4 cup more milk in the meatballs. I did blend the tomatoes at the end as my husband wouldn't have wanted to eat whole tomatoes. Second time I made it, I used crushed. I also browned the meatballs first and then put in the oven for about 20 - 30 min. before adding to sauce. Very easy and the whole family loved this.

I have never made a homemade spaghetti sauce before, so this was a great starter/base, very easy to make, I only added mushrooms to my sauce not sure of what I should be adding for extra flavor but now that I know what it taste like I'll be adding some extra stuff to it next time to make it a little more spicier for my family liking along with some green peppers. Meatballs turned out great, very moist I did add some worcestershire sauce to them as I do to most of my meats for a extra boost of flavor.

I made this and found the original recipe was far too acidly. Here's my own spin. I found a good bread crumb makes the most out of the meatballs as well as the amount of fat. I used croutons and ground them in my mini food processor and I used ground chuck instead.

I would recommend a 1/2 to a cup of a good red wine to the sauce. If it's good enough for you to drink, it's good enough for you to cook with. Added some oregano and a little more basil and a good pinch of koshet salt. Lastly, to get rid of the acid tomato taste, use more than the recommend teaspoon of sugar. I used believe it or not, ketchup (yes I know, rolling eyes). It was good to go then. If you can go a day, put it in the fridge and preheated the next day. The flavors blend more. Wife and I had left over meatball hoagies. The best.

Wow! Delicious! I've tried several spaghetti sauces on the Allrecipes site. This is the best by far. I made a few changes based on my family's preferences:

(1) We like really meaty sauce, so I browned and added 2 lbs of 85/15 ground beef instead of the meatballs. Before browning, I added double the amount of the parmesan cheese, black pepper, garlic powder and parsley that the orignal meatball recipe called for. I added the beef mixture to the sauce mixture after the sauce had simmered for 90 minutes. 

(2) To the sauce, I added 3-4 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning, doubled the salt and pepper, used 2 bay leaves instead of 1 and added about 1/4 cup of additional sugar. 

Great recipe. We'll definitely be preparing this one again.

BIG WINNER.
My Italian husband said it reminded him of a traditional dinner, in Southern Italy. Clean and simple, but all the flavor you crave. Will definitely make this again soon.

I grew up in NY eating amazing meatballs from grandma's kitchen (her name, Olive Vinci, should be an indicator of how authentic they were), and this recipe replicated hers almost perfectly (both the sauce and the meatballs).  I am sure that following the recipe precisely would be superb without alteration, but I insist that you should use 80/20 ground chuck (the fat makes for more moisture and flavor), and that you should very lightly brown the meatballs in a cast iron skillet with a small amount of olive oil, as I feel it not only helps bind them, gives them a better color, but also adds texture and flavor that you won't want to live without.  Don't skimp on the San Marzano tomatoes, it is a difference maker (make sure that you read the ingredients carefully, as some are deceptively labeled as San Marzona "style").  Don't search further than this recipe, as none other could  be better...this one is perfection.

Excellent recipe! Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever made. I think not baking the meatballs before putting them in the sauce made them more moist. I altered the recipe as a few others suggested, and substituted one can of whole tomatoes, one can of crushed tomatoes, one small can of sauce, and the tomato paste for the tomato ingredients as listed in the recipe. Another change I made was to cut the salt in half. Even a teaspoon seemed like a lot to me and in the future I'd try a half a teaspoon. Most canned tomatoes have plenty of salt in them, unless you are lucky and can find the low sodium kind. I also think the 1/4 cup of oil could be reduced to a two tablespoons, if desired. I will try that next time. Also, after sauteing the onions and garlic, I put all of the other ingredients together and simmered them for a bit. Then, since I didn't have enough time to simmer on the stove, I just popped everything in the crock pot on low and left it for three hours so I could go out. The meatballs were cooked and everything was delicious. Great recipe!

I use half beef, half ground pork, otherwise I follow the recipe.
This is the best homemade sauce/meatball I've ever had, and that's from a guy who has been lucky enough to come from a family who makes just about everything from scratch. I'm not talking better than Ragu and the frozen meatballs at the supermarket, I'm talking better than grandma's.
Thanks for the recipe Jeremy!

Totally off the hook!  Just made it for the family and it smells amazing through the house.  Only thing I will do different is maybe add a little less breadcrumbs.  I use a less fat ground beef and it soaked up the egg pretty quick.  I added some milk to help it out.  Baked the meatballs and added them to the sauce.  Sort of hoping there are a few meatballs left for a meatball sub! :)

I've been making this recipe for years and its still a favorite! My family begs me to make it every time I come back in town. I have altered it a bit to my taste, however, as follows: 

No onion in the sauce. I also use a combination of tomato sauce and tomato paste (always hunts) instead of the whole peeled tomatoes, this makes it more "sauce-like" and can easily be altered to the thickness you or your guests prefer. It also requires much less simmer time. I also brown my meatballs first, and then cook them at 350 for 20 min before letting them simmer in the sauce for a bit. These steps cut down the cook time immensely!

I am rating this based only on the sauce, as I had some meatballs in my freezer I had made and wanted to use up.  We all enjoyed this a lot!  Very good! I did add some Italian seasoning and some crushed red pepper. It is good as is, or easy to make your own by adding whatever herbs and spices strikes your fancy.  I will be sure to try the meatballs next time :)

I prepared meatballs and spaghetti sauce over angle hair pasta tonight too mixed reviews from my family.  Everyone loved the meatballs, but I made one change to the meatballs; I added minced onions to the recipe. So I will keep meatball recipe and try a different spaghetti sauce recipe.

Made this with 32 oz of fresh garden tomatoes and a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes.  Blanched and skinned the fresh tomatoes and used a stick blender to combine until 75% smooth.  I added a green pepper and 8oz of sliced mushrooms since I omitted the meat balls; it gave the sauce some extra body.  The only mistake I made was adding the full 2 t of salt while cooking instead of waiting until the sauce was done and adding to taste.  It does taste a bit on the salty side right now.

This was the first time i have made a homemade meatballs and spaghetti.  This recipe was great!  I added fresh pressed garlic to the meatballs and used seansoned breadcrumbs as i did not have fresh ones.  I browned meatballs in pan before placing in the sauce.  I also add some hamburger to the sauce as well to make it a meat sauce. For the sauce i added some crushed red bed... just a hint.  This recipe was so easy and so so so very yummy!!  would definitely recommend!

i found that this is a little to greasy so i will cut down on olive oil next time and precook my meatballs. It is a good base recipe and needs to be tweeked to your own taste because i found it to be bland. i put it in blender to chop up tomatoes some after it was done.

I made a few modifications to this because I wanted to do a meat sauce, not meatballs.  I also had fresh tomatoes from a friend's garden, so I peeled those and used them in place of canned.  I omitted the onion by personal preference, but did sprinkle in a bit of onion powder.  I made the sauce as directed otherwise.  In the last 30 minutes, I added the ground beef directly to the pan (had 88/12, leaner would work too) along with the parsley.  Just prior to serving I mixed in the Parmesan cheese.  After tasting, I added a little more parmesan and some romano cheese as well.

This is a great sauce recipe.  I usually use 1 can of whole tomatoes and 1 can crushed.  Then, I lightly crush the whole tomatoes while I add them to the pot.  I suggest using fresh basil and parsley if you have them on hand.

I love this, and I will never buy sauce in a jar again!  I used 90% lean ground beef, but otherwise made the recipe as stated.  I used some of the leftover sauce and meatballs the next night for ravioli, and froze the rest.  I thought the meatballs were a little bland the first night (although combined with the sauce still great), but surprisingly they tasted even better when I thawed the sauce last night.

This is a delicious recipe, I used ground pork for the meat balls...added some ground cloves because my Mother-in-law makes a wicked sauce and is Italian , I used about 1/8th of a tsp but you can play with it. Will be making this from now on.

This sauce recipe makes a great baked pasta (NO STOVE TOP COOKING REQUIRED)! I doubled the sauce recipe using 3 whole onions and food processing the tomatoes to break them down a bit. Then layered the uncooked sauce, dry penne pasta (1lb box total for all layers), sauce, penne, sauce (sprinkling a bit of cheese between layers) in a 9x11 pan.  When this recipe is doubled, there is enough sauce to completely cover all the noodles so no go dry. Cooked on 350 for 90 min tightly covered with foil... the pasta was perfectly tender and flavorful.  The sauce did all it's cooking unattended in the oven.  A great weekday entree.

Definitely 5 star. This was easy to make, did add tomato sauce, fast in preparation, and delicious for dinner, especially, next day.  Also added fresh oregano and used fresh lemon basil because  we had them from another dinner.

I like the fast version. I do cook a special occasion version that is a huge hit! The night before I cut 12 tomatoes, peel and cut up. I use fresh garlic(five cloves at least), one onion, one green pepper, lots of small red and orange peppers, the same seasonings, a dry italian red wine splash, and throw in the crock pot. I then make the meatballs with one pound of lean meat and 1/2 pound of italian sausage. I use an onion, fresh garlic, fresh peppers, fresh parmesan cheese (1/3rd cup) and the other ingredients in the recipe. I allow the meatballs to marinate in the crockpot overnight with sauce. In the morning, I cook all day on low. It's amazing,,,,,,,,,,I like to use a higher quality noodles found in the refrig section when doing the special version. Everyone eats it till they cannot walk. Sometimes you may need to add some tomato paste judging on how you like your sauce and how it is turning out. I also prefer brown sugar over white sugar. My husband likes me to add fresh mushroom to the sauce.

I only made the sauce without the meatballs. I just added ground beef to the sauce. It was the best sauce I ever made. It had a wonderful flavor. Next time I will try it with the meatballs too.

I love the meatballs in this recipe, I use it as a quick go to dinner that's delish!
Meatballs are moist & are tastey on a hoagie bun served as meatball hoagies topped with sauce & cheese.

Love this recipe. I've made this recipe a few times and have made a few minor adjustments. Sauce freezes well so I double the recipe. I use 3 cans of of crushed tomatoes and 1 of dice tomatoes. Lots of fresh basil is a must! For the meatballs I keep everything the same accept I use have ground beef and have italian sausage.

Absolutely loved this recipe, only change we made was letting it simmer for another hour or so. It makes the sauce so much richer and flavorful.

I have made this twice and my kids LOVE the meatballs!! Very easy to make, I could even make ahead in crock pot next time. Fresh herbs make all the difference. I also added fresh basil and oregano to sauce as well as parsley to meatballs. Def brown the meatballs first.

I have never rated anything before but decided to.  This recipe is delicious as follows but I also made a few changes and I have to say its my favorite sauce. My husband isn't a fan of "red" sauces but prefers alfredo but even he loved this recipe and had seconds.  It also reheats very well from the fridge or the freezer.  The adjustments I made were I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole, added 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning to the meatballs and the sauce, added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the sauce, and 1/4 cup dry white wine.  I felt like the wine really gave it more flavor and helped the meatballs from becoming dry.  I actually used some bread that was a few days old and not as "fresh" and it did not dry out at all.  I have also used ground lamb a few times instead of beef for a leaner version.

Made this again tonight and it's just so so good - if you have a Whole Foods around you I recommend buying their ground beef because it really does make a difference in a tender meatball...I even sent this to a friend in Holland and she made it and her family loved it!  I also used one can of whole tomatoes and one can of crushed tomatoes   :)

Found this recipe when I was figureing out what the heck to make for lunch. We had all the ingridients, excpet the bay leaf, but it was a smash ! I would give this recipe 5 stars but, I had to make some tweaks, which gives it 4 stars. Things I changed: Instead of putting the meatballs in right away I seasoned them with flour, seasoned salt, oregano, and basil. I set them in the oven, until I needed them for the sauce. I browned the meat balls in a sauce pan with olive oil to seal in the flavor before placing them with the sauce. I am a vegetarian, and this meal was great for my husband, and his father ( who eat meat.) Great dish, will make again !

Pretty tasty.  Although it took two hours to cook, I think the time was well worth it.  

I personally don't know if the two 28 ounce cans of whole peeled tomatoes were a bit overkill or not. But regardless, it did taste pretty good. 

Would make this again.

The meatballs I modified too much to review honestly. The sauce though is superb. Great foundation sauce recipe. My canned tomatoes already had salt so I wound up putting less salt in. Also put in just slightly less sugar to get the salt and sour and sweet to all balance well. 
The result is a sauce that is the best I've made. Just ate it cold for breakfast. So good.

Delicious!  Didn't know if the meatballs would come out dry so I added about 1/3 cup of milk.

Also, for the tomatoes I used a whole peeled tomatoes and then mashed them up as they started cooking.

The sauce is great!  My husband said that he only wants this homemade sauce from now on.  It's really super easy.  I change up my meatballs everytime I make them though!  :)

this is by far my favorite tomato sauce. everyone around here loves it with the meatballs or without. Just make a huge batch, freeze some and you are set with super delish tomato sauce for months to come. You can easily modify. Just add more of this r that to your liking. A little oregano is quite tasty.

This is the best spaghetti sauce I have ever made. 
Haven't tried the meatballs but they are probably
delicious too.  Don't have to look any further for the best spaghetti sauce recipe.  This is it!  Thank you Jeremy for sharing.

This was my first attempt at spaghetti sauce. So easy!! The only things I did different is I used Diced tomatoes instead of whole and 2 tsp of sugar instead of one. My husband really likes sweet! I cooked the suace only 30 min on stove top, then poured it over the uncooked meatballs in my crock pot. Let it simmer there for a while, until meatballs were done. Turned out great! No need to cook the meatballs first. Great flavor and very easy. Don't worry about it being a little thin. The meatballs will soak up some of the suace.

Well What can I say other than molto molto buono. I have now made this spaghetti sauce with meatballs 4 times now with our guest saying how much they loved it. And these guest are not ones to say what they don't seriously mean. It is as good if not better than most resturants would serve. And I know because I live on the coast with a lot of long time friends that are Italian, and as I said, they loved it. If I could give it 10 stars I certainly would because it deserves it.

I made this recipe as follows and had to add a ton of additional seasonings to give it any flavor at all and it still wasnt good. Not sure if i did something wrong but this was awful. i made the meatballs as the recipe said and they were just okay. They were kinda flavorless as well.

The meat was too bready I think. I  used half a pound more meat and more bread crumbs so it came out not a real meat ball.

Very good and makes a lot. We will definitely be having leftovers since its just two of us. I followed the recipe exactly. Except I used meatloaf mix (beef, veal, pork) instead of just ground beef. I also used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a can of petite diced tomatoes. Sauce turned out great and was the way I like it without being too chunky.

I was looking for a great recipe to add to my 9year old's Social Studies project poster on Italian Culture and Cuisine. There were so many awesome reviews, we rushed to the store to buy ingredients. This is the most wonderful dish I have cooked!!! We loved it. The only change was....I cut the tomatoes in half during the simmering process. Thanks for sharing Jeremy!!

The five stars is for the sauce. It was so bright and delicious. I have a meatball recipe that I love so I was not as fond as the meatballs in this recipe due to being bias. Unbelievable sauce though! The only thing I have done differently is add some red wine while it is simmering.

Good recipe. Sauce was a little bland, tasted kind of like a can. I added about a tablespoon of sugar total, and some fresh basil from the garden instead of dried basil.

I made this recipe for 40 teenage boy cross country runners!! Literally 14 quarts of sauce.  What a HIT!  My husband doesn't like whole tomatos, but he loved this too!!  It was time consuming, but absolutly worth it.  If you want to impress a crowd this certaily will do it.  I've put this in my "it's a keeper" recipe file.  I will totally make this again!!

Great sauce, cooked in crock pot used crushed tomatoes, added a few whole fresh tomatoes, and heavy cream to cut the acidity level.

I made this with the roasted garlic bread recipe I found on this site. I had high hopes that this would be really good, but it was disappointing.The meat balls were bland and the sauce was to acidy and sweet.

I thought it was pretty good. I will add a bit more spice to the meatballs. I've never actually made meatballs before, so this was a great first effort. I wasn't able to leave the sauce for the full ninety minutes, but it still turned out really well. My family ate it up!

Amazing!! I wasnt expecting it to turn out this good!

I added red pepper, mushrooms and a spicy green chili pepper and guesstimated the beef and breadcrumbs amounts, but all turned out awesome. YUM!

Fantastic recipe. The meatballs were especially great, although in hindsight I ought to have used three cans of tomatoes instead of two. Still, the girlfriend loves it, and she's a pasta connoisseur.

This was amazing!! Made the sauce and meatballs and just like everyone else I was really nervous to put the meatballs in the sauce raw, but I do believe that added the extra flavor needed! The ONLY thing I changed was I used 50 group beef and 50 italian ground sausage! I think that gave it more flavor. My husband and I loved it!

I gave this a 3 because I added my own things to make this a 5!  I stayed close to the recipe(using all items) but used brown sugar instead of white (about 3 Tbl. Spns), omitted the salt.  I browned the meatballs in a dutch oven and in the same pot I threw in finely diced mushroom, grn pepper, red pepper and fried that with the garlic/onion.  Used one can of whole/peeled tom, and about 6 romas from my garden peeled/diced.  Then added a can of tomato soup.  Added about 1 cup of tomato juice to the mix as well.  As per recipe added the tom paste at the end and then cooked the meatballs in sauce. MMMM.  Another addition was adding fresh grated parm to the meatball mixture (1/2 cup to 1 cup).  Boyfriend devoured it haha.

4 stars because I only used the sauce. Very tasty and well seasoned. I made the following changes: 1 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves, 5 tblsp of dried minced onion instead of fresh, 1 tsp of salt instead of 2, and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. This is one is going to be reused many, many times!

Great recipe!   I made this twice, using italian sausage and meatballs.  I would definitely brown the meatballs first before adding to sauce.  My friend added the raw meatballs to the sauce and it came out too greasy.  Enjoy

I didn't have two big cans of whole tomatoes so I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 14.5 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes. It was perfect! I will definitely be making this again.

This had good flavor, but next time I will add some crushed red pepper flakes to give it more kick... I added already made meatballs to the sauce since I had some on hand.

Really good recipe! Didn't have fresh bread crumbs so I used half the amount of dry. Used fresh parsley and basil. Added a little salt and cayenne and increased the amount of garlic powder to 1/4 ts.

WOW! is all i can say.. I only made the meatballs in this recipe because i found a very appealing marinara sauce elsewhere. However, these meatballs were so juicy and delicious. I did however use Italian bread crumbs and omitted the extra parsley. I fried them in a pan 1st and let them finish cooking in the oven before adding to my sauce. All and All i will refer to this meatball recipe from here on out. Thanks for sharing!

I don't review things very often, but I'm not too ashamed to say that I licked my plate clean. That sauce makes one spicy meat-a-ball.

I only made the meatballs as I didn't have the time or ingredients for the sauce. The meatballs turned out amazing. Great flavour, and simple to make. Everyone loved them! My 3 year old ate only the meatballs and left the pasta (very out of character for her.) I'm making them again tonight!

So much tastier than using sauce from a jar, and not much more difficult. Love, love, love this recipe, and my son agrees. This one's going into high rotation! One suggestion - try half the salt, then add more if needed; my son called me on making this too salty after his first bite - didn't stop him from tearing it up, though. Thanks for sharing, Jeremy!

This a a great spaghetti sauce. I used crushed tomatoes in stead of whole. I will use this sauce recipe again. Good flavor. For my meatballs I used the recipe "No-Fuss Meat Loaf" (cut it in half..12 meatballs) found on this site. Makes excellent meatballs. Try it. >^..^

The meatballs were great.  I did not try the sauce and cooked the meatballs in the oven instead but they were very very good. I did use Italian bread crumbs though instead of fresh.

I have made this recipe several times and it is by far the best Meatball/Sauce combo I have tried with no tweaking required.

Awesome! Was my first time making this from scratch. Ended up adding a second small can of paste to thicken it up.  I also decided to use my potato masher to break down the tomatoes so it wasn't so chunky. Everything was perfect. Thank you! :)

I chose this recipe because of it's simple no fuss ingredients. I made the following changes because of what I had on hand already. I used one can of crushed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes, and decided against the tomato paste. I did not use a bay leaf, and added more garlic and basil, and added a few shakes of paprika to the mix. It ended up being the best sauce I've ever had the pleasure of tasting! The meatballs I followed the recipe but added about 1/4 of a cup of cheese. I also was running short on time so I preheated the oven to 400 degrees and baked them in a shallow pan for 16 minutes or so. They turned out very nice and moist, and perfectly browned. I served them on top of the spaghetti, and my family had nothing but rave reviews! Thank you!

The meatballs were awesome but we didn't care for the sauce at all, it was too tomato'y with not enough spices.  We ended up eating the meatballs on sub rolls instead & everyone loved them.  The next day, I tasted the sauce again & it was really good.  So, I think the problem was that it tastes better the next day.  I think that most of the Italian food I have eaten are better the next day.  IMHO.  I probably will try this again, just make it a day ahead of time.

Very good! Tasted much like the sauce from Old Spaghetti Factory. I used fresh herbs and baked the meatballs prior to adding them to the sauce to cut down cooking time. Delicious with whole wheat pasta!

Very good recipe- coming from 2 Italians from Brooklyn... Way too salty though, andI followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely make it again, I would just use less salt. Thanks!!!

So, so good. I did the 80/20 beef pork ratio with this as another reviewer did. Other than that, followed the recipe. Also did alot of smashing with a hand held potato masher while cooking. Will be using this on for now on. Fantastic meal! Thanks alot for sharing!

For an interesting yet delicious add a touch of cinnamon to the sauce. It adds another dimension to it and helps bring out other flavors more.

This was the first time I cooked anything that wasn't dessert. Both the meatballs and the sauce are very easy to make. If you want more flavor in your meatballs, this recipe gives you a lot of room for customization. The reviewers that rated these as bland and flavorless must've done something wrong. I am a 24 yo graduate student, whose life is spent between books, and not recipe books, so, until I tried this recipe, I honestly thought I couldn't cook, and they came out REALLY GOOD. The sauce is very flavorful, and you can either put in chunky tomatoes or you can add the whole peeled tomatoes and put them in a blender before adding the meatballs, after the first simmer. Also, I didn't simmer the sauce for 90 minutes, I simmered it for an hour and then added the meatballs to simmer for 30 more minutes. They were cooked to perfection. Definitely this is gonna be my go to spaghetti sauce with meatballs recipe.

I only made this for the sauce recipe cause I wanted to try making homemade sauce. I made it exactly as written & thought it was good but not great. I was not a huge fan of the huge chunks of tomato in it. I simmered this for 2 hours with Italian sausages in the sauce. Next time I will add way more spices (needed a little more flavor) & will either use diced tomato of I will puree the sauce before using it.

Delicious! I mixed all the sauce ingredients and simmered in a crock pot for about an hour, then started making the meatballs.  Before putting them in the crockpot, I rolled them in flour and browned them quickly on the stove and it really locked in the flavors! I did use crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled ones because I don't like my sauce to be too chunky...I also added some extra cayenne to kick it up a notch.  Since the sauce wasn't chunky, as I imagine it would be with the whole tomatoes, I used the left overs for meatball subs! Everyone looved them with pasta but especially the subs!

I made this before and it was great.  I'm making it again!  Nothing complicated.   You can add or reduce what you want but the basic stuff is there and it's delicious.  I like to cook Italian sausage on the side and then serve it with the (Staphetti) sauce.  A little garlic bread....a glass of wine.....Oh My!!  I'm hungary!

NEW REVIEW: I'm changing the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. I decided to give this recipe another try and am I ever glad I did! I took one bite and it instantly took me back to my childhood days (sort of like the flashback the restaurant critique had in Ratatouille). These meatballs tasted just like my mom's and they were so soft and tender. I used 1/2 pork, 1/2 beef instead of all beef (that's how mom used to make them), and next time I will add a tsp of salt to the meatballs for more flavour. I think the first time I made these, I had overworked the meat resulting in the tough, dried out meatballs. This time I mixed everything just till blended. I will definitely make this again whenever I crave my mom's spaghetti and meatballs. Thanks, Jeremy! OLD REVIEW: I really had high hopes for this recipe but it turned out to be a disappointment. The listed ingredients are similiar to my mom's meatball sauce, but this didn't even come close to hers. The meatballs were bland, dry and stiff. The sauce tasted fine up until I added the tomato paste at the end, which increased the acidity level again. The high rating is very misleading and I wouldn't even consider this Italian. Sorry but I will not make again.

We loved this! I tripled the recipe for a crowd- Used 1 lb of sausage and 2lbs of ground beef. I did not want to deal with bread crumbs so I used dry stuffing mix and they were great!! Love the sauce!!
Thanks!

SO, so good!  Only changes I made were to use a tad less bread crumbs and put a cube of mozzarella in each meatball - delicious.  I also used combo of diced & crushed tomatoes, but that's the best part of this recipe...adjusts so well.  Family RAVED, so it's definitely in our regular menu rotation now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The meatballs don't need the full amount of bread crumbs the recipe calls for.  They could also use a little spicing up.  I also found this recipe way too oily.  You use a 1/4 in the sauce and then you cook the meatballs in the sauce resulting in more oil.  To saute the onions and garlic use just a tables spoon or so.

I'm rating the meatballs 4 stars because my hubby went on and on about how much he liked them. But the sauce I would only rate a 3 star. I did not like the whole tomatoes and there was something just missing with the flavor. I also added some pre-browned Italian Sweet Sausage.

I really like the sauce overall. I only wished I hadn't added as much sugar/salt as it called for. I should have started with half and gradually added more if needed because it tasted too sweet at the end.

WOW!!! I have prepared this dish for the family twice now, and each time it was a huge hit! We all loved it. So much flavor and a perfect blend of spices. Add or subtract the spiced ingredients to your families preferences. It is a smash hit and will be making this once every two weeks or so as this recipe is a family favorite. Simple and easy to make. We highly recommend it!

Mmmm, this was yummy!  I used pork/beef combo on my meatballs because it was cheaper at the store that day.  Also, I didn't read the instructions very well and threw all the sauce ingredients together for the first 90 minutes and then added only the meatballs the last half hour.  It tasted great!  The meatballs were VERY dense so I may play around with the amount of bread crumbs and see if I can get a slightly different texture.  Otherwise, they were still delicious with the sauce.  I am making this again soon!

This was amazing!!  I actually made it vegetarian and without the sugar.  To do this I added the parsley, black pepper, and garlic powder I would have added to the meatballs to the sauce after the 90 minutes of simmering.  I also added one packet of sazon seasoning.  The only difference I would make next time is to add less salt.  This is definitely going in the recipe box.  Everyone loved it.

Made just the meatballs because too busy to make sauce last night - they're terrific!  Used 1:1 sausage:hamburger; 1:2 would probably be better.  Doubled it and only used one egg - whoops! - but turned out well anyway.  Think they'd hold together better as written.

Of course with everyone else I made changes to this recipe according to my taste (more spices, putting it through the blender..) and this would have been 5 stars, but there was WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!! I had to add another can of plain unsalted tomato sauce to make it edible. Other than that, it's a good basic recipe that can be changed easily.

BEST meatball and sauce recipe I've ever made. I always struggle with homemade sauce, it just ends up tasting like tomato paste and water, never with much flavor. Cooking it for 90 minutes lets the flavors of the garlic and onion really cook into the sauce, then the meatballs give the sauce a great flavor as well.

I made it a second time and added an additional can (14 oz) of plain tomato sauce and then upped the basil and garlic a bit, because on my first go, I ended up with more meatballs than I did sauce. It worked out great. The additional 14 ounces was the perfect amount. THANKS for a great meal and a surefire staple recipe in my family!

This was amazing!  I have made it twice now, once with beef and once with turkey.  Both were fantastic but for turkey it's necessary to add water (or milk) to avoid having dry meatballs.  This is one of my faves, thanks Jeremy!

This recipe tasted like authentic sauce with meatballs! It was fantastic! I did not have dried parsely so I left that out for the meatballs and added dried oregano....I HIGHLY recommend that change!! I also used 1 can whole tomatoes and 1 can diced. At the end of cooking, I added a lot more sugar. I like my sauce a little sweet (like how Prego tastes). You can add more spices at the end to taste if you want it spicer, more sugar, basil, garlic, etc. I served this with angel hair & garlic bread. The only thing I was sad about was that I ran out of meatballs and has a lot of sauce left over. The meatballs were excellent. Thanks so much for this recipe! I can now impress with homemade sauce instead of alwasy using a jar!

Great recipe! I followed it exactly except for adding a bit more Parmesan. It came out wonderful. The meatballs were perfect and the sauce amazing. I cooked this for my mom and her boyfriend and they kept asking for more. Thank you for sharing it with us. It's definitely a keeper.

This is heaven on a plate! The only change I make is to use half ground beef and half ground sausage. Other than that, exactly as written. These freeze really well, so I always make a double batch. They are ALWAYS a hit!

A tip on making the balls: Always keep your hands moist with water, and keep the tips of your fingers and heels of your hands in contact with each other as you roll them. Perfect meat balls!

I am so happy I found this recipe.  This is the one meal that is guaranteed to get my kids eating.  Sometimes I make the meatballs, sometimes I use premade turkey meatballs and sometimes I just make a meat sauce.  I usually use 28 oz. diced tomatoes and 28 oz. tomato sauce, but have also used the whole tomatoes as well as crushed tomatoes.  But no matter what, it is a hit.  I'm making the sauce right now to use for baked mostaccioli tomorrow night.  It's probably cheaper and definitely easier to use jarred pasta sauce, but there are so many weird unnecessary ingredients.  I feel so good feeding my family a meal completely from scratch.  This is great!

so my dilemma has always to find that perfect balance in a sauce that is not to sweet and makes me say yummm - i am also a vegetarian and i am always looking for ways to find recipes that make everyone in my family happy (im alone on my own little vegetarian island). i made the sauce EXACTLY as written, the meatballs however i had to make adjustments since i don't eat meat so i substituted Vegi burger crumbles in place of the beef and i added some olive oil in the mix and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, took the time to make the "meatballs" and drop them in the pot and after the 30 minute cook time for the "meat" was done i checked the pot and my heart broke a little when i found them all seperated and not meatballish anymore - that being said, this is the best "meat" sauce i have EVER made, the flavor is perfect and i will not change a thing next except taking the time to form little fake "meatballs" AMAZING, and i will probably be making spaghetti alot more often now that i have found the perfect sauce, thanks for sharing!

Wonderful results from this dish!  The only ingredient I changed was the type of meat used.  Instead of lean beef, I used ground turkey.  I've made it a couple of times, and have never been disappointed.  Leftover meatballs are also great for homemade meatball subs!

This recipe was used for my 8 year old sons debut in the kitchen.  He rated it a 10/10 and was very proud of himself, as were we.  This is a fabulous recipe (we made enough meatballs for 3 more nights and froze them)with a wonderful clean, rich, tangy sauce that will be a regular feature in our house (we cut the sugar in half which may have contributed to the tang).  Great find, super easy and not particularly time dependant made it perfect for the first time cook.

Decent recipe.  Makes a lot, so we have some frozen for a quick meal later.  I changed the ground beef to ground turkey, but I think if I mad it again, I'd stick with the beef for a bit more flavor and better texture on the meatballs.

I didn't really have high hopes for this recipe - it just seemed too simple.  But, it was a very good recipe.  It's so easy to make I'm sure it will become a staple in our house!  I made a few slight changes.  Did 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can whole.  Added a little leftover italian sausage to the meatballs, along with some onion powder.

Great taste, very rich and tomatoey.  I loved this sauce except for it being so rich.  Most spaghetti sauces I've made would have water added while cooking a long while.  Even though, I give it 5 stars for taste.  The changes I made was:  I used 1/2 ground beef with 1/2 mild Italian sausage.  I also put more garlic powder and Parmesan in the meatballs.  12 meatballs were huge...you could easily make 18.  I also used 1/2 crushed tomatoes instead of whole.  I don't like using whole tomatoes because you have to smash them up and they tend to be tough on the stem end, so diced tomatoes is better.  I used a bit more basil and used about tsp of oregano.  Overall, a great recipe and a keeper.  I doubled this recipe so I could freeze some.   Thanks!

Best Meatballs!!  A wonderful sauce that has now become a family favorite.  I used tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes since my kids won't eat large pieces of tomatoes, but other than that this recipe is perfect as is.

Bland.  I guess I am just picky over pasta sauce.  If you're comparing this to Ragu, Prego, or some other cheap, store bought sauce, I guess it's ok.  But even after adding extra seasoning, simmering longer than called for, and letting it sit overnight, this still tasted like canned tomatoes.  Sorry.

Delish.....I added a bit more white sugar just to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. (I like my sauce a little sweet). The meatballs have terrific flavor.

This recipe is fabulous! In the sauce, I added crushed red pepper flakes for a slight kick. I would recommend simmering the meatballs for at least 30 minutes (per the instructions) to ensure the beef is thoroughly cooked.

Let me begin by saying that my husband does not like pasta. He complains every time I make it. But I love it, and need to have it every so often. I followed this recipe exactly, figuring I'd have to reheat last night's dinner when he began complaining. Instead, he LOVED it, and said I could make it again for him anytime. I was shocked, but thrilled. Delicious!

Real good. Added some oregano and basil to the meatballs and a little extra garlic. Also used half bread crumbs and half garlic croutons because I ran out. Turned out great thanks!

It was okay. I was expecting something much better. Meatballs are extremely bland, need some sprucing up. Tossed it all in the slow cooker for 12 hours. Will probably try sprucing up the sauce & meatballs next time.

This was wonderful and so easy to make! I didn't have any tomato paste, so I substituted a small can of tomato sauce instead. Very forgiving recipe. I also added 1 t of Italian Seasonings to add a bit to the flavour to the sauce and doubled the parmesan for the meatballs. Bliss! Thanks so much!

OK, I haven't actually eaten it yet, but the meatballs are totally falling apart in the sauce!  Any suggestions?  I used oats instead of breadcrumbs.

I am sorry to review that this was only so-so. The sauce was pretty good - especially since I used home-canned roma tomatoes. I agree that the instructions should read to take the lid off during first simmer. I usually make my own sauce and this one is okay but I really think this recipe is lacking oregano which is needed for a good Italian meatball.  The meatballs were not as flavourful as my usual recipe and I think that is because I usually bake them which actually adds flavour as the outside of the meat darkens.

Sauce- I was afraid this would be too "tomato-ey" with not enough spices, but it turned out good! I actually double the recipe for a family get together and did half whole tomatoes and half crushed. Next time I will do all crushed tomatoes. I was not a big fan of the large chunks of tomato. Half crushed and half diced would work well also. Either way, the flavor was good.  Meatballs- GOOD! they were lacking some flavor. I added some italian seasoning, but next time I will get even more creative. Maybe some mozzarella cheese and additional spices. I used fresh bread crumbs but may also try with oatmeal.   Overall it was a hit with the family and a good recipe! Will make again.

The sauce was delicious. I did add chopped green pepper, 1.5 tsp of oregano and 3 tsp of basil like someone else suggested. I also added 1 stalk of chopped celery. The meatballs were bland; just didn't care for the taste of them, but the sauce more than made up for that.

Flavour is good.  Easy to make.  A little on the chunky/thin side for our tastes - I'd probably add some crushed tomatoes in lieu of the canned whole toms next time.  Also should've let it simmer uncovered as per reviews.  The meatballs were REALLY good.

I'm just rating the sauce because I love another meatball recipe on this site. The sauce was very good, I did have to double the ingredients because I had alot of meatballs and sausage. Everyone enjoyed it and I will make it again.

The meatballs were AWESOME!  (I didn't make the sauce.)  I used turkey meat instead of beef.  I also added a few tweaks to the meatballs - salt and also added the Tastefully Simple "Dried tomato & Garlic Pesto Mix".

This is a great starter recipe for quick spaghetti and meatballs. If you have the time though, I would suggest a more complex recipe as the flavors are much better.  Also, the meatballs taste a bit like those prepackaged meatballs so you could probably save the time there and buy those.  The only change I would suggest is to add 2 cans of tomato paste because the first time I made this it was very watery.  I also add spices and garlic to my taste and would suggest you do the same!

Made a few minor changes:  used 1 lb ground beef plus 1/2 lb ground pork sausage that I had left over from another recipe; used 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs plus 1/2 cup fine ground oats instead of fresh bread crumbs; used 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes in the sauce (because my kids revolt at the sight of large tomatoe pieces in their sauce); made my meatballs slightly smaller and threw it in the crock pot (submerged the raw meatballs in the sauce as best I could without smashing them) - cooked on high for 1 hour and then turned down to low to let it simmer for the rest of the day.  Good stuff and makes a lot - had enough sauce and meatballs left over for meatball subs later in the week.

The meatballs... Well, they aren't balls. This turned out horribly. Everything fell apart in the pan. Thanks to this recipe, we may have to spend money we don't have on fast food. I KNEW I should have browned them... Ugh.

Made as is, except used fresh basil and a little more. I also used two eggs instead of one.

Meatballs did not meet expectations.  They were too slimy in texture.  The sauce was runny and a little bit sour.

I LOVED this recipe with my very small changes. I made the meatballs  with 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 pound mild italian sausage and doubled the garlic powderbaked them for 30min/350. (The thought of putting raw meatballs in my sauce was icky)  For the sauce, I increased sugar to taste because it cut the very acidic taste of the tomatoes. I also cut the salt in 1/2. I also added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. I added my COOKED meatballs to the sauce 15 minutes before sauce was done.  This dish was outstanding and will definitely make again.

I had every thing on hand to make this sauce.  I used left-over meatloaf instead of the meatballs.  It was so easy, and my guys loved it.  Will never buy jar sauce again.

I made this recipe today, the smell from the kitchen drove the kids mad with hunger lol, the meatballs were tender, flavoursome and juicy, the sauce was to die for. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe

Real nice recipe!  I used Muir Glen fire roast whole tomatoes, removing  the stem thingee then crushing them with my hand before adding to the pot.  Also used Muir Glen tomato paste.  For the meatballs, I did use 3/4 pound fresh ground chuck and 1/4 pound fresh ground pork tenderloin...  mixed the cubed meat with the other ingredients and then fed it through the grinder.  They were perfectly seasoned and super tender.  Served with garlic bread and casesar salad.  Yum.

This is amazing! This was my first time ever making pasta sauce and I'm glad I used this recipe.  The only thing I added was a few more spices to the pasta sauce. Otherwise, perfect!

Amazing sauce and my new family staple for pasta night.  I only used 1 tsp. salt and added some fresh basil and parsley (about a tbsp.) when I put in the meatballs and upped the parmesan and garlic powder (doubled) in the meatballs.

The flavor was there, but the saltiness of the sauce was too much!  I have to say that the meatballs themselves were great, but the 2 tsps. of salt was completely unnecessary.  I was able to dilute the sauce at the end with some water, as it was nice and thick.  I followed the directions completely, but was just dissatisfied ultimately as the salt was overbearing, in my opinion.

I'm not usually a big fan of spaghetti and meatballs, but this is very good.  As written it has too much salt for me (1493 mg sodium per serving).  I used half the olive oil and half the salt.  I added 3/4 tsp oregano and a  6 inch sprig of fresh rosemary to the sauce.  I used rosemary bread to make the bread crumbs for the meatballs.  I also substituted the whole peeled tomatoes with 1 can crushed and 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  Because I only had 1 egg for a double batch, I was wondering if the raw meat balls would hold together okay as they cooked in the sauce, but it all worked just fine with a great blend of flavors.  I'll make this again and maybe lower the salt a little more.

I would rate this 4.5, it was really good. After reading a lot of the reviews, my changes were I only used 2 tsps of tomato paste and added 1/4 cup red wine, simmer longer for wine taste to burn off. Did not have fresh breadcrumbs so used canned, more parmesan cheese and sauteed onions and fresh basil to the meatballs. Baked meatballs and italian sausage in a 350 oven for 30 mins and then added to the sauce. Also added fresh basil to the sauce, very easy and very impressive. Thank you will use this constantly.

These meatballs made me the most popular woman at the party. I made a red sauce to dip them in. I baked them on 350 for 30 min and they were moist & delicious. I used half Italian sausage half beef.

I sometimes make the whole recipe or just add meat to the sauce. I've even made the meatballs for other dishes. Either way, i almost always make it as written and everybody loves it.

Fabulous. Used oatmean in lieu of breadcrumbs. I also used a jar of spag sauce as a base and then added the extra ingrediants as a "wow" factor- sped things up and tasted great!

I never thought I could make meatballs because they would be time consuming and not too much better than purchasing, but I was wrong. These are easy and the sauce is fresh and tasty. You really don't have to brown the meatballs like others suggest. I have tried both ways and it just makes it to cumbersome to me. It is nice to have a switch from meatsauce.

If you like the taste of just tomatos then this is the recipe for you.  I even added more garlic, onions, green pepper and italian seasoning.  It was bland and tastes like eating a cooked tomato.  Dissapointing for dinner last night.  Try it and see if you like it!

This dish is insanely delicious!!!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and use half the ingredient amount as I have only 1/2 the tomato amount needed.  Since it is taking a long time to simmer, I will suggest to go with what this recipe calls for.

Didn't care for them. The meatballs were mush like an ordinary meatloaf and the spaghetti sauce were pretty basic.

This is the first time I've ever had homemade spaghetti sauce. I've always used a jar. This was amazing....incredibly easy too.  My husband went back for seconds.  I made this just as it was listed and it was 5 star quality.  Thanks Jeremy for passing along the recipe. I will never use jarred spaghetti sauce again!

As some others suggested, I used Ritz crackers put through the food processor in place of bread crumbs and crushed tomatoes instead of whole.  Also added a chopped bell pepper, oregano, thyme, and as usual do all herbs without measuring.  This was delicious and flavorful!  The meatballs were cooked through in the 30 minutes recommended, and the Ritz added a wonderful buttery element.

This is an amazing recipe! I already have an awesome meatball recipe, but this sauce is to die for! It has a nice sweet flavoring to it. I used whole tomatos and thru the cooking process the tomatos become soft enough to break up into small chunks with a utensil as soft as a spatula! Phenominal. A new family favorite - thank you for sharing! --only used 1/2 the tomato paste called for, but you can add to your liking for thickness as you go. Will add a picture soon :)

We make this recipe at least once a month.  My husband requests it frequently.  I do puree all of the ingrediants in the blender before I put them over the stove.  I also use half hamburger and half Italian sausage for the meatballs.  I make the meatballs smaller and I just let them cook in the sauce like the recipe says.  I have even made it without meatballs.  It's just a terrific sauce.

We did not like this at all. I chose this recipe because many reviewers said this was a sweet sauce but I did not find this to be sweet at all. I used crushed tomatoes because I don't like tomato chunks and the sauce was really thick and tomatoey without enough flavor. I liked the fact that the meatballs were soft but they were very bland.

So good! Will never buy jar sauce again. Fiance and all three kids cleaned their plates & came back for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly but did put the sauce in the food processer since the boyfriend doesn't like the texture of tomatoes grrrrr lol.

I wanted spicy sauce so I added red pepper flakes.  Word to the wise, a little goes a long way!  This was a great recipe and will keep it as my go to recipe for spaghetti sauce and meatballs.

I went half ground beef, half sausage and added about half a cup mozzarella to the meatballs to keep them moist - turned out amazing! Extra garlic all around and everyone asks for this recipe!

Aweome, just really good and worth the wait. Just because it's what I had on hand I used a can 14.5oz of sliced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can tomatoes w/diced green chiles and then the can of tomato paste. It turned out perfect and the meatballs were cooked just right. When you go to add the meatballs and tomato paste it looks like it's going to be too thick, but then the grease from the meatballs starts to kick in and it moistens back up. I will definitely be be making this again!

I started with this recipe and changed it up a bit to suite my needs better. The original recipe was wonderful, but I don't need the added sugar so I omitted it. I also just used Italian seasonings instead of basil. I don't really know how much I put in because I just use them to taste. My family devours this sauce. I liked the meatballs, but my family prefers ground beef cooked and then added to the sauce.  But this recipe is a winner  in our house.

Delicious meatballs. I made according to directions with the exception that I used 1/2 pound lean ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork. I did this only b/c it is what I had on hand and have made it that way ever since. Delic!

Very good sauce. Way better than a jar. Put it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high and then low for 2 hours. Browned the meatb alls before putting in the crockpot. Great!

I made this tonight and thought that 1C for a lb of ground beef was WAY too much.  They were so dry and bread-y.  I also had to add oregano and more basil to the sauce since without it, it had an odd flavor (sweet tomatoes, maybe...).  It was ok...I won't make it again and will continue my hunt for the best meatball and sauce recipe.

Awesome spaghetti sauce!!!!! TY so much. Although it was my first time ever making homemade sauce from scratch, I went through the reviews and altered it just a small bit. I used 1-28 oz can of Rienzi (sp?) peeled plum tomatoes, and 1-28 oz can of 'Hunts' tomato sauce. We're not big on chunky sauce so I tweaked it to have smaller chunks. Additionally, I didn't have any bay leaves, so unfortunately had to omit that ingredient. It was a hit with my very picky 11 yr old and I even gave some to my contractor who's remodeling my kitchen (Tuscan style ;). I used my new Paula Deen cookware and it came out perfect! We're only a family of 3, so I had extra sauce left over from the spaghetti and meatball dinner I made, but I froze the remaining portion I had and will definitely use it for other recipes requiring Italian sauce! This is a keeper and I will be making it from now on.......Kudos to the chef who created this tasty recipe!!!!!!!!!! LOVED it!! 5****

Love this recipe. Meatballs are so soft, next time I will add a little more seasoning to them for added flavor.  I made this in the crock pot, left it on low for 8 hours. I will definitely be making my sauce and meatballs from this recipe from now on.

this is by far the best meatball sauce ever. really good taste and easy to cook but i realized that you can make it better by adding some flour to the meat ball ingredients so it will have more texture.

I was very hopeful after reading other reviews of this recipe, however the end product was severely lacking flavor. My husband who eats nearly anything had to dump an extra pile of parmesan cheese on top just to make it ok; my daughter did the same thing.  Unfortunately my search for great spaghetti sauce and meat balls recipes will continue. I won’t be making this one again.

My whole family loves this recipe.  The only thing I did different was use half pork/half ground beef for the meatballs, and add more spice to the sauce.  Made extra meatballs and sauce to have in the freezer.  Took some to my ma and she said the meatballs were the best she's ever had.  Thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend requested spaghetti and meatballs because he has never tried it before (he is Japanese) so I made this recipe for him.  I read the other reviews and adjusted slightly.  For the meatballs, I used a mix of pork and ground beef, crushed croutons and real minced garlic.  I also added 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  For the sauce, I used one small onion, only 2 tbsp olive oil, crushed tomatoes instead of whole, 1 tbsp white sugar, replaced the salt with beef bouillon, and added some oregano and parsley.  I was afraid of having greasy sauce, so I baked the meatballs and added them to the sauce later.  It was so good, and my boyfriend loved it!

The taste was good but it was a little runnier then I like. I even added an extra can of tomato paste. The meatballs were excellent. I've always baked mine before putting in the sauce and the outside would get a little crunchy. Never thought to just put them in the sauce to cook. I froze the left over sauce and used it with spinach/cheese tortellini. I added 1/4 cup heavy cream to the sauce and some parmesean cheese......it was to die for!

I love this sauce!  I didn't make the meatballs, because I have a recipe for turkey meatballs that I love, but the sauce is so delicious.  I do recommend using only 1/2 a can of tomato paste and adding 1 can of tomato sauce.  I think it tastes better that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so very good!  The meatballs were some of the best I've ever made.  First, I think using fresh bread crumbs is key and cooking the meatballs in the simmering sauce added a dimension of flavor baked/fried meatballs seem to lack.  The only changes I made - based on personal preferences - was substituting one 28oz can of Tomato Puree (try Muir Glen, it's SO fresh tasting) and one 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes with basil for the two cans of whole tomatoes and added sugar only to taste.  I also cooked the sauce in my slow cooker on high and when it began to simmer, added the meatballs.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe - I've been looking for one like this for a long time!

This was a great dinner!!! I have never made my own sauce before so i was a little nervous...After reading other reviews I used one 28oz can of diced tomato and one 28oz of tomato puree and one 8oz can of tomato sauce (garlic, oregano) for some extra spice instead of the whole tomatoes and omitted the tomato paste... I baked the meatballs for 25 mins in a 350 oven then added them in the sauce the last 30 mins of simmering....In the meatballs mixture i also added 1/2 cup of milk they were very moist!!! Thanks for sharing!! definitely a keeper

I read many of the reviews and added mushrooms and many extra spices for a pizazz, but still felt this was marginal at best. I won't be making this again.

I've made this recipe three times now and it came out excellent each time.  I made mine sans meatballs and it was still pretty tasty and better than most, if not all jars I've tried.  Very easy to make and very affordable.  On my third run I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and used 1 can diced, and 1 can crushed tomatoes.  I liked the consistency much better.

The taste was wonderful.  I think you need to cook the meatballs in the sauce to really get all the flavor. I would not use more than just enough EVO to cook the onions, I poured off some oil after cooking...the meat also has some fat.  The house smelled amazing!

Super good. Used fresh parsley instead of dried. Used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh. My 2 and 5 year olds gobbled it up! My italian food lover husband also couldn't get enough!

I made this recipe with spicy italian venison sausage and it was delicious!  There's almost no need for the spaghetti because the meatballs are enough of a meal by themselves!

Good starter sauce, really bendable to add your own personal touches. I cooked my meatballs in the oven, only because I'm a big squeamish about cooking raw meat in sauce. I'd make this again, with my additions.

My husband is the pickiest eater, and he gave it a 5 out of 5 on first bite. The sauce is perfect, the meatballs so succulent.  I used three cans of 14.5 oz. diced tomatoes, Italian Seasoning flavor, because it was all I had. It still tasted wonderful. Great recipe!

FINALLY the meatball recipe I have been looking for!  I have been on a quest for some time for the perfect meatball, and this is it.  The only adjustments I made were that I used two tablespoons of grated cheese (I used Parmesand, Roman, Asiago blend b/c that is what I had on hand) and I added 1/2 t. of salt.  I browned them first and then added them to a jar of Prego simply because I didn't have 2 hours to make this sauce.  Came out perfect!

Followed suggestion of another reviewer and put everything except meatballs in the crock pot after cooking onion and garlic.  Cooked on high for 2 hours, low 2 hours, and then added meatballs for one more hour.  I only used 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs in meatballs (yielded 12) and added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning to sauce.

Overall, not very time consuming, compared to cooking a sauce all day. Very chunky sauce, sweet in flavor. I used 4 - 14 oz. cans of diced tomato (instead of whole tomato), and can't imagine how much more chunky it would have been with whole tomatoes. Meatballs tasty, but also sweet. I used ground turkey and added a tablespoon of olive oil - so they wouldn't be dry as others commented. May make again with some alterations (more spice), but when in a hurry, will still use jarred sauce and doctor it up.

I used fresh basil for the sauce but everything else pretty much followed the recipe.  This was my first serious look at a 'recipe' for sauce, and it was a keeper.

Wow!! I usually just doctor up Ragu for the simplicity instead of making sauce. I think those days are over. This recipe, as is, is wonderful.  It is also very easy to make. I added some milk to the meatball mixture to assure that the balls would be juicy, this is the only change I made. This is my new favorite spaghetti recipe. Thank you Jeremy!!

Looks like an ordinary recipe, but tastes perfect.  I didn't cook the meatballs in the sauce since some of my family are vegetarians.  Froze it all separately for Christmas Eve dinner.  Then I will put one pot on with meatballs, and the other without.

This was the bomb! I did not use tomato paste in the sauce, but did add mushrooms, fresh parsley & basil. Also added fresh herbs & garlic to the meat balls. Mixed HB meat with Italian sausage.  This will be a regular dish in my house.

Excellent!  I made a double batch yesterday.  Only change to the recipe was, as other reviewers suggested, adding an extra tablespoon of grated parmesan to the meatballs, as well as about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of garlic powder to the final simmer once the meatballs were added, and I made 41 smaller meatballs instead of 12.  I also let it simmer for an hour instead of half an hour once the meatballs were added.  The only change I would make next time is to add an extra quarter or half cup of onions at the start since they cook way down.  Delicious - thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is excellent! I made in a roaster and let it cook overnight and the smell woke me up. I had to go to the kitchen and eat some at 4 am- just to make sure they were OK ;) I did use 80/20 ground beef for more flavor - only disadvantage is that I had to skim fat off top, but besides that delicious!! Thanks!

I only made the meatballs from this recipe, and chose to cook them outside of the sauce by browning them all over, but the FLAVOR of the meatballs was amazing. Next time I will try cooking them in the sauce...

This was sooooo good!! I only did 2 things different. I added sofrito to the sauce (which is a mix of of onions, peppers, garlic, olive oil and cilantro) and I used Italian bread crumbs for the meatballs. So very tasty. Everyone gobbled it up, even the 2 yr old Mr Picky Pants. I won't buy jarred sauce again!

This sauce was a big hit in our house! A simple red sauce, but packed with flavor and very easy to throw together.  I made some changes, but only out of necessity (didn't have something on hand) or habit (we use ground venison/beef mixture for just about everything).  The only trick I always use for meatballs is to put them under the broiler for about 8 - 10 minutes (turn them halfway through) then add them to the sauce as it simmers on the stovetop.  The meatballs get a little browned and make the sauce taste even better.  (Thanks Mom for the tip!). Thanks to Jeremy for posting this terrific recipe~ !

The meatballs were spectacular!  I didn't have any bread to make breadcrumbs, so I used oatmeal.   While the sauce was good, I think I will try and tweak it a bit with some more spices next time; seemed to lack a little flavor, This was a very inexpensive meal to make and I definitely will make it again.

This was a very easy and very good recipe.  My husband doesn't like any spaghetti sauce other than Ragu...he actually liked this!  I made the following changes...substituted ground bison for the beef, used 1/2 cup whole wheat breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup oatmeal for the meatballs.  For the sauce I used diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, oregano, and garlic (Red Gold).    Great recipe!

FINALLY had a chance to make the sauce an use my previously frozen meatballs!!! [[half day at school..]] I can’t believe first first of all the ¼ cup of oil. Ohh no no no no no!!! When it was simmering, oil kept coming on the spatula and sitting up on top. Ugghh. My dad noticed an did not have seconds. As far as following the recipe goes, I used w/e ever cans of tomatoes I had to equal the amount an next time will def. Not use whole..too chunky. I was also very liberal with the spices/herbs. When I added the meatballs, they were quick to soften an quite a few lost their roundness making for a really meaty sauce. But- they were deelicious =) ***Mseatballs were made with seasoned Panko bread crumbs an mozz. cheese to sub. and sized like a golf ball.

10 stars!! This is the best spaghetti sauce I have ever had and very easy to make. I will never use the store bought sauce again.  I must admit that I gently sauteed the meatballs before adding to the sauce. Highly reccomend!!!!

My family loved this dish. My husband does not like whole tomatoes so I just used tomato sauce and it still turned out great. It has become a family favorite.

Made with ground turkey and whole wheat spaghetti noodles this was sooo yummy. I added an extra tbs of grated parm. to my meatballs, sauteed a yellow bell pepper with my onion and pureed the sauce in my blender to give it a smoother texture and viola a great meal!

I have used this recipe so many times over the past year - but just now got on as a member to review.....This is the best recipe ever! I love that you just put the meatballs right in the sauce - definitely adds flavor. I also use the sauce recipe for all of my red sauce dishes. I always use a nice red wine to add a little flavor as well. Just a great dish!

Meatballs were excellent sauce was just OK for me, nothing special.  Will make the meatballs again though, perhaps in a different sauce.

I didn't realize how much this recipe would really make! We were eating leftovers for days (which wasn't bad because spaghetti always seems to taste better the next day). I doubt I will be making this again mostly because it took so long to make.    The meatballs turned out really good but we didn't care too much for the sauce.

fabulous!  the only major change I made was to halve the amount of added breadcrumbs.  I used lean beef, and thought so much would dry it out too much.  came out great.

I loved this! I was short on time when I made it so for the sauce I just sauteed the amount of garlic and onion in the olive oil and added jarred spaghetti sauce to it and it tasted great that way.  I also added extra eggs to the meatball mixture so that they were very moist.  I will make this again.

I made some minor changes to this excellent recipe.  I used fresh parsley in meatballs and sauce.  Used 1 cup of milk for breadcrumbs to soak in before adding to the meatball mix.  Rolled my meatballs in breadcrumbs before placing in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes.  When I took cooked meatballs from oven, I addedto sauce and let it cook for 2 hours on low heat.  So Good!

This is the best spaghetti sauce recipes ever!!! First, I am a tomato sauce snob and have been using the recipe for a few months now and I have never been disappointed.While it looks quite basic it is actually quite flavorful.  The meatball are also great, turning out well each time I have made them.  Cant lose, great recipe

second time with this one..very good...used 1.2 lbs 85% ground beef, 3/4 cup bread crumbs...fresh parsley...12 meatballs came out very moist..browned them for 15 minutes at 350, prior to adding to sauce...sauce will taste a little salty until adding the paste, basil and balls...used 42 oz. canned peeled whole tomatoes (plum ), and 14 oz. diced...excellent sauce....also added a small green pepper diced... nice recipe and simple to make....

Awesome sauce and awesome meatballs. There's nothing like a good homemade sauce. If you have extras the sauce freezes well.

First, Great recipe Jeremy and thank you for sharing :) I utilized this recipe for the meatballs only as I have my own traditional sauce.  Anyway, I read all the reviews,,those that want more flavor, use 1/2 Italian Sausage instead of all hamburger, those that want it more moist, throw in some spaghetti sauce from your meal before you make the meatballs.  And yes I did brown the meatballs just so they held their shape. For the most part the meatballs were still raw when I put them in the sauce.  Excellent meatballs and I will make them again and again because my husband prefers meatballs with spaghetti along with my neighbor who is an older full Italian treasure.  She is who gave these the thumbs up!  Thanks again Jeremy!!

I only used the meatball recipe and I thought they were very good. I added chopped onion and green pepper to them, and instead of simmering them in the sauce, I spread just a little vegetable oil in the bottom of my electric skillet and lined up the raw meatballs in it. I covered with some additional chopped green peppers and onions, covered and cooked on 350 until browned and cooked through. I then poured spaghetti sauce evenly over the top of them and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese and grated parmasan cheese over the sauce. I then covered and simmered until the sauce was warm and cheese was melted. If you cook the meatballs in a skillet though, keep a close eye on them so the bottoms don't burn, turn if needed. Great cheesy spaghetti and meatball dish!

The meatballs were very good, make exactly as stated. Simmering in the sauce made them moist. Did use crushed tomatoes, personal preference.

A new family favorite! I have been looking for a easy and great spaghetti and meatball recipe for years. Made 20 meatballs added 2x the parmesan. I would have never though to cook them in the sauce. Great texture and flavour. Added 1/2 cup fresh oregano and basil and another clove of garlic when added meatballs. So good!

Made meatballs 1/2 lb ground beef, 1/2 lb Bob Evans Hot Italian Sausage.  Used 2/3 c. italian breadcrumbs and 1/4 c grated parmesean cheese & half can italian seasoned tomato sauce.  Then followed the rest of the ingredients.  The meatballs were flavorful and moist.  For the sauce, I used 2 cans crushed tomatoes, followed the rest of the ingredients and used the remaining 1/2 can tomato sauce.  The meatballs really did flavor the sauce nicely.  The sauce did taste a little too salty, so next time will reduce to 1 tsp salt.  Thanks for a great tasting recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot!  Took the advice of one reviewer and turned it into a slow cooker meal.  I put all the sauce ingredients together in the morning and then turned it on at about 275 degrees for 6 hours.  I put the sauce through a blender just before adding the meatballs  cause I don't like big cooked tomato pieces (even though I used 5 cans of diced tomatoes and 5 of whole tomatoes). I took the advice of adding a can of tomato sauce too.  I didn't use fresh bread crumbs for the meatballs as I couldn't find any, so I just used dried ones instead.  Also, I forgot the garlic powder in them, so I just dumped a bunch extra in the sauce along with some Italian seasoning and more salt and pepper.  I also added 2 extra eggs to the meat balls, but I was making the recipe x5(not sure I'd do that next time though).  I added the meatballs an hour before serving and cranked the heat to 350.  Turned out great!  Especially served over whole wheat pasta.  Yum

This is my new favorite homemade spaghetti sauce! The only change I made was to use 2 lbs of ground beef...1/2 lb in the sauce and 1 1/2 lbs for the meatballs...Only because my family likes meat in the sauce.  Definitely a recipe to make over and over!

I was shocked to hear my husband say "very very good" repeatedly. He loves my cooking but all I ever get is a "this is good". Couples suggestions: 1. I ran the sauce through the food processor before serving (taking out the bay leaf) 2. I would add a bit more seasoning to the meatballs ie garlic. But the sauce was fabulous.

There was a ton of oil from the meatballs even though it was a lean cut. I had to spoon it out with a ladel. I also thought the sauce was too tart. Granted, the meatballs were pretty good, but overall nothing really exciting.

Awesome meatballs and sauce! From reading the other ratings before trying it,I decided to add a half c. of milk to the meatball mixture and they turned out beautiful. Not a real big fan of chunky sauce so before adding the meatballs to the sauce, I removed the bay leaves and put my "boat motor" to work on the sauce. If you love Italian food, this is the kind of stuff you dream about. Thanks Jeremy!

I added a LOT of dried oregano,basil,parley. As well as a handful of grated parm. Only because my family likes heavily seasoned food. Then before I served I added Fresh basil.. My hub insisted he grill the meatballs.. yes he LOVES to grill.. so I added the grilled meatballs to the sauce 10 mins before I served. The sauce was my first time making sauce from scratch.. I can't wait to do this again. Thanks for the great recipe

This recipe is one of the favorites I have found so far for pasta sauces, and I have tried quite a few in the past few months. I did make some adjustments (as does everyone on this site). I used 2 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes (not whole tomatoes) - mostly personal preference. When making the meatballs, I used 1/2 cup of crushed Club crackers because I ran out of breadcrumbs (had like 1/8 of a cup or something... so useless!) I then added 1/4 cup of milk to the meatballs. Oh, and I also used 1/2 lb ground pork and 1/2 lb ground beef as well as fresh parsley (didn't have any dried on hand, and fresh is so cheap anyway). I cooked the meatballs in the sauce, which I agree was a great method of cooking. This recipe is fantastic, and I will use it again. Thanks!!

Great sauce! I used my own meatball recipe cause it's a family favorite. I did crush the tomatoes by hand just so that the sauce wasn't so chunky and I added a little garlic powder.  My hus band was extremely impressed along with my guests. Great flavor and so worth the few extra minutes to make homemade sauce!

Fantastic! I was looking to make homemade meatballs and this recipe looked perfect. Now, I won't have to buy, pre-made sauce ever again.   For the sauce I used 2 (28 oz) cans crushed tomatoes.  My sons don't like chunky tomatoes in thier sauce.  I also added oregano and thyme along with the bay leaf in the beginning.  I did not add any salt. For the meatballs, I used 1.5 pounds of 85% lean ground beef.  I also started out with 1/2 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs and 4 Tbls. shredded Parmesean (we like cheese).  I've learned you can always add ingredients but it is difficult to take away.  I found though that I did't need to add any more bread crumbs.  I also added some saueteed onions and minced garlic for more flavor. This mixture made 16 meatballs.  My sons did comment that they looked large, I thought they looked normal.  Maybe next time, I'll make them smaller.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce was awesome.  I simmered my sauce for 90 minutes, added the meatballs and cooked them for about 45 minutes.   I made Garlic Bread Mama Rita's Way! from this website, to go with our meal. My son's gobbled everything up!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  The end result was not as good as I'd hoped.  The sauce was runny and not thick like we typically enjoy.  I didn't like the big chunks of tomatoes and if I had used the whole tomatoes, it would have been worse.  I think if I make it again, I'd use crushed tomatoes instead.  I also felt it was missing something.  I think it needed more spice or something.  The meatballs were good.  I liked the fact that I didn't have to precook them.

This was very good.  I did have to use a combination of canned tomato products (diced/stewed/whole--that's all I had), but, it didn't seem to matter because the sauce was very good.  I simmered the sauce on low for several hours.  Added the meatballs & rest of ingred. and simmered again for a few hours.

This was my first time making my own spaghetti sauce and meatballs...and it was amazingly wonderful!  I added a few extra things like italian seasoning.  I also omitted the salt bc I hate cooking with salt.  When I first tasted the sauce, I must admit, I was skeptical bc it seemed to be lacking something.  However, after cooking the meatballs and putting it on top of wheat pasta, it was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will never buy sauce for spaghetti again!

This was the first time that I made my own sauce and meatballs. This recipe was absolutely amazing..I will never buy sauce again. I made it with the Toasted Garlic Bread also from this site. My husband never goes back for seconds of spaghetti, but did tonight! He was also just eating leftover meatballs from the fridge. I didnt have any bread for the breadcrumbs, so I just use panko flakes. It worked perfectly. Next time I will add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce as well. Thank you!!

I LOVED the sauce but I wasn't too excited about the meatballs.  It was too bland for my taste.  It also had too much of a 'bread' flavor from the bread crumbs.  I would try it again tho.  :) Thanks!

I used the cans of tomatoes w/ the olive oil onions peppers and italian seasoning already added.  ALso instead of making meatballs I just put the seasoning(w/the exeption of the crumbs and eggs) and cooked it w/ the meat. Much quicker version that was still good but great when you need to make a quick dinner. KIds loved it.

I try a lot of recipes on this website and usually don't take the time to review them because they are usually just good/ok, but this was so easy and great!! I'm even 1/2 Italian (I make my mom's terrific sauce but wanted to try something new)!  I was skeptical - thought the meatballs would be too bland, but it was all great.  Followed everything exactly but left out 1/2 teaspoon salt because I was concerned it would be too salty, so I'm glad I did that because next time I might leave out even a little more.  Thanks Jeremy!

I've made this 4 or 5 times now with outstanding results. I leave out Basil, as my wife doesn't like it. I add double cheese and garlic powder in balls. I make bigger balls so only get 6 per pound. I add minced garlic, cheese and mushrooms to the sauce and simmer in the balls for the last 45 instead of 30 as they are larger. Great recipe!!

I love this recipe.  The key to simple sauces such as this is to use high quality ingredients...it makes all the difference in the world.  I enjoy the ease of cooking the meatballs right in the sauce.  Having to skim the grease off the top is only a minor detail that takes no time to do.

I didn't eat this dish but my husband and the kids loved it. For the meatballs I added some onions, garlic and a couple Tbsp of milk just as suggested. On the sauce instead of whole tomatoes I used crushed tomatoes because that's what I had. I also added fresh basil, fresh rosemary and fresh grated parmesan.

This was SOOO yummy.  We made it the first time and since, we've made several batches.  Yes, it does take a bit of time to make but what I do is make a double sized batch and freeze what's left over.  It's just as good out of the freezer as it is freshly made. I would definately recommend it.  The only thing I changed was I added extra tomato paste to make it thicker.

Very good! I added some ground italian sausage to the meatballs and upped the spices all the way around ~ but YUM!! Thanks for a great recipe! (I also browned the meatballs first - I made 24 small ones - then added to the sauce)

This is a great recipe. I was nervous about adding the uncooked meatballs, but they came out great and what flavor! I did add xtra garlic to them. But the sauce is so good. I used whole tomatoes and used a potato masher after about 15 minutes of cook time. Thank you for a wonderful homemade recipe. I have even used it for a elbow pasta and meatsauce recipe...yummy!

I made this the other night for dinner for my whole family... it was really good and they still rave about it!! I did however make some changes just a little oregano and some pepper, but the recipe itself was GREAT without the additions!! The meatballs were awesome although they took a little extra time to cook and I added 1/4 cup of milk to help them be moist and they were!! This was my first time making homemade sauce and meatballs and it was a hit!! Thanks for the reciepe

We did not like this very much. The whole thing was bland. I even added some onion powder and extra cheese to the meatballs (which, by the way, were better than the sauce). I think that we like our sauce a bit richer. I used two cans of crushed tomatoes as we don't care for chunks of tomatoes. But that still didn't make it a winner for us. I guess my search for the perfect spaghetti and meatballs continues...

Even though it says not to, I have cooked the meatballs first both of the times I have made this. My boyfriend says its ALMOST as good as his mom's so it MUST be good!

Delicious! Made some minor modifications: used fresh parsley and basil and added fresh orgegano. Added Penzey's Mural of Flavor to meatballs and mashed up the tomatoes before cooking. Adult daughter and husband loved this meal.

This was a great recipe!!  I just thought it was a little oily.  I took out the onions so that may have been why.  Next time I make it I will cut down the olive oil because hamburger is naturally oily any ways.  Plus I couldn't find dried basil, so I just used Italian seasoning instead.  I omitted the parsley in the meat balls and added more cheese.  I would also suggest adding a little more tomato paste to the mix.  I pureed my tomatoes before adding the meatballs to the sauce.  It didn't say in the recipe to do that.

I only made the meatballs, not the sauce.  We really liked them but I did pan fry them first.  I'm making another batch now for meatball subs for tomorrows lunch.  Yum!

MMMM! I loved it. I would definately recommend this recipe to anyone.  The sauce was very hearty & flavorful. The only change I made to the sauce was I used chopped tomatoes instead of whole and I pureed them, I dont like a real chunky sauce.  I did make a few changes to the meatballs, I used a ground beef, pork, & veal mixture, I doubled the parmesan cheese 1 tbsp just didnt look like enough, and I also added 1/4 cup milk.  I too was weary about adding the meatballs directly to the sauce without browning first, I did, but I simmered it for an hour after adding the meatballs. I dont think I will make any other changes next time I absolutely loved it. I think I will try the meatballs on a sub roll with some shredded mozzerella as others have suggested, sounds like a mean meatball sub to me.

After reading the reviews, I followed the suggestions of browning the meatballs before adding them to the sauce and using 1 can crushed tomatoes/1 can whole and pureeing the sauce after it cooked for a while.  My sauce tasted bitter, which could be due either to the brand of canned tomato stuff or else the tomato paste.  Any suggestions anyone?

Absolutely tasty!! I took the advice of some reviews and added 1/4 cup of milk in when making meatballs. I also added some dried onion flakes and italian spices to the mixture. Best meatballs I've had! Thanks for a great recipe.

I added mushrooms and used ground turkey instead and it was AWESOME. I love just putting the raw meatballs in the sauce. This was the easiest, most hands off recipe and it delivered an amazingly delicious meal.

I just made the meatballs and then used a jar of spaghetti sauce because its what I had on hand and the meatballs were perfect!  The 1 lb. of meat made more than 12 meatballs buts thats ok.  I am going to freeze the rest of the sauce and meatballs and eat it for another day.  Served with a caesar salad and garlic bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've always wanted to make spaghetti sauce and felt intimidated to do-so.  But this was so, so easy and delicious!  I followed everything to a "T".  The only thing I did differently was to use Panko bread crumbs in the meatballs.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

This is absolutely the best spaghetti sauce i've ever tasted! I'd never made homemade sauce before and this was soooo easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. I've made it twice now. I will never buy jar sauce again.

Delicious!  I did use the ground turkey for the meatballs and used only 1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup milk, and 1 tbls olive oil.  I also added basil and oregano to the meatballs.  SO GOOD!

My family was so tired of sauce in a jar. This recipe is excellent. I made a double batch and froze half. When I used the frozen batch it tasted like I had just made it. My family loved it this recipe is a keeper.

I'll never use sauce from a jar again!  My family loved the sauce and meatballs.  I snuck in finely chopped carrots and green peppers instead of the sugar and the kids never knew.  I'm going to use the leftovers for meatballs subs tomorrow. Thanks for the great recipe!

Holy cow!  This sauce is delish!!!  The meatballs needed some added flavor, so the second time I made it I added some italian seasonings, salt, more pepper, garlic salt, and it was perfection! Wow, wow, wow.  Hubby said he felt like he was at an Italian Restaurant or at some Italian Grandmother's home! Hahaha. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This is a REALLY great recipe. I did fry the meatballs before I added them into the tomato sauce. I also didn't have 2 cans of whole tomatoes so I used 1 can whole tomatoes and 2 (14oz) can of diced tomatoes. I used the leftover spaghetti sauce I had the next day for chicken parmesan. Delish!

These were the best meatballs I have ever made. RAVE reviews. I did use turkey meat and about a tablespoon of milk for moisture, but other than that followed exactly. This was AWESOME! Way better than browning the meatballs first. I'll never go back!   The sauce was great as a base recipe, but I did add a few things to make it my own. Chopped bell peppers, some red pepper flakes, one can diced fire-roasted tomatoes and about a tablespoon of fresh basil at the end.  Super good recipe!!! thanks!

This was a very good recipe, but there was a bit to much onion in the meatballs and not enough seasoning, at least not for me. I cut the onion from 2 to 1 and added some extra seasonings to give them a bit more flavor and they turned out wonderfully.

Great recipe!My husband loves it very much,I always try to keep a zip lock bag full with frozen meatballs in my freezer. Meatballs are just perfect! Great sauce too, although sometimes I get lazy and use the canned spaghetti sauce, tastes good too.It's all in meatballs!

My husband thought this was ok but I thought it was horrible.  It was like mini meatloaves with no flavor and way too many breadcrumbs.  Yuck.  I won't be making these again.  I didn't try the sauce and thank God because I think the jarred sauce was the only thing that saved this recipe.

This was pretty good. The meatballs are really what made this dish so good. I added a little more garlic and cheese than what the recipe stated, but they were AWESOME. The sauce itself was just okay, and I am still in the process of tweaking it to get it just right.

I followed this recipe as listed and wow it was so salty my husband who is not picky at all couldn't even eat. If you can get past the salt the flavor more Italian like. I thought about trying again without the salt but I don't want to spend all of this time on a meal and it be another flop.

This turned out very good--would make again. Basic recipe, but it tasted good and was easy, plus most of the ingredients you will have on hand.

Oh yes.  The sauce is wonderful - I did use an extra can of tomatoes and added fresh mushrooms.  Used lean ground turkey and was sure to brown them first and be generous with the spices.  I let the sauce simmer for around 2 hours...the longer the better!

I made these for my son and he loved them! I was so excited because I have never made meatballs before and was a little nervous about them turning out. I followed the directions to the 'T' and they were wonderful. What was left made great meatball sandwiches for the work week!

I needed a quick recipe for sauce because I was tired of my same ole, same ole so I ditched the meatballs and made the sauce.  Only changes were one 28oz can of whole peeled tomato and one 28oz can of tomato sauce.  Also added a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of red wine.  Lastly, added about a tablespoon of oregano.  Would definitely make again.

WOW!!  Absolutely delicious--I did add more spices to taste, and used 4C breadcrumbs, but the meatballs were outstanding.  We tripled the mb's and doubled the sauce and this resulted in a huge vat.  We had planned on freezing some, which never happened, they were so good! we ate them as leftovers.  You HAVE to try this recipe!

I was on the hunt for a meatball recipe and came across this. Excellent! I doubled the recipe and ended up with about 28 good sized meatballs. Didn't add a thing to it.I didn't have any lean ground beef left so I used regular. I did brown the meatballs on all sides in olive oil and instead of cooking them in a sauce I just placed them on my broiler pan and baked them at 350 for a bit. They came out crispy yet moist. Plus the grates in the brolier pan allowed icky fat to drain away! Great recipe!

Fantastic basic sauce!  I like to use fresh basil (or the refrigerated basil in a tube) instead of dried. The flavor is great. I always add a generous amount of garlic as well.  Don't try to cut back the cooking time.  The tomatoes will cook down and break up completely to thicken the sauce the longer you cook them.  Thanks for the recipe!  It is my staple recipe for tomato sauce.

I am never going to buy canned spaghetti sauce ever again!  This was amazing!!! I used ground turkey to make it healthier. Some of the viewers said the bread crumbs made it dry if you use turkey but I used crushed croutons and it tasted great!

Awesome sauce.  Followed the recipe to a *T* and it was wonderful!

Meatballs were a bit bland for me.  I was looking for something with more flavor.  Again, I didn't waiver from the recipe at all.

Not bad, but not excellent. There's nothing special to this recipe. The ingredients are basic. It taste good, but ordinary. I might make it again in the future. This recipe is great for lazy days. Those days when you don't feel like cooking anything too grand or complicated.

I prepared the sauce and cooked it in a slow cooker on low for six hours, then I added the meatballs and cooked for an extra hour on high. I found the sauce a bit bland (It needed more seasoning, although I did add some tomatoe juice to it in case it became too thick in the slow cooker, and a can of mushrooms because we like them) but the meatballs were really good (I added a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to the mix). Overall a good recipe but needs a bit of modifications for my taste.

This was good.  I pureed the crushed tom that I had.  Also added a lot of water to the sauce.  I did the meatballs and they were good.  I used canned bread crumbs.

Really good.  I mixed half italian sausage in with half of the called for amount of hamburger.  Yum! Was told that my version was better than the little 3rd generation Italian restaurant we frequent in St. Paul.

I didn't really make any changes to this except adding a small can of tomato sauce with the paste.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  Mine needed to simmer a little longer & it was ever better the longer it simmered.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the easiest and most tasty spaghetti and meatball recipe I have tried. Because of what I had on hand in the pantry, I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for plain ones and diced & crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. I did add more parmesan cheese (~4 oz.) and an extra egg to the meatballs. I have a 2 & 4 yr old at home and they loved it!

Undoubtedly the best sauce and meatballs I've ever made...and my husband agreed!  I did add about 1/8 tsp instant coffee granules and a bit more sugar.  This is absolutely my GoTo recipe for sauce from now on...thanks!

I added this to my recipe box for when I am in a bit of a rush.  I have not tried it, but it is pretty obvious to anyone who prides themselves on their cooking abilities and  by the ingredients involved,  that this would be quite nice.  Whatever herbs or spices I choose to add is simply a matter of taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. The four star comes from not having tried it yet, but I'm sure I will in the near future.

All the reviewers are correct - what a great recipe! Sauce was amazing and the meatballs were moist and delicious (not only in the sauce but also in meatball subs the next day). I used 28oz peeled whole and 28oz Italian diced tomatoes, added 1/2 chopped green pepper to the onions. After an hour cooking, I added 1/4tsp red pepper flakes. After 90 min. I also added some Italian seasoning, onion powder, oregano, and garlic powder, some Pinot Noir and 2 Dorot cubes of frozen basil. In the meatballs I was a bit under one pound of ground beef and added 1.5 mild Italian sausage in meat mixture. Really tasted amazing! This will be a staple in my household!

This was great! The meatballs were just delicious and everything turned out great. I added more garlic (which I always do with recipes). The only thing was I left it on the stove for another couple hours for a better flavor.

What I like most about this recipe was being able to just throw the meatballs into the sauce without browning them first, so much easier! The meatballs turned out just great, moist & flavorful. I ended up adding almost a whole jar of spaghetti sauce as the amount of sauce just wasn't enough for my taste. But overall this is a great recipe and I will make it again.

This was a fantastic recipe. Don't brown the meatballs, as other reviewers have suggested. Just cook them in the sauce like the recipe says. They were extremely moist and held together just fine. The only change I made was adding a little red wine near the end.

Wow, I did modify though. I used fresh oregano/rosemary (minced). I used 1 clove roasted garlic. And I only had saltines. I also seared the meatballs on the stove and baked them in the oven. WOW THE BEST BEST MEATBALLS EVER!

GUYS!!!This is by far...the best and the "it".
Let me tell you my variations that you would love. I follow some advice from other members.
MEATBALLS: I added the following plus the recipe given: 
I did 2 lbs of lean ground beef..
1/2 C parmessan
1/4 C beef broth (to keep it moist)
1 eggs
Italian seasoning= 2Tbsp
(basil,oregano,thyme,marjoram, etc)
2 tsp garlic salt
Mixed them with your bare hands (make sure to wash ur hands really good before mixing and after)
then make a meat ball...(2 lbs - 24 meatballs)
get a  freezer ziploc and put 1/4 C flour inside. Then put all the meat balls in the floures ziploc to coat meat balls.
 Get a pan and spay a lil bit of olive oil and spread the meatballs. Bale in a preheated 250 degres (1.5-2hrs) when it becomes a little brown and turn over. Once its cook then set aside.
SAUCE:
I sauteed 1 big chopped onion
5 cloves of chopped garlic
Heres the trick:
Then I got my slow cooker turned them to High...when the garlic and onion are transparent then transfer them to the slow cooker...the add the following:
I learned that if you have no tomatoes(which I dont have) the best thing you can use is  salsa...yes its SALSA.. 
So I got my mild salsa
2 Cups of Salsa (from costco)
2 C of prego pasta sauce (from costco)
1.5 C of Beef broth
1 T garlic powder
simmer for 3 hrs...reduce to low...then add the tomato paste basil, salt, sugar ground pepper (as per recipe shows)
and 12 meatballs for another 1 hr.
Now..you can start the sauce as you bake the meatbal

Love this recipe. I use it all the time for when we have guests over. If I don't have as much time, I use sauce from a jar and cook the meatballs for the same amount of time once it's heated. Thanks for the great recipe.

Worth the time and effort. Very tasty. We are gluten-free so I had to use fritos instead of bread crumbs but all turned out well. I froze leftover sauce and meatballs and used for stuffed green peppers

4 stars is for the sauce! So tasty. I did add about a half cup of red wine to the sauce and a few splashes to the meatball mix. I also added several spoonfuls of the sauce to the meatballs to ensure they wouldn't be dry...definitely worked! However, even with the addition of green bell peppers, lots of garlic, the meatballs didn't have enough umph for me. I'll definitely make the sauce again but next time I think I'll look to a different meatball recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME! Made it when I had family over to my new house for the first time.. Everyone raved about it!  Even the brother in law who hates homemade meatballs :) Only change I made was adding 1/2 a can of chicken broth to the meatballs & 1tsp of italian seasoning to the sauce. In fact, I'm making this tonight for dinner also :) Definately a keeper recipe :)

Seriously, I am part Sicilian and this recipe rivals all meatballs I have ever eaten at my Nan's or any other family member's! The sauce is nice and thick and the meatballs were very flavorful. One thing I do is add somewhere between 1/2 and 1 cup of warm water to my meatball mix, until it is moist. This ensures moist meatballs after cooking. I also added a teaspoon of salt to the meatball mix. Great recipe!

I suggest browning the meatballs first, as many of mine fell apart in the sauce.  My husband and daughter may have stirred them too roughly when I wasn't looking!  The taste was a perfect blend of spices.  Used Splenda instead of sugar and added fresh basil.  Yummy!

I really really enjoyed this meatball recipe.  I did take the advise of another viewer who said to put some sauce in the meatballs itself so it doesn't get dry...and it worked...the meatballs were moist and delicious. 

I haven't made the sauce itself yet...didn't have the time to do so tonight...but I do plan on making it when i'm more prepared.

Excellent sauce and meatballs.  I followed the directions exactly but used 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and 2 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic & basil.  The tomato paste was garlic infused and it made some great sauce with plenty left over for another meal.  I was leary about putting the meatballs in raw but it was absolutely perfect.  They were so tender and delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe for when I'm hungry for that authentic italian meal!

This is THE BEST! I have never made good spaghetti sauce before and I thought I would try this as I was having a large crowd for dinner. I felt like an Italian mama. Everyone without exception loved this. I made the meatballs exactley like the recipe. . I have found my recipe, I will look no further! Okay, after making this several times, I had about a half a bottle of red wine sitting on the counter. I added it to the sauce, and all I can say is it just made it that much better!

only used the sauce recipe. Ihave been doing more "natural" cooking (hardly any premade items) and was looking for a good spaghetti sauce. I might try others to have something to compare, but I loved that my picky 12 yr old (who will only eat Prego sauce) are this and never said a word. I used splenda in place of sugar and cut EVOO in 1/2, pureed stewed toamtoes before adding the paste,and added pureed cooked carrots (helps thicken it too)and no one was the wiser! There was none left!

These meatballs are great!  I bake them at 350 for about 15 minutes before putting them in the sauce.  Steam in the sauce for about 20 minutes.

I would give this five stars, but I didnt make the sauce, only the meatballs, which were awesome!  I loved that you don't have to fry them and they cook uniformly in the oven without all the mess.  LOVE IT!

This is a fantastic sauce, and we especially liked the meatballs. I used half ripe summer tomatoes and doubled the garlic in the sauce, and added 1/4 c of chicken stock - I think this really added to the end result!  In the meatballs, we used finely diced chopped garlic instead of powder, and we were careful not to overwork the meat and made the meatballs smaller (about an inch diameter).  Overall - thumbs up, great recipe!

This is a great recipe the only reason i give it 4 stars is becuase it took so long but well worth the wait. I followed the directions to the T however i did add a bit of water becuase it began to get very think and i did not want it to burn. I will be making this again.

I'm really not sure what happened here, but I made this recipe twice and it was *extremely* salty.  So salty, in fact, that we ended up dumping the lot of it both times.  The first time it happened I thought I might have absent-mindedly measured incorrectly, but it was just as bad the second time around and I was being very careful.

Made this tonight.  I was not sure if I really liked it or if it was just ok.  Hubby really liked it, but thought that it was rich.  I felt like I was gonna have heartburn later.  I thought that the meatballs were very good.   As for the sauce, I needed to add more sugar because of the acidy tomatoes.  Followed the recipe otherwise.  This Is a maybe make again for me.  Will be checking out other recipes first.

This is AMAZING--and flexible!  I made a double batch, only to realize I had just one can of tomato paste in the house but needed two.  So I put in 1/2 can of condensed tomato soup instead and it turned out great!  I also used bottled crushed garlic instead of fresh cloves, and freeze-dried chopped onion which I reconstituted with some water before sauteing.

This turned out very yummy and was even better the next day. My husband said it was better than restaurant quality. However, I did make a couple changes. I thought it was very salty about half way through and added probably 1/4c brown sugar. I also didn't think the tomatoes were cooking down enough so I took them out and put them in the blender for a few seconds. And lastly, I cooked the sauce for probably 30 min. less than it said because I didn't have that much time.

We made this recipe the other night and our family loved it.  We left out the bay leaf since it didn't sound appealing.  Also, we used Limousin beef.  Excellent!

Did not care for this bland sauce, I followed recipe to a tee.  I grew up with homemade wonderful sauces and I live in an area with wonderful sauces...so maybe I am just use to a more flavorful sauce.  I am giving 3-stars as the meatballs were good although I would definately add more garlic and italian seasoning to kick it up a notch or two.

This was not very good or traditional. I grew up on homemade sauce and this leaves alot to be desired from a traditional "Italian" sauce. I also agree with several reviewers that the meatballs tasted more like a hamburger then meatballs. We ate it but didn't really like... oh well, win some lose some. Everyone has their own tastes...

I used garlic salt, onion powder & some oregano in the meatballs & I used cracker crumbs rather than bread crumbs.  To keep the meatballs from being dry, I added a small can of tomato juice. I used basil in place of the parsley and added a little more parm b/c I used closer to 1.5 pounds of ground beef.  I baked the meatballs at 350 for 25 minutes and just added them to the sauce at the very end to coat and flavor well.  For the sauce, I sauteed the onion and garlic in "bruschetta" olive oil. I used two 14.5 oz. cans of Italian diced tomatoes, 1 can of Hunt's tomato sauce for lasagna and one 26 oz. can of Hunt's Roasted garlic and onion Spaghetti sauce.  It needed just a bit more sugar for the tartness so I added in a little brown sugar.  I also added some oregano with the basil. I am sure the recipe is still quite good as stated, but  I made these changes after reading some of the reviews and also to use up some of the items I already had in my pantry.    Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very easy and super yummy!  The only change I made was to bump up the cheese in the meatballs, since I love cheese.  Will definitely make again!

It was good but not great. The meatballs were better than the sauce. There must be a better recipe out there somewhere...

My husband has been looking for a good meatball recipe and we both enjoyed this one. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except that I increased the garlic powder in the meatballs to 1/4 t and I increased the sugar in the sauce to 2 t. The only problem I had was that I forgot to make the spaghetti. Oh well, the sauce just had a little more time to simmer while I waited for the noodles to cook.

I've made this a few times. I never would of guessed that my family, especially my picky girl would know the difference between this and the bottle sauce.  They did.  I now, can no longer use bottle sauce.  When I do, I can expect some complaints.  This is a recipe going into my recipe book.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband has an aversion to onions and my two best friends are allergic, so I searched high and low for a decent onionless meatball recipe. I've never made the sauce (always just used a jarred kind), but the meatballs are DELISH. We use them for spaghetti and for meatball hoagies. 

The only thing I do different is like quadruple the amount of parmesean cheese. I don't measure it, I just dump in a bunch - maybe 1/8 or 1/4 cup?

Anyway, thanks so much for this recipe! I've been making it for years and everyone raves.

I tried real hard to follow the recipe exactly to give it a fair review.  I ended up adding more seasoning (Italian and Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning), 1 T brown sugar (but could've even used more) pureed the tomatoes (I already substituted one of the cans for crushed tomatoes).  The meatballs were perfect but there could've been more, 1 1/2 to 2 times the amount.  So overall it was a good recipe to tweek to your individual tastes, thanks for sharing!  Oh, and I used 2 slices of fresh bread and ground them up in the food processor (tearing them by hand would work too), you do NOT want to use regular bread crumbs!

I made the sauce only, and used it in a baked ziti recipe.  Fabulous and easy!  I added 1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon worcestshire, and for spices I used 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon dried chives, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon parsley, and a pinch cumin.  It was just a little too salty, so I will reduce the salt to 1 tsp next time.

Our family loves this recipe! And there is no need to let the sauce simmer for 90 minutes. After adding the tomatoes, salt, sugar, and bay leaf bring the mixture to a boil. Then proceed with adding the tomato paste, basil, pepper, and meatballs. Simmer for another 30 minutes like the recipe says and you have a delicious....and much quicker dish for dinner! Thank you for this new family favorite!

Love this recipe.  We use ground turkey for the meatballs, and for some reason I usually forget the egg.  It's still wonderful!  Add some red pepper flakes if you want a little spice.  Thank you for this recipe.  I won't buy the stuff in the jars anymore!

This was fairly bland despite doctoring it with quite a few additions such as garlic powder, oregano and fennel seeds. I used Italian spiced ground Turkey for the meat balls. It was not bad...just not very flavorful.

This recipe was awesome.  Both my sister and I are not big spaghetti fans; however, this recipe has changed are views.  I did add a little bit more seasoning to my meat balls and garlic, but overall good recipe.  Even my DH loved it.

For meatballs, I used half ground italian sausage & half ground beef and seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the fresh breadcrumbs. Excellent cooking the meatballs in the sauce.

I was going to a build-your-own pasta party. And I was in charge of the meatballs. I didn't have the ingredients for the sauce, so I just used some canned stuff and made the meatballs. I too put it in a crock pot for 5-6 hours on low. Everyone complimented me on how good the meatballs were!

This didn't turn out very well for me. Maybe I messed it up because I cooked it all day in the crock pot (just not enough time at night after work to do it as written)The meatballs cooking directly in the sauce made it VERY greasy and I didn't like the texture of the meatballs, either. The taste was pretty bland even after adding extra spices and sugar. Edible, but not something I'd make again.

Used 1.5 lbs ground sirloin as that's what I had. Added 1/2 C italian bread crumbs and 1/2 C parmesan cheese to meatballs. Used itailian diced tomatoes and extra oregano and some red pepper to the sauce. Put it in the crockpot on low and it was ready in 5-6 hours. Family loved it.

This recipe was delicious! Instead of using beef for the meatballs, I used ground turkey to make it healthier. Also, I used organic whole tomatoes.

I added mushrooms and used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I also added more spices. Pretty tasty. Next time I might add more tomato paste. Served on top of whole wheat spaghettini.

I have been making this for a few years now. I finally decided to sing up and post my review on one of my fav recipies. I did however make a few changes. I used 28 ounce crushed tomatoe, 28 ounce tomatoe puree, and 28 ounce tomatoe sauce. I left out the paste, I don't like my sauce too thick. I also made this recipe in my slow-cooker and let it cook for 6 hours and put the meatballs in for the last hour and a half. Truly the best! I'm considering to adding a chopped green bell pepper the next time I make it.Enjoy!!

Used sauce recipe with italian sausage in it instead of meatballs, it was delicious! The sauce had an excellent consistency, the only thing I added was some italian seasoning blend.

I didn't know spaghetti and meatballs could taste so good. We didn't change the recipe at all. Just let it simmer for an hour before putting the beef in because we were starving. So definitely start this one early. We did put the beef in raw with the sauce which seemed a little strange but my BF insisted. It was absolutely delicious. I ate it again the next day for lunch. We just made this for a 2nd time. We used a different brand of whole tomatoes and the sauce came out pretty thin. Not sure if it was that brand or what. But it still tasted great!

This is easy and delicious.  I've made it a few times now and it's great every time.  I simmer it uncovered the last 30 min. to make sure it's nice and thick.  I've also added 1/2 tsp fennel, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1/2 cup minced black olives with good results.

After reading some of the comments, I decided to try the recipe with half beef half pork, but I thought the pork made it a little drier. So next time I'll be making it with all beef again. Excellent recipe, Thank you!

I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I was looking for a more authentic tasting sauce and this one was a bit lacking in flavor. I did love the meatballs in which I used ground turkey instead. I may use those with another sauce recipe

I wasn't totally wild about this sauce but I plan on trying it again with a few changes. Next time I plan on using crushed tomato instead of whole so that it's not so soupy. I will use fresh bread crumbs as instructed but brown them first. My meatballs had an odd taste. Add mushrooms, green pepper, and play around with a few more spices and add a little more sugar and it should be pretty good. I won't give up on this one- I'm an Italian cook without a spaghetti recipe!!!!!

This recipe was great. I rarely make my own  spaghetti sauce and we really enjoyed it.  I ended up using canned bread crumbs, 1 28 oz jar of crushed tomatoes and 1 28 oz jar of diced tomatoes and it was really good. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I used home canned tomatoes & swished the jar with a splash of red wine,italian seasoned breadcrumbs in the meatballs, & topped the dish with fresh minced parsley. I served toasted garlic bread topped with melted parmesan cheese & fresh minced parsley alongside to really make it pop. Thanks for a great recipe,Jeremy!

This is worth more than 5 stars!  I haven't tried the meatballs as I have my own killer recipe but the sauce is fabulous!!!  My husband isn't a big fan of pasta but he said he would eat it once a week if I made this sauce.  I have served this for company a few times and each time my husband "scolded" me for serving this sauce because it meant less for him!

This recipe as-is is ok.  To make true Italian meatballs, you need the trinity -one third each of ground veal, beef, and pork.  Since ground veal is difficult to find, I usually substitute it with Italian sausage.  To keep the meatballs moist, I usually add half a cup of cream or milk - similar to meatloaf recipes.

We all really liked this.  The only changes I made were: I blended the tomatoes first, hubby doesn't care for tomatoes), I added a little milk to the meatballs as others suggested, and I put the meatballs and basil in for an hour to simmer just to be sure it was cooked through.  Will defiantly make this again.  thanks for the recipe.

I only made the meatballs from this recipe.  My daughter decided on her 5th birthday that she wanted spaghetti and meatballs for her special supper.  I only had 1/2 hour to prep supper and no time to make a special trip to the grocery store.  This recipe was a life saver.  The only change I made was adding some salt and extra cheese.  The birthday girl and everyone else thought they were great.  Maybe they aren't "Authentic" enough for some people but the fact that they are made from simple ingredients most people have on hand and they take a relatively small amount of time to make and they taste good makes it a keeper recipe for me.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was very good.  The only thing I did not like was the chunky tomatoes.  Next time I will run them through the processor before I make the sauce.  I also added 1/2 c milk to the meatballs and they came out very moist.  Very nice flavor!  I will definitely make it again!

I was concerned about not cooking the meatballs first but they came out fine. The sauce was excellent, the only reason this does not get 5 stars is that the meatballs were rather bland. I would recommend adding some more spices to the meatball mix.

Made just the sauce and it got excellent reviews at our house.  Did add a little oregano and pureed @ 2/3 of it in the blender after the first simmer.  We like a smoother sauce and it disguises the vegetables from my son!

Great recipe! If you want more flavourful meatball, substitute the bread crubs with prepared stove top or a similar boxed stuffing.

Great meatball recipe--they were flavorful, moist and not too bready or  dominated by the different spices. Using 2 eggs instead of 1 helps ensure the meatballs are moist. I also baked them for 5 minutes to shorten the cooking time before putting them in to simmer.  I didn't have the time to make homemade sauce and used jar sauce, which went great, too.

I dind't follow the recipe exactly. I left the parsley and garlic out of the meatballs. I added 1 tblspoon of balsamic vinegar to the sauce, and I let simmer the meatballs for at least one hour, which really makes a difference.

I think that the recipe was good. I really hate to say that the meatballs were too bland and had too much breadcrumbs. If I made it again, I would put less breadcrumbs and add more seasoning. I think the sauce was good, but I also would add some seasoning to that as well. I did enjoy the sauce the most.

Got rave reviews on this recipe. I added italian spices as other reviewers suggested, but was a bit too stong. I broke up the meatballs and let simmer a little longer and turned out perfect.

The meatballs themselves were good, but the sauce was very thick and a little bland.  It might be good on a sandwich, covered in cheese, but not so good for spaghetti.

It was just okay. I'll make the simple meatballs again, with seasoned bread crumbs as per prior advice and 2 eggs. The sauce did taste like it was from a jar and therefore didn't really suit my taste. If you like the out of a jar taste, you'd probably like this.

This recipe was pretty good. I did make some changes. I used home canned tomatoes and drained them before I measured 28 oz. I did use 1 tsp of italian seasoning in the tomato sauce. I used 2 eggs in the meatball mixture and it did not seem too dry to me. I cooked the meatballs in the sauce, but added them so they cooked for about 1 hour instead of the 30 minutes it called for. The meatballs came out nice and tender and were delicious. I did end up cooking the sauce for a total of 2 1/2 hours because I wanted it to cook down a bit more and become thicker. I used 6 oz of tomato sauce instead of the paste just because that's what I had in the house. I will definately make this again. Great recipe to make for Sunday dinner when its raining outside! It would be great as a Meatball Sub Sandwich. I made the garlic cheese flatbread (also on this site) to go with it. Thanks for the great recipe Jeremy!

I think this recipe could be great, with a bit of tweaking.  The taste of the sauce was very good, but it was much too thick and dry.  I'll add a bit of tomato sauce next time I make this.  I did bake the meatballs in the oven before putting them in the sauce for 30 minutes because my husband doesn't like the additional grease, but the meatballs were still great.

I only made the meatballs, but they were very tasty. They were so easy to make, and I just let them simmer in pasta sauce that I already had (Five Brothers) for about an hour, and then poured the entire mixture over whole wheat linguini. YUM!

Very good!  My first attempt at meatballs of any kind, and they turned out so well.  My daughter requested spaghetti and meatballs after seeing it in a book so I found this recipe.  I used 97% lean ground beef with great results.  I also used whole wheat bread crumbs (made my own in my food processor).  I had slightly over a pound of ground beef, and made 16 meat balls.  I used half no-salt tomatoes and omitted the extra salt from the sauce.  Served with steamed asparagus and Garlic Cheese Flatbread from this site.  We had a guest for dinner and he enjoyed this too.

i've learned to try to save 5 star ratings for truly remarkable recipes. this was good, and everyone enjoyed it -- but from my husband i got "too tomatoey" and "it was okay". i thought it was tasty but not particularly memorable. simple though. i used one can of whole tomatoes and two diced. this recipe and a whole box of pasta was enough for 4 adults and 2 kids, plus leftovers.

I had to add some lemon juice to this recipe to cut the sweetness of it.  It was also a little too salty for me, I would make it again with a reduction in salt, and about 1 tsp of lemon juice or vinegar from the start.

This was my first time making spaghetti with meatballs.  I used 20% fat ground beef (so they would be moist) and added extra pepper and some salt to the meatballs.  It was a delicious recipe.  I look forward to making it with fresh herbs from my garden.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for a pasta dinner serving 100 people. My second batch turned out better. The changes I made was that I slightly browned the meatballs in a little olive oil before adding to the sauce. I put the peeled tomatoes in a blender to puree them a bit. I also decreased the amount of olive oil during the first stage of the sauce. I got rave reviews from all and will definitely make again.

I have made this several times and I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Absolutely the best spaghetti sauce I've ever made - my boyfriend loves it, too, which is a good sign :)  I also really like the mild flavour of the meatballs with this sauce.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce makes this easy and delicious.  I use this spaghetti sauce with all dishes that call for spaghetti sauce because I love it so much.  Make sure that you let the sauce simmer for the 90 minutes recommended in the recipe.  This really lets the flavours melt together.  Mmmmmmmmmmm... enjoy!

My daughter loved this dish. Even though the tomato sauce takes time to make it is worth it. I followed the recipe but I did add a little more olive oil and onion, also with the spices I added 1/2 teaspoon of oregano. I did add a pinch more of the spices that the recipe called for because I was worried about the other reviews that the sauce was bland. I didn't think it was bland even with the additions I did. No more jars of spaghetti sauce for me!

I only make the meatballs because I have my own sauce recipe, but they are superb! I did make a few changes: I reduced the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup because 1 cup makes them too dry. I also add 1/4 cup of shredded six-cheese Italian blend (which you can buy at any grocery store) and add a little extra parmesan. The meatballs come out moist and flavorful, and my entire family loves them!

The sauce & meatballs were both delicious.  I baked my meatballs before adding them to the sauce.  I also pureed my sauce since I don't care for chunks of tomato, and next time I will also add sauteed mushrooms, because we love them.  The meal was a hit with my 1 yr old, my husband and myself.... delicious and simple!!

I'm in heaven.  Of all the Italian dishes I have made this one is Number 1.  Although the prep time is long, it is very, very simple.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and added 2 cups of water. A definite "add" to my recipe box.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was very nice.  Easy to make, in spite of a long simmer time.  Got thumbs up from everyone in the house.

I've made this twice.  The first time, the meatballs didn't get done (and I even browned before adding tot he sauce)...so ended up cooking the entire batch for a total of almost 4 hrs.  I thought the sauce was somewhat bland and ended up having to spice it up quite a bit.  However, everyone loved it.  This time, I'm making it in the crock pot with smaller meatballs that I also browned ahead of time.  Added mushroom, red peppers, and a handful of other seasongs.

I only made the meatballs form this recipe. They were awesome. I baked them in the oven with jarred tomato sauce. They turned out excellent. I also tried frying some, but they weren't as good, they were dry.

Yummy! I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage to make the meatballs, I only used one 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes and added a jar of spaghetti sauce, served with cesar salad and garlic bread..a treat for hubby and I!

I only used this recipe for the meatballs. They were tasty but 1 cup of breadcrumbs was too much. They were way too dry and I needed to add more moisture.

The sauce was easy and had a great flavor.  Next time, I'll use diced tomatoes vs. whole b/c they don't simmer long enough for the whole to break down to edible pieces.  I also added 9 garlic cloves since my husband and I love garlic and oregano along with the basil.  Regarding the meatballs, I will bake them next time before adding them to the sauce mixture to reduce fat (they were too squishy).  Otherwise, this is an easy recipe w/ great flavor.

This sauce is FABULOUS.  My husband and toddler son and I loved it.  It tastes just how spaghetti and meatballs should!  Due to lack of time, I cheated on the simmering and dumped everything in together after sauteing the onions and garlic.  I just cooked it until the meatballs were done.  It tasted great, I can imagine that the only thing I missed was extra time for the tastes to mingle together.  Since my husband is not crazy about tomatoes, I also used diced instead of whole.  I made extra meatballs....YUM!!  Great job, Jeremy's mom!

I have been making this Sauce and Meatballs for over a year now. Jeremy I think its great. I make a giant pot of sauce and freeze it and use it anytime I make pasta. Also the meatballs and sauce are great for meatball subs with provalone and parmasan cheese on top. Jeremy your the greatest. I should have rated this sooner...

I can't really give this recipe a fair rating because I only made the meatballs, and skipped the sauce recipe.  To save time I just simmered the meatballs in a couple of jars of spaghetti sauce, and they turned out delicious.  I even took the leftover meatballs to work the next day and ate them on a hoagie roll, meatball sandwich, and was really tasty!  Next time I make these, I'll be sure to do it when I have extra time to make the sauce.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I loved the meatballs.  They were very quick and easy.  The sauce was just alright - a little plain and a  bit salty. I think next time I will try making the meatballs with our favorite store bought sauce. Overall, a good recipe.

This sauce recipe rocks, I make with ground turkey and make my meatballs smaller than suggested.  I don't like "big hunks of meat" (unless it is steak!).  They go with the sauce well!! YUMMY!!!

Like some other reviewers, I only made the meatballs, and I think they have almost the perfect texture. My husband thought they were a bit bland, but I think they compliment a favorite sauce very well. They were very easy to put together in a food processor, I just pulsed it until the ingredients were blended. I didn't bake them first - they cooked up great in my sauce without falling apart. I should try the sauce to be fair, but I just don't think I would be able to stand making a spaghetti sauce without red wine and oregano!

I would give 5 stars for the meatballs and about 3 stars for the sauce. The meatballs were great. I was very conflicted (after reading ALL the reviews) as to whether or not I should brown them before simmering in sauce but I followed the directions to NOT brown and mine were perfect, very moist and tasty. The sauce was just ok but in the future I would probaby use a store bought jar and add spices to my liking. Thanks Jerry the meatballs were fantastic. My one and half year old daughter kept saying "Yummy."

Awesome. I was skeptical about putting the metaballs with the sauce like many others, but this turned out great.  I added some oregano to the sauce, left out the bay leaf (didn't have any) and added fresh minced garlic to the meatballs.  My dinner guests loved it.  Thanks for sharing.  This is now in my permanent collection.

i didn't think the sauce was very exciting...it was very good, but nothing to write home about. i took people's advice and used crushed tomotoes instead of whole. it was quite good. a tad too salty, so i would cut the salt out altogether. THE MEATBALLS ON THE OTHERHAND were excellent! so moist, delicious, and flavorful!!! it's the first time i've ever made meatballs and i lvoed them! i'm still so surprised we cna just dunk raw meat into the sauce and have them come out so yummy?! thanks so much -- htis recipe is a keeper!

Very Italian taste!  I loved it!  Instead of bread crumbs,I added some oatbran to make the meatballs - came out amazing.  The left overs were even better the next day!  Mmm...

My family loved this sauce.  It was my first attempt at homemade and it turned out delicious.  I substituted crushed tomatoes and also added about 1/4 cup red wine in the last 1/2 hr of cooking.  I was skeptical about adding the meatballs uncooked, but I used a very low fat meat and it was fine.  My husband said this sauce and meatballs were as good as our favorite Italian restaurant.

This was excellent. The meatballs were PERFECT!!! I was always a skeptic of putting the meatballs directly in to the sauce, but not any more.  I followed this to the tee with no changes. My husband thought these were the best meatballs I have every made. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great recipe. I don't normally make meatballs so big but I enjoyed them. I kept the same amount of meatballs that the recipe called for and cut the sauce ingredients in half (but used the whole can of tomato paste). I didn't have a bay leaf but used oregano instead. My husband didn't really like the tomato pieces in the sauce, so next time I might use crushed tomatoes in place of the whole peeled tomatoes. We really enjoyed this dish and it was even better the next day.

I baked golfball sized meatballs on a jellyroll pan for half an hour before adding to the sauce.  I find that easier than frying.

This is a great recipe that fills your house with some wonderful smells while cooking.  I used a can of diced and a can of crushed tomatoes for the sauce.  The meatballs were moist and delicious with just a little added garlic and with a little water added to the fresh breadcrumbs.  Easy and authentic tasting.

Very garlicky.  5 cloves were too much.  Could use chopped tomatoes also.  The meatballs were good.

I made this for my parent's anniversary and it they loved it! The meatballs, however, were mushy so I just made it into a meatsauce. Makes for a nice thick sauce. Delicious!

I scaled this for 90 servings and made it for our church potluck and got many positive comments! My hospitality team got together and made the meatballs (about 300 of them)a day ahead of time and they kept very well in the refrigerator until I was ready to use them.  They smelled great and had a nice texture and flavor, and held together very well while cooking. It was great not having to brown them first.  I took other people's advice and used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones.  It was a good decision.  The only suggestion I have is that if you scale it to make a large quantity, use your judgement on the amount of olive oil to use when you saute your onion and garlic.  I used what it called for and it was too much - made the sauce a little too oily. I made sure to use ground beef for the meatballs and not ground chuck or ground sirloin. I think that makes a big difference in the outcome and I made sure to use soft, fresh bread crumbs - we made them in a small food processor.  All in all it was a great recipe and I will definately make it again.

This was AWESOME! I added an extra pinch of sugar to even out the tone.  I would also like to add that you might want to consider cutting up the tomatoes before putting them in. I don't know if that's just so obvious that I should have already known, but it's hard to cut them up once they're already in the pan with the other ingredients. But the recipe was great!!!

This recipe is wonderful. I use wheat germ in place of bread crumbs in my meatballs because I'm a health food freak. The texture was perfect. I will try diced tomatoes next time for a little smoother sauce. I served with some sauteed string beans and wheat pasta, it was great!

This was the first time I have made homemade spaghetti sauce and meatballs, and I thought this recipe was 10 times better than opening a jar of spaghetti sauce. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and added Itailian seasoning to the meatballs and the sauce.  I will defintly make this recipe again in the future!!!

I had a special occassion that I was asked to make the meatballs, the reviews were very helpful. I was happy to hear everyone rave about the meatballs at my event. Everyone said they were delicious.  When it was time to clean up there was not one meatball left. I made enough for 50 servings. We had 5 main courses from ham to sweet and sour chicken.  everyone else had food left to devide or get rid of.  Someone asked what happened to all the meatballs I want to take some home.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.  It was a hit

I've made the meatballs twice now and they were great.  I usually add spices by my taste, so I don't know how much I changed it, if at all.  I'll be making them again tonight and this time, I'll make the sauce and follow others' suggestions by browning the meatballs before dropping them into the sauce because the onions on the edge of the meatballs seem to fall off when I add them to the sauce.  Regardless, these were fantastic.  Thanks Jeremy.

This was very good. I did have to add liquid to the meatball mixture, about a cup of water. I could tell when I was mixing it that they were going to be too dry. They turned out delicious!
As far as the sauce goes it was really good but next time I will just use jar sauce and doctor it up like I always do. I used to make my own sauce years ago but jar sauce has spoiled me. All in all this recipe is very good especially the meatballs.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, adding more garlic is definitly a must, I used crushed cheese and garlic croutons because I didn't have any bread crumbs and it really added to the meat balls. I also pureed the sauce cause my kids don't like tomato chunks.

This sauce was very heavy tasting.  Way too much olive oil-- I would half it down to 1/8 of a cup.  The funny thing was that our picky eater son was the only one in the family who liked it!

I used to have my 'own' recipe for spaghetti sauce until I tried this one, it is great!!!  I would say to find a different recipe for meatballs, as this one was not very appealing to my family or myself.

This recipe was fabulous!  I don't normally write reviews, just read them.  But I had to this time.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  Hubby loved it and bragged to everyone about my spaghetti and meatballs.  He also said it was better than restaurant quality.  I can't wait to use the leftover sauce in the fridge.  You have to try this!

Yes, a keeper recipe! The sauce turned excellent! Very thick and tasty! Loved it!
the meatballs however, different story, they all feel apart..but I have only made them a few times, so Im sure it was me, not the recipe.

BRAVO! This was absolutely great! My American boyfriend had been longing for this dish, so I went ahead and did it. First time- excellent, but with a few changes it was even better!

I cut down on the breadcrumbs and doubled the parmesan and (FRESH!!! Use ONLY fresh herbs and double the amount!) parsley for the meatballs. To the sauce, I added a couple of tablespoons of cooking cream which added immensly to the flavor and texture.
Penne pasta, those tender meatballs in the velvety, creamy tomatoe-sauce... it's a dish to die for!!!! 

Try it. It takes some time, but it's worth every second. And make sure to have some fresh, warm garlic-bread to suck up the sauce with!

Excellent recipe!!!  My husband loved it!  Reading the other reviews I decided also to lightly pan cook the meatballs.  I also chose to use 50/50 hamburger & sausage for the meatballs.  It gave them excellent flavor.  I will make this dish again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I usually just fix run-of-the-mill meat sauce with spaghetti, so this was a nice change. I do think that a cup of breadcrumbs was a little too much, and next time I think I'll use Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain. They needed a little more kick. I also had to use jar spaghetti sauce, because I didn't have everything I needed to make the sauce. I will try it next time.  Really good!

I finally made a spaghetti sauce that I like!  It reminded me of something you'd order at an Italian restaurant!  I had never cooked meatballs in the sauce before, but I'll do it that way from now on!

I have been looking for a great homemade spaghettie sauce recipe and this is it!  We tried it with ground turkey and we wouldn't recommend it.  My husband likened it to eating cardboard balls.  Next time I will use hamburger meat or sausage for sure!

The meatballs were good (I used half italian sausage and half ground beef)
but the sauce was wonderful!  It was kinda thick but I like that because I don't like
a runny spaghetti sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the best receipe for spaghetti and meatballs I've tried so far, I did use half italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef though.  I thought there wasn't enough sause though.  That is easy to fix though by adding more tomatoes..thanks for an excellent receipe, michelle

Love the meatballs!  Love the sauce!  And the sauce is especially great if you make it separately and refrigerate or freeze.  This allows all the flavors to mingle most deliciously.

I altered the recipe a little, but either way I am sure that it would have been fantastic.  Authentic Italian Restaurant caliber!
I made the meatballs after the sauce, then browned them in a little in olive oil and onion.

Really good. Will definitely make it again, and stop buying jarred sauce.. why when it’s so easy to make and so delicious. Very few modifications..added Worcestershire to meatballs and doubled the Parmesan, and used one can of herb and spices tomatoes for flavour. Loved it!  Shout out to the chef who suggested to start the sauce first, since you have tons of time to make the meatballs while the sauce is simmering, yes do that! Love it. Try this recipe. Yum!

I was a little weirded out about putting the raw meatballs into the sauce but like most said, the meatballs turn out perfect and it makes the sauce even better. Very good, will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly as is and this is by far the best sauce I’ve ever had.   My husband likes a thicker sauce so I fried out some hamburger meat, peppers, celery and onion for him and added the sauce to it  and we were both happy.

Not quite my grandmother but it's the best I've made since cooking on my own. The sauce was good- I used crushed tomatoes rather than whole. I made sure to simmer for many hours.

Scrumptious! I add tomato paste in once garlic and onion is tender and fry together for at least 5 minutes before adding tomatoes, etc. This cuts the acidity and brings out the natural sweetness of the tomato eliminating the need to add sugar. Mixing 1/3 cup or so of the pasta water into your sauce just before you drain the pasta puts it over the top!

I am reviewing on the meatball portion of this recipe and I can say that even my husband who is not a huge fan of spaghetti loved this recipe.  It was very easy.  I was wary to not cook the meatballs before adding them to the sauce, but they came out tender and perfect.

Made the meatballs and put them in canned spaghetti sauce.  Put in Crock-Pot and cooked them a few hours.  Amazing taste.  Too bad I didn't have the ingredients on hand for the sauce.

I will be making it tonight.  Of all the recipes I have found, you are not using any "pre-seasoned" ingredients. I never do ever do, because they always contain salt. I am on a salt restricted diet(doctor's orders) and by not using them I am in control of what goes into my food.

Followed the recipe exactly the only thing I did was right before serving I used an immersion blender in the pot to break up any too large bits of tomato. This was so easy and the meatballs were terrific! Will put this into my rotation for sure!

The taste was great, but I added water because the sauce was not enough to cook the meatballs. later I use a dork to cut the meatballs since they were not cooking.

This recipe is fabulous and foolproof. My tip: use an ice cream scoop to make the meatballs—it will make exactly 12 scoops and it’s easy to pop them out of the scoop and I to the sauce. Only thing is, they’re flat on the bottom but I like that because it makes them stable on the plate.

Good recipe much like my parents.  However, I will add some ground sausage next time to the meatballs  because today's ground beef is tasteless.

Very similar to family recipe, which I’ve never had measurements for, this is same basic ingredients with measurements for those who dont just add spices til it’s enough like good Italian grandmas.

I'm a full-bloodied Irish girl who married into an old-school Italian family. I knew this was great when my mother-in-law asked me for the recipe! Woo hoo! 

I add onion and fresh garlic to the meatballs, and do 3/4 lbs ground beef with 1/4 ground pork. Aside from that, everything else is the same. Amazing! :)

Absolutely the BEST spaghetti and meatballs I've ever made in my life!
I followed the recipe for the meatballs, only substituting Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of fresh) but then I got lazy & cheated Big Time - I used 2 jars of Kroger's sauce instead of making it.
But it turned out amazing!!
(Seriously!)
In fact, it was SO good, we ended up eating WAY too much...
And thus began what is now known as "The Great Spaghetti Coma of 2019" 
15 minutes after we ate, we both fell asleep and didn't move for 14 hours straight!
Delicious

Very good basic recipe, I used two small carrots instead of sugar that was all I changed. We both enjoyed it. Next time I will try Italian sausage in the meatballs and maybe some milk as someone else suggest. They needed something more.

I followed the recipe exactly. It is very good. The only suggestions I have would be to be sure to stir the sauce pre and post meatballs. my sauce and some meatballs started to scorch ever so slightly. Caught it in time! lol Very good recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made the sauce recipe and it was delicious.  It was thicker than I usually make it but this will be my new recipe. The only change I made was in the amount of sugar.  The recipe says one teaspoon but I found that it needed at least two more to please our palates.  :) I suggest that you taste test the sauce and adjust accordingly.

This sauce is super easy and really tasty! I substituted each 28 oz can of whole tomatoes for a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I make big batches of this and freeze it in quart sized bags,  so every time I make pasta, I have sauce on hand.

It was awesome. Other than having to start it really early it is the easiest and tastiest recipe I've used. The meatballs were bought but they were tender and tasty. I love it for a weekend meal.

After reading all of the positive reviews I can say that this recipe did not meet my expectations.  The sauce just tasted like tomato paste... and the meatball were lacking flavor. I added more salt and garlic to the sauce  and more spices to the meatballs but still could not fix it.

This was absolutely delicious! So much great flavor, I was worried about cooking the meatballs in the sauce but now I wont do it any other way. They were so tender! I used oregano instead of basil and half ground beef, half ground pork. Can't wait to make this recipe again!

Meatballs were very bland and sauce was way too sweet. The only thing I had changed was to cut the salt in half because 2 tsp. is way too much for any sauce. I will not make it again.

I made this last night.  I basically doubled the recipe as I had one lb. of beef and one lb. of pork.  I only used one can of tomato paste.  I did not have stale bread so I had to use seasoned bread crumbs.   I baked the meatballs for about half an hour in the oven then plopped them in the sauce.  My meatballs were about 3 inch.  I actually did not do the spaghetti.  I made meatball sandwiches because I had awesome Jersey corn and felt it went better with the sandwiches.  These were the best meatballs I have ever made.   My husband agreed.  I woke up this morning thinking I'd heat some up for breakfast.  But I think I'll wait until lunch.  Forgot to mention that I added a splash of red wine to the sauce.  Definitely two thumbs up!

WOW!!! Even my super picky 6 year old son says it's better than Carabbas! I will never buy jarred sauces again. My wife said they're the best meatballs she's ever had. The only change I make is adding a teaspoon of oregano  and red pepper flakes. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!!

I only added sausage with the beef. Followed the recipe on the rest. I feel like the sauce is missing something, leaning toward the bland side. Needs some zest.  I liked it more than my kids. The final verdict was OK.

This is a really nice, straight-forward recipe. We will use it again, however the next time we will drain the liquid off of one of the two cans of tomatoes.  The sauce made according to the recipe is delish and has a lovely texture, but we'd prefer a tiny touch lower liquid content.

The meatballs and sauce were good.  I think some of the chefs that complained that the meatballs were dry might have used dried breadcrumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs.  I added 1 t of dried basil and fresh garlic to the meatballs.  To the sauce I add more basil and add some oregano and cook it covered for 1 1/2 hrs, and add meatballs and cook 1/2 hr longer.  I use my immersion blender or my hands to crush San Marzano whole tomatoes, also a little red wine 1 cup , Chianti.  Just a few   differences to make it my own.  Thank You for a great recipe.  Also, I add 1 teas.  of salt to the meatballs.

Everyone here really enjoyed this meal. One change-an Italian friend taught me to “toast” the tomato paste with the onion and garlic. Brings out the sweetness in the tomatoes. Then I added the whole tomatoes.

I substituted the parsley for basil. A little too sweet, i would suggest using brown sugar instead of white.

Great basic recipe for sauce and meatballs. 
Add mushrooms, veggies or whatever you want to customize things to your liking. Much better than those quick sauce recipes that have many of the same ingredients but leave out the longer cooking times to make it quick.
Meatballs can use some extra time too. Mix, cover and refrigerate. 2-3 hrs or over night. 
Form into balls and place on a rimmed cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 min and add to sauce when it’s time to add the tomato paste.
I do a 3 to 1 ratio with the meatballs tho. 3 parts ground beef to 1 part Italian sausage and don’t forget to use the fresh breadcrumbs. It keeps the meatballs moist along with the Italian sausage which also bumps up the flavor.

Love this recipe.  I did go 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage.  Added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little something, something extra.  I have made this several times and I adjust the recipe as I want.  Great

Excellent and very simple. I used fresh parsley instead of dried and added basil and a little salt to the meatballs.  I used a small ice cream scoop to create equal sized meatballs. I ended up with twenty or so meatballs but think that the sauce flavored the smaller meatballs better.

Great recipe - I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added Italian seasoning to the sauce.  Made an extra batch of meatballs to freeze for later because they are so good.

Didn't have the cheese so just used cheddar as a topping afterward. Also didn't have the garlic powder so skipped that.

Didn't have cans of whole tomatoes on hand so replaced with two cans of tomatoes and onion braai relish.

Came out superb!

I’m not a fan of the sauce recipe with this, but the meatballs are amazing!  I use a marinara recipe instead. I also cook the meatballs for a bit before adding them. They seemed too mushy when I didn’t.

Wow!  This is my go to spaghetti sauce from now on!  I did have to add an extra egg to my meatball mix because it seemed somewhat dry.  Probably just me.  Also added a splash of Worcestershire and A1 sauce to the mixture.  Threw in a small can of mushrooms at the end, a little oregano/Italian seasoning and good to go.  Fantastic!  Thank you!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made some changes simply because I didn't have a few of the ingredients. I didn't have any Romano cheese, so I decided to forgo cheese entirely. Also, I used dried onion flakes instead of onion powder because that's what I had on hand. My impression is that the ingredients are well balanced, nothing seems to be standing out on the palate that masks other flavors. Hence, flavor will be enjoyed by most of my guests. I will be making this again!

Made it! Sort of. You may as well say it was a different recipe, but this was the inspiration. First, I chopped 1/2lb bacon which needed to be used up. Then, I prepped the meatballs per this recipe while the bacon browned. Spaghetti noodles cooking simultaneously. However, I had no bread crumbs (nor some of the other ingredients), but I did have plenty of Ritz crackers instead. While the bacon was browning, I tossed in the remaining cracker crumbs from a partial roll (barely 1/4 cup), and mixed in a pinch of onion and garlic powders, as well as Parsley, Then, I added the meatballs and 2 jars (24 oz. ea.) of Classico Sweet Basil Spaghetti Sauce. I the added a 1/2lb Braum's Pork Sausage (rolled in balls) by family request and simmered for near 1 hour. (my heat was too low the first 15 minutes). The meatballs were quite soft, but that was actually perfect for me since I have 2 new temporary crowns. So, in using the premade sauce, overall cook time was cut in at least half. I also made garlic toast by lightly spraying butter on bread and placing in toaster. Once removed, sprinkle pinch of garlic powder and salt to taste.
Top spaghetti with Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley for color.

I modified this recipe to use what I had. I didn't have eggs, so I skipped them. I had fresh tomatoes so used twice as much tomato and simmered them for about a day. I followed the advice of Simon and Garfunkle. I added about 2 tea spoons each of dry  "parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" to the meat balls and to the sauce. I doubled everything to feed 12 people. I made some big meat balls like ones I like in Italian restaurants and some small ones like the frozen ones I get at COSTCO and Smart and Final. The little ones work better for a crowd. The big ones work better for me.

My family and I agree that this is the best recipe for "meatballs" we have found.  I haven't made the sauce, as we use a store bought brand, but make the meatballs just like the recipe says, and they are delish!

I made this for a large crowd and it was a HIT! I made extra sauce for the side. I also used diced tomatoes in tomato juice instead of stewed tomatoes. I just threw in extra tomato paste to adjust the consistency. 2 thumbs up!

This was delicious.  I made it for the first time for a group and everyone genuinely and sincerely loved it.  I doubled the recipe so instead of all ground beef I did 1 lb ground beef and l lb mild Italian sausage.  Also used plum tomatoes because that is what I had.  Other than that made exactly as it is.  I was concerned tomatoes wouldn't reduce, but they did, so it necessary to cook as long as the recipe calls for.  Will make again and again!

Very good! I added 1/2 tsp oregano to the sauce and used only one 28 oz can of tomatoes as didn't need a large quantity. Also added a touch of milk (could use water) to the beaten egg to moisten the meat balls as several posts commented they are on the dry side. Crumbed a fresh slice of bread in Vitamix so not too dry there either. Will definitely keep this and make again!

This recipe took a long time to cook, but was easy to make. I followed the recipe, except I took the lid off the pan for a while and let the tomato sauce cook down. My husband loved it, but would have liked it thicker still (he wants it to stick to the pasta better). Oh, I tasted and added a bit more sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. I will definitely be making this again, possibly with more seasoning. We ate half, and I put the other half in a Ziplock for another dinner. Yay! Update - 1-18-19 - I thawed the second half and heated it up tonight. I put it in a large skillet and let it warm uncovered for about 45 minutes. The sauce thickened quite a lot and I'll be making it again. Bumping my rating to a five, now that I know I can thicken the sauce.

The sauce is quite good. But the meatballs were under cooked following this recipe--owing to the three star rating. Next time, I will cook the meatballs and then add them to the sauce.

I’ve made this recipe twice, the second time I made it I fried the meatballs separately in oil. I seasoned the meat with a little bit of sugar, Worcester sauce, and Italian seasoning mix. So good!

Pretty good with a few changes.  I did half ground beef and half ground pork for the meatballs.  I used 2 eggs because the mixture seemed to dry.  I only used one 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes.  2 cans seemed like it would have been too much.  Sauce turned out good.

My original review seems to have disappeared. Anyhow, there is the basis for a good recipe in here but I'm only giving it 3 stars because I feel there are a lot of tweaks needed.

First off, the recipe doesn't instruct to brown the meatballs in the pan first. This is a critical step to a great spaghetti and meatballs as cooking raw meatballs in the sauce will not be as good. Just get a hot pan and brown them on all sides and reserve to finish cooking in the sauce.

There's a bit too much onion, 1/2 cup is plenty and I also feel that the sauce is a bit too thick. I had to add some red wine. Also, the cooking time is a bit exaggerated. This doesn't need 2 hours if your meatballs are browned, 60 minutes in total (30 minutes to thicken and 30 minutes to finish cooking meatballs is enough)

Seasoning is very personal so I won't mention it. Taste your sauce as you make it to find the taste you like. I like a little heat so I added crushed red pepper flakes. I also include fresh basil in my sauce. Good base, but needs a little work to be great.

My absolute go to. I reduce the salt to 1 tsp, and use 1 large can crushed tomatoes and 2 small cans of petite diced tomatoes, but keep the rest true to the recipe. After I made this recipe my husband said that we weren't going back to ready made sauce.

I've made this several times now and it is delicious! I usually make a double batch so I can freeze some for another day. My family raves over it. I do brown the meatballs before putting them in the sauce, I just like them better that way.

I only used the sauce part of this recipe and changed it, so my review may not be helpful but posting so I remember what I did. Added 14 ounces crushed tomatoes, 2 tsp of italian seasoning, an extra tsp each of salt and sugar, and used a handful of fresh basil leaves over dried. This was a great bright marinara sauce that I'm excited to reheat in a few minutes for leftovers

This was amazing! My husband and kiddos ate it right up. I did use a hand blender and blended  just a little before adding meatballs as I don’t prefer bigger chunks of tomatoes, other than that I made as written. Will definitely be making this one more!

This is the first recipe that I have ever used for making homemade spaghetti sauce (I have always just bought the premade stuff off the shelf at the grocery store), and it has been a huge hit!  My children and I don't care for tomato chunks, so I puree the tomatoes in blender before putting them in the pot for the sauce.  Other than that, I follow the recipe as stated.  I have made it about 5 times now and it always turns out great.  
I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because, for my personal taste, I might adjust the salt a bit (add more) and add some basil or oregano for more flavor.  But, the recipe as written is solid and very enjoyable!

I didn’t have whole tomatoes only diced so I used 3 14oz cans. I also seasoned the sauce more, it was a little bland as directed. The meatballs fell apart slightly but were delicious! Loved the meatballs by themselves!

This is an absolutely fantastic sauce. I do it exactly as is, except I use a hand blender before adding in the meatballs to smooth out the sauce. For the meatballs, I put in fresh onion and garlic, and do 1/4 pork to 3/4 90+% fat beef. 

This Irish girl won over her Italian in-laws with this recipe. Thanks, All Recipes!

For the meatballs I put in 1 tsp of garlic and 3 tbsp of Parmesan and browned them in olive oil first. 

The kiddos don’t like big chunks of tomato so I used 2 28 cans of tomato sauce and added 1 green pepper (which I sautéed with the onion/garlic), and also 1 cup of a dry red wine.

Super easy, and absolutely delicious!  The only substitution I made was that I used organic garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  The meatballs burst with flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Loved this recipe, but with half the amount of salt which I figure most people add to their own liking. My very picky 7 year old granddaughter rated them 10 out of 10 and my 11 year old grandson rated them 9 out of 10. I always serve a little tomato sauce on the side for the 7-yr old since she only likes it on the meatballs, but won't let it touch the pasta. She actually added some of her spaghetti to the teacup of this sauce...a first. For those who think there is too much bread, I think they  must have used dry breadcrumbs instead of the fresh called for (2 square pieces of bread, shredded equals one cup of soft crumbs.) The 12 (1.3 oz.) meatballs served four at our house.

I made this the other day and it was by far the best pasta sauce I have ever tasted.
I also made the meatballs but cooked them ahead of time in the oven and then I added them to the sauce the next day.
Wonderful recipe, definitely a keeper!

This recipe is right on .  In fact I doubled it and still was great .  I did chop up can of tomatoes before cooking and also baked my meatballs for 30 minutes at 400 degrees first .  You can’t beat flavor !!

UPDATE TIP: Add the salt and sugar right at the end of cooking this sauce! Why? Because you add the salt and sugar at the start, but then the flavors change with continued cooking and all of a sudden it's not enough salt or sugar. So you add more and cook more, then find yourself adding more salt and sugar as the flavor balance has changed once again. So add the herbs, but not the sugar and salt until the very end, like right before you serve, so you don't increase your salt and sugar intake to unhealthy levels, and you might find that once the tomatoes cook longer, you don't need as much salt and sugar as some tomatoes can be sweet, others watery etc. I make this sauce with Chef John's Italian Meatballs. They go really well together. I double the tomatoes though, and because it's very salty, I add an extra teaspoon of sugar. So I use 4 tins of tomatoes, 4 tsp salt, 4 tsp white sugar. I don't double the oil or the onions or the garlic. I do double the basil and the tomato paste. I once tried doubling the oil, garlic and onion but it didn't improve the flavours. The reason I add more tomatoes is because I have a large family and need more sauce for the meatballs.  I love how easy this recipe is.

These meatballs were divine!  The only thing I did differently was used crushed tomatoes instead of whole and amped up the sugar because I prefer a sweeter sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

I doubled the recipe as I had a kilo of extra lean ground beef and we like to use leftover meatballs and sauce for subs.
I love this method as it is easy, and makes the meatballs so tender and flavourful.
For the meatballs I used 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs as it was what I had, and fresh garlic for the garlic powder.
For the sauce I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp as I am on a low sodium diet. I added celery and mushrooms with the onions as well. The sauce was quite thick so I added some water and tomato sauce that I had.
My family really enjoyed the meatballs and spaghetti!

Good basic recipe..easy to customize to make your own. Due to diet I left the breadcrumbs out of the meatballs (I therefore baked them for 5 mins at 425 to help set up before putting in sauce). I doubled the basil and used a while onion. My husband doesn't like tomato chunks so I lightly pureed the sauce with an immersion blender. Tasted it at the end it was good...but decided to add some basil pesto and red chili peppers to it to suite my need for intense flavors..:)

AWESOME basic spaghetti sauce. Agree that you should substitute half of the tomato soup with crushed tomatoes. It is DELICIOUS :) It's also a great base for adding other flavors and making unique sauces :)

Great recipe....Took some advise of others such as used half pork and half ground beef.  Also used threw in a bunch of fresh parsley (rims and all) into the sauce and pulled it out once sauce was done simmering.   Other than those two adjustments followed as is.

Must confess, I use this recipe for the sauce only (and it's my go to, have tried many sauce recipes throughout the years, and this one comes out great every time) and it's awesome!  I use San Marzano tomatoes and crush them up with a potato masher.

I only used the meatball portion of this recipe and LOVED it!! I've never been a big meat ball fan so I was very excited about how delicious these were! I substituted 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the 1 cup of fresh bread crumbs since we were out of bread and I cooked the meatballs in canned sauce since I didn't have the time or ingredients to make the whole thing. highly recommend these meatballs!!

I made this to go along with some baked ziti (recipe found on this website) and it tastes good. I wasn’t a fan of the whole tomatoes so I used my handheld mixer to blend it up. Made it smooth, creamy and full of flavor!! Thanks!

Great basic sauce and meatball recipe.  People can always add oregano and thyme to the sauce but this recipe is also very good as it is written.

This is the best spaghetti and meatballs I’ve ever had! I make it at least twice a month and it’s a big hit with my four year old son. I think the original recipe is genius and you won’t believe how delicious it tastes and smells when you see how simple it is to make. I do make some minor changes for convenience’s sake: I prefer cans of ground tomatoes with tomato juice added. I skip the tomato paste and add about a cup of water so it’s not too thick. Instead of parsley which I don’t often have on hand I add dried oregano and basil to the meatballs. I add garlic salt instead of garlic powder. I also tend to have no breadcrumbs when I decide to make this recipe so I use multigrain pita bread which I blitz in my blender- instant bread crumbs! I tend to have this in my freezer so I just defrost one or two medium size ones. I find this makes the meatball soft and moist.

I pan fried the meatballs first to give them a little sear, which was a deviation from the actual recipe, but I can't see how one egg is sufficient for binding the meatballs. Mine fell apart as soon as they went into the sauce. The flavors are good though, and it made a decent meat sauce.

Meatballs were very hard but the sauce had a nice flavor. Yes I would make it again but with a different meatball recipe

This is my favorite spaghetti sauce recipe. I brown the meatballs before putting them in the sauce to simmer.

I made the receipt exactly as stated.  The flavor was very good but I preferred it a little more sweet so I added some sugar in the end. It is very easy to make and you can easily adjust for your taste preference.

I only make about half the recipe and I have not made the meat balls yet.  But, I have been making spaghetti sauce all my life and this is the firs recipe both my daughter and wife have had second helpings of and even warmed up the leftovers.  I can only guess it is the absence of oragano that appeals to their pallet.  It does taste different from my no recipe version that I had been cooking all these years.  I am glad they will finally eat my spaghetti.  I will try the meatballs next time.  For know I have been using hot Italian sausage.

It’s so good my mother asked me for the recipe! The only thing I do differently is Brown the meatballs in olive oil before adding to the sauce so I know they are cooked fully and won’t fall apart.

It was great went over really well with the rest of my family!  I actually substituted turkey instead of ground beef because that’s what I had in my house and it tasted great! I also ended up using stewed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and it the sauce turned out great as well! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is amazing!! The only thing I did a little different was that browned the meatballs a little before I let them simmer in the sauce. Pair this with garlic bread and you will not be disappointed.

This is my first Allrecipes review, because I just had to chime in here. This is the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever made (and is in the top 5 I've ever eaten, even at restaurants). The sauce is just perfection. Chunky, flavorful, not too acidic. It's amazing on its own as well, without the meatballs, or with ground beef mixed in.

I made this with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and the meatballs were good.  I thought the sauce was a little too tomatoey, and will try some additional ingredients to cut the plain tomato taste.  I will definitely make again.

I was having a group of 12 guests over and I made lasagna and this recipe. I decided to throw 2 cans of crushed tomatoes in the crock pot while I was finishing the lasagna. I made only a few modifications to this recipe I added a 16 oz. can of plain tomato sauce to the cooked down sauce. I sautéed onions and garlic, transferred some sauce from the crock pot over to add the tomato paste, (2 6oz. cans), and added one tsp. baking soda, one teaspoon honey instead of white sugar. Moved the sautéed mixture into the crock pot. I added fresh parsley sprigs as suggested by another review. I doubled the meatball recipe, added Panko Italian bread crumbs and 1/4 cup milk, refrigerated it until I was ready to bake them 350 for 20 minutes. Added the meatballs to the sauce. Everything turned out delicious!

Made this dish yesterday, EXCELLENT!  The only modification was I used 1/2 lb. of spicy Italian sausage and 1 lb. of ground beef.  I also let it  simmer for 2 hours vs. the one hour.  The flavors were amazing!
When I went to the store for the ingredients, I could not find a 16 oz. can of any type of tomatoes, so I bought a 28 oz. can.  When I cooked the sauce, I only used 16 oz. from the can, intending to freeze the rest.. (I noticed in some of the reviews that others had used a 28 oz. can from the start.)  So when I needed more sauce on Day 2, I just added the other 12 oz. to the mix. BIG MISTAKE! It obviously diluted the sauce, but also lessened the "wow factor" of the first day.  So, my advice: use only 16 oz. of tomatoes and if you need more, start a NEW batch of sauce!

Wow!!!  So yummy.  It'll be hard to go back to  Ragu after this sauce.  I followed the recipe as is and I was hesitant about not cooking meatballs before hand, but it turned out delicious!  It takes a bit of time but otherwise pretty easy to make!  Wonderful!!

I like to add veggies like broccoli and carrots to my meatballs to make this a healthier meal for my son and the family. I also steam the veggies for just a few minutes (3-4) before adding them to the beef. If you decide to do this, I'd also suggest adding a lot more of garlic, oregano, italian spice mix and maybe 1/4 tsp of salt. I also like to add just a little milk to keep the meatballs moist. Then I throw them in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Mangia!

This is a great base recipe to experiment with.  I added baby Bella mushrooms that I ground up in the food processor.  They add some hidden nutrition (no one knows they are there! ) and nice texture and flavor.  I also used a mix of turkey and beef.  For the sauce, I used crushed tomatoes and tomato puree. I was short on time and just added dried chopped onion instead of fresh.  The results were delish! Sometimes I also add carrots that I pulverized in the food processor for added sweetness and nutrition.  I will be using this recipe again for sure!

I added a little more salt, smashed the tomatoes a bit muscle way through cooking and spooned some of the oil out when it was done. It was excellent will definitely make it again, sooooo much better than jarred sauces.

We really did like this. Did not change anything. The sauce was smooth in the sense that it was not overly spicy. We do like spicy but not all the time. It went well with the meatballs and sausages could easily be added. My husband loved it.  Will definitely make again. Used "Giuseppe Russo" whole tomatoes for the first time in this recipe and will never use another brand again.

I would give this twenty stars!!! I made it in the crockpot, adding the paste,meat, and pepper for one hour after seven hours on low. The only thing I did differently, I added sweet Italian sausages, cut in half. I served it over ziti with Italian bread for dipping. Hands down the best sauce I ever had. And my grand mother is from the old country!

This recipe is simply fantastic. I prepared it for my boyfriend and we were both sighing with delight. For the meatballs, I used a 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 ground pork mixture, added an extra tablespoon of parmesan cheese, and substituted real garlic for garlic powder. I was worried about cooking the meatballs directly in the sauce, but it totally works and adds really lovely flavor overall. I would say that, if you have the time to execute this recipe fully, it is totally worth it and will ruin your affinity for sauce in a can forever!

I used fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden and it turned out so good. This was my first time making meatballs and we all really liked them! I will make this again!

This recipe was great.  A lot of flavor and meatballs came out very tasty and moist. I made a couple minor changes.  My husband like spicy spaghetti and meatballs so I used half ground beef and half mild sausage.  I used two 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes and one 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also used fresh parsley for the meatballs and fresh basil for the sauce and added a little Italian seasoning to both.  My husband raved about this dish! It's a keeper!

I have been trying to replicate the meatballs my mother used to make, so I have been searching for recipes that I think might have been like hers. I do remember that she used fresh bread, so this recipe caught my eye. The first time I tried it, I followed the recipe, but the meatballs were much harder and drier than I liked. So the second time I took someone's advice and soaked the fresh bread crumbs in 1/2 cup of milk. This did the trick, I am pleased. I also added a little extra garlic powder. I would make them again. The sauce was also very good as is.

I found the meatballs to be seriously lacking in flavor.  I'd recommend cutting back on the bread crumbs (perhaps 3/4  cup) and increasing the spices. Maybe instead of just all ground beef you could add some ground pork too.

Fantastic sauce recipe! Just made the sauce since I already had some chicken meatballs. My slight changes included adding an extra Bayleaf,  substituting the dried basil for Italian seasoning and adding a couple pinches of crushed red pepper because we like our sauce a little spicy! Such an easy and delicious recipe, will definitely make again!

Followed it exactly as it is except for one small change. I browned the meatballs in olive oil before putting them into the sauce. Would make this over and over again!

Very good! Changes one review suggested. Brown meatball (10 min baked) and use veal too. Simmer sauce on low for longer. I  used crushed tomatoes.  Less salt. Little more sugar. Added all ingredients at the same time. Meatballs: added Italian seasoning and more Parm cheese. The recipe is good as written. I just added my personal preferences.

Pretty much followed the recipe as is. One thing i did change was using diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled (cause thats what I had on hand). Halfway thru the three hour simmer (another change based on another reviewers recommendation) I turned off the burner, let it cool for a bit, then threw it in my blender for a smoother sauce. I was a bit skeptical about just adding the raw meatballs into the sauce but they cooked up just fine. I think next time I make this I will do something to the meatballs to jazz them up a bit. I will probably also add some type of mushroom to the sauce. Served this with a french bread recipe also on this site, and a green salad.

I've made this my new go-to sauce. It has a wonderful full flavor and is very authentic tasting. The only substitution for me is that I use puree instead of whole or diced tomatoes because one kid in my family will relentlessly pick out the tomato bits when I make it that way. It's better tasting the way the recipe calls for whole tomatoes, or with diced as I have also tried, but the puree keeps me sane!

We made this sauce for our Cub Scout Blue and Gold Banquet.  I had made this before for my picky eater grandsons and when they all loved it I knew it would work for Cub Scouts.  Using allrecipes modifer, I modified it for 100 people.  I did leave out the bay leaves, I didn't want to have to try to find 20 bay leaves before serving.   Everyone loved it and wanted to know what brand it was.   I thought it was missing something and realized it was the bay leaves.    Excellent sauce, easy to make and loved by all.  I have made the meatballs before for my family and everyone loved them too.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This was very nice. Just what I had in mind when I decided that I wanted to make a meatball dish with a rich tomato sauce. I did add some red wine which i reduced once the onions and garlic had cooked I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of vinegar. All other seasoning/herbs i threw in on gut feel to our own tastes. My concerns, like others, over not browning the meat before cooking were unfounded and the meatballs were perfect. It's going in our book!.

Minus the tomato paste this would have been a better recipe, too much tomato flavor with it, besides that very good.

This is wonderful--easy to make and delicious!! It's a favorite and we've made it a half dozen times. The recipe is outstanding as written, but we made a few changes. First, instead of canned whole tomatoes, we use tomato puree.  We also cut the garlic from 5 cloves to 2 cloves. Finally, we use fresh basil (if available) instead of dry. Love this! It's on our permanent rotation.

This was life changing. Thanks so much! I followed the recipe exactly, I just doubled the garlic powder since we are big time garlic lovers. Super easy!

I'm not sure why I haven't gotten on here sooner to rate this recipe but it gets nothing less than a 5 star. I've made this for family gatherings as pasta is simply a comfort food for our family. it's a monthly recipe in our home. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe, I soaked the breadcrumbs in milk before hand but other than that it was loved by all, husband and four kids. I think cooking directly on the sauce without browning first makes them more moist and flavourful. Will always use this method from now on.

I really liked this recipe, but it was a little too salty for me. Will definitely make it again but cut down on the salt. I also used 2 cloves of garlic as I like a little less.  Otherwise very good and the meatballs cooked in the sauce were delicious.

I made the sauce only of this recipe (to have with chicken parmesan).  It was very good, and I am writing a review to remind myself to make it again.  I doubled the recipe and have some in the freezer now.  I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, and I was sure we would want a little more seasoning.  First, I didn't have 4 big cans of whole tomatoes, so I used 1 (28 oz) can whole, 1 (28 oz) can crushed, and 4 (14 oz) cans various diced tomatoes.  I also added ~1 tsp or so Italian seasoning mix and ~1/2 tsp garlic powder before the first simmer.  Then I added an additional 1.5 tsp oregano along with the basil and pepper before the second simmer.  I thought it was a little sweet and probably won't add quite as much sugar next time (although this seems like so little), but it's definitely a keeper, and I will certainly make it again.

This is a really great recipe! I will never go back to jar sauces again. Slight changes I made, I used half ground beef and half ground pork for the meatballs. I used twice as much garlic and onions, as we are want to do here in New Orleans. When I added the meatballs I also added 1 tsp Oregano. Next time I will use 1 can of whole tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Really flavorful sauce! I've never cooked meatballs that way, I usually brown them first, but they came out so tender and yummy! Try this one in case you ever have to cook for a bunch of guys one day all sleeping on mattresses. (Yes, that was a Godfather reference;)

My go-to recipe for spaghetti! I use about half of the olive oil and bake the meatballs at 350 for 15 minutes, flip and do another 15 minutes. Soooo yummy.... I've made this at LEAST 50 times!

Wow, delicious!
We used Italian seasoning and two cans of crushed tomatoes, with 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1 can of tomato paste.  Next time we will try the meat balls instead of using our premade that we had in the fridge.

This is truly the best sauce ever!! I make it exactly as written, but I make 1 1/2 to a double recipe to feed all my troop always using 2 lbs of ground beef. They LOVE it, even my dear hubby who is on the picky side. I do use varying types of tomatoes, sometimes whole or sometimes crushed, today I have a mix of whole, crushed and tomato sauce bc that's what I had on hand. It's never made a difference in the sauce. Always super delish! I put the meatballs in the sauce raw exactly as written and that is what makes this sauce rich and so yum! Try it, you won't be disappointed! It's the only sauce I make when doing meatballs now :)

Everyone loved it! 4 stars because next time I will make the following changes: Italian tomatoes and a dash of baking soda to cut the acidity. Also the meat balls were huge!! Not a bad thing for us but I could see this recipe serving up to 8 with smaller meat balls.

Only change i made was adding a little bit more sugar and simmering it at least 4-5 hours. It thickens up that way! Best  sauce I had ever made!

I liked this recipe for the sauce.  I used an old favorite meatball recipe that I loved but wanted a nice sauce to go with it.  This was simple and good.  I baked my meatballs (large) for 30 minutes and added them to this sauce for another 30.  I used one can of crushed and one can of whole tomatoes and the result was scrumptious.

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I have made it several times for my family and it is a winner each time. The simmering is vital to the flavor so don't rush it like I did my first time.

I am giving the sauce 5 stars.  I have my favorite recipe for meatballs that I use for that, but this is the sauce that I love.  Make it as listed with absolutely no changes.  Please understand that I've never tried it with the meatballs in the recipe, but I also imagine that you cant go wrong with it. Yummers.

This is a family favorite.  Truly the best spaghetti & meatballs ever.  I often use ground turkey meat instead of beef.  I've also used bread crumbs out of the package instead of making my own...its all good.  Serve with a green salad and some garlic bread - you can't go wrong.

Did'not make any changes.  Hubby liked it a lot, but he loves everything I have made for him  from Allrecipies.com. I felt the meatballs were bland and very dry. I will make it again but will make some changes.

This has become my go to recipe for sauce and always keep the canned tomatoes on hand just in case. I was worried about cooking the meatballs right in the sauce but they cooked through perfectly and added a wonderful flavor to the sauce. The only difference when we make it is to use a meatloaf mix vs. just ground beef (beef, pork, veal) for the meatballs and for tomatoes we do a combo of whole and crushed.

I doubled the recipe as a whole. I double the amount of parmesan cheese and garlic powder in the meatballs. I also used fresh parsley in the meatballs. Remember 3 times fresh to replace the dried herbs. Dried herbs have a stronger flavor. Also I did follow the recipe and used fresh bread crumbs but pulsing some very fresh rolls in my food processor. I used fresh basil in the sauce. Again, three to one when replacing fresh with dry herbs. Cooking the meatballs in the sauce is a must. They come out so tender as opposed to cooking in the oven or in a frying pan. Awesome!!

I can only rate meatballs since I used jar sauce. I didn't have enough parsley so I substituted Italian seasoning and I added onion powder. I also added milk.

By far the best recipe for meatballs I have ever made! I actually don't do it for 90 mins, I do it for 45 and then 30 with the meatballs like instructed, the meatballs are full of flavor and fall apart in your mouth. 5 stars!

This recipe is delicious! I made just the sauce part, cheated & used frozen meatballs. Either way it was great. First time I had made sauce from scratch. I've tried little things, such as adding more garlic and using 2 cans of tomato paste to make it a little thicker. Will use this recipe again & again!

Great recipe. Made this a few times and it’s always best when you put together fresh meat balls. Tried premade meatballs from Sprouts, and they just fell apart in the sauce. Also, I will sear the meatballs before adding them to the sauce and they turn out fantastic. Enjoy.

This is as awesome as it is simple. I fried the meatballs first in the dutch oven that I then used to cook the tomato sauce.  I also used 4 fresh roma tomatoes in place of one can of tomatoes. So fresh, tasty.

I make this in the crockpot and it's pretty tasty. I always brown my meatballs before adding to a sauce - browning the meat adds extra flavour. I have made this twice, the first time using the ingredients listed served with pasta and it got a solid 4* rating. The second time I was making a healthier dinner so used turkey mince, less bread crumbs and served it with a salad. Due to making it the first time as is I also knew to add some more spices and herbs as well as increasing the amount of garlic for added flavour for the second time around, so it was probably a combination of those additions as well as using turkey that gives my adjusted version a 5* rating. Will be making again.

It needs way more spice in the meatballs, and something needs to be done to tone down the tangy-ness of the sauce.

I've made these meatballs a few times now, and I LOVE them! I don't make any changes, other than sometimes adding real minced garlic. Plus, I use ground turkey. Lol But they come out tender and perfect every time. I was always so afraid to make meatballs before, cuz they sounded like so much work. Very happy I found this recipe!
Also, I now use this recipe as a base for meatloaf, too. Just add some extra seasoning and brown gravy in the mixture and on top. My husband raved! Thank you so much.

This was awesome! I was nervous about cooking the meatballs in the sauce, but they turned out so tender & delicious! I used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs instead of 1 cup. Instead of basil I added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning.

Was SO delicious.  The meatballs were incredibly tender and the sauce had a warm garlic, freshness.  Took a solid two hours to make...but is good for a Sunday afternoon meal.  Freeze half the sauce for an easy dinner later in the week too!

I love making this meat ball and sauce. Best I've  had. Just maybe not use so much sugar. And the second time I made it I let me meat balls simmer with the sauce. We ate  them as a meatball sub. Yummmm

I added some additional oregano.  I like the smell of oregano in the air and I did not smell it with the original recipe.  Other than that, I was s pleased with the sauce and the meatballs.  Two healthy college baseball players also gave it a thumbs up.

This was an amazing recipe!! I couldn't get over how easy it was to prepare. The only changes I made were...1. I substituted crushed tomatoes in place of whole tomatoes  2. I added an additional can of tomato sauce  3. I added sweet Italian sausage and a green pepper. This meal was delicious!! Oh, I also soaked the seasoned breadcrumbs in 2/3 cup of milk. The meatballs were so yummy!!! I will definitely make this recipe again and again!!

Made as is and liked it, but the meatballs could use more seasoning/salt. Also, next time I will substitute a 28 ounce can of peeled tomatoes for a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.

This was a good sauce. Quite flavorful if a bit oily. I was a bit worried about using whole peeled tomatoes but they cooked apart nicely. I made more than 12 meatballs from the meat because I wanted smaller more bite-sized ones. Unfortunately, it didn't "wow" me enough to be worth the time and effort to cook over easier sauces, so I won't be making it again, but it does have a nice flavor and I'd recommend trying it at least once.

So, this has become "my" sauce and I almost cry every time I make it because it is soooooooooo good. There is no way I will every buy jar sauce again. The recipe is fairly simple, but incredibly delicious.  I also found using brand name tomatoes (I use Cento San Marzano) vs store brand makes a huge difference.

I made the meatballs with ground turkey.  They were delicious!  I did think that you could probably cut out one of the cans of the whole tomatoes though, and maybe add some marinara sauce or something?  Otherwise it's ALL tomatoes!!

This turned out great.  I added some oregano and a little more sugar.  I have made spaghetti sauce for years but never meatballs.  This is a keeper.

I didn't change a thing and the family *loves* it. I sometimes cook for my 2-3 adult brothers (#3 is rarely in town, so he doesn't count for much) and my elderly mother on family dinner night and this is a huge hit.

Meatballs never work for me - done in a pan, mine are always undercooked in the centre - and I had my doubts about the cooking time, but they were perfectly done.

It takes a little extra time in prep, but I make lots and it saves me from having to cook again later in the week!.

I didn't make the meatballs with this recipe, as I wanted to try the Meatballs Nirvana recipe on this site and needed an easy spaghetti sauce to go with it. I wanted something not overly spicy or aromatic so the flavor of the meatballs would come through and this sauce was it! Very tasty without overpowering, perfectly complimented the meatballs. I will make this again.

I think I like this sauce better than the other I've made before.  The meatballs weren't as good as the nirvana recipe, though, more like meatloaf (still "good").  Made true to recipe, no changes.
This time I made it true to recipe (sauce), doubled recipe but also added 1 lb. baby portabello mushrooms, nirvana meatballs made ahead and frozen.  Thru meatballs in crockpot while making sauce, then added sauce which needed another 20 or so min. Simmering.  Low heat for @ 4 hrs.

Amazing recipe. I was skeptical not cooking the meatballs  before placing them in the sauce. It was great. Delicious meal. I did not change a think in the recipe and it came out great.

This recipe was fantastic- made my husband so happy! I added Italian seasoning and a little salt to the meatballs to up the flavor (personal preference). The sauce was out of this world - so much better than what I usually buy from a jar! I can't wait to make this dish again!

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making homemade spaghetti sauce.  It turned out wonderful. My boys, who are not huge fans of spaghetti, loved it.  It tasted much better than any sauce from a jar.  I made a few modifications of my own and based on feedback in the reviews.  I added 1/4 cub red wine (Cabernet), 2-3 more garlic cloves, and browned 1/4lb ground pork and 1/4lb ground beef with the garlic and onion before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.

This is a staple recipe in our house. I've made it several times and honestly, I'm not much of a beef eater, but I make it with ultra lean ground beef and I LOVE how the meatballs turn out every time!

Hi
The meatballs came out very delicious and cooked well. 
I used minced lamb, 400 gms of tomato purée instead of all the tomatoes, added 4 tbsp of sweet chilli dressing to give it a little twist. 
Added 3 tbsp of balsamic vinegar too as it was too intensely tomatoey (if you know what I mean)

Used the same sauce for vegetarian version too with broccoli, French beans, cottage cheese squares.

Great first time meatballs' recipe for me.

I made the sauce without the meatballs.  Really good sauce!  I doubled the basil and added an equal amount of oregano, but other than that, made as directed.  Delicious!

It's a very good base recipe. This was a bit salty and a bit mild. Better after adjusting it to my tastes.
Second batch I added sautéed chopped onions and garlic, a little fresh basil, oregano, red pepper flakes and doubled the Parmesan to the meat. Used 2 cans no salt added tomatoes and only 1 tsp salt.  Added extra fresh basil, onion, garlic and some red pepper flakes to the sauce.

I made this as written once and it was great. Now I use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, and a can do diced tomatoes. Then one pkg of turkey sweet Italians and 1 lb of ground turkey with all the meatball ingredients and the chopped onion. Make these meatballs and cook in the sauce. Excellent!!

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and it was a BIG hit! I'm giving it 4 stars only because it was a little too tomatoey for me initially but it was a super easy adjustment to get it like I personally like it (tiny bit of vinegar). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly how it was written and will continue to do so. There were no leftovers so I've been asked to cook it again in the next few days! Thanks so much for sharing it!!!

This is quite possibly the best Italian meatball recipe I've ever had. Big hit at my house! My husband requested I make it again this week before he even finished his second plate! Tip: the longer you simmer the sauce - the better! So good!

The sauce was good but the meatballs, not so much. I had to completely change ingredients and measurements. If you make it like this, they are bland and way too "bread crumby."

I followed the suggestions of many other reviewers. For the meatballs, I used 1 lb. 93% ground turkey and 1 lb. mild Italian sausage turkey and seasoned  breadcrumbs and let the breadcrumbs soak in about 3/4c of milk BEFORE adding them to the meat and baked in 350 for 20 minutes. For the sauce, I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes so used 2 cans crushed tomatoes instead.I added two small cans of tomato sauce. With the the basil, I also used italian seasoning too.

I made this just as the recipe states and was blown away by how good it was! My husband says this needs to be a weekly meal! My 17 month old kept asking for more sauce! lol I was nervous that the meatballs wouldn't be done, but sure enough they were! Make this, you won't regret it!

Very good recipe; I used Purnell's ground Italian sausage in lieu of ground beef, which also saved time because I was able to leave out the spices in the meatball recipe.  My six year old cleaned the plate. Excellent serves with garlic bread.

So easy and tasty.  I like it b/c I don't always have fresh herbs on hand but I have dried.  I didn't have whole tomatoes but I subbed two cans of diced (14.5 oz) and two cans tomato sauce (15 oz).  Turned out great!  The whole family enjoyed it!

I really loved this recipe. For my household however, the whole tomatoes didn't cook down enough so I had to put the sauce in the blender.  Next time I'll try crushed tomatoes.  My husband said the only thing wrong with the meatballs was that there weren't enough.  lol  Definite keeper!!!

This was my first attempt at a scratch spaghetti and meatballs.  Like others who have posted I had some apprehension to add the meatballs raw to the sauce but I followed the recipe and it came out amazing.  I'll be making this many times...thanks for the great website to find new and exciting recipes.

Very tasty, very comforting. Only complaint I have is that it is a bit too chunky. I think I will use half as many full tomatoes next time and use some tomato sauce instead. Overall, a really good recipe

I initially made the sauce exactly as stated and thought it was okay at best. It was too acidic, even with an extra 1.5 t. of sugar added at the end. It tasted a bit bland to me, also. I broiled the meatballs 7 minutes each of the top and bottom sides, which helped make them stick together and a bit more done on the outside, but still juicy on the inside. I thought it was too much work for only an average tasting sauce.

I've made this recipe since I was a kid.  This is almost exactly like my Grandmother from Italy made meatballs and sauce.  Everyone seems to have Americanized Italian sauce and meatballs.  There are NO green peppers, raisins, onions, etc. in authentic meatballs.  The simpler the better!!!!

I doubled the sauce and increased the meatballs by 50% to make enough. Otherwise it makes a small pot. I always adjust seasonings to taste, but these are a good starting point.

Very good. Very soft and tender meatballs. I took the advice of others and added more seasonings to the meatballs and the sauce. I used half seasoned breadcrumbs and half fresh breadcrumbs, also added a little milk. I lightly browned meatballs in skillet and then transferred with drippings to sauce and simmered covered with sauce for 30 minutes. They were done and really tender and moist. Maybe add some Italian herb seasoning and red pepper flakes next time. 
Thanks for a great recipe and the reviews/suggestions that accompany it.

Very good.  Have been searching for a new meatball recipe and this is it.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground sausage, which is a personal preference.  You won't be disappointed with this one.

I made this in my slow cooker in the morning so it could cook all day on low. I put the meatballs and Italian sausage in it at that time too. The flavor the sauce got from the meat cooking in it was delicious. I used two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes, one 28 can of tomato sauce and two cans of tomato paste. I also cut the garlic back to two cloves and found that was plenty for us. I left out they bay leaf. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Used my own meatball recipe. But used the sauce with some alterations for extra veggies for the kiddos.

Added: 1 chopped red/orange/green pepper; 1/4 bunch parsley chopped; 3 stalks celery chopped; 3/4 cup chopped carrots; 3 dashes Allspice;  1/2 tsp Oregano; 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning

This is an excellent recipe.  I'm actually going to make this tomorrow with my abundance of tomatoes fresh from the garden and preserve.  The only thing i do different is add in a good amount of fresh herbs.   There aren't enough herbs/spices in this recipe for my liking, but that's an easy fix and of course - very subjective.

I made this with turkey meatballs and the meat most definitely was not done after 30 minutes. I puréed the tomatoes and this sauce was scrumptious

Cooking the meatballs this way resulted in the most tender & juicy meatball I've ever made. I doubt I'll ever brown or bake them again.

Amazing!!! Although I didn't see the comments until I was already in the middle of cooking it. I would recommend some salt in the meat ball mix as they're a little bland. The sauce is GREAT...The boyfriend approved :-).

The family enjoyed it, there was only  5 of us but I thought it needed more sauce as most of the liquid evaporates during cooking. Also I found that there was a lot of fat floating on the top after the meatballs had cooked. Next time I will cook them off first and dispose of the excess fat before putting them  into the sauce.

Meatballs ONLY!  I have not made the sauce because I like using my own.  Before this recipe for meatballs mine were, well, meat shapes.  I first made the recipe as is then started to add different seasonings to better fit my family's pallet.  The original recipe is good on it's own.  This is a very easy recipe to execute.

I would add a few more seasonings to the meat and cook the meatballs for a bit before putting them in to simmer.

First time making meatballs and they turned out great.  No change to the recipe.   I did learn that you can take sliced bread and put into a food processer to get fresh bread crumbs.   Worked perfectly.

I rarely ever rate recipes but this one is worth rating.  So flavorful and easy to make.  No more Prego or Ragu for us.  This was so quick to make and had the flavor I have been craving but was unable to find in a jar.  Love it!  Thanks for an awesome and simple recipe.

Loved this recipe. I used veal instead of regular beef And covered the finish product in mozzarella but other than that I used the recipe verbatim and was very pleased. The meatballs where not dry at all contrary to some reviews. Maybe it was because I used veal instead.

I was hesitant to put uncooked or browned meatballs into the sauce, but it turned out great! I also added italian sausage to the sauce base, just because i had some in the fridge that needed to be used. also added a little extra Italian seasoning. it was delicious.

This recipe tasted just like my Italian mother's meatballs and sauce!  She would add beef neck bones that were browned and added in the sauce to simmer.  However, I have a hard time finding neck bones, so I add a small steak that has a bone or a small bone-in beef shank. Brown the steak first and then add to the sauce to simmer.  Add browned meatballs later and do not over cook the meatballs in the sauce.  Delicious recipe!  Thanks for the recipe! Robin

I made this recipe exactly as written. Meatballs were too dry and bland. I could really taste the breadcrumbs.  I did like the fact that no pre-cooking of the meatballs was required.  The sauce was just ok.  Not a whole lot of flavor,except for the pepper, which was the only spice I could taste. It needs more italian seasoning.

This is my favorite sauce recipe by far, very traditional and a great base for customizing. The key is to use high quality canned tomatoes. I always use Muir Glenn Organic while peeled tomatoes. Other less expensive brands I've tried have been lacking flavor and that nice chunky texture.

Everyone loved it!!  I did it gluten free.  I used udiS gluten free bread (millet and chia) to make the fresh bread crumbs and the meatballs were wonderful and moist.  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of whole.  It was outstanding!!!

Oh my!! This is the recipe my Italian friends have kept secret from me!  We thought it was amazing.  The recipe is great as is---we thought the meatballs were perfect.  My family complained that I did not make enough meatballs.  My only additional was a bit of red wine because all wine drinkers know-- wine goes with everything!  ?? thanks to you, Jeremy and your mom for sharing a fabulous recipe!

My nephew loved the sauce. I used diced tomatoes, tomatoe paste and tomatoe sauce. I added Italian sausage to the sauce to make a meat sauce. I also used turkey meatballs.

The sauce was fabulous!!!!  The meatballs were not the best I've ever made, but definitely good. I would give the meatballs a 4 star.  The meatballs need a bit more flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I was really surprised that the meatballs stayed together.  That being said, next time I am going to cut back on the bread crumbs as the meatballs were almost too sturdy.  Also, using whole tomatoes is a big no-no when you have picky eaters in the family.  Right before I put the meatballs in the sauce, I pureed the tomatoes in a blender for a couple of seconds.  Tasted delicious and the kids ate it!

This is definitely a 5 star spaghetti sauce as is. It has been my favorite go to recipe for years. On occasion when I don't have time to make meatballs, I just add 1 to 2 lbs ground beef and put in 1 tablespoon each of parsley and Parmesan cheese in to the sauce. I always use a wooden spoon to stir any tomato based sauce (as recommended by an Italian friend) as metal or plastic can transfer a funny taste due to acidity in tomatoes. I use agave instead of sugar. I slow cook it for 3 to 4 hours on low after I reduce it some as the whole tomatoes are full of water and can make it a tad runny (without reducing). I always triple the batch and when it is cooled off I put in gallon freezer bags for the days we want a home cooked dinner and don't have much time. I love making either homemade French bread or focaccia bread with this spaghetti. Wonderful!

I must say...I have been searching for a meatball recipe that will satisfy my rather picky (when it comes to meatballs) husband and THIS IS IT!  My eight year old said it was the best recipe she's had in months :-), and I loved it!  I think the key may be the homemade sauce which was simple but delicious and infused with the meatball flavor.   I admit that I actually joined allrecipes just to rate this one- it is my first review though I frequent the site.   I am not an expert chef so did not dare make any major changes except that I omitted the sugar and the tomato paste as we don't like sweet sauces and I added some salt to the meatball mix; so if you are like me in disliking sweetness, well, then don't add sugar or paste!   Otherwise I followed directions- I did not pre-cook the meatballs but added directly to the sauce as specified and they turned out perfectly.  This would make a great make ahead meal too.  I have found my spaghetti and meatball recipe- thanks!

Really good!!!! Incredible flavor and smells! The only 2 things I would change would be split the meatballs into smaller portions (obviously cut cooking time) and add some red chili flakes to the oil before adding onions for some spice...

This is the first time I made my own spaghetti sauce. It was so easy I will never again buy sauce from a jar! While I had tried making homemade meatballs in the past, it was time consuming so I rarely made homemade meatballs. Not the case with this recipe. Form the meatballs and add them to the meat sauce in the slow cooker. They were delicious and so easy to make. This recipe is a keeper! I think the meatballs and sauce were even better when warmed up for left overs a couple days later. Yum!

I LOVE this recipe. I had never made meatballs or sauce from scratch before I tried this, but now I make it about once a month. Delicious. My only complaint is the consistency of the sauce. I usually only use 1 can of whole tomatoes and use a can of crushed for the 2nd. I read of another reviewer who blended a portion of the tomatoes before adding the paste and meatballs, and I think I'll try that next time for a better texture. But meatballs and taste can't be beat!

I just want to say WoW! I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil(no carcinogens) I used organic stevia instead of sugar. Panko bread crumbs , & substituted milk for the egg in the meatballs to keep them more moist. This is an incredible recipe that will be made over and over again !

My picky 6 year old loves this recipe and so does the rest of the family. It takes a few hours but is worth the wait. I made too many meatballs the first time but froze the leftovers and made them bigger this time. I always add more garlic and onions than the recipe calls for, too...Some people say its bland but adding more garlic, onion and Italian seasoning is a must.Mushrooms taste great in the sauce,  too.This is my favorite pasta dinner by far. We love it!

This was wonderful-just like my mom used to make, except she added sauce to make enough to freeze. She always told me that you didn't have to brown the meatballs because they would cook in the sauce.  Thank you Jeremy!

Really 4 1/2.  The only thing I did to make it my favorite was to split half lean ground beef, and half ground pork.  Don't listen to those people who say to brown the meatballs before putting in the sauce.  NOT browning them allows the flavors of the sauce to really get in there.  We are a carnivore family, so I took the other half pounds of beef and pork, and browned them with the onion and garlic to start the sauce.  Other than that, this was excellent.  I have no idea why anyone would want to buy store bought pasta sauce.  This is too easy, and tastes much, much, much fresher.

I followed the instructions almost exactly. I wanted smaller meatballs, so I ended up with 20. I had diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning on hand so I used those instead of the whole ones. The only other difference was that once my husband and I were raving over this on hoagie rolls as a wonderful meatball sandwich, I realized that I forgot the tomato paste at the end. We had plenty of leftovers so I added most of the can afterwards. We had it with noodles the next day and both agreed that it had too much tomato flavor for us. That's our preference though, so this recipe still gets a solid 5 stars. In the future, I will omit the tomato paste. Other than that, this was fabulous! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious dish! I am regularly not a fan of tomato sauces, but this is a beautiful sauce. I used whole tomatoes and blended them a little after they were cooked because my bf is not a fan of whole tomatoes. Turned out great! I also made meatballs out of pork/beef mix with fresh bread crumbs and a little bit of milk - nice and juicy. Used someone else's suggestion to coat the meatballs in flour before adding them to the sauce. Loved the dish! Will try to cook more next time, so I can freeze some of the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

excellent! I made the recipe exactly as it reads and everything was perfect. I was nervous not browning the meatballs first, but they added a great flavor to the sauce and were very juicy. Next time I may spice it up with some other seasoning and veggies but was wonderful as it! thank you for sharing!!

The sauce is amazing....my 8yr old son said it was the best he has ever had.  Made the meatballs with 1/2 beef 1/2 pork and just didn't trust to not cook them in the oven 1st.  But now after reading a few reviews sounds like it would have made the sauce even more amazing

Nice, but the meatballs were a little too moist for me, almost mushy.  Not sure what I did wrong.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used Ezekiel bread to make the meatballs for a healthier choice. We had another family over for a dinner party - their kids ages 4 and 2 were asking for seconds! And in my opinion, if the kids like it it, it must be good! It was a hit with my husband and kids as well. Good bye Ragu and Prego! The only downfall to this recipe is the time it takes to simmer the sauce. But it's not like you can't be doing something else while that's going on. So if you have the time this recipe is a must!

My husband is Italian, and we decided to try this recipe just for the meatballs, and with slight modification.  He and the rest of the family loved it!  We didn't have breadcrumbs on hand, so we substituted with crumbled saltine crackers.  We also added 1 mild Italian sausage to the 1 lb ground beef.  The Italian sausage definitely adds great flavor!!  We made the meatballs a little smaller, so they would soak up the sauce (our own) better.  Delicious!

This is now my go-to recipe! I do make double or more because it freezes well, and do the meatballs separately, bake and freeze in freezer bags. It freezes better that way, meatballs don't fall apart.  The only changes I make to the meatballa are to sub pork for 1/3 of the beef, and add a bit of milk to the meatball mixture for moisture.  For the sauce I halve the tomato paste and like to add some other herbs sometimes, especially parsley and marjoram or oregano, but I let the basil carry the flavor.  The sauce is good on it's own, but REALLY good once simmered with the meatballs.  I made around 10 pints of sauce today, meatballs last week.

This was one of my first times making homemade meatballs and pasta sauce.  The sauce turned out very acidic and I didn't know what to add to fix that.  The meatballs were good but a little too dry.

Lots of bad reviews for the meatballs, so I used Kittencal's "Italian-Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meatballs because I knew those were good.  Not enough sauce to cover the meatballs.  Sauce was so-so.

Made this a few times.  The latest was the best! I kept the sauce virtually the same, except I had fresh basil and so I used it (3x fresh to dried ratio).  Meatballs-- I did 1/2 lean ground beef, 1/2 italian sausage.  I added 1 T fresh thyme, 4.5 T fresh parsley (because they were on hand), 1/2 c. ital bread crumbs and 1/2 c. panko-- again, because that's just what I had..  I did sear the meatballs before adding to the sauce-- but I've cooked without searing, and without the other changes, and it's just a lovely sauce.  Kids & hubby loved it.  And it freezes well.

Play with this recipe-- you won't be disappointed!

This was pretty good, I followed alot of others recommendations, such as using pork and beef, adding a little liquid to the meat to keep it moist, and cooking the meatballs before adding them to the sauce.

I have not made the meatballs but this is my go to recipe for sauce.  Jarred sauce is dead to me now :0)
   I don't add salt to my sauce and I have been cutting back on the EVOO, but this one is great as written.  Enjoy!

Great recipe. I made this just as it stated and it turned out wonderful. I added a little bit more parmesan cheese but besides that it was great on its own. I was worried about not cooking the meatballs first but they cooked perfectly in the sauce. I will make these again for sure. No need to buy premade meatballs when these are so easy.

I was very suspicious of a recipe with so few ingredients. How in the world could something so simple taste so divine?!?  This was a simple, yet delicious recipe that we make often.  The only change I make is to do 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 sweet Italian sausage.  Otherwise, everything is as stated.  A family favorite!

My first time making homemade spaghetti sauce, and my second time making meatballs.... SOOO glad I attempted this recipe, it was delicious! I omitted the bay leaf only because every time I've bought bay leaves for a recipe, I use one, and the rest go to waste. Will definitely be making this again, and again. Thank you for a great recipe, and helping build my confidence in cooking!

UPDATE: I made this with ground turkey instead this time, and used tomatoes I canned from our garden the previous season. AMAZING AGAIN! The turkey meatballs were much more soft, but still held together well. Oh, I also make 24 instead of 12 because they were huge otherwise.

This was fantastic. I used fresh Roma tomatoes and basil from my garden and made a giant pan of it - enough for 4 meals. I froze three of them and anxiously looking forward to an easy, delicious meal this winter.

Tried it last night for dinner. It was so yummi. You can add some crushed red pepper if you prefer a spicy taste and not a sweet taste. I didn't think it was too sweet.

I made the meatballs and sauce exactly as the recipe except I enlarged the batch so that I made enough sauce and meatballs to freeze for later date.  Our grandchildren challenged my husband and I to a spaghetti and sauce cook off...I used this recipe and I won!  They were especially partial to the meatballs...hubby like them too.

this was great. only made a couple subs, due to resources. used fresh sage instead of parsley and panko instead of regular breadcrumbs in the meatballs. i think, and this is just my personal taste, i might add more salt to the meatballs, but otherwise this is a hearty and delicious dish. :D thanks for sharing.

Best Spaghetti ever! I've had better meatballs, but these were still very good :P  THE SAUCE WAS AMAZING!.. I'm sure fresh tomatoes from the garden helped :)) Gotta try this one!

The sauce was a good basic sauce that I added extra veggies into.  I think the amount of bread crumbs for the meatballs is too much.  I will add less next time.  I paired this up with the garlic bread recipe on here that's called "Toasted garlic bread."  I had some extra spread from the bread recipe and I added that into this sauce, along with some brown sugar and dusted pecorino cheese on top.  The end result was pretty good.  I will be making this one again!

I'm sorry, but I didn't care for this at all. The meatballs are definitely the best part of this recipe, but they were still too bland for my liking. The sauce was the real deal breaker tho.... It was flavorful but SUPER runny! A bit of tweaking would make this better, but there are far superior recipes out there that do not require nearly as much effort. I'll stick with those from now on. Thanks anyways, Jeremy.

I really liked this recipe! The sauce was delicious and so were the meatballs! I used 1/2 buffalo 1/2 spicy Italian sausage and crushed up chex mix instead of breadcrumbs. (Gluten intolerant) So good, my husband asked if we had enough leftovers for tomorrow night! This is defiantly a keeper!

This rating is ONLY for the sauce, not the meatballs.

I did not use the meatballs recipe as I have a healthy go-to meatball recipe already.  This sauce is better than any store bought tomato sauce I've ever bought.  This sauce has ruined me and my family in the sense that we will not buy pre-made store sauce ever again (until necessity calls for it).  It is delicious, savory, chunky, rich and just plain awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Its my go-to tomato sauce now!

This was truly unbelievable! Only suggestions: Use Italian breadcrumbs, brown the meatballs first, and put 1/2 the sauce in the blender.

Made exactly as was written,except I did add a can of tomato sauce at the end, just because I like it saucier. It was excellent! My husband, who is not a spaghetti fan, cleaned his plate. The leftover meatballs and sauce made great sandwiches the next night...Needless to say, none of this dish is going to waste in this house! Will never buy another jar of sauce again...this has spoiled us!

Excellent with some modifications. I like lots of flavor so we added some calamata olives to give it a little bang. Will definitely make again and will probably change it up again but this is a great base recipe. I did not make the meatballs and am sure that if I had, I wouldn't have used the olives.

This is a great recipe! I did use tomato puree rather than the whole tomatoes, and it worked out great. The meatballs were cooked perfectly, and added more flavor to the sauce. My whole family raved about it, and it now part of my regular recipes!

It was just ok, but too many tomatoes and not enough spices. The sauce was a bit thin and just tasted like tomato water. I'll add some more basil and Italian seasoning next time and only use 1 can of peeled tomatoes. I can't speak for the meatballs cause I didn't make those.

I make my tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes and jar it every fall unseasoned. I used my blank tomato sauce with these seasonings. Had to add more basil and oregano and garlic. The meatballs are the true disappointment. I made them exactly as the recipe says and they fell into pieces within 10 min. I had tomato meat sauce which is exactly what I didn't want and the reason I used a recipe : (

This is wonderful. Instead of using dried herbs, using my home grown ones give the the freshest flavor! Definately sear the meatballs. 
My boyfriend loves this recipe so much, he requests is weekly. He even helps cook it. :)

Sauce was great but the meatballs were bland, next time I'd condiment the meat better and brown them on a skillet too before letting them simmer with the sauce.

Way, way, way too much salt. The meat balls were good though. The recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of salt. Next time I make this I will add about 3/4 teaspoons of salt.

The sauce was definitely delicious, way better than jar spaghetti sauce. I also made the meatballs but added some basil instead of parsley and a tad of worcestershire sauce and they came out divine! My whole family loved them including my two year old who ate 5 meatballs!

Great Basic Sauce!  Unfortunately, I haven't yet tried the meatballs listed in this recipe. We have an Italian grocer who makes amazing meatballs, and we just add them to this sauce. The sauce is a great basic tomato sauce unchanged. It has become my "go-to" tomato sauce and is fantastic on top of ravioli and tortellini also.

I added 1 can of puree and a half tsp of italian seasoning. Used ground hamb instead of meatballs and added fried whole italian sausages. Everyone couldn't stop eating it while it cooked on the stove. This is real italian sauce.

My husband loves meatballs with his spaghetti and I'm still looking for a good recipe.  I did bake my meatballs and they were good (texture and flavor).  The sauce was more garlic than we care for and we both like garlic.  I thought the sauce was thick enough without the tomato paste (probably because all I had was crushed tomatoes)so I didn't put that in.  I also forgot to add the basil, but didn't miss it.  I made it in the crockpot which was very easy and it wasn't necessary to fuss over the cooking part.

My 4 year old daughter really wanted spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. I had never made them. This recipe was really easy and she loved them!

I followed the recipe as directed, and I really enjoyed the meatballs.  I did find the sauce to be bland, so next time I will add more seasoning.

I did not think this was a good recipe. Mostly just tasted like canned tomatoes, very sharp and acidic, and it was way too garlicky and salty. There didn't seem to be any "depth" to the sauce even after the long simmering time. Also found it to be thin and soupy. The meatballs were okay but I knew they would need salt so I did add some, otherwise they would be pretty tasteless. I did however like the idea of cooking them in the sauce. Oh well - can't win 'em all.

This rating is just for the sauce so far.  I haven't tried the meatballs yet.  I needed a sauce because some of my family was coming for dinner and I tried this. Everyone loved it.  I will try the meatballs some time though.

Good base recipe; i'd have given it 4 but found it salty; omitted salt on the second go. 
I made this two ways the first time .. 
one batch I added the meatballs to cook in the sauce directly 
and for the other batch baked the balls in the oven @ 350 for 40 or so minutes.. 
I liked the baked meatballs better - they caramelized adding more flavor.

Second time around 1/2 pork 1/2 beef mix; added a pinch of crushed chili ppr to the meatball mix; omitted salt; reduced sugar to 1/4 tsp and fresh basil to the sauce.. fantastic - will stick with renewed version for a five star meal.

Instead of 1 of the cans of whole tomatoes, I used 14oz stewed tomatoes and 14oz can diced or chopped tomatoes.  I also added  little smoked sausage and bell pepper.  Also, it needed about 2T white sugar and 1T Worcestershire sauce .  Blend after cooking for smooth texture.  If not, just leave it chunky.  This is, by far, the best marinara sauce.

Delicious!! Next time I will swap out one can of whole tomatoes with a can of stewed instead...there were more chunks than I usually like. I also used beef, pork and veal (meatball mix as my local butcher calls it) for the balls. I browner them as recommended by others and they were perfect. This is a new favorite!!!

Fantastic!!...I did two minor changes. I use a 50/50 blend of ground beef and Italian sausage. I also make the meatballs around the size of golf balls or smaller, if you like big balls *g* then follow the recipe.

Use ONLY fresh grated Parmesan cheese...

Fabulous!!! I made no changes to the meatball part of the recipe. I did make a few changes to the sauce: I substituted a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes for one of the cans of whole tomatoes and fresh basil for the dried.  I also added some fresh oregano, mushrooms and about 1/2 cup of red wine.  My step-daughter said that this was now her favorite meal!

i was hesitant to make a two and a half hour spaghetti sauce, because i think prego tastes better than a lot of italian restaurant dishes, but i dont know if i will EVER use prego again!!!
this was the BEST BEST BEST spaghetti ive ever had! i wasnt too crazy about the meatballs, but hubby raved about them too.  
the sauce was perfect the next day, made mini pizzas, and used as a dipping sauce for mozzerella sticks.
i cant begin to explain how perfect all the spices were. loved it, next time i may use 2 cans of tomato paste to make it a tad bit thicker, but still, the sauce was WAY BETTER THAN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN RESTAURANTS.
thank you so much for a great keeper

I love the sauce, but the meatballs werent that great. Theyre okay, but I was hoping for something better. On the 2 cans of whole tomatoes, I used petite diced instead. And then used a hand mixer to smooth everything out. I dont like chunky sauce, so this worked out great. I will be making this again, but will be finding a better recipe for the meatballs next time.

I've made this recipe over 20 times now and have made minor changes, ie. using organic plum tomatoes over regular, using more onions and garlic, using loose ground beef over meatballs, and simmering with cooked pasta.  These changes, I think make the sauce even more delicious.  I've blogged about it here:

I have been making this recipe for over a year now.  I used to love my moms spaghetti and meatballs, but she died with her recipe :(  I searched here for a recipe I could try and found this one.  I stick to the original recipe pretty much, except lately I have been using diced tomatoes just because it's easier than the whole.  I also add a pinch of baking soda to cut the acid some (a trick I learned on the internet) and I add some brown sugar to sweeten it up some.  I just love the flavor of this sauce!  The meatballs always come out perfect, and since they are cooked in the sauce....so easy.  I recommend this recipe wholeheartedly!

I made this dish over the weekend for my daughter, sister-in-law and her girls, and it was a big hit! Although next time I think I will pre-cook the meatballs in the oven. They will certainly keep their shape once you put them in the sauce. Very tasty and hearty meal!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I was cooking for 4 people so I used one can of the whole tomatoes.  Still turned out awesome while keeping the other proportions the same.  Everyone cleaned their plates.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce is really what gave it the stellar flavor, and the meatballs just melted in your mouth.  Some of the tweaks I made included adding a splash of red wine while putting in the meatballs/paste.  I also second using only a little sugar (I just used a small handful).  I also put more cheese in the meatballs (because cheese!).  Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe. Biggest change for me is half beef/half hot Italian sausage. Makes a ton of balls. I double up on tomatoes and garlic as well.

This is my go-to spaghetti recipe. AHMAZING! So easy to customize to whatever tomatoe cans you have. I used 1 can of tomatoe puree, 1 can crushed tomatoes with basil and oregano, and 1 can of diced tomatoe with italian herbs. Let it simmer for 90 minutes then add some fresh basil and more garlic before putting in the meatballs. So delish and couldn't be simpler!

Ummm, Wow! I honestly am not a big fan of spaghetti, but I occasionally get in the mood for it so I tried this. It's wonderful! I did change some things though. I made a meat sauce instead of meatballs. I browned the meat with the dried parsely, black pepper, and garlic powder. Then set it aside. I then followed the directions for the sauce. When it was time to add in the meatballs (in my case, sauteed ground beef), I added the meat and other ingredients as directed, plus grated parmesan. I then let everything simmer. No bread crumbs were used at all. The result was savory, italian meat sauce. This is a winner!

FANTASTIC!  Everyone loves this recipe.  Make sure you use fresh bread crumbs so that the meatballs are soft.  I make 24 small meatballs and used chopped tomatoes instead of whole.  This was delicious.  Thank you

Awesome recipe!  We thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  I did make a change, as we prefer sausage in our sghetti so I simply swapped out the beef for sausage.  Because of the grease, I baked the balls first and then added to the simmering sauce for another 20 mins or so.  Delicious!  I'm not usually one to review when I make any modifications but the sauce was scrumptious.

Everything about this recipe is delicious. I have made it both on the stove and the crock pot. I have also made just the meatballs (using jarred sauce) and just the sauce. Every time I make it, it is a huge hit! Also, for a healthier version I used lean ground turkey. Cooking them all day in the crock pot with sauce makes them just as juice as their full fat ground beef counterpart!

I love this recipe! It's so good. I also use tomatoes from our garden and it turns out just as good. It freezes really well also. If you freeze it, you just need to remember to add about a tablespoon of tomato paste while it heats up.

Can I just say -- Oh-Em-Gee, these were da bomb! Not only did my family love this dish, I made some for my daughter and her family (she's pregnant and can't cook because the smells make her nauseous). They loved it too! We didn't have any leftovers, but they ate in it for four days! Absolutely delish!!!

It was good...it could definitely use a few tweaks. I found the meatballs to be a little bit tasteless; they could use more spices. The sauce was a good starter, but it came out sour so next time I will add a tablespoon of sugar instead of a teaspoon. I will probably use this basic recipe again along with a few changes.

i made this but dont put raw meatballs in the stew.It made the sauce grasy. Next time i will brown and drain the meatballs first. It was a little bland but could be good with more spices.

This is the best recipe ever!!!! I make it about once every 2 months. When I make it we eat it that day and I freeze the left overs. I think it is even better after it is frozen and thawed. My family never has to eat sauce out of a jar again :-) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Love this recipe. I have always made home aid sauce and have liked it. I enjoy different variations of spaghetti sauces.
I will be using this a lot more often.
I made my meatballs  from a different recipe and put fresh mozzarella cheese in the middle of the meatball.
Thanks so much for sharing this.

Absolutely phenomenal! I followed the cooking instructions exactly and the meatballs turned out perfect.
Only changes I made were throwing in some red pepper flakes to the sauce, using seasoned breadcrumbs, and using some crushed some whole tomatoes. Might use all crushed next time.
Will definitely be making this again.

When I made this, it was my first time to make gravy from scratch.  WOW!  I make this at least once a month.  The only thing I added is a tablespoon or so of crushed red pepper for a little zing.  As for the meatballs, I prefer a more complex mixture of meat and I use Pecorino Remano cheese, which has more flavor.  But if I I could give the sauce 50 stars I would!

FINALLY!!! A homemade sauce that turned out perfect!!!  I have been trying different recipes for years and this one is a keeper....for sure!  I made a VERY slight change...I sauted the onions first and then added the garlic after the onions cooked for a while so that the garlic wouldn't burn.  I also took out the bay leaf after simmering for 90 minutes...before adding the final ingredients.

I did not use the meatball recipe though...but it looks good! Thank you Jeremy!!!

In all honesty I liked the sauce but I feel like I wasted money. The meatballs didnt have much flavor at all. This idea was an epic fail my taste for this dish was not what I has expected out to taste like.

BOTH THE MEATBALLS AND THE SAUCE ARE FABULOUS. THE MEATBALLS COOKED IN THE SAUCE FLAWLESSLY.  I MAY TRY THE MEATBALL RECIPE FOR MEATLOAF. HOWEVER, I WILL MIX HAMBURGER, SAUSAGE, AND VEAL.  I THINK IT WILL BE AMAZING.

Super yummy! This was a big hit in our house. Will definitely make again! Only thing I changed was adding some bell pepper and I used cans of diced & crushed tomatoes b/c that's what I had in the pantry.

Excellent recipe! I actually cooked my meatballs in the oven (small ones  only 12 mins @ 350) due to time constraints, but the flavor of the sauce was wonderful & the meatballs were an excellent counterpunch of flavor! Can't wait to try this again with a combo of ground beef & Italian sausage.

This is the best receipe I have ever had.  I could never make sauce before.  I substituted canned tomatoes for ones fresh from the garden and it is just wonderful.  Everyone loves it.  The meatballs are so simple and so delicious.  Thank you so much Jeremy for this awesome receipe.  I make bunches of it and I can it for the year.

My husband adored this recipe and begged me to make it again the next day. It took a little longer to make than opening a jar of sauce, but the results were well worth it.

Made this on the basis of the high rating it got! but I was left very much disappointed, the sauce was nice, but kinda average if your used to making homemade soups and sauces anyway, but it was the flavour of the meatballs, (or should I say lack of) that made this meal a disappointment for my family and I, they were tasteless and bland and even do the sauce was nice it just couldn't make up for the tasteless meatballs.

We made this exactly to recipe last night and found it to be pretty disappointing. The sauce was lackluster (I'd have gotten more flavour from a can of premade sauce). No one went for seconds, which is a real rarity in our pasta loving household.

The meatballs are good, but not exceptional. 

I wouldn't make this again.

okay i guess, however i wasnt too fond of the recipe not telling exactly what temperature to cook the meatballs or exactly how to cook them; oven or pan fry.  i like to read my recipes and know exactly what to do.

OK I cheated. I used jar sauce (Bertolli). I made the meatballs, rolled them in flour like one reviewer recommended then pan fried them til brown. Then I poured the sauce in the pan and simmered for about 45 minutes. Turned out GREAT. I hate store-bought frozen meatballs, these were a thousand times better. Maybe next time I'll actually make the sauce myself instead of being lazy :)

I have never rated a recipe before, but after making this, I wanted to write one.  This spaghetti sauce with meatballs is delicious!! One of the best I have ever had. I used 2 cans of 28oz crushed tomatoes, as well as 1 can of whole tomatoes.  I used about 1.5 tsp of salt, and 1 tsp of sugar.  I also used fresh basil. For the meatballs, I used 1.5lb of beef, and used about a cup of breadcrumbs and 2 eggs.  It really was so good, I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was my first homemade spaghetti sauce. I didn't make the meatballs, used ground beef instead. I omitted the sugar (I don't like sweet sauce) and added about a teaspoon of oregano and a can of crushed tomatoes. I also put half of the sauce in the blender when it was finished to smooth the sauce out a little. This recipe was easy and way better than store bought sauce. I will definitely make this recipe again.

First time making sauce from scratch and served it to my "very opinionated" mother who could not find any fault at all ... In fact, she raved about how good the meatballs were.  I used Stove Top stuffing instead of bread crumbs ... DELICIOUS!  Thank you for the recipe.

AWESOME SAUCE!!!! This is my new fav recipe, out-beating "Worlds best pasta sauce" on all recipes. I made a few modifications: 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese,chili-powder, tumeric,garlic powder, and garlic, and seasoned homemade breadcrumbs instead of the plain. For the sauce I used 1 tomatoe in place of the canned, 1/4 cup of rice vinegar which gave it more flavor then water, I'm half Asian Indian so I have to add chili-powder, tumeric,garlic powder, and garlic to everything! basil,bay-leaf,oregano went in too. I formed 14 meatballs and dropped them raw into the sauce (i never cook them before too much work and the meatballs soak up the flavor of the sauce)I even added a bit of milk since another reviewer said something about adding milk to thicken/ make the sauce creamier. Served with fettuccine pasta cuz that's all I had. My sister and brother love it!! :D

My entire family loved the recipe.  I make quite often.  I only made a couple of changes.  I also add 1 lb. ground pork to my meatballs.  I also cook them for 8 min at 350 deg. and drain on paper towels.  Then I simmer the meatballs in the sauce mixture.  The sauce is great!

This sauce was definitely a hit. I made it exactly as the recipe shows and my husband and my guests loved it. My husband mentioned that he enjoyed it because it did not taste processed and greasy. I served it with tomato basil focaccia bread and a spring mix salad. We will definitely make this again.

eh, its not the best I ever had but it wasn't horrible. The meatballs were good, I put them in the oven first for about 20 minutes to brown them up. I used one can of whole tomatoes and one can of diced. I still found it pretty chunky. I would suggest more seasoning in the sauce as well as less tomato, it really over powers the sauce. Maybe throw some other stuff like mushrooms and peppers. I probably wont make this one as per recipe when I try it next, if I do.

I just made this for my family this evening.  I actually started the sauce last last night and then put in the refrigerator.  This morning, I put it in a crockpot (along with the meatballs) and turned it on earlier today and I let it cook on low for about five hours and it was excellent!  Everyone, including a guest, told me this definitely has to be added to the rotation.  Thank you so much for this delicious, easy recipe!

What a relief! I LOVE spaghetti, but have been so tired and bored of bad and bland spaghetti sauce that I was leery to even make it any more. However, this changed everything!! It was so easy and flavorful, and although we are not necessarily Meatball lovers (honestly, I'd never made them before, let alone eaten them), we devoured them! I must have made them smaller than they should have been, as we had quite a few remaining, and my husband took the leftover meatballs and just had a meatball sub the next day at work!  DEFINITELY a keeper for us!

At first I was (like many other reviewers) leary about not cooking the meatballs prior to putting them in the sauce - but I followed the directions and these were the best, most juicy and tender meatballs (and completely cooked) I ever had.  My family loved them.  The recipe is very easy to customize with your favorite herbs and spices.  This is my new go-to sauce and meatballs!

I selected this recipe based on its' ratings and makeup (meatballs) and and was not dissapointed whatsover! I had considered "bottled" sauce but opted for the "made-from-scratch" variety. Frankly, I was concerned 'bout not searing the meat, but highly recommend that you follow the recipe as listed! In fact, I cooked the sauce for my colleagues and to a person they raved about it. I transferred finished sauce to a stone, slow-cooker for initial refrigeration and for ease of serving. I reheated on high for a couple of hrs and then reduced to "warm" to ensure that the ingredents fully integrated and that the meatballs were done. Good eating!

Delish! 

Of course, I made a couple of a tweaks to make this even more healthy! First, I did not add the olive oil - added 1/4 c of water instead and used the juice from the canned tomatoes. 

I also used a dropper full of concentrated liquid Stevia instead of the sugar. 

This was crazy easy, no preservatives and everyone how has tasted this (brought it to the office) was amazed at how good it was! I'll be doing it again here this week!

The best spaghetti ever! I was worried putting in raw meatballs but they turn out perfect. I left mine in a crock pot for the day and it turned out great. We did have to crush down the tomatoes after cooking for a while I would cut the whole tomatoes.

SO good! Easy to make and everyone loved it.  I had to simmer it for an extra 10 minutes at the end to cook the meatballs all the way through.  Only downside for the recipe is 90 minute simmer then 30 minute simmer.

I have been searching for years for a good basic Italian Spaghetti Sauce recipe. I finally found it with this recipe. I'm not even done yet but I've had it simmering for thirty minutes now and the smell coming from my kitchen is five star hands down. I tasted it and so far it's the best sauce I have ever tasted. I am counting the minutes till it's done and I can get the full flavor. Can't wait.

This is my go to recipe for homemade tomato sauce with or without the meatballs. So yummy and thick. Today I used 3 cans - 2 plum and 1 crushed. So I will add 1/2 more time to simmering. Plus a bit more of the spices too. Now I'm going to buy some fresh pasta to go with it. Enjoy!!

Followed the recipe and was highly disappointed! Does not make much sauce and was very chunky, too chunky to completely cover the noodles. Very sweet, I would definitely eliminate the sugar.

I don't really care for meatballs so I passed on those. Added about 1 lb of ground beef and about 1/3 package of ground italian sausage to brown with the onions/garlic. Used 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes and 1 28-oz can whole tomatoes. Added a little italian seasoning and used 1 TBSP sugar instead of 1tsp. Added one can of tomato paste the last 20-30 minutes and it thickened up perfectly. Still thought this sauce was just "good" and not "great" though.

I made the meatballs to have with bought spaghetti sauce. My bf said the meatballs were bland and I agreed. I might make them again but will definitely add something. Perhaps worcestershire sauce and/or seasoned breadcrumbs.

I thought this would be a nice surprise to make for my wife. She is first generation Italian, both parents born and raised in Italy. She said it was horrible; she thought I was tying to poison her. She said it tasted like genetically altered soy. I just went along with the recipe and kept an open mind about uncooked meatballs. Oh well, live and learn. I ate six of them to be a good sport.

Yummy sauce. I add italian seasoning to the sauce and skip the sugar. For the meatballs i use 1/2 ground beef 1/2 ground pork, the cheese, an egg, uncooked oatmeal, garlic powder, parsley and a little italian seasoning. I put them uncooked into the sauce but it simmers in a crockpot for 4 hours on low. They aren't mushy then.

I was worried about the meatballs not cooking through so I kept checking them, but I really had nothing to worry about.  They cooked just fine.  Cooked this for 3 kids and they loved it.  The only thing I added was more sugar (for kid version).  If I was to serve this to adults only, I would add some chili peppers to spice it up.

My family won't eat big chunks of whole tomatoes - so I did like another reviewer suggested, and put the chunks in the blender and blended them.  Overall the sauce was fantastic - good taste and texture!

My family and  I love the recipe... easy, fast and full of great flavors. The only recommendations I have are: (1) substitute the dried parsley and basil with fresh products, (2) use organic garlic cloves (they pack more punch!) and (3) use a good quality grated parmesan with a good moisture level (if you can!).

I didn't use the meatball recipe, but I did use the spaghetti sauce recipe and the sauce turned out GREAT! I used one can and a half of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. You can use more or less of the diced tomatoes depending on your prefered thickness of sauce. I also used 3/4 can of tomatoe sauce. Also add to your desired thickness.  For everything else, I followed the recipe as is. The sauce turned out GREAT!!

This sauce was excellent.  Just the right combination of spices and garlic!  My children (9yr. and 2 yr) loved it as well!  I did cook this longer than the recipe states, but i think it just helped the flavor!  Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe.

I made the sauce and meatballs exactly as described.  I thought the sauce came out very bland.  I'm not the best cook, so I couldn't tell you exactly what it was missing, but definitely was bland.

Just made this tonight for the first time. The sauce was very flavorful but needed a tad bit of seasoned salt then it was perfect. I found the meatballs a bit bland so, on my next try, I will take some of the other reviews recommendations on how to make them better. I'll tune back in next time I make this.

Most delicious sauce ever!

Things I did or would do:
Add some Agave Nectar to make sweeter..was delicious!
-Add fresh basil at the end - didn't need this, but would do if I had some on hand



 I did add some Agave Nectar to sweeten it up a bit, and it did take some time to cook, and I also got my handheld blender and blended the sauce so it was a bit smoother. It was AMAZING!! The meatballs were juicy!!
Was nervous the meatballs wouldn't be cooked, but they were perfect!!!! My husband and I were surprised how good this was!!

This was wonderful!  I used this recipe with the intent to make meatball subs and they were fantastic.  My sauce came out a little soupy but taste was great.  I'll definitely keep this on our monthly rotation!

Loved the sauce!  So much better than store bought!  I pan fried the meatballs before putting them in the sauce.  Put about half the sauce in a blender and added back in for less chunkiness.

This dish was AMAZING! Better than any sauce I've made or bought! I will never use sauce in a jar again! I love tangy, robust sauces (not the sugary ones) and this is definitely one of those. Cooking the meatballs in the simmering sauce just makes everything taste amazing. The meatballs were cooked perfectly-very moist. I added extra garlic, salt, and some Italian seasoning to taste. My husband loved this and I will be making it many, many more times!

Fantastic sauce. I added ketchup to the meatballs (I did not have anything else) and they turned out really moist. Next time I will add more seasoning to the meatballs but the sauce does not need anything.

This is a fantastic red sauce, and the meatballs are flavorful and perfect! We used seasoned bread crumbs. Definately a keeper. We'll be making this again.

Fantastic simple sauce and really easy to prepare. I did as others  have suggested and used only one can whole tomatoes and one can crushed. For the meatballs I did 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb hot grated Italian sausage. I also added 1/2 t. of crushed red pepper flakes to the mix. I also did one half of the meatballs by browning in a pan and adding to sauce and the other half I baked in the over @ 350 for 25 minutes before adding to the sauce. In the future I will bake them before adding... I like the crispy outside... Loved both of these items and glad others have done the trial and error before I got to this... I gave it 5 stars after the changes and it was easy to make.

Really simple. I used diced tomatoes and smashed whole tomatoes. Also to add more flavor and texture to the sauce I added a 1/2 cup celery and sliced mushrooms. The first time I made the meatballs I used a meatloaf mix 1/2 ground beef 1/2 ground pork. I added Oregano to the meat mix and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. The meatballs turned out great. Finally I topped it of with fresh shaved Pecorino Romano cheese. A really great recipe.

Amazing recipe! The first night I thought it was just okay, but as left overs, man I was blown away by the taste, as was my husband! I guess it helps to let all the ingredients seep into the sauce. I did add fresh basil instead of dried b/c I had some on hand and it was just so aromatic and delicious. If you have fresh herbs, I'd say that's the way to go.

This recipe is great and really easy.  We use to always use jar sauce, simply because it was fast.  Now I always make this.  I use crushed herb croutons as another reviewer suggested.  It is also good because I am a vegetarian and my family members are not.  I can just put a little sauce in another pot for myself for the last 30 minutes before adding the meatballs.  This saves me from having to make a separate meal!

I tried this recipe for the first time on Christmas. I've never made my own sauce before. The sauce was so good!!!  I used whole peeled tomatoes.  I also put all the ingredients in at the same time.  After it simmered for about four hours, I ran it through a blender.  I then added the meatballs and simmered for an additional six hours.  The more days that pass, the better the sauce is. For the meat balls I used half beef ad half ground sausage-delish!  Several people asked for the recipe!

Fabulous! We all felt like we were eating in a restaurant! I used less bread crumbs than called for, probably about half a cup, and fresh parsley. I think a bit more bread crumbs (boxed, not fresh as stated in the recipe) could have helped the meatballs be a little bit more firm but there were only a couple that fell apart.

This recipe was so simple I had to try it - with the following changes: I one can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Italian tomatoes, diced fine in the blender, about 1 teaspoon each of oregano, marjoram and Cajon spice; and 1/2 cup fresh parsley, 3/4 cup diced celery, 1/2 cup diced carrot, and about 1.5 - 2 teaspoons black mustard seeds. I sauteed the spices, herbs and seeds along with the vegetables in olive oil before adding the tomatoe ingredients. I measure in the palm of my hand so the above measure can be decreased or increased to taste. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little kick. Growing up with Italian food I also used this sauce (without the meatballs) baked with chicken topped with sliced mozzarella cheese one night and on Friday heated the sauce and added shrimp for about 5 minutes to serve over pasta - fabulous.  There are so many things you can do with a basic sauce and it's fun to experiment. Buon appetito!

This sauce was really good, but I HIGHLY recommend cooking the meatballs BEFORE adding them to the sauce! I even cooked the sauce for 10 mins. longer than directed, and the meatballs were still raw in the middle, and had to be removed and microwaved for several mins. That was a little disappointing, to say the least. The flavor, once cooked, was good, though.

This recipe is great! I have never made meatballs before, but they were wonderful. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used saltine crackers that I put through the food processor. I also added rosemary and red pepper flakes to the meatball mixture. I rolled the meatballs in the cracker crumbs and lightly fried in olive oil before adding to the spaghetti sauce to cook the rest of the way. I also added fresh pesto the the sauce right before serving. Delish!

This was very good!!! I followed the directions exactly as stated. I will be using this recipe again and again. The only changes I will make is use diced tomatoes instead of whole (it was a bit too chunky). I browned the meatballs in olive oil before putting them in the sauce because I like a slight crust. I did not cook all the way through, just a quick brown. I also used Progresso Italian bread crumbs. This was absolutely delicious and I will continue making it. Thank you for sharing!

I like this recipe, but the meatballs lack a little bit of flavor and they are really bready and almost mushy. Will keep using the red sauce, yum.

I've made this twice now.    First time: I quadrupled the recipe for a large family gathering and used 3 lbs ground beef plus 1 lb ground pork to the meatball mixture.  I also added a little more parmesan cheese (1/4 cup?) to the meatballs.  The sauce was made per the posted recipe (I may have added an extra teaspoon of sugar and a little Italian seasoning).  It was great!  The meatballs had a great taste and my company raved about it.  Second time: Made the meatballs with only beef and added a little more parmesan again.  Followed the recipe other than that.  I also made the sauce the same way as the first time.  The meatballs came out VERY bland, and the sauce is decent.  I will use this recipe again, but I will always add ground pork to the meatballs.  The sauce smells like my Italian grandmother's, but doesn't quite taste the same.  Don't get me wrong, it's good.  There's just some something missing...almost there, though.  Maybe a few red pepper flakes?

This was the best tasting spaghetti sauce recipe I have ever used. For the meatballs, I did use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, and used 1/2 tbs of basil & 1/2 tbs of oregano instead of the dried parsley for more flavor. Most excellent recipe--Thank you!

AWESOME! I use recipes from this site all the time and never come back to comment, but I had to on this one! My family had demanded it again and again. I browned the meatballs in heated olive oil because I like a crust. I did not cook all the way through, just a quick brown. I did not use fresh bread crumbs, I used basic Italian Progresso and they turned out delicious. I froze half the recipe and it tasted just as good the second time around. Love this!

all I taste is tomato!!   I love spaghetti sauce but this one just doesnt do it. I would not use whole tomatoes  Also needs a whole lot more spices.  a little disappointed..after the 90 minutes I tasted and like I siad all tomato so I didnt put in all the meatballs so I would have some for a back up. Meatballs were not very flavorful either. Opened up a jar of Prgeo.

I made this today for my family.  Everyone raved about it.  I used crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs because I didn't have any.  I pre-cooked the meatballs in my oven along with spicy Italian sausage. (My father-in-law says the spicy sausage is the secret to good sauce.)  I also used crushed tomatoes. Turned out great!

I followed the recipe as written.  It was so easy and my family loved it.  A quick (for scratch sauce) and easy recipe to follow.

My modifications:  -Half the salt in the sauce  -I used one large can of crushed tomatoes (I didn't have any whole) and 1 small can of tomato sauce as well as the tomato paste  -1 tsp red chilli flakes in the meatballs  -I barbecued the meatballs first, this was an experiment, but they were FANTASTIC!

Excellent meatballs, did them without egg and still came out great. I used 1 jar ragu traditional and one jar ragu mushroom instead. Used corse ground black peppercorns instead of black pepper. My family loves it, i make this quite regularly now!

Not a better recipe out there. I use whole San marzano tomato's only- nothing is better and I double the garlic- add a couple more bay leaves and double the basil-i use fresh leaves and roll them and slice. I put a tbsp of sugar in and sometimes a tiny bit more.  Put in the crock pot for 4-6 hours and let the tomatoes break down. I also add everything at once....meatballs the last hour or so. Meatball recipe is perfect! I make this ALL the time-its a HUGE hit and you cant beat it.

Excellent sauce recipe with great meatballs!  The only suggestion I would make is to use only half of the olive oil...the full 1/4 cup was a bit much.  Other than that, wonderful as written!

Greatest sauce in the world!  It will now be my default for everything Italian I make.  I used fresh oregano, basil and rosemary since that's what I had and I added red wine and it was even more amazing.  Thanks a bunch...

I finally made homemade sauce.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  My boyfriend said it was the best meatballs and sauce he ever had and he is very picky...  I did add 1/2 cup of cabernet to the sauce and had to subsitute a few things because I didn't have everything on hand.  Best sauce and meatballs ever!

I made this tonight for a family dinner, and I am by no means a proficient cook.  It was a big hit, the sauce was great, and the meatballs tasty and juicy.  Will definitely make this again, though the stuffed diners have requested smaller meatballs next time. :)

my first sauce from scratch, very good flavor!  the meatballs seemed to have a texture like they were boiled, which i wasn't used to but it was still good.  i put half the sauce through the blender to smooth it out. very good, will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, and everyone seemed to love it.  I did add some Italian seasonings to the meatballs and sauce for extra flavor.  Before adding the meatballs, I cut up the tomatoes with the mixing spoon for better consistency.  This recipe was so easy, and definitely worth the time required!

The sauce looked and tasted quite different than what I am used to.  The sauce wasn't a deep red and the taste was very mild.  I wouldn't say bland but it simply tasted completely different from supermarket sauce.  My 10 year old didn't care for it.  My wife and I liked it but I probably won't make it again.  It was just very different.

Wow! Worth the wait for sure.  Only change was I used one pound of plain ground pork in addition to the beef for the meatballs. I increased the sauce as well.  Will make again, and again, and again!

Great recipe. I've made this three times, with a successful outcome each time. Tastes so much better than the sauce in a jar, and it isn't even that difficult to make. Freezes easily. Thank you!

These are the best meatballs I have ever made.  I fried up the meat and put it in my lasagna.  Awesome!  Used the rest for meatball sandwiches the next night.  I will always use this recipe from here on out.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out great. Only change I might make next time is to make the meatballs just a little smaller - maybe 15 instead of 12. Important update and note to self - FRESH bread crumbs not dry!

Made this for the family last week and I swear these were the best meatballs I have ever made!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and we like our sauce spicy so I added cayenne.

I should have grabbed a bigger sauce pan because the meatballs were all crowded together, but either way the meatballs and sauce taste delicious! First time making spaghetti sauce without using already made jar of spaghetti sauce!

This was my first attempt at spaghetti and meatballs. It was very easy. I did make mine in the crock pot. I put all ingredient in and cooked on high for about 5 hours and then added the meatballs and cooked another hour. I followed all ingredients as listed. It was even better the next day.

This was my first time making spaghetti and meatballs, and possibly my first time making spaghetti sauce from scratch. I never want to go back to the jar sauce! This was awesome, and really quite easy. It takes awhile to make, but most of it is not active prep/cooking time. I used a couple fresh tomatoes in addition to the canned (had some I needed to use), added some salt to the sauce and a little bit of salt-free italian seasoning in addition to the parsley and basil. I also substituted some mild italian sausage for some of the ground beef (about 1/4 of it). It was delicious!

My daughter, whom isn't much of a meat eater, ate the heck out of these meatballs.  The sauce was fantastic but I think i'll add a little more tomatoes to my next batch.  Overall very good!

I made this tonight for dinner and all I have to say is YUMMO! I didn't have bread crumbs so I smashed some whole wheat crackers and it worked great! Also, I added oregano, pinch of cayenne pepper and an extra can of tomato sauce which made it a bit bitter but I offset it with some more sugar and oregano. I browned/precooked the meatballs in a skillet with some olive oil. I put them in the sauce about 30 minutes before dinner and it was great! My family loved it - this one is a keeper! :)

Absolutely Delicious! I first made the recipe exactly as described and it was fantastic. The next time I decided to change it up a bit. 1/2 pound ground veal and 1/2 pound ground pork instead of the ground beef. Everything else stayed the same. This truly is a fabulous recipe and on regular rotation in our house. My family actually requests this regularly. What's even better about this recipe is, I now double it all the time. Left over sauce for the week and the left over meatballs are great for meatballl sandwiches. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe.  It is not only the best spaghetti sauce I've ever made, but is honestly the best I've ever had.  To each his/her own, I know, but this is GREAT and devoured by all every time I make it.  Definitely *five stars as written*, though like other reviewers, I prefer to add a little ground pork to my meatballs.

This was pretty good if you like the real taste of Italian spaghetti sauce. It had a real strong taste of tomatoes. The meat balls were really good, but next time I might try it with the lean ground beef throughout the sauce instead of meat balls. Made the kitchen smell amazing.

Should have stayed with lean burger - was afraid the meatballs would be dry so I went with medium - too much fat left in the recipe. Added canned mushrooms and red pepper. Had always  pre-cooked meatballs in the skillet - will do it this way from now on - tender, flavour - MUCH better than skillet cooked! Overall, a lovely meatball dish.

I only made the marinara sauce for this recipe and I enjoyed how quick i could pick it together.  I did feel that it had a little bit of a "zip" to it and could be a little sweeter by use of carrots or something.

I've made this sauce twice.   The first time I pretty much followed it exactly.  I didn't make the meatballs- we just added cooked ground beef.  First time around I tasted the sauce while it was cooking and it was SO BLAND!  3/4 tsp basil for all those tomatoes seems like nothing.  And I don't understand why there are so many good reviews because as written this is a very bland sauce.  I had to add extra basil, oregano, onion and garlic.  Second time around I added 1 bell pepper( I double the recipe and freeze some), and all the same extras from the first time around.   I also prefer a smoother sauce so I use one can of tomatoe puree and one can of crushed tomatoes.  If anything, this is a good base.  I will continue to make it, only because I prefer to make things from scratch and it's cheaper.

Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had! I forgot to saute the olive oil, onions, and minced garlic, but it didn't matter it still turned out great. I did add some cut zucchini which made it sooooo good! The meatballs were really good, but I did double the parmesan cheese because my fiance wanted them to be cheesey. The best part, is that because I made the 6 servings and there is only 3 people in my family, there is a bunch left. I will never buy jarred sauce again!

My wife has been making fantastic meatballs for years so I tried this recipe to see if it gave hers a run for it's money.  I was very dissapointed by the meatballs and the sauce.  1st of all, the bread crumbs are way to much unless you're looking for the consistency of meatloaf.  I'd suggest using a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs per pound of meat.  2nd, the meatballs need to be browned before dropping raw meat into the sauce. Most of the recipes I've tried with this many 4.5 star reviews have been fantastic.   I'll pass on this one.

I only made the meatballs so thats all I can rate.  I really enjoyed this recipe because it is similar to my mothers recipe.  Although a bit bland, it is a great way to start with a meatball and using it again and adding the flavors that suit you. I followed the recipe "to a T" and thought that the meatballs could use a bit more doctoring up.   The second time I made this I added 1/4 tsp. garlic to the original recipe, use the three meat combo traditional to Italian meatballs, more parmesan cheese and 1/8 tsp. of water so that the meat wouldn't dry out. Today I am going to try the sauce portion of this recipe.  Thank you Jeremy for sharing this recipe!!!

I used ground turkey instead of  beef and cut back slightly on the bread crumbs, and I did not have any parmesan cheese, still they were awesome! They were very moist and tasted great!

Great recipe! Made it a month ago and about to make it again. Does anyone have any suggestions if I wanted to substitute the ground beef for ground chicken...would I need to do anything different? Cook longer? Thanks

My husband and I loved both the meatballs and sauce.  I canned several quarts of the sauce, so we'll see how that turns out in a few months.

I added grated cold butter (1/2 stick) a splash of milk, used 3 lg cloves pressed garlic, some spices, oregano and fine diced onion...about 1/4 of an onion. then i baked them for 25 mins at 400 on a rack to drain the fat out. it was great. i just used a jar of sauce!

This recipe was delicious! It was my first official meal that I cooked for my husband and myself (we just got married 3 weeks ago). It was a perfect way to start things off, and my husband loved it! Delicious flavors and loved the homemade sauce. I will definitely use again!

This is almost like my sauce but too much garlic. I use tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes. No sugar, use red wine instead. Cut down on the bay leaf (maybe 1) an use parsley and oregano.

Absolutely delicious! Usually meatballs are pretty bland for me but these were wonderful! My husband was very impressed too and he's quite picky about his spaghetti sauce!

I gave this 5 stars after tasting just the meatballs. My young boys are very picky eaters and not only did all 3 of them eat the meatballs (a shock in itself!), but they all wanted seconds and were upset to find none were left (my husband and I had eaten them all). This NEVER happens.  I made 2 changes to the original recipe: I used turkey burger instead of ground beef and whole grain Cream of Wheat instead of breadcrumbs (I got the cereal idea from Swedish Meatballs 1 by Jessica). Thanks to other reviewers who mentioned turkey burger gets too dry with breadcrumbs, I used maybe 1/2 cup of cereal instead of 1 cup.  I put them in a saucepan with jarred marinara and they were fantastic! No browning, no mess; perfect.  Today I'm trying them in the crockpot.   I haven't made the sauce yet (did I mention my kids were picky eaters?) but I plan to, and I suspect it will be delicious.

This is my new "go to" recipe!  My husband also enjoyed it, and was quite surprised when I told him the sauce did not come from a jar.  I used Ritz crackers as someone earlier suggested, and I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I also threw in some fresh oregano since I had it on hand.

This is a very good base recipe, but I found it to be somewhat bland so I added more seasonings. My husband loved the meatballs, but I found them a little undercooked.  Good flavor though.  I found that 12 meatballs was not enough and too big.  I made smaller meatballs.  I WILL use this as my base recipes again.  I only give this 3 stars because I did change the recipe some and added seasoning.

Delicious. My Italian family loved it. For the reviewer who said the meatballs were hard and dry--did you use fresh breadcrumbs as stated in recipe. You CANNOT substitute dry, canned breadcrumbs. The sauce was very good ( I used about 1/2 the salt). Next time I think I'll add some sweet Italian sausage for extra flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Had this at a family dinner and everyone said it tasted like restaurant spaghetti and meatballs.  Great compliment.  This recipe is super easy also.  The only thing I did differently was browning the meatballs in a skillet before adding them to the sauce.  They came out great.

Awesome sauce and meatballs - great flavor.  Next time will simmer for the last 30 minutes without the lid to make the sauce thicker.

Disclaimer- I didn't make the sauce, just the meatballs, so this review isn't for the sauce!  I've been searching for my perfect meatball recipe and while this was decent, it didn't blow me out of the water.  Guess I'll keep looking!

This was the first time I have made spaghetti from scratch and it turned out delicious. For the meatballs I didn't have ground beef, so instead I used ground pork infused with sage and turkey, 1/2 lb each. I added some minced celery and fresh parsley instead of the dry. I also added 1/2 c. milk in case the turkey would dry out the meatball. The only other change I made was that I used a hand blender to break down the chunks of tomato, or else I would never hear the end of it from my husband that there were giant chunks of tomato! Excellent dish:)

I love this recipe!  The meatballs are divine. However, I do cut the salt in half, and cook the meatballs and sauce all together.  I'm sure its better if you let the sauce simmer for 90 minutes, but I don't have time.  It tastes great even after 30 minutes or until meatballs are cooked through. I print this recipe off and give with the olive oil, wine, pasta pot, and spaghetti as a bridal shower gift.  I used to make a homemade spaghetti sauce with ground beef, but it doesn't take much longer to make the meatballs.  This is in the regular rotation and I don't make my mother's recipe anymore....shhh don't tell her!

This is the best spaghetti sauce ever...instead of making meatballs I cook up ground sausage and add it the last 30 minutes of simmering. I also add mushrooms.. YUM YUM...my kids love it too.

This is a fabulous recipe. I was skeptical about not browning the meatballs first, however, they came out delish. I added a tbs of milk to the meatball mix to ensure a moist texture. I added fresh basil to the sauce as well.

This was a tasty sauce.  The meatballs were tender.  The only complaint from my husband was that the sauce was much tomato and saucey.  He likes it a little thicker.  I mixed the leftovers with the noodles, and the next day it was thick.  Just for those who like a thicker sauce.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have tomato paste, so I substituted with tomato juice. And instead of dried basil, I used fresh. My whole family (including my 5 yr old daughter who refuses any kind of "red sauce") LOVED it. I didn't brown the meatballs first. Just added uncooked to the sauce and simmered for 45 mins instead of 30, to make sure they were firm. YUM.

For some reason (I think because they never turned out as expected) I have never made meatballs. Loved this recipe. I followed it almost exactly (made some extra meatballs so we could have meatball sandwiches as well) and it was great! The meatballs were delicious with the spaghetti and leftover on meatball sandwiches on Italian bread! Thanks for sharing!

fabulous! I never knew I could cook something so delicous, thanks for sharing.  My only changes would be to make twice the meatballs - they were so delicous they didnt last long!   Recipe was super easy to follow and restaurant quality results.

Great Meatballs...I actually used my own sauce recipe but the meatballs are really good as written.  I just added a little tomato paste to them to hold them together a little more.

I rated this 4 out 5 due to the changes I needed to make.  MEATBALLS: I mixed one tablespoon of Italian Seasoning II (from this site) to the bread crumbs, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 cup milk beat in with the egg.  The meat balls came out moist and flavorful.  (It's not a bad idea to mix ground beef with pork, increase Parmesan to 1/4 cup and use crushed Ritz crackers as the bread crumb base.)  SAUCE: I used two 28 oz cans of chopped tomatoes, no bay leaf, a pinch of nutmeg and decreased salt in half.  The sauce did not come out too sweet with the tsp of sugar used or too acidic for my taste.  Next time I will add more garlic (2 - 4 extra cloves) and sliced mushrooms (1 lb).  NOODLES: Poured meatball sauce over five cheese tortellini from Costco (which cooks in 3 - 5 mins). OTHER: Served with toasted garlic bread on the side.

Made this for the first time last night and the sauce came out okay.  My only complaint was that the sauce was WAY too salty, although reading back over the recipe, I see I put 2 TABLEspoons instead of 2 TEAspoons, so that would do it.  I did make some changes: For the meatballs I used half ground beef and half spicy italian sausage.  I used crackers instead of breadcrumbs and fresh parsley instead of dried.  These were EXCELLENT!  For the sauce I substituted 14oz of the whole tomatoes for 14oz of diced.  I think I will do half and half next time because I like the texture of diced better.  I also used fresh basil instead of dried and added fresh italian parley.  I had a big bowl of both herbs chopped and ready to go and added as I felt the sauce needed.  Ended up adding way more than 3/4 teaspoon, but it was worth it :)  When adding the tomato paste at the end the sauce thickened up really nicely and came out with a great constancy.  The meatballs were really tasty and even though we added way too much salt, the base of the sauce was still really delicious.  I will definitely have this again.

I am not a cooking I made this for my first sauce experience and it came out really well but I altered it I added a third can 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes, and added pepper and onions to the meatballs.  I also added sweet Italian sausage everyone seems to like it.

This is a very yummy recipe! I followed the recipe as is except for using one can of crushed tomatoes and one peeled, instead of two peeled.   I did NOT brown the meatballs.. and they were perfect and ready in 35 mins!  This is a very 'saucy' recipe and is great for bread dipping!  Loved it!

I didn't have time to make the sauce last night but I did make the meatballs and they were wonderful! I did roll them in flour and cook them in a skillet with olive oil for a few minutes just to hold the juices in. They were super moist and great tasting.

VERY good - I made this last week and everyone loved it. Will be making it again very soon! I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes, so I used a 28oz can of tomato sauce & 2- 15oz cans of crushed tomatoes & a 6oz can of tomato paste. My family doesn't like chunky sauce & my variation was not chunky :)

I am giving this 5 stars because it is a delicious recipe but I did make one change. Not to the ingredients but to the process. I used my immersion blender to one half of the sauce prior to putting meatballs in just to thicken the sauce. I love this recipe.

This is the best spaghetti and meatballs EVER! The meatballs are SO tender! I also use more garlic than the recipe calls for (i can't get enough garlic!) and add mushrooms to the sauce. It works in a slow cooker as well! Also, I usually try to puree the tomatoes before serving. It doesn't matter how long I cook them, they still seem to stay really really chunky. Great recipe though and a staple in my kitchen!

Very delicious meatballs!  The best I've ever made and perhaps had.  Super easy and the snobbiest eaters will enjoy.  When I'm feeling extra lazy I will use a jar of sauce and add some herbs/spices, garlic, and a small can of tomato sauce, otherwise cooking the same.  Extra parmesan in the meatballs is the only way I change them.  Thank you for such a good recipe!

very good recipe, easy to add your own twists to it and make it your own as well. coming from the south, we're very cajun-and-creole-country, so it's nice to be able to manipulate the sauce a little bit to form a seafood spaghetti or something more like hat my mom and grandmothers have always made. good italian though. definitely would make again!!! best with home made pasta.

Recipe followed exactlly. The spaghetti sauce on this was absolutely incredible. It tasted like I used fresh tomatoes. I couldn't stop saying so. Could have used just a tad more flavor. The meatballs were okay. I ended up baking some in the oven and then putting them in the sauce and some I just put in the sauce without baking. The ones that were not baked were very mushy inside. The ones that were baked were perfect. The taste was okay. Husband and kids liked them but I still want something more so will use the sauce recipe but make other meatballs.

It was great!  I was a bit skeptical about putting the meatballs into the sauce without cooking them first but tried it anyway.  The meatballs came out moist but held together very well and I think by putting them in raw they flavor the sauce as they cook.  My youngest said it was the best thing she'd ever eaten!

I'm not a fan of spaghetti but my family is.  I made this last night and everyone thought it was fantastic, including me.  The only changes I made, is that I browned italian sausage with the garlic and onions.  Then added the tomatoes, etc.  I also added bread crumbs and oatmeal to the meatballs.  This is a very tasty dish.  We loved it.

I'm not a huge pasta sauce fan, but this turned out really,  my friends who are italian said it was very good.  Only comment meatballs were a little bland - made them as stated, but with seasoned bread crumbs.

Not so good.  Meatballs were soft and I browned them before cooking.  I'm not sure what went wrong.

This was ok.  I made as directed and added meatballs directly to the sauce to simmer.  I think next time I will take an extra step and brown the meatballs, as the sauce was  a bit greasy for my taste.  I agree that the meatballs could have used more seasoning (some salt would probably do the trick.) The sauce was flavorful and easy, though.

I made this yestday for V-Day for my husband and kiddos who are all Italian.  I have never made this from scrath before.  I've always used jarred....I added 1# of hot italian sauge I think next time I will use hot and sweet.  I also chopped everythin in the blender since the kiddos are big on texture and do not like chunks of tomatoes....I also cooked everything in the crockpot on low for 7 hours.....I will definetly be making this again :)

The meatballs were great, however if you notice it does not mention adding any salt in the meatball recipe or sauce recipe.  So I added a slash of worcestershire sauce to the meatball recipe and a pinch of salt.  To the sauce recipe I add 1/2 cup of red wine, Italian seasonings and salt.  The meal was outstanding.

I can only rate the meatballs since I used a different sauce.  I actually used minced chicken and it came out very well.  Thought it would not be properly cooked inside since there was no pre-browning but that was not the case. Will try again with sauce in future.

Very good! I let this cook all day on low in a crock pot and then in the evening I cooked the meat as directed in the sauce on the stove top. It turned out great.

This was the first time I made homemade sauce and it was so yummy. I doubled te recipe and made the meatballs with 1lb beef and 1lb pork. My whole family loved and requested it again the next day because we did not have any leftovers!

This meal was a hit at dinner tonight! I did make a few changes. For the meatballs, I used 1 lb ground turkey & 1/2 lb sausage, Italian style bread crumbs, Dried Basil & Asiago Cheese(was out of parmesan). For the sauce, I used 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1/2C chicken broth, a bit more sugar, thyme & oregano. My kids kept telling me how good this was! Thanks for sharing!

I only made the meatballs, but they were fantastic! Full of flavour. I did add garlic though (in addition to the garlic powder - not that it really lacked something without it - I just LOVE garlic!)

Great recipe!!  I followed the ingredients exactly but did bake the meatballs in the oven before adding to the sauce for the final 15 mins of cooking time.  I was worried about the grease that might be in the sauce if the meat was cooked directly in it.  Even picky kids at it up!

this recipe was absolutely delicious! my boyfriend does not usually enjoy red pasta but thought this was phenomenal. he is always asking me to make it again.  a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: -i added some dried basil to the meatball mixture for more flavor, and some more garlic powder, parsley and pepper as well -i added about 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs and substituted for 1/4 cup of parm instead -added about 2 more cloves of garlic bc i LOVE it  YUM!

Delicious! I had to modify based on what I had here at home, but it was awesome! I accidentally used 1 cup of Parmesan instead of 1 tbsp. Soooo good, though! Here is what I did:  used 1 lb. ground sirloin for the meatballs. Took 4 slices of bread (crusts off) and made bread crumbs with some garlic powder, salt & pepper mixed in. Mixed it all with the ground meat, egg, and 1/2 cup milk. I did brown them on all sides and removed them with a slotted spoon and then sauteed the garlic & onions in the meat drippings. I didn't have 90 minutes to let it all simmer, so I added in one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, some dried basil, and a tsp. of kosher salt. Mixed it up and then put the meatballs in the sauce and let it simmer 30 minutes on low heat while covered. The last 10 minutes of simmering, I added in about 1/2 cup of a good chianti.  Made the spaghetti, drained it, and added in 1 tbsp. butter to the noodles before mixing in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious! Didn't use any sugar or tomato paste, and the meatballs were almost falling apart they were so tender and juicy with cheese starting to pop out from where I used a cup instead of a tablespoon - absolutely amazing dinner!

The most amazing sauce I've ever had. I made the meatballs with fresh parsley, the sauce with diced tomatoes in herbs, but other than that no changes.  It was amazing!! Would make again in a heartbeat.  From now on I won't be buying jar sauce!! YUMMY!

This was a very simple and tasty sauce.  The meatballs were good but I think the sauce stands on its own as well.  I will cut back on the olive oil though because you could see it settle on the top of the sauce even before the meatballs were added.

Thanks for a great recipe - simple, reliable and delicious. It's becoming a weekly regular and always just enough meatballs left for my husband and I to have sandwiches the next day. I sometimes spice up sauce with with a tsp or so of chili flakes. I cut the total time by starting with the sauce and making the meatballs while it simmers. If time is short, I trim the first simmer time from 90 to 60 minutes, then added the meatballs for the another 30 minutes.

This is an awesome recipe!! I didn't have a lot of time, so I made a few changes. I only used the sauce portion of the recipe.  I halved the recipe first, and eliminated the tomatoes. I used tomato sauce in it's place, and cut out the tomato paste. I added oregano and a splash of chicken broth after about 20 minutes of cooking. I also used chopped garlic instead of minced. So good!!! I will probably can this in the future!!!

I followed it exactly and let just say that I've had better homemade spaghetti. But the recipe is not a bad one so I'll definitely use it again with a few adjustments. Next time I won't put any cheese in the meatballs and a lot more salt to both the meatballs and the sauce. I will use diced tomatoes instead and Italian seasonings for more taste in the sauce.

Despite all the rave reviews, I had little confidence on this being a worthwhile recipe.  Happily, I was proven wrong.  In fact, this just might be the ONLY spaghetti sauce I'll ever use from here on out.  Just perfect!!  Even the kids loved it.  To top it off, I have plenty left over to freeze for suture meals.

This was a good recipe.  Personally i think it needs a few more spices, such as garlic and basil.  Thanks for the recipe. I doubled the meatballs and they all were gone.

My first attempt at homemade spaghetti and meatballs and it turned out pretty great! I did not make any changes, but if/when I do it again I will try what another suggested and either blend the tomatoes in a blender or buy them already pureed?? I really liked the meatballs.

I haven't tried making the sauce for this recipe yet but the meatballs are great! Instead of cooking the meatballs in sauce I took a hint from another recipe posted on this site (Fast and Friendly Meatballs) and baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, turned them over and baked them for 5 more minutes. Then I simmered them in sauce. My boyfriend loves them! Thanks for the great recipe!

These meatballs were just okay. They were bland though and it tasted like they were missing some spice. I think I will try a different recipe next time.

Loved it!  Just made slight changes including using 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb Itailian sausage, added onion and garlic powder to the meatballs and baked for a short while in the oven then added to sauce.   I would suggest blending some of the sauce in the blender - Yum!

Added oregano and basil, cut the amount of garlic in half and cooked the meatballs in the oven for a bit first.  Also put the tomatoes in the blender before I started the sauce.  Turned out FANTASTIC.  Loved it and can't wait to make it again.  Made the meatballs with 2 eggs, very moist and delicious.

I made these with my sister for our Italian Christmas Eve feast. They were delicious and very close to my grndma's recipe. I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because i made the first batch with lean ground beef and found them to be kind of tough. I made the next 2 batches with 80/20 ground beef and they were much more tender. THis does not affect the rating bc it was my modification but we added both minced 1/2 an onion and 1/4 milk to each batch which made them a little mushy. I would use one or the other next time to avoid this texture.  I used traditional Prego sauce instead of making our own (family preference) and they were a hit! Thanks!!!

This sauce has great flavor. Instead of whole tomatoes I used a combination of diced and crushed. For the meatballs, I used a combination of beef and pork.

This is the best spaghetti sauce!  I have tried and tried to make a spaghetti sauce that was something special  - and this is what I was looking for!  I followed the recipe exactly and then at the end mashed up the sauce with a potato masher to get the big chunks out.  Every time I had tried to make a sauce before, it would be a bit watery and not "balanced."  This one has the perfect thick texture and it is the perfect rich blend of savory and sweet to cancel out any acidity from the tomatoes.  I WILL make this again...and again...and again!

My little brother requested spaghetti and meatballs for his birthday dinner. He is much younger than me (9) and like most little kids picky but this was a hit and even my little sister (10) who won't eat anything had seconds of the meatballs. The recipe appealed to the adults to getting the stamp of approval from my roommate who works as a chef in an upscale restaurant in my town. I did make a few changes though. Instead of whole tomatoes I used diced, I used 8 garlic cloves, I added all the spices right away, I left out the bay leaf as I had forgotten to pick some up. I used about 2 tbsp of pepper, as well as cayenne pepper. Basil was fresh from my wonderful little herb garden. After simmering for 90 minutes I took a suggestion from below and blended about half of the sauce in the blender to smooth it out. After doing this there was no need for tomato paste as it was quite thick already. Very good!

Perfect and surprisingly not that difficult, but it does take quite a bit of time. I added 1/4 tsp of red chilli pepper flakes to give it a kick.

As usual never have all necessary ingredients. I added 2 cans of tomato sauce because I like it saucy. With that I added an extra bay leaf and more basil, and a ton of onion.  I thought it was very very good. Will definately make again. I guess I should add that I used hot italian sausage and hamburger instead of meatballs.

I really wanted to love this but thought it was only OK after following the recipe exactly as written.  The meatballs were a bit doughy and tasteless.  I'd half the breadcrumbs and add 1/2 cup diced onion and 2 cloves minced fresh garlic.  Also, perhaps 1 tsp italian seasoning.  The sauce was almost a bit too thick and sweet.  I'd forego the tomato paste and substitute with a can of tomato sauce so that there is plenty of sauce for the pasta.  I'd also hold off on the sugar until the sauce is cooked down and add only if you find the sauce to tangy.

This was amazing! I actually changed it up a bit - I had my own spaghetti sauce that I have been using for years - so I only took the meatballs from this. Instead of just using ground beef, I used a mix of ground beef and mild Italian sausage. It was amazing. My husband always said that spaghetti and meatballs taste better the day after rather than the day it's made and when he took a bite he said, "This tastes like day-after spaghetti and meatballs." This will definitely stay in my recipe box!

These are the best meatballs I have ever had! I always switch up the types of tomatoes I put in my sauce and my spices have become my own recipe, but this is a great recipes and a good starting point to turn it into your own!

I went to make pasta and was going to use jar sauce and my 11 year old had a fit, she thinks it's mine. I'm not telling her. After we eat all the meatballs we use the left over sauce for eggplant parm. yummy!!!!! Husbands who rates nothing loves this one.

I decided to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  How can so many people be wrong, right?  Well, it's not very good at all.  The sauce was nothing special, I could've saved myself some time by opening a jar of Classico, tasted pretty much the same and the meatballs tasted like nothing but breadcrumbs.

Delicious, easy and straightforward.  I eyeballed a lot of the ingredients and still came out delicious.  Used 1.5 1b of meat and added an extra egg as well.  Add some crushed red pepper for kick and added meatballs earlier for flavor, after browning in pan.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe!  It was very easy and Very good.  I was worried that the meatballs wouldn't be cooked all the way so I popped them in the oven for about 5 minutes before I added them to the sauce.  I didn't have time to let it simmer for very long but it was still wonderful!

Absolutely delicious! I'll never try another recipe after this one.  The first time I made this dish I used 1 lb. of ground beef, but the meatballs were very bland and didn't cook all the way in the sauce as the recipe calls for. The second time I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 lb. of beef, a little more than 1/2 lb. of italian sausage, and I fried them for about 10 minutes before adding them to the sauce. What a difference! They were phenomenal! Also, I'm not sure how much of a difference this made, but I used fresh herbs instead of dried.

Together this combination is 5 stars.  Separate, I would rate the sauce 5 stars and the meatballs only 3 or 4.  But when you put the two together, you've got delicious.

This is fantastic! I used this for my first time making homemade sauce and it was so yummy! I cooked the meatballs separately because I wanted to make sure I liked the sauce flavor by itself. Instead of the whole peeled tomatoes, I used 5 garden tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes (for 6 servings).

didn't care for the sugar, it made the sauce too sweet, but that's personal preference. First time I made homemade sauce...was a success!

Awesome recipe.  I did not have the peeled tomatoes and used Italian Sauce instead and it was Fab-ulous.  I am Italian and used to home made cooking from Mama and this is pretty close.  Excellent recipe and easy to make!

The sauce gets 5 stars. The meatballs were a little bland, will add more seasoning next time and use fresh garlic instead of powder. No more store bought sauce for this house!

My husband LOVED this recipe. He made a point to tell me to save it. The only issue I had is that you need to put it through a blender at some point and also the meatballs fell apart in the sauce while cooking. They did cook all the way through though, which was doubted by some people. Next time I may saute them a little first.

I made a couple chages to this recipe after tasting it an hour into simmering. I thought it was tasting way too tomatoey so I added 2 TBLS brown sugar and 2 tsp itailan style seasoning. That did the trick. So the changes I made from the beginning were: I used brown surgar instead of white. I pureed the tomatoes, I didn't have tomatoe paste so I used an 8 oz can of roasted garlic tomatoe sauce and 3 TBLS of oats that I blended with the tomatoes to thicken the sauce. I followed the meatballs exactly and they had such a great aroma but kind of lacked in taste. I will play around with more spices the next time I make this. As written this recipe is a 3 or 4, with the changes I made I would give it 5 stars.

I sort of used this recipe as a base for meatballs.  So, I can only rate the meatballs.  I followed the recipe, but did bake the meatballs in the oven and then added them to my own sauce.  Tasty!

A keeper.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce is a huge time saver. The sauce fills the house with the best aroma, and the final product is delicious.

Delicious though I had to modify it at the last minute when I realized my canned tomatoes and paste were expired!  Used mostly tomato sauce + 1 14oz can of whole peeled tomatoes.

This was very good, but a little too salty.  Next time I'll use unsalted tomatoes or cut the salt in half.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made mini meatballs instead of 12 big ones.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe, the sauce was fantastic!  I took advice from reviews, and also browned my meatballs before throwing them in the sauce and it worked beautifully.  The meatballs could use a little more flavour.

I don't care for spaghetti, but my husband and kids love it so I make it every once in a while. Now that I have found this recipe, I might do it every week. It is preposterously good!!! Like others, I was hesitant to cook the meatballs in the sauce, but I'm glad I followed the recipe as written. When my husband got home and tasted a meatball, he was raving about how delicious it was: evenly cooked, not falling apart, and restaurant-quality (a big compliment coming from him!).

I made just the meatballs because I couldn't find my usual meatball recipe.  I substituted a cup of Italian bread crumbs for the fresh, then browned in butter.  I think the bread crumbs made for a drier meatball, but still better than frozen!

This recipe was fabulous!! This is the best Italian sauce that I have eaten. I did cook the meatballs in the oven for 30 minutes at 350° as one of the other reviewers suggested.

The meatballs were great and they cooked wonderfully in the sauce.  However, I found the sauce to be too tomato-y, missing something but I don't know what.

I only used the meatballs from this recipe, as I only had 20 minutes to get dinner on the table. The meatballs alone were outstanding, and I imagine that being slow cooked as opposed to baked (what I ended up doing to get things done) they would be perfect. Next time I'm going to make the sauce and the meatballs.

Update: I made the sauce along with the meatballs and this was a hit! I added some cherry tomatoes and fresh rosemary that were leftover from a previous snack, and simmered for 60 minutes as per instructions, then added the meatballs/basil/tomato paste, and simmered another 60 minutes. The meatballs came out perfect (I made 8 large meatballs instead of 12). I can't believe I didn't make the sauce with these the first time!

I cheated and prebaked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes- I made about 50 little ones. Also, I doubled up the sauce and added 2 8 ounce cans of petite diced tomatoes and a bunch more fresh herbs. That said, these meatballs were super easy and simmered away for an additional hour until they were tender and very tasty. Thanks!

This was pretty good but the sauce itself is very plain.  I added 3/4 tsp of italian seasoning, used 1 TB and 1 tsp fresh basil in place of the dried and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I was afraid that the meatballs would be dry so I added 1/2 cup of milk to the bread crumbs and let them soak for a minute.  They were quite moist this way.  This is a great base recipe that you can play around with.

The sauce is amazing, the meatballs came out a little bit dry. I would suggest adding spicy Italian sausage to the sauce for extra flavor, all in all yummy!!

I followed the ingredients exactly as written, but I did cut off about 20 minutes from the sauce simmering because we were hungry and it was getting late!! :) I really enjoyed this dish - this was a nice mild sauce with a nice mild meatball, it was simplistic in terms of flavor, not too much and not too little. I really enjoyed it and would definitely use this again! It was great with some thin wheat spaghetti noodles and Stef's Super Cheesy Garlic Bread from this site... mmm!! :)

The sauce was outstanding and had a good (thick) consistency.  I wasn't in a hurry so I let it cook an extra 30-40 minutes before I added the meatballs. I added oregano, garlic powder and 1/4 cup of milk to the meatball mixture. The meatballs cooked well in the sauce.  They tasted great but were just a little dry so next time I will try oats instead of breadcrumbs and/or add an extra egg to moisten.  I will definitely make this regularly.

This was a great, tasty recipe. I did reduce the olive oil.   I'm actually eating it right now. Perhaps next time I will add some italian sausage, italian seasoning, or a little bit of salt to the meatballs for more flavour. Still a very good recipe as is.

made this for another couple we had over tonight for dinner and it went over very well! I've never made homemade sauce & meatballs before and this was great! not your ordinary sauce - but we really liked it - though I did use about 1/2 of the oil recommended in the recipe  -  I dont think we missed out by not including all of it. Will certainly make again!

Haven't made the sauce yet, but the meatballs are EXCELLENT. Super easy, I did have my doubts about not cooking the meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but it turned out wonderful. Very moist and tasty!

Darn good! I made the meatballs - the only thing I changed was that I used a 3:1 mixture of fresh whole wheat bread crumbs and dried bread crumbs (I ended up making my own sauce though). Definitely recommend the meatballs!

Yum. My family loved this recipe, including my 2 year old and my 8 month old. VEry tasty and very easy to make. The only thing I did differently was I backed the meatballs before putting them in the sauce. I personally prefer it done this way.

This recipe is yummy!!!  I like to add green pepper to my sauce though.  I also add a lot of cheese to my meatballs.  I love the salty flavor it gives the meat.  Very yummy!  I'm going to try to duplicate this sauce with my fresh tomatoes next week.  We shall see!  Thanks :)

My husband likes Italian sausage in spaghetti, so I usually cut them into meatball sized pieces, brown and add to the sauce.  I decided to try something different so my 14 yo son could have some meat, too (he won't eat the sausage).  It was such a big hit with everyone!  My husband ate the leftovers on ciabatta bread the next day for lunch and said they were even better the 2nd day.  (This rating is only for the meatballs.  I didn't use the sauce recipe, as my son won't eat anything with even a tiny piece of tomato in it.)

This was one of the worst spaghetti sauces I have ever had. I have a meatball recipe handed down 4 generations that I used but I followed the recipe exactly (maybe a bit more garlic), and thought it was horrible. I think I'll stick to my own recipe from now on.

Just made the sauce, and it was alright. There needs to be some step that makes the sauce less chunky. However, sauces are HIGHLY subjective, and I am Italian, so what I rate a 3, you may love. I suggest trying as many recipes as possible to see what your preference is!

2nd time making this recipe. Used a little less oil for onions and garlic, crushed canned tomatoes (instead of whole), a can of diced tomatoes, italian seasoned bread crumbs(instead of fresh plain), and 2 eggs (instead of 1). Entire family raved!

OMG! !  This recipe is one of the BEST that I have ever tried! Great Italian flavors, and the meatballs, WOW!, moist and flavorful. I actually tweeked the recipe from review I read from March of 2007, and by adding a little more parmesean cheese in the meatballs, and garlic powder, to the sauce, in addition to the minced garlic, this recipe is awesome! ! I will definitely make this recipe again and again! !

I'm spoiled having grown up in a household where Grandma spent an entire two days making a vat of homemade spaghetti sauce. This recipe is OK for a quick fix - but nothing beats slow cooked Italian perfection when there is ample time (but who has ample time these days?). Was pleased with the flavor considering the short cooking time - which us busy moms LOVE.  Can't make meatballs though without the classic combo of the three meats - ground beef (at least 85% fat), ground pork and ground veal.  Makes SUCH a huge difference in the texture, taste and consistency of the meatballs. I also increased the amount of parm cheese (used fresh grated)along with some home grown basil. Thanks for the quick dinner fix! Was really ready in 1/2 hour...

Thought this was very good. We used ground turkey. I like my meatballs to be cooked through so this made 36 meatballs versus 12 and also we browned the meatballs in a cast iron skillet on the stove. After they were done we added to a jar of spaghetti sauce. Voila!

This sauce was ok. It lacked flavor, and needs much more kick. I would add the following next time: garlic salt, more herbs, crushed red pepper. The amt. of onion was good. The meat balls were very moist, filling and good. They cooked well in the sauce. In the future I will probably use bought sauce to save on time, and these meatballs.

I only made the meatballs and used jarred sauce because I was short on time.  I thought they were great, and loved that they cooked in the sauce instead of in the oven or skillet--I've never had good luck with those, but these did great.  The only problem was that they burned to the bottom of the saucepan just a bit, even though I had the burner on low.  I would recommend stirring to prevent this.

Very good recipe. I added green peppers and mushrooms and some additional basil and oregano.  The meat balls are a little bland so I will add some extra spices next time, also they cooked perfectly without being browned, huge time saver.  Overall great recipe.... will make again.

The flavours were decent, however I felt it was very salty. I recommend adding salt slowly until it's to your liking.

Awesome recipe. Next time i wish use crushed tomatoes. i was nervous about throwing the meat in with the sauce without cooking first but it was great. next time i'll add just a tad more flavoring to the meat. we're a flavor living family :)

This is a great recipe. The meaty flavor really comes through. I was a bit nervous at first like the rest of you were when it said to cook the meat in the sauce but it worked out splendid. I also added a bit more parm because I'm a cheese freak!!

This was so good and easy to make. I made everything exactly the same, but I added green bell peppers with the oninon and spicy sausage to the sauce. Meatballs were really good and so was the homemade sauce. Everybody loved it. My friends always volunteer me to make "that special spaghetti" for get togethers.

Perfect as written, but very adaptable.  For instance, if you like more garlic/smaller meatballs/more basil, go for it!  Wonderful, full-flavored sauce is the result of the 2 hour cook time AND the idea of cooking the meatballs in the sauce! Can't go wrong with this one!

This was absolutely amazing. My husband just kept saying over and over how much he loved it! The only changes I made were instead of whole tomatoes, I used 3 14oz cans of stewed tomatoes (chopped up). Also added a can of tomato sauce with the paste. I only simmered for 45 minutes on medium before adding the meatballs for an add'l 30 minutes of simmering. It was amazing! Should have probably used one more can of stewed tomatoes though as there wasn't much sauce left after three plates and we like leftovers!

I have never done a review on any any recipe and this recipe was awesome! My father in law is still raving about it and he is the pickiest person on the planet. The only thing I changed was the meat, I used turkey instead. I followed the recipe exactly the way Jeremy posted it. I will use this recipe again!

This rating is solely based on the sauce.  I have to say this is one of THE best sauces I have ever tasted.  I doubled the recipe and used one can of crushed tomatoes and think I'll use all crushed tomatoes next time.  I followed the recipe to the letter except for adding a bit of fresh basil because I ran out of dried.  I will definitely use this instead of jarred from now on.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

We loved this recipe.. my husband, especially. I used half ground beef, half Italian-seasoned ground turkey for the meatballs, let it simmer for a good while, and it was excellent!

Made in the slow cooker, on low, 8 hours. Added 2 pinches baking soda to reduce the acidity (I have home-canned tomatoes and they can be sour) and 1/2t of fennel. Everything else was made according to the recipe. I have never made spaghetti sauce the husband liked before, but he liked this. Even my son said it was awesome, better on day 2. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and my husband said that it's a keeper.  It'll be hard to buy pre-made sauce again, because this sauce was delicious!  I plan on making this sauce to use when I make chicken parmesan.  I only made 2 adjustments.  I used a handful of parmesan in the meatballs because I love it so, and I used my potato masher to mash the tomatoes before I put the meatballs in.

This is the first Spaghetti Sauce that I ever attempted!  I was a little hesitant at first but the results were yummy!  I've made this recipe several times and its soooooo much better than jar sauce, but yet soooooo easy to make!  The only changes that I made were: I chopped the whole tomatoes first and then added 1 28 oz. can of tomatoe sauce.  Without the added sauce it was just too thick.  It makes so much that I always have leftovers to freeze!  So when you make this recipe, you are actually making at least 2 meals!

I always thought meatballs were time-consuming and difficult to make but these meatballs are really quick and easy to make. I have made just the meatballs and used them with store bought sauce and that has worked out well and I have also tried the sauce and I thought it was fine. I love the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that it is fairly quick to get everything together and on the stove to cook.

The flavor was great and it was so easy. I wasn't sure about cooking the meatballs in the sauce but they turned out splendidly. I added fresh basil and oregano to the sauce and I think it helped a lot. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I never knew meatballs could be so delicious and easy!

Super easy.  Very delicious.  The perfect amount of spice balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I was hesitant to cook the meatballs in the sauce, but it made all the difference! Next time I would blend the tomoatoes as well.  Couldn't keep my husband from dipping bread in it while it was simmering!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Not big on making adjustments (who am I kidding?). This was great. I did add about 1/4 cup milk to soften the meatballs, and par-cooked meatballs for 20 minutes in a 325 F. oven on parchment in casserole dish, before adding to the sauce. This was such a hit. Thank you for posting.

This was really good.  My only modification was to use one can of crushed tomatoes in place of one of the cans of whole tomatoes.  However the tomatoes broke down just fine so maybe next time I will just use the whole tomatoes as called for and use a potato masher to break up the chunks.  In the meatballs I did also increase the parmesan chesse to about 1/4 cup and garlic powder to maybe 3 tablespoons and added a little chicken stock.  I made this in my slow cooker and cooked the sauce for three hours before adding the meatballs and remaining ingredients and cooked for about two more hours.  A great classic comfort food recipe that is easy to make all day in the slow cooker.

This is a delicious sauce!  I think the meatballs are still missing some flavor, and next time I will increase the herbs and cheese in them.  Close to what I'm looking for in the perfect Italian spaghetti sauce!

Thank you for such a great recipe! Only changes I made were that I blended the whole tomatoes in the blender before adding to sauce, as I don't care for chunky sauce. Holy cow was this recipe great! My search for a great spaghetti & meatballs recipe is over! I would also advise to use the lean ground beef to avoid an oil slick on your sauce later! Thanks again for such a great recipe, boiling the meatballs in the sauce is the secret to making this sauce amazing. :)

Meatballs only: very good. I would add more seasoning for taste i.e onion powder, salt, and more garlic. I would never have thought to cook them in the sauce. I use canned sauce, despite everyone's claim that the sauce is so good. I have found canned sauce, when added to, is quite delicious.

This was excellent!  I made changes as follows...reduced recipe for 4 servings instead of 6.  Used diced tomatoes with the basil and garlic in them already, so did not use this in the recipe.  Also, used onion powder, as I cannot tolerate whole onions.  Will continue to use this recipe instead of buying sauce for pasta, but will puree the tomatoes a little before cooking...Other than that, was fantastic.

Thank you for this receipe.  I love it.  I made small modification to it.  I use ground turkey and added some fresh basil to the meat mixture.  I also added 3/4 of a teaspoon of dried oregano to the sauce because I love the spice.

This was so garlic-ky and chunky (and I LOVE garlic).  I put it through the food processor afterwards and added some brown sugar because it was so tart.  *shrug*

This recipe was okay, but not fantastic.  To me, it lacked a depth of flavor.  However, I loved cooking the raw meatballs in the sauce.  I'll definitely use that method again (but with a different sauce recipe).

I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, the whole tomatoes stayed whole, so I just cut them up before I cook them now. I doesn't bother me to do the extra cutting - so very tasty! Thanks!

I've used a few spaghetti sauce recipes from this site and I have to say this was the most tasteless.  I did exactly as the recipe said. I wont be using this again.

I looked at several italian meatball and spaghetti sauces before this one really caught my eye - the meatballs were very simple to put together and I pretty much followed the recipe but took another reviewer's advice and added milk, maybe 1/2 cup in total.  I followed the sauce to a tee and couldn't wait to sit down with my husband and enjoy this meal - we loved it!  We even have enough for probably four more meals.  Just delicious ... thank you, Jeremy.

This turns out more like a marinara than a spaghetti sauce. if i make it again i'm adding tomato paste, other than that and a few seasoning tweaks its pretty good.

Amazing flavor! The sauce was delicious and light.  I was uncertain if the meatballs would cook in 30 minutes but they did and they were fabulous! I can no longer make spaghetti with store bought sauce- what a difference between the two.  And this was my first time ever making homemade spaghetti sauce with meatballs. Thanks!!! It is a keeper

This was awesome!  I only had a can of diced tomatoes and a can of stewed tomatoes (both only 16oz.) but it still tasted great!  I threw in a few grape tomatoes just because I was so short on the canned ones. I also used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs for the meatballs.  Wonderful - will make again and again.

This is a great recipe! The meatballs came out really nicely. I did add diced onions to the meatballs and I think that really helped with the flavor. I also added zuchinni, mushrooms and red bell peppers to the sauce which added tons of great flavor!

This is the best recipe for spaghetti and meatballs! Everyone I have made it for loves it. I make just the sauce once a week and use it in other dishes, I will never buy jarred sauce again!!! Thank you Jeremy for sharing such an awesome recipe.

I have made this recipe 2 times already and the sauce is deffinitely a keeper.  this time I added some red wine to the sauce.  The meatballs on the other hand are bland.  I even added double the spice this time but still couldn't make it a reayy good meatball.  Don't get me wrong it's ok but I feel like just having beef in a meatball might be my problem.  I will try to add some ground veal or lamb next time.

This just flat rocks.  I always double the meatballs because we love to make meatball subs (with provolone) with them.  I have to say that this is even better the next day.  It's so easy.  This is a favorite in our house now.  I can't believe that I have now make Spaghetti that my husband loves!  The Meatball Subs are the best.

When I dont have time, I just follow the meatball recipe (adding in fresh italian parsley instead) and simmer the meatballs/steam them in quality premad sauce like bertolli. Then, I drain the oil and add in the rest of the sauce. PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!

One word...delicious! This recipe is simply the BEST Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs that I've ever had.  This has become a staple in our family.  It's inexpensive to prepare, because most of the ingrediants you should already have on hand.  I can't say enough good things.  I've made it with the addition of sauteed vegetables and without and it's amazing either way.  I follow the recipe exactly, and I cook the meatballs in the sauce as opposed to browning them in the frying pan.  I grew up eating them like that and i think this way is MUCH better...but the choice is yours.  You've got to try it!

Very good. I am an experienced tomato sauce chef, and modified it a bit. (1) used one 28 oz can of crushed and one 28 oz of diced. (2) browned meatballs in skillet (along with italian sausage links) PRIOR to saute the onion. (3) only cooked it for about an hour, not the length they said and it turned out fine. We really liked and will save this and do it again!

Really really good. I changed a few things like used Ritz crackers in lieu of the bread crumbs, ground chicken (baked 20 mins @350 before adding to sauce), and added sauteed onion/celery/bell pepper/mushrooms to the sauce to make it more chunky and healthy. I also forgot to add the tomato paste. Still delicious & will eat the leftovers on a meatball sub for lunch today! Nomnom.

After reading the previous reviews for this recipe, I was really excited to try it... However, I was really disappointed with how bland this turned out, especially the meatballs. I have my own spaghetti recipe I use very frequently that I will be sticking with!

Fabulous!   I made with ground beef, but will sub ground turkey breast next time so it is healthier.  I also added other seasonings to the sauce.  I always do that as I like a lot of flavor.

I also added some milk to the meat balls , they were so good and tender. I did brown them a little first to get them sealed. I also added more spices to taste as I went on. As far as bitterness goes, add a little sugar, it is bitter from the tomato paste. My Grand daughter want's it for her 15th birthday next week. I am going to try some Italian sausage with the ground beef.

Mmm! This turned out great.  I used ground turkey instead of beef for the meatballs, and added a dash of worchestershire sauce.  I browned the meatballs and then let them simmer in the sauce (BTW, I used storebought sauce) for about 45 minutes.  Nice meatballs and great-tasting sauce! Super easy, too.

This was very good. I think I might have rolled my meatballs a little tight because they were a little more firm that I wanted. I like a "looser" meatball. Maybe I should have cooked them for only 25 minutes. But other than they were delicious.  I found the sauce to be a little sweet, but that might have been my fault, as I didn't have any bay leafs on hand and had to omit it.  Other than that this was a very good recipe and I will make it again!

I'm only rating the sauce as I wanted to use ground turkey and other reviews warned against it. The sauce was perfect. I did sub 2 cans diced tomatoes for 1 of the whole peeled. Next time I make this I will just use 4 cans of diced because I wound up cutting them up anyways. The kids and I loved it and my husband said it was just okay (he prefers the heavily sugared American versions). Perfect though in the summer I will add some fresh basil.

The meatballs came out perfect. They were solid and extremly filling. My son and boyfriend loved them. The sauce was great, it took longer than the 90 minutes to make because the tomatoes took awhile longer to cook down. I used the ten cloves of garlic and then added three tablespoons of minced garlic from the jar and it was perfect. I also double the bay leaves in the recipe. Its a perfect easy sauce!

Too much bread crumbs and spices in the meatballs.  They ended up tasting like the texture of playdough to me.  Next time I'll use another recipe for meatballs and cook them in a skillet to get the golden brown fried taste I like.  I was expecting a better flavor from the sauce.  Very oily.

I followed this recipe except I added a little bit of milk to the meatballs. It came out very good!  Next time I may use crushed tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes. I give this recipe an A+.

This is a great recipe and so easy to make! I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it.  I let the sauce cook for about 2.5 hrs (with everything but the meatballs) while waiting for the guests to arrive.  Was really terrific!

Great recipe.  My family loved it.  The only thing I would change is to substitute the bread crumbs in the meatball mixture with milk soaked bread pieces.  This will definitely make the meatballs more tender.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is really great! Other people in the reviews talk about ways to get rid of the chunks but forget that, the chunks are the best part. We found adding diced bell pepper made it even better.

Very good. The sauce was richer, I believe, because you render the fat from the meatballs. It adds a great flavor and thickness to the sauce.

This is the recipe my grandkids will be making!  I followed the directions exactly and the result was tried, true and delicious.  The sauce even has a great flavor without the meatballs cooked in it.  Thanks for ending my search for the best sauce ever!

This sauce is excellent, I usually use ground chuck for meatballs to get that hearty beef flavor so I did do that, It tasted even better the next day and we all ate it right up. I will make this again.

I tripled the recipe and all I added was extra salt (2 teaspoons) and more italian seasoning.  Everyone liked it.  They came out very light and tender.

Great recipe, I substituted the ground beef for ground turkey as a healthier option and added oregano in the tomato sauce.  Overall, tasted delicious!

This is the first time I've ever made pasta sauce.  I made it to go with the eggplant parm I'm making tomorrow, so I omited the meatballs.  I'm satisfied with the recipe.  But since its my first time, I dont really have anything to compare this to other than jarred sauce-definitely better than the jar!  I'll probably make this again, but I'll modify it too.  Overall, I think this is a good base sauce...lots of room to be creative.

made this exactly as written the first time and it was 4 stars to me b/c the tomato paste made it really strong flavored.  Second time I did half paste half sauce and added about 1.5 cups red wine and it was much better.  also would recommend upping the sugar to cut the bitterness.  cooking the meatballs in the sauce makes it incredible though!

This was really good. I was skeptical that the meat would cook in the sauce, but it did! I think it could use a little more flavor/spice, but it was really good as is too!!

This was an OK meal.  I was disappointed in how tomato soupy it was. Next time, I would do 1 can of crushed tomatoes, along with a can of tomato sauce - or even Prego as it is my favorite.

I just made the meatballs....they we're definitely good, but not amazing....didn't add the cheese due to allergies....but it tasted like it was missing flavor....maybe add some red pepper or something with some zing next time.

We liked this recipe. We used it for meatball subs rather than spaghetti. We thought that the meatballs needed salt, but other than that they tasted good.  The sauce, while tart, worked well with the french bread and mozarella.  If I were to put it on noodles, I would tame the sauce a bit (maybe use tomato sauce rather than paste?).  Anyway, a good, easy recipe.

Wonderful! I chopped up the whole tomatoes while they were simmering. Might try using fresh bread crumbs next time instead of prepackged bread crumbs. I would add more salt to the meatball mixture next time. Also used fresh grated parmesan on top. Very good!!!!

This was the most delicous recipe I've ever made!!  I was afraid that it would be too chunky because of the tomatoes, but when I added the tomato paste and other spices, everything smoothed out.  My family LOVED it!  I can see why this recipe has over 700 glowing reviews!!

Really easy and REALLY good.  USe a stock pot vs a sauce pan to avoid all the spattering, especially after adding hte meatballs!!! They turned out PERFECT and were totally done after the 30 minutes.  I added 1 extra teaspoon of sugar to the sauce at the end cuz I thought it needed it.  I ommitted the parsley b/c I'm allergic too it---so nice to finally have a sauce that DOES NOT have parsley!!!  I also used the half-salt salt to cut down on the sodium and it was perfect.

My hubby has been searching for his late grandmother's spaghetti sauce recipe for years and he said this is the best sauce he has had next to hers!!!!  This sauce will be made very frequently!!  I did give it 4 stars because I wanted it to be thicker.  Next time I will add another can of tomato paste.

This sauce is fantastic and the meatballs are almost as good as my Moms :o)  My meatball mixture seemed a little dry, I will also double the amount of garlic next time but I am also a garlic lover. Delish!

I've been using this recipe for a few years and my family loves it.  I use stavia rather than sugar and sometimes cursh the tomatoes a bit.  The meatballs are great as well as this pure simple sauce.  Fun to make

Great recipe I made this and my family loved it.  We even used the left over meatballs to make awesome meatball sandwiches.  Will definitely make this again.

Really, really good! Such a simple, easy recipe.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce creates a wonderfully flavored, rich sauce.  I live in Manhattan and regularly go to Little Italy for sauce, and this recipe could hold it's own!  I pureed the original sauce slightly with my emersion blender, my kids don't care for 'chunks' in their sauce.  Otherwise, followed the recipe!

Ok, so I was a bit worried too about not pre-cooking the meatballs, but it does add a lot of flavor to the sauce!  I must confess, I just used a bottled sauce, but it was still delicious.  The meatballs were better than any I have had in any resturant.  I won't by frozen anymore!

Oh my goodness!! This is a wonderful recipe. I increased the garlic, added onion powder and was out of parsley (whoops!) so I added some other spices. And, my husband won't eat cooked tomatoes so I used tomato sauce and only one 15oz can of stewed tomatoes. I know I made some changes but it was still pretty much the same general recipe. Definitely use lean meat!! I accidentally used 80/20 (didn't label it when I froze it) and it was a little greasy but still very good!! This is a keeper recipe for my family. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I was scared of cooking the meatballs in the sauce also, but they turned out great and added a nice flavor.  I'm sure it's not nearly as healthy as cooking them separately, but it sure was easier!

Loved it!  I added a few herbs to the meatballs and I browned the meatballs before adding them to the sauce. But it was still a great recipe!

Ok, I'm not a spaghetti fan.  However, the rest of my family loves it, so I tried this recipe on them.  I added more garlic to the meatball mixture than called for (we love garlic) and some dry Italian seasoning as well, since many complained of the meatballs being bland.  I made smaller meatballs, so I got more than 12.  I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes (I just can't bring myself to throw them in the sauce raw...personal preference here, so no affecting the rating).  In the sauce, I used 1 can whole tomatoes and 1 can crushed tomatoes (but I ended up using a potato masher on them anyway, so next time I will probably use either 2 cans crushed or petite diced).  I also used dried Italian seasoning in place of the dried basil because I felt like it :P.  When I tasted the sauce, I found that it was slightly acidic, so I followed the advice of another reviewer and used about 3/4 tsp. of baking soda...it worked perfectly.  Foamed a little, at first, but after that went away, the sauce was wonderful.  I served over Spaghetti Rigati (I think...the kind with ridges).  I even ate a little!  Thanks for posting!!!

Excellent!  Followed the recipe with one small change... used mild Italian sausage in about a 2 part hamburger 1 part sausage ratio.  Used homemade bread crumbs (super easy); and everyone LOVED it.  Also tripled the recipe without any adjustments. Didn't pre-brown the meatballs and they were wonderful too.

This was my first attempt at making my own sauce and meatballs and it was DELICIOUS!! I won't buy jar spaghetti sauce again and the meatballs were wonderful! I took the advise from another reviewer and rolled them in flour and sauteed them in olive oil till they were browned before putting them in the sauce to cook. Thank you for posting this receipe!

A good, solid recipe to use to jump off with. I prefer another recipe for the meatballs but the sauce is great and lends itself to a lot of tweaking till it suits your tastes.

While the sauce was tasty, the meatballs themselves were pretty bland.  (I even used Italian bread crumbs).  I'll keep looking for a more flavorful meatball perhaps with pork sausage and more spices.  Again--a very nice sauce recipe--not so much for the meatballs.

My family LOVES LOVES LOVES this recipe!!  It is SOOOO easy because you don't have to cook the meatballs other than in the sauce (browning first can be such a mess!).  I crush seasoned croutons for the breadcrumbs (onion and garlic flavor).  Also, once the sauce is finished simmering (right before I add the meatballs), I use a potato masher to crush the whole tomatoes.  Makes the sauce extra yummy and gives it a smoother consistency.

The meatballs were great, but the sauce wasn't my favorite.  We like a thicker, sweeter sauce and this isn't close.  Overall, it wasn't bad...there are just better options on this site in my opinion.

I have always wanted to make meatballs, but figured they were too time consuming. Not any more! I followed the recipe for the meatballs and used store bought sauce, i didn't have all the stuff for the homemade sauce. It turned out so good! My family was so surprised to see the meatballs, and they were so good!:)

This was unbelievable!!  I like a smoother sauce so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced.  I also used italian seasoned bread crumbs in the meat balls and tomato paste with basil, garlic and oregano.  Delicious.

I guess I was expecting more with a recipe that takes 2+ hours. It just wasn't for us. The sauce was way too chunky; hardly anything to dip your garlic bread in, just chunks of tomato. Taste was kind of bland. Meatballs cooked up great though! Won't make again.

Well I made it once and it smelled so good I could hardly wait to try it. I thought i turned it off and I put it on high. So I managed to save some meat balls and couldn't believe the flavor. Dee-lish. I made the whole thing over this am and my daughter says it is like eating out. Wonderful recipe by far the best one I have ever made and I have made plenty. Thank you for this one!!

A bit too much of a tomato taste, I added 2 cubes of beef boullion to the sauce to get my taste buds going.  Also, shredded carrot to the sauce gets some vegis into the kids.

This spaghetti sauce was incredible!  We loved it.  I did pre-cook the meatballs first which I think added just a little more flavor, and I did use a little more garlic than was called for.  Not that it needed it really, just personal preference.  Will definitely make this one again!

Fantastic sauce!  My kids like a smooth sauce with no chunks at all so I sent it through the blender prior to adding the meatballs and it turned out amazing!  I will be using this recipe from now on.

The last time I tried to make spaghetti with meatballs was a total disaster. I was scared to try again, but I saw all of the positive reviews for this recipe and I became inspired. I gave it a shot and it turned out wonderfully. This recipe is the best! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic and so easy to make! I made this for the first time last week and both me and my boyfriend loved it! It tastes like the sauce my Italian neighbors used to make when I was a kid. I made this again last night for a dinner party (doubled the recipe) and accidentally cooked it an extra 10 minutes. It came out even better which I didn't think possible! I am making this again so I can freeze the sauce for a rainy day.

I was so disappointed because I wasn't able to make the meatballs!  My daughter put the meat in the freezer!  I didn't have time to thaw for meatballs.  SO...I made a meat sauce with all the ingredients except the bread and egg.  I had to throw in bunches more seasonings as we love our spaghetti with gobs of flavor.  That was my only complaint with this recipe!

Wow!  What an awesome recipe.  Fast, easy and incredibly tasty.  I added a little more garlic to sauce (personal preference).  Ilove rscipes that are to the pint and really deliver.  Thanks!

Loved the consistency of the sauce.  It really is one of the better sauces around.  The meatballs were so-so for me.  A few changes though - I only had one can of tomatoes so I used 2 small cartons of passatta in place of the second can and cut back the salt to 1tsp.  Will cut it back further next time as was still too salty for our tastes.  I also browned the meatballs in the oven first (175C for 20mins) then popped them into the sauce for 20mins to simmer.  I also added some veggies.  Will be making this again.

Very delicious flavor, but I had trouble keeping my meatballs "solid".  They seemed to want to fall apart.  I'm assuming operator error (pack tighter?) or more bread crumbs were needed.

I found the sauce too salty and thin and the meatballs bland. Seemed the sauce needed less salt and the meatballs needed more! Or something to give them flavor!

I needed a good recipe for meatballs and decided to try this one. It's very good. Next time I would put more herbs in it and I would add some salt. I baked them in the oven and added them to my own sauce recipe. Very tasty!

This was the best sauce and meatballs I have ever made. I do have to admit, I took liberty with some additional spices for the meat balls and added cream to keep them moist.  I used fresh minced garlic, and minced fresh oregano, basil and some time and added to the meatballs. I also browned my meatballs in EVOO before adding to the sauce. I did not use sugar. I made the sauce just as directed but added fresh chopped basil.  I used half of the recommend onion.  Also I used two turkish bay leaves.  They have such a beautiful aroma.  Instead of Parmesan cheese I used Asiago, Romano and shredded chedder cheeses.  Absolutly fabulous base for a recipe.  Thank you!

Extremely good!!! My husband and I loved this recipe. I usually don't even like spaghetti sauce with tomatoes in it and I still ate it. I added seasoning salt to the first round of seasonings to simmer. I also used diced tomatoes instead of the whole because it was all I had in the pantry. I added a 1/2 cup of milk to the meatballs just to make sure that they weren't dry. Overall I am very happy that I chose this dish to make.

This is so good even I managed not to screw it up!  I had to improvise because I didn't have the 28 oz of the tomatos called for. I ended up using 2 cans of tomato sauce to make up the difference. I have a very low tolerance for anything with acid, so I used another reviewers suggestion to use a pinch of baking soda. This helped enough so that I could put a little bit on my spaghetti - pretty yummy. Both my husband and mother raved about it. It is definately a keeper

I really enjoyed the sauce but the meatballs are less to be desired. Next time I will definitley add more spices and way less bread crumbs to the meatballs. I probably will also fry them alittle in olive oil.

these were so good! yum.. I kind of used the ingredients and then improvised a little. I used shredded cheddar instead of parmesan, added some worcestershire sauce and, believe it or not, about a tbsp of sour cream and onion mix. And oh, I added a dash of milk as well because it seemed a little dry. They tasted like heaven! I did the same thing with the sauce. I added balsamic vinegar, worcestershire sauce and stock. It was the best meatball recipe I have ever used! I will keep this forever :)

Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I followed your recipe but added a little red wine and let everything cook in the crockpot all day.  The meat balls turned out so tender and moist.  I served the sauce with homemade gnocchi -- yum.  :o)  Perfect for a cold winter's day.

The meatballs in this recipe were definately 5 stars, however, I only gave 4 stars because I really didn't care for the sauce.  It wasn't bad, just seemed like it was missing something.  Probably won't make the sauce again, but the meatballs will be made over and over again!!!  Thanks!

Can't rate the sauce, since I made my own, but these were really good meatballs.  Getting 4 stars because I had to add milk so that they wouldn't be too dry, but the flavor was really good.  Cooked these in a kalamata tomato sauce I threw together and served the easy polenta with tomato sauce (minus the tomato sauce) from this site with them.  Very tasty, and even my 4 year old ate these, so they will definitely be made again!

This was good but not "excellent."  I followed the recipe, except I used crushed and pureed tomatoes.  I served this for a sleepover my daughter was having, and the kids loved it - though kids  don't having the most discerning taste buds(!).  I think next time I'll add Italian seasonings and plenty of oregano and see what happens.  I might also try using fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Obviously, I'll make this again, but I'll still look for a recipe I might prefer.

I didn't try the sauce as I have my own recipe but made the meatballs.  They were good... held together very well.  I think next time I might add a few more spices to them, but I have no complaints.  Followed the recipe exactly to make the meatballs, but let them cook in the sauce longer.  I'll make again.  Thanks!

The best meatballs I have ever had!  The sauce was great too! I added some crushed red pepper to the sauce and used italian seasoned bread crumbs in the meatballs.  My husband and son LOVED the meatballs and my Mom and Dad both said they tasted like something you would eat in a restaurant.  I made a double batch of meatballs and used the leftovers for meatball sandwiches later in the week...GREAT RECIPE!

Fantastic meal!! My husband and I usually don't like meatballs, but I made it because my girls do. He and I ended up really enjoying it! Here are my changes: used cans of tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes, used only 1.5 tsps of salt but was still a bit too salty for my taste, had no bay leaves but didn't seem to make a difference, in the meatballs I used ground up italian flavored croutons like someone else mentioned, I did not use egg but I added a TBSP each of tom. sauce, olive oil, and water, I also browned meatballs a bit in olive oil. It was a very rich sauce b/t the oil and the meat but just delicious!!!

This was my 1st time making homemade sauce and meatballs. It was surprisingly easy to make and although I was a bit nervous about the meatballs cooking through, they turned out DELICIOUS!! I did make a few changes as recommended by other viewers. MEATBALLS: used 1 lb beef and added 4 oz of ground pork. Used 2 Tbs Parm. SAUCE: used only ONE can large peeled tomatoes and added 2 small cans crushed tomatoes. After simmer, added small can of tomato sauce with the tomato paste. Also added 1 tsp. italian seasoning and 1 tsp. garlic powder. 

Boy this was good. Can't wait to make again for more people!!!

If you want moist meatballs, then you should BROWN them in EVOO o all sides ....THEN you throw them in the sauce to finish cooking.It seals in the juices! I also SOAK the bread crumbs in milk for a short while then squeeze out the excess. In addition to my additions (hehe)Use the veal, pork, beef mixture and you are sure to be guaranteed a moist DELICIOUS meatball! Anyways- YES -GREAT RECIPE!

This is better than any spaghetti dish in a restaurant.  The sauce is unbelievable!  Note- you may want to break up the tomatoes before simmering.

My review is only for the sauce as I did not have time to make the meatballs. I just used premade meatballs. The sauce was awesome!  So much better than a jarred sauce.  I made exactly as written except increased the sugar to more like 1 tablespoon to cut down on more of the acidity.  After the sauce had simmered for the 90 minutes I emersion blended the sauce to make a smooth consistency because the tomatoes were still whole. Then I whisked in the tomato paste.

I give this sauce a five star for sure!  It was ab-fab!!  I didn't make the meatballs, instead I used ground beef and sliced up grilled Italian sausages.  As a personal preference I used mostly diced toms and a few whole.  I also added green peppers to the first step with the onions.  My boyfriend raved! I will definitely use this as a base to work from the next time I make a red sauce.  I am using the leftover tonight with chicken parm!

If I could give this more stars I would. I love this sauce. It has a mild sweet flavor and the meatballs are delicious. I usually use half turkey, half beef for the meatballs and I cook them in the oven for about 30 mins on 350, then I drop them in the sauce. For some odd reason, I just haven't cooked the meatballs directly in the sauce yet. The kids love this recipe. I will definitely be making this over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I can only rate half the recipe which were the meatballs! These were the best meatballs I've made thus far! I was very leary about the lack of ingredients. The recipe did not call for onion, which I have always put into my meatballs prior...well never again. These meatballs had so much flavor AS IS!!! I buy my hamburger meat in bulk and make a TON (I multiplied this recipe by 3) of meatballs to freeze for future uses. I did have to bake them since I was not putting them into a sauce to cook. These were phenomenal! So juicy, moist tender and FULL of Flavor! 
I will use this as my meatball recipe from here on out!

So simple, so straightforward, so good.  I have been trying to duplicate my grandmother's meatballs for about 15 years now.  Always trying the fancy recipes using veal and pork along with the beef, never quite getting it.  This is THE recipe.  It is really perfect!

This recipe was great!  My husband and I both loved this recipe which is rare.  The only change I may make in the future is to mash up the tomatoes before I add the meatballs - my husband was not to fond of the whole tomatoes in the sauce.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic.  I have been looking for a "homemade" spaghetti sauce for quite a while.  I used my own canned whole tomatoes (2 quarts) changed the measurements accordingly.  It is even better the next day.  I made it like the recipe with the following additions:  extra sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes.  No added salt as there was some in the canned tomatoes. I also added dried basil and dried oregano as well as garlic powder.  Next time I would add extra italian seasoning as well.  But a phenomenal recipe!!  This was just for the sauce as I just added ground beef...next time I will make the meatballs.

Pretty good sauce but TOOO much salt.  I would definitely cut it down to 1 tsp.  I added another can of tomatoes and it was still way too salty.

I'm only reviewing the meatballs and cooking style...I used jar sauce.  The meatballs are great though!  I was skeptical because my sister said she made some (diff recipe) that turned out bland and I had never made meatballs before, but my husband loved them.

This was good, but I felt that there was something missing. I also thought that the meatballs were way too salty. If I make it again, I will modify the recipe to suit my tastes better.

I had never made homemade sauce and meatballs before I found this recipe. I've now made it (as is, no changes) twice and it is SO delicious! Even my super-talented-in-the-kitchen roommate loves it.

Really loved the sauce, though at first bite, it tasted a bit too salty.  The meatballs were tasty too, but a little greasy; I have to be sure to try a better quality of ground beef next time (any suggestions?).  I liked too that someone here suggested baking the meatballs instead of frying them; when I was cooking them, I felt like I burned them, so maybe baking is my answer.  Since I'm a single gal, this recipe produced plenty of leftovers, so I froze the meatballs in the sauce.  Looking forward to the leftovers this week!  Happy with the recipe overall, and I will definitely make again.

So I only gave 4 stars because of the additions i made to the sauce and the meatballs.  Even with the additons to the meatballs they still tasted a little to burgerish.  Next time I will cut the hamburger with a little zesty sausage.  The sauce unmodified was actually good but not as spicy as we liked it to be so I added italian type seasonings and it was very yummy.  I also pureed half the recipe and used all diced tomatos.  Made it a lot smoother but with some chunks

This was voted "good", (3 star) but not the wonderful flavor we were all hoping for.  I cut the garlic to three cloves and wish I'd cut another one.  Sort of overwhelming.  Seems I've tried other home-made recipes and liked them much better.

My daughter wanted spaghetti and meatballs for her birthday dinner so I thought I would pull up a five-star recipe and make the sauce from scratch. Something I rarely do. It was OK. Didn't like the whole tomatoes. Seems most people who rate this recipe high have adjusted it. I won't make it again.

If I hadn't made changes to the meatballs, I don't think they would have had much flavor, and I think they would have been too bread-y.  I used a little over a pound of ground beef, added some water, used a little UNDER a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs, added much more garlic powder and cheese.  I broiled them for a little over ten minutes before putting them in the pot because we like the flavor.  They tasted pretty good with my changes, but they were right on the cusp of being bland.  The sauce was good with the addition of oregano, garlic powder and a little extra sugar.  I didn't have/use the tomato paste, but found it thick enough if I mashed the tomatoes.  Used one can whole peeled tomatoes, one can diced.  Replaced onions with onion powder and used jarred minced garlic.  I liked the sauce a lot with the changes, and I'll probably make this again if I jazz up the meatballs a little more (probably with more garlic; we like garlic).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe, my boyfriend and I loved it but I did bake the meatballs for 20 min @ 450 degrees as I didn't have time to simmer them for 90 minutes in the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

Great Sauce ! and meatballs ! My boyfriend loved them ! Even more than his mothers! Thanks this was great ! Even better the second day !! I put the leftover sauce and spaghetti in a casserole dish with mozzarella cheese on top in the oven covered with aluminium foil for about 30 minutes.. and it was awesome.

This makes really good spaghetti and meatballs!  Instead of 2 (28 oz. cans) whole tomatoes, I used only 1, and then 2 (14 oz) cans diced tomatoes. I added about 1/4 c. milk to the meat ball mixture.  Otherwise followed recipe.  I will make this again.

I made the sauce exactly as written and it was a huge hit.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone complimented it.  I will make this again and it will probably be my go-to red sauce.  Very easy to make.  I didn't make the meatballs because my boyfriend has his own recipe for them.

I skipped the meatballs and made only the sauce because we were short on time and didn't really need the meat, so this is for the sauce portion only. I did make many changes according to other's suggestions and let me say this was awesome! I will make this recipe from now on (as long as I have the time). Here are some of the changes I made: added 2 celery stalks (chopped), used 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes and 2 (14 oz) cans of diced tomatoes, a little extra sugar, added italian seasoning, green bell pepper, and a serrano pepper. I will avoid that jarred spaghetti sauce at all cost from now on, because this recipe was so easy and so delicious! Thank you Jeremy!

LOVED IT! Followed the recipe almost exactly...just added a bit of Italian seasoning to the sauce and the meatballs. Also used my stick blender in the sauce to make it a bit more smooth.

Wow! I've never made homemade sauce before, but I will never buy it again that's for sure. I used most of the suggested changes/additions posted by Newlywedws for the sauce and intend to use this recipe from here on out. I didn't make meatballs because hubby doesn't like them (or italian sausage) so I added a little plain ground beef, and it still came out great! and even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought the sauce was pretty tasty.  The meatballs were a bit on the dry side for my taste, so next time I make this recipe I will follow some of the other reviews to make them juicier...  Overall, good sauce!

I use a canned sauce because the sauce takes too long.  I only use this recipe for the meatballs.  I also add onion, garlic, and italian seasonings to the meat.

This recipe was great! the only thing I changed was to use seasoned bread crumbs because that's all I had at the time.I doubled the sauce after the first time because I like a lot of it and because I can add pasta to have enough to feed my nephews if they find out I am making it. They love it!

I gave this 4 stars because it's a great base, but I made modifications for my own tastes.  I doubled the recipe, and in addition added, 1.5c. chopped bell peppers, 1.5c mushrooms, and mixed the ground beef for the meatblass with 1lb ground turkey.  I browned the meatballs before putting them in the sauce to give them a bit more texture, and also added oregano and basil to the sauce.  I served it over spaghetti squash.  I was wonderful!

This was my first attempt at making homemade spaghetti sauce and it was amazing.  I will never go back to premade sauce again.  I did change to recipe by using ground venison for the meatballs.  Came out perfect.  Also added mushrooms to the sauce.  I will be using this sauce for the "Baked Ziti I" recipe.

A surprisingly easy recipe with great flavor that works well for meatball subs as well as for spaghetti.  I used shredded parmesan cheese which resulted in lumpy meatballs, so next time I'll grate my own parmesan cheese.  I might also add oregano, fennel or red pepper flakes to tweak the flavor a bit.

I really liked this recipe.  I was hesitant to add the meatballs without pre-cooking them, but I am glad that I did.  They gave the sauce a great flavor.  Also, some of the pieces of meatball broke up into the sauce making it "thicker and meatier" as my husband says.  I took this to a pot luck and there was none of it left!  Served with angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is very similar to my father's, only without the wine.  If you want a little kick, add 1/4 cup Lambrusco.  Make sure you cook it for a long time, as directed in the recipe.  It would be a good slow cooker recipe, too.  Yum!!  It's a keeper!

This recipe is amazing! I did what one of the reviews said to do. Replace some of the ground beef with some ground pork. I actually did half beef and half pork. I did use seasoned bread crumbs. And for the sauce. Def. use not only whole tomatoes but also crushed ones. One thing is start early...my family and I ate late seeing that the sauce needs to simmer for 90mins then for 30 with the meatballs in. But make this for your family this is one of the best meals/ easy meals that everyone will enjoy!

I do not make the meatballs regularly (I didn't think they were very flavorful)but this pasta sauce is absolutely delicious. Modifications that I use: I sprinkle fresh basil on it before serving. I also add 2 bay leafs when cooking. Just excellent!

This rating is just for the meatballs. They were great. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh parsley in lieu of dried.

I made this last night and my husband loved it!  The only thing I would change next time is to use chopped tomatoes.  I added a few of my own spices here and there but it was overall a good recipe.

Wow this was great! I used dry Italian seasoning to taste to kind of round out the sauce more to our taste.  I also added 2 (8oz) cans tomato sauce to give more liquid.  Did use a recommendation from another poster and added red wine.  This is a keeper-great comfort food!

Wonderful recipe.  This recipe is incredibly easy.  I do precook my meatballs to save time and we like the carmelized coating on the meatballs, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  My husband actually prefers this now to his 100% Italian mom's sauce - quite an accomplishment, I'd say.

This recipe was decent. Typically, genuine Italian food is abundant with spices and this recipe would reflect a chef's kitchen that needed to go spice shopping!

I thought that this recipe was only so so.  Granted I did double it, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere along the line, but I really don't think so.  Don't think I will make this again.

Great!  I've always wanted to make my own sauce, and this works really well.  The only problem I had was that the recipe seemed to have a greater proportion of meatballs than sauce.  I always add a bit more spice and garlic to Italian recipes, and I did with this one as well.

With the simple changes suggested in user reviews the meatballs are definitely a 5-star, but I was on a bit of time crunch and didn't make the sauce. I read the other reviews and added a 1/2 cup milk and about 1 tsp of italian seasoning. I accidentally forgot the parmesan but they were still fantastic! Very moist and tasted great. Maybe needed just a tad more seasonings. Thanks!

Delicious! Like previous posters, I added a bit more Parmesan cheese (about double the amount) and dried parsley into the meatballs. As well, I substituted brown sugar for white and added a bit of milk to make the meatballs juicer.  Will definitely have make a double batch next time as it froze well and was nice to keep on hand. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a very easy recipe to make, especially since the meatballs do not have to be precooked.  I used 28 oz of crushed tomatoes and 28 oz of whole tomatoes, otherwise it would have been too chunky. Also, since I didn't have fresh bread crumbs, I used dry seasoned bread crumbs and added 1/2 cup of milk to give it some moisture.  The meatballs are large but cooked thoroughly in the sauce after only 30 minutes.  I added some extra seasonings to the sauce and the meatballs.  Next time I'll add a little more garlic.

This recipe is great. I used italian bread, added more garlic and 1/4c of milk to the meatballs.  I browned them first before putting them in the sauce.  My family is picky about tomatoes so I also blended them first and I left out the bay leaf.  My husband was very pleased! Wow! Now that's impressive.  I had double the meat so I made extra meatballs that I put in a baking dish and cooked at 350 in the oven.  I'm not sure how long.  I just kept checking it. As soon as I took them out, my husband immediately put them in a roll and ate them.  Success!

Delicious meatballs!  I was out of bread crumbs so I used 1 c oats (chopped in the food processor).  I was worried the meatballs would not cook all the way through in the sauce, but they came out brown and tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

I ate it but I thought the meatballs were really bad. They were bland and the texture was strange. I think the recipe may call for too much bread crumbs. They tasted like bad meatloaf, not meatballs.

Everyone said this was the best spaghetti sauce they had ever had.  I thought it was a bit too runny, next time I will add more tomatoes and simmer longer.  I also followed other reviewers' recommendation to add milk to the meat balls.  Very yummy.

I've made this recipe over and over and it's always a hit. I like cheese and zip so I add more parmesian and spices but I do everything else just as stated. I imagine you could save time and prepare the meatballs a day ahead to save some prep time for the meal (but I haven't tried this yet).

The meatballs were very tasty however the sauce was not what I was hoping for.  I followed the recipe and the only change I made was to cut up the tomatoes before adding them.  The sauce tasted very acidic and didn't suit the tastes of my family.  I will keep the meatball recipe and use that again.

This was good, alot more moist than meatballs in the oven but next time I think I will substitute garlic salt for the garlic powder and maybe add either some cajun seasoning or season salt. The meatballs were kind of bland. I am putting them on hoagie rolls today toped with provolone for meatball subs and they look great!

scrumptious! I have made this several times, I try to break up the whole tomatoes so that the sauce isn't all that chunky (otherwise the tomatoes will be in big sloppy pieces). I also add a touch more red pepper and a touch more sugar. I have tasted better meatballs, however. But the sauce is VERY yummy!!

These meatballs are wonderful!  My husband, who won't eat meatballs, ate them two nights in a row.  First, on spaghetti and then the leftovers as meatball subs the next day.  The sauce was a bit too tomatoey for us, but it was still a good solid sauce.   LOVE the meatballs and will definitely be making them again!

I needed a new meatball recipe & stumbled upon this one...I was lazy and used crushed up saltine crackers (about 15-16 of them) instead of the breadcrumbs. I used 2 jars of pasta sauce, because that is what I had & will try the sauce recipe another time. We all loved the texture & flavor of the meatballs cooked in the sauce & very easy to make! Love it!

This is amazing spaghetti sauce! My hubby and I were very pleased.  I let it simmer several hours on the stove. I didn't change anything about this recipe other than adding a little oregeno to the sauce. Perfecto!

I liked the sauce very much and my husband who HATES red sauce even said it was good for marinara.  However, the meatballs didn't turn ou that great.  I think partly because they lacked something in the flavor department, and because I cooked them a few minutes longer than I should have.  I will try this again though!  Thank you.

This was a great recipe.  I made a double batch and froze half of it.  It was just as good the second time around as it was fresly made.  My picky 9 year old loved it and keep coming back for more.  This is definitely a keeper.

I only made the spaghetti sauce of this recipes, as I had already thought i found a meatball recipe I liked (boo, they were awful) I wish I had made this with the meatballs because the sauce was VERY GOOD! My only problem was mine seems a bit runnier than I like spaghetti sauce but this was not bad at all. It had awesome flavor and before I threw it away when cleaning up, I ate a bit more of it by just dipping my garlic toast in it. Yummy.

Great recipe - my husband loved it and said "no more sauce out of jars!".  I let the ingredients simmer for about 4 hours on low in the slow cooker, and cheated by using frozen meatballs.  It was still tasty!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe really disappointed me.  I had to add alot of extra garlic to get enough flavor.  With all the extra garlic I added it was o.k. but not worth the long cook time.  I could find something just as good in a bottle.

Sorry. Not sure where I went wrong.  The meatballs were dry and the sauce did not have a good taste or smell.  This was quick and easy to prepare.  Saved the leftovers in hopes it will be better on Day 2.

This is a great recipe!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and added onion soup mix to the meatballs.  I liked the chunky sauce.

This recipe is outstanding!  For the meatballs, I did add a pound of Italian sausage and just doubled the other ingredients (except the ground beef, it stayed the same).  My whole family loved it!  Will definitely be making this dish again.

I only made the meatballs, I used store-bought sauce instead.  We liked the meatballs made exactly like the recipe states, but they weren't fantastic.  I'm still searching for a great meatball recipe.

My husband and I did not care for this sauce.  I know this is an authentic Italian sauce, however, we prefer a thicker, richer pasta sauce.  We eat pasta about twice a week and will stick to making sauce our usual way.  It was just a little too watery and bland for our liking.

Always tried to make my own sauce or combining jar with my own ingredients, but I think I over did it. Less is simply more in this easy and delicious recipe. Hubby is eating it now and says its delicious and loves the meatballs. I put them in the sauce for the entire last hour. Thanks so much. I always come to this website when trying something new. Thanks so muc.

I was expecting more than what the recipe delivered with all the great reviews.  I found the meatballs to be very bland and the sauce was very tangy/tart.  I added more sugar to sweeten the sauce some and it still didn't do the trick.  Won't be making again.

I want to say first that this was fast very easy,.. that's very important to me. The taste is just as important and my family enjoyed it very much. I finely chopped some precooked sausage and added it in to the meatballs.  You could use any kind that you think would taste good. I used a whiskey fennel sausage that was in the fridge from the weekend BBQ,.. worked out very nice.  I will definately make this again!

Love it.  Make it about once a month for my family,including picky toddlers.  Only change is that I cook the sauce for about an hour, then add meatballs and cook another hour to be sure they're cooked through.

My boyfriend really liked this dish.  I thought it was good.  I didn't think it was a 5 star, but that might be because I am not a big meatball fan.  These were okay so for those of you who like meatballs these might be fantastic.  I will cook again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe the first time I ever made homemade meatballs. It is easy to follow and the results are amazing. I followed others' recommendations and used 2 eggs instead of 1 and the meatballs are moist and stick together really well. I also baked the meatballs in the oven for 10 minutes before placing them in the sauce, which works great. Very yummy recipe. I use it everytime my husband is craving his spaghettie and meatballs and he loves it, as do I!

I hate to give this only four stars but the sauce just wasn't that great.  The thing I really did love was the fact that you could put raw meatballs in a sauce and they were fab!!!  I did what some of the other reviews has said and used the crushed tomatoes, but next time I think i will use whole i like mine chunky and maybe even some added veggies.  it does have playing room i will try again and try more chunky veggies.  Thanks.

I liked this sauce alot but i felt using both tomatao paste and a can of whole peeled tomato was just redudant. 
I added some rosemary to the meatballs mixture and it was lovely.

The meatballs were good but the sauce was too thick and lumpy and I still think it needs something else.....  I think I might try to put the tomatoes in blender next time.

We made this recipe for my son's birthday.  It was a big hit.  Everone just raved about it.  The flavor of the sauce is supurb.  I added fresh mushrooms and zucchini and shredded carrots.  But the base sauce is what made the dish.

So I think my 85 year old grandmother made better meatballs, but I couldn't tell you why (maybe because she been cooking for 75 years). But when I made this recipe I caught my roomate at midnight eating out of th pan, he had eaten nearly all of the meatballs. According to him, they are the best he's ever had, and he's a serious, serious, food lover. We all thourougly enjoyed this recipe, clearly, thank you!!

This recipe was xcellent! only thing I would change next time I make it, would be to add the meatballs a little eariler, they took a little longer to cook. The perfect comfort food, reminded me of spaghetti and meatballs I had when I was a kid. Will definitley make again!

I'm just rating the spaghetti sauce - I made it to go with 'The Best Meatballs You'll Ever Have' from this site. I added a little canned chicken broth when the sauce got too thick. We really enjoyed it. Thanks, Jeremy!

With all the great reviews, I had high hopes for this.  The meatballs were good, but we weren't too impressed with the sauce.  It was way too salty!!  I happen to love salt, but this was a little much even for me.  I thought it was a little runny, and preferred eating the leftover meatballs as sandwiches instead.  I may make the meatballs again, but I would rather have the sauce come from a jar.

The sauce recipe is very similar to my own sauce which gets great raves.The meatball recipe is awsome! My meatballs were always sort of mushy and fell apart. These meatballs have a nice firm texture and held up well after a long simmer. I added my own touches and cooked them in the oven for 20 minutes. They were delicious.

The sauce was excellent. The meatballs turned out a little dry, so i added in some meat sauce. I also added onions which gave them a great flavour.

Tasty recipe. Everyone enjoyed this one. Meatballs were flavorful and tender, though they were a bit time consuming to make.

Served this to company.  It was excellent, the meatballs are very tasty and moist and the sauce was delicious.  I did add mushrooms and green peppers.

My family didn't like the sauce at all.  It was more tomatoes than sauce and it didn't have a good smell.  We didn't try the meatballs.

Excellent meatballs, the only thing I changed was I used fresh shredded parm cheese instead of grated. This was my first time making meatballs-recipe is very easy and yummy-thanks.

Made for dinner last night and it's so good! I used crushed tomatoes rather than whole, but just because I don't like chunky sauce. Only other change is I threw in some italian seasoning. Good for a cold night. Meatballs are simple and yummy. Thanks for sharing!

This is fabulous!  I've been making a quickie spaghetti sauce (that is great when you need it quick) for a couple years and the flavor difference in this sauce is astounding!  My picky 2.5 yr old daughter even ate the meatballs (and she does NOT like meat!).  My picky 5yr old loved it and has already asked to have it for lunch tomorrow.  
I cut the salt in half (those canned tomatoes have a lot of salt already), used fresh parsley instead of dried, used my hand blender to make it a little more saucy and added some sliced crimini mushrooms about 10 minutes before done.  Great recipe and I will be making it again!  Thanks!

These meatballs were wonderful. This is definitely an award-winning recipe. My whole family loved it and it makes quick and easy leftovers. I did, however, have simmer the meatballs for longer than 30 minutes for them to cook all the way through. I had made twice the original recipe, so that may be the reason they were undercooked. Didn't matter to me--I still love it!!

I only made the meatballs in this recipe and combined them with the Arrabiata Sauce recipe I found on this site... very yummy combo. These meatballs are very, very easy and are great, especially left over. I think they are a nice, basic meatball that can be added to for variety. This is a keeper!

Great flavor- even better the next day.  Though skeptical, I put the raw meatballs in the sauce and they turned out great.
The only change I made was to put the whole tomatoes in the food processor to chop them up a little bit.  Will definitely make again!

This was fantastic!  I used fresh, peeled and diced tomatoes, rather than canned and used 2 small cans of tomato paste instead.  The sauce came out the perfect consistency and I really enjoyed the meatballs too, though my boyfriend said they weren't quite flavorful enough for him.  I think next time I will add fresh diced garlic to the meatballs to spice them up just a little bit.  Great recipe!

We had a spaghetti and meatball luncheon at work and this was a big hit. My batch was the first to go. The meatballs are wonderful and the sauce is so easy to make. The only thing I did different was use one can of tomato puree and one can of diced tomatoes in place of the whole canned tomatoes. Also, I used my Pampered Chef food chopper to really finely chop up the onions so there weren't big chunks in the sauce. This is a keeper!

This was ok. The meatballs to us were rather bland and the sauce was also a little tasteless, but tasted a little better the next day after the flavors blended together. I used brown sugar instead of white. Still not my favorite spaghetti recipe so I'll keep looking. 
Thanks though.

I baked the meatballs in my oven for 30 minutes (325 degress) before adding them to the sauce.  Then, I put the sauce and meatballs in my crockpot and cooked it all night, instead of on the stove because I couldn't watch it -- safer for me to use the crockpot!  Anyway, this suace is SO good and the meatballs are fabulous!  I must add:  I don't traditionally like meatballs, but my 18 mo. old son does.  Now I do too!  This recipe is so easy and really impressive!

I thought this was a little mild in seasonings for me...both the meatballs and the sauce BUT...having said that...it's a wonderful base to add to your own taste to...and I never knew you could actually put RAW meatballs in sauce and have them cook so well! THAT Idea I will be using over and over with other meatball meals! thanks Jeremy!!

WOW!!! I have to start off by saying that I was never a fan of spaghetti (I made this dish for my husband) but this truly blew me away! Another reviewer mentioned that the sauce had huge tomatoes in it and had to cut them up with scissors – all you need to do, some time while it’s cooking, is to crush/smash the whole tomatoes with the back of your cooking spoon and the result will be a delicious, chunky sauce. I also used Progresso plain bread crumbs, in place of the fresh crumbs, for the meatballs, and they still came out great.

This is now my favorite meatball recipe.  By the way, at our house, it serves ONE-AND-A-HALF people, rather than six.  I changed it very little--doubled the garlic powder and baked the meatballs in the oven for 30 minutes before adding them to my usual sauce (just a big can of spaghetti sauce mixed with a can of tomato soup--quick and easy and sweet).

The meatballs where great. The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste (and my husband's)--although my daughter says that this is her absolute FAVORITE spaghetti sauce now!

Delicious recipe. We like a "firmer" meatball, so I baked them and added them to the sauce just before serving. This will become a regular on our table.

The sauce is easy to make and delicious. It is a nice simple blend of flavors that makes for an authentic italian meal. The meatballs do take some extra effort, but are definitely worth it.

I love homemade sauce.  I skipped the meatball and just cooked 1 lb. of ground round and 1 lb. of italian sausage.  Made the sauce but I doubled it.  Wanted left-overs.  I also used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 cans of tomatoe sauce. Also add fresh oregeno.  Through it in the slow cooker all day and it was great!! Everone loved it.  Thanks!

I made the meatballs (used a different sauce) because they got so many good reviews.  They were easy, which I liked.  I baked them first to drain off some fat.  My family all agreed they were just okay, so I won't make them again.

We thought this recipe was great! It would make a really good meatball sub. I did brown the meatballs first before adding to the sauce. If I were making subs then I would leave it alone but if I were using for spaghetti then I would probably double the sauce recipe. Thanks!

The sauce was way too thick and kind of "tart" tasting.  The meatballs were very good though.  I don't think I will be adding this to my recipe collection.

I could only give this a 3 star rating because I just wasn't very impressed. I wont make it again. I am not sure why the recipe said to use whole tomatoes. I followed the directions thinking they would cook down, but they stayed whole throughout the cooking process. Why would I want lots of whole tomatoes in spaghetti sauce?  And the meatballs just werent very good.

Fantastic sauce and meatballs!  This smelled great while simmering, and the meatballs were juicy and delicious.  No need to brown them before adding to  the sauce.  I added fresh basil at the end.  I wanted to have some leftovers to freeze, but there was nothing left at the end of the meal--everyone loved it.  Will make this again!

This was very good.  I only made the meatballs (and not the sauce) because I did not have much time.  I had never made italian meatballs before, but this was an easy recipe.  I tripled the recipe and used italian seasoning instead of the parsley.  This was very tasty and my kids (and husband) liked them very much!  There was plenty for leftovers.  I will make these again.

I really enjoy the sause part of this recipe. I also enjoy the "meat"balls, however, instead of using beef, I use turkey. I also cook the turkey balls prior to putting in the sause. I'm not a big fan of left overs, but this one I really like. I've made a few times, and my family loves it. It's a keeper.

I thought the flavor of this dish was perfect. The only complaint was that the meatballs seemed a bit mushy. Maybe more bread crumbs needed? Something? Figure it out and you will have a fantastic dish!

This recipe turned out great! I put it in the crockpot overnight and it turned into a wonderful thick sauce. I added a few seasonings to suit our tastes. I also browned the meatballs before adding them.

I tried this night, it was outstanding!  I didn't have any tomato paste in the house and the sauce was still great.  The meatballs were cooked through and were very tender.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I thought this was very good, although I did make a few changes.  I took ANDREA-LEE's suggestion to use the wheat germ (thanks, btw!) and I also added some milk to the meatballs to help keep them moist.  After forming the balls, I lightly browned them in some olive oil before adding them to the sauce.
I also omitted the sugar from my sauce -- never understood adding that.  Yuck!

But, overall it was a great meal.  We served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta for an even healthier meal.  :-)

Pleasantly surprised! Never cooked meatballs in the sauce before. I added ground pork along with the ground beef. I also added green peppers, and celery, for a little texture. Meatballs were not dry at all. This one is a keeper! Thanks.

Loved this!  Very tasty traditional tomato sauce.  Nothing fancy at all but it is just what you want for a classic Italian taste...tomatoey, cheesy and not too much else.  The meatballs pick up tons of flavour from the sauce.  Had some pockets of breadcumbs in the cooked balls, need to mix a lot to avoid that.  Very good texture though, and nice flavour both meatballs and sauce.  Followed recipe exactly.  Made maybe 14 meatballs, 12 would be BIG meatballs.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  In the past I have always browned my meatballs and didn't realize they could just be thrown in with the sauce.  They tasted just as good, and it was much easier.  I also like the sauce recipe, although I wasn't able to let it simmer for the full amount of time.  I thought it would be a disaster, but it still turned out great. :)

Excellent sauce recipe...I have sworn off jarred sauce forever!!  I made this ahead and it froze very well.  It thawed in the fridge while I was at work and I heated it while the pasta was boiling.  I also make my meatballs ahead and freeze them.  I cook them under the broiler in the oven and then put them in a freezer bag.  I can use as few or as many as I need.

What a great recipe!  I broke up the whole tomatoes periodically when I stirred the sauce, so it would not be too chunky.  Also, I browned the meatballs before adding them for that last half hour.  It turned out perfectly!

This recipe is great, and it is now my permanent recipe for spaghetti sauce and meatballs.  I added two tbs. of milk to the meatballs, which made them a little moister but firm.

This is wonderful! DH said the sauce was even better than his! The only change I made to the meatballs is I added a large spoonful of the spaghetti sauce to the mixture. They came out nice and moist. Great recipe! Thanks Jeremy!

This is the best spaghetti sauce ever!  I will never buy (unless I absolutely have to) another jar of spaghetti sauce again!  The sauce is very tasty and has just the right seasoning.  Very easy to make.

Jeremy, this is excellent.  I didn't make the meatballs, because we don't eat meat that much, but the sauce is excellent.  I tripled the amounts to freeze some for later.  It freezes well, and next time My spaghetti wasn't time consuming at all.  My son hates everything, tomatoes, onions etc..He ate this and had seconds. He asked me to give you 10 stars, so here goes!  **********.  Thanks.

This went over great with my fiance, 5 year old, and the guest we had over(only made the sauce).  I did not care for it.  I do tend to be picky, and this was just too chunky for me.  Also, it seemed rather thin, didn't stick to the noodles all that well.  I might try this again, maybe just using tomato sauce instead of whole peeled tomatoes, but I worry that will make the sauce even thinner.

I used ground turkey.  We nice sauce that is not overpowering in it's flavor.  Freezes and reheats well.  Tasted good on french bread.  I'll probably make this again.

I was surprised at how light and yummy the sauce was. It was almost as if I had used fresh tomatoes. I used basil and oregano instead of dried parsley in the meatballs and diced tomatoes instead of whole. I will definitely keep this as an easy weeknight sauce.

Tomatoes did not break down to become smooth.  Sauce was too chunky.  Maybe I'll try using diced tomatoes rather than whole tomatoes next time...

I only used the meatball part of this recipe. My son wanted homemade meatballs and spaghetti for his 5th birthday. These were a huge hit! I cooked them in the microwave before adding to my own homemade sauce. This one is a keeper!

This was my first time making sauce, and it was delicious. However, it got quite thick and chunky by the time I needed to add the meatballs, so I added some water and some tomato sauce. Excellent recipe! Thanks, Jeremy!!

The sauce was okay, the meatballs in my family's opinion was not great at all, way too dry.I followed the directions completely.  Asked hubby to try the recipe again and he declined.

this was ok I know this was supposed to taste like marinara but i didn't relize how strong the taste was and I didn't like the texture of the meatballs I probably won't add cheese the next time although my husband liked it and cleared his plate so this is just my opinon don't take my word for it you have to try it you might like it.

this tasted great...but there are quicker marinara sauces that taste just as good.  if you have plenty of time, go for it because the taste is wonderful.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice... the first time, I thought the sauce was a little thin and I could have used more of it, so the second time I cut down on the olive oil, added more tomato paste, and made a batch and a half.  Delicious!  Also, I made the meatballs smaller than called for (I'm not sure they would cook in 30 minutes if bigger), divided them into single-serving sizes with sauce, and froze them.  They were even more delicious a month later than they were the frist night, and so easy to just defrost in the microwave after work.

OMIGOSH!!  This is the BEST sauce I've ever tasted. There will be no more store-bought sauce for me again!!

I love the ease of this recipe, plus the fact that it simmers for a long time---that hmust be the key to its wonderful flavor. My grandkids are nuts for it and it's become a "Saturday night special" for us. Thank you Jeremy for sharing this recipe.

Since I was in a hurry, I only made the meatballs.  I also hurried this recipe along by putting the meatballs in an iron skillet and baking them at 350 degrees while the spaghetti was cooking.  The meatballs were great and not too spicy for my 20 month old.

This is my first time making spaghetti & meat balls, and I found this recipie delicious. Used 1/4# turkey Italian sausage w/ 3/4# lean ground beef.  Think I'd cut down on the olive oil a little next time.

I prepared this recipe exactly as directed, but the meat was still raw inside.  I then cooked it for an hour longer on medium and the meatballs were still pink inside.  Of course, by this time we were starving so I took the meatballs out of the sauce and microwaved them.  If I fix this recipe again I'll start cooking it right after breakfast so that it may be done in time for dinner.
