I enjoyed this salad, but in moderation and when paired with the right food flavors.  I served this last night with some (spicy) blackened fish and the pairing was incredible!  I'll probably make something similar to this again, but maybe try out some sort of more mild flavored dressing--maybe just a splash each of oil, vinegar, and lime. The vegetables in this dish stay crunchy and flavorful for at least a couple days, and even get more delicious as the different flavors sit together longer.  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

I love the idea of fresh anything and the jicima and mango sound so exotic.  I substituted red wine vinegar for raspberry and used a dash of dried mint instead of fresh :(.  Also, I happened to have agave syrup so I used abt. a tsp. of it instead of nectar. I couldn't wait 30 minutes and dove right in.  Unfortunately, this recipe fell flat for me.  I love all the ingredients but this combination needs a little somethin' somethin'.  I added a dash of cayenne and a few chopped green onions.  It was a little better.  Admittingly, I tried it an hour later after the dressing had time to work its magic and it did get better.  Ultimately though it still seems like it needs something to add pizzazz.  I don't use mangos or jicima a lot and don't have any good ideas for this one.

I LOVED this salad.  I served it with grilled chicken tandoori kabobs.  The mangos we got were nice and sweet, which makes a big difference.  I left out the carrots just because I don't like them, but we didn't reduce the amount of the other spices (zest, raspberry vinegar, etc.) that went in.  Also, we cut the ingredients cubed vs. julienne - just a different texture.  It did taste better the 2nd day - very refreshing because of the mint and crunchy jicama, sweet because of the mango and tangy because of the vinegar.

Perhaps adding some cilantro would give this salad a little punch.

The missing ingredient is SALT. Much better once I sprinkled it with salt.

This slaw turned out great. I couldn't find raspberry vinegar, so I used apple cider vin. I've already shared the recipe with several people!

Great recipe, but labor intensive. If you can get your family to pitch in, you can put it together fast! Delicious. I added cilantro. Everyone loved it.

I added about 1/2 tsp. of cumin and loved it.  I actually get hungry for this salad.  I don't have agave, so I just used Splenda.

Not much else to say other that this is just ok.  As the others said there is something missing but I don't know what it is.  Thanks for the recipe though!
