I've had many different type German potato salads, but I have never had one with fresh dill in it...but I liked it.  Hot/warm potatoes really soak up liquid quickly.  I had to add a considerable amount of additional broth and vinegar, so the potatoes were not dried out.  I asked my husband to taste after I'd finally mixed all up, and at that point, he said to add more vinegar.  When I next make this, I also think I would use bolder apple cider vinegar, maybe just a taste preference for us. And by means, do add the "optional" bacon, I think it's very important to the flavor of this dish.  Served this evening with good, old-fashioned grilled German bratwursts. Enjoyed, and i would make again.

I made this yesterday for a get together today with friends who are diary/egg free.  Based on the previous review, I was concerned w/it being to dry, so i increased the liquid ingredients.  I didn't need to; it would have been fine as written; I even ended up draining a bit of the liquid this morning.  I rinsed my potatoes with cold water to stop the cooking process, so perhaps this prevented a little of the soakage.  My fresh dill had gone bad, so I ended up subbing dried and it worked fine (though I'm sure fresh would be even better).  I think the optional bacon is a must.  I nuked it, crumbled it, and added it at service so it remained crispy.  THANKS, for the recipe!

As far as German Potato Salads go this one was a little on the bland side.  I think if I make this again I will double the dressing and use bacon grease instead of oil.  The flavor was good, just not enough.

I made this for a family event and got rave reviews!
Our event was outside and I was concerned about a creamy dressing spoiling without refrigeration...
I made mine without onions, but with plenty of onion powder and added some garlic powder as well.
I will definitely make this again!!

This was quite good, but just a little bland for my family.  Next time I'm going to add a bit more vinegar and substitute a wine vinegar for the white.

I made this for a family gathering last year and was asked to bring it again this year! Definitely a crowd pleaser; even for those who don't care for potato salad.

It was delicious, nice tangy flavor.  Next time I will cut back on the oil and vinegar.  Too much liquid.

We liked this.  The fresh dill is delicious in here.  I ended up with too much liquid, even though my potatoes were piping hot when the liquid was added.  Not a big deal, just wanted to note that.

Very good!  I substituted green onions since they are plentiful in my garden and used turkey bacon.  Have served warm and cold - good either way.
