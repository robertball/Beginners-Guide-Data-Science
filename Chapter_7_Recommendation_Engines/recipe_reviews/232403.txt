If you want to make someone very happy prepare this sandwich for them. Absolutely delicious. I used fresh bread from the bakery sliced not too thick and followed the recipe and directions exactly. I added the bacon along with the eggs at the end. You will see smiles when you serve this....

Wow - now this is a sandwich! And just as the submitter states it's a BLT on steroids! My husband loves anything with bacon so I had to make this for him and I'm glad I did. It's rich meaty and absolutely delicious. While it's not something you'd make everyday unless you're looking to clog your arteries it's nice to splurge once in a while. I added the bacon at the end and served this with a bunch of napkins... Thanks for a great recipe Hot Grandma!

I am the submitter of this recipe. My first recipe submitted & was approved the next day so didn't have time to make corrections. I didn't mean to spread bread with the bacon grease but with the fond or fuzzy drippings which I would pat dry. Save the bacon grease to later fry eggs or potatoes. And yes pull the grilled part of the sandwich apart between the ham slices to add the lettuce tomato fried eggs AND the bacon. Hope you all enjoy!

This sandwich is decadent and delicious! I didn't have the bread specified and that was my only regret b/c it didn't come out as crisp as I would've liked. I kept reading the recipe but I didn't see where you add the actual bacon to the sandwich so I just added it at the end w/ the lettuce tomato and egg. The flavor combination is great and the little guy absolutely LOVED it! I will def be making this again (with the right kind of bread lol)! Thanks for sharing.:)

I do love this sandwich but how can you stop there? Add some avocado for extra extra fat! Personally I take out the onion too so it's more of a Blatche.

Oh it was AMAZING but I like my sandwiches to not require quite so much effort. It was a ton of work for a sandwich. No doubt about it it was still good but the name is fitting. We both felt like we were going to go into cardiac arrest after dinner. So good and if it were in a restaurant so I didn't have to prepare it and clean up after I would order it every time.:)

Wow the flavors together are awesome! Really great! I never knew green onion and Havarti could taste so yummy. I used Brownberry Country Buttermilk bread.

Made as written except that I only had plain white bread and I also chose to only butter one side of the bread and leave the bacon grease out of it. LOVED the flavor the green onions made melted with the cheese. The one problem I did have was getting my cheese to melt but that might have been fault to my cheap bread which browned so quick. This is one you wouldn't want to eat on a weekly basis but it sure makes for a nice treat once in awhile.
