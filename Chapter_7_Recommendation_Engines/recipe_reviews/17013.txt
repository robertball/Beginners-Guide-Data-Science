This recipe is different and delicious. After reading the reviews stating the bread was a little dry and the PB flavor wasn't very pronounced, I made some modifications - with great results! Reduce the flour to 1 and 3/4 cups and increase the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. Cover the bread with foil after an hour or it will get very dark. I omitted the walnuts because I felt they would compete with the PB flavor and added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips which really pulled the flavors together beautifully. Raisins would be great too though. The bread requires at least 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake. This is very filling and delicious! Thanks!

I really enjoyed the muffins I made based on this recipe and other's reviews.  I used 3 bananas, 3/4 Cup chunky peanut butter, 1 3/4 Cups flour, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Then  I baked them as muffins for 25 minutes.  Everyone at work loved them.  :)  The remaining batter I did in a loaf pan - but it did take a long time to cook all the way through - but when it was done, it was tasty too.  :)  Give some variation of this recipe a try!

Please don't count this recipe out based on the comments from some reviewers:  This can be a 5 star recipe with a little tweaking, I promise!  Per the suggestion from some other reviewers, I used 3 large over-ripe bananas and increased my peanut butter to 3/4 cup.  I took the flour down to 1 3/4 cups, and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  My own little ideas were to add 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar to the white sugar (still keeping white sugar amount the same), and also adding 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to the butter mixture (without taking down the amount of butter).  I don't know if these changes are why my muffins are so much more moist than many reviewers said theirs were, but whatever I did worked!!!  I also added a teaspoon of imitation banana extract, as some people thought the peanut butter overpowered the banana flavor.  Also, I left out the walnuts, since I was making them for children and didn't know if they'd like the nuts.  I baked them as muffins for 25 minutes and they turned out absolutely perfect!!!  After doubling this recipe I ended up with exactly 41 large muffins, so not quite two dozen if the recipe had been made exactly as written (unless you wanted to make small muffins).  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, using the modifications I suggested.  Thanks!!!!!

First I have to say that this bread is delicious and I will be making it again. I used chuncky pnut butter also. The drawbacks are that it does brown way too fast(the foil remedy worked for that). I didn't bake it for as long as it said because when I checked it with a toothpick it came out clean and I was afraid of letting it get too dry. When it was cool and I cut it there was a big hole in the middle where it had undercooked. The problem is that if I had finished baking it the bread would have been dry. As it was, everything around the whole was baked perfectly.

Okay, so I had to tweak this recipe as I found I was short on ingredients.  I used only 3 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup chunky peanut butter, 1/2 cup peanuts (crush them before adding to batter) and added 2 cups All-Bran Cereal for fiber(soak w/ water for 5 minutes).  YUMMMMM!!  Oh, and I added 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to half the batter.  I made 24 muffins.  3 grams of fiber per muffin.  Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were a little lower in calories, but still very, very good.

I wasn't terribly thrilled by this bread. I made it with chocolate chips, and without. I also made a plain banana bread at the same time, and like it much better. Took well over 70 minutes to bake, and to be honest, wasn't really worth the wait.

I think the peanut butter flavor takes away from the banana bread.  I also think that the peanut butter leaves the bread very bland.  It seems as if it would add more flavor, but I think it takes away.

It had a good flavor, not too heavy on the peanut butter, but it came out dry and rubbery in texture.

it was tasty and easy to make - I made mini muffins along with the bread to send to my grandsons class. He came back with 3 and they were eaten before we went to bed.

i also used 1 3/4 cups flour (whole wheat) and added 3/4 cup PB. i used honey/brown rice syrup mixture (1 cup) instead of sugar and added an extra banana and 3-4 table spoons of ground flax and a cup or so of choclate chips. i baked it for 30 min and then covered it for 40 minutes. BEST BANANA BREAD EVER, even people who dont like banana bread liked this!

Made this into muffins, and to make it a bit healthier (to justify eating them for breakfast!), used 2/3 cup sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup ap flour, and 1 1/4 cups PB. Left out the walnuts 'cause I used crunchy PB. Pretty tasty.

This is a great recipe.  My kids gobbled it up!  I substituted half the butter w/unsweetened applesauce, decreased the flour to 1 3/4 cup and increased the p.butter to 3/4 cup.  I also used 4 small bananas and an 8X8 inch pan instead of a loaf pan.  It cooked in about 40 minutes, was very moist, not overcooked on the top or undercooked in the middle.  Next time I will use all applesauce (I'm sure there is enough fat in the pbutter for great texture) and substitute half the flour w/whole wheat.  I commonly use a 8X8 inch pan instead of loaf pans for quick breads and it works perfectly everytime and less baking time.  Thanks for a great reicpe.

I switch out the walnuts for mini chocolate chips.  Banana, Peanut Butter & Chocolate are an insane combo.  I make them as muffins and EVERYBODY loves them!

This was a sick recipe! (And by sick, I mean soooo good!) We have always but peanut butter on our Banana Bread, but never thought of saving ourselves the time and trouble of putting it IN the BREAD. My friend wants to rub it on his chest... that is gansta for "so tasty I don't know what to think."

I thought this recipe was very good, but definitely needed the chocolate chips.  The taste isn't that different from regular banana bread, but just a little heavier because of the peanut butter.  The tip about covering the bread with tinfoil because it browns quickly (before fully cooked) was invaluable!  thanks!

i brought this to work and it was gone in minutes! great snacking bread. i increased the PB to 3/4C and used 3 bananas per suggestions, which seemed to yield a great balance of peanut-to-banana flavor. i also added 1/2 bag of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips because i am a chocoholic. left out the walnuts. this is one for the recipe box!

This was good once you make the changes suggested by others: Increase peanut butter to 3/4 cups (even 1 cup), 3 bananas, 1 3/4 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 /2 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cups of mini chocolate chips.  Omit walnuts.  Yummy.

loved it!  My picky husband enjoyed it as well, and he doesn't even like peanut butter!  I read the reviews and made it using some of the modifications.. I added extra PB and excluded the walnuts.  It was delicious.  I even added chocolate chips!  :)

Absolutely outstanding!!!!  
I Adjusted the recipe by using:
2 over-ripened bananas
1/2 cup smooth Peanut Butter
1 3/4 cups of flour
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup of chocolate chips
and I omitted the nuts.

I also used convection bake and a rubbermaid microwave cookware bundt pan instead of a loaf pan. It was still necessary to cover the bread with aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes of convection baking to prevent overbrowning.
We served this ina bowl with bananas & fresh cream. AMAZING! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very yummy, I made some alterations after reading alot of the comments, I reduced the flour to 1 and 3/4 cups and increased peanut butter to 3/4 cup and also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I also covered the bread with foil after the first hour of baking and it turned out perfect.  I didnt find it undercooked at all in the center.  I would make again!

Great recipe, I just made a few changes... omitted the walnuts, too much flavor competion for me personally. I reduced the flour by about a 1/4 c, added a tsp. of vanilla, just a bit more peanut butter and they came out perfect. I should also mention I made muffins and cooked them for 25 minutes.

Tried this for Thanksgiving as a change to the normal banana nut bread. My parents, husband and son all loved it.

I wish I'd just made the plain old banana loaf.  Tastes like something you'd buy at the Walmart bakery.  Kids liked it.  Which says a lot.  Sorry but this just wasn't good at all.

I love peanut butter and banana sandwiches so I had to try this recipe. It is a simple recipe I had to bake it for another 5 minutes for it to finish. The taste is amazing. Will be baking this again for sure!

This is a delicious recipe!!  I took some of the suggestions from other users on here and  made a couple changes as well.  I did 1 3/4 cups of flour, I used 2 and 1/2 bananas and instead of walnuts I added Skor bits.  Gave the same little crunch that a nut would, but adds an extra layer of flavour to an already awesome recipe!  Another thought... if u don't want to compete with the peanut butter/banana flavour in the bread, why not substitute crushed peanuts for the walnuts?!!:)

I used a 9 x 13 dark metal pan since I doubled this recipe.   I also substituted the walnutes with an extra 2 bananas, which I think ended up slightly overpowering the peanut butter. I added a splash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the mashed bananas as I would for any banana bread, and I added a tsp of vanilla for extra flavour and moisture. Regardless, it turned out perfectly - not too dense, and very moist. We ate the whole pan in 2 days - delicious!

This is one of the best recipes that I have tried. Like all other reviews if you tweak this recipe a little to suit your own tastes. I increased the pbutter to 1 full cup and I also used 4 bananas as well.......Instead of making the recipe into bread I made muffins out of the batter......I used the same temperature but only baked them approximately 25 minutes....Depending on how hot your oven is...They were moist and had a great banana taste with just a hint of peanut butter........This is now one of my most used recipes when using bananas........My family never gets tired of them.............

LOVED this recipe! I did make a few modifications upon other reviews. I used only 1 3/4 cups flour, used half butter and half homemade applesauce (to cut the fat), used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added in about 1/4 cup sour cream to add some moisture and rich flavor. I made these into muffins, omitted the walnuts, but put 2 whole almonds in each muffin for a healthy "surprise." I will definitely be making these again! Great baseline recipe, definitely requires a few changes though!

I made this on a snow day with hot chocolate, and it was so good!I made it with the changes everyone reccomends- 1 cup of peanut butter, semi sweet choco chip, more bananas, less flour ..etc. Plus I made it into muffins. It had a great banana peanut butter flavor and great texture. I propose someone posts this recipe with the changes-they make a big difference!

How does Bananas, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chips sound?  The changes I made were: 4 overripe bananas, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda AND the best part, rather than walnuts (which I didn't thnk went well with the peanut butter), I added 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips. Instead of a loaf of bread, I made 12 large muffins and baked them for about 25 minutes.  I can hardly wait for the muffins to cool down so I can try one.  This will definitely be a recipe I make again...of course, omitting the walnuts and adding the chocolate chips!

This is a nice hearty bread! I used all whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and omitted the nuts.  I baked in a square cake pan and it was done in 30 minutes!  Thanks - will be great with coffee for breakfast tomorrow!!!

These were a nice change from regular banana bread. I made them lower in fat and sugar by making the following substitutions: 1/2 cup low fat pb, 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, 1 1/2 wheat flour, 1/4 milled flax seed, and omitted walnuts. oh, replaced butter with 1/2 sugar free applesauce. I made 12 muffins and they were done in 30 min. Delicious and guilt-free!

I also followed the muffin recipe - I added a few spoonfuls of more flour to offset the extra banana I threw in, still delish! I didn't even mash up the bananas that well to get more of a fruit chunk and love it! Great recipe, will be making again! And easy from scratch too!

This was ok. I love peanut butter on bananas and I love banana bread, so I thought I would love this. I didn't. Might not be recipe, maybe it is just me. But my family didn't rave either, and so doesn't quite get 5 stars. And I still have most of a loaf a whole day later; a rarity in my house if the recipe is good. Thank you anyways. :)

This is an awesome recipe. I did follow the suggestions of others with increasing the peanut butter amount to 1 cup. Also have made when I had more bananas to use up and it still turned out awesome. I've made this into a loaf, muffins and also into a 9x13 cake and all worked out great.

While my family liked this...I'm so so with it. I totally loved the batter...doesn't everyone. Any how...after baking, I didn't prefer this very well as a bread loaf. It was to dense for me and wasn't gooey like I thought it would be. And to me, it only had slight hints of peanut butter and banana. I made 3 batches as a bread loaf. But weird as it was, I made one batch of muffins out of this recipe, it didn't take long to bake about 1/2 the time and I topped them off with walnuts. I totally preferred the moisture and texture better as a muffin then the bread it's self. Weird I say. But maybe there is some logic to it. Maybe I'll try this again and add extra peanut butter.

Super easy, super good!!! I followed others' suggestion and went with 3/4 cup peanut butter and less flour. I added choc chips and shredded coconut too. I had two fresh bananas, so I zapped those in the microwave for 2 minutes to make them easier to mash. I used muffin tins so only cooked for about 25-30 minutes. I also sprinkled pumpkin seeds on top prior to baking - they worked REALLY well as far as flavor. I shared these with all my neighbors and they've all asked for more!

This recipe is excellent. I used 1 C peanut butter and 3 bananas. Also, I used 1 3/4 flour instead. I made this in my little mini muffin pan and it made approx. 75 mini muffins. I added 1/2 C walnuts and 1/2 C choc. chips too. The mini muffins baked for approx. 15 minutes.

This was perfect and exactly what I was looking for as far as taste.  It was also moist and not to dry.  I only used 1 banana, and did not use 1/2 cup walnuts.  I made exactly 12 muffins instead of bread.  Yummy, thanks for sharing.

Very moist and great with some crunchy peanut butter spread on before you eat it!  I also decreased flour to 1 3/4 cup, increased peanut butter to 3/4 cup, and used 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Baked for 70 minutes and it came out perfect.  Covered w/foil after 50 minutes to prevent burning.

These just came out of the oven and are wonderful. I made 24 muffins instead of bread and baked at 350 for 22 minutes. Nice, not too brown or dry! I did use 5 very ripe small bananas for this recipe. MMMM

Huge hit with the kids and the hubby!! It was really easy to put together. I took the advice some of the other viewers and only put 1 and 3/4 cup of flour and increased the peanut butter  to 3/4 cups but i still did not find it had that much of a peanut butter taste. I also did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar . I will increase the peanut butter to 1 cup and maybe extra banana's . It did not last very long....

This was super super yummy! I made mini loaves and they were super moist! Cook time was reduced and that was another bonus. I didn't have to wait long! I thought the peanut butter and banana was the perfect compliment to eachother.

I doubled this recipe to fit in a rectangle pan, increased the peanut butter by 1/2 cup, decreased the flour by 1/2 cup & it came out great! Delicious!

This bread is DELICIOUS! I used applesauce instead of the butter, and 2 tbsp. plain yogurt instead of eggs. I also omitted the walnuts and the sugar all together, and used crunchy peanut butter. It was absolutely delicious! Would undoubtedly be awesome with chocolate chips, as others have suggested, as well. Mmmm.

Either my wife or myself printed out this recipe months ago and never payed much attention to it. I used it as a bookmark in another recipe book.  I happened to pull out the sheet and left it on the counter.  My wife thought I wanted her to make the recipe.

Well, she made it and the family is sorry we waited so long to try this.  It is an amazing recipe. Perfect blend of banana and peanut butter.

We did use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" in place of butter and we used Maranatha Organic Peanut Butter which does not have any sugar added.

Next time we will experiment using 1/2 cup Splenda for 1/2 the sugar.  We may also try to use 1/2 white whole wheat flour as well to see  if we can add a bit more fiber and possibly make this a "bit" healthier.

Even my husband, who is not a big fan of quick breads, said this was delicious!  I altered it with a few suggestions from other reviews:  1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown, 3/4 c. PB, 3 bananas, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 c. flour, 3/4 c. whole wheat flour.  This is definitely a new favorite!

Such great flavor!! I read all the reviews & made following adjustments...3 very ripe bananas; 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter (left out the walnuts--had it been smooth would have left in walnuts); 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour; and added 1/8 tsp. salt; all other ingredients as is.  Covered with aluminum foil after baking for 30-40 mins to keep from getting too brown for rest of bake time.  Just soooooo yummy!

Yummy stuff! I made the following substitutions: 1/2c unsweetened applesauce instead of butter; 1c Splenda instead of sugar; wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I also used 3/4c peanut butter and 1-3/4 cups flour, as recommended by other reviewers. Also added a couple handfuls of chocolate chips, and made muffins (6 large, cooked appx. 30 mins) instead of bread. Hmm...I'm not sure that this even qualifies as the same recipe, but I used this one as the starting point, and even with some tweaking it was still yummy!

I used chocolate chips instead of the walnuts.  It tasted good, but there wasn't much peanut butter flavor.  Adding more peanut butter or crushed peanuts to the batter might have helped.

The combination of the peanut butter and the banana is exceptional.  
I even added some dark chocolate squares (chopped) to the batter, which makes 
the bread even more wonderful!!

Just made this and it turned out wonderful! I love peanut butter cookies and banana bread.  Now I can have both at once.

We didn't have any walnuts (or any nuts) available, so I used chunky peanut butter in place.  Still came out great.

We love that it's not super sweet or super heavy.  Now that we followed the recipe (as best we could), next time we are going to try a few tweaks (i.e. a bit of cinnamon, a little vanilla).  The original recipe is still very good though.  Thanks!!!

Used less flour, More pb and bananna..Lotsa M&M's instead of walnuts. The loaf did  not set well for me. Turned into a crumbly mess.. but a moist, delicious, crumbly mess :)  served atop scoops of french vanilla bean ice cream ~ Pure yum!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because my bananas were super dupe ripe, used almond butter instead of peanut butter, and chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Perfect! The only thing missing that I forgot to add was a little vanilla. It's still amazing, and isn't too sweet for breakfast!

A friend of mine made this recently for him, my hubby and me. We all found it to be very yummy even though you couldn't taste too much of the peanut butter. He did however put some extra chopped walnuts in it. Turned out great and I am sure one of us will make it again sometime as my friend loves bananas.

Yummy!!!  I used 4 large bananas instead of 2 (i learned that the this helps the moistness issue tremendously), 3/4cup chunky peanut butter (just what i always prefer when it comes to PB), and 1 3/4cup of flour.  I also used a little less butter (7/8 stick) and it didn't seem to affect the texture or the flavor so much, so maybe i'll try 3/4 stick next time.  Throw in 1/2cup of chocolate chips and it was a crowd pleaser!!  I baked it on the top rack for 1.5 hrs. and it came out nice and moist, with just enough crust crunchiness.

I took the batter and piped it into muffin tins, then sprinkled mini-semi-sweet-chocolate-chip-morsels on the top of each muffin! (Because I forgot to mix them in the bowl at the end.) It worked just fine for the first dozen. There was batter for 7 more. I piped a layer of batter, at the bottom of the tin, then poured on a layer of mini-chips and piped a layer of batter to cover them up. They only baked for about 20 minutes when the tooth pick came out clean! :) I tried one straight out of the oven. So Very Tasty! :) Yummy!

I cut the flour down like others had suggested, added about 1 cup of chocolate chips, and did 1/2 cup margarine & 1/2 cup applesauce.  It was delicious!  Plus, 62 minutes of cook time for a loaf was enough.

This is a delicious and very forgiving recipe. After reading the reviews, I also cut the flour to 1 3/4 cups and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. I didn't have butter, so I substituted unsweetened applesauce, and omitted the nuts (didn't have any). I made a dozen good-sized muffins and one small loaf, baked for 27 minutes. These came out moist and tasting exactly like a peanut butter and banana sandwich!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I also read reviews and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and decreased the flour to 1 and 3/4 cups.  I also covered it after half an hour to keep it from browning too much and omitted the nuts.  It comes out well but does not taste very strongly of either peanut butter or banana.  So tasty but not awesome.

One of my Allrecipe fav's!  I did add chocolate chips as well as used half butter and half applesauce to make it a little more moist.

Will probably add more bananas and peanut butter next time for stronger flavors.

I made mini muffins from this recipe. I reduced the heat to 350 and it only took 13 minutes/batch.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use 4 bananas since the ones I had were very small.  I ended up with 4 1/2 dozen mini muffins.  These are perfect for my 14 month old to hold.  The peanut butter did overshadow the bananas a bit.  They were good, but I still prefer my traditional banana nut bread.

My family really enjoyed this so much, I just added an extra banana and a cap full of vanilla.  It was really moist and delicious.  I will be making it again.

Nice taste - I made 2 changes -- used 1 3/4 cups flour as others suggested and used chunky pb.  I only had to bake mine for 75 minutes.  Hubby loved it and he isn't a fan of peanut butter.  I ended up using 4 1/2 bananas.  Will make again!

My husband made this a couple of days ago and it turned out really good. He's not an expert in the kitchen but he said it was an easy recipe. He used chocolate chips instead of walnuts.

YUMMY! I followed the suggestions posted by Tina M., and also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Using an 8X8 pan is a great idea, though mine still didn't bake too evenly since I used my toaster oven. I also omitted the walnuts since I didn't have any & used crunchy peanut butter. I will definitely be making this again.

This s a great recipe, especially when you follow a combination of the reviews i.e  1 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup pb, 3 bananas, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 cup chocolate chips.  Couldn't keep these in the house, everybody loved them.

I was looking for a recipe to customize.  This one  tolerated my tinkering beautifully.  The results, a very pretty medium brown loaf filled the kitchen with an elusive blend of banana and p.b. smells.  The first slice was not too crusty (can be a problem with freshly baked quick bread), finely crumbed, moist not not at all too sweet.  My modifications were, 1/4 c butter, 2/3 c honey instead of white sugar, 2/3 c super chunk p.b., 1/2 c roasted peanuts, cinnamon & vanilla extract 1/2 t ea.  All processed in food processor.  A great recipe!  Wonder if I could substutute applesauce for banana?

This is the BEST banana bread recipe out there, especially if you love peanut butter. I doubled the recipe and made four mini loaves (they freeze great). For the double recipe, I used 6 large very ripe bananas and 1 and 1/4 cups chunky peanut butter. Since I used the chunky peanut butter, I omitted the walnuts but added 2 t. vanilla. In our oven at least the 70-minute baking time is way too long. I baked two mini loaf pans at a time for 45 minutes, and they were perfect - I covered with foil the last ten minute so the top wouldn't get too brown. The bread turned out fabulous - very moist. I also added chocolate chips to two of the loaves -devine!

I tried this & made it for my job. I used 1 cup extra crunchy PB  1 t vanailla & omitted walnuts. Added a little extra flour toward the end so it wasn't so sticky, and baked & baked and baked. Everyone like it, even more the next day after it cools & meld flavours together.

WOW! I just tried this recipe today for the first time, and it far exceeded my expectations! Like others, I made modifications based on my own likings and my desire to make it a little more healthy, plus to add things I had in the house. I also decided to make them in muffin form with the following substitutions: 1/2 cup low fat crunchy peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and I omitted walnuts since I had crunchy peanut butter. I also replaced half the butter with 1/4 cup of applesauce. I made 12 muffins and they were perfect in 30 minutes. I have eaten 2 already, one warm out of the oven and one cooled. Yum!

I'm not sure what to make of this recipe.  I used a combination of natural peanut butter and almond butter (I only had a little bit of each left in the jars).  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This slightly sweet bread has the texture of banana bread, but it seems that neither the banana nor nutty flavors came through.  I may try this again except with some tweaking...maybe adding more banana would help?


UPDATE: So I tried this recipe again only using 1 3/4 c flour and 1 cup crunchy peanut butter and a dash of cinnamon.  The cinnamon enhanced what little banana flavor there was.  I also made sure there were some chunks of banana.  Still not as banana-y or peanut-y.

This was great.  Not over powering with peanut butter.  I omitted the nuts and added chocolate chips.  I had made 4 different kinds of banana bread one afternoon (all 1st time recipes) and this one was ranked #1 by everyone in the family.

Overall good, but I didn't like it so much right out of the oven. After it was refrigerated for a few hours, it tasted much better.

This bread cooked very well, but the taste was mediocre - nothing special. I had leftover bananas and had all the other ingredients to make this, so I did. I did like it enough to want to make it again.

I read all the reviews, and made the following changes: 3/4 cup peanut butter, 1 & 3/4 cups flour, 2 tsp vanilla, 3 bananas, 1/2 cup no sugar added applesauce and 3 TBS of brown sugar (in addition to the 1 cup of white sugar. My oven is off so it actually baked at somewhere between 300 and 325 for 80 minutes. It made 2 4 x 8 loaf pans. I covered the loaf pans with foil about 50 minutes into the baking. It came out VERY moist with a strong Peanut Butter flavor. I can also taste the banana - but more as an underlying flavor. I will either cut the PB back to the original 1/2 cup or add a tsp of banana extract when I make this again.

I've had this recipe in my queue for a while and never had a chance to make it.  Well, over the weekend I had some bananas that were a little too ripe for my liking so I decided to give this bread a try.  I read a lot of the comments and tweaked the recipe accordingly.  I used three bananas, 1-3/4c of AP flour, 3/4c of low fat smooth peanut butter, and in lieu of the walnuts, I used about 1/2c of chocolate chips.  This baked up to be a really nice size bread, rose beautifully, and was nice and moist.  My only issues were that I could not really taste much peanut butter (I'm not sure if it was the type of peanut butter I used, or something else) and the cooking time (for my oven at least) needed to be adjusted.  I baked this in a glass bread pan on 325 in an electric oven for 70min, as suggested, however at that time the middle was still raw-ish.  After 20 more minutes at that temp, and cooling on the counter, it was finally at the perfect/set consistency in the middle.  Because of the longer baking time the bread browned a little more on the outside than I would have liked, but it was not burnt and still very tasty.  If I make this again I think I'll try using chunky peanut butter as some others mentioned, or even a handful of peanut butter morsels, just to bring out the peanut buttery flavor a little more.  All-in-all a nice, tasty banana treat! :)

I didn't even read reviews before making this, I just changed it up a bit. I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, crunchy peanut butter, 1 1/2 cups of bananas, and some vanilla. I also used only 2 tbs of butter and 2 tbs applesauce. I put it in a 13x9 cake pan and baked for 35 minutes. It came out extremely moist and delicious! Much better than other peanut butter breads I've baked before. I will definitely make again!!!

Loved it! I had to alter my recipe because I only had 1 cup of flour and I was doubling the recipe to make 2 loaves so I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and you would have never known it. It is delicious. My son couldn't tell it was healthy!

i used 3/4 c. of PB and i still could hardly taste the peanut butter. also the banana flavor wasnt as strong and flavorful as i like. this recipe was ok but i wont be making it again, its not worth the effort and bananas. youd be better off making just plain banana bread

I just made muffins using this recipe with the changes suggested by Spongebob7, and they are amazing! I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top before baking and loved the added texture and flavor. The muffins are super moist and made my whole house smell delicious. They only took about 40-50 mins to bake.

Very good recipe.  I made large muffins - this recipe made 6 large muffins.  I followed others' suggestions and increased the pb to 3/4 cup and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup.  I used 1 cup white flour and 3/4 cup ww flour.  Turned out great! I also added choc chips.  Would make again.

I agree with other posters that the bread was a little dry.  A friend who bakes a lot suggested adding pudding mix to the batter next time. The taste was wonderful though, my husband even had me bake another loaf for him to take to work to share.

Very yummy banana peanut butter bread - I used crunchy peanut butter and added chopped walnuts. Baked them into muffins topped off with a few chocolate chips! My boyfriend loved them for breakfast :)

This was really yummy. I used a few suggestions from other reviewers. For example, I added a banana so that you could taste the flavor and add to the moisture. I also left out the walnuts and added chocolate chips instead. I also line chocolate chips along the top of the bread just for visual attraction. Also, I divided the batter between 2 pans instead of one and still had very good sized loaves.  In doing that it only needed to cook for about an hour to be done.

I love this twist on banana bread. It is super yummy and moist. I had 3 over ripe bananas so I used all three and used a cup of natural PB. Definitely a keeper!!

I like this bread a lot..However, I only baked mine for 50 minutes. I guess the high altitude could have had something to do with that,though.

This recipe recieved mixed reviews at our house. I thought the flavor was confusing, not really banana and not really peanut butter. My husband, however thought it was great.

Great bread!  No  modifications except I took it out of the oven 20 minutes early and let it completely cool in the pan.  It's wonderful and the PB doesn't overwhelm you - it's just in the background.  Very good.

I seriously feel like a pro baker now!  This was so well-liked by everyone who tried it, which is awesome because I have never been known to bake well.  The mods I did to this were to use 3/4c pb, 1 3/4c flour, and 1/2c ButTeRsCoTcH cHipS! Mmmm, right!?  Oh, I also added a hand full of crushed pecans! So delish and like I said taken really well by everyone who had it!!

This bread will now be my number one banana bread! Came out perfect - dense, moist, flavorful. Two small changes - I didn't have enough walnuts to add to the batter, so I sprinkled walnut pieces on top before putting into the oven. Also, I sprinkled a little ground cinnamon on top half way thru cooking. No changes to the recipe needs to be made!  Thanks for the great recipe. Making another tonight to take to my coworkers tomorrow!

My 5 year old daughter and I just finished making these muffins and they are delicious (my daughters words exactly). We added chocolate chips to the top of the muffins and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 applesauce, and 4 over ripe bananas. They were easy to make and very moist. We will definitely make them again!!

I doubled this and used half white and half brown sugar, as I was running low on both. I also added a tbsp. of vanilla.
This batter was the fluffiest I'd ever seen in a banana bread. I covered the loaves halfway through to prevent scorching. These aren't for me, I'm baking these for friends. I'll update when I hear how they liked them.
UPDATE 11/16/08: YAY! It was a hit. Everyone raved about it. I think next time I might use a flavored peanut butter or stir a little jam into the peanut butter.

I used Mer in the Kitchen's recipe for muffins, and they turned out great.  I have made the original recipe before, but adding more peanut butter and banana brought out the flavors much more.

Made this recipe as cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes, omitting the nuts as my family doesn't like them.  Recipe was ok, but lacked something i can't get my finger on.  I ended up adding a glaze made with heated strawberry jam, powdered sugar, and a bit of water.  Don't think  I would make again.

The bread seemed to be a little dry compared to regular banana bread. I probably will not make this again, but our dogs seemed to enjoy it! They pulled it off the counter, ripped off the foil, and managed to eat most of the loaf.

I didn't like this bread the first day i made it because i found it had no flavour. Today however, i just ate two pieces and the flavour came through a lot more so i suggest making it a day in advance. I changed many things in this recipe to make it healthier with good results. I doubled the recipe and used half applesauce and half nonfat sour cream for the butter, only one cup of white sugar instead of two, 5 bananas, and whole wheat flour instead of white. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and a dash of salt. In one batch i mixed some chocolate chips and left the other one on its own. Both turned out good :) will make again with my modifications.

My problem is that there is not enof banana tast and that it does not cook prpberly. i baked it for 30 minites more than they asked and when i pocked it it came out clean. i Let it cool and was cutiing it when the inside was still goo. And the part that was done tasted like peanut butter and not like banana at all.

Followed the suggestions of upping PB (just under a cup), reducing flour (1 3/4 cup), 3 bananas, half white / half brown sugar, tsp vanilla and chocolate chips.  Made as muffins.  CHECK THEM EARLY!  I burned the hell outta the first 24 full size... As for the 15 mini muffins: I short cooked so they'd be slightly gooey (ten minutes) and they were PHENOMENAL that way!

Great recipe:) Even my picky kids love it:) I did make some changes; instead of nuts I added 1/4 cup choc chips, 1 tsp vanilla, a little extra peanut butter and it had to be baked for 1 hour and 25 min. Came out moist and YUMMY in the TUMMY to quote my kids:)Thanks this is oour new Banana Bread recipe:)

I am a huge peanut butter fan and also love bananas so I thought this would be a great way to use up some bananas. The flavor combination did not go well together. I followed several others advice ie: 1 c. peanu butter, 3/4 c. flour, 1 tsp vanilla. Instead of chocolate chips I added peanut butter chips. The end result was not good. I will stick with plain ol' banana bread in the future.

Tastes quite nice. I followed what the previous reviewer advised, and had extra Peanut Butter (3/4 cup) and less flour (1 3/4 cup) and it ended up nice, although it's still hard to taste the peanut butter so I'll probably add even more next time.

Great recipe. I made it in smaller bread pans and it only took about 50 minutes to cook. If you are a traditionalist when it comes to banana bread don't make this, it has an awesome peanut butter flavor for peanut butter lovers. Yummy good and the house smells wonderful!!

Wow!  I have made this about 30 times now. My toddler loves it, my neighbors love it, my friends love it.  I add 1/2 cup of choc. chips.  Also I substitute one cup flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. Tastes the same. Totally easy, somewhat healthy and yummy!

This is our families favorite banana bread.  Thanks for the great recipe.  We have made it many times and it doesn't last long around our house.

Not a bad recipe, but not my favorite either. I used 1 cup chunky peanut butter, 3 bananas, 1 tsp vanilla and no walnuts. I of course could taste the nuts from the peanut butter, but even adding twice as much as the recipe called for you could not actually taste the peanut butter at all. And it wasn't REAL banana-y even with the addition of an extra banana. I really prefer the chocolate chip banana bread recipe I use (I believe I found it on this site even). Good recipe, but probably won't make this one again.

I made these into 16 muffins. I skipped the walnuts, added extra banana and pb. i also added a cup of PB chips. They were so moist and tasty.  I would love to try them with some whole wheat flour. I will def be making these again

Excellent.  As suggested by previous reviewers I add vanilla, extra pb, and extra bananas.  Also usually bake as muffins, 20 - 25 minutes.  My kids love them, always a hit.

I thought this was a very good bread, but I did make modifications, based on suggestions from other reviewers.  I added a t. of vanilla and 1/2 C. of chocolate chips, after tossing them in the dry ingredients so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  I reduced the flour to 1 3/4 C. and increased the p.b. (chunky) to 3/4 C.  I also omitted the walnuts. I had foil on it for about the last 20 minutes of baking, and it was still plenty dark. Tasty and a nice variation on plain old banana bread!

This was a good recipe, but I had to add some ingredients.  I added an extra 1/4 c. of peanut butter, 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and an extra banana.  It came out great, but took a very long time to cook and came out a little crumbly.  Lastly, I used reduced fat chunky PB and surprisingly it still had great taste and was very moist!

I had leftover bananas and made this. It was so-so.  I only had reduced-fat peanut butter on hand so maybe that's why I didn't like it too much. It was kinda dry and not too flavorful.  I may make it again using normal peanut butter to see if it's any better.  It was so-so.

This wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I didn't think it had enough flavor. It was also a little to dense and dry for my taste. I won't be making this again.

I found this to be VERY good.  I liked the banana and peanut butter combo.  After about 30-40 minutes I had to cover it with foil--was browning to quickly.  I thought trying some chocolate chips would be a nice addition.

Made it this afternoon and it's yummy!!! I didn't use the peanut butter because I know a lot of people allergic to nuts and instead of baking soda I used powder; so moist and yummy!! I like that you can decrease the sugar if you don't like it too sweet. Will make it again!!

These were ok. I am not a big peanut butter fan but I do like peanut butter and bananas, so I thought these might be good. They were a little bland and a little overwheleming on the peanut butter (for me) They did not taste like banana bread to me, just like peanut butter cake muffins. Perhaps if the ratio of peanut butter to banana was different, they'd be ok. If you're looking for peanut butter these would not be bad for you at all. If you wanted banana bread with just a hint of peanut butter, you'll need to tinker with it quite a bit.

I made this exactly like the recipe suggested and I turned out beautifully. I used overly ripe bananas which mades the bread sweeter. I made this without a mixer because I didn't want to over mix the batter, which will make you bread dry. I added a peanut butter glaze to drizzle on top. Just mix together powdered sugar, peanut butter and a little bit of water.

I tried this recipe with some slight variations for my preschool children in Haiti and they LOVED it. I did slightly more than double the recipe and adjusted the butter and bananas based on what I had available. (less butter, more banana) I cut the sugar in half and actually used 1/2 raw cane sugar and 1/2 honey. I also added a cup of oats for some whole grains. They kids already asked me when I will make it for them again!

This bread is a unique twist to a traditional banana bread, but I wasn't crazy about it myself. I can't place my finger on what exactly I didn't like though. My husband really liked it  - but he'll eat anything that includes peanut butter.

I cooked 'em as muffins as reviewer AMY suggested and they came out perfect in 35 mins.  I do consider what reviewers suggest and boy did AMY (TY Amy) steer me in the right direction!!!!  Here are her suggestions so you don't have to look for her review:3 large over-ripe bananas, increase peanut butter to 3/4 cup, bring flour down to 1 3/4 cups, add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar to the white sugar (still keeping white sugar amount the same), also add 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to the butter mixture (without taking down the amount of butter).  I only had regular applesauce it worked just fine.

This was okay. It turned out a little dry and my family just didn't care for the peanut butter taste. We do love peanut butter, but we didn't like it in this bread. Usually banana bread is gone in 1 day in our house, but a 1/3 of this ended up sitting around for a week and was used for food for our chickens. I always like trying new recipes though and I thank you for sharing!

I took the most helpful person's review by cutting the flour down and adding more PB plus the foil for the last 20 mins so it didn't get overly dark. Turned out perfect BUT I think I may add banana extract next time to kick up the banana flavor...:)

Yummy!!!! I made a little change because when i looked in the fridge I only had one egg so I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and i also tossed in a dash of cinnamon and I put them in muffin tins instead of a loaf pan. But they turned out perfect light and moist and fluffy!!

I have made this recipe many times and must say, it is easy and extremely tasty if you like peanut butter and banana combo. If you are looking more toward banana bread, then this recipe isnt for you. I have also passed this recipe on to friends and family who also love it!

My family loved this bread. The baking time was 70 minutes,but I had to bake it 80 minutes. Next time I bake this I will add a little more peanut butter. Great bread!

Love this simple yet yummy recipe.  I made some changes too.  I followed previous suggestions on reducing the flour and increasing the PB.  I also converted the sugar to a mixture of Splenda and brown sugar Splenda (I ran out of brown sugar Splenda so I added reg. Splenda to equal 1 cup.)   It turned out really tastey and was not dry at all.  I didn't add the walnuts but will next time. This recipe is perfect is you don't have enough Bananas for a traditional banana bread recipe. The PB is a great substitute and you can hardly taste it.

I liked this bread with the changes I implemented.  Like others, I changed the flour/peanut butter ratio to 1 3/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup peanut butter.  I also changed the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added 1 more egg and added chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I made the batter into muffins (baking 25 minutes) and my kids gobbled these up.  I would definitely make these again...with my revisions.

I have no clue what is wrong with this recipe but I followed it to the letter and it literally exploded in oven so I now have a huge mess to clean and used the last of my ripened bananas on a recipe that did not work. I am not impressed and neither are my children

Okay.  I think next time I make this, I'll add more peanut butter.  The peanut butter taste wasn't as strong as I would have liked.

I intended to make this recipe as written, but after mixing, the batter was a little dry,so I added an extra banana. This seemed to do the trick the bread turned out neither dry or gummy in texture. My family preferred this warm or toasted, we weren't so keen on this cold. Thankyou Corwynne.

this was good but not great - I added some peanut butter chips to it which I think helped increase the PB flavor, but not quite enough for our liking. I'll make it again but trying adding other things to it still.

Wasn't too bad, I did really like the peanut butter addition.  However, it was a little on the dry side for my taste.  I'd make it again but cut back on the flour.

This bread came out a little dry for my liking, and did as the other reviews suggested take a long time to bake. My kids had some with butter spread on it and could not get enough. I also found that the peanut butter did not really seem to add much in terms of taste.

It's good, but not worth using the peanut butter for. I didn't have any trouble with it drying out as others have noted, but I did cover it with foil the entire baking time.

I thought it was good but I love peanut butter. Real moist. Followed it to a tee~even the time was right. Followed another advice to cover halfway with foil. My fiance didn't care for it but he hates peanut butter.

This recipe is absolutely beautiful. I doubled the recipe. I used a total of five bananas in the double recipe. I did add just a small palm full of the brown sugar. The loaves came out so perfect, I didnt want to cut them. But other wise stuck to the recipe. Oh, I did add vanilla. Just a cap full as well. Great recipe, the loaves come out beautiful.

You can definately tast the peanut butter.  I would recomend doubleing the amount of baking soda.  It doesn't raise enough.

As many of the reviews suggested, I increased the peanutbutter and decreased the flour.  I baked mine for 85 minutes and covered the loaf with foil after 45 minutes.  I added 1/2 c of chocolate chips and I wish I hadn't.  The peanutbutter and banana flavors are good.  The bread is very moist.  I gave it 4 stars for the cooking time - even after 85 minutes, I feel I could have left it in longer.

I found out that I didn't have Baking Soda. But I decided to go through with it anyway and it was still pretty good. Can't wait to try it with all the right ingredients.
I also didn't use the walnuts.

Not as awesome as i was hoping for... Almost bland, and I added an extra banana. No sweetness at all, and sort of a funny flavor.  We'll finish the loaf, but won't make again.

The bread was good but no one could even tell there was peanut butter in it. I also took it out of the oven 10 minutes early and it was still at little over cooked. Next time I would add more peanut butter, and check it after 50 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I and my whole family loved it!  It was very moist.  I don't usually even like banana bread that much, but I can't stop eating this stuff!  I will absolutely make it again!

This bread is great.  I think increasing the pb to 3/4 is too much. (after following some advice from other reviewers).  The extra pb makes it a bit too rich for me.  Anyway, overall a delicious bread I'd make again.  The modifications I made were: added 1 t vanilla, omitted walnuts, increased soda to 1-1/4 t, used 3 bananas, added chocolate chips and baked in a Bundt pan.  I ate all of this bread myself within a week and it's a big loaf!!!!!  Thank you Corwynn.

Good banana bread with a peanut twist, but not a show stopper.

I didn't add chopped walnuts.

I made this as muffins and made changes as suggested but they were still dry.  If I make them again I will only use 2 bananas and creamy peanut butter instead of chunky, my family doesn't like the peanuts, and I'll cook them for only 20 minutes.

Very tasty bread.  Neither the banana or the peanut butter has an overwhelming taste.  I like the texture.  I cooked it in a stone loaf pan and it was done perfectly in 60 minutes.  Will make again.

It took about 15-20 mins longer then it suggested because the center was still gooey. It is pretty good, it's a light taste of peanut butter which is nice so it doesn't over power the banana flavor. Not sure if I'll make it again though.

I wanted to make a healthy banana bread for my toddler, so I made a few substitutions, and it turned out awesome!
First I used 1 C flour, and 1 C wheat germ, and I sweetened it with about 1/3 C brown sugar and 1/4 C brown rice syrup, which also helped to make for a moist bread. 
I also upped the peanut butter, (I used natural p.b), to 3/4 C like other reviewers suggested.
Delicious!

I made this and my husband and daughter love it! We like the dryer type of texture because we eat it with coffee or tea. My husband isn't a huge fan of walnuts so instead of walnuts, I used crunchy peanut butter and the peanuts in the peanut butter added just the right crunch factor to it.
Thanks, I am making another loaf today, the family can't stop eating it. Also if you are health conscious you can add 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of splenda, and it works out to taste like 1 cup of sugar. You can also use light butter.

This tasted good, although the peanut butter flavor wasn't very strong.  I also had to cook it a lot longer than the time specified, and the edges of mine got burnt while the middle barely cooked.

Subbed 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup of the butter.  Subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar.  Used 3 bananas and 3/4 cup Smart Balance peanut butter.  Used 1 cup WW flour and 1 cup white flour.  Added choc chips instead of nuts.  Baked as muffins instead of as bread.  325 for 27 minutes.  Also had enough for a pan of mini muffins.  Good but I like the mocha chocolate chip banana muffins on this website even better.

Really good bread for all the right reasons - gave them to my son and teammates after sports practice, perfect "recovery" food.  Daughters like it toasted in a little butter in a frying pan for breakfast on cold mornings instead of regular toast ... can you blame them?  Will definitely make again!

This bread was pretty good.  Although i thought it would NEVER get done baking.  Very dense and moist.  Fall apart moist actually.  Good flavor.  I did as others recommended with more banana and more PB.  But after eating one small slice, it was enough.  Very filling.  Wouldnt be something i make all the time.

This was good.  I followed another review and only used 1 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Also used 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.   The bread had a mild peanut butter taste. I thought the chocolate chips were a good addition.  I baked for 78 minutes.  The bread was good and moist but the middle center caved in an inch and I don't know why as the bread was cooked through.  Will probably make again if I have the ingredients on hand.

I really wanted to try this but I only had 1 banana so I halved the recipe and made the batter into muffins. I omitted the walnuts just because I don't like them in my breads, and baked the muffins for 20 minutes. I ended up with 10 delicious, moist, flavorful and LIGHT textured muffins that were just GREAT by themselves or with a bit of strawberry jelly on them. SUPER.

This turned out good. My kids liked it. It could have used even more pnb then I used. I made changes 1 3/4C flour & 1 extra banana. Also added vanilla flavoring. Added 3/4C pnb (coulda used more.) Some  pnb and choc chips.

This was a little dry and you couldn't really taste the peanut butter.  I was disapointed.

My family loves this bread. I have used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I also added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. I make this bread a lot and its a terrific snack or dessert.

Pleasantly dense texture, moist, but not greasy.  Mild flavor.  All around, a great bread.  Heartier than regular banana bread.

What a great recipe!  I made it late last night, into muffins, so that our family would have a good breakfast in the morning.  It was a big hit!  As per another review, I only used 1 3/4 flour.  I used (3/4 cup) almond butter instead, and it smelled and tasted wonderful.  For the muffins, it only took about 35-40 minutes in the oven, and I covered it with foil after about 25 minutes.  I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, but will definetely add it next time.  That would make for a 5 star recipe for sure!

I just finished taste testing this and I have to say - YUM!  It was hard waiting so long for it to cook - it took me 80 minutes, plus time to cool, of course. I covered the bread after cooking 50 minutes and it came out perfect. I find the texture to be very good - not too dense as some say. The flavors meld very well. It's not too p-nutty or too banana-y, but definitely has flavor. I followed the recipe just like it says but omitted the walnuts. I'll try it with chunky p-nut butter next time. Thanks for a great alternative to plain banana bread.

I doubled the recipe and it was delicious! I left out the walnuts because my family doesn't "do nuts" however, I think adding some choc. chips would be a nice addition.

This turned out really good!
I used 1/2 cup apple-Raspberry sauce instead of the butter, added a little more chunky peanut butter, vanilla & cinnamon as well. Plus a few pecan pieces & a handful of chocolate chips.
This turned out very nice and moist, with a great taste that is definately different but very tasty.
Definately give it a go!

My husband and I loved it.  I put some mini chocolate chips in and left out the walnuts.  I made it very early in the morning and forgot the eggs!  It still came out very good.  I also used light margarine to cut down the fat.

Very simple, easy recipe to follow.  Children should enjoy making this bread if they want to get their feet wet in the kitchen, so to speak.  And the flavors are wonderful; you can taste both the peanut butter and the banana without either flavor battling the other.  That balance is hard to find!
However, I do think the bread is too dense.  The outer edges browned and lost moisture while the center was still cooking, and the resulting loaf was quite heavy.  An appropriate dessert, perhaps.  But this bread is not the best for breakfast.

The combination of banana and peanut butter was wonderful.  I used chunky peanut butter, plus some walnuts added.  Also, I made muffins instead of bread, so it would transport to the golf course better!  Everyone raved!!

Used many of the suggestions- decrease flour, increase banana and peanut butter, add vanilla and banana flavors. I made them into 24 muffins and they came out great in 23-24 minutes. Next time I will not add in the banana flavor since my kids prefer the strong peanut butter taste.

This is a good recipe, and I heeded some advice from the reviews and added my own tweaks.

I reduced the flour to 1 3/4 c and increased the peanut butter to a generous 3/4 c. I used super-chunky peanut butter and omitted the walnuts. I added 1/4 t. salt and a splash of vanilla. 

I used frozen bananas that I thawed then squished. I drained the liquid that came off them while thawing. I think I could have left some of it in. I considered taking that liquid and concentrating it by boiling it down to a syrupy consistency and adding it in, because I hated to throw that flavor down the sink, but I didn't have time. Maybe next time!

This was on the denser side - definitely not a light and fluffy cake-like bread - but not too dry with some modifications. With the ratio above, the peanut and banana flavors balanced each other well. It would also stand up to a smear of honey butter or thinned peanut butter.

with modifications, was delightful! 
3 bananas, 3/4 c crunchy PB, 1-3/4c flour, 2t vanilla, 1/2 c applesauce, 2T brown sugar, other ingredients as listed. Baked in greased muffins cups for 24 min (1 large scoop per cup)-made 21 muffins. Could try with nuts next time, left them out. Would be great with choc chips also.

This turned out really well. I changed a lot to make it more diet friendly, but everyone in my household enjoyed how it turned out.
 I substituted 1/4 cup of butter for 3/4 cup of flax seed. Because of this, I added about 1/4 cup of water. I used 1 cup almond flour to lighten the carb count, 1/2 cup of meal replacement powder to add nutrition, and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. Plus, my bananas were small so I used 3.
I used Truvia instead of sugar which ended up being about 5 Tbsp. This is more than the regular conversion due to me using sugar free peanut butter, which ended up being a heaping 1/2 cup.  Due to the excess ingredients, I increased the baking soda by about half a tsp. 
All in all, I changed a lot but the basic recipe remained.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and followed the recipe. It’s way too dry as is. I think next time I try this, I’m going to add another banana, less flour and/or some applesauce for moisture. It has potential but not to be made as written.

So, I hate when others review a recipe but comment that they've made changes to it before trying the original one, but I did the same thing for this recipe. Based on what others said, I reduced the flour, increased the peanut butter, and covered the bread with foil for the last 10 minutes. The bread came out delicious, although I could have increased the peanut butter from 3/4 of a cup to one cup because the peanut butter flavor was very subtle. I will make this again!

I usually have very good results with most recipes from this site. I followed the recipe exactly and this Peanut Butter Banana Bread was very bland, dry and hard like a brick. I should have read the comments (I normally do but I was in a hurry) and followed some of the tweaks. If you make this as the recipe states, this is not good at all. I’ve never given a bad rating before but the recipe as written is not one I would ever make again or recommend... it’s awful. Sorry.

Very quick and easy, liked that it didn't require many ingredients, although it could use something to make it more moist, and more tasty.

I gave this 5 stars yet Not sure about the original recipe. I had taken the advice of another reviewer. It stated to reduce the flour to 1 &3/4 cup and increase the peanut butter to 3/4cp. Well I did that but also added a scoop of vanilla yogurt. I made muffins and they came out supper moist and flavor full.

My husband loves this!  I made 3 loaves by doubling everything.  I used 4 cups baking mix instead of the flour and baking soda.  I also had a bag of Reese's peanut butter mini chips so I folded about a cup of those in with the walnuts.  Mine were perfect in 1 hour at 325.  This is a great recipe :). Thanks for sharing it!  We are a family of peanut butter lovers; I will never make traditional banana bread again!

I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I used  three brown  bananas and creamy peanut butter for this recipe. This recipe was Absolutely amazing but took an amazingly long time to cook actually I set it for an hour and a half and then let it sit in the oven overnight with the oven turned off amazing recipe I also added in some chocolate chips.

This recipe is very very easy, with ingredients that I have on  hand almost all the time.  I followed these directions exactly except I added about a quarter-teaspoon salt.  In the past I have added peanut butter to my banana bread, but this is the first time I had a recipe.  I only had extra crunchy peanut butter, but no walnuts, but I think  it worked out well.  I I cooked it not in a loaf pan, but in a 6x9 baking dish so it is more like a bar than regular bread.  We loved it and I will make it again.

I followed most of the suggestions and it was very moist and tasty.  I am a big fan of peanut butter and banana sandwiches but prefer a good banana bread loaf over this recipe.  I doubt that I will make it again unless my grandsons request it.

Good flavor and was moist. I used 3 bananas and cut out walnuts. Only cooked for 50 minutes at 325. Maybe next time increase peanut butter because I didn't taste much of it in the end result.

I really liked this bread but am only giving four stars because of the tweaks I made based on other reviews. I increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cup. I also added a splash of vanilla and omitted the walnuts and instead added dark chocolate chips. I made into 12 muffins and a small loaf. The muffins took about 25 minutes and the small loaf took about 35-40 minutes. Delicious! Will be making this again!

Loved this recipe.  No need to make drastic changes.   I used peanuts instead of walnuts, and three bananas instead of two.  Both flavors came through well.

My kids love this bread! I tweak it a little every time. I put a little less flour and a little more butter, I've added burbon, cocoa and cinnamon and it has worked well every time. I also like to toast some oats to put on top!

I went with amy's suggestions: 3/4 pb, less flour, applesauce, brown sugar. but I made a loaf and drizzled it with a brown sugar peanut butter glaze. it took 60 min, probably because I used a wider loaf pan. I used the foil too about halfway through. I didn't use any extract though, because I didn't have any, which would have probably made all the difference. still tastes great though!

I had a lot of bananas that were ripe so I made this today. I sprinkled crushed almonds on the top rather than mixing it into the bread. It's great but I agree it's a bit strange to have to cook it for so long, it got fairly dark. I'll try the reader suggestions next time!

This banana bread got lots of compliments! Other reviewers said that the bread was a bit dry, so I used 1 3/4 cups of flour and put in 2 tablespoons of vanilla yogurt.

I made this a *little* healthier by using applesauce instead of butter, wheat flour, all natural peanut butter, a little less sugar (plus some honey), and three egg whites rather than two eggs. It turned out phenomenal. I am seriously debating whether to give it away as I had planned or just eat the whole loaf for dinner and tell my friends I forgot to bake for the party... Decisions.

I made suggestions on adding a few things to this recipe, but my wife said this recipe was perfect. I did add an additional banana, since I had three ripe bananas and what are you going to do with one ripe banana if you don't have a monkey. The cooking time was 90 minutes and I did tent it to prevent over browning of the top. The internal temperature was 200 degrees. Perhaps the additional cooking time was the result of the additional banana. This is a keeper recipe.

I made this recipe into mini muffins and it was awesome. I used 3/4 Cup creamy PB and 1 3/4 Cup Flour, I also added 1 tsp vanilla as was suggested by others. 
I baked the muffins for 15 minutes at 325. My kids ate them up and I thought they were a great treat as well.

I also change the recipe slightly with successful results.  1 3/4cup Whole Wheat Flour 1/2cup Spelenda (instead of 1cup sugar) 3/4cup Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter 1 stick of 'Can't believe its not Butter' for baking (instead of real butter) I also added an extra banana and did away with adding more nuts because the peanut butter was crunchy.

I followed the advice of some of the other commenters and reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cups and I added rasins instead of walnuts.  I also used 3 bananas and a little more than a full cup of peanut butter.  The peanut butter flavor definitely overwhelms the banana. Next time I think I'll use 1 cup peanut butter and 4 bananas. The rasins were delicious though and it was so moist and perfect!

A very good, dense bread.  Smelled wonderful and tasted great, although I had to bake it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe said.

This turned out good. I used half butter, half oil and I also used half brown sugar for the sugar. It turned out very moist. You couldn't really taste the peanut butter and i even used more than directed. Also I omitted the walnuts and used chocolate chips instead.

I love the idea of PB and banana together; however, this bread was not as most and flavorful as others I've made. I did muffins instead of a loaf and while the batter smelled heavenly, the final product was a bit dry. Yet, I took others' advice to reduce the flour and increase the PB. Worth a try but I think I will stick to the "banana banana" bread and "banana sour cream" bread recipes on this site.

I would add an extra banana, and cut the peanut butter in half. and possibly even use crunchy instead of smooth

I expected there to be a bit more peanut butter flavor to it, but overall it was really moist, very good. We will be enjoying this again another time.
