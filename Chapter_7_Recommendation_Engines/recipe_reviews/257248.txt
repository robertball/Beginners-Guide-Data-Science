Great recipe Jeffrey. I prefer your method to the sunny-side-up recipes offered on this site. I hadn t thought of Egg in a Basket since I was a kid. My Grandma alternated this with loaded waffles (whipped cream jam syrup fruit) so my sisters & I wouldn t go into diabetic shock I guess... It s still a classic that holds up!
