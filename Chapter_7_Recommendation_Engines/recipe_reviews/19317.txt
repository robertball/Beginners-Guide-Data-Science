Although I am a vegetarian, this recipe was too healthy tasting even for me!  I did not find it easy (peeling and grating pumpkin takes time - even with a food processor!) or quick...It was also VERY squashy tasting.

I thought this was ok.  I added a can of diced tomatoes because I knew my 5 year old would turn his nose up if it didn't look more like spaghetti.  I also used canned pumpkin puree because I was searching for recipes to use a spare can I had in my pantry.  I might make this again, but will doctor it up to fit our tastes.

I added more tomato paste and some tomato sauce- and some much-needed spices (salt/pepper/cumin/garlic).  But was very tasty after a bit of tampering.

The consistency of the sauce is similar to pesto and was surprisly spicy. Delicious and was good with cashews and broccoli florets. Thank u Magdalene for the recipe. :)

Peeling, seeding and grating the pumpkin is not quick or easy (although using a food processor for the grating helps).  Once that's done, the rest is simple.  Sauce is good and certainly has pumpkin flavor, but is thick and doesn't stick to the pasta well.

I make something similar to this, but with butternut squash, roasted garlic, and madeira wine. I did not care for the overly-cloying texture, nor the taste of this dish. The mixture might be nice as a base for a vegetarian lasagna, however.

I thought this recipe was very simple and fast.  My husband even liked it and he is a very picky eater!

I used quinoa shells, and omitted the oil.  Just about the time when the pasta was done, I added the pumpkin to the water; in that minute the pumpkin cooked.  I just combined everything.  This is good!

This was great.  I love simple recipies, so I made this with canned pumpkin and chunky bottled marinara sauce.  I left out the sour cream, but added rosemary, oregano, basil and topped with parmesan...
