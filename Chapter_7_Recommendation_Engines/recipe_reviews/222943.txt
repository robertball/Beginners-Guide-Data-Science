In theory this sounds good but it didn't really work out as planned. I'd make this again but I would layer sliced apples and banana on the sandwich with the peanut butter and jelly and leave out the apple juice all together.

My son found this recipe and made it as written. We thought it was delicious but there was too much apple juice. We used the drained fruit, and it was great.

Delicious! Made it without the apple juice and it was completely scrumptious and made me feel full. :) I also used blueberry jam but either way it turned out great!

I agree with the other reviewers - too much juice!  You really don't need any juice at all.  Like Sarah Jo said, I think it would look better to simply layer the banana and apples, omit the juice all together.

I thought what Sarah Jo said sounded reasonable, so I decided to slice my bananas and apples onto one slice of bread. Then I mixed together the jam, peanut butter, and juice to put on the other slice. It's too much juice. Maybe half as much is needed. My homemade bread fell apart, but that didn't affect the taste one bit.
