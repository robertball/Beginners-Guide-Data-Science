I used about 4 quarts of water. I modified the recipe slightly, changes include 1/2 cup olive oil, 6 potatoes, 16 oz. baby carrots, 3 lbs of lentils, and 12 ounces of mushrooms. The total yield was around 7 1/2 quarts. I am going to be eating this for days!  I hope everyone else enjoys as much as I did.

Hearty, satisfying soup.  I liked the lentil and plantain combination, but next time I might try it with black beans just to see how that is.  My only problem was that the lentils needed to cook a little longer than the rest, but that could be because I didn't soak them long enough or because they were a bit old to begin with.

Not a bad soup- I diced instead of grating the onion, and added a can of diced tomoatoes as I didn't have any fresh.  I also added seasonings and a teaspoon of beef boullion.  My husband suggests adding meat as well, although that would make it not a vegetarian's choice.  Not too bad, but I wasn't impressed enough to make it again.

I omitted the plantains and bay leaf (because I have limited access to new ingredients) and added a red bell pepper. Spiced with coriander and paprika. After the soup simmered for almost an hour, I used a potato masher and smashed up the potatoes and lentils a bit to make it creamier. My first lentil soup, and I absolutely loved it.

This was my first attempt at lentil soup and it was a complete success with my family.  It's easy and fairly fail-proof. I've made this soup twice now and it's tasted better each time!  I modified it a bit; I diced the onions and tomatoes, (instead of grating them), and I also left out the plantains.  I added a *bit* of chicken broth, perhaps a cup, after it simmered a while and I thought that really added to the flavor.  I like lentils a little bit more on the tender side, so I soaked, then boiled, them for about 30 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  I also let the soup simmer longer.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made a large batch, and seperated it out into smaller containers.  I froze those containers and then took a few of them with me on a camping trip.  As they thawed I was able to reheat them on my stove.  It was still fabulous.

I pan-roasted the root vegs & caramelized the plantains (oiled skillet, low heat; cut each in half to shorten them, then split the halves, & lay the quarters flat-side down; let them brown, then flip & cook for half the time it took to brown the cut side).

I also used 6 cups of water to begin, then when the lentils began to suck up water & the soup beg@n to thicken, I added 2 cups of apple cider, &  2 tablespoons of Bragg’s live cider vinegar.
This soup can be eaten year round, cold in the hot months, & hot when it’s cold - flavorful,  filling, & brothy.   :—)
