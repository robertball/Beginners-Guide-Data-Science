I've made these twice now, and they turned out really nicely - and so pretty  too!  Let them cool completely before eating; they are even better on the second day and seem to freeze well.  I added jam both times I made them (see "cook's notes" section).  Be sure to use a thicker, non-watery jam or the edges of the Danish will get soggy.
