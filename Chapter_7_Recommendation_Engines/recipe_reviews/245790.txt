Love this! Use wheat beer (weisbeer) for a rasser! I asked a bartender to make me one of these when I got home from Germany years ago, and got a seriously dirty look. Now, their all the rage, just called shandy!

This was so refreshing!  Really similar to a British Shandy.  I used fresh lemonade, as that is what I had.  There were no complaints, except when the glass was empty!
