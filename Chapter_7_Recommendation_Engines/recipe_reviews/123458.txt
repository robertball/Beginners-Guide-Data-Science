Great way to use up the leftover ribeyes! I didn't already have cooked potatoes, so I just diced some up, and cooked them with salt and pepper in a large skillet, then added the peppers and onions, one garlic clove, then the steak pieces. Used colby jack cheese and was yummy!

I did make one alteration to the written recipe but I don't feel it is all that significant.  I was out of garlic powder, so I used Cavender's Greek seasoning, instead of the garlic , salt and pepper.  It has those seasonings in it, but also contains a little oregano and other flavors.  That being said, I found this to be a wonderful breakfast.  The yolk from the fried egg really added to it.  This is a keeper!

Great way to use up leftovers. The hash turned out kind of greasy, but that may be because of the steak. Will make again!

This was a great way to use up leftovers. We had left over prime rib from a night out (those things are ALWAYS too big for me to finish). I followed the recipe except using sharp cheddar cheese (it's what I had) and I just scrambled the eggs right into the mixture, like an unfolded omelette. We loved it.

Oh, we loved this!  Hubby had some refried beans and tortillas with his to make burritos.  The girls (2 & 7) loved this as well.  Great way to use up leftover steak!

my boyfriend's roomie had made steak and baked red potatoes, which were still there the next time i came over, so i offered to make a hash with them and we had "breakfast for dinner". had enough ingredients to more than double the recipe, so had to use a large pot. the boyz could not even wait for eggs, and raved about the hash which i served with sauteed green beans. will serve eggs with the leftovers :)

This was very yummy. I had to really season the potatoes though. Next time I make it I think I'll chop the bell in larger pieces. I also think it would be better with the sliced potatoes on the bottom (w/peppers and onions) and the meat on top and then the egg...or maybe dice the potatoes instead of sliced. I used leftover ribeyes and it tasted great!  Thank you!

I start by frying diced bacon, remove it and then fry up the onions, garlic and potatoes in the bacon fat.  Add peppers and mushrooms if I happen to have them, stir in and scramble the eggs, top with shredded cheese.  Heart attack on a plate, but it is DELICIOUS!  One of our favorite breakfast meals when we are camping!!!

Yummmy! I am eating this right now for breakfast very good and really filling for breakfast. I peeled and chopped my potatoes then boiled them in water until tender. I followed the recipe and directions to a "T" with great results. I made scrambled eggs for my youngest daughter and fried two eggs for me and topped mine with some hot sauce. Yummy will make again, thanks.

This was good, I used up some left over rib roast meat that I chopped into a bite sized dice, I used yukon gold potatoes that I precooked in the microwave whole w/ skin left on then diced them once they cooled.  I cooked diced onion and bell peppers until they were soft, removed from the pan and added the potatoes and cooked until golden brown.  I browned the steak until it was had some good color to it and was heated thru, then combined everything back in the pan to heat together.  Sprinkled cheese on top and served with a poached egg and fresh cracked pepper.....it was very quick, used up the leftover meat and veggies that I had....I'll use this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was outstanding!  My whole family loved it.  I used fresh minced garlic with the onion instead of garlic powder.  Otherwise, it was great as is.  I will make this a lot.

mmmmm, I used leftover rump roast instead of steak. Also, added green beans and zucchini that I had to use up. I will make this again.

Fantastic!  I had leftover steak I wanted to use up for lunch and found this!  I did used frozen hash browns and a red pepper.  The cheese made this kinda creamy!  It was so good!  Thanks!

Made this for 5 children and myself. Everyone loved it and wanted more! Did not have leftover potatoes so I microwaved some to make this. Fast, easy and delicious for children. Also, I have a child that does not like onions so I sautéed them separately. still good even though not cooked with onions or green pepper. Just added them after.
