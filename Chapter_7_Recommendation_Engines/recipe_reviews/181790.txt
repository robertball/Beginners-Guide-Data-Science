I cook my onions and celery in 1/4 cup butter before adding the broth for savory flavor.  Also substituted cornbread stuffing for 1/2 the herbed stuffing and added a splash of apple cider.  Very yummy!

I make a verison of this stuffing by browning celery and onions first, and using the sage and onion cubes.  I've added pork sausage, but it tastes just as good if you don't. Everyone always loves it.

I too browned the onions and celery in butter first.  I wish I'd known to used the crushed stuffing mix instead of cubed.  I had to use twice as much broth just to get it moist and then it was just "okay".

OK, so normally I do not change a recipe the first time I try it.  However, based on previous stuffings I have made and my family's preferences, I did make the following changes - and this is better than any other stuffing I've made.  I added about a cup of white cooking wine, 4 Tbsp of butter, and a package of sliced mushrooms to the boiling process.  I also used cornbread stuffing from Pepperidge Farm.  It was absolutely fabulous!!

This recipe got good reviews at our Christmas dinner, but I modified it quite a bit based on what I had on hand.  Diced 3 stalks celery and one onion and let it simmer with 4.5 cups of water and 2 T butter until soft.  Immediately mixed it with three 6 ounce boxes of stuffing mix, transferred to baking dish and baked it for 15 minutes @ 400 degrees.  Wonderful and moist!  I followed the directions on the box for the water measurement (1.5 cups per box)  It really didn't need to be baked and could have been served immediately.  Nice addition to jazz up plain stuffing!

I really didn't like this stuffing at all and neither did my guests :( I'll stick to the old fashioned way of doing my stuffing next year :(

I added my own fresh cornbread and mixed the two for Thanksgiving. This was not well received, I always add more broth. This is great to use when your fixing a quick week night meal, not Thanksgiving

I added more seasoning & some long grain & wild rice to it. It was very good, but not "the one". Very easy basic recipe to adjust and add things too. Maybe apples? cranberries?

I followed the directions but it would have turned out better if I would have prepared it like I usually do.  I should have sauteed the onion and celery in butter not boil them.  Like others said, it needed more broth.
