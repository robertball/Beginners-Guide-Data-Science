What a great recipe!  A good use of that last, lonely banana....  Instead of adding peanuts, I just used cruchy peanut butter. The first time I made this bread, I used raisins.  Very good.  The second time, I substituted chocolate chips.  A whole new experience!  Kinda like peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, only better for you.

I made this bread into muffins which worked great as long as you remember to take them out of the oven after about 15 minutes. I also decided to use chocolate chips instead of raisins which was fantastic.

This bread didn't impress me a whole lot. Maybe I need to make adjustments for living at a higher elevation because it didn't seem all that moist. Oh and I didn't add raisins because some of my kids don't like raisins. I added chocolate chips in place of the raisins. Maybe the raisins add a degree of moistness. Oh and for some reason I didn't care much for the chopped peanuts in the bread. If I make it again I would leave those out and add an extra tablespoon of creamy peanut butter instead to help increase the peanut flavor.

This is pretty good. I used 2 bananas and omitted the extra peanuts because the peanut butter I used was very chunky. I put in about 1/2 cup of peanut butter to balance out the extra banana. The flavor is good and the consistency quite dense. Definitely better warmed up and spread with a little butter! Quick and easy to make and no mixer required!

This turned out wonderful was a tad bit sticky/chewy when eating but tasted great. I doubled up the recipe and made four mini loaves. Tastes great with just a touch of jam spread on.

Very good recipe and easy to make. A great use for that last banana! I too used cruncy peanut butter instead of the peanuts.

This dough was really thick as is. I added one more banana and it loosened a little. I doubled this and it made two smallish medium-sized loaves. If I were to make this again I'd triple it to make two large medium-sized loaves.

I just made this! It is definitely a different taste. I am not sure I like the raisins and peanut butter together. I did not have nuts so i put couple extra raisins.... but texture and all turned out fine. It is not bad! I am eating a piece right now with milk right now..

It wasn't a 'wow' recipe but that said my family ate the whole loaf in 2 days. I altered the recipe by using 3 medium bananas to make it more moist. I doubled up on the baking soda and baking powder to make it fluffier less dense. I didn't have any peanuts at the time so made it with no peanuts but I did put raisins in the recipe. If I make the recipe again I'll skip the raisins and substitute with chocolate chips. I think the taste of the raisins didn't go very well with the peanut butter/banana flavour but that's just my own personal taste. Someone else may really like it.

It's delicious but by following the ingredients ratio, there was no taste of banana.  :)

Recipes cooking time is 20 minutes too long. I took it out at 30 because it was burning
