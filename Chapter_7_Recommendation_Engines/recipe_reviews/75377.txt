Absolutely fantastic!  The only changes I made were to saute onion with the pork and skipped the cheese melting part.  We topped it with cheese, sour cream, olives, and tomatoes and scooped it up with chips.  In fact, I'm eating leftovers right now!  The only thing I would mention that the instructions do not is to stir occasionally while it's simmering, because the rice stuck a little--thank goodness for teflon!  Thanks for the recipe!

Somehow I could not bring myself to use the soup.  Instead I pureed 1 can of drained pinto beans and added that.  The family loves this recipe. Including the son who does not like beans!

This recipe was terrific; I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover roast pork, so I just skipped the meat-browning step, & browned the onions on their own, then added the cooked chopped pork.  I also added some fresh cialntro abour 10 minutes before serving, for that hit of fresh flavour.  Perfect!

This recipe deserves 10 stars - it was so simple and so delicious! The only changes I made were to add some salt and pepper to the pork while it was browning, and I substituted cheddar for the Colby. We ate this "nachos" style, topped with more cheese (we're from Wisconsin and there is no such thing as too much cheese!) and sour cream, and scooped up with tortilla chips. You just HAVE to try this recipe - it's so much better than you think it's going to be! To cut down on the dishes, I did everything in one large, oven-proof skillet, and then just popped that into the oven instead of dirtying a 13 x 9. I can't wait to make this again! Thank you for a killer dinner!

I used chicken instead of pork and 2 cans of ro*tel instead of canned green chillies.  The can of cream of chicken soup made it really creamy. This recipe was awesome!

This dish was outstanding! Very quick and easy to prepare but tastes delicious. I added cayenne pepper for a little zip, increased the salsa to 4 tablespoons and used 2 cups of 4 Chees Mexican cheese (monterey jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla and asadero shredded cheese).  The additional cheese allowed to completely cover the baking dish.  the extra cheese is personal preference...I like a lot of cheese!  When served I topped mine with sour cream and extra salsa, but it was very good without the extra toppings too.

Fabulous!  And incredibly easy! I did replace the green chili's with a can of rotel. And with a dollop of sour cream, this casserole is incredible!

This was really good and the family enjoyed it.  I made quite a few changes, though, due to taste and what I had on hand.  I used steamed Jasmine rice (uncooked 1 cup) in place of instant brown rice.  I used 1 can of tomatoes and green chiles and a 4 oz can of tomato sauce in place of the can of tomatoes and can of chiles.  I didn't add the water because of how I made the rice.  I added 1 Tbsp of green chile powder.  I added a can of drained sweet corn.  I used Campbells Healthy Request soup (can't have regular due to MSG).  I added 2 minced cloves of roasted garlic to the meat as it cooked - and used peppercorn pork tenderloin. I used Southwestern Salsa.  I also used shredded sharp cheddar.  I didn't cook the mixture in the oven - just let it simmer on the stove top and added the cheese at the table (didn't want to wash another pan).  I served it with tortilla chips and fresh avocado on top.

I'm going to use all the ingredients but the rice and make a dip, substituting ground beef for the pork.  I'm also going to try the entire recipe with chicken.

Very yummy and "stick to your ribs" and great on a cold evening - lots of leftovers, too!

I agree with Mesadebs, puree a drained can of pinto beans and it gives the creamy texture, it's healthier and is low in sodium (much more mexican than using canned soup). I used two cans of "hot" chile peppers, and a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I only had about a tablespoon of cumin, so I added some coriander with it, and the flavor was outstanding. Topped it with sharp cheddar cheese, and served it with tortillas, muy bueno!

This was really, really good and very easy to make.  I stuck to the recipe but made some slight modifications that I think spiced it up a little.  I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, salt and pepper to the pork while browning.  I used Zesty Jalapeno tomatoes and hot fire roasted chilies for some heat.  Some of the reviews mentioned not enough spice.  So, I used 1 packet of taco seasoning with just 1 tablespoon of cumin.  I think using the taco seasoning made the difference.  I also added a can of corn to the mix for extra veggies and color.  I served in warm soft flour tortillas with salsa and sour cream.  YUMMY!  This recipe makes a lot so be prepared for leftovers.  I actually ended up freezing half for another time.  This will definitely be in my standard rotation!  Thanks!

Yum, I really enjoyed this healthy recipe.  Some good spice to it and the cheese on top is makes it gooey and very tasty.  Great for a quick dinner for my family.

This recipe was ok for us.  Seemed a little bland, we needed to add a little more hot sauce than normal to give it a kick.  Next time I think I'll play with the spices and add more than just cumin.  The only change I made was I didn't have black beans so I used pinto. Not bad but wasn't our favorite either!

This was even better than I expected!  I did use 1 can of chile peppers and a can of rotel with chiles for the tomatoes and I used regular brown rice.  Since I used regular brown rice instead of instant I increased the water to 2 cups and let it simmer a little longer.  We ate it with natural tortilla chips two nights in a row.  It got rave reviews from everyone!

4 of my neighbors followed their noses to my kitchen and loved it. I liked it very much, too.  We didn't even bake it in the oven.  As soon as that stuff was hot, we grated the cheese over it and chowed down.  I made some changes out of necessity, because I didn't have everything and some changes out of preference, because I'm the cook and I can do it any way I want.  Here goes:  I didn't have pork, so I used leftover, skinned, deboned chicken thighs and drumsticks.  I chopped a 1/2 a large onion, a couple chopped cloves of garlic and a seeded, chopped sweet yellow bell pepper and sauteed them all in a little chicken fat until they were done, then mixed all the canned ingredients into them.  I used a small can of chopped mild green chilies and a (generic) can mild Rotel tomatoes and chilies.  I doubled the cream of chicken soup (2 cans) and added about 1/4 cup good quality salsa (I like Herdez, it's an authentic Mexican brand, high quality and very reasonable.).  I used leftover cooked brown rice that I had on hand and the can of drained and rinsed black beans, but I also added a drained 29 oz. can of white hominy.  Why?  Because I like hominy, and it's very southwestern.  I didn't have any cumin, so I skipped it and I used grated sharp cheddar, it was all I had.  Good stuff.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some left over pork roast and tried this.  Since the pork was already cooked, I just sauted some chopped onion in a small amount of chicken broth and added the pork, black beans, tomatoes with green chili peppers in them, a can of corn, a can of cream of chicken, three Tb of salsa, and 1 Tb of cumin, no water since I didn't add the rice.  My husband preferred it over rice so I cooked the rice separate.  I heated it on the stove top and didn't put it in the oven.  We both enjoyed it. I ate it with chips like a dip with shredded Mexi cheese and sour cream stirred in .    Thanks for the suggestions from others. Will definitely make this again.

I served this with whole wheat tortillas and my family raved about this dish!  It was very tasty.  I may try chicken next time as I am not a big pork fan.

I made this for my friends and their boyfriends, everyone loved it and we're having the leftovers for lunch today! We used chicken instead of pork, and rotel instead of green chiles, served with tortillas and sour cream. Awesome dish! Thanks!

This was a very enjoyable dish.  I served it for a luncheon with some girlfriends and they had me copy the recipe for them. Our dish was moist and tender. It's always best to use good cuts of meat for more sucessful dishes.

I felt like I was in authentic Mexican restaurant eating this dish. I loved it. I used chicken rather than pork, and I did not have instant brown rice so I parboiled the regular brown rice, drained it and added instead (that part was a bit annoying). We enjoyed the leftovers as well.

This was good, liked having a new way to use some leftover pork roast. Used two 10 oz cans of tomatoes w/green chiles already added and did not add any additional green chiles. Also just spooned hot mixture into tortilla and put cheese on top, did not put it in the oven.

I was looking for a way to use leftover shredded pork from a party I threw and came across this. This was amazing! I also gave a bit to three other people to try and everyone agreed that it was a keeper. Having made this, I DO recommend using a little seasoning with the pork as well as subbing cheddar for the Colby. This is going in my recipe box right now!!!

It's okay, but probably not a keeper. I had to add some spices because it was a little bland for my taste. I think it could be the kind of food that will taste a million times better after sitting in the fridge overnight. Still, it is filling and relatively healthy. I really love pork and green chiles, but I will keep looking for a better way to combine them.

Absolutely a fabulous recipe. It made a perfect 9 X 13 inch dish. I will 100% for sure make this for company.  Serving it with warm tortillas on the side is a nice touch.  Do not try to put this casserole into the tortilla as the picture shows - that's a disaster.

I cooked this as per directions, except I pre-cooked my own brown rice in the rice cooker and put it in at the end.  Just wonderful!  Our grown son stopped by and when he tasted this, he gave it ten stars and took a Tupperware container home with him.

Made this just tonight for supper and my husband absolutely LOVED it. Is super simple; the only effort involves cutting up the pork. I only made 3 changes to this: instead of using 2 cans of green chilies, I added a couple extra Tablespoons of salsa, then used a can of Rotel (tomatoes w/green chilies) With Lime and Cilantro instead of plain Rotel. Last change I made due to time constraints was that I didn't put the casserole in the oven to melt the cheese, simply layered it over the hot (bubbling) casserole in my saute pan and let it melt there.  Served this with sour cream and diced fresh tomatoes.  YUM!

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and took it to my Bible study.  Everyone really liked it.  The only changes I made was to add some taco seasoning and and I used cooked brown rice instead of the instant.  I didn't put it in a 9 x 13 pan, I just put it in my crock pot for easy transportation and had warm flour tortillas and grated cheese on the side.  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was great as a filling for tortillas or as a nacho topping.  I used instant white rice as I didn't have brown rice on-hand; would substitute 2 Rotels for the diced toms/diced chilies; would use 1 Tbsp, instead of 2, of cumin, and add a dash of oregano.  Serve with sour cream and avocados.

This was a great family recipe.  Both of my kids gobbled it up rolled in tortillas burrito style.  I made my changes: sauteed onion with the pork, added seasoning salt, added can corn and pigeon peas and lots more spice and cheese to our taste.  Yum!!

Very good recipe! I did substitute chicken for the pork, also used diced tomatoes with green chiles and only 1 can of green chiles instead of 2. I didn't have colby cheese so I used sharp cheddar cheese. Served over tortilla chips like nachos, it was very much like a dip. Will definately make again!

WOW--We really liked this one!  We only used one can of the green chilis which was fine for us; and my boyfriend thinks we should cut back a bit on the Cumin next time so maybe we'll try 1 1/2T of that instead of the 2T.  This is a really good, filling dish.

Loved it!  We tried it with corn tortilla, but the strong flavor of the tortilla somewhat stole flavor from the recipe...so we'll use either flour tortillas next, or just all by itself.  We used non-fat soup.  It tastes EXCELLENT!

Made this for a church potluck and it disappeared quickly! I cooked up 1 cup brown rice the evening before, substituted cream of celery soup, and omitted the water. 2 Tbsp cumin is not too much. Delicious!

This is a great and simple recipe. Made it tonight and all loved it. The kids ate it in tortillas (like a burrito). I do like my food a little more on the spicy side so I added 1 small can of jalapeno Rotel and used pepper jack and cheddar cheese. I also cooked for 30 minutes without the cheese then added the cheese and cooked for another 15 minutes. Also I used a small pork butt roast instead of chops (much more tender). Do remember to rinse the black beans (as the recipe calls for) or they will turn your food grey. This is not the prettiest dish I have ever made.  But all in all this is a keeper.

Excellent flavor! I made the following changes: I omitted the rice, cooked everything in a large pot, and added a large dollop of cheese-whiz. We eat them like nachos with sour cream, yummy!!

We really liked this dish!!  We love spicy food, so we added some cayenne pepper and Cajun seasoning.  As other reviewers suggested we also added a can of corn - we used white shoepeg.  We will definitely be making this again.

I used a can of refried beans like others suggested to avoid the cream of chicken soup. This stuff was very delicious! My husband loved loved love it! I think I had a can of HOT rotel in there, so it was very hot, next time I'll probably skip anything with Habaneros in it. I will definitely make this again. And it does make alot, so be prepared for a crowd or plenty of yummy left overs!

I made this for a pot luck and it was a big hit.  I did not change a single ingredient.  The one and only adjustment I made was to put the dish in a crock pot, layer the cheese on top and allowed the cheese to melt while the crock pot was on the keep warm setting for an hour.  Don't be afraid of the cream of chicken soup and the seasoning was perfect.

This was great. I made it for camping and made it the night before and everyone liked it. Instead of baking it, I reheated in a pot and then added the cheese. I will make it a little spicier next time to suit my taste.

I used leftover pork roast and pinto beans instead of black.  It was very yummy, the whole family liked it.  I did adjust the seasonings for the kiddos.  I used 1 can homemade tomatoes and one can of rotel that I rinsed.  Didn't add can green chilis or salsa.  I would have liked it that way but not the kids.  I figure I can always add salsa to mine.  We topped with sour cream and more cheese and wrapped in flour tortillas.  I'm thinking I'll make the leftovers into quesadillas and enchiladas.  VERY GOOD!

I would give this 4 stars as is, but with a few additions it's definitely a 5.   Per others' suggestions, I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper and some chili powder will browning. I also added in half a bag of frozen corn to the mixture. And instead of water, I used chicken broth. I ended up having to cook the mixture longer than 15 minutes to get the rice to soften. Next time I will cut up the pork a little smaller if serving in tortillas. And I didn't have any cilantro on hand, but it would be great with cilantro on top. My boyfriend loved this. It was a hit! And it's even better as leftovers the next day. Yum!

This was so fantastic!  I had about a half of a pork loin roast i had made for dinner one night and decided to use it up a little differently this time.  Glad I found this recipe!  instead of brown instant rice I used my regular jasmine and since I didn't have any black beans on hand, used 2 cans of white beans and 2 cans of diced tomatoes so that the casserole would be more moist.  used a mexican blend of shredded cheese as well and boy did our entire family really dig this dish!!  we had it for left=overs at least twice which is rare in this house!  Thanks and I WILL make this again!

We really liked this! I would use more cumin and chili powder next time though. And the kids wanted more cheese. Adults added cilantro and jalapeno which really topped it off. Kids added sour cream. We ate this with corn tortillas. I let this sit while I was preparing the rest of the meal (this really is a quick yummy dish!) and the longer it sat before baking in the oven, the more the flavors blended together. This was good eaten with chips as a dip the next day.

I needed about triple the amount of water to get the rice cooked, but we thought this was pretty darn good. I sauteed garlic and onion with the pork and used fire roasted tomatoes.

I followed the suggestions of others and this was great. My family and guests loved it, and I'll definitly make it again.  I used a pork picnic roast instead of loin, and sauted it with garlic, salt and pepper.  I added an packet of taco seasoning, a can of corn and served it with salsa and sour cream. Delicious!

Pretty bland - but it could be a good starter recipe. Needs a lot more spice and flavor.

At the suggestion of some other useres, I used 2 cans of Rotele.  It was highon the spicy side with that much Rotele.  Will use one can and some diced fresh plum tomatoes next time.  The teens in our hous said it looked "disgusting" and were hesitant to try it.  It does not look very appetizing and it was problematic.  I ended up rolling up as burritos for them and adding alot of cheese in the roll.  We adults at it plain or with chips and sour cream on top. I had leftover pork roast and cuban black beans from Christmas and the black beans give it the ookey color.  If I make again I will use pinks or pintos so it doesnt have that grayish color.  Overall quite tasty tho once you get it past your eyes.

This was very yummy.  A great comfort food.  I added some chedder cheese into the mix, and then topped with more chedder cheese.  I enjoyed the texture of the brown rice in this dish.  I used only 1 can of green chili's and halved the cumin.  It was still awesome.  I will make this again.

Loved the taste of this dish and the ease of making it!  I only wish it was easier to make only 1/2.... I end up feeding the office with the leftovers (and they are very grateful!).  Thanks for a super supper!

This was an excellent recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe to a T but used Chicken instead of Pork and left out the 1/4 c. water, used Italian Diced Tomatoes and only 1 T. Cumin since others said it was too strong but I didn't even taste it - this makes a TON so we will be eating it as leftovers tonight and probably tomorrow, that is how much is left. We used Tortillas and ate it as a wrap. SO GOOD! Thanks!!!

This recipe is just bursting with flavor, and it is so easy to make.  I did make a few changes, I used chicken instead of pork, I sauteed half an onion with the chicken, and I pre-cooked regular brown rice instead of instant. If you liked this recipe I suggest you try "Beans and Rice" from this website (don't let the name fool you, it really isn't like rice and beans at all).

Pretty good, I must say.  I did up the water to 1/2 c., and used the Rotel as others suggested.  I also used the colby/monterey jack cheese.  Note:  Not good for those with taste buds that don't agree with heat.

A few unintended changes to the recipe but it turned out great anyway. Didn't have green chiles so substituted a fresh HOT jalepeno with the seeds. No plain diced tomatoes but I had fire roasted diced tomatoes. Leftover cooked long grain white rice. Added a bit of onion as someone else suggested when cooking the pork and some leftover cooked corn on the cob. No cream of chicken soup so I added cream of mushroom. White cheddar instead of colby. The cooked rice didn't need the liquid of the missing green chiles. Great for the leftovers I had in the fridge to use up. Will definitely make again. A very 'forgiving' recipe with all of the substitutions. And it has the zip that some other reviewers said was a little light.

I don't bake it, and the cheese is added to individual servings, as one of the family doesn't eat cheese. A little sour cream on top is good, too. Fresh peppers can be substituted for the canned. I reduce the cumin to 1-1/2 Tbsp. I have made it with regular brown rice - add extra water and lots of extra cooking time. You can also use red/pinto beans in place of the black. With only three of us, there were leftovers, but they were gone the next day!

Except I made quite a few changes based on other reviewers. Added onions and garlic when sautéing the pork. Added 1 cup frozen corn, used white beans, used less cumin, added oregano, used 1 can Rotel. Also just put cheese on top and covered to melt instead of dirtying another pan. But it was really good - I'm sure the original would have been, too!

I'm not sure I should rate this because I used what I had on hand. Used leftover chopped pork shoulder roast and cooked rice. My homemade Mexican seasoning to taste in place of that much cumin and salt to taste.  Pretty much followed the recipe other than that. Then instead of baking with cheese on top, we dipped it hot over nachos, then topped off with queso and sour cream. Absolutely delicious. Will go in my recipe box.

Flavor wise I thought this recipe was very good. Instead of using canned green chilies I used roasted and frozen Hatch green chilies. In our case I used 4 diced medium hot Big Jims. For those that thought the recipe was bland, canned green chilies are bland in flavor and somewhat lacking in heat. If frozen chilies aren't available you might consider adding some pepper flake to give it some kick. The only problem I had making this dish was that the rice absorbed the liquid rather quickly and I had to add water to keep it from scorching. All total I added approximately another half cup of water before the rice was done. Thanks for sharing.

The amount of liquid that ends up in this recipe wasn't enough to cook the rice properly for me.  It evaporated long before 15 minutes had elapsed, and the rice stuck to the bottom of my pan throughout, but far worse the drier the mixture became.  I had to add another 1/2 cup of water and cook it further to get the rice to an acceptable state.  I would suggest adding a full cup of low-sodium chicken stock instead of 1/4 cup water and simmering until most of the liquid is gone/absorbed.

I used black beans I prepared myself, and a can of Rotel fire-roasted diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I only used about a teaspoon of cumin, because I felt 2 tbs was  overkill, and fresh-ground is more potent anyways.

If I made this dish again, I might double up on the diced tomatoes and add another 1/4 cup rice.  It certainly didn't need salt, but a splash of lime juice might not be a bad idea on each serving.

I am a novice cook, so I made this exactly as instructed and it was a hit! My 8 year old came back for thirds!  I would make this again.  This would also probably be good and filling without the  meat.

So good as a casserole or in a tortilla. I did majorly tweak the preparation. Cubed up leftover pork chops, put them in a casserole dish with already cooked rice and all the other ingredients. Sprinkled  the cheese and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. I left out the cumin, had enough flavor for me.

I made it with fresh Hatch green chilies and garlic. I will add sautéed onions next time too. I might skip the soup, or only add 1/2 a can as the finished product was too thick.

I had to use some substitutions, too, but this is a good template.  Next time, I'd add some ripe olives and chopped onions, or maybe green onions toward the end.  I used basmati rice and added extra water (next time, I'll use chicken broth), letting it simmer longer. Had to use a can of chicken gravy, kidney beans, and frozen jalapeños and fish peppers from my garden.  A small amount of meat goes a long way!

The casserole was good with additional tomato purée and Salsa to cut down the overwhelming cumin taste.  Two tablespoons of cumin is way too much, 2 tsp would have been better.

Good everyday dinner.  I only used one can of chillies and then sprinkled in some cayenne and used pepper jack cheese on top.  I also dumped about a half a cup of frozen corn right from the frozen bag.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used an oven safe pot to save washing an extra dish.  Next time I think I will just skip the oven and have the cheese melt right on the stove top.

This recipe was just ok. Really bland. May try with chicken and sautée it with some taco seasoning. Would also be good on tortilla chips. Would definitely top with  sour cream, spicier cheese, and more salsa.

I used regular brown rice instead of instant, and did not cut up the pork (I used boneless pork chops).  I browned the chops, mixed the remaining ingredients (except cheese) in a casserole dish (adding a little extra water), buried the pork chops in the mixture, covered it, and let it cook at 275 degrees for 3 1/2 hours.  I took off the lid, stirred around the pork chops a little, and sprinkled on the cheese 10 minutes before the cooking time was up.  It turned out delicious ... pork was tender and flavorful, and the rice mixture had a nice consistency and a wonderful flavor.

I used pork loin tips, cut into SMALL bite size pieces. I only used 1-1/2 Tbsp. cumin, but may use full 2 Tbsp. next time. Simmered longer than 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Did not bake. Served cheese, sour cream and tortillas on the side. Family enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of black beans, but their texture is right for this dish.

yum...didn't have cream of chicken soup so I made my own using vegetable broth and peppers.  Added corn and used rest of vegetable broth instead of water.  Used fresh diced tomato.  Added some fresh jalapeno.  Spiced up a little with cayenne with cumin.    So good and quick to make!!  It made two 8 inch pans so I sent one back to college with son.  We tried it with both a warmed corn tortilla and chips...liked chips better!

This was good however I can't figure out how 1/4 C of water was supposed to cook 1 1/2 cups of rice?!? I used white rice, maybe the brown takes less liquid? Anyway I ended up using about 2 cups of water. I added extra green chilis and can tomato to fit my tastes. I think i would use more pork and less rice next time. I also used pepperjack colby and cheddar cheeses. Oh. I seasoned the pork with the cumin, all seasoning and pepper before browning. I will keep this recipe, and play with it :)

UPDATE 10/28
I made this tonight with pork, leftover rice and an entire jar of salsa. I browned the pork, added the leftover rice, a can of black beans and a jar of salsa. I let it cook for a minute then topped with cheese and popped it in the oven. One dish. It was done in 20ish minutes. That's how I will be making this from now on (pre cooked rice, more salsa, no soup)

good recipe! changes made were: chicken breast instead of pork, 1 Tbs. cumin only (2 seemed excessive, even for someone who really likes cumin in the mexican food), 1 can green chiles only, sprinkling of chili powder & garlic powder, plus about 3/4 tsp. salt added.  also completely covered in cheese before baking.  serve with pico de gallo & guacamole!

I got this recipe a few years ago from a friend.  The only difference is her recipe only calls for 1 C of rice and 1 tsp of cumin and is baked in a 2Q casserole dish.  Wonderful quick and easy dinner though.  I love this one!

I had some peeled roasted green chile left over & didnt want it to go bad, so i gave this recipe a shot.  Since i didnt have instant brown rice, i cooked some of the normal kind in a pressure cooker for 18 mins and added it to the casserole   (nixing the additional water).  The result was a very nice burrito stuffer.

I only had one tablespoon of cumin. I had to add extra water for the rice to cook. I only had one can of green chile peppers, but I had about 4 to 5 tablespoons japleno peppers. I used mexican shredded cheese instead of colby. Might try a mexican rice instead of brown rice next time. I really enjoyed something new. Great recipe! Thank you for your receipe

This casserole was quick and delicious!  I served directly from the saucepan and did not use tortillas.  No need to bake in the oven just sprinkle the cheese on top when dish is still hot.  I used a pork tenderloin that cooked in the Crockpot all day.  Wonderful!

Awesome!!! I used chicken instead of pork because that's what was in the freezer. Other then that I followed the recipe, it was fantastic! The family all loved it so its a keeper for sure. Quick and easy, as well as full of flavor and filling. Thanks a lot for this one.

Very good! My only substitution was sharp cheddar instead of colby cheese. I took suggestions of others, making it in a large skillet and just popping that in the oven, as well as trying it with Scoops chips.  Both were excellent ideas.  I served it with one of my favorite sides, fried plantain sprinkled with nutmeg and kosher salt, and topped it off with a margarita.

I used a pork loin roast instead. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the tomatoes or not. So I did. But this was still too soupy to put on a tortilla so we scooped it up with baked tortilla chips. I would definitely recommend increasing the cheese by at least another cup. I added pre-cooked brown rice just before sticking it in the oven. (Deleted the extra water). Pretty bland even though I added garlic, onion and chipotle powder.

Liked this a lot.  Added chopped black olives.  Also skipped the baking step - stirred in 1/2 cup of colby-jack cheese and then sprinkled the other 1/2 on top to melt.  Might have been a little better baked, but decided to keep it a 1 pot meal instead.  Next time I may add some corn just to add another flavor and texture.

This is a good basic casserole.  I used red kidney beans because I didn't have black beans and cream of mushroom soup for the same reason.  I also cooked the brown rice in chicken stock before adding to mixture.  I added a teaspoon of taco seasoning along with the cumin and instead of water I put 1/4 cup chicken stock.  I will make this again with more seasonings.

Made as written, this is seriously lacking in flavor. I added more cumin, garlic, chili powder, and a good pinch of chipotle powder. This improved it a great deal but there was still something lacking. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

Very delicious! My husband and I were very impressed. 

I used the substitution of rotel instead of diced tomatoes.  Also, the store was out of black beans so I used kidney beans instead.

My family and I loved this dish -we've already made it a few times! It's so easy!  We made the following substitutions: used Rotel instead of the regular tomatos, and we added peppercinis.  Also used chicken instead of pork.  Used green salsa and low fat soup.

Like everyone else, I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm also not sure what I'm going to do with all the leftovers - it makes alot!  I used 1 1/2T cumin instead which was perfect for that spice, but it seemed like it needed something else.  I might sub more salsa for some diced tomatoes or maybe some diced jalapenos for a little of the green chiles.  I'm going to make sausage-shapped rolls for freezing so I can slap it in a tortilla for a quick lunch.

This is pretty good.  I think it needed a few more spices, but it was tasty as is. I might add some dried chipotle red pepper and cilantro. I liked the instant brown rice it made the recipe a little healthier and faster. I don't think it's a company meal, but it was a nice family dinner. Thanks.

Thought this recipe was excellent. Eat it with tortillas, tortilla chips, or just with some sour cream.  I used chicken instead of pork and used 2 cans of rotel in place of diced tomatoes and green chiles.

I only had one can of green chilies, but it was still really good! We topped it with light sour cream. I thought the pork came out super tender. I also sauted onions with the pork, and used cut-up pork roast instead of pork chops because that's what I had.

We thought this was ok but were expecting more flavor.  Next time I make this I am going to add garlic and onion when cooking the pork and use taco seasoning instead of cumin.  

That said I will still be making it again.

This was good but after adding water, it was too liquidy.  I might use chicken instead or pork next time since my family is not so fond of pork.

I had every intention of making this exactly as written, but as I assembled my ingredients I discovered I had forgotten to buy salsa.  So I did the Ro-Tel tomatoes route several others have suggested.  I used a boneless pork tenderloin and the meat was very tender.  I cut back a good bit on the cumin because of personal preference.  I heated some flour tortillas on a griddle until they were crisp, and we just broke off pieces to eat with the casserole.  We will definitely have this again.

This was simple but very tasty.  I forgot to drain and rinse the black beans so it turned out a little saucey.  But it was still great. My husband is not a big fan of casseroles but he enjoyed this one. I will make this again! Would make a great filling for burritos!

This was average at best.  I would use chicken rather than pork.  The pork was really dry.  My kids eat everything and this was a bust with them.

My family and I really liked this one. I did make a couple changes....I used Campbells southwest style pepper jack soup in place of the cream of chicken and I added a can of mexicorn and some sliced olives. The leftovers make a great filling for enchiladas!!!!!

This is a fabulous dish.  I added fresh cilantro otherwise made it exactly and everyone in my family liked it, including my 8 year son who doesn't like many casseroles.  This is going into the mix of favorites at our household!

This recipe is not quite a 5 but it's more than a 4, and certainly worth making.  The only thing is you may have to add more than 1/4 cup of water.  I added more water twice.  The dish was really good but not as good as leftovers, like some are.  I will be making this for small dinner parties in the future.
