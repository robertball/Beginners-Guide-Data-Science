This receipe was genius!! This is the perfect receipe for a Friday night when the kids want pizza but you don't want to spend the extra money for it. This is the perfect alternative! I did make some changes.Instead of using powdered sloppy joe mix I used Manwich which I believe adds more flavor. We also added some turkey pepperoni as well as mushrooms.The kids absloutely LOVED it!!

We added pepperoni to this recipe, just under the top crust. It was excellent, my husband and I loved it. Thank you.

My family loves pizza and even sloppy joes but this was just too much.  It just wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it.

This recipe was easy and had a great "crust"!  I used ground turkey and added some onions to the mix.  Also used 2 cups of that pizza blend cheese from Kroger instead of the cheeses listed.  I might add some more sauce next time.

my whole family liked this recipe, i followed it exactly. the top got a bit dark when cooking for the full 40 mins, but the bottom layer of rolls needed to be cooked that long, so next time i may cover w/ foil.

This was a hit with my family...and when you can find a fast & tasty recipe that will satisfy 5 children and a hubby...its a keeper! I didn't have pizza sauce so I improvised with spaghetti sauce, still tasted great. I also added garlic, onion and seasoning salt, when the ground beef was cooking. This will be a great recipe for those rushed-I-need-something-fast-and-tasty-meal nights.

This was a great twist on other pizza casseroles I've tried.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding green peppers to the hamburger mixture.  My family loved it and said it's a "keeper."

This made a great meal for my family. They loved it. I added a little extra cheese and also used Manwich instead of the seasoning packet. Super easy and even more filling!!

What a great recipe!  The only thing I added was pepperoni right in between the cheese and the pizza sauce.  I also used the multigrain cresent rolls.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

My family loved this. I used a jar of garden vegetable spaghetti sauce and no pizza sauce or sloppy jo seasoning. I added chopped olives to the sauce, and some mild peppers on top of the sauce. I only had cheddar cheese, and it turned out great. The only thing is that the top crust gets dark too fast, and the bottom crust seemed a bit undercooked.

My family loved this recipe. I think next time I make it I am going to add some other ingredients in it. Like mushrooms, green peppers. You can add anything you like. I know the rolls was a great ingredient and it made it even more delicious.

I thought this was the best pizza casserole. I added green peppers also after reading a review. Those green peppers really set it off

I just made this for the first time Monday night and my husband 2 yr old son LOVED it!!  We only ate half of it so we're eating the leftovers tonight.  I only needed to bake it for 25 minutes though as opposed to 40 min.  But it was great!!

I liked this recipe and so did my husband. It could have used some more things like green peppers, mushrooms, sausage and other things we put on pizza. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe, I did take the advice of another user and used manwhich instead of the seasoning.  My picky eaters wouldn't eat much of it so I shared it with my neighbors and they loved it.  I will make this again!

Followed this recipe exactly.  My family wasn't impressed.  It was just an "ok" recipe.  Probably will not fix it again.
