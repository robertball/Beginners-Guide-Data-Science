This was one of the easiest dinners ever.  I used dried oregano, thyme, and rosemary, because I had it in my cupboard already.  I also used pepper and cut a cup up clove of garlic because I also had that instead of pepper-garlic seasoning.
My whole house was filled with the most wonderful aroma when this was roasting.  
This is very easy and I found it to be very inexpensive. (I hate when I spend more on ingrediants than if I had taken the family out to a restaraunt!)
The taste could not be beat when it comes to roasted chicken.
I will make this often.

This is such a great starter recipe.  You can change it to fit whatever you have in your pantry.  I really didn't follow the recipe at all; I oiled the chicken leg quarters with olive oil & rubbed a handful of dried spices over the leg quarters; I did follow the baking time.  If you don't have a broiler rack, you can line a baking sheet (WITH A LIP ON THE SIDE) with foil & lay a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet.
