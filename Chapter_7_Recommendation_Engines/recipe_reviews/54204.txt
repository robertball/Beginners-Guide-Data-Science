Tasty and quick (once you get everything cooking).  I would actually cook the meat in the coconut milk mixture for the stated time- it is still moist and tender but it infuses the flavors.  I also added carrots, potatoes, and green peas.  A note on the curry paste- it is usually sold in Asian markets in cans the size of tuna, If you buy this size, half a can will make a pretty spicy dish.  Usually a fourth of a can will impart pleanty of flavor if you like some spice but not too much.  Enjoy!

I changed this recipe up a bit.
I didn't have any dried shrimp so i left that out. I used only 1 Tbsp of Sambal Oelek paste instead of the red chili paste. My kids don't like it to spicy.  I also added 1 T of cumin.
I added some extra veggies.
1 jicama chopped, 1 green pepper chopped,1 shredded carrot and 1 cup snow peas chopped and 1 cup chopped kale.
I always add extra veggies just to get them in for the kids.
These added veggies added a lovely color.
I found it a bit thick after the veggie addition so i added 1 cup plain yogurt.
At the end i also added 1 cup raisins 
and 1/2 cup sesame seeds Extra crunch and a bit of sweetness from the raisins.
Great recipe.

Good flavors, but HOT, HOT, HOT!!!  I omitted the chili and only used half the curry paste and it was still almost too spicy to eat.  Plus, watch out -- tumeric will stain your clothes!!!

Love it!!!  This recipe is similar to my mom's.  Recommend leaving out the shrimp. though.  For a great flavor to enhance the curry, try with cooked crumbled bacon on top, and serve over steamed Thai Jasmine rice!  Delicious!!!  Thanks so much for sharing it, my mother passed away when I was young, and I never did get the original recipe, this one is the most similar that I have found to date.  Krup Khun Ka!!!

Pretty good. Cheated massively by not pre-treating the beef (time reasons), just chucked it in and sauteed it with the garlic, onions etc. Didn't have dried shrimp, so substituted prawn paste which worked well, otherwise used ingredients specified - including red chilli pepper. Served with steamed rice and the whole lot went in minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

I have tried just about every curry recipe on this site and this is my favorite!  I did brown the beef (coated in a little soy sauce and flour) instead of boiling it for sake of time. I also omitted the shrimp because my wife doesn't like anything remotely fishy tasting. Still turned out fantastic! Goes great with some roti and basmati rice. But be forewarned, it is very spicy (like curry is supposed to be).

I didn't do the beef softening thing. Just browned the meat then included it in the sauce and simmered the whole thing for about 2 hours. Omitted the dried shrimp and the lemon grass but added a splash of soya sauce, squeeze of lemon juice & teaspoon of sugar for balance. The flavour was quite nice but the dish on a whole was too spicy. It could have been the red curry paste I used or because I cooked down the sauce over 2 hours. We like spicy foods but this was just too much!

This is the first recipe I've made from AR that I've not served.as I was making the dish, when I got to the tumeric, I thought no way this really calls for 3 Tablespoons. instead I added 1 1/2 TS and it was still offer powering. I tried to salvage the sauce but it was beyond my ability. We love Indian, Curry and spicey foods but this was terrible. if I did something incorrectly I wish I knew...

Very easy to put together.  Lots of flavor and was a hit with the family.  Served with rice and Naan.

For those who watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, this is literally milksteak. And it turned out exactly how I thought. Kinda dry, kinda bland. It was edible, but not great.

Despite the other reviews that said this was too spicy, I found it bland!  LOL.  I have never eaten this dish before, even in an Indian restaurant.  I like spicy food, and while the lack of heat is easy to remedy in any dish,  it just seemed to me that there was something else missing.  I don't know, maybe this is the way it is supposed to taste.  Not my cup of tea, sorry!

Made it as written minus the shrimp. Definitely would not skip the softening of the beef as it made it very tender. Next time I will add maybe some red bell pepper and green beans for a vegetable beef curry. Loved the spices! A definite keeper.
