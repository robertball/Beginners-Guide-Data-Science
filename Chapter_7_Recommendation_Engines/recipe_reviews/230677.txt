This is the best fondue with two changes - use Pizza Sauce instead of Spaghetti Sauce, and fry one pound of sausage, drain and add to the mixture before putting into your crockpot. I serve with toasted garlic bread cubes - delicious!! Everyone will gobble it up at your next party!

This was ok.  Made exactly was written and made in our fondue pot.  The Parmesan  cheese never incorporated into the sauce. It was kind of  "gritty".  Had a lot leftover.  The concept is good but we didn't love it as is.

I used half a teaspoon of garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I threw everything in my mini crockpot and let it go for a couple of hours, until it was heated through and the cheese was melted. I made a big loaf of garlic bread to dip alongside it. Not a bad snack, the littles seemed to enjoy it more than the adults did.

Took this to our weekly get together and it was a hit!  I used pizza sauce like one of the previous reviews suggested and I took pepperoni with us, in case someone wanted to skewer a pepperoni and then their bread, before dipping it in the sauce.  Super good!  I will be making this again!

Well, we did that in our class, it tested good.We added a little bit ground pepper,and squashes.We mde the shape of hedgehog, but that's too thick, that's the reason why surface of the break get part overcooked, but it was still not ripe inside of it.So, we know that we need take it more thin.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  The taste was good, but the cheese never melted, so it was not a smooth sauce. I used bakery Italian bread, it  got soggy; 'just not what I was expecting

I used Pastorelli brand canned pizza sauce, plus added 1 can of sliced, drained mushrooms that I sautéed with about 1/2 lb. of Italian sausage.   Baked in a glass casserole dish with 1/2 of the cheese mixed in, the other 1/2 baked on top till bubbly (around 25 mins. @ 350).  Just brought this to a work pot luck and it's a hit!

The mozzarella cheese never melted - I think it's because it was store bought shredded cheese so the anti-caking stuff they put on cheese may have been the cause.
