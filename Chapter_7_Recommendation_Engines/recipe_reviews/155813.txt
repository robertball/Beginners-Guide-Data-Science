This bread is the perfect combination of cinnamon and GOODNESS!!! The cream gives it a taste that you just don't find in regular recipes. If you don't have time to go the whole yeast bread route, you should seriously consider trying it with 2 rolls of biscuit dough, quarter them and roll into balls. Although the classic yeast bread makes it the best. ENJOY!

I made this using wheat flour instead of white and I skipped the cream, but it still turned out great!  It seemed that with wheat flour, the amount of flour used could be 3 1/2 to 4C, just in case anyone else wants to try them that way.

I make this all the time with frozen Bridgeford Dough. Turns out just as good.
