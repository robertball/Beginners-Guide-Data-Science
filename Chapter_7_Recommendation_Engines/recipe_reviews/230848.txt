LOVED LOVED LOVED the cabbage AND sauerkraut combo and the two mustard combo as well. If I had to make one change it would be to use sliced cheddar or Provolone in place of the Swiss since the Swiss is already in with the pastrami. I used turkey pastrami because that is all my deli had but I cannot wait to try this with beef pastrami. Again, I loved the two mustard/two cabbage combo in this. When I make this next and use beef pastrami I think I will add some sliced pepperoncini along with the onion on top. Great recipe!
