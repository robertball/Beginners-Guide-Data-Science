The first time I cook something I like to stay true to the chefs intent.  It helps me think what I might want to change or add.  I loved this soup.  It is exactly what Chef John said it was: comfort food.

Don’t care for the addition of red pepper flakes & Cayenne Pepper in this soup. Not what I’m used to. I like my Stracciatella more traditional with fresh spinach and herbs, but this is ok for an American/Italian version.

My daughter calls it tissue soup cause the egg when gathering looks like tissue.

Made this tonight for a light dinner. It really hit the spot.  I had some fresh spinach that needed using up, so added that before the cheese/egg mixture...had seen that in another stracciatella recipe. Also didn’t add seminola flour; it did really need it.  Added this to my Allrecipes favs.

Light & easy. Not too filling. Feed three people with leftovers for 2. Used canned broth. No problem.

I made this with home made broth and really enjoyed it. My only negative is that it makes far more than 2 servings.

I made this just as directed, and found it to be very flavorful. It was quick and easy to make and went perfect with a salad for a good light lunch. We love soup at our house, and this recipe is a keeper.

Forgot the red pepper flakes and nutmeg, but otherwise followed Recipe (doubled everything).  Used chef john’s homemade chicken broth recipe.  This Stracciatella was delicious, and enjoyed by the whole family.

Delicious and very easy.  I wasn't too sure, but I was looking for a soup to make that I had (most of) the ingredients on hand.  So glad I made it, it is a keeper.
