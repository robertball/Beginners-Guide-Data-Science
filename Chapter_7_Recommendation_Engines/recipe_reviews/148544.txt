This was some incredible BBQ with some incredibly nasty vinegar smell for the first 10 hours of cooking! Thank God we were taking the final product to someone else's house.  After the pork was drained, shredded and all the other ingredients got added the smell got a lot better.  All we added after that was 2-3 Tbsp. of liquid smoke which I highly recommend.  The end product tastes like something from a BBQ Smokehouse Restaurant.  I served this with Creamy Spiced Coleslaw and Sweet Cornbread from this site and it was gone in no time.  I can't wait to make this again.  We'll just be putting the slow cooker in the garage!

I have been making a version of this for over 20 years--to rave reviews.  I highly recommend adding a small amount (1/2 pound of so) of smoked picnic ham to the crock pot to convincingly fake that "pit cooked" flavor.  I also recommend using white vinegar, not cider vinegar.

Absolutely amazing! I am a displaced Tar Heel living in Alaska, and I would have NEVER thought that I could have North Carolina barbecue all the way up here without flying it in! I have tried lots of barbecue that has been touted as "NC barbecue," and have been disappointed every time.  This is it!  I made the recipe exactly as written for New Year's Day and was bowled over when I tasted it. It was 10 degrees below zero that day, but it felt like NC at the dinner table! Anyone who complains that cooking the pork in vinegar makes the house smell bad has never walked in from below zero temperatures to the aroma of Stamey's, Hursey's or Smithfield's! The only thing missing was the flavor that comes with slow smoking the pork, but I'll work on it.  What a holiday gift this was!!

Absolutely delicious! Yes, it does emit a strong smell of vinegar while cooking, but it's certainly worth it. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, however I cooked on high for 5 1/2 hours and it was just perfect. You can do this if you don't have the whole 12 hours to cook this in.

i set the crockpot and left for class.  i came home 3 hours later and was immediately transported back to NC (where I grew up).  I said, "mmmm, smells like bbq."  my husband said, "ugh, it smells like vinegar" (he's from Georgia)...but in the end, he said that it was the best I'd ever made.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

Wish I could rate this one higher than only 5 stars... yes, it's THAT good. I read several reviews and found an awful lot of whining about the vinegar smell, but honestly, I thought it smelled WONDERFUL! Be sure to add some Liquid Smoke... it is the ONLY thing missing from the recipe. For a 4 or 5 LB. pork roast, you'll want to add a couple of tablespoons of liquid smoke. Man oh man, I could eat this stuff all week. Make your favorite cole slaw recipe to top off the pork with and trust me, you will be smiling at the result.

Oh my goodness!  You hit the nail right on the head.  I am from eastern North Carolina  and grew up with pig pickin's.  What a shot of nostalgia with a fraction of the work.  I've made this several times, always with rave reviews.  The only complaint my husband and I have is the vinegary smell for 12 hrs.  But well worth the trade.  Excellent with "Dave's Coleslaw" from here!

The apple vinegar is the key to this recipe. I use a Boston Pork Butt, a cup of apple vinegar, and a 1/2 bottle of Stubbs Marinade. After 6 hours on high in the crock pot, I pull the meat and shred and put back in the pot. I then add a bottle of Doc Pierces BBQ sauce and cook on low for another two hours. It's like a party in your mouth. Very tasty. 5 STARS!!!!

This Yankee girl LOVES this recipe!  I was only acquainted with Carolina BBQ a few years ago and really liked it.  This recipe is perfect.  It is very spicy which I like, but be careful if serving to a crowd - especially like people in Minnesota who seem to prefer things very bland.  Put some of this on a yummy bun, add a little cole slaw and it's an immediate picnic.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

As suggested by others I added liquid smoke to the cooking liquid. I also added sliced onions (2 small - will add more next time. They retain the vinegar zing and add to the flavor).

The other change I made was reducing the leftover liquid to almost a syrup which really concentrated the flavor then adding it to the pulled pork. Next time I'll add about 1 cup unreduced liquid to the pulled pork, reduce the rest and add to the pulled pork.

I made this yesterday.  It made this former Eastern Carolinian drool with anticipation and scored well on the West Coast family level.
As good as any I've ever had at a restaurant and being a retired chef, I've had my share.
Great stuff, easy to make, just like "home".

This is my favorite recipe on this site! I love the Carolina style BBQ sandwich with coleslaw. I do vary the cooking time and how long I keep it cooking on Low/High - it just depends on how long I have to let it cook. I also add a few tablespoons of liquid smoke along with the other spices, but those are the only differences. Thank you for posting!! I can't wait for dinner tonight. : )

I ave this 4 stars because it needs some smoke product added to make it 5 stars. I made 1/2 of the recipe. I used 1 tsp smoked salt instead of regular and also some smoked paprika (about 1/2 t.) and a splash of ponzu to the vinegar and lots of ground pepper. I cooked the pork the first day, then put the shredded meat in a separate bowl from the strained cooking liquid and put them in the fridge overnight so I could skim off the fat and measure out 1 cup (I made 1/2 the recipe) from the clear middle part without fat or the scummy precipitate at the bottom. Then I combined the liquids, nuked it all to start it cooking and mixed it together back in the crockpot. I think I cooked it too long the second time as it tasted better right after I first mixed it than it did 6 hours later. Next time I will add the smoked stuff to the hot sauce mixture instead of to the vinegar on the first day because it lost too much of the flavor during cooking. It really does taste as close to real East Carolina BBQ as you'll get with a slow cooker.

Coming from an eastern Tarheel and one who makes the trek from central VA straight down I-95 to Carolina for the sole purpose of purchasing BBQ,  this recipe is very true to the real deal and brings back many memories of home.  It's the only way to go with homestyle Carolina BBQ!  This is as good as it gets.

My family loves this and I've had several requests for the recipe.  It's even better when you add liquid smoke to the sauce.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!! It is soooooo good!!!!! I was craving some pulled pork sandwhiches for a few days so I decided I was making them for dinner and the store just so happen to have boneless pork shoulder roast on sale ( I hate touching any meat with bones). I pretty much followed the recipe other then using the boneless roast I added onion powder and garlic salt and I used sea salt because it's what I had on hand. The only other change I made was putting Liquid smoke in with the vineger. I didn't put the cayenne or red pepper in because my little girl was going to be eating it and I didn't want it to spicy for her. I will be making this recipe a lot now. We are having left overs for either luch or dinner or possibly both!

Wow!  We cook dinner almost every night and I have never had a better reaction from my husband.  This is really NC style pulled pork.  If someone told me I could make something this great in my kitchen I would have never believed them in a million years.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

This is soo easy and yummy!! I used a 2.5 lb boneless pork blade roast, on high in the crock pot for 4 hours. It turned out beautiful. I was trying to shred it and found myself grabbing 'bites' to sample all along the way. Only thing I did differently was add just a few drops of liquid smoke (as per another reviewer saying it needs a ham hock for some smoky flavor), and used white vinegar instead of apple cider (cuz thats all I had). Combined with the recipe on this site for 'Restaurant-Style Cole Slaw I', we have a winning combination. I am so impressed...thank you, thank you!!

I had been looking for a good pulled pork recipe that wasn't heavy on BBQ sauce and this was it.  I did read all of the reviews and took it all into account.  For the slow cooker process, I did use apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of hickory liquid smoke, 1 tablespoon of sea salt and pepper.  That cooked on low for 12 hours.  It is true, that for the first little while, there is a strong vinegar smell.  Don't let that discourage you, because as it cooks longer and the juice from the meat mixes with it, it just starts to smell really delicious.  Once it was shredded, I did some adjustments with the spices also, as I didn't want to overdo it with the heat.  I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and 1 tablespoon red hot sauce.  My husband loves the taste of this.  We are looking forward to having it tonight in rolls with cole slaw.

I was born & raise in the Carolinas & this recipe was so close to that pig cooking i remember. My family Loved it! Will add the liquid smoke next time. I think that is all its missing.(the reason I gave it 4 stars) The coleslaw helped calm down the spice and it tasted perfect! I used my slow cooker on high for 6 hrs for a 3.5 lb boneless pork shoulder roast. The apple cider vinegar did not stink up my house, btw. I never noticed it. I think sourkraut smells worse!! Anyways, After I pulled apart the meat & stirred in the sauce mixtures, it was juicy & so delicious!

Definitely an Eastern NC BBQ girl.  None of that Lexington **** for me!  This recipe is a revelation.  OF COURSE ideally you smoke it, low, slow, and outside... but if you have a townhouse, this works out okay.  

It does smell like vinegar - but it smells enough like BBQ that we didn't mind at all.  I think that if you have never had this style of barbeque before, you'd definitely notice it.

Only one change - halved the amount of cayenne pepper.  Used Texas Pete as the hot sauce.  

Delicious!  Can't say that enough.

New notes 06Apr2014:  The 2 Tablespoons liquid smoke are a great addition.  Please do NOT use a skin-on pork butt - it's just too fatty for this.  I ended up having to waste a lot of pork because the crock pot was doing some rendering but not enough.

This was awesome with the exception that it was too hot.  Next time I will leave out the cayenne.  It made the house stink like vinegar but it was definitely worth it.  I was born and raised in NC and it is fairly close to what I grew up eating.  Yum!

Loved this!  It took care of my Carolina pulled pork craving!  I followed the recipe, although I used a rib-in cut that the butcher recommended.  I found that, when the meat finished cooking and I had shredded it, it was really juicy and tender.  I made the sauce, but kept it separate for those who wanted a more spicy pork.  My choice was to make a sandwich with the pork and some homemade coleslaw and dip the sandwich in the sauce as I ate it.  FABULOUS!

OMG...how good!  My husband is a North Carolinian originally and living in Pennsylvania, he always says it's hard to get real Carolina BBQ here.  I made this for him this weekend and he was impressed.  He's asking for it again!

This is a great way to make pulled pork in the winter time. I really like the bite of Carolina pulled pork, but my husband likes the sweet barbecue sauces of the midwest. I compromised with this recipe. I cooked the pork according to the recipe and then added a cup of Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce to the shredded pork before serving. It was very good and my husband said he would definitely eat this again.

We made this for a tailgate party and it was a hit! We followed other reviewers suggestion to add liquid smoke and it tasted like we had bbq'ed it all day. We are making it again for our next BBQ. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really very good. I used a smaller pork butt (3.5 lbs) so I decreased the vinegar to 1 cup, and put the cooker outside becuase it does smell bad. I wish I would have used liquid smoke in the cooker; next time I will.

I am from South Carolina and this is just like the BBQ we have back home. I made it for our New Year's meal and it was delicious. I did add 1 TBS liquid smoke as per the other reviewers' suggestion. This one is a keeper!

I made this when company came to visit and I got nothing but rave reviews! I only put half the amount of hot sauce that was suggested just because I was scared of overwhelming my guests. Next time I will use the full amount because the kick wasn't strong enough for me with only the half amount. The hardest part of this recipe is shredding the cut of meat. We had enough left overs for another full dinner later in the week. It reheated well too.

I have a different recipe for North Carolina BBQ that I like much better.  In the end, I added regular old bbq sauce (i.e. turning it into something completely different) to this to make it enjoyable.

Glorious!!!  I love this recipe, I've made it at least 5 times now and my guests always rave about it.  I love it as a sandwich; pork, coleslaw, on a King's Hawaiian roll, yum!  Yes it smells a little funny cooking and yes it's not quite the same as bbq from a fire but that's the beauty of it.  We all have a slow cooker, no one has a fire pit. :)

Fantastic.  Two tips: you probably don't need this much salt - it was a bit too much for us.  And I added a heavy dash of liquid smoke - definitely worth it.  My sons asked me to make this for dinner every night, so you know it must be good.

I too am from NC and love the BBQ there. Living in Chicago I have to say they have a lot of unique food here, deep dish pizza and beef sandwiches to name a couple but the BBQ is just imported ST. Louise style. Sweet, heavy sauce that smothers the pork rather than enhancing it like NC 'Q. To get that pig pickin' smoke flavor I added smoked paprika to the rub and let set over night in the fridge. Also used an injector to put about half a cup of the apple cider vinegar into the pork shoulder at that time as well. I thought about putting liquid smoke in that also but decided to wait until the final mix to use it if desired. Just a dash is all it needs in my opinion. Sheer bliss in a very much missed comfort food from my youth. I also bring back a bottle of Texas Pete everytime I visit family back in the old north state. Love, love, LOVE this recipe.

This recipe is great!!!  As close to North Carolina BBQ as you are going to get.  I made this and put it on mini party rolls for NC pork bbq sliders for a party and everyone loved them!  I make this once a month, have it for dinner and put the leftovers in a large zip lock bag and flatten it out and freeze it.  Any time I want a sandwich, I break a piece off, 2 min in the microwave, add a little red onion, pickle, couple of shots of Franks Red hot or Stubbs BBQ sauce  - perfect!

Let me start with I love spicy food.  However I followed the driections closely and found it was way too hot. I did add more brown sugar which calmed it down a bit.

Fantastic! I took a leap of faith trying this because nice pork is hard to find where I live but I was greatly rewarded for following the recipe and just adding the liquid smoke per other reviewers suggestions. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Outstanding! I like pulled pork and I like non-bland food, this was such a good recipe. I think it is easily the best thing I have ever made in a crockpot. Thank you for sharing this! I read through the reviews and, while following the recipe exactly, I also added 2 TBSP of liquid smoke when I added the other ingredients. Seriously, so good ... writing this in the morning and think I may have just another pinch (don't think I can wait til dinner).

Have been searching for a restaurant that serves Carolina BBQ in Dallas, Texas . . . you can imagine that I have had very little luck.  Found this recipe - now the best place in Dallas for Carolina BBQ is my kitchen . . . tastes so good!  I added 2 T of liquid smoke as others suggested (Hickory flavor).  Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this yesterday hoping for left overs for a couple days. Hubby polished this off this afternoon.  With homemade coleslaw you can't go wrong with this recipe.  Easy, delicious and dreamy!!  I ended up using some white sugar instead of the brown sugar and it was pretty good. next time will try the brown sugar. The only thing I did different was I did add chicken stock to the vinegar and I used a 7.5 lb fresh picnic ham (same thing?).

Without the liquid smoke...4 stars.  With liquid smoke...5 stars all the way.  I made 2 batches with the first following the recipe exactly and the second adding the liquid smoke.  Only one Tbsp is needed.  It is a delightful recipe.  We live in VA...and my husband grew up in NC.  This is dead on bbq.  I will never use a different bbq recipe again.  And, fyi, I didn't mind the smell in the house...and I have the most sensitive of noses.  Perhaps it is because I enjoy the vinegar bbq so much? Yum!

In a word, YUM!  I feel very accomplished having made my first batch of pulled pork/bbq from a pork shoulder!  Recipe was very easy to follow, and I loved the "saucelessness" taste of the meat as I am not a drenched-in-sauce kind of person.  In any case, I used at 3.5 pork shoulder roast and let it cook 10 hours, then sit in the warm crockpot for about 1.5 hours before adding the sauce to it.  Had no cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes, so added a bit more hot sauce.  Will definitely make again!

This is quite good.  I was craving barbecue (impossible to do in Wisconsin in January!) and decided to give this a try.  I added liquid smoke but otherwise followed the recipe.  The meat was very tender, and the liquid smoke is the crowning touch.  We enjoyed this, and it's going in the keeper file.

As good as BBQ can be in a slow cooker. Have tried many recipes, and a slow cooker, just doesn't add the same pizazz as a fire.

I LOVE this recipe. It is great vinegar style BBQ, super easy to make, and has gotten rave reviews every time I have made it. I live in NC where people are used to good BBQ on every corner so if these connoisseurs enjoy this BBQ, you know it must be good. I cut the spices in half after the first time i made it because it was too hot for my taste. I also have used half apple cider vinegar and half white vinegar sometimes when i don't have enough of ACV. It tastes great both ways. I've done it for 12 hours on low or 6 hours on high and it works great both ways. I'm about to make this for a fifth time tomorrow for a BBQ contest at work!

This was delicious but you really need to slow cook it for 8-12 hours, and the odor is really obnoxious. Several residents in our building complained. I promised I wouldn't make it again.

Very good. I think cooking in vinegar makes a big difference. It's quite spicy, but delicious.

Looking for that perfect pulled pork BBQ, I read the reviews on this and tried it.  In my opinion, its good, but not great.  Didnt seem to have much flavor, just bland.  Ill have to keep looking for a better recipe.

This is the recipe to make if you are a true Eastern North Carolina person.  The vinegar makes the BBQ, so no complaints about the vinegar smell.   I made one small adjustment to make it a little leaner and that was to make it with a 2.5 pd  Pork Lion Roast and removed the fat before I pulled it apart.  Adjust your seasonings accordingly and get that coleslaw ready for your great tasting BBQ.   Of course, now after eating it I wish I had made some more BBQ, but even the 2.5 pound produced enough meat for about 6-7 servings.

I just don't get the amount of vinegar...the smell was so unappealing. I didn't dislike the finished product, but it definitely wasn't something any of us thoroughly enjoyed and I will not make again.

This was delicious!  Exactly what I had in mind; tangy, tender barbecue.  My very picky husband raved.  Plus- it was a piece of cake to make.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours and it was perfect.  I will absolutely make this again.

This recipe took me back to my eastern NC roots.  Very good and so easy.  The only change I made was to add 1 T. of liquid smoke.  That gave it the pit cooked flavor I was used to.  Cole slaw and baked beans complete the perfect comfort food meal.

My entire family loved this one.  I didn't cut down on the spices as some of the other reviewers did since we like spicy foods in my family, but if you are sensitive, you might want to.  We loved it just the way it is.  In fact, I have already cooked up several batches of this and divided into family-sized portions, put in the FoodSaver bags, and froze.  It thaws very well after being frozen and made for an awesome work-night meal.  I highly recommend this one - thank you so much!

Yummy!  I mixed half of the meat with the sauce and ate the other half with regular bbq sauce for the kids.  Both were delicious.  Will definitely make again.

My husband is a Eastern Carolina BBQ junkie and now believes I make the best BBQ ever. :)  I did change the recipe a bit though. I used half white vinegar and half apple cider. Then when I was making the sauce I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to punch the vinegar back up since we really love vinegar. Splitting the apple cider with white vinegar at the beginning allows me to add new apple cider vinegar into the sauce without it being overwhelmed with apple cider. I am not really explaining this well, but it is amazing.

My husband adores this recipe! He is from SC :o) This does make your house smell kind of bad while it's cooking but the taste is more than worth it! Followed the recipe exactly except for creole seasoning instead of red pepper and used the recommendation for Texas Pete hot sauce!

This is a really good Carolina BBQ recipe. I have made several slow cooker recipes for Carolina BBQ, only to end up disappointed. This one was not one of those my husband even liked it and he is a picky eater. I did add a little extra apple vinegar at the end and let it cook for an extra hour after shredding the meat so it could soak up the seasonings. I will definitely be keeping this recipe. Thanks!

The meat turned out very tender.  We served with bar-b-que sauce.  It tasted very good.   I did have one very negative comment though.  Cooking this meat in the vinegar made the whole house smell bad - really bad. Next time, I'll put the slow cooker in the garage.

I am from NC, but live overseas and i had a craving for NC vinegar based pulled pork. Not only did myself and my family love it, but my neighbors from NC loved it as well!  The only thing i changed was i added some liquid smoke to give it a nice smokey flavor. This is a keeper for sure !

I've made this recipe 2 or 3 times and we love it! I grew up on Bullocks in Durham and Wilbur's in Goldsboro - legendary eastern carolina barbecue restaurants. Made it for my parents and they were impressed. I use boneless country style ribs and serve with a coleslaw recipe from this site (Creamy Cole Slaw or something like that. )  both on a bun of course. I did just notice today that you're supposed to add the brown sugar and other ingredients towards the end.....oops. I always put it all in together at the start and it works :) looking forward to having it tonight!

Best pulled pork I've had and easy to make. I made some modifications due to having a family who does not like "spicy" or strong flavored. I used distilled white vinegar (I know, I know) but the cooking scent and the flavor was more mild. I also left out the cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and crushed red pepper. I used a tad of smokey Hungarian paprika instead.

This came out great. I too added the liquid smoke and loved the flavor. I tasted the pork as I was shredding it and what a big difference after it cooked another hour! I may consider adding more heat next time I make this. I will pair this with my home made coleslaw recipe I found here.

OK...This Texas BBQ girl was looking for something different. We own a ranch...and BBQ is our thing.  There sat my biggest critics...dad and hubby.  They hated the smell...hated everything about what I was doing.  UNTIL...they took a bite.  They laughed.  Not bad...and told me to give it 5 stars and make it again. These Texas boys were hooked on some "northern" BBQ.  You HAVE to add the liquid smoke...or it isn't worth eating.  I added probably 4 or more tablespoons for a 4 pound pork.  I also made it with white vinegar and cooked on high for 6 hours. Enjoy...even if you're from the BBQ wild west of Texas...it's good!!!!

Being from the Midwest we were always using Sweet Baby Ray's. After trying the pork I ended up using it on this recipe.  I know it's a regional thing and everyone is raving about it, but I guess it's just not for me.

Just cooked a 9-1/2 shoulder for a crowd:  used a large deep roasting pan in the oven at 300.  Substituted balsamic for the cider vinegar.  Just call it Carolina/Virginia/Dakota barbeque I guess.  Deeeeelish and it smelled wonderful all day.

OH MY GOSH!! I just made this & with some changes I rate it 6 stars!! I used a pork loin roast,was what I had on hand,about 2 1/4 pounds.So I reduced the ingredients a bit to accommodate the smaller size.I used  3/4 cup apple cider vinegar.1 tsp salt & a generous dashing of black pepper.Instead of waiting until the end to add the spicy ingredients,I thought,"wouldn't it taste even better if they were cooked in at the beginning?" So I added about 1 Tsp red cayenne pepper sauce,1/2 Tbs red pepper flakes & a good splash or two of Texas Pete Hot pepper sauce(Tabascos in vinegar),We aren't able to eat very spicy hot things so I had to tone it down for us.I let all that cook for 5 hours on high.It tasted good enough to Me just after shredding it!! But I went ahead & added 1 1/2 Tbs of the brown sugar to 3/4 cup reserved liquid.Added a few more red pepper flakes,less than 1/4 cup more vinegar to boost the flavor a bit more,and another splash of the Tabasco. All in the crock pot until my husband gets home,working late tonight.I think he will be amazed we have fresh pulled pork BBQ at home!! We are always going from place to place here in NC trying to decide which place has the best BBQ & now I will not have to go anywhere!!Good ol' Carolina BBQ!!!Right here at home!!I'm SO excited!!

Made this for Easter for the 1st time. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. I followed the recipe as written, with the following exceptions: (i) I added two (2) tablespoons of Wright's "Applewood" Liquid Smoke. (ii) Rather than pour off the excess liquid, I boiled down the liquid to concentrate the flavor. Rather than serve the pulled pork on buns, I made waffles. I started by dicing a pound of applewood smoked bacon and sauteed the diced bacon in a cast iron skillet until crispy. For each waffle, I sprinkled some of the crispy bacon onto the waffle iron prior to pouring the batter. Onto the bacon waffle, I ladled a generous portion of pulled pork, and covered the pork with cole slaw. Most of the guests ate it open faced; but a few ate it like a taco. It was superb.

Unbelievable! I wish I had found this recipe 22 years ago when I moved from North Carolina to Minnesota! How could you not love the smell of vinegar while this delicacy is cooking? I'm with the others... adding about 5 tablespoons of Liquid Smoke really makes it taste like home!

Used a 4 QT slow cooker and while there was ample room I would highly recommend cutting the cider vinegar in half.  There was no need for this much vinegar and during the night it floated the pork butt pushing the lid off.  Used a 5.5 lb pork butt.  In the end the taste was okay.  Made this for my father-in-law who was raised on Carolina BBQ and he enjoyed mroe than I did.

Being from the Carolinas, now living in Germany, we have been trying to find a recipe that could give us a little taste of home.  This is it!!!  With a little slaw, Baked beans and hushpuppies, we were at home!  Thanks so much for sharing.

As others have stated, this is delicious but the odor is "really obnoxious"- we have an outside kitchen and place the crock pot outside. If we had to cook it inside, I doubt if I would cook it again.

This recipe was so easy, and so delicious!  My husband and I are both NC natives, so we tend to be pretty picky about bbq- but this tasted just like the real deal.  I can't wait to make it again!

This was fabulous!  I added liquid smoke and didn't have any cayenne...but it turned out to be  exactly what I wanted.  It was so good I was really ashamed to put store bought coleslaw on it.  I'll make homemade next time.  Thanks!

This was, quite possibly, the best dinner I have ever made.  I added a tiny dab of liquid smoke when I put the pork in the apple cider vinegar and I didn't have a problem with the smell at all while it cooked.  I loved it!  I can't wait to make it again!

I just made this and it is incredible!!!  I'm so proud of myself!  I made some fresh coleslaw with the food processor to go on the sandwich and it was awesome!  A hint on the coleslaw:  I used the new Kraft Chipotle mayo.  That gave the whole sandwich a bit more of a smoky flavor!  Lots of heat in this dish, but so good!

First off, I put the slow cooker in the garage due to other reviews I had read about the smell, and glad I did. I added the following to the original recipe, Liquid Smoke, Texas Pete's hot sauce and a bit more pepper. Turned out great, very easy to shred.

This was good, but not spectacular.  I was hoping for something a little saucier.  However, the pork was very tender and had a nice kick.  I served it on a bun with the "Sweet Restaurant Slaw" from this site.  The slaw really balanced out the flavors from the pork and made for a tasty sandwich.

My husband is from south carolina. I suprised him one day when he came home from work and smelled that vinegar smell. He was all over this dinner, he said it brought back memories of old time mom and pop diners where they keep this on the back burner for a pork sandwich. I was dubious about the vinegar as I  never used it much for cooking. Expect a strong vinegar scent to permeate the house, but it is quite tasty and even better the next day:)

Excellent BBQ! I added 2 TBSP of liquid smoke to the apple cider vinegar and reduced the amount of the "hot" ingredients by half. It still had a good kick without being overwhelming.  Be sure to strain the cooked liquid several times before adding rest of ingredients.

I grew up eating pork roast and never had it made like this, so I was a little nervous about trying this.  The pork was so good!  The vinegar really tenderizes the meat and the flavor is amazing as well.  I made it for dinner with my friends and we all really enjoyed it.

i thought this was great and super easy.  will definitely make again when i need to feed a bunch of people with minimal effort.  this was different than your traditional pulled pork...it has a bit of heat and a bit of tang.  ate on an onion bun with a side of seasoned fries.  thanks for the recipe.

Hats off to the chef!! My husband is native to North Carolina. I'm a Texas gurl. He likes his type of BBQ and I like mine. Since we have moved to Texas, he misses his good ole home style BBQ. I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out perfect (he said). Now I can make "his" BBQ whenever he wants.

I'm from NC and can say how hard it is to find good Carolina BBQ.  (I've been looking for years) This is as close to perfect as you can get without the cooker and the whole pig!!  1st time I did add a smidge of liquid smoke, this time I'm throwing in some smoked hocks yummy!!!!  Can't thank you enough for sharing this recipie. My husband says it's better than any we've purchased at the store.  :)

Fantastic recipe!  I made this for a Sunday gathering and everyone went crazy for it!  I found mine was ready to be strained and pulled apart after 10 & 1/2 hours.  I then added the remaining ingredients and cooked on low for 1 more hour.  I also found that 1 to 1 & 1/2 cups of reserved liquid was enough.  This recipe is very easy to follow and works great for medium sized hungry groups!

Easy and delicious NC BBQ.  I am not too fond of BBQ with red sauces.  This lets the flavor of the pork shine through the sauce.  It has a sneaky bite too.  I generally use ghost pepper hot sauce and reduce the amount in half.

My house didn't smell like vinegar, it smelled like NC BBQ!  No substitutions.  Will make again, maybe with a smaller dose of brown sugar. (personal preference)

This is great, but I did things a little different.  I felt like cooking this in a slow cooker only would not give you any of those crispy bits you find in real bbq.  So, I put the pork roast, whole and unseasoned on the grill first at high heat with a smoker box with hickory chips.  I seared all sides about 15 minutes until the outside was crisp with some slight charring.  Then I moved it to the slow cooker for several hours with the liquids and seasonings specified in the recipe.  After pulling it apart, it seemed to be missing something.  I added a few drops of liquid hickory smoke and let it go on low for another hour.  The end results was absolutely superb.  Just like the bbq I get in Greensboro when I'm there.   Highly recommended!

Cooked this all day...kids were excited, BUT WAY TO SPICY for children. I LOVE spicy, but this is like a 3 am drunk and munchie kind of spicy!  The kind of spicy you don't care about since you're drunk

Real close copy to Carolina pulled pork.  Only things I did differently is add some liquid smoke at the beginning and also to the left over cooking liquid and add about 1/4 cup cider vinegar to finish the sauce

I thought this was good and had the flavors of NC, but found it to be a little bland. I expected more heat and vinegar flavor. It was just missing something but can't place what. When I try it again, I'll try the liquid smoke others recommend, maybe that will help. All in all, an easy recipe I'll keep around.

We LOVED this recipe and are making it again this weekend. Some people said it makes your house smell strongly of vinegar, but I didn't think it was a problem. I highly recommend trying this BBQ folks. It's delicious and we ate every last bit. YUM!

My husband is from the SC low country and has introduced me to vinegar based barbecue. This is the first crockpot barbecue recipe I have tried and I have to say, look no further!!! As soon as it started heating up that vinegar smelled just like the roadside joints we have visited. Here are the few adjustments I made: a few dashes of liquid smoke added to vinegar during cooking process, I used much less hot sauce and cayenne than recipe called for and opted for lots of black pepper instead. I saved all the cooking liquid to make the sauce because it's great for added to reheated meat. Can't wait for dinner!

I made this recipe the first time in a slow cooker it was awesome. I recently purchased a electric pressure cooker seared the pork roast on all sides for 5 minutes. I added 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke. Then cook in the pressure cooker for 2hrs. This was beyond awesome, it taste like authentic Carolina barbecue.

I've made this twice now. Love!!! Followed the recipe to the T secind time after only altering quantities based on size of cut the first time. More vinegar is better I've learned! I put a 4.5lb boston butt both times in the crockpot on low overnight and set on low next morning til lunchtime to shred. Pros: SUPER easy. Not even 5min prep time plus 10 shredding and taste testing. Set on warm during the morning while chasing the toddler around. Came out super tender when i could shred around noon. Cons: not as vinegary as I would like. Simple solution: added more vinegar when placing shredded pork back to crockpot. Delicious! I didnt get a bad vinegar smell at all, either way vinegar smell doesnt bother me.  Highly recommend!

Being from the Midwest and currently living in Florida, I fell in love with the pulled pork in North Carolina while visiting family. I have never had anything like it! I have tried several recipes in an attempt to replicate it and this is very, VERY close! The smell as this is cooking is AMAZING and my husband actually says mine is BETTER than our favorite restaurant there! I am not one that likes spicy stuff but, this is amazing. The flavors seem to set in more the next day so be careful when testing it. Also, you can make this and freeze it very easily and it heats up and tastes just as great as when it was first made. I can't say enough good things about this recipe!

I've made this a number of times, and it is one of my favorites. The addition of liquid is smoke is highly recommended.  Make a batch of coleslaw and mustard paint and you have one good sandwich.  I cook mine 8 hrs on low, I find 12 hrs is a bit long.

This was my first try at slow cooker bar-b-q, and it was a great hit  As we are seniors, I did cut the cayenne and red pepper flakes to 1 tsp and omitted the hot sauce, figured those that needed more spice could add the hot sauce.  Served with slaw and bake beans...yum.  thanks for the great recipe!!

Easy to make and EXCELLENT taste!!!! I was born and raised in Raleigh, NC and grew up eating Eastern NC BBQ; which does NOT use smoke flavor and is indeed heavy on the vingegar. I now live in Charlotte where the BBQ is quite different-- though still yummy. We have many, MANY regional variations of BBQ in NC and this recipe is definitely eastern NC. This recipe is great and truly tastes like some of the famous eastern bbq places like Bullocks in Durham, NC

This was a great recipe! I may back off of the crushed red pepper a tad next time. Also, not having liquid smoke, I used smoked paprika which worked wonderfully.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good NC style pulled pork. 
If I had spent eight hours tending to a hot smoker, it may have turned out a bit better, but for what it is, it is excellent and so easy.  No, the vinegar smell never bothered me or my family at all.  I will definitely do it again.

It grew on us as we ate the left overs.  You HAVE TO like vinegar for this to even be an option. The smell while cooking didnt bother us we did the cook on high for 5 hours method, plenty moist and all the way cooked, so no worries there. Did add some liquid smoke for smokey flavor. I made a sweet slaw recipe, a copy cat KFC one that really made the sandwich work. Im so glad I took the time to prepare the slaw because without it, it may not have been as good.

I bought all the ingredients listed above, added some Liquid Smoke (thanks to another reviewer), cole slaw and large seeded buns and went to town.  Holy cow!  It wasn't quite Smithfield's or Holy Smokes, but it was as close as I could have hoped and makes me very, very happy!  Now I think I need a much larger slow cooker, more pork shoulder, and everything will be all right with the world.  Very grateful for this recipe.  I'll be using it very often, with Carolina on my mind.

i absolutely LOVED this recipe.  It's not the same as smoked BBQ but you knew that!  I read some reveiws where they added some liquid smoke and I was going to do that because I thought that bottle in the back of my spice cabinet was liquid smoke (not!!).
I took this to work potluck and the crock pot was practically licked clean.  
For the people who had an overwhelming vinegar smell - did you use distilled vinegar maybe?  You have to use Apple Cider vinegar - my house smelled amazing.
I cooked about a 7 - 7/12 pound pork shoulder (1 & 1/2 times the other ingredients) and my roast was pull-apart tender at about the 8 hour mark.  I chopped my BBQ because that's just the way I like.  I served it with slider buns and coleslaw - YUM.  
I'm thinking about making this for super bowl

I live in NC and this is pretty  close to what I do accept the sauce. There has to be ketchup,white sugar,garlic&onion powder added to the listed ingredients for this recipe. Then you will have your perfect Carolina BBQ sauce folks! I love doing the pork in the crock , which is something I had never done. It came out so tender. I suggest for your slaw, keep it simple. Shredded cabbage ( use the head not the pre shred because that is so dry) mayo ( must be dukes) salt&pepper and SUGAR to taste. ( add small amounts at a time)plus a dash of yellow mustard. Enjoy.

This recipe makes excellent BBQ, but I would recommend using 1/3 to 1/2 of the cayenne and crushed red pepper...even with this much pepper it has quite a bit of kick to it.

Great recipe. This made my Tarheel husband so happy! What a great way to have awesome BBQ in the comfort of our own home.  We made some red slaw to go with it and were instantly transported across the miles to The Old North State.  Thanks!

We've made this 3 times this summer.  Hubby keeps inviting friends over for dinner so he can have more Carolina BBQ!  It is a hit with everyone.

Great recipe. Since I live in NC, I just buy Scott's BBQ sauce at the grocery store and use it, since it already includes the vinegar and peppers. Also, when I put the pork in the crockpot I add some Liquid Smoke for that hickory taste.

I would have rated this 5 stars but for that I had to cut the hot peppers in half. Otherwise, loved the fact that this bbq was light weight and not like some of those heavy sauce you buy in the bottle. I made the creamy cole slaw on this site and it was great on it.

This is amazing!  I added 2 tbs liquid smoke after reading the reviews and prepared it exactly as written except I had to freeze it for three days after the liquid was removed etc.  Still came out perfect when I put it back in the slow cooker on high for about an hour.  Four Northern men (Canadians) loved it.  I can't wait to serve it to a southern woman next.  
I love this website!

Woo-Wee……this is some delicious BBQ, Carolina style!  I followed the directions as stated only using a pork loin rather than a bone-in pork shoulder roast because I had the loin in the freezer.  I prepped the meat and put the Crockpot in the garage.  I knew with 1 ½ cups of vinegar the smell would be very strong.  I put this on in the evening so it could cook all night.  In the morning, it was ready to shred.  I then proceeded with the rest of the recipe/ingredients.  I then cooled the meat, put in the fridge to be served the next day.  The next day, I reheated on the stovetop.  This meat is delicious.  I worried about the “heat” after reading other reviews.  It does have a kick to it, so back off on the spices if spicy is not your thing.  I prepared cole slaw for those that wanted to add it to their sandwiches.   I served this with ‘Macaroni Salad Virginia Style’ from AR.  We had a great meal, and one I most definitely will be making again.  Glad I have 2 more loins in the freezer.

I have tried MANY recipes and this one is hands down the best! I live on the N.C./Va. border and people here are really particular about their pork bbq. I have made this on many occasions and always get rave reviews.

I'm giving this only 3 stars since this was  too spicy for me. Very easy to do and pork came out nice and moisture, but.......yikes, those red pepper flakes were over the top for me. My boyfriend and his son enjoyed it. Only thing, took 10.5 hours for pork to fall apart.

My family loved this recipe.  We did add a good amount of Liquid Smoke and used a little less of the hot spices.  It worked for us.  Plus, our house smelled good when it was cooking.

Woah...this was surprisingly really good.  I followed the recipe almost to a "T" (adding a little extra pepper/salt/red pepper flake).  As others have stated, as the vinegar heats up the smell is, as hubby puts it, RANCID.  I LOVE vinegar flavor but the smell especially warm is pretty bad.  However, I did follow the instructions and once I strained the pork and added the spices, the smell was pretty good.  The pork turned out moist and flavorful especially the next day. Husband said it was even better after being in the fridge overnight.  I'm not a "tarheel" (not even sure of what that is) but this was really tasty and a definite keeper.  I wonder what the flavor would be changing up the vinegar for like pomegranate vinegar or um, red wine vinegar?  One other small change I made, I let it cook on low for 4 hours then on high for 2 and again on low for 2 during the add spices and such.  12 hours is kinda long and after trimming the fat and such, I'm sure it wound up 5lbs or less (originally 7lbs).

Made this today and I have to say my husband and I love that vinegar smell! Although my family is from NC so go figure just smells like BBQ to me but I can see how it would be overwhelming to others.  But man this is good followed the recipe exactly with the addition of a tablespoon of liquid smoke per other reviewers and my after working all day outside this was a great treat with some green apple coleslaw that I got from a different website.

I'm a Yankee, born and bred, but IMO, THIS is what barbeque should be!!!  OK, I know that there are those who will debate this, but I've traveled a lot, eaten a lot of BBQ from all around the country and to me, Eastern NC BBQ, with the wonderful vinegar tang, is just "it."  And this is one of the best recipes out there - and certainly the easiest!  Agree with other posters that a little liquid smoke only improves the flavor, but it's still delicious as written.  Oh man, now my mouth is watering again - looks like my crockpot is going to be busy again this weekend!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe and so do my family and friends!  It is simple to make, with a small ingredient list - yet has rich full flavors.  Instead of Tabasco, I add a red pepper chili sauce for spice and it is perfect.

Wow, this turned out awesome. I don't live in NC but have family who live there, and when I was younger we always had NC bbq when we visited. It was always a highlight of the trip. So now that I can make it, it brings back all those great memories. Delicious, and so close to the authentic bbq it's amazing. I made an 8 lb roast but followed the rest as described. The only thing I probably will change next time is to ease up on one of the spices, perhaps the cayenne. But that's just personal preference. It was so close to the real thing, I'm still amazed. Everyone else raved about it too. Thank you so much!

LOVE this recipe.  Reminds me of when I lived in North Carolina!  Granted I'm from the Chicago area and may not "know bbq", but I know this taste awesome.  MUST top with slaw to get the true carolina flare!

Great recipe and the pork really turned out nice in the crock pot. We did one thing different though and browned the meat on the grill with a salt and pepper rub.  Cooked all day and even my wife who's from Carteret County, NC enjoyed it.

I won't touch anything but Carolina vinegar BBQ-the kind you get at Smithfield's and this is the closest you will find online. I finally printed the recipe and also saved it to my recipe box so I won't lose it again! IMHO, the vinegar smell is not as unpleasant as some stated. In fact it makes my mouth water with anticipation!

Made this yesterday and it was WONDERFUL.  Live in Upstate NY and I felt like I was back in NC.  The liquid smoke really is the topper on the cake.
Can't wait to make it again.

I cooked the meat yessterday and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I made the sauce this morning-my husband & I really like Franks Red Hot so I used that. I didn't want to cook the meat any longer in the crock pot since the meat was already perfectly cooked. I just mixed it up and let it set for a bit, then heated it in the microwave before we ate. i did make the cole slaw to put on top-REALLY GOOD. Served it with french fries and baked beans. YUMMY  : ) My hubby really enjoyed it.

I'm from up north and I wanted to make this for my husband who is from NC - and he raved about it! It was simple to make, tasty and delicious. The only thing I changed is that I ended up shredding at the 10 hour mark instead of 12, and excluded cayenne pepper & flakes because of our spice preference. Will be making it again for sure!

Help!! I cooked the meat and my husband shredded it; did not realize there was more to the recipe and accidentally threw out the liquid.  Any suggestions for adding the rest of the ingredients and salvaging the dish.  Thanks.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend.  HE LOVED IT!  I followed the recipe to a T except that I doubled the brown sugar and added just a little bit of cider vinegar instead of the hot sauce.  We will definitly be making this again!

WOW!  This was incredibly easy and SOOOO wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" from this site.  Both were awesome!   I had BBQ once when I went to N. Carolina and this was just like I remember it!  Will be making this again!

super easy.  super-effin' good.  as good or better than barbecue establishments in carolina (i'm in durham).  this is pretty hot (i used less meat), which i like, but it might not be for the faint of heart.  i second the motion of using some liquid smoke.  best of all, the intensity of flavor relegates the need for any type of additional sauce.  i recommend draining some of the fat and juic before eating so as to not get a soggy bun, it's still very moist.  top with vinegar based slaw.

I tried this to feed a large family and boy it was good. I forgot the steps after cooking the meat, so I imagine next time it will be even better. Very clost to the type I buy every week at a local restaurant.

I can't eat too much spicy stuff and my husband doesn't really like spicy food (plus didn't have any pepper sauce) so I used dijon mustard instead lol. Wasn't sure how it would come out because of that but it was still DELICIOUS!! I have always wanted to make pulled pork, just didn't know how. I'll definitely make this again. As I was pulling the pork I couldn't stop nibbling on the meat lol -- so delicious.

I made this for a family reunion.  Wasn't much left to bring home!  My sister-in-law said it tasted like real Carolina BBQ.  I did add the smoked ham and a little liquid smoke, but basically followed the recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for an easy, great recipe!

I followed the recipe exact and found this to be a total let down.  It was bland, not a single ingredient stood out in terms of taste.  We still had to slather on the horse radish and BBQ sauce.  It was edible without, but very boring.

We really liked this, although I found I had to adjust a few things...first, even though I used a 2.5 lb loin roast, there was not enough sauce to keep the pork moist, so I added about 1 C of chicken broth while the shredded pork was simmering on low. I also cooked on high for 5 hours, then shredded and cooked on low for 3 hours. Simmering it really helped the flavor. When I first shredded it and added the spices, it tasted like vinegar. So, the longer you can simmer it already shredded the better. I also seared my loin roast on the stove before putting it in the crockpot. This kept it moist. I served this on a hamburger bun with coleslaw on top, and it was quite a hit.

This was good not great. While I did enjoy the spice, I felt like it needed more of a sauce or something to cover the "pork" taste. Maybe topping with coleslaw or pickles would have helped. I only needed to cook mine on low for 9 hours before it was ready to shred.

Excellent.  I serve the sauce on the side though.  Simmer it on the stove for a few minutes for the flavors to blend and allow all to add as much as they like.  I love it but it is a bit spicy.   A really great recipe and my family loves it

I had really high hopes for this recipe but I just didn't love it.  I'm not into really spicy food so I halved the spices and even then it just seemed off.  However I was able to redeem the recipe by adding a touch of my favorite bbq sauce before serving on a bun and thanks to the spices it still had some heat.  I plan on using the left over (w/o bbq sauce) in a black bean soup.  On the bright side this recipe did yield a very tender and jucy pulled pork but just not the flavor I'm used to.

Wonderful!!!  Cooked overnight, then pulled it apart in the morning, made the sauce, put it back in the slow cooker, and cooked it the remainder of the day.  Overall 24 hours of cooking, and it was wonderful, juicy, and just like it is at home in NC.

Thank goodness for this recipe. I've been looking for anything close to Carolina BBQ and I've found it and it's better than close. Thank you! My husband is from the South and he is thrilled! We live in AZ and can't get Carolina BBQ, but not anymore.

I thought that I had found my all time best pulled pork recipe when I last reviewed slow cooker pulled pork with root beer. This one has bumped it into second place. I used a boston butt a little under 5 lbs. Didn't have any cayenne so I used chipotle instead- figured it would add a little smoky taste to the mix. Also used a couple of tbls of liquid smoke. plus a little more brown sugar cause I put all of the spices into the cider vinegar up front and when I reread the directions realized my error. Any way adding a little more brown sugar and liquid smoke when I was putting shredded pork back in crock pot seemed to be just right. Cooked the pork 8 hours before it was coming off the bone correctly and then 2 more after shredding. This was so moist and flavorful with just the right amount of kick[used about 3 tbls of Louisiana hot sauce and 2 cups of sweet baby rays bbq.

This was completely excellent!  I followed the recipe except for a little extra pepper!  Next time, however, I will follow other's advice and put the crock pot in the garage to cook, it really does smell horrible while cooking!  But it tastes fantastic!

DELICIOUS!  A little too spicy for my taste, though, so next time I will reduce the spicy add-ins a little to mellow it out.  What an easy, delicious meal.  Thanks!  Update:  I made this again tonight with half as much meat and vinegar.  When I added the seasonings, I did the full amount of brown sugar, 1/4tsp. each cayenne and pepper flakes, and 2 tsp. pepper sauce.  It was not quite as exciting, but the kids ate it, so it worked out.

Very good! Made for Superbowl Sunday and it was a great hit with everyone! I am originally from New York, so this wasn't a normal recipe for me, but it got a great big thumbs up from the only born and bred Carolina Girl at my party! I served with homeade cole slaw and some rolls (also from this site). The leftovers tasted great the next day!

Pretty good! I had never had Carolina vinegar based BBQ before, and although good, I think I prefer the tomato based BBQ better. This was pretty spicy, too, although I did use chili powder instead of the red pepper flakes. This was a nice change of pace for us!

WOOOOOOOW!!!  i grew up in the Virginia Beach area and we would go to NC all of the time to get bbq!  this takes me back big time!  i don't have one bad thing to say about this!  i wish i would've known sooner that bbq could taste this good out of a slow cooker!  this was EASY and honestly tasted like i bought this from north carolina!  YUM!  my butcher didn't have any bone-in shoulders the day i made this so i just went ahead and used a 4.5 boneless shoulder.  it was so easy that i was able to throw it in the cooker at midnight and when i woke up it was almost done!  then i didn't even have to fish for the bones sine i used a boneless and i added just a tad bit more vinegar.  (i'm that girl who drowns her fries in the stuff!)  i could go on forever!

I'm from Southwestern Virginia, so I'm well acquainted with Carolina style BBQ. It was great to be able to enjoy it again! The pork had a great bite and was perfectly complimented by Mom's Coleslaw (also from this site). I can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely PERFECT!!! Just like home! We are stationed in England and it's hard for this Carolina girl to get her comfort foods! This is the real deal! I had no clue it was this easy to make REAL Carolina barbeque! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Outstanding!  My husband's comment was, "for a northern girl, you make good bbq!"  I did double the vinegar and sugar while halving the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.

This recipe was a real time saver! By the time I got home the meal was ready and it made great left overs.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

We put the BBQ pork on buns with slaw - a real Southern BBQ treat.

I'm from Eastern NC and this recipe is exceptional!  My friends and myself had several jokes about making BBQ in a crockpot, but I was pleasantly surprised!  This is the best bbq i've had since i moved away from Eastern NC!

Close as you can get. Only suggestion is to add liquid smoke. Since finding this recipe I have made it numerous of times and it never fails me.  Even the hubby loves it!

I've been making this recipe from this site for years. It tastes exactly like the pork BBQ we had at a little lunch shop at the Outer Banks in Kitty Hawk. DEFINITELY add liquid smoke, it makes it taste authentic. I've never been a fan of sweet BBQ sauce, so this vinegar style BBQ really hits the spot. Delicious!

The vinegar definitely did the trick in making this fall of the bone tender.  The vinegar flavor was a little too much for me (but you might like it) so I added a bit more brown sugar and and did top it with coleslaw.  That really made a difference.  Certainly has a little kick to it.

It was easy to make. My wife doesn't like coleslaw and she thought it was too spicy. Going to lower spices to see if she likes it better. Other than that it was good.

It's tough to find great slow cooker recipes out there - this is one of them! We reduced the cayenne down by half and used a pork butt instead of shoulder, per our preference. We prefer to remove some of the excess fat from the meat before cooking if it is very fatty. My husband was quick to say this one is a definite keeper in the rotation, and he is veeeeery picky about BBQ of all varieties. We served it with the Amish slaw, and it was great!

Best slow Cooker Carolina pulled pork I've ever had. Made it to exactly as stated. But not as good as fresh from the smoker of coarse. I think a little liquid smoke might help replicate that taste a little more.

i didn’t notice any particular vinegar smell (apple cider vinegar) and oowee is it hot, but this was just really, really good.  i think i added liquid smoke, which i couldn’t really taste, and some dried mustard, and i left off the hot sauce thinking to serve it at the table instead, but it didn’t need it. i used a boston butt that turned out to be boneless so it cooked faster. 3.34 lbs cooked down to 1.lb 15oz of meat.

Excellent. I did add 2 T. Liquid smoke at the beginning as others suggested. I also subbed smoked paprika for cayenne pepper, as we are not big on  a lot of heat. I cooked it all night. I considered cooking it on my screened porch to lessen the vinegar  aroma in my house; but with open windows we managed to survive.i served it with pretzel buns, toasted. I made Brookeville Hotel’s slaw; which is my favorite recipe.

No changes and will make it on the 4th of July.   I'm not a native  North Carolinian  but have lived here 35 years and have eaten lots of Eastern NC barbecue.  Except for not being the whole hog on a cooker, this is the real deal.

This is done best if you cook the pork shoulder first then shred it. After shredding the pork mix the sauce. My husband would also add Worcestershire sauce. If you use crushed red pepper - use only enough for the hotness that you can handle. For me it's none ( for the cayenne pepper and hot sauce as well). Cook for about 1 hour in sauce.

My store did not have a pork shoulder so I used a loin. I should have cut down the cooking time by an hour or so. It was a little dry. The taste however was awesome and I will make this again!

I must say it was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely make it again but it was so incredibly hot that it did distract a little bit from the flavor and I cut the cayenne pepper out all together. I'll probably remake this in a few weeks staying away from the cayenne pepper again but probably drop down to 1/4 of the crushed red pepper flake.

Hand's down the best slow cooker BBQ around. I have been making this for years now since I first found the recipe, I just never got around to reviewing it. I like the recipe as is, but you can adjust the heat to suit your family. And for those die hard NC BBQ fans who say this isn't BBQ, make it then tell me that. Thank you coolmonkshoes for sharing this recipe!

This is one of my go to recipes for summer. It's easy to make, and oh so GOOD! I have made it several times, but I usually add a bottle of high quality BBQ sauce to any remaining liquid in the slow cooker. My son loves to top his sandwich with coleslaw, and I serve pickles and crispy potato chips on the side. YUM.

Wonderful and so easy!  I skimped on the hot seasonings because I was afraid it would be to hot for me, but I ended up adding most of what I had left out after eating it for the first time--at least the hot sauce.  This recipe is great.

Delicious! I followed the instructions exactly and this is true NC pulled pork. For everyone suggesting the liquid smoke I purchased some just in case but I didn’t need it at all. I love the slight vinegar taste in my pulled pork. That’s the trademark Carolina taste. Now if you’re partial to traditional bbq with the red sauce then, yes, add the liquid smoke. Just make sure to taste it as-is first. You just might prefer it without.

If you can't smoke traditional pork BBQ this comes in close second.  My only issue with slow cookers is that is sits in its own fat the whole time and hard to get the juice free of fat.  However, I followed exactly and at the end, added a traditional  east Carolina BBQ sauce made of vinegar and red pepper flakes and that finished it off nicely;  with some coleslaw of course! Will make again when smoking the meat is not an option.

I've made this several times and everybody loves it. There's even been times I've had folks request it specifically. Great recipe as is. Sometimes I do add a little more brown sugar but I always use Frank's Red Hot sauce for best flavor.

This recipe did not disappoint!! Everyone in my home LOVED it, including the kids. I did not have any issues with the smell although most of the slow cooking was done while I was at work. I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar because I thought it needed it, and added liquid smoke per other reviewers suggestions. I used 3 tablespoons of it and that was definitely the missing ingredient for this. The meat was so tender, juicy and just perfectly seasoned. I made with coleslaw and cream corn recipes I also got on this site and it was perfection. I’m not a huge coleslaw fan otherwise but adding some on this burger really brought all the flavors out. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I have made this several times. The first time exactly as written and it was a little too spicy for my husband so I dialed back the slices by half and it was perfect for my family. I do add a good amount of liquid smoke along with the vinegar and it tastes almost like the BBQ I grew to love while living in NC.

I made this today. It turned out really good! I've been making pulled pork for many years. I was glad to find this recipe. Love the tang and little spice. I was tired of the barbecue flavored pork. Hubby and son loved it too. This will be my go to recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was amazing!  The only thing i did differently was add about a tablespoon of liquid smoke to the ACV while the pork was cooking.  Other than that, I followed everything exactly as shown in the recipe and it came out great.  You can cook it on high for 6 hours instead of in low for 12.  I’ve eaten some good authentic Carolina BBQ from some fabulous restaurants in the south and this recipe is authentic as they come.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loved it but there was too much liquid. I only saved the 2 cups as per recipe and had to strain out the liquid of  each serving. I may thicken it up next time.

This is my go-to BBQ recipe. It is very easy, and rivals some of the best I have ever eaten anywhere. Two long time and accomplished cooks of barbecue were amazed when I served it to them.

It can be a little spicy for some tastes so unless you like it hot, you may want to cut back some on the peppers and hot sauce.

Wow! This is way too delicious for how cheap and easy it was to make! I threw it in the crock pot before bed, and had lunch ready when I woke up. Just threw it on some reheated rice and it was stellar! I will say I eye-balled the spicy ingredients as I always do, because I visually know my spice tolerance well. No need to measure with that stuff. To my surprise though the vinegar isn't too overpowering because it's cut with all the juices and fat coming out of the pork shoulder. That apple cider vinegar zing is just enough to leave you craving more after every bite. I had it for lunch, dinner, and a late night snack, and I'm still wanting to go back for another bowl.

Great! I used liquid smoke as others recommend. Cole slaw and buns to complete the meal. This is one of those meals that's delicious and requires little effort. Reminded me of barbeque I'd had in Durham, NC although a bit spicier. I reduced the cayenne and skipped the pepper flakes but it still had plenty of zing.

I personally think the sauce portion of this recipe is too spicy. I will cut the red pepper flakes and cayenne in half next time I make this. The flavor is on-point for NC BBQ, though.

No hot sauce. Crushed red pepper and very small amount of brown sugar. Keep skimming fat from crock pot. When done bone just came out clean. Didn't need forks shreaded with large serving  spoon in crock pot. The best I've had in years

Easy to make and everyone loved it. I lived in North Carolina while in the navy and really missed Carolina BBQ which I can't seem to get here in PA so I tried this recipe and comes pretty close to the BBQ down in NC.

I made this and it came out great. I made a 2 1/4 lb pork shoulder. I left out the red pepper flakes and used only pepper sauce and a little cayenne pepper to suit my taste. I would make it again, for sure.

Excellent just as listed. I cut the hot stuff by 1/3 , subbed sugar and a little molasses since out of brown sugar. 
The hot is completely absorbed by the slaw and bun, eat it without to allow your full allotment of cold beer

This is my go to recipe for NC style BBQ to feed a crowd. Only thing that I do different is add about 2 Tbsp of Stubbs Liquid smoke Hickory flavor to the crock pot. I am from NC and this is a great easy recipe.

Amazingly simple and delicious, have made this several times., last time did a boneless pork, need to figure out adjustment for seasoning to account for there was more meat than had it been a bone in

My aunt and uncle had a couple barbecue restaurants in NC  for decades before they retired to the coast. When you don’t have a pit or a smoker, this recipe is a lifesaver for satisfying those cravings for vinegar-based Carolina barbecue. I always make this a day ahead, then warm in a skillet to get the texture I was raised eating. I skim the fat off the extra liquid rather than tossing, then reduce with more red pepper and a tablespoon of dijon added for an optional sauce. I’ll eat this stuff on an arugula salad or with roasted Brussel sprouts, not just cookout fixings - it’s divine!

This recipe is perfect!!! Absolutely love it! Not into the BBQ sauce type BBQ, We like the vinegar with a kick kind... perfect amount of vinegar so it doesn’t overtake it and perfect kick. Love it!

I was really surprised how well this came out. It did smell pretty bad while cooking but, the end result was well worth it. The fam loved it.
I normally make my pork BBQ on my smoker but was looking for something different.
Edit:I did add a few drops of liquid smoke flavor to mine also. I think it was just 3 drops, that stuff goes a loong way.

I made this for thanksgiving with a 2.5lb pork shoulder and it came out great! I did add a little siracha and liquid smoke as others suggested.  I also added some Louisiana hot sauce.  Very tasty.  If I wasn't  sharing it with my mother I would have added more hot sauce but it is fine added after the fact. Served with summer slaw, 4 bean salad, corn bread and kings hawiaan rolls yummm!

AWESOME!!! I live in eastern NC and eat a lot of barbecue from several different establishments. This ranks right there with the best. Had 3 employees (also connoisseurs of barbecue) that thought the same.  Next time I may reduce cook time 45 minutes to an hour because it wasn't pull pork, it was almost like ground after 12 hours. Super easy!  I did make a pepper vinager with salt, pepper, cayenne,and crushed red pepper flakes to pour over the final produce.  Again, awesome!

Absolutely amazing!!! I took the advice of other reviews & put 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke in with the vinegar & I am glad I did! I cooked it on high for 7 1/2 hours since I got a late start getting it in the crockpot. I then "pulled" it with a hand mixer which perfectly shredded it. Served with a side of homemade mac & cheese and coleslaw. By far one our favorites so far! Our whole family enjoyed it, including my picky husband & 4 of our children.

Used this recipe for a Tailgate Party where we design our menu based on the team we are playing. Played a team out of North Carolina so Carolina Pulled Pork seemed right. It was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I didn't make any changes to the original recipe but I may add a little more heat when I make it for myself.

Thought all the 5-star reviews were exaggerations. Boy, was I mistaken. This is superb. Since I have many crock-pots I'll make several simultaneously. Then I can freeze some for a "cold winter's night." 
Made this as written.

This was my first time ever making pulled pork, and it turned out great. I cut way back on the cayenne and red pepper flakes, and added 2tbsp liquid smoke. I made pulled pork sandwiches with a copycat KFC coleslaw recipe I found online and it was incredible! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is hot! I used scant measurements of cayenne,  pepper sauce and pepper flakes and it was still very hot. Be careful about which brand pepper sauce you use, too. Too hot of a sauce could make it unbearable. 
We loved it, though! My SO is a native South Carolinian and he thought it had a wonderful authentic flavor.  Being from New York I was thrilled to hear that and it'll be top of my list whenever I see shoulder or butt on sale.

great flavor, I was looking for something like this. nice Carolina style bbq. I was afraid the sauce would be too spicy, but it was not, maybe the brown sugar tamed it down. I cooked it 5 hours on high, and then a couple hours on low. it was just a 3 pound roast. I will definitely be making this again. oh yes the coleslaw
really set it off. if you don't like the vinegar bbq sauce, it is just as good with regular bbq sauce.

This was very good, and very easy!  I used a spice rub in addition to the salt and pepper seasonings at the beginning was a good addition, but I probably should have used a little less cayenne pepper and pepper flakes in the sauce.  It was VERY spicy!

The liquid smoke is a huge difference.  Make sure you add it to the vinegar.  I didn't have pork shoulder around but I had several pounds of pork country ribs that I used instead.  I also mixed the dry ingredients with the vinegar and poured everything on top of the ribs and let it go to work.  It had a that twangy, hot, and sweet flavor that I love about Carolina BBQ.  I made this for the UNC title game and I couldn't be happier espeically since the TarHeels got their redemption win!  This was a special occasion but with the way it turned out, I'll be making this more often.  And if it tasted this good as country ribs, I can only imagine what a pork shoulder would taste like!

I love my Smithfields but always have to add some Texas Pete to the top to give it some extra kick. This recipe DEFINITELY has that kick and then some. I read just about every review and I admit I rolled my eyes at the ones saying it was too hot but to humor the family I decided to tone this down some. I added liquid smoke to the apple cider vinegar, and cut the red pepper flakes  and the cayenne pepper to 1 heaping teaspoon each. Served it with a homemade slaw (sauce mix on this site) and everyone enjoyed it. Now if I were making a full batch for myself... I would follow the recipe exactly (except I would still include the liquid smoke). Great stuff, thanks so much!

This was good. We like spicy and the sauce was still a little spicy for us. It was a little dry but that could have been the pork I used and the fact that I didn't turn it in the slow cooker.

This recipe has ALWAYS been a hit at my holiday parties! People beg me for more during the year! It's got a great, light flavor that you'd expect from a Carolina/vinegar barbecue. 

I usually sit the pork on a bed of pulled-apart onions, for additional kick during the cook. Sometimes I add a little extra cayenne or red peppers, because I'm hot like that! Next time I'll try some liquid smoke. And usually I find some great local cole slaw to serve with it.

I made it exactly as the recipe said only my pork loin went into the pot frozen. Served it with homemade coleslaw (1/2c mayo,2T red wine vinegar, 2T sugar, tsp salt, with 16oz slaw bag) on soft Kaiser roll. Excellent. Was sure it would be too spicy, but it was perfect. btw I didn't measure the liquid in the crock. I just added the additional ingredients to the meat and juice.

Excellent taste, easy to make and got raves from my family members who love this particular type of barbecue.  Those who prefer the sweet type can simply a commercial barbecue sauce onto their meat before they eat it.  So glad to find this!

This is a go to recipe for our family! We have made it for the last few years, and don't see it ever not being part of our rotations! As a displaced Eastern North Carolinian this is perfect for when I need a taste of home! We will even make it overnight sometimes to enjoy for lunch! The hardest part is finding a coleslaw that pairs as well as they do at home. Texas Pete is a must as the hot sauce choice!

Amazing recipe. This was super simple to prepare and the taste was very "North Carolina"! The hardest thing about this recipe was the wait. The house smelled so good, but I had to wait another 4 hours for it to complete in the slow cooker.

I cut the recipe in half because it is too much for only my wife and I. I also substituted the pork shoulder with a pork roast. At around the sixth hour on the low setting all of the liquid in the crock pot had evaporated. I added water to keep the moisture. At the eight hour the liquid had evaporated again so I added more water. Enough to equal the amount needed to complete the recipe. What was nice is that the water deglazed the pot so all of those good drippings made a great sauce. I also added liquid smoke as other have and the pork turned out very moist and delicious. I served it over a bun topped with cole slaw. I enjoyed this very much and will be making it again in the future.

Made this recipe for BBQ nachos.  Added a BBQ rub with the salt and pepper step and some liquid smoke (about 2 T) to apple cider vinegar.  Didn't use the pepper called for at the end of the recipe because I don't like the heat.  Added a little more liquid smoke after cooking.  Delicious!  Will likely make again.

This is my GO-TO recipe for Carolina BBQ!  It's easy and delicious and comes out perfect every time...though I usually add more like 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes than just 2 measly teaspoons.  But to each his own.  A few tips:

1) When you make this, your house will smell like VINEGAR.  It was so strong the first time I made it, I literally smelled it in my dreams.  Now I put the slow cooker in the garage and let it cook out there.
2) The spiciness will increase over time.  So if you just made it and you think it's almost spicy enough, leave it alone.  After a day or two, it'll get there.
3) 12 hours of cooking will do the job, but an hour or two extra won't hurt and might make the meat more tender.

I live in North Carolina right in the center of the BBQ capital and this is the real deal! Cooked the recipe exactly and it is perfect as is! Wouldn't change a thing! Delicious! I always make the sweet restaurant  slaw recipe from this site to go with it. Sweetness really off sets the heat for a perfect combination of flavor.

As is, this was a fabulous recipe.  I made this for a pot luck...OK it was a Crockpot Luck...at work.  It was a hit!  I also made coleslaw recipe by Paige to serve with this.  That was my other success for that day.  Look for her coleslaw recipe.

I had never heard of Carolina BBQ, but my husband and I loved it! Also the idea of putting coleslaw on top seemed odd, but I did that and we like that as well. I made this following the recipe. The only changes I made were to follow someone else's advice to cook it on High for 5 1/2 to 6 hours as I started too late to do the slow cooking on Low . I also mixed my hot spices separately in a bowl and added at the end to taste , since I had noted it was too hot for some. And I love spice for flavor but do not like the superhot spicy foods. Totally delicious, so easy, and I know this will be on our regular menu :-)

My wife and daughter don't tolerate spice (heat) very well, and my wife is not a big fan of pork. However, she is from Eastern North Carolina, and I love the barbecue they make there. So I took a shot at this recipe, hoping to replicate that taste. Couldn't find a 5-pound shoulder, so used a 10-pound one and doubled the other ingredients. OK, most of the others - I used about half of the original amounts of cayenne, flakes, and hot sauce. I can confirm the pungent odor others have noted. It didn't bother me, but my wife said she was nearly ill after walking in the door. The flavor was WONDERFUL! The spiciness was right at the limit of what my ladies can handle. When I make this again, I will make and use less sauce at the end. I ended up draining what I could out of the leftovers before freezing 2 meals (or more) worth.

Very good. It is rather spicey but the degree of vinegar taste was spot on. I did a lot of cracked pepper and a little more salt then suggested in recipe on the finished product to dial down the hotness just a tad.  Overall, super easy and real good. I substituted pork ribs with more meat than rib on it.

I have made this for years.  My tweak is to rub the meat down  well with Tony Cacheres seasoning, before putting it in the crock pot,then cutting back some on the red pepper.  I also cut up an onion and lay the meat on it.  I stir the brown sugar into the vinegar before pouring it on.  This modifies the vinegar smell while cooking.  Also, I try to cook the day before, take it out of frig and get rid of the fat.  Put it back in the pot to warm it, then shred it.  Meanwhile, I take the  liquid and about half to half add bottled Carolina sauce, mix it well with the shredded meat and onions, put it all back in the pot to keep warm.  Bring out the slider rolls and chow down.  Incredibly good.

I have been using this recipe for several years.  A good friend used to bring me pulled pork from North Carolina and I along with my sons loved it.  Well, my friend moved to North Carolina and there went the pulled pork.  With the Internet on hand, I decided to find a recipe so I could make my own.  After a long search I found this recipe and the rest is history.  It's better than any pulled pork I have ever had.  Of course because our taste buds differ I you can add more or less salt and peppers.  I have added a little more salt and a little less hots, depending on who I am serving.  All in all this recipe is great.  Oh, almost forgot to address the smell.  I cook this on my deck.  Keeps the smell out of the house.  Cook on high for 5 1/2 to 6 hours.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. Followed the recipe exactly, using Cholula brand hot sauce. Use a fat separator before adding the juice back to the crockpot. Cooking this outside or in the garage is a good idea if you don't want the house to smell like vinegar. Next time I plan on adding smoked paprika to give it some color and smoky flavor.

I would definitely make this again. I decreased some of the pepper and omitted the hot sauce and it came out well. I only decreased the heat because I only had 2 pounds of meat. I cooked the meat on high for about 6 hours. The meat was so tender. I live in Eastern NC and this recipe taste exactly like the barbecue we purchase at the local restaurants and the barbecue we eat at family barbecues. Next time I will make the recipe exactly as written. Two thumbs up for this recipe!

I was skeptical about this tasting like NC BBQ. Followed directions except I left out the cayenne which I thought was an excessive amount, added 10 drops of pecan liquid smoke at the end, and cooked it with two pieces of smoked pork neck bone. Put it on a bun with some cole slaw and It was as good as any NC BBQ I've ever had. Tasted just like home. This is a fantastic recipe that will go into regular rotation!  Put the cooker in the garage or outside, the vinegar smell is overwhelming in the house when cooking.

North Carolina girl who searched for the Eastern barbeque perfection! This is it! Had no time, so used already slice bone-in pork shoulder.  Slow cooked on high with the vinegars and 2 tablespoons Liquid Smoke for 7 hours. Removed bones, shredded and returned to slow cooker with some liquid and some of the red pepper sauce made for plastic bottle sauce condiment. Heated on low until ready to serve. Served with the dry coleslaw from smokingmeatforms.com called Simple Eastern North Carolina Style Slaw. I just bought angel sliced cabbage in bags, chopped it very fine, and let it marinate for 
the 7 hours it took to cook the barbeque. White hamburger buns, cornbread, corn on the cob, sweet tea, potatoe salad or baked beans, watermelon, fruit salad and cobbler! Just like home! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe except I halved the peppers/pepper sauce and added in a tablespoon of liquid smoke.  Now I'm off to make the coleslaw ;)

As good as a slow cooking pulled pork can be in my book.  I love these Carolina style BBQs.   A really good way to do something different than basic BBQ pulled pork which I love but can get a little played.

I really, really liked this recipe.  We tend to like the more vinegary tasting bbq vs. the sweeter hickory types.  I've made this recipe 3 times in about 6 weeks now.  The 2nd time I used a pork roast that we bought that was tied up in one of those mesh meat bags.  That was not the right kind of cut - although it was the right weight, it was mushier overall.  I think it needs that shoulder bone in as called for--has a much better texture when cooked.  I followed the recipe exactly but I've found that I need more hot sauce than called for.  It's probably a good idea to make this and then put in the 'fridge overnight for the flavors to combine more completely.  I've never served it right after making it.  This makes a LOT of bbq - perfect for a picnic or gathering.  For those of you who do like the more traditional/red bbq, simply make this as directed and then add your favorite sauce to it when done.  When checking with a local bbq joint in my neighborhood, that's how they make it.  If you want NC style, stay with the vinegar; if you want the Virginia (red) style, add your sauce after cooking.  It really is a delicious dish.  Add your favorite slaw and voila!  I recommend Texas Pete hot sauce as opposed to Tabasco.

I've made this multiple times- I started making it when I was living outside of the South for several years and just couldn't get good barbecue!  I give it four stars as-is and five stars with a couple of modifications.  

Sprinkle some garlic powder in with the salt and pepper.  Delicious and adds some depth to the meat.  

Add about 2 teaspoons of hickory liquid smoke to the crockpot when adding the liquid.  This gives a little more of the pit-barbecue taste that I was craving. 

I like to trim away some of the pieces of more solid fat when preparing the shoulder.  I've found that if I do this, I can reduce the amount of time needed to cook the meat if I just cut it into large chunks when prepping (6-8 hours on high instead of 12 hours on low).  

The sauce is also really good and very adjustable to taste.  I generally don't mix it in with the meat at first and keep in on the side instead just in case it is too spicy for some.  I've never had a problem with the spiciness level.  

This is one we keep coming back to again and again in our house!

I cooked a 7lb Boston Butt and made adjustments to the ingredients. I added the liquid smoke, I also added some cinnamon to mellow the taste. I love this recipe!

I was looking for a stand alone vinegar based bbq but I guess it's not easy getting smoked, roasted flavor into crockpot meat. I did add liquid smoke which is a must. Once we added sweet tomato based sauce on top it was actually pretty good.

Like almost everyone .....we thought this was a big hit..with  zero work.   It's almost as good as BBQ cooked on the Kamado, low and slow.   I used hickory smoked salt once and another time liquid smoke...both were fantastic and really added to the dish!   We didn't notice a vinegar order..just yummy pork cooking!!,

Amazing! Best recipe I've found for pork shoulder. Changes that I made included using white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar, and I used 5 lb. boneless pork shoulder from Costco, and it only needed 7 hours on low and it turned out incredibly tender. Will absolutely make this again.

I made this twice so far.   Each time I skipped on the hot sauce,  and used a little over 5lb boneless shoulder pork.   I didn't have to drain the juices,  it was right at the 2 cups that was called for each time.   Maybe because it was boneless?   

The first time I fixed this,  I followed another suggestion and added 4tbspn liquid smoke  right at the beginning.   The house smelled good. 

The second time,  I couldn't find the liquid smoke before I left for work.   When I got back from work,  the house smelled thick of vinegar...  Adding liquid smoke at the end still left a sharp vinegar taste in the meat.   So I recommend adding liquid  smoke right at the beginning. 

Either way,  it was thoroughly enjoyed,  and there was plenty of leftovers for my family of 5.

Absolutely awesome.  As many before have suggested the only thing I added was 2-3 tablespoons of liquid smoke (mesquite or hickory if you want a more pronounced flavor).  It didn't require it but it helps disguise the fact that you're making this in a crockpot.  Well done with this one!

I've used this recipe time & time again. In fact, I've got a pork shoulder in the slow cooker as we speak. This bbq is some of the best I've ever had & it is sooooo easy to make. The only thing that is missing is the smokiness of a true Carolina bbq. Besides that, this is a terrific recipe!

Experimented for first time to celebrate Panthers Super Bowl....have one son in NC, another culinary son who loves Nc bbq.
Was easy for this novice to prepare and an extreme hit with the family.  I used rice vinegar, indulged in Texas Pete pepper sauce, less red pepper, used smoked paprika (added hint of smoke and some spice) in lieu of cayenne.  
Was so much fun!!!  Thanks to all who gave comments before me....

After graduate school in Chapel Hill I am addicted to vinegar based pork barbecue. A smoker and 12 hours is better but this recipe is a strong runner up. I use a spicy rub and all some to the sauce for that extra kick. Wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe pretty closely and turned out great!! Since my family does not care for spicy foods, I cut back on cayenne pepper and hot sauce for them.  Is very spicy as is, but nothing wrong with that!

Will make again 2-3 times a year.  As many reviews, I too was concerned by the amount of vinegar .   I used a 7 lb roast and the same amount of vinegar the recipe calls for.  The vinegar taste was not too strong at all.  Make sure you use apple cider vinegar not white vinegar.  The other concern people have - yes it is VERY spicy.  My family loves spicy food so we liked the recipe.  But if this is not for you,  you can use 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the peppers.  I also added smoked salt.  It does need that or liquid smoke.

I am super picky when it comes to Eastern Carolina BBQ but this one was great. I did reduce the amount of cayenne and chili flakes or it would have been too hot. Also I had only had about 1/2 cup of juices after it had cooked all day so I had to add cider vinegar with the spices at the end. It still turned out delicious but I'm wondering how to make sure there are more juices at the end of cooking.

Loved this recipe.  Used 4 pounds of meat and cooked for 7.5 hours.  I used hot pepper infused vinegar in place of the apple cider vinegar and hot sauce/cayenne/hot pepper flakes.  Also, I added about 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro.  Served as suggested on a bun with coleslaw.  Would make this again anytime.

This was a great recipe for pulled pork.  I took a trip to North Carolina this summer and found a great local BBQ place.  I was trying to find something that would taste like that and this exceeded my expectations.  I did have to adjust the spice level though.  I used the same amount of hot sauce but I cut the cayenne down to 1 tp and no red pepper flakes.  For me, this was still spicy.  I liked the heat level but I wouldn't have been able to take more than that.

I picked up a 3.75 lb shoulder butt roast (whatever that means) and proportionately reduced the vinegar. I scraped off the chunky fat while pulling the pork and also skimmed some of the fat from the liquid. When it was time to add the spice, I forgot to reduce the proportions, but it still came out great. I like things medium spicy and it came out perfectly for my taste (but I can imagine it being too much for people who don't like it spicy). Plenty of flavor without adding liquid smoke, which is great since I prefer avoiding the carcinogens from smoked products. Threw it on a bolillo roll and spooned the 'au jus' on the top part. Dare I say it was better than the pork sandwich at Philippe's in Los Angeles (the birthplace of French dip).

This was ok.  I used white vinegar and cut the hot sauce in half. I added bottled bbq sauce at the table as I prefer the tomato based sauce. Next time I'll try the liquid smoke suggestion.

I used a pork loin for less fat and I skipped the slaw since I don't care for it. Great easy recipe.

Made this for a fundraiser.  Received several compliments and requests for the recipe.  Only change I made was added a little liquid smoke.

Very good. The closest I've found to NC BBQ yet. One reader's suggestion to add liquid smoke is probably a really good idea!  I cut the recipe down and used a 3 lb roast instead of 5. It didn't seem vinegar-y enough, but that might have been because of the change in servings. Perhaps I should have kept the original sauce amounts even though the meat was smaller.

I am making this for the second time tonight.  Delicious!  I am cutting the spice in 1/2 this time so my younger children can eat it also.

I made this exactly like the recipe calls for a few years ago and loved it.  I'm making a few changes, per the reviews with added onions and a little steak sauce, since I don't have any liquid smoke on hand, again today.

Really good. Added smoke. Cooked two 4 pound butts for 12 hours on low. Cooked it outside so house wouldn't smell.

This was a great way to cook pulled pork and keep the kitchen cool! I used smoked sea salt, the cayenne pepper, etc. as a dry rub overnight, then placed in the crockpot to cook. Delicious!

Good but thought it was missing something.  I did add liquid smoke, per others suggestions, but wasn't sure at which point.  I added some with the vinegar and later some in sauce.  I think I should added all 2 1/2 T with the sauce.  It wasn't much a smoke flavor.  Will make again but make some adjustments.  Served with the Creamy spicy coleslaw.

Only change I made was I made more of the sauce then was called for. Mainly because I like it saucy and for re- heating. But it was beyond compare! Absolutely delicious. A +

This pulled pork recipe is fantastic.  Reminds me of the sandwich's that a restaurant called Pierce's BBQ used to make.  It is on a feeder road going down 64 towards Williamsburg, VA. My first experience with Carolina BBQ.  This recipe nails it.  Delicious!!!!

Too vinegary for me.  But I loved the way the pork roast cooked.  I will try it again with apple juice or maybe just plain water.

I'm from eastern North Carolina, and there is nothing better than a pig pickin' with coleslaw.  I put my pork and vinegar into the crockpot before I went to bed and let it cook all night, mainly, because of 12 hours smelling the vinegar. I did use the liquid smoke, as suggested.  It was ready for lunch or supper that night.  Delicious. There is another recipe on this site that proposes to be eastern NC barbecue, but it's not. If you want the pure taste, try this recipe, and you'll throw your bottle of barbecue sauce away.

I made this for the first time for a work Christmas party. I doubled the recipe. Every bit was gone. I personally thought it was a little too spicy, but I will definitely make this again. It's a sure CAROLINA winner in my book!

Made the house smell but definitely worth it!! I added some diced onion and garlic and 2 tbs liquid smoke. I halved the cayenne pepper. I used a boston butt cut. It was perfect!! My husband said he could even loved it without any sauce!!

We have made Carolina pulled pork BBQ for years, but, we never use all of that hot spice stuff.  Our pork is very good meat, we don't need to mask the flavor with hot spices.  When we have community pot-lucks I frequently am asked to bring this.  So, just leave out the hot spice and do add a little liquid smoke.  It's the apple cider vinegar that really makes this anyway.

I was so excited to try this because it has great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, and added liquid smoke as was suggested. The meat prior to adding other ingredients was delicious - but I must say the final result was a massive letdown. Even my husband - who loves spicy food - said it was like he was eating a cayenne sandwich. The only flavor was cayenne pepper. I could've microwaved a hot dog and added a tsp of cayenne for the same result. I'll definitely make the meat again, but with major adjustments.

This is the best Carolina BBQ I've had in years! I'm so glad that I can finally make it myself.  You can't find this kind of BBQ where I live...most restaurants make tomato-based kind.  It's super easy to make, too.

Made this for the first time a couple of years ago while living in Virginia. Shared with friends, nothing but rave reviews, and most people say it's better than 99% of store/restaraunt Carolina BBQ.

5 stars and I didn't even cook it per recipe.  Actually, in my haste, I added all ingredients to slow cooker, got to the end of the recipe and OOPS!  Oh, well...it was delicious.  I did add the liquid smoke.  When I served it, I heated up some Stubbs BBQ Sauce I had in the fridge and mixed it with some of the juices.  I can't wait to find another pork shoulder on sale and try this again...according to the recipe.  I'm betting it will be a 7 STAR recipe.  Loved it!

So delicious and moist! I followed some of the reviewers' advice and added 3 tbsp of liquid smoke. I like my Carolina BBQ a little less spicy and only did 1 tsp each of the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes - just enough for a little kick but not leaving my mouth on fire. This is my new favorite BBQ recipe!

Never made pulled pork before & never had Carolina BBQ before. This was easy & family liked it very much served on toasted onion buns & coleslaw. I used some BBQ sauce on the sandwich to add an extra kick. Thanks for the recipe & photo to show how to put it together.

Tasted great, especially after being in the fridge. Next time I would add the spices for maybe the last hour of cooking and only add half the spices. 4/1/14

Having lived in North Carolina all my life, I really like good BBQ. This about as close as you can get without a smoker or pit. I cut down on the hot ingredients so it wouldn't be too spicy hot for my taste. Other than that, I followed the directions. I took it out of the slow cooker at the 10 hour mark as the internal temperature of the meat was 180 degrees. The meat just flaked off and was easy to shred. It was delicious.

Lived in NC for 40 years and love bbq. This was as good as any I've had and better than most! I followed the recipe exactly.  One thing I did was at the end after allowing it to sit in the sauce warming for an hour, I drained off the liquid so it would be dry to serve.  Just a personal preference.

This was a awesome recipe. It tasted really similar to my favorite BBQ place in North Carolina.  The only thing I added was liquid smoke and halved the recipe because there is only two of us. Mine did not turn out spicy like other reviewers have said.

I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Since moving to the Carolina's we've come to really enjoy Carolina BBQ. However it is expensive so I saw this recipe and it is our new go to for amazing BBQ. We also add the liquid smoke which just gives it that extra authenticity. If we ever leave the Carolina's, this is something we'll always make! Thanks for the awesome recipe! Also the vinegar smell is not bad at all.

We are a family of pulled pork snobs. Usually done on the smoker and smothered in bbq sauce. This was different for us but we were all a fan. To win hubby's approval on this was a tall order and this recipe came through. Wouldn't change a thing. Served it with coleslaw recipe from this site. (no mayo) Outstanding! thanks coolmonkshoes!

This turned out really well for us.  I used a pork loin, and rubbed it with liquid smoke as well as hickory smoked salt and pepper, then loosely topped with aluminum foil in the slow cooker while cooking.  I was pressed for time, so I cooked this on high for about 4 hours, then low for about 3 1/2 before shredding.  Had I had more smoke flavor, this would have reminded me of when my dad dug a pit and slow cooked a pig when I was little.  Fall apart tender and delicious.  The vinegar smell was noticeable during the day, but not overpowering.  Served this on homemade onion rolls with from scratch honey/molasses barbecue sauce for topping.  Thanks for sharing.

So very yummy! I love pulled pork and vinegar based Carolina barbecue sauce. We are in an apartment right now so I couldn't grill it, even if I knew how. This recipe is amazing. The only modification I used was to add 3 tbsp liquid smoke, as per other reviews, to really give it an authentic "bbq" taste. I made the sauce but didn't put the meat back in so the kids (who hate spicy) could enjoy this too. Good all around!

It's possible I left it in too long, because I had a 6.6 pound pork shoulder, but I think the result may still have been the same.  Very appley flavored pork.  I've had the amazing pork you get at some select restaurants around NC, where I live, and I certainly wasn't expecting this to be on that level, but this just ended up tasting like cafeteria barbeque.  I should have guessed it wouldn't be great when all you marinate it in is apple cider vinegar, and then for the sauce, MORE apple cider vinegar with other stuff mixed in that can't hope to compete with the apple taste.

Maybe I'll try the Sweet and Savory Slow Cooker Pulled pork next time.

YUM!!  I've never had "BBQ" in this style before.  I grew up on Texas BBQ, so I was skeptical, but it was fantastic!  We made the recipe exactly as written, but then dressed it with roasted jalapenos for the heck of it (YUM again!).  It was a bit too spicy for our 10-yr-old, but perfect for us... and as I said, we even added jalapenos LOL.  We served our son's open-faced on a piece of buttered bread, without any extra "sauce" and it cooled the heat just enough and he really enjoyed this way.  So no, not what *I* grew up calling BBQ, but definitely a new addition to our rotation of favorite crock-pot dishes.  :)

Yummy! The smell while cooking didn't bother me, but my husbind hated it. The few things i did differently 1) i didn't have apple cider vinegar, so i substituted malt vinegar and a dash of apple juice and watered it down a bit 2) rather than adding the shreaded meat directly back to the juices, i poured the juice into a pot and added the spices as well as a little brown sugar and simmered for about 10 minutes

So so good. I made this using about 3 pounds of chicken thighs cooked on high for 3-4 hours and then low for a few more hours (due to lack of planning). Since it was less meat, I only needed about half of the spices. I also used coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar (but everything else as is). The flavors were delicious and I made it with "Nana's Southern Coleslaw" (using homemade EVOO mayo). My husband says it was one of the best meals he's ever had. Thanks for the great recipe!!

It reminds me of the BBQ I love best out of Carolina.  B's in Greenville NC.  As a previous review stated, I add some Liquid Smoke to the slow cooker and it just adds a bit more goodness to it.  Glad I found this recipe!

I am glad I read the reviews about the smell when it was cooking and was not overly alarmed that the entire house smelled a little rough.  The end product was nothing short of amazing.  I love this recipe and will definitely make this again.  The kids devoured it and brought their friends over to try it as well. I cooked it on high for 6 hours shredded it and then turned it down for another four.  I did add a little liquid smoke as some reviews suggested.  Perfection!

My grocery store only had picnic shoulder so I used that.  It cooked in the crockpot for about 10-11 hours on low (and it really did not stink the house up THAT much!)  After the shredding it into the sauce, I let it cook on low for another 1-2 hours.  It was pretty yummy.  But next time, I will try to make more of the sauce for the side.

Fabulous!  The slow cooker with vinegar made the pork so tender.  I'm no expert at Carolina BBQ, but the flavor was tangy and slightly sweet.  Will certainly make this again.  So easy and yummy!!

Can you say YYYYUUMMMMMMMMM??!!?? This was soooo good. I only bought a 3.5 lb pork butt - but still used the same measurements on the recipe for everything else, as I like a lot of the vinegary sauce. My husband loved it. It does have a little kick to it, but we like that. 2 days later I took the leftovers to my parents house and it was even spicier - but still just as good. I served it on buns with coleslaw. Will definitely make again - and soon!

I've made this twice this week already!  I went easy on the "heat" for my kiddos so I only used the cayenne pepper and no hot sauce...it was plenty spicy for us!  I tossed in a little hickory smoke bbq sauce for the last 2 hours and it was delicious!  I served it on the "Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls"  on this site and it was a big hit when we had guests over last night.  Thanks!

Pretty darn good!  My husband and I had this on onion rolls with broccoli slaw.  I used the Zesty Coleslaw recipe from this site.  Yum!!  It doesn't get any easier than this recipe right here that's for sure.  I agree that the smell was rank though...Ugh...I am a stay at home mom and just so happened to be home all day long while cooking this!  It was worth it in the end though!

Perfect as written. My college aged son requests this everytime he comes home. For a summer twist, try smoking the meat in a grill with wood chips. We set it in an aluminum pan with the vinegar. After it was done, we follwed the recipe for the sauce. It was killer!

I have made this recipe twice now and both times received rave reviews from the family.
