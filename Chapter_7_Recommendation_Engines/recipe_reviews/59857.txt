I have made this receipe several times now and it is the best!  For those who said their pudding didn't thicken, a couple of suggestions.  First of all you must use whole milk and heavy cream.  Second use a short grain rice (the shorter grain rices make more starcch to thicken the pudding).  I chose to add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and sprinkled the cinnamon on the top of the pudding after it was cooked.  It seemed a little strong to me when adding a tbsp of cinnamon to the mix.  All in all, every time I have served this pudding it gets absolute rave reviews.  Thank you Tiny Chef!!

Use Arborio rice, it is a creamier rice.

Just made this for my dad today for Father's Day.  I was going up against my grandma's tried and true rice pudding from when he was a little boy and this one beat it by FAR!!!  So rich & creamy!  *MY CHANGES*  I halved the recipe, used whole milk, only 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 3 TBL butter, and three eggs.  Definately use heavy cream and don't try to skimp with the fat because it really adds to the dish a world of taste :)

Fantastic...my husband and i have tried many many rice pudding recipes,  all have been dismal failures.  Then along came this one.  WOW it turned out better than i could have hoped.  I did decrease the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and the servings to 6 but otherwise I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious.  I do not recommend using skim or 1% milk and you cannot skimp on the heavy cream.  I used whipping cream 35%..... this recipe is worth every minute it takes to prepare and the calories.  Bravo!!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I didn't add the cinnamon to the recipe.instead I added approximately  one tsp of vanilla near the end of cooking time. I like to add my cinnamon just before eating. This is one of the best rice puddings that I've ever had.

This was by far the BEST rice pudding recipe yet! I have tried a few and this is it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. For those who said it didnt thicken maybe you didnt use whole milk? Dont use low fat or skim. This is great, Thanks Tinychef!!!

This is the most delicious pudding I have ever had.  To those who rated it negatively, you must have done something wrong.  This recipe which I followed exactly turned out great.

To die for ! Years ago I had a rice pudding like this that had lemon flavor instead of cinnamon, I think I'll try it that way too. You will love this ! Don't try to reduce the calorie/fat content. It won't taste good. Besides you deserve a treat now and then

Thank you Tinychef. It was perfect. I let the first mixture boil for a few minutes, before dropping the heat. I also added another tbsp of margarine.It was fantastic. The Heavy Cream is the ticket. Thank you.

This is by far the best and creamiest rice pudding recipe I have tried.  Just like my mother's and grandma's this is creamy, rich and melt in the mouth.   I always double the rice and add extra cinnamon, nutmeg, a dash of vanilla and raisins since that's what I like in the pudding... but even without all that this is the BEST and easiest I've found on the internet.  THanks TinyChef, esp. for the egg trick!

This really was amazing!  I was nervous, as I've never had rice pudding turn out well.  I would add more rice next time, as it turns out to be more like a custard with some rice in it.

I followed the recipe as described with whole milk and heavy cream, but making only half the original recipe. I have in my bowl right now a delicious but soupy rice pudding. I even added 50% more rice because others said that longer grain rice has less starch. It sat overnight and I'm pretty much stuck with a soupy pudding.  The taste is delicious, but the recipe does need some help since the amount of rice is not enough compared to the amount of milk. I will be trying it again with more rice and a longer cooking time to see if that will help. Hopefully I can get this to turn out like so many other people.

I knew this recipe was going to be good even before I made it...and it completely met my expectations.  So rich and creamy, great flavor.  We left the cinnamon out and sprinkled it on top.  This recipe makes a LARGE pot, and it still disappeared from our fridge within 48 hours!  Lots of indulgent ingredients, but well worth it.  Go big or go home, right?

This is the best rice pudding I have ever made.  It is just what I was looking for.  It is so creamy.  I made it exactly as written with a little less cinnamon.  I used 2% milk and I had to cook it a few extra minutes until it thickened but it turned out really good.  It makes a ton, maybe I will cut it in half next time.

The end result was a 5 star taste, but I made a few changes so am rating it a 4.  This seemed like a heck of a lot of milk to me, I used about 5 or 6 cups; you can always add a bit more when the rice is cooking if it is getting too thick. I wanted mine creamy, but not soupy, and this amount of milk (approx 5 cups) was perfect.  I only used one egg, and about 2/3 cup sugar (2 cups wow that would be sweet) and added about a tsp vanilla at then end.  Also sprinkled the cinnamon on top rather than cooking in it.

Excellent!!! Used smaller amount of cinnamon in rice. The Best I HAVE HAD ! Additon:  USE SHORT GRAIN RICE, it has more starch + inturn thicker pudding.  I add cinnamon to each serving- when serviced.  I felt it was a bit overpowering when cooked in to - personal preference.   When pudding is finished cooking, I add raisins in half - hubby likes them, me, not so much.  Making tonight, will try the vanillla suggestion, cant  go wrong with "REAL/PURE" vanilla and/or scrap inside of a vanilla bean into pot, drop bean in pot while cooking,, removing before placing in refrig. HIT:  I use my kitchen aid to "temper" eggs, saves time and your arm!  When adding to pot, go SLOW, this will avoid the scrambled egg problem also.  Ummmm!! This IS WORTH the extra time which really isnt alot,  Everyone LOVES it!!

I tried this and is great.  You have to use whole milk to make it happen.  I added 2 extra tablespoons of rice, and deleted the cinnamon and added 1 tsp of vanilla at very end when it was cooling.  It tastes great, the recipe I have been waiting for.f

Very good rice pudding recipe!  I'm a novice at making rice pudding and I can't believe how much you get from only one cup of rice.  Tastes great,  but not used to adding the cinnamon into the pudding itself -  we usually sprinkle on top.  We'll be making it again and see how it goes with just sprinkling the cinnamon on at the end.

Great flavor, but mine also did not thicken.  I added some corn starch mixed with a little milk just to keep from having rice soup for desert.  It worked out pretty well anyways and like I said the flavor was delicious!

I don't know what I did wrong, followed the recipe, but did not get the same results as every other reviewer!  My pudding never thickened!  I did cut the recipe in half, but so did others without having any problems!  I'm thinking I had to overlook something somewhere along the way.  A recipe just doesn't have rave reviews like this one does, then not work for 1 person.  Unfortunately, this recipe requires way too much milk for me to keep trying to make, so I won't be trying this again.  This sounded really good too. :(

very nice recipe. Definitely 5 star rice pudding. I did it exactly as described the first time, and it turned out wonderfully. 

The second time, in an attempt to salve how unhealthy it is, I dialed down the butter and left out the eggs and cream. That makes it more an every day dessert and still very tasty.

Great easy recipe. A little time consuming but well worth it. All three of my picky girls ate it. I made two changes. 1. I used 2% milk as that's what I had on hand and 2. I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  It thickened up perfectly!

Excellent, creamy, rich rice pudding.  It did thicken up for me, but not really enough.  Next time I will halve the recipe (it make SO much we couldn't eat it all) and  an extra egg.  Also don't forget if you think its not thick enough in the pan, it will get thicker when it sets in the fridge.

Way way way to much milk.  I cooked and cooked this for about an hour to thicken it to an acceptable consistency.

So delicious! This is what I have been looking for in a rice pudding! Nice and creamy, not too runny and not as thick as a baked pudding. Yum!!

I have never made nor ate rice pudding before, my father is a big fan of it and I told him I would make it for him.  I followed the recipe just as it is and I wouldn’t change a thing. This is the easiest and tastiest recipe for rice pudding (I have tried 3 different recipes) There was no leftovers.  I made some for three of my co-workers and they said it was the best that they have had.

Wow! My hubby won't stop eating this rice pudding (he's even taking it to work to let his friends know his wife make homemade rice pudding!). I followed the recipe exactly (except for the cinnamon because hubby's not a fan) and it turned out just as described; rich and creamy. According to Rice Gourmet website, type of rice makes a big difference with rice puddings so I used a medium grain instead of the typical long grain I usually have in the house. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

This is by far the closest I have ever come to what you get in diners.  Super duper creamy and rich.  I used arborio rice, and I 'also' cut the recipe in half to 6 servings. I used only 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, then added a little vanilla at the end.  Highly recommended, Very yummy!

I scaled this back to 6 1-cup servings, which is a huge amount. It was indeed time 
consuming, but I agree that it is yummy and worth the trouble. Very cinnamony.

OMG this rice pudding is sooo awesome!!!  Thank you so much Tiny Chef!!  I had my nephew help me with it and he cant wait to make more with me I changed a few things I only added 1/2 a tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg together while cooking and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added raisins and 1 tsp of Vanilla at the end.  I discovered however why the pudding did not thicken for me at first, in the recipe it tells you to reduce the heat to low after it boils.  However if you lower it too much it cant thicken properly so watch to make sure that the pudding is still hot during the time that you have it on low otherwise as I found out it will not thicken properly.  I hope that this helps those of you who tried at first and failed because this recipe definitely deserves another shot!!!

DELISH!! I followed recipe to the letter, except I added a tsp of vanilla. I used risotto rice as its creamier and I am now making this recipe a permanent member in my "family favorites recipe book". Well worth the work involved.

Added a good amount of cinnamon and grated some fresh nutmeg (REAL nuts, not the powder), stirred forever and got the food of the gods. Wow wow wow.
Make sure you only use 1 cup of rice. It really will thicken up. Use vanilla and maybe even some lemon zest but keep stirring and it will be alllll good.

I just made this recipe - literally, just, it's cooling on the counter at the moment. To those who thought that too much milk is used, I thought the same thing. But the eggs and cream will thicken it right up; then once it is in the fridge it will thicken even more into a custard. But I have to say, I was licking the rubber spatula that I swiped the pot with and this was just divine. Then while cooling I decided I would have a real taste - even if it burns my tongue, which it did - and this is simply delicious. I don't know if I can wait the obligatory two hours for it to completely set.  When hubby gets home from work, he will most likely eat a nice big bowl. This is good!!
But I have to add that I don't measure certain ingredients, and for this recipe that would be the cinnamon. My mixture is a light tan. And I added some vanilla to it, also. We LOVE cinnamon and vanilla and I never measure either, and you just can't go wrong with more than a recipe calls for. Just don't overdo it.

I had to change a little based on what I had on hand.  Instead of cream which I didn't have I used a can of condensed milk and just didn't add the sugar.  Turned out thick and creamy and was amazing!  I added the cinnamon and raisins to it as well.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's creamy and delicious. I made some changes though. I added raisins at the same time I added the eggs and a splash of vanilla at the very end. Also, I halved the sugar. I didn't read all the reviews, but none of the ones I read said anything about the high sugar content. We like things sweet, but this would have been two sweet for us. I only used 1 cup of sugar.

Dude!  Definitely the best rice pudding I've EVER had.  I usually cook & bake with all sorts of alcohols/liquers.  So, it was not out of the ordinary for me to add Kahlua to this already outstanding recipe.  I used about a half cup of Kahlua in place of milk in the same portion.  I also used only one Tbs of cinnamon for more of a subtle taste.  All who have tried it, raved. ~~  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!   ~~

I cut this recipe in half. I don't normally keep whole milk on hand but I did have fat free evaporated milk so I used that. I also used fat free half-n-half. That did not affect the end product at all. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract at the end of cooking time. This was so good. SO. GOOD. The vanilla was absolutely necessary. Next time, I might cut back a little on the cinnamon and add a little nutmeg, but that's not reflective of the recipe only a personal choice. This was a great way for me to make a dessert for tonight with on hand ingredients and wasn't expensive for me to make at all plus it was decadent but lower in calories. I'd like to make this dessert to have warm after dinner next time because I think it's better warm. NOTE: Take your time when you temper the eggs with the hot custard so you don't get scrambled eggs in your pudding. It's best to take your time.

This is one of the better rice pudding recipes I have made.  The second time I made it I whisked about a tablespoon of vanilla into the eggs and heavy cream.  I think the vanilla was the perfect addition.  I will definitely make this one again!

Oh MY GOSH!  I had a recipe from my Great Aunt that was (so I thought) the best Rice Pudding ever.  Now I realize that I was CHEATED for years LOL.  This was THE BEST - I prepared this as directed and it was AMAZING.  I have shared it with two of my neighbor friends and they could NOT believe it - I did confess I got the recipe from allrecipes.com!  Thanks for this WONDERFUL keeper recipe!

This was very good. It states to simmer until thickened, but mine didn't at all. I went ahead and poured it into the serving bowl and let it sit out for about 20 minutes and it was during this time that it started thickening.

I made this for Easter.  I have read many reviews on this pudding so many said theirs came out soupy.  Suprisingly mide came out too thick! But I think it was something I did to it. But it didn't effect the taste.  It was wonderful!

This made a lot, even scaling it in half.  I used all nonfat milk instead of the heavy cream and it was good, but not as creamy as other versions I've had so next time I will try with cream.  I liked all the cinnamon, but adjust it to your tastes.

I was nervous about the amounts based on other reviews...saying it didn't thicken. It totally DID!
YOU CAN SAFELY USE TINY CHEF'S AMOUNTS!
I halved the recipe, and used 5 cups of milk rather than 6, and added 1/2 cup + 2 T. rice. Won't do that again! We like a combo of custard and rice, but wound up with a VERY thick pudding of mostly rice.
It still tasted delish!
Use a short grain rice, and stir a lot whilst it cooks. (thickens and gets creamy like a risotto) Also, a lot of the water in the milk cooks off if you leave it uncovered whilst the rice is cooking, which helps thicken your pudding.
Gotta go for the whole milk and heavy cream. I used only 3 egg yolks, as I do for vanilla pudding. If your eggs and cream are at room temperature they're easier to temper.
I threw in a handful of raisins for hubby when I added the tempered mixture, and 2 t. vanilla at the end of cooking.
Used all the sugar...after all, it's dessert! I did add cinnamon to rice and milk, as we like it that way.
Next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time!) I'll follow your milk and rice ingredients to a T, TINYCHEF. Thanks, and well done, you!

Very very good. I was raised on boiled rice pudding, so I know how it should be. This is an excellent recipe that would be pretty hard to mes up - even for a novice cook. Personally, I add cinnamon sticks rather than ground cinnamon (while it's cooking). Add the vanilla last thing so that it doesn't "cook off."  YUMMY!

the first time I made this it turned out great allthough in the furture I will use a little more rice and add the cinnamon and sugar at the same time to prevent the cinamon from clumping. I had to give most of it away or I would have ate it all by myself.

By far the best rice pudding recipe I have ever tried ... I use let over rice and heavy cream or better yet whipping cream and bake it in the oven for a nice even browning along the top ... Cuts like a pie ... Love it! I add raisins (1/2 cup) and use less sugar and it turns out fabulous every time

I followed the directions about the eggs being gradually introduced with some of the hot mixture, but it still winded up having pieces of yellow egg.
Also, this was too much liquid/pudding and not enough texture/rice. I suggest doubling the rice.

I cut the recipe in half but followed to the letter.  Used whole milk and heavy cream but it did not get thick.  I made for my father-in-law and he loved the flavor and thankfully my mother-in-law figured out to put it in the oven to thicken it.  I must have done something wrong but I can't figure out what.

I just made this and it is absolutely divine!  I can't wait to taste it tomorrow when it has been refrigerated.  
I used coconut oil instead of butter, so no need for vanilla.  Added a yummy accent.  I also misread the directions.  I added the sugar before the milk and rice mixture simmered.  Everything turned out fine.  Thank you so much!  Definitely worth the time.  Excuse me while I go back to my warm pudding!

I've been making rice pudding for over 20 years, but I decided to try for one creamier than before.  This recipe is EXCELLENT!  However, it boils over very easily in step #1, so use a VERY large pot!  Tinychef is right--this recipe is well worth a little extra time.

This is so delicious I have made it twice now and have gotten compliments from all the guests.
It really makes a lot so the 2nd time I cut the recipe in half. 
Do put in all the cinnamon and I added raisins.

I followed this recipe to a tee -- I even used whole milk instead of skim -- and it came out runny.  I do not recommend this recipe unless you like rice soup.

Help me!!  I followed the recipe exactly and in came out very liquidy.  It was in the fridge for over 5 hours.  Did I ruin it by using margarine instead of butter,  minute rice instead of grain, or was I suppose to cover it in the fridge?  It taste great I was just looking for a more custard texture!

After following this recipe as written, I wound up with hard rice on the bottom & the liquid on the top....even with stirring. Turned temperature to high, then added some milk after a while & cooked it much longer to cook the rice through.  Wound up with pasty texture & rice still hard in spots. Would really rate this zero stars & would not recommend it or make it again. Also learned a valuable lesson when using recipes on here.....read the reviews FIRST!  :-)

I have made this recipe twice now, and it is by far the BEST rice pudding I have ever had. Creamy & delicious only begins to describe it. It is just the right consistency,  and I added raisins right at the end of cooking. TinyChef, you done good!!

Excellant recipe. I love the cinnamony taste, the wife was not so keen, adjust accordingly. Still prefer baked custard rice pudding, but this is a keeper for certain occasions. It is EASY and I will add the raisins and reduce the cinnamon the next time I make it.

This was amazing! I've been looking for a recipe that is like Kozy Shack Rice pudding and this is almost a perfect match. All I changed was I didn't use cinnamon and I added a few teaspoons of Vanilla right at the end of cooking.

We really like this creamy rice pudding. This recipe makes a huge batch. I cut the sugar and cinnamon in half and I find it plenty sweet enough. I add about 3/4 cup of raisins during the simmering and add a tsp of vanilla with the egg mixture. Rich and delish!

this recipe frickin' rocks!!! I get recipes here all the time but I actually created an account just so I could leave a review about this. It does take a lot of time, I used the amount of cinnamon recommended, 2% milk, only 1 1/3 cups sugar and also added vanilla and raisins. I'm trying to not peak at the 'nutritional values' because the almost overflowing 9x13 pan currently in the fridge is about to be missing---wow!!

way too much milk for the amount of rice used.  Was too runny, more like soup consistency.  Plus, it was way too sweet.  Rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan while cooking,  will not waste my time giving it another try. (which took close to an hour to make) I'll keep looking for an edible rice pudding.

I have made this recipe a few times.  It is always thick and creamy.  I have cut down on the cinnamon.  I only use 1Tbsp and I add 1tsp of vanilla.  Because of the other comments saying to definitely use the heavy cream and whole milk, I do and I've never had a problem.

Made this for dessert for Christmas dinner. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I did use 1%milk because that's all we use, and only 1 cup of sugar and it was perfectly sweet for us. I made day before and let sit if fridge overnight. I would strongly recommend making this if you like rice pudding!!!

Recipe is great. I have a few tweaks. For thick, creamy style, I did 20-22 mins on medium heat. SUPER thick but remember your adding more milk and butter. Also I like my raisins super soft so I cooked an extra 4 minutes, also when taking off the burner I let it sit in the pot while stirring for an additional 5 minutes. I'll add a little cinnamon on top and it will be perfect!

Delicious. Due to some others comments that it didn't thicken I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch. I used 2% milk and half and half for the cream. It came out perfectly.

I have to believe that there is an error it the ingredients list somewhere.  If you use 3 quarts of milk with one cup of rice there is just no way that this pudding will set.  I did try it exactly as written.  Even after reading other comments, I just could not get this recipe to work.  I thought maybe the recipe meant 3 CUPS of milk instead of 3 QUARTS; but then that still did not sound right, because it calls for 2 cups of sugar which would make it awfully sweet.  I have finally given up on this one; which is really too bad, as I wanted to like it.

I agree with most that the cinnamon is too much.  I added an 1/8 of a tsp with the milk/rice mixture and then added more at the end.  My first try came out brown.  But very tasty and easy recipe.

It came out more slimy than like a custard. Very weird consistency. It's possible I didn't do it right though.

Very good rice pudding! My kids gobbled up their portions. The total amount was a lot more than I realized so I even took about a 1/4 and added ice water and blended it together then strained the rice to make a rice drink (similar to Horchata). So good! Thanks!!
