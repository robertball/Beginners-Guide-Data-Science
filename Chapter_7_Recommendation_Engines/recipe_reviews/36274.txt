I love Chicken Caesar Salad, and this is most certainly one of the best recipes I've tried.
THANKS!  Very easy to put together, and the flavor is wonderful.

I thought this was terrible. The flavor was not good at all. Too much vinegar!

This is the best salad recipe ever! It has ruined my restaurant experience because this one is so excellent! The seasoning makes all the difference and the ingredients make the flavors pop!

The chicken is awesome.  I haven't made the dressing yet because I was a little skeptical about it.  But after seeing how good the chicken was I'll definitely try the whole recipe!

This was a good quick salad. The salad dressing turned out better than I thought it would. I will make again

I used some mayo, garlic, and lemon juice for the dressing. I like the seasoning on the chicken. Very tasty.

LOVE this recipe.  Lemon pepper and garlic salt go so well together on both meats and veggies.  The key in this recipe is not draining the oil from the chicken and including it in the dressing.

I WOULD MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.  USED CIDER VINEGAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE WHITE WINE VINEGAR AND ONLY 1 TSP OF THE SEASONING SALT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH.  VERY EASY AND FAST.  MY DAUGHTER, HUSBAND AND I ATE EVERY BITE.

I swear, NJ has the weirdest weather; we froze all month and then swapped it out for ninety degree, humid, yucky July weather. AC had to be repaired to I opted for this almost no cook salad recipe. I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar and added a bit of mayo to make the dressing creamy. Refreshing and good.
