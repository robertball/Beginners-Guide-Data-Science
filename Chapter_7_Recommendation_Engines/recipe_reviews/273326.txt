Other than adjusting the serving size of the recipe and using chardonnay instead of white cooking wine I made this recipe as written. The results were delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Cut the red pepper flakes in half (1/2 teas. not 1)
Needed more sauce.   Double the wine, butter and lemon juice.

Forgot to include the red pepper flakes before the broiling stage, but worked out to add them after.  Paired with Chateau St Michelle Chardonnay on advice of a good wine advisor.  My daughter loved it!

Very good and fairly easy to make, The only negative I have is just how much, uncooked spaghetti is 2 cups?

I’m fond of shrimp scampi and this turned out great! My wife isn’t a fan of angel hair pasta, so I always use rotini for scampi. It holds the oil and spices well. The addition of the cheese and bread crumbs gave the dish a nice boost in flavor and texture. I baked it in a loaf pan briefly then finished with a quick broil. Fantastic recipe!

My husband was crazy about this !  Will add a bit more liquid next time.  And there will definitely be a next time! Love the topping of cheese and cumbs.  I will be making this for company in a couple of weeks.  Great recipe!

Very tasty & yes, we will make it again.  After reading other reviews I changed the following:  5 oz. of angel hair pasta worked for us; to lower fat a bit I used 6 Tbsp. butter divided in 2 parts; I cut bread crumbs and Parmesan to 1/2 cup each; and we used about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  We also used drinking white wine.  Everything else was great!

I followed the instructions and found it quite dry. The bread crumbs soaked up all the liquid. Perhaps the topping should just be sprinkled and not mixed in. Even then, it needs a lot more liquid.

Really very good.  I forget the cheese had a divided use but I'll remember next time. Very nice, light, lemony flavor.

A little too much bread crumbs and cheese. If I were to make it again, I’d probably cut those both in half.

I’ll definitely make this again!!  I used tail-on shrimp, and that was a mistake, but the flavor was fantastic.   I used a half box of angel hair pasta since I didn’t know what 2 cups would be: I just multiplied the pasta serving size by 4 (the number of people this recipe said it serves), and that turned out to be approx half a pound of pasta.  Worked out really well.  i also made the skillet part up to taking it off the heat, then made the pasta since I heard a chef say once that sauce can wait, but pasta cannot :)

Omg this was amazing and super simple.  We are not big pasta eaters by any means but I will def make it again! Did double the sauce as someone mentioned and went heavy on the garlic. Used half the red pepper flakes and it was perfect!

So delicious! I used chardonnay instead of cooking wine, cilantro instead of parsley, and corn flakes crumbs instead of bread crumbs, because that's what I had. I'd do it the same way next time!

I made it but instead of adding the bread crumbs and roasting to coat the top I stopped at adding the shrimp scampy with the pasta and adding the cheese and eat It that way which was great.

The whole family absolutely loved it!  We used panko bread crumbs and it got nice and crunchy under the broiler.  Will probably cut down the amount of red pepper flakes next time -- maybe half.  Was a bit too spicy for us.  Other than that -- delicious!

I cheated, I used frozen, cooked shrimp.  It was very tasty but a little dry.  I’m not sure why.  I love Scampi and it was good not to have it swimming in butter.  The lemon and red pepper gave it a great kick.  My husband really liked it too.

This is definitely a keeper!! Quick, fairly easy, nice presentation and absolutely delicious! Only had Japanese panko so just added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning which worked beautifully. Topped with shredded Italian cheese blend instead of straight Parmesan. Perfection

This was delicious. We read some of the reviews and took the advice of adding more sauce. We doubled the garlic, added 50% more wine and butter and left the lemon juice the same. We also added a touch of creole seasoning. Our 4 year old loves shrimp and ate an adult sized portion without much fuss. Thanks for a great recipe and great tips.

Not crazy about this one. Taste was good, but texture wasn’t great with the Parmesan on top. Next time I’ll skip that step.

While my husband has been recovering from shoulder surgery, it’s been my time to do the cooking. This was my most adventuresome attempt, and it turned out great, even though I let the topping burn a little under the broiler. Even without the yummy shrimp, the pasta would have been great. I followed the recipe exactly.

Use de tailed shrimp. Used 1 teaspoon salt free creole seasoning.  Did not use the second ¼ cup of butter to cut down on fat but recipe ended up too dry.

I forgot to pick up red flakes so I used ground chili and Cajun seasoning. I used spaghetti squash instead of angel hair pasta. It is amazing and I will definitely make this again!!!

My husband loves shrimp, but not angel hair pasta, so I made this with rigatoni.  It came out perfect!  He raved about it.  Will make it again.

Absolutely delicious as is.  Doubled the recipe for 8 people and it turned out great.  I put my too close to the broiler so next time, the rack will be put on the next lower rack.

Really enjoyed this. I had 8 big eaters, so made this for 10. Mixed messages in these reviews re how to measure the dry pasta, so I just went with a 16 oz package (per the package, it's 8 servings, but it worked). Doubled everything except sauce, which I increased. I used sauvignon blanc wine. I have a nice big broiler pan and put the entire batch in that when it was set to go, leaving lots of room to top with the bread crumb mixture. Rave reviews!

Made this and loved it.
Added lemon zest from the lemon used for juice and added chicken broth as others suggested(8oz). Three typing takes this to the next level. DH loved it. Added a large handful of power greens when mixing all ingredients together instead of just parsley.

Utensils free.  I used GF pasta.  We also doubled the sauce so the leftovers wouldn’t be too dry.

This was delicious and even great as leftovers.  The red peppers give it quite a kick so if you don’t want it to be spicy skip the peppers.

Family loved it. 
I personally just think I like store bought shrimp scampi better. I have tried making it from several different recipes & this seems to be the one thing that I can’t make better. 
I also used zoodles instead of spaghetti.

We loved this dish!  I added 4 ounces of sliced mushrooms, sautéing them with the shrimp and garlic.   Be careful not to overcook the angel hair pasta.

This is a great one-dish dinner for the entire family.  The recipe as written is mild in flavor.  The addition of pepper flakes helps and adding a bit more garlic wouldn't hurt.

This was a very quick and easy recipe but has lots of flavor! I left off the cooking wine because I didn’t have any, and added some lime juice along with the lemon. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious, lots of flavor!  Only change was to reduce the red pepper flakes by half.  Best to put in a shallow oven proof dish under broiler to spread out the topping.  Watch  it closely, it  browns quickly!   Look forward to making again.

Instead of regular breadcrumbs, I used “Dot’s Homestyle Pretzel Rub” this added more crunch and flavor.

Nothing special. Used 4oz of pasta which made two large servings.  Used 3/4c bread crumbs and felt it was too much.  Recipe does not warrant experimentation as the overall flavor was a disappointment and shrimp was expensive.  I would recommend finding a different recipe.

Too salty. Delicious without the last step of cheese and breadcrumbs. Don’t need it.

I did not care at all for the bread crumbs. Fortunately I had made too mush pasta so I picked the shrimp out and added it to the extra pasta along with a bit of olive oil and more butter some garlic powder and more parsley. It was okay. Won't do it again however.

I will make it again but will cut back on the bread crumb topping, I thought it was to much, I cut the shrimp in pieces but only because we had large jumbo shrimp, but we had no left overs which is a lot to say.  The flavor was great.

So good!  Love the little dash of red pepper spike to it! Be careful to NOT over broil!  I should have lowered my oven rack because I burnt a little bit of the bread crumb mixture; but scraped it off and no one knew! It’s a hit with this family!

An absolutely brilliant recipe! I love the extra texture of it. Such a subtle change but such a difference. Wouldn't change a thing! Thanks!
