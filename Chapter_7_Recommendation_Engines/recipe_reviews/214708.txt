This is a great recipe as but I did need to make a couple of changes.  To reduce the sodium, I only used one pickle and instead of the pickle juice, I used vinegar.  My family does not like cilantro so I used a combo of fresh parskey, basil and thyme for the herbs.   A great picnic friendly recipe since it needs no refrigeration.

Great stuff!  I used parsley instead of cilantro, about 1/8 cup red onion instead of 2 green onions, added about 1/2 tsp of celery salt, and doubled the pickle & celery.. Yum!

I am testing this recipe this weekend - preparing for that July 4th bash.  I am eager to try it as I LOVE Dill and would like to use less mayo dishes this year :) Will update next week. -UPDATE - A HUGE HIT.  Excellent recipe - I did have to make one tiny change i used one dill pickle and two smaller sweet pickles because it was what I had on hand - this was truly marvelous thanks so much Laura N.  your potato salad is on the official 4th of July Barbecue Party!

I am allergic to soy so this recipe fit the bill for me.  No mayo makes it healthier also.  I had 12 people for dinner and followed the recipe exactly.  It was a big hit and I am enjoying the leftovers.

3.5, used a combination of white nugget and baby red potatoes.  Also added more celery and green onion.  Miss my mayo potato salad but will try and get hooked on this healthier version!!!

This has the perfect amount of crunch from the celery and pickles and the dressing is yummy. I've never been a huge fan of mayo dressed salads so this hit the spot for me. I did leave out the cilantro since that seemed odd with the other ingredients. It doesn't have a very appetizing appearance  due to the dull green of the pickles combined with the pinkish dressing (from the paprika). I think if I brought it to a party people would look at it suspiciously and it would sit untouched! No problem if you're not taking it on the road though.

Wow, fantastic, a huge thank you, I have been looking for a dairy free potato salad for a long time, as I miss it.. This tastes great, the only thing I changed was the dressing, I added a non dairy french dressing..And I also tried it with your dressing also good..

I just made this recipe for a Baby Shower and everyone loved it! As suggested in a couple other reviews, I did make some changes: I used 1/4 cup olive oil, apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, 1 large dill pickle processed in food processor, no pickle juice, instead of cilantro I used the following: 1 tablespoon thyme, 1/2 tablespoon basil and 1 tsp. sage. I also cut the potatoes in small cubes of about 1/2 inch square and everyone commented on how nice that was, easier to eat and the dressing coats each square. I highly recommend this recipe!

I love this recipe! I make it as is with the exception of omitting the cilantro, simply because I donâ€™t like it.

I didn't make any changes, and I didn't have any cilantro on hand. However, I did add chopped boiled egg at the end. It was delicious even without the cilantro.  A great and flavourful alternative to mayo. Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe, especially because it is a healthier version than the traditional versions. I added 4 hard boiled eggs as well to make it more like a traditional potato salad. I made it last night and am making it again today because I have been craving it all day!

We've made this several times.  We discovered that 1/2 cup of oil made it pretty greasy so we've reduced it to 2 tablespoons and added garlic. Otherwise VERY good.

Thanks so much for this recipe--just recently had a pretty severe allergic reaction to eggs, so this is a great way to still enjoy potato salad. I used sweet pickles instead of dill since I had them on hand, and added a bit more onion. I think this would also be good using kidney beans instead of potato to decrease the carbs and increase the fiber.  Going to try that next time!

I served this to my family for dinner tonight with grilled burgers. Made a few modifications and will make again with a couple other tweaks. I left out the cilantro and used parsley instead. Also left out the pickles and just used pickle juice and subbed vidalia onion for the green onion (but only bc that's what I had on hand). I thought there was too much dressing but I didn't use quite as many potatoes as recipe called for. Even knowing that, I will back off on the EVOO and use a little less pickle juice next time. I will also try using champagne vinegar just bc we like it. I may even try balsamic vinegar another time. We did enjoy this no mayo potato salad though!

This was just ok. The vinegar was too much, and I didn't even add in the entire 1/4 cup. It would have been better without the vinegar or with just a dash. The other ingredients went well together, I'm hoping it will taste better tomorrow after being in the fridge all night.

Very good! I always make a few mods, but this hit the spot and I didn't miss the mayo/calories.
