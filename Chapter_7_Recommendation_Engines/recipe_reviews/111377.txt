The cream filling elevates this dessert to a great level, it goes so well with the strawberries and with coconut also.  However, the first time I tried baking the cake, it was overcooked, dry, and brownish after only 45 minutes.  Luckily I had enough ingredients left for a second cake, so I tried again and watched it very closely!  At 35 minutes, the cake was almost perfectly done, especially when you consider that it will continue to cook a bit longer until removed from the pan.  It turned out to be a delicious dessert and we will look forward to having it again.

I ran out of time to bake the scratch cake in this recipe so I made a marble cake (2 - 8" rounds) from a box.  But this frosting is AWESOME!!  I used my stand mixer and modified the recipe to use only 8 oz of room temp low-fat cream cheese, 1/2 tsp Watkins double strength vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract -- and I forgot the salt (oops)!  The whole thing came together in less than one minute -- it was amazing!  Instead of having a "torte" with multiple layers frosted only in-between, I laid down a thin layer of the frosting on the 1st layer of cake with my silicone spatula, arranged split strawberries on it and then covered it with another thin layer of frosting.  Then I topped with my 2nd layer of marble cake and frosted the whole thing, top and sides -- I used the spatula for the whole operation, it's a very forgiving frosting.  Add a few strawberries on top and VOILA!  Guests said it was the best cake they'd ever eaten and most zeroed right in on this frosting!  I was amazed at how well this cake/frosting held up to room temperature, not like a whipped cream frosting normally would.  This will now be a family standard -- easy, quick and absolutely yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this cake and it has been requested for our families 4th of July cookout. The only thing I changes was that I took another quart of straberries and I sprinkled them with sugar and then after sitting for awhile I smashed them. I put the halved berries around the edges of the layers and the some of the smashed berries in the middle. Some of the juice soaked into the cake and make it quite tasty.

My excellent cook mother-in-law and the whole family totally loved it. Met their standards and is asking me to do it one more time! Just let it cook for 40mins at 170Â°C and comes out excellent. I used just half the cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar for the icing and added some melted white chocolate on the cake itself.  Perfect.

I followed the recipe as directed and I have never tasted something like this in my life, we opted to take off the whiped cream and starwberries and just ate that. I was disappointed with this recipe the cake was dry and had a very funky taste to it

I thought this was a great recipe! I ended up baking it in a rectangle pan and just cutting the cake into three pieces but my friends couldn't stop raving about this cake and truly enjoyed it. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that you don't need as much sugar in the actual icing because the cake itself it so sweet with the strawberries.

This was a beautiful and easy cake to make. The taste I found was to heavy. Next time I will use half of the cream cheese and more sugar in the icing. Also be careful not to over cook the cake.

I have to agree with many of the previous reviews; the cake not only is too heavy but also recommended 50 min bake time is way too long. This cake almost may be better with a yellow box cake mix instead and having the strawberries sliced and not just halved.

I really don't like people who write bad reviews however I just did not care for this recipe.  The cake was much much too heavy for my family.

EXXXXcellent!! I also hate people who give negative reviews. To the person who gave 1 star because it was "way too rich"; did you READ the ingredients? Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday. Everyone LOVED it...I doubled the recipe and made a 4 layer cake using 9" round pans. I cut way back on the sugar (don't know exact amount I used..just did it by taste). The only problem I had was, although I used 4 dowels to hold it upright, the cake ended up looking like the Leaning Tower of Piza. The frosting just wasn't sturdy enough. No one cared though. It was a good chuckle and a yummy cake!

I do not recommend this as a substitute for strawberry shortcake as it is too heavy and sweet.

I was not impressed at all, total waste of money, ingredients and time.  The cake was very sweet and the topping never formed.  I ended up throwing this out.  I am in search of the perfect strawberry shortcake and this is far from it. It may taste ok with a chocolate frosting, but nothing that is to sweet as the cake is sweet enough.

I found the cake to be too heavy. Comments were made that it was tasty but too bready.  A lighter cake would be better matched. 
The whipped topping was light and refreshing with strawberries. 
Note about the whipped topping. If you find that you over mixed and it starts getting "grainy", it can be salvaged. Simply add a couple more tablespoons of heavy cream (1tbsp at a time) and mix BY HAND. If you mixed to the point that it started getting lumpy, you cannot salvage it. Start again.  Do not multi-task while you are mixing the whipped topping. :)

This cake turned out darker than I expected. I checked it at 30 and ended up going about 38 min. Turned down my oven to 325 the last 10 min. It was good though.

This cake is so tasty!  Definitely do not use a boxed cake mix or you are missing out on a ton of flavor.  I do suggest spreading the whip cream first and then adding the strawberries on all three layers.  It is much easier.
