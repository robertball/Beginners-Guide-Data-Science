LOVE this recipe! I used whole wheat penne pasta and instead of garlic salt on the chicken i used garlic powder. This is definitely going in my recipe box for future meals!! :)

Save a step - cook your asparagus with your pasta. Just throw it in the last 4 minutes of cooking. Drain and add butter, Parmesan, chicken (I used leftover from a rotisserie), and I also added a little milk for creaminess and fresh pepper. I like these flavors and did not find it bland at all. Super quick weeknight meal. Literally on the table in 30 minutes.

This was a quick simple, tasty dish. I added grape tomatoes, halved and fresh garlic at the end of cooking the asparagus. Flavor came from the fresh ingredients. I also sprinkled with a little crushed red pepper. Yum!

This was so good!! I sauteed the chicken instead of doing it in the oven and I steamed the asparagus as well, then I through everything else together. It was a hit with my family. Thanks for the great recipe

I made this dish and it was wonderful!  I made it according to the recipe but added sauteed mushrooms and it also needed a little milk/cream to make a bit of sauce.  It was wonderful.

As I write this review my husband is having his third serving. That definitely earns five stars.  I chose to saute the chicken as it was already too warm in my kitchen to warrant turning on the oven. This was very tasty. I did use some extra olive oil and a little pasta water to keep it from drying out. This is a keeper and I'll definitely be making it again!

So it is a very quick & delicious recipe! While cooking the chicken  I cooked pasta to save time . Also started cooking asparagus towards end of cooking time for pasta & chicken to also save time rather than doing one step at a time !

Chicken & Asparagus with Penne Haiku: "This sounded so good. But the taste was kinda 'meh.' Doubt I'd make again." Saved myself some extra clean-up by doing the chicken in a skillet with garlic cloves (skipped the garlic salt), and butter, removing it to stay warm, and adding the asparagus. Tossing everything together w/ the parmesan and the penne resulted in a pretty plate, but the taste wasn't fantastic. We had to add more cheese and red pepper flakes at the table, but the leftovers were sadly discarded. :(

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I didn't have any asparagus handy, so I used green and yellow beans and cut them down to bite size. I had whole wheat rotini pasta, so I use that too. I also topped the dish with shredded pepper jack (love to be spicy), and added home grown tomatoes "maters" to the side. Can't wait to follow original recipe :)  I posted a picture too!

This recipe sounds good, but I wasn't thrilled with the results. It was quick and easy though. Just slightly bland and a bit boring. I even added tomatoes and real garlic and it still lacked a little something. Probably won't be trying this one again.

We love it.  I like to double the asparagus and the parmesan.  It is so good that we never have left overs.

I love finding new ways to use asparagus so I couldn't wait to try this!  I used whole wheat penne, replaced the butter with olive oil and the garlic salt with garlic powder / minced garlic and added black pepper and a touch of cayenne pepper to the chicken before baking.  I mixed the cooked chicken in with the asparagus for the last couple minutes in the saute pan then added it all to the pasta.  Very good, I'll definitely make it again!

Great pasta dish!  I did added 4 cloves real crushed garlic and drizzled a little EVOO on the pasta.  I didn't add butter.  I didn't put garlic powder on the chicken.  I also doubled the parmesan cheese.  Next time I would just not add parmesan cheese to the dish and grate some on top of the individual servings to make it stand out and not add as much. I didn't find it bland , although I used real garlic and more cheese.  Most importantly, my three kids would eat this.

This is a nice, light recipe.  I had to alternate the asparagus with what I had on hand (broccoli, peppers and mushrooms).  Flavor was awesome.

My sweet heart really liked the asparagus with the chicken.  It was very rich.   I used a little cream to make it a creamer sause.  I would like to try it with brocoli which I like better than asparagus.  Try it! We gave it a 4 star.

It was okay as presented.  However, I found that when making it in smaller amounts such as we do for just the two of us I cook the pasta in low sodium chicken broth (14 oz can for 5 oz pasta) then steam the asparagus in the remaining broth.

I made it today with some leftover breast from a smoked chicken and added some fresh basil at the end.  Yummy.

Next time I add some fresh mushrooms.

I'm not sure what was missing from this dish, but the flavor was very bland.  I even sauteed the asparagus with real diced up garlic cloves and used fresh shredded Asiago cheese as well.  No one in my family hated this, but they didn't really enjoyed it either.  I have a feeling the leftovers will go to waste.  Disappointing!

It was good however not moist enough for me. Was thinking if I made it again would boil chicken in water and chicken broth and add to pasta when it's done.

This was great! I added cherry tomatoes (halved and sautéed in EVOO) and omitted the parmesan cheese. I also added a touch more olive oil. Thanks for recipe!

Definitely worth trying...I made a different version, using broccoli and it came out delicious. Only one suggestion...needs more oil and garlic! Def more garlic! But then again, I LOVE garlic!

Made this is half the time, added a pinch more garlic because we love the stuff! Turned out great! Even the picky toddler asked for more!

Just okay, nothing special.  It needed a lot more garlic and my family found that the only thing that gave the dish any flavor was the cheese. Would not bother to make it again.

Pretty good.  Needs a lot of garlic.  Make sure to use fresh parmesan.

Cooked chopped onion in garlic in olive oil in skillet. Added salt, pepper, and milk and parmesan cheese until thick, while pasta and asparagus were cooked in the same spot.  Yummy way to use up leftover asparagus!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! There was enough for leftovers too! For as plain as it sounds, it is very flavorful. Will definitely make it again.
