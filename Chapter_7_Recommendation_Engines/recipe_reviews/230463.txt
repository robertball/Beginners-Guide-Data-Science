This is a terrific jam butter cookie.  I did do a couple things different.  Instead of walnuts, I used a half cup of ground almonds.  I also added 1/4 tsp of almond flavoring to enhance the almond flavor.  My kids don't like white chocolate, so I just dusted the cookies with powdered sugar instead.  They were a big hit at a church function!

These are amazing. I'm not a big fruit cookie person, but these are some of the best cookies I have ever eaten. The cookies do not come out shaped as perfect as in the pic. The jelly sometimes melts over the side of the cookie onto the pan. The bigger you make the cookie, the more irregular shaped it will be. I wanted more white chocolate for the tops so I melted 3 (4oz) bars and it was to die for.

My daughter and I just made a batch of these (with some variations) and they are fabulous! We omitted the walnuts and made our own fillings/toppings. They baked up beautifully and will be perfect to deliver to our neighbors for Christmas! We filled ours with some strawberry jam, christmas  nonpareils,  red and green sprinkles, and some hershey kisses.

I would make this again, I halved the recipe ,  the dough did  not hold together so I added another quarter cup of butter ,note ,  I did not add the nuts either . I did microwave the dough a few seconds to get it to hold together . They were great .
