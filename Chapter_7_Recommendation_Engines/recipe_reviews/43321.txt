These were not good at all. My family wouldn't even eat them and I thought my husband would eat anything! Maybe to many eggs?

These were great! I made chicken dumpling soup and it was so tasty. For the soup I used water, chicken bullion, chicken soup base, carrots, green beans, corn, chicken breast and sage, sweet basil leaf and pepper to flavor. I boiled about 5 min. longer with the lid on- make sure you do not peek at your dumplings while they are cooking with the lid on- they will turn out better. I will make these again.

I am German, actually born in Germany, and I never heard of dumplings made this way. They weren't very good either.

These are wonderful dumplings. I followed the recipe exactly making no changes.  I make these for my husband who loves dumplings.  They are good with soups and stews.

I am giving this a four stars for texture,which was very good and light, however I am questioning why the flour measure for the cup is listed twice? I did not need the second measure of flour.

These are great!!  My grandmother is from Germany and these are exactly the same as hers!  I just couldn't remember the recipe...or find it for that matter.  She pretty much kept her recipe box in her head and now she's gone, so here I am searching!  Anyway...as another poster said, this does make a good portion of dumplings.  (Or maybe just a few really BIG dumplings?)  Anyway, I did add 3 tbs. of dried parsley to the dough, and yep!  Just like Grandma's!!  THANK YOU!!

The ultimate recipe; thx for sharing. I added a few of my own touches (minced onion, parsley flakes and baking powder).  This is not saying the recipe is not perfect just the way it it, however, because it is. I also microwave bacon and crumble some in when I want just a little change.  I am grateful for you sharing this recipe of your grandmas, Jonell.  (Those along with the mom's recipes are the best by far!)  Everyone marveled over the Dumplings and they did not last long at all!

Maybe I didn't do it right.  I don't know what kind of flour I had.  I live in China so I can't just ask is this all purpose?  I mean i get it from a big open bin at the supermarket.  All I can tell you is its white and doesn't have dried fruit in it.  Anyhow I need to find something that works better so I don't think I'll make this again.

I just didn't care for the texture of these. They didn't taste bad but I thought they were eggy.

These were very good, exactly like my grandmother used to make.  I used a large 7 quart pot and when I was ready to cook the dumplings, I brought the soup up to a light boil and then dropped the batter into the soup using a cookie scoop.  It took a few minutes to do it this way, but it was worth it because I got perfect sized dumplings that did not stick together because one dumpling would cook before another one was dropped in next to it.  Thanks.

I had been looking for this dumpling recipe for years!!  My mom always made homemade noodles.  I knew what I wanted but I couldn't find it.  After using this recipe for soup my husband said "looks like you finally found the perfect dumpling"

I too had a German grandmother who added dumplings to soups/stews.  I made these up and added the dumplings to the Chicken Stew (Fricot) recipe and the dumplings were a huge hit at my house.

I need a grandmother's touch with these. They were good but I'm partial to matzah dumplings.

I destroyed these!  I didn't look at the number of servings and since I've never made dumplings before, I didn't know how big they'd get!  I needed maybe 1/4 of what the recipe makes.  I added them to chicken soup, followed the recipe, and it turned into a burnt chicken..slop.  So just remember that this recipe makes a lot!

I hadn't had dumplings in years.  But this is not how I remember them.  These were tough and lumpy.  No one ate them.  I would not use this recipe again.

I really loved these! My grandmother used to make these as well. I did not use the second cup of flour. They turned out perfect! Not sure if the second cup is needed or to be used if you need more because you didn't thicken the mixture enough? The recipe never mentions the second cup. I have made them more than once and even when the dough is more runny when you drop them into the boiling soup all is well! Perfect texture!

i used a gluten free flour, because i have gluten intolerance, and they came out fantastic!!! i boiled them in water right next to a pot of cream of chick soup and just plopped them in when they were ready and cooked them the rest of the way in the soup. I also seasoned the mixture with black pepper, paprika, and thyme before i boiled them. so good.

I recommend using 2 cups of flour, the dough seemed a little runny with only 1 cup. Simmer dumplings until about five minutes after the start to float. These were delicious, the texture was wonderful. I will make these again!

My mother,who is German, makes her dumplings this way. The only difference is she adds the german Maggie into the mix and a tiny bit of melted butter. They are amazing. I make them for the soup we have before our Christmas dinner every year and it is always a hit with my husband's family and our friends. If they turn out too eggy or thin you are doing something wrong. I cut this recipe in half for mine and just make smaller dumplings. I then wait until the soup is boiling hot to add the mixture.

They were Okay but not worth the effort. I've made better with much less work, time and mess.
I never did find what the extra cup of flour was for? Maybe to thicken the dough depending on how big the eggs are?

I didn't really like these a whole lot - they were all right.  My husband thought they were similar to ones he had as a kid, but he didn't seem to be all that thrilled with them either.
