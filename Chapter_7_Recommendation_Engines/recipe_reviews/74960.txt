This is probably the first recipe I've tried strictly because of the glowing reviews, because I have to admit that the idea of mixing up this salad with melted butter just seemed wrong to me. I had visions of the butter solidifying and giving the salad a greasy mouthfeel.  NOT.  This was just delicious--rich and creamy, and what I liked the best is that the mayonnaise doesn't overpower the salad as it can have a tendency to do in mayo-based salads.  Other than adding some chopped celery for crunch, I didn't change a thing and it did not disappoint. I served this as a wrap, using large flour tortillas and shredded Romaine lettuce.  My only complaint is when I tallied up just how much two lobster wraps set us back!  This was definitely a decadent, luxurious and delicious treat!

Lobster Snobs Take Note!!!  This is UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE!!  I love my lobster straight (steamed maybe with melted butter) and rarely have "leftovers" -- but when I did my husband asked for a lobster roll.  I decided to humor him and made this recipe.  It is wonderful, I would not change 1 single thing about it.  The butter gives it a very rich flavor and the mayo does not make it oily or spoil the taste in any way.  I encourage you to try this recipe, and if you don't have a pound of lobster meat, adjust the recipe for what you do have -- you will thank Dennie!
Thank you Dennie!  :)

Wonderful! I'm picky about celery and onions in salads, so this was a refreshing change- I'll definitely stick with it! I used imitation lobster meat (I know, I know)- it's all I had, and chopped it up in the food processor- made stuffing a sandwich a little easier. Kudos!

Treated us to fresh, frozen warm water lobster tails for the cooked lobster meat.  Rich with butter, but not greasy!  Creamy and delicious.  Probably would have preferred this as a lobster roll intstead of the romaine with lemon vinaigrette we served it on (healthier option) but this was such a treat we didn't feel deprived.  Other than adding some sliced celery for a contrast in texture, I followed the recipe just as written.

Yummy Lobster Salad! I agreed with a couple other reviewers and used white pepper, a spritz of lemon juice and a bit of celery seed. So as not to take away from the fabulous lobster flavor, I served a tablespoon and a half in puff pastry tartlet shells that I had prebaked for 5 minutes at 350degrees. The tartlets are served at room temp, however the lobster salad is chilled overnight.

I live in Massachusettes and served this on Christmas Eve and everyone said it was the best Lobser Salad they ever tasted! I think that says it all since all my guests were from New Enland. I followed the recipe except I added A small amount of fresh lemon juice. I trippled the recipe so it cost almost $100 to make, but was worth every penny. I served it on mini croissants and they were a huge hit.

Lobster and butter are a classic match-up…think salt and pepper and peanut butter and jelly.  Visit us in New England and you will find that your lobster roll will consist of lobster with a little mayo and perhaps a little celery served on an exquisitely buttered grilled bun.  Knowing that I have no idea why I was so reluctant to try this take on lobster salad.  I was looking for an elegant but easy appetizer for an Academy Awards party and this salad tucked into wonton cups fit the bill.  I made the salad as directed except that I couldn’t resist adding some finely chopped celery.  For the wonton cups I tucked wonton wrappers into mini muffin cups, brushed them with olive oil and sprinkled them with a little Himalayan sea salt.  I baked them at 350 degrees until browned and crisp, eight to ten minutes.  I made the cups and the salad in advance and filled them right before the party, garnishing with some finely chopped seeded plum tomato.  I have made a lot of lobster salad but I will never make it any other way from here on out.  Worth the splurge!

Yessssss!! The perfect lobster salad, like the ones at my favorite childhood haunts in Maine.  Only difference I'd make is to use white pepper instead of black, or omit entirely. And for the perfect lobster roll, serve in a toasted hotdog roll with a lettuce leaf!

I'm a lobsteraholic, whenever the tails go on sale, I stock up.  I had four tails and instead of serving them alongside steaks, I decided to try them this way.  Very blah, they just tasted like cold lobster with butter and mayo, great if you really like mayo, I guess.  I really had to spice these up, I added a little chopped celery, some green onion, a dash of lemon juice and worcestershire, salt, paprika, thyme, cayenne and fresh tarragon.  A tiny spritze of lousiana hot sauce, mix and let sit for a few more minutes, I served them with slices of avocado on a toasty bun, delectable, but not the same recipe at all.

I love this! I don't make it very often because fresh lobster is so expensive, so it is a rare treat for me! This recipe is worthy of 5 stars or more, if I could rate it higher. Thanks so much for the post! ~Tan~

This was incredible! I made this for lunch with some leftover lobster tails that my husband grilled for dinner the night before. I really didn't bat an eye when the recipe called for melted butter like some of the reviewer, saying it would be greasy. I mean, it just makes sense since lobster is at it's best with melted butter. I did add a little lemon juice just because I love lemon juice with my lobster. I topped this salad on a bed of fresh spinach and cherry tomatoes with a glass of white wine. A lunch fit for a queen.

Delicious and I will make this again soon! I made this for a ladies lunch date, and it was very yummy. I liked that there was not a lot of mayo in this recipe; mayo is usually too overpowering to great New England lobster…it just isn’t necessary. Adding the butter was perfect, and a gem of an idea! I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and add a pinch of dill. I also used black pepper, not white. 
Thanks for posting this recipe!!

This is the only way to make a real Lobster Salad Roll.  It enhances the Lobster, not drowning with a lot of other ingredients.  It reminds me of the Maine Lobster Roll I use to get in Maine,when I lived in New England.

I don't know why I didn't rate this last September when I first made it to serve at a Cousins Brunch I hosted for my mom.  Just couldn't stomach the price of lobster, so used crab.  Added a pinch of Old Bay, finely minced celery and a squeeze of lemon.  Amazing, just amazing!  Am going to make it tonight to serve for Superbowl tomorrow, but with shrimp, the recipe really adapts well to any shellfish.  I can't wait to try this with lobster, I'm sure it will be over the top!  Thank you for sharing, it's a big hit at my house with family and friends!

My husband is a police officer and very often doesn't get to take time out to eat, I wanted to make him something really special so I made this recipe after finding 4 lobster tails marked down and my local grocery. IT WAS OUTSTANDING! I didn't change a thing I loaded the salad onto a nice crusty roll and added plenty of napkins.  He LOVED it!!

Creamy, and simple. I thingy sliced cucumbers to add some crunch.  Also, some lemon pepper sprinkled on top enhanced the flavor.

I love the simple, unadorned flavor of lobster which is why I chose this recipe.  The lobster flavor takes center stage which is just the way I like it.  It’s quite simple, the only time needed is cooking the lobster and removing the meat from the shell.

I was hesitant about the butter and mayo combination but the mayo really smoothed out the butter. Creamy.  I thought it tasted plain at first so I added Old Bay seasoning, sweet onion and bacon!

Absolutely delicious.  I made exactly as written and used for lobster rolls.  I added fresh arugula to the rolls and a spritz of fresh lemon to mine.  We loved this and will make often when we are ready to splurge on lobster.

Without several liberal sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning and a bit of fresh squeezed lemon, this was just ok.  For our tastes, the ratio of mayo and butter was way off.  It did make a very pretty sandwich though.  One good thing about this recipe is that it would be easy to customize for your family's taste.

Eh, it was a bit bland.  I tried a few different spices (garlic, onion powder, etc) before I added some Tony's Creole seasoning.  That was the PERFECT addition.

Thank you, Dennie for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I'm in the Midwest so we don't get a whole lot of premium seafood, so I used what I could get my hands on - frozen lobster.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just amazing!  I won't make lobster salad any other way - except maybe use fresh lobster meat :)

WOW.  What a great recipe! I really had reservations about the melted butter, but it just enhances the very rich flavor.  Alot of people added lemon juice, but I thought rather than adding a liquid, I would just use lemon pepper.  Perfect!  I used celery seed to give it a little bit of that celery flavor, but using a little celery for crunch would be great too.  As well as using a little shallot.   However, don't feel like you need to add anything or make any changes to this recipe, it is brilliant.  I just love the simplicity of this recipe.  So many lobster salad recipes call for fennel or tarragon, which, to me, takes away from the lobster flavor and makes it taste like licorice.  I agree with another reviewer that using a croissant would definitely be best for this recipe.  I also agree adding tomato and lettuce would enhance the flavor, but add it to the sandwich, not to the salad.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

I made this tonight to use a lone left over lobster...I had to modify the amounts of butter and mayo but I have to say this was such an excellent lobster salad. I used lettuce leaves as a wrap, just outstanding. Rich and smooth and sinful! Wish my husband was the same!!

Fabulous!  I added just a LITTLE diced celery, diced onion, chopped dill and lemon juice.  Even BETTER the next day (much more flavor), so if you can make it a day ahead, do so!

love this recipe- so simple...I like to add some dill and a little bit of lemon. It just brightens it up a little without covering up the buttery goodness of the lobster!!

Quite yummy. I got a great deal on steamed NE lobster, but it was cold and I didn't want it risk it turning rubbery if I reheated. This recipe was great for cold lobster. I added a spritz of lemon juice and used white pepper as per other reviews. Kids loved it too (5 & 7yo).

First of all...I'm a lobster lover....for over 50 years....100's of them.
This was initially a disappointment...the 1st day.
The taste was bland.
Overnight marinating in the mayo...butter...made it 100% tastier.
However...definately squeeze in a whole lemon...we made a big batch..
Also...even that next day...on fresh sourdough bread...we spread mayo on each slice....AND.....a slice of lemon squirted over it....only THEN...was this terrific.
Try it both ways and see...but it needs lemon and more mayo on the bread...as the overnight marinating dries it out a bit....and...I almost forgot....mince in a celery...we all said it needed it.

Really quite good.  Surprisingly, the butter does not make the lobster oily, it simply brings out the richness of the lobster.  I did add a bit of lemon juice, maybe 1 tablespoon, plus a little bit of finely chopped celery.  Other than that, I followed it.  It got very good reviews.  Not perfect nor amazing, but really quite good.

THIS RECIPE IS GOOD. I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES THOUGH USED CRAB MEAT INSTEAD OF LOBSTER AS IT WAS ALL I HAD AND USED MIRCLE WHIP INSTEAD OF MAYO. IT WAS A BIT BLAND SO I ADDED A TINY DASH OF OLD BAY AND SALT MUCH BETTER. WILL MAKE AGAIN IF I HAVE LEFTOVER SEAFOOD.

So simple and quick. Per other people reviews I added some fresh lemon juice to the recipe. I decided to substitute Miracle Whip instead of mayo since it is sweeter and I thought it would lend itself to the natural sweetness of the lobster meat. I also added a little pinch of Old Bay seasoning in addition to the pepper. Im still in awe over how easy it was to make a really delicious meal (I ate the Lobster salad on a croissant with some lettuce).

WOW!!!  This is now my favorite lobster salad recipe. I did add a little salt and a very tiny bit of minced celery, but that was it.  The amount of butter and mayo (Best Foods REAL) is perfect...I wouldn't change these measurements.

The perfect blend for lobster - creamy and buttery. I like to add a little dill weed, celery salt, and lemon juice, too...just for an added touch. Great recipe.

SO good! I had a little less than 1/2 lb of lobster meat, so I adjusted amounts accordingly. You can really taste the butter, and there's no greasiness or anything else weird going on with the texture. No spices to detract from the good and simple lobster flavor. I just added a little celery for crunch. I had this as a light lunch over some Italian lettuce greens (first drizzled them with a good quality herb-infused olive oil and salt/pepper). Thanks....definitely a keeper recipe!

Very simple and easy to make but to me it needed a little spark of something.  I followed the recipe exactly but if there's a next time I might give it a spritz of lemon juice as  others did.  Got the whole cooked lobster on sale $10 so it wasn't a huge outlay.

This is the first time I made lobster salad and was pleasantly surprised how easy this recipe is to prepare.
After removing all the lobster "meat" from 3 whole cooked lobsters (my friend did the dirty work),I just diced the lobster into small chunks.
It was by far so simple and delicious.  
I think the next time, I will use a little less butter, but other than this change I will make it again.

This was a great recipe.  Even the husband enjoyed it and he doesn't care for lobster salad. I served on a croissant with lettuce and followed other reviews and added a little chopped celery and dill.  Excellent will definately make again. Thanks Dennie for a great recipe!

I would suggest to eat this in a croissant, if you want to get the best of the flavor.  I thought it needed a little something so I would add sweet tomatoes and romaine lettuce to the sandwishes.  My husband was raving about it though.  I will try it chilled tomorrow and with the recommendations given.

I don't know how I could have messed up such an easy recipe, but in the end I wasn't impressed.  I used leftover lobster that was made fresh the day before.  It was ok, not bad, but I don't think it was anywhere near how it's been rated.

Delicious and simple!  I acquired a couple of Maine lobsters from a friend traveling down to visit.  We had something else for dinner but I wanted to cook them the same night anyway, so decided a lobster salad for the next day was the way to go.  This was excellent!  I used white pepper and a small squeeze of lemon juice.  Put it on a buttered toasted hot dog roll (only way to serve it here) and it was just wonderful. Thanks Dennie

This was AWESOME!!  I LOVED it!  It was quick and easy.  I didn't want lots of stuff in my salad, but just mayo would have been plain- this was not plain at all.  I ate it with Club crackers-MMMMMM!

My whole family advised me against adding butter.  They felt it would be too greasy, not traditional enough (we are New Englanders)... but I stuck to the original recipe (except adding a bit of celery) and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was just okay.  The lobster salad lacked flavor; however, I used fresh packaged lobster meat, rather than fresh lobster.  That might have made the difference.

This was very delicious. Not overpowered by mayonnaise. All other lobster salads I have eaten have been to mayonnaisey. I served this on a crusty whole grain bread with just some romaine lettuce and it was a hit. thanks.

I added a little lemon juice and it turned our slightly runny.
