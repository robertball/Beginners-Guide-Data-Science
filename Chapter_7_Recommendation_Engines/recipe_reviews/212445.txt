the meat's flavor is comparable to the tartare at my favorite Eritrean restaurant: YUMMY!    This version as written is about a million times better than Scotch eggs. But I am squeamish about deepfrying in general and ground meat in particular, so I'll continue experimenting with alternative methods.    Good recipe. Thanks for sharing!
