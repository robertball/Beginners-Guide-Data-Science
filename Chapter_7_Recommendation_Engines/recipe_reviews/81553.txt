Very tasty and quick to make.  I omitted the brown sugar. I put a crust on top.  And don't forget to saute onions and garlic with the beef!

I followed the recipe to the letter and this one completely bombed. I think the problem here is there are too many flavors trying to compete. It wasn't bad looking when done but it kind of tasted like the remains of a cookout all mixed together.

This recipe was quick and easy. The boys (4 teenagers) all liked it, but said it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut back or omit the brown sugar. Otherwise a nice change from the usual hot dog fare.

My daughter loved it, but wanted more crust and more hotdogs, I would add the top crust and throw in 5 or 6 dogs instead of 4, it is hotdog pie after all.

I cooked this in a cornmeal crust (like a tamale pie) instead of the pie crust .  At first I didn't like the taco flavor in this, but by the second day the flavors seemed to meld together better.

Very good - my kids loved it!  I omitted the sugar and used brown sugar-flavored baked beans.  Delish!.

Awesome!!! This is our new cookout pie. It combines some of our favorite cook out food.  So when we don't feel like pulling out the grill or weather prohibits, we simply make this cookout pie.

This was yummy! I did change it a little bit. I used a full package of hotdogs and left out the ground beef and added some sweet relish to the bean mix. I did not have any pie crust so instead of serving french fries on the side I poured the been mixture the fries topped with cheese and yummy! I used the small shoe string fries and theynwere perfect for the dish. Served with fresh broccoli and cucumbers with ranch dip.

Sorry, we did not like this one. The beans and the sugar made it too sweet for our taste.
