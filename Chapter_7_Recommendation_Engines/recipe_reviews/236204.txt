This is a nice combo of fruits for a smoothie.  It needs to have at least some of the fruit frozen to reach  what I consider a smoothie consistency, otherwise, what you'll have is a very tasty fruit drink.  You can add some ice to the blender, but that may result in diluting the fruit flavor.

It's a pleasant afternoon fill-in when I'm not in the mood for lunch, and it works well healthy eating. I like to have one before a 30 minute workout.

This is a nice smoothie, but I did freeze some of the ingredients.  I used frozen milk (that I had put in an ice cube tray) and frozen mango. I didn't add sweetner, but I think it could have used a little.
