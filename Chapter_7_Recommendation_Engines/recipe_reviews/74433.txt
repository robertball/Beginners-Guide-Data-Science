These nachos were the BOMB!!!!! I made this for lunch yesterday. I did mine a little different though. I read through the reviews first and got the idea of adding taco seasoning to the chicken so I used 1 pack. I also added a lot more cayenne pepper(not sure how much). I used a full 8oz bag of mexican cheese. I did everything else the same as the recipe. The toppings we used were sour cream, salsa, olives, and jalapeno peppers. My husband and three kids loved every bit of it. D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S

This recipe was delicious! My husband doesn't like cayenne pepper so we substituted taco seasoning instead and it turned out great.

Let me be the first to say that these were YUMMY!! I loved the way the chicken turned out after being fried in the cayenne pepper. I added some garlic powder, minced garlic, chili powder, and cumin to the mixture too. I will probably use this method of preparing chicken for our other Mexican dishes. The flavor combination was just great. We even ate the (few) leftovers the next day, even though the chips were soggy from being in the fridge. This one's a keeper. Thanks Michelle!

YUM! Can't say enough good things about this. I just used the chicken, cheese, and chips, with no extras and it was PERFECT! I have actually made this three times in the past month since I got the recipe. Only modification was adding a tbsp of butter and some teriyaki sauce to the chicken while stir-frying to give it additional flavor. DELICIOUS!

My family loves this. I leave out the cayenne and use taco seasoning. I also add a layer of refried or black beans, and I use more cheese. It's really good!

First of all THANK YOU for this great recipe!!!  I've only tweeked it a little but I've made it several times and everyone loves it.  My first tweek: make your own chips!  Get some corn tortillas and cut them into triangles.  Then fry them in oil, salt and voila! Really crispy chips.  THEN - my second tweek; I added Sazon Goya seasoning and some fajita seasoning as well as an onion to the chicken as I cooked it.  I cooked the heck out of the chicken and chopped it very fine.  Pop it in the oven,  pull it out, plop some sour cream and salsa on it and WOW!  Superb!  Thanks again!

Great base recipe but needs individualizing to be super. We added a can of refried beans before baking and only had two layers. We topped the nachos after baking with sour cream, salsa, guacamole, chopped onion, sliced black olives and jalapenos. The end product was delicious!

For this recipe I had left over cooked chicken tenders to use.  I shredded them in the food processor.  Placed shredded chicken in a pan and added taco seasoning and 1/4 cup of water.  I also heated the chips in the oven for 5 minutes before placing toppings.  Instead of using already shredded mexican cheese I used some jarred cheese sauce and added additional fresh shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese.  My family devoured this!  We had never made nachos at home.  We liked the fact that they didn't come out soggy.  Will definitely make again using ground turkey, sausage and beef.

Great for a quick lunch! Added refried beans and didn't used the green chilies or cayenne. I spiced with my husband's spice mixture. Thanks for the post!

Yum!  We really enjoyed these and they were so easy. Like other reviewers I added taco seasoning to the chicken before cooking.  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site.  I used sliced Jalapeños instead of green chills since that is what I had on hand.  We will be making these again.

This is a great recipe on its own or when you decide to make it your own. I sometimes add in extras like black olives, chives or sauteed green and red peppers, but its always a crowd pleaser!

I used regular onions, fresh garlic and just paprika and cayenne for the chicken. Sauteed for just a bit in olive oil just enough to get the pink out of the meat. I had a jar of nacho dipping sauce, so I omitted the green chilies. I put fresh cut tomatoes to the last layer after the last layer of cheese and it came out so good almost as restaurant style.

Very good.  Used canned shredded chicken (Sam's Club chicken is great), mixed it with a can of Rotel, pinto beans, and cayenne.  Heated it up in microwave, then layered it in a casserole with corn tortilla chips and cheese, and baked for 10 minutes. It needs the toppings, as it is dry on its own.  I used the Baja Sauce recipe from this site because I was out of sour cream, and it turned out great.

This recipe is a good base for some delicious nachos... but it's only as good as your toppings!  We used corn chips and spicy salsa from our favorite mexican restaurant, then topped our servings with chopped cilantro, sour cream, green onions and diced tomato!!  We only made one layer.  If you keep everything separate, you can easily make 'fresh' nachos again the next day!

It was a flop here.  First off, the chicken winds up being "double cooked" and was just so dry.  Only thing that made it edible was the extra toppings we put on after cooking.  Even still, it was just not good and I only ate about half my serving.  Bummer on Super Bowl Sunday.

These were yummylicious:) I made the mistake of using Queso Fresco for the cheese not realizing it didn't melt but they were still good. Kid's loved them.  I will make again with a cheese that melts.
I also added lime juice when they were done baking.

Awesome! I didn't use the peppers, but used salsa in the layers instead. It was super yummy! (My boyfriend is a huge fan of Mexican foods, and he looooved this!) 
Will definitely make this again :)

These nachos were great.  I took someone's advice and added refried beans, but that was my only change.  My 16 year old son ate three helpings, and requested I make this every week!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a really good recipe.  A local restaurant has a chicken nacho dish on its menu and my husband loves it.  He was very pleased with this version. I did use 3 chicken breast halves instead of 2.  Hubby also added LOTS of jalapenos.

I was hoping to write a glowing review of this, but I made this pretty much as written, and it was just "pretty good". Of course, there are a lot of variables when making nachos, so with some tweaking, this could be indeed "killer". The chips are a big factor - I couldn't find a 12-ounce bag exactly, so I used a 13-oz bag of 100% white corn "restaurant style" chips. I think fewer chips would be better, say 10-oz. And I realized that unsalted chips would also taste better, since this dish was pretty salty. I used exactly 1 tsp. of cayenne, and let the chicken marinate for a little over 15 minutes. The resulting dish wasn't very spicy, to my taste, so I think a lot more cayenne would be better, and/or more marinating time. I baked the dish for 15 minutes, but next time I'll go for the full 20. And I didn't add the recommended toppings, which I regretted - they'd really round out the dish. This was a good start though - my first nachos recipe ever.

This was really good - I will definitely make again. I did add refried beans, a sprinkle of taco seasoning and some garlic salt & pepper. I will use again for other dishes...EVERYONE in my house of seven liked. :) Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving this 5 stars because of the simplicity of ingredients (which were things I always have on hand!), ease of prep, and the fact that it was a big hit with my husband!!  Incidentally; I substituted 1/2 tsp cumin for half the cayenne.  Thx for the recipe, Michelle.

This recipe was great hot out of the oven.  Just make sure you've got enough people to eat it because it does not do so well as leftovers.

I made this recipe just as is and it was very good. I did add chopped olives along with the green chilis. If you like it hot you will need to add more cayenne than the recipe calls for. I did put the chicken in my food processor after browning to chop it and give it the right consistancy for eating nachos. The salsa and sour cream topping gave it the finishing touch it needed.

Super easy and super good nachos!  Great for a college student on a time and money budget.  This can feed me for at least 3 days!

I would add re-fried beans to the first layer, then on the very top add diced fresh tomatoes, jalapenos, & sour cream.

These were delicious.  We used leftover fajita chicken (using Chicken Fajita Marinade recipe from this site).  We added jalapenos, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole to the top.  They were gobbled up in an instant!  Thanks!

these are awesome. The only thing I did differently was to add some hot sauce to the oil, chicken and pepper mixture. I didn't have any mexican mix cheese so I just used montery jack and cheddar. They turned out great! thank-you!!!

This is a great gameday snack. I made it last sunday and my husband ate it up. Instead of canned chiles I bought fresh ones and sliced 2 in half and cooked them with the chicken. We didn't even dress the nachos up with sourcream or anything. A real keeper thanks for the recipe

If it's not spicy enough add some jalapenos instead of the green chiles.  Then it was wonderful. Easy and the chicken can be made ahead of time.

This was wayyyy too dry.  The chicken had a great flavor because I marinated it in a little olive oil and taco seasoning, sauteed it, and then shredded it.  I think it must need much more cheese or less chips or something because ours turned out entirely too dry.  We had to smother it in sour cream and salsa even to get it down, but it had a nice flavor.

This recipe is good. Definately was filling but not as spicey as I would have liked. Add more cayenne powder and maybe another spice for a spicer taste.

Very good. We added salsa and sour cream as toppings. I also only made 2 layers. I think mixing the chicken and chilis before layering may have helped spread them both a little more evenly. I will also add tomatos before baking next time.

I made this last night in a desperate search for something new.  I made it exactly to your recipe (with the exception of a little garlic salt added to the chicken, we are garlic freaks) and it was awesome!  My fiancé  went on and on about how it was a keeper!  We topped them with tomatoes and sour cream.  Thanx!!!!

I have made these about 4 times now. My husband loves them. I use sea salt multi grain tortilla chips so they don't get too soggy. Also, I use sharp cheddar that I shred my self. And, I add diced onion. This is delicious! I use either green chilies or jalapenos, depending on what I have. Always a hit at my house.

Good, easy nachos. I used taco seasoning instead of just cayenne pepper and put some salsa, black olives and guac on top when they were done.

I used mild and hot chilies.  Plus, I added chopped jalapeños from a jar in fridge.  And a lot more cayenne too!
I still think it could have had more 'kick' next time.
Super easy and delish!!

To anyone who's having problems with meat being dry; firstly, you'll never get fully cooked chicken breast stove top unless you pop it into the oven after browning or place the lid on your pan. 

I always "grill" both sides then add my veggies and butter mixed with extra seasoning and spices THEN place the lid til veggies and chicken are cooked through. The steam from the veggies and the butter will soften the chicken up and will provide ease when shredding. You can then put it into the oven for however long u want and chicken will not dry up since its coated w/ its own sauce.

I took the suggestions to add both refried beans (i used a whole can) and I added more cheese (2x) and the taco seasoning (1 package) after the chicken cooked for a bit (with 1/2 cup water added) and it's a brilliant dish. I used all of the sauce from the chicken and served with some Guac as well as the traditional sour cream and salsas. Really simple and a great basis for amazing Nachos. Fast and delicious.

Never thought I could make nachos at home, but this recipe makes it possible!

I added a few things that weren't in the recipe:
-baked nachos with white onion
-after the 1st layer of chips added a can of refried beans as a layer
-Used Embasa salsa verde instead of the diced chilis
-Had cilantro, salsa, and guacamole on table to serve with the nachos
-Used skim mexican cheese blend 

The nachos tasted delicious. Next time I'm thinking of baking them longer so the chips are crispier.

Pretty good with some sour cream and Tapatio.  Kinda plain if you go by the recipe.  You need to add some jalapenos and black olives after you take them out of the oven.  Delicious!!

The recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  I made it for a boy scout dinner and very little was left over.  We forgot the Chillies, but it was still good.  Altghout it would be bland without the Salsa and Sour Cream.

These were really good. Very easy to make. I didn't have boneless chicken breasts, so I grilled bone-in thighs, cut them up, and sauted them with the cayenne pepper.
