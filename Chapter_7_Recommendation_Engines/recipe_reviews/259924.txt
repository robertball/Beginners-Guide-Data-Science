I make this for my family once per month at least.  It's one of our "regular" recipes.  Terrific for sensitive stomachs.  Can modify for gastroparesis by withholding the onions.  I modify the recipe by putting in 1-2 cups of carrots and whatever celery we have on hand.  We also substitute the heavy whipping cream with whole milk that we always have on hand.
