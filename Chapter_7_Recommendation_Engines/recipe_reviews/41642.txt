My family loved these cookies.  I did substitute mini chips because I was in a hurry.  These will be made again!

This is a wonderful recipe. Incredibly easy and absolutely delicious. I didn't have walnuts, and I didn't want to make it too nutty anyway so I just threw a handful of almonds in, and instead of semi-sweet baking chocolate I used milk chocolate chips. They came out great, and more snowball-shaped than flat.

These were very good, very tasty. I like them a lot. However, the photo makes it look like these are snowball-like, when in fact they are flat and cookie-like. I tried adding baking powder,- still flat cookie like. And I got 30 out of the batch vs 36.

They taste great, but for some reason they came flat (like a cookie) once I baked them.

These are to die for!  Easy to put together but hard to stop eating them.  I've used the mini chips and the regular chips instead of the chocolate squares.  Reminds us of macaroons with the addition of chocolate.  Heavenly decadence!
