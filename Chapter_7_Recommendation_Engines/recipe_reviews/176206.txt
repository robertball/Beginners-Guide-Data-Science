UPDATE...I made these a couple of days ago and made half of them as stuffed mushrooms..just pulled of the stems stuffed them with the cream cheese/sausage mixture, topped with some grated asaiago cheese and baked for 20 minustes at 350 desgrees..they were as good as the pepper without the work of cutting up and seeding!  These peppers were sooo easy and everyone loved them.  I bought a container of the small sweet peppers (about 10 red/orange/yellow), for those who don't like hot, and also did 10 small jalapeno peppers, and between the two, I had exactly the right amount of pork/cheese filling. Couldn't find the cheese it called for so I used a block of cream cheese.  It was nice because I had hot peppers for those that liked the bite, but also the small sweet peppers for those who did not.  One of the best recipes I have gotten off this site.. am making again for a get together on Boxing day.  Try it.. you'll like it!!  Just a side note.. made these again, and added a little bit of chopped red & green sweet pepper into the sausage mix for some colour in the filling. I am making (by request) again for my daughter's engagement party!  Great recipe!!

The best appetizer ever!!!! I took them to a birthday party and they were the hit of the party. People were literally eating them and dancing in place. I made 30 and they were gone in 10 minutes. Next time I will have to make more. I also wanted to point out that I didn't melt the cheese, I just added it to the well drained sausage at room temp and and mix with a spoon until smooth. I baked them at 375 for 25 minutes and they came out toasty brown from the parmesan cheese that I used to top them. As I was leaving the party I was overwhelmed with compliments.

I have been making this recipe for about a year now. I use mild banana peppers instead of the jalapeno and make them on the grill. My husband can't get enough of them. The filling is so simple with awesome flavor!

Made these last night and everyone loved them from teens to adults. Used cream cheese since I couldn't find Neufchatel cheese and breakfast sausage. Not to hot! Thanks James W.

My peppers were very small so I scaled the filling down to 3 servings. Quite time consuming to remove the seeds. I made sure to wear food safe gloves. Hubby LOVED them!  Due to the small pepper size, he said they were wicked hot!

This recipe was great, I used it as a meal and added rice to it. I also used a variation of red yellow orange and green peppers along with the hot pepper. My whole family from Granny mom and kids ate it up! Yummy

These were so good. I made them for a Super Bowl party and they were gone before the game started!! I only got to eat half of one before someone snatched the other half out of my hand! Didn't change thing and I can't wait to pick jalapenos out of my garden to make this again.

Oh man, these were fabulous, but just remember to wear gloves when handling.  and keep your exhaust fan on as well.  I baked them and then when they were cool enough, what was left over I froze in food saver bags for a later treat! 

I had a few hot wax hungarian peppers so I used those along side of the jalapenos.  Can't go wrong with this recipe at all.

Okay, but not so great.  Too much sausage and not enough cheese.  I don't think that changing the ratios would help.   I chopped up the leftovers and used them to spice up some enchiladas.

Very tasty stuffed peppers recipe, and I don't even like peppers!  I prepared this dish using fresh bell peppers from my MIL garden as a main course.  They were soooooooo good and made for great leftovers the next day too.  I'd like to try this stuffing with tomatoes as well.

Super Yum! I made these quite a few time except I used banana peppers. Im going to a party this weekend and they have been requested :) I think im going to put a little diced cayene in the sausage mixture for a little added spice!

These are sensational! I made them for a packer party and they were gone before the first quarter was over. The next game I made half with tempeh instead of the sausage for my vegetarian friends. This will be my pilar party appetizer in the future!

WARNING: These are so addicting. By baking the peppers they turn mild and yummy.  I actually use hot sausage and they're still mild enough for most people.  These ROCK, thank you!

These are AWSOME! BUT remember to wear gloves when de-seading the jalapinos or you will have burning hands for hours.

Delicious! Have also made with Portuguese Chourico, since it's what we prefer in my household.  Can definitely play around with the ingredients to suit!

Loved this recipe!  WISH I read the review about using gloves when removing the seed!  DH would not buy all the peppers required, saying try 1/2 a batch first, picking my battles--I agreed.  The guys at work liked them so well they went to the store and bought the additional peppers to make the rest of the recipe!  I've given copies of the recipe to everyone who ate them, with a warning to use gloves while removing the seeds from the peppers.  Soaking my fingers in alcohol is helping relieve the burn.

This was okay, but ended up salty...maybe the pork I chose (Farmer John regular).  I will try again and actually cook 5 min less (mine were not as firm/spicy as I would have liked.  Easy though!

I really enjoyed this (Added photo). I would reduce the amount of Neufchatel cheese by 1/4 of the block, it was a little too creamy for my taste. You can always taste and add in more. It only takes a minute to melt.

This recipe is awesome but I changed up the ingredients. I used spicy hot turkey sausage with green peppers instead of jalepenos. I added 1 cup of brown rice and topped 2 with parmesan and 2 with mozzarella. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and then broiled for another 2 minutes. They are amazing!!! Also used cream cheese, couldn't find the one listed.

The only changes I made were to use turkey sausage, I mixed the parm into the filling and topped with bread crumbs instead. I took them to a potluck and almost everyone asked for the recipe!! They were a hit!!!

Such a tasty treat.  It's nice to have a jalapeno "popper" that isn't deep fried.

"Where is the plate with the awesome stuffed peppers? Gone? Oh, I wanted more!" Always the first appetizer to be eaten. Kids love them, too. Add a dash of hot sauce to individual stuffed pepper for an additional kick...I love it hot!

Excellent! I blended the low fat cream cheese and sausage in a food processor. That's the only thing I did different...you can't go wrong with cream cheese and sausage!

Made these for apps for a party, and everybody raved over them.  I used pre-cooked habanero sausage, and they added a nice flavor.

Everyone eats up this recipe! I have made it several different ways now. I have done sausage or turkey. I have topped with salsa or just tomatoes. I have also wrapped them in bacon It really depends on what I am serving it with. There are never any leftovers.

Loved the recipe!  As vegetarians, we substituted in ground-up imitation sausage patties.  Our non vegetarian friends did not even know the difference.  We initially had more filling than jalapenos and we had a couple of bell peppers in the fridge so we baked them along side and they were delicious as well!

Made these for our poker game this weekend and they were a HIT.   I halfed the peppers and wearing gloves, deveined and deseeded under running water to avoid burning eyes.  Used hot Jimmy Dean sausage.  Sprinkled top with breadcrumbs before adding grated parmesan cheese.  These were great.  Thanks for the recipe

This spicy lil number kicked my husbands butt! He love spicy food. He's bold so if he's not sweating it's not hot enough, when I mad these we were all coughing from the  smell of the peppers after I cut the open. And he was covered in sweat by the end of the night.

This recipe is awesome! I tried it first last week & hubby wanted it again Tuesday. My uncle told me he thinks our pastor would absolutely love them, so I'm making him a batch this afternoon. I thought my first batch didn't have enough kick, so the second time I diced up a whole jalapeno (seeds & all) in the mixture. It gave it just the right heat. Bacon bits & mozzarella sprinkled on top before baking made it WONDERFUL!

These were REALLY good. We made about 20 peppers, half jalapeno and half mini sweet; we also used hot turkey sausage. It was a hit.

I opted for turkey sausage using only half the package (means two dishes from one pound of turkey sausage) and mixed the shredded Parmesan into the sausage/cream cheese mixture before filling the peppers.  Baked at 400 for 20 mins to perfection.  Thanks for the recipe; easy and delicious!

These were great.  I didn't have any parmesan cheese.  I substituted cheddar cheese.  I mixed it all together and then put on the peppers.  After they were done I added a little cheddar cheese to the top and cooked 3 more minutes.   I can't wait to try these out on my family.

Made these for a Super Bowl party and everyone liked.  However, the next time I make, I'll leave in some of the pepper's membrane for some heat.   Very simple to make and even easier to transport  by baking on parchment paper:  just pick up and transfer to plate!    Also, don't forget to buy food prep gloves when you buy your peppers!!

Made these for Super Bowl snacks. Loved them. Simple and very tasty. Warmed left over peppers the next day. Oven 350 for 5 minutes. They warmed through and were great on day 2.

This recipe has a unique flavor.
I liked the taste, but needed to reduce the jalapenos by half. Otherwise, get the TUMS out!
