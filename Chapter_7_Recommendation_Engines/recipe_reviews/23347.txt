This is soooo good! It's a million times better than what you get in a store. I added some sun dried tomatoes to it and wow! I dipped anything from carrots, celery, crackers, & bread and it was fab. Why haven't more people tried it? Maybe they will now that there's a review. It was so easy by the way, there's no excuse not to make it.

With basil so prolific in my garden, this was perfect to use the basil pesto I've already made with it. Since the pesto is already so flavorful and green I didn't bother with either the chives or the cilantro.  Actually, I know I wouldn't have liked the cilantro in here anyway, as I find the flavors conflicting.

Fantastic and very, very quick and easy. I used fresh parsley because I didn't have cilantro available and it was wonderful. I'll definitely make this again and again.

Amazing and SIMPLE. I used a little more pesto (probably about 1.5 tablespoons more than the recipe called for) and it was delicious. Takes no time at all, and I also used the 1/3 less fat Philly cream cheese and still great. We used it as a vegetable dip and I used the rest on Triscuits. More people should try this!

Quick & easy. Although I did not like this, everyone else at the party loved it...even the picky kids. I think next time I'll skip the garlic. Thanks.

This was better than I expected. I didn't even use the cilantro or chives(didn't have any). I used a homemade parsley pesto with toasted walnits and fresh grated asiago. A wondeful dip to use up garden parsley and random frozen nuts. Served this with garden veggie crackers and baby carrots. Will make this again for sure. My only suggestion would be to thin it out with a teeny bit of milk (I always do with cream cheese spreads)

I'm asked to make this dip for every family get together. I use the cheaper powdered pesto and like it much better that way! This is a tasty spread with bagel chips or toasted peta bread

This is delicious and I cannot wait to share it with my lady friends at church today. With half of the recipe I used sun-dried tomato pesto  And I am thinking of adding slivered almonds the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love this!  I am always asked to bring it when we go places.  I buy the Classico brand of pesto and I don't use cilantro because I don't care for it.

I make this with 4-5 TBSP of high quality pesto. Then I taste it and sometimes I add more. The pesto is what makes this recipe! Use plenty.
