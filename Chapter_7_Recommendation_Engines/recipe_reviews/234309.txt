Initially I used chicken and it was excellent, so then 
I tried it using beef but I made the mistake of marinating it for too long :(  I will certainly make it again however this time I will listen to Chef John's instructions.

I've got a couple of kids that as soon as you put an exotic name to a dish, they won't try it.  This however, got them.  This really is easy to make and so amazing.  The depth of flavor in the beef is nothing short of exotic.  I am the self proclaimed president of the International Onion Haters of the World so I left the onions out of it.  Despite what my mother tried to tell me for years, you can indeed cook without onions and this dish is proof.

This was my first attempt at grilling thin strips of skewered meat.  Chef John's technique is spot on.  That said, there were problems along the way.  By the time I got a good sear on all sides of the skewered meat, the meat was overdone.  I corrected this with my second skewer by spraying the meat  with Pam just before placing on the grill.  This allowed the meat to free up from the grates sooner rather than later.  Essentially, there isn't enough oil in the marinade as stated in the recipe.  I'm thinking all of this could have been mitigated by using a fattier cut of meat, like a skirt steak, or rib steak.  As for the taste, I tried it with and without peanut sauce.  Without peanut sauce, ginger was the dominant flavor.  The ginger was a refreshing flavor, but I wasn't looking for a soft drink.  The peanut sauce changes the flavor entirely, for the better I think.  In the end, I will use this technique and make again using a different cut of meat with my tried and true steak marinade.

I would rate this a 10 if possible. Another Chef John Masterpiece. I love cooking with an ingredient I have never used before, this time it was the lemongrass. This dish blew us away. Thanks again Chef John For making me look like I know what I am doing.

OMG!!!!! When your read all of the reviews you are going to think .... how could it be that good.  Well let me tell you, it is that good!  I will make this time and time again.
I did not have the lemon grass or the turmeric and it was still great.  I served it with fried rice and cantaloupe..... and of course the peanut dipping sauce.

Just wonderful. Melt in your mouth delicious.  Could not find lemongrass in my rural area, would love to try it with it someday. Otherwise made it just as written. served with a peanut dipping sauce by Chef John.

This beef satay was awesome! I had marinaded the meat the night before.  And then had unexpected company for dinner so I turned the all beef skewers into kabobs adding thick slices of peppers, onions and mushrooms I had in the house.  They were delicious.  And the addition of the peanut sauce made this a really good meal.  I will definitely make the beef satay and the peanut sauce again!

Loved this. This is a recipe the family asks for at least once a month. Don't let the list of ingredients scare you - it's actually really easy and gets easier with practice. I use a lime instead of lemon grass; it's just easier to find at the local grocery store. At the end of the meal I always freeze up a few servings for my husband to take to work and they don't last a week in my freezer. This meal always amazes guests - better than the satay beef at a restaurant. Thanks!

AMAZING FLAVOR!!!!  Chef John has done it again!!!  Love it!!  Made it and it was the best meat I have ever made on the grill.  I always looked at sirloin as the "cheaper meat" they serve you at the middle of the road restaurants, but this was amazing!!!

Pure happiness. This goes into our permanent recipe file. We made this with the peanut dipping sauce recipe, plain, white rice, and Allrecipes curried cashew, pear and grape salad. 2.3 lbs of beef made enough for 3, plus 2 hearty leftover meals.

I followed this recipe exactly [minus the lemon grass but substituted lemon zest] and the fish sauce is way too overpowering.  I would actually eliminate the fish sauce if you don't care for that 'fishy' taste.

O... M... G... YUMMMMM!! 
So, I do a lot of cooking, but I hate following recipes because I prefer to rely on my senses (and really, I just hate having to precisely measure the ingredients - it's why I don't bake!). I've reached the point wherein my dishes are consistently successful, but only a rare few work out so well as to have me considering  sneaking outside to the barbecue to lick off whatever possible charred traces might remain... at 3am, no less! 
This dish tops that list! Not only is it unequivocally the best food I've ever made in my life, but it's also the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, and I'm not exaggerating... I made it for my family last night, and I've already got a new (and bigger!) batch marinating in the fridge for lunch today, because I can't get it off of my mind!!
For clarity, I didn't have access to the fresh version of some of the ingredients, so I ended up using the squirty-tube version of the garlic, ginger, and lemongrass. I also had to use turbinado sugar, and a different cut of meat (I believe I opted for a strip loin, and it worked out beautifully!). Furthermore, I didn't measure anything, I just eyeballed it, and I used bamboo skewers that soaked in water for the 2hrs of marinating time. Oh! And I was a bit heavy-handed with the vegetable oil based on the reviews/comments. 
I think my favourite thing about this dish, is how different it tasted after a light dip in the spicy peanut sauce (I used President's Choice's Memories of Szechua

This is so good I can’t wait to make it again! Made it as is and will note despite using low sodium soy sauce, it is salty: because of the fish sauce! Still wonderful. I used thinly cut ribeye steak. Melts in your mouth. Used the leftover marinade on a chicken roast and that was great, too! I’m considering making a doubled batch and freezing it to have handy. All that chopping and measuring does take time.

Very good recipe.  Did not have the lemongrass.  Also thought the grilling times were too long.  Beef was tasty but overlooked.

O.M.G! Loved it! Made it twice, I used beef first, then chicken. You don't need to marinate as long as said. I loved it with chicken the most. I just used thighs and drumsticks, sooooo good! The peanut sauce recommended was fabulous! I tossed some noodles with it. I will definitely make this and the peanut sauce over and over again!

Do not marinade longer than 4 hours, and do not use wood skewers.  This was delicious.

Great Satay, made it for an appetizer and loved by all.  New peanut sauce was a bit funky.  The satay can stand alone as well!

I've always been a big fan of Chef John. This recipe has only reaffirmed my adorations! This was AMAZING. I did make a small change. I couldn't find fish sauce so I used oyster sauce and I couldn't find lemongrass so I left it out. 

It came out great though. I cooked it for my family and my husband was so impressed that he brought it next door for my neighbor to try. 

I will definitely be making this again.

Made as per instructions; fantastic! Very flavourful, will use less brown sugar next time, but all other ingredients are perfectly matched. Will add this to my list of great marinade recipes.

This marinade tasted really good. At first I was really surprised because I had added no salt, and it didn't taste like it needed salt at all! Ah, but then I looked at the Thai fish sauce and the soy sauce I used and realized that I had really added about 6000 mg of salt to the marinade. So plenty of salt! My big change to the recipe was to marinade 10 chicken drumsticks using about 2/3 of the sauce for 2.5 hours. I do think this sauce would be better on beef but definitely quite good on chicken too.
