Delicious! ** There are a few helpful tips I found to make your egg whites/meringue perfect. 1. Make sure all mixing tools are impeccably clean and dry before starting. 2. Cold eggs separate more easily, but the ideal temp. for whipping eggs whites is room temp. 3. Keep yolks out of the whites as even a tiny amount of fat or yolk will ruin your meringue. 4. Add sugar to your whites gradually - a few spoonfulls at a time. 5. To test and make sure the sugar is dissolved into your egg whites: Rub a little of the beaten whites between your fingers - if the mixture feels gritty, the sugar is not completely dissolved. Beat in short increments until the whites are completely smooth. ** I roughly chopped my pecans which made each bite of these lovely little clouds even more heavenly! Thanks for this recipe, Joe! NOTE: another reviewer mentioned not being able to use a hand mixer to achieve stiff peaks - this is not true. You can not only use a hand mixer, but also whip by hand! I've done both. It just takes some patience.

These are too easy and tooo good.  I kept having to taste them to make sure they were as delicious as I thought they were, then I had to bake some more... It was such a vicious circle, thank goodness I finally ran out of pecans!

These are just toooo good!  Thought I would have them around the house for a few days, but the family ate every last one of them in just a few hours! (Little piglets!)  This recipe is easy and tastes like you went though a lot of trouble.  I will be making them for Christmas gifts for my neighbors and friends at work.  Use small Mason jars, fill 'em up and put a pretty bow on top.  I can guarantee everyone will love them, unless they just don't like nuts.  Won't go wrong with this one.

These were great!  There's hardly any left.  The only thing I'll be doing different is I won't be baking them for as long as they got rather hard, so next time hopefully they'll be a little less hard and more "fluffy"

I had to make flourless cookies for passover and found these to be a delicious hit that was much tastier than your plain old meringue cookies. The pecans were a nice touch as well as the use of brown sugar. I tried the recipe without any changes and it was lovely on its own and when I made them the second time, I added maple syrup and both times were yummy! Nice cookie to make for a cookie exchange too!

I loved these!  They were so easy to make and I love the texture. My husband and a friend loved them too between the three of us we polished off the whole batch in two days.    I think the people that had problems with their dough being too runny didn't wait for the egg whites to get stiff enough.  The recipe is very, very easy...that's the only thing that takes a few minutes.

i was excited to give this recipe a try because first, we love pecans & second, this was my first time at making a meringue cookie! the recipe is an easy one although it took several minutes longer than expected to achieve soft peaks (i never got stiff peaks). i'd added the sugar in 4 or 5 increments, maybe this should've been a more gradual incorporation(?). regardless, the pecan clouds came out tasting pretty good & the batter made exactly 24 cookies. thanks carol!

They weren't the prettiest thing I've ever seen but the taste was so heavenly. Not hard to make, just make sure its not raining outside or they won't set right because of the moisture in the air. One of my new favorites

These were easy to make and quite pretty to look at as you can see by my picture, but I'm sorry to say I didn't like them.  The egg white flavor was way too strong.  I even added a little extra vanilla extract, but it didn't do the trick.  Unfortunately I won't be making it again.

I used one half the amount of pecans, chopped, and it was a lot!  Very chewy and delicious, I couldn't stop eating them.  I want to try this recipe with even less nuts and see how it works.  Thank you!

These were the best meringues I've ever had!  I love Meringues and have made them a lot of times, but these were nutty and crunchy goodness.  These are one of my favorite cookies ever.  They were gone in ten minutes.  I can't wait to make them again!

I love these cookies. Pecans have always been my favorite nut. They came out perfect the first time I made them, and this was the first "meringue" recipe I had ever tried.

Yummy!!! The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of Almond Extract. Thanks for posting, Joe!!! And, thanks to Kathleen (Dec. 22, 2010) for her helpful tips, which I followed. I separated my eggs early, added my 3/4 cup of "packed" (make sure you do pack your brown sugar as you are measuring, or you will only use half the sugar you should be using) brown sugar one Tbs at a time, and, by being patient, I was able to whip up a perfect meringue with cheap hand-held mixer. I baked at 250* for the hour, let them sit in the oven for 30 more minutes, and they were perfect. Looked like clouds and tasted like awesomeness!!!

SO GOOD!!! I can't believe how good these are!! My husband loved them and he's not a big fan of meringues! These will be made over and over and over. I did double the vanilla, just personal taste.

Just wolfed down my first two. I think I almost did everything you could possibly do wrong- and these still managed to come out good! :) I used dark brown Demura sugar- wrong. So, there was still 'grit" in the mix. I was nervous to overbeat the whites however, cause they were already pretty stiff. So I thought, Oh well, grainy meringue! I put them on 2 separate baking pans- both were stoneware with parchment paper ontop. I switched them from one rake to the other halfway thru. Left them in the oven turned off more than a half hour, cause I had to go pick up my son from school. All this, and the outside was kinda a crunchy, crust like texture. then the inside just was nutty, yummy, and melt in your mouthy.. I can't wait to share these with family and friends! Great recipe!!

These are delicious, it's hard to stop with one or two...I made these for my mother-in-law who can't eat flour, but have to stop eating them or there will be nothing to take to her tomorrow.

For a lower calorie version, try replacing the brown sugar with the Splenda Brown Sugar for Baking. Also, try adding cinnamon or nutmeg. Tasting them you'd never know just how simple they actually were to make!

Very good.  I wanted uniform sizes, so I used my small scoop and found that the pecan halves made it difficult to get them all the same.  Next time I will rough chop the nuts.  Other than that it's a nice, easy recipe and different from most cookies that I've made.

Tired these for a cookie exchange and they were a hit.  They were so easy to make.  You just have to have time as they require an hour in the oven and then they sit an additional 30 minutes.  I also broke the pecan halves in pieces.  Everyone loved them,  The pecans in the cookies taste like pralines.

I separated the cold eggs and then let the whites sit until room temperature.  Also had the pecans stored in refrigerator so put them in the oven for a few minutes until they were room temp also.  I used sucanat rather than brown sugar and I heated the oven to 350 degrees and then after I put in the cookies, I cooked for five minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven overnight.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe almost exact, but just added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I didn't have enough room on my cookie tray to bake all the cookies in the main oven, so I ended up baking the remaining cookies in a toaster oven at the same time and they all still came out perfect.  They were quite tasty, and it was hard not to eat just one.  Even my gluten-sensitive friend loved them. I never had anything quite like these before.  Thumbs up.

very yummy and easy.  don't try to make these using a hand mixer.  I started that way and realized I would be at it for hours.  you need a full powered stand mixer with a whisk attachment to get the egg white mixture to a hard peak.

I do not really care for these.  I used Brown Sugar Twin, but I don't think it made that big a difference in the taste.  These would be ok to add variety to a cookie plate, but not a good dessert on their own.

While mine did not look as pretty as the ones in this recipe photo, they were yummy.  I had a few people ask me for the recipe.  Will be making it again... and again... and again.

These were a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly although I think next time I could bake them for 30 mins and let them set for an hour. Actually I made similar cookies when I was a kid and when we put them in the oven,  we turned it off and let the cookies set for 2-3 hours. But anyway they taste like heaven!

Perfect!  I took the advice of another and chopped my pecans, other than that, no changes!

Delicious and easy. Received compliments for them. And they store well in an airtight container.

I followed the directions exactly, but the batter was runny, the cookies were flat, and I only cooked them for half the time and they burned. The texture was like tree bark. I'll probably never get the crumbs scraped off my pan.

End result not what I expected but I will try again.  I didn't use "fresh" brown sugar so next time I'll see if that makes a difference.

This recipe is named well.  The (cookie?) is light and airy.  They tasted very good, but were not a big hit at my house.

These cookies are wonderful.  They were so easy to make, I actually liked how long they took to cook.  I was not rushing into the kitchen after 8 minutes, finding they were not done, keeping them in a little longer and over cooking them.   THESE ARE DELICIOUS!  Thanks Carol!!
