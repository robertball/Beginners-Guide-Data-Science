Good cookies.  Easy to make.  I'm not quite sure what the reviewer who said they wound up with a crumbly mess did.  My cookies turned out just fine, not dry at all.  The only thing I would suggest is to grease the baking sheet a little, because they were a little stuck/hard to pull off after baking.

Something just isn't right about these.  I followed the recipe exactly (except did 1 1/2 times recipe b/c my chocolate was 6oz) and these just came out so dry that they wouldn't stick together.  I have a pile of chocolately pecan crumbles.  I wouldn't make them again or either I'd try it without the overnight refrigeration to prevent the drying effect.

Mine did not stay in balls. Became flat cookies when baked. What did I do wrong?
