The three tablespoons of oil is critical. I used less when I first prepared this dish and did not get the desired crispiness.  I tried again with the recommended amount of oil and it made a huge difference. Will make again.

This was a simple and easy recipe to follow. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was a healthy alternative to fried catfish. It was tasty and not overpowering.

I loved this dish! I have always found fried fish to be a favorite of mine. This was a great healthy alternative. I used fresh redfish fillets my husband caught instead of catfish. The only other change was to reduce the amount of hotsauce to 1 tsp. I have a four yr old who is not good with spicy foods. The breading was crunchy and tasty. This will deffinitely be made again in our house!! Thank you Carina!

This was the first time I've ever successfully cooked catfish - not because of this recipe, but because it finally occurred to me to cut each filet into smaller pieces.  Still, this recipe was a great place to start!  Because of the 3 tablespoons of oil (in this case, "oven-fried" is not a euphemism for "baked"), the coating comes out nice and crispy.  We really liked it.  I did end up cooking for a few extra minutes, but my oven was evidently built on Mars and I've learned never to trust it.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll make this again!

Perfect! I used an extra 1/ 2 pound of catfish and cooked for 25 minutes and it came out great. Leftovers make great sandwiches on a whole wheat bun with mayo.

I was afraid this wouldn't come out crispy enough so i added about 10 minutes cooking time.  I used tilapia because I recently developed a disgust for catfish (bad experience...)  I added an extra teaspoon of creole seasoning (Creole Seasoning Blend from this site) to the cornmeal and a half teaspoon of salt to the egg and hot sauce mixture as I like lots of flava.  I rate this excellent, and so did my family, even my husband who scoffed at the idea of 'oven frying'.  I will try it out next on company, I believe it's worthy!

OK: this is a keeper. The fish was very crunchy, but absorbed very little of the oil. Recipe made enough coating for about three pounds of fish. Nice kick, but definitely not too spicy hot. We will try coating with other types of fish, maybe chicken fingers too.

This recipe was fast, easy and good. I hope more people get to try it. I used Tony's as my creole seasoning(I use Tony's on almost everything :-). I made a couple of small modifications. I sprinkle some creole seasoning on the catfish after I pat dried them. I didn't use hot sauce. I added about a quarter of teaspoon of creole seasoning to the egg mix.

This was amazing!!! You definitely want to use the full 3 tbls of oil to coat your glass dish (I used 2 tablespoons canola and 1 avocado oil).  Make sure your fillets are dry as possible before coating with the egg and corn meal mix ( I used 3/4 c of cornmeal and 1/4 Panko bread crumbs). I'm salt sensitive, so no creole seasoning. Instead I used garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, paprika and a little sea salt - hot sauce in the egg mix. I also used my speed-bake feature (convection) for 10 mins a side...came out perfectly!! Definitely doing this one again :)

Good for a baked catfish, but nothing beats deep fried.  We did use less hot pepper sauce thinking it'd be to hot, but next time we'll use closer to the tablespoon if not all.  This is the best of any baked fish recipes though.  I would recommend using 1/3 c. cornmeal & 2/3 c. panko as I'll make that change next time.  This time I'd tried 1/2 & 1/2, but still to much cornmeal for our taste.  I'd also squirt with some oil (oil or canola)  to help crisp it up better.

This one is pure perfection. My wife doesn't like catfish, and there isn't much that I like better. I can cut this recipe in half and stuff myself and let her eat chicken. Cooking time is right on the money, and the coating is excellent. I use half  water and half hot sauce with the egg, but it is easy to adjust to your taste.

Wonderful as is, but if you find catfish to have a gamey flavor as my family does, try marinating in buttermilk for a couple hours before you rinse and proceed with the rest of the recipe. The buttermilk trick also works on any game meat or organ meat like liver.

I just finished eating these and I thought they were great. They were easy to make. Because they were baked in the oven,  I don't feel like I ruined my diet. I increased the cooking time by about 10 minutes to accommodate thicker fish fillets. I kept it pretty simple and  seasoned my fish with season salt, salt and black pepper.
I was so ready to eat, I forgot to take a picture. I'll be making these again soon. So, hopefully I remember to snap a pic on the next go round.

Very good!  I used tilapia instead of catfish because that's what was on sale, but I think next time I'll use catfish.  My family's only complaint was that I put the breading on too thick.  Otherwise, it was nice, crispy and delicious!

We like this recipe and cooking method so much that we use it almost on a weekly basis.  We've done catfish, tilapia, thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts, okra... Okra?!?  Yes, okra.  My initial experiment with okra came out so well that my husband only wants his okra (his favorite vegetable!) cooked this way now.  Hmmm, can green tomatoes be far behind?

My only deviation from the recipe as posted is to heat the oiled pans while the oven is preheating; I only use 1 jumbo egg and about 2 Tbsp. of Chipotle Tabasco sauce, and I use Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning in place of the Creole, as we like things a bit on the spicy side.  I also triple the dry mix and keep it in a jar in the fridge to have handy whenever we want to use it.

Thank you, Carina, for a great easy and versatile recipe!

The combination of seasonings ruined this dish for me. Too much thyme for one thing. It was also somewhat mushy on the bottom even though I baked it another couple of minutes.  I also didn't like the idea of spraying the top of the fish with cooking spray.  I think I will just broil the catfish with some buttered bread crumbs on top next time.

I find warming up the oil with the oven, helps the crust stay on better. I use this with chicken, and hot dogs as well, works great!

I have made this recipe twice.  Once with the egg wash, 2 stars.  Once without the egg wash, 5 stars.  Without the wash you get crispy fish.  With the wash you get mushy fish.  Save your eggs for breakfast on this one!

Incredibly easy and delicious! I did not have cornmeal so used Panko crumbs. I baked 12 minutes on each side and it was perfect!  I will make this again, guaranteed!

This turned out very good.  The fish were crisp and not dry inside.  I used flounder since my husband doesn't eat catfish.  I also did some shrimp by this recipe and they were great. Will definitely make again.  Beats all the grease with frying.  Healthy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am amazed how crunchy the coating on this fish gets. My catfish filets were pretty thick so I had to cook about 5 minutes longer than stated. You could actually hear the crunch when biting into this. My only complaint was that they were not salty enough. I'm sure that depends on your creole seasoning. Next time I will add salt to the mix.

I really like this recipe. At first I was going to cook it with no grease but I took the advice of another reviewer and put it on the pan as instructed - happy I did that.  This was a great, simple way to  cook fish and I will be ding it again in the future with all my fish when I want something "fried".  My kids really loved it, so I guess it passed the test. I used Louisiana fish fry and it came out fine - little crunchy.  Next time I will use the cornmeal to see how it comes out.

I changed the serving to 2, which was enough for 4 fillets. I didn't use ground pepper or hot pepper sauce (I don't like spicey). I also cut back on the Tony's creole seasoning, because as a dry spice it tasted too strong, but I tried again while cooking and added a lot more. I substituted breadcrumbs for the cornmean so maybe that is why it wasn't crispy but I'll try again because we really liked the taste and it was very easy.

OMG this was so delicious! I just wiped the glass dish with shorting like I would a loaf pan. Very crispy. Made as is with no changes.

This is great. I used 3 fillets, intending to have leftovers, and I am currently finishing it up. Yes, I ate it all in one sitting. It's that good.

My oven is dumb sometimes about getting up to the temperature, so I ended up broiling it, which worked just fine! Very crispy and delicious.

Hello!   We were given a big bag of fresh fillets and chunked catfish and neither of us had ever had a catfish fry, sooooo...  I found this recipe and here is our experience: Not having Creole seasoning - looked up how to make our own (there are many recipes!) had all ingredients for a jerk recipe so made it.  We followed rest of instructions for baking which in our opinion is okay...the flavor is there we could not get a "crunch" on the crust...is a healthier option though.  Since we had so much we decided to try deep frying as well and we are here to say we burnt out tongues eating out of the basket it is that good!!! We froze quite a bit to pull out for quick meals...have not pulled yet so no review of that.  Have 4 stars only because couldn't get crunch on baked fish.  :)

I left out the hot sauce, but did use Tony Chachere's and found it just spicy enough for me. I love how crispy it came out without frying!  Definitely will make this again - so easy.

I didn’t have cornmeal.   I used seasoned Zatarain’s fish fry mix instead of cornmeal and the other seasonings. I still used the egg and  hot sauce. I used a light tasting olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I was amazed at the crispness of the fish.  My entire family loved it. I will definitely make  again.

UPDATE:  I love catfish and this is my go-to catfish recipe.  I love it and make it all the time.  Our local grocery store has had catfish on sale for a month-plus and I always use this recipe.
2/8:  Excellent and easy to make.  I've made this twice now in 10 days and only changed the egg to Egg Beaters.  It's the easiest way to prepare fish for baking and comes out nice and tasty every time.  Love it!

Half of my breading fell off when I turned it halfway through. I am going to try a longer cooking time and see if that works better for me. Easy cooking method and good flavor.

Very easy and delicious recipe to make & enjoy. We added buttermilk to the liquid portion to dip the fish into before coating with the cornmeal mix. Crispy and succulent!

Yes, I'll make it again! Not as good as fried but much better than baked.  It was very crunchy on the outside.

This was really tasty and easy to make and would probably work well with any thick fish fillet, like cod or haddock.

Turned out very good, did add more cook time due to more amount of fish. Great flavor with some rice pilaf and red potatoes

This turned out quite crisp, tasting like fried without being greasy. I forgot my hot sauce in the egg this first time. :( I also subbed 1/2 Panko for 1/2 the cornmeal because we don't like just corn meal. I will make this again.

These were awesome. I added a little more hot sauce because i like spicy food. Also, cooked for 15 minutes flipped them and cooked for 10 more minutes. They were crispy and delicious.

I will definitely try this again. Instead of using cornmeal I used my regular breading seasoning I would use if I was frying my fish and I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I had to add a couple mins to the time because it wasn't crispy enough for me but other than that it came out really well, sticking this into my recipe box :)

I found this recipe while looking for a oven catfish recipe. I followed the recipe as writen on both catfish and salmon. The fish had a nice crust and was not oily at all. This was enjoyed by both adults and younger children. I will use this recipe frequently. Thanks Carina!
