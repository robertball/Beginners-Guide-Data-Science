This pizza was sooooo good and extremely simple to make. I only made 1 pizza and I did change a couple of things. I also did not follow the amounts of ingredients 100% but it still turned out fantastic so it is pretty much fool proof. Instead of large tomatoes, I used 4 roma tomatoes seeded for one pizza and fresh basil from my garden. I also did not include mushrooms since I did not have any on hand and I left out the jalapeno. I used a yellow onion instead of a red onion. My husband and I devoured it and he said he loved it more than the pepperoni pizzas we always make at home. Can't wait to make it again. Thank you so much for this simple recipe.

Simple, easy, and delicious! This was great for dinner! I used some plum tomatoes that I sliced and salted to get the water out vs. chopping. I left out the jalapeno, mushrooms, onion and olives as a personal preference plus my husband isn't a huge fan of a bunch of stuff on a pizza. And, I really just wanted the fresh tomato and basil to shine through. For the pizza sauce I used "Pasta/Pizza Sauce" from this site. I layered my sauce, cheeses, fresh basil & tomatoes then drizzled a bit of olive oil over top. It baked up beautifully and tasted great - especially with a nice glass of wine!

This recipe was delicious! The only change that I made was to add a whole bunch of garlic which I thought made the pizza much more tasty. Also, be sure to realize that this recipe is for two pizzas! Cutting all the ingredients in half made more than enough food for my family of four.

I only used tomatoes and basil because it was all I had and the kids wont eat anything when they see onions!  Left the tomateos in slices for the top and used a split french bread loaf along with fresh basil from my herb garden!.. Thanks for a simple and good recipe! :)

This was so good!  My kids inhaled it and my daughter asked if I could make it again.  I did leave off the jalepenos because of my kids and parmesan cheese because I didn't have any.  I'll be making this one again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious recipe. However, when using fresh mushrooms, they must be precooked to get out the moisture or you will have a very soggy pizza. I added fresh garlic to the sauce and it was perfection!

This was SO satisfying and delicious! I used 6 roma tomatoes and left off the peppers, olives, and mushrooms. Mistakenly I also left out the sauce but it was AWESOME that way! We tried adding some after but it was much better without it! This is the best pizza I've ever made!

This was pretty good, and a different way to make pizza. A lot of it will depend on the quality of the crust you buy, so look for one you like. It would be easy to substitute toppings depending on what you like and/or have on hand. thanks!

This pizza was great! Eyeballed most of the measurements, but they should have been roughly what was given in the recipe. It's a very tasty pizza and we'll be sure to make it again.

A little strong/much... We couldn't handle eating too much of the flavor, so we couldn't fill up on it. We did use the jalapenos, so maybe it would have been easier on our tummies without.

This is excellent. I modified it a bit by leaving out the mushroom and substituting 2 habaneros (seeds removed, finely chopped) for the jalapenos. I also doubled the recipe and put 3/4 of it on a homemade 20" crust.

1 red onion is waaay too much. And I really like onions. Salvaged it by picking off about half or more.

Haven't tried yet but I intend to. I think you made a mistake in the recipe though. Mozzarella cheese you have 8 ounces of it and you list it twice? Am thinking that was a mistake? Oh sorry see, now that you are using double for the mixture and then topping. This sounds really great.

I loved this!  I thought 1/4 c basil seemed like it might be too much, but it was great.  I might even add more next time, along with some roasted garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good! The only changes I made was to reduce the recipe down to 1 serving and I used a low carb tortilla instead of pizza crust. I knew this wouldn't work for my husband, so I went this one alone. I thought it was fabulous

I made this pizza as part of our pizza night menu and it was wonderful. We didn't add the jalapeño peppers as our guests did not like spicy food but otherwise made the recipe as written. Even my husband, who usually wants only meat filled dishes, really enjoyed this pizza. Next time I make this pizza I might try adding some feta.

No I have not tried this recipe yet, but looking at the nutritional value and being on Weight Watchers, I feel I will have to wait awhile before trying it; however I have put it in my recipe box.  Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait to try it.
