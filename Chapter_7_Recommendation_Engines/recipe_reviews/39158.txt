Fantastic soup!!  Very easy to make and you can cut down on the fat drastically by using nonfat evaporated milk.  I used double the curry and half the milk which made the soup alot heartier.  Other than that, it's a definite winner!!

Made list soup last night.  I added a few more ingredients as it was a bit on the bland side.  I added 1/4 tsp of Graham Marsala, 1/8 tsp each of All Spice, Nutmeg and Cinnamon.  It did need a bit more salt too.  I also changed the evaporated milk to skim evaporated (it was all I had in the house)and added black pepper instead of white.  The result!  Unbelievable.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

Such a beautiful and aromatic soup!  It turned out very nicely - this is a very healthy,  soothing soup, perfect for autumn.  I added more curry & salt, to suit my taste.

So yummy! I didn't have a blender/mixer on hand, so we just ate with the onion slices in it. I only put in half of the milk, as well. Very good!

Really tasty, fun and easy.  We used a hollowed out pumpkin to serve it.  Next time we'll make more.

I LOVE this soup!  I have made it over and over again and refuse to share with anyone.  I think some people expect the pumpkin to make it a sweet soup, but it doesn't.  Rather, it's a perfect blend of pumpkin, curry, and spices...particularly the pepper.  White pepper is one of my favorite additions to many soups now.

Reading the other reviews here, I also modified as follows: more salt, more curry powder (another teaspoon or so), a bit of cumin, a bit of nutmeg, a few coriander seeds, less (about 1/2) milk. 

that said, it was delicious! I really like spice and flavor, so your mileage may vary. 

Afer eating a bowl, it reminded me of a delicious mushroom curry soup I had had, so I sauted some white mushrooms and threw them in. That made it even better in my opinion! Try it! If you like mushrooms, you won't be disappointed. 

Overall, the soup needed a few adjustments, but was quite good. Not particularly "pumpkiny" though, so skip it if you're in a pumpkin mood.

This could not be any easier.  I made this for our family Thanksgiving dinner last year and everyone has requested that I make it again this year.  Very tasty!!!

Oh so easy and oh so good!  I agree that it could get kicked up a notch and modified but this is an excellent soup.  We served it with Rothbury croutons and it was a nice addition.  Our thanks to those who submitted this superb dish.  Agree this was not very pumpkiny-- rather subtle but great!

I started by following the recipe, except I subbed 2 cups of fresh pumpkin pur√©e for canned. It was pretty bland. Then I read the reviews and added:
- 1/4 tsp. nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp. coriander
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar
- another 1 1/2 tsp. curry powder
Now, it's soooo good. Next time, I think I'll halve the milk, as it is pretty watery.

This was a good recipe.  I added a bit more curry and added a bit of red pepper flakes at the advice other reviewers, but I thought it turned out a bit too hot.  I also reduced the evaporated milk by half and it gave the soup just the right consistency.  I think any more milk would have made the soup too runny.  If you liked this recipe, you'd love the BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP recipe submitted by Mary.

This soup was easy to make and very tasty. The curry isn't too strong so I would recommend this soup to even picky eaters. I recommed chopping the garlic and using kosher salt.

I made this using fresh pumpkin leftover from Halloween and it was extra delicious!  I loved this soup but my husband thought it had just a tad too much curry.  I'll make this again but have him taste first, as I add the curry gradually.  YUMMY!

Tastes like winter. I added a pinch of Saigon cinnamon, cayenne and fresh nutmeg plus one teaspoon brown suger to adjust the flavor more to our taste. Wonderful winter soup.

I made this soup with fresh pumpkin that I roasted in the oven and it turned out fabulous. Replaced the milk with soy milk but I sauted the onion and garlic in butter so it wasn't vegan but it will pass muster with vegetarians. We love it with roasted pumpkin seed sprinkled on top.

I served this at a dinner party for ten and got many compliments.  An excellent, flavorful cold weather soup.  This was much better than I had hoped after reading the reviews.  So glad I tried it.  I added 2 teaspoons of curry instead of 1 1/2 for added flavor and it tasted great.  My 2 year old son even loved this!  I will defintely make this again.

Excellent.  Made this for a potluck; I added about a tablespoon of sugar and plenty of salt to make it taste like I thought it should and everyone in my office raved!  I made a double batch, we only had about 15 people in the office that day and I only had a tiny bit to take home.  I've been asked by almost all for the recipe.

Pretty tasty after I added more white pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, onion powder, turmeric, and more curry. I cut the fat by using a tsp of olive oil to saute my garlic and onions instead of the butter and I used evaporated skim milk instead of regular evaporated milk. Will use this one again.

Definitely can't taste the pumpkin!I tried making it a second time with other reviewers suggestions! I added sugar, nutmeg, and even a half can of pumpkin more to the soup. Still was very bland! Perhaps my expectations were too high! I'll keep looking for a pumpkin soup that I enjoy!

Aweseome Autumn soup. I bake my pumpkins I use for Halloween decoration and freeze the mashed pumpkin for holiday deserts. I had an abundance this year and was looking for something new to try. This was great, even my kids, who hate my experimenting with new dishes, loved it. It was even better the second day warmed up.

I like pumpkin soup and I love curry, so I thought this should be a perfect soup recipe for me... But when I tasted it, I asked myself where was the pumpkin! It's a delicious soup but, in my opinion, not pumpkin curry, just a curry soup.

Oh my goodness, this is SO good!!! If you want it spicier, I'd add more curry and crushed red pepper. A great way to kick a cold (though opt for soy milk instead if you are sick). Also a great source of Vitamin C!

I am giving this 4 stars because it needs a few modifications.  I added more pumpkin, more curry, salt n pepper to taste and used heavy cream.  The result is a thick creamy yummy soup.  You can taste both the pumpkin and curry.

This is my husbands favorite autumn/winter soup! Lost the recipe and had to go searching for the "one". I always adjust the seasoning to taste anyway- we like things a little spicy. So...follow your taste buds. I add more curry and white pepper. Don't skip on the cream.. it's sooo worth it! I'm always asked if I'm making "that soup" for Thanksgiving from family and friends.

I have been making this soup for years, and it never disappoints. Cooks up in less than 30 minutes with very little effort. Have tried many modifications over the years, but the original recipe is still my favorite. I do use fat free evaporated milk to make it healthier, and add additional curry and salt to taste. I like it thin, but could see adding more pumpkin or reducing liquid to thicken it. Rather than the mess of a blender/mixer, I use my immersible hand blender--works like a charm!

AMAZING!  I didn't know what to do w/ my canned pumpkin and evaporated milk leftover from Thanksgiving...so I checked allrecipes and made the yummy curry soup!  It is so flavorful--you can add as much curry as you like, that I'm going to make a big pot for an event coming up.  I'm going to add some carrots for a little more thickness and serve w/ brown rice.  I didn't blend the soup b/c I like the texture of chunky pieces and found it to be AMAZING!

This was a great easy recipe!  I used coconut milk instead and used others suggestions of a little more curry powder.

If you are craving pumpkin this will fill your desire.  I've make this twice now and love it each time.  I've always wanted to make a creamy pumkin soup (versus the rice/chunky version) and this fit the bill.  The curry is a nice complimentary spice.  If you are looking for a soup that is unique to serve at a meal this one is wonderful.  Even those that aren't the biggest pumpkin fans think it's good.

I.  Love.  It.  I'm a real soup nut anyway, but god this was good.  After making it as directed, every time I'd reheat it to have a bowl I'd add something to try it.  More curry, perhaps?  Or some golden raisens.  Some corn?  It was delicious all the ways, this flavour just goes with everything!

I was getting tired of using my leftover pumpkin puree for desserts so I decided to try this. This soup was much better than I expected it to be. I used skim milk instead of evaporated milk so it was a little thin but I liked it like that.

Delicious and easy!  I make this every fall!  I did make some changes to give it more flavor: I increase the curry by 1 tsp., add 1 T. of honey and decrease the evaporated milk to 8 oz.. It's always a winner with guests!

Wonderful recipe for blustery weather.  I use homecooked pumpkin and chicken stock,using more pumpkin (homecooked has more water in it than canned) and less chicken stock since it is richer than the canned broth.

The absolute best pumpkin soup ever!  I jazzed it up by using double the chicken broth, double the onion, double the curry power and by using some flour and milk paste to thicken at the end - it was delicious!  Great topped with homemade croutons.

This soup was good but I did not have a blender to puree it and think that is why it did not turn out as expected. A little too bland for me.

this tastes great and is easy to prepare.  the first time i made this i didn't puree it and it was still tasty even with chunks of onion, but, do puree it if you have time.  this is a flavorful soup!  yum!  also, don't add too much salt!  i added the listed amount and it was too salty for my taste.
