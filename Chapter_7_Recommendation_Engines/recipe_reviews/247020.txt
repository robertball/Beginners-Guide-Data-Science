I made this twice. The  first time I made it, my potatoes were way too crunchy despite  a lot extra microwaving time. So I tried making it again and slicing the potatoes super thin and  still had the problem of crunchy potatoes and sad looking green onions.  In the future I will  bake the dish in the oven instead of using the microwave.  Crunchy potatoes aside the flavor of the dish was good and the leftovers were good cold.  I  recommend the recipe but just not the microwaving part.

I personally loved this recipe!  I made it today and ate it for lunch.
It was delicious!   I didn't have enough of the small potatoes so I scaled it down to just me.  Now, I am going to have to make this again for my husband, because it was something that I know he is going to love!
My only change was to squeeze some fresh lemon  on the finished product.   Delicious and refreshing!  AND I got to use my microwave to make it!  Thanks Lutzcat  for the recipe!

We thought this was a very easy way to add a side dish to a meal---or just for a meal on its own with a salad and some bread.  The directions were pretty much right on.  My potatoes were a little larger than what I thought was meant by small, so I cut them a little narrower than called for but cooking time remained the same.  Thanks so much for the recipe and the idea of this dish!
