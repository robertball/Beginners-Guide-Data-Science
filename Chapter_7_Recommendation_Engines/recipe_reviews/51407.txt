Delicious!!  I didn't have a jalepeno or a can of green chili peppers on hand so I used some Mexican style ROTEL instead.  It made it colorful and was perfectly spicy, and the quiche was delicious!  I had 3 coworkers from my department ask me for the recipe.  Very easy recipe as well.  Will definitely make it again.

I liked this very much!! I seldom give 5 stars to any recipe, but this one was / is worthy. "Quiche" is inaccurate as there is no crust, but as I searched for a great quiche I found this, lucky. My wife needed a dish for a girls-only brunch so I tried this. I subbed HOT sausage and the HOT Rotel tomatoes in lieu of the spices & peppers. I mixed the Rotels with the eggs, then sprinkled a little cheese over the top. I cooked mine 30 minutes as the additional liquid from the Rotels required more cook time to evaporate. VERY TASTY !!! EMPTY DISH!! Wife HAPPY!! Life is good!!!

This was so good, I could eat this every day. The only thing I did differently was add half a tub of light cream cheese to the egg mixture, which made the quiche even creamier and tasted wonderful when combined with the spices. This is a definate keeper!

The pie crust recipe I have makes two crust, so I just used one for my regular quiche and the other for this recipe.I made the pie filling just like it is in this recipe, but I only wsed 4 eggs and mixed them with 2 cups of milk and added about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and salt and pepper. That how I make the egg filling for every quiche. It turned out great!!

This was wonderful tasting!  I don't even like egg dishes very much, but this was great.  I did one thing differently:  I used fresh chile peppers and added the peppers and onions to the skillet with the meat to cook them a little before going in the oven.

The Food Lover's Companion describes a quiche as "a pastery shell filled with a savory custard made of eggs," making this recipe a breakfast casserole, yes?  Despite it's improper name, the final product was delicious.  Who needs the extra calories/fat of a crust anyway?  (-:

I used Italian sausage and no jalapeno peppers.  I also cut into it prior to the 10 minutes of cooling time and drained out a lot of the fat.  My picky boyfriend absolutely loved it!

This was awesome. I did change some things because I wanted to put it in a regular pie pan with a pastry crust, though. I halved the spices, cheese, peppers, sausage. I added 1/3 cup milk and used 6 eggs (5 didn't quite fill it out enough), then baked for an hour. I only changed it because i was afraid I'd have too much for 2 people to eat, but now I feel like I could eat the whole thing myself! Smells great with the peppers and sausage, tastes delicious!

Made this for camping. Did all the prep work ahead of time and put them in baggies. Put eggs in qt. jar for traveling so just had to shake it up, add spices and pour over layer other ingredients which were prepared ahead of time.  It was easy and tasted sooo good.

Added can of drained diced tomatoes.  Used 8 eggs (that was all I had).  Cooked 20-30 min.  Halved salt.  Used chopped green pepper instead of green chiles.  Very good!  Thanks.

My whole family loved this recipe. I did use two Pillsbury crusts in the bottom (and up the sides, of course).  It is very tasty and filling.  My family of 6 had plenty to eat and even a little left over.

I did add a little more onion than the recipe called for and also a layer of mushrooms.  I sauted the onions and mushrooms before adding them.  I'm sure it would have been just as good as written.  Either way this is a five star meal with just the right amount of zip for my taste buds!!!

Fantastic.  Only change I made was instead of the jalepeno pepper I used red and orange sweet peppers.  It took around 28 mins to be totally cooked through.  I had to peel myself away from it, it was so good...  Will be making this again for sure.

Awesome! I added a layer of sliced mushrooms and salsa. I also put the cheese on the top instead of in the middle. I prepared this the night before, refridgerated it, then heated it for about 45-50 minutes at 375. Absolutely delicious!

This is a really excellent recipe for a more tex-mex style quiche. When I have extra eggs I make this all the time! Some good additions to try for more or varied flavor are bell peppers, or anise in addition to the cumin. (Since I have whole cumin seed I frequently grind it fresh and throw in some anise for fun.)  It's best if you can get some breakfast sausage, like the kind that already has fennel or cumin spice in it, but if you need to you can brown the sausage with the spices you enjoy most.

Awesome!  I made this for breakfast and it was a big hit!  I have to admit I cheated a bit.  I had some turkey sausage crumbles in the fridge so I used them instead of frying mine.  I liked the idea someone mentioned of adding Rotel so I drained a can and layered my sausage some chopped onion the Rotel more chopped onion (never can be too much onion for us!) then added the can of drained green chilies,cheese and egg/spice mixture.  Having no chili powder I used a bit more cumin and threw in some cayenne pepper.  Yum!!!  Going back for seconds now!!

AMAZING - I will be bringing this quiche to brunch! Made just like recipe only without jalapenos.  Turned out well with lots of flavor.  The flavor of this quiche really surpasses any other quiche (or breakfast casserole) I have ever had.

I use this recipe all the time.  I also make it in small portions -- adding pie crust in muffin tins to make mini quiches or just leave out the crust and it will make a perfect size for adding to English muffins or on croissants. You can mix this the night before and cook in the morning a great time saver.

My family really liked this!  I did make some very slight changes, but mostly I stuck to the recipe.  I used 6 corn tortillas to cover the bottom of the baking dish (I seriously dislike the taste of over-cooked eggs and the corn tortillas ensured that the eggs didn't burn/over-cook on the bottom).  I used 14 eggs since 10 wasn't enough to cover the casserole.  I did add a little bit of milk to the eggs as I beat them.  My only other changes were that I added a can of diced tomatoes, well drained, over the sausage and I ended up cooking this for about 30 minutes or so. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and the result was very good.  I sprinkled some green Tabasco sauce over my slice and it was so yummy that way! My family all went back for seconds!! I will definitely make this again. (Next time I think I'll use a can of Rotel tomatoes for a little more kick.)

This was okay, but will make some adjustments next time I make it. We preferred the filling as a breakfast taco instead of a casserole.

The only things I have against your recipe is that it sticks to the sides and bottom of the baking dish (I never thought it would do that) and it's just not spicy enough.  I will keep the copy of your recipe, but if I make it again I'll be sure to put more jalapenos in it and/or sprinkle some cayenne on it.
I thank you for sharing your recipe though.

I had never made a "quiche" before, but I agreed to make one for a work brunch.  I tried it out first on my sister and brother-in-law and they LOVED it.  The sage sausage is key.  They are also on the atkins diet so this was perfect for them.

I used turkey breafast sausage, and added a layer of salsa and Rotel on top of the sausage. I also used 2% Milk cheese to cut some fat. It was EXCELLENT! Needed to cook a few minutes longer, plus I like the edges a little crispy. A great healthy, low-carb brunch dish!

I made this for work yesterday and everyone LOVED it!  I took another reviewer's advice and instead of the peppers and chilis, I substituted a can of rotelle tomatoes with chilis.  I also used spicy sausage.  This is a GREAT breakfast casserole.  Everyone will be wanting the recipe!

This was really good – I did make some changes though – I used a cup of red onion, added a red pepper, I increased the chile to a cup and a half and left out the jalapenos. I used a dozen eggs and added a half cup of evaporated milk. I used more chili powder and more cumin and more pepper, I also used 3 cloves of fresh garlic. (I like a lot of seasonings.) I left out the salt – I figured the sausage was salty enough (and it was), and added basil and parsley. I also covered the top with additional shredded cheddar before sticking it in the oven. It turned out really good – very spicy – but not too hot. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make using what you have on hand. Good for breakfast or dinner. I halved the recipe. I used home made spicy breakfast sausage and fresh eggs from our chickens. I only had green pepper, onions and dehydrated cherry tomatoes in the freezer. Served with sour cream and salsa. I will make again.

Fast and yummy.  Thanks for sharing.  Half the recipe fills a 10" pie plate perfectly. 

Took the heat up a notch with La Sabrozita Limon, lime and chile hot sauce drizzled over the plated quiche.  Ummm good.

Next time I'll cook the onions with the sausage and add mushrooms, too.

I love crustless quiches! I made this for a potluck and it was devoured in no time, so delicious! I used a hot Italian sausage and sauteed the onion with it toward the end, to soften it a bit.  I always add a bit of heavy cream to my 'quiches' so for this one, a generous 1/2 cup. Season it to your liking, outstanding!

We made this close to the recipe, we simply added an orange bell pepper. This dish was simple, and wonderfully delicious. There were no leftovers as we made this for dinner one night. This is going to be for breakfast most times, but made a quick and awesome dinner as well. Will be making this again!!

5 stars for taste, 4 stars because I made changes.

I was trying to use up some fresh anaheim chiles and 3/4lb of monterey jack chipotle sausage, and settled on this recipe. I subbed the jalepenos and canned chile for 6 fresh anaheims which I seeded, diced, and sauteed with the onions. I did NOT add the salt or pepper because I thought that after cheese + sausage it would be salty enough. I also used 1 cup of mixed mexican cheese.

I had to cook it for 35 minutes before the egg was done. This might be because I am at high altitude.

It was AMAZING. The egg cooked up fluffy and it was just a bit spicy without overdoing it. My kids all had seconds, even the picky one, and they usually have different tastes. We will definitely make this again using fresh or roasted chiles (New Mexicans don't do canned).

I was hesitant about making something with so many eggs but this recipe turned out great! My 13-year-old turned up her nose at first but enjoyed it very much. My 8-year-old scarfed it down with no complaints which is equivalent to "yum." This dish is so versatile. I may try spinach and feta cheese next time. 

I did make a few changes:
- Included diced red bell pepper for color and flavor
- Doubled the amount of jalapeno and added extra onion
- Sauteed the veggies until fragrant and tender
- Used Italian sausage as well as breakfast sausage (didn't have enough)
- Added a bit of milk to the eggs and thickened with some flour
- Mixed in Adobo seasoning, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes for more of a kick

I used Rotel tomatoes instead of green chilies and jalapeno, and Jimmy Dean hot sausage instead of regular.  It turned out great!  I'm hoping it will be just as good reheated.

I thought this was delicious and easy to make.  Not too spicy, something different for my New Year's Eve party (we did a breakfast theme).  We used soy sausage because of the vegetarians attending and it was just as good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Made it for a church brunch and not one bite left. It was a hit. I didn't have green chiles so I added a little extra jalapenos. It was delicious. Kept everything else the same.  I liked that it was gluten free for people who can't eat gluten. Will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly by the recipe. Spicy, hot and delicious! I used hot Owens pork breakfast sausage-I’m from Texas! It would be good with turkey sausage also. I am on the SCD diet and used sausage that has no added sugar, or other illegal ingredients, to make it SCD legal. My husband loves it, too. It’s a keeper!

I used green jalapeno tabasco instead of the jalapenos and used 6 eggs, 1 3/4 of skim milk, 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup butter. I also did not use chili pepper or the chilies and combined the cheese just to using cheddar. It turned out amazing.

Quite good. I used a Tex Mex cheese since that is what I had.  Omitted the salt as sausage is always so salty.  Glad I did.  No garlic powder (allergic to it), or jalapeño. Everything else the same.  It was easy and quick to make.  I like other people’s suggestions of adding mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers.  All that would just add more flavour and I will do that next time.  But it was delicious just as the recipe is.  Just the right amount of spice.

my family loves this and it cooks up much quicker than overnight bakes.  this morning, i used a pound of sausage, skipped the veggies and added about 2 (small) cooked leftover potatoes from last night's dinner, plus 6 eggs.  it's what i had.  used a 9x11 dish. served 5-6.

VEGETARIANS: I used the Morningstar Black Bean Burger Crumbles in place of the sausage, just use the full bag. I also added in chopped tomatoes. Very tasty and would make many times again! I will mention that I had to almost double the cooking time for this, however. The eggs were not cooking as fast!

Delicious, easy , flexible recipe that is a nice dish for a hearty, protein packed breakfast. Served it to the boys ( and men) before a long day of skiing...it kept them going until early afternoon! Of course, the caramel rolls I served helped sustain them as well! ***one side note for high altitude baking- I live at 9500 ft , so I had to add about 10-12 extra minutes to baking, and I turned the temp to 350. Check the dish often to make sure it doesn't over bake.

Loved this dish - made a few recommended changes for some more kick! Used hot Jimmy Dean sausage, swapped out Monterey Jack for Pepper Jack, used 1 can of Rotel instead of chile & pepper (used Hot Rotel, but would recommend Original if you like it less spicy). Also added some sautéed asparagus, and added in 2 slices of chopped up Prosciutto, which crisped up beautifully. With the saltiness of the Prosciutto, cut back on the salt. Was absolutely delicious.

I halved it and put it in a pie crust.  Absolutely outstanding and a real man pleaser to boot. The chile peppers added moisture as well as a light kick; combined with the cumin and chili seasoning made the eggs flavorful and kept the breakfast sausage from being the dominant flavor.

This tasted wonderful!  I wasn't in the mood for the seasonings suggested so I just added salt and pepper and along with the spice of the sausage, it was still good.  I also made 1/2 of the recipe and cooked it in a 8x8 pan and it took about the same amount of time.

I love this recipe. To save time, I cook the sausage while prepping the other ingredients, including mixing eggs with the spices. Also to change it up so my daughter will eat it (she hates spicy foods,) Rather than using chiles and jalapeños I substituted 1 cup of chopped green pepper. Great recipe!

This was delicious!!  Made this for Christmas brunch but omitted the jalapenos and onions for the older family members.  Will definitely be adding them next time :-)!

Thank goodness this tasted better than it looked!  Mine came out very thin using the listed amounts of egg and cheese.  I don't know if it'd have puffed up more if I'd added milk?  Also, it seemed that my eggs separated as the whites were identifiable.  The finished dish looked quite strange!

I was looking for a basic, traditional, country kind of quiche or casserole to use up some plain sausage.  Had trouble finding what I was looking for so I thought I could tweak this one appropriately. I swapped out seasonings since my family has had a lot of mexi dishes lately.  Left out the hot peppers and used green bell pepper instead.  Left out the chili powder, cumin, and garlic.  I doubled the black pepper and added a pinch of cayenne pepper to add flavor and a little kick to an otherwise basic egg and sausage dish.  The flavor did turn out pretty good; hubby and teens liked the taste even though it didn't look great!

I followed the recipe except I added some green onion & small tomatoes from my garden to give it a little more color.  Took it to work for a pot-luck and got rave reviews.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, made this twice and it trurned out great both times. The Family loved it.  Also reheats very well as leftovers.  I topped with salsa and sour cream for an extra level of flavor.

Yummy! I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious. Next time I will try Rotelle. It should cut down on prep time and I think adding tomatoes will only make it better!

This was really good!  I didn't use the peppers, but it was still very flavorful.  Great breakfast for us since we are on the Atkins Diet.

An odd flavor combination. We added double jalapenos and it was still a bit bland considering what the ingredients were. Just not for us.
