My family absolutely loved these. I changed the filling to Lingonberry or Rasberry preserves, and they were gone soon as they were cool enough to eat!

I've been making these for the past 3 Christmases, with seedless strawberry or blackberry preserves.  They never last longer than a day in my house!  Very delicious and pretty.

I just made these and I don't think I made them right because they turned out way too big and I only got 2 dozen. Furthermore, the marmalade filling came out the sides and burned some of them quite badly. I think I'll try them again though, hoping that I can make them smaller next time. I think I'll change the filling to nuts and cinnamon too.

I liked this recipe. I might adjust the sugar of the dough, since I think it needs a tiny bit more. The centerpiece of this cookie is the filling. I had the chance to get almond flour which is mostly grated almonds and used it instead of grinding my almonds.  I was a bit in a hurry. The result was very good. I will make it again with the adjustment and maybe use amaretto to enhance the almond flavor. If you are afraid of the liquor flavor I doubled them both and you could not taste it. As an overall the cookie is very good just use the best preserve you can find out there it will make the recipe totally worth the effort!

Made this using mince meat as the filling. Family loved it, starting next Christmas it will become a holiday tradition in our household.

These were just okay for me. I didn't have any white wine so I just doubled the amount of rum in the dough, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I used apricot and raspberry preserves for the filling. The dough smelled amazing, but seemed to be lacking in taste.
