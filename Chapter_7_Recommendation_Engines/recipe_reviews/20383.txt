These are very very very good, but you must add the dry to the wet instead of wet to dry.  Dont add all the dry, just add till mixture is at desired thickness.

Best Berry muffin recipe I've tried.  The yogurt makes for a nice texture, and keeps them so moist.  I also added 1/4 cup Wheat Germ for added nutrition.  I like how you can change the yogurt and the fruit to make different types of muffins.  My kids loved them!

I had originally intended to make muffins, as the recipe calls for, however once everything was mixed, the batter was incredibly thick and unusable.  I decided to add milk to make a cake like consistency, and baked it for almost an hour in a 9 by 9 glass pan.  It turned out tender and moist, and has a nice flavor to it.  I used mixed frozen berries, rather than just strawberries and it was pretty good!

Delicious cornbread.  If your kids don't like chunks of fruit just skip the fruit and stick to whatever flavor of yogurt you like.  Doesn't even need butter--makes a delicious and nutricious lunchbox treat.

Delicious.  
I substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for white, used medium grind cornmeal, non-fat peach yogurt (6 oz. plus splash of milk) and frozen mixed berries.  I couldn't keep my hands off of them!  I did not coat berries with flour mixture as dough was so thick it wasn't neccessary - no problems with berries settling.  I also did not thaw, chop or add sugar to the berries.  The whole wheat was a  wonderful and healthy addition and did not adversely affect texture.  Great and simple recipe.

this was a very good recipe; a good alternative to cornbread or sweetbread. i used an 8x8 pan instead, just baked it for about 25-30 minutes. it was easy to slice and service like regular cornbread.

Fabulous recipe! Moist, easy to make, stays tender for several days. Beautiful texture and flavor. Try peach yoghurt and canned peached for a variation.

I just loved these muffins, although I did make a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup of butter, yellow cornmeal (didn't say in the recipe whether to use white or yellow) I did not have any yoghurt on hand, so used sour cream mixed with strawberry extract.  I just loved the texture that the corn meal gave to these muffins.  Plan on having a play around with different fruits in the future. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is quite yummy and different from your regular muffin.  I used non-fat blueberry yoghurt and frozen strawberries (since it was too early in the year for fresh). I'd recommend draining the frozen strawberries after they've thawed, or add a bit more cornmeal or flour, to keep the texture of the dough from being too "gooey".

WOW!  I used unsweetened individually frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries) and cut them into smaller pieces - no need to defrost.  I also used mixed berry yogurt to match.  These were tender and just sweet enough!  Our yogurt comes in slightly smaller than 1 cup containers, so I added enough milk to make 1 cup.  The proportion of corn meal is just right.  Warm from the oven, or even cold the next day, these are a winner!!  Can't wait to try them again during strawberry season.

I made these a few weeks ago.  I was very excited to give them a try....the combination sounded really interesting.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  When they were fresh from the oven they were pretty good....but as they sat the berries made the muffins mushy....and that wasn't appealing....I don't think I'll make them again....sorry Shelley but thanks anyway.

These were pretty good muffins. The batter is thick, but as a muffin maker knows, muffin batter can range from thin cake like batter to thick cookie dough like batter and turn out beautifully either way.  This is somewhere in the middle.  And I added wet ingredients to dry and used up all of it.  The only problem I had was my fresh strawberries were sour.  When we split them we had to sprinkle sugar on them.  I saw another strawberry muffin on this site and they said to chop your strawberries up and pour a 1/2 cup sugar on them and let them sit for 1 hour then drain.  I may try this to sweeten my berries next time. I will make again, and let them cool a little before taking them out of the pan, as they fell a little while taking them out as they were very hot.

This was moist and had a nice flavor. I wasn't sure about the cornbread texture but it didn't taste like cornbread, it tasted like a strawberry muffin just with a gritty dense cornbread texture. I drizzled a little vanilla glaze over the top to dress it up a bit for my family and maybe distract them from the cornmeal part.

I had the same problem as several reviewers... as written the dough was impossibly thick and dry, no way was I going to be able to turn it into muffins. I didn't add anything, but chose to make a loaf instead. It tasted good, my kids loved it, but not sure how to fix it for muffins. As for gooey strawberries, that is just what happens with strawberries I have found. I see how some wouldn't like that. I'm only giving 3 stars due to not being able to bake as intended (in muffins).

The purpose in baking these today is that I have some fresh strawberries and a 6 ounce container of strawberry yogurt that I need to use up. Instead of AP flour, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and followed the rest of the ingredients and directions. I added the dry ingredients in small batches to incorporate the batter well. The batter is thick, however, it is also wet, not dry, and still manageable. I filled each muffin tin 3/4 full and I ended up with 14 muffins. My muffin tins may be a bit smaller than other bakers. These baked up quite nicely in 25 minutes. The muffin top is a nice yellow color with bits of red strawberries peeking out. It made for a nice looking treat. The strawberry taste is definitely there, juicy and sweet, and a plus for me.  The texture of the muffin is nice and I believe that it is the yogurt that helps to make this a moist muffin. This is definitely a cornbread - with fruit inside. This recipe leaves room for a variety of other fruit flavors such as raspberries, blueberries, peaches, mixed berries, etc. An easy recipe to bake and a nice, refreshing snack.

These were okay, but not great.  The flavor of the cornmeal was nice, but we didn't care for the crunchy texture.  We also would have preferred a little more sugar, making these a little sweeter.

My daughter made these for 4-H. The only things we did different: only had 6oz yogart; tossed cut fruit in tbsp of sugar due to the strawberries not being quite ripe. This is an absolutely deliciuos recipe. We will be cooking these on a regular basis with different fruit & yogart combinations.

Maybe I did something wrong or maybe I'm just really not a fan of cornbread, but I didn't like these at all.  The cornbread taste was too overpowering for me.  I gave them 3 stars though because my 2 year old devoured them.

I thought these muffins were pretty good but they came out a little chewy...but that could be my fault for using applesauce in place of the butter.  I also added the juice and zest of a lime and some minced basil.  Hubby really liked the flavors.

These muffins were okay, but I don't think I would make them again. I didn't have strawberries so I used raspberries instead. The muffins didn't seem sweet enough.

Made these with non-fat strawberry yogurt and fresh strawberries.  I liked the crunchy texture the cornmeal gave(fine-ground cornmeal used) These are not overly sweet but sweet enough.  Perhaps if using non-flavored yogurt, would need a bit more sweetness.  They baked up nicely and made 6 Texas-sized muffins.  Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter but really couldn't taste...next time would add 1 tsp. to enhance the flavor a bit.  Nice muffin for breakfast or a healthy snack.  Great to use up fresh strawberries that may be a bit less eye-appealing for straight eating.

Very easy, very tasty, and very simple. I used fresh strawberries and blueberry yoghurt - the combos are up to you!

exactly what I was looking for, I subbed 1/4 of the cornmeal with Millet as I really Like crunch....and added a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  topped with cornmeal before baking and have to say yum!  used blueberry yogurt and blueberries defrosted.

My family loved this recipe. But if you are looking for a very sweet muffin - this is not for you. The muffin's natural sweetness comes from the strawberries and yogurt.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion and up my butter (margarine) amount to 1/2 cup. I did not have strawberry yogurt but only cherry, we could not tell the difference.

Great for a breakfast muffin.  I think my family was expecting more of a dessert muffin, so they gave it a pretty good smack-down.  But we ARE talking about a muffin with the calorie content of a granola bar (as opposed to a normal muffin, which has pretty much the same nutrition facts as cake), and for that it's pretty eatable.

These muffins were moist and delicious! I used only 1 cup of berries (frozen, with a bit of freezer jam mixed in as ours was about to go bad) and also used plain yogurt to cut down on the sweetness. They also cooked in about 15 minutes so make sure to watch them carefully!

These make for a yummy grab-and-go breakfast. I used strawberry Greek-style yogurt (or any high protein, low-carb yogurt) to cut out a bit of the sugar and add in extra protein. Also substituted 1/2 cup of the sugar with baking style Splenda. In the first batch, I substituted the melted butter with applesauce to reduce the fat, but found that it made the muffins mushy - which completely negates the wonderful crunch of the cornmeal. Few tweaks, but overall great recipe that I make at least once a month!

These were delicious.  I made them with frozen strawberries and it still came out moist, I also used fruit on  the bottom yogurt for extra strawberries.  Will make again.

Yum! I used raspberry yogurt and about 1 cup of fresh raspberries, then followed the recipe exactly. The batter did seem a bit thick but they turned out beautifully. Thanks for a healthier sweet snack!

We love this recipe. The only change I made is substitute 2 Tablespoons of oil and 2 Tablespoons of milk for the butter. These muffins are good hot. They only store well for a few days, so eat them fast.

These were excellent!  I made them with organic french vanilla yogurt and frozen organic peach slices, chopped into small pieces (not quite 2 cups though, more like 1 - 1 1/2 c).  I also reduced the cornmeal to 1/2 c and added 1/4 c wheat bran.  They were delicious warm and also good the next day - I reheated them in the microwave for 12 seconds for breakfast - yum!  Next time I think I will try substituting applesauce for the melted butter.

I loved the idea of a strawberry corn muffin, but I modified this recipe to make it a bit healthier. I substituted with 1/4c of Splenda, 2tbs canola oil, and added 1/4c skim milk and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I also only used 1 cup of chopped strawberries and used 1 cup of whole grain corn flour instead of 3/4 cup of cornmeal. By doing so I eliminated the saturated fat, halved the sodium, halved the sugar, and doubled the dietary fiber. My family loves them! Thanks for the idea.

These muffins are easy to make and so versitile; I use whatever kind of fruit I have on hand (blueberries, strawberries, cherries, etc) and the corresponding yogurt flavor.  The come out perfect every time and get rave reviews.

so easy. tolerates changes well- my frozen berries got mushy so instead of blending them into the batter i did 1/2 batter/spoon of mushy berries/ 1/2 batter. I ran out of berries on the last one and used a spoon of jam.  I only had self rising cornmeal so I decreased the baking powder to 1 tsp. Nice texture and flavor, will make again but I will make 10 to 11 muffins instead of 12- I like them raised just over the top of the pan and these were a bit short. ? maybe I needed that extra 1/2 tsp of b. pwdr.  Thanks

Very good texture and a slight strawberry-cheescake flavor.  I sprinkled organic sugar on top to enhance the crust.

These are wonderful.  I had the premade cornmeal mix (already comes with most of the ingredients listed).  The strawberries I had on hand were already going bad, so I substituted some berries I had in the freezer.  Yummy!

A great recipe made with strawberries - fantastically moist - they were all gone within an afternoon!  If they are made in patty cases leave them till they are nearly cooled otherwise they will stick but overall a winner and all sorts of fruit could be substituted depending on season.

These got mixed reviews in my house. I liked them a lot - I used a 10 oz bag of frozen raspberries, thawed them and sprinkled them with an extra 2 tablespoons of sugar. My husband, however, found the cornmeal to make the muffins gritty and when eating them hot found that "the raspeberries were the precise temperature of napalm!" Let them cool off or even serve them at room temperature.

Very tasty muffins.  I used frozen strawberries and added a little sugar and let them sit for just a few minutes before mixing.  Can't wait until next year's berry season and try other kinds.  Thank you Shelley!

Very tasty!  My favorite variation is with blueberry yogurt and blueberries.  Add 3-5 minutes to cooking time when using frozen berries.  Because this is a nice thick batter, the berries don't all fall to the bottom in any version.  Best to let muffins sit for a while in the pan before removing, as this lets them "settle."  Muffins are great warm (but not hot) or at room temperature.  Enjoy!

This even worked well at high altitude. I can't say enough about how good these are. I even made them as mini muffins and they are the perfect bite of soft, sweet, fruity yumminess.

Loved this! I used half plain yogurt and half strawberry yogurt which resulted in a not-too-sweet muffin that was great for breakfast. I also used a combination of strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. My son is already asking for more of these. Yum!

I needed a snack for my daughter after her nap and was tired of feedding her the usual grapes and cheerios so I made these in my mini muffin pan (baked for 17 min) and they were perfect for her.  I used frozen strawberries and light sour cream since I didn't have yogurt on hand.  I also added a tablespoon of ground flax and 1/4 cup of wheat germ to make them more nutritious and she loved them!

Made these since I had an abundant amount of strawberries I picked. They were delicious.  Don't put too many strawberry pieces in each muffin to keep them from becoming soggy after they are baked. Distribute them evenly.

Followed the recipe exactly, using fresh strawberries, and they turned out great ! Moist and tasty, with no hint of burning or sticking using a greased muffin tin.

I made these tonight and they are already almost half gone!  I love the mix-and-match options this recipe provides - I'd love to try it with lemon yogurt/blueberries, raspberry yogurt/raspberries.... I used brown sugar instead of white, and used ~2c flour instead of the flour/cornmeal mix.  I only had ~1 1/2 c frozen strawberries, so I added in one frozen mashed banana. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!
I sub'd GF flour for all-purpose flour and apple sauce for the egg to allow for my son's allergies and it was a big hit.

I made these muffins for a work breakfast, and they got rave reviews. I made them in "big" muffin tins (the kind that only has 6 per sheet), and was able to make 8 muffins with this recipe. I loved how light they turned out - the yogurt is a great touch. Thanks!

Very moist and flavorful.  Used strawberry yogurt (only 6 oz.) and ripe, sweet strawberries.  Serve these warm- they lose their appeal when they're cool, although they're still ok.  It's easy to prepare, but requires quite a few dishes - 1 for the dry mix, 1 for the wet mix, 1 for the strawberry coating, and the muffin tin.  Overall, they are a treat.  My family liked them.

Very good recipe. I used a note from a previous "rater" and soaked my strawberries in about 1/2 cup of sugar for about 20 mins before adding to the mix. They turned out wonderful. The added sugar does add extra sweetness. They didn't even last 20 mins in my house!

Not what i thought they would be, but they do get addictive! i substituted sour milk for the yogurt. They are very low in sugar, a good snack for diebetic's.they are more like a corn muffin with fruit.

Yummy muffin that I would make again.  Ladies I shared them with loved them.  No issues with batter being too thick as others have mentioned...maybe they are using 6 oz cups of yogurt thinking it is a full cup?  Only change was that I added chunky sugar to the top before baking to give them a fancier bakery type look.

I've made these twice, once with frozen berries and once with fresh. You can always find fresh and I would recommend using that so they don't weigh down these fluffy and tasty muffins. So easy and wonderful. Great option for a healthier muffin.

Moist, flavorful and easy to make.   I used coconut oil instead of butter and I used Cup 4 Cup gluten-free flour. I used plain Greek yogurt  flavored with vanilla (love that you can vary the recipe with different yogurt and berries) and raspberries.  I only had course cornmeal and I used that.  Next time I'll use just regular cornmeal, course was too crunchy.  I didn't have any trouble adding the moist ingredients to the dry and then folding in the berries.  I think it is important that you coat the berries with the 1/2 cup flour mixture. Added 5 minutes to the baking time. Definitely will make this again.

I wish I could give it more stars!  Our favorite version is with key lime yogurt and raspberries.  The possibilities are endless and always yummy.

So I can't give this an honest rating because I subbed buttermilk for the yogurt and oats for the cornmeal, and apparently used way too many berries as I had more of a blueberry cobbler thing going on in my muffin tins. HOWEVER, the taste was still pretty good. I feel confident that had I followed the instructions more, it would have been a success.

I really enjoyed this recipe! They just got out of the oven and I can't keep my hands off of them. I'm interested to see how they'll keep with the berries as a few people have mentioned that they make them soggy.

I made these for breakfast this morning and I love them! I used Cabot low-fat vanilla bean greek yogurt since that's what I had on hand and I think I'll always make them that way :) filling, not too sweet, and dense and moist!

Easy and pretty good.
I omitted the strawberries and replace the muffins with fresh diced pears.  I do think the berries would have added more flavour than the pears, but overall, they were pretty good.
I used 1/2 plain yoghurt.
I liked the texture of the cornmeal; it was not overpowering.
I will make these again.
:)

good twist.  Better with 1/2 the cornmeal replaced w flour, too gritty otherwise.  Used fresh raspberries.
