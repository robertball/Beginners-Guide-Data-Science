Why doesn't this have more reviews? It is restaurant quality stuff. I used organic boneless skinless thighs and cut them in straps. Marinated one hour in fridge,  added garlic and set on counter to warm up a bit.  Pan fried since we don't have a grill. 

Served with sautéed sweet onions and shitakes over brown rice.  Cabbage salad with sesame dressing on the side.  

We eat things hot in this house,  so I added ghost chili flakes and cayenne to the marinade when I added the garlic.  

I can't wait to make this again!

I agree with the poster who asked "why aren't there more reviews?"  This is an extremely easy AND tasty recipe:  just like my favorite 'Number 57' at Toronto's Saigon Palace! (May it rest in peace!) I make this one or two times per month!

Now, if I could just master the fish sauce.... mine isn't quite right but cooked with some rice on a bed of lettuce... Unbeatable!

I even froze it with the marinade (after 2 hrs in the refrigerator), defrosting it just before cooking on the grill.  

It was GREAT!

As an aside, the Asian Bowl on Young Street, Toronto has an excellent grilled meat plate, including grilled chicken and beef!

I love the flavor of lemongrass and this dish did not disappoint! So yummy! I made the marinade in the morning and cut the chicken into 1 inch pieces and left the chicken to marinate for the day (approximately 9 hours). I put them on skewers and grilled them on a grill pan. Served them over rice with grilled veggies. My husband AND my 3-year old looooooved it. So yummy! Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a stronger lemongrass flavour for my chicken - I marinated for 2 hours and the lemongrass taste was quite light.

Very easy, quick, and delicious. A great weeknight dinner. I substituted lemon rind as I didn't have lemongrass, and it worked very well.

I have made this a few times now and the whole family love it. A few tips/amount changes: I use a whole lemongrass stick, 2 garlic cloves and juice of a whole lemon to save fluffing about. I also pop all the marinade ingredients straight into my smoothie blender to blend to save chopping. I made this ahead and freeze the chicken in the marinade so I can pull out in the morning on a busy weekday and by the evening it’s defrosted and ready to cook. Comes out perfectly marinated

Awesome!! I marinated this most of the day and I could have done it longer!  So delicious with the fresh Vietnamese vermicelli bowl for noodles and veggies.  Couldn’t have been a better dinner!

Very good - I used lemongrass from a tube instead of fresh because that was what was available, so the lemongrass flavor was not very strong - but the marinade was tasty and the thighs came out beautifully on the grill. Would make again.  Might consider adding some ginger and would definitely try to find fresh lemongrass and see how that works.

Fantastic! I also cut organic skinless/boneless chicken thighs into strips prior to marinating for about an hour. Replaced soy sauce with GF tamari due to gluten intolerance. Pan fried as we didn’t have access to a grill but it still caramelized beautifully. Served on top of rice with shredded lettuce/carrots and thinly sliced cucumbers. Then I gave everyone the option to add sauces according to taste: chili garlic sauce, hoisin with chopped peanuts, and  nuoc cham). Absolute winner of a recipe! Enjoyed by all, no leftovers. Think I will try with pork next time.

Very nice marinade. Not quite five star. The lemongrass was not the star with all the other bold flavours in the marinade. Still a tasty chicken dish but longer marinade time with twice as much lemongrass would be my recommendation.

Used to make asian glazed chicken thighs from this site. Now my fav recipe for thighs is this one. I did change the marinade, added a bit of sesame oil and minced fresh ginger, and used vegetable oil instead of canola, but such flavor! And as I did with the asian glazed chicken thighs,   my hubby basted them with hoisin sauce.

This is delicious as is but I added a teaspoon of curry powder, fresh minced ginger and a teaspoon of sambal paste.  The additions added a bit more personality to the recipe.  This is a keeper for sure!

I made this dish tonight and got rave reviews from my husband who flies for a living and brought me back some dried lemon grass spice for me to try.  I like to challenge myself with new recipes and this is a definite winner.  Brining your chicken breasts ahead of time makes for a more tender meat!

Amazing dish. For a more restaurant taste and fragrance, I doubled up on the lemongrass. I also get the organic crush lemongrass in a tube. You don't get the cruchy lemongrass pieces that way.
A familly favorite.

I usually make a recipe the first time as written then make changes the second time. This was perfect as is but might add a little chili powder next time.

This was a subtle recipe. I think some ginger might've livened it up a bit for myself, but it was good for the picky eaters. I had planned on grilling outside, but wouldn't you know, thunderstorm... I baked at 425 for 40 minutes. Skin came out perfectly crispy and chicken juicy.

I will make this again but increase the lemongrass.  As made, it had just a hint of lemongrass flavor.

I will make this again but with REAL Vietnamese fish sauce...! The non-Vietnamese fish sauce just is not as tasty as the Nhuoc Mam that is Vietnamese..!

Easy and delicious. Didn't have fish sauce on hand so I used a splash of Japanese Mirin.  Will make again.

One of my favorites.  We usually make this with flavor cubes, but ran out, so I had to find the scratch recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added:  1/2 diced onion, 2 minced hot chili peppers, 1 tbsp salt, used lime instead of lemon.  I removed the skin and fat from the chicken and cut thighs into quarters.  I stir-fried instead of grilling.  I serve with rice and steamed broccoli.

Delicious ! I added more of each ingredient and marinated chicken thighs in the fridge a couple of hours. Hubby and guests loved it.

Weather was bad so sauteed on stove instead of grilling.  Worked great.  Also used chicken breast and ate it as a lettuce wrap instead of rice paper.  Added a dash of rice wine on the wraps.  Was awesome.

Also tried it with fish instead of chicken. Worked great.
