Delicious! I was wondering if the saltiness from the cheese would be enough, and even considered adding a bit of salt, but I refrained and I'm so glad that I did, as it was perfectly seasoned. This was so simple...a keeper for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious.  Made in oven.  Set temp 400F.  I sliced first batch too thin.  1/4 inch worked best.  No need for salt, the butter and Parmesan seasoned them perfectly.  Garlic lover... Added 2cloves.  On third batch, no need to spray pan, but added a little Italian dressing on pan.  Still as delicious.

I made a modified version of this recipe because I didn't have enough butter and I had parmesan flakes (not the grated stuff). I sprayed olive oil on the sliced zucchini, added salted sunflower seeds and blanched almonds. Grilled for 15 mn on low, stirring a couple of times. Zucchini was getting a little soft. Then added the cheese flakes and cooked for another 10 mn. It was amazing! 2 people ate 5 small zucchini. I normally figure 1 small per person, but I wanted to have leftovers. No leftovers whatsoever! I never thought to prepare zucchini this way, it's genius!

Excellent. I used zucchini and yellow squash.  Covered it for the first few minutes then uncovered and added the cheese.

So simple and delicious! I used additional garlic (garlic paste - I was feeling a bit lazy) since we love it s much and I did not brush both sides of each piece.  I sprayed the foil, brushed garlic butter on the foil, laid on the zucchini and then brushed on the remaining butter.  Hubby even ate all of his and he's not a vegie fan!!

Absolutely loved this! My guests who wrinkled their noses at zucchini, tried it and ended up having seconds and thirds! I used garlic powder rather than fresh, only because it was convenient, but it still turned out tender and delicious!

Very good. Put in grill basket and grill on high flame. Would be good in a foil packet baked in oven, too.

7/22/18 - This was good, we sliced the zucchini like pickle spears.  Followed recipe exactly.  This was great and looked nice on the plate next to a marinated swordfish and some Alfredo pasta.

Very good! I didn't add salt; it didn't need it! I added a little soy sauce to half of it just to experiment and was just as satisfied! I sliced my zucchini a little thick, next time I will slice it thinner!

I brushed these bad boys with olive oil and seasoned with a little Italian seasoning, garlic powder and some all spice.  Then grilled with the shredded Parmesan.  My kids and husband ate it up!  Perfect use for some of the zucchini from the garden.

Wow! My husband told me 4 times during the meal how this was the best roast beef he has ever had! I used a chuck roast, dunno how big, and left it in the slow cooker for 1 hour on high and 5 hours on low. I didn't use the carrots but I followed the recipe otherwise. This is a keeper!

Used oven (400 F for 15 min.), garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, & olive oil instead of butter. Stll delicious.

I added a sprig of asparagus on top of each piece and used real shaved parmesan.

Simple but tasty! This is the perfect side dish when you BBQ since you just throw it on the grill. Make it your own by adding additional spices.

i was feeling lazy and wanted a simple dish so i chose this.. i'm not sure what i was expecting, but this was a little on the plain side to me.. to give the dish credit, it *was* fast and easy.. i used a good sized yellow squash for the zucchini.. a little less parm (about 1/3 cup) and butter/margarine (about 2 T).. i used my garlic press instead of mincing it (again lazy).. we put this on dying charcoal from our cook earlier and then threw it in the oven to finish it off.. i ended up sprinkling some peppery rub (Salt Lick Original Dry Rub) and was satisfied.. if i were to try this again i'd add some italian herbs.. something to make it pop

The only thing I did different was grilled inside in a grill pan and used Feta Cheese instead of Parmesan.  Lovely
