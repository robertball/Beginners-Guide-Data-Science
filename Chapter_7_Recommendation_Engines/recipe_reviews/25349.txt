This bread tasted horrible! The molasses gave it an awful taste and it was very bitter.  I will definately NEVER make this recipe again.

After reading the other reviews, I wasn't sure I wanted to make this. Since someone mentioned that the molasses made this taste nasty, I decided to substitute it with corn syrup. Good call! I ended up adding about 3 tablespoons of that, and then 3-4 tablespoons regular sugar. This was the best cornbread I've ever had. =) Even my sister, who formerly hated cornbread, enjoyed it. Yum!

RE: the other reviewers who say this is missing something, or who don't like the
"whang" of molasses--add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. When you cook with molasses you always need a bit of baking soda to bring out the flavor and tame the "edge".
Good recipe if you like "Yankee" cornbead.

Having read prior reviews, I used maple syrup instead of molasses, and I also added corn to the batter. This was not the best cornbread I've ever had, but it was good for a low-fat recipe. I'll probably make it again because it's healthier.

Probably won't be making this one again, it I do it'll be greatly modified.  I liked the different flavor from the molasses but it was missing something else in taste.  I didn't like the texture at all it was very spongy and nothing like I expect cornbread to be.

I'm sorry, but this was just plain tooooo bitter! And I even added a little sugar to the batter. 

On the bright side I liked the texture. Maybe making it without the molasses wouldn't be too bad.

I loved it although I added jalepenos and a bit of oil. Yummy!

My main complaint? too much salt. I think 1/2 tsp would serve better... I also didn't find it sweet enough. It could use either more molasses or some sugar. The texture was nice though and it was very moist.

Good substitute if you don't like your bread sweet. To us the molasses was subtle but not over powering. We used buttermilk because that is actually what we had on hand.  Very versatile.

I substituted molasses for two heaping tablespoons of molasses sugar, used almond milk, and added a glug of oil because I couldn't believe the recipe didn't need it. Turned out great!

I subbed a gluten free all purpose flour mix instead of regular flour and water instead of milk-- it took about 40 minutes to finish in the oven, but the one bite I've snuck so far came out great! It was much more on the savory side, and I think I'll add less salt and more molasses (or honey, etc.) next time I make this.
