I love this recipe and so does my picky boyfriend.  I add some honey to the mustard mix to add a bit of sweetness.  I have also used both stone ground and Dijon and it works well either way.  For the bread crumbs I always used ritz type crackers and add classic Italian herbs and grated Parmesan. Which I believe make the best coating. The last suggestion I have is to make cuts into the chicken, just over half way through the breast, and add minced garlic into the slices. It add a nice flavor and keeps the chicken incredibly moist. Oh yeah, and I also leave out the lemon juice because I rarely like the flavor.

The first time I made this it was with a generic 'spicy brown mustard,' and I was disappointed with the lack of flavor. Then I made it again using prepared Coleman's English mustard and, boy, did it make a difference! Really tangy and delicious! The only change I make is to add a little finely-grated Parmesan to the bread crumbs. I would also consider mixing a tbsp of honey with the mustard. Great recipe. Thanks!

This was so good! I pretty much stuck to the recipe with the exception of the following: Used unseasoned panko crumbs, Olivio instead of butter, and I baked it for 30 minutes on 425 degrees. I also removed the foil for the last 7 minutes of cooking to crisp it up. Topped with a pinch of locatelli romano, which I also mixed about 2 tablespoons in with the panko. It was so delicious, I will be making this again. Low calorie too! Served with roasted asparagus spears, and brown n' serve rolls for the man in the house. Excellent! In a later version of this, I put fresh mushrooms in the dish and let them bake with the chicken. Oh my! This recipe is now a weekly favorite at mi casa!

I had never baked chicken before and this turned out great! I used german mustard with about 1.5 lbs. of free-range chicken filets. It was really easy too (though be prepared to get your hands messy!)

Fantastic recipe!  It was quick and easy and tasted great.  We loved the spicy mustard flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it, I served it with mashed potatoes with onoin and chive cream cheese mixed in and carrots and gravy.  YUM YUM!!!

Pretty good overall but here are a few suggestions: I used a Dijon mustard=very good! But go easy on the lemon/water drizzle because the chicken was swimming in greasy water to the point where the crumbs didn't stick. Broil the chicken for the last couple minutes to keep it crispy.

This was really good with a few modifications. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce and used panko style bread crumbs along with a shake of parmesan cheese on top before baking. I thought it was baking up kind of dry even with the butter so I poured a small amount of chicken broth in the pan to moisten them up. The end result was a moister more flavorful chicken breast. I would make this again with my same revisions. I also used 2 kinds of mustard. Half stone ground and half Golden's spicy brown.

Chicken with mustard & bread crumbs.  :l  It looked better than it tasted.  I scraped off the coating & used the chicken for something else.

We loved this recipe!  I didn't have brown mustard on hand so we used dijon.
We love adding garlic to every recipe but didn't this time- and it was VERY tasty without.  I did add extra Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs about a TBS.  This was VERY tasty and VERY moist!
I cooked it for 10 minutes longer than stated with the cover on as my chicken was still frozen.  GREAT RECIPE!  3 Kids under 8 loved it!

Not great but very good. I needed more bread crumbs than the recipe called for but other than that everything worked out fine.

I took Caroline C's advice and added 1 Tablespoon of honey to the mustard and Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and it was great! One suggestion I might make is to uncover the chicken with about fifteen minutes to go, so the breadcrumbs get a little crispy. All in all, a really good recipe.

This chicken is amazing! I LOVED this! I doubled it because we have a large family. Small changes I made- cut slits in the chicken and stuffed with fresh garlic as suggested before, mixed brown sugar in with the mustard, only put the mustard mixture on the top of the chicken, added parm. cheese, salt and pepper to the italian bread crumb coating, only covered the chicken for about 30 mins of the cooking time and I cooked it on 400 degrees instead. I made this with honey roasted red potatoes from this website, cheddar biscuits and creamy garlic pasta! We will be making this again!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  I found that the chicken was a little dry.  I didn't love the flavor.  Maybe it was the type of mustard that I used (a good brand, not cheap).  This won't go on my list to make again.  Sorry!

I used Dijon instead of spicy mustard and it was pretty flavorful. Only thing I will do different next time is use less butter. It was a but greasy.

This recipe was good but I wouldn't say it was the best.  It did give me the idea to coat chicken breast with some Italian Pesto salad dressing before breading...that was very yummy!!

This was really awesome. I followed the advice of some of the top reviewers and cut slits into the raw chicken before starting. I then stuffed crushed garlic (marinated in lemon and dill) into the slits before basting the chicken with mustard. I also drizzled honey on the top, after the breadcrumb mixture had been pushed on.   It was excellent. My boyfriend and I ate them in big, seedy seasame buns, with a side of tabouli salad. Will definatly make again, using all varieties of mustard. Thanks!!!

I made this dish for my husband and I the other night and both of us were really disappointed.  I used Coleman's mustard as another reviewer suggested in order to get the maximum mustard flavor but you could barely taste it!  If I used something as strong as Coleman's to make this dish and still couldn't taste the mustard flavor, I don't think anything else will work.

Always looking for new chicken recipes and this one is a keeper!! I didn't have paprika so I used cumin and it worked great! I also sprinkled a little bit of lemon pepper to taste as well. This is going into my regular rotation!

This tasted great and was easy to make. I liked the addition of lemon butter at the end. I fileted the chicken breasts to make it more moister and flavorful.

I tried this one night when I needed a new recipe for chicken.  We eat alot of it, and wanted to try something new.  We LOVED this recipe.  I also added garlic to the breadcrumbs, and since we didnt have any spicy brown mustard, I added some dijon mustard to honey mustard and used that instead.  It has a wonderful flavor, and smells great when it's in the oven!  My picky 7 year old even loved it, and wants it again for dinner tonight!

This was really good!  It was so simple too; just goobered up my hands quite a bit!  That's ok though.  I used a good quality, organic brown mustard mixed with a snooty, gourmet whole-grain dijon.  Lol.  Cut the recipe in half; the baking time was really accurate.  I used unsalted butter since the mustard provided plenty of sodium.  Served with Honey Roasted Red Potatoes from this site and steamed broccoli.  Very delicious!

Yum!  I made this for my boyfriend last night and wasn't going to eat any myself, as I'm not a big mustard fan.  But I gave it a try, and I loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

i gave it 4 stars because i had to change a few minor things. i only had dijon mustard so i mixed that with 1tb of honey. i also used panko bread crumbs mixed with bread crumbs from leftover homemade bread.this came out so good and so full of flavor! i don't understand the reviews of it being bland or the ones where it is too much mustard flavor. i also didn't have any grease floating when i uncovered it. the coating crisped up nice for me after i removed the foil and cooked it about 10 mins longer.for a recipe that i wasn't sure of..it turned out to be a winner in my house! thanks a different and delightful recipe.

This was ok but needed a bit more flavor (believe it or not). Maybe some garlic. It just tasted like brown mustard over chicken.

This recipe was so easy! I went by the directions, but added parm cheese to the bread crumbs. I used whole chicken breasts and was going to double the amount of ingredients since it called for chicken breast halves, but didn't have to. We didn't really taste the mustard, but my family was okay with that. My family loved the bread crumbs, so next time I would make a slit in the breast and stuff it with bread crumbs. Will def be making this again.

Extremely flavorful chicken! We also used panko bread crumbs. Next time I'll use a pan with low sides because I suspect the high side on the corningware kept it from fully browning in the last 15 minutes even though it was uncovered.

These were good. I used Dijon mustard and panko bread crumbs. Also, as other reviewers suggested I added a little bit of garlic powder to the crumbs. The only thing I don't agree with is the amount of butter.  I only used about a half of a tsp. drizzeled over each breast and instead of pouring some around the chicken - just sprayed the pan with PAM. They came out very tasty and moist with a crisp crust. Thank you for the recipe. We will make these again for a super quick meal.

My boyfriend and I love this recipie!! I would maybe say 4.5 stars but he is 5 across the board!! Every week I go shopping he suggests this as one of our dinners....so I have made this many times....I do sprinkle the chicken with a mess of extra bread crumbs so it has a crunch when finished

I made a few changes, added honey to the mustard and some curry powder. Used chicken thighs as the coating is heavy. I thought this was very good but beware, this has a very heavy mustard flavor. If you do not like mustard a lot, avoid this recipe.

I don't normally like chicken, prefer beef, but this is my new favorite dish.  Have used a variety of diffferent mustards, usually with a touch of honey added.  Also mix half and half of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  Fantabulos even cold, the next day (if there is any).

I forgot to take a picture but this recipe turned out fantastic! I have a very picky 12-year-old little girl but never east proteins. She actually ate two pieces of this chicken and asked for more. I didn't change anything on the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. I will make this again!

Great recipe!  Very easy and quick to make.  The chicken came out moist, tender and very tasty.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using garlic flavored breadcrumbs.  We really enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

Very tastey. I didn't have the spicy brown mustard so I used dijon, allspice & a little brown sugar. I had some baby carrots & room in my dish, so I threw them in next to the chicken. We put the extra sauce on some rice. Easy meal!

In our house we prefer meat that has been marinated overnight so I did that with the suggested 1 tbsp honey and the spicy mustard. A tiny bit of black pepper and salt as well. Adding parmesan cheese to the Italian style Panko was a hit. I broiled the chicken for the last 3-4 minutes. Thank you ShadowB and thank you reviewers. This is a keeper!

This was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made for chicken, other than just grilling it.  Very good. My husband and I just loved it, and I will be making it often.

Very easy to prepare and tasted great. Served with rice pilaf. The adults really liked it but the mustard might have been a bit too spicy for the kids.

My boyfriend loved it. Every time I make something from this website, I always ask him what he would rate it..and he always rates dishes lower than I do. He has only said 5 a couple of times..where as I have said five on most of the dishes I have made. This one he rated a five.  If he says it's a five..that means it's good. Thanks
