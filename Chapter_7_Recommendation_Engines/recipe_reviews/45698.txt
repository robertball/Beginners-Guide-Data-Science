This is a really good alternative to the boxed neocitran... I however altered the recipe by using the 1 serving method, but keeping the lemon amount the same.  So therefore I used 1 cup of water, 1 tablespoon of honey and a full lemon, just because I love the taste of the lemon! Enjoy

My Oma used to make this for me when I was a kid and nothing tastes better when your throat is sore and raw. I cut the amount of water down to one cup but kept the lemon the same. Very comforting Paula....

This was perfect for my sore throat. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1 cup water, 1 tablespoon honey, and juice from a whole lemon. Very soothing. I will definitely be using this every time Im sick.

Very good- soothing on the throat. Juice of 1 lemon is approximately 2-3 tablespoons of reconstituted bottled lemon juice.

I've been feeling cruddy today with a sore throat and swollen glands. I needed something to not only comfort but soothe.
My grandma used to make this for me when I was a kid and was sick. 

I made this for one, using half of a lemon and a little more honey. This is just what I needed.

Well of COURSE it's not as good as ice cold lemonaid! This is a good alternative for either a sick child or someone who doesn't care for hot tea or that awful-tasting TheraFlu.  Another variation of this can be made with bottled lemon juice if you don't have a fresh lemon on hand and suger in lieu of honey.

I woke up feeling a bit under the weather--despite my efforts, looks like I'm getting bf's cold.  I decided to try this, and it is certainly helping soothe my throat.  I just boiled one cup of water and mixed it with the same amount of lemon and honey.  No rum for me--a little to early for that today!  Thanks for the recipe.

I had to double the lemon juice and honey (too weak otherwise) but after I did, this was pretty tasty and really helped my husband's sore throat.

This is something my Mom used to make when I was little and had a cold - it brings back nice memories  :-)  She used a splash of red wine instead of rum.  Even without the alcohol it's a great hot drink w/ no caffeine.

Heated 2 cups of water in the microwave. Rolled a lemon & sliced it into my teapot. Poured water over lemon slices to steep. Added honey to mug of lemon tea. Yum!

This was really good. I did use a bit less water, probably about 2 cups, just whatever fit into my small coffee cups.

I had a chill and this took it right away.  My husband had a full blown cold and said this was very comforting.  We used 2 cups of water as we wanted it nice and strong.
