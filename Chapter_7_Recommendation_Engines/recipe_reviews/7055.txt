This makes a smaller loaf. I didn't have oat bran, so I used toasted wheat germ. I also didn't have caroway seed, so I substituted fennel seed. It turned out GREAT!!! The whole family loved it. Thank you for awonderful recipe!

Excellent black bread! Taste and texture are great; moist, not spongy, won't fall apart when you spread butter on it. Even my 2-year-old grandson likes it a lot. The fact that I no longer have to buy this type of bread from "specialty bakeries" makes it that much better.

My husband said this didn't taste like the Black Bread he'd had while stationed in Germany, but that it was still very good.  I don't have a bread machine, so I made it by hand.  The crust is crispy and the inside tender and firm with a good texture.  The kids loved it, too!

This is one of very few recipes that comes out nice in my Sunbeam breadmaker.  It had nice flavor and texture. The loaf had a nice shape also. I don't keep oat bran in the pantry so substituted cornmeal with good results

Awesome bread! I have looked all my life for a soft rye bread and this is it. I followed instructions in the bread machine but then formed it into a round loaf and put it on a sheet with cornmeal on the baking sheet and sprinkled more on the top. I slit the top about 4 times with and X and let raise until doubled. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Crisp crust with soft inside.  Enjoy!

It's great to have a black bread choice for the bread machine.    This is a little strong,   so I cut the cocoa a little, and the vinegar. It is very flavorful.   Thanks.

Fantastic! I baked this in the oven at 350 degrees for half an hour and it was perfect. Everyone who ate it loved it. This bread takes me back to the Middle Ages when this was the common bread. Delicious.

I substituted fennel seed for the caraway seed since I didn't have any.  I also don't have a bread machine, so I baked it at 190C for 35 minutes and it turned out great.  The bread tastes great and the fennel seed adds a nice flavor.  I would've given it a five if I didn't find the cocoa powder to be just a tinsy bit overpowering.

This isn't bad, but I certainly wouldn't call it European or black bread.  Tastes like a regular rye that you can purchase at the grocery store in the USA.  I didn't think it would taste like European black bread, so I wasn't disappointed.  My parents are here and my mom liked it, so it's a success.  Rye isn't my favorite, though, so I probably won't make it often.  Thanks.

I thought this is too soft to be called European bread. This is rather American style sandwitch bread. If you like soft textured bread, you will like it. I am not going to make this again.

Something doesn't taste right in this recipe - I wouldn't call it European at all.  Thanks for letting me try.

Good bread, but not as European as I was hoping. Still looking for an Austrian type bread recipe to satisfy my husband.

I was excited to find this recipe because of the calorie count, but I am wondering how the nutrition was computed, because the flours, oat bran, butter and sugar alone are over 1,000 calories. At 10 servings, it has to be over 100 calories, not 46. If it actually is 46, I need an explanation. Otherwise, the calorie and carb counts are dubious. The bread was just as I rated it: OK. Not worth 100 calories a slice.
