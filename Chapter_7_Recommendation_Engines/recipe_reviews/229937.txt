This soup was super easy to make and was perfect for a quick meal after a day of shopping.  It's a good start to a great soup. I liked the addition of coconut milk and the cinnamon was a nice touch.  Very tasty! I felt like the soup was lacking something though.  I had to add some salt and freshly ground pepper.  The condensed tomato soup left a bit of a bitter and acidic taste. I think letting the soup cook a bit longer would help mellow out the bitterness or even adding a pinch of sugar. Fresh garlic would also work well in this soup, or even garlic powder if you're trying to save time.   This would also be very good blended.  If I make this again, I might take my immersion blender to the pot after the soup is cooked.  I would probably also use regular coconut milk instead of low-fat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic I won’t be making tomato soup any other way from now on. I am thrilled I decided to try this.  All the ingredients come together nicely.

I think it tastes best without onion and without cinnamon. Load up the cumin!

I always have the ingredients for this in the house! Minor changes: I use curry instead of cumin, and only about half since we don't like a lot of spice. Otherwise, great soup!

This was super easy and really delicious and filling.  The coconut flavour is not overpowering, but definitely noticeable, so if you don't like coconut flavour, best to avoid this recipe.
Also, I didn't have canned tomatoes so I just cut up a couple fresh ripe tomatoes and threw them in.  so so good.

I didn't have canned diced tomatoes on hand so I used a half can of tomato paste and it turned out nice too.

I used regular coconut milk instead of light coconut milk and puréed all of the soup.  It tastes even better the next day.  We served it over Mexican-cilantro rice as a sauce for the rice and my family loved it!  Next time I will add cooked chicken or fish and serve it over the rice as a main dish. YUM!
