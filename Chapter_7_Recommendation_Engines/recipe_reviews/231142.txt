I made this with yellow bell pepper slices and mozarella cheese and chopped a regular onion in the food processor using about 1/2 of the onion in the recipe.  This was delicious!

i've never made chilaquiles before and had a bunch of stale tortilla chips to use up.. this was the perfect recipe to give me some direction.. i'm not going to mention how i did everything differently only that i added black beans and sliced black olives.. didn't have the cilantro or avocado called for in the recipe but i think they would be great toppings for this dish.. ty for the inspiration

I tried this out with my husband and two youngest teenagers. Everyone loved it! One son toped his with parmesan cheese and the other topped his with mozzarella. The serving size for teenage boys and hubby was rather small. I was told to double it next time and have queso drizzled on top. I'll let you know how that turns out.

Simple and sweet.  Perfect Cinco de Mayo recipe.  Suggest adding salsa and bacon/ chorizo.

quick and easy - used green enchilada sauce, cheddar and feta cheese, red onion and cilantro. I had left over carne asada so included it with the saut√©ing of the chips. Once warmed up sprinkled the onion and cilantro on top, poured enchilada sauce to balance with the amount of chips I used; placed the eggs on top of the  mixture and broiled it. Delicious. I'd use unsalted chips next time, between the enchilada sauce and the salt on the chips it was too salty for me.

I thought this turned out pretty bland.  My husband and kids really liked it though!
