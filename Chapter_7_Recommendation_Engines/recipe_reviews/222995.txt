I tried this today after my neighbor gave me a huge bag of loquats.  They are a very cool, crisp fruit.  The only problem I had is with oxidation/browning of the fruit as I cut them.  So I put them in the lime juice and I used the juice of the whole lime instead of the 1 tbsp.  Next time I may use a lemon instead.   The salsa came out perfect to go on top of our fish dinner!  This is a great summer salsa! It takes a few extra minutes peel and slice those loquats, but it wasn't so bad.
