This is good and quick.  I made a few changes to give it a little more flavor.

I cooked fresh chopped garlic and diced shallots in the olive oil before cooking the chicken, which I also sprinkled some pepper and garlic powder on.  The rosemary was a little strong so I used less than recommended.  When I had all the ingrediants added I squeezed an entire lemon in.

To use some of the extra broth I cooked the rice with a broth / water mixture.

This was an easy recipe and everyone
enjoyed it. I added 2 teaspoons of
Italian spice for flavor. It didn't
take long to make and makes enough
for 6 with no problem.
