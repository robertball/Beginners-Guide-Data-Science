I've made these three times so far and they are always a hit! Be careful though - I didn't think it possible but there really is such a thing as too much horseradish!

I made these for my office Christmas potluck this afternoon, and they were the first item off the buffet table. I only managed to get one of them before they were gone! Followed the recipe exactly, and it couldn't be easier--no chopping at all! Squeezed the filling from a sandwich bag with a snipped-off corner, as a few reviewers suggested (great idea, because I brought the filling, stored in the bag, to the office, and then stuffed the eggs before serving). One note: I used "extra hot" horseradish, but it was in no way extreme or unbearably hot with that much mayonnaise to support it. I will definitely make these again!

These are incredibly delicious!  I went overboard with the horseradish, becauase I love it, but 1 tablespoon is quite sufficient.  This was a favorite with the guys at our family Christmas party. Quite festive served on a tray adorned with fresh parsley and a few grape tomatoes.

Okay, so normally I don't like devilled eggs but I LOVE these. Swear to God. I made two small adjustments which is added a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders. I doubled the recipe, too. Insane good. Like they should be illegal. A double recipe, almost gone by nine am and I'm fixing to make more. YUM! NOTE: I couldn't find my cool tips to make pretty filled eggs, so I just scooped the filling into a thick freezer bag and snipped off the edge. Wa-la, instant piping bag. EDITED: I made another batch, tripled and my family is now inhaling it! EDITED AGAIN: Second batch lasted two hours. This is my new deviled egg recipe.

I followed the recipe as written, but did use fresh dill rather than dried.  Since we've found that horseradish varies jar by jar, or brand by brand in terms of "bite," it might be wise to add it to taste if you're bashful.  I would suggest adding the salt and pepper to taste as well.  No two taste buds are alike!  Aside from these minor suggestions I wouldn't change a thing, as Hubs and I both agree these might be some of the best deviled eggs we've ever had.

Best deviled eggs I've ever had!  I did use regular mustard as opposed to the ground mustard and it was perfect.  Next time, I think I might try to add a little dill relish too.

These were OK.  A little too salty after sitting in the fridge all night.  The horseradish was excellent, and I added a little (less than 1/2 t) prepared mustard in addition to making the recipe as stated.  Will make these again with only minor changes.

I absolutely adore horseradish, but I have learned now that I do not like it in deviled eggs. I could eat it on or in just about anything, but I guess not eggs. It's an ok idea if making for yourself if you like horseradish, but I don't think many guest would be impressed. Not a bad idea, just not for me. Thank you for posting your recipe.

Everytime I make deviled eggs I try a new recipe. These have the best taste to me so far. I mixed everything in a big ziplock bag to minimize waste and it made it easy to pipe into whites. I think I will increase the dill next time and another thing I did differently was to put the horseradish in a small strainer and let most of the "water" drain out. I learned this from another deviled egg recipe - I had omitted this step and found that the water made the filling too runny.

this one gets high ratings from me. I made it once for friends and then at another holiday meal with family and they all liked the extra kick from the horseradish. Much better than the same old thing.

These were really tasty. The worcester sauce  was a nice component with the horseradish.
I used spicy brown mustard instead of the dry mustard.
Good recipe.

I'm sorry.  These are just average.  I like my mom's just pain old recipe better.  So did my family.

We love horseradish.  It sounded so good.  As I said, just ok, not bad, just not worthy of the rating it received on your web site.

This was EXCELLENT!  These disappeared in about 5 minutes.  I used horseradish-mustard and omitted the dill weed and substituted parsley instead.  I'll probably be adding some chili powder to this mix next time though.  Cannot go wrong with this recipe.

watch out! one tablespoon is waaaaaaay too much horseradish!!! Tried this was disgusting at first, I had to boil 6 more egss, double the mayo and dill to counteract the overpowering horseradish. After that they were okay, still a bit overpowering, but not as bad as the first time.

Great Recipe IF YOU ARE A HORSERADISH FAN.  We made these for our New Years Eve party.  My only suggestion would be to blend all of the ingredients together minus the horseradish, then add horseradish to taste.  This recipe was great for me (I love horseradish) but many party goers found that the horseradish was "just too strong".    Next time I'll add the horseradish last.  I don't want to overwhelm the guests.

I'm in love. Not normally a huge horseradish fan, the combination of flavors here are fantastic! I used a fork to strain the water out of the horseradish and I eyeballed the mayo - definitely didn't use the full amount because it just doesn't need it. I would love to add some kind of crunch... trying to decide what without altering the perfect flavor... This is a new craving!

Just made these tonight for a small Superbowl party.  I thought they were great!  I don't recommend using a hot horseradish, as that might be overpowering for non-horseradish fans.  I used normal horseradish - it was noticeable but not overpowering.  Will definitely be making these again!!

These were good and a nice change from the usual deviled egg recipes. I followed suit and added less horseradish to begin with, but ended up using the whole amount in the end (I guess my horseradish was not very hot). These won't replace our favorite deviled egg recipe, but it was nice to try something new! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love the horseradish, but your forgetting a few dashes of tabasco and even a little ranch dressing kicks it up a bit. Otherwise, just like mom makes! That's how this Texas girl likes em!

I love horseradish and mustard.  I love these eggs.  I don't think the horseradish is overpowering at all; it just gives it a nice 'zing!'  Whenever I make these I get great reviews.  I have made as is and I have used dijion mustard instead of the powder.  Both were great!

Made these deviled eggs wth horseradish and they were so easy to make and tasted so good. I followed the recipe exactly how it states and they came out perfect! Being that i'm not a cook in any way, I will be making these for our next party. Simple, fun, easy and tasted great!!

For years I have been searching for the perfect deviled egg recipe.  This is not it. I didn't like the horseradish and dill combo.  I'm beginning to think I already have the prefect deviled egg recipe - my old standard!

I've made these a couple of times now and I like them more each time I make them.  They absolutely disappeared when I served them over the holiday weekend.  Everyone enjoyed the horseradish twist on an old favorite.

Easy please-y and very tasty!  This will be my go-to deviled egg recipe from now on. Scaled ingredients for 24 eggs with excellent results.  I inadvertently added a bit too much ground mustard and think the called-for amount will be just right.

These are excellent and give the "old" deviled egg recipe some zest.  I made the first time as written; next time added some grated cheese.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for the recipe.

Perfect Deviled Egg Recipe.  I use 2 T of Horseradish sauce rather than prepared horseradish.

This is my go too recipe for deviled eggs.  I always use Miracle Whip though.  Different brands of horseradish will make a difference so be careful and use one you love.  We have two brands of prepared at our store the one with a green top always seems hotter than the one with the white top.  Also the creamy horseradish spread you find with the mustards is also good to use just cut down on the mayo a bit.

Never put horseradish in my deviled eggs before. So this was something different.  I took these to my friend's house for the Thanksgiving Dinner today.  They all loved them.  I used French's Horseradish Mustard.  So horseradish and ground mustard were already mixed together.  It was awesome!!!!  Thank you for this horseradish idea.

Wonderful!!  I made one small change, out of necessity, and used dill relish rather than dill weed.  These eggs are incredible!!  My husband tasted the "filling" to make sure we liked them enough to add to our party menu for tomorrow.  My only concern now is that I have any left FOR the party tomorrow.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Really nice twist to the standard deviled egg. People should snap these up at a gathering. My hubby ate 3 before I could even get them wrapped for a party.

 I LOVE horseradish, and have been known to sneak a bit extra in :) I do use a squirt (1/2 T, maybe) of yellow mustard  just to punch up the color/

I loved this recipe but for everyone else it was hit or miss.  One person suggested I cut the horseradish in half, another person said it ruined the recipe all together!  Make sure your crowd likes horseradish before you serve these.  I do, and I loved them.

Horseradish taste was overpowering - perhaps I didn't use the right kind, but I followed the directions as best I could.  Won't make again with horseradish.

Thank-you thank-you! I have made 3 (yes 3) dozen deviled eggs tonight using 3 different recipes. I made a bacon chedder, relish/horseradish and this recipe. This one takes the cake! Simple enough so flavors don't compete. The dill brings out a fresh taste and I even toped them with a little wedge of cucumber and *viola*...excellent. Of course we all play around with measurements and I was no exception but that's to be expected right.

I served these at Easter dinner and they weren't scarfed up - like regular deviled eggs - but for those who like this kind of thing, they raved!  While this recipe is terrific, I think I'll simply make two kinds of deviled eggs in the future  ;)

This is almost exactly the way I make deviled eggs and they are always a hit. 
Seemsl like they are the first thing to go at any gathering. I haven't run accross anyone yet who doesn't like them.

I made these just as the recipe called, but cut the horseradish down to 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. They are DELICIOUS. Best deviled eggs I have ever made. The next party we  go to, these will be a dish I bring.

These were delicious.  Just a basic deviled egg recipe, which is what I was looking for.  I changed the servings to 20, but didn't add the suggested amount of dill weed.  For some reason, I am afraid of that spice.  :-)  Everything I did the same.

EXCELLENT! I've been looking for a spicy deviled egg recipe. Tried some with hot sauce, some with jalapeno, some with cayenne pepper.... None compare to this recipe! No amendments required; this recipe is perfect exactly as written! The dill and the horseradish sing together. This is my new standard deviled egg recipe.

These are great! I made these, and a standard "Deviled Eggs" recipe without the horseradish and dill weed, and with sugar and less mayonnaise. These were hands down - much better! The only thing I did differently is used a dash of salt instead of 1/8 tsp. And my 3 year old son loves them!

I have made this recipe twice now and both times they were a bit hit.  I used a creamy horseradish sauce this last time and the flavor was fantastic.  These really are addictive and the horseradish gives the egg an extra oomph!

A tradition in my husbands family was that at every party his grandma would bring her famous deviled eggs.  As soon as they hit the table they were gone.  They were that good!  Last year she passed away and no one thought to get her recipe.  I decided to try and find one to carry on the tradition.  The last family gathering I brought these and they were not only gone but it touched every one's heart that I would think to do this.  Who knew a deviled egg could bring people to tears.  So YES...I recommend this recipe.  It honestly is very tasty and I didn't modify it at all.

I used prepared mustard, otherwise stuck to the recipe, which is a challenge for me. I like to improvise! But, I had a crowd to feed so I figured this was popular as is so I shouldn't tweak. It turned out great. I always mash the filling and then use the whisk attachment on my hand mixer, and these came out nice and fluffy.

I was rather disappointed in these. I was expecting a much more robust flavor and instead I got plain ol' deviled eggs with a slightly bitter taste. If I was to make these again I would definitely add more horseradish but I really think that I'll keep looking.

These are good for when you are wanting something different from the norm, which was just what I was looking for when I tried this. My only addition was 1 TBSP. of prepared mustard.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made for Easter...cheers for horseradish!Loved what the horsey did for a classic recipe! A definite keeper, will use again and again. I doubled the horseradish- if you are an HR fan like we are, I would add the extra.

Excellent twist on a classic!  I added 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard which gave it a little more classic flavor (and skipped the dill because I was out).  Nice amount of horseradish!  This will be an annual recipe, at least!

Yummy!  The horseradish added a nice little kick and the filling had the perfect creaminess to it.  I used about 3/4 the amount of salt called for, but otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  A keeper!

Very good recipe if you love horseradish.

I made 10 eggs and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.

I thought it needed some sweetness, though, so I added about 2 tablespoons
of sugar...which makes this recipe a keeper for our family.

Delicious!  Everyone in the family enjoyed these.  Followed the recipe to suit, but decided to add 1 tablespoon of sweet relish for that sweet and spicy combo.  Garnished with salad olive and pimiento slivers, parsley, and paprika.

These are wonderful deviled eggs! I like things spicy as do several family members. I was even bold enough to add a "pinch" of cayenne pepper and even those who normally don't like extra spicy foods said they tasted great. I had no leftovers.

WOW!  The horseradish is the punch that deviled eggs need.  And I used hot creamed horseradish and it was perfect.  I did add a little more mayo because we like them creamier.

This is a very good deviled eggs dish.  May I suggest to reduce the amount of mayonnaise by half and to double the amount of horseradish to taste more the horseradish.  Perhaps the mustard can be replaced by dijon mustard instead to zip up the taste.

I made these eggs for a pot luck dinner last night and followed the reciepe exactly as written except for the mayo.  I used Miracle Whip because that was all I had.  I usually like to follow the receipe without making too many changes the first time I try it.  I think reviews that are based on complete changes to the original reciepe aren't really fair, but that's just me :).  I tripled the receipe, thinking I was going to be bringing alot of eggs home.  Boy was I ever wrong!  I think they were gone in five minutes and people were asking for more.  I think the dill really adds to the flavor with the horseradish.  I definately will be making these eggs on a regular basis.  I may even experiment with some ranch dressing the next time.  Thanks for sharing Ruth.

Wow.  I tripled the recipe and they were fantastic.  I used light mayo, fresh dill, and the regular strength (not "hot") prepared horseradish.  I was afraid that it would be too much horseradish, so I started with 2/3 the amount, but eventually I worked my way up to the full amount.  I was going to a party an hour's drive away, so I brought all the egg whites in a bowl and the yolk filling in a ziplock bag inside another ziplock bag filled with ice to keep everything chilled.  Assembled them when I got there, and piped the filling in by cutting the tip off the ziplock.  Worked perfectly.  This recipe's a keeper!!!

I made these eggs yesterday and love the horseradish in them although I probably didn't use quite a tablespoon because I cut back on the mayo a little and also use a little dijon mustard in my eggs (in addition to the ground mustard).  Very good!  I did not use the dill weed however because I've never really been a dill fan.

both my husband and i loved these. at first bite they tasted like normal deviled eggs, but then the horseradish pops up and gives them a great finish (especially if youre a fan of it!!) i will make these instead of regular deviled eggs from now on!

The horseradish gives these eggs just a bit of zip. I like to take the yolk mixture and pipe it into the whites using cake decorator tips. Topping them with a sprinkle of paprika, capers, olives and a sprig of parsley dress these tasty eggs party-like. Enjoy

I just made a double batch of these for our family Thanksgiving.  They were a huge hit!  I made them exactly as the recipe directs, and everyone loved them.  They were the first thing gone, no leftovers!  I will definitely be making these again.

Unfortunately even though I used eggs that were a week old (my mother's fool proof method for easy peeling eggs, my eggs did not peel easily at all and I ended up with scary looking eggs, so I just smashed up the entire egg like I would for egg salad and then added the suggested ingredients and made a really great cracker spread!  Thanks for the recipe.  It went over really well at our family Easter gathering.

These are delicious! I used a little less horseradish that the recipe called for because I wanted more of a horseradish flavor without the heat and it was perfect. A full tablespoon would probably be perfect for those wanting a little burn. :-) I will make these again for sure!

I've never been a huge deviled egg fan...until now!  These are FABULOUS!  I love the horseradish kick (be sure to thoroughly drain the horseradish first) but also the dill flavor.  Try it out on those who don't care for deviled eggs and i think they'll change their minds.  Excellent recipe!

Huge hit at parties, no modifications except that, instead of using store bought mayo, I make my own mayo using the Whole Egg Mayo recipe on this site.  It takes only one minute and I consistently hear that it provides a creamier, smoother texture to this recipe's yolk filling.      Also, do not use fresh eggs when making any deviled egg recipe.   Eggs are so much easier to peel when they are at least 5 days old.

When I read all the rave reviews I had to make these.  I wasn't sure if I liked them as they weren't "traditional" deviled eggs but I took them to a party and everyone went NUTS over them.  I am going to another party tonight and am making them again.

Excellent! I will be making this again for sure! I only made one adjustment. My husband and I tried it with and without paprika sprinkled on top. Although we generally like paprika, we thought it made the flavor a little too busy. Better to just be able to taste the fantastic horseradish flavor! (It does look prettier with the paprika though.)

I got this recipe from a magazine years ago. They are my favorite thing to bring to potlucks. Great recipe! I never used to eat deviled eggs before these. I always make sure to use a good brand of horseradish when I make these.

I love horseradish, and I used a grated horseradish without the vinegar, for me, it was a bit too much.  The consistency of the beaten yolk mixture was creamy enough I put everything into the stand mixer. Everyone else really loved them, I would make again, but only use 1/2 the required amount of horseradish.

This wasn't terribly bad, but we all only ate 1 as we just didn't like these much. The horseradish gave it a cocktail sauce flavor which we didn't much care for. Maybe horseradish is best left paired with mayo and roast beef, and not for eggs. Sorry, we just didn't like this one.

Great recipe.  Would reduce the mayo a touch though since I prefer the yolk filling to be a little less runny.

These were the best deviled eggs I've ever had. I used creamy horseradish instead of prepared and used a little less than called for.

Excellent!  The horseradish really adds a good kick to deviled eggs.  I use Inglehoffer creamy style horseradish and add a bit of crumbled bleu cheese and they always turn out great.

DIFFERENT & ENJOYED!! I love deviled eggs & this year found & tried several interesting ones on Allrecipes during Christmas. I am so lucky--these were definately different & tasty. Wouldn't change a thing--only added a slice of pemento stuffed olive on top for deco & the flavor flowed in beautifully. Thank you Carrie for sharing %)

Good for a switch from the usual.

Tried a few times using different types of horseradish (creamed/extra hot) and each time a different flavor was achieved. The kids even like this one!

Deviled eggs are not a favorite or so I thought. I have made this recipe as an appetizer on many occasions.  These are the first to go, and everyone wants to know if there is more. No changes to the recipe.

Very good, seemed to be missing just a little something, can't put my finger on it, but quite tasty! Careful with the horseradish though; my tablespoon was a little too full and it doesn't take much to become overpowering.  Will definitely make again!

This is my boyfriends favorite deviled egg recipe.  It is our go to deviled egg recipe for holidays and gatherings and is always a hit!  The only adjustment I make is to the mayonnaise.  I go easy on the mayo and add  until the filling has the right consistency.

I was having trouble getting the right heat from my horseradish, and commercial horseradishes can be really soggy - so I used 1/2 tsp of wasabi powder instead (in the Asian food aisle), and it was perfect! Loved these

I made these deviled eggs but omitted the dill; just personal preference.  The horseradish give the standard deviled eggs a bit of a kick.  I do like this variation to the standard deviled egg recipe.

I don't like deviled eggs, but I need several good egg recipes because we raise chickens. I took these to a holiday event, and they were quickly eaten. I actually liked them myself (the horseradish masked some of the eggy taste). I've made them a second time adding more horseradish than the recipe calls for, and my husband liked them even more.

Great recipe. Always super tasty. I tweak it a tiny bit by adding a little bit of regular mustard and a splash of apple cider vinegar and it comes out tasting a little bit more stronger and tangy. I love it! Also I substitute cayenne pepper for the paprika.

Loved them and obviously everyone else at the Christmas get together for church. They all went. I just added a bit more mayo as I ran out of filling for all my eggs. You can't go wrong with these. Thanks

It was ok.  I guess I'm just used to 'mom's' and these didn't come close.

Fantastic eggs! I made these for a food day at work and didn't even get to have one because they want so fast.

Extremely yummy. You'll eat a dozen by yourself. Don't be afraid of the horseradish and a dash of hot sauce is always nice. Going to try it with a little Old Bay next time.

These were good! When I first made them, people seemed turned off by the word horseradish.  This time, I didn't tell anyone they had horseradish in them and they were a HUGE hit!

These were just okay for me and my husband.  I guess I like the more traditional deviled egg.  I'd make these again but with some alterations--all I could taste was the horseradish.  I think they needed more salt and mustard.

These are excellent.  I found I needed a little more mayo and a tad bit of sugar because I like a little sweetness in the filling.  They are really good and everyone couldn't stop eating them.

These are fantastic!  Made them as is, and it was the perfect amount of horseradish to perk up the eggs.
