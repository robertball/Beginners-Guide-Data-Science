I really liked this, but I wanted to make it more substantial so I added some broccoli. I cooked the bacon, then removed it from the pan. Then I cooked the broccoli in the bacon fat, salt, pepper, and garlic. Then I threw in the beans and greens, turned off the heat stirred for about 2mins, added the lemon juice, and stirred again. I served the bacon on top to keep it crispy. Definitely do not skip the lemon, it adds a nice, bright flavor!

This was awesome!  I don't like Lima beans however these were delicious, with hints of smokey, tangy and salty. I am on a slow carb diet and these are a perfect addition to it.  Yum!  One note of caution, only cook the beans the 3 minutes before adding the arugula other wise they will start to mash while waiting for the arugula to wilt. The bacon I bought had 12 slices which I also cut up and put into 2 additional plastic bags for more meals.

I didn't change a thing in the recipe, however I did make it way to soon and had to reheat and because of that it wasn't as pretty, but it was still fantastic!  I will make these again and again!

So fast and delicious! I actually forgot to sprinkle the lemon juice on at the end, and it was still amazing. I'll remember next time. I added a shake of Parmesan cheese. Family loved it!

These beans are so good! I couldn't find any arugula at my grocery store so I substituted baby spinach. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Fast, easy, delicious.

As I faithfully followed the recipe, my beans disintegrated, leaving an almost hummus like paste. I don't know if my canned beans were over-cooked, (at the bean factory), or if medium heat on my cooktop is calibrated differently than Chef John's. The flavors were interesting, but not so spectacular that I'll spend time trying to figure things out. Thanks anyway, Chef John. You are still my favorite.

This was perfect for the cool autumn day. Great taste, very quick and easy to make. I will make this again, but I will use more arugula, perhaps as much as twice the recipe.

We just love this!!! Don't confine yourself to arugula- although it is delicious in this.  We've also made it with kale, spinach, and mixed greens.  Whatever greens we get from our bountiful basket.  You do need to cook the heartier greens like kale just a little longer.  Try baby butter beans- one can, well rinsed. They are more tender and moist than the larger butter beans.

This is alright, but I probably won't make it again. I recommend doubling or tripling the greens as two cups doesn't go very far.

A great, tasty, healthy, simple dish.  I followed the recipe as written. While eating it, though, I imagined how to make it even better for next time, and thought my mother's hot bacon dressing (w/ vinegar sugar, cornstarch,  water) could give it more depth.  Will try that next week. I also like the idea of red pepper flakes,  but that's for the third time...

Very good side dish. Serving sizes are a little small, even for 3 people. Double this recipe so you have plenty.

Wonderful! Still smiling from eating these beans. My wife and I proudly finished them all, made a meal of them. Used giant corona dried beans. Once the beans were cooked this was so quick and easy to make. Beans were gone in about the same time. I am already planning on making them again soon. Five shining stars for this one.

Whole family liked these. I overnight soaked and cooked a pound of dried Large Lima beans instead of using canned. They cooked up plump and big. Used about half of that in the recipe. Portions were bigger as a result. Had bag of spinach, not arugula. Generous garlic. Fresh squeezed lemon is awesome!

I have never really cared for lima beans but hubby loves them.  I decided to try them in a recipe.  This was perfect!  I really enjoyed them and plan on having them again soon!  I have some chili pepper infused olive oil that I used and it gave this just the tiniest hint of a kick.

I followed the recipe, except used kale instead of arugula, since that’s what I had. Delicious. The lemon added a nice little tang. Have made this twice now and have learned not to start making it too early with our dinners. The taste isn’t impacted but visually it looks a little sad if you cook it took long. This will definitely be added to my side dish rotation.

Was looking for something to add to a summer BBQ as a bean salad. Served this warm. The  family found the flavour a little bland so added a drizzle of Balsamic reduction to ramp it up

Definitely good as a side dish.  I added some hot sauce for zing.  Will make again, as it's extremely easy to make with no exotic ingredients.

Terrific & low calorie! I had kale so that is the green I used instead of arugula. Other reviewers said to try other greens. Also, I had to keep calories low do I used frozen Lima beans& real bacon bits but it was still so flavorful! Thanks, Chef John!
