I thought these were really good and I liked them more than I thought I would. They were very light with a subtle corn taste. They made a great breakfast!

I made it just like it said. It has a nice flavor and was good with both eggs and also jam and sour cream.

Should have trusted my gut while making this one. I knew that was too much baking powder and that you don’t mix pancake batter “until smooth,” but I did it anyway. The result was a batch of flat, bitter griddle cakes that got thrown away.

My husband really liked these "Cornmeal Griddle Cakes " which would be the primary reason I would make them again; however they really are GRIDDLE cakes. I don't have a griddle. I tried to make them in my fry pan and it was very difficult. They stuck (crusted on) to my no-stick Green Pan forcing me to switch to other no-stick pans where they stuck again. The trick to making them work seemed to be LOTS of oil and literally a smoking hot pan. So.....I recommend making this recipe on a griddle as per the recipe instructions. Thank you somocdl for sharing your recipe.
