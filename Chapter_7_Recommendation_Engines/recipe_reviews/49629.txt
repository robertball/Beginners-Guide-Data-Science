These were good, however it turned into a FIASCO!  What ever you do, do not use "Grands" as your biscuit dough.  They rose so much that the egg mixture spilled over the sides & burnt on the bottom of the oven.  I love the idea, and next time will bake them in individual remikins.  Thanks Jeanne!

LOVE THESE!  I appreciate how customizable this recipe is.  After reading other reviews, I decided to try using my own biscuits versus the refrigerated type.  I’d never done this before, but I mixed dough for one batch of biscuits using a ready-made biscuit mix.  I kneaded it together in a big lump, rolled it out, and tore off 11 palm-sized chunks-I rolled them into balls and then flattened them into the cups on my muffin pan, using a spoon to create sort of a well inside my dough cups. I decided to use sage sausage as my sausage mixture without the other veggies-and  made the rest of the recipe per the instructions.  Used a glass pyrex measuring cup to pour eggs into the muffin cups.  Turned out beautifully!  We’ve refrigerated the leftover pies and discovered that a 10 second zap in the microwave does the trick for those.  Fun, delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

These are pretty good!  I made them for my husband and I to have something quick in the morning before he heads off to work.  It's nice to be able to have something hpt and hearty tasting without the mess of cleaning up breakfast dishes first thing in the morning!  I made mine with a smaller amount of hot italian sausage (maybe 1/4 pound) to cut back on the fat and calories and I used a tube of eight "flaky layer" biscuits and used only about 3/4 of a biscuit rolled out for each one so I ended up with 12 "pies", and increased the eggs to 4.  I also omitted the onion and green peppers and added a little black pepper and onion powder to the egg mixture.  They turned out great!!  This a great recipe because you can custom make them however your family likes their eggs!  A sprinkle of tabasco sauce on top, and we've got breakfast!

I love this recipe and have made it several times now - different variations each time.  One thing I use differently is I use croissant dough instead of biscuit dough.  Depending if I use my 6 muffin or 12 muffin tin... then I will either use one croissant traingle for the 6 muffin...or cut one triangle in half for 2 of the cups in the 12 muffin tin.  I have also used egg beaters several times and those turn out great too.

I made this tonight for my MOPS group tomorrow morning and I almost thought I was going to have to pick something up from the grocery store!  I followed recipe exactly and the muffins spilled over to the bottom of my oven and my whole house filled with smoke!  My husband and I split one and I will be taking them tomorrow morning.    If I do make these again, I might try using pie crust.  It won't puff up as much and spill out all the egg.

I would like to give this recipe at least 5 stars for "Kid Friendly"  My daycare kids loved these.  I did change the recipe since kids usually don't like onions and peppers, I used bacon, ham and sausage.  Yummmmmmm!!!!!

I make these every Easter for brunch, and they are a huge hit!  Leftovers reheat nicely too.  I recommend using the larger muffin pans (the kind that you make 6 jumbo muffins in).  That way, they don't overflow and you can add in extra toppings. You will need to increase bake time though... Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Basic concept is great.  The biscuits tend to get tough when rolled out again - but my 15-month-old loved gumming them.  I used leftover ham from Christmas dinner with green onion and spinach as a filling (ANYTHING to get her to eat some vegetables).  She LOVED it.  I had two for dinner and I froze the rest for her.  I would suggest either making the biscuit dough from scratch to keep the texture soft or using pie crust instead.

Thanks Jeanne, these came out very nice. Helps to let the biscuits sit out a couple minutes so they're easier to work with.

I made my own turkey breakfast sausage for this recipe. I also increase the amounts of the onion and bell pepper plus I added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic. This was a fun recipe to make--quicker than I thought it would be, though I think for us, it was more suited for kids than adults. The different combinations you could make as "fillings" would be fun to experiment with.

Made this many times, guests love it.  I make spicy sausage and vegetarian, both wonderful.  I found that a mixing cup with spout works best for getting the egg into the shell.  I hope to make a lower-fat version since we can never stop with just one!  You can modify it to your heart's delight, reheats well in microwave.

I simply cannot understand the bad reviews on this recipe. Talk about a fool-proof, easily customizable recipe! I must confess that I didnt follow the recipe exactly, but I feel that this recipe is begging to be customized to a persons tastes. Any kind of cheese, bacon, ham, or sausage, add hashbrowns, veggies, you name it! I bought cheapo brand "giant flaky biscuits" and peeled them in half (for regular sized muffin tin, not texas sized or mini sized.) I let them come to room temp and then I gingerly pulled and stretched them into a big circle. Dont pull a whole biscuit out of the fridge and poke it into the muffin tin! Maybe this is where some folks had a problem. I sprayed the muffin tins with nonstick spray and laid a half-biscuit into the bottom of each tin, coming up the sides. I used Egg Beaters and the recipe for Mom's Turkey Sausage Patties found on this website. I did slightly cook the Egg Beaters just enough to start to thicken it and then mixed the turkey in with it. I spooned this into each biscuit, and topped off (dont overfill!) with more egg beaters, sprinkled with cheese, and popped them into the oven. I have made this twice and have not a problem with sticking or expanding/blowing up yet. Freeze these and then on rushed mornings just pop one into the microwave to reheat on your way out the door!

I have made these several times. I also make a version of these using frozen hashbrowns. I place the hashbrowns in the muffin cup, press a little to get them to go up the sides, then bake for 7-10 minutes before adding the filling. I also mix the eggs, cheese and other favorite ingredients in a large measuring cup with a spout to assist in filling the cups. Both ways - hashbrowns or biscuits work great.

When I have made other recipes calling for premade biscuit dough, including those that morph into dumplings, I avoid the flaky layer type and use the cheap plain biscuits.  In my store they come in a shrink wrapped package of 4 cans in blue packaging.  Definitely the lowest cost ones in the case.  You won't have this problem with these.

I originally had the same problem as others with the overflowing cups.  Also, I could never get the dough to "lay" quite right in the muffin cup - it kept shrinking up.  After many variations on this recipe, now I just tear up the dough and place it in the cups - I can usually get 12 muffins or more out of this too.  I use the refrigerated "wheat" dough and often sub ham and swiss.  Overall, this recipe was a great start to a now weekly request in my house!

These were absolutlely DELICIOUS!!!!  I read a lot of the reviews before I made them and I did use the crescent rolls in place of the biscuits...my family does not care for biscuits that much.  And for the kids sake I omitted the onions and bell peppers, but I did use onion powder in the egg and milk mixture.  I used Jimmy Deans maple sausage.  I also used a turkey baster to distribute the egg mixture into the biscuit.  I used cupcake paper to line the muffin pan, as well as put a cookie sheet under the muffin pan to cath any spills.  I tried not to fill the cups up too much to prevent spills, however one did spill a little and missed the cookie sheet and got on the bottom of the stove.  It wasn't much though, but the little that did spill smelled awful, so I can only imagine if they all would have spilled out.  All in all, this was very good and easy to make.  I made 8, we ate a couple last night, and froze and reheated them this morning for about 35-40 seconds and they tasted even better this morning.  I simply stuck them in a ziploc freezer bag and they were perfect.  These will work wonderfully to have on hand at the office for a quick breakfast.  I will definitely be making more of these in different varieties to have on hand for a quick morning breakfast.  This is so much better than buying those frozen breakfast things which I hate...they taste too processed for me...and not to mention, making these homemade are much CHEAPER!

I made a "lite & easy" version, was SO easy and a big hit at the office.  I simply precooked one chub of turkey breakfast sausage and soft scrambled one 15oz container of Southwestern Eggbeaters. I precooked the biscuit dough for about 4 min, then put a tsp+ of the sausage, then egg, then fine shred colbyjack and a little paprika.  Cooked for 15 min. Really good and no chopping!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty.  I am on a diet, so made these with turkey breakfast sausage and reduced fat biscuits.  I freeze them, then pop them in the microwave for a minute and 15 seconds.  I have a ready-made, hot breakfast that "costs" about 240 calories.  Will definitely keep these on hand in the freezer all the time.  :-)

This is a great recipe! I have been making these things for years now. I am not sure why people are having so much trouble with the biscuits?? You just stuff them full of the filling and try to pull the dough over the top so it closes up. I sprinkle mine with a cheese after I close them up. You can make these little guys with taco seasoned ground beef and onions for a Mexican style treat. They freeze really well too. Good Luck people. Hope you can figure it out.

Loved this recipe... easy & delicious! I did use my own biscuit recipe instead of the canned biscuits (we don't like the canned) and added a few shakes of Red Hot Sauce and garlic pepper to the egg mixture... and they were fabulous. Very similar to the breakfast quiche on South Beach but sooo much better :)

Made these this morning and my family loved it. It was a fun departure from other things we do for Sunday brunches. This recipe is so very versatile that vegetarian friends can enjoy their pies prepared at the same time as the meat eaters. A word of caution: use only half of the preportioned biscuit and have tinfoil ready below for the inevitable overflow. Definitely making this again!

These little gems should be re-named Lifesavers! DD's oven died a slow and painful death and new stove delivered in 2 weeks.  She asked if I could whip up something for her and kiddos to heat and eat on the run. I laughed all the way to my recipe box for this breakfast treat.  Fantastic to pull out of the freezer and nuke.  Easy to make and with ingredients generally on hand.  My DH will often grab 1 or 2 to take to work for AM coffee break and I've had one for lunch with a glass of juice. Versatile, to say the least.  BIG thank you!!

Mini quiches!!  These are very versatile.  instead of biscuits, I use refrigerated pie crust. roll it out, cut circles with a glass and proceed from there.  When my kids were young, they could fill with whatever they liked and everyone was happy!  I love it with sage or apple sausage, chives and cheddar-Yum!

I have made these for years and is a favorite with my youngest son especially.  The only difference in my recipe is that I use brown and serve link sausage.  I cut them in 4ths and put 3-4 in each cup and then pour the eggs over and the grated cheese.  The cheap, 10 to a package biscuits worked the best for me after also trying others.

These are delicious! My kids love them as a quick breakfast on their way out the door! I use the paper cupcake liners, as these pies tend to stick to the pan, even when I grease it.

I, too, tried this using crescent rolls.  They worked great.  I lightly scrambled my eggs before I mixed the sausage, pepper and onion in with them.  I then topped it with the cheese.  They store great in the fridge and heat up in no time...if there's any left that is.

Delicious! I recommend using a 13x9 baking dish and spreading the dough out. Not portable, but much easier to prepare!

These are a terrific alternative to standing at the stove making eggs for everyone.  I made mine with plain old refrigerator biscuits, flattened with rolling pin and fit into my square muffin tins - used some onion powder and some dried red pepper flakes (sweet) instead of actual green pepper and onion to tone down the pepper taste.  the sausage gave it a nice zip and mine didn't boil over as some people's did.  I gave them 25 min @ 400 as the muffins are a bit bigger being square.  Will definitely do this for my dad who lives alone and use egg substitute next time.   thanks for a great recipe and thanks to the reviewers for all the ideas you add!

Okay - updating this review - made a subsequent batch with egg substitute, turkey sausage and they tasted exactly the same - he will never know the difference!

This was a really good recipe for breakfast!! I used one can of Texas bisquits and a regular sized cupcake pan (12 cupcakes) I used about 5 eggs. I'm a vegetarian so I made half of the pies with just cheese/egg/onion/green pepper and the other half I added in precooked ham from this weeks dinner. When making the crust I used about 3/4 of each individual biscuit dough inside the can. I pressed it out in each cup, letting the sides go about halfway up the cup so that it wouldn't overexpand on me in the oven. I sprinkled in onion/ppr, used a 1/4 c measuring cup to pour egg into each pie and then sprinkled with shredded cheese. I put the oven a little less than 400 degrees and checked on the food every so often. I did have a little runover from the pies with ham in them, but i found that if I waited for the egg to harden up a  bit, I could push it with a spantula back towards the pie. I had forgotten to spray the pan but it ended up not mattering because the pies just popped out of the tray. I swear my kitchen smelled like McDonalds but without the heart attack factor. Next time I will limit the amount of dough on the bottom of the pie because once cooked it took over about 3/4 of the pie.

I modified this by adding minced mushrooms & bell pepper, & used crescent rolls molded into the muffin pan instead of biscuits & ham instead of Sausage.  Very Good! Next time i would try to make the inside a little "creamier" maybe by adding a litle heavy ceam &/Or Cream cheese

I have made this recipe so many ways ~ another good way that the kids love for a quick lunch is filling the biscuit cups with a sloppy joe mixture with a little shredded cheese on top ~ they are great !

These were a hit with my kids for breakfast before school this morning.  I did omit the green onions and peppers since my kids are not fans, but that's one of the great things about this recipe - it's easily customized to fit different tastes.  Will be making these again using bacon instead of the sausage, possible adding in some mushrooms, or even making a southwest version with green chiles.  Thanks for such a versatile, delicious recipe!

Maybe I bought the wrong brand of biscuits (regular el-cheapo ones).  Had a heck of a time lining muffin pans.  The biscuits kept "contracting" after rolled out.  I got them to roll out to about 4" but they immediately pulled together to about 3", not enough to line the individual cups.  Other than that, quick and easy, tasty, and just a little mess due to biscuit problem.  Will try again with different brand or even homemade biscuits. Fun idea and I know I can work it out.  Thanks

Not bad, but I think the recipe would be better if you mixed the filling ingredients together first and added extra cheese. It is a nice idea. I will keep experimenting with it. Thanks!

Yummy!  Fun and different too.  I made mine with sauteed tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and onion and I used bacon instead of sausage.  They were delish, and my hubby loved them too!

I made several batches of these for a potluck brunch and they turned out great!  I did use croissant dough instead of biscuit dough (so it wouldn't puff as much and make a mess like some other people who reviewed described).   I used 1/2 a croissant worth of dough for each pie, and made sure I didn't use too much egg in each (I filled each muffin cup about 2/3 of the way with the sausage mixture and egg) and they did not make a mess.  I am freezing some for later as well so hopefully they will freeze well!

I read a lot of the reviews & agree, this is a recipes you & make your own.  I used ramekin's sprayed litely with Pam & then spread out the biscuit dough.  I put a little shredded cheese on the bottom.  I used medium Italian sausage & chopped bacon.  Instead of green peppers (can not eat) I used red, orange & yellow & also chopped finley 2 mushrooms.  Sauteed  them all with my onions & seasoning (missing from original recipe). I mixed my eggs & milk with some finley chopped chives & fresh ground pepper in a measuring cup with a hand elmusifier/blender (much easier to pour). Topped with shreeded old yellow cheddar & Gruyere cheese.  Baked for 20 minutes.  They came out great with lots of flavor. Next time I will try adding some tomato just before the egg mixture.  I look forward to reading other reviews.  Any other suggestions out there....

Pillsbury makes pre rolled out dough in a sheet (not perforated, same dough but much easier to work with) so I just used a drinking glass to cut the dough into circles that fit my muffin tin. This makes the dough dilemma MUCH easier! I am making this for my family on Thanksgiving morning to tide us over before the big dinner! Hope this helps.

I found that if I use a plastic drinking cup (16 oz best) that has a rolled edge is the best for pouring liquids without drips or spills.

This is the best breakfast idea I have ever eaten! :) I scored infinite points with my husband who literally ate all but two of the breakfast pies I made. I used "Grands" Crescent Rounds as my dough and although the egg mixture spilled over into other pies while cooking, it was an easy fix to get a knife and cut around the muffin cup and seperate it from the spilled egg on the pan. I also used a teaspoon of onion powder as a substitute and it mixed excellently with the egg mixture. I think we've found our new family favorite!

What a great recipe - I was worried about the biscuits puffing up so I put them between wax paper and rolled with rolling pin to flatten. I let them rest and rolled them again. Placed in muffin tins and filled 3/4 full and baked. They were delish!!! Such a great idea - brought a couple to work and popped in the microwave. Thanks for sharing your recipe ;)

Wow, are these yummy!  Fun to make, too.  I omitted green pepper and added a dash of fresh ground black pepper.  Mixed the cheese in with the eggs to save a step.  Trick is to use the cheapest store brand biscuits so filling doesn't run over when baking.  Perfect for a brunch buffet or a nutritious breakfast with some fresh fruit.  A definite keeper.

I probably should of read the reviews before I made this.  Mine also over flowed onto my oven bottom.  I realized this and quickly grabbed cookie sheets to put underneath the muffin tins but was too late.  I used ham and cheddar cheese and they tasted good.  Would like to play around with this recipe and probably won't use the Grands Biscuits for this again - they fluff up way too much!

I used Grands buttermilk biscuits but split them in 2 and used half per muffin tin.  It worked great.  I made 12 muffins with the egg mixture as written.  I think it will be good next time to add some salsa to the sausage.  Very good and will make again.

Love these!  I've made them for two weeks in a row...my husband and I love being able to pop them in the microwave in the mornings.  This week I changed them up.  I used jumbo muffin pans.  Bought the buttery flaky biscuits, split them in two halves (since they have layers, it's easy), stretched the pieces out and used one piece on each side of the muffin cup.  Keeps it from sliding down the sides.  I use egg whites.. I added a little milk to the whites, some salt and pepper and then slightly beat.  I used the minced onion and green pepper as written, used a low fat sausage (you won't notice it's lowfat, it is still sausage after all! :).  I cooked 5 pieces of center cut bacon in the microwave until crispy.  Added sausage mix to breaded cups, crumbled bacon over, filled with egg mixture, sprinkled a little cheddar on top.  Cooked at 375 for 25 mins, after 5 mins, I slid them out on a wire rack to cool before putting in a Ziplock bag to go in the freezer.  So great because you could make so many ways...bacon tomatoe, sante fe with jalepenos, etc.....LOVE this recipe, thank you for the great idea!

These came out great, I changed it up a bit as I made mine vegetarian adding mushrooms, spinach and red pepper. I also mixed some cheese into the egg mixture in addition  to toppping the mixture with eggs, came out delicious and this makes for a quick easy portable breakfast treat. I made these the night before but stopped short of adding the egg mixture and finished that the next morning, came out great!

These are great!  The only thing I modified was the measurements.  I used a whole pound of sausage just because that is what I had.  I also used grands biscuits; again, because that is what I had.  I only used half of each biscuit due to the size and I am so glad I did.  MAKE SURE you place a pan under your muffin pan because these can and will spill over and it will SMELL terrible.  Due to the extra sausage, I added one more egg and one more tablespoon of milk because I wanted to use all my sausage up.  The best thing about this recipe is you can make it ahead of time and refrigerate it.  The next morning, stick in the mircrowave for a 15-30 seconds.  Grab it and run out the door.  You have a hot, good breakfast while driving down the road!  Great start for the day for kids too!

What I love about this recipe is the ease for weekday mornings-I can heat up a ready made biscuit from the weekend and breakfast is ready.  My 1 year old really liked these but my husband and 3 year old did not.  I like the idea but I intend to try some healthy alternatives next time and maybe the rest of the family will like them better.  I will make a from scratch whole wheat dough and add some sauteed veggies treating this more like miniature quiches.  The idea is great and, with some tweaking, I think this could become a staple in our home.

Save even more time by using Jimmy Dean's Skillets in Sausage or Bacon—each has pre-chopped onions, peppers, and potatoes. I used a large non-stick muffin mold and flattened out standard size biscuit dough, half a bag of Skillet Sensations (I heated it up on the stove top for five minutes or so), Egg Beaters, a little milk, salt and pepper, topped with cheese, and then I baked them for 20 minutes. Perfection.

These are so easy to make and are a very hearty breakfast.  I make them the night before (not a morning person) and nuke them in the microwave for about 10 seconds in the AM.  Don't leave them out, like I did, or your dog will snatch them off the counter!  They get 5 stars from her, too.  Be sure to grease the muffin pan well, or you'll be scrubbing for a while to get it clean.

This is such a useful recipe.  Made it the first time as is and was great. It's easy to change ingredients in the filling for variety.  I make these on the weekend, and they're easy to reheat in the oven during the week for a quick hot breakfast.  I have used used mushrooms, dried tomato, ham, gouda, cheddar, and feta different times with success.

I give 5 stars for it's versatility!!!....  I made spaghetti squash pies!!  Really!... moist, touch of sweetness, lots of flavor... I sprayed bottoms only of muffin pan, then smooched refrigerated BREADSTICK dough around the sides and slightly in bottom and around rim.  My filling: 1 link Italian sausage & 1/2 a small onion (precooked), added to 3 eggs, 2 T chopped fresh basil, 1/3 C grated Cheddar, 3/4 C precooked spaghetti squash. Made 12 pies... baked 25 mins at 375 degrees.

I made it with Pilsbury Croissants, AMAZING!! Also I read that it would overflow, so to save myself from a huuuge oven clean up, I just put a cookie sheet underneath the cupcake pan :)

This is a great recipe!! I lightened it up a bit by using reduced fat biscuits and 4 egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs. Also, I couldn't find 12oz cans of biscuits-all I could find were 16oz cans. So i used a whole pound of pork sausage to make up the difference. I bought Jimmy Dean country style pork sausage. As a side note, I did use a jumbo muffin pan. These are great and am excited to take one to work in the morning. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I don't like the biscuit base, it puffs up to much, next time I think i'll try a different bread, maybe crescent rolls. A great idea to build off of for a quick and easy breakfast.

Such a great idea. I used reg size flaky biscuits in a jumbo muffin pan and used leftover this and that from the fridge.  Some potato, link breakfast sausage, spinach and jack cheese. Some sauteed portabella, onion, broccoli and red pepper bits with jack. I ended up using 4 eggs for 6 pies with no overflow in the jumbo pan.

These are great, but it is wise to cut down on the biscuits and filling in each cup. Mine overflowed all over my oven! Next time I make these, I will either make them in larger cups or use much less biscuit filling than is called for.

Just OK.  Made them with onion, green pepper and tomatoes, alsong with the cheese, eggs and milk.  I used the medium size Grands, and just flattened and stretches them with my hands.  They were a little overdone even at the shortest recommended cooking time.  The biscuits seemed a little dry to me.

WOW!!! Had these for breakfast Christmas morning and the kids & hubby absolutely loved them. I was able to put mushrooms in dad's and tomatoes in mine, loved the individuality!! I'm going to try using oven soup bowls next time because the egg ran over the muffin pans. Also, make sausage gravy to pour over these--excellent recipe  THANK YOU!!

I made these for my husband's pot luck at work and he said they were devoured intsantly! I was asked for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use diced bacon instead of sausage and I added a little salt to the beaten eggs. Be sure to put a piece of foil under the muffin tin to catch any egg that drips out as it puffs.

I was surprised I didn't love these.  I gave it 3 stars because I liked the idea of this recipe and the filling was tasty.  Once they were all done the biscuit was dense and tasteless at the bottom.  It was a lot of work for the results.  I would have been better off making the filling and then using it in a omlet.  I made these exactly as written with the addition of crubled bacon. Maybe a sweeter dough or a puff pastry would have been better but I won't try again.

I made these Tuesday evening (11/15) for breakfast club (11/16) at my job & everyone LOVED THEM!!! They re-heat great with no problem. Rather than placing them directly in the muffin tin I used foil cupcake liners (found at any local grocer). They were a lifesaver for preventing any spills or overflow while baking. I also took others advice & stayed away from Grands biscuits & used regular butter flake biscuits. I made one slight change after following the receipe & finding the first batch to be a little dryer than I prefer. In a seperate skillet, I made a small batch of white gravy to place at the bottom of my biscuit cups before adding the filling. To die for does not begin to explain just how great they were. I will be making these again for sure & experiment with different variations.

These are the best.  They are fairly easy to make and heat up very well.  Do make sure you use the regualr small biscuits and try not to fill the muffin cups too full with the egg mixture.  This is my husband's most favorite thing!

I use flaky biscuits because you can separate the dough easily and use only 1/2 a biscuit for each little pie. Works great. I use a little shrimp in each one and use it as an appetiser sometimes. :)

As I made these as a Valentine's Day gift for my bf, I decided to steal another reviewer's name for them: Man Muffins.  I've eaten 2 of the dozen I just prepared. They are so delicious.  Here are my modifications:  refrigerated croissant dough, instead of biscuit dough, 5 eggs with finely chopped fresh mushroom, made 1 dozen Man Muffins.  My egg mixture didn't overflow while cooking.  My only change for next batch is to use more cooking spray to coat the muffin tins--I had some sticking.  Thanks for a fun, new recipe!

Pretty, pretty good!  I made them for a brunch and people loved them, and some asked for the recipe.  I would use more meats/veggies than recipe calls for and more cheese.  Lots of flexibility with this one!!!!

Awesome recipe! I needed a grab n go breakfast, and this works! I didn't have any biscuit dough but I did have refrigerated croissant dough, and it turned out perfect, it didn't overflow or make a mess. I used half of each croissant triangle and patted it down into the muffin tin, used breakfast sausage, onion, red/yellows peppers and cheddar cheese...it could have used a pit more salt...but other than that it was yummy!!

I love, love, love this recipe.  I used the grands biscuits and pulled the layers apart to make them as thin as possible, loaded it up with sausage, used less egg per muffin and then loaded the cheese on top.  The turkey baster someone else suggested works perfect for the eggs!

My family loved these!!  There are so many variations, from ham, sausage to bacon.  They were even better the next day!  I am sure I will be making these again.   But a word to the wise mine over flowed & I had egg all over, but I put a baking sheet underneath which saved me cleaning the oven! Thanks!!!!

Loved these!  Unfortunately I read the reviews AFTER I put them in the oven, only to find out that if you use Grands biscuits they will puff up and spill the egg out of the cup and all over the bottom of your stove.  Regardless, they were delicious and I made them exact to the recipe.  For sure will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  I read that other reviews mentioned it was too dry.  I used half a bell pepper and half an onion rather than 1/8 cup each.  I felt that this added some moisture to the biscuit.  I used grands jr flaky biscuits and they turned out great.  I made sure I sprayed Pam on the muffin pans and flattened out the biscuits and left them on a plate until i was absolutely ready to put them in the pan.  Right before I placed them in the muffin pan, I flattened them and spread them out some more because they DO tend to shrink back into a smaller size.  My husband LOVED them. I made them last night and tonight again as well.  They reheat wonderfully, and I serve them with a side of country gravy to dip them in.  (the dry mix packaged kind at the store)  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

Great and so easy. I did slightly cook the biscuit dough before filling the cups.  I had no problems with overflow. The only change I made was that I layered the cheese and sausage mixture on top of the biscuit prior to adding the egg mixture. After adding the egg mixture, with a fork I lightly incorporated the mixture with the sausage and cheese. My kids (and adults) loved them.

I made this for my picky 5 year old (who refuses breakfast foods!)...and she loved it!  We put a little bit of ketchup on top and it was delicious!  It is great when I pick up something on the run on a weekday morning and  not feel like I have to pick up something to eat when I get to work!  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe.

This was a great recipe and fed four of us!  I did chose to add salt, pepper and parsley flakes to the egg mixture, to add more flavor.  I opted to make Sausage Gravy with it as well has browns with onions and bell pepper in it.  I used Red Bell Pepper instead of Green for the sweetness for breakfast.  The husband LOVED it and said it's a keeper!  The kids asked if we can still keep my Biscuits and Gravy the way we had it.  They said it was good, but preferred mom's old stand-by.  Though they did eat it all!  I also added more cheese, onion, and bell pepper then the recipe called for.  All in all, I will be making this again, though probably tweeking it to the family's likes a little better.

Loved the idea, just didn't turn out as expected. Was looking for a quick way to give the kids a quick dose of protein in the morning. This is not it. Way too much bread, which was dry, and not enough egg. I, then tried to use less biscuit, but the dough didn't flatten enough to cover the bottom and sides of he muffin tin. 3 eggs to fill 10 muffin cups, no. Will not make again.

I don't recommend this recipe.  The dough rose wayyy too high and pushed the egg and filling all over the oven.  What a mess!  They did taste good, but it was totally not worth all the work and cleanup I had to do.

We used bacon instead of sausage and Southwestern Eggbeaters instead of eggs and milk.  They were great but needed more cheese.  I think the next time I'll mix some shredded cheese with the meat before I pour the eggs in...  Either way, they were great!

One of my favorites, sometimes I will use crescent roll dough because it is easier to get in the cups, but biscuit dough is better.

Good and Easy. I made them for an office meeting and they were a hit. 

Didn't use peppers - added some tomatoes for color. Used store brand biscuits and flattened them out in the muffin cups. 

Don't overfill the cups and you'll have no problem. They definitely need salt and pepper.

These are great. I did as others suggested and used my own biscuit dough. I made 12 pies rather than 10. They puffed up beautifully and did not overflow. Watch the cooking time though.

These were very good, easy, and something different for breakfast. Next time I will try to make them in bite-sized muffin tins to make them group friendly (i.e. for Christmas brunch), but I'll have to adjust my cooking time. Also, may try to make it even easier and use chopped, cooked ham instead. I would definitely recommend these!

I am not much of a meat eater, but found this recipe to be quite versatile... I fried veggie-bacon instead of sausage, red pepper instead of green (much prettier) and added a bit of broccoli (cut fairly small). Also I seasoned that mixture with black pepper and oregano before spooning into the "biscuits". Instead of buying biscuit dough, I used the 'Spelt Biscuit' recipe (from this site)... worked very well.

Wow - I just made these and 5 minutes later they are gone. My boys are picky breakfast eaters. This finally gives me a way to use biscuits in a recipe. I used a turkey baster as one suggested and it worked great. I will definitely make this again - probably tomorrow.

It was a little difficult getting the biscuit spread up the sides of the muffin tin.  I thought the biscuit was a little dry for this but everyone else enjoyed it.

This recipe is wonderful, I have made twice now and found the meat content too much for my taste but to each their own. I mixed all ingredients in my blender and this worked great when pouring into each little "pie".  I used baking cups lined with  pie dough, and yes sprayed my muffin pan with Pam.  My family devoured!  Thanks for the recipe, this will be in the favourites rotation!

I give this recipe 5 stars for the concept but modified for my use. After greasing a large cupcake tray I thought the portions where to small. I used pie crust as others suggested but increased ingredients a little to fit in 5 four inch Ramkins. I rolled the crust out to make it a little thinner and also added thee chopped Belgian yellow peppers for a little "bite". I baked for 25 minutes at 385º but the bottoms where a little soft. Next time I will pre-bake the crust as I do with quiche. Thank you CRANEJWR for a great idea

I ws not as happy as others but think it was personal taste. I would try them again and change the filling.
On a positive note I made them the night before and they heat up well!!

These were pretty good.  I used Bisquick and made my own biscuits.  There are so many variations that can be made from this.  I think I will try ham next time.

These were amazing.  I agree with a previous person who called them Man Muffins.  Made these for the first time Easter, and have made them several times since.  I have tried different toppings.  I purchase the Jimmy Deans sausage crumbles, or precooked pre cubed ham.  I've tried making them with biscuts and cresants.  They turn out great no matter how they are made.  Will make again and again.

These take a little time, but it's completely worth it. I froze most of them individually for later. The flavor was very good after re-heating, and it sure beat other bland breakfast choices (i.e. cereal, bagel, etc.) I will make these many more times!!!

I was looking for a simple egg breakfast  that I could make-ahead and freeze for a quick hot meal.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  I made the recipe as written and they came out fantastic.  I  individually wrapped  for the freezer and my husband just microwaves them until hot.  He loves them - I love them as I don't have to make them at 5:30 AM for him!    This recipe would work for whatever meats/toppings your family likes.  Thanks Cranejwr for a great recipe.  I'm going to make up a few more batches.

These were good and easy to make.  I used bisquick to make the dough and pressed into each muffin tin.  It only takes half of the sausage that it calls for.  So I made 20 to use it up.  I am not a pepper fan so I omitted that.  I used egg white 'beaters' and turkey sausage for a healthier version.  I put some spinach (make sure you press all of the water out) and sauteed some green onions in just a bit of butter and added these to the sausage.  Poured the egg whites ontop and then topped each with a good pinch of cheddar cheese.  It only took about 10 minutes to bake before they were done.  Next time I will definitely use a large muffin pan and make 10-12.  There was too much biscuit and not enough filling.  I froze the rest for a quick breakfast on weekday mornings.  Great idea!

Decided to use pastry shells, 8 to a box, instead of biscuits!  
Refrigerated the leftover pies in a plastic bag and, a 10 second zap in the microwave or cover with foil, and put into a 220 % toaster oven, till heated through.
  I might have cooked the sausage too long as it was kind of dry and hard. I might try this with bacon, or leftover ham......I froze some, to test and they do freeze well.

My husband liked these a lot.  I thought they were okay (but I didn't expect to LOVE them so I'm happy) and my kids (picky eaters) didn't like them at all.  A friend's kids were over for a playdate.  The younger child LOVED them and the older wouldn't eat more than one bite.  My only constructive feedback is that I had SO much sausage that I couldn't possibly stuff any more in the cups.  Also, I think even though I used large muffin tins, it would be better if I used a Texas size or jumbo size next time.

Good! I'd prefer to make it w/o potatoes in the mix, but good w/ sausage, cheese and eggs.  Might add a little more seasoning.  Wonder how it would be w/ cressant rolls....hmmm...

Made these for a brunch and they were the first item to go.  They're easy, tasty, and great for a large get-together because you can pick them up and enjoy.  I haven't tried making them ahead of time because they were very quick to put together.  Great recipe!

These are so easy and tasty! I used my large muffin pans and Grands biscuits so everything fit nicely. I did have to use 3 more eggs to fill them though and cook a little longer. I also used ham instead of sausage because that was what I had. I think next time my only change would be to mix the cheese in with the eggs.

Made with homemade biscuits - my recipe for 6 biscuits was more than enough dough to cover 12 muffin tins.  4 eggs for 12 pies.  More biscuit than filling, which is not really what we wanted.  Nice make-ahead recipe, tho. Did not use 1/8 cup minced onion or bell pepper, but used unsalted Greek seasoning instead with good results (1/8 cup - could not see how that would go into 10 -12 muffin tins).  Did not use cheese, as DH does not care for it.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these exactly as written and they turned out perfect.  For those who had problems with spillover, make sure you flatten the biscuits enough so the edges come up over the muffin tin just a little, and don't fill them all the way to the top with egg.  The egg puffs up, but doesn't spill over.  My only mistake was I should have made two batches!  The kids and my husband loved them.  I will be making more this weekend to take to work through the week for my mid morning break, they are even great heated up. I also think they would be great with a variety of ingredients.  What a wonderful idea!

I love that this recipe can be adjusted in a variety of ways to suit everyone's tastes.  Here are some variations that my family enjoys:  Pizza - mix the egg mixture with diced pepperoni and mozza cheese.  Put a teaspoon of pizza sauce in the bottom of the muffin tin (on biscuit base) and pour egg mixture on, and top with mozza cheese.  Bake as usual.  Other variations include bacon, cheddar and red onion; smoked ham and swiss; potato and leeks; chicken, spinach and feta.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found the bottoms browned more than I would like, next time I will bake at 375 for 16 minutes instead of 400 for 18. I substituted bacon pieces for the sausage and they were really tasty.  I used jumbo muffin cups and no spillover, they really puff up!

We liked these tasty little treats. Cut recipe to make six for my muffin pan. Was careful not to overfill the muffins and they cooked up really nice. Very tasty. I added some chopped red bell pepper I had on hand.

Great starting point.  I modified my fillings a bit (added thawed and drained frozen spinach), but the real essential change needed is use pre-made pie crust instead of biscuits.  I tried biscuits the first time and they were almost impossible to flatten and mold to the muffin cups and they ended up a little tough.  Using a tube of pre-made pie dough, I rolled it out and used a mug to cut into circles (I used jumbo muffin cups so had to use a big mug) which lined the muffin cups really well.

Made breakfast for dinner tonight and decided to make these as well.  All I had in the fridge was the home style grands.  This can only had 8 biscuits. I used only 4 of them and cut them in half (some were successful into thirds).  I sautéed the onions and peppers using some bacon drippings.  Also used bacon instead of sausage ( again used what I had on hand.)  I used 3 eggs, though I think next time I will use 4.  The 4 grands filled 12 muffin holes.  My boys (4 & 10) ate them.  They liked the portable breakfast.  I froze the rest, gonna try it out tmrw morn to see how well it reheats/tastes.  
Bottom line, if u use grands, cut it in half or thirds, so they won't rise up too much.

These were great !

EDIT:  Tried these today and nuked them for about 30 sec from frzn.  Great easy brkfst!  The crusts become softer if you microwave them.  I also reheated one in the toaster oven, and that one became crunchier.

This turned out to be awesome!  I added one more egg thinking the cups didn't look very full, but that was a mistake.  As the biscuit rises, the cups over filled.  Use just what they have listed!

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved them. Be careful not to overfill the muffin cups or you'll have a mess on your hands. They even taste good reheated. I will be making these again.

Used Grands Jr. They did ok, but still had a little spillage. I would try Bisquik next time. Forgot the cheese. Would be better with it, but just fine without. There is a lot of potential for different rollings. I will definitely try this again. :)

The easiest, most versatile recipe I have found on here so far!  Almost most every recipe I tried on this site has been good but could use improvement for taste one way or the other.  This recipe is a must try.  Whatever you can think of to put with eggs you can add.  My three year old did most of the work and had a blast!! Thank you! Thank you!

This looks delicious, and I will save it. Note to editors: in the directions, it needs to be "...distribute...among the cups" not "between the cups" since the mixture is being put into several muffin cups, not just two.

I'm determined to perfect this recipe to our personal taste but I absolutely love the idea.  I've tried the biscuits, and the crescent rolls in place of the biscuits and the kids seemed to love them both.  I'm looking forward to the day when i can make enough to throw in the freezer since they disappear before I get a chance.

These were so easy and tasty!!  I used bacon instead of sausage, but can't wait to try this with different variations! I had no problems with the filling spilling over, but I used a baking pan with the square cups.

So good and very easy to make.  I sauteed chopped white button mushrooms in butter instead of using sausage and then added the onions and bell peppers to in after the mushrooms were almost fully cooked. This is perfect for making ahead of time then just re-heating for a quick breakfast during the week.

Wow!  So yummy!  I don't get the bad reviews AT ALL!  Please note that if you buy the size can of biscuits she calls for (12 oz), they will be the right size.  I did spray the muffin cups before putting the biscuit dough in.  I used about a tablespoon of egg mixture in each of the pies.  They did not spill over and turned out perfect.

I love this idea - cook once and reheat as needed - but I'm afraid I'll need to try again.  I overcooked em (eggs were a bit rubbery and biscuits stuck to the pan). Loads of potential if I can find the right bake time for my oven.

I didn't use the refrigerated biscuit dough...based on the high sodium content. I made my own biscuit dough and rolled it out to make each pie.  This was a bit more time consuming than I expected.  But the result was good.  I like the idea of using a bulb baster to fill the cups with the egg mixture, much neater!

I had extra's so I froze them, then reheated and they were better the second time around.  They are pretty "biscuitty" on the bottom so next time I will use 1/2 biscuit in each (personal taste).  Very easy and I love that I can have them on hand.  Good recipe to use up ingredients you have on hand.

These were easy and great to make. I did use the flaky dough and split them into 3/4 as suggested because the whole biscuit was to big when it cooked. Over great and easy for the next morning to heat and eat!

These are good, especially with a little ketchup on top. I cut the biscuit dough in half to avoid the overflow problem other reviews had. I had to more than double the amount of eggs and milk written in the recipe. I doubt this is due to making more pies, since my pies are smaller. Most likely the original recipe does underestimates how much of the milk and egg mixture you'll really need.

These are great as-is, however, I LOVE their versatility!

UPDATE: My husband ADORES these! I always use puff pastry though, not biscuit dough, and I fill them about halfway full, and they've never overflowed on me. I add mushrooms and garlic powder, 2-3 more eggs than called for, sage sausage and a generous sprinkling of cheese. YUM!

This was a great idea! I made these for a breakfast pot luck and they were a BIG hit. I used pillsbury biscuits and used a frozen breakfast bag heated the contents and then added the mixture on top of the biscuit topped with egg and cheese. This was super easy and most importantly very tasty.

These were great, but next time I'll have to make a few adjustments.  I only used half a biscuit because that's what others suggested.  However, it was still too doughy tasting.  Next time, I will use even less biscuit, about 4-5 more eggs (it wasn't enough) and I'll keep using the Bob Evans spicy sausage.  Thanks for the recipe, my hubs ate them up for 3 days.

These have changed my life!  I make a batch of 18 (jumbos) every Sunday for a weeks worth of family breakfasts.  I used reduced fat Grands muffins (halved), 11 eggs, 11 T of milk, a pound of sausage, half an onion and half a green pepper.  I then sprinkle cheese on top of each muffin.  I tried freezing them, and they do heat up well afterwards.  I tried mixing the sausage mixture directly into the egg mixture, but it tastes better putting the sausage directly on the muffin dough.

I love this recipe!  It has become a def favorite!  So versatile!  I changed it up a little bit only because I don't like green peppers and used what I had on hand!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!  Oh, the only thing that I really did differently was use sharp cheddar and added some canadian bacon in place of the green peppers!  Thanks again for such an awesome recipe!

Delicious! I use Grand biscuits, but split them in half (length wise) and even thirds (length wise). Thanks for the review/recomendation. Great recipe! Will make again.

I made this again, but with crescent roll breading, ham and dried onions. Still very good, but would use cupcake papers under them next time. They stuck like crazy even though I used an olive oil spray before baking. Yummy!

These were pretty good, but seemed dry to me after reheating the next day. I'll do them again and maybe try adding more cheese in the egg mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

only used 1/2 pkg of sausage.  added some red pepper.  sprinkled a little bit of pepper and mustard powder in the egg mixture.  ended up having to use 5 eggs. They are a hit!  they'd be wonderful for an on the go breakfast.

This is really good! More like breakfast cupcakes I would say. Could do with some seasoning. But a good breakfast to have.

OH YUM!!! this was such a great idea.  I am having friends over for an early breakfast tomorrow so I just made this tonight.  I HAD to eat one hot out of the oven! Sooo Good!! I used all the veggies I had in my fridge (Fresh spinach, green onion, red bell pepper and mushrooms) and added some leftover shredded cooked chicken I had made for another dish and froze previously.  So easy and fantastic.  I am sure everyone will love it!

I didn't have a chance to read the reviews before I made this so had to learn the hard way.  I anticipated that the biscuits would puff up too much so I cut them in half and did my best to press into and up the sides of the muffin tin (regular size). Mine did overflow.  I did use more egg than was called for though too. They tasted great and got rave reviews at work.  Next time I make them (and I will) I really won't change anything except to put a cookie sheet below the muffin tin in the oven to catch the drippings (there really wasn't a lot of them).  I'd also like to try with crescent dough.  Definitely a customizable recipe.

My family loved these!  I have made them several times now.  I use Pillsbury regular biscuits and make the 10 work for 12 muffin cups.  I add more onion, bell pepper, and lots more cheese and use crispy bacon crumbled instead of the sausage.

These remind me of mini breakfast casseroles.  I did leave out the green pepper and onion, for my children's sake.  But, I think the addition of them just would make it even better.  I used the cheap 7.5 oz. biscuits that come wrapped together with four tubes.   I rolled them out using a rolling pin.  I think the bigger and flatter you roll them out and the further up the sides of the muffin tin the biscuits go, the better the egg stays in when it cooks.  I also did not use muffin cups, I just greased the bottom of my muffin tins and they came out just fine.  One more note, I only needed about 1/2 pound of the sausage.  Any more than that, and I think the sausage would have taken up too much room and the egg would have overflowed when cooked.

Excellent recipe!  Very versatile! We've made this a number of times to accommodate a number of tastes and have yet to be disappointed.  The only mistake we've made is using the flaky layer biscuits.  It was my own fault, but it did make a mess of the oven.  However, they still tasted awesome!  Mushrooms are a great addition to the recipe.  We've also found that using crescent rolls makes for a very flaky and light crust.  To date we've used bacon, sausage, and canadian bacon.  And loved it all!  Our next creation will include spinach!

I give it 3.5 stars.  After reading all the reviews and seeing that the canned biscuits can puff up too much, I made my own biscuit mix with Bisquick.  I added some cheese to the egg mixtures and some salt, pepper, and garlic to the sausage mixture.  The flavor was good, and everyone at church liked them a lot.  I had sprayed my muffin pan with non-stick spray, and this made it hard to spread the biscuit mix up the sides, so I had a lot of biscuit on the bottom (as opposed to the biscuit "crust" the recipe is going for).  Overall, good recipe, easy to make and easy to mix up with different ingredients.

I thought this sounded great, so I made it for my children.  The biscuits turned out overcooked, with not enough egg filling per pie, making the whole thing rather dry.  I still think I'll try it again, but with regular pie crust dough instead of the biscuits.

These are awesome little breakfast bundles! You can substitute egg beaters, reduced fat crescent rolls, turkey bacon, and lite cheese. Then they come in around 100 calories. Gotta love that. My kids reheat them the nest morning, if any are left.

In my first attempt, I, too, used too much dough (Heart Healthy Bisquick was REALLY easy to use, but sticky to put in cupcake pan) and my eggs went over the edge. These were super tasty, though, so I tried again with about half as much dough in each cup and they were awesome! I just zap them in the micro for 30 seconds and I'm out the door in the morning!

I am giving this 5 stars.  I followed the recipe except we used link sausages that we cut up, and we didn't have green peppers so I omitted those.  Following others we used regular sized biscuits (ie not Grands) and the package had 10...so we cut a little part off each of them to make two extra to fill a total of 12 muffin cups.  When everything was added/poured the ingredients were almost level with the top of the cavities and ours rose up with no spilling over. (we had a cookie sheet underneath just in case.)  We left these sit for about 10 minutes and they popped right out of the pan and were easy for the kids to pick up with their hands to eat.  They were all gone in a matter of minutes.  Next time I will add more cheese and a few seasonings, like garlic powder, salt and pepper.

Good, but like many others, I had to use a lot more eggs!  I used the Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits in a can and had to use 8 medium eggs just to fill my 12-cake cupcake pan (and it's not a huge muffin, they are regular size).  I also omitted peppers & onions and added pepper & garlic powder to scrambled egg mixture.

Wanted to try this with what I had on hand.  I pulled Pillsbury Grand Biscuits apart to make half the size, rolled them out & used my larger 6 muffin cup pan.  I used 5 eggs & some chopped ham with the other listed ingredients.  Baked until the egg was set.  Very good and they are just fine warmed in the microwave if you have leftovers.  I think they would be good frozen, thawed and re-warmed, also.  Great "kid friendly" recipe for a healthy breakfast.

These are great.  I did use Grands biscuit rolls because I could not find the smaller ones at our grocery store.  Next time I will divide the dough in half per cup because the did get rather large and the egg mixture did spill out.  However, these were delicious.  Very similar to a breakfast casserole I make.  I like the "grab & go" concept for those busy mornings.  These are a keeper.  I even enjoyed one this morning cold and they were still good!!  Great for a brunch option too!

Good flavor and great concept - agree with another reviewer that even the Grands Jr's puff up way too much!  really press them up the sides.  I think they need to be eggier too - next time 4 eggs.  Reheated well.

I bought Grands biscuits before reading the review not to so I cut each biscuit in half and it worked perfectly. I used maple sausage, left out the bell pepper and added a dash of ground mustard. Delicious!

For those that are commented on the dryness of the recipe.  You can make your own biscuit dough or use a biscuit mix and add the drained sausage and shredded cheese to the dry ingredients after you have cut in the shortening and then add the liquid as directed.   Roll and cut out like regular biscuits.  These are awesome.

The short side of this recipe is using refrigerator biscuits. I'm going to try it using whole grain biscuit mix and short cut the skillet part by using frozen sausage breakfast scramble that's been nuked first to heat it up. I think that will take less time to make and cleanup, and have a better taste.  savanatbunnie: just look up Biscuit here on allrecipe. You'll get better results. Biscuits are almost exactly like scones except without sugar. There are two ways to make biscuits from scratch: by cutting in a fat (lard, shortening, butter or oil) and one that uses heavy cream instead. Personally I prefer the latter but the first is traditional for the US. Lard was originally used but now it's usually shortening (Crisco.)

I used hot sausage and buttermilk biscuits. Not exactly pretty to look at because they kinda spilled over the edges a little, but they are certainly delicious and so simple and versatile. Also, make sure to grease your muffin pan with cooking spray, it makes the biscuits slide right out.

I've made these several times! So easy and endless combinations make them a hit every time!  Try using pepper jack cheese for a spicy kick or swiss and ham with a little brown mustard.  You can even vary the size of the biscuit and muffin pan for larger or smaller portions.  Excellent!

I made these for a company breakfast and everyone loved them!!  I made 60 of them and they were gone within 30 minutes!!  I had the same problem as someone else with the egg spilling out of the muffin pan and all over the oven.  Guess I filled them too full.  Still great though!

I tried this last year for Christmas Morning.  They took a bit of prep work, but after
trying one, I didn't mind.  They are so tasty and filling

I was delighted at the flavor. I used an old baking powder biscuit recipe (to which I add a few tsps of sugar) and WOW! My picky 7 year old was thrilled and immediately needed a second one. I thought 'how gracious the flavors melded together and no one overbearing any one of the others. the sweet of the onion married the sweet of the biscuit and had pepper, sausage, egg and cheese...
Also right seasonings are important

Great for meal planning.  The first time I made them the biscuit burnt on the edges so the next time I cooked them for 13 min uncovered and then the last 5 covered in foil.  Worked like a charm

Tasted great. Depending on the Biscuit though it can be messy. Mine expanded too much and oozed off the top. My oven has most the ingredients on the bottom now. Needs Nutrition info.

Tasted great, but definitely turned into a mess! I used two 6 ounce cans of biscuit dough, but next time I will definitely use three! The eggs were all over the pan by the time it finished cooking and easily could have made 15 biscuits rather than 10.

My husband loves these and took a couple to the other guys in his platoon, and they demolished them;) I use reduced fat crescent rolls!!! So easy, just fold them over to get as close to a circle as you can:) They don't puff up nearly as much. I made them with biscuits this morning, cut in half, it took way longer and they seemed like they had too much biscuit on the bottom. Will make them with crescent roll dough from now on!

So good!  I made homemade pie crust (basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site) and filled them with zucchini, bell peppers, onion and feta.  We all love them, even my 19 month old.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm surprised no one has mentioned adding liners or butter or something to the tins! They stick all along the sides and were not cute. If you aren't fortunate enough to have nonstick everything I recommend using some type of stick prevention. Even though it says ungreased... Use liners .. Anything! 

Ps they were still yummy just ugly

I used Pillsbury   grands jr. Biscuits I used one per large muffin tin. (Makes 6 but you must add and egg.) If you use a regular size muffin tin then you need to cut the biscuit in half in order for it not to run over. They came out perfect! And they are so yummy!

THE BEST!!!  Focusing on the do - If biscuits dough to big cut in half and stretch to fill all tin cups and use the rest to patch, etc. Besides the sausage I also added ham and soften the onions and peppers in micro wave before adding to frying pan. I used two eggs - maybe a little bit more milk but not much (can't go wrong).  Sprayed the tin cups with cooking spray - when adding the meat mixture PRESS with back of spoon or fingers into bottom of dough - cooked on middle oven rack.  I TESTED ONE - If you think over flow egg mixture might happen us a cookie sheet underneath (but I didn't have to).  I WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!

These were okay. Flattening the biscuits made them tough and there really wasn't a lot of flavor.  I thought these would be easy, but I think making egg casserole the night before is easier. Probably won't make them again.

Delish! I baked them in muffin tins lined with parchment paper and tore grands in half as the base. Make a hole for the "stuffing". Yum. No mess!

This is such a great breakfast for kids! We use bisquick for the bottom and the kids love to help put all of the layers together. We serve with a small bowl of syrup or honey for dipping - sure it's not super healthy but very filling and fun!

An interesting way to fix an egg dish. Like someone suggested, I left out the dough to cut down on unnecessary carbs, and spillage. I also used mostly egg whites and used Colby-Jack as well as Sharp Cheddar in different batches.  Didn't use green peppers but did add diced mushrooms. It was like a conveniently shaped omelet that froze and transported well.

These are quite tasty. I did have some problems with the mechanics of this recipe. I used homemade biscuit dough, as I have an allergy to a preservative in many breads. My dough did not stick to sides of the container. I ended up with what looked like a muffin with sausage and cheese on top. Would have been nicer if the mixture was in the center. Not sure if my dough was the problem as it was a yeast dough. Might try putting some dough on top next time and see if that contains the filling. Another reviewer mentioned that pie dough might be better. It would conform to the container better, but I think it would turn out more like a quiche than a muffin. I used ramekins instead of muffin pans and I had no spillage with mine. I will make these again. The filling is easy to change to your liking and they are convenient to grab in the morning as you are rushing out the door.

This recipe is great! Highly customizable and delicious! I used crescent rolls and bacon because that's what I had on hand. I also threw a little ricotta cheese in the egg mixture and they were fabulous! Great to make ahead of time and use all week as quick work breakfasts!

Great recipe. I used vege sausage and be sure to use jumbo cupcake pans so the egg doesn't spill over all over the oven. It's easy to customize to your liking.

I've made these a ridiculous amount of times! These don't last longer than an afternoon with my fiance and roommate!  Insteaad of a regular onion I use green onions.  I wil also use turkey bacon instead of the sausage to mix things up.  Great recipe!!!

These were awesome!! Much better than I actually expected, thinking they may come out tasting abit eggy but not at all!  The tast was very well balanced.  For those cooks with the magic bullet in thier kitchen, I sauteed the onion and sausage together then added it together with the milk egg and seasoning, whipped it all together with the cross blade and voila!!  Also I used bisquick for the lining of the muffin cups.  It was all very easy and the pies were a smash hit.  Next time I am going to try spinach and ham...I think you could really doll this recipe up to your own tastes!  Thanks very much CRANEJWR for posting!

Such a GREAT recipe!  I made it Christmas morning today and it was a nice treat.  Because of some of the reviews, I used crescent roll dough instead of the biscuit dough.  This made 8, so each "pie" was quite full - but still yummy!  This would be a delicious addition to any brunch.  The sausage, gr peppers/onions can be done in advance too!  I'll definitely make this again!  I served it with fruit and coffee cake.

Delicious! I make this by mixing up a small box of jiffy pie crust mix with water (fills the bottom of about 18 muffin cups) and then do spinach, feta, and egg whites for me or ham and cheddar and egg for my boyfriend. Or any combo you like! They take about 24 mins for me. EXCELLENT RECIPE!

Good, fast and easy qualities I like in my breakfast muffins which is much more fitting of a name.  I do also like them spicy however so I added diced jalapeño which gave them a heck of a kick.

I tried these for the first time earlier this week.  I just finished baking a large batch to freeze.  These are so easy and tasty!  Where have these been all my life!  I followed the recipe but made some substitutions on some of them for variety (ham and swiss, bacon and pepper cheese etc.).  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

These were great. Super easy to make, with the exception of trying to divide the egg mixture. I had to mix more egg mixture to pour into empty shells. Also, I used half cresents and half biscuits- both were equally as good.

I made these for my boys for lunch break one at school, unfortunately my boys are reallllly picky so I had to make my own version. I used the biscuit dough then filled them with scrambled eggs and bacon (already cooked and cooled ) topped them with cheese and baked them til the biscuit was cooked HUGE hit with the kids and my Hubby.  I heated them for the boys before they went to school and by first lunch they were still warm. Thank You!!

The flavor was good, they were a little too dry and somewhat tough on the biscuit bottom for us.  If I make these again I will try using crossiant rolls instead of biscuits.   I also used green onions instead of a regular onion.

These were pretty good, but I think the egg mixture needs some seasoning (salt and pepper would be good).  I used a 12-ounce package of bacon instead of sausage and added extra onion.  I'll definitely make these again, increasing the recipe by three so I can have extras to put in the freezer for quick schoolday breakfasts.

This was not a big hit in our house-DD thought it was ok but neither DH or I cared for it. I did use bacon instead of sausage so that may have affected things.

We omitted the sausage because my husband does not eat pork or turkey.  Although we did not have any meat these were very good.  Next time I may try these with tofu!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these last night...DELISH!!  Some changes...used pie crust, turkey bacon, 4 eggs, salt/pepper and some cheese.  Mixed it all together and poured into "cups" and baked at 400 for 18 mins. BIG HIT!

This was a success all around.  I initially made it as written, but it can be easily modified to meet the needs of an individual family.  I can see using hot sausage, turkey sausage, or vegetarian if the need called for it.  I didn't use the turkey baster egg trick, but I have a bowl with a pour spout that made adding the eggs simple and mess free.  I had to get out the rolling pin to get the biscuits big enough to line my cups, and my prep time was probably closer to 30 minutes.

400 seemed too high of a temp or 18-20 min was too long of a cook time( I set oven timer for 16 min...and still...). These kinda burned in my oven dunno why. I can see the potential in these. I will try em again. I made 24 of these using 1 log of "breakfast sausage", 5 XL eggs and a lil less than 1/4 milk. Next time I will use an additional egg or two, ended scooping about 2 tblsp of egg mixture over ea.

I thought these were really good! Very versatile and simple to make. I used bacon instead of sausage, we are more of a bacon family. I also omitted the onion and green pepper.. Instead I added a touch of onion powder to the mix. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it turned out very good! I will make these again!!

DH loved these, I just thought they were OK.  I'm really only able to get Grands biscuits at our grocery so I had to cut each biscuit down.  However, I used a whole pound of sausage so I made more than 10 muffins.  These were tasty but a bit annoying to make.  I'm considering making and baking them, then popping them into the freezer for breakfast/lunch options.

Outstanding! I am always looking for new ways to cook breakfast and be able to use left overs for the work week. This recipe accomplishes that.  I used smoked turkey sausage because that it what we had on hand, the rest I followed the recipe. Very tasty. This will be a regular in our house.  Only one suggestion I have and I should have known better. Place the muffin pan on a baking sheet in case there is overflow of the sausage/egg mixture.

I was really excited about this recipe - but they did not live up to the expectation. I followed the recipe to a T except I subbed bacon for the sausage and made my own biscuits. First of all, I didn't even use half of the meat, onion, pepper mixture because if I did it would have overflowed even more than it did. This was basically a biscuit with an egg coating on top.

Made these for Christmas morning.  I love the fact that I could make them the day before and just reheat them!  I had alot of filling left over.  I would buy two biscuit rolls next time.  I also filled them too full and they leaked out into my oven and made a smelly mess.  Everyone liked them and I would make them again.

Really good and very easy.  I didn't have any peppers when I was making them but they were really good without.  I think next time I will put some cheese in the cup before I put the meat filling in.

My 5yr old grandson  helped me make these and he could not wait to eat one..ended up eating 2 and wanted to take them home.  Next time I make them, which will be for Xmas morning I will add sliced mushrooms, too.  These were fantastic and so easy. Great to take along on long trips in the car with a good cup of coffee. I'll be making these many times.  My son asked for the recipe, too.

My family loves these. We vary the ingredients according to whim. Sometimes we do bacon or ham instead of sausage, and omit or add peppers and onions as the case may be, as well as different cheeses. It's a neat concept that can be customized to suit tastes. I also do as another reviewer suggested, and use the flaky layers biscuits, and get 12 pies out of them. If you do this, add another egg and another tablespoon of milk.

These were GREAT!! I used just plain store brand bicuits and 4 Morningstar Farms veggie breakfast sausage patties. Everything else as directed.  As with almost everyone else, I overfilled the tins or something and the egg mixture ran over, burned on the bottom of the oven and stunk up the house. :) However! The finished product was mighty tasty and I will be making more of them in the next day or so, for the freezer.  Thanks!

Delicious & easy to make.  I used Pillsbury canned biscuits and had no trouble with overflowing.  I used a cookie scoop to transfer egg mixture.  I used both red pepper and green pepper for color.

Tasty little breakfast snack, great for the rushed person. Now that I'm cooking for 2 it's handy to cook these once a week. Do watch the time, as I found that these cooked in about 12 to 15 minutes.

I only used half of a biscuit and did not mold it like the recipe called for because of a review stating that the biscuit got too brown.  Keeping the biscuit on the bottom worked out pretty good, except could hardly taste the biscuit.  Frankly, I think the bigger muffin tins would work better but I don't own any.

These are fantastic!  I made mine in a deep muffin tin, so I could use flaky layered biscuit dough (Grands-type), subbed bacon for the sausage, subbed a small forkful of sour cream for the milk in the eggs, and added onion powder to the eggs.

i tried this recipie and OMG it is sooooooo good! I used bacon, instead of sausage, because i had it on hand and my hubby and 2 yr old son gobbled them up. I loved them too. Great brunch idea for company. Im starting a new tradition and making them on Christmas morning! Thanks for this recipie!!

This is a very versitile recipe! I used bacon instead of sausage and shredded cheddar cheese b/c that's what I had. Very easy to just add what you like and take out what you don't! I made them to have a quick breakfast for me to grab on my way out the door in the mornings, great recipe, thanks!

Personally, I recommend that, when using that "Biscuit in a Tube" dough, you can cut the dough in half for each individual biscuit. There is too much "biscuit" involved, otherwise. I like a lot of topping/filling, and I'd rather be having more meat and veggies and cheese than biscuit. It makes for a heartier "Breakfast Pie!"

I made this for a potluck for teachers at my son's school  and it got a great review! I used the basic 7.5 oz biscuit doughnot Grands. I was worried that the dough was too thin after I stretched it, but it was fine. I sprinkled the cheese over the sausage and then added the egg. Using 4 eggs, 4 T milk and another tube of dough, I was able to make 18.I think my kids would even like them as they are not too egg-y. Smelled and looked great. I would recommend this. Give yourself enough time to work with the dough!

If I could give these 3.5 stars, I would.  Three seems too few, four is too generous!  My middle- and high-school aged kids are always running late & complain when I "make" them eat breakfast.  These are a quick & easy solution for them to heat & eat on the go!  I used 2 pkgs of store-brand biscuits since I read on here to avoid Pillsbury b/c they rise too much, but these did too despite my flattening them and trying to create a pocket for the fillings.  Because I had 20 pcs of dough & 24 cupcake openings, I took a few and halved them as someone suggested.  I will definitely do that next time as the full-dough ones didn't allow enough egg mixture.  I used one roll of turkey sausage with green & red peppers and onions.  For 24 "pies" I could only use (fit) 6 eggs (with 6 T milk) without fear of spilling over while baking, which some still did.  Also, all 5 of us feel these are a little bland.  Perhaps it's the store dough, but the idea itself is great and worth the tweaks -- especially since the kids now have something hot & easy to help start their day.  *ALSO!  Be sure you spray the muffin tins well.  I thought I did, but they still stuck - a lot!  :\

My family really enjoyed making and eating these! I will agree that the Grands Jr. biscuits are too large to use.  I will use a regular small biscuit next time.  I made one batch per this recipe and another batch and used diced ham instead of the sausage.

We enjoyed these. The only thing I did different was use a different biscuit dough. It was cheddar and garlic, and I made about 16 with that. So I doubled the egg and milk amount too, for that many.

These are sooooo yummy! I will be making them a lot. I used a jumbo muffin pan and grands biscuits. I gently pulled the biscuits as flat as I could using my hands, then placed them in the muffin pan, pressing them against the sides until they reached the top of the well. Then I placed a couple of spoonfuls of sausage and onion in it, spooned in enough egg mixture to reach the top of the biscuit dough, then topped it with grated cheese.  I baked them in my convection oven for 10 minutes and they turned out perfect! I can't wait to try them smothered in country gravy. Next time, I might try adding in a few shredded hashbrowns to the egg mixture.

These are wonderful...the only changes I made were to use hot Italian sausage and red pepper . These are great during the work week. Just open the fridge, place in microwave and instant breakfast.
A keeper for sure :-)

This was a good on the go type breakfast.  However, I couldn't get much filling into the middle of the biscuit.  Maybe it was the brand of biscuits I used??  I may try again and use separated flaky biscuits or even crescent rolls.

This recipe was easy and really good!! I used regular breakfast sausage links(10)instead.  Worked well as a last minute subsitution. Just fried them up in a pan and chopped them up and edded them to the egg mixture.  Also I used the grands biscuits but I split the biscuit in half, and only used one half per muffin cup. This worked well and caused no spilling of the egg mixture when cooking in the oven.  My picky boyfriend even took some the next day! (and they are just as good the second day too!!)

I tried this recipe with my 3-year-old and we all loved it!  She ate more than I did!  I didn't use the green peppers, and I used a little less milk in the eggs.  It made for a different and tasty dinner, with a fast and hearty breakfast the next morning.

These things are fabulous!!!  I made them for Sunday school breakfast, and everyone loved them.  I made some with onions and peppers and some without.  They were very easy.  All of them were eaten, so after evening service my husband had me make some more.  He loved them, and so did my kids.  I will definitely make them again.

Pretty good. Kids didn't like them much, but the adults loved them. I used Grands biscuits and peeled each one in half. I soft scrambled the eggs. No problems with overflow.

I was tempted to give this 3 stars because of the absolute mess it made of my oven and muffin tin, but I realize it's probably mostly because of my lack of experience. Whatever you do, don't overfill your cups! Next time I'm using a cookie sheet underneath and filling the cups less. I used two eggs, pre-diced ham I'd bought, and mexican blend cheese (in a regular-sized muffin pan). This made for a much faster prep and only 6 pies for my small family. Cooked only 15 minutes. Perfect for my two year old and my husband to eat en route to work if he's running late. Will definitely try again with different variations and the must-have cookie sheet.

Great, easy recipe I made with things already in my fridge. Next time I will have to make more because they were all eaten before I knew it. Don't be aftaid to pile up the sausage. (The more the better.) I used just plain cheddar and that was good too. You could probably use what ever cheese you prefer.

These are SO GREAT!  They are quick to prepare, contain basic ingredients probably already in your fridge, and the variations are endless.  I haven't yet found how to stop egg from spilling out of at least one cup in each batch, however.  This minor flaw certainly doesn't stop me from making them every week!  Yum!  Thanks Jeanne!

This recipe was good but needed a little bit of flavor, so I added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the pan, subbed bacon, for sausage, and added salt and pepper to taste for egg mix.  I also used old/sharp cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack found it made the cheese flavor stand out more.

My family found these very tasty!!! I mixed & matched the ingredients a bit.  My 4 yr. old's were cheese & egg only.  Mine were veggies only.  My husband's were filled with all of the ingredients listed.  They turned out great!! These would be great made ahead of time & then re-heated during the week for a quick morning breakfast.

I made these today and they turned out great. I didn't have biscuits on hand so I used 1 sheet of puff pastry, rolled it out just a bit and divided it into 6 rectangles. I used my large 6  muffin pan. I put diced onion, bell pepper, bacon and spinach leaves in first. Then a sprinkle of cheese. Poured in my eggs till 1/2 full and then topped with a bit more grated cheese. I had to bake them about 25 minutes because of the bigger size but they turned out yummy. No overspill and I started with 8 eggs. I cant wait to see how they reheat for breakfast this week

Excellent recipe but I would use a green like spinach or chard rather than green peppers.

I used crescent rolls and kind of rolled them in a nonstick backing cup. I added veggies in first, then egg then cheese.. They turned out cute with the little triangle corner. Would make again.

Relatively easy. Does have some prep work. 
One tip: roll out biscuit dough, press paper muffins cups flat on rolled out dough. Trim dough with knife 1/4” bigger. Cup will hold dough as u press into muffin tin. 
Convention oven works well - lower temp 25 degrees. 
Toaster over - covered the foil  for first 10 mins

These tasted good but didn’t turn out as I had envisioned. The egg mixture ended up on the top of the biscuit not on the inside(see pic). I made these as others suggested, in a large muffin cup pan, but they still somewhat  overflowed. Next time I’ll half the biscuit and to see if that changes the result. I don’t normally review but thought this may be helpful to  someone.

I could have just tossed all the ingredients onto the floor of my oven. That's what happened anyway. Why not just put an egg and sausage in between a biscuit? 

I'll give it two stars because I thought it was a good idea. The technique is unsound, however.

Love these breakfast muffins.  Taste amazing and only 240 calories.  I made them in a small cupcake pan so I got 12 breakfast pies from the recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is to spray the pan with cooking spray before putting the dough in the pan.

Here’s the deal .....  These looked perfect for a family brunch, but I’m gluten free. My challenge is ALWAYS to make meals gluten free, while still being yummy for everyone! SO this is how I solved THAT problem. I mixed up a batch of GF biscuits. They were a bit gooey...so I put a tablespoon of dough in each (greased) muffin spot and SQUASHED it w a greased/floured (GF) shotglass! Each muffin spot had a nice biscuit bottom/sides. The rest was “as recipe” - and they turned out beautiful! And no ones the wiser that they’re GlutenFree!!

I used small grand biscuits and the next time I may even pull those apart to just get half a biscuit.  The flavor was great.  I actually did a test run tonight because I plan to make them Christmas morning.  We like things hot so I will probably add some Frank's to some of them.  I'm glad it was easy enough to try out before I need to serve them.  They tasted great.

Great crowd pleaser... I only used 1/2 of the biscuit per pie... which allowed me 16 pies.. used ham chopped in small pieces... sprinkled with cheese then added egg mixture and of course extra cheese!  Next attempt will be with breakfast sausage to serve with white gravy!

I have been struggling to find an easy recipe to make at a weekend retreat.  Inot a fan of breakfast casseroles, so when I found this recipe, I decided to make a test batch.  I made some of the batch in regular sized muffin tins with half a biscuit as others have suggested.  The rest were made in larger muffin pan.  I used the store brand biscuits, green onion, and green pepper.  Tried using a store brand Mexican shredded cheese (colby jack with a bit of spice)

Be careful not to overfill the cups with the egg mixture etc.  They will overflow in the oven.  You'll need at least 10 pies to fully use all the ingredients - 11 or 12 may be better.  I may try crescent roll dough next time.

I made this for an early Christmas celebration with my family (since my husband and I work at a hospital on Christmas Day).  I used crescent rolls in both traditional butter as well with Hawaiian sweet crescent rolls.  I used a red bell pepper and onions with sausage.  Then I put the cheese on top and used green onions (so to keep with the Christmas theme).  I used a salad dressing bottle to pore the eggs.  I made them ahead of time and froze them.  Wow!  They were perfect.  Will definitely make again!

I don’t own muffin tins so I had to modify slightly.  I doubled the egg/milk and added diced tomatoes on top and baked 5 minutes longer.  Everything else I did as recipe was written. My husband loved it!

These wee good. I bought the big and deep cup cake liners and those worked great!  I rolled out the dough to a little bigger so it came up on the sides but they were still good. I also used the hot sausage.

Loved these!  They were simple and easy, but I didn't really read the directions.  When it said to fill '10' muffin cups, I thought maybe I just bought a small tube of Grands biscuits, so I just used the 8 in the pack.   Afterwards I realized that everything overflowed because I used one biscuit per muffin cup, rather than separating the biscuits to make 10 (and perhaps even 12) muffins.  In the end, they tasted great anyway (and cleaning the bottom of the oven wasn't hard at all ;)

I made them in mini-loaf pans, topping them with some cilantro and a bit of tomato for color. They look adorable! I did use the turkey baster which worked like a charm. I was less impressed with the taste. The biscuit part on the bottom was dry and tasteless. And clean up was a bear! Wherever the dough stuck to the pan (a non-stick pan!) it stuck. And I had 16 individual loaf sections to clean. So....not sure I'll make this one again.

I think this is way too much filling for 10 muffin tins.  I actually split up the biscuits into 12 sections.  I tried not to overfill the tins, but the egg overflowed and made a mess of the oven.  I didn't even use all the filling.  I had enough left over to make a small casserole!  That said, they really are very tasty.  I plan to refrigerate them mad reheat

I bought the large biscuit rolls, cut them into halves and some even into thirds before I flattened and stretched them onto the tray, so that there wasn’t so much bread. They came out fantastic! I’ll definitely make those again!

I used crescent rolls divided into a 12 muffin tin.  Sprayed generously with Pam, used turkey sausage but then followed the recipe as written.  Did not have any problems with it overflowing.  Great to grab out of the freezer, microwave and have a satisfying breakfast.

Followed direction exactly, about 1/4-1/2 of the sausage left over.  Only used 2 eggs, 2tbsp milk, and everything overflowed in the oven.  I recommend using mini meat pie tins instead of muffin tins...   other than that, seems to have turned out decent.

These egg muffin pies were fun for company, you could literally hold them and eat them like a muffin which was great for a brunch! I added some fresh salsa to the sausage pepper mix which gave a southwest flavor! I also sprayed the muffin pan with olive oil and they came out easily.

Great recipe. Used pillsbury grandes for crust as I built it in a casserole dish rather than individual portions. Had bacon so used that, crumbled goat cheese in egg mixture. Came out as a delish 'quiche'. Husband and I both loved it

I will make it again, but change the ingredients to spicier for adult tastes.  I think kids would like it as it is. But a little bland for most adults. Spicier sausage and sharper cheese.  Plus the canned biscuits are just canned biscuits.  I'll make my own biscuits thinner than normal as someone else suggested. The 3 eggs was plenty for the eight biscuits in my tin. Also use a muffin liner or silicone pan.  Too sticky.  Some work to get them out. Good basic recipe.

I used puff pastry , shallots instead of onion, orange bell pepper and heavy cream and I use a glass measuring cup to mix liquid ingredients and pour into cups.  Great for parties so I leave out the meat.

An old carried over for me, having made 'mini pizzas' in this manner. A great way to keep a quick bite to eat on hand. Also very versatile, so let your imagination go wild here!

I have made this multiple times now.  It's the best!  i do use a little more egg than the recipe calls for since it doesn't seem to go far enough.  I no longer even measure anything since I have made it so much.

These were really good and easy to make. I added the eggs into biscuit cups first, then sausage and cheese and it still made a bit of an eggy mess on the pan, but still delicious.

After reading the reviews l, I held back on over filling these.   A couple still spilled over.  My only real complaint is too much biscuit compared to filling.  I think this recipe needs a bit of tweaking.

These turned out great. I used Grands flaky biscuits. Some of them I divided in half. I liked the way they turned out both ways. It gave us a choice if we wanted more bread our less bread.

This is a great recipe! I am a vegetarian so the only change I made was to use vegetarian sausage, other than that I didn't change anything. I actually didn't even read the reviews before making and I had absolutely no problem with overflow. They look like perfect little muffins! They didn't stick either and I didn't grease the muffin tin. I was careful to press the biscuit all the way up the side and not overfill the egg mixture. If i had anything bad to say it would be to agree with some other reviews that it is a bit doughy but we love biscuits in this house so it doesn't bother us. Will definitely make this many more times!!!

A great recipe as is, or you can add whatever ingredients you like! I love making these for Sunday breakfasts. I use crescent dough instead of biscuit dough, it just works better for me. A couple variations that I like include bacon, onion, and cheddar. Sausage and Swiss. Or veggie medley with onion, peppers, tomato, mushrooms, and feta cheese. Yum! Happy cooking. :)

Instead of a muffin pan, I used a 9x9 cake pan and formed 9 square cups out of parchment inside. I also used homemade biscuit dough ('Sadie's buttermilk biscuits' from this website). I baked them for 25 minutes, and I added extra onion.

I made this for my family and it immediately caused chaos.  Everyone wanted more but I'd only made a dozen.  I used a biscuit recipes from this site and this really added to the taste, texture and down home goodness of this sandwich.  I'm making them again right now, except with canned biscuits and hope they turn out just as well this time.  If not, I'll have to switch back to the homemade biscuit recipe, but either way its delicious.

I made these for a breakfast brunch and the reviews were fantastic! Wish I had read the review about not using Grands. I had the same problem with the eggs mixture spilling over and burning onto the bottom of the oven.  Since the pies were so well received, I will use the grands again but will make sure I have some spillover protection

These turned out pretty good! The bottoms got a little too done so next time we'll try to cut the time a little. We will also try this recipe with a different sausage to see if it adds some more flavor to it. Our 9 and 12 year old boys also enjoyed this one!

I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls bit otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and these are delicious. My husband is already asking when I'm going to make them again (we literally just finished eating). Planning on trying to make a batch and freeze as an easy breakfast before work! Definitely recommend making!

I mixed the filling ingredients together and add cheese. Also a quick splash of hot sauce for kick. These barely get a chance to cool in my house. You can use bacon in place of sausage. Epic!

I made these for breakfast today and they were a hit! I used flaky biscuits and instead of using green pepper I just used 1/4 of an onion. I also used turkey sausage, uncased them and then cooked them with the onion. They turned out perfectly and I will definitely be making them again.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was really simple to make and tasted so good. I followed the recipe and made an extra point to get the dough thin which filled the muffin pan perfectly.  I used a 1 Tablespoon measuring spoon to add the egg mixture in with. This worked out to be about 2 Tablespoons for each muffin. And they didn't over flow at all.  I plan on making this again in the near future.

These are a good, portable snack or meal, depending on how many you eat. Took another reviewer's suggestion of using the whole croissants in 12 large muffin tins. Used 1lb pork, half a green pepper, a small onion and 8 eggs. Wasn't sure if it would try to spillover (as others have reported), so liberally covered with cheese right after bringing out of the oven (was hot enough to melt, no issue). Large tins took 17 minutes, and were nicely golden. Teenagers tore them up!

these were great. the only problem I had was that I didn't cut the biscuits in half. so when they cooked up they plumbed up and over flowed. other than that wonderful

Made these once for Easter Brunch and my husband loved them.  The extras I froze for breakfast during the week.  Instead of using biscuit dough I made a savory crust.  Used Martha Stewart's recipe  excellent.

These were great as an Easter brunch item that I made this past weekend.  My husband raved about them and was ready to eat them all before I was going to serve them.  I had changed it up a little (which I always seem to do with recipes).  I added 1/2 hot sausage with 1/2 regular sausage and I put 1/4 c. italian blend cheese and a 1/4 c cheddar cheese as I didn't have the monteray jack.  I would definitely mix the ingredients together like another reviewer suggested as it was hard for the egg mixture to reach the sausage for the most part.  But they were delish for sure.  I have a picture but the camera is not with me while I'm writing this review.

This is a keeper, although I used real bacon bits instead of the sausage. Quick and easy recipe that I'll continue to use and experiment with in other ways as well.

Excellent - will definitely make this again!  Substituted Mrs. Dash Onion & Herb for the onions & peppers (more room for eggs), and bacon for the sausage.  My husband, a firefighter,  can take a few of these to work for a quick, filling breakfast.  Notes:  Per others' suggestions, I made my own biscuits, and that worked out great!  I overdid it filling the muffin tin cups, so I have to work on that.  :-)

Made the recipe to the T but most all the egg spilled out as the biscuit dough rose.  Manipulating the biscuit dough onto the muffin pan toughened the biscuit.

I had the first batch spill over the sides. I split the biscuits like the directions said and I still had trouble. I think I put too much egg in. I cut back on 2nd and 3rd batch. Very tasty. Going to make one batch with frozen hashbrowns next. Messy oven now, but they taste really good.

I have made these several times, with different types of sausage, and they're always a hit. The only thing I do differently is to use biscuit mix/batter instead of canned biscuits. My son took some to his culinary school instructor, and he loved them, too!

Made this recipe for church and it was a hit!  My youngest son,who is the pickiest eater, loves it and keeps asking me to make it for breakfast on weekends so he can have some on his way to school each morning.  I did change it up.  I used flaky biscuits and only used half a biscuit in each one.  Make sure to use a very pointed spouted pitcher to pour in the eggs.  I had a hard time not eating the sausage mixture before it got into the cups. :)

LOVED these! I doubled the recipe and made 1/2 with biscuit and 1/2 with hash browns. The biscuit ones were a little too " bready" for my family. I also doubled the eggs and turned out good in regards to egg /cheese/ biscuit ratio. Good to make ahead and heat up the next day in the microwave.

This is a great starter recipe. Start with it and then customize it to fit your lifestyle. We use whole wheat pie crust to make more room for egg and veggies (spinach, kale, celery, peppers, etc.)for the adults and use small portions of whole wheat biscuits with more cheese and proteins for the kids. We also have used a few shredded potatoes for the crust when in a hurry, just make sure you oil the pan really well before baking. Thanks for the inspiration!

Three stars for flavor and 4 stars for practicality. Made this so we could eat them while travelling on a long trip and not have to stop as there are not may option in the first three hours of our route. I just didn't care for that funny flavor of refrigerator dough. Will try again with homemade dough.

I followed this recipe to a "T"..... But it fell short... The bottom of the biscuits gets hard and I would cut back on the milk...maybe add an extra egg or two so the filling has more of an egg taste instead of just dry biscuit and sausage.... 
I use allrecipes often and never been disappointed !  The breakfast casserole dishes on the site are much better than this one...

This is my boyfriend's favorite thing to have for breakfast! Since it's just the two of us I thawed out a couple frozen biscuits so I wouldn't waste the rest of the refrigerated ones. And I cooked it for 15 min. They came out perfect!

Great recipe....my husband loved them! I used the Grands, Jr. biscuits, and they were perfect. I flattened the biscuit dough by hand and they fit nicely into the muffin cups. Instead of the onions and peppers, I used greens onions and mushrooms (I happened to have both in fridge). I think the recipe can be customized to your likes and dislikes. Will definitely make again!

My family loved these! We made individual breakfast pies in four 7 ounce ramekins measuring 5 inches across using four biscuits and dividing the sausage and egg mixtures evenly. We cooked them for 18 minutes and they were perfect! We will be making these again and again!

DISCLAIMER- I am doing the very thing I hate when you do ...reviewing a recipe I modified. Sorry.  But I wanted to share that if you don't have refrigerator biscuits on hand you can use Bisquick with some success.  I rolled the biscuit dough very thin (1/4") and still the finished product was very "biscuity" a bit too much bread and the egg and cheese kind of melted into the biscuit. Next time I might bake the biscuits a bit first to seal it off to keep the filling more separate.  I filled the cups with sausage and cheese and egg beaters.  I baked in greased large six muffin tin for 18 minutes.   Gather the crowd when these come out of the oven they are puffed, golden and beautiful.  They were good and worth continuing to experiment with ...I may even try the actual recipe!  Thanks CraneJWR

A couple of issues I had when making this: do not use muffin paper liners inside muffin pan or you will be peeling paper off them. I used the Grands Bisquits but cut them in half, they tend to stick so cooking spray should be used prior to placing in the muffin pan. Otherwise good and cute idea for breakfast.

A girlfriend made these for our "girls weekend" and would agree with those who said not to use GRAND size biscuits. Too big, but otherwise super delicious and one recipe I definitely want to make again. They reheat really well for a snack or for kids to warm as an early school day morning breakfast.

Yummy! I took some advice from prior reviews and split the dough into 12 muffin cups instead of ten (there was plenty), added a little extra cheese (3/4 cup), and mixed the egg, sausage, & veggies together before pouring over the biscuits. Delicious!

I made a huge batch of these up for the freezer. Although my picky eater(6yr old) wouldn't eat them. they didn't even last a full week with all my other kids snacking on them. Most Definitely a big hit , but next time I will try and hide them.

I just had to try this today! We love mushrooms, so I added fresh choppoed mushrooms to the sausauge/onion/papper mix, and also used the entire bag of cheese on top. My muffin tin has 12 spots, so I took a little dough off of each of the 10 already-cut, and made 12. I had no problem with anything overflowing. Everything was delicious. Can't wait to try it with bacon!

This is a good recipe, love the fact I can make ahead. I used croissants instead of the biscuits.  The girls at the office thought they were great.  Very easy to make, I did add more seasonings to this, of course salt and pepper and I just used ground turkey because it was on sale. Seasoned with italian seasoning and a little cummin because I was feeling "frisky".  Will add something to make it a little spicy the next time.  Will make this again!

So easy to adapt: I didn't have sausage, so I used ham. I used one tube of crescent rolls, cutting them in squares, I didn't try to make them fill the cup,like pie crusts, but let the four corners stick up. I used custard cups so they were a little larger than muffin tins and they were perfect!

These were good.  I wish I had frozen the extras because they went to waste.  The biscuit wasn't as good later and I found myself wishing it was pie crust...okay, that's a quiche!  I admit that I used homemade biscuits.  I should have greased the muffin cups a lot better.  It took me like 30 minutes of scrubbing to get them clean.

I usually would use sage sausage but I didn't have it.
I added a little sage, red pepper flakes, garlic and a little bit of southwestern seasoning to the mix.  Really good!

This is in the oven right now. I didn't make individual ones, I used a frozen deep dish pie shell and filled it. I have made this several times and add anything that my husband and I like in an omelet. This has never failed!!!!! Great breakfast dish!!!!!!

I've now made these as written about four or five times and they are great for quick breakfasts on the go. I now add an extra egg and triple or quadruple the recipe and freeze them for a month's worth at a time. The recipe calls for refrigerated biscuit dough. The plain, cheap kind. Lining a muffin pan is not the place you want to try to go light, flaky and fluffy or you will have problems. I also went out and got a silicone muffin pan after the first few batches knowing I would never make them again if I had to scrape out another "nonstick" pan and it was a lifesaver! Just put a stiff cookie sheet under it so you don't get sloshy. I would suggest adding the cheese before the egg to integrate it just a bit, otherwise it can create a shell on top. Thank for the recipe!

Excellent when making a quick dash out the door in the morning.  I make a batch using my leftover Sunday breakfast, then stick each in a ziplock bag and pop them in the freezer.  My favorite was with the leftover sausage gravy in the center of the biscuit and topped with mozzarella, they didn't even last a week.

I used canned croissants rather than biscuits - basically lined the bottom of the cup with it and built up the sides by smooshing the dough to form the insides of the muffin cups. Also I used bacon I made traditionally and pulled apart one per muffin cup. To make the eggs easier I scrambled them up rather than having them set in the oven. 
1- Croissant base
2- Pinch of shredded cheddar
3- Scrambled eggs
4- Jam bacon pieces into egg with your (clean) fingers, because it's fun. 
(Dash o' salt n' pepper) 
5- More shredded cheddar, because you can never have too much cheese.

Voila! I felt it was easier, and they tasted like drive through breakfast croissant sandwiches!

Amazing!!! I made these for my kids to microwave before school and work in the mornings.Do not use the big bisquits, use regular, otherwise the muffin tin is full of bisquit with no room for the filling. I added hash browns to my filling also, they are awesome!!

My family loves these but I think using 3/4 lb of sausage with only 3 eggs would be way too much sausage (for us). So I used 1/2 lb of sausage with 3 eggs & 1 cup of cheese. I used a small ladle to scoop the filling in and it worked perfectly.

I loved these. They were amazing. Never got any pictures, because we ate them too fast. I made my own biscuit dough and I think that helped a lot. I made them a second time and tried to use bacon, it was not as good. Maybe if I would have left them in larger pieces and not all crumbled up. 
Another thing I like to do is make biscuits and put them in the muffin tins for when I make biscuits and gravy cups. 
Try these, they are great!! Everyone loves them and they are great to eat on the go!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and made 12 little pies, and put the remaining ingredients into an actually pie pan. Then I scrambled an egg and cooked it to where the bottom was done but the top wasn't, and I flipped it upside down onto the pie to over it and put it in the oven. Fantastic. Will make this again for sure.

very good recipe starter.  i read some of the other reviews and used 1/2 a crescent roll in my 12 muffin tin and then just filled each with eggs and toppings.  they were very easy, pretty, and just delicious.  definitely a go-to recipe in my book from now on.  THANK YOU CRANEJWR!

Delicious! I used chopped turkey and cubed sharp cheddar. I also added onion powder to the egg mix and used the baster as suggested for the egg filling. My only issue was that the biscuits stuck to the pan so I'll be greasing it next time.

This was a very basic recipe. It was very tasty. I reserve the five start rating for the recipes that I can't get enough of and eat until I'm going to explode. But like I said this was very good.

First time making any variety of quiche, and these are easy and delicious!  I wanted to try a different crust with it, and other than that followed the recipe exactly.  They are wonderful and will make for a very quick, hearty breakfast for our household that's out the door before 7am!  A+

I love that this recipe is customizable. I have many ideas for ingredients. Even after reading the reviews and reducing the amount of biscuit mix in each cup, I still had spill over though.   For me, this actual recipe was just missing something for flavor. I smothered mine in salsa verde with a dab of sour cream on top.

We loved this recipe.  I plan on modifying ingredients to make a meatless version for my vegeterian son.  I made a double batch, and they were gone before the end of the week.

What a GREAT idea for freezing and popping in the microwave for quick breakfasts!!! Actually that is the basis of my 4 star rating. The recipe was not bad but did lack a little flavor to us. We are not big bread eaters, though. My 5 yr old is...he ate 4 of them!!! I used flakey biscuits and peeled them apart into two's - maybe next time I will peel three layers away to make thinner shells. I also think I will mix cream cheese in with the sausage. Pretty good little recipe though! THANKS!

Yum! I just made and sampled these - I am going to have a hard time going to sleep without another one.  I used the crescents instead of the biscuits, set my oven to 375 because my electric oven likes to burn, and only cooked them for 16mins. My crusts came out a little dark, but again, that may be due to my oven. Oh well, these are delicious and a little carbon never hurt anyone, right?  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great idea these are!  I just made them today for my kids to have tomorrow morning.  These baked up perfectly for me, however I was carefull to not overfill each muffin cup.  I also used my homemade biscuits I always make and really pushed the dough into the cups and up the sides so the dough was not so puffy.  I knew if I didn't, then they would overflow and make a mess. These are like a little omlette baked into a biscuit. How simple, and easy and really good!

Yum! We loved these! I did have some trouble with these sticking to the pan even tho I sprayed the muffin pan - next time I'll try to do better to not let the egg run over the sides of the biscuit. I used chopped canadian bacon, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, and no peppers (this time - will definitely try it next time). I used those super cheap biscuits from Walmart in the little white tubes and they were still wonderful. Thanks for a super easy, kid friendly recipe! Loved it!

Make these!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it took a lot of time. (I only had a 1/2 dozen muffin tin). I ended up making 20 of these with just a half pound of sausage and used 8 eggs. Do split the biscuits in half...I had no problem with overflow.  It is OK for the biscuits to come up only half way up the tin as long as you spray the cups.  I layered the cheese on the sausage and had no problems with overbrowning.  These are so good!!  I guess I will have to  invest in a 12 cup muffin pan!  lol

These were so good.  My family raved about them and they are a picky bunch.  I followed recipe exactly except left out green pepper b/c i didn't have one on hand.  No problems with overflowing.   Biscuits were a little tough but I did use generic brand.  Next time I will be sure to use name brand.  Love these!

Made these this morning. I used foil muffin pans which I found VERY helpful when I wanted the buscuits to serve more as a cup. I was able to push the bottoms of the pans down further. Once done...the buscuits seemed a little too dry. Once cooled, they were delicious. My four yr old ate 3 of them and asked if I could make them every day. They are quick and versatile. Thanks for a quick, before school, breakfast!

These are super....I DID use the Grand biscuits as that is all the store had, but peeled them in 1/2 and placed them in the tins to fit...it worked out well. I love how you can add different veggies and meats to then as you go. They heat up really well, so leftovers make a super easy "on the run" breakfast. YUMMMM!

Made these Saturday morning. Very good! Lots of possibilities to use variations. I think for me, next time, I will 1/2 the biscuits for less dough and more filling.  Very good recipe. Thanks for posting!

Awesome breakfast! These little pies are so adaptable!! You can do anything you wish with this recipe. Any breakfast ingredients....  basically just like putting together an omelete, you can adjust it to your taste. Great idea. thanks for the recipe, I will be making these a lot. They are awesome to make ahead when you are planning a trip where you have to get up early and leave, just make the day before and pop them in the microwave before you walk out the door. Great to carry along in the car for the kids when time is short, but you still want them to eat a nutritious breakfast. Beats poptarts!!!

These are awesome and so easy.  I've made them twice, the 2nd time using ham and cheese.  My husband and kids devoured them.

This was a great base recipe!  I followed the recipe almost exact... I did not use the pepper, and I also added bacon, sausage, and ham.  I don't work well with dough, but it turned out ok.  I think maybe next time, I will add the cheese when it's 5 minutes from being done. When added so early, it makes a hard top crust and doesn't really taste like cheese anymore.  I think if that part of it works out better next time, it would be a 5 star!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband works 6 days straight and has to get up at an ungodly hour so I make him these so he can just throw them in the microwave and go.  They're just as quick as a bowl of cereal and keep him filled up longer!

I have made these twice now, and they are yummy. Instead of breakfast sausage, I used Italian sausage..half and half hot / mild..I used grands biscuits, rolling out with rolling pin, and lined large muffin pans with them and filled..My family doesn't like bell pepper, but they ate these and asked for the recipe. I freeze the uneaten ones, and let them thaw out or not and reheat in oven. 350 deg for 20 minutes..or until hot.  Try them with some white country gravy .Very good. I will keep some on hand for the holidays..No getting up and having to cook breakfast.in these busy days.

Very good!!  I might start making my own biscuits for these, though, rather than the premade ones - by the time I roll them out to the right size to fit in the muffin tins, I could have made a whole batch of homemade ones.

I added green peppers and garlic. As suggested, I cut the biscuits in half for the first batch and then in thirds for the second batch. They are great to freeze and microwave for the kids in the morning. It's wonderful not to have the mess.

Really good!!!  I used crescent roll dough because the stories about the biscuit dough growing out of the muffin cups had me worried.   After ten minutes at 400 the dough was getting dark brown so I reduced the temp to 350 for the last tenminutes.  They turned out great.

Super yummy, easy and convenient!  :)  Will definitely make again.  My mods were: used Pillsbury reduced fat crescent rolls to make 8 pies (using a 12-muffin tin that was sprayed with Pam), 1/3 onion diced, 1/2 red pepper diced, and 2 spicy bratwurst sausages (about 300 g of sausages...  removed casings and mashed into small chunks).  Did not need to add any salt/pepper while cooking due to flavour of sausages.  Omitted eggs and cheese to keep pies a bit healthier (fewer cholesterol/less fat) and also less messy overall.  To make pies, I split each crescent triangle into halves, placed one half into muffin tin, spooned mixture into it, then covered with remaining half of pastry.  Made 8 pies total.  Baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  They came out smelling great!  Removed from pan, placed on rack to cool, then refrigerated them all.  My fiance and I ate 2 pies (reheated at 325 for 8 minutes in toaster oven) for breakfast this morning.  They were crispy on the outside and hot on the inside.  We loved them!  Will be making lots more of these tasty pies for sure.

I was excited to try this recipe becaue I figured Hubby would like them and they could be a quick warm breakfast during the week.  We weren't impressed.  They looked great but I think I must have overcooked because they were rather dry.  We felt the taste of the biscuit overwhelmed what should have been a yummy filling.  If I decide to try this again I might try crescent rolls and maybe even add a little Velveeta cheese...

Delicious!  I used Kroger brand biscuits and tore them in half, and made 12 instead of 10.  The sausage mix got pretty cool while I prepared the muffin pan, next time I will do that first, as the egg took too long to cook through in the middle and the outsides got a little overdone.    Still, these made great breakfasts, we microwaved them for 1 minute each in the morning.  Next time I think I will try to make them a little healthier, maybe using turkey sausage and egg beaters.  My sister wants me to make these every week from now on!

Loved the versatility of this recipe!  I wanted to try making it lower in fat, so I used an apple/maple chicken sausage. It was pre-cooked, so I just peeled the casing off of 2 links, chopped them up and sauteed with onion and a tiny bit of olive oil. Ended up needing a 4th egg to make all 10 pies skipped the cheese.  My 7 year old loves them and becuase he eats 2 @ a time, i'm glad I went low fat!  Will try light biscuits and egg beaters next time!

Really sort of bland...needed some seasoning.  The texture is very spongey and I even tried pre-baking the crust to give it crisper texture.  Just wasn't what I hoped for.

whoops! I forgot the cheese but it was still awesome! I used a package of Jimmy Dean original breakfast sausage and that was enough to fill two 10 packs of buiscits. I used the "el cheapo" brand of canned biscuit dough as it isn't the kind to grow out of control. I bet the cheese is fantastic in it, next time I do this it'll be in there:)

Taste was good, but not sure worth the effort.  I don't have any picky eaters to combat with.  Husband and kids said next time just make the biscuits on the side.  The did turn out very cute!

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now!  I really like the convience.  I can make ahead and pop in the microwave and eat in the car!  I use kielbasa for the meat and omit the green pepper.  You could make with any variation of ingredients you like!

These were really good, I made them with sausage and mushrooms and omitted the onion and peppers.  My 5 year old and my husband both loved them.  You can really mix and match ingredients to your taste.  My husband said I should make them every weekend.
