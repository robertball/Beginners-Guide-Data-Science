This recipes comes out a lot sweeter than what you would get in a restaurant. I probably added about 2X as much mayo.

Might as well eliminate the dill and mayo and just dip in honey cause that is all you taste.  It was waaay to sweet.

I did not care for this recipe. I ended up using a whole cup of Mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of honey 1 1/2 tablespoons of dill. Still too sweet! I ended up adding about 1/8 cup mustard and it made it so much better!

I don't get why this recipe got such negative reviews. My family loved this! I didn't measure any of the ingredients, but I used way less honey than called for. Wasn't too sweet at all! If you find it too sweet, add more mayo. It's a fool proof recipe! I even made this slightly healthier by using fat-free mayo. I served this with fish sticks, and this sauce is so much better than tartar sauce, which my family is not fond of. My hubby is the only tartar sauce fan in the family and even he is now a convert! I've already made this 3 times, and now I also add in some lemon pepper seasoning to mine and hubby's sauce, the kids like it without. Thank you for the recipe!

Made this recipe exactly as recipe stated. I will not be making this again. All I could taste was honey. I added almost double the amount of dried dill, amd probably tripled the amount of mayo and all I could taste was the honey. NOT GOOD

There must have been a misprint on this recipe.  I made it exactly as posted but it was unbelievably sweet with almost no mayo taste at all.  I took about a quarter of the sauce, mixed in another 1/2 cup of mayo and even then no one took seconds.  I would have added more mayo but I used everything I had.  I will not be making this again!

Made this for my husband as he enjoys a sweeter sauce.. Double the dill he said. 
So that's what I did.. And added a pinch of salt.
