if i can do it, it's easy! and it was delicious! my boyfriend ate 3 slices! it's worth the calories but reduced fat cheese and tortillas may help if that is a concern.

This was a neat idea and very quick and easy too. All 4 of my kids ate it without complaint - some even had seconds. Since I didn't have a pizza pan I used a glass 9x13 (reduced oven to 375). I also spread some refried beans between layers of tortillas, used less tomatoes (kids don't like them) and used a bit more cheese. I didn't have any olives but I wished that I did because my only complaint was that it wasn't very flavorful. But that was probably why the kids liked it - not too spicy. I put some sour cream on top though and it was just fine. I'll keep this one for those nights when I'm pressed for time and have an empty pantry!
