My family loved the apple and onion gravy.  It has a very good full flavor.  I used chicken gravey instead of pork gravey.  Wonderful!

I already had pork made up and used a homemade pork gravy instead of canned in this recipe. But I really really enjoyed this gravy and would make it again and again!

I made this yesterday but I made my own gravy and added a tad of cooking marsala wine to the gravy.  It is very good.  Now I need an idea for the leftovers :-)  Thanks for sharing this with us.

Very simple meal. A little plain, but overall good. Used a Fuji apple.

family loved this.  It's pretty salty (and I love salt. . ) so next time I will use lemon juice and add my own salt/pepper (instead of using the lemon pepper seasoning), and I will try to find low-sodium pork (or beef) gray.  It was very yummy though - goes great with mash potatoes!

I roasted the onions in the pan with the pork roast. I made the gravy from scratch. I cooked down the apple then added the chopped roasted onions to the gravy. Yummy.
