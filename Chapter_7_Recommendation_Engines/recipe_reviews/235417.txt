I actually made this to liven up some leftover turkey I had for dinner. I knew that it wouldn't really be a match for what I had but I needed it for something later on in the week. I did use a cabernet sauvignon rather than merlot though I doubt it made a lot of difference in the recipe. I used my immersion blender to mix it and as you can see from my photo it left it a little chunky---just like I like it! This sauce gives a rich deep flavor that I really think I would like on pasta with some Parmesan added to it. Thanks Lora for giving me ideas of what to do with extra pancetta when I have it on hand.

I doubled the recipe and made it exactly as instructed but was not able to serve it. The tomato paste was far too strong and the spices did not go together well. I think if I had cut the tomato paste down to just a few tablespoons and left out the curry it would have turned out better. As it was the curry was overpowering and did not complement the Herbs de Provence. I ended up throwing away a pound of Pancetta and some great wine. Very disappointed about that.... it was awesome Pancetta. We served our pulled pork without any sauce thank goodness it was super moist and flavorful.... since it was for a large party. Lesson learned... try the recipe in a small batch at least a week before the party.:(
