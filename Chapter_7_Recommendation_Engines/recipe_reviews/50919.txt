When I looked at this recipe, the first thing I thought was "this needs a cornbread topping". It seemed like it would give more flavor and would resemble a chili corn dog. So, I used a small cornbread mix for the topping (I used Jiffy). The results were great. I recommend doing it that way. It was also easier and quicker. I made it in a 9x9" square baking dish and used Hormel chili. Very good.

I made tator tots to go with this and figured next time I will top with tator tots instead of bisquick.  I cooked it at a higher temp because I was baking with tots and it still worked fine.  Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe.

In response to the note about the fat content...I changed this recipe to a lower fat recipe by using skim cheese and by using turkey hot dogs and turkey chili...soy products could also be used...it turned out great and cut the fat down a ton!

I have made this recipe for my children a few times and I REALIZE that it doesn't have the best nutritional values. Kids are kids, and if they want a chili dog, than who are we (as adults) to say "OMG no you can't, it has way too much fat".  I mean really, a healthy active child will have no problem burning this off.  I agree w/ DREGINEK we aren't being "lazy" giving our kids a treat now & then.  Thanks for a good, fattening "TREAT" Judi!

The kids enjoyed this & loved the fact that it was way easier to eat than a chili cheese dog.  I cut the dough recipe in 1/2, and it wasnt too "doughy".  I do see how it would have been undercooked if I had not done that.  Don't forget the chopped onions on top!  Thanks Judi!

I had some of my chili left over from a previous night and needed a new recipe to use the left overs.  This is indeed simple, and delicious.  I didn't have any bisquick so I used the "Easy Biscuit Mixture" recipe off this site.  A nice change-Thanks Judi

I made this a bit differently.  I layered crescent rolls on both the bottom(baked for about 10 minutes before layering the rest of ingredients) and top for more of a pot pie effect, which also turned out piggies-in-blankets-ish.  I added 1/2 of a yellow onion to the chili, and a tad more cheese as well.  Everyone loved it!  Will definately make again!

I have made this recipe on a few occassions when I have my own leftover, homemade chili. I don't use nearly as much biscuit dough (1/2 the amt) and I have to bake it for the full 25 min.  In fact, MC_MA_OF_3 could have practically written my review on its taste, ease, dough content & onion addition (Go Girl:)). It's a good recipe (although Not gourmet). And as the reviewer before me reminded us all, a meal such as this can easily be countered with good excercise and a healthy lifestyle in general. So unless your following a strict dietary regime, this recipe still makes for a relatively good & quick lunch or dinner.  However, I have found that kids seem to enjoy it a little more than the adults (I'm assuming due to their less mature taste buds). Happy Cooking!

We didn't care for this at all.  The crust was tasteless and took forever to cook.  In fact, I am not even sure it ever really did in the middle.  I won't make again.

I am wondering how corn bread would taste instead - so I'll look forward to trying it w/o the hot dogs and w/corn bread...
thank you for what sounds like a pretty kid friendly idea.

We make a recipe very similar to this.  We mix the chili & sliced hot dogs with dice tomatoes & catsup.  We put the hot dog mixture in a baker, layer with real american cheese slices and then pour the cornbread dough on top (we use two boxes of cornbread mix for the cornbread dough).  The layer of cheese slices keeps the cornbread from staying doughy.  It only took 20 mins for ours to bake.  Ooooo Yummy!

The taste was good.  I would maybe make it in a bigger dish, so the ingredients get spread out a little more.  As is, there almost seemed like there was "too much" of everything!  Maybe even cut down on the hot dogs, too.  It might help if the ingredients were layered a couple of times, but with the same amounts.  BTW, I discovered that two 15 oz. cans of chili (without beans - my husbands hates 'em!) will equal the 3 cups of chili, in case you don't have any left over!

The only good thing abt this recipe is the chilli and cheese.  The rolls didn't cook and came out doughy.  Wont be making this again.

I used low fat homemade chili - but then fattened it up with cheese and hot dogs.  Was liked by all my boys!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover chili and I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of chili or hotdogs but this was delicious.  I'll definitely use this recipe again the next time I have chili to use up. :)

I made this out of leftover vegetarian chili.  Didn't have any baking mix on hand, so I topped it with refrigerated crescent rolls.  The husband claims that it deserves 5 stars.  Will try with baking mix next time.  Thanks!! :-)

I tried this tonight and it was wonderful. My wife and my 6 yr. old grandson loved it. Like everyone else, I made a few changes. I added about 1/2 of a chopped onion and used the Jiffy cornbread as suggested by another reviewer. After dinner, I then sent this recipe to everyone on my e-mail list. Thanks for the quick and wonderful recipe.

Everyone liked this meal and it is so easy to make. I cooked the sliced hot dogs for a while before adding in the cans of chili and stirred in the cheese before topping with cornbread. I used a can of Hormel Turkey Chili (which I highly recommend, it greatly reduces the fat content w/o decreasing the flavor) and one can of pinto beans. Will definately be making this again!

My whole family loved this recipe--my husband, my teenagers, my toddler, and everyone in between.  I used homemade chili, turkey dogs, and jack cheese so I wouldn't feel so guilty.  To add a little something more to it for the older kids and adults, I topped each serving with a dollop of nonfat plain yogurt, some green onions, and a dash or two of hot sauce. The younger ones ate it as is from the oven. I used a homemade biscuit mix and halved it as recommended by other reviewers, but I thought it ended up a little skimpy.  I think reducing it about 1/4 would have been better.  This will definitely be a regular on our menu!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Not only did it have a mild and boring flavor but some of the lower layers of the baking mix did not cook through.  Someone else might feel differently but after eating a spoonful of warm dough this deserves a thumbs down from me!

I took Kaye Lynn's advise about using Jiffy Mix. It was a good touch. I also used diced tomatoes w/chilli seasoning by mixing them with the second layer of chilli. It was okay. I would probably use frito chips next time. If you use tomatoes, make sure you drain them well before adding them. The con is that after 25 minutes I moved the dish to the top shelf of the oven and turned it up to 400 then 425. Total cook time was 35 minutes.

This is a great recipe for leftover chili!  I topped it with cornbread, however, since my family likes it better with chili, but it was gobbled up quickly tonight! I think I'll print this recipe out and paste it to the back of my chili recipe.  The addition of hotdogs was something my children loved.

We really did enjoy this dish! I respect the fact that there is always the option to make the meal as mild or spicy as I wish. The individual amounts of the ingredients were accurate; however, it's possible that some people would choose to use more chili or cheese to fit their tastes. The first time I cooked it, I made the original 4 serving amount. The second time, I used 6 hot dogs and added 3/4 can of light kidney beans because I was serving a family of six. While approximately 5 minutes additional cooking time was needed to brown the crust, it was well worth the wait. Thank you, Judi S.! This is a keeper!

This was very good.  I baked a frozen (thawed) pie shell for 8 mins on 400, scooped in the chili mix as recommended, and topped it with a second (thawed) fozen pie shell.  Cooked it at the called for temp. until the top crust was done.  Super easy.

This was just okay.  I made this for a potluck and didn't adjust the cooking time at all.  To my horror, the middle was still doughy when people were scooping it on to their plates!  It definitely needed to be baked for longer than the recipe called for.  The ingredients tasted okay, but it wasn't spectacular.  I won't make this again!

This was quick and easy.  I did cut back on the baking mix a bit like others suggested.  My kids and hubby all liked it.  No leftovers.

I added a can of diced tomatoes with green Chile’s & a packet of Chilli seasoning mix. I added Portuguese Sausage too. I used flaky biscuits split in half instead of the bisqujck. Turned out yummy.

This was good. I would recommend doubling the hot dogs. The crust did not cook completely in 25 minutes and needed more flavor. I like the idea one reviewer had of using cornbread. I'll use that the next time.

My boys loved it. We had no leftovers.

I make a similar one but I put the biscuit dough on the bottom of a greased casserole dish, cut up the hotdogs then add chili and chopped onion, mix that all together then squirt some ketchup and mustard over top of that. Then I put shredded cheddar on top and cook until biscuit bottom is done and cheese is bubbly.

This reminded me of the chili cheese dogs I would get at the A&W! So easy and the leftovers tasted just as good. I sliced the dogs in small rounds instead of length wise and used a tube of southern style biscuits that I gently rolled out to cover the top of the casserole dish. A great way to use your leftover chili.

People, people. This is not a recipe. This is four types of processed food product mixed with water and heated up. This type of thing is why so many of our beautiful people are fat and unwell. Eat this if you want, enjoy it if you can, but please preserve the integrity of the word "recipe" by not applying it to this concoction. You may get angry, but you know I'm right.  Peace and love. Hood.

This is great! We definitely use cornbread instead of biscuit mix. I also have to cook it for about 50 min to get the bread cooked all the way through. But it's totally worth it.

Not bad, but not sure I'd make this again.  This is definitely a quick dinner meal to use up what you have in the cupboard.  I used a can of grands type biscuits instead of the bisquick mix since I had them in the fridge and I did have to bake an extra 10-15 minutes for them to be done.  For some reason I thought this would make more than it did; I was pleasantly surprised at that.  We had this with salad and it was a quick weeknight meal.  You could easily change this up, I'm sure:  use homemade chili, garlic, onion, the little smokies instead of hot dogs, and whatever topping floats your boat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by this. I am cleaning out my pantry and found a can of chili that I had no idea what to do with until I found this recipe. I halved the recipe, and used a 5x9 loaf pan. I used the can of chili, 3 hotdogs, and a small can of refrigerator biscuits. My picky two year old actually ate this! I'll make it again, but I plan to use my chili next time rather than canned chili. Thanks for a quick and easy meal!

Used 2 large cans chili and 1 canister of whomp biscuits on the top instead of drop biscuits. Acceptable for a quick clean out the fridge/cupboard dinner at the last minute but not something I would make again.

I really liked this. But, you have to cook it 45 minutes to get it done in the center. This was great though and very easy.

Made this for a quick dinner last night. Used low fat turkey chili, sharp shredded cheddar and regular beef hot dogs.  Filling was tasty but we absolutely did not enjoy the "bisquick" topping.  Despite my attempts to doctor the dough with cheese and spices- it simply was not the right way to go.  Since my family enjoyed the chili, cheese and hot dogs, I am going to try this same recipe with Pillsbury Crescent dough rolled and placed atop instead.

This was all right.  I made it fairly close to as written except I only used one can of chili which is probably two cups.  Had I used three it would have been way too runny.  Anyway, three stars because it's not very complex and the dough was not done in the middle.  Still, the kids loved it and I actually liked the taste as well.

I decided to make cut out biscuits from homemade biscuit dough and place these on top of the chili-dog mixture.  This turned out very nicely, the dough was cooked within the stated time.  My chili did turn out a little soupy.  However, my children and husband absolutely loved this recipe!  I will try it with a cornbread topping next time.

I loved this, and so did my company!  I changed a few things, however.  I tried cornbread mix on top (great suggestion), and also browned the sliced hot dogs before mixing them with the chili.  Served with veggies and dip.  Casual and delicious. WILL make again!

Very good!  Everyone liked it...it tasted a little like those hot pocket things, with the cheese.  Yum.

This was good but not five star rated. Not too “hot dog”-ish. More doughy. I will not make this again.

I enjoyed this recipe. The dough on top made it really a pot pie with a crust. Adding some ketchup and mustard after it was done made the perfect chilli cheese dog flavor. Next time I make it I'm trying the cornbread topping and adding onions.

Canned chili is a bad idea, if I ever make this again I would use leftover homemade chili.

great recipe and super easy! Would only suggest heating the casserole for 10 minutes or so before putting on rolls or cornbread topping.

This is a really good way to dress up leftover chili.  I did everything according to the recipe except I used tater tots for the topping and baked it @ 400° F for about 30 minutes.  It is quite good and I'll make it again with my leftover chili.  Thanks for the idea.

I also used the Jiffy corn muffin mix. We really like it. Thinking about making ut again in a couple of months and adding "Coney" style toppings like onion, sauerkraut, relish, etc.

I made this for "Friday Game Night", and everyone loved it (youngest "kid" was 29)! I think I'll try it with the cornbread topping, next time.

I wasn’t thrilled with the finished product!  It sounded great but didn’t cook up as I thought it would. 
I might try again and will be very choosy with my ingredients!!

Loved this!!!  Followed one reviewer’s advice and used a 9x9 pan. Followed the recipe, but added some onion. For the top, used half a can of crescent rolls straight from the can.  Fit perfectly and soooooo easy.  Next time, going to use chili favored lintils (Tasty Bite brand) and turkey dogs.  Maybe a Mexican version??

This is a really good recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  First, I boiled hotdogs and set the water aside.  Nothing says summer like a tall refreshing glass of cold hotdog water.

This is pretty good. I tend to cook more on the healthy side so the amount of fat in it freaked me out but we have to cheat sometime right? My kids absolutely loved it. They gave it a 5...naturally. :)  Thanks, neat recipe. Good one to involve the kids in making which is always fun.

I used a cornbread topping instead of the Bisquick.  I also threw in some onions.  This was a BIG HIT with the family, they actually came to me and told me to save this recipe!!  They loved it!

The topping never came out right, but the chili, dogs and cheese were done(although they don't take that long anyway). I would have rather saved some chili and just had chili, cheese dogs. It wasn't our favorite, but it was quick and easy. I probably won't make it again.

My brother was having a birthday (11 yrs) and he is a very picky eater but loves chili dogs.  I found this recipe that I found easy to prepare and double for the family that had gathered.  And best of all the "picky" birthday boy loved it.  Thanks!
