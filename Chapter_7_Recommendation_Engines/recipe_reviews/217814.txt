I actually did make this cake because of a bet. I want to go to school to be a pastry chef and my friends all bet that i couldn't make a ketchup cake, so i did. This is just like a spice cake with a cream cheese frosting. Its very good.

Definitely a different cake! I didn't add red food coloring, or ice it, and it tasted strangely like pumpkin pie! Even the texture (when warm) was just like that of pumpkin pie! I will make this cake again, but as an imitation pumpkin pie and not necessarily as a ketchup cake :)

My husband has always been a fiend for ketchup, so as a joke, I tried this cake for his birthday. I made a layer cake with the cream cheese icing recommended. First time in my life I made a cake from scratch. It was terrific and very easy. Very, very moist. Similar in texture to a carrot cake, tastes like a spice cake. Might actually put in more spice next time.

It was incredibly shocking! My family and guests thought that a red velvet cake had been made. When they bit into it, they noticed a slightly different taste. The taste was very pleasant and really surprised them. When I told them what it was, no one believed me - had to show a copy of the recipe. I stuck with the recipe, but saved time by purchasing cream cheese icing. Will be making again.

When I first set my eyes on this cake It looked inedible because it was soooo red.  But once I got the nerve to try it... IT WAS AMAZING! It tasted exactly like carrot cake but better.

Made this recipe this past weekend. Definitely a flavor you would not expect. Well worth the try. I even have some to people around the neighborhood to taste and you should see their reaction.

I made these into cupcakes, and I was actually impressed with the results.  The brown sugar carmelized a little on the edges of the cupcakes.  I didn't make the frosting as I wanted to taste the cake without it.  
The taste was like a mild spice cake, and I couldn't taste the ketchup.  I could smell the vinegar when I started baking it, but the aroma dissipated through baking.

Fantastic recipe and great taste. Third time I used hot chocolate instead of frosting and it turned out great :)
