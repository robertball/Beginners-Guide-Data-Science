MAKE IT A 5 STAR RECIPE WITH THESE TIPS!! (I made this by the recipe before, & it was too bland!)
Ok -- didn't boil the chicken, I cooked on stove with 1/2tsp paprika.  Then, make it with cream of chicken &cream of mushroom.  OMIT THE MAYO! Put 3/4 milk in instead!  Mix soup w/1 minced garlic clove, 1/8 tsp onion powder, a tiny pinch of ginger - you don't want too much, cause it's potent, & 1/8 tsp italian seasoning.  And then, skip layering everything!  Just stir it all in the bowl that you stirred the soup in, it's a lot easier!...But put the cheese on top.  & just a note -- I didn't have stuffing mix, so I just crumbled corn flakes on top, then sprinkled italian style breadcrumbs! That'll make it a 5-star recipe for ya!

I've made the recipe twice in the past week....

The first time I added some of the ingredients suggested in the reviews: I used an extra can of soup, subbed 1/2 can of milk for the mayo, added an extra cup of cheese so that one was mixed in the casserole while the other cup topped it, and I cooked the chicken in chicken broth seasoned with chicken seasoning.  I also used a whole box of stuffing mix and cooked it before topping it on the casserole and added sauteed mushrooms in the mix.  It was good but needed some tweaking

The second time around was a hit.  My boyfriend said he liked it better than the first and my sorority sisters inhaled the dish at our potluck last night.  One sister told me it was the best casserole she'd ever had and another has already asked for the recipe...the trick is instead of topping the casserole with the cheese and stuffing, mix it ALL together.  Then I topped the whole thing with bread crumbs.  It was so much better than with the stuffing on top.  Oh yeah...and I added yet ANOTHER cup of cheese.  Needless to say, no more tweaking is necessary.  

Awesome, and thanks so much!

OK...I made this tonight for the first time and had to hightail it to the computer to give it a rating because it was SO fantastic!  I took a little advice from other users to make it better.  I used approximately 1/2 of a leftover roasted chicken, 1 bag of mixed frozen broccoli, cauliflour, & carrots(instead of just broccoli), 2 cans cream/chicken soup(in place of 1 can cream/mush), 3/4 cup milk (in place of mayo), and 1 cup bread crumbs mixed w/2 Tbls. melted butter for the topping (instead of stuffing).  I also added 1/2 tsp. chopped garlic, 1/8 tsp. onion powder, 1/8 tsp. Italian seasoning, and 3 shakes of cumin to the soup/cheese mixture.  Everyone in the house raved about this dish!  It fed one hungry husband, two hungry teenage boys, and 1 hungry mom...with a little left over for lunch tomorrow. :)  
This recipe is a keeper!  
Bon Appetite!

With modifications, this casserole does not disappoint the taste buds . I boiled the chicken with a can of chicken broth, 1/2 a can of cream of chicken soup, and a little bit of water. I also added some chopped garlic, salt, and pepper to the boiling water. Once boiled, I cut the chicken into cubes. I then combined the boiled mixture with the mayo, the cream of mushroom soup, and mixed in the cubed chicken. I also mixed in the broccoli. I followed the recipe from that point.  Others have posted that the chicken was bland and dry but if done this way, you'll have great results.

I made this tonight and was pleased with it.  Even my SUPER picky 5 yr. old cleaned his plate!!!  My husband who usually HATES casseroles liked it as well.  This is what I did:  I used 2 cans cream of chicken instead of 1 cream of mushroom, I used half a can of milk instead of mayo, I used chopped broccoli (comes frozen), and I cooked the stuffing mix before placing it on the casserole.  I also mixed the soup, milk, chicken and broccoli before placing in casserole dish.  I covered it with the cheese and then the cooked stuffing.  It was good this way, but i will make some changes...I will use more cheese (maybe 2 cups), 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and use 2 boxes of stuffing mix instead of one.  My 5 year old said he wanted more of the bread and i agreed.  Oh, I boiled the chicken in chicken broth with a bay leaf.  This is a good, quick meal.  I am making a meal for a woman at my church next week and I will use this recipe.

We really enjoyed the recipe.  I did make a few changes... I added an extra can of soup... and additional cheese (we love cheese) 2 cups...cut broccoli into smaller pieces...used ritz crackers in place of stuffing... and added seasoning to the top before using melted butter to seal in the flavor (1/2 stick)... oh and a layer of rice to the bottom for a full meal deal.  I also mixed all the main ingredients together before layering it over the rice and topping with ritz, garlic salt,powder and pepper.  A definate do-over in our house.  Good Luck to you!

This is a great base for a broccoli casserole. I did several things different. First thing I did was boil chicken broth, water, chicken cube and two crushed garlic cloves to a boil. I added about six frozen chicken strips to the water and boiled for 10 minutes. While that was cooking I sauteed half a onion and about 4 cloves of garlic in evoo, then added one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of broccoli to the onions an garlic and reduced to low. when the chicken was done, i scooped it out and placed it on paper towles to drain. Then added a bag or frozen broccoli,califlower/carrot mix to the chicken stock and boiled for a few minutes. I shredded the chicken added it to the cream of chicken mixture along with the drained veggies. mixed it all up then put it in the baking pan with the cheese topping and crackers. OMG! SOOOO GOOD!! Thanks for this, I've never made casserole before and this was just the perfect recipie to get me going!!!

5 stars.  I find it annoying when people change nearly the ENTIRE recipe when reviewing it.  Rude.  Delicious as is.

Delicious with a few 'tweaks'. I don't add the mayo, but I do add a bit of milk to the soup to make a nice casserole sauce. I also do not boil my chicken. I like the flavor and texture of either baked or grilled chicken much better. Also, I just mix everything except the stuffing mix in a large bowl then place in a casserole dish that's been sprayed with cooking spray, then add the stuffing mix on top. Yum!!
And may I address the reviewer who criticized those of us who tweak then rate a recipe? This is the part that helps me the most when reading reviews - those who have taken the original recipe and made changes that steps it up a notch. And if I read reviews on a recipe that have almost no one making changes in their review, I know the original is about perfect as is. It helps, not hurts to see these things in the review section! :-)

This was great!  But, I did a few things different: I added a can of cream of chicken, 1/4 tsp of pepper and garlic powder, and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I used the stuffing mix out of the bag and dotted with butter.  It was sooo good!  This is definetely a keeper!

I made this last night even though it is not a "summer dish", but my husband loves casseroles.  He loved it!!!  I made some changes due to other reviewer's suggestions.  I used a can of cream of chicken soup + a can of low fat broccoli cheese (its true.....one can of soup would definately have turned out too dry....use two!) and substitued half a can of milk for the mayo.  I also prepared the stuffing and then topped it.  It turned out perfect!!  The flavors were wonderfully soothing, and the stuffing on top was neither too dry nor too moist, just right. My husband says he "felt healthy" b/c he was actually enjoying a dish with vegetables!  Definately a keeper recipe.

* sautee the chicken chunks
* 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup cheddar cheeses
* sprinkle with garlic powder and lowry's seasoning salt

I gave it a five star, it is in the oven right now, I might review later but I wanted to chime in with Linn who also lives in Seattle :)
I am sick of everyone changing recipes and adding this and that and saying a recipe would be better if they did this or that.  PLEASE stop and write your own and just rate the recipe!  It is distracting and annoying and I think it is rude as well.  Hate to be a crank but when I read the other review and just had to agree because this issue has been bothering me for awhile now!

I saw the recipe pop up today on the allrecipes email and I just had to mention; I made this a couple of months ago for friends. They love casseroles and she had just come home from the hospital, so I wanted to make something easy she and the kids would enjoy. 

It turns out very nice. Just as it should.

 My tweaks just for my tastes but are not necessary. 

I poached my chicken breasts in a herb broth which just gave it a bit more flavor; but again, basically the same thing. And cutting it in cubes or shredded; it comes out the same

Make sure NOT to over cook the broccoli; but the chef did note that. 

I used the low salt soup, just because I like to season my own food. 

For the cheese I used a cheddar/montery jack blend; but again, you couldn't tell the difference. 

I did season with plenty of pepper.

 And for the stuffing mix, I used Stove Top in the Canister; the Herb Blend

One. Suggestion: I may add a small onion diced next time.

With these modifications and suggestions from other reviewers this was the best ever!  Real simple:  I used my George Foreman to prepare 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs with Olive oil, sea salt and pepper,  5 min on the grill and they were perfect.  Let them cool and then chopped to bite size pieces. Meanwhile  I steamed all the florets, about 1 lb. 10 min there.  In a bowl I mixed 1 can of Cream of Mushroom with 1 Can of Cream of chicken and 1/4c of Milk.  I threw in 2 pinches of regular salt, a few pinches of ground black pepper, two shakes of ground ginger with 1t of Garlic powder and 1/4t of Onion Powder and 1/4t of Italian seasonings.  I mixed everything together.  Sprayed a 3qt casserole with Pam and then put everything in there.  Covered with 2c of shredded cheddar.  Topped off with 1 1/2c of Herb Stuffing Mix.  OMG!  This was so delicious and just perfect.  We could not stop eating it.  It was like a dessert!  Crazy good.  Will make this again and again!!

Thanks so much for this recipe. It was delicious, delicious, delicious! I made the changes that the reviewer on the front page suggested and that made this a five star recipe in my book. I used cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, and 3/4 cup milk, added a few spices and mixed them all together in a bowl rather than layer them. My husband LOVED it and so did my PICKY, PICKY toddler! I think I love you.

For the reviewers that reprimand those that feel many are unfair to the original poster, a few changes are fine, even welcomed in small doses, however, when they give a negative review plus, pile on all of their personal modifications, it longer is the original writers recipe! They need to post and review their own! The originator is getting saddled with negative posts on a recipe that no longer resembles anything they wrote.....I found this recipe delicious, I had it several years ago and misplaced it; I came to all recipes to locate it once again!! : )

I have been making a variation of this for years and it is one of my family's favorites.  While I don't have an exact recipe as I eyeball everything, basically I bone a roast chicken from the grocery store and cut it up into bite-sized pieces.  Mix together 1 can cream of chicken soup, about 10 oz. sour cream and almost 2 cups of grated mexican blend cheese.   I also use uncooked fresh broccoli and mushrooms.  Mix it all together and top with a cooked package of stuffing mix - savory herbs is my favorite.    I have also added carrots/cauliflower on occassion.   Just pop in the oven and bake for 30-45 min. until bubbly and hot.   A complete meal, creamy and delicious!

For a casserole, and I am not a huge fan of casseroles, this is delicious! I've made this twice already using left over chicken. I made some adjustments such as, did not cook the broccoli, used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken, half a can of milk, one box of chicken flavored stove top stuffing, mixed all the ingredients then put into the casserole dish and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. This is a monthly weeday meal.

This was good, but just didn't have enough spice for my family.  Would make again but add some other spices to it.

I wish I'd seen the suggestion about preparing the stuffing (Stove-top) according to the box before I made this last night. It was good, but the stuffing came out a little too crunchy and dry for us.

This is good but try layering cooked brocoli on the bottom of the dish. Add shredded chicken. Then a sauce of mayonaise, cream of chicken soup, lemon juice and some curry. Then finish with cheddar cheese topped with Italian bread crumbs and some dollops of butter. The family loves it.

I used two cans of soup (cream of mushroom w/garlic, broccoli cheese) and 1/2 cup of milk instead of adding mayo. I also prepared the stuffing first and used a few bread crumbs on the top for a crunch.  Everyone liked it that way and asked for the recipe. I also used canned chicken to save time.  Thanks!

This is a terrific casserole! To address the dryness problem: Use the stuffing mix that comes in a bag, not a box. Crumble well before adding to top of casserole. Dot with butter or margarine before baking. This gives the topping a nice crunch! I also use margarine to lightly grease the casserole dish before layering. Squeeze- bottle margarine is great for this recipe!

I make this all the time and its my families favorite meal.  Thought I would share: I do not put bread crumbs but use the small biscuits (cut in half) and layer round side up with a little space in between each biscuit for better cooking of the buscuits.  I also brush the tops of the biscuits with butter.

Slice breasts and cook in frying pan with Vegetable oil spray.  This allows the chicken to pick up some flavor and have renderings rather than be boiled. Use crumbled Ritz crackers rather than stuffing.  The difference is mind-blowing for flavor.  Also as may reviewers have said, mix everything together rather than layering.  You will have a hit!

Pretty good but a little dry.  I do recommend doing what others suggest and add a little milk.

This recipe as written did not work for us.  I will never boil chicken for a recipe again.  I tried it because it was easier than my normal method of preparing chicken for a casserole.  I will continue to pan fry my chicken in a little butter with minced garlic and a couple of tablespoons of white wine  along with seasoning the chicken to my taste which is usually Cavender's Greek seasoning.

YUMMY!  Made this tonight and was thoroughly impressed as was my husband.  I mixed together one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken and 3/4 can of milk and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and curry powder.  I sauteed the chicken with chopped onions, mushrooms, frozen broccoli florets and garlic in a skillet with olive oil, salt and pepper, oregano and basil.  I cooked the Stove Top according to the box instructions.  Then I mixed everything in a large bowl...soups, milk, chicken mixture, cheese, and stuffing.  I sprinkled panko breadcrumbs and more cheese on top.  It was a warm and comforting meal that I will make again and again!

I used the basic principal of this recipe, but I thought it might be too dry.  I boiled the chicken in low sodium chicken broth with and onion, salt & fresh ground pepper.  When I steamed the broccoli, I also added salt and fresh ground pepper.  I used all of the broth and onions from the chicken to blend with the soup.  Served over rice.  My husband said this was Deelicious!  Now..it's a 5 star to him!

Had some friends to lunch yesterday and served this dish. I also added 2/3 cup white wine, 1/2 cup chopped waterchestnuts for texture, and 2 cups cooked elbow macaroni. It was very tasty and a couple went home with the recipe. Thanks Tracy.

We loved this recipe! The only thing that I changed was that I doubled up on everything but the chicken & I completely cooked the stuffing mix. If I hadn't taken the advice of the other reviewers, I believe it would have been very dry & skimp on the overall ingredients of this recipe. But we will definately add this to regular recipe fare!

I made this with a whole rotisserie chicken that I shredded, 97% fat free cream of chicken soup, 2% shredded sharp cheese and lowfat mayo.  I know, I know...but I layered it mid-morning, covered and refigerated it and that evening threw it in the oven!  Super easy and my picky husband, Mr. Full Fat Everything, raved about it!  High fives for this keeper!!!

I have made this easy recipe for 40 years.  I no longer use cream of mushroom soup, however, using bechamel instead.  I also add sliced almonds for texture and flavor.  I have also added carrots for color, vitamins, flavor and texture.  

Creative cooks can take this recipe and make it their own by "tweeking" it to suit their tastes.  Cooking is all about pleasing yourself, friends, and family with delicious, healthy food.  PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD !

I've been making an interesting sort of Indian style variation of this recipe for years.

I use Broccoli Cheese Soup (undiluted) instead of Cr. of 'Shroom, delete the mayo and and the stuffing.  Add 1 c. shredded sharp cheddar and 1-2 tsp of curry powder.

I throw everything in the crock pot (no pre-cooking the broccoli) so it's ready when I get home from work.  Then I add another cup of shredded cheddar on top, turn the crock down to low for 20 minutes or till the cheese melts.

I made this recipe tonight, since I had some chicken I didn't want to go to waste.
I followed everyone's suggestions and added a few extras to the sauce.  Once i had the ingredients all mixed together I started to wonder what I would serve this with.  Quick inspection of my cupboard revealed a box of lasagna noodles, so I said what the heck.
I used the mixed ingredients to make this a lasagna, and it turned out wonderful. I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites.
I made the sauce just a bit wetter and used oven ready noodles.  Cooked in the oven at 375 for about 40 minutes.
Delicious!!!

Was this a quick and easy dinner solution to a hectic day? Yes.  But did we like it?  Not really.  I used 2 cans of soup- 1 cheese/broccoli and 1 cream of mushroom, and used about 3/4 cup of milk instead of mayo. It was still on the dry side, so I can't imagine with only 1 can of soup, and I found it VERY salty.  With 2 cans of soup, the stuffing mix, and cheese the saltiness is off the charts.  We ate it 3 nights ago, but none of us have gone back for leftovers, and while I do supply my grandparents with meals during the week, I'm afraid the sodium count on this is way too high for their strict diets.

I've been making this casserole for over 20 years, but my recipe called for a can of cream of chicken soup, tablespoon (I just use a dollop of Miracle Whip) mayo, and add a tablespoon or two of milk.  After layering the broccoli, chicken, soup mix, I squish a tube of Ritz crackers into crumbs, then layer that then the cheddar cheese.  Even my picky middle child likes this recipe. I make for my friends who aren't able to cook, had a baby or surgery etc.  Always get compliments, since it is such a comfort food.  Since I am on WW now, I modify it with Fat Free Cream of Chicken soup, whole wheat Ritz crackers and low fat cheese.

This was a welcome change from the standard Campbell's recipe I grew up on, I rated it a 4 only because of all the changes I made. I boiled the chicken in chicken broth. Once cooked, I cubed and tossed with a small amount of garlic salt. I upped the stuffing mix to 1 1/2 cups, skipped the mayo and used the soup can full of milk as a sub. Also used cheddar cheese soup (not a fan of mushrooms). Like other users, I mixed everything together to avoid dryness, and topped with an extra 1/2 c. of cheese. This recipe is very versatile to change to your liking.

I am about ten hours away from home, beginning my career as a teacher. I was feeling sad tonight and thought of this recipe. The first time I made it, I was a student in Vermont at a kitchen in the Ronald McDonald House. I have made it several times for my boyfriend, and tonight, just for me.

I would recommend 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken, along with 3/4 c. milk. If you are really pressed for time, pick up an original rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, shred the meat, and add to the casserole. This way, you get both dark and white meat--it makes a difference to the overall flavor.

I would also throw in some peas, mushrooms, or even lima beans (yum) for variety. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe, but I changed it around a lot. I used the suggestion and used 3/4 cup of milk in place of the mayo. Instead of ½ can of soup, I used 1 whole can of cream of mushroom and 1 whole can of cream of chicken. turned out PERFECT. I mixed in 2/3 a block of cheddar cheese, half a bag of frozen broccoli florets (didn't have to cook it before hand and stiill turned out great) and 3 chicken breasts that I grilled and seasoned beforehand. Then I used half a box of chicken flavored dry stuffing and I mixed everything together. I sprinkled cheese and dry stuffing on top and it came out NICE. My family was begging for more. I will definitely make it again!

I, like one of the other reviewers, am hesitant to give 5 stars to a chicken casserole. However, this turned out nicely, and I have no complaints. My husband loved it. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom, and I added sour cream (1 cup) and used breadcrumbs on top as I didn't have any stuffing on hand. Thanks for a nice recipe!

This was very good comfort food, easy to make with lots of room for improvising. I followed previous reviews and added an additional can of chicken broth, an extra cup of cheese & lots of broccoli. I then mixed the soups, broccoli, chicken & cheese together and spread it over a bed of pasta and topped with the dry stuffing mix. The family loved it...even picky 4 & 12 year olds ate it up. Definitely a keeper and a great base recipe with infinite possible add-ins. Thanks Tracy.

This was excellent!  I used cooked egg noodles on bottom and changed the cream of mushroom soup to Cream of Chicken, Cream of Broccoli and Cream of Celery.  I made this for a serving of 8 and used about 2 1/2 cans of soup.  I think I should have used 3.  I also would mix everything together except for the cheese and stuffing mix.  Layering it, in my opinion, was a little dry but still yummy!  I will definitely cook this again!  My kids ate it which is impressive as they usually do not like chicken.  Oh!  I also used Cornbread Dry Stuffing Mix on top!  Yummy!!

My family loved this recipe.  Everyone was a plate cleaner.  For me, I would have liked the flavors to combine rather than being in distinct layers.  I sauteed the chicken instead of boiling it, for more flavor.  I think next time I will mix the soup (with some added milk), chicken and broccoli together, put them in the pan and go on with the rest of the instructions.  The topping was very crunchy, but I liked that.  You may want to drizzle a bit of butter on the top -- I think I will try to save those calories. This recipe is very quick and easy and, like I said, it met with my entire family's approval.

We are a family of 4 with 2 sons and everyone cleaned their plates. I boiled and shredded the chicken the night before. The next day I dumped it into my baking dish and seasoned it with various spices such as garlic salt, paprika, pepper, and salt. The only other differences in what I did was (as another reviewer suggested), add one can of cream of mushroom AND cream of chicken. I didn't have stuffing mix, so I just sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top. Oh, and I used only 3 breasts instead of 4 and it was plenty and I used frozen broccoli so no precooking was necessary. This was a great base recipe!

Made the dish exactly as stated in the recipe.  It's not fancy but it tastes good and is easy to make.  The stuffing provides most of the flavor in the dish so I don't see that it's necessary to add additional spices.  I would make this again and add a 2nd can of mushroom soup to make it saucier.

Great recipe, but after reading reviews, I tweeked it a little. I sauted cooked the chicken in olive oil after dusting with paprika. When it was almost cooked I added some slice mushrooms. I also left out the mayo, and used 2/3 cup milk, 3 T of cooking sherrie, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the sauce. Layered using low fat mozzerella, left out stuffing mix and lightly dusted with bread crumbs. Saved a few calories and still yummy!

Very good with extra cheese and a little extra liquid.  I used milk.  I used stove top for the dry stuffing mix and it was a nice touch.  I might try the cornbread stuffing next time.

This was my all-time favorite meal when I was in high school. Whenever I came home from college I'd make my mother make it. 

Differences now? My mom used frozen broccoli. I buy my broccoli fresh and blanche it then shock it before using it in this dish. I sauteed my chicken instead of boiling it. That was a mistake. I recommend boiling the chicken because it will be more tender.

I added a can of cream of chicken soup (because my 1 lb. of blanched broccoli had much more volume than frozen), and the 4 chicken breasts I used were huge. Because we like our casseroles a little creamier, I added 1/2 a can or about 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce mixture.

Because there was canned mushroom soup in this recipe I added about 1 TBS rubbed dalmation sage and 1/4tsp cayenne pepper because these two seasonings really make canned mushroom soup more fancy and palatable.

Last tip - Use Pepperidge farm stuffing for the topper. double it to 2 cuos, and drizzle one stick of melted butter over the top before baking. 

My bake time was 45 minutes instead of 30. Even then, it could probably have used an hour.

One of my favorite recipes. I usually use crushed cheez-its instead of stuffing mix though. This recipe is also tasty if you add a dash of curry to the mixture.

So, I woke up this morning wanting to make a chicken casserole for the first time (I cook all kinds of stuff, but not this), and I am so stoked. It is still in the oven waiting for my boyfriend, but I tried it, and it's great. I made changes (it's not my own unless I alter it). Cooked penne pasta, steamed broccoli, sauteed chicken, I mixed 1 cream of mushroom, and 1 cream of chicken soup and mixed it with a cup of half and half. Topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, and herb flavored stuffing, and I poured a tablespoon of melted butter to crisp the breading. 350 degrees for 35 minutes=YUM

This was easy and tasty!  If your using frozen broccoli make sure to soften it first....i had to keep my dish in the oven way longer to get the broccoli soft and the breadcrumb mix to brown..otherwise very good.

A sensational hit at our house. I took others' suggestions and used an extra can of cream of chicken soup, I cooked the chicken on the stove and added two cloves of garlic, 1 tsp each of garlic salt, onion powder, minced dried onion, and italian seasonings. I also subbed the mayo for milk. I cooked the stuffing ahead of time and I stirred everything together saving half of the stuffing to sprinkle on top. If I were to change anything next time, I would use a second box of stove top stuffing. One inside the casserole and the second to top it off. Adding this to my meal rotation!

It was an easy recipe. The best part was the stuffing on top, but other than that it was rather bland. I will make it again, but I'll definitely be making some changes.

Made it twice, definitely sub the mayo with 3/4 cup of milk, and I used on can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken,(I definitely suggest adding one more can of soup or its gonna be dry) the second time I didn't cook my broccoli first because I don't like my broccoli soggy and it was very good, made it more of a summer recipe with the crisp broccoli.  My hubby and Daughter loved it!

This was dry dry dry.  The flavor was very good, but dry.  Very homey/comfort food.  I will make this again, but I will add another can of mushroom soup and maybe some milk or broth.  You should try it, though, it tastes good...just think about adding another can of soup or broth or something.  *** UPDATE *** The next day, I put a can of chicken broth over it and it moistened it up pretty good.  I will definitely add an extra can of soup the next time.  With the addition of the chicken broth, this goes up to 4 stars.

A couple of days ago I realized I had some frozen chicken breast so I began looking for a chicken casserole recipe. I came across this one and used it as my base. I added broccoli and cheese flavored rice, a can of cream of celery soup, and sauted onions, celery and garlic. I sent it to an office party with my husband and he brought back an empty dish.  My husband and best friend told me it was the best they had ever tasted. While I agree it was good, I really think the garlic made this dish. With the additions, I will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe!

Once again, the Allrecipes reviewers gave me an excellent meal! I followed a mix of suggestions from all of you.
1. I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and seasonings to taste. 
2. I added 3/4 cup milk, 1 heaping tbsp sour cream and a little extra cheese.
3. I used Italian breadcrumbs on top instead of stuffing mix.
4. I poured 2/3 cup of the chicken broth on top after it came out of the oven so the top would be moist. 
This was soooo delicious and fairly simple to prepare!

Turned out great, wonderful comfort food.  I read some of the reviews regarding it being too dry...so I made some adjustments.  First I boiled the chicken in a bit of broth and seasonings.  Then I used about 1/4 cup of the remaining broth and 1/4 milk and added it to the soup mix, it was perfect, nice and moist but not soupy.  I also used the remaining liquid to cook some rice in which gave it a perfect flavor for a side dish.  A 5 star meal can come from anywhere!

I won't give it 5 stars because it's a chicken casserole for gods sakes!  however, after reading many of the other reviews, I came to a compromise that turned out purty darn good, or as my husband said "just what the doctor ordered."  Anyways, I boiled cubed chicken in broth for about ten minutes, covered, then I heated frozen broccoli in the microwave for about four minutes.  I seasoned the broccoli and chicken with salt and pepper.  Then i made the sauce with a can o cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, a heaping tablespoon full of mayo (light), and then mixe a cup of cheese right into that, and added pepper.  I layered the chicken, brocolli and soup mixture, and then poured croutons on and then poured the remaining broth over the top.  Sprinkled  the top generously with cheese and voila!  The casserole was not dry at all, had plenty of flavor (the roasted garlic in the soup was really good), and easy!!!!  Plus the stuffing had a nice cheesy flavor as the cheese sort of melted into it.  Yummy!

This is great and easy to make.  I used broccoli and cheese soup since I don't like mushrooms.  I used breadcrumbs on top and that worked quite well.  There were no leftovers, and my kids are picky eaters!

I used a family size cream of chicken instead, didn't have enough broccoli so I added frozen mixed veggies(thawed)to the broccoli, turned out good- next time I will definetly add alittle more seasonings(I had used garlic powder and Mrs.Dash)I took other reviewers advice and dotted butter on top of the dry dressing,I liked the little bit of crunchiness, my daughter didn't. Over all I liked this recipe and my picky family seemed to like it too.

One word --- FABULOUS! -- My husband and I loved it! I added some sauteed onions and celery to compliment the dry stuffing. 
Next time I make this, I would add either another can of cream soup (chicken or mushroom) or some chicken broth. It can be a little dry.

I used a different kind of cheese, amerinan and monteray jack mix, and I drizzled about a 1 1/2 cups of the water the chicken was boiled in over the stuffing so it wouldn't be too dry.  We loved.  There were no left overs!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did not have stuffing mix, so I crushed a sleeve of Ritz crackers and sprinkled those on top, adding dots of butter before baking.  It was delicious!

I make this every so often when I want a fast, easy meal. I omit cheese and top with buttered breadcrumbs...no need for all those extra calories. I also add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Perhaps 1 or 2 tsp. Really brightens up the flavor. And that makes it an absolutely hearty, delicious Sunday supper.
In the spring, when asparagus is less expensive, I make this casserole with bite-sized cooked asparagus. It is equally delicious and a nice thing to take to a potluck.

Very good! Next time I make this, I will mix all of the layers together, except for the cheese on the top. I used less chicken, but left everything else the same.

My Mother used to make this with leftover baked chicken. I always remembered her using sour cream. As I was following this recipe, it seemed like it would end up a bit dry, so I went w/ my instincts and added about a cup (maybe a little more) of low-fat sour cream to the sauce mixture. I also added minced garlic, green onion, and a pinch of seasoned salt. It turned out delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe with just a couple subtle alterations because I wanted a more "broccoli and cheese" feel.  

I used 2 cans (instead of 1) of cheddar cheese condensed soup (instead of cream of mushroom).  I think 1 can plus 1/2 can of milk would be fine though.  I cubed the raw chicken breasts into 3/4 inch cubes, then browned in a saute pan with seasonings (garlic, onion, and a heavy pinch of cayenne - I like a kick).  Aside from these changes, I followed the recipe.

Husband, who cringes when I say we're having broccoli, actually liked it!  I will definitely make this again.

A fantastic recipe! After reviewing others comments I omitted the mayo and added in condensed milk. We also love onions and garlic so I fried up both in olive oil until tender and added it to the mixture. Although I mixed the cheese in with the other ingredients, I did put a layer on the top of the casserole before finishing with the crumb mixture. I substitued a bread crumb topping instead of stuffing. This was a mixture of Italian bread crumb seasoning and regular bread crumbs. The result was a tasty, cheesy casserole. I will be making this again. Great to take to a potluck.

I agree with all the other people who gave their reviews of this recipe.  If you add other ingredients to this, and make it differently than the directions suggest, then it would probably be a pretty good casserole...and a different recipe.

All 3 of my kids said they liked it, yay!  That's really the ultimate goal for me.  I didn't plan this recipe ahead of time, so I just used what I had on hand.  So, I swapped frozen broccoli for fresh.  Then I also added a can of cheddar broccoli soup because it seemed like it needed more "sauce."  I also substituted sour cream w/ mayo because i didn't have any mayo on hand. I was able to whip this up ahead of time and then take my kids to sports and still have dinner ready to go afterwards....which is so great for busy parents!

The is quick and easy also very tasty. My grandmother made this for us when we were kids the only difference is leaving out the stuffing and we served it over rice.

I've been making a similar recipe for over 20 years.  Try adding 1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp. of curry powder and 1 TBS. of lemon juice to the sauce mix.  Wonderful option to spice it up so it isn't so bland.

We prefer another recipe that includes chix breasts, sage bfkst sausage, peas, stuffing, water chestnuts, onion, celery and 2 cans cream of chix or celery or mushroom soup.  This recipe was just ok and I will go back to the other one.

My family didn't love this.  I followed reviewer suggestions and used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups and omitted the mayo.  Then made the stuffing beforehand and added it on top, followed by some provolone cheese. The stuffing adds a lot of salt, so watch your seasonings!

I made this recipe tonight for my boyfriend and myself.  First, I made a few changes (being that it was only the two of us, I only used two chicken breasts and roughly half lb of broccoli-although I wish it had more).  I did not use mayo, sounds like an unhealthy addition for no reason.  I also did not use stuffing mix, I just used bread crumbs on half the casserole top.  After I boiled the chicken and cut it into chunks, I put it in the casserole dish.  I added about a teaspoon of italian dressing and mixed it with the chicken.  In a separate dish, I mixed a can of chicken soup, a half a cup of milk, a pinch of garlic powder and adobe.  I added the broccoli to the casserole and the chicken mixture and stirred.  I added some cheddar cheese (just eye balled it) and mixed it.  I then added cheese on top and then bread crumbs on half.  Ok, this recipe was really really good, BUT the half a can of milk was NOT needed.  I've never used this before when I've made this recipe and I definitely never will again.  After cooking for 40 minutes, my casserole was so soupy. :(  I had to sift out all the soupyness.  I don't know how others add a whole can to the casserole and it works, but it definitely did not to me.  I will do everything the same, just NO milk.  One can of chicken soup is enough.

Once again, with modifications this is great.  You could say this is the framework of a recipe and fill it in to your preferences.  I saute the chicken with lemon pepper on it instead of boiling.  I omit mayo.  I like it more creamy, so I add 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 cup milk, garlic powder, 2 T lemon juice and black pepper.  I also add lots more broccoli.  Sometimes I put a breadcrumb with melted butter topping, but sometimes I just do it with cheese.  I'm going to try it like a reviewer below mentioned about mixing the cheese in with everything.

Pretty good - very simple!  We sorted the reviews by most helpful & followed both Crystalyn's & JoJo's suggestions. I halved the recipe, only 2 grown-ups & 1 toddler to feed; didn't want to make a ton if it turned out not to be our bag. So 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced (cooked first on the stove on med low in a bit of olive oil w/Adobo seasoning [garlic-salt-like, can be found in the Cuban foods section of your grocer]), 1/2 a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix (thawed just a BIT and chopped), 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (this was organic [Health Valley brand], not as thick as conventional cream-of soups), milk measured to 1/4 of the empty soup can (b/c the soup we use is not as thick as most people would use), 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 cup dry stuffing mix.  I mixed it all together in a bowl & added a bit more Adobo (like garlic salt). I spread this in a square glass dish, topped it w/plain bread crumbs that I seasoned with garlic salt & baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. I think next time we will make it 2 cups of dry stuffing mix, & we might do a bit of cheese over the top (but under the breadcrumbs).  Easy supper, easy to have everything you need on hand. Thanks for the recipe & reviews!

Great recipe although I changed it some - as I'm sure we all do :) I used 3 large chicken breasts instead of 4 - I found this was still plenty for my family of 4 - we even had left overs AFTER my boys all had seconds and thirds. I added slightly less than a 1/4 cup mayo & 1/4 cup of milk. I mixed them together before adding to the casserole - didn't come out too runny at all! I steamed the broccoli along with some mushrooms before adding to the casserole. Last but not least I cooked the stuffing with slightly less water than it calls for before adding to the top. It came out great! Thanks!!

This is total comfort food, great for the winter months! I didn't follow the directions exactly... I put the stuffing and broccoli on the bottom of the pan, put the chicken on top of that and poured the mushroom soup mixed with a can of water over the whole thing. This helped the stuffing turn out moist.  My husband and I both enjoyed this a lot. Thanks!

This casserole was fantastic! But I did make several changes to it, so I cant  give it 5 stars...   First I chopped the raw chicken into bite sized cubes and sauteed them until they had a nice brown on the outside. I definitely omitted the mayo (cuz it kinda grosses me out) and the concistency was perfect. I added some diced celery to give it a little crunch and just mixed it all together in the casserole dish.  So good and so easy!

Just made this and really liked it - perfect for a cold rainy day.  I read the other advice for modifications and made the following changes: substituted 3/4 cup milk for mayo (used whole milk to keep it thick), mixed the soup and broccoli together instead of layering and put that on the bottom of the dish, placed the shredded chix on top, then a layer of cheese, cornbread stuffing, more cheese.  Many reviews indicated that you need two cans of soup; I disagree, I think 2 cans would have made it runny.  A way to keep this moist is cook for 20 mintues covered and cook the last 10 minutes uncovered.  Was very flavorful and even my toddler son loved it.  Will certainly make again.

I also modified this recipe. My husband is a chef and he loved it! I used Cream of Celery soup in place of the mushroom, no mayo but added about ½ cup of half and half. I also browned the chicken until tender in olive oil, adding salt, white pepper, garlic; removed and used same pan; added finely chopped onion, fresh sliced carrots, and celery; cooked until tender. I par cooked my fresh broccoli florets for about 1 ½ minute.  I also used minute rice in bottom of casserole using low sodium chicken stock for the liquid. Mixed the chicken, vegetables, soup and half/half and topped the rice. I then topped the entire casserole with about 1 ½ cups sharp cheddar cheese, baked for 40 minutes and used a cracker crumb topping  instead of stuffing.  I served with a tossed salad, bread sticks and vino. My husband raved!!!

A Great Recipe! As an amateur cook, I was worried it would come out a musy mess, but I went through all the reviews and I think I picked out the best tips: I boiled the chicken in chicken broth, Mixed 1 can of crm of mushroom and 1 can of crm of chicken and also 3/4 of a cup of milk instead of mayo. I mixed it all together with a cup of italian bread crumbs with 2tblsp of butter mixed into it instead of stuffing and also put 1 cup of cheese in there. I put the chicken in and mixed it all together. Once it was in the pan, I hand sprinkled more crumbs and more cheese on top until it was covered enough to look good to me. I served it over brown rice to be a little healthier and the sprinkled some paprika on top for color. It was sooo yummy and loved by everyone! Hope this helps.

This was my first casserole, and it is definitely a favorite. Following the suggestions of others, I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom. I used a frozen bag of mixed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. I mixed all of the ingredients together, then topped with the cheese and a full box of prepared stuffing. This was a large, easy, tasty meal.

Boiled the chicken in broth, garlic & minced onion. Took out the chicken & while the broth was boiling threw in the broccoli til al dente. Next time I make this I'll mix the chicken, broccoli & soup together with a bit of broth. Felt this was really dry layering it. It had clumps of the soup mix that didn't feel mixed in with anything. I had to pour a bit of the broth over the stuffing. The whole family liked it though!

I found this to be a very good recipe although like others I did add my own take on it.  I preferred baking the chicken breasts in the oven for 30 minutes rather than boiling the chicken for starters.  Secondly, I would add more cheese to the recipe and not use the dry stuffing on top.  I found it to be much too dry.  Perhaps if it was mixed with extra cheese this would make the topping less dry and also more colorful in appearance.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and chopped onion in olive oil and minced fresh garlic at the end.  This added greatly to the flavor.  A sprinkling of fresh parsley over the top just before serving added the finishing touch.  For extra zip I think I will add French's fried onions to the topping next time!

Very very good! I, like most others, tweaked it a bit. I cooked salted & peppered chicken breasts on stovetop in olive oil & garlic, cubed when cooled. Cooked frozen broccoli & chicken stovetop stuffing (reserving one cup for topping). I mixed 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, 2/3 cup milk (instead of mayo), 1 minced garlic glove, 1/8 tsp italian seasoning, chicken, stuffing, broccoli & 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese all together in a large bowl. Poured it into baking dish and sprinkled another cup of cheese over top then the reserved (uncooked) stuffing & dotted w/ butter. Soo tastey!

I made this last week and I couldn't stop saying, "Mmmm!"  I followed others suggestions as well adding a can of cream of chicken, about 1/2 cup of milk and another cup of stuffing, more cheese, and some garlic powder.  I really love Stove Top so that's why I used more.  Tip:  Get the new Steamers that are out by Green Giant I believe...took out the whole step of steaming the broccoli...just threw it in the microwave!

Here's my take on it. Like others I used 2 cans Cream of Chicken soup and 3/4 c milk. I threw all ingredients into a bowl including the cheese and some stuffing mix. For cheese I used packaged Mexican 4 cheese blend and stuffing was Stove Top which is seasoned.I added some finely chopped bermuda onion. A little paprika and freshly ground pepper was also added. Some more cheese on top followed by the rest of the stuffing mix with a drizzle of butter. Yummy!!

I used Cream of chicken condensed soup with herbs instead of Cream of mushroom and added lots of sauteed onion and garlic to the chicken breasts.  I did not make a breadcrumb or stuffing topping.  I added a little sour cream and a bit or worchestershire sauce.  I thought this was quite good over rotini pasta.  It would have been nice over rice also.  I did up the broccoli so that there were more veggies.  Next time I might add a little julienned carrot or red bell pepper for color.  It is basically a good recipe, kinda thick, so maybe a little chicken stock added would be good.

This is a very tasty dish.  I prepared it and it was awesome. My husband really, really liked it. I did some changes I sauteed an onion, a red /green pepper and a fresh tomato in a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet.  Once it was done i poured it on top of the broccoli.  The mushroom soup i mixed it with some black pepper, some Italian seasoning, mozzarella (because i did not have any other kind) and a tbsp of Parmesan cheese and put the half of the sauce on top of the broccoli and the other half of the sauce on top of the chicken, then i top the dish with a little French fries onions.  It turned out delicious!!!

Thanks for this great recipe for another special night.:-)

I followed the reviews and went with the 2 cans of soup and 2/3 cups milk. (1 Mushroom, 1 Chicken)  I went a different route with the spices.  Since I have my own garden I added fresh Oregano, Parsley, and a little rosemary.  I also added some finely chopped onions (about a 1/8 of a cup).  I added bread crumbs to the top instead of the stuffing.  (Southerners dislike the stuff!) Drizzle a little melted butter over the bread crumbs.  Great recipe!

Really good recipe. I did follow some of the other reviewers' advice. I boiled the chicken breasts in a can of roasted garlic chicken broth. Then I shredded it and mixed everything in a bowl: 1 and a half cups of Cheddar cheese, a package of stove top stuffing (uncooked), a can of broccoli cheese soup, a can of cream of chicken soup, and 3/4 cup skim milk. Then I put it in a casserole dish, and placed about 6 tiny slivers of butter on top. Lastly, I crushed up about 8-10 Ritz crackers and sprinkled them on top. I covered the dish and baked it for 35-40 minutes, and DELISH!!

This is a really good "base" recipe, but like everyone else I changed it so much it can barely be called the same recipe. Two cans of soup, half a can of milk, an extra cup of cheese, and a big scoop of sour cream. No layering, no cooking the broccoli ahead of time, and I added some mushrooms to mine. No stuffing, just used garlic bagel chips ground up in the food processor. But this was really easy when friends were coming over unexpectedly, and they ate it up!

This casserole is very good. I made just a few changes. I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with a can of milk and added the stuffing to that mix so it wouldn't be too hard. I then added Mrs Dash to the mixture because I was afraid the soup mixture would be less flavorful with the addition of the milk. This is very good and easy to make. Enjoy!

This was great. Even though I went into the pantry and relized I was out of cream soups! So I mixed a cup of sour cream with a splash of heavy cream some chicken stock and a bit of salt and it was perfect. So if you find yourself out of soup try this is was great. I am going to try it with the soup though. Quick and easy.

Great recipe. I did not layer the ingredients. Instead,  I mixed all the ingredients together, except for the stuffing. I used two cups of stuffing and mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter before putting on top. Will make again.

I loved this recipe.  I did a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  I also boiled the chicken in chicken broth, and then poured some chicken broth over the casserole so it wouldn't be too dry.  I also mixed everything together instead of layering it.  You can also add a little garlic powder for extra flavor. Yummy!

I added half a packet of dry onion soup mix to give it flavor (other reviews said it was bland).  This seemed to do the trick - it was delicious.  I didn't have any bread crumbs handy - but used crushed croutons instead.  Will be a regular at our place.

This is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.  It was dry as others noted, so the next time I will use two cans of soup and maybe a can of milk and also more broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

My family really liked this a lot!  I doubled the chicken and the soup mixture and layered twice, because we were having company.  It was all gone.  I did take the suggestion of preparing the stuffing ahead of time to keep it a little moist.  My 12 year old suggested that we use fried onions on top next time.  Thanks for a new addition to our recipe box.

This is my favorite casserole.  I boil the chicken with bouillion cubes to add flavor, then remove the chicken and boil the broccoli in the same water with a little extra seasoning until it turns bright green.   I use 1/4 cup mayo ( I like the extra zip it adds), never use milk, add extra broccoli, omit the stuffing.

My sister hates mushrooms so cream of chicken soup works well too.   We have also made it gluten free.

Very simple. My son loved it my daughter not as much but enjoyed it & its simplicity. I added olives to it & boiled the chicken with butter & chicken bullion gave the chicken a little extra flavor. Also put a layer of stuffing mix on the bottom

This is the second time, Ive made this. I didn't tweak this recipe much. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken. (Only after seeing the amount of broccoli and chicken there was the first time.) The two together, gave it a nice flavor. Used 1 soup can of milk and no mayo. Added a cup of casserole cheese. ( a blend of cheeses) Instead of layering, I just mixed it all together. I made the stuffing as it said on box, and topped it with the cooked stuffing. 5 minutes before it was done I added another cup of the cheese. I sprinkled it on top of the stuffing and let it melt, in the last 5 minutes. I let the family salt and pepper to their liking, as I hate black pepper. LOL Everyone loved it. It's a keeper, with minimal tweaking.

I've made this many times & it's delish. The stuffing is better than bread crumbs, but I use fried onions instead. Like you would use on a green bean casserole. Not only is it a little crunchier but so much more flavor. Try it!

I needed a quick recipe and this was perfect.  I made some changes that others mentioned and they worked.  I, too, seasoned the boiling water/stock in the pot of boiling chicken.  Instead of mayo, I used a TBSP of greek yogurt and added a large clove of pressed garlic to the mix.  I didn't layer but just mixed everything together and added plain bread crumbs and shredded cheese to the top.  The baking time was correct at 25 minutes and it was great.  While I'm not a huge fan of condensed-soup based meals, this was really good.

I love this recipe & I read many of the comments left by others, but I put my own twist on the recipe.
Hubby is allergic to MSG, so I try to avoid cream soups but....   we eat them sometimes.
I used 5 diced chicken tenders & 1/2 cup shredded turkey, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 c milk, 2 c. shredded colby jack cheese, and 1 package stove top stuffing, made up.
I mixed the soup, sour cream & milk together, & spread it on the bottom of 9x13 pan, then spread 2 heads cooked broccoli florets over that, then half the cheese, then the stuffing then the rest of the cheese.  I covered it with foil, then last 5 minutes of cooking time I removed the foil and broiled the cheese..
Next time I make this dish, I plan to make a [from scratch] white sauce w/ chopped mushrooms and make rest of dish the same except for the stuffing, I will omit the stuffing and use cracker crumbs & melted butter -- to make a more MSG-friendly dish for my hubby.

Very good.  Can use low sodium cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup to cut down on sodium.  More than 4 servings.

This was great for a last minute dinner.  The chicken boiled relatively quickly, and afterwards I diced it and tossed it in a spice mix of garlic, paprika, onion, and pepper.  I kept the mayo, but low-fat olive oil mayo and used half as much just for flavor.  I grated a clove of garlic into the soup mixture and I also added about 1/4 of low fat milk.  Instead of layering all of the cheese, I mixed about 1/4 of it into the soup mixture.  It came out really tasty!  I would make it again.

First time ever making a casserole and it was delicious! Everyone loved it!

EDIT: I like to use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I also sprinkle Parmesan on top of the dry stuffing.

I loved this recipe just the way it was.  My extremely picky 8 year old son even liked it which says a lot! Great recipe I will totally make it again!

not a bad recipe to build on but to much tweaking is needed to give it a 4-5 star rating. My dry stuffing mix has no seasoning, I actually made the stuffing (to the dry side/just add less water), boiled chicken is also flavorless so I cooked it in a pan with salt, pepper and some Italian seasoning, changed mayo to miracle whip and used cream of chicken, added fresh thin sliced mushrooms and monterrey cheddar blend cheese since packaged cheddar is flavorless and greasy , mixed it all together and put it in the oven.

I added about 4 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms and used a box of chicken flavored Stove Top Stuffing.  I also added one can of Campbell's beefy mushroom soup for added moisture, which I feel is a must (or 2 total cans of cream of mushroom soup) if you decide to use an entire box of stuffing, like I did.  I didn't layer, I just combined everything, covered the dish with foil so the stuffing wouldn't dry out and get crunchy on top, and cooked for 40 minutes.  Very tasty!

Delicious! I followed the advice of a few folks and combined one can cr of mushroom & one can cr of chicken. I used 2/3 c evaporated milk and threw in a few handfuls of shredded cheddar. (We love cheese!) I mixed everything together with a few dashes of dried onion and topped with a whole sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers. Drizzled 2 TB melted butter on top. Wonderful!

This is simple and very much comfort food. I added two cups of the soup. One cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken. Also skipped the mayo and used some milk and leftover broth from boiling the chicken and I seasoned that warer with salt, pepper and garlic. I also used fresh broccoli. Mix all together top with a bit of the stuffing and cheese and PRESTO! Yummy Yum Yum ! Great leftovers too, I was so miffed when both kids asked for it in their lunches the next day and mommy had NONE!

Fast, filling and awesome.  I often use 1 cup of crushed saltines or whatever crackers or breadcrumbs I have mixed with 1/4 c. butter.  Makes just as nice a crust as the stuffing.

Only giving four stars because I did have to change it using the other reviewers suggestions. Boiled the breasts from frozen in bullion and some spices. Then after I removed them from the bullion I dumped the veggies in the hot pot to thaw them, then drained after a few minutes.  I added some minced onion. I also used two cans of soup and milk instead of mayo because I didn't have any and used a whole box of stuffing, just mixing everything together.  I topped with 1 cup cheese and some italian seasoned bread crumbs.  It's quite good and I would call my additions 5 star, but as-is it would not have enough bread to suit us.

I followed many of the suggestions mentioned in the other reviews, but instead of cream of chicken soup, I mixed an 8 oz. sour cream with the cream of mushroom soup.  It was so good!

I'm eating this right now.  It's very good!  I adapted it just a little bit.  I boiled the chicken in vegetable broth (would have gone with chicken broth, but I didn't have any on hand).  I used 2 cans of the mushroom soup and as another reviewer suggested, substituted 3/4 cup of milk for the mayo.  I mixed salt, lots of pepper, a pinch of ginger and a teaspoon of paprika (also suggested by another reviewer).  I used garlic herb bread crumbs instead of stuffing because that's what I had.  This is really great.  What I like most about it is that it's easy to make, and so adaptable.  Next time I might include peas and carrots as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe to alter if short on time.  I heated up some frozen breaded chicken patties in the oven and cooked the broccoli meanwhile in the microwave.  Then used jojojomama's suggestions and mixed the cream of chicken/mushroom with milk, the seasonings, and everything else.  Then baked in oven about 20 minutes and served with cut-up chicken on top.  Really yummy!  The breaded chicken was crunchy enough, that I prob won't put stuffing mix on top next time.

I didn't love the combination of cheddar cheese with the stuffing mix on top.  Those two flavors just don't go together, in my opinion.

I made a few changes to this reciepe as well. To keep the calories down I used 1 can of fat free condensed cream of chicken soup and 1/3 cup of light sour cream instead of mayo. I also didn't cook the chicken. I cubed the uncooked chicken, mixed it with the soup and sour cream, poured it into a 9 X 13 baking dish, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, layered it with fresh cooked broccoli, then stuffing, I used the boxed stuffing and cooked it according to the package, minus the butter. Then I sprinkled it with cheese. I cooked the casserole uncovered at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then let it set for a few minutes. It was delicious and creamy. Chicken was cooked through and tender, not dry. Broccoli was tender and stuffing was crispy, not hard, which I think would have happen had I not cooked the stuffing firt. I'll definitely make this again.

I cut this recipe in half.  Cooking for 2 here. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  It turned out fantastic!  I covered it with foil for 45 mins and removed foil for remaining 5 mins. Let stand for 5 mins.  Turned out amazing! I also used fresh broccoli which is what I had on hand.  Hubby loved it!  No need to add salt to this dish.

Easy and tastes good!  I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup, some onion powder, and about 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms.  Didn't layer (just mixed everything together in a big bowl) and placed in the pan and topped with cheese and a 1/2 package of stuffing for chicken.  Will make again!

Okay, this made it a 5 star recipe for our family. I put brown rice on the bottom, frozen broccoli (didn't cook it before, and it turned out great only cooking in the oven for 25 min). I cubed chicken and boiled it with salt, garlic salt, and some Italian seasoning - which gave it great flavor, then I mixed it with 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 8 oz sour cream, about 1/2 cup milk, 1 1/4 cup cheddar cheese. I poured the chicken/soup mixture on top of broccoli and rice, crushed up ritz crackers on top and pour some melted butter on top to seal the flavoring. My husband isn't a big casserole fan, but he loved this!

I made the mistake of following jojojomama's "5 star" adjustment and it was very possibly the WORST casserole I've ever eaten. My husband said if I would have left the italian seasoning, ginger and paprika out of it, it might have been decent. Too, too much soup. Sour cream would have been helpful, but I'm not sure. I will never make this again.

I read through others suggestions first and cooked the stuffing before adding it to the casserole, and I used some sour cream and milk instead of the mayo.  My husband and I couldn't get enough of it!  There were zero leftovers, delicious!

Honestly, I don't understand why the rating for this recipe is so high.  Maybe it's because my standard for food is really high but this recipe is BLAND BLAND BLAND.  I read some other people's recipe and it seems to be way better going to try it soon.  Mayo + cream of mushroom soup doesn't do anything.  I don't understand why you add it.  Milk sounds way better... the cream is too thick.  Also boiling the chicken by itself is a terrible idea.  Chicken comes out super bland and has the pure chicken taste which I don't enjoy.  Chicken without any seasoning is pretty terrible in my opinion.  Try another recipe... I learned to never follow a recipe that says: just boil the chicken.

This meal is one of our new favorites. I wanted to add that I noticed that the recipe is on the back of the stuffing mix too but slightly modified. The stuffing is cooked and it calls for milk rather than mayo. I also added garlic and pepper to it to add some extra flavor.

I made this tonight for the first time and my family loved it! I did get tips from the other reviews and made it my own special way. Sauteed mushrooms and onions, cooked broccoli, used 1/2 c. milk, whole bag of cheese, mixed the stuffing in with the chicken, cream soups, onions, mushrooms, broccoli, sprinkled top with italian bread crumbs. It was GREAT!! Will have again.

I made it regarding the last comment with the 3/4 cup of milk, 2 cups of cheese, using bread crumbs, and adding a cream of chicken soup... while mixing it all together instead of layering. IT WAS FANTASTIC and my family LOVED it.  I'm a newbie when it comes to cooking, so this was a hit and easy to do!

This is why we all have cupboards! Great recipe that is very forgiving and allows you to use whatever you have on hand for a very quick, easy dinner. I made adjustments out of neccesity: I used 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup of milk & 1/2 cup sour cream (I omitted the mayo as well) 1 cup frozen mushrooms, 1/2 frozen peas, 1/2 cup diced carrots, 2 tbsps chopped garlic, 1 tsp dried Italian seasoning, 1 tsp onion pwdr, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and topped it all w/1 cup crushed Ritz crackers. On advice from other reviewers, I also mixed everything together and topped w/the crackers. It came out very good and was well recieved by my picky 2 yr old! Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner it was great.  I tweaked it just a bit.  I took some of the others users advice by using one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  I mixed 1 cup of cheese in the soup mixture with 1/2 cup of milk.  I baked the chicken instead boiling it.  I seasoned it with course ground pepper, sea salt, and McCormicks Chicken seasoning.  Instead of crackers, stuffing, or croutons to top the casserole I used French Fried Onions by Frenches.  It was divine.  Because the chicken was seasoned while cooking I didn't need to add salt or pepper to the end result.  Try it with the French Fried Onions it really makes a difference in flavor.

This is a family favorite, however mine is altered.  I use a can of cream/mush and a can of cream/chicken.  Before I layer it into the casserole I mix the two soups with a cup of chicken broth.  I actually cook the stuffing first and let it cool, then crumble it on top and bake for 30 minutes.  It is one of the few dishes my whole family can agree on.

Fabulous recipe.  I read the reviews and made all of the changes ... 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  Added the garlic and spices and put in 3 cups of cheddar cheese.  I put half of the stuffing mix on the bottom of the dish and stirred the other half into the soup mixture.  I also changed the mayo to 1/2 can of milk.  I put Italian seasoned bread crumbs moistened with melted button on the top and baked it for about 50 minutes.  A great big hit and will be made many more times.  My husband offered a suggestion to add slivered almonds the next time that I make it.

My husband LOVES this, however I didn't like how the chicken turned out. It seemed really dry. So what I did was cook the chicken in the slow cooker while at work with a can of cream of mushroom, and 1 cup water. When I got home the chicken just fell apart and was juicy. I didn't cook it as long as it said in the oven either since the chicken was already cooked. I only did it for 15 min. To heat it up, and melt the cheese. 
My daughter who wont eat anything EVER , loved it. I will now make this more often since now we all enjoy it.

The casserole tasted okay, but it was extremely dry.  If I had read some of the reviews first and tried their suggestions I think it would have been better.

Simple and quick so it gets 4 stars, but I did follow the direction of eailer reviewers and subed milk for mayo and mixed the stuffing in with the rest of the ingredents.  However, I did leave out some stuffing to put on top and wish I hadn't.  I think that next time I will either use only half the stuffing mix and combine it in with the rest and leave off the top (which was dry and not tasty..we all ended up scraping it off) or I will try corn flakes which sounds better.

This casserole is so yummy! Of course I took everyone's tips into consideration when making this, but what worked best for me is adding an extra can of cream of mushroom, spreading a bottom layer of stuffing crumbs in the pan with some butter so it'd stick to the chicken, and placing a couple pieces of butter on the top so the cheese doesn't get too hard. I measured out a cup of the stuffing crumbs for the top and used the rest of the box for the bottom layer. Just so I wouldn't waste anything, I also used the seasoning packet that came with it in the soup/mayo mixture. Delicious!

This was good but it was missing something the first time I cooked it. The second time I used 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and 1 can of cream of chicken and 3/4 cup milk. Marinated the chicken for 24 hours in herb and garlic marinade. I also added 2 cups of partially cooked rotini pasta, a spoonful of minced garlic, about a T of italian seasoning and onion powder before mixing it all up. Topped it with cheese and dry stuffing mix. This made it much better. The first time it was too bland.

Read the reviews and changes before you make this recipe! I made 1/2 a recipe, since it was just for my DH & myself. Yes, it was too dry and not enough flavor. I will make this again with some of the suggested changes as it is very quick and easy.

This is a great one to play with. I made a couple changes and turned out delicious!! Boiled chicken in 2 cups water but added minced garlic, paprika, and onion powder. After cooking the broccoli, I mashed it up into small pieces, mixed  it in with a can cream of mushroom, a can of cream of chicken and 3/4c milk. Also, I added a cup of slightly under cooked rice (will tender while baking), and cubed the chicken. After reading others reviews, I took the advice and mixed it all togetherthen put crushed corn flakes and parm. cheese and italian seasoning on the top to finish it off. It was really really good! Will make again and try some other things just to tweak it. The rice really added to it! Thanks for the recipe!!

I cant give it 5 stars because I made most of the changes suggested in the reviews. I sauted the chicken on the stove before mixing. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery. I also used 3/4 cups of milk and no mayo. I also mixed everything together, didnt layer it, but I saved 1/2 cup of stove top for the top and mixed in the rest of the package. Next time I think I will put more on top because I liked it crispy. I might try making the stuffing 1st next time  before I mix it. Its easy and quick and always have these items on hand so its a keeper

This was pretty good, but it was a little dry for my tastes. Next time I would use 2 cans of soup and maybe a 1/2 cup of milk. I followed other users' suggestions of mixing everything together instead of layering. I also cooked the stuffing separately; it takes under 10 minutes and it's worth it. I mixed a cup of cheese in with everything, then topped it with 1 more cup, then covered the top of the casserole with bread crumbs. Pretty tasty. Thanks :)

I used the tips that the other viewers said about two cans of soup.  I mixed cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and 3/4 cup of milk.  I also put in preseasoned chicken and turkey 2.5 cup combined of the two, and instead of layering the stuffing, broccoli, cheese,chicken and soup, I mixed it all together and spread in in a 13x9 in. baking pan.  I used a combination of montery jack and sharp cheddar cheese, and about five minutes before baking time ended I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top to cover the dish. My family loved it.  I prepared it last night and there is none left.  Great recipe! I will be preparing it again for our potlucks at church and at work.  Thanks for the tips!

Very good comfort food.  I used some of the modifications recommended.  Definitely needs 2 cans of soup and at least 3/4 can of milk.  Everything else I just adjusted for our taste.  I agree that the stuffing should be stirred in - not left on top.

This is a very yummy casserole. I used a whole box of stuffing, mixed everything together, added a little chopped onion and a couple dashes of garlic & onion powder. I did half Cheddar & half Monterey Jack cheeses. Before baking I crushed some town house crackers over the top. Was nice & filling for a main dish.

This recipe was a real big hit with the whole family.  I changed it a little after reading several of the recipes.  I boiled my chicken in chicken broth with some spices (garlic powder, pepper, Italian seasoning, and chicken seasoning). I also used fresh broccoli and microwaved it with some, water, butter and garlic salt for 4 minutes. I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of broccoli cheese soup and replaced the mayo with 1/2 can of milk. I cooked the stuffing with the leftover broth I cooked the chicken in. I also used about 2-3 cups of cheese. I then mixed everything together savings some of the stuffing and cheese (1/2 cup) to put on top of the mixture.  IT WAS DELICIOUS! :)

We used chicken flavored stuffing and it was awesome! I also seasoned with a little garlic salt, black pepper, and parsley. Also, to cut down on time, I used Tyson's diced chicken... 3 packages of it is enough for a 9x11 pan. We also replaced the cream of mushroom soup for the broccoli cheese soup and it was AWESOME!! We've made this twice and both times it turned out great!

YUM!! My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did follow these suggestions from the other reviews:  Omit the mayo, use 1/2 can of milk, 2 cans of mushroom soup, add paprika to the chicken while cooking on the stove, cook the suffing and add it in to the mix.  I mixed everything in a large bowl then put it in the pan and topped w/italian style breadcrumbs.  Will definantly make it again.

I loved it as well as my boyfriend, who is very picky about chicken meals. I mixed stuffing in the mix and then sprinkled some on top (I am a big stuffing fan) and then topped with bread crumbs as other users suggested. I also used 2 cans soup and milk instead of mayo. Very delicious, will make again.

I followed some of the reviews: I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead of just 1, 1 box of stuffing for chicken, 4 chicken thighs, frozen brocolli, and shredded velvetta. I cooked the chicken in water with 2 chicken bouillon cubes. Once done, I shredded the chicken using a fork. I cooked the stuffing accdg to package instructions. I then mixed the shredded cheese, half-cooked brocolli, shredded chicken, 1/2 cup of milk, and stuffing. Then I baked it for 30 mins. Everybody loved it!

I made this recipe with the modifications suggested by many of the reviewers.  I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups, replaced the mayo with 1/2 cup of milk, prepared the stuffing according to the directions on the box and mixed everything up together before baking.  With the modifications, it was good...not out of this world, but I will definitely make it again.  My picky son ate it and didn't even realize he was getting his veggies for the day too!  I suspect without these modifications this would be a pretty bland casserole.

I loved this easy recipe! I made some adjustment based on other reviews I read. I first sprinkled my chicken breasts with Montreal Chicken seasoning and let it chill in the fridge for a few hours. I then boiled the chicken in chicken broth, minced garlic, onion powder and a dash of fresh ground pepper. I used two cans cream of mushroom soup and 1 can ceram of chicken soup. I did not use the mayo, but one cup of milk....I wouldn't use mayo in this. I mixed together all of the ingredients and added 1 extra cup of cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper and some sauteed onion. I did not layer this dish just threw it all together and topped with Italian bread crumbs drizzled with melted butter. It was a huge hit with my entire family. I served this with a rice dish I make and it was a family pleaser. Will make again. Easy and yummy! Thanks!

Rating it 5 stars with our changes.  We've made it twice now, and tonight, the "anti veggie" husband can't get enough.  I used 1 back petite broccoli florets, left frozen (easier!).  2 cans cream o mushroom & 1 can cream o chicken soup.  Substituted 1 can milk for the mayo. Took the stuffing mix and added melted butter, then I did as others and mixed all together, but tonight I forgot to mix the cheese in, which was better!  Put the cheese on top and added bread crumbs, baked, then broiled the last few minutes which gave it a great crust!!

I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccoli, as suggested by others.  My family had two different opinions.  My kids absolutely loved it. To me it was just okay.  My grownup tastebuds felt that everything was drowning in the sauce; and there was just nothing "wow" about it.  A very ordinary casserole.  But it gets 4 stars for the happy kids.  Your kids will like it, too.

I made this dish tonight and it smelled as good as it tasted...which was terrific! I followed some tips from other reviews and used two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom and a half can of milk instead of the mayonaise.  I also used more stuffing and cheese then it called for.  I meant to boil the chicken in chicken broth but forgot; however the chicken did not taste bland to us just using water.  Our toddler loved this as well so I will definetley make this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful dish! Instead of stuffing on the top, I crushed ritz crackers and sprinkled those on. It was perfect.

I made this recipe tonight and it was a success! My family loved it.  It reminded me of a casserole my aunt used to make for potlucks.  A crowd favorite.  I did as the other reviews said...I used 2 cans of soup, one crm of chkn, one crm of celery, and half a can of milk to mix with the broccoli and chicken and cheese.  I also boiled the chicken in broth with a couple bay leaves.  Delicious!  Follow the directions from the review from 10-11-06. That is what I did to get it right.

This turned out wonderful.  I used a cut up chicken and popped into crockpot with chicken broth, four cloves of garlic and one cut up onion.  When I got home I deboned and skinned the chicken meat, mixed in frozen broccoli a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery soup mixed it all together and added french fried onions to top.  This turned out great.  Have also used with canned tuna. Thanks for the post.

Yummy!!!!!! I'm a stay-at-home mom of 3 young boys and I'm always looking for quick, easy and cheap dinner meals to make and this recipe...is absolulely a keeper.

FYI...I changed this recipe just slightly. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken to make sure this casserole came out nice and moist. Also, I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of dry bread crumbs.

Very easy and yummy! I used bread crumbs instead of stuffing. It was a little dry, so next time I will add more soup or sour cream.

Yum! I decided to first add a layer of linguini which made it more filling & added texture. I don't care for mushroom soup, so I combined 1 can cream of celery & 1 can cream of chicken with 1/2 can of milk. I am not a good cook & yet I was able to create a fabulous meal that will last a few days. Will definitely make again!

My husband LOVED it!!...I followed recipe but with a few alternate suggestions from other reviewers, such as simmering chicken in chicken broth & using that with the soup. I also used cream of mushroom & garlic soup for added flavor and served with rice. Definately will make again!!

Very good and easy...2 things I like!  The only thing I did differently was adding steamed carrots and one more can of soup.  Oh, I also cut crescent rolls (while they are still rolled up) and laid them on top instead of using stuffing.  Just something I've done with other casseroles that truly makes a one dish meal...not even a need for rolls on the side!  Very good flavor and a hit even with my 4 yr. old.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty comfort food.  To make it a "one dish" meal I put a layer of 3 cups cooked long grain rice on the bottom of the (buttered) baking dish. Cooked noodles would be good too. I did add about 1/2 cup of half & half to the soup/mayonaise mix to keep it from getting too dry.  Good busy day meal. Easy to prepare all but the final baking the night before, refrigerate and finish baking right before dinner.

My husband and I really love this recipe, as do all of my friends that I have shared it with.  This is a great way to use up those holiday leftovers, we substitute turkey for chicken--much better than turkey sandwiches.

Definately double the soup mixture.  It came out pretty dry the first time.  I liked the stuffing mix on top unprepared because it gave it a crunch and a difference in texture.  The kids ate it up!

I found this recipe really easy to make.  I used frozen broccoli florets (thawed) which worked really well.  My husband thought it was "really good" and one of my daughters liked it as well (the other hated it...oh well, can't win them all!).  Personally I thought it was very tasty and would make this again sometime.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe, even though I'm not much for casseroles. I did make a few changes based on other's suggestions...added onion salt and garliv to the soup/mayo mix and prepared the stuffing with 1/2 the water it called for before sprinkling it on top (not too wet, not too dry). Will definitely have it again!

Although this is a delicious chicken
dish, it is time consuming to boil
the chicken and steam the broccoli.
since it is very tasty, I will try to
experiment with easier/quicker ways
to prepare it.

When I  read the recipe it REALLY appeared to be bland for my palate, so I improvised.   I had NO intention of boiling the chicken.  I seasoned the chicken breasts lightly with garlic, seasoning salt,  and black pepper,  then put them in a skillet with 2 pats of butter, slicing them along the way as they seared.  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup....keeps it from being a dry dish.   And I love cheese, so I used 1 bag of colby jack, 1 bag of mild cheddar, and 1 bag of mozzarella.  The dry bread crums were ok, but I think next time I will actually make the stuffing as intended, and then top the dish off with it before baking.  A simple and exquisite dish, but I recommend making it to fit your palate.

Simple. I used Amy's porchini mushroom soup, added button mushrooms, and made my own rye bread bread crumbs (super crunchy) for the topping. I added more spices here and there as well. I doubt I'd serve it to company but I'm home sick today and it's a great meal to have on hand for the family to reheat at will.

Great recipe. I added cooked rice ( minute) 1cup cooked and 2.cans of cream of celery soup to the mayo, and then baked it. I screwed up. The poached chicken and broccoli were still in the strainer. So I mixed them in (breaking up the cheese topping), and baked for another 5 minutes. A fortuitous mistake. The broccoli stayed crisp, and the chicken was warm. I recommend that you add the cooked chicken and broccoli 5 to 10 minutes before the end of baking. It ruins the nice cheese coating, since it's mixed in, but the chicken is very tender and the broccoli crisp. My wife and I loved it. A keeper.

Fantastic recipe! I added a few other seasonings and replaced the mayo for milk, but that is not to say that this is a hit as it is!! Also, for a time and energy saver, I used canned chunk chicken breast...

With some of the changes suggested on here my family and I loved this dish. I used half cream of chicken, half cream of mushroom, instead of just cream of mushroom. I subbed a 1/2 cup of milk for the mayo, as well as adding 2 cloves of garlic finely chopped and salt and pepper to taste. The last thing I did, which made a big difference (because Iv'e made this recipe several times now), is I used crushed up ritz crackers instead of stuffing on top.

I baked the chicken, not boil it, better flavor, also added a cup of mayonnaise and put cornflakes on top of cheese instead of stuffing mix.  It was good, it is an old recipe

I added extra cheese and mixed the cream of mushroom with cream of chicken for extra flavor. The husband and I AND my three young kids (one that doesn't eat broccoli, one that doesn't eat stuffing, and one that doesn't eat broccoli or mushrooms) ate every bit of it. I used leftover baked chicken and will do the same in the future for leftovers. It's an easy throw-together dinner.

I made this tonight. Instead of chicken I used Turkey cutlets. I diced them upand seasoned with garlic & onion powder. I also used Mrs Dash table blend. I sauted the turkey in some olive oil. I weny ahead mixed the soup and mayo in small bowl and poured it in the pan with the turkey. I also mixed the broccoli and cheese in it too. I put it in a bake dish and topped it off with some cheese and the stuffing. Turned out really good.

With just one can of soup, this recipe is pretty boring. I added a can of cream of chicken on top of the mushroom. I also sauteed the chicken in chunks instead of boiling. I left off the stuffing mix. It was okay. Not something I'd make again.

It was good, but absolutely pan sautee the chicken until browned, (who wants boiled chicken) and double the soup and MILK not mayo, and kick up the cheese to taste.
Comfort food :)

I tried this recipe last night.  It was pretty good. I subbed panko crumbs instead of stuffing bread cubes.  I melted about a Tablespoon of butter and mixed it with about a cup of panko then sprinkled that over the cheese before putting it in the oven.  The panko browns up and forms a cheesy, crunchy crust.

The stuffing topping wasn't our favorite since it remained crunchy. I may use this recipe as a baseline and tweek it to our likings, but I always like to try it as is and review it as is first!

When I was putting this together I got distracted & mixed the cheese with the soup & mayo so I sprinkled a handful on before the stuffing mix. Also, instead of using boneless/skinless chicke breasts, I used 3 cans of canned chicken (Wal-Mart brand) and it was delicious! Next time I might try using 1/2 pepper jack cheese & 1/2 sharp chedder.

The only thing I changed was I used ritz crackers crumbled because I had no stuffing mix but it seemed so bland. Maybe next time I will try it with some of the suggestions but I always try the recipes as close to the original as possible.

I made this casserole but instead of broccoli I added about 3/4 bag of frozen peas and seasoned the chicken with McCormick's Montreal Chicken when I baked it.  I thought it needed something else to go with it, so I made Pasta Roni White Cheddar Shells and served the casserole ON TOP of the pasta.  Clean plates and NO LEFT OVERS!!!  The family requested that I make this "at least" once a week!!!

Super yummy!  Such simple ingredients that I always have on hand.  I do agree with other posts that please just make the recipe as is and then rate it.  Add your extra ingredients the next time and post as a whole new recipe.

Easy recipe, but not much flavor to recommend it.  I tried others' suggestions adding, garlic, Italian seasoning, dash of ginger, pepper, 1/3 c. sour cream.  Still a ho-hum casserole.

Wish I had read through some of the reviews for tips on 'punching up' this recipe. As it stands it's pretty dull and while it's easy enough to put together I wouldn't call it quick either. Check out some of the earlier tips to help add some flavor to this otherwise dull meal.

My family loved this casserole. I made a few changes to use what I had on hand; cream of chicken soup, a few added veggies that I had from a veggie tray..celery, carrots and pea pods. I also used a whole box of low sodium Stove Top Stuffing for chicken and drizzled 1/4 c. melted butter over all since I used more dressing mix and didn't want it to be dry. Awesome!

However you make this recipe, it is also wonderful if you add curry powder to taste.  It's a very nice alternative.

I have been making this for years only just a little different.  I don't cook anything before I bake it.  I layer my chicken then the broccoli, then cover it with swiss cheese, then a can of either cream of celery or cream of chicken soup.  I then mix together 1 stick of butter and 2 cups of seasoned stuffing mix and put on top.  Cover with foil and bake @350 for 1 1/2 hours.    Salt and pepper the chicken.  I haven't tried this recipe but had to give it a rating.

I've made a similar version. Omit the stuffing. I also add onion and egg (as a binder) and top with either cheezits or cheese nacho chips.

I didn't care for this at all. The stuffing on top was very dry. I had leftovers and the next night I just added chicken broth on top of the stuffing and covered and warmed in the ove. That seemed to help.

I made this recipe following the tips of the first reviewer with the exception of adding the onion powder as I was out of that spice and I used stuffing instead of cornflakes. But, I have to say that I really didn't like this dish. The stuffing didn't taste good at all and it was way too creamy/soupy for me...not a fan.

This was awesome!  I made a few changes however--  I used only 2 chicken breasts and browned them in butter then poured the 1 can soup w/ some black pepper and milk over them to finish cooking.  I covered my broccoli with water to boil and threw in a couple small handfuls of egg noodles when the water came to a full boil.  After about 6 min, drained my noodles/broccoli and poured into 9x13.  Then shredded my chicken and poured the soup and chicken mixture in.  I was out of cheddar, so I tore up a couple slices of deluxe american.  Baked for about 10 min at 350 then threw on some french fried onions and baked a few mins more.  The chicken wasn't dried out and the onions added some extra flavor and crunch.  Great recipe.  DELISH!

Truly a delicious dish.  After reading the additional comments... we created our own version that combined many of the finer points of the meal suggestions.  I added the Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Broccoli, with a cup of milk.  Seasoned with Onion, Garlic and select Herbs to taste.  I mixed the chicken(which was boiled in water and chicken bouillon), Broccoli and 3 different cheeses(about 1 1/2 cups total) in the bowl with the soup mixture.  I added Italion Bread Crumbs to the mixture to ensure the right consistancy.  It was topped with 2 cheeses, Italion Bread Crumbs and Kellogs Corn Flake Crumbs.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan at 350 for 20 minutes.  It was very moist and had a great "crust"!  Enjoy!!!  8-)

This recipe sounded a little vague so I changed a few things: seasoned & sauteed chicken with onions & mushrooms. In my dish, my first layer was rice then the chicken mixture then broccoli. I thought it was tasty but I'm glad I preseasoned everything first. Next time I will add cauliflower tothe broccoli mixture.

I had left over baked chicken so I made this recipe.  Didn't have the stuffing mix, so I mixed bread crumbs with butter and a little of the chicken fat and sprinkled that over the top.  Everyone really enjoyed this and I'll make it again in the future.  Would prefer it a little creamier; maybe add a splash of milk next time?

I thought this was decent, but my five-year-old son INHALED it!  The only changes I made were to replace the mayo with 3/4 C whole milk, added a can of cream of chix soup, and sprinkled Italian style breadcrumbs over the top before baking instead of using the dry stuffing mix.

Both my husband and I thought this was very tasty.   It is a must have to put the buttery crackers on top.  I made my own by melting butter and adding crushed saltines to the melted butter and then sprinkled it on top.

My pickiest eater loved this dish. I mixed all the ingredients except the stuffing together in a bowl. Put it in a 9x13 pan and topped with the stuffing mix. Excellent!

This casserole is delicious and my family loved it (including one o our cats who even ate the broccoli!) After looking at the reviews, I took some of the suggestions. I used two cans of soup - 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken. I also cut up the chicken into chunks. In place of the mayo I used 1/2 cup of milk and instead of 1 cup of cheese I used 2. I also added garlic to the soup mixture (I didn't measure tho, just added according to taste) and used bread crumbs instead of stuffing. I mixed everything but the bread crumbs and cheese together in a casserole dish, put the bread crumbs on top and then the cheese over that. I covered it with foil except for the last five minutes. It came out so moist and perfect!

Easy to prepare, but too thick and creamy for my husband and myself. I agree with others--eat leftovers next day, or toss.

Really Really good!  My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised.  The only change I made was to use cr of chicken and cr of mushroom soup.  Also, milk instead of mayo.  One word of caution, eat the leftovers in a day or toss (trust me).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy, my family really enjoyed this recipe including three young eaters. So much better than typical chicken casseroles. I added 2 cups of stuffing instead of one and as others mentioned, I mixed the stuffing mixture with the chicken instead of layering.

I really loved this recipe and the reviews were very helpful.  I pan fried the chicken with a little seasoning. I also used some other reviews suggestions and added a 2nd can of soup and used mild instead of mayo.  It turned out terrific.

This was very good. Instead of boiling the chicken, I sauteed it in about 2 T. of olive oil. I reserved some of the juices and browned bits and mixed in the soup, mayo and a litte milk in the pan before mixing everything together. I think this really enriched the flavor.

Good!  After reading the reviews-I boiled the chicken in some chicken stock, used milk instead of the mayo and added some italian seasoning and carrots in addition to the broccoli.  I mixed everything together and put the stuffing on top.  I also skipped the cheese all together.  Don't think it needed it. Would make again.

this was a big hit with the family.  I used the mixed veggies for something different.  Instead of mayo, I used 3/4 cup of milk like some others.  I don't like stuffing so I did the cornflakes and the bread crumbs on top.  My family loved it.

I'm sorry but we just didn't like this at all.  I LOVE broccoli, but there was just something about this casserole that I didn't really like.  My husband didn't like the topping, and my kids (2 out of 3) wouldn't even touch it.

I agree that this was a little dry.  Next time I'll add a little milk to the soup mixture.  I seasoned with onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper before cheese topping.  Also used bread crumbs and butter instead of stuffing.  Husband loved it, I thought it was okay, kids didn't like it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was tasty.  To speed up the dish I used cooked frozen broccoli and it didn't taste as good as the fresh would I'm sure.  I'll make it again, but with fresh broccoli.

Very, Very good.  I took another's advice:  cooked the chicken in my crockpot to make it nice and tender.  Added 3/4 can milk to the 2 cans of soup also.  The rest I did just as posted in the recipe.  It was very easy and super delish.  I'll definitely keep this one handy!

Loved this meal, but made a few adjustments.  For a little kick, I sauteed red bell pepper and added it to the brocolli after the  brocolli was steamed.  Instead of boiling chicken, I grilled. I also added a tablespoon of non fat sour cream & 1/4 c milk to the soup.  Lastly, since I didn't have the stuffing, I substitued with garlic parmesian croutons (crushed).   I topped with about 1/4 c sheddar, vs 1 cup.

This is pretty good although needs some changes. This is very similar to another casserole that I make.(which I absolutely love!!) Try using cream of chicken soup in place of the mushroom. Then use sour cream and mayo with a  1/2 tsp of lemon juice. Then to make the stuffing more delicious add melted butter to it before placing on the top of casserole.

Seemed a bit rich with so much meat in it. So, next time I am going to half the meat and increase the broccoli by 50% more. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms to mine as my son and I like them a lot. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I've been in a slump for what to cook and this one inspired me!!!

Wasn't a crowd pleaser. My boys didn't like it - I have 3, but my daughter and husband loved it. I thought it was ok, not great, but ok. Please be advised, that with a family of 6, I rarely make everyone happy 100% of the time.

This is a great, easy weeknight meal. My husband isn't big on casseroles and he loved it. I  crushed up cheese nip crackers and spread them over the top. That extra cheese taste was great! I will definitely make this again!

This is the first time I've heard of using dry stuffing mix for topping on a casserole.  It works very well. As many reviewers suggested, I mixed everything together (except for the cheese and stuffing mix).  After mixing the rest of the ingredients together, I sprinkled the cheese on, then topped it with the stuffing mix.  These flavors belong together.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the mix.  I suspect the casserole would have been dry without the extra moisture.  I also added another tablespoon of mayo to maintain the correct ratio of mayo to soup.  My son is not a casserole aficionado, but I forced him to take a bite and he ended up having three helpings!  The consistency was great.

I think the reviews I went by are what made this one a success... but, surprisingly no one suggested to use low sodium soups, as this is quite salty.  In keeping with the suggestions in reviews, I used a can of crm of broc and a can of crm of chicken.  I also added 1/4 tsp of onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper and omitted the mayo (eww).  I stirred the soup mixture, 1 cup of cheese, the chicken, broccoli and stuffing mix all together and then topped it with 1 more cup of cheese and buttery breadcrumbs. I will probably add in another cup of stuffing mix next time too... A great meal for a chilly fall or winter's night!

I added extra soup, cut out the mayo and prepared the stuffing before I put it in.  This was a great meal that provided lots of leftovers.

This recipe was EXCELLENT. Like some other "chefs", I made a few tweaks. I used cream of chicken and cream of celery soups (instead of mushroom). I used half a can of milk instead of mayo. I used both mozzarella and cheddar cheese. I added shredded carrots and green onions. I mixed the shredded chicken in with everything instead of layering. I topped it with italian bread crumbs and sprinkled ritz crackers and cheese with some real butter on top. It smelled delicious and tasted even better! Thanks for this great base recipe!

My family uses a recipe very similar to this, but there is one little addition that makes a HUGE difference: add sliced, toasted almonds to the soup mixture. I promise, it will make this so much better! Adds a bit of crunch and flavor.

This dish was amazing! If you love broccoli, chicken and cheese you have to try this super easy casserole. Make sure and use 2 cans of soup. I also used milk instead of Mayo. We usually have leftovers in the fridge for days.....not with this one.  My husband ate it for lunch and dinner and didn't leave me any! Try it!

It isn't something I would make for company but I definitely liked it for a quick one dish meal for the family.  I mixed the cooked stuffing in with the rest of the ingredients along with some cheddar cheese, topped with cheese and baked.  It was very yummy and had enough for leftovers that I actually was craving for the next night.  I did the two cans of soup as well, one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  Will definitely make again.

I made many of the recommended changes like adding a can of broccoli cheese soup and subbing milk for mayo.  I added some onions in with the broccoli and I also seasoned the chicken before pan frying it.  My boyfriend LOVED it and has been begging me to make it again!

5 stars for simplicity.  I made this twice.  Once w/ chicken breasts that I boiled, 1 1/2 cans soup, milk instead of mayo and 1 1/2 C stuffing- ALL MIXED TOGETHER and topped w/ bread crumbs.  yummy.  The next time I made it w/ 1/2 costco rotisserie chicken, 1 can soup, mayo and milk, 1 2/3 C stuffing and some garlic powder.  all mixed together.  both times were equally good.  I don't  think you can mess up this recipe.  don't overcook broccoli.  I used a head both times- no clue how much it weighed.

Substituted 2 cream of chicken soup.  Make sure you don't over cook your brocolli or it gets too mushy after you cook it in the oven.

This was so good! Everyone really enjoyed it. I took the advice of some other readers & put in milk instead of mayo & also mixed stuffing with cheese. Topped with bread crumbs. Will definitely make it again.

I made some changes too.  I added 1/2 can cream of chicken soup, I cup of milk, sauteed chicken with chopped onions and garlic, and Montreal chicken seasoning. Added water to stuffing before spreading.  The best recipe off this cite yet!!

tweaked a bit... but loved it... simmering the chicken in broth, cooking the stuffing, 1/2 c more cheese, mixing it all together, & topping with bread crumbs worked well.

A delicious and easy dish.  Followed others' advice and added garlic powder, ginger, and substituted 3/4C milk for the mayo.  I think the latter change is needed, otherwise it would come out a bit gloppy.  Anyway, my 3 and 5 year olds gobbled it up and they are very finicky eaters.  My husband tasted it (we happened to be eating something else) and loved it, too.

To make this quicker, I used 4 (12.5 oz.) cans of Tyson canned, fully-cooked, white meat chicken chunks instead of boiling chicken breasts.  I used the bagged broccoli florets that you can microwave in the bag and then throw into the bowl with the other ingredients(Broccoli Wokly brand).  I also omitted the mayo and added 3/4 cup of milk.  As suggested by another reviewer, I added 1/8 tsp. of onion powder, 1 minced garlic clove, and a pinch of ginger.  I also used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.... mixed everything in the same bowl, put in a 9x13 pan, covered with cheese and bread crumbs...  This took less than 10 minutes to assemble and get into the oven.  Yummy and quick!  Family loved it!

Great!  Following other reviewers, I doubled the soup (using 98% fat free soup), added chopped mushrooms and added a little basil and garlic salt.  Then stirred it all together (with stuffing mix) and topped with bread crumbs and Parmesan.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I think the roasted garlic added just the right "something". I also prepared the stuffing according to package directions prior to using it to top the casserole; I didn't read the directions correctly. But it came out perfect for me(I'm not a huge fan of crunchy toppings). Thanks for an easy and tasty casserole recipe!!

This casserole was dry and lacking in flavor.  If I were to do it again I'd mix instead of layer the ingredients and find something tastier than cream of mushroom soup.

This was a fantastic meal.  I read several of the reviews so I already knew to add I can each of cream of chicken and cream of broccoli soups.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth with chicken spices, salt, pepper, 2 bulbs of garlic, and 2 bay leaves.  I used the 1/2 can of milk instead of mayo.  I cooked the stuffing before I put it on top AND finally... instead of 1 full cup of cheddar cheese in the mix I used 1/2 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup of shredded pepper jack.  It sounds crazy but it added some zest without overpowering the flavor.  It was an absolute hit!

I should have read the reviews first! Great flavor, but too dry.  I served it with rice last night, and just dumped the leftover rice in, and added another can of soup/ mayo, mixed and topped with more stuffing cubes-  great!
Two cans of soup is a must!

I asked my husband to make this because I would be home sooner than me on a weeknight.  He doesn't cook and even he could do it. Our 3 year old LOVED it.  We did too.  One change we made was to brown chicken breasts and cube them the night before (for convenience).

My husband loved this. I took the advice of a few others, added cooked egg noodles to the bottom, cooked the chicken in broth, 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup, bay, garlic, onions, a little beer :-) and some seasonings then shredded the meat. I also let everything cool then combined veges and meat with the soups & 1 cup cheese, then topped with with the dry bread crumbs which I tossed w/a little melted butter, pored some of the remaining cooked broth over then topped with cheese & pepper. A few dashes of cayenne mixed in gives it a little zip. This one's a keeper.

Really Good, though I changed some things.  Seasoned and browned the chicken on each side, then added half can of cream of chicken and a can of milk, mixed and let boil, then shreaded chicken.  Steamed thinly sliced carrot and brocoli.  Added veg's, shreaded chicken, remaining 1 and half cans cream of soup and small can of sliced mushrooms (drained) to broth left in pot from chicken.  Mixed all well and placed in dish, topped with cheese and stuffing.  Turned out great and will make this way again soon.

AWESOME recipe.  I used the petite broccoli florets and when the casserole came out of the oven, I pour about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock over it to make it more moist.  A DEFINITE KEEPER!

This was an excellent casserole that my family loved.  I added chopped carrots and fresh sliced mushrooms in addition to the broccoli.  I also poured some of the chicken broth (left over from boiling the chicken) on top of the stuffing after it was spread on top.  This prevented dryness.  Finally, I did not have hardly any cheddar cheese so I laid slices of Muenster (believe it or not) over the whole dish.  It was absolutely delicious!!

This recipe did not tell whether or not to add milk to the can of cream of mushroom soup.  It was extremely dry, and I ended up using a WHOLE box of stuffing as a topper, rather than just a mere cup.  If you're going to make this, make sure you SHRED the chicken, cubing it doesn't work.  Then, MAKE the dang box of stuffing on the stove and top it with that.  ALso, use two cans of cream of mushroom soup, not two, or use a can of cream of chicken soup along with the mushroom to add flavor, as this casserole was DRY DRY DRY.

It was good, but the ingredients needed to be mixed a bit in my opinion.  Mix the broccoli and chicken with the soup/mayo mixture.  And while it was indeed a crunchy topping, it would have been better with a bit of moisture.

An excellent simple recipe that tasted great! I used brown rice at the bottom of my casserole and added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the mushroom sauce ( plus added of cornflour to help maintain that thick consistency). I also substituted the topping with cheese biscuits (like Ritz) - and it was a huge hit with my friends !

Pretty tasty.  I added egg noodles on the bottom layer and that MADE it.  My husband thought it was decent and my 10 month old liked the cheesy broccoli.  I did substitute Club crackers instead of stuffing mix- mmmm, buttery goodness. Thanks!

This dish is always requested of me for get-togethers.  It is so simple and very tasty.  As a variation, I put half Cream of Mushroom and half Cream of Broccoli soup.  Thanks for the great recipe Tracy!

I think this recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I made it one night last week and I ate so much of it because it was so good!  I think it's a great family dish and that everyone would enjoy it.  I can't wait to make it again, but I don't want to spoil it.  Also, it's an easy recipe for anyone to make which is always good.

We thought this was pretty good, we prepared the stuffing and placed on top as directed. I think next time I will reserve some of the dry stuffing and put on top of the prepared stuffing.

My husband liked this more than I did--he really liked it (probably would give it 4 stars), but I thought it was a bit bland.  It was, however, a great way to use up leftovers.  Maybe some tweaking will make it more interesting.

Wonderful Recipe! I also added another can of cream of chicken soup instead of 1. I think it would have been too dry without it. I also nixed the mayo, and used 1/2 can skim milk. I also used fat free cheese which brought down the calories. I used the dressing unprepared which added a nice "crunchy" touch. I would definitely make this recipe again!- Kelli

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I did use frozen broccoli, instead of fresh.  I also made my stuffing according to the package before adding it to the top.  It wasn't too dry or too moist.  Two thumbs up on this one!  I will definitely make it in the future.

This is a delicious caserole! I did do a couple of things differently though. I used a family sized can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and added 2 tablespoons of Mayo instead of 1, and I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to taste in the soup. I also added chicken boullion cubes  while boiling my chicken, then used the broth to make 2 cups of stuffing mix, which I broke up and spread on the top, then I sprinkled dry stuffing lightly over all that.
My husband came home late and ate it cold and STILL raved about it!

Great recipe!  I didn't have chicken breast so I substituted with boneless thigh meat- it turned out wonderful!  I didn't boil the chicken before baking- I just cooked it in the oven 15 minutes longer.  I plan on making this recipe again for my family...it's a winner.

This has become a family favorite already.  Instead of dry stuffing mix sprinkled on top,though, I use a boxed stuffing mix,like Stove-top, make it according to the directions, and then just spread that on top of the rest of the ingredients.  The stuffing mix with wild rice is especially tasty!

I was really excited to try this because all the reviews were so good.  I bought breasts that were already cooked, and just cut them into cube-sized pieces.  What I am not sure about is whether the stuffing should be flavored; i.e. herbed, etc., or unflavored.  Should it be cubed or the more finer choice? Should this be covered when being baked? My husband said he would not die for it again, but once I get these questions answered, I'd be willing to try it again.

It was very good & simple recipe.  I did add 1/2 cup of chicken broth over the top along with almost a 1/2 stick of butter cut up into pats over the whole casserole. Also cooked my chicken breasts & broccoli in my instant pot.

I ended up mixing all the ingredients together, it just didn’t seem to be blending together otherwise.  I also am not a fan of putting dry stuffing mix on top (unless I was doing something wrong).

I was looking for a good casserole that was easy to make. It was definitely easy. But I discovered that it needed more gravy and cheese and less stuffing mix. It was a little dry. Other than that, I will make again!

Not the southern comfort good casserole dish my husband/ I had experienced from other cooks in our childhood and were aiming to replicate. If I make I again, I'm using half the chicken, twice as much cream of mushroom soup, seasoning, three times as much stuffing and slightly more cheese and it's getting mixed together very well. I give 2 stars due to the recipe not actually stating that it's a southern dish. That was my error to not be more specific in recipe selection. Disclaimer: I didn't have brocolli so I used frozen green beans which I steamed prior to baking.

Totally a base recipe. I used crispy fried onions (like those on the top of green bean casseroles) because I had those and some croutons. I thought the onions would bring more flavor. Maybe they did? IDK because I haven't tried stuffing or croutons. Crispy French onions work wonderfully. I followed the recipe but didn't measure anything at all. ~3 chicken breasts ~3 cups broccoli florets. ~1 cup Mexican blended cheese. I used avocado mayo. Halfway through baking I read reviews and added another cupish+ of cheese and another can of cream if mushroom soup. I'm glad I did, it turned out great. Feel free to free ball this recipe. I boiled the chicken in some "better than bouillon" and saved the broth for a later recipe.

I made it according to the recipe.  I found it too dry.  It was not as "creamy" as the picture shows.  Plus, the recipe does not call for salt and I found that the chicken especially needed it.  Plus, they have you layering the ingredients so I found that I could not layer the soup mix very uniformly since it was so thick and some of the chicken did not get any soup.  I would have mixed the chicken and broccoli into the soup and would have added at least 1/4 cup milk to the soup mix.  I will not save this recipe and will not make it again.

I loved this casserole! I used others reviews to get ideas. I did shred the chicken and saved the broth. Using what I had I used cream of broccoli soup as well as broccoli and cheddar soup. Doing this I didn't need to add as much cheese. As another reviewer suggested I stirred everything together rather than layering. When doing that it seemed as though it needed to be saucier and so I added some of the chicken broth. That made a big difference. I dumped it all in an 8x10 dish and finished it off with cheese on top as well as crushed Ritz crackers. I didn't like the idea of stuffing, plus I didn't have any. It turned out.

Dinner was a hit with my family!  I did add more cheese and followed another reviewer's recommendation to use milk instead of mayonnaise.  I also used bread crumbs with seasoning, pepper and Italian seasonings.  Usually I'm not a big fan of recipes using "cream of x soup" because those soups are usually not the healthiest choice, but in this case it was easy and I decided to just go with it!

We loved it!  I did make a few changes.  I cooked the chicken (cut into bite size pieces) with a little butter and chopped onions.  Also used cream of chicken soup vs. mushroom.  Added a small amount of milk to the soup mixture.  Mixed everything together vs. layering.  Added cheese to the base as well as on top.  Definitely on our list for the future.

How many times do the people on this site have to be told to rate a recipe on it’s own merit. I don’t know if it’s an ego thing or what, but it’s insulting to the poster. If you make changes then post it under your own name. Personally I scroll past every review that has changed the recipe. This one was good as written

I followed the other reviews and modified as follows:
Boiled chicken in chicken broth, used frozen cut broccoli, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, omitted the mayo & added 1/2 cup of milk. I also precooked the stuffing & mixed everything all together. It was a hit with my husband & in-laws!

I've made my own version of this for years.  I don't use the soup or mayo though.  In a large bowl I combine everything together & add @ 2 Cups of chicken broth (enough to moisten the stuffing mix).  I usually double the stuffing (2 boxes) & increase the cheese to @ 2- to  2&1/2 Cups  shredded or cubed cheddar cheese.   One of our go to favorite recipes.

I used a leftover rotisserie chicken from the night before, I used a can of string beans with the broccoli due to not enough of the broccoli and I also added about 4 tablespoons of sour cream and 1/4 cup of whole milk.  It was delicious....

The flavour was Great! Next time I would add another can of soup, probably cream of chicken to add to the mushroom. 
It was a bit on the dry side.

I made this with the tips from jojomama (most helpful and positive review). I can see why she used milk instead of the mayo, because of the dryness. I also used a smaller baking dish than the 9 x 13, and only 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. I did not have the stuffing, but I crumbled up a very small amount of dried French fried onions on top. It seems that it could be a very versatile recipe used with perhaps cauliflower, too, or maybe some rice. Nice recipe.

I boiled my chicken (in chunks) with chicken broth for more flavor. I also used stove top instead. I'd make it again, it just feels like it's missing something. I'm going to read more reviews to see what I could add. Obviously it has all the food groups, I served it with corn on the cob.

This was super easy and came in handy to help get rid of a can of chicken and part of a rotisserie I had on hand.  I didn't have broccoli, so I subbed green peas and added onion and some fresh mushrooms.  I also felt like it needed rice or pasta, so I used a gluten free white cheddar shells and cheese mix  and added the powder straight to the mix.  It made a large casserole dish full and was given two thumbs up by the family.

This is a super easy recipe. As with any recipe, you can tweak it to make it your own. I use a bag of frozen "florentine" vegetables (broccoli/cauliflower/carrots mix). Instead of stuffing, I use Durkee fried onions. I've never used mayo, but I use a family-sized can of cream of mushroom soup (or you can use 2 cans of soup). 

I prep the chicken differently. I cook the chicken chunks in a skillet with olive oil and salt/pepper. (I think that boiled chicken would lose flavor.) You can also just partially nuke the chicken with salt and pepper. No need to cook the chicken all the way through as it will also cook while you bake it. 

I agree with everyone - just mix everything together instead of layering. I use 2 cups of cheddar cheese and 2 cups of fried onions: 1 cup of each for when you mix everything. Then at the last 10 minutes of baking, sprinkle the remaining cheese and onions over the top. I also serve over white rice. Yum!

I used some other viewers suggestions... Didn't boil the chicken; instead pan seared it with S&P & EVOO, cooked a whole box of stuffing, used 2 cans of condensed soup (cream of chicken & cream of mushroom), subbed half a cup of milk for the mayo, and mixed all ingredients (cubed chicken, sautéed broccoli, stuffing, soups & cheese) together in a big bowl prior to baking. Fantastic! Served with a side of brown rice.

Like others, I changed the recipe.  I did the following, used 2 cans of soup (my daughter wants me to use cream of chicken next time but for this version I used cream of mushroom), used half a can of milk (2%) in place of mayo and only used 6 oz of shredded cheese (reserving 2 oz for the top).  I brined the chicken, cut it into chunks and fried the chicken until done with just a little browning on the edges.  Besides these changes I also mixed everything together when ready.  I steamed the broccoli to just under done so it would not get mushy.  It turned out good.  I don't like changing recipes and then reviewing because it's not true to the original.  The chef should not be disappointed, this community took a reasonable recipe and helped shape it into several variations.  I thank the chef for their original post as it gave me a much needed starting point.  Had I followed the original recipe I'm confident I would have enjoyed the dish just the same.

Maybe with a smaller baking dish this would have worked better, but with the 9/13 it was really shallow. Still tasty though.

This is a great base recipe to be modified to taste. After following all of these directions (but adding cauliflower to the broccoli and using a deboned rotisserie chicken) I almost wished I had added a second can of soup.  After the 25 minutes I stirred EVERYTHING and then added a blend of cheddar and Mexican cheese and a healthy dusting of pepper and salt on top, then melted in the oven for a few minutes. Now it's amazing!!!

I used a store bought roasted chicken, used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom,  no mayo but 3/4 cup of milk, stove top stuffing including spices in box, added a can of corn,  mixed all ingredients together with other ingredients in recipe,  and cooked for about 1 hour at 350 degrees.  Absolutely delicious!!

This was so simple and easy to make, and it was a huge hit for my family! It was delicious. The only thing I would change about it would be to use maybe some bread crumbs or to at least grind the dry stuffing up (I didn't, although I should have), it was too hard on my teeth. Other than that small change, it was perfect!

Very tasty.  I marinaded my chicken in sweet onion salad dressing overnight because I had time and used breadcrumbs instead of stuffing because I was out and it still turned out very well.

seems very dry.  was the soup supposed to be reconstituted?  I still see 'blobs' of cream soup on top of the other ingredients.  not appetizing.  I splashed some chicken stock over it and stirred it, then salted and peppered
I also had added sautéed celery (2 stalks and some green onion, 2) in butter before baking.

The suggestions others made would have improved this considerably, next time I should read those first.  The chicken tasted great, but my first future revision would be to pre cook the stuffing on top so there weren't unappetizing crumbly bits that stayed hard and dry.

I followed the recipe exactly. At its base it is a good recipe, but it needs work. There wasn't enough moisture with just one can of the soup. I recommend adding another one. Next time I make it, I'm thinking of adding in onion, garlic, and spices cause it was a little on the bland side.

So, I didn't exactly make this. I took the idea, and ingredients (took away the stuffing, and I used cream of CHICKEN AND MUSHROOM instead of the plain 'ol cream of mushroom) and put it all on a pillsbury pizza crust, put some sweet baby rays BBQ sauce over that, and topped it off  with "Flavor God- Chipotle" seasoning, jalapeno cheddar and parmesan cheese. **heavy breathing**

I love it!!! I used 1/2 Swiss and 1/2 cheddar that was what I had.  I made bread cubes from 3 slices of gluten free bread in the oven while I was preheating it up. Mixed it all up and threw the cornflakes on top! So good! Thanks for the great recipe. My husband says thanks as well!!

Made this last night and everyone loved it. I didn't boil the chicken. I used fresh cut up breasts fried in oil with seasonings (I use alot of seasonings in most of my recipes so nothing is bland) and mixed the chicken and broccoli in with the soup, topped with cheese and dry stuffing mix. Probably will try it with cooked stuffing on top next time. Thanks for a quick delicious meal on a busy weeknight.

As it is, this recipe is very dry.  The cream of mushroom soup needs either milk or condensed milk added to the mixture.

We had a great time with this one. We'd put out chicken in the crock pot (actually about three pounds worth), seasoned as I would normally with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, then let it cook.  I put the broccoli in the steamer bag and let the microwave work on that for me.  I did omit the mayo and added a little milk instead to the soup.  Instead of the stuffing mix, I used panko bread crumbs, Italian seasoning mix and some of the cheddar cheese on top.  Baked up perfectly.

I make this all the time, we call it Chicken Divan, I boil the chicken and when I layer it on the bottom I add salt, pepper and season salt. I also do not add mayo. but I do 2 cans of soup/w a tsp of chicken broth(the powder) makes it a lil more creamier. I also make the stuffing I do not add it dry. the more cheese the better. This is a family favorite and it is so good reheated(if there are any left overs.)

As a base to a more complex casserole I'd give it 4 stars but as is it's just a 3. It's a good recipe for a beginner cook but for someone like myself who's made a casserole or two in their time it's just too plain. After reading several reviews I went to work. I ended up with something totally different than the original but here goes: I chose not to layer the ingredients after reading the other reviews.In a big mixing bowl I added cubed chicken (5 small breasts)but I chose to leave it raw(I find that precooking meat makes it too dry later on) then I added 2 generous Tablespoons of Italian seasoning, 1 fresh green bell pepper, 2 small cans of mushrooms, some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots from a frozen mix(still frozen), 1 can of cream of chicken and a can of Campbell's broccoli-chicken-cheese-potato soup. I didn't have cream of mushroom and I never cook with mayo!! Once it was all well mixed I put it in a greased baking dish and put it in the oven at 350 for half an hour. Then I pulled it out and added a layer of Mexican blend shredded cheese and a box of ALREADY PREPARED Stovetop Stuffing(that I prepared while I waited). Tossed it back in the oven until the cheese was melted and the chicken just cooked through. In the end it was nothing like the original recipe but it tasted pretty good. The kids wouldn't touch it so there were plenty of leftovers for my husband and me for lunches.

Since there were so many helpful hints, I incorporated them into this recipe.  Broccoli and cauliflower, mixed some sour cream into the mushroom soup/mayo mix (glad I did this or would have been too dry) and mixed the stuffing and cheddar with a sprinkling of cheddar on top.  Also poached the chicken in water with poultry seasoning.

I have never contributed before but this is a recipe that I have been serving for a very long time and when the kids come home they always request this dish. When I am doing it for a special dinner I don't worry about the calories but for a regular meal I always use the light soup and Mayo.
I have been making this recipe for 35.

Used two cans of soup and increased the stuffing. This was an easy and excellent dish. My husband and I could have eaten the whole casserole. Will definitely make again and share this recipe with my "what to make for dinner" friends.

This recipe was easy and delicious!  The direction to boil the chicken was fantastic, it turned out perfectly.  It's creamy, and has just the right amount of crunch mixed with meat and veggies.

Next time I will use a smaller pan.  I sprinkled the top with bread crumbs instead of stuffing which is probably why it looked so thin in the 12 X 18 pan.  I will also take the advice of other reviewers and pan fry the chicken, add onions (green onions sound like a really good idea) and thin the soup with milk rather than mayonnaise.  My menfolk liked it and i'll keep the recipe with my revisions.

This recipe was great. I used 3 small zucchinis and an eggplant roasted in the oven first with salt and olive oil, instead of broccoli. I used chicken thighs (1.7lbs) and 2 cans of mushroom soup. For cheese, I used a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. My husband loved it.

Loved it! I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of broccoli because I don't like the mushroom flavor. I loved this dish and it was only 20.00 for a full dish for a family of 6!!

This is pretty good! I didn't have much time so I used the pre-cooked chicken from the store and sprinkled on a little dried garlic. It was a hit at the supper table with a nice salad. I'll definitely make this again. Even my daughter that doesn't like broccoli admitted that it was pretty good. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I liked it a lot and the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that it was a little bit bland.  Still, it is definitely worth making again, and goes from freezer to oven very, very well.  I made it exactly as directed.

This casserole was ok.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of broccoli cheese soup with about 1/4 cup of 1/2 n 1/2 and a tablespoon of sour cream.  I mix all these together with the stuffing.  My concern was it would be to dry.  I sauteed my chicken breast and added it to the mixture and poured it over the broccoli.  It did come out a little drier than I liked.  Guess I'm not much of a casserole person and this dish didn't change my mind.

The recipe as is, is really good.  The second time around however, I decided to add in cauliflower (the steam in bag cauliflower & Cheese), and a little extra cream of mushroom soup.  I omitted the dry stuffing topping, and instead topped with french fried onions. I baked as directed, but after baking I tossed with egg noodles.  Makes a really good dish, even better.  I can also see adding peas to the mix for even more veggies.  Definately a recipe I will be making again in the future!

It was easy to prepare but not something I would make again.  Even though I used MORE soup than recipe called for it was still dry and rather flavorless.

I made this last night...this recipe needs A LOT of work!  It's a good starting point, but if I make this again I will add more cheese, salt & pepper, other spices, and use Pepperidge Farm Stuffing that comes in the blue bag, topped with 1 stick of melted butter and a cup of chicken broth.  :)

I make a close variation of this often: cream of chicken soup and cubed bread instead of the stuffing mix, although I have used the stuffing mix.  I usually use about 1/4 cup of milk in the soup as well.  
I didn't have enough broccoli when I made it this week so I preboiled some carrots and a little bit of cauliflower and added along with the broccoli.  IT WAS DELICIOUS and I may make it this way all the time now.  Oh, I also add about a teaspoon of curry spice!  (I'm a throw things together kind of cook)

I add mild curry 1/2-1 tsp. to taste to the soup, and then place buttered bread cubes on the top before baking.

I have made this recipe for many years but I changed it a bit,used frozen mixed vege's,no mayo,or cheese or dry stuffing mix just browned the chicken,added soup mixture with frozen vege's some garlic and one half can of water or wine,excellent recipe,hubby loves it and it is easy for him to chew(especially without teeth).I also sub the breasts for thighs,they seem to have more flavor!!

Try this cream of celery soup if you are not a fan of mushrooms, just as good.  I also cook the broccoli a little longer, as I have one that is not a fan of,to hide it in the dish. I sometimes add a pinch of curry for more flavour.

I made the recipe for the 1st time & it was wonderful. My children & husband absolutely loved it. I do have a few tips though. I put bread crumbs on the bottom then poured a little chicken broth on them. Started layering adding more cheese in each layer. At the top put bread crumbs & poured broth on top of it all. It was so moist.

After reading all the glowing reviews on this website I decided to give this casserole a try.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it looked much better than it tasted.  I used some of the additions like italian seasoning and milk from other reviewers but that really didn't help much.  Overall, it just wasn't that appealing or tasty.      Although it wouldn't be as fast, making this with a homemade cream sauce built from a roux might give this a desperately needed lift.  I used Campbells Cream of Chicken soup and couldn't get past the tinny canned flavor that permeated everything.  I'd give this 4 stars for ease of preparation but 2 for flavor.  I won't be making this one again.

Will wonders never cease!!  My husband liked this - even had 2 servings.  I did use Broccolini instead of broccoli, which is milder in flavor.  When I told him we were having Broccolini, he wasn't too happy - thinking Broccoli.  This was the first time I had ever eaten 'lini', also.  Will use that in place of Broccoli when I can get it.  I did add too much Parmesan cheese (from a custom recipe) which made it too salty for me, but he didn't notice; also omitted the chicken, as I had previously marinated it with a sauce for grilling.  Will keep this recipe and use again.

I followed recommendations from other cooks and skipped the mayo. I also skipped boiling the veggies before baking because I like my broc crisp and vibrant green. I put in some nice asparagus cut into small chunks and some diced onion too. This one is a keeper with good variation possibilities.

Follow a few of the suggestions from jojojomama and this is excellent. I only used one can of soup (Campbell's Cream of Chicken & Mushroom). I also cut back slightly on the cheese--personal preference.  Flavor gets even better the next day.

Great comfort food.  I did not have stuffing mix so I used 1 cup bread crumbs mixed with 1/4c butter.  Like other reviews I used 2 cans of soup and milk, no mayo.   I also added fresh sliced mushrooms. I added McCormick Steak seasoning to the mixture.  I love McCormick steak seasoning on everything but it is especially good with mushroom soup mixtures.  With my additions it was 5 stars.

You have to add another can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken to make this creamy.  Also adding a little milk will help if you want it creamy.  I also like others added crushed garlic, onions, and ground ginger to the soup mixture.

So YUMMY!!!  I followed other suggestions and used 2 cans of cream of chicken and a can of milk.  I sprinkled a little cheese on top of the broccoli mixture then stir in  a little more to the stuffing. I cooked brown rice to go along with it.  PERFECT!

I think this is a great little meal. Cooked up some chicken tenderloins in a skillet with chicken broth and some seasoning, cooked the stuffing, and like other ratings suggested I just mixed it all with the soup (I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccoli). I nixed the mayo, and was (OOOPS) out of milk, so I added a little chicken broth and water to thin the mixture up. I added some basil, onion powder, garlic sat, and italian seasoning, and loaded with cheddar cheese. Baked until bubbly..and parfait! Excellent, tastes wonderful. With the modifications this is a GREAT recipe, thanks!

Made with light sour cream instead of mayo and drizzled the bread crumbs with 2T. butter.  No changes otherwise but I did serve it over chicken rice a roni.  Family loved it.  Thx.

Great recipe. 4 stars only because my toddler didn't love it, but he's picky anyway. We prefer more veggies/less meat, so I used 2 chicken breasts from a precooked whole BBQ chicken from Costco (super cheap), took off the skin. Added 1 cup frozen veggies to go with the broccoli as well. Used other suggestions of no mayo, using 1 can cr of chicken + 1 can cr of mushroom, 3/4 cup milk. Also added 1 clove minced garlic. Mixed all together. Sprinkled cheese & Stove Top stuffing on top. Baked for 20 min (no raw meat in it). Turned out great! DH & myself loved it.

This is a great "base" recipe to add your own modifications, but that's the joy of cooking. You don't always have to follow a recipe to the tee. I did end up following the advice of others & adding a can of cream of chicken soup and replacing the mayo with 1/2 a can of milk. I also added 1/2 uncooked rice and just sprinkled the dry stuffing mix on top. Baked at 325 for 1 hr 15 min (to allow for the rice to cook).

This recipe was very good. We sauteed the chicken with onions and garlic before adding it to the dish and baking. Will remain a staple in our dinner calendar.

Rated 4 stars as I altered recipe a little based on others' suggestions. not a big fan of mayo, so i used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and milk. instead of boiling the chicken, i sauteed chicken tenders (that's what i had) on the stovetop, let cool, and then cut into chunks. if you season your chicken, i wouldn't add a whole lot of salt becuase with the soup and the stuffing, i thought the dish had enough salt. i also went ahead and prepared the stuffing, let it cool, and then sprinkled it on top. It was SOOOOO yummy! I think as the recipe is written, would still good, but i think the mayo would make it too rich for my taste. great simple recipe that takes little preparation. the hubby loved it as well!

This was just okay for me. I found the texture to be a little mushy for me and flavor was pretty obviously cream of mushroom soup.

This recipe was alright but nothing special.  I used cream of broccoli instead since my husband hates cream of mushroom, and that seemed to work fine.  Overall, it was just a little dry for me.

My family loved this as did I. I did not use 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup as suggested by other reviewers. Instead, I added 8 ounces of sourcream to the soup and mayo mixture. (don't do this unless you really like sour cream) But, 1 can of COM is definately not enough. Also, I used corn bread stuffing on top, cooked the broccoli in chicken broth, seasoned my chicken with garlic, old bay, and a little salt. SUPER!

This was just average to me. I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed everything up, but it just seemed like a weird starchy mixture of chicken and broccoli mush. I prefer to have various flavors and textures in my meals...maybe it's an Italian thing...but this was just too uniform for me in flavor and texture. I will give it points for being easy though. A decent kid-friendly recipe.

This is a yummy recipe but definitely needs 2 cans of soup. I prefer cream of chicken, or cream or broccoli or mix the two. I DON'T omit the mayo as someone suggested, it needs the little bit of tang that the mayo brings.  I also add in salt, pepper and some sage or poultry seasoning to the soup mixture.  This is a perfect way to use up leftover chicken and broccoli.

Made this with vegetarian "chicken" (worthington canned) and a layer of rice, and found it quite tasty.   Per other reviewers, I added a cup of milk rather than mayonnaise but stuck to the one can of cream of mushroom soup. Added sauteed onion, bell pepper, celery leaves, and garlic, along with a teaspoon each dried oregano, thyme, and paprika to boost the flavor. Topped with crunched Ritz crackers and grated sharp cheddar. YUM!  Note: the use of frozen chopped broccoli meant there were occasional bits of peeling that truly detracted, but overall this was a nice comforting dish.

I've made this recipe several times now and it is always great.  I use the following changes from other reviewers: add an extra can of soup, sub 3/4 cup milk for the mayo, make the stuffing ahead of time, and mix everything all together adding some extra cheese to the top.

I gave this recipe five stars because it's very versitile. I first used this a few years ago when my husband and I got married. It was easy and tasted great. Over the years I've gotten a little more daring with my meals and this option has been pushed to the back of the box but I recently pulled it out again. With a few simple modifications I think it becomes a fantastic meal. * I boiled the chicken in 1 can of broth 1/2 can of cream of chicken 1/4 cup water chopped clove garlic, chopped small white onion, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp pepper, 2 tbsp italian seasoning and paprika  When the chicken is tender it remove it from the mix and toss in the broccoli and boil until tender. Mix your boil to 1 can of mushroom soup(or cheddar if prefered) and 3/4 cups of milk. Mix broccoli, chicken and soup mixture into pan and layer with bread crumbs and cheddar jack cheese.  Serve with mashed or au graten potatoes and I gurantee you'll have a fantastic meal.

This was very good, but a little dry. Next time I will add another can of soup or maybe a jar of chicken gravy! It was easy too. This one is going into the rotation for sure.

This recipe is very good and very versitile. I didn't measure anything. Used left over thanksgiving turkey and mixed everything together--2 cans of cream soup, some milk, cheese, stuffing mix, broccoli and assorted spices that i grabbed from my pantry! Cooked mine in a 8x8 baking dish topped with more stuffing mix. Quick and easy weeknight dinner and a great way to use up left over chicken or turkey.

The whole family gobbled this down!  I followed jojojomama's recommendations except I did boil the chicken in chicken broth, salt & pepper.  I also added mushrooms and about 2 cloves of garlic to the soup mixture.  It was such a hit!  Recommended.

This was ok, a little to salty for me.  I think using something like cracker crumbs on top or mashed potoatoes would taste better.  The bottom layer was great, the stuffing made it to salty.

I made this for the first time tonight and it came out pretty good.  I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, it added nice flavor to the casserole.  I was not sure if my husband would like it, but he did!

just made this tonight for me and my boyfriend. he said it was good, we both got seconds!!

made some changes that were suggested with in others' reviews. i put 3/4 milk instead of mayo- felt healthier BUT it did end up a little watery than i expected. 

i also put a clove of garlic, pinch of garlic and little bit of onion powder.

with the condensed soup - it was quite salty /savory so eat it with white rice or pasta!!!

This is really yummy.  The only change i made was to omit the mayo and replaced it with a little milk and i mixed it all to together before cooking and sprinkled some of the breadcrumbs on top.  A hit with all the family.

Loved it! Very Easy! I used some of the spices suggested and since i boiled my chicken and didn't fry it with the paprika, i just added it and it added a nice flavor. i also mixed in cornflakes throughout the dish and then put more bread crumbs on the top! I served it over noodles and all 5 of us loved it!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used 3 large chicken breasts and it worked just as well. I also ended up using a whole bag of shredded cheese, because my husband loves it (1/2 bag in the mixture, 1/2 bag on top). I mixed everything together before putting it in the dish, as other reviewers suggested. The first time, I put just a few french friend onions on top along with breadcrumbs, and it was delicious. The second time, I completely covered the top with the french fried onions and it was just too much. I won't put as many next time. Anyway, great recipe! We'll make it again, for sure!

Loved this, although I do substitute a little as others do.  I only had canned chicken breasts and used that (2 cans), which I only use in soups or casseroles.  The canned pieces flake apart like canned tuna, so I stir eveything together in a bowl and then put it in the baking dish.  I also did not have the stuffing mix so I used a sleeve of butter crackers with a little melted butter drizzled on top.  Great comfort food!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I only rated this 3 stars since I had to change it so much, but the end product was delicious!

I used a combo of tips from the other reviews. We like crisper, dryer cassaroles.
-Cook the box of stuffing and set aside about a cup for the topping.
-I used about a 3/4 can of mushrom soup and 3/4 container of sour cream. No mayo or milk.
-Sauteed broccoli and fresh mushrooms for a few minutes. Cooked chiken in frying pan with olive oil.
-Mix all ingredients adding cheese. Top with more cheese and the rest of the stuffing and cook till heated through.

My husband loved it and he usually doesn't like my cooking. :-p

I cooked the stuffing and mixed all the ingredients together rather than layering.  I omitted the mayonaise and used 2 cans of low fat condensed soups.  The broccoli adds a lot of nutrient value, and this made for a good dish.

I normally only post comments when I really like a dish.  However, I was sadly disappointed with this one.  I thought the kids would love it which is why I made it but neither one of them would touch it and we wound up ordering pizza and the casserole was thrown out.  I'm sorry; just not our thing I guess.

I made this last night for myself and my husband. I read serveral reviews and used a lot of those suggests. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and milk instead of mayo. I made the stuffing and then mixed the chicken, broc, and soup mix together. Put the cheese on top of that and the stuffing on top of that, then breadcrumbs. It was really good! I'm new in the dinner cooking department (save speghetti and mac and cheese!) and my husband actually like it! We did decide that the next time we try this, we will mkae a couple changes. 2 boxes of stuffing for sure (I know someone already suggested that) and maybe a different kind of soup. The chicken was really strong. I would also add some garlic. A great start though! Thanks for this recipe.

The adults didn't really care for this.  The taste was ok but nothing we'd want again.  On the other hand, my two young boys loved it so maybe I'll make much smaller portions in the future for them.

This was very tasty and went over well with the hubby, however, next time I will make sure to mix the stuffing mix into the soup, instead of sprinkling it on top.

Amazing as always!  This has been my go-to recipe for years.  Last night it saved me again.  I had a group of friends coming over and no time to cook.  This is super easy and always a hit.  Pair with a salad and garlic bread for a little extra.  The recipe is great as is, but over the years I've learned a couple things.  1.  Use two cans of soup and milk instead of mayo.  I forgot the extra can last night.  I usually add extra broc and couldn't do it bc not enough sauce.  Still excellent.  2.  If you have time, pan fry or grill the chicken.  It gives much better flavor than boiling (although no one ever complained when all I did was boil).  One time I even bought precooked chicken (like the salad kind) and it was great.  3.  If you prepare ahead and refrigerate (which is a big time saver, not that this takes long to begin with) you'll need to bake for 1.5 hours to get it to temp.  It takes longer to cook, but it's great to get home from work and just pop it in the oven.  Good Luck!  Your guests will enjoy.  Mine always do :)

Definitely a keeper! I have found that with any casserole calling for a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, I replace approximately half of the can with a mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream... it just adds something different... a little more tang and richness. This recipe definitely benefits from the added ingredients.

This was a great dish, even one that my 12 month old enjoyed too! However, I never usually boil my chicken so I wasn't sure how long to do so and I think I cooked it a little too long and so the chicken was just slightly overdone.  Other than my own mishap, the combination of flavors was excellent and we had a dinner the whole family enjoyed! I'll definitely make again!

Great recipe to start with.  I also omitted the mayo and added milk and an extra can of cream of mush. I also added some fresh mushrooms because I needed to use them up.
I also added basil, italian seasonings and pepper to taste.

I also make a version of this recipe. Instead of using mayonaise, I use Miracle whip to give it that extra twang and also add a little bit of lemon juice. Instead of using dry stuffing I use crumbled Ritz crackers, which I don't like Ritz crackers personally, but they really don't taste the same when used like this. At first, while a girl in my home-ec class was making this, I was thinking... That's interesting... but using her receipe, it is really good and not bland at all! My husband and i enjoy it as well as our family when they come over for dinner!

Good recipe. I followed a lot of the tips below in other reviews and would also caution to only add cheese to the top layer as suggested. My husband dumped a bunch on not leaving enough for the top and it made it more gooey. The fist batch we made with all the cheese on the top was wonderful and crispy. Yum!

I used two cans of soup, no mayo. It could use adding a little milk, also.  I used croutons on top and extra cheese, extra spices, too.  Family likes it.  I will make this often.

Our all time favorite dish! One thing I do differently is sprinkle lemon pepper all over the chicken...tastes great!

I used pheasant and added extra minced garlic and seasoned with Monterey Chicken Grill spice. I used a 8x11 inch pan as I didn't have quite as much pheasant as the chicken it called for.

This would even taste good without the meat.

So easy and so delicious!  My husband said he wants this often.  I used italian bread crumbs as the topping and drizzled a little combination of a total tsp of butter/EVOO on top.  Probably great just the way the recipe reads too!

Used 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup milk instead of mayo as others suggested. I thought it was a little too soupy. I also did as others suggested and mixed everything together and topped with bread crumbs.

We thought that it was delicious and easy to make.  We thought it was good the first day but we actually liked it way better the second day.  That is why we rated it a four.

Used milk instead of mayo. This was fairly good, much better after it had a chance to set. The consistency just wasn't what I expected but it tasted good.

This is a great starter recipe. It has all the basics but definitly needs some adjustments. I didn't boil the chicken. I cooked it on the stove with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and 4-5 cloves of minced garlic. Instead of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken. I also substituted cream of celery soup for the mayonaisse. Then I sprinkled the top with Italian style bread crumbs in place of the stuffing mix.With these changes I would rate it 4 1/2 stars. Thanks for the great start.

As with other comments, I used 2 cans of mushroom soup with 1/2 milk instead of the mayo. I mixed the stuffing with everything else instead of layering and I used crushed garlic croutons on top. Very tasty!

This is a good base recipe, but it is a little bland.  I seasoned the chicken before baking it and added garlic & dried minced onion to the soup mix and it was still lacking.  Although I will make this again, next time I'm really going to kick up the seasoning in the soup sauce.

The stuffing stayed dry and uncooked never absorbing any liquid, there was WAY more broccoli than I expected and not enough chicken. I might try this again next year.

This recipe was great. The only change I made was I mixed everything in a bowl instead of layering it and I added about 1/2 cup milk. Will make this again for sure.

I did not think this was that great. I think in general my family does not like casseroles made with condensed soups, they always seem salty. The reviews were good so I tried it, it was OK—just not one of our favs.

This was just ok. Followed the recepie but did not read sugestions from others. I thought it would be dry also and thought about using cream of chicken soup with a little milk, as I do not like the taste of mushroom soup but thought the broccoli and cheese would cover up that taste for me? Husband went back for seconds, he was starving, but said he would not ask me to make it again. Will not make this again, sorry, I have made at least 15 recipies from this site that had good reviews and this is the first one I did not like at all.

I'm not sure what but something was a little much in this casserole BUT my bf loved it snd it was easy and I will defintley make it again making some changes.  First I made the chicken on the stove top with 1/4 tsp paprika and steamed the broccoli.  Then I mixed together a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of potato (99% fat free) soups with 1/8 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp garlic, and 1/8 tsp italian seasonings, and 3/4 c skim milk then I threw in the chicken and broccoli and 1 cup dry stuffing mix, and 1 cup cheddaer cheese shredded.  I mixed it all up and put it in a 9x13" baking dish.  I then sprinked cheese and breadcrumbs on top.  It came out good but next time I think I will prepare the stuffing first to thicken up the whole thing.

Agreed it is a good base recipe. I added healthy request crm of mush and crm of chix & 2% cheese, omitted mayo. Mixed everything in a large bowl (thought layering it was pointless and didnt want dried crunchy stuffing on top.) Added some garlic! Pretty good, not something i will make often though!

Made this last night doubled the recipe. It was great ut next time I'm going to triple the mushroom soup. The stuffing sprinkled on top really made the meal... Served it over white rice. Tip-boil the chicken in chicken broth and spices to give it more flavor..

This recipe would have been a lot better if I had followed the recipe exactly. I read the other reviews and I added cream of chicken & cream of mushroom soup, (which was a good suggestion) but instead of using boneless skinless chicken breasts, I used whole chicken leg quarters. I think that is where I went wrong. My family absolutely LOVED it but I ended up taking a few bites then resorting to some leftovers. I will try this recipe again but for now on I think I will start follwing the recipes exactly and then make my own judgements.

This is a great start to a recipe. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, added cooked sliced onion, minced garlic, and a bit of cheddar to the soup mixture. I used 3/4 of a soup can of milk instead of mayo, and used a heaping spoonful of sour cream. Also added some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash Garlic n Herb to the soup. I Cooked the box of stuffing mix first. Layered everything and toped with more cheese. Everyone loved it. Next time I will try French fried onions as a topping. Thanks for the great base recipe!

Bland! This needs more cheese or something... I layed the broccoli on the bottom and mixed everything else and spread that on top of the broccoli. (I doubled the soup-mayo-cheese-stuffing)Don't think I could have eaten it if I had not added a lot of salt/pepper at the table. It's a good base but needs flavor. Cooked about 45 min.

This is yummy. I acidently mixed the cheese in with the soup mixture so it didn't look as nice but it tasted great. I would recommend mixing cheese in with the soup and puting it on top as well, that would be good!

WOW, we couldn't stop eating this; delish!! I browned skinless, boneless chicken thighs because they're not quite so expensive and not as dry. I also added 2 Tbsp. of Mayo, 2 Tbsps of sour cream, and a dash each of Hy's seasoning salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, thyme and an extra 1/3 c. of grated cheese to the mushroom soup mixture.  Next time I will saute onions and fresh mushrooms to add to the chicken layer.  I made a pan for my neighbor and they raved about it also. This was SOOOOOO  GOOOD.

I agree with above though, to mix all together and then bake, my husband said it tastes like a chicke pot pie without the crust!

I really liked this recipe as did the rest of the family.  I wasn't sure that all the kids would eat it because of the brocolli, but they loved it.  I am always looking for new recipes to try and this was a hit.  Will definetly make this one again.

Pretty tasty! I took other people's advice and didn't precook the broccoli. I just cooked the dish a little longer to make sure the broccoli was cooked all the way. I also used 2 cans of C.O.M. soup with about 3/4 cups of milk and 2 tablespoons of mayo. I think the only thing I would change would be to add more of the topping. There wasn't enough for my taste. Great recipe for kids! My son loves casseroles.

This is an excellent dish. I'm not at all a fan of mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup. I have to say I was surprised how good the recipe is.

I thought this turned out tasting a bit too "soupy".  It looked and smelled great, but didn't taste good enough for me to make this again.  I do commonly use canned soups as a base for casseroles, but it just didn't work for me in this particular recipe.

Well, let's see. I probably could have chopped up my broccoli into smaller pieces (used a bag of Broccoli Wokly from the store, which comes in giant mutant florets), but otherwise...I have to say I really enjoyed this dish. My fiance also really liked it - his comment was "Chicken, broccoli, cheese and stuffing, all good." I think next time I might cook the stuffing first and put it over the top as a crust, but there were no complaints from either of us. Thanks!

My family loved this casserole. I mixed chicken, soup and cheese then layered with more cheese and stuffing.  This made the chicken even more juicy and tender.

THIS RECIPE WAS SO SIMPLE, THE WHOLE PREP TIME WAS LESS THEN TEN MINUTES FOR ME...I ALSO TWEAKED IT A LITTE PER OTHER SUGGESTIONS, I USED ROASTED GARLIC ITALIAN STYLE STOVETOP INSTEAD OF JUST PLAIN STUFFING MIXTURE AND THEN SAUTED MUSHROOMS GARLIC AND ONION ADDED MUCH FLAVOR,THEN ADDED HALF A CAN OF MILK AND A TABLESPOON OF SOUR CREAM TO MAKE IT CREAMER. LASTLY I ALSO MIXED EVERYTHING INTO ONE BOWL AND THEN TOPPED THE ENTIRE THING IN MOZZERELLA. YUMMY, THANKS FOR THE A SUPER EASY RECIPE!

I am so glad I read the other reviews first. I boiled my chicken with 2 low sodium chicken bouillon cubes.  I omited the mayo and added 2/3 c. milk, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, and 1/8 tsp pepper.  I then used 1 1/2 cup of the water that I boiled my chicken in to premoistened my stuffing (which was boxed chicken flavor). The next time I make this I am going to double the stuffing and mix up the veggies.

Definitely mix all the ingredients together, including most of the stuffing, and top with a little bit of it and the cheese. Otherwise the stuffing stays super dry on top.

Not a bad recipe. I used chicken chunks instead and added some other stuff like potato, plantain and carrots. Didn't use the cream of chicken and the mayo but used some half and half. Topped with cheese, breadcrumbs and paprika. Came out great and was delicious.

Very good!  I also left out the mayo and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  I added more seasonings, and mixed it all together in a bowl, then dumped in baking dish, and topped with bread crumbs and extra cheese.

this was just alright.  there was no 'zing' to it.  family didn't like the stuffing in it.  possibly a good "base recipe" and i might try it again with many alterations.  maybe omit stuffing, stir in some cooked rice, add a handful of sharp white cheese.....  we'll see.

MMMMM YUMMY!  As others suggested, I substituted the mayonaise with 2/3 cup of milk.  I also added some garlic, paprika, and basil.  Very happy with the results and will definitely make it again.

This is just simply delicious. I had never boiled chicken before.  I used the large can of cream of mushroom soup, as I like a lot of sauce.  Other than that; didn't change a thing.
Thank you!!!!

I have made this recipe a few times now.  This time I substituted cream of chicken soup and colby cheese.  Next time I might spice it up with garlic and a few onions, but this is an easy, yummy recipe.

Quick, easy, delicious. I some of the advice below and added one can cream of chicken soup. I also mixed all ingredients together, spread in casserole dish, and topped w/ bread crumbs. We served it over rice. Will definitely make this again, especially when time is of the essence.

Good, overall.  I used 1 can each cream of chicken, cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli soup and omitted the mayo.  The stuffing on top of mine came out a little crunchy, next time I will make croutons on the stove top and mix them in with the   other ingredients.  Also, I cut up the chicken first and baked it alone for 20 minutes with Mrs. Dash original blend before adding everything else - it added a good little flavor.

I don't usually make casseroles but this was excellent! There were more steps than I'd hoped for since I was looking for something simple. Next time I make it I will do it after we have leftover chicken so as to not have to go through that separate step. Oh and I used others suggestions about the two cans of soup, whole box of stuffing, boiled the chicken in stock, used reserved stock to moisten stuffing, frozen broccoli. Looking forward to making this again soon with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving this time.

This is an excellent and quick recipe to make especially if you prepare your chicken the night before.  I actually ran out of creamed soups to use and instead mixed up some sour cream, a bit of mayo and my favorite store bought barbeque sauce and it was excellent!!  I may do it like that all the time now instead of using the soup.

I was hungry for a good chicken casserole, so I did a google search and found this website and recipe and everything about it sounded good. I cooked it and it was absolutely delicous. My husband and my 8yr old and 1 yr old loved it too. The cheddar cheese really makes it. It helps give the casserole a good flavor.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this recipe turned out to be. It was more flavorful than I had anticipated and it was easy to make. I used a precooked rotisserie chicken instead of the chicken breasts (which has good flavor and is moist).  I also used one can each of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and broccoli and cheese soup.  I will definately make it again.

This was a little bland for me, but it wasn't bad.  It is very filling and healthy.  I think next time I'll add another can of cream of mushroom, some salt, garlic powder and onion powder.

Fabulous! My "meat and potatoes" fiance scarfed this down, and comandeered the leftovers for lunch the next day! I used Cream of Celery soup, and for lack of packaged stuffing, I used crushed crackers (Vinta) seasoned with a bit of sage and thyme. Will make this again and again!

This got 5 stars not only for taste, but for quickness and minimal prep time.  I followed other reviews, boiled chix in chix broth added montreal chiken seasoning, onions salt, pepper & garlic while boiling chicken.  Mixed broth with 2 cans of cream of celery soup, used frozen three cheese broccoli, and prepared stuffing for top crust.  It was soo easy and soo good.  Thanks for the ideas!!

This was wonderful!  I boiled the chicken breasts with a garlic clove and also added garlic and onion powder before baking to give it more flavor.  I also followed other reviewers and used one can cream of chicken soup and one can broccoli cheese.  I just love the dry stuffing mix on top!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was easy to make and very good. I modified it as some others recommended using the cream of chicken soup and broccoli cheese soup (low fat low sodium) I saved 1/2 cup of the chicken broth that I used to cook the chicken and added that to the mixture. I used 1 can of milk instead of the mayo. I will use this recipe for chuch functions.

This is a great recipe! I modified some more to make it even better to our taste. (1)I added a bay leaf and two cloves of garlic when boiling chicken.(Chicken already tatestes good on itsown.) (2)I added thinly sliced carrot when steaming broccoli. (3) as other people recommended, I added the soup stock which I used to boil the chicken. It turned out great. I admire American wives, who know how to make great meals with less efforts !!

I thought this recipe was very good.  Love the fact that you can sub in frozen broccoli instead and thus have everything on hand for this meal to be served anytime.  Unfortunately, my son liked it the first time, not so much the second time.  He is four and starting to be pretty picky though!

TERRIFIC and TOTALLY DELICIOUS is the only way to describe this dish.  This was easy to make and had a nice aroma in the oven.  I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic to perk up the flavor.  Added a hint of garlic for superb flavor.  This is a keeper and will definately put this at the top of my list.  Thanks for an awesome recipe :-)

My mom used to make this recipe when I was a kid, and I love it!  The only things I change when I make it to add a full cup of mayo (you can use low/non fat), curry powder to taste, and we use croutons for the top instead of stuffing.  Really good!

Quite good overall. I added 1/2c of chicken stock to soup. I think I'd change the topping next time to plain breacrumbs and cheese - the herby taste of the stuffing mix was too strong for me (and the kids). Will do again.

I used leftovers for this recipe, leftover yellow rice for the bottom, then mixed leftover chicken,veal,broccoli casserole,cream of broccoli and cheese soup, mixed it all together with the mayo and cheese, and put it on top of the rice. I also mixed the dry stuffing mix with some melted butter before topping it. Followed the cooking time and it came out yummy, no leftover leftovers :o). Thanks for your recipe..Tracy

This was pretty good.  My son had three servings, but my daughter didn't like it.  It was a little dry, next time I might try increasing the soup and adding a little more cheese.  But, it was tasty all around.

This went over well with my family. I used cream of chicken soup, b/c I didn't have an cream of mushroom on hand. I also only used one can and it wasn't dry at all. I also cooked my chicken in a skillet and seasoned it. I then combined the soup, mayo, chicken and brocolli. After that I added some bacon bits, parm cheese, cheddar then breadcrumbs. My only problem was I should have cooked more.

Pretty good recipe.  After reading reviews I did add another can of soup and layered noodles on the bottom of the pan.  Glad I did. We cleaned it up.  Will make again.

As someone else noted, this is a good base. Next time I will be sure to spread the cheese on every layer. Nonetheless, to be such an easy recipe, it was very tasty.  Thanks Tracy.

I changed this recipe a bit using a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of broccoli with 2 tbs. of mayo. Also, I used one bag of Club crackers instead of stuffing. This was a great recipe, and was a hit with my family. I will definatly make again.

I made this dish about a month ago and between 5 of us we ate the whole thing.  I did use half cream of mushroom and half cream of chicken soup.  My brother suggested that I make it next time with carrots and peas and then it would taste like a pot pie so that is what I am trying tonight.

This was ok. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it exactly.  I think maybe it would have been better with some poulty seasoning sprinkled on the chicken layer and maybe mixing some brown gravy with the cream of mushroom souop would have spiced it up.  I also don't like having to cook things separately and then baking it. Too much clean up.  I don't know...just not worth it I guess.

Good but dry. Followed other review and used 2 cream of broccoli soup. Next time I will use cream of mushroom soup and cracker crumbs on top instead of stuffing mix. My boyfriend said it was good. I thought it was ok. I also added cooked white rice to bottom of baking dish.

Very good recipe.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so I substituted mozerella and parmesan.  Next tiem I think I will leave out the mayo and use an extra can of cream of mushroom soup.  It was a little dry.  I did use other readers suggestions and make the stuffing ahead of time.  Glad I did!!!

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did different was prepare the boxed stuffing before putting it on top.  I think next time I'll add just a little extra cheese too.  This is even better warmed over!

I really liked the ease of this recipe, using leftover chicken and microwaving the broccoli.  The flavor was very good but I just kept thinking that it was missing something.  I think in the future I will add another can of soup and some rice (with milk or something to avoid making it dry.).  It is definately one to recommend to anyone and will be used again in our house!

I found this recipe extremely quick and easy to make. If I had to make one change to it, I would have to switch to a different condensed soup. Instead of using cream of mushroom I might go with cream of chicken or even broccoli. That is only because I'm not much of a mushroom eater. As for my family, they loved it!

Very tasty recipe. Did not find directions really clear. I used left-over chicken instead of boiling. Worked really well.

This recipe was yummy, quick, and easy, but I didn't think the directions were clear enough.
