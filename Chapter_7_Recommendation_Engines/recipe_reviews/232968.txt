I have made this recipe twice now.  It is yummy.  We thought there was a bit too much of pastry so this time we doubled the mushrooms. Half went inside the bundles. Half were drizzled over the top.  That seemed like a better balance.

I cut the recipe in half, following the recipe using the suggested sherry.  The mushrooms (it took an 8-oz container of criminis) were marvelous!  My whole house smelled divine while they were simmering!  I wasn't sure what the bundles were supposed to look like, but for us there was too much puff pastry and not enough mushrooms.  The cooking time for the mushrooms was off because it took about 15 to 20 minutes to get it down to what I thought would not be absorbed at all, and I drained off a lot of buttery/mushroomy liquid--maybe too much butter?  I baked them for about 20 minutes, and the bundles still had quite a bit of translucent pastry left, but I took them out and let them sit for a while because I had made them ahead of dinner.  I put them back in the oven before dinner to finish browning up, and that worked well.  In fact, that would make this a really great dish to serve to company because you could parbake them ahead of time and then stick them back in the oven to finish up just before dinner was to be served.  I will try these again because they are gorgeous and perfect for a guest plate!  I am wanting to see what others do with this recipe.  And I do recommend the sherry!  Thanks, AshleyV!

I wanted more bites so I made the mixture then rolled out the pastry and applied the mushrooms and then rolled the whole thing up. Cut into 1” slices and laid a flat on the sheet. Made a ton more, which was good because we loved them

This recipe is good however without an herb.....it might be the reason some don't find it that tasty. Therefore, the reason for my 4 stars. This recipe as is is good base, but definitely needs some kind of herb to elevate it a bit more without drastically changing it. My recommendation would be to add dried thyme and cook the mushrooms at high temperature especially once the alcohol is added. Otherwise, it will take forever to cook. Other than that, this recipe is restaurant level but made easy. Will make it again.

So good! Just made it tonight with a few additions, based on the suggestions of the original poster and other reviewers:

- subbed sherry for the white wine (same amount)
- doubled the mushroom mixture (which meant all the stuff used to make it too - butter, garlic, and sherry)
- added a chopped up shallot to the mushroom mixture
- instead of puff pastry, I used two cans of crescent roll dough

I guess since I made a lot more of the mushroom mixture, it took a bit longer to reduce (maybe around 20 minutes or so). Reducing the sherry is a worth the wait though! I made one batch after reducing it for ~8 minutes or so (similar to the original recipe) and another after it had cooked for ~20 minutes - my husband and I could definitely taste the difference! The second batch was better :)

Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was good, but I felt lacking something.  Next time I’m going to add an herbed goat cheese to the mixture.

This has a wonderful flavor! However, I'd definitely increase the mushrooms by 2-4 cups, keeping the butter the same. I, too, had to cook the mushrooms 20 minutes. I used vegetable broth instead of dry white wine. We'll be having this again, for sure!
