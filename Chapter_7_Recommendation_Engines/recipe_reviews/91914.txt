I am giving this 4 stars because I skipped the pre cooking step and didn't use the lemon pepper.  I love sweet potato fries and I make them all the time because of this recipe.  The secret is to make sure they are all cut fairly evenly and they are spaced out on the pan.  If they are crowded too close together they will not cook properly.

Also always make sure to turn them at least once or they will get burned on one side.  Regular potatoes you don't have to be so careful but sweet potatoes you do for some reason.

If you want them crispier, just skip the pre-cooking step and bake them longer (or cut them more thinly and keep the same cook time.)

my very first attempt at ANY kind of homemade french fry, and they came out perfect. I used sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and a dash of each: garlic powder, dehydrated onion, parsley flakes. Cut them into thin 2 1/2" fries & they crisped up perfectly. Awesome just with ketchup.. a new favorite food for sure!!!!

I'll give 5 stars to anything my 19 month old will eat!  He loved them.  So did my husband and I.  I didn't do the microwave part.  I cut them thinner cooked 30 mins at 400 and to crisp up a bit, I put them under the broiler for a few minutes on each side.  They were delish!

To get the fries a bit more crispy they need to be cut rather thinly. This also helps them cook faster. To season I always add salt, pepper, and paprika, which gives it a nice contrast between the sweet and spicy. Sometime I add fresh rosemary or a tiny bit of chili powder to kick it up a bit more.

These were great. I only cooked in microwave for 3 min. Tossed with garlic olive oil, lemon seasoning and italian spices. Baked for 45 min. Crispiness depends on how thick you cut. The smaller cut, the crispier. I cut mine like steak fries and they turned out nice an tasty! My 2 year old loves these!!

Super good alternative to regular oven fries.  I cut mine to about the size of two regular fries.  Took about 45 minutes to really get them perfectly crispy, but they were too mushy on the inside.  I'll only microwave them for 3 minutes next time and bake them for a full 45 min.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great.  Instead of the lemon pepper/Italian seasoning combo, I seasoned with chili powder.  I also had problems getting them to crisp.  I think I'll try less time in the micro and more time in the oven, like another reviewer. Thanks!

Great recipe! I did pre-cook in the microwave a little and opted for a different spice mix - cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika along with the salt and pepper. But, I think no matter what your taste preference these are a fabulous side dish. I baked these on parchment paper until I got the consistency and crispiness I was looking for. Great with grilled turkey burgers!

I am giving this 3 stars because the precooking in water is not necessary. Second time around, I just precooked the whole potato for a few minutes just to soften a bit to make the potato easier to slice. The secret is to keep them dry. Dry them well with a paper towel if necessary. Then cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 slices. Make sure they are square as the points burn easily if too pointy. Toss them in a ziplock bag with the olive oil then on another bag dust them slightly with cornstarch before putting then in the oven. This will make them crispy.

Skipped the microwave step and just cut the sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch discs. Olive oil, pepper, sea salt, and some Emerils Essence. Baked at 400 for 20 min each side. I think next time I am going to add some small amounts of paprika or whatever else feels right. Maybe sprinkle some fresh herbs on them once I turn them?  I liked the 1/4 inch discs because they had a nice crunchy outer coating and then a delicious warm middle. Plus, it was way easier cutting up the potatoes.

I took the advice of others and nixed the precooking.  I simply chopped the sweet potatoes into fries, added the seasonings and oil, and then cooked them on top of foil on the grill.  I turned them once and they crisped up nicely.  They had a great flavor and will be a repeater here.  Thanks!

The family thought these were fantastic. Following others suggestions, I did not cook in the microwave prior to baking. I simply sliced mine real thin and they cooked up in 30 minutes and the edges of most of them were crispy. The thinner you slice, the better I think they crisp up, if that's what you're looking for. Keeping this recipe. Thanks!

Even if you fry sweet potatoes for fries, they don't stay crisp for long. There is a lot of water in them. This causes them to not crisp too well. I have drizzled mine with olive oil and sea salt, cut thin, and cook on 425. They seem to crisp some then. But this is a great recipe. They are yummy. Love the seasonings.

GARLIC!!    I also did not bake the sweet potatoes in the microwave before placing them in the oven.  I added minced garlic to olive oil along with salt and pepper, tossed the cut potatoes in the mixture, spread on a sheet pan and baked at 400F for 45 minutes, flipping them halfway through the cooking process.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe! Who needs regular fries? These are much better. I did make a couple of changes. The potatoes were so hard to cut so I microwaved them for 2 minutes then cut them. After I cut them into fries, I microwaved ythem for one minute longer. Then I tossed them in the olive oil and Tex Mex seasoning instead of the Italian seasoning called for. Can't wait to make these again!

Tasty! I don't think they need to bake for 30 minutes though - some of them got a little black. I read what other people said about them coming out crispier if they weren't microwaved as long, so I only put them in for two minutes. The texture was just right when they first came out of the oven. Unfortunately I had to cover them up to keep them warm while I got the rest of the dinner on the table, and they got a little soft. Still very tasty though.

Great.  Keeping the size down is key.  Would probably cut the longer fries to about 3 to 4 inchies long to help keep them from being limp.  Very good.

You def have to play around with ur own seasonings.  I used ital pepper, lemon pepper and salt and pepper but what gave it the kick for me was the creole seasoning.  Only if you really like spice (add some rosemary too).  I cut mine thin and put it on 425 because i was hungry.  Came out fine, a couple are burnt on the ends but i lovee burntness.  These will make your house smell xtra good!

YUM! Super good. My husband claims to hate sweet potatoes so I didn't tell him what these were until after he tried one. He said they tasted like regular french fries, but with more flavor. SO, if you have a sweet potato hater in your house, try these! I'm trying to cut out white potatoes, so I'm happy to discover that hubby likes these. I don't like lemon pepper, so I just sprinkled some garlic powder on along with the other spices. Thanks! :)

Great recipe! Giving it 4 stars because microwaving is definitely not necessary if you make them thin fries. I peeled the sweet potatoes, cut them into almost shoe string fries, tossed in extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt. Perfect flavor. I made one cookie sheet with salt and another sprinkled with cinnamon & salt - requested by my teenage son. Baked for 35 minutes. Definitely love the cinnamon & salt better!

Tasty recipe. Used yams, tried to make the french fries thin. Steamed them like it called for and convection baked them at 425 for 15 min and turned them, cook add'l. 9 min and came out crispy. Even those that don't usually like yams loved them!

I made these a couple of times and just couldn't get any crunch to them. I tried microwaving them at 3 then 4 minutes. I baked them at 400, then at 450 and broiled them after for a minute. The were soggy no matter what I tried. Tasty but soggy.

This is my go-to for instructions on sweet potato fries - thanks!  

I vary up the seasonings though to go with the meal - salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika & cayenne may be my favorite!

I used 1 large sweet potato and halved the rest of the ingredients.  My 5 year old son loved them. He had tried a salted sweet potato fry last week and didn't like it, so I was concerned he wouldn't like this one, but he loved it.  He was also really impressed that we could call it a healthy fry. Thanks!

OMG- I just made these, with a couple adjustments. . YUMMY!!!!! I took the others advice, mixed sweet potatoes with olive oil, italian spices, onion powder, sea salt and pepper, and put on cookie sheet. Let them cook for 40 min and YUM! They are softer becaus they are sweet potatoes, but they are not mushy. I also cut them thinner and SMALLER. SO good!!!

Super easy recipe. I'm a beginner to cooking and this recipe turned out great. Yummy flavor. I recommend you turn the fries within 15 min.  to get them crispy.

These are great, I've always loved sweet potato fries.  For those looking for something with the same texture and crunchiness as a regular french fry...well, you will not find it here.  Sweet potato fries are softer, and thus don't crunch up like regular potatoes.  Keep that in mind when making these and you won't be disappointed.  They are really, really good!

WOW! This is a keeper!!

These sweet potato fries were incredible!!  Everyone at the table raved and wanted more – but alas, there weren’t any more!!!

I followed the recipe but did add a couple of shakes of Cajun Seasoning. I used three pretty big sweet potatoes cut into ½” fries and left the skins on – best part!!  I wouldn’t microwave any longer than the five minutes called for and for my oven, would raise the temp to 450 ° to crisp them a little more.  Yes, they can burn a little if not turned over often enough but we found that only drew out the natural sugar and enhanced the flavor. 

A definite repeat recipe.

When I made these my fiance said "We should have these every day."  Since then, they've made weekly appearances in my house and I've made them for my parents.  They're absolutely perfect.  I didn't have Italian seasoning so I made up my own with 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp rosemary (for 2 potatoes).  A definite stand by recipe.  Thanks!

WOW!  These are SO good!  I love sweet potatoes and am always looking for new ways to cook them.  Since the original directions doesn't tell you how thick to cook them, I read through the other cook's suggestions and ended up cutting them about 1/2" all around.  I only microwaved them for 3 minutes (also, after reading some of the other comments I didn't want them too mushy), and they only needed to cook about 20 minutes in the oven.  Next time I will broil them, like one person suggested, so that they are nice and crisp on the outside.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I love the lemon pepper!

These fries taste very good; however, I found that (from cooking them both with and without the prep) They either turn out too crispy or too flimsy. This could be my fault though, maybe I needed to cut the fries a little thicker.

I made these fries, following the recipe using yams instead. They just tasted like half-cooked yams. But, after baking I decided to fry them in oil, and that made them great! After that my family gobbled them up!

I don't really know what I did wrong here. Even after trying to broil the fries at the end, they came out limp and soft instead of crunchy like I was hoping.

These were OK.  I prefer "Onion Roasted Sweet Potatoes" which is another recipe for baked sweet potatoes on this site.  The texture and flavor are so much better suited for this veggie.

Recipe was great- they turned out exactly they way I was looking for them.  Instead of lemon pepper and italian seasoning though, I used season salt, fresh ground pepper and about a tablespoon of Sweet'nLow brown sugar- they turned out delicious!

Very yummy!!  I cut them in circular shapes instead of fry shapes.  Also I put them in the broiler for a minute or 2 to make them crispier.  They had great flavor and were delicious!

This recipe was OK. The potatoes were tough to cut and the seasoning mildly overpowered the fries. As others have said, I would suggest putting the potatoes in the microwave for only 3 minutes then cook them in the oven for 45.

Seriously delicious and simple.  I can't believe I haven't tried this before now...can't wait to try it out on the kids at Easter.  I think I'll play around with baking at higher temp or broil to crisp up a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

Changed the lemon pepper for chili powder.Like many others,I had a hard time crisping these up.I broiled them for about 8 min,keeping a close eye on them,at the end and it seemed to help.The taste turned out as I hoped;delicious.I'll try these again maybe sprinkling them with flour or corn startch to see if it helps the "soggy factor".

These fries are pretty good!  Although, it's really hard to call them fries since they are very difficult to crisp up in the oven!  They are more like roasted sweet potatoes with some seasoning on them.

Going on the suggestions of others, I did NOT cook the potatoes in the microwave first.  At 30 minutes they were only baked, not quite crispy like fries, but I think that with a little more time they would have been.

These are awesome! My boyfriend, who is a very traditional meat and potatos person, actually loved them. And he frowned when I told him I was making them.
I don't use the italian seasoning, but use everything else in the recipe and they turn out nice and browned and crispy.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but these burn before they get crunchy.  They do taste good though (the least burned ones) & seasoning is great.  I've tried twice but still haven't gotten it right.

This was my first time making any kind of fry, and I had trouble with this recipe. The fries were large and limp. Though they tasted fine, they weren't at all crisp. For those who try this recipe, I'd suggest cutting the fries thinner and baking them on parchment paper so they don't stick to the pan.

These were successful, low-skill low-prep low-maintenance sweet potato baked "fries".  My only complaint is that I wish they were a tad crisper.  I'm unsure what the fix is for that.  Perhaps adding flour to the spice toss.  Perhaps fiddling with the heat and time (more heat, less time.)  I ended up cooking them longer just to get them a bit crisper, but that added char rather than properly cooked crispness.  Perhaps this is a problem that can only truly be resolved by frying them.  If so, I'll take this baked version any day.

These were so yummy!  Mine didn't get crisp enough during the cooking time so next time I'd cook them longer then 30 minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

I cut these as thin as possible (think McD's fries) and they still came out soggy after 45 minutes. Not only were they soggy but they were starting to dry out. Boo! The taste was good but just not enough for me to make these again.

No leftovers. I put the cut up sweet potatoes in a large zip lock bag, sprinkled with olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt and pepper. Let set in bag 30 minutes, turning bag, then baked for 40 minutes, turning after 20 minutes.

So good! I took the advice of other reviews and skipped the microwave. I used a French fry cutter so my fries were very uniform and cooked easily. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have lemon pepper so I used salt and pepper to the Italian seasoning and it was too peppery.  Also, the fries didn't get crisp enough and they were baking for 45 minutes.

These are pretty good! I liked the spiciness. I made mine with sweet potatoes, not yams as some may have. They weren't as crispy as I wanted, but I ran out of time. Eat them quick, they go cold very fast! I served mine with the All-Star Veggie Burger.

We really liked these. I sliced them really small & a few burned, but the rest were really tasty. I used my homemade Italian Seasoning, and a few shakes of Penzey's lemon peel.

Good recipe - don't get me wrong!  Just not a fan of the sweet potato fries I guess.  But okay to have once in a while.

Was looking for a recipe with savory seasoning as opposed to sweet so I was quite glad to find this.  These tasty fries were a good side dish for my burger.  I rarely use the microwave for cooking, so pre-boiled the cut fries for 4 minutes and baked for 30 minutes.

Delicious! My husband thought it was exceptional and my young children also enjoyed it. I did spiral fries and followed the directions to the tea. The potatoes were soft, but with the seasoning we all felt they didn't need to be crispy. A new staple in our house! Thank you for sharing!

My family enjoyed these very much - even my one-year-old. I have made these twice - the second time I had only two large sweet potatoes but used the original amount of sauce and we liked them even better than the first time (when we used 4 potatoes).

I did as some recommended and skipped the microwave step, cooked for 40 minutes.  They were dull, tough and un interesting.  I do not think the microwave step would have improved the taste.

Having read previous reviews I also omitted the pre-baking step and changed the seasoning so I could use what I had in my cupboard. I also added a pinch of flour and they were beautifully crispy. Unfortunately I couldn't serve them straight away but I transferred them to some grease proof paper on a baking tray and they retained their crispness. Will definitely be making again!

I made these as stated and my nephew and I loved them, but his sister and my husband did not.  The next time I made these I did salt and pepper for the kids and salt pepper and red pepper flakes for the adults that went over better.  All in all they are a nice change from the regular potatoes.

We've been using this recipe for a couple years now and they taste great.  They are mushy however.  I'll omit the pre-cooking as suggested by other users next time and let you know how it goes.

Very good.  I also skipped the microwave part.  I used a mandolin to cut uniform fries.  I used the seasoning in the recipe.  They weren't crispy, but they weren't limp either.  Very good flavor.  I'd make them again.

The seasonings on these were great, but they were not very crisp. I only put in the microwave for 2 minutes and the fries were cut pretty thin. If there was a way to make these crispier, I would definitely make again.

Quick, easy and very yummy. Don't forget to add the seasoned salt before baking.

I won't even try to make these again with some of the adjustments suggested.  They didn't taste good or even look yummy.    I'm not a lemon pepper fan--I don't know why I haven't thrown out the seasoning.   
I like to experiment so I went for it.  I've tried many recipes here and have been surprised at how great they've been.

These were great. In the past I have only tried to sweeten up sweet potato fries but this seasoning was amazing.  I also struggled with getting them crunchy,but they were great nonetheless!  Will definitely make again.

A little bland, so I added extra spices.  I would also recommend cooking longer to get the fries crispier. They were very mushy.

these were very tasty but not quite crispy enough for me.  next time, i'll try suggestions made by others:  skip "pre-cooking" and cut fries thinner.  i'm doing the standard process cleanse and need to be eating "clean" - these were a life-saver today.  yay, for these fries!

I make these all the time but I use my own blend of seasonings. I add a little bit of salt, some pepper, garlic powder and a generous amount of brown sugar and they are amazing!

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, I MICROWAVED MY (MEDIUM THICKNESS) CUT FRIES FOR 3 MINUTES, THEN PROCEEDED AS DIRECTED. THESE WERE S-O-G-G-Y!!! READ CAREFULLY - THE RECIPE CALLS FOR THICK CUT FRIES! THIS RECIPE DOES NOT WORK FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THICK, STEAK-CUT FRIES!!! BYPASSING THE PRE-COOK STEP AND / OR ADJUSTING THE BAKING TIME DOESN'T WORK. These were alright. I guess nothing compares to a basic french fry.... I guess I just prefer a sweeter coating on my sweet potato fries (which surprises me since it was the savory spice mixture that intrigued me to begin with!). I bet cinnamon sugar would be SUPER yummy! Personal preference aside, I pretty much followed Wannabe Gardener's directions to the letter and just wasn't a fan. Instead of using plain EVOO, I cracked open a new bottle of roasted garlic infused EVOO. I also omitted the microwaving step. I cut my fries into shoestring strips so that they would bake quickly and evenly. Since my baking sheet was a tad overcrowded (some of my fries were touching / overlapping), many of my fries ended up soggy. As a simple fix, I placed my baking sheet under the broiler (HI) for a few minutes to crisp everything up a bit. I know the oven step makes these "healthy," but if you want the texture of a true French fry, deep frying is the way to go. All in all, I'm glad to have given this a try, but am not sure how often or when I'll make these again. Thanks anyways, Wannabe Gardener! :-)

I found them to be too moist so I broiled them for a few minutes after cooking.  It crisped them up nicely!  Great recipe!  A regular go-to.

These were delicious! Way, way better than the kind you buy frozen. I used the convection oven. Made them crispy and cooked in less time. I skipped the pre-cooking step and cooked in the convection oven for 20 mins at 400. I cut the fries really thin, but that was actually too much time. They were a little burned but crispy and delicious. Next time I'll watch them closer. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe, the hubby and I loved it!!! Thanks so much.  I probably would like it just as much with just salt & pepper seasoning, because it's the actual sweet potato itself that brings out the fantastic flavor.  I used the sweet potato called "Kumara" that is very common over here in New Zealand.

Very tasty, but just slightly crisp.  Did not pre-microwave.  Cut pieces the size of regular french fries.  Tossed them in olive oil, then seasoned with garlic salt, paprika and fresh ground pepper.

I omitted the microwave step per the other reviews and these came out DELICIOUS. To the reviewer shared about dipping them in ketchup. Thanks! Made them even yummier!   I think the bake time took a little longer since they were not microwaved first. The microwave time may have to be adjusted depending on the power of your microwave. Ours is a 1200-watt, for instance, and it tends to "blast" everything. So when I cook frozen meals or popcorn in it, I usually have to decrease the cooking time or power.   Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good.  I don't have much experience with sweet potatoes--this is the first time I've cooked them myself and I've only had them a handful of times--so it was all an experiment to me anyway.  I really liked them, although I must say that the cooking time was a bit long for me--I burned several.  I'm going to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt and say it was my fault, as I really wasn't sure how thick to cut them and I cut them on the thin side.  All in all, though, the fries that didn't burn were very good and nice and crispy.  A few stuck to the pan and made me frustrated while trying to turn them, but I probably didn't coat those as evenly with oil as I should have.  All in all, these were great without ketchup and with ketchup.  I'll definitely keep experimenting with sweet potatoes!  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved the flavor of these.  I used the lemon pepper, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.  Like other reviewers suggested, I did not pre-cook in the microwave.  I cut them pretty thin, like the fries you would find at a fast food joint.  I ended up cooking them about 45 minutes to get them some-what crispy.  Overall, I really liked these.  I love sweet potatoes when they are in a savory dish, such as this one!

Me and my son love sweet potato fries, I make them at least twice a month.  I don't pre-cook them in the microwave though, they just need to be cut evenly and cook in oven for 40 minutes, turning AT LEAST once.  I prefer to omit the lemon peper and use paprika and garlic powder instead.  Dont even attempt to make these crispy, sweet potato fries will never crisp (unless fried), they just burn instead.  Its because of the natural sugars.  They should be ever so slightly golden on the outside and soft on the inside.  Thats how you'll know when there done.

Great healthy, easy recipe for these power packed potatoes! I went a little lighter on the oil, and didn't add additional salt or pepper due to the lemon pepper. Potato-licious!

Very good, very filling. One thing though, I would suggest making sure your cuts are pretty "meaty"... I shaped some of mine like wedges, and the thinner edges cooked faster than the thicker ones, and burned a bit.. other than that, i enjoyed them very much.

Like others said, don't expect crispy fries. Sweet potatoes have a much higher water content than normal potatoes, and are thus nearly impossible to cook to a crisp. These 'fries' come out quite soft, but are really very good tasting with ketchup! I will probably make them again in the future sometime.

I tried these last Sunday, and they turned out very well.  I omitted the lemon pepper and added a teaspoon of zesty italian (liquid) dressing.
Delicious.  These fries do not get crispy but they do keep their shape very well.  Thank You!

Very tasty.  Mine didn't get as crispy as I was expecting (and started to burn a bit at about 25 minutes of baking), but the flavor and texture was still very tasty.  Perhaps I didn't cut them the right size.  Nonetheless, a tastier and much healthier version of french fries that I'll do again.

I just made these sweet potato fries today and they were delicious!  I read some reviews about skipping the microwave cooking for crispier fries which I think I'll try the next time I make them.  The seasonings in this recipe were a perfect match for the flavor of sweet potatoes.  I think changing up the flavor with some other seasonings might be fun too! This is definitely a recipe to keep on hand!

I used 4 sweet potatoes and it was way too much! Perhaps we have giant sweet potatoes in Canada, I'm not sure, but 2 would've been plenty. Very tricky to cut, careful not to slice off a finger, these things are like rutabagas. Any tips on what kind of knife to use?

My kids didn't like the spice, so I made my second batch plain and they liked it. Used mayo as dip. Might make again, might buy the frozen ones. If I make again, I'll use the smallest sweet potatoes I can find.

Very good, I minused a star, due to the fact that there's no need to microwave, just put your strength into it, chop them dry, spray with cooking spray (I used olive oil) sprinkle with the lemon pepper seasoning, and they will come out crispy and delish :)

We love these!  Make them all the time.  Skip the salt and save the sodium.  With all the great flavor you don't need it.  Cook until they are crispy enough for your preference.

I sliced mine very thin and added a little variation to the spices, but it turned our very well.  I skipped the precooking and actually cooked them in my NuWave oven for 10 minutes on each side and they came out like chips (I cut mine in slices). This is a keeper.

These are sooo good!  I cut them into wedges.  I love that they are a little soggy in the inside.  Makes them a lot better!  I will continue to make these healthier alternatives to the white potatoes.

I cut mine like shoestrings and only microwaved for 3 min. I baked for 45 minutes and then broiled them but they never got crispy. They had a good flavor but were mushy. Next time, I will skip the microwave and bake at 400 for longer.

Let me tell you.... My family and I loved these sweet potato fries, thing is I dislike or should I say HATE sweet potatoes . I thought I would try something new that was good for me and since I'm in Weight Watchers I needed a new healthy recipe... I did add a little cayene pepper for some heat. But they were amazing! Definately must make them again and again~

I doubled the recipe and cooked half in the microwave as instructed in step 2 and skipped that step with the other half.  Seasoned them the same.  Definitely preferred the non-microwaved fries better.  Way too soggy for us otherwise.  Baked on parchment paper for much easier clean up.

the spice goes well with the sweet.  
they burned before ever getting crispy, though.  i'll keep trying...the mushy potatoes were good.  would be even better if i could get them to cook right.

I love sweet potatoes and this one is a keeper! The only thing that went wrong is I overbaked the sweet potatoes which made them on the mushy side but it was still edible. It might have been because I was using the gas stove and the heating element needed to be adjusted? Either way it is worth keeping and making again in the near future.

Instead of using traditional sweet potatoes I used purple yams. I omitted the microwave step and only cut half of the yam into fry-sized pieces. They came out nice and crispy thanks to the advice of others.

I was very disappointed in these fries. Even after reading the reviews and shortening the microwave time, turning fries half way through cooking time, and letting the fries cook longer in the oven, they still came out mushy and burnt.

Like so many others, I skipped the microwave step. They still turned out a bit mushy. Next time I might broil at the last minute. The over all taste was really good. My son and I enjoyed them with a bit of sour cream today.

I did not enjoy these. Even after following tips the fries were not crisp. The flavor was not great and the smell really bothered me. My husband and 2 kids did not like them either.

These were really great.  My husband loved them.  The only issue I had is I think I cut them a little small because they started to burn before the cooking time was finished.  Also, next time I made add a little spice.

After I baked them in the oven I tossed them in a deep fryer for about 30 seconds.  Not exactly healthy I know but they weren't very crunchy right out of the oven

I love sweet potato fries normally, but for some reason these will not work out for me.  They were actually bad both times I tried to make them, but I'm going to assume it was a user error and give them three stars.

i love sweet potatoes.  i skipped the italian seasoning and they taste great, but they are limp.  i would like a crispier fry.  i cut the potato thinner, cooked half the time in microwave and baked 5 minutes longer.

It's a good alternantive to the normal fries we it. I put the whole potato in for 8 min. Then I cut the into the wedges and used double of the seasoning. When they came out of the oven they where tooooo soggy. The next time I made them I put them in the microwave, cut them, added double amount of seasoning, then I threw them in a pan to crisp them up, AND IT WORKED. They taste soo much better now.

I couldn't get these to crisp up, I tried to broil them but they just burnt. I did precook them in the microwave like the recipe said to and I think that made them fall apart and get too mushy for baking... overall we liked the flavor but the texture wasn't to our liking... I'll probably keep trying to find the perfect way to cook sweet potato fries.

I liked the Italian seasoning, but the lemon pepper was lost in there. More is needed for it to stand out.

Not crispy but delicious. I microwaved for 2.5 minutes then baked for probably 10-12 minutes. Not crisp but not soggy and wonderful flavor and fast and easy. I used olive oil, lemon juice, ginger, sea salt, pepper and cardamon to season for a sweeter flavor to compliment the sweet potato. Will definitely make again.

Wow!  Great recipe!  I made this as recipe directed, though cut it in half.  Love the microwave to make it quicker.  I was kind of hesitant about the lemon pepper seasoning, but I was serving with fish and it was a perfect match!  This recipe will get used often and with lots of seasoning experimenting with seasonings!  Thanks

So good! This is the first time I have ever eaten and liked anything with sweet potatoes in it. I cut them up like potato chips and only heated them in the microwave for about three minutes, stirring them each minute. I also put some red pepper flakes on them which was awesome. They didn't take that long to bake and the finished product was very tasty and crispy. My husband thought they were fantastic and was so happy there was sweet potato anything in the house!

I made these tonight for the first time and they went really, really well.  I didn't have any lemon pepper so I sprinkled about a teaspoon of lemon juice on the fries.  Also, they weren't very crispy which is okay, I didn't really want them to be.  I will definitely make these again, next time I will try with the lemon pepper suggested.

This was the first time i made or even tried sweet potato fries. I thought they were awesome!!! I dont know if it was this particular recipe cause i think sweet potato fries seasoned differently would be just as amazing. I think i just LOVE sweet potato fries!! YUM!! I used both sweet potatoes and yams- yes there is a difference.(see pic) I think i prefer sweet potato(the white one) better than the yams(the orange one).Cant wait to make more. I will try different recipes just so i can compare.

There really is no need of microwaving them first,they cook within 30 minutes without the microwaving.And it's very hard to get them to crisp up,unless they are super thin.But with all that said I still gave the recipe 4 stars because they taste so good,and I've made them with a different seasoning each time.YUM!

great flavor.  you don't need to pre-cook if you just cut them thin enough.  i put foil on the cookie sheet, spray in and turn once during baking.  i bake at 425 for 20-25 minutes.  they get nice and crispy this way :)

These fries tasted good, but they weren't crispy, even when baked as long as the recipe stated. Since I love sweet potatoes in any form, this didn't bother me very much, but the rest of my family was pretty dissapointed. These fries had a wonderful flavor, though. Thanks for sharing!

I'm being redundant with my review but it's a great recipe with less time in the microwave and thinner slices make for less mushy fries. The main reason for my review is to comment on someone's comment, the sweet potato fries burn easier than regular potato fries because of the higher sugar content (the more sugar the more likely it is to burn)

YUMMY!  I made these to go with the Lemon Barbeque Pork Chops from this site, and they were delicious!  I skipped the microwaving step and they still turned out wonderfully.  I actually think that microwaving them would make them too mushy.  The chops, these fries, and a salad made for a great dinner.  My husband said it was one of the best meals I'd made, and it was so easy!

absolutely delicious. had 3 big sweet potatoes so i made 3 batches. 
*did not use microwave. peeled and cut the potato and drizzled with 2T olive oil. baked for about 25-30 minutes, flipping fries over half way

Batch 1= skinny fries (think McDonald's thickness) about 3-4 inches long. using lemon pepper and sea salt.
Batch 2= wedge sized (~1 inch x .5 inch. and about 4 inches long). mix of seasonings- italian, garlic, lemon pepper, sea salt, pepper
Batch 3= wedge sized. cinnamon and honey, sea salt

All were delicious and big hits but #1 was the favorite! oven was at 400, and i baked them until the edges were brown and crispy. exquisite!!

Add a few other spices to give more zing.  I add paprika, oregano, nutmeg, and a sprinkle of chili powder.

Skipped the microwaving per others suggestions.  Other than that, I thought they turned out great.  I probably cooked them for about 45 minutes vs the 30.  The seasoning was pretty good as well.  Will make again.

I followed others suggestions and didn't do the pre-cook step to avoid sogginess. After 60 mins; the fries were still chewy even with cutting them thinner than the photos.

I shoe-stringed the yams in hopes of obtaining a crispier result which worked for the outside but the inside remained a bit mushy. Used only a dash of canola oil and baked for 30mins on the top rack. Although not the same as restaurant yam fries, still tasty.

These are ok.  I had some great sweet potato fries at a restaurant once, and these are not anything like these.  Cutting sweet potatoes is a lot of work.  To me, they aren't worth all of the effort.

My whole family really likes these. 
I cut some white potatoes, and season and cook them together. After being microwaved, the sweet potatoes take the same amount of time to cook as the white potatoes.

Ok, after readiing all the sweet potato fries recipes on this site, I decided to try this one. My husband doesnt like any spices so I just slice one really big sweet potato as thin as possible, spray an baking sheet with olive oil spray and bake at 450 for about 20 minutes. (I dont bother with microwaving)They do start to get sort of crisp but you have to be careful or they'll burn. We love them and have them a couple nights a week. I'm sure they be good with seasonings as well.

A new favorite at our house, and even my 5 and 3 yr olds love them.  I nuked my potatoes for 3-5 minutes and then let them cool before cutting them.  We've made them several times and varied the spices.  Great recipe!

Fabulous. We did make a few minor changes based on other recommendations. We microwaved for 3 minutes and cooked for 45. They were to  die for.

We cut these a little thinner, hoping to get them to crisp up.  Unfortunately they didn't but my husband and I still loved them.  The kids kids (17 & 20) didn't like them, but I'll make them again when they aren't home for dinner.

The flavors are great, but the cooking time/method is too off for me to give it a better rating.  I left them in the oven for 45 minutes, and they never turned crispy, only soggy.  This recipe still needs a bit of tweaking.

Yum! I've had sweet potato fries in the restaurant that I bartend for, so I knew what to expect. These were good, though not quite restaurant quality. It was fun making them, however! They were a great accompaniment to my man's awesome homemade burgers (I don't know how he does it!).

This recipe was a little strange to me.  I think I am accustomed to the sweetness of the sweet potato.  Having a twist to them like lemon pepper and Italian seasoning was... different, yet not bad.

When i made this, I used only 2 very large sweet potatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as stated. These turned out delicious and they reheated well, too! I will definitely be making these again.

We really like baked sweet potato fries.  I didn't microwave them.  Used your spices and baked longer in the oven and turned them several times.  Cut them all the same size.  Yummy in my tummy.

For crispier fries:  Skip microwave. Dry washed spuds well with a tea towel. Cut wedges thinner or slice into 1/4" rounds instead. (Or precook slightly for easier slicing.)  Make sure ends are square or the tips will burn. Toss with o oil & herbs, then dust  slightly with cornstarch. Cook 45 mins at 400 turning once. Or 20 mins each side @ 425.  When fries look about done, crank up the broiler and blast them for a minute, turn them over once and blast them again for one minute. Remove from oven and enjoy.
This will make for crispy sweet fries. Hopefully.

The fries were delicious but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Since I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning I used garlic powder, onion powder and a little Adobe. The fries needed to be cooked for 50 minutes so that they weren't mushy!

These are fantastic! I did skip the microwave step though. Flavor wise I made as written.. And sprinkled with sea salt just before serving. I cooked mine a total of 40 Mins flipping halfway through. I will say this though.. Be careful not to crowd the pan.. They will steem instead of crisp. I only used one large sweet potato and that filled my entire large baking sheet. It fed 3 of us as a side to burgers. I will be making this again!

Skipped the microwave step and instead baked for about 15-20 additional minutes at 400. Added some paprika and red pepper flakes to the mix and it came out great!

I loved this recipe. I did adjust for my own tastes by making these spicy by adding Cajun seasonings instead of those called for. The cooking directions were perfect though!

These were really yummy and I appreciate the microwave tip to cut down on some of the cooking time (and it may help decrease the acrylamide formation as well).  I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so skipped it. Also, I always use coconut oil to cook, which is more heat stable. 

Mine also didn't crisp much - but the plateful was still gone in 5 minutes flat.  

I read a few internet tips about lining the cookie sheet with parchment paper for more crispness, so am planning to try that next time.

Didn't have lemon pepper, used Mrs Dash. Next time I will cut the fries thinner to get a crisper texture.

I liked this recipe a lot. I did put them in microwave for five minutes like the recipe states, however, they did not get crisp in the oven. I wanted them a little crunchy that's why only the four stars. The spices wee nice. My youngest had seconds so I guess he liked them too. Of course, he did eat them with ketchup.

Super tasty. The seasoning is perfect......just needed a little more EVOO to coat the fries. I made this with 1/4 mayo and 1/4 maple cinnamon syrup for a yummy dip.

We loved these fries.  The cooking time definitely depends on how thin you cut the fries and your oven.  Great healthy alternative!

I only gave four stars because I didn't care for the mushy texture. I cut my "fries" way too small, I've never been good at cutting fries. :-( I don't think I would take the time to make these again.

pretty good recipe.  I took advice of others and did not put the potatoes in microwave before cooking.  You really don't need that step.  You also really need to keep an eye on the potatoes because they can easily burn.  I'm not sure they need to be in the oven for 30 min. at 400 degrees.  Will probably make them again.

yummmy and absolutely perfect!  for those who said they like them crispy, I have found, even in restaurant, sweet potato fries tend not to be crunchy like regular.  either way, I loved these and so did my family and it was incredibly simple!  I will make these over and over again!  thanks so much for a great recipe!

Followed other reviewers and drizzled olive oil over potatoes before cooking and stirring halfway through. Very tasty and a recipe I will fix again.

Really tasty!  I added chili powder and garlic powder for more oomph.  Mine burned a little and were not super crispy, but still turned out really good.  I'll tweak cooking time/temp next time.

I did not pre-cook in the microwave either, but baked at 425 for roughly 30 minutes, turning over twice.  I used a slightly rounded 1/4 tsp of lemon pepper.   The youngest 2 even ate quite well.

So good and easy to make.  I didn't skip the microwave step.  I found it helped the seasoning coat more evenly when I tossed them in a plastic bag.  They werent crispy.  They were tender but werent mushy.  I prefer them that way.  The trick is to cut them as evenly as possible and make sure theyre spaced apart on the baking tray.  Make sure to cut them thick. Thinner ones will burn.  I used a little more olive oil than called for in the recipe. I also baked them for 45 minutes instead of 30. I paired it with a little sour cream and everyone loved them.

In the past my sweet potato fries have chared before being fully cooked.  I think microwaving them gives them a needed headstart.  Had no burning with this recipe.

This is a nice, different way to serve up sweet potatoes. I sliced mine into thin discs, didn't do the pre-cooking, and they cooked up nicely in about 25 minutes. I flipped them after about 15 minutes. There was some slight burning on some of them, but it didn't detract from the taste and actually helped the crispiness factor.

VERY good!  I add some cayenne pepper to the mixture.  And the mixture I made I poured over only 2 potatoes instead of 4.  I also baked mine for about 45 mins to get them crispier.  Delish!!!

Fries were soft, and the seasoning was delicious. I can't wait to make it again!  **Don't make this if you don't like soft fries, you will be disappointed. This is why you end up rating it 1 star!**

Just like everyone else said...these were mushy!  I skipped the microwave step, baked longer and even broiled for the last few minutes but they were still way too soft.  Good flavor though (added lots of seasoning and cayenne pepper)!

as per other reviewers' suggestions, i halved the precooking time in the microwave. my only suggestion is to omit the lemon pepper - made it much too spicy! otherwise delicious!

I love sweet potato fries, and I enjoyed these, but I really could not figure out how to make them crispy as opposed to mushy inside.  Even after cooking them for 45 minutes as others suggested, they still were not crispy, even though some ended up slightly burned.

These turned out too mushy but were good anyway.  I think I will cut them thinner next time and reduce the precooking time.

This was my first try with Sweet Potato Fries also and I am a huge fan now!  I gave up french fries so long ago because of the fat and starch and this was just heaven.  I'm going to try fresh garlic next time in place of the lemon pepper.

I thought these were good. I skipped the microwaving part and just baked them. They never got crispy for me though. Great flavor! The 2nd time I made these, I mixed mayo with a southwest seasoning for a dipping sauce.

I cut them fairly thin, then baked them for 30 min. like the recipe says.  Soggy.  Baked them another 30 min.  Still soggy.  How in the world did you get them crispy?  Flavor was pretty good.

These were delicious, but I didn't read the other reviews that said skip the pre-cooking in the microwave until I had already cooked them.  They were a bit mushy.  Will use less olive oil next time and skip the pre-cook.  Would have given this a five star if they weren't so soggy.  Still tasted wonderful!

These were good, but next time I will not precook them so they will be crispier. I like to roast white potatoes by cutting them into small chunks, tossing with olive oil and seasonings, and baking at 450 for 45 minutes. Maybe I'll try doing sweet potatoes the same way.

These did turn out pretty mushy-but I'll try them again without as much pre-cooking. I have to say though, I liked that the pre-cooking made it really quick. I didn't even need the oil cause the water from cooking allowed the spices to stick. I used garlic powder, paprika, italian seasoning, and kosher salt.

Easy to make and a crowd pleaser. I skipped the microwave portion like other reviewers suggested. I cut the potatos to much smaller sizes than suggested.

These potatoes were so good! I omitted the Italian seasoning and used creole instead just because I prefer a little spicy. Delicious, I will be making these again.

This was excellent and very easy to make. I added two dashes on cinnamon along with the other ingredients that the recipe suggests. I also skipped the microwave cooking and cut the fries thin like other users suggested. This is definitly a new favorite!

I just tried to make this and it didn't turn out so well... Most of the fries burned before 30 minutes.  It's not really the fault of the recipe, it's the way you cook them (thickness of fries, the pan you use, baking temp...).  The fries that didn't burn were pretty tasty, though.

Well, these were a disaster for me.  I did NOT microwave first, as many reviewers suggested, and they were still soggy, both inside and out.  The lemon pepper flavor was indeed strange and simply put, this just wasn't what the rest of the reviewers made them out to be.

This recipe would work if only it excluded the microwavig part. Others have said it, and I had the same experience. These were soggy and stuck to the pan.  They tasted pretty good, however. So I'll keep the recipe sans the microwaving.

These are good. Mine did not turn out real well because I over spiced them. My tip is do NOT coat in oil and coat in seasoning mix. One, they cook way too fast and two, they are so seasoned it just makes them taste bad and your REALLY thirsty all night. SO, I will be making them again will lightly coat them. They would be good drizzled with olive oil and sprinkle some garlic and parmesan cheese.

Yummy! These are wonderful.  And I thought my daughter wouldn't eat them because they were sweet potato's, but she loved them.  The only change I made was using some garlic salt and using sea salt instead of regular salt.  I did make the mistake of bunching them up a bit too much the first time, but used a bigger pan the next time and they are crispy and great.

Wow! These were amazing! I skipped the precook step based on other reviewers. I seasoned mine with Italian seasoning, sea salt, ground pepper and creole seasoning. I flipped them half way through so as not to burn. I had to cook 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for and they turned out so delicious. This was my first taste of sweet potatoes and I am impressed. We had this with baked chicken and fried okra. We will be having this more often.

These were incredible. I broiled them the last couple of minutes, forgot about them, burned them completely on one side, and they were still great! When I make them again, and don't burn them, they will deserve 6 stars.

Wow! So delicious!  I don't think you can go wrong with sweet potato fries, no matter what seasoning you choose to add.  I did not pre-cook mine in the microwave.  I did not toss with oil.  I sprayed my baking sheet, placed the fries, sprinkled on garlic salt and Italian seasoning.  I didn't time them, but I think they were done in 10 minutes (I did cut them very thin).  I ate these ALL myself (3 sweet potatoes), and I'm not ashamed - they're healthy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mine didn't crisp up either which was disappointing. The flavor was good but the texture was not. I would shallow fry them if I was to try this recipe again. We're not big sweet potato fans, so that's probably not going to happen. Thanks anyway.

This is my first time making sweet potatoe fries. I loved them. They tasted wonderfully. I did not expect or want them to be too crispy (so I could feed them to my 1 yr old). We will definatly be having these again. Next time I might try replacing the olive oil w/applejuice...

Could have been a little more "firm" but flavor was excellent.  We dipped them in honey & it was a real treat.  The sweet potato fries I've had before were deep fried; so it's not really a fair comparison, but these were WAY healthier.

I cooked and served these as an afterthought for a small dinner party I hosted for my boss and must say - especially for such a simple recipe - it worked brilliantly. I love sweet potato frites, and think that my boyfriend and I will be using this recipe on a regular basis.

These were sooo good! Although I should have read some of the other reviews on how to get them crispier. I thought that it was just me! This is soo good and healthy!

I followed this recipe to the absolute "t" and they turned out a mushy mess.  I wound up putting them under the broiler to crisp them up a bit and it still didn't work out all that great.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

Definitely needed to cook longer so they weren't soggy, but the flavor was good.  A healthy, sweet alternative to fries!

Good flavor, but couldn't get them crispy. Skip microwave pre-cooking step next time.

These were pretty good, but just because I love sweet potatoes. I followed all of the suggestions from other cooks (sliced thin, no pre-cook, spaced apart on the pan, cooked 45 minutes, etc.) and still couldn't get them to get the least bit crispy, unless I just burnt them to a crisp!

So they weren't really fries--just seasoned, baked sweet potato slivers--and for that they were good.

I really enjoyed these, and I'm not a big sweet potato fan.  Will definitely make them again.  They don't taste much like regular fries but rather work on their own merits - so view this as trying a new recipe, rather than making a substitute for something else.  Having said that, they go great with ketchup and hamburgers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is only so-so.  I don't think they had the consistency of a french fry at all.  They were soggy! Per others suggestions I only microwaved 2 1/2 minutes and then I baked for 45 minutes in attempt to have them crisp up.  I even broiled for a few minutes to try and had crispness.  This was still not accomplished.  My fries were sliced just slightly larger than a standard fry.  The taste was decent enough, but they had more of a baked potato consistency than a fry.  I will try again only because they are a healthy alternative. Next time I will try not to pre-nuke at all and just bake for about an hour.

Clearly I am not doing something right because these things were not even close to crispy. My kids liked them anyway but they were pretty soggy. And I only microwaved them 1/2 the recommended time, as I had read in earlier reviews. Too bad. But I will try again anyway. It's a good idea and surely I can make it work eventually.

My family enjoyed these fries.  I cut the recipe in half and it was still plenty.  A healthy alternative to white potatoes.  However, I won't microwave them next time - too flimsy.  I will make these again.

We eat these all the time, delish!  I cut the sweet potatoes up so that they're only about a quarter inch thick, and only put them in the microwave for one min with no water. They don't ever really come out crispy, but they're awesome w/ketchup!

Its just my husband and I made these with our burgers last night. I only made one potato- they are pretty big. GREAT recipe, just a tad sweet but super healthy. Thanks.

Too mushy on the inside--maybe less microwave time? They still had a nice flavor (since I love sweet potatoes), but they need to be worked with a bit.

I cut the fries smaller than the recipe suggests - they were roughly 1/4" thick and 3" long. After reading the other reviews, I only microwaved them for 2 minutes, and then baked them for about 30 minutes. They weren't crispy, but I still enjoyed them. My husband (not big on spices) thought they were too spicy, while I thought they needed some more kick. 

Next time I make them, I'll split the fries into 3 sections - one with the lemon pepper/Italian seasoning, one plain, and one with cayenne pepper and garlic.

These came out really yummy, I never thought of pre cooking the potatoes in the microwave. They didn't come out quite as cripsy as I would like and maybe next time I'll be a bad girl and fry them.

These were delicious! I cut them thinner and omitted the lemon pepper, but we sure enjoyed them. Don't expect them to taste like french fries or have the exact texture and you will be pleasantly surprised by the results. We used thousand island dressing as a dip.

We did like these, even though they were quite soft.  And we did like the lemony taste - it didn't take away from the total taste to us.  Next time, however, I might try the chili powder, like someone else suggested.  We will do these again.
