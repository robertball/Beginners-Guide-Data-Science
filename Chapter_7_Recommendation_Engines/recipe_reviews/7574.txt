Thanks Carol for this wonderful recipe.  I made this wedding cake recipe for a wedding celebration for one of my co-workers.  Everyone raved about it.  They liked that it was a very traditional wedding cake.  If you are old enough to have gotten white wedding cake in a cardboard box to take home from a wedding then you know what I am talking about.  The cake is dense yet moist.  It was very easy to cut to create the tiers.  I used non-melting wax paper instead of parchment paper since I couldn't find parchment paper - it worked fine.  I wouldn't call this cake "plain" but rather elegant and simple, it has a very slight fruity taste to it. I recommend you buy the shortening (Crisco) that is not butter flavored to keep the cake very white.  I also made the ornamental icing, but did have to add a bit more cream to get it smooth enough. You definitely need to use a large mixer rather than a hand-held to mix the frosting.  The ornamental icing recipe frosted the cake, decorated it, and still plenty was left over.  My friend decorated it and the cake looked gorgeous.

I thought that from all the fairly positive reviews that this was going to be a pretty good cake.  I made it twice and the cakes fell both times. (silly me, I thought it would turn out better the second time)  The texture was that of a dry, crumbly angel food cake. Not the kind of cake to slice and fill.

OK, I have baked for over 30 years and this is simply the most delicious wedding cake!  Yes, it is more like a pound cake, but most folks like that.  We live in China, and I had to bake it in an impossible tiny oven and it still was moist and delicious!!!  Only one problem-there is no way that 3 tiers of 5, 8, and 10 inches add up to 150 servings.  DO the math! Most cake pages will tell you that at the most an 8 and a 10 inch put togther will give you 30 servings, add the 5 inch layer and I am mystified that you get to 150 servings.  Perhaps if you make 4 of them!  I used the 150 serving recipe to make 2 9x13s, with 32 servings each (about a 2x2),but you could stretch that to 48 each for a total of 96 servings-max! And that would be a very tiny serving. Why would you want to serve a postage stamp slice of this delicious cake?  I read the other reviews but was puzzled that no one else commented on the portions being wrong.  Would love to see how anyone got 150 servings out of this.   Liz May

I tried this and it came out GREAT!!! Nice recipe Carol!! Nice dense texture. I made this cake as a request for Valentine's day. I marbled my cake and the white/chocolate blend was just right. there was enough batter to make 2 full 8" cakes and the 10" as the recipe says. We tried some of it the day it was baked and it was a bit dry and bland. The following day, we tried it again and what a difference!!! The extra time allows the full flavor to come through. The cake was layered with chocolate ganache. Then topped with another layer of ganache, striped with white chocolate and trimed with almond buttercream roses. ABSOUTELY MARVELOUS!

I made this cake for my parents' 25th wedding anniversary party and everyone loved it.  I didn't have orange extract on hand, so I used almond and vanilla instead; it was wonderful.  I will be using this recipe a lot!

Made this for my brother's wedding. Changed one thing. Instead of orange extract added a little vanilla extract and added less quantities of the extracts than called for. I used a buttercream icing for the top and sides of the cake, and nutella in between the layers, and decorated with ferrero rocher chocolates. THE BEST CAKE EVER!!!!!

I got so many compliments with this cake! I used vanilla extract instead of the orange. I also didn't make a tier cake. I used one batch to make a dozen cupcakes, one character pan, and one double layer 6" cake.

I used this recipe for my best friend's wedding after trying two others. It is WONDERFUL! Maybe those that said it was dry over whipped their egg whites because I did not find that to be the case with my cake. I did have to double the recipe to produce thick enough layers with a 12", 8", and 5" round pans. We did fill the layers with strawberry and lemon fillings and that did help with the moistness. Great recipe!

Really good cake.  More like a sponge cake, and seemed dry.  I scaled it to make 24 servings made that's why.  I'll try again and 150 serving scale.But overall the best scratch cake I've made so far!

As a trained chef in the field I have to say this recipe dissapointed me. I made it today for a mothers day dessert and found out the cake flavor is good it is not moist, too dry crumbles easily hardto frost and layer with fondant. I honestly would not recommend this one.

Okay all, I made this cake for my son's wedding. I loved it and received so many compliments. You do have to follow the directions to the letter, except I also used the vanilla and almond extracts. This cake is like an angel food cake but more dense. So all of you that tried it and failed try it again, I promise you will love it. This cake does take time and it does need to be refrigerated overnight before you eat it, so if you can't do these two things then try an easier cake.

I must admit I was a little worried about using this for my nephews wedding cake because of some of the really negative reviews.  However, it is a wonderful cake - it holds up very well as the bottom tier of a 3 tiered cake - it was moist and had a lovely vanilla flavour.  Because I was filling it with raspberry buttercream I left out the orange and almond extracts.  The problem others have had may be because they didn't use CAKE flour as the recipe dictates.  I doubled sifted it and as a result it had a very fine crumb.  I reduced the yield to 50 and it was just right - made in an 11" X 3" pan.

If you read the reviews comparing this to "sweet cornbread," be warned: They weren't joking in the slightest. Don't waste your time on this recipe unless you actually want a recipe for cornbread.

This wedding cake was absolutely wonderful! It was perfectly moist and the density was perfect for covering with fondant. The only change I made was to use coconut extract instead of the orange. This recipe will be used for my wedding cake!

I loved this cake.  The only thing I would change is the orange extract for vanilla but other wise it was easy and tasted great.  I covered it with fondant with no problem, it was very sturdy but moist as well.

Mundane. Not a particularly bad cake, but not extraordinary. I scaled to 13 servings and it was perfect for a single 8 inch round cake. It didn't fall, the crumb was tender and the extracts were nice. However, it tasted flour-y and was quite dense. To me, it is an ordinary white cake, exactly the same as any home cook would whip up (and probably with less fuss). I will continue looking. Thanks anyway.

This recipe tasted very blah and it was way too dense for the light white wedding cake I was going for.  It was pretty bad.  I started with another recipe.  Don't bother with this one.

I actually made this cake for my own wedding.  My first experience making a wedding cake.  I have made bigger cakes in the past, but never NEEDED them to be perfect.  Imagin my frustration when I realized that there was too much batter for the bowl.  Oops.  The cake was yummy but a little plain compaired to other weddings I have been to.  However, finding this recipe and being able to make my own wedding cake was an amazing experience!  My husband was VERY impressed.

The recipe was pretty easy to follow, but it didn't turn out as light and moist as I was hoping.  It was rather dense and dry, more like a pound cake.  I think this would be useful if you needed something strong for making tiers, but otherwise the texture is not great, however the flavour was quite good.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and he loved it. Anyone who loves white cake will love this recipe. I just tweaked the recipe a little. I left out the orange extract and used lemon extract instead.

Yum, yum, yum!!! Oh what a tragedy~!  I was toying with the idea of making my own wedding cake...so I had my eye on this recipe.  This cake is easy and delish, but wow...it completely FELL in the oven, looked like 2 giant craters in the cake pans when I looked in the oven.  I figured that was fixable...well, they wouldn't come OUT of the pan!  I'm not a professional baker, don't own any parchment and don't trust my oven not to start a fire....so when I turned the pans over, the 2 halves went to heck in a handbasket.  Also...use regular baking vanilla.  I tried the cake...delicious, spongy...not even close to what i was looking for...yet wonderful.  It tastes like an orange creamsicle if you use that extract.  I'm going to buy some vanilla pudding and salvage the wreck of a cake into a layered torte with madarin oranges and flaked coconut for my friend's birthday (the reason I was test-running the recipe).  I say hire a regular baker unless you've got some wonder-oven, or are making cupcakes...or you don't care about presentation and can spoon some cake-ruin onto each guest's plate.

This is the worst cake recipe I've ever tried. The cake crumbled and was very dry. I used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract instead of the almond and orange extracts. It tasted so bad, that the cake was ineatible.

This cake is wonderful! I used this recipe to make my first ever wedding cake. I made a 3 tier cake (12" bottom, 9" middle, 6" top) with 3 - 1 inch layers for each tier. I tripled the recipe and used an additional 2/3 of a recipe. You could probably cut it down to 3 recipes total and be fine because I  ended up cutting quite a bit off the tops. It is a little dry, but the frosting moistens it. I did a practice run with the recipe and didn't use the almond extract. The cake was too tart. It is perfect with the orange and almond extract combo.

I made this cake for my own wedding. I put a strawberry filling between the layer and used a cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved it. My photograph told me it was the best wedding cake she has ever had and she has been to a lot of weddings. I have even made it for our anniversaries thank you for sharing this wonderfully yummy cake recipe.

I have made this twice.  The first time, I used a gluten-free flour blend I found on the Land 'O Lakes website.  The rice flour made the texture a little gritty, but the flavor, density, and moistness were good.  Most recently, I made it as directed and it was a little dry.  I may have over-mixed it or over-baked it.  Refrigerating it overnight would probably help.  I'm going to try this one again.  My home is at 7200 feet, and at high altitude, the decreased atmospheric pressure allows baked goods (and everything else) do dry more quickly.  I might try adding more liquid.  I didn't have problems with the center falling.  If you do, you might need to add a little more flour to help strengthen the structure.  At high altitude especially, the decreased air pressure allows baked good to expand more quickly.  The lack of strucure doesn't allow them to hold, and they fall creating sunken craters in the middle.  Even if you're not at high altitude, information in the book "Pie in the Sky" by Susan Purdy will help you better understand the baking process and trouble-shoot recipes.  I believe this is a quality recipe and deserves more than one try.

Something is wrong with the recipe.  It did not make. You should never mix a whole cup of sugar with egg whites.  I should have known better.

Also, it was on the dry side.

The most amazing recipe, follow it to the letter and it turns out awesome!  Fluffy, moist and perfect density for a cake or making cupcakes.  Well done whoever made this up or passed it along, love love love it!

The looks of this cake was very pretty, so I was pleased when I pulled it from the oven. But just like the reviews say, it is dense and tasteless. It was moist though

This was not what I expected.  The cake was dry and dense and the flavor was missing the rich flavor of wedding cake.  To make it worse I used wedding cake icing on this website and had made a better crisco icing before.  The orange extract should be cut in half and maybe I would use buttermilk next time.

I couldn't remember which recipe I'd used last time that was so delicious, but since I was out of sour cream, I decided to make this one. The taste was very good but I sent it to work with my boyfriend because it was so dry and dense. With lots of frosting I would eat it, but not what I was hoping.
