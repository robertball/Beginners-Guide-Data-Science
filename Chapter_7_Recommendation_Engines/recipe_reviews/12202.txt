We really enjoyed this fresh, light and creamy dessert!  Only to save calories as well as carbs, I skipped the crust entirely, which I'm sure, given the rest of the recipe, is delicious. But Hubs and I DO like our desserts on a regular basis so I try to be careful on occasion where I can.  I used frozen, thawed strawberries and Splenda instead of sugar.  This was a  delicious, nutritious and guilt-free strawberry mousse!

I got a lot of compliments on this recipe. The recipe is confusing as written because it doesn't indicate whether you're supposed to use the white sugar or the brown sugar at particular points in the recipe. So when I made it, I used white sugar both times and 2/3 a cup both times.  I used thawed frozen strawberries and added some of the leftover juice to the strawberry mixture and I suppose this is why my strawberry mixture didn't expand as much as other people's seemed to. I had to add some cream of tartar to help stabilize and give my strawberry mixture some volume.  I also used almonds instead of walnuts because I'm not a walnut fan and almonds seemed to go better with it.   Next time I make this, I would double the crumb mixture to make a more substantial crust in the bottom of the pan. The crumbs sprinkled over top were nice and crispy despite the lack of baking them.

I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 baking dish. This is very easy and very tasty. I used lime juice as I had fresh-squeezed juice left from another recipe. I also baked the extra crumbs in a separate baking dish for a crunchier topping. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone really enjoyed this! It is very easy and fun to make and you end up with a refreshing, light, pretty dessert. I used my Kitchen Aid and at the 9 minute mark, it was almost coming over the top of the bowl.  I was a little worried that it wasn't going to fit in the pan. Once the whipped cream is folded in, it is the perfect amount. It may be a little difficult to cut immediately out of the freezer. I decided to let it sit for about 10 min on the counter and it was perfect for us. This will be a repeat here. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!  I used cool whip in place of heavy cream & threw in some crushed graham crackers in the crust in place of walnuts (didn't have any!) turned out divine!

I was not impressed by this.  It had the taste and texture of freeze dried strawberry ice cream.  I would not make it again.

I took this for a potluck at work.  Everyone loved it.  My only complaint is that it MUST be kept very cold otherwise it turns runny...perhaps a touch of unflavored gelatin might help?  Very light and refreshing.  I used almonds instead of walnuts, just a personal preference.  I was a little disappointed that the crust did stick to the pan despite the use of Pam.  Will most likely make this again but with some modifications.

This recipe has been in my family for generations and over the years the name was changed to strawberry yummy because it is so yummy!! If you are looking for something light and refreshing this is it!!! The only thing that I differ from the recipe is, whether I and using frozen berries or not I always use 2/3 cup sugar and 2 cups berries. If using frozen, they must be thawed!

Wasn't very surprising, tasted kinda like the Good Humour Strawberry Ice Cream Bars. I also baked the crumbs that are suppose to be on top. It just didn't seem right to eat cold butter on top of a dessert. It definitely gave it some texture.

Light summer dessert -- like strawberry ice cream pie!  The sugars are a little confusing -- I believe the brown sugar goes with the crust, and the white sugar with the strawberries.

We substituted oats for walnuts (very tasty), and soy whipped topping.  If you're worried about raw egg whites, you can pasteurize your eggs by putting them in 140-150 degree hot water for 4 minutes.  This keeps in the freezer for several weeks, making it great for if you want to make a dessert ahead of time.

This is a great dish.  I really enjoyed it as did my guests.  However, the recipe itself is confusing.  I used the brown sugar for the crust and the white sugar for the filling. Also, I melted the butter before mixing it in.  It would have been odd to me to have chunks of non melted butter in my crust on bottom and on top.

This was very simple. Since it's strawberry season here in Oregon and the  strawberries are ridiculously sweet, I used only 2/3 cup sugar in the recipe and the flavor was perfect. I would also recommend lining the baking dish with foil to pull out slices easier.

I made this recipe for our Father's Day lunch and everyone loved it!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to halve the amount of sugar in the strawberry mixture from 1 cup to 1/2 cup and I doubled the ingredients for the crust as I had read in a previous review.  I thought it could be a little less sweet still (I tend to be more sensitive to sugar than most) however, everyone else said it had just the right amount of sweetness. I placed the pie in the refrigerator overnight, instead of the freezer as suggested, and noticed the strawberry part was a little soft. I then put it in the freezer for another 2 1/2 hours before we left the house and noticed it firmed up a bit. However, the crust was especially hard to break into and most servings were scooped out without the bottom crust. Next time I'll use the amount of crust that's suggested rather than double it because maybe that's why it was hard to break. It was nice to have more crumbly bits on top, though, which I baked separately so the butter wouldn't still be raw. As others have said, it was light, refreshing and quite pretty to look at. I, too, was afraid that the mixer bowl wasn't big enough to hold all of the strawberry mixture (and bits of it flew out from time to time) while it was running for 10 minutes but it did work out perfectly.  I am definitely making this recipe again! Thanks, v monte!!

I made this twice, once I put it in the freezer like the recipe calls for and it came out rock solid. I was unable to cut the crust! And another time I put it in the fridge, it was very light and fluffy but not very solid. what am i doing wrong? It didn't look like the picture at all! Despite this, it still tasted GREAT and I will be attempting it again

Tastes a bit like ice cream. I didn't think it was very sweet at all since it's so light and not decadent. I've never tasted a strawberry chantilly before.

served this dessert for dinner last evening. My husband LOVED it.  I modified it only slightly. To the whipped cream, I folded in some soft vanilla ice cream and it turned out beautifully.  This a superb dessert to serve guests and family.

I've made this dessert for years and it's always a hit.  Like others, I use less sugar and always use frozen berries that have been thawed.  I also use pecans instead of walnuts and sprinkle some of the crumb mixture on top.  Yummmy!

Excellent, family loved.  We did leave out the walnuts,due to family allergies. And even, for a quicky, used cool whip instead of heavy whipped cream. Turned out delicious!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  We did substitute salted cashews for the walnuts, but we think we would have liked it better our way anyway.  The salt and sweet is a good combination.

Awesome! I'd never made this sort of dessert before and was curious about beating the mixture 10 minutes but after ten minutes it became clear. (Nice, stiff mixture) As suggested by another reviewer, I also let the crust cool before adding the filling. Oh, yea, I didn't have nuts left after making Zucchini Bread so I left them out.

I was a little worried about when to put the cream mix onto the crust since it was hot out of the oven and the directions don't tell you a lot, so I cooled the crust in the freezer and then topped it with the fluffy stuff. It was really easy and so yummy!

Every one enjoyed this very much on a hot Atlanta day.  The only problem I had was the strawberry's hitting the mixer blades made a mess.  I would suggest putting in the chopped strawberrys toward the very end.  I also made a full recipie and used an 8 x 8 pan.

So delicious! It's also a pretty much guilt-free dessert. I made a half, crustless version, cutting back a tad on the sugar. Before transferring to an 8x8 pan, I scooped out a dish for myself to try now, while it's still light and mousse-like fluffy. Some mentioned it was so hard out of the freezer, so I wanted some in this state.  I topped the serving with crumbled shortbread cookies that I had on hand; you get that cookie-crust taste without the work! It does add another layer of sweetness and texture. A full version would surely be good for a crowd. Will see how it is out of the freezer overnight. UPDATE 6/25: Out of the freezer, it's like ice cream but not creamy. If you're looking for an ice cream cake-type dessert, this would be good. I prefer the mousse-like texture before freezing. I'll see what happens by now returning to the refrig. UPDATE: Turned back into a mousse which I preferred. Plan to try with raspberries.

This is my sons favorite birthday 'cake'.  I make it with fresh strawberries and cool whip and use a pre-made graham cracker crust - top it with more cool whip - wonderful!

No changes. This is an awesome, quick spectacular dessert.  I made it in a 9x13 pan, cut in squares to serve.  If you wrap and freeze the individual squares you have a quick fun dessert on a moments notice. Love this recipe.

This is a very light and refreshing dessert that would be perfect for a crowd because it makes a very full 9x13 pan.  I would cut back a smidgeon on the sugar because we don't like things too sweet but it was very refreshing on a hot summer's day.

This recipe was loved by the crew!  The only change I might make however is leaving out the Lemon juice next time and see how it turns out.  I found it a little tart but otherwise would definitley hit the spot on a hot day outside.  I may try substituting the strawberries for raspberries as well!

I made this for my family and my husbands son fiancé and daughter. It was a great dessert for hot weather and it felt like we were eating something healthy! I couldn't find a strawberry compote for the bottom to dress up the plate so I skipped that part. Everyone loved the crumbled crust but it was scarce. If making it again I may double that part of the recipe. It was fun to make the homemade whipped cream too! Overall everyone at dinner loved the dessert!

I loved this recipe, I made it twice in a week. The only problem was we had a really hard time removing servings from the pan, the crust really stuck. Maybe some Pam spray next time, otherwise GREAT recipe .

My family really enjoyed this light dessert! The reason it earned 4 stars instead ofn5 is due to the crust sticking to the bottom of the pan. The longer it was out of the freezer, it became possible to disengage the crust; but then the filling softened. I did grease the bottom of my dish,but that made no difference. Next time I might try  parchment paper.

I made it exactly as written and it came out excellent. I do recommend waiting at least the 6 hours but better if left overnight to get a better frozen consistency.

Love this recipe, but agree with the comments about the difficult crust.  Here's my solution.  Several hours before:  Preheat oven to 300.  Mix flour, brown sugar and butter until crumbly.  Stir in nuts.  Line 9 x 13 baking dish with parchment paper.  Press mixture onto paper.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Refrigerate for several hours.  Remove from paper in one piece; return crust to baking dish.  This way, the crust doesn't stick to the pan.  However, it is still difficult to cut because the crust is so hard.

Followed the directions exactly, to me this was my weakest recipe. Recipe was a little confusing to a novice like me. Crust stuck to the pan, and the overall dish was so-so.

I was given this recipe years ago my a friend, and have made it many times for family and friends.  I hope to clear up a few questions about the sugars and the crust.  First, the brown sugar goes in the crust, as many of you guessed, with the soft butter, flour, and nuts if you are using them.  Put these ingredients in a 9 X13 pan and mix well.  Spread out in pan, and bake at 350 degrees,  stirring often.  Allow to cool.  Reserve 1/2 for top, and press the rest in the pan.   Hope this helps!

We know this as Strawberry Pink Cloud, family favorite, Easter, showers etc. Can be made in individual cups, or in one pan.

The texture of the filling was cool and refreshing. I loved the flavor. Like many of the other reviewers, I had trouble getting the crust out. I ended up crumbling the crust ontop instead, and it worked great!

Followed the instructions exactly.  It never did get fluffy like that picture. Froze it, then it was hard as a rock and hard to work with. After letting it thaw out for a few mins, it ran all over the plate. If I were to make it again, I would use half the strawberries, slice them, and definitely not whip them for 10 minutes!!  Yes, too much sugar, as others have said. Pretty disappointed.

I have made this twice and each time it has turned out fantastic! Light, airy, cool & refreshing dessert. Both times I have not reserved crumbs for the top but baked it all into the crust. I did not need to whip the egg white mixture nearly as long as the directions suggest. The mixture was whipped in 4-5 minutes with my standing mixer. On my second attempt I actually used gluten free flour to accommodate a relative that avoids gluten, and honestly, I think I liked it better. The fresh berries I used were very sweet on my second try and I was able to cut the sugar back from 1 cup to 3/4 cup with no noticeable difference in taste or texture. I really like  this recipe and will definitely make it again. Thanks!!
