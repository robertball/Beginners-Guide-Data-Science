I followed a reviewer's suggestion and added some orange bell pepper. It tasted great, but I didn't like the giant glob of cheese on top. Next time, I will mix in more cheese with the eggs and sprinkle a thin layer of cheese on top along with some bread crumbs.

This was very good and easy.  I didn't add the sugar because the squash and onions are already sweet.  Also, I also put a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg in the egg mixture before combining.  The nutmeg really added a nice layer to the flavors.

This is VERY similar to the casserole I came up w/ only I didn't write down the measurements so I'm glad to see this one for next time. I opted to use a little more squash (5 small ones) and add a buttery bread crumb topping. My kiddos and hubby really liked it!I think adding finely diced green pepper would be good too. I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning and it was wonderful!  If you add ham, it could make a great brunch dish! Thanks for posting!!

Great way to get veggies into my kids.  When I told my family what we were having for dinner, they were concerned.  They were pleasantly surprised.  When you take it out of the oven, it will look runny.  Don't worry, just let it set for the 15 minutes.  Good as is, but very versatile.

This is not a good recipe at all. Too much sugar and too much butter. I do not recommend it

I wanted this to be more of a breakfast casserole, so I diced the squash, and added 1 lb ground sausage, 2 additional eggs (6 total), 2 Tbsp more milk (4 Tbsp total), and 1 tsp. ground mustard. I decreased the butter to 4 Tbsp. I browned the sausage before adding if to the squash/butter/egg mixture. I also mixed in 2 c. of cheese. I put the last 1 c. of cheese across the top. I omitted the sugar and flour as well.

This is a wonderful base start. I didn’t have enough cheddar so I used some truffle goat cheese to. I added some spicy yaggers (sausage) and Canadian bacon. Threw in a little broccoli that needed to be used up. I omitted the sugar.

This is with out a doubt the best squash casserole I  have  ever had.  I used seasoned salt  and used pepper jack cheese along with the cheddar cheese and it turned out fabulous. I would recommend this  to all. It is the consistency of a quiche.

I added sliced zucchini and chopped bell peppers to the recipe. I used only half the cheese and no butter or sugar. It was very easy to make, tasty and filling. I will make it again.

My husband and I thought this was delicious! I cut the butter down to 4 Tbsp, used 5 squash, and only used 2 cups shredded cheese. Mixed in most of the cheese, and just saved a little to top with. We did think it was very sweet. I will cut it down to 1 Tbsp of sugar next time. Serve with some green beans, and this is a perfect meatless dinner.

To be fair, I made a lot of changes, but I think some of them were definitely for the better. I took advice from other reviewers.
I didn't have summer squash on hand, so I used one of each: butternut, kabocha, and acorn. I precooked them in the microwave and they worked very well. If I were to use summer squash next time I would definitely use more than 3.
I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.
Added 4 cloves of minced garlic
6 eggs instead of 4
4 Tbsp milk
2 cups shredded mozzarella mixed in and 1 cup shredded cheddar on top (any cheese that can be shredded would work)
No flour or sugar (it was plenty sweet - I wouldn't have been able to eat it with the sugar, and the eggs held the casserole together no problem)
S&P as described, though perhaps a little extra salt may have worked (cheese is so salty, so I was nervous about that)
No butter (why add extra fat? It definitely was not needed. Cheese provides all the fat this dish needs)
Diced bell pepper
1 tsp dijon mustard - I'm going to use 1 Tbsp next time.
I served it with hot sauce and veggies on the side.
I may add mushrooms next time.

This wasn't a big hit with my family, but it's nice and healthy and vegetarian, so I'm adding it to my rotation.

Very good.  I did adjust a little.   I used only 4 tablespoons of butter, and did not use the sugar.  I added a little bell pepper.  Lastly, I used 1 1/2 cups cheese  in the casserole, and then  put 1 1/2 cups on top in the last 15 minutes of baking, thus preventing a thick hard crust.  Less butter and no sugar did not hurt this recipe at all.

The extra cheese on top was hard to get through and a quick and easy ingredient to skip while watching your intake. I mix in the 1 cup of cheese.

I use two large zucchini and add diced garlic while sautéing the zucchini and onion. I cover the top with one cup of shredded cheese instead of two so it comes out with a thin layer of crispy cheese. My family loves it, especially when served with ham and roasted potatoes.

Used squash from my garden and am quick freezing individual servings for eating in the winter, when I am longing for my veggie garden.  I omitted the sugar and veg oil, but never the butter.  Thank you for this simple, yet ymmy recipe.

Just what I was looking for - a yellow squash recipe without crackers, etc.  We like things a little zipier so added a couple of dashes of Tony's, nutmeg, had 4 yellow squash, 4T butter, used 'red' sea salt.  My husband grew up in a family that sweetened veggies so this great with him!

We just loved this...followed recipe exactly.  This would be a great brunch casserole.  I might start adding garlic or other seasonings, but it is delicious just as it is!
