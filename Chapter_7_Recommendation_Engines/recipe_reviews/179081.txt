This meal is ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!! It is my #1 all-time comfort food, but unfortunately Campbell's has decided to take it off the market...BIG MISTAKE in my opinion!! The one thing that I will say to do differently than the box directions is to cook the dish for about an hour as opposed to 30 minutes. This makes the chicken perfect and ensures that the rice is well-cooked and tender rather than runny. At any rate, THIS IS AN AWESOME MEAL AND I PRAY CAMPBELL'S COMES TO THEIR SENSES AND BRINGS IT BACK!!! I found 8 boxes at Big Lots on closeout, and am counting down the sad days til they're gone....
