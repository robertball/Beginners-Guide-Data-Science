So tasty!  I had to substitute the green curry paste with red curry paste , because I wasn't able to find the green.   (I went to 3 markets) Regardless it turned out great!

Turned out fan-freaking-tastic.  Couldn't find Gem Lettuce, used Romaine instead.  Will make again!  And again!  Found the meat at Costco.

This was a dinner party recipe that was a HIT! I only had time to marinate for  4hrs, but it was flavorful, easy, and beef tender. I can only imagine overnight marinade would be even better  (if thats possible).  One of my guests requested the leftover (I made ALOT) to be served with his eggs in the morning! Definitely will be making again soon.

We made the salad to go with the steak per Chef John's suggestion. It was very good. Make sure you use Asian fish sauce made from anchovies, NOT the basque fish sauce made from sherry wine.
