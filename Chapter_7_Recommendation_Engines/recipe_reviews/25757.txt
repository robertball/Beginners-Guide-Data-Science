I used about 4 and a half cups of chicken broth instead of the 3 cups of water and didn't have bok choy on hand so I chopped up some leafy lettuce.  What a great surprise this turned out to be.  My son was disappointed when he went for his 3rd bowl and found the pot empty.  The 3 of us ate it up!

This recipe was quick and easy but a bit bland. Added soy sauce to taste and a hit of hot sauce...really perked it up.

Very easy to make and good. I used 4 cups of water and had spinach on hand to replace the bok choy. I added a teaspoon of soy sauce and Asian seasoning from Pampered Chef. Next time I'm going to use the Oriental Ramen Noodles and 1/2 of the seasoning packet.

This was a quick weeknight dinner that pleased the whole family.  I didn't add the bok choy because I knew my kids would just pick it out, so I added some chopped broccoli instead. I also added sliced mushrooms.  I cooked the chicken with soy sauce and garlic/herb mix.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. I would use chicken broth in place of the water next time.

This was very tasty. I doubled the recipe, so we had some leftover, and it was even better the next day, after the flavors had blended. I also added chicken bouillon to the water (since I didn't have chicken broth on hand), and also used shredded lettuce instead of bok choy (a little mushier, but still good). My four year old liked it enough to finish one small bowl - and as finicky as she is, that's saying something! My hubby loved it. Quick and easy, and de'lish - will make again!

It's not that this is bad, it's just glorified top ramen.  I don't know why I expected more.  I read the ingredients, but just expected that it would have more flavor.

Doubled recipe and fed 3 adults. Altered recipe as follows: in 4c chicken broth, boiled thinly sliced baby carrots & 1 can drained sliced mushrooms for 3-5 min. Then added 2 thinly sliced green onions (including green parts), 2 pkg broken up Ramen Noodles, only 1 flavor pkt from the noodles & 2c fresh baby spinach.  Cooked 3 minutes longer. If I had it on hand, I would have added chicken as well. Served alongside sandwiches.

Quick and easy lunch for us.  My 1 year old loves Ramen noodles, and this was healthier than just cooking them with the season package. My 4 year old who doesn't like cooked carrots ate this up too. I cut the carrots very small. A definite keeper!

A nice way to upgrade ramen noodles.  It needed a bit more flavor so I added a pinch of ginger and garlic salt.

Good, quick soup w/simple ingredients. As other reviewers suggested I used chicken broth and used about 4 cups. I also added a little soy sauce, otherwise stuck to the recipe. If you can get the baby bok choy, I recommend it.

I thought this was a good starter recipe. It was a little bland so I did some things to add flavor but it was still lacking something. I liked that it was a one dish meal that I could prepare while juggling the kiddo and the housework, and will definitely make it again with a few extras (chicken broth instead of water, garlic, onion, maybe some of those little corn on the cobs...and some other seasonings)

Easy and delicious!  I used rotisserie chicken leftovers and canned, sliced carrots.  Also added 1 tsp. soy sauce, snow peas and baby bok choy.  Next time I'll use more bok choy or maybe try spinach.   My kids ate it right up.

I made it for one person, and used one pack of Ramen, same amount of veggies but less chicken and oil. I eat Ramen on a regular basis, and this is a good way to add vitamins and proteins to it. I would skip the oil next time, as I like the Ramen broth by itself, and would rather avoid the extra calories.
