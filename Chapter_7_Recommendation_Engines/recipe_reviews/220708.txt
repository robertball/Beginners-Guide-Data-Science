I made these for Easter this year and they went over really well. I think next time I will use a little more lemon flavor in the topping. As a side note, I used some of those lemon gummy candies that look like lemon wedges as a garnish on the top; they turned out cute and the gummy candy worked with the icing flavor.

I made these for a bridal shower and everyone LOVED them.  I did add a little lemon zest in the frosting rather then just the top.  I topped them with crushed up lemon head candy.

My daughter said that she wanted lemon cupcakes for her birthday, so I found this recipe. Everyone loved the cupcakes and even went back for seconds, which is unusual in our house! I used about two tablespoons of orange juice in the frosting instead of three. The frosting is very soft and very delicious. Another reviewer mentioned that the cupcakes didn't look very pretty because the frosting was too soft, so use a little less juice and problem solved! Delicious!

This rating is for the filling and the icing, not the cake.  The filling is truly delightful and a lovely surprise when you bite into the cupcake.  I might use a plainer frosting next time - to make the filling stand out more.  I used an icing tip to force it into the cupcake - it was quite easy - rather than cutting a hole in the cupcake and spooning it in.  I used Lemon Cupcake from AR for the cake itself as I prefer not to use a cake mix.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change anything, but I did add yellow food coloring to the filling, just for effect. I also put plenty of lemon zest on top, but that was just for appearances. The frosting was fairly runny, so it doesn't look to beautiful. But it tastes amazing.

These were  a hit but some adjustments are needed. Filling the cups 2/3 of the way full only makes a dozen large cupcakes so don't put that much in. For the orange juice, I only needed 1 tbs. instead of 3, so I'd say 1-2 is plenty depending how thick/thin you like yours. Will make again!

I followed this recipe as directed.  Made for my family gathering for Easter.  Big hit with lots of compliments.  Only change to make would be to reduce the orange juice as a bit too much and needed to add more icing sugar.  Will definitely keep this one as a favourite.

I used orange extract and lemon juice for the icing (to taste) and made the flavor perfect with the whole cupcake. The icing was fluffy and  extremely well balanced, and it all went together SO well. I made it with a freing, and we had to eatone before they were done because they were so irrisistable! I LOVE this recipe, and will most definantly do it again. These were heavenly!
