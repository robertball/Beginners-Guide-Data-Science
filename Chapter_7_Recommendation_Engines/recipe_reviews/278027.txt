Carnivores will never know it was made with Beyond Meat instead!  I doubled the sauce when I made it, laid out the ingredients into 3 bread size pans, and froze two of them.  When I was ready to use them, I thawed in the fridge all day and popped them in the oven after work.  Next time I'll probably add in some mushrooms, spinach and maybe layer in summer squash as well.

To make this a completely Plant-Based lasagna I made the following changes:
3 containers (total 24 oz) Kite Hill dairy-free Ricotta Cheese 
1 container (12 oz) Kite Hill dairy-free Sour Cream
1/2 cup Parma Parmesan Cheese Alternative
2 8-oz packages of Miyoko's Creamery Mozzarella 
1/2 cup JUST egg alternative
1 12.9-oz package of Field Roast Vegetarian Italian Sausage
1 12-oz package of Impossible Burger 
NOTE:  These changes are expensive!! Plant-based foods cost a good deal more than their non-vegan counterparts!
