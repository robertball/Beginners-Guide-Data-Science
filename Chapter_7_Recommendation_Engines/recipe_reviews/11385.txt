yummmm! This was also one of my mom's favorites, but she added some almond extract and dusted the cookies with confectioner's sugar.  As a matter of fact, my sister makes them for me whenever she needs to offer me a bribe, lol.

These were always Mom's 'go to' recipe for baby and wedding showers. They are light and crispy and can be colored to match the theme of the party. We just made some for a tea that we recently attended and tinted them green to match the springtime theme. They were a big hit with all. You can also make the dough ahead and freeze, then thaw, slice and bake just before the party.

I have this exact recipe cut out from the label of a Mirro brand cookie sheet in 1968. Petticoat Tails is a mispronunciation of Petits Gateaux Tailles or little cut cakes. I love this recipe. Have always divided the dough into halves, colored one half pink, then rolled up the two flattened halves to make a pretty spiral pattern when sliced, after the dough has been chilled. You can also roll the log of dough in colored sugar before chilling and you'll get a sparkling edge. I have even tried it with gluten free flour and they came out quite good.
