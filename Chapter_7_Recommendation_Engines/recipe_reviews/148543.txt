when i looked over this recipe, i couldnt figure out why nobody had reviewed it because it sounded so good. so i decided to give it a try. i made it for my boyfriend and my family for valentines day. my family loves spaghetti and they thought this recipe was fantastic! it is one of the best sauces i have ever tried and made. i highly suggest it!!! i made afew minor changes but mainly stuck to the recipe. it is so flavorful! if you are looking for a good sauce i would try this one.  changes i made: cut the sausage into tiny meatballs instead of lenghtwise  added all of the juice from the whole tomotoes  added extra basil and oragano to taste

This is the only way I ever make spaghetti. Soooo much better than making your meat sauce with ground beef.  To save time, I just remove the casings and break up the sausage with my wooden spoon as it cooks.  Try to find a good Italian deli to buy fresh sausage.

Indeed the best spaghetti I've made at home thus far (my husband's favorite spaghetti).  Gave it four stars because the amount of salt was a bit too much for us, so I reduced it to less than 1/4 tsp... we could probably do without added salt altogether.  We've made it with and without sausage- both good.  Also made it with 1 Tbsp. dried oregano vs. fresh... great that way too. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe got rave reviews from the family.  I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did!  Like others, I crumbled the sausage (I used lean turkey Italian sausage links) and cooked it with the ground beef mixture.  Absolutely wonderful!  This will be our permanent spaghetti sauce recipe.  Just as an FYI, if you prepare it this way, the sauce is VERY meaty.

Oh yeah!  One of the best spaghetti sauces I've found yet.  Hearty, flavorful, yet not an overpowering tomato base.  Made as written except I did use an additional 3 links of Italian sausage.  Like other reviewers, I sliced the sausage into small meatballs and didn't remove the casings.  Next time I'll use fresh basil and oregano, but used dried since this is what I had on hand.  Five minutes in the oven at 350* to melt the fresh parmesan cheese was perfect.  Thanks hungryguy for this amazing recipe!!

Well..well..well...what can I say that hasn't already been said?? This is THE BEST spaghetti I have ever tasted or made in my entire life!! It got rave reviews from my family and neighbor. Followed the recipe to a T..I always saute my fresh mushrooms and onions in olive oil and butter before adding to a recipe, I just love the flavor of the mushrooms....anyway probably added a little more garlic that called for but other than that right to the recipe.  We really liked the fact that it wasn't so "tomatoey", yum, it was absolutely delicious!!  This will be my go to recipe from now on..the search is over! I would love to know if this "navy chef" has any more recipes...I served this with Giada D. cheddar onion bread..my god it is wonderful, also. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I truly appreciate it.

This was extremely good. I served it to company with a green salad and some nice white bakery bread. I took the easy way out and added the sausage back into the sauce and just put Parmesan on the table for people to add on their own. As written, the presentation would be much more impressive, but this was simple and just as good.

I made a few small changes due to what I had on hand. I increased the garlic, I did not add the full amount of salt (just enough for flavor) and I drained off the liquid in the tomatoes and replaced the liquid I drained off with red wine. I did not have fresh oregano so I used dried. Very nice basic spaghetti sauce that was quick to prepare. I don't think it had too much meat, I think it was just right. Out of the whole skilletful, there is a small bowl of leftovers--I'd say my family liked it!

The bones of this sauce are good, but I felt it needed something... I used 3 links of sausage instead of 2.  Like other reviewers, I sliced in half and cooked, and then crumbled it in while simmering.  I also added an entire 28 oz can (juice and all) of whole peeled tomatoes, but cut them into smaller pieces as I have picky family members.  I couldn't find fresh oregano at the store, so used dry in 1/2 the amount.  After all together, my taster told me the sauce needed more depth to counter the salt and meat, so I added 1 can of tomato paste, 1 c of water, and about 1 T of sugar.  Now it's perfect!

This is by far the best spaghetti sauce recipe I've found on this site.  My family loves spaghetti and I really don't like it at all - that was until I tried this recipe.  Now, I look forward to them asking me to make spaghetti!  After I seared the sausage I cut into small chunks and added to sauce prior to simmering.  Really, really good stuff.

dElish! Pleasantly surprised out how good this sauce turned out!! I did scale this down to a serving for 2 using 1 large can of peeled whole tomatoes & a small jar of Prego 3 Cheese Spaghetti Sauce. I didn't remove my sausage casing, but rather cut them into smaller bite-size pieces & found them a little bit tough, so next time, will definitely remove casing & make them into meatball size!

Excellent! I didn't read the recipe carefully when I was gathering ingredients, so I ended up with bulk Italian sausage instead of links and diced tomatoes instead of whole. This was a delicious, meaty sauce. We really liked it. Thanks! :)

Made this a 2nd time with another slight modification - it is now my new favorite sauce recipe!  Doubled the recipe to have some for freezing...used 1 lb ground hot italian sausage (the spice was what was missing the first time), 2 lbs lean ground beef. Left out the olive oil and browned the meat w/ onions & garlic. Still didn't have fresh oregano, this time I only used 7tsp dried oregano instead of the 8 tsp it should've been...simmered for a bit over an hour.  Perfect!

Requested family favorite. Double up and freeze for later or give away to neighbors,friends and family for a variety of reason. Great with red wine, fresh salad, New York 5 cheese toast. Thanks for a great holiday meal that we have at least once of month.

Very hearty and chunky pasta sauce. I added about 1/2 cup red wine and let the sauce simmer all day! I put a few leaves of fresh torn basil on mine right before eating. YUM!

This is now THE spaghetti when I don't want to  cook the 5 hour sauce I usually make.  My husband is picky about his sauce and requested this again right away. Very easy to make.

Very good spaghetti.  Complements from my husband is a high honor because he makes his own from the garden every summer.  I don't think I'd ever like to have jarred sauce again.  I did cut the meat in half and it was still pretty meaty, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Flavor was really good.

I wasn't too crazy about this dish, but my boyfriend loved it. It was all meat and not near enough sauce. Once I added in some canned spaghetti sauce it was a nice mix.

Okay, I haven't even let it simmer yet...I just tasted it after mixing it in the pan and I had to run over and give it 5 stars already! I used fire-roasted tomatoes and Italian chicken sausage crumbled into the mixture instead of the beef. It smells so good! Can't wait for dinner; I'm sure it will be 6 stars by then.

I am usually not fond of sphagetti or pasta cos they have a strong tomato base. But this one was brilliant. It had the right amount of everything. I didnt have sausage at home so made it without it. Will try with it next time. My husband was very impressed with me. :)  4 stars cos it turned out a little dry after keeping in the oven. Maybe I kept it for a little too long. But tasted just perfect.

I thought this had a wonderful flavor.  I think I may have cooked off a little too much liquid though. My husband wasn't as thrilled since he likes more "saucy" spaghetti.  I'll try it next time with more liquid or just reduce the simmer time a bit.

I approached this recipe with some scepticism, since pasta sauces are what I DO, and I didn't see much that was unusual in this one.  Bottom line:  it was great.  I followed the recipe exactly regarding ingredients (except I "balled up" the sausage as another reviewed suggested, rather than cook and serve them whole).  Nor did I bake the cheese on top.  The flavors were excellent, and I will definitely include this in the current rotation of pasta sauces I make on a regular basis.

This is my new go-to spaghetti recipe! My family loved it! Like a few other reviewers, I broke the sausage apart as it was cooking, and let the sausage simmer in the sauce. Fantastic!

I thought this was pretty good. There just seemed to be something missing. I got a little worried when I tasted it at first, but as it cooked the taste began to come out more. I put this in a crockpot along with the sausage and let it simmer/cook on low for 5 hours.

I gave this four stars because it seems like the sausage as well as the beef is too much meat, but perhaps that's personal preference. Anyway this is a great, restaurant-style type of spaghetti sauce that's still easy to make with ingredients you have at home!

Excellent. Whole family loved it. A few minor adjustments. A lot of reviews here talked about how there was too much salt. So I did not add any salt until the sauce, and I used seasoning salt and salted to taste. Also I removed the whole tomatoes prior to serving. I also used 3 sausages instead of 2. I cooked them, then cut them into pieces instead of leaving them whole and then mixed with the beef, onions & garlic once the beef had browned. Everything else was made according to the recipe. Wonderful! I would make again, this is my new go to for Spaghetti. We ate late, so we didn't really have time to melt the cheese on top but I'm sure it would have tasted even better. In the future I would probably use a bit more sauce and use 4-5 sausages.

We really enjoyed this, made as written.  This is a really thick meaty sauce.... I prefer a more saucy sauce so next time I will double all the ingredients except the meet or add some pasta water.  Thanks for sharing, great flavor!

I made this recipe tonight and it smelled great while it was cooking.  It smelled better than it actually tasted though.  I think that it was the perfect consistency (I like thick sauces) but it rather lacked in flavor.  It needs something.  I bet it would be better with fresh basil and perhaps a longer cooking time.

This is nearly identical to what I have been making for years. I use bulk mild (or sweet) Italian sausage because it saves some effort. I also use all the juice from the tomatoes, use Italian Seasonings instead of measuring out this or that. I salt & pepper to taste . I do like to toss in a Parmesan rind if I have it, and a generous glug of red wine.

Update I made this twice while my taking care of family. Nagged me for the second batch. I cooked the Italian sausage with ground beef. Easier fur them to eat. Freezes like a dream. Your entire house smells wonderful. The postman delivering mail wanted the recipe! Easy to make out of stuff we always have on hand. Terrific flavor. Thank you!

The beauty of this sauce is in it's simplicity. It's a bit of a meat lover's sauce (personal opinion) but this makes a great base recipe to do whatever you want to do.

Just had the Camp David Spaghetti for dinner.  It was a hit.  I followed others and added some red wine, a teaspoon of sugar, used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes, and a little cayenne pepper.  It was delicious and when I said "I think I will make this again", my daughter said "I think I will eat this again"!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The email said "Way better than made using ground beef"... then I pulled up the recipe and the prime ingredient is ground beef with the Italian sausage laid on top.  Nothing special here, folks. Move along. 
I made it using ground bulk Italian sausage in place of the ground beef and it was EXCELLENT. This recipe above rates an average HO HUM! Might as well use canned sauce.

If you really want spaghetti that “pops”, use ground fresh pork sausage in lieu of hamburger.  I feel confident you won’t ever go back to making spaghetti with hamburger again!

I make mine with ground mild Italian sausage and hot Italian sausage links (casing on). The magic ingredient for my sauce is fennel (ground by using a pestle and mortar).

My whole family loves this spaghetti sauce.  Fresh oregano is critical to the fantastic taste, it's worth the effort, trust me.  My tiny changes include using a pound of hot Italian sausage, crumbled and cooked with the ground beef, and adding about a 1/2 cup of pasta water to the sauce when the pasta is finished cooking. I serve the pasta and sauce separately, my preference.
Over the moon delicious.

First off we loved this recipe!  I have to say during my time at Camp David I never had spaghetti this delicious, (then again I wasn't the President either).  The serving size vs the amount of sausage links has to be mentioned.  I think the that making the sausage as called for in the recipe is definitely the way to go, so I would have one sausage link per person.  The other item that many other reviewers have already stated was to reduce or omit the salt, I reduced the salt by half and used kosher salt and that worked for me.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Very tasty.

To the reviewer Guiseppe: I used Pomi tomatoes and tomato sauce.  We actually needed more salt, because Pomi puts nothing but tomatoes in their boxes.

Love this recipe! I did make some adjustment. First I sautéed the garlic and onion prior to cooking the meat. The only meat I used was turkey meat to make it a healthier version, everything else stayed the same.

Great recipe that you can adjust to your own taste.  I added more seasonings and red pepper flakes for a kick.  Thank you very much!  Very meaty.  Excellent the next day.  Loved this.

Question - in the recipe it states to use 1 can (16 oz) of whole tomatoes. But when I added the recipe to my shopping list, it listed it as 2 cans (14.5 oz) of whole tomatoes thereby bringing total to 29 oz. Which measurement is the correct one to use for this batch of ingredients?? I went ahead and used 1 can of 28 oz but not sure if I diluted the recipe in the process. Pls answer if u know. Thx!!!

Very delicious! Made this almost as listed and it rocked me! The only thing I did differently was added lots of other spices, I like bold flavor. ;) The longer it simmered, the better it tasted! Thanks so much for a great sauce!

I though this was very plain the first meal (after I cooked it for 2 hours).  However, it was really pretty good heated up the next day.  Guess the flavor gets better with time.  Still not certain that it's worth the effort.  Nothing to rave over - course, I'm not really a fan of spaghetti, anyway....

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars, the sauce is good but it needs a little more flavor.  I did not change anything in the recipe.

Other than the flavor of the sausage, I felt this sauce really lacked any taste. Since it did not call for many spices, I was skeptical and rightly so.  I would not make this again as I had to change the recipe quite a bit by adding  a multitude of Italian spices to suite our taste.

I made this mainly just for the sauce. Instead of putting the sausages on top and baking, I just crumbled the sausage, browned it, and added it to the sauce. The sauce is sooooo delicious. I added it to my angel hair pasta and was good to go!

I used 1/2 lb of 90% ground beef and just one large fresh Italian sasauge removed from casing and cut into pieces. I then fried up the meats, onions and garlic and added rest of ingredients using freshly sliced basil. I simmered about one hour.  Excellent! I Will surely make this again!

This was amazing. I did add 1/2 cup red wine, 15 oz diced tomatoes in addition to the whole tomatoes and sauce, 2 TBS tomato paste with herbs and a sprinkle of thyme. I hand crushed the whole tomatoes.

Added 14 cup dried parsley, 1 can 8 0z. mushrooms, (fresh, sauted in butter first would be better)

I cut the sausage into bite sized pieced before adding to sauce. Layered the pasta, sauce, cheese. Baked as directed.
The hour cooking, uncovered is a must do.
I did not have spaghetti pasta. Substituted wide egg noodles. Could not wait for  another trip to the grocery.  Will use spaghetti next time.
Did not have oven proof plates. Used one  9 x 13 LeCruset casserole. Grandson Said, "Oh, a casserole." He ate like any 18 year old growing 6'2"  boy. Will make again.

This sauce was  so good.  Loved the Italian sausage in it.  It really added to it.  I also added some celery, a little more garlic and used my garden tomatoes which were frozen in the freezer.

I once asked an Italian guy what the secret was to great spaghetti sauce and he told me italian sausage. I have been making it like that for probably 30 years. It's absolutely the best.

This was pretty tasteless. Ragu would be much better. Don’t bother with this one.

There are maybe 3 dishes I've ever eaten in my life that'd I'd give 5 stars.  That being said, this was very, very good and I rated it 4 stars.
 The only thing I did different was added a little butter & parmesan cheese to my noodles and then put the meat sauce on top of the pasta.  I left it in the oven less than 10 minutes-maybe 5 because I didnt want it to become dried out.

Not enough sauce for the amount of spaghetti.  Bland maybe better with dried oregano instead of fresh.  Don't need to bake it, dries it out.  Also don't like to mix the with the sauce, but followed directions.  Won't do that again.

Great recipe! My wife loved it. I had to substitute ground sausage because I couldn't get links. I think the links would add a nice texture difference.

I switched the ratios of sausage and beef (used turkey) and cut the pasta in half. Would have been way too much with an entire pound of pasta. My husband said it would have been good with mushrooms, I agree. Also used diced tomatoes instead of whole and dried oregano in place of fresh. Will definitely make this again!

Liked, but didn't love it.  I thought it was too much meat for the amount of sauce.  If you like lots of meat, then you might like it.  I prefer more sauce, so if I made it again I would only make it with 1/2 lb of ground beef (or ground sirloin).

This was ok.  Nothing special.  I mean the sauce was OK.  It certainly wasn't bad.  I'm not really sure what the oven part of it did for the dish other than heat up the sausage that was set aside for an hour or so.  But, my favorite part was the big hunk of sausage.  I probably will not make this again as it was unmemorable.

Wonderful! I used ground sweet Italian sausage since that was what I had thawed. I browned it with the beef. I didn't have whole tomatoes so I used garlic and onion diced tomatoes. It didn't seem like quite enough sauce for the meat for us, so I threw in a can of crushed tomatoes, too. Perfect! Thank you for a new favorite recipe!

loved this.  first time i've made spaghetti sauce and it was so easy and really good.  only change i made is that i browned the sausage and added it in with the beef instead of putting it on top at the end. and i used cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. whole family loved.

Great, I agree!  I have cooked this for guests and I have shared the recipe with a friend who loved it, too.  It's a keeper!

This was GREAT!  My husband doesn't like red sauce but he loved this!  We had this with a nice green salad and fresh french bread.  I will definately make this again!  It was a winner with my husband and you know when your husband is happy the food is GREAT!  Thanks for sharing  :)

GREAT! i didn't follow the recipe exactly had 'home-canned' tomatoes so they were more watery.used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. sauce was a little thin(my fault)i put the sauce(except for sausage-had to go buy it)in a crock-pot(for about 4-5? hrs)also used 4 cloves garlic(like garlic). sauce didn't get thick.my 4yr od daughter doesn't eat my spaghetti or sausage. she ate 2 helpings and the sausage!(i sliced it into big pieces and browned before putting it into sauce) awsome

Really tasty spaghetti sauce.  I added 1/2 a cup of white wine to the recipe.  I also cut the sausage up and added it back to the pot.  I was also tempted to add diced tomatoes the first time I made this, but it was not a swift move.  It is not meant to be a thin sauce.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this was. Leftovers are great also.
