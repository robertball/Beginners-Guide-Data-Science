This was really good! I used a whole onion instead of just half.  Hate to waste veggies (there's a thing going around on the net saying you should not keep cut onions for future use). This rice is very flavorful and the fragrance in the house while it cooks is amazing!  I threw in a handful of dried cranberries when it was done. Will definitely make this again!

We really liked this recipe.  I did increase the curry powder by 1 teaspoon but then again we like the curry flavor.  Will definitely make this again.  thanks for posting the recipe

I've been on a diet with no potatoes or wheat so I have been eating a lot of brown rice as a side dish. It's okay, but soooo bland.  This recipe was wonderful and I actually can't wait to make it again.  Very tasty.  Made exactly as directed.

Used canola oil instead of grapeseed oil.  Washed and drained the brown rice well before adding to the pot.  After it had sat for about 5 minutes I added some toasted sliced almonds and some chopped green onion.  One rice hater had two helpings!

Made as directed. Served it with sautéed veggies on top. Lots of flavor, good combination of spices. I searched for a brown rice based meal that I could serve for "meatless friday" (our new thing) and I will serve it again.

The perfect vegan dish! I added a cup of frozen peas and carrots to the recipe, simply delicious.

Very good.  I also used Penzey hot curry adding a bit extra plus I tossed in a handful of raisins to cook along with the rice.  Worked great.  Next time I'll mix raisins and dried cranberries in the mix.  I didn't have cumin seeds or garam masala but added a few shakes of ground cumin which seemed to work well.   Garam masala is now on my grocery list!

Too salty. Needs another tsp of curry. Did add craisins and pecans the last few minutes. I must have stopped it five minutes too early as rice needed a little more cooking.

A little salty for me but otherwise wonderful.  I'll skip the added half teaspoon next time.  And I adjusted cooking time for a brown and wild rice mixture, might have to add 15 minutes for that, but the steps and spices make a tasty recipe for probably any kind of rice.

Like others, I doubled the amount of curry and also added golden raisins. The taste and fragrance of this dish are heavenly, earning a blue ribbon from my family.

This is so, so good! The only thing I didn’t have was garam masala ( I can’t  find this anywhere ) and cumin seeds ( I just used ground cumin). My husband doesn’t like brown rice but I always try to find a recipe with brown rice that he will like and now I have found it. I’m actually using this with some mushrooms in a vegan cabbage roll recipe for Thanksgiving in a couple days. Seriously, you do not need to change anything to this recipe.

I actually used some of the ingredients for this recipe to enhance 4 cups of leftover cooked brown rice.  I sauteed the onions & garlic, added my leftover rice, then added the cumin and curry, mixed it together and added  1 cup of vegetable  base bouillon.  Then I set the stove on low and let it simmer together, stirring 2-3 times, for about 20 minutes to marry the flavors.  I served it with Salmon and green beans.  It gave the rice a pilaf texture and brought new life to the leftover rice.  It was delicious!  I will be making this again.

Have actually made this several times. I use hot curry in mine because my husband and I like spicy food. Otherwise I followed the directions as written. Love this recipe.

I hate to read reviews where people say they loved the dish but changed around a number of ingredients. Well, I will point the finger at myself as well.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe but added a tablespoon of sesame oil.  The dish is colorful and very tasty.  Next time i will add a bit of siracha for an extra kick.  Easy to make and is a very good base when you want to add your own touch.  I liked the idea of another reviewer who tried it with cranberries.  Maybe next time.
