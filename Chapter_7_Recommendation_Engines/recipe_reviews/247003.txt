Perfect as written! Very versatile. Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips (10oz bag, weighed out and removed 3 oz...used 7oz) Consider using semi sweet. Used 2T instant coffee with 1T water in cake. Could omit coffee and/or replace with orange flavor.  Baked 40 mins. Perfect.  Used 1/2c sugar and 1T instant coffee in whipped cream.  Could substitute expresso whipped cream with many things. Jellies, glazes., orange, raspberry, strawberry, hazelnut, ice cream, homemade whipped cream, fruit, etc.

This is more than good. It's also versatile ... we baked it square and cut it into squares. We used it warm with vanilla ice cream and warm chocolate sauce. Chocolate decadence. Next time: warm cherries.

It turned out fine, but really didn’t go a long way.

I must have done something horribly wrong! It was about a half inch tall and it was  like eating chocolate butter!!  I made it exactly as directed and was was terribly disappointed to not have had the same experience as others.

This was very good and very rich! I forgot to do the water bath, so my cake came out a little grainy/dry on the outside, but it was moist and gooey on the inside. I skipped the glitter/powdered sugar and opted to just top it with the whipped cream.

I took this to a holiday party filled with foodies and everyone loved it!  This cake was a big hit.  It had just the right amount of coffee flavor.  Appealing to the taste and to the eye.  Easy to make too.  Make sure to wrap the pan very well with the foil...I had some water seep in and it made the  bottom edges soggy.  Next time I will use one of those Bake-Even Strips instead.  Also, don't overdo it with the powder sugar...less is more.  I used a paint stencil I found at a hobby shop.

Followed the recipe. Turned out perfect. Everyone loved it. Served it with fresh raspberries, warm raspberry sauce and whipped cream and small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Used a sieve to dust powered sugar on cake and dusted cocoa on ice cream. Spring of mint. Yummy and beautiful! Next time I’ll take a pic.
