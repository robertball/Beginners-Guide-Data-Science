Very good. I have made a similar recipe before and this is just as good. Lots of yummy fudge sauce on the bottom. Don't make the same mistake I did... I only had an 8" pan and it overflowed in my oven!

This recipe is taste nice especially the liquid chocolate but the only thing that made me rate it 4 is because it too sweet. The sugar should be cut into 1/2 of the recipe.

Yummy! I'm a chocolate fiend so I increased the cocoa to 1/3c for the cake and the sauce. There's no such thing as too much chocolate! I also added half a cup of chopped walnuts and substituted 1/3c of whisky for part of the water for the sauce. Mmmm... chocolate and whisky....

OMG this cake was AMAZING. I did use freshly brewed coffee instead of water and added a dash of cayenne to bring out the chocolate. My children are the pickiest eaters on the planet. They cleaned their plates without complaint to get some of this cake. My husband was in heaven. I will definately make this again!

YUMMY!! On the advise of some of the posts I cut the sugar by just about half. I am glad I did as I found the dessert sweet enough with half the sugar. Very moist and lots of molten chocolate!!

The Hot Fudge Pudding Cake II recipe was okay. I cooked mine a bit too long. Next time I'll keep a closer eye on them. I made cupcakes instead of one cake. I didn't use all of the batter so I'll give these another try.

I made this for my husband for a Father's Day dessert. It was incredible and reminded us of a restaurant "lava cake". Thanks this one will be made again and again.

I added grilled banana's and fresh strawberry sauce to make it a "banana split" pudding cake. Spoon this over vanilla icecream if you want to totally blow the diet! So incredible tastes like summer all year long!!! Plus the kids get fresh fruit and less cake this way!

Good chocolate flavor.  However, it was way too sweet and had too much chocolate "sauce."  Next time I make it, and I plan to try it again, I will cut back on the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top and use less water.  It was a lot for a 9x9 pan.  I placed it on a baking sheet, because my pan was so full, I thought it might overflow.  It rose just to the edge of the pan.  I would recommend serving this with homemade whipped cream (1 c. heavy whipping cream, 1 T. sugar and 1 t. vanilla whipped on high until soft peaks form) or vanilla ice cream.

The only reason this is getting a four is because the pudding part wasn't exactly what I was expecting (perhaps not as "lava cake" fudgey in texture as I was hoping). It was still extremely delicious and I'm having a very difficult time staying away from it. I still will be making this again! Yummy!!!

My grandma used to make a cake similiar to this for my mom on her birthdays but no one in my family had the recipe for it. Anyway this cake was very yummy and it satisfied my mom's nostalgic birthday needs. It was very easy to make too. THANKS!

This had a wonderful rich chocolate flavor but somehow mine didn't turn out at all. This was really sweet too way too sweet for me and I have a huge sweetooth. It seemed like lot of water to pour over but I did as directed. When I served this up it had a cake layer on the bottom a huge liquid layer in the middle I mean really liquid not gelled like pudding or "sauce" as is usual with this type cake and then the top layer was a really thin crust. Mine was nowhere close to looking set at 45 minutes as the liquid layer was really sloshy and you could see it jiggle under the crust top layer. Easy cake to make and it's one of my favorites but for some reason I did not have success with this recipe. I sprayed the pan with nonstick spray only because it's habit and it didn't specify whether to do so or not.

first off I forgot to add the extra (what was left over white sugar)but I added the 3/4C brown sugar for the hot fudge part and it was great with just that! I think adding that extra would have been over the top crazy sweet!!! Great recipe I got worried it would run over my pan so next time I'll try 2t baking powder!

Easy to make with an excellent chocolate taste that's not overly sweet. In order to make this a dessert similar to a favorite hot fudge sundae of ours I topped with vanilla ice cream and peanuts.

According to some of the other reviews of being too sweet I actually cut back on the white sugar. It turned out too bland. I made it again and added 1 cup of sugar to the cake and the rest to the syrup. Served with ice cream it's a real treat!

it was okay not great. I used a 8x 11 dish as I did not have a 9x9. It did not spill. You must let it sit for a few minutes the pudding does thicken up nicely. The cake is quite bland. Will try a different recipe next time.

This was just okay for us. The recipe is a good one - easy to make works just as described ingredients I had on hand. But the end result was just not something to our taste. Those who like very gooey drippy fudgy desserts would probably love it! Just wasn't right for us.

Woah! Make this if you are craving gooey chocolate! And be sure to put it in a 9x9 pan! I made the mistake of an 8x8 pan and the water overflowed and made a huge mess. I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in it which it totally didn't need! Super rich!

This is a good recipe but very sweet. Not a flavorful sweet but a Sugar sweet. Does that make sense? Not the one I'm looking for. Also...DEFINETLY use a 9x9 pan as stated!! I only had an 8x8 pan and it overflowed and I'm now cleaning my oven! That is my fault...the recipe says to use a 9x9 pan.

It was ok I don't think it had enough chocolate flavor. Was kinda bland in that area. Just not the flavor I was expecting. The sauce was still too runny in my opinion even after 45 minutes baking it.

Loved it but I caution everyone to read the directions carefully. I did not and ended up dumping in all the sugar when making the cake! Oh my gosh... it was so sweet! The kids loved it though! LOL I'm sure it would be great if you followed the directions properly!

Wow I love this recipe. Super-sweet like many others suggested... just how our family likes it. This simple recipe was great for my 10 year old daughter and I to make together. We followed the recipe exactly except out of necessity we replaced the all-purpose wheat flour with Robin Hood Gluten Free Nutri Flour and about 1/2 tsp xanthan gum because we are celiacs. With these substitutions the cake turned out amazing. The pudding was a tad thick (I might try a little more boiling water next time) but rich and creamy. The cake was moist with a delicious crisp sugary edge and there was plenty of space in the 9x9 pan. I only reduced the stars from 5 to 4 because I thought it could be a bit chocolaty-er. I might add some additional cocoa next time. What I love about this recipe is the potential for slight variations... like adding boiling coffee instead of boiling water. I loved the idea of making a banana split out of it as another reviewer suggested. Also I can't wait to try it over vanilla ice cream. I can't imagine anything better.

Very good. I was worried it wouldn't thicken after it came out of the over but eventually did. I agree with some of the other reveiws that it is too sweet. Even for me and I love rich foods. I would lower the amount of white sugar in the sprinkle mixture next time. Will make again!
