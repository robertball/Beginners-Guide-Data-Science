Due to dietary restrictions I had to change some ingredients but this is great - easy and my daughter loves it so much better than the "ice cream" I used to make. I omit the whole milk and use honey instead of sugar to sweeten. Also I use coconut cream instead of coconut milk; it does not need to be strained. She is actually not a coconut fan so I flavor it with peppermint extract.
