I made this tonight for a group and they really liked this one. As far as modifications, I added a lot more curry than called for, a little more mayo than called for and what everyone commented on as being perfect not only for tase but for presentation, I added craisins which I highly recommend. This is a keeper and a winner. Thanks for sharing Susan :)

I LOVE chicken salad and this was not only different, but also delicious! It was so nice to come across a chicken salad that didn't call for grapes!! Make sure you're a curry lover before you try this. Thanks so much Susan!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I love the addition of the eggs, it made it very different. I added more mayo (until it was creamy) and some golden raisins. I will defintely be making this again.
P.S. I recently made this again and put the salad in tiny phyllo cups and served as an appetizer. Went over very, very well.

Oooh, this is good!  Since I had no dill pickle relish, I added chutney, and since I had no green onions, I chopped up regular onion instead.  I cut the chicken into one inch pieces, which was really too big, I think.  Smaller pieces of chicken can take in the flavor of the salad more readily.

My husband and I love this. I always make a big batch when we go camping and we eat it everyday for lunch. I add more curry because we like that flavor. This is so yummy!

This turned out very yummy! I was looking for a chicken salad recipe that incorporated curry without a "sweet" ingredient, such as grapes, raisins, etc. I left out the celery, as the fiance hates it, and substitued chopped walnuts for the crunch factor. Oh well, he didn't like it anyway. He loves Indian food, but he thought the curry flavor in a chicken salad was really odd. His loss, more for me! Also added a pinch of salt, pepper, a bit of mustard and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper for a little heat. Perfect in pita pockets.

Used regular onion since that's what I had, and I don't keep pickle relish on hand so just cut up some pickles into tiny pieces.  I like curry in small amounts and this was subtle rather than overwhelming.  I would have used for sandwiches but there were nowhere near enough mayo to keep this together for bread.  So I ate just as a salad, and it was pretty good (but not great).  I think it would work well in pita and I'd like to try that.  I also agree that smaller pieces of chicken work better.

good - use less onion (very strong).  Added raisens, apple, lemon juice, cranberries.  Extra mayo to reduce the strength of the onion.

Like another reviewer, I had to add more curry, more mayo, and also a little salt.  It still seems to be missing something, though.

Very yummy.  Makes quite a bit.  I had it on white bread and it was delicious.  I love the crunch combined with the curry.

I gave this a 5 because of the dressing and because it can be customized and still be delicious.   I made it to spread on Sesame Rice crackers so I left out the onions and celery (I didn't have any on hand anyway) and added 1/4 tsp. of onion powder and a pinch of celery seed to the dressing.  I had less than two cups of chicken so I only added one hardboiled egg which was plenty.  When I make it for a salad, I will include the celery and green onion but probably only 1 or two eggs.  Needless to say, I saved this one in my Recipe Box.

This is a tasty chicken salad.  I did, however, use 1/3 cup of real mayo, and 2 table spoons of sour cream.  In this way I found it suitable as a stand alone or for sandwiches / wraps.  In the future I will omit the relish.

I added 3/4 of a diced bosh pear, and 1/2 a cup of toasted almonds. I also used a little less relish, more mayo and no onion. YUM.

It is pretty good.  My husband loves it and I think it is just pretty good.  I didn't add the pickle relish because we don't have any, but I bet that I would enjoy that flavor (I know my husband would hate it that way though and that's probably why I don't keep relish on hand!) I like the curry heat; I had to salt it to bring out that flavor a bit more.  We thought it might be really good with some diced green pepper in it.

I love chicken curry salad but I didn't like this at all. I only took 1 bite and tossed the rest. I didn't like the pickle at all nor the crunch of the celery or the texture of the egg in this. Sorry, this one just didn't appeal to my taste buds. I did have fun making and trying a new recipe.

I added a bit more curry and mayo, also some garlic salt. I cooked the chicken with garlic salt and black pepper.

This was very tasty all by itself. However, the flavor is rather delicate, and gets lost on whole wheat bread. I tried it with just lettuce wrapped around it, and it was still overpowered.

This might work with pita bread, but I think that white bread (which we don't eat) is the only thing that would really work well with this.

I'll make it again and just eat it as is.

Even without the eggs (cause I was out of them), this was a great chicken salad.  Can't wait to make again with eggs added.  Thanks for the recipe.

Quite tasty way to use up leftover chicken.  Easy ingredients.  Whole family of adults enjoyed it.  Put in just a touch of hot sauce to add a bit of zing.  Flavor develops over time.  Will do again.

This is a great recipe but I always have to add much more mayo to get it to hold together.  I like to eat this made as a sandwich, so maybe that's why I have to use more!!  I really like curry so I add more of that, too!

The flavors just didn't work for us. It was nice to find a recipe that didn't have grapes and nuts but I'll have to try other seasonings for it to suit us.

This was a nice change from regular meat and cheese sandwiches. I made this for my husband's lunch, and though he rarely requests certain foods, he asked me to make this one again. He is not a fan of green onions so I left those out, but I think they would be a good addition. I also added some green grapes as he loves them in his tuna salad; I liked the slight sweetness they brought to it. Perhaps we like our salads bit more wet, but I added a little more mayo and more curry then called for. My husband claims he is not a fan of celery or relish, but he didn't complain about this once! It looks like this will become a staple for us!

A different but tasty chicken salad.  Like many others, I also added more curry and much more mayo.  I used less celery - only 1 stalk.  Should have done two.  I think four would have been overkill.  We enjoyed this - thank you!

So good.  Omitted the green onions, but did add more chicken to the mix, and also included chopped pecans, Craisins, and a few pinches of salt.  To bulk up the mayo, added a couple scoops of plain yogurt as well.  No measurements, just added to taste.  Ate it as a salad with no greens or bread.  It was amazing!

Just curry powder is not enough of flavor/aroma. To build up the flavor, I added more ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric and ground white pepper. Added more celery the second time I made this. To assemble it, lay a leaf of iceberg lettuce on a slice of toasted bread and scoop a generous amount of this yummy curry chicken salad on top to form a open-faced sandwich.

For all the work to put this together, it was just okay.  I ended up throwing most of it out because after eating it for lunch once, I just didn't have any interest in eating it again.  Missing something.
