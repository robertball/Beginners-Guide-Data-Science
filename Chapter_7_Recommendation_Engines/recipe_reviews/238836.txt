These were great with the few changes I made. First I used all honey instead of dividing between honey and agave syrup. I added 6 Tablespoons of Brown Rice flour to give the cookie some body, so they didn't spread out.  They came out great!

12.8.15  These are good, REALLY good, and you can eat them guilt free! Win-win in my opinion.  ckkott, thanks for sharing.****UPDATE 12.9.15****  Yesterday I would have described the texture of these cookies as "very soft."  Today, after sitting in a container overnight, I would describe them as "limp," but the flavor is still there.

These cookies are amazingly simple to make and hella tasty. I added 2 tbsp of ground almonds to combat the softness and now they're great.
Even if you don't add the almonds they are kind of like a cookie brownie hybrid and so low in calories!

The flavor is amazing, but the cookies are limp.  I did put them in a toaster oven on 350 degrees for 30 seconds.  After cooling, they had a little crunch to them, which I liked.

The batter was delicious! But I noticed the batter seemed too silky. The final cooked product was so so. The texture of the baked cookie is too soft. I even tried cooking it longer but it didn't help.
