The only reason this recipe doesn't get 5 stars is because of the ketchup topping.  I found that 2 tablespoons of brown sugar made it WAY too sweet.  I am going to reduce it to only 1 tablespoon next time.  Otherwise, it was very moist, flavorful, and delicious!

This was great, but I made some minor changes.  First, instead of minced onion, I used a whole packet of onion soup mix, as we love that in ground beef.  Then, for the topping, I skipped the brown sugar and added a couple drops of liquid smoke.  My husband loved the topping this way and wanted more, so next time I will double the batch.  Very juicy, tender meatloaf, but the topping really makes it.  Also very easy, so will make again.

I am so glad I found this recipe! The hours I work make it difficult to make a meatloaf for dinner,  and I was looking for a slow cooker recipe. This worked out so moist and delicious, I problably won't bake anymore. After reading reviews, I was concerned about it being too greasy, so I used a very lean ground beef (93%lean/7%fat)and it was moist but not greasy. The topping was sweet & delicious, but... we prefer just plain ketchup on meatloaf, so next time I will omit part or all of the brown sugar. The flavor could use a few more spices, I thought, esp. salt. I don't understand why one review said omit salt? We are a family that uses very little salt and tend to think canned food, etc. is salty. Maybe it was the bread crumb seasoning differences. ? I will add some more salt and some black pepper at least next time, but will make again and again in the slow cooker timed just like this TERRIFIC RECIPE states. Thank you, Suzanne!

I really liked this recipe, and so did my husband. I baked it at 350 degrees for one hour and it turned out really moist and full of flavor!

This was the first meat loaf I've ever made, and my husband and I absolutely loved it!  I used Stove Top dressing mix for the seasoned bread crumbs and baked it at 325 for 90 minutes instead, and I also decreased the mustard by 1/2 and omitted the sugar.  Best meat loaf I've ever had!  Thanks!

Mmmm delicious!! Time constraints made oven roasting feasible for me, and I also  mixed 1/3 ground pork with the beef, added minced fresh onions, 2 tsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 2 tsp garlic seasoning, an extra dash of Thyme (The Secret Ingredient!!). Without commercial breadcrumbs I toasted some leftover slices of rye bread in the pre-heating oven and crushed them to make my own bread crumbs.  But Wow!! What a Crowd Pleaser!!  Moist and mmmm good!! 
I think it would be too greasy in the crockpot, even without the ground pork. But thanks for a great recipe!!

Wow, this made me toss my grandmother's meatloaf recipe! This was by far the easiest, moistest, and most flavorful meatloaf I have ever had.  I used 2lbs of ground beef and 1/2 cup ketchup and then everything else as written.  We have a new family favorite!

I used cornbread stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs because thats what I had and transferred from the crockpot to the oven when it came time for the ketchup mixture. This is the best meatloaf I've ever had.

Excellent meatloaf!  Really easy, and extremely moist.  I ended up making extra sauce just like lots of other reviewers, so you might want to make a double batch to start.  Great for leftover meatloaf sandwiches!

I have been trying to find a good meatloaf recipe and think this one is the best I have tried so far. I only had one egg to use but it still came out very tasty and moist. I did just cook it in the oven so next time I will try slow cooking it.

I didn't even realize this was a slow cooker recipe,  it is so similar to one I make, with a few tweaks.  I replace 1/2 lb ground beef with sage sausage (eliminate the ground sage).  Like some other reviewers, I used fresh onion, but also added some minced garlic, and fine chopped red pepper.  I used Italian bread crumbs. I bake in 350 oven for 1 1/4 hrs (time is approx.). Now, this is the biggest change.  I don't use the topping listed at all.  Instead, I take 1 can golden mushroom soup (we like it better than regular in this), put it in a 2 cup measuring cup and add enough water to make 2 cups and mix.  About 1/2 hr before meatloaf is ready  I pour this over it.  Instant gravy.  The juices from the meatloaf mix with it and it's so delicious.  Of course, we have to have mashed potatoes to serve the gravy over.

To the person who gave this recipe a one star and didn't even make it, just because you don't like the way a recipe looks you don't downgrade the recipe, you just don't make it!
Personal I liked this and thought it was very good!

Best meatloaf I've ever had.  I couldn't find my bread pans so I put it in an 8x8 nonstick pan.  I cooked this in the oven at 350 for about 90 minutes to make sure is wasn't pink.  Next time I'll double the sauce, it just wasn't quite enough.  Great recipe!

Most slow cooker meatloaf recipes have you making foil balls or put foil strips around the loaf for lifting purposes.  Because that seemed a hassle, I'd never made meatloaf in my crockpot before.  This was wonderful!!  I used extremely lean beef and wonder if that was why I had so very little grease in the bottom but this meatloaf was moist and delicious!  I put it on high at 6am and it was perfect when we came home from church at noon.  As a time saver, I had premade the sauce before we left.  I put the meatloaf on the serving platter, covered it with the sauce, and popped it under the broiler while I put the rest of the meal on the table.  Remember things don't brown so well in the crockpot.  Don't be alarmed at the anemic looking meatloaf.  It is perfect with the sauce.  I surrounded the meatloaf with cubes of potatoes and carrots which made this a pretty perfect crockpot meal.

I never would have thought that meatloaf in a slow cooker would work, but this is an awesome dish. It comes out so moist!I really don't understand some of these reviewers not using the slow cooker. That's what sets it apart from all other recipes! I didn't have sage when I made it, but I don't think it needed it. I also used a Lipton onion mix and I think it really added some flavor to it. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the topping. I'm not into sweet stuff with my meats so I didn't add the brown sugar. Instead, my husband made his own little thing by adding Chipotle flavored Tabasco. It gave it a smokey taste and I think it was perfect with the meatloaf. The leftovers are even better and makes a great sandwich for lunch. I made this a couple weeks ago and my husband said it's one of the best things he's ever had so I'm making it again today! Thanks Suzanne for this recipe!

I have been making this same recipe for 37 years. It is absolutely my favorite.  So moist.  I actually double the recipe for the brown sugar, ketchup topping and put it on before I bake it. Comes out perfect every time.

I wasn't sure how good this would be since it seemed very moist when I put it in the crock. But, it was very good! I could have used a leaner ground beef, but all I had was 80% (which is what I normally use for hamburgers). That being said, it was still really good. Next time I make it I'll use a lean ground beef to cut down on the fat. ;)

DELICIOUS, except used non-fat chicken broth instead of milk and ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I used one egg not two and added crushed red pepper.  Still, this was excellent for ANY meatloaf lover...as original recipe or switched up a bit!  Very user friendly!!!

A little too much sugar for me so gonna try with half next time. Didn't made this recipe in crock pot this time but will try it next time. When I have made other meatloaf recipe in crock pot I have made foil strips to go each way and placed the meat loaf on them to get it out easily. I recently tried putting foil balls on bottom of crock pot so food don't cook in the grease and it worked great. Gonna try it with the foil strips to alleviate some of the grease

I loved this concept and will probably use this method from now one to cook my meatloaf!  It turned out very moist, but not to the point of falling completely apart.  I didn't care for the addition of sage and that would probably be the only thing i'd change in the future.

Very good and very easy since it was cooked in the crockpot.  I crumbled alum foil in the crock and let the meatloaf cook on top of it so it wasn't sitting in the drippings.  This held up very well and made great sandwiches w/ the leftovers.

I recently made this during a heat wave.  We loved it so much.  I made this according to the recipe except I added pork ( because i had to use it before it went bad).  I usually use tomato sauce as a topping but this is much better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good.  I misunderstood the recipe and this a round meatloaf that was the size of the crock which made thin.  Next time I will make a thicker round loaf set in the middle of the crock.  It was very very moist but yet held together.  I would definately make this one again.

This recipe for sure melts in your mouth. Has just enough flavor with a perfect blend, I did add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to my meat mixture. I also did my own sauce blend because i no that its not sweet. I use the same ingredients just a different mixture and it turns out great. Its 1/3 c. of ketchup, 2 T. of brown sugar, 2 T. of prepared mustard ( the condiment...lol) and 1/2 t. of worcestershire sauce. It must cook over the meatloaf for the time required or you can cook it on the stove and pour over your meatloaf to save time. If you dont use the crockpot method and cook in oven pour your sauce over the raw meat mixture and cook at 350 for a hour. Very good recipe.

you can also add ketchup and mustard in the meat and use a little less milk . Paula Dean uses this recipe and that's where I got it. Also the sauce you pour on top I use for pork roasts and some other meats. It great!!!!

I'm giving it 5 stars for the  method!  I will never cook meatloaf in the oven again.  This method is so easy, fits into my schedule better, doesn't heat up my house and turns out super moist.  I love it!  I love spices so I added practically every spice in my cabinet until it smelled heavenly (1 T rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp pepper,  1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp paprika & 1/2 tsp cumin).  I also added extra seasonings to  make up for the unseasoned bread crumbs I had on hand (1/2 tsp ground oregano, 1 1/2 T basil & 2 T parsley).  For the meat I used 1/2 lb of ground Italian Pork Sausage and 1 1/2 lbs of ground sirloin.  I seasoned my ketchup sauce so much that it tasted like BBQ sauce which actually worked well.      Next time I might try stuffing the meatloaf with thawed/squeezed spinach and grated Parmesan cheese.  And then use spaghetti sauce instead of a ketchup variation on the top.

I've been using this recipe for a while and have made it both in the slow cooker and the oven - it's ALWAYS good.  When I'm in a hurry, I just use a packet of Lipton's Roasted Garlic and Onion soup mix instead of the separate salt, seasonings and onions.  Very yummy!

The BEST meat loaf that we have ever had!  I have made it as it is  here, and also changed  from bread crumbs to crushed seasoned croutons that I needed to use up, and also used fresh chopped onion.  I always double the sauce....we love it! What a great recipe!

My boyfriend said he usually doesnt like meat loaf because it is dry but said this was super moist and the best he had ever had! He raved about it all night long, and I have to agree it turned out very tasty and moist and easy in the slow cooker!

This recipe as written is 5 stars (if you double or triple the sauce...it's THAT good).  I cooked this meatloaf recipe the other day with a few alterations. It was fantastic and really simple to do. I made a couple changes but one was a mistake. I forgot to put breadcrumbs in the meatloaf. It was still very good and I won't freak out if I forget next time. I did add 1/3 cup of diced onions in place of the minced onions but only bc I didn't have any minced onions on hand. It was still great. Make sure you remember to drain the crock pot to get all of the grease/fat out of it before you add the sauce. It will be too runny and greasy if you don't. I just remove the meatloaf, stick it on a wire rack, drain the pot, placed the loaf back in and pour the sauce all over the top and sides of the loaf. Despite my mistakes/alterations, the meatloaf was still five star.  MAKE EXTRA SAUCE!!!!

This was easy and tasted great, very moist, not your typical dry meat loaf...subbed tarragon for the sage and did not add sugar to the glaze.

I used some of my own seasonings for the sauce and inside the meat ( we like things a little spicy )but  am giving this 5 stars because it was the easiest and moistest meatloaf my husband and I have ever had. Unfortunately, we couldn't stop at just one helping :)

We used ground turkey and a few other changes like stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and onion soup mix instead of minced onions.  Makes a big difference, try it!  Definately not dull with flavor when you make these changes.

This was absolutely delicious!  I took some suggestions from the reviews, such as using onion soup mix instead of onions, adding a couple cloves of fresh garlic, cutting down on the brown sugar on the topping and doubling the topping and putting it on right when you start cooking the meatloaf.  I also put the meat on rolled up tin foil to keep it out of the grease and put it under the broiler for the last 15 minutes (with one more batch of the ketchup topping because it was so good).  I have pretty picky eaters in my family and everyone loved it!

This was good but I thought it wasn't as moist as everyone said it was.  I used your regular ground beef (not super lean).  I had a feeling it wasn't as "moist" as the recipe indicated it would be so I was a little worried it would be a little dry... I was right but thought maybe the greese from the beef would help moisten it during the cooking process... I did 5 hours on low... maybe next time I should only do 3.5 or 4 and check it!  I'll re-rate next time I try it!  It was definately worth making it b/c the kids enjoyed it!  I thought the topping was too sweet as well and I LOVE sweet stuff!!!  I am glad I made the sauce and served it seperately!!

My husband and I made this yesterday. We did substitute a package of dry onion soup mix for the sage and minced onion. We left it in the crockpot to cook all day (9 hrs). It was FANTASTIC! I usually don't like meat loaf but this one had such a great taste.

Everyone in the family loved this meatloaf.  I didn't have any rubbed sage so I omitted that.  I used 2 lbs ground beef and I also added a little extra Worcestershire sauce to the topping.  Baked at 375 for 1 hour.  I'll try the crockpot next time.

I've never been much of a meat loaf fan, so when someone in the family requests it, I always try a different recipe, looking for that perfect one I'll actually enjoy myself.  I think I've finally found it. I had Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, so I left out the sage, added a little fresh ground pepper, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  It was nice and moist and flavorful, but simple and classic. I had some organic beef fresh ground at the little corner market, and I know that made it even better, too.

I like the tenderness of the meatloaf compared to the oven baked method.  It was a bit too soft for my husband, so I just left it in longer the next time, and it turned out a little firmer, just perfect!  What a time saver!

Stupid me I didn't realize this was a slow cooker recipe until I got home from work and actually read the directions.  I had to bake it in the oven instead and I served the sauce on the side.  It was delicious.  I look forward to making this again the right way--in the slow cooker.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Sooo good! The only thing I changed was to add a little Worcestershire Sauce to the meat as well. I also put the sauce on for the entire cooking period and doubled the sauce. Definitely double the sauce! I think next time I may triple it. My boyfriend and i loved it! Thanks for sharing!

absolutely delicious! and it really does melt in your mouth. i only made a few slight changes: as a result of reading others reviews, i used half of the brown sugar in the sauce. i also used half of a large onion in place of the dried minced onion, and garlic powder instead of the sage (only because i didn't have any on hand). i've been making it this way ever since, and it's perfect every time...especially served with buttery mashed potatoes and green beans!

This was really good! I would suggest using a lean cut of beef. I used 80/20 and it was pretty greasy. Also decreased the amount of brown sugar to 1 Tbsp. I didn't have time to use the slow cooker, so I baked at 350 for 1 hour. It was a little pink in the center still, so I would increase the baking time a little next time.

Really easy to cook in slow cooker, liked the tangy sauce on top, but it was a bit sweet. Doubled the sauce per other remarks. Boyfriend and his son both wolfed it down- but it was a little "flimy" on top (even though I used 93/7% fat beef). Still, I'd make it again with my long work schedule. Thanks!

great recipe.  i did as suggested and used onion soup mix instead of minced onions, and for the glaze i used a small can of ocean spray jellied cranberry sauce mixed together with 4 oz. of sweet baby ray barbeque sauce.  Try it, you'll like it.

This was unbelievably good considering how easy it was to put together!  And the leftovers make super sandwiches.  I recommend this to any busy mom - you can never have enough good crockpot recipes!  Thank you, Suzanne!

* I had my house on the market and heard that a woman was bringing her husband to see it - she was in love with the house and wanted him to love it too.  I put this meatloaf in the crockpot and had it cooking when the man came to walk thru.  He must have liked the way my house smelled ---the closing was last week!  LOL

Fantastic!  Hands down the BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever made.  My husband went back for seconds and then a third helping.  Flavorful, moist, and perfect in the slow cooker.  You won't be disappointed.

This meatloaf was fantastic! I am not a good cook at all but this made my husband think I have potential. :) He told me it was the first meatloaf he didn't have to use ketchup on to make it taste better. The only changes I made was I left out the mustard and next time will use a little less brown sugar. Anyway THANKS for a GREAT recipe!

My Family loves this recipe!  My trick for easy removal from the slow cooker is to line it with parchment paper before cooking.  Easy to remove and easier clean up.

I use this recipe all the time but I make it into mini loafs which gives me more topping and we find it less dry.

When my oven broke down, I didn't think we could have meatloaf anymore, but this recipe is great!  I add a couple of bacon strips on top--very flavorful  and ready when I come home from work!

Been married almost 39 years and finally found a meatloaf recipe my husband loves! He requested this for Easter and everyone loved it! My son thought the sauce was awesome! I doubled the sauce recipe but followed the advise to cut the brown sugar in half. Used 6 c. beef broth instead of water and bouillon. Great recipe!

Very good.  I did half beef/half pork and the rest I followed the recipe exactly.  I was nervous to make it in the crock pot but it turned out wonderful.

Wow - this is probably the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. I did use a package of onion soup mix, as one reviewer suggested. Other than that, just followed the recipe.

My family and I thought this was pretty tasty. We did make a few changes:

1. I didnt have any dry minced onion but I did have a packet of onion soup mix so I used half a packet.

2. substitued ground turkey for the beef. 

3. I only have spicy mustard and I'm happy I did, it gave it a sweet and spicy twist that most dont expect in meatloaf.

This was the best meatloaf I've even eaten.  The only change I made was to omit the sage as I didn't have any on hand.  It was moist and texture was very good.  For the bread crumbs I used Stove Top low sodium.  Excellent recipe.

This is good meatloaf. I baked mine in the oven for about 1hr 20 mins in a glass loaf pan. I like things that have alot of strong flavor, so I will spice it up next time but as regular meatloaf this is great. You should make double the topping. I made this with the smothered greenbean recipe on here.

I tried another meatloaf on this website - Turkey and Quinoa - and we actually preferred it to this one, although both are very good.  This one was a bit drier than the other one.  I did cut back on the brown sugar as others suggested and it was sweet enough with half the amount.
June 6/12 - Made again tonight.  Didn't use any topping, just drizzled ketchup on top before putting the lid on the slow cooker.  Added a couple of drops of liquid smoke to the top as well.  Also, I laid the meat loaf on top of 2 carrots to drain away the fat.  Liked it better this time.

This is a delicious rendition of the classic meatloaf. It's quick to prepare at the front end. The glaze is tasty and not overbearing with the ketchup once the other 3 items are blended. In fact I thickened the glaze on the stove and offered more of it to family and guests.

I actually baked mine in the oven because I didn't have enough time for the crockpot and it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a casserole dish.  Then, I separated them into 4 smaller loaves and baked it at 375 for an hour.  It turned out delicious!  My family asks me to make it over and over.

I have tried many different meat loaf recipes only to be disappointed. So far this is my families favorite version, minus the ketchup mixture over the top (it was too sweet for our taste).

WARNING!!!  Be sure to MAKE EXTRA, there was LITERALLY a fight in my house tonight over the last peice.  And make some extra sauce for dipping, its really good.  I am not a big fan of meatloaf but I thought I would try it because I was looking for something i could throw in the crock pot and I had some extra ground beef so I gave it a try.  It was amazing, everyone loved it.  It was really moist and it really does almost melt in your mouth.  I did change one thing though, I substituted some dale's for the w. sause because I didnt have any.

I have been making this exact recipe for a lot of years now and wouldn't even think of making any other meatloaf.  We love it. It is always so moist. I did make one change though. I put the catchup,brown sugar mixture on when I put the meatloaf in the slow cooker and it comes out fine.

Never thought I would find a recipe for meatloaf that I would like as much as mine.  This was a great recipe!  The only thing that I did differently was add some bell pepper and baked it in the oven because I didn't want to wait to try it.  Next time I will try the slow cooker.  Thanks for giving me an alternate to use occasionally.

I've never cooked meatloaf in a crock pot and it worked out great. I used dry onion soup mix, left out salt, added garlic powder and a torn soft roll that was on hand rather than bread crumbs. It was done maybe an hour sooner than I expected; however I kept an eye on it through the glass lid. My family likes ketchup with theirs so they liked the addition on the top. It came out plenty moist and held together well. Will make this recipe again - love not using the oven.

This meatloaf was ridiculously good! I prepared everything early in the morning and set my slow cooker to cook for the day. When we all finally got home the delicious smells coming from the slow cooker reminded us all how hard we worked today! I had also taken a frozen loaf of dough("Grandma VanDoren's White Bread" a recipe from this site) out to thaw and rise before we left for the day. It rose beautifully and I popped it in the oven. 30 mins later we had the best meatloaf sandwiches we've ever had! Thanks!

Very good. Used 1 pkg. of Lipton Beefy Onion dry soup mix in place of the onions and other seasonings specified in the meat loaf mixture.  Added a touch of liquid smoke to the topping ingredients.  Used 93% lean ground beef, had no problems with greasiness.  Will make again!

Very Good.  As others did, lean meat and cut down on the brown sugar in the sauce - Excellent flavor and so easy in the crock pot.

Total 5 start meatloaf!  The sauce is delish and I doubled it for dipping.  I also tried it with turkey and it was moist still, even though ground turkey tends to be dry.  YUM!

This is probably the best meatloaf I have ever made.   I did increase the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup, added ground black and green peppercorns, chives, shallots and garlic.  I'm allergic to sage so I replaced it with savory.  I also decreased the brown sugar to 1T and used tomato paste instead of ketchup.  My dad who's a really picky eater loved it.

Wonderful meat loaf! I have a large family so I doubled the recipe. I put 2lbs of 93% beef and 1lb of Jimmy Dean sage sausage. I did not put more sage spice in. It was great. My kids loved it!

I loved the ketchup topping, but my mom didn't (she thought it was too sweet). But it was very moist! I used different spices in the meat itself so my rating is based on moistness and the topping. Which in my mind are A++

Just tried this.  Flavors are just right, wouldn't change a thing.  We particularly liked the sauce, but I cut that part in half as half was enough for us.  It was still very moist. Update 2/14: Have tried all similar top-rated recipes, and this one is still my favorite. Why continue to look?

This was my 1st time ever making meat loaf, and my 2nd at every trying it. It was great. My PICKY boyfriend, who doesnt eat anything ate ALL of it other than my skimpy helping. :) The only change I made was add a packet of dry onion mix packet instead of the sage and onion.

I grew up on an old dried-out variation of meatloaf and disliked it so much that I haven't cooked a single meatloaf in my adult life.  That was until I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm so impressed that I *will* be making this moist meatloaf again.  It was so tender that it broke up a bit as I lifted it out of the crock pot.  Next time I'll line the pot with strips of foil that hang over the edges to make it easier to pull the loaf out.  I used raw onions as I didn't have any dehydrated and think that I'll add some chopped mushrooms next time (per Hubby's suggestion).

Made as written except cooked in oven instead of crock pot.  The taste was just OK...nothing special.  Will continue to look for another meat loaf recipe.

This recipe is great and so easy!  Even my very fussy toddler loves it.  I have used both ground beef and ground turkey and either works just fine, though my preference is for the turkey.

It was only ok. I used a mix of lean ground chuck and ground turkey. The flavor was a little bland. I made extra sauce to go on top and that helped some. Not my favorite recipe. Probably wont make again since my hubby said it was a ** recipe.

I used Venison and only 1/4 cup bread crumbs to cut calories.  I did add extra seasonings as recommended by others.  The topping didn't really do anything for it.  I might make it again because it was so easy but I will skip the topping.

I will never cook meatloaf in the oven! This was soooo good. I want to give it 10 stars! My husband LOVED it. He even wanted to keep the leftovers and he hates leftovers. I cooked it for 6 hours, but next time I will add an extra half hour or full hour. I also think the topping is too sweet. I only added 1 tablespoon of sugar and it was still too much. Next time I will only add a teaspoon of sugar.

What an excellent recipe. I decided to make this today without checking our ketchup situation. I didn't have enough so I had to improvise. For the meatloaf I went by the recipe except that I reduced milk to 1/2 c and salt to 1/2 t. Omitted sage, don't have it. I added 1/4 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. italian seasoning, and 1/4 t. turmeric (I add it to everything lol). I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground chicken. For the sauce I combined 1 6-oz can tomato paste, 3 T white vinegar, 5 T brown sugar, 1 t. garlic powder, 1 t. dried onion, 1/8 t. ginger, 1/8 t. cinnamon, 1/8 t. cloves, 1 t. salt, 1 t. ground mustard, 1/2 t. turmeric, 1 1/2 t. Worcestershire and 1 1/2 cups water. Topped meatloaf for the last hour of cooking. Plenty of sauce to top the Practically Perfect Basmati Rice. Awesome. Thank you Suzanne, this one's a keeper!

Sooo juicy! My husband can not stand meat loaf, this changed his mind extremely. He even took seconds and thirds, made it with green salad and german potato salad. Also maks a great sandwich with baby greens and slightly melted cheese on multigrain bread. Occassionally I crave a meatloaf and had to wait for a restaurant serving it, now I can make it at home and the whole family will eat it. Hubby especially loved the topping sauce! Thanks so much for this.

After many years of making countless meatloaves in the oven, I was skeptical about a meatloaf coming out correctly in a slow cooker.  This recipe proved to me that it could be done, and deliciously, too!  A few minor modifications--I beat the eggs and milk together with a fork first, then mixed in 2 pounds of ground beef, a cup of stovetop-type stuffing mix, an envelope of dry onion soup mix, the salt and the sage.  After it had cooked for 6 hours, I removed the meatloaf to a plate, drained off the accumulated fat from the slow cooker, returned the meatloaf to the slow cooker, and then topped it with the ketchup mixture.  I let it cook 20 more minutes, then put it back out on the plate and let it sit for 10 minutes.  It was very easy to slice and serve, and absolutely yummy!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tried.  I will never do meatloaf in the oven again.  This is it !!!!  I threw all my other meatloaf recipes out.  Must try to be believed.  I'd give more stars, but only 5 allowed.

we both enjoyed this meat loaf.  Loved the ketchup topping.  All the flavors ......yum.  This was great for leftover meatloaf sandwiches.  Mixed up some more of the ketchup to use on the sandwiches.

I dont have a lot of cooking experience and this meatloaf was easy to make, very good, it does literally melt in your mouth.  My girlfriend's 4 yr old even liked it and anyone with kids knows how picky 4 yr olds are.  I will definately be making this again.

I thought I rated this but couldnt find my review! This is the best ever! So moist and flavorful. I used garlic salt for the salt to give it extra flavor and I think I followed everything else exactly as written but didn't add as much sugar to the ketchup mixture. And it was sweet and very yummy that way. Thanks for a great recipe, I posted a pic as well.

We LOVED this meatloaf!! I don't usually like a sauce on my meatloaf, but this one was perfect (just the right amount of sweetness). We will definately have this one again!

Very good! I followed almost exactly, except had 2.3 lb package of 80-20, and used it all. Drained some fat after cooking. Used a fresh onion (no other on hand.) Hadn't made a round loaf before, so made a hole in the center, like in an angel food cake, for even heating and cooking. Cut servings like cake slices. Everything worked out just fine, and is surely an easy way to get ahead and have supper waiting. Oh yeah, almost forgot. I used only one tbsp of brown sugar. It's an excellent, mild sauce--leaves some flavor for the meatloaf, itself.

I don't have to load it with ketchup anymore!! well... i still gotta have a little because it just wouldn't be right if I didn't.. but it certainly doesnt need it... thanks for the great recipe.. I love easy carefree meals!!!

This was excellent!  I topped mine with bottled bbq sauce and shredded up a carrot into the meat.  Great way to get veggies into kids, as they can hardly tell they're there.  Taste, texture, whole mouth feeling was 5 stars!

I am not a fan of meatloaf. So, a five-star rating means this recipe rocks. It is also good for meatballs and hamburgers. Placed a layer of rough cut onions below meatloaf and added 30 ml water to create a steam reflux and maintain moistness. Top coating was doubled and brushed on immediately. Substituted 4 ml molasses for sugar. Added 5 gm of tarragon and halved salt in meatloaf. Reached 72C after three hours on high. Removed finished product by scooping with two wide spatulas. Served with corn on cob and the steamed onions used to elevate meatloaf.

Great recipe, makes a moist tender meatloaf.  The only change i made was to use finely minced fresh onion rather than dried onion.  Will make this again.  The glaze is delicious.

okay, WOW. now let me say this recipe is 5 stars not just bc ofthe taste, but bc of how perfectly cooked it is. this was my first time making a loaf in a slow cooker and now i see it is the only way to go! it comes out perfect and moist without any effort. i dunno about you, but when i make a loaf ill check to see if its done. notice it needs a little time, come back in 5-10 minutes, and now its a lil overcooked :( i like the taste too (im always a fan ofthe ketchup/br sugar topping)

This is almost the same as the meat loaf that I already make! I loved using my crock pot instead of the oven. Saves loads of time at the end of a busy day!

This was the best meatloaf we've ever had and the easiest to prepare.  I took a reviewers suggestion and used a package of onion soup mix instead of the minced onion and sage and it was delicious.  We loved the ketchup topping also.  In fact next time I'm making extra for dipping.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was the first time I ever made meatloaf.  I used lean ground beef and there was a lot of grease floating once it was finished cooking.   Wasn't too impressed and didn't really care for the taste. DH thought it was ok.

This was delicious! I'm a total beginner at cooking, just trying to learn at this point and I managed to make this meatloaf for 4 people and they all loved it! I also replaced the bread crumbs with rolled oats because I'm trying to cut wheat out of my diet and none of the others were the wiser. Only issue I had was I couldn't really form it into a ball, but the taste was great! Followed another posters advice to only use one tablespoon of brown sugar for the topping and it was delish!

Meat loaf was great, topping not so much.  We prefer spicey to sweet.  Try plain or seasoned tomato sauce and a can of Ro-Tel (tomatoes & green chilies).  Also a little garlic in the meat loaf is a personal preference.

I've never made meatloaf myself before and this was so good! All plates were clean and it was a really simple recipe. The prep time was minimal. I baked mine for an hour @ 350. I should add that I used 1 lb. of beef instead of 1 &1/2.

Im not a meat loaf type of gal but my husband loves it. I wanted to try this recipe because it was a crock pot recipe and i have to admit this was very good. I did double the sauce including the sugar and thought it was very sweet, but delicious. Its a keeper.

This is THE BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever made/found. My son and husband both loved it. I thought it was delicious and I'm not a meatloaf fan. I used chopped onion instead of minced and added a little green pepper and mushrooms...Wonderful!

When I tried this recipe as written, it was bland and mealy. When I tried to slice it, it just fell apart - which I suppose is true to the title, because it was moist. It was also greasy. I rated it three stars, though, rather than just one, because I took away a great idea - now I add 1/2 c. milk per pound of beef to my regular meatloaf recipe, and then just bake it in the oven as usual. Turns out great, moist and delicious every time.

I give this four stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I ended up putting this in the oven at 330 for 90 minutes. I doubled the sauce because we love sauce in this house; made my own bread crumbs from old bread, and omitted the sage since I am out. This was a big hit served w/grilled potatoes and salad.

This meatloaf came out very moist.   I didn't have ground mustard so I used prepared mustard in the topping.  I baked in a loaf pan at 350 for one hour and 15 minutes (meat thermometer reading 160). Even though I used low-fat ground beef, I moved the meatloaf to a plate after cooking to drain off excess fat. Served with mashed potatoes.  Will make this again.

Good meatloaf, good as leftovers.  I enjoyed the sauce just as it was written in the recipe.

I baked it but it's definitely a melt-in-your mouth. It tasted raw even though I baked it for over an hour and a half. And the seasoning made it taste funny. Probably won't make it again.

This is very good.  I have made this several times now.  I normally add 1/2 pkg of lipton onion soup and as one other suggested, herb stuffing mix.  Sometimes I fry up some bacon and put bacon pieces across the top.   Usually gets done more quickly then stated.  I drain the grease and transfer to a cake pan which fits perfectly from the crock pot.  I then add the topping and bake on 350 for 25 minutes or so.   ( a dash or 2 of hot sauce to the topping adds a nice zing)  Thanks for the recipe.  My husband loves it and it slices great for sandwiches the next day.

Finally, a meat loaf recipe. Halved this recipe to cook for two. Also used onion soup mix and omitted salt, although I sprinkled some S&P on towards the end. Left out brown sugar and added drop of liquid smoke. It definitely doesn't take 5 to 6 hours...more like 2 or 3. Might have to play around with it to get it the way we like but it's a great start!

Wow - this was so easy and also delicious!  I dislike meatloaf immensely, and I only made this because all I had in the house was ground beef, and I know hubby loves meatloaf.  I have been won over, and I will certainly make this again.

Maybe I'm just used to more robust meatloaf but to me this was bland.  The cook time was off too.  I used a brand new crock pot and it took 7 hours.

This came out very moist and was super easy to make. However,  we didn't like the taste.  I also thought, while moist, it was actually a little too soft for my taste.

Good.  I too baked in the oven since I started making it around 5 and hadn't read the entire recipe.  I like to bake meatloaf covered with foil about half the time then uncover, cook another 20ish min and then put on the sauce/glaze and bake an additional 10-15 min.  I used a whole package of dry onion soup mix.  And I also double the glaze-Next time I will probably even triple it-strictly a matter of preference...I always prefer extra glaze on meatloaf no matter the recipe.    I agree with another reviewer that this is a good base recipe for meatloaf.  It's good as is and versatile so you can play around with other ingredients and seasonings per your personal taste.

This was moist and flavorful.  There was only 1 slice leftover.  I followed the directions exactly but next time I will cut the sage back to 1/4 tsp.  I like sage but felt that a 1/2 tsp. was too sage-y.  I would make this again.

I thought this was flavorful meatloaf! It reminded me of Bob Evans just slightly. I used Big Al's BBQ Sauce instead of the ketchup/brown sugar topping. Next time I'll try it with a mushroom gravy type sauce instead!

This the best meatloaf recipe that I've ever tasted. So nice and juicy and melt in your mouth tastiness. Only thing is I crisscross tin foil in the bottom of slow cooker and spray with Pam then put meatloaf mixture on top. It makes for easy lifting of meatloaf from the slow cooker.

I was very skeptical about cooking a meatloaf in my crockpot, but I thought why not give it a try.  Well...I will never bake one in my oven again!  This recipe is the best ever!!  I doubled the recipe using 2 lbs. of ground beef and 1 lb. of ground turkey and quadrupled the sauce....also used fresh, chopped vidalia onions instead of dried.  I was able to get 4 meals out of that amount (for 2 people).  This recipe is a real keeper.  Thanks!

I was disappointed in the flavor. I will try it again and add some seasonings and maybe bake it in the oven. The crockpot was a convenient way to cook it though and I added baby red potatoes and a bag of carrots. My favorite meatloaf recipe is Easy Meatloaf on this site.

I have to admit I was dubious when I first read this recipe.  Meat Loaf made in a slow cooker?   Well, I learned that slow cookers are great for meat loaf too!  I doubled the recipe because I wanted enough to freeze for later and like a lot of suggestions here, I discovered that the salt MUST be cut in half even if you are making just one recipe.  The next time I make it I will try substituting A-1 Sauce for the sage and see what taste change that brings.

PERFECT base recipe. The texture and moisture are perfect. I add more herbs and spices to mine.  I can see where some would think this recipe is bland, but you can always add more seasoning.

I was raised growing up with meatloaf as a staple.  This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted and sooooo simple!  I don't use a slow cooker so I just mixed it all together and baked it.  The last 15 minutes I topped it with the ketchup mixture, (I doubled that) and wha-la...the best ever. Thanks for the recipe we will always enyoy this!

This was very moist. The sauce was tasty. I gave it 4 stars because I needed to add spices to liven the meat up a bit: garlic powder, freshly ground pepper, ground sea salt.  Because my time was limited, I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.  Next time I will definitely use the slow cooker. UPDATE: The rave reviews for this came after packing sandwiches using the leftovers. I combined a little BBQ sauce with 1 T. mayo, spread it on slices of bakery mountain white bread, topped with Boston lettuce leaves, thinly sliced tomato, American cheese &, of course, the meatloaf. It was the hit lunch of the month!

really liked it and instead of using the plain panko bread crumbs - will use the stuffing or the flavored ones.  Used lipton soup mix instead of dried onions as I had read also.  Did Not add the sugar and loved the topping.  I also ran out of time and cooked it on 350 for an hour in a loaf pan (and checked with my meat thermometer for it to hit 160). all in all - easy and yummy - I had red skinned garlic mashed potatoes and greens with it :)

This was really good.  I didn't have the minced onion so I added a 1/2 of a yellow onion finely chopped.  Very easy to prepare.  I wouldn't wait until 15 minutes left to put the sauce on next time.  I might even go ahead and put it for the last hour to really get it nice and cooked down.

FINALLY A SLOW COOKER MEATLOAF I CAN LIVE WITH.  THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE.  I DID NOT HAVE THE ONIONS SO I SUBSTITUTED ONION POWDER, NO SEASONED BREAD CRUMBS SO I DICED UP DAY OLD WHITE BREAD AND ADDED DRIED PARSLEY AND GARLIC POWDER. WHEN THE MEATLOAF WAS COOKED I DRAINED IT AND THEN PUT THE SAUCE ON AND LET IT COOK FOR ANOTHER 15-20 MINUTES. THIS RECIPE WORKS ON SO MANY LEVEL; IT COMES TOGETHER QUICKLY, THE FINISHED PRODUCT IS MOIST AND DELICIOUS AND THE BEST PART, NO OVEN SO IT DOES NOT HEAT UP THE KITCHEN,A BIG PLUS WHEN YOU LIVE IN SOUTH TEXAS AND THE TEMP IS 100 IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR POSTING A FINE RECIPE.

An excellent meat loaf which I did in the oven rather than the slow cooker. Very tasty and easy to make. I substitued brown sugar with sugar free maple syrup for the topping.

This is the first time that I ever made a meatloaf in the crockpot.  Itt turned out rather delicious.  I was worried at first when the instructions stated to place the meatloaf in the crockpot and then turn it on.  I wondered how it would cook with no liquid but it cooked with its own juices.  We had it for two nights in a row.  Last night we ate it in a sandwich because we returned home rather late after a busy day but tonight we ate it with mashed potatoes and creamed corn.  Boy was it ever good.  I will most definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe Suzanne.  I also made two changes instead of dry minced onions I chopped a half an onion and I also chopped a 1/4 cup of green pepper.  Very good!

Love the recipe, but made a few changes. Instead of all ground beef, I use 1 lb. ground sirloin, 1/2 lb. ground pork and 1/2 lb. ground veal. Much more tasty than just using the beef and hardly any fat to drain off. I used a real onion, chopped. I used oatmeal (old fashioned-not quick cooking) instead of bread crumbs and added a little thyme. I also baked in the oven instead of slow cooker, 350 for about an hour.

I love slow cooker recipes and this one is excellent.  I also added all my vegies before topping them off with the meatloaf.  I did eliminate the sugar from the sauce but other than that, I followed the recipe and it was sooo good.

I substituted onion soup mix in place of the minced onion, added a little basil and oregano and cut back the brown sugar in the glaze to 1 tbsp. The taste of this meatloaf is incredible. I think it's the sage that really makes it good. My whole family loved this meatloaf.

I had some reservations about making this, but I needed a recipe that would let me take care of my 4 year old and 6 month old who managed to get sick at the same time.  This turned out much better than I expected.  I can't rate the sauce, as I don't like making ketchup sauces for meat loaves, using honey chipotle barbecue sauce instead.  The meat was juicy and had good flavor.  I will definitely be making this again! UPDATE:  Having made this quite a bit now, I do change a couple of things.  I use 2 pounds of meat, and when I have it I do half beef and half venison or pork to have less fat.  When I put it in the slow cooker, I leave it on high to get up to cooking temp faster, then low until it's done.  I still don't make the sauce tho cause I prefer barbecue sauce.

I really enjoyed it. The only thing I would do different is double the ketchup batch to have more of the topping.  My family loved it even the my 3 year old who is not a meat eater at all.

I made a lot of changes to the recipe pretty much by accident because I was in a rush to get dinner ready and didnt read the entire instructions before beginning. I baked my meatloaf in the oven, instead of slow cooking it. I substituted the dried onions for regular fresh ones that i minced myself. I also mixed all the ingredients together instead of making the separate glaze. The result was a nice, more moist meatloaf.

Unbelievably delicious meatloaf.  I had a recipe that I thought was great until my husband picked this recipe out to try.  It truly does melt in your mouth and the flavor is superb.  The best part of this recipe is that it is so quick and easy to make!  Who knew meatloaf could be so divine?!

Fantastic. When I first saw the recipe I thought, who would cook a meat loaf in a crock pot? Now I will never cook one any other way. I only added Parmesan cheese into the menu the 2nd time I cooked it.

it was good as is, but the next time I make it I'll reduce the brown sugar and probably add a bit of garlic and some cayenne pepper to give it a bit more of a kick.

This is AWESOME!!  I cannot claim that anyone in my family is a fan of meatloaf ... or at least we weren't before this recipe!  I had meat and the grill was out of gas so I found this recipe as a last resort ... it was so good, I have made it a regular part of our repertoire.

This was good! I made it exactly as stated. It was a bit salty, I think it may depend on the bread crumbs. I used Progresso Italian style bread crumbs. Would probably decrease or omit the salt if I made it with these bread crumbs, again. It had a really nice texture and sliced/held together well! Easy, too!

My wife took the left overs from this to work the next day. In 12 years of marriage she hasnt taken left overs once. So you know it had to be good. The sause is the best. I wish there was a way to brown it a little before serving.

My whole family agrees this is the best, easiest and tastiest meatloaf ever.  Put it in the slow cooker and forget it!! I added 1/2 cup oatmeal and used fresh onions and bell peppers for even more moisture and flavor.

I won't make this again.   It may be juicy but still very bland.  If we wouldn't have added catsup, during the meal,the meatloaf would have had no taste at all!

We eat venison instead of beef most of the time and the amount of liquid in this recipe made me think it would work - and it sure did. I didn't have time for the slow cooker, just put in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, let sit 10 minutes, and VOILA! Nice moist tasty meatloaf.

I didn't do the topping and added worcestershire sauce and garlic powder, left out the sage as I'm not a fan. Also crushed seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs as I had them on hand. Next time I will try in the slow cooker. 

Wonderfully moist and tasty! Thanks

Loved, loved this recipe.  The best meatloaf I have ever made, and I have tried many.  Didn't have time to do the sauce in step 2 and it was still great.  Had to substitute 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1 1/2 tsp sage powder and it tasted wonderful.

This was delicious. My husband doesn't like Meat Loaf but he did comment that if he had to eat it this would be the recipe to use. Even my Mother-Inlaw liked it and asked for the Recipe. :) I do like others suggested and used stove top instead of bread comes. Thanks for sharing. Will be using again.

We all loved it - although I made enough changes that maybe it's not really even the same thing! 
I used garlic and herb bread crumbs, omitted the sage, and added 1 small diced vidalia onion. I also added a splash of worcestershire to the meat mixture. For the sauce, I only added worcestershire to the ketchup (no sugar or mustard) and spread a LOT of it on the meat before I baked it at 350 for 60 minutes.

This meatloaf is pretty good- and I will make it again for sure!  I made a few changes.  I baked it in the oven, because I didn't have time for the slow cooker.  I actually added fresh minced onion, bell pepper and garlic.  I didn't do the sauce on top, but I did add the mustard and worchishire to the meat and decreased the milk a little bit.  Even with my changes I still give this a 5 because I like the consistency you get with the amount of eggs, milk and bread crumbs it calls for.  I didn't use bread crumbs because I didn't have any.  I used crushed saltines instead.  Next time Iwill make the sauce because apparently my husband likes things like that on his meatloaf.

This meatloaf is fine, but it is nothing special, especially if you get a bite that doesn't have sauce on it.  There isn't anything about it that makes it stand apart from any other meatloaf recipe.  It is just okay.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated with a few minor exchanges to make it a bit healthier - ground turkey instead of beef and ground fiber one cereal instead of bread crumbs, and it was delicious.  I would have given it 5 stars but i thought it could have used some more flavor perhaps it was because i didnt use the flavored bread crumbs.  I added extra spices to compensate but maybe i didnt add enough.

Pretty good. I used 94% lean ground beef, added a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the meat itself, a pack of onion soup mix, about half of a small onion, grated and 4 cloves of garlic. I did not add the sage as I did not have any on hand. As for the sauce, I left out the sugar completely. Cooked in the crock pot for about 4 hours on low and switched to the warm setting for the remaining 2 hours. My dinner guest thought it was very  good.

I made this the other day for dinner and my family loved it. My husband and I are cutting back the fat in our diets so I made the following changes: I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I used skim milk instead of whole milk. Turned out delicious!!!!

Exceptional recipe as is.  We added a bit more punch by adding more onion, shredded carrot, and coating the finished product with ramp mustard.

This was good.  I’m not sure it will replace my favorite meatloaf, but we enjoyed it.  I had never made a meatloaf in a crock pot, so I decided to give this a try.  I only used one pound of ground beef, scaled the other ingredients accordingly, and this was perfectly done in 5 hours on low.  I used heavy duty aluminum foil, folded into strips, sprayed them with Pam, and put them under the meatloaf and up the sides of the crock pot.  I then used the foil as “handles” to remove the loaf .  Worked perfectly.  I was impressed with this crock pot method, so I just may try my old standard meatloaf in a crock pot next time.

I normally don't review a recipe, but I had to for this.  I think that this is just about the best meatloaf I have ever made. My daughter , who isn't that crazy for meatloaf, can't leave this alone.  It is so easy to make and I especially like being able to use my slow cooker for it.  Thanks Suzanne for such a great recipe.  I make no changes to it and I love it leftover for sandwiches.  That is if I am lucky enough to have any leftover.

I have used my slow cooker for many things - chicken, pork, roasts, even a cake - but never meatloaf.  I was skeptical, but tried this anyway.  It is FABULOUS!!!  Moist, full of flavor, and the topping is delish! Don't skip that!  I know that I will use this recipe many times because I use my slow cooker so often when we are busy with work, school, sports, etc.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

I thought this was a super easy and tasty recipe! I used sauteed fresh onions in place of the dried onions and then I doubled the sauce ingredients, just so I would have extra to spread over the meatloaf. I would definitely recommend cutting back on the brown sugar though!!! I used only half of the amount called for in recipe and it was plenty sweet..if I had used the full amount it would have been WAY too sweet...even cut in half was still a tad too sweet. Next time I will cut back even further on the sugar.  An all-around great slow cooker recipe with wonderful flavor...will make again for sure!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made!  And I have made many.  Thanks for sharing!  Although I made it in a 350 degree oven for about 1 1/2 hours then topped with ketchup and uncovered for 30 min.[2 pound loaf]  :)

I failed to read that it is a slow cooker recipe so I quickly modified it to throw in the oven.  Combined the first six ingrediants as instructed, added worcestershire and ketchup to taste (I just eyeballed it) and threw in and extra 1/4 bread crumbs.  Mixed well with the ground beef and cooked on 375 to desired doneness.  It was AWESOME!  Took about 45 minutes total.

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever.  It holds its shape for sandwiches.  Freezes well.  With just my husband and me, I usually freeze half of it for another meal.  I have never been disappointed when I make this.  I even took it for a pot luck at work and got raves on it.  I usually add more onions than called for.

This was a very good meatloaf. I used herb seasoned stuffing instead of breadcrumbs because I had some on hand to use up.  The sage flavor was very mild and not overpowering.  And instead of the ketchup/brown sugar topping my husband requested mushroom soup topping. It was very good and was even delicious the next day as a sandwich. I will be making this again.

This is the best meatloaf I have made in a long time.  I wouldn't have thought of making a meatloaf in the slow cooker.  It was so tender and moist.  I guess it's the milk?  My 14 month old had about 3 servings.  I will be making this again!  I wouldn't change the sauce either, it turned out perfect.

This was an excellent meatloaf. Have prepared it both in the oven and crockpot and it is delicous both ways. Meatloaf is not one of my favorite dishes but this was great. My family ate every bite. I even doubled the recipe. The second time I made it I used stuffing mix instead of the seasoned bread crumbs and it was even better. Either way is super. Enjoy!!!!

so good and easy and practical. Played around with the spices a bit due to what I had on hand. Eyeballed everything, used only one egg, and omitted glaze alltogether cuz I wasn't gonna be home. I put the slow cooker on high, and 4 hours later it was cooked to perfection. Delicious!

Total Shock!  I have been making the almost exact recipe going on 30 years.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I don't like dried onions personally.  A couple of things I do different is, I use 1 tsp. sage, 1/4 c. grated fresh onions, (makes all the difference in the world), and for the sauce, absolutely no Worcestershire sauce, instead I put 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  It is now to die for!!  Oh, and this makes 3 mini loaves if you just have a couple of people in the household. Freezes very well.  Just thaw and bake.

This recipe was delish!  I took some suggestions from another reviewer and added a packet of onion soup mix.  For the sauce I only used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Baked in the oven 350 for 60 mins. Perfecto!

I, too, baked this in the oven at 350 for about 65 minutes. I used the oven because I hadn't really read the directions until it was too late.  I will try it in the crockpot next time though.  I used Egg Beaters to replace the eggs and fat-free bread crumbs.  Instead of the sage I used Greek Seasoning.  Next time I think I'll reduce the brown sugar in the topping to 1 tablespoon as it was rather sweet.  What gave it the 5 stars was the taste and texture.  Perfect cutting meatloaf that stayed together just right.  I can't wait to make meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow :) Update 1/17 - I finally had time to do this in the crockpot and it was fantastic.  I turned it up to high after I put the ketchup topping on.  Let it go another 1/2 hour and made perfect slices of just done meatloaf.  Yummy leftovers for tomorrow!

Delicious!! Very flavorful and juicy. At first I used a probe with my slow cooker, but it reached 160 degrees F way before the meat was actually cooked. I suggest setting your slow cooker on low and just leaving it for 6 hours instead of using a meat probe for this.

Pretty Tasty recipe. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but it was good and super easy to prepare! I would strongly recommend lining the bottom of the crockpot with foil so the loaf doesn't stick to the pot and makes cleanup a breeze!

Since I only had 1 pound of ground beef, reduced the milk to 1/2 Cup and substituted Ritz crackers, crushed, for breadcrumbs, since that's what I had.  This is VERY quick to make, but looked pretty unappetizing. DH said it was REALLY good.

Turned out very moist and super easy to throw together, which is just my style. I did leave out the brown sugar and added a bit of thyme to the meat mixture.

I did double the sauce recipe but like some others found it way too sweet.  I had to add extra ketchup and ground mustard to take away some of the sweetness.  Next time I will use less sugar but overall this is the best meatloaf recipe I have found.

We loved this meatloaf!  I like to make it on Sundays because our church lets out at 4 and to come home to most of dinner already made and smelling good is just heavenly!  This meatloaf is moist and holds together well.  I will never go back to using the oven.  Thanks Suzanne!

This is now the ONLY meatloaf recipe my family will eat.  Changed nothing except adding onions (they don't like them).  I'd recommend this to anyone.  I got both the four year old and picky twelve year old to eat it!  We had some exceptionally lean (dry) meat we needed to eat and this came out wonderfully moist and flavorful.  Thanks Suzanne!

Very simple, pretty good but will add the onion soup mix next time. Put the crock pot on a 10 hour setting so might add more milk  b/c it was a little dry.  Will make again.

This is a really great meatloaf recipe. My oven wasn't working, so I was really excited to find the recipe here. I used ground turkey instead of beef, since that's what I had, and everyone from ages 38 to 2 loved it. Great with mashed potatoes and cornbread.

Like others have said in reviews before me, I will most likely never go back to making meatloaf in the oven again. It was fabulously moist, tasty, and super easy. I got it going before I left for work, and it was ready for my husband to devour and enjoy when he got home from his job. Thanks Suzanne! I can't wait to make it again...oh, and I doubled the ingredients so that there would be plenty for sandwiches :)

Hello Suz, thanks for the recipe that made my husband take three slices!!!  He is a meat loaf lover and after 52 years of marriage I have been looking the entire time for the very BEST meatloaf receipe!!  I think you did it for me.  He will be enjoying his special sandwiches for lunch tomorrow and probably a little sneak piece before bedtime.  Thanks so much.  (I did cook ours in the oven 365 Degrees for 90 min. on a rack with tinfoil under it.)  Made for much easier clean up.  Bev

Very moist. Substituted onion with onion soup. Baked in conventional oven at 350 for 90 minutes. Ensure internal temp > 160. Excellent taste.

This was very, very good. I'm not one to like just plain ketchup poured on top of a meat loaf but with the brown sugar mixed in, it was great. Will definately fix again and again.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had, my kids loved it! It is very moist.  I also used garlic salt for the salt and I also added a little red pepper I followed everything else exactly as written. This recipe will definitely go in the weekly rotation.

I've tried so many Meatloaf recipes over the years but never thought that my new favorite would be one made in a Crockpot. Anytime I have meatloaf I have to have Ketchup with it, but not with this one. The only change to the recipe was that I used Ground Pork..( can't stand beef). The Meatloaf was really moist and the sauce was awesome. After dinner the Ketchup bottle went back to the fridge NEVER being used by anyone...that is a first. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

All four of my kids (even the picky one) and my husband and me loved this meatloaf.  I didn't have dried minced onion so I used a packet of french onion soup mix (I doubled the recipe so used the whole packet).  I had no breadcrumbs so I used crushed saltines instead.  For the topping I used half the brown sugar and had no worcestshire (bad spelling) sauce so I just omitted it.  Shaped into 2 loaves and baked in the oven on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes @ 350 then put the topping on and baked another 30 minutes.  Will use again soon!

I'm only rating the meatloaf topping for this one. I needed a glaze for 'The Best Meatloaf' and I've have a hard time finding one that was just right.  Well, I found it here! Whatever meatloaf I make from here on out will get this one.  The perfect blend of sweetness.  (I got scared about trying the slow cooker with hamburger--all those little microorganisms having a cozy place to grow... but maybe I'll get brave and try it one day.)

Excellent tast, comes out moist and doesn't heat up the kitchen by using an oven.  My daughter went from not liking meatloaf to loving it with this recipe!

My husband loves meatloaf and I don't, so I have been looking for a recipe that he would enjoy and I could eat without hating it. He's away right now and I decided to try this one. The only difference is that I added a generous amount of Weber's Chicago Steak Spice, which I do with any meat. I love the way it brings out the flavor. I envited my son and his Fiancee over to share (he doesn't like meatloaf either) and the meatloaf was moist and was a smashing success with all of us. Love the sauce. It was excellent and has definitely got a permanent spot in my recipe box... Thank you.

Gave this one a 4, but it deserves a 5 due to the fact that it ACTUALLY DOES melt in your mouth.  I have NEVER cooked a meatloaf with milk in it until now.  I did alter it a little.  I don't like ketchup on my meatloaf, so I did the sauce with ANY BBQ sauce, (with the same brown sugar, etc).  I also added chopped onion, AND green pepper, baked it in the oven on 350 for an hr. . .added the sauce and baked for another 15 mins, and VOILA!!!!!!!  Thanks Morgan  Kenya & Family

This was a very moist and tender meatloaf! I tweaked the spices, as I used plain breadcrumps, and added salt, pepper, oregano and a little bit of cajun seasoning and a shot of A1 steak sauce bold and spicy. The ketchup topping I made with half hot ketchup and half normal ketchup and added a shot of Teriyaki sauce to it, and I also just used one tablespoon of sugar. This was the first meal I cooked for my inlaws and they loved it! Thanks alot!

It was "melt-in-your-mouth" however, I did not care for the consistancy of it.  I'm anxious to try it sliced thin and made into a sandwich.  My husband said it wasn't bad, but I didn't think it had much taste.  I even added a jalepeno pepper to the meat.  Not a bad recipe if you have children since it was rather plain.

WOW, this was delicious!  I baked it in the oven because I wanted it quickly after reading the reviews.  We loved it and I'm making it for dinner guests again next week ut with turkey [he's a health nut:) I'm sure it will be just as delicious.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Fantastic!! I only did half of the brown sugar in the sauce and added a bit of smashed garlic to the meat mixture. It was AMAZING!! My husband doesn't really care for meatloaf and not only did he finish his plate, it was his late night snack also! This even beats out mom's!

I would have given this 5 stars, but my hubby requested "my" meatloaf,(which comes straight from the back of the Liptons Beefy Onion soup mix box) a few days later. I thought it was great. The sauce was sooo good! I made it just as the recipe states.

It was just okay for us.  It was moist, but I found the texture off putting.  However the cooking method was great.  I wii try this one more time, perhaps substituting fresh bread crumbs or crushed saltines.  I definitely think it has potential.

It was over 90 degrees outside, too hot to cook.  So, I tried this recipe.  Used ground turkey and added chopped onion & peppers.  Put in crockpot on high for 4 hours.  Didn't look pretty but it tasted fabulous!  My boyfriend enjoyed it.  Will make again.

I made this using ground Turkey.  In light of the people complaining about not being much flavor in the meat, I increased the spices.  In addition to the sage, I added an equal amount of Herbs de Provence.  I was really happy with the flavor.  A couple observations:  The sauce really did come out too sweet as mentioned by several reviewers.  Next time, I'll use much less brown sugar, if any at all.  Also if you plan to use ground turkey for this as I did (to cut calories) I don't recommend the Crock Pot method.  I recommend baking in the oven in as large a roasting pan as you can find.  So much liquid cooked out of the turkey, the meatloaf was completely submerged in  the pot.  Also, the liquid had this really unplease looking layer of white goop on top.  It didn't affect the flavor, it just looked aesthetically bad.  I had to skim off the white stuff and suck out about half the liquid using a turkey baster before the step where you add the sauce.  The meatloaf did come out really good though, and it was even better on Day 2.

Because of cholesterol issues in my house, I substituted ground buffalo (1 lb.) and ground turkey (1 lb.). I also used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I find regular fine bread crumbs create an unpleasant gummy texture in my meatloaf. I topped my meatloaf with BBQ sauce. Loved the results from the crock pot. Thank you!

The meatloaf itself came out very moist and delicious. Only four stars was because of the sauce for the topping. Everyone thought it was way too sweet even after I had doubled the ketchup. Worth another try with adjustment.

I used the receipe as a base line for meat loaf.  About the only thing I changed is, I used rice instead of bread/crackers for holding the meat together.  Also, I cooked this in the oven for about 1.0 to 1.5 hours instead of crockpot.  Turned out excellent!

I've tried a few meatloaf recipes but this one is a keeper!!  Not only does it taste great, it looks great too!!!  I didn't have dried minced onions so I used a handful of chopped fresh onions and I didnt wait to glaze it, I added it right before I put it in the crock for 5 1/2 hours.  Great Great Great!!

I made this using two pounds of ground round to cut back on fat, and cracker meal instead of bread crumbs.  Also used fresh sage, and my gosh, was this good!  Even my picky soon-to-be daughter-law loved it.  I think the secret is in the sauce added at the end.  Anyway, I've got a new favorite meat loaf.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good, and a great way to have a comfort food meal without heating up the kitchen!  Instead of the salt, I used Adobo.  Next time, I think I'll increase the amount though.  It could have used a little more flavor.  Other than that, I made the recipe "as is".  My family enjoyed this meatloaf more than my old standby that I usually make in the oven!

I have never liked meatloaf.  I decided to try a recipe and came across this one.  Now meatloaf is one of my favorite meals!  I didn't change a thing, and my family requested extra sauce to dip the meatloaf.  I love the sweet ketchup sauce, and the meat is so moist.  This is definitely a staple when I'm feeding my husband's friends!

I used stuffing mix (dry) instead of bread crumbs, and it turned out good.  My husband thought this meatloaf was great...however, I like more chopped up veggies in mine.  Next time I'll try it adding finely minced carrotts, and a little finely diced bell pepper.

As suggested by others, I substituted season salt for regular salt and added an additional teaspoon; I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder; and cut the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. I don't normally like meat loaf but this was very tasty and easy to prepare. Thanks Suzanne.

My husband hates meatloaf but when he tried this he gave a BIG thumb's up! I added a little bit of mozzarella cheese to it and then transferred to the oven when it came time to do the topping but all in all, this is a great recipe!!!

This meatloaf is so moist and delicious.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed saltine crackers instead and omitted the salt in the recipe.  I also added some garlic powder and oregano.  Definitely use a lean ground beef....I had to drain the grease off of mine.  My family loved this, and it reheats well too.

This was good because of the glaze, but the meat portion itself was quite bland. There is another recipe on this site where you mix some of the glaze in with the meat mixture before baking, and I think that is much better. My husband liked this though.

I have made it twice in the past week and both times I cooked it in the oven at 350. The second time I made it I used half ground beef and half sweet Italian sausage. Both times it was excellent, yet the sweet Italian sausage gave it a little taste of "Italian meatloaf"! I use half and half instead of milk and panko Italian bread crumbs! Also added Parmesan cheese to the mixture!

This is my go to meatloaf recipe. My husbands favorite thing to eat (he's picky) even my 5yr old loves it. I use parmesean bread crumbs and double the sauce but other wise I make it as is. I usually use the oven but have made it both ways and it turns out great either way.

Excellent! I have never made meatloaf before, but my husband really likes it. I bought all the ingredients and planned to make it in the crockpot, but didn't have a chance to start it before work. So when I got home tonight I put it together and put it in the oven. I only had 1 lb of ground beef, otherwise followed the recipe. Used Italian flavored seasoned bread crumbs, and smoked sea salt instead of just regular salt. I was in a hurry, so I cooked it for 30 minutes on 400 degrees, then I drained the grease and lowered the temp to 350 for 15 minutes. At that point added the sauce (doubled the recipe) and baked for 25 more minutes at 350 degrees. Let it rest for 5 minutes and it was PERFECT. I will make it in the crockpot next time, but the bottom line is that the spice blend and flavors were wonderful!

I made quite a few alterations (oven instead of crockpot, soup mix instead of dried onion, different sauce), but the base is a great start.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe ever!  It comes out very juicy and flavorful, not dry like many other recipes.  I even had dinner guests, that don't normally prefer meatloaf, say that this one is a winner.  I don't ever use sage because it's not an ingredient I typically use and I make sure to always use real chopped onions vs the powder.

Very good meatloaf.  I used seasoned crackers instead of bread crumbs because I had a lot of 'Alabama Fire Crackers' from AR to use up.  They worked perfectly in this recipe.  I baked at 350° for an hour rather than using the slow cooker.  Served this with 'Baked Potato' and 'Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce' from AR.

Made this recipe as is. Only exception was I baked it since my crock was broken at the time. Still wonderful. I make it all the time now switching between either crockpot or oven. Although nowadays I just make the sauce "to taste" with all the same ingredients. A smart cook knows to taste what they can as they cook- so anyone complaining the sauce is too sweet, taste it before you put it on!

I cooked my onion and garlic in a little olive oil and Worcestershire sauce.  It tastes better because I don't like the taste of raw onion.  I always use this recipe.  I put half beef and half minced turkey.  more healthier and tasty.

Big hit with my family!  Sometimes I bake it in the oven instead of slow cooker.  The sauce, baked on, is delish!  I've also made ahead and frozen either way-raw or baked!

Definitely using this recipe again!
We didn't have a slower cooker so we went with using the stove set to 160 C for 45 minutes. And also for the the last ten minutes, we placed the sauce.
I used the advice on lowering the brown sugar to half and it turned out just fine.

I make this recipe and everyone loves it but I use Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbeque sauce instead of the sauce this recipe calls for. No fuss no muss and there's plenty of sauce to go around.

It's moist, but very bland. I did like another reviewer said and used cream of mushroom soup for the gravy, it's ok. I wish I would have used something else. The mushroom soup didn't add any flavor to the meatloaf. It was very hard to slice and get out of the crock pot without it crumbling.

Thank you for such a great take on meatloaf!  My little brother hated meatloaf (his school cafeteria version) until he tried my attempt at it. 
I followed this recipe but didn't want to wait 5-6hrs for a slow cooker, so I baked it in a convection oven at 325 degrees F for 90mins and it still came out moist. I also don't carry dry mustard so I used honey dijon mustard and it worked just fine as well. Thank you again! :)

Delish!  I used onion soup mix in place of the dried minced onion and salt and added some garlic powder. Was very pleasantly surprised that meatloaf done in a crock pot could turn out so good!  Thanks for the recipe.

We all love this recipe.  The only thing I do different is for the topping I mix brown sugar with BBQ sauce.  It is delicious and I've had people call to get the recipe.  No more dry meatloaf!

I’ve made this at least once a month in the last year, it is the perfect meatloaf. I substitute 1/2 lb ground pork for the additional 1/2 lb of beef. Add a little garlic and use a onion soup mix. It’s delicious without my substations though. Leftovers don’t last to long!

I don't use the crock pot, I bake in oven at 350 for about an hour and 20. Still super delicious. Also makes great meatballs, just mix everything together including sauce mixings and bake on broiler pan at 350 for about an hour.

My own recipe is very similar to this one but I use 1 lb hamburger and 1 lb of mild sausage. This does make it very greasy (just drain) but the flavor is awesome! I also must admit that my sauce is equal parts of ketchup and brown sugar - very, very sweet but I've had no complaints!

DELISH! Loved this recipe bur next tiem I will do as the other reviews say and double the sauce for the top...we also added a bit of bacon and cheese to the meatloaf since we were pairing it with twice baked mashed potatoes from this site and had a little extra from preparing those. Will definitely make again.

I made this following the exact recipe except I didn't have the minced onion so I used the onions out of a packet of onion soup mix. It was really good. I did feel it needed a little bit more flavor so I think I will add the whole packet of soup mix next time like some other reviews stated. So easy in the crockpot too!

I made this meat loaf and was wondering how it would turn out in the slow cooker and it was great. That was my first time making meat loaf in the slow cooker and my boyfriend and myself really liked it. I will be making this again.

Doubled sauce - used molasses instead of brown sugar to cut back on the sweetness and put the Worcestershire in the meat mix not in sauce. Yum!

This was a great recipe.  I made some small adjustments - added one chopped green onion, 1 tbsp minced garlic and four diced mushrooms.  I then reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp for the sauce. I then paired it with 'Roasted Garlic Cauliflower' and garlic bread and it was a hit!

Pretty good meatloaf.  I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but I do like that I can put it in the crock pot before work and it's pretty much done when I get home.

I made this and cooked it in my smoker -  smoked meatloaf - Oh yeah babe! Smoked at 280°F with hickory. The ketchup takes the hickory smoke and is killer! I've been smoking meatloaf, and just about anything else I can fit in my 6 smokers, for years. Visit our website - www.theqjoint.com - to find out how to do it.

I love this meat loaf.  The sauce is fantastic!

Update: doubled everything except used 3 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup bread crumbs.  Cooked 95 minutes at 325. Next time quadruple sauce recipe so some can be served on side.

I was a little nervous adding the milk but i thought I would stick to your recipe pretty close.  I did add extra spices.  I choped up some bell pepper, garlic, hot pepper seed, Itialian seasoning.  This was the best meat loaf that I have ever had.  The ketchup sause was awesome!

Fantastic meatloaf!  I've always loved meatloaf, but this will be my new go-to recipe.  Very easy and delicious.  I cut it down to 4 servings to use 1 pound of meat and it came out very nicely.

The best meatloaf ever! I substituted the dried onion with 1/4 cup finely minced onion and didn't have sage, so I used Bell's turkey seasoning. This meatloaf had a great texture too. Everyone loved it!

My husband and I liked it, but none of my three kids liked it.  They usually eat meatloaf without a fuss.  I had to pour off the grease from the crockpot before I put the sauce over it.  I think maybe it was too moist.  I'll have to make my normal baked meatloaf from now on.

Wow! This one's a keeper! I read all the reviews about non meat loaf eaters liking this, and I must say it's true!  It's that topping that does the trick! Very moist yet slices cleanly, and makes great left over sandwiches. I use fresh chopped onions and omit the sage. It's also very forgiving time wise.  I've been late and let it go an extra 1/2 hr, or not had exactly the amount of ground beef called for and no matter what, the texture is excellent and holds together well. This will be the last meatloaf recipe I try!

This was a big hit with my family!  I made the loaf following the recipe.  Like others, I reduced the brown sugar in the sauce to 1 tbsp.  The meat was cooked after 2 hours in the slow cooker, so I just switched it to warm until we were ready to eat.  We could have used a little more sauce, so next time I will double it.  This is a keeper!

It was good.  Didn't change a thing.  I think the cook time stated may be off, though.   It was done in about half the time.

Loved this! Only made one modification...HERB STUFFING....I followed the recipe as instructed twice and my family loved it. Then I made 1 modification....i used herb flavored stuffing instead of bread crumbs...HOLY COW! Amazing difference in flavor. We've made this our Tuesday-Night Meatloaf!  Thanks, Suzanne.

I followed the recipe and added some.  For the loaf, I added some extra seasonings and cheese.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used DARK brown sugar.  Also it wasn't greasy at all, our burger has pretty much no fat  in it.  It was excellent and we will definately have it again.

Delicious!  I followed all the directions perfectly and the only thing I changed was that I doubled the sauce.  It was so good!  My one problem was that it stuck the bottom of the pan when I tried to get it out.  I'm going to spray it next time around so that it hopefully won't leave big chunks behind.  Looks aside, the loaf was delicious.  I'll make this one again.

I always like to try a recipe as written first.  The only thing I did alter was using only 1 Tablespoon of the brown sugar as I don't like anything too sweet.  This recipe was awesome.  I've made alot of meatloafs in my time and this was right up there with the best.  So easy.  Never thought I'd be making a meatloaf in a slow cooker.  Excellent recipe and all ingedients are usually on hand.  My husband went nuts over this and said it was as satisfying as a steak dinner.  Served with homemade roasted garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Nothing was left so I can't comment on the great sandwiches I bet it would make the next day.

This meatloaf lives up to its name as it really does melt in your mouth. I used a low-fat ground beef and didn't have excessive grease. I also made my own seasoned bread crumbs as I didn't have any. Instead of ketchup for the top, I used some leftover homemade pizza sauce that can be found on allrecipes "Easy Pizza Sauce III". Based on other reviews, I halved the brown sugar I added to the sauce for the top and it was just sweet enough.  The flavor and texture was excellent and it was very moist. I really liked the sage in the meatloaf. I'd never used sage in meatloaf before and it truly compliment the meat.   I WILL be making this again. Thanks, Suzanne, for sharing the recipe.

This meatloaf recipe is wonderful!  It is easy to make, simple ingredients and is a personal favorite in our home. A few changes I made were to use fresh onion and add 2 cloves of fresh garlic.

This was an awesome recipe!!!  Meat loaf is one of those things that can become way too dry, but this meat loaf was so so moist!!  You could double the batch of the topping if you like extra sauce!  Awesome recipe and so easy to make!

I liked this recipe when I had a taste when it first came out of the oven but it was not good when I warmed it up an hour later for my boyfriend. I followed the reviews and reduced the brown sugar for the glaze but I think it would have been better with more brown sugar. Just taste it before you put it in on the meatloaf to see if it's the right amount for you. It was easy to make and didn't take long to prepare but the meatloaf itself was almost too soft for my taste. A little too "ketchupy". I feel bad giving a medium review because it has a lot of good reviews. In the end it was okay but I wouldn't make it again

"The best meatloaf you've ever made!" (Per my husband) Very easy to throw together and the sauce added just the right zing. 9I added soy sauce instead of Worchestershire, since I didn't have any)

I like a glaze with a kick.  I used ketchup, and spicy mustard, and instead of brown sugar subbed chili, garlic sauce (found in Chinese section in grocery stores).  The meatloaf was fantastic.

This is fantastic!  I made a few changes, which I think gave it more flavor.  I substituted onion powder for the minced onion, since I don't like the texture of onions.  I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt, and I used an Italian seasoning blend instead of the rubbed sage.  I used the amounts given for everything.  My husband made the glaze and halved the brown sugar.  It turned out perfectly! We will definitely be having this again!

Wonderful flavor. I would suggest sautéing the onion with a little garlic and adding the salt and sage. Be sure to drain well if using oil instead of cooking spray. For a spicier version try adding about a half cup of salsa. This also adds a bit of texture. The best part of cooking in the slow cooker is there's no need to drown the meatloaf with ketchup because it's dry. This comes out very moist so the ketchup/Worcestershire topping is a perfect enhancement to the flavor of the loaf without drowning it out. If you are short on time though, form into a loaf and cook for about 1 hour at 350. For a leaner result, form into a loaf and place on a broiler pan. This will allow the fat from the beef to drain off. And I don't know how it works, but if you coat the sides and top with egg it helps keep moisture in and provides crispy edges.

Very tasty. I'm relatively new to cooking so I'm scared to make any modifications whatsoever and this was great as is! I've never made a meatloaf before and couldn't figure out how this would work in a slow cooker, but it did and it was great--especially for how easy it was. I'd imagine you could add more spices to up the flavor level, but I'm not there yet. :)

I absolutely LOVE this meatloaf and I am not the biggest fan of meatloaf in general. I add a packet of onion soup mix, garlic powder and a bit of oatmeal in place of the breadcrumbs because I love the texture. Double the topping (not the brown sugar though). My husband raves each time I make this.

Why make it any other way?  Yum!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and made no changes.  Big hit with the men in the house and I loved the little bit left over in a sandwich the next day.  Thank you!

I enjoyed this meatloaf. I am sure I would have given it 5 stars but I made a boo boo. I mixed all ingredients at once. None the less I still made the sauce to pour over.  I will make this again

Made it last night in the oven at 350F for 1 hour. Followed other reviews: foiled 30 min., unfoiled 15 min, then 15 with sauce. Also doubled sauce as per other review.  Considering the amount of meat I had, I doubled the ingredients - also had two loaf pans. In one pan, I decided to put some foil - thought it would be easier to take out: BIG MISTAKE !!! Because of the sweet sauce, it stuck to the sides. Had to turn the loaf over in plate - what a mess. It broke in two, meaning the top 1/2 came out, and the top bottom was still stuck in the pan. Had to scrap it out. The other pan was OK. I also used less sauce on that one and it was perfect; nice glaze on top.  The taste was good, but I would play with the spices (add more), such as pepper, garlic, sautee onions, etc. Also used an onion soup mix instead of minced onion, and added sautee portobella mushrooms.  Today, we had it as cold sandwiches (buttered with mustard). That was good.  I will make it again, but adjust a number of ingredients.

We have never been big meat loaf fans in the past. I made this recipe last week when I was needing a comfort food. I made this exactly as it was written...just gotta say, we're fans of meat loaf now.  I doubled the recipe since I had some thawed ground beef that needed to be used..glad I did, I had left over for sandwiches which were really good.    I'm making a double recipe today. I can't wait for dinner!!

This is an exceptionally moist meatloaf. I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker, so I just baked it at 350 in the oven for a bit over an hour. I also used soy milk instead of regular, and added Italian seasoning and garlic powder.

I made this for my husband. He loves meat loaf. I don't like it at all so my rating is based on his reaction to eat. I ended up throwing most of it away.  He had a small piece the night I made it and never touched the leftovers. He normally eats leftovers for his lunches so I don't think was very good.

Great meatloaf!  The only things I did differently was to use 1 pound of ground pork and 1 pound of ground chuck and leave out the sage. It stayed together very well and had a fine texture. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever made.

FABULOUS!!  With the onions being minced, and hardly noticable, my kids ate it up!  We love meatloaf, and now we can have it right when we get home since it cooks all day! This is the ONLY way I'll ever make meatloaf again!!

This is such an easy recipe that everyone should have it as their basic recipe.  I would like to add more spices to extend a stronger flavor though.  So I'll experiment the next time.  I did use panko rather than bread crumbs and really liked the consistency of the meatloaf because of this ingredient.  What is great is using the crock pot to make it.  Just what the doctor ordered.

i was really looking forward to this meat loaf. but after SIX hours in the crock pot it was not fully cooked!! very very disappointing... so i put it in the over @ 400 for 30 min. it was o.k...i think putting it in the oven didn't give it the melt-in-your-mouth taste. i might give it another shot next time....

I gave this 4 stars because my family does not like brown sugar in the topping! I made the topping without the brown sugar and it was amazing. I made the loaf just as the directions state and it was so juicy and moist.

I added some sweet italian sausage to the meat mixture,  and adjusted the sauce to have a little extra on top.  The family loved it and there was only a small slice left for me.

It also slices awesome for sandwiches the next day!

Wow, this meatloaf came out so moist. I did have to double all the ingredients because I had 3lbs of meat and it did take a little longer but well worth the wait.

I followed this recipe exactly but cooked it in the oven in a loaf pan at 350 degrees for 60 minutes.  The meatloaf was moist and the sauce was delicious.  Even my 3 year old loved it!  Thank you for a great meatloaf recipe!

This was a very tasty recipe. I rated it a four because I felt it was too moist. My husband liked it better heated over the next day because it was drier. I went exactly by the recipe and the flavor was great.

I made this as written except for adding a 1/2 packet of onion soup mix and about a 1/2 of a chopped fresh onion, since I had no dried onion. I thought it was pretty good tasting, if not the most attractive looking dish (it also emitted quite a bit of odd looking white sludge while cooking--and I only cook with very lean ground beef). I normally use both bread AND breadcrumbs and no milk in my own recipe and top it with plain tomato sauce and tomato paste. This was an interesting change of pace. It definitely had a good combination of flavors and I did like the topping, although I used about half the amount of brown sugar based on other reviews. I will use this recipe on occasion when I have the time to slow cook, but I don't think it will completely replace my usual family recipe, made in the oven. Thanks for sharing!

Wow!!! this was the best meatloaf we've ever had.  Although now mom's is a close second....  Sorry mom!  I did "tweak" it a little bit.  I added more onion than what was called for.  And put added liquid smoke to the meat mixture.  Since I didn't have sage I added poultry seasonong to the mixture also.  As for the topping I added "Tastefully Simple's" Merlot Sauce.  OMG!!!  Like I said this was the BEST!

This really was "Melt-In-Your-Mouth" tender! The only problem I had was cutting the meatloaf and serving it on a plate without it falling apart. A bit sweet but I liked it. Served with "The Best Mashed Potatoes" and broccoli.

This was pretty good.  I liked the way it held together and I liked the topping.  The sage was a little different.  I've been looking for just the right meat loaf recipe for my family and this was close, but not quite it.  If you haven't tried this recipe, it is definitely worth trying.  It's just not exactly the one for me.

I am sorry to say that this was such a let down. I really looked forward to making this because of the review it got, but it was absolutely the worst meatloaf we have ever had. The glaze was so sweet we all wiped it off of the meat, & the meat itself had zero flavor. I hate being negative, especially when someone else was so positive about the recipe. Sorry....it was just awful!

This was a good meatloaf. I added extra onions and liquid smoked flavor. Also, I baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour instead of using the crockpot.

Sorry but no one in my family of three liked this. We couldnt even eat it. What a waste. Texture was really odd.  The only good thing I can say about this recipe was that the topping was just ok.

Sorry, but I found this recipe too bland. I'm a meatloaf lover but this one missed the mark. It seemed to being missing more than just one thing.

One of the better meat loaf recipes I have found on this site. I wasn't too sure when I mixed it up because it seemed to be a lot of liquid for the amount of meat but it soaked it up just fine. The topping was a very nice touch too. I used up some leftover crushed seasoned croutons for the bread crumbs.

I wasn't too thrilled with how this came out (not quite like meatloaves of the past)- but I'm pretty sure it was my "modifications", so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe that I intentionally modified)- and hopefully my mistake will be a future lesson for someone else:  I used ground turkey and beef, thought that the turkey would end up too dry so I chopped up some bacon and added it to the mix (because hey - who doesn't like bacon?).   I used dry seasoned bread crumbs - I saw another review that mentioned stuffing mix - might give that a go.  This was my first slow cooker meatloaf and it cooked perfectly in the slow cooker.  I didn't think that it was dry, but my husband thought that it was a touch dry. It reminded me a bit like canned corned beef (again, this is most likely my fault).  Can't complain too much though - husband and I both went back for seconds. Will have to try this one another time.

overall very good.  I made some changes with a chopped fresh onion, and used a good half cup or so of sour cream instead of the milk.

Meatloaf was good. It is a little challenge making it in the slowcooker wihout a pan. It loses some of it's shape. However, the sauce was very good. If anything I would recommend more sauce - enough so you have some to pour over the meatloaf and some on the side for dipping the meatloaf.

I like the idea of cooking meatloaf in the crockpot, but this didn't work for me. The glaze was way too sweet for my personal taste and the meat itself was a bit dry. I'll stick with my old recipe from here on out. But thank you!

My husband isn't much of a beef person, but he went for seconds on this meatloaf and thought it was awesome.  I changed my method of cooking though.  I made it into an actual long loaf and popped it in the oven at 375 for 1 hour, then another 15 minutes with the ketchup topping.  It was still tender and juicy with a nice glaze of juices (I used 80/20 ground beef), and didn't take over 5 hours to make!

My family and I think this recipe is delicious and a keeper!  The meatloaf was very moist. I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  Instead of using all beef I used a meat mixture of beef, pork and veal.  I also cooked it in a loaf pan in the oven instead of the crockpot.  It was great!!

The topping is exactly how I learned to make it from my mom except I put the wrocesteshire sauce into the meat mixture not the topping.  Other than that, it is the best topping I have ever tasted for meatloaf.  I use quite abit of worcestershire sauce in the meat mixture too.

GREAT!  Growing up I HATED meatloaf.  My mother made the worst ever!  Was given a recipe similar to this and amazingly liked it.  The only change I make is that I used tomato juice, vegetable juice or tomato sauce instead of the milk.  My family prefers that.  I also make sure my onions are very VERY fine.  I always get rave reviews when I make this!

This recipe is excellent!  I substitued ground pork for the beef. I messed up the first time I made it.  I was in a hurry & put the some of the ketchup in the meat mixture by mistake.   It was a happy mistake, because the family loved it.  It was very moist & makes a great sandwich.  I made the meatloaf again, but left the ketchup out of the meat mixture, but they said they preferred it with the ketchup. The topping tastes great.

I've been making a similar version of this for about 20 years --with a few differences.  I use at least 2 pounds of ground beef (lean) then I sweat some onions (green if I have them) in a little olive oil and I use Rice Krispies for the bread crumbs.  I also make enough of the sauce (ketchup, mustard, brown sugar) to mix some of it in the meatloaf.  And I bake it on the oven but will try the crock pot!

Although I think it would have been a tab better if the meat was jazzed up just a touch more on how moist this was and the ease of preparation this was for sure a 5! We will be making this a regular on our list of meals. Thanks.

The meatloaf turned out well, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  The topping was very good, but there just wasn't enough of it.  This would be perfect if there was just more topping.  I ended up having to dip mine in BBQ sauce.

Very fast and easy to make!  I made it exactly as the recipe said, except I used a small fresh diced onion instead of dried.  I was wondering how this would all come together with 3/4 cup of milk added, but it did and it came out very moist after cooking.  I cooked it on low for the first 2 hours, took a look at it and it looked like it had hardly cooked, so I bumped it up to high for the last 2 1/2 or 3.  My only complaint is that the seasoned bread crumbs (I used Italian) was a little strong.  Next time, I may do a combo of seasoned and plain bread crumbs.  Not my most favorite meatloaf recipe, but I will definitely keep it for a fast and easy crockpot meal!

I'm sorry but both my husband and I both disliked this meatloaf.  It was bland and blah!  Meatloaf is one of my husband's FAVS but not this one!  It had virtually NO taste.

This is a great meatloaf, so moist and delicious and very easy!  There are only a few slow cooker recipes that my meat and potatoes husband really likes, and this one makes the list.

Very Good. Added more onion and seasoning, other than that stayed true to the recipe. Super moist and easy. Thanks for the great recipe.

This has got to be the best Slow Cooked
Meatloaf I have made.  I feed an Elderly
Gentleman, and he could not stop raving.
Thanks
