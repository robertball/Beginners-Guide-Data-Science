I've done quite a lot of baking in my life, which has included more cakes than I could count. This chocolate cake is one of the best I've ever made. Moist, fragrant,dark and with a rich chocolate flavor. It will become a classic go-to recipe for me. No reason to search for a better chocolate cake.

This is truly a black magic cake. The batter was so thin that i wasn't sure how the cake would turn out. I had used two 9inch round pans. The cakes were perfectly done in 30 mins. I made a delicious frosting with whipping cream, cherry liquer, vanilla essence and powdered sugar. I also filled in lots of canned pitted cherries. I've never decorated a cake before so i think i didnt do justice to how it tasted. Absolutely delicious....tasted like a very authentic German Black Forest cake. i'm just posting a photo since there is none after so many reviews.

I have had this recipe since 1979 where I got it off the back of a Hershey cocoa can. It has been a family favorite ever since!  I was glad to see it on all recipes with all the different frosting ideas.  I use a 7 minute frosting and fold in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and let sit just until they barely start to melt. Spread onto cake carefully as to not completely blend in the chocolate chips, then chill.  You have crunchy ribbons of chocolate mixed into the frosting.  It is wonderful!

For those who had problems with the cake rising, I found this explanation of Dutch process cocoa which can make difference in the results: 
When it comes to baking, be sure to use the type of cocoa specified in the recipe. Those that are leavened with baking soda require natural (non-Dutch processed) cocoa so that the alkalinity of the baking soda can neutralize the acidic cocoa. Recipes leavened with baking powder require Dutch-process cocoa to maintain the neutral pH of both.
I used parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides to lift out the cake (8x8pan). The rest I made as cupcakes. The cupcakes cooked more evenly in less time.

Ok, I have made this a few times and it is truly one of the best chocolate cakes ever. It is so moist. So moist in fact, you may have a bit of a hard time "working" with it, so I do recommend placing the cooled layers in the freezer for a bit (20 min. or so) before frosting and filling. This will make it much easier!

I decided to make this into a bundt.  I used a silicone bundt pan & baked the cake for 45 min.  I also added a 1/4 cup of Kirsch (cherry liqueur) to the batter instead of the vanilla extract.  My husband (who is rather picky about cakes) loved this.  I'll be making this one again!
UPDATE:  I have made this one dozens of times since & I've added pretty much every liqueur to it.  I've also made this into a two layer w/ seedless raspberry jam in the middle and a buttercream frosting.  Heaven!

This cake is so, so moist and tasty. I frosted the cake with yellow frosting (I used food coloring) and then made black sugar bats all over the cake. I have a bat cookie cutter, so I placed it on the cake in several postions, and sprinkled black sugar within the cutter. I used little, round, red candies for the eyes. It looks like black bats flying in front of a full moon!

I made this cake for a birthday and it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it.  It does require the entire 40 minutes to bake even though the toothpick came out clean after 30 min.  It was a little hard to get out of the pan and did fall apart easily, but it was so good that if you are gentle with it, its well worth it. VERY TASTY!!!

For those that have given this a low rating i have to ask...are you sure its not just you.  this is absolutely fabulous.  I made it for my son's 8th bday with the chocolate icing found on the berry glazed chocolate cake recipe on this site.  Everyone at the party (the adults especially) asked for the recipe.  Most are not cake fans but even my dad said it was so good he finished the cake before his ice cream.  I will make this over and over again--in fact I am making cupcakes today.  MMMM!  ***I forgot to add that we don't drink coffee so I used Mexican Stephens Hot Cocoa instead and it gave it a nice flavor- I imagine you could use any flavored hot chocolate and it would add a nice flavor.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla - I am sure you could use different flavoring too.  I love this recipe.  ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I have made this several times since my first time and was even asked to bring it to my sisters 30th birthday-her request.  It is the best cake recipe- I make bundt cakes and sprinkle powdered sugar and I make mini bundts and cupcakes- time is a little over half the time as a cake- 20-25 minutes.  they melt in your mouth.  This time I didn't have milk so I added powdered with the dry and water with 1 tbsp vinegar.  It was fabulous I won't make another.  UPDATE: ok so I have made this again for the umteenth time and it turns out great everytime. I have used Pero in place of coffee and the satiny chocolate glaze is amazing...

Okay, this is definately a "throw together and toss in oven" success! Very easy, very moist, very popular!!! I made coffee butter frosting to go with but, you almost don't need frosting at all. Needed to cook for the whole 40 minutes.

Wow! Amazing recipe! I used the batter to make cupcakes, and they turned out wonderfully; so moist and chocolatey. I followed the recipe exactly, and took another reviewer's tip to put the batter in a spouted measuring cup, which made filling the cupcake cups easier. The recipe yielded 24 medium-sized cupcakes, and took exactly 22 minutes at 350F to bake. I watched them closely, and even though they looked a little shiny on top, they were cooked through - so they can be deceiving! If making cupcakes, do not fill the cups more the 2/3rds, as they rise pretty well. They kept well in an air-tight container for at least 3 days. Overall, a delicious, wonderful recipe that I am sure I will use again and again!

I rarely EVER write reviews on any recipes but felt this was the BEST cake I've ever made or have eaten! Have been a professional baker/cake decorator for 14 years and have made my share of cakes. Don't substitute anything in the ingredients! DO either use parchment, or generously grease your pans. Also the suggestion of placing the cake in the freezer for a bit for ease of handling is recommended. I've always "worked" with a partially frozen cake to make decorating easier. I used bakers one bowl frosting to which I added about 2 TBSP cocoa for a more intense chocolate flavor but this cake stands chocolaty enough on it's own and NEEDS nothing!

I made the Black Magic Cake last night and was happy with the results.  Now, for the bakers who posted & had miserable results with "raw" batter, impossibly stuck cake bottoms - there is nothing more frustrating than following a new recipe exactly and having it NOT turn out! Two suggestions: 1) coat pans with flour/grease AND cover bottom of pans with good ol' wax paper to eliminate sticking.  2) For the batter that never bakes (raw), the culprit  is your oven temperature.  The oven temp. display might read "350 degrees", but inside the oven might only be 300 degrees (my case). Even though my oven is new,  I bought an inside oven thermometer - for inside temp to be at 350, I must set the outside display at 375. . .  I do hope this helps.  Keep Baking!

My youngest son and I used this recipe to make chocolate cupcakes together. We made no changes or substitutions. We didn't actually get 24 cupcakes out of this recipe, we got 18. We baked our cupcakes in greased cupcake liners at 350* and they were done at exactly 22 minutes. The cupcakes really baked up beautifully. High and they looked like bakery cupcakes right out of the oven and they kept their shape even as they cooled--NO FALLING! I was quite impressed with that. We frosted them with a canned frosting (I know, but it was his request). My husband, kids, aunt and cousin all give double thumbs up. GREAT recipe.......even for cupcakes. My oldest boy says "just the right amount of chocolate goodness!" I'm SO using this recipe again.

No idea how anyone can fail to be impressed with this easy, perfect cake. It's the standard by which all should be judged, the quintessential American-style chocolate cake. The flavor is robust, with a depth and complexity owing to the coffee. Just as an aside, I detest coffee, but no problem, because you never taste it in this cake. The taste does not even have so much as a hint of mocha, only chocolate. If you are a chocolate fanatic, Dutch process cocoa increases that quotient. When doing so, you can cut back the soda to 1-1/2 tsp, because Dutch process cocoa is pre-alkalized. Success is ensured by sifting your flour to aerate, and mixing as little as possible, just to incorporate everything until smooth. Remember that the more you work your batter after adding the flour, the greater gluten formation you encourage. Gluten is the protein in the flour that gives baked goods structure. It contributes the opposite of tenderness. As an example, it's what gives yeast doughs their elasticity. That's something you don't want here, so mix as little as possible after adding the flour, and the result will be an exquisitely soft cake that just melts in your mouth. I find the best complement to this cake to be Italian meringue buttercream that just increases that meltingly soft quality. Truly the best you can make.

This is a pretty good chocolate cake.  It's moist and flavorful. Very similar to the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" on this site.  I didn't have buttermilk so I soured regular milk by adding 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the milk.  I made this into a "candy barrel" cake for Halloween.  I baked the cake in two 9-inch round pans for 35 minutes and cut off the tops to make them even.  I put a very thin layer of frosting between the layers and then frosted the outside and top.  I placed 22.5 (45 wafers) snack size Kit Kat bars around the outside and poured a 10.5 oz. bag of Reese's Pieces on top.  I finished it off by tying a ribbon around the outside.

Soooo good and surprisingly easy. Cake was moist and super satisfying. Baked in a greased and "floured" (I used cocoa) bundt cake pan for 45 mins and it came out perfect.  For the frosting I melted semi-sweet chocolate with a little butter and drizzled it over the top then placed it in the fridge to cool.  Fantstic cake, adding a picture :)

WOW! This cake is deliciously moist, and full of chocolate flavor.  My kids and I are self-admitted cake snobs, but this cake meets our high standards.  The cake is "sticky" once baked, so I can imagine that it wouldn't make the best cupcakes (if using liners) as most of it would be wasted by sticking to the liners.  However, it makes a scrumptious cake.  I always use Wilton cake magic to grease my pan, and have never had a problem with a cake sticking.  However, this cake stuck slightly even with that.  Therefore, grease your pan liberally, and dust with cocoa (this way your cake doesn't have a white powder film).  We ate the cake without frosting and enjoyed every bite.  I am not a coffee drinker and can taste the "strength" of the coffee coming through.  I think next time I will just use boiling water, as I think coffee leaves a slight bitter aftertaste for non-coffee drinkers like me (I didn't notice this on the first day).  One last note, it's been 4 days since baking the cake, it has not been frosted but stored in Tupperware, and it's as moist and fresh as the first day we baked it.

This was really good but quite frankly, not the best I've ever had. Moist yes, tasty yes, but a recipe I will mention to friends and family? Nope.  I didn't have buttermilk so I just made my own by adding 1 tablespoon of vinegar to my liquid measuring cup, then added milk until I had the specific amount of milk called for. Let it sit for 10 minutes, stirred, and voila! Homemade buttermilk. To make strong coffee I added 1 c of water (measured in a liquid measuring cup) to my coffeemaker (which is 2 cups according to the coffeemaker) and added 3 Tbls of coffee. I let it cool, then added it to the ingredients. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl while beating so everything is mixed well. You will need to bake the full 40 minutes, and the batter will be very thin, thin like water so don't be alarmed. When you remove from the pans, be SURE to line the racks with parchment paper or you will lose half of your cake on the rack! I frosted with a chocolate buttercream.

Well I feel the extreme need to find whoever posted this and shake their hand because after making this cake I am sure I will never use another chocolate cake recipe ever again.  It was almost like a giant moist brownie, it was absolutely perfect.  I have been avoiding making desserts with chocolate cake in them because I have never been a fan (always too dry, not chocolatey enough, etc) but this recipe has changed everything.  I iced it with a coffee icing and it was just to die for.  Thank you so very much for posting this recipe, it was fabulous.

Super good moist cake!!!! I did use hazelnut cream strong brew coffee and followed the "rules" of high altitude baking, shhhhhhhhhhhh took a few bites out of the bottom of one of the layers for granpas bday cake, taste tested this and its AWESOME and sooooo moist!!!! The crumb and texture is amazing!!! I always make my cakes the night before (in silicone pans) I need them, cool, then put in the freezer overnight. That way they are easy to remove from the pan and also do not require such a meticulous crumb coat (learned this from working in a bakery where all of our cakes were decorated while still frozen). I had no issues with my cakes falling in the middle as I do with some other recipes.

I have this recipe and it's one of my favorites! One day I didn't have any buttermilk nor vinegar to make sour milk to substitute.  Instead I used yogart and it was even better if you can believe that!!

I also got this recipe off the Hershey's cocoa can, around 1970-1972.  I got a blue ribbon at the fair with this cake! I recommend if your hands are shakey that you put your pan on the oven rack, then pour in the cake batter.  It's thin, and if you're not steady it can slop on the sides.

I used French Roast from Starbucks Coffee for the one cup of strong brewed coffee called for in the recipe. I followed the recipe to a “T”. The batter was easy to make and I noticed that it appeared runny and liquidy. I filled each cupcake 2/3 full and baked 21 cupcakes at 350 degrees for 22 minutes. The cupcakes rose up forming a nice round top while a chocolate-y aroma filled up my house. I let them cool completely for about an hour. It was wonderfully moist, spongy, dark colored with a rich chocolate flavor.  The coffee enhances the chocolate flavor nicely. I couldn’t taste the coffee at all and would have never known it was in there. I love that this recipe includes buttermilk as it almost always guarantees a tender cake and veg oil helps produce the signature moistness. I frosted these with, “Rich Chocolate Frosting,” also from this website. It was a perfect match! I even topped the frosting with Halloween icing decorations (See my picture). I made these for my teenager and his friends to share at the Halloween school dance tonight. Needless to say it was a hit.

Made this for my friend's birthday with mocha frosting ... RAVE reviews. Did not change one thing about this recipe. I'd recommend not using a mixer, though ... the cake batter is so thin that it sloshed everywhere and got all over my shirt. A whisk would be fine.

So, so good. Magical, in fact.

When I read the reviews for this recipe one thing I saw over and over was how moist this cake is...boy are they right this cake is MOIST in a big way. I now have a new favorite chocolate cake recipe, I can't say how many compliments I got on this cake. The coffee amplifies the chocolate flavor nicely while the buttermilk tenderizes and veg oil helps produce the signature moistness. I did have to bake it longer than suggested though so do keep an eye out for that and tip to anyone who doesn't happen to have buttermilk in the fridge or doesn't want to purchase it just for one recipe, just add 1 tbs of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup milk or plain yogurt and voila!

What a great pleasure to find this recipe posted, true to the original ingredients! 

In 1985 I first found this recipe on the old fashioned cans of Hershey's Cocoa, back when one had to use a screwdriver to pop off the lid. The can was in the pantry of an older woman who had saved the empty container from years back. How times have changed. 

This is an excellent cake that is unbelievably moist. I've made it on many occasions over the years, turning out so well each time that several people have doubted I actually made it. It is that delicious. 

For those experiencing difficulties such as sinking and sticking, I would be curious to find, perhaps in a poll, how many used true buttermilk vs. vinegar + milk, as well as results for anyone who used chilled coffee, room temperature coffee, or hot coffee. Just a thought. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have been making this cake for over 25 years and this by far is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. But, you must follow the recipe exactly. Do not make any substitutions.  Also, sift the dry ingredients before adding to mixture.  If you do this, you will have a great cake.  It is the cake my husband requests every year for his birthday.  And it is gone by the next day. :) !!!!

I am gluten intollerant and I have used this recie for years to make the BEST chocolate cake.
I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I use ONLY the gluten free pantry flour (french bread and pizza mix flour).I also switch the baking soda to 1 tsp and the baking powder to 2 tsp. People who can eat wheat even gobble this cake up when I make it! My favorite chocolate frosting recipe came from this site.  It's your chocolate fudge buttercream.  I use Dove's  dark chocolate ice cream topping in the Rx to make it really sinfull!

A nice, moist chocolate cake. Flavor was a bit bland. I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and used soy milk with 1 T. vinegar instead of the buttermilk. It bakes quickly so keep an eye on it.

After reading all the great reviews for this cake, I wanted to  make some cupcakes for a bridesmaid party, and they were a catastrophe. About 20 mins into baking, they puffed up and overspilled all over the cupcake sheet, and then deflated. I ended up with a  cake in the shape of a cupcake sheet, and the cake had a bitter after taste. I didn't substitute any ingredients and everything was within expiration date. Not sure what happened with this one...

I baked this last night.  Am only giving it a one star because guys at work said it tasted good.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  It sank in the middle and was very crisp around the edges.  Definitely will never make again!  Actually threw the recipe away that I printed.

This recipe is heaven sent! Followed it exactly except i did not have buttermilk or regular milk so i put 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in a cup of soy milk and 5 minutes later i had dairy free buttermilk! This cake was extremely moist and didn't have a bitter coffee taste. The coffee only enhanced the chocolate so you wouldn't even know it was in there which i was thankful for! I can never get a cake out successfully with my old cake pans so i foiled them & buttered and flowered them and the baked cakes came out with out the slightest of problem. This cake was amazing and i was so proud to bring my dad (the chocolate cake king) over a huge hunk of it! He said he's never tried a cake so moist! Not even store bought =] Thank you so much for this recipe! Will definitely make again & again.

I’m sorry to say, but this is was one of the worst cakes that I have ever made
The cake stuck to bottom ad sides, and took an extra 20 minutes to cook. The center was still goo, yet the outsides had been burned.
It was a complete waste of the ingredients

Loved this cake! I have made it twice now. It has such a rich dark chocolate flavor. My only suggestions is to use a good quality cocoa because it really makes a difference and line your pan with parchment paper. The cake is so moist it falls apart easily and is hard to get out of the pan. But by far the best homemade chocolate cake I've had!

OMG!!!  This is wonderful!  It's light, flavorful, and perfectly moist.  The hubby has pronounced it his favorite cake ever.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa for the cocoa (the cake is really rich and black).  I also used a packet of instant Columbian Starbucks in a cup of hot water for the coffee.  I've made both cake and cupcakes which have turned out wonderful with this recipe.  For cupcakes, bake about 22 minutes (but still do the toothpick test to be sure).  I'm so happy that I'll never have to resort to the box again. 
We're still debating frosting options (even though we both agreed we can eat the cake by itself)... Which frosting did the rest of you use?

This is a super cake that really comes out perfect and full of great flavor. My only suggestion is NOT to beat for 2 minutes as you could over beat and the cake will sink when baking...I have made it a few times and I mix only until all is blended then I stop, pour the mixture into the pans and pop them into the oven...they rise perfectly and fluffy. As for cupcakes they also come out great;)

Super moist. I'm so happy with this recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted it with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and filled it up to one cup with milk.

I was a bit nervous about adding coffee, but my fears proved unfounded as the coffee was unnoticeable.

Excellent cake! No tweaking, just as it is written. I made this twice now, once for my daughter's teacher for her going away maternity party and the teachers kept the leftovers for the teacher's room, we didn't get it back, lol. I tripled the recipe and made three tiers, it was divine. After that I had to make it for my family because we knew how well it went at our local school. You must try it. Moist and tasty, it's really good. Just make sure the coffee is strong, that's where the magic is.

This cake came out very good- Not super sweet, a good "grown-up" chocolate cake.  I made a whipped peanut butter frosting and it was quite good.  All it needed was a glass of milk!

This cake was absolutely amazing, perfectly moist and the coffee seems to really have brought out the taste of the chocolate.Everyone thought it was a dark chocolate cake even though it was just cocoa powder. The changes I made were:
1. Used 1.5 cups of sugar- 1 cup white and 0.5 cup brown sugar.
2. Used 3 tsps of instant coffee dissolved in 1 cup water.
3. Used 2% milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk.
I filled and topped the cake with a dark chocolate ganache using the recipe for this site. Absolutely divine, this cake goes down well with some vanilla ice cream.

What I can I say?  This cake has got me flabbergasted!!  It was moist, had the perfect sweetness, and it was SCRUMDIDLYUMPCIOUS.  It was really cool to make something this wonderful.  I made 12 cupcakes with 1/2 the recipe.  Since I don't really drink a lot of coffee, I simply microwaved 1/2 a cup of water and a little bit over a teaspoon of instant coffee for a minute and a half.  It only took 15 minutes to bake it in the oven and it was astounding to see the quick, beautiful, and tasty results.  I paired it with some dark chocolate ganache and my whole family absolutely LOVED it.

Although the cake looks dark chocolate, it was not as rich as I thought it would be. But it was very moist and easy, and still tasted great! I had no issues with sticking because I greased and floured the pan. I used ganache to top my cake.  **I had given this a 4 start last night. But I had a slice today and it is so good! Not sure if it made a difference from having the slice warm vs cold. But the chocolate flavor was much more rich the next day with a cold slice. I will be making this cake for a birthday cake I am doing soon.

A note to anyone wanting to use 9-inch cake pans--this recipe makes THREE pans, not two.  Thankfully I read the reviews, noting the multiple complaints about the pans overflowing when they baked, hence I divided the batter between three 9-inch cake pans lined with parchment paper.  They baked beautifully to the top of the pan.  Make sure you do the toothpick test to test for doneness--if the cake isn't baked all the way through, the center will collapse.  Mine were ready at 27 minutes.  I measured carefully, and while the batter was slightly thinner than boxed cake batter, it wasn't overly runny.  The cake is moist, the flavor is perfectly chocolate, and if anything it gets better the next day!  This will be my go-to cake recipe from now on.

My adult daughter made this at my suggestion when we were expecting a special guest. What a disaster! The cake overflowed the pan all over the oven. We ended up making a trifle type dessert with what we could salvage. She insists she followed the recipe exactly. My advice - try this one out first before you try it on company.

This was a pretty good, rich chocolate cake.  I used a good baking soda, but it could still be tasted, so I will scale that back a bit next time.  I sprayed my pans like crazy and  put a circle of baking paper on the bottom and had no trouble with sticking.  I did not frost this cake as it was rich enough, just filled with some caramel fudge and dusted with icing sugar.  My mom group loved this and didn't believe me that it wasn't super high in fat.

Made this as a cake, exactly as directed.  Cake would not leave pan, and made an ugly mess.  Thankfully the frosting hid most of it, but it didn't come out anything like any other from-scratch cake I've ever made.  Tried again a month later with cupcakes, and they sunk.  There's something not quite 100% right with this recipe.  No matter how good it tastes, this is too much hassle for not enough "magic".  I'll be going back to my old cake recipe.

I really liked this cake - it was super moist and tasty. My only complaint is that it was so moist the the bottom stuck to the pan and I was forced to make a thinner layer cake. I'm not sure if cooking it longer like other reviews said would have helped or not...

Really, really good!  Watch the baking time closely, because it doesn't take long to go from "almost there" to "done".  This cake is a little bit denser than some cakes, such as a boxed mix, but quite nice and moist.  Made this with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from Amy Via on this site (I halved the frosting recipe).  No changes needed for the cake recipe!

A perfect cake for a novice baker.  Easy & stright forward.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added a tbsp vingar to the cup of milk and let it sour for 5min.  It didnt puff up in the middle, making it easy to shape.  I used a square tin and a glass round pan(was making a heart shaped cake)  the tin pan was done in 30 min, while the glass was done in 40min.  Make sure to cool in pans for 10min or longer if not it will fall part.  A piece broke off the bottom but with a spatula and some care, was able to fit it back and it formed together while on the cooling rack.

ok, I make packaged cakes all the time and am never really please with the lack of the chocolate taste in the cake.  I made this cake in a 9x13 loaf pan, cut it down the middle (after freezing it for a while, this cake is so moist it falls apart).  I spread chocolate mousse in the center (1 small chocolate instant pudding, 1 cup milk, 1 cup heavy cream, mix, chill and then spread evenly on cake center).  And then added the cream cheese frosting from this site and had the most incredible chocolate cake that I have ever tasted.  Not the easiest cake to decorate since it is so moist, but well worth it cause the taste is out this world.  I

This was good, but not as moist as I wanted it to be.  The only thing I did differently was to sub milk & a touch of vinegar for the buttermilk, as I realized I did not have buttermilk.  I usually love chocolate cakes made w/coffee, so I was looking forward to trying it (plus, PJ on the RE is a fan of this cake, so that's an endorsement I respect!).  It's a good cake and I'll try it again to see if it was user error that made it not quite as moist as I'd like it to be.

This cake came out great for me. Baked up perfectly in 30 minutes. It's moist and has a great texture. I used strawberry jam between the layers and coffee buttercream for the top. It's fantastic.

This cake turned out GREAT! I made it for a Potluck and everyone loved it! It was gone before really fast. I used an Oreo Cream Cheese Frosting (Cream Cheese Frosting mixed with Oreo Cookie Crumbs) on it and it turned out great. Everyone said that it tasted like a bakery cake! It was just right! :D I would ABSOLUTELY recommend it to anyone! It was SO easy to make! I will post a picture.

this was just a disappointment. someone else mentioned that when they bake a cake from scratch, it should taste like it, and i agree. this didn't even really taste like a cake mix; it lacked a rich flavor and had a very spongy texture. i even took the cake from my house to my parents, and in the end, we just threw it away with 3/4 of it left. i consider myself a good cook, and i am pretty surprised so many people have enjoyed it, honestly. i won't make this again.

I assembled the cake properly, just as the recipe specified. This recipe called for 2 9-inch cake pans, mine ended up filling 3 pans and overflowing in the oven. We had to buy a new oven due to smoke damage. When I pulled the cakes (3!!!!!) out of the oven, they looked perfect except for falling in the center; I wasn't too worried about this given that I am an experienced baker in a working kitchen and was planning on frosting the cake later. When I attempted to remove the cakes from their pans, all 3!!!!!!! cakes fell apart almost completely. Again, being an experienced baker, I thought I could still manage this issue with covering the crumbs in frosting. After making the frosting, I stacked the cakes with frosting in between. Within 2 minutes, the cakes had split down the middle and collapsed completely. Crying, I tried to shove the cakes back to a recognizable shape, but they only disintegrated at the touch of my spatula. At this point, I was sobbing, as the cake was to be served within an hour. I was forced to dump the chocolatey mess into the mixing bowl and I am about to serve this concoction to a crowd of my closest friends. How will my reputation be damaged? Only time will tell.

Tasted really good. Frosted with chocolate cream frosting like another reviewer did. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1 cup milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar. Let sit for about five minutes so it can curdle and you're good.

I read most of the reviews and was a little scared by some who didn't like it.  But since it came so highly recommended i tried it anyways.  It was PERFECTION! I topped it with whipped chocolate ganache and then poured about a cup of liquid ganache.  I also used a strawberry filling between the layers.  So moist and the chocolate flavor was mild and not to overpowering.  The combo of strawberry, chocolate ganache and this cake was amazing... i have friends telling me to open a bakery now! lol Don't be scared to try this recipe!!! it was so easy and it turned out moist and just overall AMAZING!!! LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE!!! Happy baking!! ^_^

This cake was super easy as well as super yummy. Me and a couple of friends (all very basic cookers) were able to pull this off. Between my three friends and I and two parents this cake was gone within two hours. It is a very moist and rich cake so remember to serve with a big glass of milk.

I don't think I will ever make a cake from a box again! This was the best chocolate cake I've ever had! I frosted it with a toasted coconut icing and decorated with additional toasted coconut. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it! I brought some to work with me the next day and now they want me to make another one to bring in! The cake alone is really good - and with the toasted coconut icing it is heavenly!!!

I thought this was a great cake. Dark and moist with a slight coffee flavor. I say slight because I made some STRONG coffee :-) Frosted it with coffee frosting and  a dulce de leches filling.  Was a bit much batter for 2 9-inch pans so I will probably use 3 next time. But there WILL be a next time!

I really wish I could give this more stars, but it didn't live up to expectations. I do, however, believe that I can share some things NOT to do.

First, don't cut the sugar. I almost always use less sugar than is called for in a recipe because they're often too sweet. Not the case here. I used about 5/6 cup organic cane sugar and a cup of brown sugar, but not hard packed. The recipe needs the full 2 cups of sugar.

I cooked the cake for 40 minutes, but didn't check it at 30 (which I should have done) - the texture was ok, but not as moist as some other reviewers have indicated. I recommend checking the cake at 30 minutes because every oven is different.

The saving grace of the cake was the Coffee Butter Frosting (also from this site), which added the missing sweetness. And the frosting complemented the cake very well.

Hopefully I will get the opportunity to make this again and update my review.

Very good chocolate cake, one of the best out there.  Make sure your pans are greased and floured well or your cake will stick, also make sure they are cool before removing from the pan.  I tend to make this and then refrigerate overnight before removing from the pans.  For the coffee, I'll save a cup from my morning pot and then add 4 TBSP of instant to the 1 cup or regular strength coffee.

I have been making this cake for nearly 30 years.  It is absolutely the best chocolate cake ever.  I make this cake for my husband's birthday, Father's Day, our anniversary, and many holidays in between.  I frost it with a chocolate frosting recipe from Hershey that is delicious.  I have also made this cake fat free by substituting ingredients with egg beaters, skim milk and applesauce for the oil.  I top it with fat free cool whip.  The texture is different but it is one delicious fat free cake.

Looks good, but had a bad aftertaste.  
Followed the recipe.  Did'nt bother me that the cake was nice and dark....practically black.  Unusual that the middle was sunken after baking.  Most store bought cake mixes don't do this.  My son tasted the cake and found it displeasing.  I tried it, and didn't care for it, some very weird aftertaste.  I don't recommend this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! This cake is so moist and chocolatey. I do not recommend using this cake for stacking. I made a 6 tiered cake and this cake was way too soft.

Awesome cake. And so easy to make. No electric mixer needed. I love this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. I made this now several times and today I didn't have buttermilk so I just used sour cream. And they (I made cupcakes) turned out soooo good.

I was so excited to make this cake after reading all the positive reviews &with such a great rating! &I thought "Oh, surely a homeade cake has to be better than a box cake". I hate box cake. Yet, I found box cakes to be better, somehow. I thought I left something, but nope. I followed these to a tee. It tasted almost sour like.

This is really similar to my mom's chocolate cake recipe that she's been making since I was about 5.  The difference is that her recipe calls for water, and this one calls for brewed coffee.  This recipe with the coffee has a much richer flavor!  Sshhh....don't tell mom, but I like this one better.  For those of you concerned, you cannot taste the coffee AT ALL.  It simply makes the chocolate flavor stand out more.  I use a cream cheese frosting on top (one brick of cream cheese, 1/2-3/4 stick of softened butter, and at least half a 16oz bag of powdered sugar (stop when it's sweet enough for your taste).  if you need any liquid add vanilla by the drop!  you don't need much liquid).  Anyway, I am making this cake from now on. :)

It didn't turn out the way I expected, maybe because I used espresso coffee as the strong coffee.  That ruined the recipe.

Really 4.5 stars.  Very good recipe.  Cake has a great texture and is very moist.  My only comment is that is wasn't quite chocolately enough, even though it seemed like there was plenty of cocoa powder.  I think I might try decreasing the coffee next time (to 3/4 or 1/2 cup), in hope of making the cake a bit sweeter and letting the chocolate shine through a bit more.  But still, this is the best chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch, and it's as good in texture and moisture as any boxed cake mix.  Thanks!

Okay this is my very 1st review on this site...and it's because this cake is AMAZING.  Don't let the negative comments scare you.  I am an average cook and if I can do this~ Anyone can.  It made 26 cupcakes.  Delicious, everyone in my family LOVED them.  Super moist and a texture I just can't explain.  Cannot wait to make them to take to a party.  Just as others said great with no icing at all, but also fine with it.  In my opinion you can't taste the coffee at all.  Even my picky 13 year old son couldn't taste it.  AWESOME RECIPE..KEEPER..baked them at 350 for 17 min and perfection.

Fantastic recipe. I dislike coffee but it made the cake the perfect consistency. Everyone asked for the recipe afterwards. Went perfect with a chocolate frosting and I added milano cookies on top as gravestones and iced "RIP" over the face of each one. Perfect for Halloween!

A wonderful chocolate cake! I had some buttermilk in the frig that needed to be used and this fit the bill perfect. Easy to make, moist, keeps for days, what more could we want?? It makes me sad..I had to give half of it away to some friends, we just can't eat desserts like we used to..I guess thats a good thing!!  lol Seriously, if you want a really good chocolate cake this is your recipe.

I've never rated a recipe before but my GOODNESS, this is some good freakin' cake.  I baked as cupcakes and they only took about 16 minutes to be baked through. I frosted some with vanilla frosting and the other with chocolate. TO DIE FOR! I brought to work and every single person that had one came up to me and said, "Oh, my god." Make this cake, you'll be happy you did!!

This cake was awesome. Hands down the most moist cake I ever made. My only advice would be is to bake on parchment paper because even though I greased the pans well, the cake is very delicate and it stuck to the bottom. I actually put it in the freezer for about an hour so I could ice it. I used the creamy chocolate frosting (my favorite) from this site, and it was perfect. Also I have always steered away from cakes with coffee because I don't drink it, and now I realize I have been missing out. It didn't taste like coffee, just the richest chocolate. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this cake several times, and it's always turned out great. It's really moist and keeps well for a few days. The last time I made it, I added a dash of cinnamon and that was good, but it's great just the way it is. Definitely my go-to recipe for chocolate cake.

PERFECT! The cake was so moist and delicious. I filled it with caramel frosting and topped it with a chocolate ganache. I loved that my family hates coffee, but they all raved about the cake... hahaha their faces were priceless when i informed them about the coffee. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 cup of 1% yogurt instead.  It worked well and the cake was moist.  I baked into cupcakes and they were ready in 20 minutes.
UPDATE Aug 2011: I remade this cake (again with yogurt instead of buttercream) with a filling of pastry cream and glazed with chocolate ganache (both from this website).  It was a hit at my dinner party and upgraded my rating to 5 stars!

Wow!!!  I was a little afraid to make this cake because quite a few reviewers talked about how soft and difficult to work with it is.  But it turned out PERFECT for me - first try!  It is VERY moist, so my husband loved it, and so did everyone else!  I didn't think there was a lot of flavor, but it was super easy to make, super moist, and it baked up beautifully.  I will make this again and again.  I made it in a bundt pan and baked for exactly 45 minutes.  Used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze for the top which was perfect.  The cake lasted about a day and a half, and as soon as it was gone, my family started requesting I make it again.  Thank you for such a wonderful submission!!

I loved this cake.  Makes WONDERFUL cupcakes.  I used 2 packs of Starbucks Via instant coffee in 1 cup hot water and it gave a very nice 'mocha' flavor, and I also added cinnamon to half the batch.  We then added the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting to the top and it was perfect :)  Made 24 perfect cupcakes using my large pampered chef scooper.

I have made this cake since I was a small child. Definitely a fave! Usually I use 1 tsp of vinegar and 1 cup of milk combined instead of the buttermilk. I also recommend adding almond extract for a deeper flavor.

This was fantastic! I made it exactly as written and I cooked mine in a 9x13 pan. Mine sunk in the middle a bit, so I don't know what that was about, but it still tasted awesome!! I frosted it with peanut butter frosting...yum :)

SO good, SO moist! I didn't do a thing differently except to use milk + lemon juice in place of buttermilk. Other than that, made it exactly as written (except maybe adding a scootch more vanilla). I was hoping for a coffee taste to come through in the finished product, and even though there wasn't, there was a very nice, rich chocolate flavour and that's certainly nothing to complain about! Will probably be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on, thanks!

This recipe was no good at all. It didn't taste anything like chocolate, and it stuck to the pan, even though I had greased and floured it. It was a big dissapointment. I had to serve all these broken pieces of cake with a glaze over them. It looked awful.

This cake has been sitting on my counter, slowly disappearing for FOUR days now and I swear it gets better each day.  It's a fast, easy make, moist with a beautiful open texture with some heft to each slice. The flavors get more intense with time and I make this again will let it sit after putting on the Chocolate glaze for at least 24 hours.   Truly a chocolate and coffee lovers delight!

This is THE cake recipe I use for all events. My grandmother handed it down to me and I've been using it ever sense!
The only difference is I use 2tsp instant coffe in 1c. boiling water. This way you don't have to make a whole pot of coffee and you get the same strength coffee each time!

I read the many reviews on this recipe, and decided to try it. It was delicious! I was at first concerned about how liquidy it was, but my concerns were completely unfounded, as it came out perfectly in just under the suggested baking time.  I did have to tweak it a little, as I don't keep buttermilk on hand (Betty Crocker cookbook says emergency sub 1 c. milk + 1 Tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar and let sit per 1 c. buttermilk needed).  I also used vanilla hazelnut flavored coffee--delicious! I topped it with the cinnamon coffee frosting as suggested by so many other reviewers, and even my anti-coffee husband was hooked. Tastes even better the 2nd day too.  I made it again awhile later, and since my hubby was dieting it stuck around my kitchen for a WEEK until my parents came in town at which point it was as moist as the day I made it AND gone by the next morning!

Although the first time I made this cake one of the layer just collapsed (you have to bake it longer than suggested), it was a HUGE hit at a dinner party.  I served it with a raspberry filling, and cream cheese icing.  It is by far the best, most moist chocolate cake recipe I have ever used.

This cake tasted excellent and was very moist for days, but it fell apart very easily.  Even though I followed the directions to a tee, i had to let it cool for an extra half an hour before the cakes would even come out of the pans. When they did come out they cracked, crumbled, and fell apart.  So, make it when you want a yummy treat... not when you're trying to impress anyone.  For an icing i used Bakery Shop Icing which tasted very good, but of course didn't look the greatest with all the crumbled bits in it.  Overall a very tastey dessert.

Very soft and moist, but not gagging sweet like some cakes.  We substituted one cup of dark hot cocoa for the coffee to give the bitterness, absolutely delicious!

First of all- this is IDENTICLE to a recipe from the Barefoot Contessa (Beatty's Chocolate Cake)... having said that, this is a very good cake. Nice and moist without tons of fat, due to the coffee and buttermilk. My boyfriend loved it- said it wasn't too sweet- unlike a lot of cakes. It's a great base for a delicious creamy chocolate frosting.

The cake has a rich dark chocolatey flavour, accentuated by the flavour of the strong brewed coffee. I baked two of these cakes for a charity sale and decorated them with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting from the website. I had customers coming back for seconds, and bringing their friends to buy it too :). Great recipe and not hard to make, thanks!

I scaled the recipe to 36 servings, it made 34 cupcakes with a 1/4 cup scoop. I used Dutch processed cocoa so I had to omit the baking soda and use baking powder for both amounts, this is very important, know what type of cocoa you are using. The cupcakes baked up beautifully with nice domed tops, 18 minutes was perfect in my oven. Frosted with Sweettreats Buttercream frosting.

i was a bit worried about this recipe bec some of the reviews scared me but it turned out beautifully! i followed it to a tee and it was super easy. it was moist without being too spongy or too dense and it was super tasty, not too sweet or chocolaty but just right. some tips for those who thought it was spongy- do not over beat. just beat enough to mix all the ingredients properly. also, many ppl mentioned it was hard to work with but if you use one well greased 9x13 it is just fine (i'd steer clear of cupcakes or layered cakes). i frosted it with the Coffee Butter Frosting and it was perfect. thanks!

I really enjoyed this cake.  I did, however, make a few modifications (half recipe): 1/2 cup water instead of coffee and 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tbs of vinegar instead of buttermilk.  I baked this in regular-sized muffin tins for exactly 20 minutes.  I would probably start checking around 17 minutes though.  Update: I made the cake with buttermilk and I think it was even more moist than the first time I made it.  When I halved the recipe it made six jumbo muffin size cupcakes.  They cooked in approximately 21 minutes.  Update 2:  If making regular size cupcakes, bake for 15-18 minutes.

I made this cake today. I wish the batter was thicker. I made cupcakes from it. I used Kahlua flavored K-cups. Usually, I can't taste coffee in chocolate recipes, but I could in this one. Not sure if I will make it again. This is attempt #2. Recipe has no issues, so I am giving 4 stars.

Great cake - I got my recipe from Food Network- Ina Garten's "Beatty's Chocolate Cake" which is the same recipe  - probably the best chocolate cake you'll ever have.  I like Ina's frosting with it too!

So excellent! I made a few adjustments; substituted 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour for the white; cut the sugar by a half cup (could have gone even more, but I wasn't feeling that daring!) and cut the oil in half.  This was a crowd pleasing, yummy and easy to boot cake!  I will definitely make again.
Oh, I frosted it with cream cheese frosting :)

This was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and the results were delicious! Just a note- I put wax paper on the bottom of the two 9 in. pans, but I didn't spray under the wax paper.  This made part of the cake rip off. So if you use wax paper, make sure to spray underneath! I used this with Rich Chocolate Frosting (1/2 of that recipe). Amazing!

Followed the recipe exactly, twice. Both times the cakes stuck to the pans. Very disappointing when you're making this for someone else. Being a culinary professional, I know how to "grease and flour" a pan so that wasn't the reason for it. Overall, the cake was good, though in several pieces and unable to frost and fill.

Cake was very moist... to moist almost. It fell apart easily, did not hold its shape and the chocolate flavor was not as strong as I hoped.

A huge hit amongst my very picky family. I made this cake with Rick's Special Butter cream frosting and a chocolate ganache with fresh raspberry filling. All 12 family members agreed this was one of the best chocolate cakes they've ever tasted. We are all "foodies" often dining at 5 star restaurants, so that says a lot. This is a keeper recipe!

Best chocolate cake, it was moist and lovely. Used all ingredients as indicated except reduced sugar to 1.5cups. Everyone raved about the cake. Trying it again and again.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  I had to make it twice because we started eating one of the layers as it was cooling.  It worked out well because I ended up with a super tall (and fancy looking) 3 layer cake. I frosted it with a chocolate ganache from this website and it was amazing!  Thanks for sharing.

This cake turned out VERY moist! I am glad the notes indicated that the batter would be thin or I would have been a little concerned.  The taste was very rich but not so rich that you couldn't finish a good sized piece!  I made some chocolate fudge frosting to top it with.  I will absolutely make again.

I've made a lot of cakes in my 40 years on this earth.  More importantly, I've eaten a lot of cake in the past 40 years and I can say without hesitation that this is the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  I used black 9" pans and it only had to cook for 30 mins.  AWESOME recipe!

Oh my was this GOOD!!!!! This was so easy to make without any adjustments!!!! It was moist, super yummy, and my husband LOVED it!! I baked it as a sheet cake for about 34 minutes and topped it with Creamy Chocolate Frosting on this site. My husband could not stop raving about it! Since this is very rich I decided to eat a slice with vanilla bean ice cream and I had to tell my husband to put the cake up because I could not stop eating it!!! Thank you for sharing!!

This was REALLY good. It will definitely be my go to chocolate cake from now on. It was very moist, the texture was great, and so chocolatey!! Mine did not sink in the middle. I used regular instant coffee and let it cool a bit before adding and my own made buttermilk (1 cup milk, 1 TBSP white vinegar). I used a 13 x 9 glass pan and baked it for just over 40 minutes. I used a cream cheese frosting - although whipped cream with cherries would be delicious. This is perfection!!

This was soooooooooooo good.  It is the most moist cake I have ever made.  I used special dark cocoa instead of regular.  WOW!  I frosted it with chocolate ganche on the top and sides and in the middle I added some cream cheese to the ganche and whipped it.  Super chocolatey.  Super wonderful!  I will use this recipe for all of my chocolate cakes!

This cake had too much of a coffee flavor for me, however the rest of the bunch thought it was great.  I made cupcakes and all my cupcakes had a sunken middle, even though they were fully cooked in the centers and were pulling away from the sides of the pan.  I had to pipe extra frosting in the middle to cover where they had sunken in.  (not a bad problem to have, right?) :)  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

If you need a chocolate fix, this is the recipe to try.  I made mine in a bundt pan and topped with mocha ganache.  Maybe next time I will also add chocolate chips to the batter!  Very moist and delicious!

This cake is fantastic!   So moist and chocolaty.  I made this in a bunt pan and it turned out perfect. Doesn't need frosting ether!
I'm a lifetime member of Weight Watchers and this cake has few points.
I will be making this over and over again to satisfy my chocolate cravings.  Thanks so much!

This is a great 'go to' recipe.  It's so easy to make! I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  I baked mine in a tube pan for 40 minutes, turned the oven off and left in for another 5 minutes.  It was perfect.  Thanks Marsha for a great recipe.

It's a good cake recipe, but nothing that knocks your socks off.  The type of coffee you use makes a huge difference.  If you use cheep nasty coffee, that will be your cake.

This is a really good, moist cake. The only downfall I have found is it is a little tender for cupcakes. Still works and tastes great as a cupcake, just doesn't hold together quite as well as some.

I thought this was delicious, very moist.  I made mine into cupcakes and they did sink in the middle, but that always happens to me.  Just made sure I filled the well with frosting.  I topped this with Cinnamon Coffee Icing/frosting from this site.  They were well received.

I've made this cake twice and it is now a family favorite.  The first time I made it for Halloween and decorated it with KitKats as another fellow cook did.  Thanks for the idea!  It was a hit.  The second time that I made it was for my son-in-law's birthday and I split the layers and filled them with peanut butter cream, then topped it with chocolate frosting.  He loved it.  This is a very moist cake, couldn't be easier to make.  It's a keeper!

Great cake and that was with my forgetting to add the oil until the cakes had been in the oven 2 mins. so I pulled them out, adde 1/4 oil to each whisked it right in the pan, then put back in to bake and also eating the cake at room temp.  I like to refrigerate my cakes and eat them cold.

Yummy! Very chocolatey and moist. I frosted this with a mocha icing to compliment the coffee that is in the cake. Served this after a huge assortment of finger foods on Christmas Eve, so don't think that anyone had any real room left for dessert. I do have leftovers though so I will pull it out again and ask the experts what they think of the recipe! Thanks Marsha!

This cake was so simple to make and very delicious! I used Tim Hortons for the coffee and it came out just fantastic. I made this cake for my mom's birthday and filled it with homemade raspberry buttercream frosting and frosted it with Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting from this site. Garnished it with whole raspberries and I'm happy to say it was the best tasting cake I ever made. Very rich, but hey a birthday is only once a year and you deserve the indulgance. Will make this cake again with different frostings etc.

Marsha's Black Magic cake is the most moist and rich-tasting cake I have ever eaten, and super easy to make! My husband is VERY particular about cakes, and this one is his favorite without a doubt!!! I used Starbucks "VIA Ready Brew Italian Roast" for my coffee in this recipe...AWESOME!!!

Fantastic and Easy!  This cake is moist and chocolately.  For those who don't like coffee you can't taste it!  I made cupcakes using this recipe and a chocolate icing from this site as well.  Turned out great!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks!!!!

I made this for a friend's birthday along with the "Heavenly Chocolate Mousse" also on this site as a filling.  Everyone LOVED it.  Turned out perfectly.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I made my own with milk and lemon juice.  I also made an additional 1/2 recipe and made it into a 3 layer cake.  NOTE: The batter was VERY thin, I did not think that it would bake right, but it turned out perfect.

I've made this recipe more than a few times now, because it's excellent! The first few times I made it into layers, and frosted it. Everything about this cake is really nice, from the rich flavor to the moist crumb. The only potential issue is that it sometimes comes out too dense (probably something to do with the kind of flour I use). My reaction to this is to use just a smidge less flour.  I have an oven thermometer, but it still takes longer to bake than 40 minutes. I just check on it with a toothpick, and it turns out awesome.  I just finished making another batch of this into cupcakes. Two things: 1) The batter is so good, it is disappearing before I even bake it. 2) I just plopped frozen cherries into the cupcakes before making them, and it turned out great! Didn't even have to prep them in flour or sugar. Try it!  Cupcakes from this don't even need frosting (although you can indulge in it of course =]). Also, if you're shy about buttermilk, I always sub regular milk with a tbsp of vinegar for it.   Thanks to the creator of this recipe! It's perfect!

I have made this cake more times than I can count, so I thought I would finally review it. It is just amazing. I love the super dark chocolate look and taste this cake has, and how moist it comes out EVERY TIME! I never have buttermilk so I use 1 C 1% milk mixed with 1 TB white vinegar (let sit 5 min). I always use freshly brewed coffee from my mini espresso maker, which makes some strong coffee. I have baked this in both 9" and 8" round pans, and both are fine. Cooking time is longer for the 8" pans, about 40 minutes, while for me the 9" pans are done in 32 - 35 minutes. I have always frosted with a chocolate ganache ... so much delicious chocolate! Highly recommend.

My husband decided he wanted a chocolate cake this year for his birthday instead of his usual (boring) white cake with white frosting, so I set out to find a recipe for the moistest, densest chocolate cake.  This one did not disappoint!  It was the vegetable oil and buttermilk in the ingredient list that sold me initially, then I was intrigued with the addition of the coffee.  (I used decaf...was afraid too much chocolate plus the coffee caffeine would keep me up all night!)  I brought all of the cold ingredients to room temperature prior to getting started, as I do with all cake recipes.  As others have stated, the batter is very thin -  but it bakes beautifully.  Needed about 37 minutes in my oven, then I let the cakes cool in the pans for about 30 minutes before inverting them.  Since I could tell they were super moist cakes, I first placed several paper towels on the racks and then covered them with a piece of wax paper - just to be sure that the moist cake wouldn't fall through the grates on the racks.  I let them cool for about two hours prior to frosting.  Delicious, moist, cake with a deep chocolate flavor - definitely my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

If you are looking for a good, moist, fudgy cake look no further. This was excellent. I made it for and early Valentine's Day for my husband and the first thing he said was "This is how I like my cake". I followed the recipe to a T. I made my own buttermilk using lemon juice/milk substitute and I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Frosting. Thanks so much for a very enjoyable cake!

I found the cake to be a little bitter. Perhaps my coffee was too strong. Also, 40 minutes wasn't long enough, so my cake sunk in the middle. I made this again but I forgot the bake time wasn't long enough and the darn thing sank again!! Grrrr

This cake sure is magic. It's really moist and tastes yummy. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 tbsp vinegar + enough milk to make 1 cup and the result is fantastic. My family loves this recipe.

So two of my friends despise coffee.  Instead of the cup of brewed coffee, I boiled water, placed 3 oz. unsweetened chocolate in a measuring cup, and poured enough water to equal 1 cup and stirred.  The result was magnificent--I don't know how the coffee version tastes, but my version may very well be the best basic chocolate cake I've ever made!

It was a large suprise to me when I saw that there was more sugar than flour. I halved down the sugar and added a tad bit more flour. I also added less butter. For the coffee I addded one and a half teaspoons and mixed them with hot water and milk. Instead of buttermilk I simply mixed some melted butter with a tad of milk. The cake mixture was thin but the cake itself turned out deliciously, everyone loved it.

I used this recipe for my husband's 50th birthday cake and it was delicious.  As full as we all were from dinner, no one left a crumb of cake on their plates.  I'm glad it was noted that the batter would be thin or I would have been worried.    I was unable to find buttermilk in any stores so I used the old vinegar in milk trick to make some.

Unbelievable!!  This recipe is almost identical to a recipe I got from a cooking school, except for a difference in the coffee.  Their recipe calls for *hot* coffee, and they don't add the coffee to the batter until the end.  They pour the prepared batter over the hot coffee, stir it together, then pour into the pan and bake.  I topped it with "Cinnamon Coffee Frosting" found on this site.  Big hit!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This cake is surprisingly moist and flavorful for a cocoa powder cake.  It is very easy to make and work with, and especially magical when filled with chocolate custard and frosted with a rich orange-scented ganache.  Thanks!

I think this cake is simply unbelievable for those of you that get those absolutely wicked desires for a piece of chocolate! It's very moist and goes down great with a tall ice-cold glass of milk!  MMmmmmMMmmm

I used a little bit more than half the sugar because I wanted the cake to be more chocolate and less sweet. I came out awesome...

I WILL NEVER BUY A BOX OF DEVILS FOOD CAKE AGAIN. This is the best recipe for chocolate cake I've tried. I have tried the coffee trick with mixes and other recipes, but hands down this is #1. I can see this cake becoming the one my family request for generations to come.

Oh my goodness--the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made in my life!  This is my first review and very much needed to rave about this amazing cake!  I made it for one of my Thanksgiving desserts and it was loved by everyone.  I will be making it again this weekend for my son's birthday party and again and again whenever I want an amazing chocolate cake.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Since I read the cake is very moist, I purchased one of those cheap foil baking pans at the store (a lasagna pan since the pan came with a lid) and when the cake was done, I left it in the pan, let it cool and put icing on so no need to transfer the cake.  Everyone cut into the cake right from the pan and served themselves, worked great!
UPDATE:  Two years later and I'm returning to this for Thanksgiving dessert on Thursday to get the ingredients!  I love this cake! (fIrst review was in 2014)

There's a reason this recipe has a 5 star rating with over 1400 reviews, it's THAT good.  I made it as written with the exception of substituting almond milk (soured with 2 tbs of lemon juice) for the buttermilk out of necessity due a  lactose intolerance. Also, instead of using flour to prepare my cake pan, I greased it and then dusted it with cocoa powder so I didn't get any ugly white residue on my beautiful dark chocolate cake.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch pan and it was completely done in 35 minutes. Frosted it with a coffee frosting from this site (subbing butter flavored Crisco for the butter) for a sinfully delicious, yet lactose free dessert.  AMAZING.

This was a great chocolate cake. I have tried several with cocoa powder and was never happy. This one was great. I subbed melted butter for the oil, and also used a few melted ounces of super dark chocolate. It helped cool the butter down (Melted it in the butter) and gave a little extra oomph to the cake. I just happened to have it around, but I don't think next time I would make an extra trip to the store if I was going to make the cake. 

The cake is very rich, and buttercream is just too sweet. I decided to make a vanilla whipped cream for it instead, and stabilized it with a little powdered milk. I shaved a little bit more of the dark chocolate over the top of it. It was beautiful, and gone in less than a day. Will definitely make it again!

Love this recipe. Easy and wonderfully moist. I top with dark chocolate or milk chocolate frosting made with cocoa powder and it is quite rich. It has become the cake of choice for family birthdays.

I have used this recipe  so many times and everyone I have made it for has loved it. I  always bump up the baking powder to two teaspoons and it rises better. I love that its a forgiving and easy recipe. This is truly an awesome chocolate cake!

Sinfully delicious! I needed simplicity, so I made this in a bundt pan, cooking for 40 min. I heeded the advice of others and spray/floured it generously - did coat the pan in cocoa, but go paranoid it would render the greasing null and void, so I sprayed it again. Froze it overnight once baked, as others suggested, had to let it sit out a while before it would pull away from the pan, but it turned out great. SOOO yummy! Used Satiny Chocolate Glaze on it, and filled the hole in the middle with strawberries - looked fabulous! Few girls passed on trying it, only b/c it seemed to be TOO much chocolate for their taste (is there such a thing?) so may want to try another glaze for fun next time (white choc or coffee?)

This is my favourite "go to" recipe when a cake is required.  In fact in our area, I have gained quite a reputation by baking this for others.  I add 1/4 cup more flour or cocoa and it seems to give it a bit better texture.....still very moist and yummy.  We are in the maple syrup business, and I take this to our camp to boost the troups moral....it works every time !!!!

YEAH! This was the chocolate cake I had been striving for! Add just a little bit more cocoa powder if you're an extreme chocolate lover and you'll be satisfied. The coffee really adds that something extra I had been wanting in a chocolate cake.

I have searching forever for the perfect chocolate cake, and I think I've found it. I've made this cake 3 times so far and it hasn't failed me yet. I've paired it with caramel frosting and with mint frosting. I have also made it into cupcakes. Delicious! I would recommend it to anyone!

I love this recipe, it's all done in one bowl.  Very easy, consistently good recipe.  It's my go- to recipe for when I need a cake in a hurry because it's so quick to pull together.  If you use Cake and Pastry flour in it, as I do, you need to use 2 cups of it and you MUST sift the dry ingredients together into the bowl. (I originally got the recipe off a Robin Hood Cake and Pastry Flour bag many years ago).  When I don't have buttermilk on hand, I put in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sour cream and add milk to make one cup.  It has the benefit of making the cake taste a bit richer.  If you like a little coffee flavour in your chocolate cake, you should throw a tsp of instant espresso powder into the dry ingredients as well as using the brewed coffee.  You can add a tsp of cinnamon to change up the flavour (if you like the combination of cinnamon and chocolate).

This is THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever made. Rich and very moist with the perfect amount of chocolate. It's so, so good! I used this recipe to make cupcakes and filled the middles with cream (I made the cream using the " Cream Filled Cupcakes" recipe, also from this website). I took them to our family Easter gathering and there wasn't a single one left to bring home!!! Everyone raved about them and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be allowed in the door of the next family gathering without them. Thanks for the awesome recipe! I already threw away my old chocolate cake recipe :)

Rich and moist cake! I cut sugar by 1/3 and got slightly bitter taste -- the way my family likes. I also replaced half of vegetable oil with applesauce. Because I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I put 1 T of vinegar to a cup of milk. I used half on the same day, and the other half the next day (covered, room temperature). The one that had been out for a day tasted BETTER -- it was firm (not too firm) and had richer taste! I will make it again and again, with different type of frosting!

This is really the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever had. I suggest checking how strong the coffee turns out to be first, if it is too strong don't use all the amount, use 1/4 less or so, it u use the entire cup in taste too strong

All the amazing reviews about this cake are exactly true!  I was a little worried because I like to follow recipes exactly and a cup of strong coffee seems like a lot to add to one batter.  I made strong coffee just for this and added it and I could smell it in the cake after it came out of the oven but once it was frosted I couldn't taste it all.  The cake was wonderfully rich and delicious.  Magical, indeed!

LOVED this cake! Contrary to the not so good reviews I went ahead and tried it and thank goodness I did! I had no issue with the texture, cake sinking in or crumbling. followed the recipe with the exception of the buttermilk, but used milk+vinegar instead, it is very moist and flavorful and I topped mine with "cream cheese whipped cream" also on this site and it was AMAZING when all those glorious flavors came together. I will be keeping this as my go to recipe for chocolate cake from now on!

Wonderful cake. So easy to make. I took it a couple steps farther, I poured it into tart shells and dropped in a tsp of raspberry jam. they were wonderful.

This cake has been a huge hit every time I have made it. It is super moist and very tasty. I cover the top with sliced almonds and it is like heaven. I have had many people ask for the recipe and I direct them to this site. I'd give it ten stars if I could.

Delicious.  First cake I've made from scratch and it came out great.  I made with Buttercream frosting with peppermint instead of vanilla.  Yumm.  Can't wait to make again.

Heavenly moist, rich and decadent! This batter is thin, but rises a lot, so use the recommended pan sizes.  Much better than any pre-mixed cake mix.

It wasn't awful but it wasn't the best either: I would recommend adding chocolate chips because the cake comes out a bit different with the coffee.

Amazing.  I wanted to make homemade chocolate cupcakes.  This recipe looked great, but I was worried that it might be too dense for cupcakes.  But they turned out fantastic.  The only adjustment I made was to the cooking time.  15 minutes was perfect for cupcakes.

Delicious & easy, this is about the best chocolate cake/cupcake recipe you'll find. I usually need to extend the baking time a bit. If you open the oven or take out the cake too early, it will sink & not regain it's fluffiness. This doesn't affect the flavor but ruins the appearance a bit. Don't open the oven door before the surface of the cake is completely still (no tiny bubbles). Mini-cupcakes take ca 15 min. Bake the night before if you want to split & frost it.

Delicious!! i baked this up simple and fast for an impromptu Halloween get-together and I think it will now be a Halloween tradition.  It was such a hit!  I actually noticed after baking it that I had somehow forgotten to add the 1/2c oil...however the cake was still great tasting.  Perfect homemade choc cake.  I paired it with Rich Chocolate Frosting from here and rough chopped walnuts in the filling.   It really does bewitch one's palette :D

I don't remember where she found it (I think it was on a box of Hershey's cocoa), but this recipe has been a standby in our family for years - since I was a child! Whenever someone asks for chocolate cake, this is what they mean. Moist, rich, & delicious. Frost with a home-made buttercream frosting for a real treat. My dad always requests it 'black forest' style, topped with cherry pie filling and chocolate frosting. AMAZING!

I have been making this cake for over 40 years. Same results, same raves. Periodically I'll put in a cup of mini chocolate chips, but really it needs no other changes. It's perfection every time.

Totally awesome! I used a cream cheese icing from this site as well thinking a chocolate icing would be to overwhelming and it was delish! Even a week later it was moist and delicious, not the least bit dried out.  For sure my new go to recipie for chocolate cake.

I made this exactly as written, and as much as I was concerned about how thin the batter was, I did not change anything. As it turns out, this was by far the BEST cake I have ever tasted, much less made myself! It was moist and absolutely delicious!

Oh my goodness this cake is wonderful.  Hands down it's the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made.   Like others, I had a little problem with it sticking the first time I made it, so the next time I made it I used parchment paper in the baking pan. Presto! No sticking but still all sorts of fabulousness in the cake. Mmmmm!

DE-LICIOUS!!  I decided to make the cake with a peanut butter frosting but was a bit worried the coffee would overpower the chocolate- not at all the case!  I was light and fluffy, but didn't fall apart when removing from the pan.  Will definitely make again!!

Great recipe!!! Super fast and easy to make. I used this recipe for cup cakes. The kids loved them and so did I. If you want to add just a little extra kick, use hazelnut coffee instead of regular. It gives it a great taste.

I had to review my review ;)    I can't believe that  someone who likes chocolate cake won't like this cake! It's wonderful and not that rich that you can't eat 2 maybe 3 pieces at once. Hmmm... I made with choc butter and powder sugar frosting (same for filling). It tastes like a chocolate cake from a very fine bakery. DO NOT LET THE BAD REVIEWS DISCOURAGE YOU! You will miss a great culinary experience ;) -----------      THIS IS A DREAM CAKE!!!! 
I can't believe that it didn't work for some people!  This cake is wonderful and it is dummy proof ;) 
It's so easy to make, no frills. No egg whites beating, no mixing dry an wet ingredients separately first. I used a browny icing and it was beautiful. Delicious. Hmmmmm!!!
I must confess that I used less sugar an less oil in my second try. I wanted to feel less guilt when devouring this wonderful concoction. Even w/ less oil and sugar it was scrumptious and moist all the way!
I might be beating a dead horse here but I baked this cake today again and it is just M-A-R-V-E-L-L-O-U-S!!! So I decided to comment again. 
This time I used cocoa buttercream frosting and must say that is the best chocolate cake ever!
Here I am enjoying this awesome cake drowsing my way in a blissful chocolate comma.  Envy me ;)

This is a fantastic and easy recipe.  Extremely rich with the added coffee.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and added no frosting.  It was very delicious on its own, but if you like the extra sweetness to a rich chocolate cake, add icing to it.

Very easy and very tasty cake.  Followed the recipe almost exactly and it was wonderful!  Some people asked for seconds!  Instead of unsweetened cocoa I used Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa and it was yummy!  I used a whipped cream/cream cheese frosting, and filled with a cream cheese filling.

4.5 stars. It is good - but not the best cake ever. I would make it again for a more gourmet crowd. My men like their cake plain. The Coffee gives it an interesting taste. It looks beautiful and smells great. Over all....very good!

It was easy and delicious!  This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe:)  It's good with strawberries, raspberries, chocolate, cream cheese based fillings.  Recently I Made a white cake for top layer and this chocolate cake for bottom layer with crushed Oreo cookies mix-in to the batters, then filled the middle with whipped cream Oreo cookies mix-in and finished it off with whipped cream icing and my kids decorated it with fresh strawberries, mini Oreo cookies, M&M and chocolate morsels.  It was great!

Great recipe !!!   I normally make the Hershey Chocolate Cake recipe ( which is a close second to this ) but the addition of coffee to enhance the chocolate taste and buttermilk for moistness is just the ticket for a great chocolate cake. This is different from the Hershey recipe and well worth a try.

I am an avid baker and I have tried many homemade cake recipes. This one was absolutely wonderful. It is very moist and stays that way for a couple of days, if it makes it that long. I made this for a family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I did, however, change the name of it for my family's preference.

I'm surprised this cake has such high reviews.  I have made it twice now, following the recipe and cook time, and both times it came out dry.  It also stuck REALLY badly to my pans (as others have mentioned) despite greasing and flouring.  The taste is good enough, but i'll be searching for a better, moister cake recipe.

Phenomenal.  I've made this twice (once for my friend's birthday, the other time just to eat it!).  Super moist, super tasty.  The second time I made it it stuck to the pans, but it was saveable (nothing a little frosting can't fix, eh?)  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and topped it with crushed Oreo cookies.  Even thinking about it is putting me in a diabetic coma.  Awesome cake.

I decided to make this for my birthday. I baked the cake two days in advance and frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site the day of my birthday. It looked very impressive with the rosettes that I piped onto it. The cake itself was moist, rich and oh-so-decadent. We could all only eat a piece. I did a little research and I found that this is the original Hershey's chocolate cake recipe. This is going into my keeper file. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Marsha!

I added a quarter cup of kirsch to this to make it a black forest cake, and it was one of the best I've ever made. It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it, and was still moist and delicious two days after (I made a huge cake so we saved a bit). Highly recommended for chocolate lovers!

I made this into cupcakes.  It yielded about 27, and I baked for about 20 minutes.  They raised perfectly with the exception of the few that I filled too full - they sank slightly in the middle, but that was completely my fault.  I frosted them with Rick's Special Buttercream frosting that I made with half butter, half shortening, and flavored with cocoa.  These turned out absolutely delicious!  The cake was moist, and very tasty.  I think it would also be delicious with a cream cheese frosting too.  Great recipe.

I'm sorry but I tried to do this recipe numerous times, but unfortunately it did not come out that well. The cake fell or didn't cook all the way. However the batter tasted good, but the texture was unpleasent.

WOW! I have a lot of issues with cakes from scratch, but this recipe will remain with me until the day I die! Perfection! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice with the cup of milk. That black magic makes the best chocolate cake. Make it right this minute!!

One of the best chocolate cake recipes i have ever used. I did however substitute the brewed coffee for 2 tsp of instant coffee in 1cup of hot water and it came out great. The batter may be a bit runny but this does not affect the quality of the cake.

This cake got me rave reviews from my girlfriends and my husband liked it as well.  I made 2 rounds, with a little less sugar than the recipe called for.  I made a layer of sliced bananas between, and poured this glaze over it:  1/2 cup brown sugar, packed, 2 tablespoons light corn syrup, 2 tablespoons rum; 2 tablespoons butter; 1/3 cup heavy cream; 1 teaspoon vanilla-- used corn starch to thicken.   For the top, I used a dark chocolate glaze: 3/4 cup dark choc chips, 3 T butter, 1 T light corn syrup, 1/4 t vanilla extract, melted in a microwave and then spread over.   I garnished with 5 raspberries.   Looked beautiful and the flavors were amazing together!

I have been making this cake for at least 30 years and it is the only way to go.  It is so good!!!! especially with homemade fudge frosting on it.

Awsesome cake.  You do not really taste the coffee in the cake - it just further enhances the chocolate flavor.  If you want more coffee flavor, I would try adding espresso instead of coffee.

This cake turned out really well..moist and fluffy. I frosted with chocolate cream cheese frosting and it was delish! The only change I made to the recipe is that I used three tablespoons of instant coffee mixed with one cup of hot water substituted for the one cup of strong brewed coffee.

STICKY!!!  Mine came out overflowing slightly out of 2 9in round.  Next time I'll fill 3 half way or just fill a small side thing with the extra.  My cake also would Not come out of the pan.  It came out finally with digging and my hands in no less than 8 pieces.  I ended up just having to mash the cake together.  It was to die for in taste however.  It made a very nice COW cake as my friend called it.  (Cake Out of Whack)

amazing, nobody in my family believed i made this from scratch. it was super moist and really rich, definitely need milk with this. it was really fragile right out of the oven (it was done after the full 40 minutes) so i let it cool for ten minutes before sliding it (carefully) out of the pan. i then put it in the freezer for 30 minutes after it had cooled in order to frost it. will be making again!

This is a super simple, moist cake! The recipe is exactly like the Barefoot Contessa's chocolate cake, except she ices her cake. I iced it like her (butter-cream) and it was a hit! I used 2 tsp instant coffee in a hot cup of water instead of brewed, and it came out just fine :)

This came out very well, without that weird artificial flavor and ultra sweetness that box mixes have, yet mine wasn't quite as soft as boxed. I realize that's very difficult to achieve and relies as much on the cook as the recipe, so I'm still giving this an enthusiastic 5 stars, because it's definitely the best scratch choccy cake I've ever made (or eaten). My next batch of this cake I will check at 27 minutes rather than 30 -- that has to be adjusted for every oven and every set of cake pans too, so your results may vary from mine on this note. This cake does not dome much which is preferable for my needs -- I don't wind up having to trim the top to get a flat edge :) Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best chocolate cake ever! It is soooo easy too! I was worried about the coffee in it but you can't taste that at all -I learned that it just intensifies the chocolate taste. I also use decaf now because my young children ate some the first time I made it (not thinking about the coffee in it) and they were up until midnight!!! Anyway, I am growing famous for this cake and the filling/frosting that I use on it. People swoon that it is better than the really good cake bakery we have in town! Now that is a compliment! Thanks sooooo much for sharing this recipe. Also note that the batter is extremely thin -it's supposed to be. Part of the magic is that it grows and grows into the perfect cake! DO NOT overbake this. I see some reviewers have and ranked this recipe low. Follow the directions. Use the toothpick test -not a wiggle test.

EIGHT O'CLOCK COFFEE MOCHA FLAVOR=DELICIOUS RESULTS!!  I've tried at least 10 different flavors/brands of brew coffee as well as instant coffee and I get amazingly rich results by making a cold brew coffee for at least 24 hrs with the mocha flavored coffee.  I brew an entire pound and then freeze cubes of it to use later.  This is definitely my favorite, go-to chocolate cake!  I don't even get out the Kitchenaid for this one, just mix all the ingredients in the bowl.  It's very easy and delicious!

Made this with chocolate ganache and friends raved about it. A great basic chocolate cake, with a nice consistency. Good and moist. Definately handle with care and give it plenty of cool-down time. It is super moist when it first comes out of the oven and is quite fragile. Happy baking!

If you're a chocolate lover, this cake is like heaven on a plate. I took it one step further and turned it into a rumcake by making it in a bundt pan and pouring a 1/4 cup of rum on it after poking the top with a fork, then turned it out and frosted with a thick ganache frosting. You will not believe how good this is! It's been known to make people go weak at the knees at my house ;)

WOW! I read the 1 star reviews and it is obviously that they screwed up the recipe. This cake is too  good and easy not to screw [it] up. I am not a baker and I must say I did a fantastic job baking this for the first time. YUMMY =)

This cake does NOT need frosting. In fact, it's better with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and REAL whipped cream. I have been making this cake for almost 15 years. I also cut the sugar back 1/2cup. So only use 1 and 1/2 cup.  I have frosted it in the past however, Trust me!!! you dont need it. Dont make layers, use a sheet pan. After sitting on the counter for 10 minutes. Put a clean kitchen towel over it and it will retain that moisture and provide an almost fudgy top. That is why you dont need that frosting....  My friends and family rave. In fact, no matter what other chocolate cake I make, it never fail that my husband says, its good but not as good as that BLACK MAGIC cake you make....

Excellent recipe!  We have made it three times already, (twice in one week) and it never lasts longer than three days!  I baked it in three 8 inch round pans to make a cake with more layers.  It turned out great!  I also used 1/2 c. butter, 1 c. 10X sugar, 3 1/2 c. cocoa powder, 1/2 c. milk, and 1 teas vanilla for icing.  Next time I'll try mixing some instant coffee granules into the icing before spreading.  I usually sprinkle mini-chocolate chips on top for extra chocolaty-ness!  It's excellent!

Oh my!  This is absolutely, hands down, the BEST chocolate cake I've made/tasted.  It's so dark and dense.  Perfectly moist.  I topped it with Rich Chocolate Frosting from allrecipes, and the flavor combo was nothing short of spectacular!  Definitely my go-to when I need a major dose of chocolate!  Marsha, you're the bomb!

I definitely recommend cakes made with oil rather than butter and my husband agrees this cake came out so moist and it tastes way better than a box cake(they have a weird aftertaste) the only thing I changed is I warmed up the buttermilk and then whisked in the cocoa powder to it.

This is really a very good chocolate cake recipe.  Ive been really concious about the food I buy and decided that Im not using anymore boxed cake recipes.....the list of ingredients is to much for a cake plus the hydrogenated fat.....no thanks.  The only thing I do is I use 1/2 cup of real butter instead of oil.  Ive made the cake both ways with butter and with oil and the butter really makes taste better and it makes it more moist.    Thanks Marsha.  This is my go-to cake now and Ive made it several times now and I almost know the recipe by hard and it takes no more time that a box cake would.    I ice the cake with homemade icing as well. 1 stick of butter melted 6 T of cocoa 1 box of powdered sugar Add a little milk at a time as your are beating all ingredients together to the consistency you want it.  Viola, homemade cake and icing, and not an ingredient in it that you cant pronounce!

decided to make this before reading the recipe completely. I am not a big coffee fan, so I made some hot chocolate and replaced with that. Very moist and delicious cake. I am thinking about using peppermint schnapps next time, I will try to remember to let people know how it goes!

This awesome recipe saved the day!  I told the Hubster that I'd make him a cake for his birthday (ok, so I'd never made a real round layer cake before, but I didn't think it'd be all that hard).  Luckily for me, the recipe made it simple and quick and was SO yummy and moist!  Frosted it with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and it was just what I was hoping for.  Hubster was so impressed with his cake and loved how rich and delicious it was!  :)  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and will DEFINITELY be making this cake again!  Thank you for a PERFECT chocolate cake!

This is by far the most decadent chocolate cake I have ever made!!  I have made this so many times by request that I can't even keep count.  I do dust my pan with cocoa instead of flour it just makes it look so nice then I use a chocolate glaze to bring the whole cake together!  Love this recipie!

I first used this recipie 6 mo. ago & I've been so busy baking different versions that I haven't had time to review it!  It is now my standard chocolate cake recipie, & I'm going to make it again tomarrow for my best friend's baby shower.  It is moist & dense & luscious!  I have sub'ed the coffee with tea, water, hot cocoa, apricot nectar, & rum & it always turns out scrumptious.  It takes a full hour to bake in my oven, & the center always falls a little for me, but that just means more frosting or a nice place to put fruit.  I recomend making this the night before you plan to serve it so it can cool over night, & a crumb coat is DEFINATELY required when frosting this cake.  Thank you for sharing this slice of chocolicious heaven.

I don't think I can add anymore great things to the ratings of this cake as it has all been said so many times before. It is all true though and I don't understand how anyone could ding this recipe lower than 5 stars. This is the first scratch cake I baked in over 50 years and found that my efforts produced a cake that moister and better flavored than any box cake I've ever made. The only way I've ever had a box cake moist like this was due to having to add a pudding mix to it. I was concerned when the cake came out of the over though. I didn't rise as much as I thought it should have. I was thinking that I did something wrong or my baking soda had died (the baking powder was new) and tested the soda in some vinegar and it reacted very vigorously. Well I made the cake a second time and it came out the same height so I ended up making a four layer cake! (hint: go to wall mart and for about 4 bucks you can buy a cake leveling wire that you can set the height of and you'll never have lopsided cakes again!) I topped this cake with the "Fluffy Seven-Minute Frosting" from this site. It is the easiest to put together and you don't need a double boiler! I haven't cut this cake yet (taking it to a party tonight) but I did put some of the frosting on the cake trimmings and oh my! what flavor!!! Sorry for the long story but I get that way when a recipe comes out so great! Happy Halloween everybody! 1 last hint: you can buy powered butter milk at most heath food stores.Never with out it!

I got this recipe from a magazine but it was for a bundt pan, baked for 45 to 50 min., cool completely and dust with powdered sugar.  It is good just plain.  Everyone I make this for loves it.  So simple to make.

Definitely a magical experience!! I didn't have buttermilk so i made my own, just put 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in a 1 cup measuring cup and fill the rest up with milk.  Let it sit 5 minutes and you have buttermilk!

I think this is the best chocolate cake I made so far. However, i needed to let it cool longer than ten minutes because when i tried taking it out of the pans, it fell apart a little. Otherwise, it was moist and delicious and chocolately! I will make this again

Oh. my. Goodness. I will never buy a boxed cake again. OMG!! If I could give this cake 20 stars I would. I didnt tweek a thing. Although, a little trick if you dont have buttermilk, use regular milk and add about 2 tblsp of either vinegar or lemon juice and let it set for 5 min.  Wonderful cake had no problems with breaking. Love the chocolate that comes accross so richly and the cake is moist as can be. My new go to recipe!

I agree with the others, this is surely rich and moist, but in my opinion the coffee flavor was overpowering, I was expecting something more chocolately.

Great!  I used cake flour but followed exactly as written otherwise.  I used this batter to make cupcakes.  Since it is so thin I poured it into a 2 cup glass measure with a pour spout so I could pour it into my cupcake liners.  Frosted with Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site.  This is a dark, rich cake.  Yummy!

I made this cake for a "cake party" (where all 15 or so guests had to bring a cake that they'd baked) and many people told me this cake was the best.

It IS very good, very moist, chocolatey. The coffee taste is subtle, I used a hazelnut blend which was good. I also used the coffee cinnamon icing, which for me was way too sweet, I'd probably use something lighter next time. I imagine you'd be best off with a ganache drizzled on top, or a fruity topping. The cake is moist enough to serve without a heavy icing.

Also, in regards to the sticking problem many mentioned -- I greased a 13x9 glass pan with Pam spray and it was completely fine. 

This cake is delicious, but not mind-blowing enough to be the highest rated cake on this site. I had very high expectations because of that, so that's why I took off one star. But it is definitely a winner, take it to any party and it'll get gobbled up.

Very moist and flavorful cake!! Perfect combination of chocolate and coffee. It's identical to Hershey’s Black Magic Cake. I make this cake with brewed Starbucks Espresso Roast and top it with Choco-Mocha Frosting. Yum!!

Absolutely fabulous, but the funny thing is... 
I thought id be creative and use 2 bread pans, and make a serious layer cake. But.. i didnt realize that i should have used 3... my mix overflowed out of the bread pans! lol so i turned it into a chocolate cake, with choco sauce and vanilla ice cream creation. Even better!
***note to self get cake pans!!!

I did not care for the texture at all. I Will not be making again.
***Update 2015**** Omg I don't know what I did wrong before!!! My 11 year old wanted Chocolate Cake and after searching the web for hours I ended up back here and the only thing I changed was I added 2 cups of flour instead of 1 3/4C and about 2/3 cup of really good strong brewed coffee!!! This Cake was so moist and delicious that my 15 year old ate half of the cake!!!

I've been making this recipe for 30 years and have never been disappointed.  It seems to be fool-proof!!  Everyone loves the dark, rich flavor and it gets eaten up in a hurry.

MAKE IT A BLACK FOREST CAKE! Awesome cake recipe.  I followed exactly and used it to make Black Forest Cake.  For the filling and icing I took just those recipes from "Holly's Black Forest Cake" and it turned out divine! I made this for a party of 40 and everyone RAVED about it - even the picky boyfriend who's favorite is Black Forest. *Note - this was my first time to make a cake from scratch, so don't be scared!

Made this several days before Halloween as a trial run.  We didn't eat much of it (although I thought it was good -- I didn't want to make a pig of myself!), and when an invited guest volunteered to bring a cake, I was going to toss what was left of this one.  

But my folks showed up earlier than I expected, and tried the cake.  Mom kept going back for more.  Dad doesn't even like cake, and he had seconds!  That speaks volumes.  My girlfriend's picky son really liked it, too.  :-)  It was a HUGE hit.  The other cake was hardly touched.  (ssshhh!)

Thanks for the reicpe!

My boyfriend made me bring the "uneaten" portion of this cake to work because it was so tempting and delicious.  The cake was consumed within minutes.  During the day people came to me and asked if I made the cake.  Several people asked for the recipe.  In my opinion, the strong coffee and buttermilk are the key ingredients that make this cake a tasty treat.  I added a bittersweet chocolate ganache icing (1 cup of heavy cream heated until boiling, with 9 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate added).  I'll definitely using this recipe again.

This was an utterly delicious recipe!  I made cupcakes with the batter, and used a caramel icing recipe found on this site.  I have never tasted moister cake.  My grandma is famous for her chocolate cupcakes with caramel icing, but my family admitted that these tasted even better than her recipe.

Delicious and moist!  I used brewed expresso coffee and nonfat plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, and used a cocoa/expresso glaze/icing.  It came out great!

I made this recipe several times for cupcakes and once for a cake. I'm a novice, hobby baker and the cake was good, but the cupcakes were exquisite! Very moist and chocolatey! I have received several compliments on them. 

I made the recipe exact and paired it with a buttercream recipe from allrecipes. It's makes 24 standard cupcakes, but could probably make a few more as I always slightly over fill mine. They rise very well, so I suggest filling them half way. Same temp as written for the cake but for 20-22 minutes. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!

This was seriously the best chocolate cake I've ever had - super chocolatey, super moist, and not too sweet. I made it in 2 9-inch pans and frosted the middle and top with an oreo cream cheese icing and OH MY GOD. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfectly done in exactly 35 minutes. I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder which is a blend of natural and dutch process cocoa. I also used 35% reduced fat buttermilk because that's all the store had. The only thing I did slightly different than the recipe, based on another reviewer's suggestion, is I first sifted together all the dry ingredients, then whisked together all the wet ingredients, then I folded the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing with a spatula just enough to get everything well incorporated. Also my eggs were completely room temperature. I greased and cocoa-powedered the pans, and used parchment paper on the bottom and two little side-handles and they slipped right out after an hour or two. I then wrapped in cling-wrap and left overnight, and frosted the next day. The cake *is* a bit delicate to work with and crumbs easily but this was my first ever two-tiered cake and I had no problems getting it to look great. I popped it in the fridge for about 30 minutes prior to frosting to help with that and it worked wonderfully. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this cake for the first time a couple of days ago.  I was a little concerned about the thinness of the batter but it baked perfectly.  It was moist, delicious, and oh so chocolaty.  The recipe was so simple with common pantry ingredients.  It is the only chocolate cake recipe I will ever need.  I can't wait to try it again with some of the frostings, fillings and liquers from other reviews.

I made these for my sons' birthday parties back in the 80's using the Hersey cocoa box recipe. I made cupcakes with paper liners so there was no problem with sticking (bake 20-25 minutes). I used a cream cheese and butter frosting. I used powdered espresso to easily make the strong coffee. I used a cup of milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar (let sit for 5 minutes) as a substitute for buttermilk. It's an easy recipe that tastes great. The kids (and adults) loved them.

Hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I buttered the pans, lined with parchment paper and then buttered the parchment paper.  The cakes slid out perfectly.  I topped with Chocolate Ganache for a decadent Valentines Day dessert.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Previously my go to was the Hershey's cocoa powder cake. This cake is much less dense and has a richer taste. Kind of reminiscent of a brownie. I used my fave Duncan donuts coffee grounds for the coffee and topped with marshmallow buttercream (that I use in whoopie pies). Also super quick as I throw everything in my stand mixer. 
Marshmallow cream-1 stick butter unsalted (I use salted) 1 2/3 c confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 2 c marshmallow cream (fluff)

This was the first time that I EVER made a cake from scratch! I was really nervous going in, but ultimately was blown away by how easy it was… and how tasty the final product is! Word to the wise-- The batter, before baking, is VERY thin. Don't be alarmed!! It will bake up into a wonderfully fluffy, decadent chocolate cake. This cake is quite airy and fluffy--- if you're looking for a more dense, hearty cake this recipe is not for you.

I've made this cake four times in less than two weeks! IT'S *THAT* GOOD. I substitute 1/2 cup of sour cream for the 1/2 cup oil (adding 1/4 tsp baking soda to the dry ingredients), and I substitute milk + vinegar for the buttermilk. I've also found that using espresso roast coffee makes is especially awesome.  frosting/

This is an excellent cake. A good from scratch cake that I have never had fail. I would suggest, if it's to your liking, to use an espresso for the coffee and Kahlua in place of the vanilla. To  the one with the meh ratings, and they are all over the internet, you never like anything. I ignore your ratings.

Bakes up very dark, somewhat dense, and very chocolate, just the way I like it. Mine fell a little in the center so I quickly put it back in the oven for another 7 minutes. Had to level the layers, but no big deal because it was delish! Didn't do the toothpick test which could have prevented falling, and maybe beat it a little too long (?) Tastes and looks so good, would definitely make it again. Made a 2 layer chocolate mint birthday cake with 1 minute chocolate icing recipe from this site and green peppermint buttercream and junior mint garnish. Making this this chocolate cake recipe again for sure!

I'm making this cake recipe for the second time today...it's THAT good! Pairing it with the French Silk Frosting recipe from this site, it's the perfect combination for a sensational cake. Reminiscent of my mothers oh-so-delicious French Silk Pie I grew up with, I'm hoping this Black Magic Cake with French Silk frosting will win first place at a cake baking competition at my church. All in the spirit of good fun. Wish me luck!

Phenomenal cake with so many options!  Cupcakes, 2 layer, sheet with various frosting options.  I used the Cinco de Mayo Chili Frosting from this site and this cake was out of this world.  VERY most, rich and deep flavor - thanks for sharing.  The ONLY thing I will do different next time is brew stronger coffee - personal preference.

Yum Yum!  Great chocolate taste. I recently bought cocoa powder and got a craving to use it after dinner tonight. Had to make my own buttermilk (2T white vinegar to 1C milk, stir, wait 5 min.) as I didn't have any on hand and made cupcakes (20 Min. @ 350) instead of two rounds.  They really hit the spot! Thank you for the recipe...Topped 3 with butterscotch chips, 3 with chocolate chips, 3 with powdered sugar, and 3 plain. Was hard to photograph because they are so dark, but will post anyway!

By far THE BEST cake I have ever tasted in my life. Topped mine with a dusting of powdered sugar. Instead of dusting the pan with flour I used cocoa powder since I had it out. Baked mine for 33 minutes. Next time will top it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe found on this site.

I was a bit nervous because the batter seemed too liquid, but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! Delicious, moist, and wonderful with chocolate fudge frosting.

This is a great recipe. But the serving size is way off. With two 9-inch round pans, they're saying there are 24 servings. That's 12 servings per pan. That means each serving is about 3/4 of an inch at the outer edge. I stack the cakes and cut the stack into 8 pieces. It's still only an inch wide. But it's twice as deep. It works out to about 600 calories for 1/8 of the double-stack.

Turned out great, no modifications made. I used a frosting recipe found with the red velvet cake by Eleanor johnson, worked really well. Especially with adults who don't like extremely sweet icing and cakes.

Terrific cake! Extremely moist and easy to make. I was a bit concerned about the batter as it was extremely watery. But the reviews indicated that it's expected so I took a leap of faith - and viola - fabulous chocolate cake emerged after 30 minutes. My hubby loves the moist and deep chocolate flavor.

My mom had her version of this recipe in an old "composition book" she used to keep,and I baked the cake tonight in cupcake form. Yes, the batter is thin so I funneled it into a plastic ketchup squirter, and just took off the top part to pour it into the paper cups.  Also I doubled the vanilla and added a tsp of almond extract.  On the facing page of her book, there was a recipe for English Caramel frosting (this I did not make but I improvised from store bought icing and a caramel additive, this time).  She was a caramel addict.  Delicious together. Very decadent.

I've made this cake for years and love it. It is even better on the 2nd day. Since moving to Durango Colorado I've done nothing but fail when trying to make it for the past few years. I FINALLY succeeded with making the cake at high elevation here are the tips that work best for others who live in the mountains!

I cut the sugar in half so only 1 cup and added more flour 2 Cups. I bake in stones so I naturally drop the temperature in the oven to 325 and bake for the same amount of time. Other wise you tend to get a boiling caramelized mess, tastes great but it is the most temperamental thing I've made in my home above 8000'. I'm glad to share my final success after 3 attempts.

This cake is AMAZING. If you didn't give this recipe 5 stars its because you didn't do it right! Not the recipes fault....fault on the baker. I thought there was going to be a strong coffee flavor in the cake and there wasn't at all. The coffee is a hidden secret ingredient that gives a delicious rich chocolate flavor and makes for an extremely moist cake. My kids had two whole slices and never even knew the coffee was in there. I put a caramel filling in between the layers and frosted it with a chocolate buttercream. Its a must try!! I am a baker and I own a cupcake shop. I've tried plenty of chocolate cake recipes and this one is THE BEST.

This is Hershey's cake recipe which I have made a few times, plus this cake is the best, very moist. I used the Dark Cocoa of Hershey's, also I want to say the recipe is so easy to make, I used sour milk instead of the buttermilk which you can use either one.

This cake in amazing! Moist and chocolaty. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish and it took 35 minutes.  I topped it with the creamy chocolate frosting from this site and it's one of the best cakes I've ever tasted! Even my husband, who is really good about staying away from sweets has been nibbling on it.

My first shot at baking from scratch, and it turned out very well. Dense, moist, and with deep chocolate flavor. Better than any boxed cake mix! I used the chocolate buttercream frosting with it and that was perfect.

I personally give this 4 stars (meaning i liked it but wouldnt make it again) but many in my family give it 5 stars (loved it and want it again).  They say it's like the cake of a Suzy-Q.  So I've made it multiple times.  I frost this with vanilla buttercream.  So there you have it . . . hope this review helps.

This cake was amazing. I made it with a dark chocolate frosting. We are all huge chocolate lovers, and this recipe was as rich and moist as I think a cake recipe could possibly be. Don't plan on being able to eat large slices of cake-a little goes a long way due to its richness.

Made this for my husband's birthday and it was a hit. He said it was the best cake I've ever made (okay, it's only my 4th cake from scratch), and even better, that it changed his opinion on chocolate cake (previously not caring too much for chocolate cake). 

The cake was so moist and light (other cakes I've made had been on the dense side), even the last piece. It was soft and delicate, so I put it in the freezer before icing per another reviewer.

I topped it with the cinnamon mocha frosting on this site.

Best homemade cake ever!  Unlike many of the other homemade cakes I've tried, this one was so moist and absolutely perfect!  I baked it for 35 minutes and followed the directions exactly.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II and used it for my Marie Antoinette inspired birthday cake for my sister.  This will definitely be my go-to cake recipe.

Me and my bestie made this cake and it turned out crazy.  For some reason it overflowed out of the pan, then it wouldn't finish baking in the middle.  Except the sides were finished perfectly.  So we put it in for 3 more minutes and the cake almost burned on the sides and nothing happened to the middle. :(

A ton of chocolatey goodness! I cut down the sugar, and instead of buttermilk, I mixed one cup of milk with 1 tbsp of vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes.

Very disappointed. It tasted good, but definitely not impressive like the previous reviewers raved about. I will not make this again, and I will continue to search for an "amazing" chocolate cake.

This chocolate cake is perfect.  I didn't make any changes, except that I sifted the dry ingredients as I added them.  My 9 inch rounds came out perfectly after 34 minutes.  I made a whipped cream (heavy cream, confectioner's sugar, vanilla) and then added crushed chocolate wafer cookies to make a cookies and cream frosting.  Delicious!

So easy to make I couldn't believe how delicious it was!  Used brown sugar instead of white.  Turned out great. Used a Via for the coffee.  I would recommend a really strong brew for the coffee.  Mine was strong, but the cake can handle stronger.   Moist, not too dense.  We kept this in the refrigerator and ate it over a few days....each day was just a good.  Can't wait until it's my birthday so I can bake it for myself.

Really really fantastic! I used 3 packets of instant coffee to 1 c of hot water. I also  made frosting with equal parts of butter/cream cheese/powdered sugar and then added some coffee liquor.  I curled some chocolate for the top and it was beautiful and tasted wonderful..... a keeper!

I've never reviewed this cake before now? I should be punished severely, because this cake is perfection and I've used the recipe, many, many, many times. I change nothing, and there is no need to. Super moist, super chocolatey, just plain super. Make it!

I made this cake last Thanksgiving to bring along to my sister's house, and it disappeared faster than the turkey! I didn't brew the coffee, I simply used instant coffee, and lots of it to get a more intense flavor. There wasn't even a crumb left of this cake, and everyone has been bugging me to make it again! So for my sister's birthday I plan on watching it fly off the platter again! Very yummy, fudgy-moist cake!!

Amazingly delicious.  Cut the recipe in half, baked in a 9" round pan, covered in chocolate frosting and garnished with strawberries.  Very simple, quick, and wonderful.  Thank you for posting the recipe!

This cake is amazingly moist and delicious!!  I substituted buttermilk with 1c of milk mixed with 1tbsp of white vinegar and let it sit for 10mins.  I topped it with rich chocolate frosting, walnuts and homemade whipped cream . 
 Soooo good!!

Made this cake for hubby's birthday, and used whipped cream and cherry pie filling to turn it into a black forest cake.  It was AMAZING.  The cake itself is so moist and wonderful!  I'm planning to make this for MY birthday.  Thank you!

Very good cake!  I filled it with the Fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe from this website and then frosted it with the Rich chocolate Frosting recipe from this site also.

Not enough stars showing.  The ONLY thing I did was add 2 tablespoons of Special Dark cocoa powder.  The absolute BEST chocolate cake I've ever made in my entire life.  This recipe also makes the absolute best cake balls/truffles/pops.  Yeah, it's very time consuming, but the ooohs and aahs you get make it totally worth it.

Awesome!  I made this cake for my Bunko group and they raved over it.  I used a butter cream frosting which was just the write amount of sweet to go with this not-so-sweet cake.

As a mediocre and apathetic cook, this was a great recipe that remains moist over the cake's lifespan (a short lifespan in my household, but a few days nonetheless).  One bowl. One pan. One to keep.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake is delicious and ridiculously easy to make. I didn't have any buttermilk so I put 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice in 1/2 cup whole milk and let it sit for 5 minutes.  I can't say if it was a perfect replacement because I only made it this way but it sure tasted great.

YUM!!  I made this for my MIL's birthday and it was a hit.  This chocolate cake was moist, rich, and full of deep chocolatey goodness.  I followed the recipe except I used low fat buttermilk, only about 3/4 cup coffee and mixed the wet ingredients separately from the dry ingredients before adding them to the dry ingredients.  Also, at the end I added probably a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and frosted it with chocolate buttercream frosting.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 35 minutes and it came out perfectly.  This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake.

This cake was very easy to make and was very moist. However it didn't have the deep, rich chocolate flavor I was looking for. It also didn't come out of the pan well. Fortunately extra frosting patched the layers back up!

The flavor of this cake was good, but ti me it almost had a texture like sponge cake. With the intensity of the flavor, I would have liked a moister cake.

I have made this countless times for several years now.
I have traded out the buttermilk with 8 oz sour cream just to keep them moist longer.
This actually only makes 16 cupcakes. Bake at 350 degrees for 16-20 minutes. In my oven, it is 18 minutes every time.
I normally top with peanut butter buttercream and they don't last long in the house or at work.

This cake is awesome. I substituted eggnog for buttermilk and threw in some apple butter, and it worked wonders. This cake is so moist and delicious it was good even days after. Also, brownie fudge frosting tops the cake nicely.

I loved this cake because I am a coffee lover; however, not so loved by the rest of my household. I did a peanut butter icing instead of the icing in the recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it was easy to make, delicious & extremely moist.  I baked it in a bundt pan & covered it with the Cream Cheese Glaze from 'damiles' Red Velvet Pancake recipe on this site.  I brought the cake to a Christmas Eve dinner gathering & there were no leftovers.  What's interesting, though, is that this is identical to the Black Magic Cake recipe on page 17 of the HERSHEY'S COCOA COOKBOOK (1979), so I'm not sure "Marsha" deserves the credit for this one!

I love baking, but not eating sweets. But, this cake is one of a kind. It's the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted and it's so easy to make. One slice is not enough. I used the creem cheese frosting recipe from this website and iced the cake for a birthday cake. Everyone loves it and ask me to open a bakery (lol). There's nothing special, I only follow the recipe exactly as it's written. Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe, will definitely bake this many many times :)

I made this cake for my sisters birthday with a mocha gnash and all of my friends and family (including my sister) loved it so much. My neighbor is a cooking goddess and said that is one of the best cakes she had ever had. This is also my favorite cake EEVVEERR. If you end up making this cake BEWARE: very Rich.

YUM! I made this as a bday cake with Amy Via's "Rich Chocolate Frosting" & Janni's "Cream Cheese Frosting II" as a filling. Would be good to use a custer as a filling too. 

This cake is devine! the bday boy said it was the best cake he'd ever tasted :)

All I could say after the first bite was WOW!!!! The only thing I did differently is I used coconut instead of vegetable oil (I always do this. It's healthy oil). And I also made it as a bundt and topped it with homemade German chocolate frosting from this website. Soooo moist and just to die for. I can't stop eating it!

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake recipe I've tried (and I've tried a few).  I made this as a bundt cake and decorated it for a Halloween party(2011).  It turned out so perfectly that no one wanted to cut in to it.  My husband and I didn't get to sample any until the next day and were secretly glad no one else ate it - it was so good.  I am now done looking for a good recipe this will be my go to from now on.  FABULOUS!!!

I was looking up this recipe to fix for my daughter's birthday and could not believe I have never rated it! This is my favorite "go to" chocolate cake recipe. It always comes out moist, is super simple to make and has a very rich flavor. The coffee gives it just a hint of extra kick flavor-wise.  I get great compliments on it every time I make it. If you want a simple but foolproof and impressive chocolate cake, you can't go wrong with this one! Thank so much for sharing!

I was a little disappointed in this cake... after reading so many of the reviews that raved about how moist and chocolatey the cake is, I guess I expected something better. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only change I made was that I used cake flour instead of regular all-purpose flour. My cake turned out well, but had a more spongy texture and was not as moist as other reviewers stated. I will try this one again, using regular flour next time... maybe that's the key. I also used whole buttermilk, will try the vinegar/sweet milk method or low-fat buttermilk next time as well. All in all, it's a good cake, but in my opinion tasted like a cake-mix cake instead of a scratch-made cake.

This cake is moist and rich..and ooohhh so good!!  I made this for a family get together for our October birthdays, along with some other things...and this was what people kept coming back for!! I made it for my sis to take to her work and I keep getting asked to make it again!  The only thing I would have done differently is to make the coffee stronger...I could barely taste it.  My fault.  It is a must try!!

One of the best chocolate cakes I've had. First I made cupcakes, and they were very moist even two or three days after. I froze a few to have them for halloween and they tasted just like the same day I baked them. Yes!!! I'm keeping the recipe.

I made this tonight. I used two 8 inch round pans and found that it didn't quite fill them as well as I would have liked. Next time I will make a double batch for this size.  The cake itself tasted very good.  I put lite cherry pie filling in the middle and whipped cream on top.  I didn't have any issue with it being too moist. It came right out of the pan.  I cooked them 35 minutes on the nose.  It wasn't the best Chocolate cake I've ever tasted, but it was very good and easy to make on the fly!

I'd give this ten stars if I could! Absolutely perfect, baked it 30 minutes, came out of the pans easily and frosted it with storebought chocolate frosting. I brought it to a party and there were only crumbs left! Everyone raved about it. Will be making this again!

Excellent! Super moist and full of flavor. I used real butter in place of the oil. I had no problems whatsoever with the cake sticking, I used canola spray in the bottom of the pan. The husband was raving and that don't happen often as he's not much on cake! I will definitely make this again and again, thank you!

This is the best chocolate cake I gave ever tasted, I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't have two 9-inch round cake pans, so I used one 10" Wilton round cake pan, then cut it into two layers. I spread warm peach preserves between the layers for a surprise flavor kick and it came out great! I made chocolate frosting right from the back of a store-brand cocoa canister. Pure magic!

Definitely my "go-to" recipe for chocolate cake.  Even my 10 year old can make it and have it turn out beautifully.  Top with cream cheese frosting and it will disappear!

OMG. I know its been said already, but this cake is magical. After ten minutes in the oven, I was convinced I had whipped up a chocolate-flavored hockey puck. Much to my surprise, a thirty minutes later I was greeted by a beautiful and tasty bittersweet cake! Absolutely divine with homemade buttercreme frosting!

In a word - SUBERB! I usually use cake mixes because I've had bad experiences with from-scratch cakes in the past, but I was impressed by all the great reviews for this recipe. I halved the recipe (which is why I wasn't using a mix to begin with), and cut the sugar by one third, and I ended up with 34 mini cupcakes (probably would have been a nice round 36 if I hadn't of kept "sampling" the batter!) The result was beautiful, perfectly formed little pieces of chocolate heaven. :) A decadent cocoa-y flavour, not too sweet, and just the right moist, dense (but not heavy) texture. The muffin liners even peeled off easily. I think I'd just have to call this The Perfect Chocolate Cake!

I have a regular catering gig every week at a local auction house.  I cook each week for about 100 people.....When I make this cake, I cannot keep it for more thatn an hour.......those who have had it buy it up and those who haven't come looking for the cake everyone else is eating, but it's always gone....easy, delicious recipe.  I make it exactly as directed but once in a while will use buttercream frosting just for a different taste.....either way.....it sells quick!!!

Wow! best cake ever! It was super moist. I made it into a layer cake. After slicing the cakes in half I froze them to make it easier to frost. Came out perfect.

I've been reading reviews and looking at pictures of this cake for the past week and I've been wanting to make it! My husband finally begged me to make it today and it came out perfect! Very moist and decadent! Everything that I want in a chocolate cake! It's perfect! I used 2 tsp. vanilla extract instead of one and I used Dunkin Donuts instant coffee with boiling water. You can't even taste the coffee in the cake! Goes great with a nice tall glass of cold milk! My daughter and my husband loved and devoured a huge slice! I'll be making this again and again!

This is an incredibly moist and flavorful chocolate cake. I used sour cream in place of the buttermilk because that's what I had on hand. I iced mine with the One Bowl Chocolate Frosting recipe on the Baker's chocolate box. It turned out to be a decadent chocolate cake that made my chocolate-loving coworker's day!

Sweet Lord, this is the most delicious cake I've ever had.  I've made it a few times to great success.  It's so nice to make a scratch cake that has the same beautiful texture of a mix cake.  I fill it with whipped ganache and then do another batch of ganache to pour over the top.

This cake was really, really good.  Even had the step-kids bragging about it (this means it must have been delicious).  I did put it in the freezer after it cooled so that I could get it out of the pan with out it falling apart, but that was my only issue.

Absolutely amazingly moist, fudgy and chocolatey cake. Very easy to make as well; could be a one-bowl cake, but chose to use two bowls to mix the liquids. 

After reading previous reviews on the cake crumbling, I cooked the cake for the whole 40 minutes and left it in the fridge to set before icing it. 

I also halved the recipe, but regret it now as it came out quite small. 

My only criticism of the cake was that it shrank when cooling down. Other than that, one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is so moist, chocolaty and easy to make. I doubled the recipe, frosted it with "Special Buttercream Frosting" on this site and slices of strawberries for a party of 30. Not a single piece left! Thank you for sharing!

I loved the way this cake turned out! It was my first attempt at making my own cake (not from a box). I was worried about adding coffee since I abhor the taste, but you cannot taste the coffee at all. Even brewed strong, all it does is make the cake fantastically moist. It stood up to the heavy chocolate ganache I covered it with.

I used another recipe that called for cake flour, so the cake was light, fluffy, and super moist.  But everything else was the exact same!  It was AWESOME!  When I get back from the museum, I will be using the all-purpose flour.  I'm sure the cake is going to be a bit denser and even more DELICIOSO!

I made this cake as my first "from-scratch" cake, and it turned out wonderfully!  I actually made it into cupcakes, since I don't have two 9" pans or one big enough to fit all the batter.  I also cut down the sugar to 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, baked my cupcakes for 18 minutes, and was amazed!  Great recipe!

Deliciously moist! The coffee complements the chocolate perfectly. Great with cinnamon coffee frosting.

I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 oil. It needed to bake for 43 minutes. Definitely remember to grease the pans--even having greased them, it was a little tricky getting them out. This is now my go-to chocolate cake!

This was outstanding!  Everyone raved about it.  I subbed applesauce for the oil and used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar.  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  I tried a few chocolate chips, but they all sunk to the bottom because the batter was so thin, so next time I won't be adding them.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 40 min.  Once cooled, I frosted with a reduced fat/cal. cream cheese frosting.  So yummy!

Moist, I so much better than a box cake.  I did use 1 3/4c sugar instead of the 2c.  Also, used a cup of espresso coffee for a fuller flavor. Fantastic cake.

Excellent recipe. I made it into a bundt cake. It turned out good even though I messed it up. I forgot the oil!

I normally do not like chocolate cake, but as a chocolate lover i was dying to find a recipe i liked. this one took the cake =) made it for my mom's birthday, i was not sure if i made it right because my batter was not thin, but it came out perfect. frosted it right out of the oven with a simple chocolate whipped cream topping and ate it hot. even better the next day out of the fridge! =)

I do NOT like coffee, but I love this cake!  I thought I could taste the coffee flavor in anything, thereby eliminating it from the list of stuff I'll eat.  Try as I might, I could not detect the coffee in this cake.  It is moist and very delicious!

I like Kathy also got this recipe off an old hershey's cocoa tin! I still have the tin :).  This is a super moist cake and I made it years ago for our county fair and it went to state fair each year!  The tin also says that is you don't have buttermilk to use sour milk (i think it was milk and vinegar but I can't remember LOL)

Not the best... I made this for my sons third birthday and it sank in the oven.  I made an 8in round and 12 cupcakes.  It was best right out of the oven but after it cooled it wasn't nearly as good and pretty ugly.  I also substituted the water for coffee so maybe that was the problem.  If made with water like the recipe suggests I think it may have been quite bland.  This recipe needs to be revised for high altitude with an added kick of flavor.

As usual, I had to replace buttermilk with plain cow milk. Since I have only one pan, I put in 2/3 spoons baking powder.
I ended with the most fabulous moist cake ever. Some milk chocolate frost over it and for 3 days, we could pick some and still find it moist as if just done.
Thank you for this great recipe!

I think this is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made.  It was very moist.  However, I think it was too sugary.  Next time I want to reduce the sugar, and replace the coffee with hot chocolate.

This was a fantastic recipe. The cake was beautiful, moist, fragrant and tasted amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I also used the "Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting" recipe and it was a wonderful combination. My husband and I agree that box cakes are not for us anymore. This was great!

I just started baking...cupcakes, mainly. I really do not have extensive experience at all but this Black Magic Cake is frickin' AWESOME. It is super moist and so tasty. This is my favorite (and a keeper) of about 10 chocolate recipes that I have tried to make. It makes about 24 cupcakes (1/4 cup) @ 17-18 mins @ 350.

Perfection! Great velvety texture and awesome taste. I halved the recipe (even estimating on the flour and cocoa) and made cupcakes. They rose nicely and tasted great with cream cheese frosting. My husband said "best chocolate cake I've ever had."

Delicious. I overbaked them though :/ NOTE: I used splenda and that shortens the bake time...I made as cupcakes and frosted with the coolwhip frosting from this site. Yum!

This recipe is exactly what I thought it would be, one I had and lost a few years ago. However, this one is even moister and more flavorful than the other version was. Don't tell my in-laws--I'll just let my mother in law wonder what I'm doing right!

This cake was excellent! Very moist, very rich. It sliced very well and had a great texture. The batter IS very thin, but it bakes perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fabulous! I bake it often.. and with any of the following variations 1. A tablespoon each of Meyers Dark rum and Kahlua to the batter 2.Top it with Chocolate fudge. Make regular fudge  with coco, condensed milk ,sugar and butter, pour  over the cooled cake to set. Perfect for the die hard chocoholic! My children loved this cake with a Fudge topping studded with Smarties!  Please ensure you dont bake this cake in very deep cake tins, use the cake tins specified. Else they dont bake evenly.

This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe. Super moist and chocolately, can eat this without frosting even (but why would I do that). I did add some dark chocolate cocoa powder with the regular and made the coffee using really strong instant (about 3 heaping larger spoonfuls).

I've made this several times each Halloween and its a huge success.  For those having trouble with the thinness of the batter or can't taste the coffee flavor I suggest only using 1/4 cup of the buttermilk and then a full 8oz cup of coffee.  This will also cut back on the spongey texture of the cake but still keep it moiste.

Absolutely THE moistest, chocolaty-est cake EVER! We absolutely love this recipe!  I used the Coffee Butter Frosting to top off this perfect cake.  I've made it twice in 2 weeks and will make many, many more times!

This is basically the same recipe you use for Mexican chocolate sheet cake except that one has cinnamon and sour (3 parts milk 1 part vinegar) milk. It makes a delicious moist cake.

Delicious cake! I've made this 3 times in the past month. I substituted Baileys Caramel Liquor instead of the coffee. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% milk. I used just 1 cup of brown sugar packed instead of the 2 cups. I also added chocolate extract, and it makes it that much more chocolatey! Thanks!!

Great cake. Light, moist and not too rich. Will make again but will try with brown sugar. Oct 23/11 Update - I have made this cake several times now and all my guests love it. It is my husband's favorite cake.  It is a dark chocolate lovers dream. The negative reviews are probably from people that prefer milk chocolate. I can't think of any other reason that someone wouldn't love this cake. Also, white or brown sugar - doesn't matter - both are great.

I made this cake last night and it turned out good.  I do have to admit that I couldn't taste the coffee in the batter at all and I used some EXTREMELY strong coffee.  I don't see how it wouldn't show up in the flavor using a whole cup but it didn't.  To me it turned out like a regular chocolate cake. I ended up making some coffee butter frosting to top it and that turned out great.  It added just the right about of coffee flavoring to make it work out.

OMG, this is the best chocolate cake ever. Moist & rich. Whipped cream frosting is great, but, I'm going to have to try it with German Chocolate Cake Frosting next time.

AMAZING! Best chocolate cake I've ever had and people went NUTS for it! My grandmother called me the next day to say it's the best cake she and my aunt have ever had and I officially took over the role of best baker in the family. I used Caribou Obsidian coffee and Ghirardelli cocoa powder. Baked for 30 minutes and was perfect. Used a cream cheese frosting which really didn't compliment it very well but the cake was so good it didn't matter. Can't wait to make cupcakes with it! THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!!

First off, I have to say that I absolutely hate coffee, so I was really hesitant to put the coffee in, as I figured I would taste it.  Whenever I eat something with coffee flavoring, and someone says, "Oh you won't even taste it" - I taste it.  With this recipe I did not taste it at all.  The flavor of this cake is really good.  I made 24 cupcakes out of this and frosted them with a cream cheese frosting.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Wow, what a wonderful cake! The batter is thin, but it bakes up wonderfully. Great flavor and a perfect texture, very moist too. We paired it with Rich Chocolate Frosting for my mom's birthday, and the cake was a big hit. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This was amazing. I was very confused due to the thin batter, but wow! Like magic, it ROSE at least an inch. It was delicious, not overly sweet, and light! I have baked this cake about 3 times now. This recipe has never failed me!

To say this cake is delicious is an understatement. It is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. It is very moist and has a nice rich chocolate flavour nicely enhanced by the coffee. I'm not an experience cake baker, so I followed the recipe to a T and I see no need for any changes. I made two 9 inch round cakes and they were done in 30 minutes. "Rich chocolate frosting" from this site goes great with this cake!

I was very suspicious about the dough - it was very runny and liquid. Even after 15 minutes of baking it still seemed watery. But in the end it turned out wonderful!!! The cake tasted great and was like million bubbles! Great recipe!

Excellent taste and moistness.  Personally, my cakes were a little too airy and fell a bit in the middle, but I realize that temperature, humidty ect would have factored in.  I paired it with the cinnamon coffee frosting recipe found on this site and decorated it with drizzled meltered semi-sweet cholcolate chips and fresh raspberries, was complimented on, would make again.

Holy Cow- this is my new "go to" recipe for chocolate cake. It is EXCELLENT. Followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I used the peanut butter frosting recipe from this site for the filling and then topped it with the chocolate ganache and served with peanut butter ice cream- it was a WONDERFUL dessert!! Thanks for sharing such a great cake recipe!

I've made this cake on two seperate occasions. It has a very rich texture and has been enjoyed by everyone who tasted it. Instead of icing I made a glaze of 2 squares of unsweetened bakers chocolate, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of butter, about 2-4 cups of confectioners sugar (to taste), and milk (to get the consistency right). I just poured the glaze on the cake and let it drip off of the sides. The glaze settles very smooth and shiny making the cake look very proffesional.

I made 150 cupcakes for my friend's wedding using this recipe and they turned out great! Everyone loved them. I made them the day before and they were moist and delicious with a very chocolatey taste. The mixture is so quick to put together. Only half fill the cupcake cases with the mixture and bake for about 20 - 25 minutes.

Excellent chocolate cake.  I topped it with the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting from this site.  I wasn't crazy about the frosting so next time I will just dust it with some powder sugar.  Will definitely make this again.

Like the last reviewer, I've done quite a lot of baking- lots of chocolate birthday cakes- and bar none, this ranks as one of the best, easiest, and darkest homemade chocolate cakes I've ever made!  I did make a few minor changes due to the lack of availabilty of buttermilk the night I decided to try this recipe, and used strawberry yoghurt, a little more liquid and an extra egg to compensate.  It turned out great- light, airy, chocolaty with a hint of strawberry and the man and the kids loved it.

This is the moistest, richest chocolate cake - I can't wait to make it again.  Had it with vanilla cream filling/topping (whipping cream, milk, vanilla instant pudding mix), and it was sublime!

Couldn't be easier, and the results are moist, soft and tasty.  This time I made it I used in the Chocolate Torte recipe from this site (the one that calls for a boxed mix).   (Took a little longer than 30 mins to bake, using 2 cake pans; I definitely recommend letting the cake cool completely before removing.  First time I waited 15 mins and the cake fell apart coming out b/c it's so soft/moist so I remade the cakes and waited till cool, with success.)

This is it!!! this is IT!!!! I'm eating a piece right now and this is it!!! No more searching for another recipe!!!  My only concern is that it looks and tastes like a commercial cake-mix cake,  and I'm not sure if that's a good or bad. All I know is that this cake is good!  This is super easy, very quick, and very good! I'm a novice to cooking and baking and if I can do it, anyone can!

didn't think the cake was anything special by itself...the coffee made it a little sour, actually. frosting saved it. i put cherry chunks in the frosting, and it made it better, but was seriously disappointed in the cake after all of the rave reviews.

My mom has made this cake since I was a little girl, it is the absolute best chocolate cake ever!  I make it for my family now & they love it as well!  It is so moist you don't even need to frost it if you want something not too sweet, but of course if you're in a chocolate craving mood, chocolate frosting on it is fantastic, too!  I usually make this in my bundt pan.  I use for the coffee 2T instant coffee granules + water to =1cup & 1T white vinegar + milk to =1 cup sour/buttermilk.  It makes making the cake faster & I never have buttermilk on hand.  If you try this cake it will be a family tradition for your family, too, I am sure!  Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 12-inch octagon cake pan. It was perfectly done in just under 40 minutes. I used cake flour instead of regular flour and 2% milk mixed w/vinegar for the buttermilk. It came out excellent! Very moist and rich. This is a very dark chocolate cake, and the coffee really brings out the chocolate flavor. This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe....It's a definite winner!

This is the best chocolate cake ever!  I too was a little concerned when I saw how thin the batter was but it baked perfectly and was moist and delicious.  Wish there was a recipe for the frosting in the photo.  But I used a traditional choclate frosting and added melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and poured more than spread it over the cake.  I also added shredded semi-sweet chocolate to the top.  It was heaven.  This is a winner!

My oven is usually very hot so I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and baked a little longer. Took about 20-22 minutes for a batch (12) of cupcakes.

This is one of my favorite go to chocolate cake recipes.  It's great as is, but sometimes I make the following modifications:  I use plain fat free yogurt instead of the buttermilk and 1 cup of applesauce in lieu of the 1/2 cup of oil.  I then make 36 cupcakes and frost with the following recipe:   1/2 cup heavy cream; 1/2 stick unsalted butter, cut into several pieces; 1/8 teaspoon salt; 1/2 lb bittersweet chocolate; 1/8 cup hot water; 1 tea vanilla;  Heat cream, butter, sugar, n salt in saucepan until butter is melted. Add chocolate, cooking over very low heat until just melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from hat and blend in water and vanilla. Transfer frosting to a bowl to cool, stirring only occasionally, do not refrigerate before spreading on cake. Should be about an hour.  It will eventually thicken.  For me, this yields 36 cupcakes.  Using these changes, it comes out to approximately 165 calories per cupcake and you won't even miss the fat in the cupcake!

This cake was spectacular.  VERY moist.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used a tablespoon of lemon juice and the rest of the cup 2% milk.  I was worried but it worked out very well.  This will be the only chocolate cake recipe I use in the future.

In a word, this is AMAZING! The best chocolate cake I have ever tasted, & my family agrees.  I suggest using really good rich/gourmet coffee and high quality cocoa, it makes a big difference (after all a recipe is only as good as the ingredients you use). I tried this exactly as the recipe states the 1st time and the 2nd time & every time since in order to cut down on the fat, I replace about 3/4 of the oil called for with applesauce, and use reduced fat buttermilk. You CANNOT tell the difference! However, I recommend that if you do make the above changes that you mix the batter only until completely blended. If you mix it for the 2 minutes called for the cake falls apart when you remove it from the baking pan. Also, definitely let it cool for the full 10 minutes before transferring it to the cooling rack, otherwise you'll lose the bottom layer of the cake as it stays stuck to the pan regardless of how well you grease it.  Also even though an inserted tooth-pick come out clean after 30 minutes, I found that it needs the full 40 minutes otherwise it's a bit doughy in the center. TRY THIS RECIPE! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

Awesome cake! Super easy to make just added 1 tsp on cinnamon and double the vanilla extract. Used the Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site which finished it off perfectly.  Took it to my garden club meeting and it was gone in seconds, same thing when I took it to work. Make sure you bring the recipe with you, everyone asks for it.
UPDATE: I now add 1/8 tsp of chilli powder as well as 1 tsp. cinnamon...really make a difference.

Very good cake with nice dark presentation for Halloween.  I forgot to add the vanilla extract but we don't miss it.  I decorated this cake with black icing dripping off the top, a sparkly gel spider web, and a big black gum paste spider.  Hubby and I both agreed that we prefer this cake chilled.

One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made.  I used cocoa that I got at an Amish Grocery called "Black Cocoa Powder XTra Rich"  it is really dark and the cake came out almost true black. I did use wax paper in the bottom of my pans and had no trouble getting the cake out.  Thanks for a great recipe

Wow!  This was so good!  It has become my family's most requested cake.  It was easy, moist, flavourful, rich and dense. I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site.  It was as easy (but way better) than a cake mix.

This was a great cake, moist and easy to make, and I had no problems; it didn't stick to the pan.  I filled it with Chocolate Ganache and topped it with Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting.  It was a great hit.  A chocolate lover's dream. My Mom used to make a similar cake, and I'm thinking this one may be better (sorry, Mom).  My neighbor forced me to give her the recipe.

I will be the 446th person to review this and among the majority.  This cake is amazing! It is not too sweet, very dark, very moist, and very fluffy.  I will be making this again and again.  I used Pumpkin flavored coffee, I don't really taste it, but it's nice and fragrant.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully.  I iced it with "One Minute Chocolate Icing" from this site.  Happy Baking!

Amazing! I accidentally used 2 cups of flour but it turned out fine. It was so moist that I had to be careful when taking it out of the pan because it was stuck to the bottom, but otherwise no problems.  My husband was sceptical about the coffee, but you can't taste it at all - the best homemade (from scratch) chocolate cake I've had!

This truly is the perfect chocolate cake! I'll be making this for many birthdays and events in the future :o) I followed the recipe exactly, even using sour milk (2 T. of vinegar to 1 cup of milk) for the buttermilk and it turned out perfectly. Thanks so much!

I only had Dutch process cocoa on hand, so I used that, and the cake still came out perfectly. Thanks to other reviews I didn't panic at the thin batter! The cake was moist with a deep chocolate flavor. I made a 13x9 cake and topped it with Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting. Everyone loved it, and it was so easy to make.

I have tried a number of chocolate cake recipes and always thought that something was missing from the other recipes. I finally found the perfect chocolate cake recipe! I've got nothing to say but: AMAZING! It's the best chocolate cake I have ever made and the best part is, it's so easy! Thank you!

I baked this cake for a birthday and everybody raved about it.  I could not tell the kids there was coffee added or they would not have tried it but nobody noticed any coffee taste.  It just complimented the chocolate.

This thing is so BLACK! It is a VERY MOIST and RICH chocolate cake and it is what a chocolate cake should taste like!! Love it so much. I decreased the sugar from 2 cups to one and one half cup. It has the perfect sweetness. Now, I just made the Chocolate Ganache from this site and I used low fat milk instead of cream (what was I thinking) and it turned out very runny and I don't think I can glaze the cake with this but it's still sitting in the fridge hoping it will thicken up a little enough to glaze the cake.

Absolutely delicious cake! I made it into a Black Forest Cake by adding a large can of cherry pie filling in the center of my 2 layers. I also topped it off by making the fudge icing and dropping a few cherries on top for decoration. I did take the advice of another on here and stuck it in the freezer for 10 minutes so it could handle better. It did not fall apart but the center fell a little. It was nothing the fudge topping could not cover though. The party I made it for raved over it. I will most definitely make this again.

Great Cake! I was not sure about it when I looked inside the oven about 30 min. into the cooking. It was real liquid and I was for sure I did something wrong. It continued cooking and came out great. I served it at a party and everyone couldn't believe how moist it was.

As another reviewer mentioned, it is the exact same recipe as the hershey's cake, except that instead of the plain water, it uses coffee and instead of the milk it's buttermilk. Does it make much of a difference? Not sure. Both are great cakes! The coffee does add some richness to it, just make sure it's EXTRA strong. I used 2 tsp instant coffee in boiling water. You can feel the coffee flavour, but in a good way, which hightenened the chocolate flavour. Really great moist delicious satisfying cake!

This was great, a little crumbly but was fine after a few hours in the fridge. Also i didnt have butter milk in the house so i used 1 cup of 1% and it was fine and a little healthier.

So easy and everyone loved it!  The only thing that I waited on was the coffee to cool, but I just put it in the freezer to cool it faster.  Made with a chocolate ganache frosting, it was irresistible!

This is an amazing cake.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!  The only thing I changed was I put in 1 1/2 cups of sugar rather than 2.  I didn't even have to frost it, it was so good!  Thank you for the recipe.

AMAZING! I used 7 minute icing w/ coconut extract and sprinkled coconut between the layers and all over the cake.  It was so delicious; definitely restaurant-worthy! I've already been requested to make it again this weekend.  Try it, you won't be sorry!

After making this as cupcakes for a friend to take to work, I was immediately asked to bake a gradutation cake; then two birthday cakes; and finally cake for 150 for a 6th grade ceremony!  A lot of people really, really love this recipe and tell me that it is the best chocolate cake that they've ever had.  This one will be my standard chocolate cake from now on.  Thanks!!

My mom made this cake for us since the '70s and it was a special request for our birthdays.  This is one cake I will always keep in my recipe box.  Delicious with coconut pecan icing, chocolate ganache, or seven-minute frosting.

I've made this recipe three times and I absolutely LOVE it, as does everyone else in my family. The third time I made cupcakes out of these instead of the cake. It made about fourteen and took around fifteen minutes to finish. I passed these out at the coffee shop I work at, they were gone in five minutes.  I suggest that readers experiment with this recipe by using different flavors of coffee. I've tried a Hazelnut blend and it tasted delicious.

I'm a 22-year-old who's got a passion for cakes, and every time I experiment I'm the only one who ends up eating what I bake. Ha, that rhymes. Anyway, my family's not big on these kinds of treats. However, this recipe was a big success! I decided to make cupcakes so I could experiment with toppings. Dad, who NEVER eats anything I bake (even when I gave him decorated cookies or cakes when I was little, he would say there was too much sugar and he just couldn't stomach it) devoured 4 plain cupcakes before I could make my toppings. Later in the day, I made chocolate ganache and some plain whipped cream (just a little sugar, no vanilla) and used those to fill and top the little cakes. Dad so far has been sticking to the ganache-topped cakes, and mom likes the cream-filled (cut out a piece of the center and filled) with ganache drizzled on top. They're definitely a dessert, but not so sweet that you're unhappy taking that last bite. TIP: chilling the cupcakes makes handling much easier! The liners come off nice and clean for a more "presentable" look.

This is the recipe that has finally shown me that from-scratch cakes can be as moist and better tasting than boxed mixes.I had almost given up on scratch cakes because they always disappointed me, but this is super moist, dark, and fudgy- but not super dense. It taste's like it came from a restaurant.

Now this was delicious!  The consistency was perfect, moist yet light and airy.  I used a silicone bundt pan instead of 9x13 or 2 cake pans. I was going to put a chocolate mousse frosting on it but when I took it out of the pan it looked too darn pretty to cover up with the frosting.  Instead I put a paper doily over it and sprinkled lightly with confectioners sugar, how beautiful! I also used chocolate truffle coffee since that was all I had on hand. This will be my only chocolate cake recipe from now on!

I have a friend's "secret family recipe" for black magic cake which I seemingly misplaced, so I found this one on Allrecipes.  I then found my recipe and surprise surprise, it's the same recipe except for one thing ... the "secret family recipe" calls for 2 tsps of vanilla instead of one.  Other than that, EXACTLY the same.  SO, I can say with no hesitation that this is the BEST chocolate cake ever.  It is so chocolately, so yummy, so moist, so yummy, that it's unbelievable.  I make it in a bundt pan and use homemade cream cheese frosting which offsets the chocolate perfectly.  Try it (if you can get a piece before everyone else eats it up!).... you won't be sorry!

This cake was fantastic!  Moist and rich without an over-powering chocolate flavor, which is what I was looking for.  I did make one little change of necessity.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I soured a cup of regular milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar.  It turned out so well that I've continued to just sour milk rather than use buttermilk as the recipe calls for.  I've made this several times now.  I generally frost this with a vanilla whipped frosting and put sliced strawberries and mangos in-between and on top.  I also put parchment paper in the bottoms of the pans because the cake is very moist.     Have to add that the last few times I've made this I've been putting a thin layer of Chocholate Ganache Icing, set it in the fridge to set and then a layer of Whipped Cream Icing and it's simply amazing.

Outstanding! I filled it with cherry pie filling and iced it with mocha whipped cream. We shared what we could stand to part with and ate the rest -- and we were sad to see the last piece go.

I'm a beginner at baking and tried this recipe. The cake turned out perfect: very soft and moist. I followed the advice from other reviewers and used a parchment paper which definitely eased the process of taking out the cake from the cake pan. I'd used a 9 X 13 pan. This cake definitely needs an icing as it has a little less sugar so icing compensates for the lack of sugar. I used the "coffee icing" available at this site. I rate it 4 star as even though the cake was excellent it didn't have a perceptible coffee taste.

Love this cake. I only wish I had read a few of the reviews that warned how moist it is, because mine did stick in the pan a little. Oh well, frosting hides a multitude of sins. Or as my daughter says, "Mom your cakes may not be pretty, but they sure are delicious!"

This cake had a wonderful flavor, and was very moist.  Even though I love frosting, I have to agree with others; this cake didn't need it.  Next time I make it I may only put a dusting of powdered sugar on top.  If you are going to remove this cake from it's pan and decorate it, be careful; it's so moist that it cracks and breaks easily.

The best chocolate cake recipe ever!  As stated, the batter is pretty runny, but this bakes into the most moist cake! I am always being asked to bring "that chocolate cake" to get-togethers.

I Love this recipe, and now my friends, co-workers and family do as well. It was a breeze to make, and came out perfect, I changed nothing the first time - One of the most moist cake recipes.
As a twist try this: Make this in cup cakes pans, carve out bottom, and fill with marshmellow filling or twinkie cream, and dip top in melted chocolate. Fantastic!  I made this as my final when getting my pastry chef certification, and my Chef at the time loved it, and ran home and made the cake - she wrote to tell me it too came out Great.  Again this recipe is a real winner.

Divine, ironically... certainly amongst the best cakes I've ever had.  

The recipe came out perfectly and needs no modifications.  It's fairly important to test the consistency with a toothpick; it looks done before it actually is.  Doing so, it came out moist and didn't collapse.

We used fresh espresso and it had a wonderfully balanced coffee flavor, and topped with a kahlua frosting.

Thank you Marsha!

This is a great cake -- moist and tasty.  It rose beautifully.  No one believed that it was from scratch (and that IS a complement!).  Very nice with the Coffee Cinnamon Frosting.

I will X this recipe by 1 1/2 and it will make enough for two 10" rounds.  A-MAZING.  Easy to prepare and exceptionally versatile.  I've used this cake as a base for German Chocolate cake, Black Forest cake and as a regular cake, frosted with everything from White Mountain Frosting to an Espresso Buttercream.  Thank you for such a fab recipe!!!

This is so good! I made it as a bunt cake for Halloween, bore holes in it with a spoon and stuck in Chocolate Mice submitted by Rosina. Everyone was afraid to eat it but once they did they couldn't stop! Excellent chocolate cake!!!

FABULOUS.  I made this with the cinnamon mocha frosting from this site for my hb's birthday.  Slid right out of the pans.  Dense and moist but not gluey and rich and chocolatey without being too sweet.  A really excellent and easy cake.  I made a different mocha cake for my hb every year and this was the best tasting so far - it was ugly - but who cares?  I still give it five stars.

I made this for my colleague's birthday at work - it was wonderful! It didn't even need frosting. I made it in a bunt pan and baked it for 45 minutes - came out perfect! Also, instead of flouring the pan with flour, I used unsweetened cocoa so it wouldn't show on the outside of the cake (a tip I'd heard through the grapevine)... great idea! I sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. Everyone raved about it.

After reading the reviews, I thought I'd try this one since my friend requested a chocolate cake for his birthday. I was kind of disappointed.  I usually make box cakes and everyone loves them.  The cake partially stuck to the pan and since I wasn't going to frost it, I had to make a trifle out of it to salvage it.  I'm sure everyone will like the trifle but I wouldn't bother next time.  Back to box cakes for me.

The BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever made and that my family has ever eaten.  I halved the recipe to make brownie-sized servings, and it turned out fabulous.  Does not need frosting, only powdered sugar dusted across the top, but I did make the Coffee Frosting, seen on this site, and I adjusted the recipe to have a stronger coffee flavor.  This cake is fabulous, and I recommend it to anyone who has a chocolate craving!  So easy, and all the ingredients are in your cupboards and fridge!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! Never knew a chocolate cake that tasted so good, could be so easy to make.  The amount of sugar needed was just right- I halved the suagr the first time and regretted it later. This is one of the cakes I will make for Christmas.  Marsha, if you are the "Marsha" who posted the Cinnabon recipe, (folks, you MUST make those) thanks for some wonderful recipes.

Fantastic! Super moist, super rich. My family loved it. I used half cake flour, half all-purpose to make cake a little lighter and then topped with a buttercreme mocha frosting. Yummm...

This is the moistest and most delicious cake I've ever tasted! My whole family loved it. I paired this with a coffee butter frosting (which can be found on this site, made by GINGER P) which made it taste AMAZING! However, if you use that frosting, make sure to double the recipe, and use 6 Tbsp of cocoa powder and coffee instead of 2 for the best results.

Best chocolate cake ever in the history of cake making!!!  I've made this recipe for over 40 years and I've never found one I've considered better.  I've made chocolate frosting, covered the cake with whipped cream, or just a dusting of powdered sugar.  It's very moist and very delicious.

Very moist, delicious cake. Used 1/4 cup oil and a 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  Turned out great.

I loved it. I as most recipes reduced the sugar and it was just perfect. It was done in the 30 min which for me is a first I have had to always add 5 to 10 mins. this recipe was easy and all that tasted it want me to bake for them. after years of not baking it was the best start.

This is by far the best cake I’ve ever made (and I’ve made my fair share). My husband and I made this yesterday for my birthday. Our extended family raved on about it. We celebrate every single birthday in our family, about 11, so we get 11 cake experiences a year....many good, many not so good (usually store bought). My father in law said we were now in charge of making all the birthday cakes from now on (and he doesn’t give compliments lightly!). We followed the directions exactly,  and took on the reviews to sift the dry ingredients and grease the pans liberally, that was it...everything else was followed to a T. I was scared of the cup of strong coffee...but you couldn’t even tell. I did, however, use coffee buttercream frosting (from this site) which had a very powerful coffee taste. It paired well with it, but next time I think I will use a cream cheese frosting, so it’s not so sweet.
I finally found the chocolate cake recipe I’ve been searching for all these years. 
Thank you for sharing it!

Definite 5 stars for the rich and wonderful flavor, but way too sweet for out tastes.  Works well with just 1 cup of sugar for those of us with less of a sweet tooth.  Also used freshly brewed  espresso for the coffee part, it really enhanced the chocolate flavor.

I made a 1/2 recipe (9x9 pan) and baked for 25 minutes.  This is the third time I've made this cake and it's easy and foolproof.  I didn't change one thing (and I change every recipe!).  Husband said "excellent"!!!

I made half of this recipe and baked it in a round cake pan, then sliced it horizontally to make two layers and fill and frost.  This recipe is easily amenable to making smaller portions in this way, and it's so good that a friend of mine who is hands down the best baker I know asked for the recipe!

My "go to" chocolate cake.  Always comes out great.  I have used this recipe for cakes and cupcakes.  Always rave reviews.  Instead of buttermilk, (b/c I always end up throwing some out), I add a T. of lemon juice to 1 cup milk. Perfection.

Wow!!! I wasn’t expecting much from this cake but this has to be the best cake recipe I’ve ever used. The cake was so dark and moist and perfectly chocolate-y. I used a cream cheese frosting and a chocolate ganache to frost. I dropped one of the cake layers so I only got to make a one layer cake but it was still delicious! I recommend whole heartily!

I've been making this recipe for many years now after finding it on here. It truly is wonderful, and holds up to the most intense decorating without ever being heavy or dry....moist, with a lovely crumb and chocolate flavor. I ran out of regular cocoa one time and had to use my special dark cocoa powder which was just as good. We love this cake!!!!! I  used it for my daughter's baby shower cake!!

I have been making this cake for years.....cakes, cupcakes and bundt cakes and all have turned out fabulous! Did two for mother's day, one with cream cheese frosting and one with fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site 
Batter is super  quick and easy and if I'm in a pinch for a dessert, this is my go to and I have never substituted anything.
I use Hershey's special dark cocoa and  use 2 instant coffee  packets, dissolved in about 1/4 cup hot water in a 1 cup measuring cup and then fill with cold water because I would always forget to make coffee ahead of time.  I also add eggs,  oil, buttermilk, vanilla and coffee to a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup and whisk mixture then just pour it into dry ingredients and beat until just incorporated.
Having room temp eggs is key, and I also tap pans on counter to get rid of excess air in batter.
Your batter will be runny!  Trust me once you bake you'll have the best choice cake ever!

I added espresso instead of just plain coffee and I think this is the best cake ive ever made. It was super moist and tasted heavenly. I put a cream cheese frosting on it and figured out why its called Black Magic Cake. I turned around and it had disappeared!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I've made it twice, both times as cupcakes, and my family went crazy for them. The cake is moist and has a bold, rich cocoa flavor. I doubt I will make any other chocolate cake again. For cupcakes, mine took around 14 minutes to bake.

Made as called for - perfect. Moist and chocolatey.  As others have said, the batter is very, very thin.  When I first took the layers out of the oven they were domed, but it settled as it cooled.  The cakes were done at the minimum bake time suggested.  Also, I lined the bottom of each pan with parchment paper which I sprayed with cooking spray.  The cakes released from the pan easily.  I was careful to peel off parchment paper - I think if I would have simply ripped it up and off the cake could have crumbled some, but I did not have any issues doing it slowly.  When cooled, the layers were easy to move and assemble.
 I used the recipe from here for mint buttercream frosting (with chocolate glaze, but I did not use that part of that recipe).  I made  my own chocolate ganache which I whipped and used as the filling between the 2 -9 inch layers.  I'd recommend using good quality cocoa and the flavor will be even better.  Nummy

I have been making this cake for years and can't believe I haven't left a review yet! This cake is absolutely perfect--chocolatey, moist, not overly sweet, and super quick to make. It's very forgiving recipe too. I usually substitute butter for the oil and use 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. It turns out great every time. And it goes great with any and all frostings! I will be making this recipe many many many more times!

I do cupcakes sometimes and they are DELICIOUS! We LOVE this recipe. Try it. The taste is amazingly rich and chocolaty, if you do not like chocolate this is not the recipe for you. But if you are like me and you LOVE chocolate then this is the cake for you! We use "creamy chocolate frosting" it turns out amazing.

This is an amazing chocolate cake. I’ve been searching for one that is dense and moist and chocolatey and this hit all those notes. I didn’t even frost it but my husband I devoured it alone in 24 hours! And we were exercising restraint :) husband doesn’t really even like chocolate cake usually. One thing I will say, it seems incredibly delicate so it might be a little hard to work with to ice and decorate. I’ll be trying it again in a few weeks for my sons birthday. But this will definitely be my go to chocolate cake recipe forever!

Baking cakes not one of my talents, but this recipe was amazing!  We liked the cake part so much we didn't even bother with icing - just ate it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The 1st time I made it I didn't grease the pans enough, but it still came out okay even with a few bits staying behind.  Corrected the mistake the 2nd time with lots of butter on the pans.  For those of you who have described various "disasters" with this cake, you might want to check your process.  This is probably the 3rd cake I've made in my entire life, and it turned out great for me.

I have made this cake about 5 times since I discovered the recipe less than one year ago.  I have shared this recipe with compliments.  This is by far the BEST chocolate cake I’ve ever had in all my 41 years.  The coffee perfectly enhances the chocolate flavor and I love a piece of this cake plain or with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  This cake is both moist and light with a perfect crumb.  I want some now!

omg!!! i cook for a mismatched house on average of no less than 6 people who love chocolate...i've tried all different recipes & brownies are usually the fav...til stumbling upon this one when looking for a birthday cake to make for one of them the other day...i've made it 4 times in just the last week!!!  everyone loves it..can't go a single day without it being requested at least 3-4 times...now rather than just make one at a time, i'm making it twice a night...the first gets ate by the house & the other, if not eaten before i get home the next day, is gladly given to friends...would recommend this one to everyone!!! enjoy!!!

This is the recipe my grandmother used for years, it’s wonderful! I make it exactly as written, it yields a beautifully light and chocolatey cake. I recommend pairing with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Icing recipe on this site, it’s my husband’s favorite!

I doubled the recipe and made a 3-layer 9" cake. Frosted with a chocolate butter cream and swirled in caramel sauce in between the layers. Drizzled a little more caramel on top of the cake and sprinkled with some flakey sea salt. Rally great

Made it as-written and ended up with an extremely rich, delicious, dark chocolate cake and the flavor only gets better when set in the fridge for a day. Don't fret if the batter looks runny, it firms up well. They're pretty tough to get out of the pan in one piece though, using cut parchment paper on the bottom and giving them extra cooling time is highly recommended.

EDIT: Note unrelated to the score, but attempting to substitute half the oil for butter yields no better taste and only a more crumbly cake, should you get the idea.

Read the reviews and followed advice to heavily grease and flour pans. Cake still stuck to the bottom. Parchment on the bottom is necessary. Cake was moist and taste was rich chocolate. Sorry to say since it would not flip I had to crumble it and layer it with icing and strawberries. People thought it was good but, not worth the hassle. This is NOT a keeper for me.

This cake is The Bomb just as it is. No alterations necessary. This great cake keeps really nicely and actually improves in flavour a day or two after baked.

I have been making this cake for years and it always comes out Great . I have made a few changes over the years I use butter instead of oil and I melt the sugar down with Hot coffee and let cool before adding to mix. Plus it never hurts to add a little extra coffee if you like real moist . Enjoy

Excellent chocolate cake. Very moist and rich. I followed the recipe as written but only had a bundt pan. Took 35 minutes to bake. Turned out perfect. I made the coffee butter frosting to top it. Delicious!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made!! I decided to try something new for my husbands birthday this year, so I made this cake and topped it with the fluffy peanut butter icing from this site.......the best cake ever!! I'm about to make it again in a few days for my son's 16th birthday (per his request). He just likes a plain buttercream icing though. I can't wait to eat it again. I didn't change a thing and I won't this time either!!

This is my go to chocolate cake. I bake for a many of my  neighbors who are having parties and this has become one of the most requested cakes. The flavor is so good that I will typically make it in a bundt pan and finish it off with a dark chocolate ganache. Perfect dessert!

Didn't change a thing, perfect dark, flavorful chocolate cake.  Use good cocoa, it matters a LOT here, the cake is only as good as the ingredients.   I don't need any other recipe ever again.

Two years later, I'm back using this recipe again and again.  This is one of the only recipes that I follow to the letter.  Can't change it, it's perfect.

Love this recipe! I use one batch of this to make 72 mini-cupcakes. I bake each tray of 24 mini-cupcakes for 11 minutes, and they are so moist and light. This is my go-to recipe for chocolate cupcakes.

I made this cake for my daughters baby shower. I didn't make any changes but followed the recipe as written. I don't know how anybody could not like this cake.... It was a HUGE hit. I made 4 layers and frosted with Creamy Chocolate Frosting by Tracey Larsen and it was WONDERFUL. I did not double the recipe but made it twice. They came out the same each time I made it. As mentioned the batter will be thin. It took 35 minutes for them to cook in my oven. It was wonderful how you can just add all ingredients and GO! I can't wait to have a reason to make this again!

Nice, moist, dark and very quick to put together. I have a few chocolate cakes that I like as much or more taste-wise, but this one is so simple it can be thrown together while fixing dinner. I cool it for 30 minutes, put in the freezer for 15, and it's cool enough to frost. This is an update, since I make this cake often. I noticed that some cooks think it is not chocolatey enough. Be sure to use natural cocoa, not dutch processed. Dutch process, treating cocoa with an alkaloy,  makes it very dark, but removes much of the nice cocoa flavor and fragrance. If you have both, open them and give a sniff...no comparison.

Me and my husband absolutely ADORE this cake.  It's moist, rich, chocolate-y, and the BEST chocolate cake.  A simple vanilla cream cheese frosting is all it needs. We drank a cup of black coffee with it after dinner. Nummy!

I made this a few months ago now, but I bought it to a party and made a big impression, my aunty said something like "you could win any girls heart with this cake".
The coffee flavor is subtle.
I like to take out 25grams of flour and replace it with cornflour/cornstarch.  This lowers the protein content and makes the cake more moist.

I made this for my daughter's birthday when she requested a 'really chocolate-y cake.'  I topped it with a chocolate butter cream frosting and put a layer of chocolate ganache in the middle and pressed dark chocolate chips into the sides.  It fulfilled her request!  And was a crowd pleaser for everyone.

Delicious, light, moist and very easy to make - only requires using a mixing bowl and is ready in no time. I will definitely make again!  My new favourite chocolate cake recipe!
Note: I used buttermilk powder mix and soy oil (instead of vegetable oil) and it still turned out great!

I've made this many times and it never fails.  It's dense, moist, and chocolately. As described, the batter will be thin, but no worries, it bakes up perfectly.  I love that it doesn't 'hump' up, or round off in the middle too much when you bake it so you get a professional looking cake.  This is my recipe for chocolate cake, full stop.

I made this cake today and it was one of the best cakes I've ever made!  I used espresso instead of regular brewed coffee  and my goodness it was delicious ! I made a fluffy white frosting using egg whites and added almond extract for flavoring . The combination of chocolate, almond and espresso is one of my favorite treats!  I too like another reviewer was a little worried about how thin the batter was but it baked up beautifully . I had a shaken iced espresso to go with mine , I'm going to have to skip a meal or two after all this good indulgence though !

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday. I used coconut Palm sugar, just because I don buy white. Also made strong decaf French vanilla coffee and used 1 cup lactaid milk with a tbs. of vinegar instead of regular buttermilk. Very moist and really tasty.

Amazing - I've gotten nothing but compliments.  In fact, my Mother-In-Law loved this so much, she is replacing her regular go-to cake recipe with this one.  I made mine in an 11x15 baking dish, and used a simple chocolate icing on it.  Loved it and am definitely making it again.  I would make it right now but I ran out of cocoa!

I used self rising flour, decreased the amount of baking soda and increased the amount of vanilla. My guests opinion were that the cake was tasteless.

I bake cakes a few times a week, every week. I've tried so many different chocolate cake recipes and I always come back to this one.  It's super easy, moist, great texture, deep dark chocolate flavor and just plain delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.  This is so easy to throw this recipe together,it will not take much longer than if you used a cake mix. Seriously.....and you don't even need a mixer. I just use a large bowl and a whisk. The batter will seem super thin but don't worry, that is what it's supposed to be like.  It will bake up nice and fluffy. It is a very dark chocolate flavor but it's still sweet, not bitter at all. Don't hesitate about adding coffee, you won't taste a coffee flavor at all. It just intensifies the chocolate flavor.

Baked this cake to specific instructions above: This cake would be just as good without frosting. Cake is moist, very flavorful, and will definitely be my "go to" cake for any chocolate based cake.

This is without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever had. A few weeks ago my dad requested for his birthday a chocolate cake with white icing and coconut. I made this cake with the coconut buttercream icing recipe from this site. The cake is very delicate so you have to be careful when removing it from the pans. And make sure to grease and flour the pans really well to prevent it from sticking. The cake came out so moist and delicious. My mom already requested it for her birthday!

Yes this is a very moist, wonderful cake. I have made this twice now to rave reviews. My only advice is let the cakes cool for 20 minutes. First time I tried to make this cake, I tried to remove from pan after 10 minutes and nearly
lost a layer. I waited another 10 for the second layer and came out of the pan much easier. First cake frosted with a coconut cream cheese frosting and second one made a German Chocolate Cake. Even the non-chocolate lover loved it.

Leave it in the pan for 20 minutes, it's damp on the bottom but keeps the cake so super moist and so super easy!

Omg this cake is fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly except for the buttermilk. I didn't have buttermilk so put 1 Tbs white vinegar in 1 cup (minus 1 Tbs) of 1% milk. All the rave reviews on this cake were spot on. I will make this cake over and over. It was so easy to make too. Like another reviewer said, you only need a whisk for this batter. I tried to use my kitchenaid stand mixer and the batter was so thin that it went everywhere. Still, the mess was completely worth it. Amazing cake! Thanks for sharing!

This classic, decades-old recipe is my favorite cake in the universe.  One note, though...due to the chemical composition of this cake, the batter rises A LOT when baking.  When making small forms like mini-bundt cakes, fill the forms no more than halfway or the batter will expand and spill all over your stove.

My first time making it- it took a few minutes longer than recipie states but I also, as I do when I bake- I shift the pans around 1/2 way through the bake time to give it an even bake. The center looks soft and the batter does go in very "wet" and thin but the final texture seems to be very soft. I had no issue with removing from pan. Set on stove top for about 15 then inverted onto wire racks for nearly 2 hours to fully cool. I complimented it with a dark choc. cream cheese butter frosting. I used Hersheys DARK Chocolate cocoa for my choice in both cake and frosting- it turned out great. I forgot to buy new pastry bags for some fancier decorating this time but it was just fine with a thick frosting and spoon back for lift.

Crazy WICKED good. Exact same recipe as Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake but with buttermilk instead of milk, coffee instead of hot water, and 1 tsp less of vanilla. Either way is good but this is TOPS. Very chocolatey. I couldn't stand it if it had any more chocolate! It got better and more moist each day. Perfect. I used the recipe that goes with the Hersheys cake. My kids went bonkers over it. =) I said it was too much chocolate the first day...but kept going back...by the 3rd day I concluded this was my new addiction and I don't even like chocolate like that.

I made this cake for my daughters birthday and my grandfathers birthday a few weeks later. It was fabulous and everyone loved it. I did not have any of the issues that the negative reviewers had and I followed the recipe exactly. The first time I made it with 2 rounds and a cherry filling in the middle. (1 can of black cherries with the juice, 1/4c butter, 1/4c sugar, and a few tbsp flour to thicken it up) The second time I made the 9x13 1 layer. Both turned out great. It took the full 40 min to cook.

I have made this several times and it is such a great and easy cake to wow my husband with. I like to make two small cakes with one batch and then freeze the second one. I just let it sit on the counter until thawed and it is just like it came out of the oven.  I also use spelt flour instead of wheat, which is better for your digestion and if you may be diabetic.

Perfect. Just... perfect. Like others stated I was put off by the thin batter. I'm such a kitchen klutz (and a regular klutz) that I figured I had missed a step or ingredient somewhere. Convinced that the cake was ruined, I took the loss and put it into the stove anyway. What came out after nearly 55 minutes (40 minutes wasn't enough. The cake was still really wet) was pure bliss. It was chocolaty. It was moist. My mom thoroughly enjoyed it, though initially she wanted nothing to do with the cake out of fear that it would taste like coffee (but who doesn't like coffee? Weird). I couldn't find a single hint of it in the cake. Just a rich chocolate flavor. Too bad in my hurry I opted for frosting-in-a-can. Nothing wrong with it, but I'd love to make a frosting that pairs with it. Definitely my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

Made this cake as instructed and found it absolutely AMAZING! The only thing I didn't like was the extreme rising of the middle. The second time I made it was in a 9x13 glass pan and I lowered to temp to 325. That time it took longer to bake, however there was no crowning and it came out more like brownies, which was fine for all of us. I think I prefer the chewy brownie like texture over the moist cake I had the first time. It was much easier to eat and didn't fall apart.

The very best chocolate cake I have ever made. I consider myself a very experienced baker with a treasure chest of old-world, family recipes, as well as some very good chocolate cakes from various cook books, specialty cake books, pastry chefs, etc. Nothing came close to this.

I made it for a dinner party and topped the cake with a French mousseline frosting. Unbelievable. I could have eaten it just as well plain. Every single guest said it was the best cake they had ever tasted, and each had a second piece.

My spouse, who is not one for sweets, polished it off the next day and said that, by far, this was the best chocolate cake I've made in the 28 years we've been together.

Thank you so much for contributing this recipe.

I've just made this today and it's super tasty and moist! I iced it with whipped cream and cherry syrup (fresh cherries+sugar+shimmering) to balance the sweetness of it... Needless to say it was an instant hit! I just can't wait to try different icing combinations with it! I will keep this recipe for sure, thank you for sharing!

This cake is my go to recipe without a doubt!  It always turns out so moist and rich regardless of whether I make cupcakes, a two layer round, a quarter sheet or a bundt.  It is so easy to throw together, too.  The only substitution I make is to use vinegar to make sour milk as I don't buy buttermilk because it usually always goes to waste before I can use it all.  I made a bundt today with a caramel glaze frosting from this site and my 5 yr old son told me, "this cake is the bomb!"  Thanks Marsha for a wonderful, wonderful chocolate cake recipe that I can always count on to come out right!

Absolutely a keeper!  This is very similar to a recipe my friend (who bakes cakes for a living) gave me, and it comes out perfectly each time!  One tip:  use the best quality cocoa you can find.  I found European cocoa powder and bought a huge tub at Costco - perfect and so delicious!  I'm actually baking another cake right now, lol.

This is SO GOOD. Deep chocolate flavor (I replaced two teaspoons of the coffee with chocolate extract that I received for my birthday). It was so delicious. I made a batch of cupcakes to test the recipe for an upcoming birthday party. Someone else said they made cupcakes and baked at 350 for 22 minutes - that worked perfectly for me.

The first time I used a 9x13 pan and it sunk so badly in the middle that it took up two inches of frosting to cover the indention.

The second time I used two 9-inch round pans and the batter overflowed, burnt to a char on the bottom of the oven and filled the kitchen with smoke. 

This last time I used two large square pans. The cake didn't overflow, but it still sunk in the middle to half the height of the sides. When I tried to invert the pans onto a cooling rack a third of the cake was still stuck to the bottom of the pans.

I followed the recipe to the letter, including using only Hershey's cocoa. I'm curious how other people seemed to get such good results.

I did this cake for the second time yesterday and it came out perfect like the first time. I never had any cake that moist, the taste is spectacular and it is just fantastic. It doesn't really need frosting, I would love it with some berries and fresh whipped cream or icecream. I love this cake and i really think it is the best i ever had.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It is dense and so flavorful. I paired it with a Mint icing. Excuse the mess on the plate but I am not a pro and well... this is how I roll. LOL

Highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves chocolate.

Wonderful Moist cake.  I added 1 ounce of dark melted chocolate to the batter.  I also did not have buttermilk so I used 1/4 cup regular milk and 1/4 cup sour cream instead. I frosted it with the chocolate sour cream frosting from this site and it was divine. Everyone loved it! My 3 year old kept saying "MMMMM this good momma" the whole time he ate it! Update 7/4/19.......  Since reviewing this recipe several years ago this has become my go to chocolate cake recipe.  The first time I made this I made changes for what I had on hand which was good,  but since then I have made it exactly as the recipe states and it has been perfect every single time.  I always get tons of compliments when I make this for a crowd  and my children, now ranging from age 8 to 20 ask specifically for this cake.  I haven't bought a boxed chocolate cake in almost 5 years.

I made my own buttermilk by sitting 1 cup soymilk and 1 T vinegar for about 10 minutes.  'Baked for the complete 40 minutes.  I made this for a group of grown boys who love dessert and they just couldn't stop raving about how moist and perfect the cake turned out.  We ate the cake plain with ice-cream.  The next day the cake is just as moist and delicious.  It has brought me back to my childhood devil's food cake-out-of-a-box eating days.  Well, those days are over and they are better now!  Thank you for this recipe!

This is absolutely my favorite chocolate cake EVER.  No need to find another recipe - this is the one.  The reviews where people have said that the cake fell (they undercooked it) or it overflowed the pans (they misread the instructions!) are just absurd.  I don't know how anyone can screw up this cake.  I have taken it to work twice, and people just rave about it.  I have made it in a bundt pan, and as a 9x13 cake.  For the first I used a chocolate ganache frosting, and the other I used the French Silk frosting on it - both are yummy, but I really prefer the French Silk frosting - which is kind of a buttercream frosting.  Really really good cake...d@mn hard to beat.

Seriously, this is the BEST chocolate cake I've ever made! I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 because I was making a cake for Easter but also wanted to make just a few cupcakes. It made 2 round layers and 12 cupcakes. I baked the cupcakes for 22 minutes but the could have cooked just a couple more minutes. Next time I'll set the timer for 25 minutes. I didn't have buttermilk, so I put about a tablespoon (maybe a little more) of white vinegar in my Pyrex glass measuring cup then filled it to the 1.5 cup mark with milk. I let the vinegar/milk mixture sit while I mixed the dry ingredients. Worked like a charm! This will be my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

Never going back to a box again!  I have never had much success with homemade, they were either dry or too dense.  This recipe is PHENOMENAL! Deep, rich chocolatey flavor, almost fudgy.  Light and fluffy and so moist, not dense at all.  I followed the recipe to a T except I added about 2 tblsp extra cocoa (I ran out of the good stuff and was trying to compensate).  I made cupcakes, 24 exactly, cooked for 18 minutes (I also only baked one pan at a time).

A couple of tips:

I used cupcake liners but next time will ALSO add cooking spray.  (they were so moist, when I used a small knife around the edge to loosen, I destroyed a few).

You must know these are SO delicate!  I'm not sure how people are doing layers and decorating for bdays, I barely survived cupcakes!

The cocoa I used was 1/2 c Ghiradelli and 1/4 c Hershey.  Will use all Ghiradelli next time

Do not overbake

If your cupcakes runneth over, quickly & gently take a paring knife around the edges to loosen while warm, put on a rack to cool

I had no problems with them running over and out of my pans at all.  I filled my cupcakes up about 2/3 of the way.  They do not "mound" on the top but they also did not fall in the center when cooled.  Sort of just perfectly flat on top.  Needless to say I wouldn't change a thing.  May make some homemade caramel to drizzle over the top with a sprinkling of sea salt.

LOVED it!  This cake is the best chocolate cake recipe that I have ever tried.  My daughter said it was "awesome".  I made this exactly as written except that I halved the recipe and made a single layer cake in a 11" X 7" pan.  This cake was so moist.  

I made the One Minute Chocolate Icing from this website and it was a good compliment.  That icing is very fudge-like.  YUM!  This will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe.

I followed the recipe step by step.  Used 2-9" round cake pans.  Ten minutes into baking, they began to grow & grow & grow. Overcooked out of the pans onto the bottom of the oven, smoke & burn.  Dont know what went wrong but OMG what a mess!   Ok, I've made this 5 times and it "grows" out of the pan everytime! I only use Hershey's cocoa, same process each time and always ends up a mess. I get half a cake-its good-but such a waste.

I too decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the cocoa to 1 cup. I filled liners 2/3 full which made 28 cupcakes. I baked them for about 20 minutes. Best cupcakes ever!

Ok, so  I made this last x-mas because I knew my brother loves chocolate cake but for some reason he was on a diet or something and did not even try it. I could not try it because I am a diabetic so I waited to see what everybody else thought. There were so many deserts that I don't think it stood out so I thought I would probably not make it again. I made it exactly as recipe stated and it LOOKED delicious. Anyways when I got up the next morning, my nephew and his 2 friends who had spent the night had pretty much devoured the whole thing. He is a picky eater so I think I will make it again at Easter just to make sure it was not just starving teenage boys who will eat anything in front of them.

I have made this several times, and it always comes out delicious.  I use 1 c of cocoa rather than the 3/4 because I felt that it wasn't quite chocolatey enough.  I would also recommend using a better cocoa powder than Hershey's if you can find one... it makes a huge difference in the taste.

Just a clarification the cake can use both dutch processed and regular cocoa becoz it has baking soda and buttermilk. Either ll give similar results. The reason cake is falling in middle might b the oven temp. Or if you use a very big pan without heating core. Try it with a heating core or a flower nail, it wont fall in the middle.
Also you can use paper towels soaked in cold water and the wrung and folded and covered with aluminum foil. Use this to line the outside of the pans. This ll also help a lot. 
The cake falls in the middle if the edges get heated faster than the center, so if u use cake pan liners, it ll help. Also type of man ll make a huge difference too.

Wonderful taste and moist texture! I did add hot water instead of coffee since I don't like coffee. Oh, and if you grease and flour the pan, it comes out without any problem. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this cake and it was fantastic.  It's so moist and the rich chocolate flavor makes it a competitor to any bakery cake!  I used the 9" pans to bake it and put homemade canoli filling in between.  Buttercream frosting made with 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter was perfect to compliment the chocolate flavor in the cake.

I love being begged for this cake at least twice a month, it's so moist, so easy, and turns out perfect everytime!! Last time I made it I added a little molasses, which brought out even a darker taste. All in all this recipe is a must in your recipe box!

The best chocolate cake I've ever made! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used whole (vitamin D) milk instead and it turned out perfect! I made a frosting out of 1 cup butter, 4 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup liquid coffee creamer.  This cake is heaven!

I made this recipe several time and all came delicious. I substitute coffee with milk when I baked for my children, I also used melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder (because I didn't have it at that time). Everyone loved it!

I used dark hot chocolate instead of coffee. The taste was phenomenal. It was just dried out because I followed the advice of other reviewers who insisted it takes the entire 40 min to bake. I will only bake for 30 min next time. I topped it with a dark chocolate glaze.

This is the best chocolate cake I'v ever tried; Theres no restaurant around that can even come close to this without using this exact recipe!!! Didn't have to change a thing in the recipe and yes(regardless of some comments) it does rise.I threw chopped pecans and chocolate chips on top as soon as I took it out of the oven and they melted together perfectly.

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but hubby is.  He gave it a 5-star rating before ever tasting it!  LOL  I knew having buttermilk in it would make this very moist and the black coffee would enhance the flavor of the cocoa.  I was correct ~ and the cake was outstanding.  I frosted this with 'Creamy Chocolate Frosting' from AR and it was equally as delicious as the cake.  Over 1,400+ reviews with a solid 5-stars.  If you like chocolate cake, this is a good one.

This is absolutely hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I have found. I have made it twice and it has turned out perfect each time. The 1st time I followed the directions to the letter, the 2nd time I replaced the coffee with 1 cup of very chocolaty hot chocolate and it was AMAZING. That will be my personal preference from now on but either way, this cake turns out amazing, so moist and delicious. Definitely my go to chocolate cake recipe.

This cake is so fast and easy to make. It always turns out so moist and chocolatey.  I make it as stated and it always turns out wonderful. I frosted it with creamy peanut butter frosting also from this site-this cake is a family favorite!

I made this for our Halloween get-together last night. My husband is VERY picky about cake and his response was: "This is what cake should taste like. I will judge all others against this one." My mother-in-law has been making a Devil's Food Cake for my father-in-law's birthday every year for decades, and she suggested I make this one in the future. Easy and delicious.

Ok this is my second review of this cake.  The first time I gave it 5stars because I added chocolate chips and used a bundt pan.  I thought that because I had added the chips that those sank the bottom of the pan causing the lower half of the cake to stick and not come out of the pan clean.  Otherwise it was excellent.  Well, I made it again and followed the recipe exactly.  I used a cupcake tin this time and sprayed the tin generously instead of using liners. Not one cupcake came out without crumbling in half.  Hmmmmm....apparently it wasn't my chocolate chips last time that made it stick to the pan.  This recipe just crumbled both times.  I LOVE the flavor of this cake, so any suggestions on what I can do to make this not crumble and get it out of the pan would be welcome.

This cake was really good. I think it may become my go to chocolate cake recipe. I cut the recipe in half and made a small stacked cake. I also whipped up some whipped cream frosting and drizzled chocolate gauche on the edges. It was awesome! :)

This cake is to die for.  Awesome!  And so easy to make.  All in one bowl, and I didn't even get out the mixer.  Used a whisk to stir dry and then mix in the wet ingredients.  I baked 40 minutes in a teflon coated bundt pan that I coated heavily with Pam, so it dropped right out.  So moist, rich, and flavorful.  This cake could stand on its own, sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  But I added Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting, from this site, and that took it over the top.

I made it exactly as recipe says except I baked mine in a bundt pan for 45 min. It came out moist but not very flavorful in my opinion. Not really sweet at all.

Amazing recipe!  Thanks very much for sharing!  I added a little instant cappuccino to the brewed coffee just as a matter of personal taste.  It was still a very subtle flavor with the luscious chocolate.  Great recipe - it is a keeper!

This recipe is from the Hershey's Chocolate Treasury, and is the Hershey company's most requested chocolate cake recipe.  I have been making this cake since first receiving the book in 1985.  Deep, dark, delcious!

I was a bit worried about how well this cake would turn out since some people said they had problems with it rising and falling apart, especially since my cousin and I were making it together and neither of us are baking experts, but I've gotta say that it came out great! It was actually very easy to make. It was incredibly moist and held together with no real problems. It wasn't too sweet either, but was far from bitter. It was a great balance, really. The only modification we made was that we added 3/4 of a cup of coffee instead of a whole cup, though we still added quite a bit of instant coffee mix to it and it didn't taste like coffee at all; the coffee just enhanced the chocolate. We made it with the smooth double chocolate frostng on this site as well (though we added some Tim Hortons cappuccino powder to it to keep with the coffee theme). Everybody who had a piece loved it. We'll definitely be making this one again in the future.

Whenever I make this cake I add just a bit more cocoa to it to add more of a chocolatier taste. I've made this cake many times and to this day, it is still my favourite cake. Amazing recipe!

Wonderful recipe, even with substitutions!  Didn't have buttermilk so used skimmed milk with 1 tbsp vinegar; didn't have enough cocoa so added melted baking chocolate; decreased oil to 1/3 cup to lower the calories (every bit helps, right?); and decreased sugar to 1 1.2 cups.  Came out moist and delicious! Baked in 2 silicon cake pans. For kids, frosted part of cake with whipped ganache.  We found very chocolaty - perhaps it helped to add the melted baking chocolate!  Recipe a keeper for sure!

Oh my, is this cake good!!!  I made one change in the recipe, only because I always do this, even with a box cake mix.  I substituted the vegetable oil for an equal amt of very soft butter (not margarine).  I did make the mistake of using 8" pans as that's what I had.  It spilled over a little bit, no crown like in a box mix.  But, as I always trim the top of the cake, this was no problem.  My room mate and I ate the scraps and couldn't stop!  I will definitely be making this cake again!  I do cake decorating for friends and family and usually use a box mix.  I will be using this recipe for special people!

I have made this cake twice.  The first time it was a tad difficult to get out of the pan as other reviewers stated but I also didn't flour it like I should have.  I also didn't care for the strong coffee taste (I used Starbucks Pikes Peak K Cups).  Very Moist cake though, and I noticed that as each night went on the cake lost alittle of the strong coffee taste.  I used a coconut buttercream frosting off this site and after the 1st night it was very tasty without the coffee flavor.

Second time, my hubby suggested using water instead of coffee, but then I thought it lacked something.  Also, for some reason the cake came out very brownie type dense.  The only difference was water instead of coffee.  I wonder if my baking powder was bad???  

My third time I will be trying with hot cocoa instead of coffee and water.  And will make sure my baking powder is not expired.

This is the BEST chocolate cake on the planet!!!  I use 13/4 cup sugar instead of 2 and it's perfect...not too sweet.  I baked it for my brother's birthday and he didn't believe I made it.  He thought I bought it at a gourmet bakery.  I use a different frosting that whips up so light and creamy.  (21/2 sticks of unsalted butter, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. I use Callebaut in both the cake and frosting and it is wonderful (I purchase it on Amazon.com). 3 cups sifted powdered sugar, 4-6 tbs. heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, 11/2 tsp. salt.  I soften the butter then whip it in my stand mixer for at least 4 minutes to make it very fluffy and soft easy to spread frosting.  Then slowly add powdered sugar, cocoa, whipping cream (gradually to get the right texture), vanilla, salt.  This chocolate buttercream frosting is so wonderful....taste and modify as needed. I also add mini Hershey's kisses along the sides and in the middle to decorate the cake and make it a triple chocolate threat!  Enjoy

This was the perfect cake! So moist and fluffy. The only change I made was adding a little more chocolate, rounding up to one whole cup. This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.

I have made this five times now, each time the cake comes out flawless.  I do coat the pan with cocoa powder instead of flour and use parchment paper on the bottom.  The last time I made this I added an extra teaspoon of baking powder and a few tablespoons of Tia Maria liqueur.   The cake had a deeper hint of coffee but very slight, it also rose higher, which I liked.  I love icing the cake with a cream cheese frosting.  This is such a moist cake that tastes amazing even a few days later. So easy to make!

Made this cake for fathers day and it was a fantastic hit. I used the chocolate Ganache recipe from this site and whipped it for a frosting and it was fabulous.   I'm not a coffee drinker but the coffee make this cake so rich and delicious. My hubby usually takes my bakery left overs to work but not this one....we actually froze the left overs wrapped in press n seal and then in a plastic container. We ate them about 2 weeks later and it was still fantastic. Will definitely make this again

I made this cake with the 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' recipe on here for my dad's birthday. I love chocolate cake when it's done right but so often it ends up being dry and crumbly. Not this cake- it was moist, delicious, and chocolatey! My mother, queen of the white cake, even admitted to liking it. All of us kept creeping back to the fridge over the next week to sneak bites of it. I highly recommend this recipe and also that you check out the frosting I used: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/rich-chocolate-frosting-2

Followed the directions exactly.  Used Hershey's cocoa and got a small starbuck's dark roast coffee (I don't own a coffee pot).  The coffee was still hot when i added it, but it didnt' seem to make a difference.  made 24 cupcakes which took 18 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Everyone at worked raved about them.  Super moist :)

My family Loves this cake best of all the chocolate cakes, and they are chocolate fanatics!
It's reliable, always tender, moist chocolaty and delicious, and its easy to make. Using real buttermilk makes a difference, so use it if you have it,
and be sure to make the coffee very strong. If you have trouble removing the cake layers from the pans, you can grease the pans, then line the bottoms with greased parchment or waxed paper cut to fit, before flouring.

This makes a wonderful layer cake and works well with many different frostings.

I've probably served this cake to over 100 people and everyone has said it's the best cake they've ever had. Its the only recipe I'll use. 

My secret is Valhrona Chocolate, and a NICE cup of strong coffee. It makes a BIG difference. Even people who don't appreciate nice things will taste the difference.

If I'm planning on icing it and need to be sure i'll do a good job I'll evaporate the coffee so it's less than 1 cup but still has all the flavor... so the cake isn't as wet.

I didn't have butter milk so I made some with 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice set aside for a few minutes.

Delicious!  I made it gluten free by substituting the flour with a mix of rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and xantham gum.  Also, I only have a toaster oven, so I put half the batter in a rice cooker and half in the toaster oven.  The rice cooker cake was much more fluffy and moist.  For a glaze, I melted butter and added sugar and coffee liqueur.

Yeah, this cake lives up to its rating - it had excellent flavor and texture - 2 things that seem a little elusive in most chocolate cakes.  A great cake - I'm ending my quest for a perfect chocolate cake with this one. Thanks!

This is hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I've made.  I use Hershey's Dark Cocoa in it and it's great in 9X13, layer or cupcakes.  It's absolutely to die for w/peanut butter icing!  Thanks Marsha for sharing.

This cake is amazing! I will never use different recipe.  The batter is very thin as others have stated, but turned out very well.  I made them as cupcakes 23 minutes in my oven.  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to measure out batter and that was perfect.  Used with the cinnamon coffee frosting from site (which was a great combination)

Absolutely delicious. So rich and fragrant, and incredibly simple! I needed to let mine cook for the entire 40 minutes, but it was so moist. It stayed that way even after cooling when some cakes tend to harden or dry out a bit. I sprayed my round cake pans with plenty of Baker's Joy (the oil and flour spray), but I'm sure a similar product will do just fine. It popped right out of the pan with little crumb left behind. Fabulous, because I wouldn't want to miss a bit of this cake! The batter does seem a little thin, but it bakes up perfectly. People at my church raved and devoured this cake so quickly! Amazing chocolate flavor, and I topped with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site for a really decadent experience. Try this cake, you won't regret it! It's my new go to chocolate cake!

I absolutely loved this cake. When it came out of the oven, it was almost black in color because of the chocolate and coffee. When I cut into the cake after frosting it, it gave off a delicious chocolately aroma, and it was extremely moist and delicious. This is my new go-to chocolate cake recipe. A real winner.

Excellent; very moist & great texture. I baked in a 13x9 inch pan, had to substitute milk (1c) with cream of tartar (1 3/4 tsp) for the buttermilk b/c I didn't have any & it still turned out delicious!! Only thing was it didn't rise very well in the middle but that really didn't matter to me b/c the taste made up for it. This will definitely be my chocolate cake recipe. Frosted mine with a caramel frosting but the cake is so good you could get away with no frosting at all!!

This cake is fabulous! I used almond extract in the cake and frosting instead of vanilla. It is so chocolately and decadent. This recipe made my day.

This is it!!! The perfect chocolate cake!!! Wow! Just perfect! Dangerously good! Deliciously moist, perfectly chocolatey. So so good! I made a couple changes out of necessity: I didn't have much milk, and I didn't want to brew coffee, so I used 2 cups of water instead. I also melted a couple ounces of Ghirardelli chocolate chips and stirred that into the batter. Made a LOVELY cake. The little bit that's left has been sitting on the counter, covered with plastic wrap. The cake is getting smaller and smaller...but it's tasting better and better as the days pass. Can't say enough good about this. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

I baked in the NJ casinos for 10 years, and even though we used a buttermilk recipe for our chocolate cakes, they STILL weren't THIS good.  I had to join this site just so I could give this cake one more 5-star rating.  It's truly THAT good!  Very, very, VERY moist.  I will never use another recipe!

I have made this as a cake and as cupcakes several times. This is a foolproof recipe. I am a novice and even I can turn out great tasting cakes with this recipe. I followed a previous poster's suggestion about cupcakes. This recipe yielded about 26 medium cupcakes, baked perfectly at 350 F and for 22-23 min. 
Thanks for this excellent recipe.

Best chocolate cake ever. So moist and flavorful. I do have to adjust for high altitude with a tiny bit of extra flour, a higher oven temp etc, but it turns out beautifully.

This is, without a doubt, the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever tasted! I had all but given up on making any kind of homemade cakes because the boxed mixes always tasted way better...not anymore! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and this cake is super-moist and delicious, with a rich chocolate flavor. I topped it with the chocolate ganache (from this website) and it was perfect. It is an excellent base recipe for a chocolate cake and it could be used with a variety of frostings, fillings, toppings. YUM! :)

Excellent flavor & texture-very chocolaty and moist.  This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I tried this recipe because I read somewhere that hot coffee mixed with cocoa power intensifies the chocolate flavor.  (There is a scientific explanation but I don't recall what it is).  Instead of cake pans I used a greased muffin pan and baked for 22 minutes.   They actually tasted better the next day.  These came out so moist that they were hard to remove from the pan.  I will definitely make this again but next time I will use paper liners instead of greasing the pan.

Delicious, moist, chocolatey. I used a mixture of butter and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and I used carob instead of cocoa, only because it was all that was left in the store after the hurricane and I needed to use it up. I was worried it would ruin the chocolate experience but nope! The cake turned out wonderful. I made it in a spring form pan so it would be easy to maneuver. I also added about a cup of a chopped chocolate-toffee bar. It doesn't even need icing, it's heavenly all on it's own!

This was really really good. I made this for a friends birthday party that was also a halloween costume party. The coffee gives this a dark chocolate ALMOST bitterness that is amazing. This moist and chocolaty cake is perfect for the coffee lover and the chocolate lover. I baked it in 2 8 inch cake tins and then "glued" them together with buttercream (I used the "Best Buttercream Frosting" found on this site). Only I added chocolate and coffee to the recipe. Yum!

This cake is really good. I followed the recipe ( changing nothing) and it came out fantastic. Like some others have mentioned, the batter is very thin and it does not rise a great deal. In 30 minutes the cake was beautifully done. I cut each layer in half and filled with black cherry preserves, then iced the cake with sour cream whipped cream icing.

I have always wondered where my Mom found this recipe, and now thanks to Kathy (2005), I realized it was right there on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can!  We have loved this cake for many years and have always considered it a special family favorite.  Now, with the added insight of all of these great reviewers, I can't wait to try the Coffee Butter Frosting from this site when I make it for my Mom's birthday tomorrow!

Very good chocolate cake!  This is now my go to recipe.  I prefer the dark color and depth of chocolate you get with the special dark cocoa or jet black cocoa.  So I used 1/2 c or more special dark and the remaining 1/4 c of regular standard cocoa.  Very good with or without frosting.

This was the best chocolate cake I've ever made, and quite possibly the best I've had. Perfectly delicate and tender crumb, moist and absolutely melt in your mouth. I frosted with Creamy Chocolate frosting which I tweaked slightly and added some shavings of a Hershey bar to dress it up. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

I've been baking this cake ever since I was 6 and found it in my mom's Hershey's cookbook.  The only difference I notice is that this recipe calls for buttermilk while the one in the cookbook calls for sour milk (1 tsp vinegar mixed with the milk sours it).  Since I never have buttermilk on hand, the sour milk is always the way I go. 
Always this will be my favorite chocolate cake recipe.  It is so moist and full of flavor.  Unlike a lot of other cakes, this one gets better a day or two after being baked.  It gets more moist and the flavors come out more, in my opinion.

I made this to take to a pot luck last Sunday, and am just getting around to writing this review.  This cake was SO delicious!  Fortunately, we arrived at the pot luck a little late, and everyone had already eaten!  Oh well, that just meant that we got to take 3/4 of the cake home for ourselves!  They don't know what they missed!  It was moist, just the right amount of chocolate, not too sweet, and downright decadent!  I topped it with a chocolate butter cream, which was just perfect!  This is one for the recipe box, that's for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this...delicious! The batter is very wet and makes for rather fragile cake, but unbelievably moist with a lovely crumb. I used a combination of Dutch-processed cocoa and black cocoa, so I reversed the ratios of baking powder and baking soda. My cupcakes rose perfectly and are so dark and rich that they are almost black. I filled the cupcakes about 3/4 full, maybe a little less, and it made 24. I plan on frosting with whipped ganache and garnishing with fresh strawberries.

Best homemade chocolate cake recipe ever. I made coffee icing to go on top and my teenagers and husband just wanted to know when I was making it again. It is, however, too moist to be a cake you use for soaking.

It is indeed a very soft and moist cake that is easily whipped up! I halved the recipe to bake it in a 8x8 pan.

Absolutely the most amazing chocolate cake I've ever had. I've tried tons of chocolate recipes, with most of them coming out too dry and very "meh". But this cake is SO moist. My boyfriend thought putting coffee in a chocolate cake would be gross, but you really can't taste it at all--he hates coffee, and he loved the cake. It's quite a dark chocolate cake, but people who don't usually like dark chocolate seem to like this cake a lot. I'll use this recipe again and again!

The only change I did was I baked it at 300 degrees and it came out fantastic.  I used the fluffy white frosting found on this website and the kids loved it.

Incredibly good. I don't like coffee, but it really works in this recipe. I used dark non-stick pans and had more trouble than usual separating the cake from the pans. Also the cake didn't rise as much as usual. But man is it moist and delicious! I was going to try a new flavor of icing (Duncan Hines Frosting Creations, chocolate almond). Fortunately I sampled before icing the cake – it was truly awful. The upside is that this cake is so good, you can actually eat it without frosting (I've never said that about any other cake). 

Next time I may cut back on the sugar a little. Overall, a little high maintenance but moist, good texture and excellent flavor.

I had been on a mission for the best chocolate cake recipe for about 3 years.  I have made many on this site but for some reason always passed this one over.  I knew my mission was complete the second I bit into this cake!  I was very skeptical because the batter is so runny but my concern was unfounded.  I undertook a mission to recreate Starbucks lattes as cupcakes and used this as a base for all of the mocha flavored ones (just added 3 packets of Via) and some additions such as chocolate chips for Java chip or a white chocolate filling for the white mocha.  And as a cake this recipe is great with a strawberry or blueberry filling!

Hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever had! No need to search for the ultimate chocolate any longer...I've found it! Huge hit every time it's served. Even if you don't like coffee, use it anyway. You can't taste it but it makes the chocolate flavor pop! Excellent cake!

Fantastic recipe!  I replaced vegetable oil with butter, it was so moist and not overly rich.  I used the chocholate butter, which was just enough to cover a 9x13 cake.  

6 tbsp. butter
1 cup powdered sugar
4 tbsp. cocoa
2 to 3 tbsp. milk

ENJOY!!

I made this twice.  The first time it fell apart, but that was my first time making a two layered cake.  I also used can frosting which was way to hard and not spreadable at all.  So I gave it another shot at a party last weekend.  This time I made my own frosting, first time as well, and it came out so much better.  I got so many complements and was asked to make it for a friends birthday.  It actually stir the baker in me to try more things.  Thanks a lot!  I would suggest refrigerating it over night when it is frosted and then leaving it out at room temperature for a few hours.  It holds the cake together and gives the frosting the right consistency.

OH MY GOSH. This cake is deserving of the title. Made it exactly according to the recipe (besides decaf coffee) and baked in 2 8x8 pans. I topped it with a frosting from this site "Rich Chocolate Frosting". For the frosting, I substituted coconut flavored creamer for milk. YUM!! All the leftovers went to my husband's work, and they're all wondering when I'm going to make it again. Three of the people were on diets and still couldn't resist a little piece!!! :) I imagine this would be DELICIOUS with some kind of real coconut frosting. It was delicious the way I made it with a hint of coconut in the frosting, too. But, even the cake itself is SO moist and decedent, and I'm not a huge chocolate person!

The BEST cake I have ever had!!! My family has food allergies so I used spelt flour instead of wheat. As for the buttermilk, I used soy milk and added 1 Tbs. apple cider vinegar. It turned out beautifully! For the icing I used a chocolate ganache recipe. This cake really is amazing!

There are no words to describe how absolutely delicious this cake is.  I dissolved two packets of instant coffee in 1 cup water and let it cool in the fridge overnight   Baked a dozen mini cupcakes for 15 mins and the remaining batter went in a bundt pan for 40 mins.  I used the Peanut Butter Fudge Frosting recipe from this site, which I highly recommend. A tall cold glass of milk complemented the slice I enjoyed quite nicely.  I read someones comment on here that they found this recipe years ago on the back of a Herseys Unsweetened Coco container...Wouldn't have expected anything less from Herseys.  Many thanks to whoever came up with the original recipe, this will be my 'forever' chocolate cake recipe from now on.

Cooked up nice and dark, and I loved how it rose high above my 9" pans while baking, but 40 min in a convection oven was too long.  The edges got dry and nearly burnt. Overall the cake was a bit dry. I might try it again and cook for less time.

This cake is absolutely delicious and moist. You could easily use 3 9" cake pans. A light Chocolate Buttercream Icing is a good balance.

Yes! This is the cake I've been looking for! It is super moist, and has a very distinct cocoa flavour, not necessarily chocolaty. It takes just a few minutes to make, and keeps well for several days.

Easy to make, moist and tasty. I substituted applesauce for oil. Iced it with the black ice icing, which tastes like pudding. Made a nice everday cake for snacks. I think if I had used a sweeter icing it would have made a nice bithday cake. Will make again since it was so easy. * Because I didn't have buttermilk, I used a quick substitute by using a tablespoon of vinegar in a cup of milk and let it set for 5 minutes. Worked great.

Never fails, moist and awesome! I find myself modifying all other chocolate cake recipes with what I think are the 2 standout ingredients in this one: Buttermilk and brewed coffee.

This is a great recipe. I am an amateur when it comes to cakes, but this recipe is easy to follow and the end result is magnificent. Although it is a bit hard to work with the cake -it comes out very moist- with icing or fondant, refrigerating it for an hour or two solves that issue. 

I would recommend the recipe as it is, would not change a thing.

This reciipe is sooo easy and soo good. I can't give it enough stars. I didn't have any butter milk so I made my own using heavy whipping cream (from homemade butter search on this site). It turned out amazingly. My hubby thinks it tastes like a soft moist brownie. I used a chocolate frosting from this site as well. I recommend you try this cake. I will be making this cake into cupcakes for my neices 3rd birthday. Must try.

This has the same texture as cake mix, very soft and moist. If you want something a bit more dense or a cake to carve, this is NOT your cake.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa and followed the recipe exactly.  I also used whole fat buttermilk.  One full recipe made 24 mini cupcakes, 12 standard cupcakes, and 1  6"x2" cake.  It's not overly sweet, and I topped the cupcakes with strawberry swiss meringue buttercream and used the 6x2" cake to make a black forest cake.  This peeled away from the cupcake wrappers just fine, but next time I'm going to grease my cake pan more generously since some of the bottom stuck to the pan.

I really like this cake.  I wasn't a big dessert person until recently.  My kids wouldn't put the bowl down and have been begging since it was made!  Next time I will go with my gut and use cream cheese or buttercream frosting.  I threw in chocolate chips that were left over from the cookies I baked as well.  Love it and will make again :)

Great recipe, but didn't come out off the muffin pan, inspite of buttering the sides.  Maybe the pan (Bundt muffin pan) needs to buttered and sprinkled with the crumbs.  Nethertheless,  I will definetely make this cake again.

Made this recipe as cupcakes instead of a full cake; it was tasty and would make for a nice, light cake, but not a new favorite of mine for cupcakes. The texture is extremely light and fluffy-- definitely not a dense or fudgy cake for those who are looking for a little more heft, but the chocolate flavor is really nice. The only suggestion I might offer is to make sure that you're using a decent coffee; the flavor really comes through!

AWESOME cake! Like others said, this is a very moist and chocolately cake.  A must for chocolate lovers!  I did have a slight problem with the cake sticking to the pan and I greased and floured it very heavily.  There was only one small area that stuck so it was easily covered with icing.  

I did have a problem icing it because the cake is so moist, it seemed to crumble a lot around the edges.  I used a buttercream icing because it was a butterfly shaped cake for my daughters birthday.  Tasted great!

I write this breathing a sigh of relief.  I tried this cake because it has 5 stars after over 1,000 reviews.  I was really worried when at 30 minutes, the toothpick not only came out wet but the cake batter on it was cool.  This cake really is black magic because 10 minutes later(40 minutes total) not only was the cake done, but it came out of the cake pan(13x9) cleanly.  Nothing fell apart even though it was so moist.

I tasted the cooked cake(I tasted the batter too lol) and WOW... it's amazing.

Just waiting for it to cool so I can put my own Reese's peanut butter cup frosting on it and then sugar overdose time!  

This is the chocolate cake recipe I will be using from now on.

The coffee does add an enjoyable twist and it was quite moist. The person I made it for thought it was amazing and a few other people commented positively but I wasn't as impressed; I thought it was pretty decent but not mind-blowingly awesome.

Oh wow, this was amazing.  Upscale bakery quality.  Followed recipe exactly.  Frosted with chocolate buttercream & then a covering of "Ganache I" from this site.  Totally worth the calories!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake!  I have made it as directed as well as made modifications.  It came out great both times but I prefer my modified recipe.  I substituted 1/4 cup of the cocoa for Herseys Special Dark Cocoa Powder.  I also added two teaspoons of High quality cinnamon and add a teaspoon of ameretto to it.  The cinnamon especially added depth.  I also used a cup of esspresso instead of coffee.  It is very rich without being overpowering.  The hubby loves it.  I also used this as a basis for my own creation a Turtle updside down cake.  It was fudgy and cake like all at once.  The husband raved and he is not a huge rich chocolate fan.

The coffee gave it a little extra flavor to it. I also liked that it was all scratch not just adding to a box mix.

Best chocolate cake I have ever made! I made this in a bundt pan and baked for 40+ minutes then frosted with the coffee butter frosting also from this site. I took it to a dinner party and there was nothing left

Extremely easy to make, even for me - a VERY novice baker!  Just mix, pour, and bake.  My cake tended to sink a little in the middle (I used a 9x13 pan) and I had slight difficulty getting it onto the wire rack without a massive cake collapse, but everything came out alright in the end.  This cake has an amazing, rich flavor.  The coffee is a wonderful touch.  Excellent experience for my first cake!

My family has been using this cake for over 20 years.  My sister likes to ice it with whipped cream with mini chocolate chips folded in.  I like folding in Cherry or Blackberry brandy to taste with the whip cream and then covering the cake and around the base with whole bing cherries (stems attached).  I also sprinkle chocolate curls all over the cake.  I even slice cherries in half remove the pit and the stem and add them to the middle layer.  It is amazing!  Enjoy!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever come across. It is very dense and moist but not too rich. I made a frosting of butter, powdered sugar, and coffee that looked pretty on top and tasted great with it. I substituted applesauce for oil in the cake and it turned out just perfect.

This is a great cake. It is very moist and has great flavor. To be honest I was skeptical to frost the cake with the heavy butter cream frosting I had because like other reviewers had mentioned it was a delicate cake and I was afraid it would fall apart. But, I put it in the fridge wrapped for a couple of hours and it was fine to frost. I will def make this Again!

The cake came out great!  It was really moist and exactly what you would expect in a great chocolate cake.  I even got my boyfriend, who doesn't like cake at all, to like it!  Hands down, way better than any cake mix you can buy.

This was AMAZING! followed the recipe as is and it came out beautifully. I was worried about the very liquidy batter but it wasn't an issue. The cake baked up nicely. Very moist and rich. Can't wait to frost and serve it up.

Awesome! I used Pikes Place coffee from Starbucks and my cakes had a very subtle hint of coffee. The cupcakes were so moist, they even stuck to my fingers. This cake is really easy to make and don't be put off by the liquid looking batter, it will fluff up in the oven.

I'm in a highschool foods class, and my partner and I had to bake something in front of the class. We found this recipe, and even though we had never made it before, decided to try it out. It is the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever had! And I didn't change anything in the recipe. The texture was moist and dense, and it came out of the pan so easily! The chocolate flavour was rich, but not too filling - perfect! Everyone in the class loved it - what a great recipe! :D

SUPER MOIST!!! Tasty treat that all the in-laws loved! I made it into a turtle cake, pecan/caramel frosting with melted caramel drizzled over the top. YUM!  The extra cake from leveling the layers mixed with chopped pecans and melted caramels made *great* turtle cake balls!

Very light yet chocolatety!  I frosted it with the "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" that's also found on AllRecipes.  The frosting didn't overpower the cake (although I did put only 1-1/2 c sugar in the frosting instead of the 2 c that the recipe calls for).  The two complimented each other well.

The best chocolate cake ever!! It is so moist and practically melts in your mouth. It doesn't need frosting at all. I made it as a bundt cake the first time, so be careful if you put on a wire rack because it's hard to move to the cake pan without falling apart.

This cake was easy to make, moist and perfect.  I only cut the sugar a bit, since my family isn't really into really sweet cakes.  It was really good and everyone kept raving about it.  Will definitely keep this one for other special occasions.

Not much else is needed on this very rich dark chocolate cake. It's moist, fluffy, and the coffee gives the cake that wonderful bitter taste of very dark chocolate. I usually just make a ganache for this cake instead of frosting b/c I don't want to wash out the flavor of the cake. Mmmm.

This cake was so good, and is especially good if you like a chocolately cake.  I put chocolate frosting on it and it was excellent.  It is super moist! Everyone enjoyed it.

Tastes as though it came out of a box.  So easy to make and with most ingredients you have in the pantry.  Very moist and delicious.

This was the very first thing I ever baked. I was 10 years old (53 years ago!).  It was on the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder box.  My family loved it so much it became my permanent job to bake one for Sunday dinner for our large family.  Made one for the first in 40+ years last night.  Delish - even better with the new extra dark Hershey's cocoa powder and I used instant espresso crystals in 2 Cups of hot water.  Brought it to work this morning.  I'm a hero, but we all have caffein speed wobbles.  Oh, also added a tablespoon of Godiva Chocolate Liqueur and a tablespoon of brandy to the thin crumb coat frosting layer.  Yummmmm.

This cake was absolutely DIVINE! I had never made a cake with coffee in it before, so I was a bit worried it may have a coffee taste to it. However, I was wrong. It was moist, chocolaty, and exactly how I wanted it to turn out. Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used. I made a cherry filling and used a cream cheese frosting, however, any frosting would be wonderful with this cake. This is THE chocolate cake recipe for chocolate lovers!

Nice recipe. The coffee makes all the difference. Didn't have the butermilk, so I used heavy cream and cream of tartar in its place, but otherwise unchanged. This is my go-to recipe now.

Oh. My. Gosh.  Literally THE best scratch-made chocolate cake I have ever made.  I'm convinced it's because of the coffee - you don't taste it in the cake, but it really brings out the flavor.  I used the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site, too - I used it as my filling between the 2 9" layers, and then I whipped the remaining ganache to front along the top and edges.  TO DIE for good!

All I can say is YUM!!!!  This was so good and very chocolatey!   The coffee definitely enhanced the flavor.  It was even better the day after I baked it.  I frosted with a chocolate buttercream.  100% give this a try!

Very , very good chocolate cake. I had a little trouble figuring out when it was done , but otherwise very tasty and moist. I didn't find it hard to work with, it was actually very easy. Made it for my daughters 5 birthday as a castle. It was a hit! This one is a keeper! Thank you Marsha for the recipe. # My daughter is now 10 and this is still the #1 cake at our house.

I really love having all the ingredients on hand. No going to the store. Buttermilk=1 T lemon juice + milk to = 1 cup. Always have left over coffee in the morning. Really good even without icing. Tender, moist, and flavorful. Made it in 9x13 pan. Nice recipe!

Three words- TO DIE FOR! I made this recipe into cupcakes and everyone loved them. I've never had a more moist cupcake. But... please help me!!!! I just moved out to Colorado and am still having trouble with baking at the higher altitude. I added extra flour to my batter, but that didn't seem to help at all. The middles of my cupcakes completely sunk. What should I be doing? Any suggestions would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks :)

If you live in a high altitude area, make sure you use more flour than it says, otherwise your cake will sink.

Very good, moist cake that isn't too sweet.  I made it as stated except for using 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I used 2 9" cake pans and baked for 30 minutes.  I frosted with the sugar free frosting and it was delicious!!!

this is the same recipe as on the Hershey website, except the Hershey's website did not specify white or brown sugar and you can substitute buttermilk for sourmilk (1 tablespoon white vinegar + 1 cup of milk, let sit for at least 5 min).  I made it exactly as stated except I used half white and half brown sugar.  I also used sourmilk, instant coffee, and olive oil.  30 min. It came out perfectly, very moist.

OMG!!! This cake is amazingggggg. I called it a chocolate cake orgasm. I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and milk instead of buttermilk. I frosted it was a dark chocolate butter cream icing and put raspberries on the side. It doesn't get better than this!!!

I was looking for a quick and easy basic chocolate cake recipe, and this one is it. Used half melted butter, half grapeseed oil, and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, and added 1 TS of rum, and it turned out perfect: moist and full of flavor.  Since I didn't have two cake pans, I baked the whole batter in a 9" spring form and then cut it into two layers. Made a filling of Morello cherries in thickened juice with Kirschwasser for a little kick, and then made a vanilla whipped cream frosting/filling.  It's an absolute keeper! And yes, the batter looks very liquid, but bakes up beautifully.

The coffee makes this cake out of this world.  I made with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Was extremely rich.  You may need some vanilla ice cream to go with this :)

Amazing!!!  I didn't change a thing (even though I normally do), and it turned out super moist and delicious.  I baked it in two 8" round pans, and iced it with a coffee icing from this site.  Definitely a keeper!

My mom made this cake for my birthday and it was amazing.  We were a little disappointed that it didn't have a frosting recipe, but we very easily found one for chocolate buttercream.  I am a chocoholic but I also really love different flavors with my cake, so I added raspberries around the edge.  And boy, did it go perfectly with the dark chocolate.  I never would have guessed!  This cake was amazing.

This is the tastiest and easiest chocolate cake I've ever made! I made cupcakes and they turned out perfectly. SO moist and fluffy. I recommend using a measuring cup with a spout to pour the batter into the cupcake pans.

Just finished a slice of this gem...used applesauce in place of the oil, but added only about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  I topped it off with chocolate ganache from this site.  It totally took care of my sweet tooth tonight.  SO moist, so chocolaty and sooooo evil-y good!

This cake is not good. I've made it twice, and at best, it's average. Although, because of all the glowing reviews it's received, maybe it's just me!

Sinfully delicious cake! Very moist with the perfect chocolate flavor. Not too sweet and not too bitter. I used a bundt cake pan to bake it in and then I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe by Ginger from this site to drizzle on the top. It went perfect with the cake!

This cake is an absolute winner. The fact that I am a novice at baking and this cake ticked all the boxes the very 1st time I made it-texture, color, taste says its foolproof! I followed the recipe to the 'T' except I added only 1 and 3/4th cups sugar instead of 2. But since I did not use any icing and had it plain, I think additional sweetness  would have been nice as recommended on the recipe (using 2 cups of sugar).I used used a sieve for all the dry ingredients to get rid of any lumps in the flour, cocoa or sugar and mixed them thoroughly before adding the wet ingredients. I also used 2 tsp of instant coffee to one cup of water, but U cannot taste the coffee in the cake. I separated the egg whites and whipped them, then mixed it only lightly with the batter just before baking it.  I read some of the reviews for this cake which reported  that the cake collapsed in the centre. I did not have this problem; I made sure the inserted toothpick in the cake centre came out clean just before I got  the cake out of the oven and removed it from the pan only after it cooled for 10 min. It took me 48 min to bake it at 175C and it came out perfect!! Thanx a million Marsha for sharing it.

WON-DER-FUL! perfect cake, so moist, so tasty, so fluffy! I put milk instead of buttermilk, and the batter was so thin that takes more than one hour 15' to cook perfectly...but my house were full of a pleasant chocolat smell! I frost it with a cream cheese frosting (180 gr cream cheese, 80 gr butter, 2 cups confectioner sugar) and decorate with a snow man made by marshmallows (I will put the photo soon), and everybody took a picture and ate two slices!

Stunning & Decadent.  I follwed the recipe except I probably used double the amount of vanilla extract and I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  I don't like any coffee at all and I didn't notice it in the cake so don't omit it!  I paired this with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting"  also available on this site.    I will make both again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Halloween. Even the name seemed appropriate. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake myself, but this was almost brownie like. I ground up an entire package of regular Oreos and mixed into the batter. (adding just a little extra milk to compensate) - Oh my god.

I made this cake twice in one night.  The first one was almost STICKY so I baked the 2nd one longer.  Delicious.  Used Starbucks coffee.  Iced with the chocolate mousse from the Chocolate Mousse Cake recipe on this site and the best rated Chocolate Ganache from this site.  The cake was absolutely BEAUTIFUL...looked like something from a bakery.  Next time I will do 4 thin layers instead of 2 thick because the cake is so dense.  If you want to impress anyone, this is the cake to do it with.

Moist and delicious, and surprisingly, not heavy at all. I made it twice last month. I have to stress not overcooking it, and I found the first time I made it, it was rather difficult to remove from the pan. I fixed this by powdering the greased pan with flour and it popped right out.

I have been making this cake for about 25 yrs..You can't find a better tasting chocolate cake. It is so moist it's almost impossible to over bake. My only tip is to just dump everything into your bowl in the recipe order and beat until smooth (it won't take long). Batter will be thin as stated. If you are a true chocoholic like me, frost with chocolate frosting (I use the chocolate frosting recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can). If not, use a vanilla or buttercream frosting. A touch of coffee added to any frosting will really bring out the coffee flavor but, won't overpower the overall taste. I love this recipe and I am sure you will too.

I made this cake for a Halloween party and it turned out PERFECT!  I baked it in a bundt pan and took it out of the oven and put it straight into the freezer for 20 minutes as someone suggested in a review.  I had no problem getting it out of the pan or handling it.  I prepared the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site and drizzled it over the cake when it had cooled.  This has an amazing flavor and is super moist.  I am going to make it again tonight since I still have buttermilk leftover.  Good excuse to make it again, huh? "Can't waste the buttermilk, now can we?"

This cake was just as amazing as all of the other reviews state!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was SO simple.  Only one bowl to wash!!!  I used chocolate pudding between the layers and cool whip on top and it was perfect!  Made it very light and refreshing.  I will NEVER used a boxed cake mix again!

I've been using this recipe (obtained from Hershey's kitchen website) for a while-- comments range from "can I get the recipe" to "this is the best cake I have ever had"   Truly a remarkable recipe.

I adore this cake.  Even my younger brother (who hates chocolate cake) loved this incarnation.  I suggest that you put some red jelly (i.e. strawberry, prickly pear, etc.) in between the two layers and a 2 parts jelly to 1 part chocolate frosting for a topping.  It makes for a wonderfully spooky look.

This is hands down the best chocolate cake recipe ever!  It's so moist and full of chocolate deliciousness!  I make it with a buttercream frosting and use a stencil design for a Halloween treat...or whichever holiday you are baking it for.  I'm making it for a Halloween party this weekend!

My husband called this the "Perfect Chocolate Cake" I filled with Chocoalte Mousse from another recipe. Must bake for the full 40 Minutes. Let cakes cool completely and had no problem getting them out! Great Chocolate Cake Base Receipe, will make again.

This is an awesome cake-especially considering how easy it is!  It's rich, fudgy, dense, very tasty.  This has become a household favorite, especially for packed school lunches.

Excellent dense, moist chocolate cake. I must admit that I forgot the oil. I had the cake in the oven for less than 5 mins. I took it out, dumped the 2 round pans of batter back in the mixing bowl, poured in the oil, quickly mixed it, then poured it back in the pans and into the oven. It took longer to bake than the recipe stated, but it still turned out to be a very good cake. ;)

This cake was the best cake I have ever had in my life. I was a little hesitant about the coffee, but you couldnt even taste or smell it. I would recommend this to everyone moist, delicious, and never need to buy cake mix from a box again!

I was hesitant about the chocolate frosting on a chocolate cake because I thought it would be too sweet, but this is by far the BEST cake I have ever had in my entire life! I topped mine with a berry mix including raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. Arranged properly, the result was a stunning presentation of a delicious  cake!

I have never made a "from scratch" cake before and I have to say.. this recipe was a cinch! Moist and delicious! I was worried about all the troubles other reviewers were having with getting it out of the pan. I greased with crisco and floured well, put it straight from the oven into the freezer for about 20 minutes. Took it out and knocked on the sides and bottom and Voila! out it popped! I made this for my sister's bday and will make again for my nephew's... Goodbye boxed cake mixes!!! oh.. I increased the time by about 5min.:)

Absolutely perfect. I followed this recipe to a T and nothing went wrong. It's so easy to make and it tastes absolutely delicious. It is so moist and has the perfect sweetness balance to it. I will most definitely make it again. and again and again and again!

This was the first time I ever made a cake from scratch and it turned out beautifully. I made a two layer cake and simmered some frozen organic blueberries with a drop of orange extract for between the two layers- then drizzled the juice over the whole cake. This made for the moistest cake I've ever had without changing the beautiful texture. I also used cake flour which made for a nice satiny, fluffy cake.  I made the Pro Ganache from the site, and whipped it to frost the cake, and then made a butter cream frosting to decorate it. It was a total hit, everyone said it was the best cake they'd had.

For 20 years of marriage I've been trying to find the perfect chocolate cake for my hubson. Friday night I heard the words I've longed for "now that's my idea of a chocolate cake". Thank you Marsha! BTW - I used the fudge ganche recipe on this site for the topping (see present photo). Yum!

I thought by the name it would be chocolatier and taste more like fudge than chocolate cake. It is moist but not what I expected or hoped. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a regular chocolate cake. I made it in a 9X13 pan and at 30 minutes it was not only done but smelled like it started to burn. If I make it again, I will check it around 25 minutes to maybe get the more fudgey type consistency I was desiring. I didn't frost it, as we just wanted squares of cake.

Easily the best cake I've ever made.  My mom is on a low-sodium diet so she can't do cake mixes, and this cake was perfect for her retirement party.  There weren't a lot of leftovers, but even the leftovers stayed moist!

The cake came out perfect! I made two 9" cakes to use as a layer cake. The cakes were moist and flavorful, without being dense. With a recipe like this, one shouldn't need to purchase a boxed cake mix ever! This will be my go to chocolate cake when I need something delicious in a hurry!

This was very good except I forgot to flour my pan... my bad. I think next time I'm going to try hazelnut flavored coffee or a hazelnut icing. You don't even taste the coffee in the cake for those of you who don't like coffee.

WOW!!!  I've made a lot of cakes in my time, and this is BY FAR the best!! It so so moist and rich.  We don't drink coffee, so I usually substitute a cup of double strength hot chocolate.  A dash of cinnamon also gives it a lot of depth to the flavor.

Followed to a Tee. Amazing! It has the right colour too- not the light colour you get from other mixes. Beats a box mix by miles... No contest. I made it with my own coffee buttercream recipe... to DIE for. The best part is that it's so easy! Really is a one bowl recipe. Moist and has a weight, but not dense. Really is the perfect texture for a cake. I 40 minutes for 2 9" was perfect. Going to make these into cupcakes soon... Thank you!

This cake is pretty good. It is very moist and spongy, I also had problems getting it out of the pan but I realized later that I greased but forgot to flour my pan. The cake is better today, 2 days after I made it. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a chocolate cake like my mother's ( lost the recipe a couple of years ago). I was comfortable with the thin batter because my mom's was very thin, so I wasn't concerned with the result. The cake baked up very moist, dark and chocolatey. I topped it with Whipped Cream Icing. It was super yummy! I work as a 911 dispatcher and took it to the office for a co-worker's birthday. One deputy had a piece and soon they were all there. There wasn't a crumb left! Thanks for the recipe, Marsha. This is now the only chocolate cake for me. It reminds me of my mom's.

This cake is fantastic! Very easy, very tasty. Used "German Chocolate Cake Frosting II" recipe for the icing. Delicious!

I made this for my son's birthday party and it was really good.  It's very easy, the directions are great and the warning that it is runny is spot on.  It bakes up so moist and has a wonderful texture.  The flavor is amazing.  I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and the presentation is very impressive.

Made this for our annual Halloween party. Everyone loved it. I don't really eat a lot of chocolate but tried a small piece. VERY CHOCOLATEY for me but good with a huge glass of milk.

Excellent cake. This recipe was supposedly my Grandmothers secret recipe...until I found it on the back of a Hersheys cocoa can! Anyway, this recipe is awesome. You must use buttermilk or at least half and half. The coffee is essential for the flavor (dont worry it does not make it a coffee flavor, it only adds to the chocolate flavor). You may use applesauce as a replacement for the oil, but it wont be as fluffy a cake as oil would make it. I use less sugar than the 2 cups...I use about 1 3/4 cups. Its still very sweet. YOU DO NOT NEED FROSTING at all! It is that good. Ive tried dusting it with conf sugar but it gets soaked in and disappears so now I dont bother. A local bakery here in my town whips up an espresso chocolate fluffy icing to put on top and its great!

I just made this cake.  I made two 9 inch cakes, to make a layer cake.  Maybe not such a good with this particular recipe.  I greased and floured well, but I had a lot of trouble getting them out of the pans.  I had to piece one of them together.  I tasted one of the chunks that I just could not put back together.  The cake tastes great but has more of a brownie taste.  I have not frosted it yet, and I am very nervous to do so at this point.  But overall, a good recipe!

LOVED this cake. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Be careful to not open the oven before it has finished baking. Topped each slice with heavy whipped cream and maraschino cherries!

I'm not a big chocolate fan but this was very tasty. I made 1 chocolate cupcake and the rest of the batter was used for marble cupcakes along with "Cream Cake" = 4 stars, "Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations" = 3 stars, and "Simple White Cake" 5 stars.

This cake was a huge hit.  I followed the directions exactly, no changes and it was perfect.  A little hard to get it out of the pans but the flavor and moistness of the cake more than made up for that!

When I took this out of the oven, I couldn't WAIT to taste it, but I should have. I did wait until it cooled (well with the exception of what stuck to my fingers when I removed it from the pans). As soon as it was cool, I frosted, cut, served, and ate. I didn't feel any fireworks at all. It was really just okay for me (I watch too much American Idol!). So I cut 1/2 of the cake (3 layers btw), put it in another cake caddy to take to my elderly aunt, and put it all in the fridge. I got a little after 3 in the morning and decided I would try a small piece to see how I felt about it. It was AWESOME!!!! I think it just needs to sit a while. Also, it may be because I had tasted SO MUCH FROSTING when I did have my first piece, the sugar was so unappealing...I don't know. But nonetheless, I wish I hadn't already called my aunt and told her I was bringing her some cake before I realized how good it was!!! Well, I'm glad I did...I didn't need it anyway :-)

Absolutely yummy and moist.  All the recipes I had tried for choc cake just wasn't quite right so I stuck to Aunt Bettys Devils food cake mix.  Now with this recipe, there is no turning back. I found this recipe at 9am this morning and was ready for the school cake stall at 11am.  Gone in 5 mins flat.....waowwwww.  Everybody loved it...  **I doubled the recipe.  Placed mixture into  a lined baking dish: 13.5/14 inches.  Baked at 150 deg celsius for 1 hour.  Trimmed off the edges and topped with chocolate icing (200gm rich dark cooking chocolate and 150mls full cream found on another site)  This made 24 (3/2 inch) slices.

Delish.  I made this for my mother in law's birthday party with a chocolate raspberry glaze.  A hit.  Soft, moist, chocolaty.  I used 1 cup of cocoa and made it a bundt cake.  Cooked it for almost 50 minutes.  Near perfection.

Super easy!!! I did not have buttermilk so I added a 2.5 drops of lemon juice to whole milk.  I cooked it in a bunt pan since my kids prefer no icing.  We cut into it at about 9pm and I woke up to half the cake gone.  This was a pure delight!!!

This cake was unbelievable - it was moist and fluffy and stayed that way for days!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add a few more tablespoons of cocoa to make it really chocolatey.  I made the layers in two 8-inch pans and split them horizontally to make a four-layer cake filled with strawberry mousse, frosted with chocolate buttercream, and decorated with chocolate-dipped strawberries.  Absolutely delicious!

The first time I made it, I baked it for the minimum of 30 minutes.  It seemed done, so I took it out of the oven and then out of the pans after it had cooled ten minutes.  It fell apart.  I tried again, this time baking it for the full 40 minutes and letting it cool for 45 before taking it out of the pans (I wasn’t taking any chances).  I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  So moist and so wonderful!

02.11.2010:FANTASTIC!!ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!Top this cakes with the satiny chocolate glaze (recipe from this site) and hey presto...you've got a world class dessert on your hands!! 04.01.2011: Still ever so YUMMY! I made this for work! The only thing I did different was to not turn this into a layer cake. Instead I poured these into 2 9inch round cake tins (as stated) and used them separately (to form two cakes). The satiny chocolate glaze is what makes this cake out of this world and YUM! :)

This is a great cake - exactly like the "Hershey's ® 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake" and "Deep Dark Chocolate Cake" from this site - only this calls for buttermilk and dark coffee and the others call for milk and boiling water. I did not taste a difference between this and the other cake. It is so moist and very fluffy. I made this into a barbie cake for my daughter's birthday. My "go-to" chocolate cake.

I've never gotten so many compliments on a cake before! I added blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries between the layers and on top after drizzling a chocolate sauce on top. GREAT recipe. It is so moist and the coffee really makes it. It adds a great, subtle flavor. Definitely don't leave it out.

I made cupcakes instead of regular cake, the first batch turned out perfect, they taste great with the sweet cream cheese/coffee frosting that i used. I think i may have done something wrong though because they didn't really taste as sweet as most cake, so i made the mistake of adding about 1/4 cup more sugar after the first batch, and every batch following overflowed and then sunk..I'm not sure if the sugar did it or if I did something wrong. Anyway the first batch was so moist and delicious, I will be trying these again.

My daughter and I have been baking this cake for many years. The recipe was found on the back of the cocoa can. My daughter won first place in her Girl Scout bakeoff with this cake about twenty five years ago. We always use the buttercream frosting from the Wilton cook book using shortening and butter flavor rather then stick butter. This cake is so very moist and rich. The strong coffee is a must. I'm happy to see so many others enjoy it as well.

I made this last night with the "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" recipe from this site.  The cake was delicious, moist and tender.  I had no trouble getting it out of the pan and keeping it in one piece (as some other reviewers have had) but it IS extremely tender.  Whatever frosting you use needs to be super-spreadable or it will tend to tear the cake.  Although the PB frosting was great, it tended to overpower the cake.  Next time, I will use the PB as a layer between the cakes, cover the outside with chocolate, and just dot the top with more PB frosting.

This cake was perfect.  It was moist, yet still contained the cake-like texture when you chew it.  I made it for my moms birthday and there was none left over by the end of the evening (with just a few family & friends to eat it!). My dad has already requested I make this cake for his birthday.  I used a cream cheese frosting on each cake layer, and crumbled oreo cookies between the layers, and on top. I'll try a hazelnut frosting next time.

I made this exactly as written, and the cake would not come out of the pan. I well greased it with Crisco, and floured it. Perhaps letting it sit the 10 minutes in the pan was a big mistake. I debated not doing it, but followed the recipe to the letter. Made this and left in 9 x 13 pan and it was fabulous. No problem getting out in slices.

Ultra moist, dense, and chocolatey! The only substitution I made was using 6 oz. of vanilla low fat yogurt and 2 oz. of fat free half and half for the 1 cup of buttermilk that I did not have.  Frosted with 'Luscious Buttercream Frosting' from this site. Cake can be crumbly when frosting, I popped in the freezer to firm up prior to frosting.

Delicious and moist, just enough dark chocolate flavour without being over-bearing.  I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to my batter and glazed the final cake with rich chocolate ganache.   I used two 5" cake tins to make a four-layer personal birthday cake for my boyfriend.  Just don't fill the tins too much... this cake rises faster than the living dead.

Congratulations to all you reviewers! Strictly because your reviews were so enticing, dropped everything else and made this cake! Followed recipe exactly (which is very rare)using 9 x 13 glass pan and was moaning with delight 40 minutes later as I ate a warm and wonderful piece of chocolate cake.  No need to frost, it is so moist and delicious. Thank you all for the great reviews and last but not least, an excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe!  It is really easy to throw together if you don't have a lot of time.  I made this recipe as cupcakes for a coworkers birthday, changed the cooking time to 22 minutes at 350 degrees.  Everyone raved about them!  I will use this recipe again.

This is absolutely the most incredibly decadent chocolate cake I have ever tasted in my life...let alone made! I made the Black Magic Cake--no substitutions whatsoever--and topped with the Chocolate Ganache recipe found here on this website. Everyone that tasted the cake RAVED and RAVED about it...I will never be able to make a cake from a box ever again(sorry Betty Crocker) If you're looking for an amazing recipe, look no further I

This is just what we were looking for.  I don't keep buttermilk on hand so I soured a cup of whole milk with 1 TBSP vinegar.  Very dark, moist and delicious.  Not real dense, which is the only quality missing to make it a perfect cake.

This cake came out perfect on the first try. The thinness of the batter and its odd taste (who doesn't test taste their batter?)scared me at first. I also had a few setbacks, such as not having any buttermilk. I had to use the tried and true substitute of milk (skim) and vinegar, and got to shave a few calories off in the process. Lacking vegetable oil, I used sunflower and a little olive oil in its place. I feared more for the taste than anything else, but I was relieved to find it tasted like a normal chocolate cake in the end. Lacking regular plain coffee, I had french vanilla instant which added some complexity to the flavor. The only thing I would change would be to enhance the chocolate end of the flavor a bit, so next time I'm using dark cocoa or Dutch. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because the cake didn't 'feel' like a typical, crumbly homemade cake, but leaned more towards the texture of a boxed cake mix in its moist and smooth properties which I much prefer. Don't skimp on the sugar. Usually I add only half the sugar called for in recipes, but having tried that and tasting the batter, I could tell the cake's flavor was going to suffer (I know batter and cake taste fairly different from each other, but you taste enough batter over the years, you can tell what direction its going in cake form), -especially- if you have to substitute in the buttermilk like I had to.

This is THE BEST RECIPE! I will use this recipe as my signature cake from now on. I didn't use coffee and opted for hot chocolate instead.  Also, instead of buttermilk, I used I cup milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  It was fantastic.  Great with cream cheese frosting too!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am a rookie cake decorator looking for good recipes and this is the best chocolate cake I've tried by far! My husband isn't a cake person but demanded a second helping after one bite of the first. I'm not a coffee drinker and saw the idea to substitute with hot chocolate. I also didn't have butter milk and used the vinegar + milk substitute instead. This is a keeper and will be used for all future cakes. Thanks a million!!

Made this cake for a birthday dinner and it was a BIG success!  We followed the recipe exactly as written (except we didn't have buttermilk so we used 1/4 cup buttermilk powder with 1 cup water) - but other than that it was just as written.  We had no problem getting the cakes out of the pan (some reviewers had problems with this - we buttered and floured the pans). We used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site and it went really well with this cake.  Highly recommended and we will bake this cake again and again. 5 stars!

This was the best cake I ever made. It was so moist and rich I didn't even need icing. I just used coaco powder, milk, and confectioner sugar to make a chocolate glaze. I'm on permanent dessert duty at all parties I attend now thanks to this cake!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever had! It is so moist and rich.  ............Absolute Perfection!
I added raspberry filling between the layers and frosted with a whipped chocolate ganache, topped with fresh raspberries.

THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I'VE EVER MADE & EATEN!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half and used one 9 inch cake pan.  No need for me to find any other recipe for my chocolate fix!  Thank you Marsha!

This was terrific!
I used a Chocolate Glaze frosting using 
100g dark cooking chocolate, 1/2c cream and 1/2 c sugar melted over low heat and whipped till glossy. Spread on cake and left overnight. The chocolate frosting was absorbed, making it moister than ever. Divine. Thanks again for a great recipe!

I'm a box mix kinda gal- I actually prefer them to home-made cakes which I think are always either dry or too heavy.  Not this cake!!  It is DELICIOUS, perfectly moist, and really not too hard to make, as long as you're careful not to let it fall.  Especially yummy with buttercream icing.  I will be making this again and again.

this cake tastes fantastic and is so easy to make! I brought it to work for a pitch-in and it barely made it through  lunch. I also made the recipe into cupcakes for a toddler playdate. I was worried that they would run over since the batter is so thin - but they turned out great. The kids ate the whole cupcake and the mothers took the rest home.

This is almost as good as my mom's salad dressing cake.  I made halloween cupcakes with the batter and everyone loved them.  They were especially good after they had sat overnight in the fridge.  Will be saving this recipe for all my chocolate cupcake needs.

Fantastic cake--moist and great flavor.  Easy to make.  I will make it again.  However, I had a VERY hard time getting the cake out of the pan despite greasing and flouring the pans.  Next time I will use parchment on the bottom of the pan.  Also because it is so moist, it is very delicate and needs a light creaming icing or glaze.  All in all, the best chocolate cake I've made from scratch and I've tried many!

ths cake is great. I did melt an ounce of unsweetened chocolate in the coffee. Next time I will use parchement paper in the bottom of my pans, it stuck and fell apart :(. But it's not the recipes fault.

i made this before i went to bed, and when i woke up at 10AM my family had eaten the enitre thing. pretty amazing

Not just for Halloween!  This has become my favorite chocolate cake to bake.  It's so easy and it comes out so moist and tasty!

I bake it in a bundt pan -- it takes 55 - 65 minutes.  Then I drizzle it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  People rave about how good it is.

This cake is absolutely delicious... I make it for company all the time and it always gets rave reviews.  It is so moist and tasty.  I like to add a layer of toffee bits in between two cake layers with chocolate frosting and WOW!!

Great recipe, so glad I tried it. The very best from scratch cake I have made.  I made one alteration in the recipe, left out the coffee and replaced it with 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Frosted it with a chocolate fudge frosting it was amazing!

Lovely chocolatey cake that doesn't taste of coffee. I halved the recipe and topped it with the coffee frosting as suggested (didn't really like the frosting) think a plain vanilla frosting would work better. I also served this up warm with thick heavy cream. Even better and not too sickly. 
Edit (02/03/2008) Made this again and it came out really heavy and oily tasting. As the first was such a success I made it for when friends came over and was very disappointed. Not sure what happened but don't think I'll risk it again.

I agree with Cindydraper - it does have a slighty odd, spongy texture.  But it does get less noticable after a few days - if it last that long.  Despite the texture, the taste was good!  I served this cake to a friend on his B-day who doesn't like coffee at all.  And he liked the cake & said he wouldn't have known coffee was in it if I hadn't told him.     
Overall, a good cake, but I was expecting better.

Overall, I thought this cake was great.  It had a slightly odd texture though...a kind of spongy that I wasn't expecting.  No one else mentioned this so I wonder if I did something wrong.  I poured some cherry jam (more like cherry syrup because it didn't set up on me right!)over the cake and then topped with real whipped cream.  I thought it was very good that way and the texture was less noticable after a day or two in the fridge.

i first tried this cake two days ago as i wanted to give it as a gift to my friend for an Islamic holiday, the Eid al-Fitr. Now i had never made flour-based cakes before, always had left it to mom to do the job, so i was not sure that i could make even a decent cake. I followed the recipe to the letter, and.. VOILA, it was so great that my friend said for next year's Eid she would order the cake from me instead from stores! and, since making this cake twice in as many days (because my mom said its sooo good so let's make it for ourselves) and always turned out great, my mom became unconfident with her cake-making skill. now am the designated cake maker in the family. Thanks much Marsha for the great recipe.

This cake is FANTASTIC! I would strongly advise using larger baking pans however. It bubbled over the sides of my 9 x 13-inch. Others say they had issues with getting the coffee flavor to stand out...I just brewed strong coffee in my coffee-maker and used a cup; came out wonderful.

This is the exact recipe from the Hershey's Kitchen website.  I find this recipe even better than the Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake.  The sweetness is just right.  For the sourmilk, I added 1 TBSP of white vinegar to 1 cup of milk.  A professional baker also advised me that instead of greasing and flouring the pans, just line the pan with Glad Bake.  This solved my problem.

Cake was a hit! Everyone liked it. I baked it for 35 minutes and it came out perfect and used cool whipped frosting. I can't say I noticed the coffee flavor though...maybe not strong enough....I used 1 Tablespoon of coffee for 1 cup of water.

This cake was delicious! The only change that I made was that I only did a dash of salt instead of 1 tsp. Oh and I don't drink coffee so I used just water with a teaspoon of postum added.   I baked in a 9 x 13 for 36 mins.  It fell just the slightest bit.  For the topping, I mixed 4 oz softened cream cheese with 1/2 c powdered sugar. Then add 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 ts vanilla and 1/8 ts almond extract.   In a separare bowl, whip 1 cup of whipping cream with1 T sugar and 1/2 ts vanilla.  Fold into the cream cheese mixture.   I put this on the cake when cooled and put in the frig overnight.  The next day, for the birthday party, I thawed a bag of the mixed berries that you get at costco,  added a bit of sugar and topped each serving of cake with a generous amount of the fruit mixture.  It was absolutely delicious!  My kids also like to top this with cherry pie filling instead of the mixed berries.  Very moist and delicious.  It was so much better than a cake mix cake and it was ready before the oven was heated to 350!

I am SO DISAPPOINTED with this recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter and it did not turn out.  First of all the cake  fell.  It was not moist and was crumbly.  I used a 9X13 air pan and I'm wondering if somehow that could be the problem.

What a great moist, easy, not too sweet cake. Why not serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream like I did? But don't leave out any of the sugar, it's just right.

5 stars for quick preparation.  I bake it in a 9 x 13 pan for 45 minutes and top it with a simple butter icing.  Dark and moist although I reduce the sugar slightly and use only half a tsp. of salt.

Made this for my husband's birthday, and this is now the official chocolate cake at our house!  It's the moistest chocolate cake ever!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Delightful with the cinnamon coffee frosting, but would be great alone, as well.

Very good and moist. Better the second day. I don't recommend using a Bundt pan as I did on my first try. It wouldn't come out of the pan! We used an almond flavored coffee and it was really delicious. Needed an extra 15 minutes of baking time, perhaps because of our higher altitude here in Colorado.

This cake is delicious!  I usually make it layered with a raspberry filling and the two flavors match perfectly.  I would recommend this recipe to any serious chocolate lovers.

This cake was easy to make!  My son saw me add the coffee, and vowed that he would not eat any cake.  After looking at the cake, he decided to take a bite, he loved it!  I think that it is better the second day.  I served it with ice cream and hot fudge.  Thanks for the recipe, it's our families new chocolate cake recipe.

This makes a very dark, rich, moist, heavy cake.  I thought it had a slightly bitter edge with the coffee and the cocoa ... but it was not unpleasant at all.  I iced this one, but I think I'd go with a dusting of powdered sugar the next time.

I've been searching a long time for a super-moist, yet easy, chocolate cake recipe.  This is one of the richest chocolate cakes I've ever had.  Absolutely delicious!  I've made it twice now, once as a layer cake with frosting and once as a sheet cake; I think it works even better as the latter.  It doesn't even need frosting -- just a little confectioner's sugar on top, and you're ready to go.  Many, many compliments.

This is the most moist and easiest chocolate cake recipe around!  All ingredients added at one, even the most unskilled baker or children can have a perfect cake every time!  This is our family favorite.

This cake turned out dense, moist and delicious.  It was not as sweet as most chocolate cakes I've had, and I really liked that.  Tasted to me more like a cake I would get at a nice restaurant.  My niece said she thought it was the best chocolate cake I had made (previous to this one I've always made the boxed cakes).  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because there was a depression in each of the rounds.  I overcame the problem by filling the depression in the bottom round with mini chocolate chips to help support the top round.  This actually turned out to be a happy fix!

This is the best deep, rich chocolate cake I've ever eaten. It's the only recipe I use. The coffee and buttermilk make it moist and flavorful. Try it with mint buttercream frosting!

I used this recipe to make a layer cake with raspberry jam filling and white chocolate frosting for my son's birthday. It was fantastic! 

I followed the recipe exactly and baked the batter in two 9" cake pans sprayed with non-stick baking spray. The cakes  foamed up early in the baking process in a way that made me nervous, but in the end, they baked perfectly flat and even, just right for layering. I left them in the oven for the full 40 minutes, but the cake was still very moist. If you are in doubt about whether the cake is done or not, it is probably safe to just leave them in a little extra, be sure they firm up enough.

The cake itself was delicious. The buttermilk and coffee give it some complexity, but it is not too heavy or rich. I used raspberry jam in the center and white chocolate frosting studded with fresh raspberries on the exterior. It was a great tasting, pretty cake, even better on the second day. Highly recommend!

This is almost the  Herseys recipe, difference is buttermilk and coffee . I do use coffee to replace hot water in recipe and whole milk instead of buttermilk.. Super moist, you do not taste the coffee, it enhances the cocoa flavor. 
Easily doubled for 4 layers. Impressive and delicious.

The cake was fantastic. I ended up using a glass 9x13 pan and it still came out great, just a little less time in the oven. It was so moist. I made a confection sugar glaze out of a 1942 cookbook and that just topped off the cake.

I have made this cake twice now, both times it was a huge hit. The batter is very runny, don't be alarmed by this as it bakes to a perfectly dense, soft consistency. Before frosting this cake I would suggest placing it in the fridge for at least an hour (or the freezer if you're under a time crunch, as I was the first time I made it). It is very "crumby" and sticky to the touch, so much easier to frost when cold to firm it up. When I tasted it warm I was not blown away, I think the true magic to this cake comes when it is served at room temperature or even fridge temperature, and it tastes even better on the second day. Decadent, chocolatey, moist and delicious. Don't be afraid to add more coffee if you like a coffee flavour, otherwise you won't taste it (it just deepens the chocolate flavour). Yum!

Simple to make and unbelievable flavor! Used Hershey dark cocoa powder and chilled espresso, with a peanut butter frosting. Put half of it in an 8x8 square pan and the rest of the batter made over a dozen cupcakes. Didn't last more than a day. Amazing how thin the batter is, but it baked perfectly per the instructions. My go to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

I just make this as I needed a good chocolate cake recipe to make a football cake with. I haven't iced it yet but I did slice the top off to make it flat and ate the cuttings-- very very good! Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of making buttermilk substitute with milk and lemon juice.

(Will update this later when I attempt try number 2 of making this cake. Basically first attempt did not go as planned.... ) This definitely caused some Black Magic in the house to say the least.... After mixing all ingredients together and getting pans out, I realized I had forgot to preheat the oven. So I did that and started preparing to put batter in pan when all of a sudden a fuse blew in the oven and it started shooting sparks everywhere and small flames. After the entire house freaked out and a nine year old is now scared of the kitchen, we decided we’d either have to refrigerate batter or toss it until we got a new oven. While some people still very much wanted to eat this today, I put it in the microwave at 50% power for 20 minutes in a glass casserole dish. Turned out decent but ended up tasting like the brownies/cakes in frozen TV dinners that you nuke. May be attempting to make this again once we get new range...

I have made this cake about 15 times.  It is the BEST chocolate cake. The recipe works well with substitutions too. I’ve done it gluten free (I like Bob’s Red Mill 1-1 gluten free flour) and with wheat flour.  I rarely have buttermilk, so have made it with soured milk (adding 1 T vinegar to whole milk), with almond milk, or other nut milk.  The recipe has never failed me. It is chocolatey, light and fluffy, and doesn’t need frosting.  A little vanilla ice cream is perfect, or whipped cream.  I have made it in a 9 x 13 pan, as cupcakes, and as a layer cake.  All perfect.  Hooray for Black Magic cake!!!

This cake does not need salt nor 2 t. Of baking soda. If I make it again 1 will use NO salt and 1 t. Baking soda. Overkill with baking powder, baking soda and salt.  It took away from the flavor.

This cake turned out so good it never made it to the next day.  The only reason I didn’t take a picture is that I’m not good at decorating the frosting but that didn’t stop this crew from devouring it.

Followed recipe exactly and my family went wild over it. Made cupcakes, baked for 20 minutes...ended up having to make a second sheetcake to keep my father and husband from devouring the cupcakes for the party. Was fantastic with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

I've made this twice now, once as a cake and another as cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect. I did follow the advice of others and freeze it when I made the  cake so it was easier to frost. It is very moist, so delicate to handle. It's a very light cake, so wouldn't be overbearing with a rich icing or would also go well with a lighter whipped frosting. I did both and liked it both way! 

I ended up freezing some of the cupcakes too and they held up well for a week. This will be my go to chocolate cake recipe.

I've done this recipe for multiple occasions, including banquets, parties, and for friends! I always substitute the expresso for cold brew and it turns out exactly the same. Also, the buttermilk can be substituted and the taste is exactly the same. This is also the perfect bundt cake and is my go to cake recipe!

IT is my go-to chocolate cake, though I don't recommend too big of a slice for anyone under the age of 7 (unless you want to chase around super hyper kids).

I have been making this cake for at least 7 yrs now. You know how you always like to try other recipes and just see if there is one better? Well,  I don’t even attempt to try another chocolate cake anymore!  I wouldn’t change a thing about it. I use a chocolate butter cream frosting and it is to die for!!  Even my picky neighbor who HATES cake of any kind told me she cannot believe how good and moist this cake is. It’s a definite keeper for sure!! P.s. I’m not one to give reviews, but this truly deserves it!!!

Made with original ingredients, but substituted buttermilk with one tablespoon vinegar to one cup milk.  My gas oven needed 50 minutes for 9x13, dark glass dish.  
While cake was warm, I poked numerous holes in the cake, mixed two good squirts chocolate syrup with one can sweetened condensed milk, and poured this mixture over warm cake.  Absolutely decadent!

I adore this cake! It is so moist, flavourful, and isn't overly sweet. Extremely versatile and can accommodate a plethora of fillings, frostings and toppings. I have used this recipe at least 10 times using different ovens, and it has never failed me.

This scrum-dil-ee-um-ptios Cake was a hit at my Satanic Cult  meeting. That icing was all gobbled up before our sacrifice. The cake itself was devious. Just the most satanic cake ive ever had :)

Followed the recipe and everyone loved the cake, it was moist, light and chocolatey. I used a butter cream frosting from this site to. I froze a slice of the cake and when it was thawed out it was just as good as when it was first baked.

The amount of sugar was a lot!!! I used the same weight(not cup) for both flour and sugar and was perfect.
I used cake flour which made it more fluffy.
I loved the idea of using coffee! It made the chocolate flavor come out.

This makes the perfect chocolate cake. I follow the recipe exactly. I've made it in a 9x13 pan as well as in two 9 in round pans for a layer cake. It is perfectly dense and moist. The middle of mine looked to be sunken in just a little bit but it was cooked through and delicious. Both times I've made it I've used a homemade milk chocolate frosting and it was divine. For the coffee I just buy instant coffee packets and make a cup using those. My 'go to' chocolate cake from now on. No complaints.

Excellence recipe. I used gluten free all-purpose flour and decreased the amount of gf flour slightly because of how dense it it. It turned out perfect. Totally moist and flavourful. For a scratch recipe this was so easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe

This was my first attempt at chocolate cake from scratch.  I used this recipe to build a black forest birthday cake for my wife.  This recipe turned out fantastic and would use it again.  I used 1/2 cup less sugar and un-sweetened whipping cream as it had cherry filling and I served it with Baileys.

It was pretty good, I decided to make a German chocolate cake with pre-made frosting. That was a mistake, as I believe those ingredients brought the quality of this cake down. Next time, I'll be sure to make the frosting homemade to do this cake a little more justice! By itself, it's very moist but not as chocolatey as I like. Give this recipe a try.

No changes, good as is.  I just love this cake. It's my go-to chocolate cake. Chocolate-y and moist, you don't even need frosting, as I found out when my frosting tanked.  Sprinkled cupcakes with powdered sugar and they were great. My only caution--do not overbake.  The appeal of this cake is in it's moistness and tenderness, even a few extra minutes will dry it and you'll notice a difference.  I am not a chocoholic.  I love chocolate but prefer this cake with a (real) buttercream or whipped cream frosting.

I love this recipe! I’ve made it twice now, once as a cake, once as cupcakes. If I made it out of cupcakes again, I would heat the oven less, but the cake was perfect. I highly recommend this recipe, especially with raspberry and chocolate ganache.

This cake tasted amazing and had a great moist texture, but was absolutely impossible to get out of the pans and frost. It broke into pieces and was extremely fragile, so much so that frosting it almost made it collapse. I followed the recipe exactly and properly greased/floured the pans, so I'm not sure what happened. It tasted great, though.

A winner!  I am not a baker, in fact I never bake cakes.  This one was easy and came out delicious.  So thankful it worked :) 

I baked the full 40 minutes and it still seemed a bit softer in the centre, but was totally fine.  

I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, and greased the sides of the pan.  Came out very easily.  

Even after sitting on the counter all day was still moist.  

I froze the cake, covered in saran wrap for 15 minutes before icing and that worked as well.

Question:  Can anyone recommend a fluffy white icing to pair with this cake?  I tried the Ermine and failed it.   Will try again but if any recommendations??

Terrible! I followed the recipe exactly. The texture was a bit gummy from being too moist and the taste was super weak. Looked like the photos so visually it was fine but I still threw it away.

I made this cake without any changes and it was deleicious. Everyone attending the get-together I made the cake for loved it... I filled the cake with a raspberry buttercream and  frosted with chocolate and buttercream dyed green(made a football cake). The flavors were excellent. Can't wait to try this with my chocolate flan recipe! 100 percent keeper, my new go-to choc cake recipe. thank you to whomever posted this recipe!!!

This is my go-to cake recipe for picky cake eaters. I add a liberal amount of coconut extract to the batter, and then frost it with a coconut cream cheese frosting- sometimes I’ll sprinkle mini chocolate chips in between the two cake layers in the frosting. The cake flavor is rich, chocolate-y, and delicious. The other sub I use is one cup of espresso instead of one cup of strongly brewed coffee. My mother, who hates coffee, LOVES this cake.

I don’t bake. But I baked this and it turned out worthy of every chocolate cake craving I’ve ever had. I frosted it with a homemade cream cheese icing and sprinkled it with crushed candy canes. It is absolutely amazing when served frozen. Wonderful recipe.

This is my very favorite chocolate cake recipe and my family dreams about it! That said, this recipe was plagiarized verbatim from Hershey’s. It’s important (and ethical) to give credit to original sources.  I am surprised that Allrecipes published it in their magazine without checking for plagiarism.

What I would do is have an optional frosting part of this recipe. When I made my frosting, I made a buttercream frosting and it was delicious.

All-in-all it was an OK cake recipe.

I made this exactly as written -- yummo!  Lovely moist texture, not crumbly, but not heavy -- holds its shape beautifully in a layer cake.  I made a mocha buttercream frosting that complemented it nicely.  One note:  the batter is VERY thin, and when I looked at the cake halfway through baking, it looked bizarre!  The top of the center looked completely baked, and it was surrounded by a ring of liquid batter that was not even close.  I was really worried, but it all evened out in the end.  I baked exactly 30 minutes and they were perfect.

I recently made this for a get-together with friends and it was an absolute hit!!! I made Whipped Cream Frosting to keep the dessert decadent and not too sweet. I will certainly it be making this again very soon!

We used cassava and tapioca flour instead of regular flour-for a grain free cake and it turned out perfect.  Such a gooey delicious cake.  All in one bowl is a bonus, love this recipe, will make it over and over again,

This was my first time baking a cake from scratch. Turned out 
perfect. Also tried a trick for moist cake, I saw in the recipe for Spintz cake to cover it with foil and a towel while cooling. Made it a layer cake and topped it with (homemade) buttercream frosting. Even MIL who doesnt like chocolate cake raved about it.  Definitely going to make it again!

Great recipe, a big hit with my family. I followed the recipe exactly but baked at 325 degrees  since I tend to get dome tops on all my cakes when I bake at 350.  I was really pleased with the taste and shape of the cakes.  This is my new chocolate cake recipe.  It was easy too. I used Coffee butter frosting from this site and it was a great combination.

Pretty good, especially the coffee in the batter. I could taste te coffee; it gave the cake a  deeper chocolate flavor. However, the reason I did not give five stars is because I like a denser, more fudgey, texture in chocolate cake.

Great flavor. Easy to make.  Like others have said, the batter is thin and it needs to bake the full 40 minutes.  Worth the wait.  This cake is not overly sweet.  I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting, but if you like a sweeter dessert go with a butter cream; would also work well with whipped cream and cherries!  It stores well and stays moist.

This cake is a winner! I tried four other chocolate cake recipes before settling on this one as my go-to. It bakes evenly, stacks strongly, and tastes very chocolaty! I'll be making it again and again!

I like this cake, but it completely fell apart while trying to frost. I had to stick pieces back on with frosting. Next time I will try partially freezing the layers before frosting.

A+++++++++++++!  What a great cake!  I have been searching, testing, and trying to find the chocolate cake of my childhood memories.  Well, my search is over.  Made exactly as written, not only is this cake moist, decadent and delicious — it was a snap to make with ingredients I typically have on hand.  I paired it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting from this site and though it was a rich combination, it was divine. Oh and don’t worry if your batter is very thin going into the pan, mine was and the cake was perfect in about 35 minutes.  Thank you for sharing — DELICIOUS!!!

I’ve had time to let these cupcakes cool, and I have to retract my second star review. This has got to be the worse cake I’ve ever made. I followed the recipe word for word and the texture is so wrong. Have you folks ever made a real cake? This cake turned out crumbly, dry and crunchy. I threw it away and I’ve never thrown away a dessert! This recipe was such a terrible disappointment!

I live at 7000ft. For high altitude, decrease sugar by 1/4c, increase flour to 2 1/4 c, decrease baking powder to 1 1/4tsp and decrease baking soda to 3/4tsp.

Wow, this cake is so good. It reminds me of the moist, delicious box cakes I used to make growing up, before realizing the additives in the cake mixes were toxic (and they probably weren't as bad as today's cake mixes!). It is a texture that every American will love. It's a very easy cake to make. I will be adding this to my recipe box. I am making the cake again with a peanut butter frosting, and the next time, I won't make any frosting! I love it just plain. My mom laughed because she said all that trouble to taste like a box cake, but I reminded her "without the harmful additives." :) 

The first time I made the cake, I used 8 1/2" cake tins, lined with parchment paper. Big mistake! It was too much batter, so the cake rose up and over the edges, dripping onto the oven bottom, before sinking back down. But the flavor was so good, I went ahead and made a the frosting found in the All Recipes Magazine (April-May 2018, pg. 102). However, I am not delicate enough for milk chocolate (I find 65% chocolate much easier to melt down), so I used 65% baking chips instead, and only 3 cups of confectioners sugar. 

The cake tasted very good, but the frosting was too sweet for my taste, so this time, I am making a peanut butter frosting, and letting the cake cool down before frosting it. This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes.

Update 7/23/18:  The cake was still too crumbly, probably due to Hawaii's climate, so I used 3 eggs and only 1/2 cup of coffee and added some instant esp

This is the first from scratch cake I have ever made.  It was DELICIOUS & I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked it for 50 minutes & that was the sweet spot for bake time.  I made it in a bundt pan and topped it with a decadent ganache which I also found on all recipes!! My husband hates chocolate but loved this cake.  Will definitely make this my go to chocolate cake recipe.

I followed some of the reviewers suggestions  and sifted the dry ingredients and tried not to overmix.  I used a 9 x 13 pyrex pan and didn't even try to lift it out--just served from the pan.  The result is a fabulous chocolate cake, light but rich.  It doesn't really need a frosting.  I just whipped fresh whipped cream and spread it over it. Perfect.  It is admittedly a little prone to falling apart, ut if you chill it and dig deep and support it, it works out well.  I think it would make great cupcakes also, but would probably choose another recipe if I wanted to layer and decorate.

This cake was horrendous! My teenager daughter made it. She’s a beginner baker and has been doing a really nice job with most things. I think the mistake she made was using hot coffee. The eggs must have cooked before incorporating into the batter. So, my feedback is to please specify hot or cold when using items not typically used for baking. This is a site where many beginners are learning and it’s disappointing to have something turnout so badly and have no idea why.

Good cake! Do not overbake. For frosting, I made a vanilla buttercream and it paired nicely with the chocolate. Once cooled, I like to put the cake in the freezer right before frosting to get fewer chocolate crumbles in the icing

Excellent cake!  I followed the recipe directions and it came out perfectly.  The only addition I made was adding about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips (sprinkled with a little flour so they don't fall to the bottom of the pan) as my granddaughters insist on chocolate cake with chips in it.   Big hit--everyone loved it!

Substituted one cup of Greek yogurt for the buttermilk and baked for 40 mins!  Delish. Also increase cocoa a bit and bake in 9x13 pan.

This recipe is amazing! I used half coconut palm sugar and half honey. It was a little dark, but that can be changed with what kind of frosting you use.

So far this is probably my favorite recipe on this site. I am someone who has always preferred box cake mixes to cakes from scratch but this cake was almost as good to me as box cake. I will probably use this as my go to recipe for when I dont have a box mix at home.

The only problem with this recipe, is that both times I've tried to make this cake,the bottom of the cake stuck to the pan. But it tasted so good!

This is one the very best chocolate cakes I have ever made!  I have people ask me to make this all the time.  I use a chocolate fudge buttercream frosting and chocolate mousse in between the layers.  Very decadent!

This cake is moist, delicious, and easy to frost. It came out of the pans easily and I couldn’t have been more pleased. I used Coffee Butter Frosting as some reviews have suggested. I doubled the frosting to ice the two layer cake but I did not like the combination although the frosting and the cake were both delicious. I will use a vanilla cream cheese frosting next time.

Great easy chocolate cake recipe! Rich and moist - don’t let the liquid-y batter fool you - comes out great. Can be used as a base to make so many varied desserts. This one is a keeper for me.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I cannot see why in the world this recipe is rated so high. I made this recipe as cupcakes. I don't think I've ever made cupcakes in my life that didn't rise -- this recipe barely rose at all. I should have known from the extreme thinness of the batter. The taste couldn't even make up for the flatness -- there was barely any chocolate flavor. If I had the time, I'd toss these and make a different recipe, but I'm going to have to try to salvage them with some high frosting for the Halloween party I'm taking them to.

I used butter instead of vegetable oil but other than that I followed the recipe exact. I don't believe I have ever had a cake this moist. It was delicious with butter cream icing with chocolate chips.

This cake was delicious , unbelievable good.  Oh my ,I had friends over for dinner & this was our desert along with coffee. My friends raved about this cake & frosting. I will diffently be making this cake recipe again for sure. I would not make changes on this cake mix, in regards to the frosting I put in little by little the buttermilk in mixture until I liked the smooth texture of frosting. Keep doing the great job on posting wonderful recipes because I know I will be making , I loved to entertain family , friends & guests. Thank you.

A wonderfully moist, chocolate cake full of chocolate flavor. I baked it in a 9" by 13" cake pan, sprinkled some dark chocolate mini chips on top (the batter seemed to thin to stir them in), baked the cake for an additional 5 minutes and used a butter, mocha frosting. I baked this last minute for the first time for my mother's 91st birthday and she made sure she kept the leftovers.

Cake was delicious, I did make it in a 9X13 inch pan and didn't have coffee on hand so instead I used one cup of hot chocolate, as well as ran out of milk but had buttermilk, therefore substituted both, now it was still delicious but I had made this cake prior with the coffee and  coffee just puts it over the top! Again if in a pinch hot chocolate will do but coffee to me really makes this cake.Great recipe will make again.

The flavor was wonderful and it is such a moist cake.  Unfortunately I had problems removing the second layer from the 9 inch round pan.   I will probably go with a 13x9 pan next time.   It is a keeper!

This was the first cake I ever made from scratch, and it turned out perfectly. I have made it several times, and it's perfect every time. The cake tastes even more moist if you refrigerate it overnight. I highly recommend this recipe.

I love chocolate but I don't like chocolate cake but this cake was addicting!! It was so moist and not too rich. This will be a recipe I will make for birthdays and holidays. It's a must try.

I made this cake exactly as directed. Delicious. So good it inspired me to write my first review. The batter was so thin I had my doubts when I poured it in the pans, but it came out of the oven moist and medium density. We ate it with strawberries and whipped cream. Next time I will try a buttercream frosting. This is my new favorite chocolate cake.

The first time I made this I did not have buttermilk so I used regular milk and added vinegar as a buttermilk substitute and it came out spongy but tasted okay. The second time I made it I still did the buttermilk substitute but I used a teaspoon of baking soda instead of 2 teaspoons and I used Hershey's Special dark cocoa powder instead of unsweetened and what I got was heaven. It was so delicious and moist.

I made this into cupcakes! I had pretty much everything on hand, which was nice. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used whole milk (and mixed it with my coffee first so I didn't accidentally cook the eggs) and it came out delicious. I'd have preferred if they held together a little better in the cups, but I'm sure it's fine as actual cake. In any case: this is delicious and perfect with white or milk or dark chocolate buttercream frosting. I was very concerned about the extremely thin consistency of the batter, but it all worked out and I wanted to eat them all as soon as they came out.

Loved it! I didn't have any vege oil so I substituted with 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c coconut oil, turned out great with the slightest nutty taste from the coconut oil. I couldn't taste the coffee but it probably made it richer. Oh and definitely use pam baking spray if you don't want your cake to stick to the pan! I used Crisco and flour the first time and it didnt cut it, but pam baking spray did the trick beautifully. Excellent recipe - will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake and cupcake cravings!

This is an easy and affordable dessert that delivers the classic chocolate cake experience with minimal effort. I have made this recipe as written in both 9×13 and round pans multiple times with great results. However, the most recent time I ran out of flour and subbed 1/2 cup of quick oats. I don't know what happened but it turned out every bit as good with the oats (likely even better if you like your chocolate cakes more brownie-like). Try this recipe; you will not regret it!

Absolutely perfect! I was craving a nice, moist, rich chocolate cake and that's exactly what I got. I made cupcakes instead of a cake and found that because the batter is so thin it didn't rise quite as much as normal, so they were a little short, but they were still delicious. I made mine with a very strong  espresso witch added to the richness. I also used a great cream cheese frosting (16 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c. butter, 1 c. confectioner's sugar, 2 tsp vanilla) that paired perfectly!

This cake is the best of best!!!!!   I would give 10 stars, if I could.  I didn't have butter milk so I used regular whole milk and white vinegar combo.  I added 1/8 cup of rum to the batter to get rid of flour taste which turns out amazing.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is the best chocolate cake ever! It is very moist and very easy to make. I used a stabilized whipped cream icing ( also, from this site) and it was perfect for it! You must try it! I guarantee you will love it!

This cake was a HUGE hit. The only change I made was to cut the baking soda and powder in half, as mentioned by another reviewer, to get a denser cake. My friend's husband who does not like sweets loved the cake.  I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site which turned out perfectly. Both recipes are keepers.

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe.  The chocolate flavor was rich but not overpowering and the cake was incredibly moist.  Make sure you use high quality cocoa powder to get the best chocolate flavor.

Great tasting cake. Easy to make. It's a very fluffy and light cake though that makes it hard to stack the layers without breaking.

wow! Best homemade cake I've ever made! I brewed fresh ground vanilla hazelnut coffee beans, which smelled incredible while it was cooking. I also used round cake pans and one side of the cake was quite notably higher than the other, but its an easy fix to just cut it off. This cake is VERY soft so i greased my pans really well and I cooked them for about 30minutes, checked with a toothpick and they were JUST cooked, so I added another 4 minutes to cook time so a bit more moisture evaporates out and they aren't so hard to get from the pan (many people mentioned their cake fell apart). I am so glad I added the extra 4 minutes because they just barely came out of the pan in one piece and still super soft.  
I also used this chocolate buttercream frosting.
This cake is a HUGE hit!!! This is probably the only chocolate cake I will ever make from now on.

This cake is "magic"!  If you made it and it's not moist or didn't satisfy your chocolate need, it's you, not the recipe.  It was so simple and  one of the best cakes I've made to date.  A true winner!

I loved this recipe, but I did make some changes. I substituted flour and milk for the gluten and dairy free alternatives. I also used half the baking powder and half the baking soda, so it was denser and more like fudge, which I prefer.

This was sooooo moist. Soooooo rich!   Everyone, 30+ people, raved.  I will definitely make it again. I used dark cocoa. It's all I ever use anymore because it enriches any chocolate recipe.  I've been told it's now my admission fee when I visit and stay with dear friends.  It also makes killer cupcakes but because the cake is so moist it sticks to the paper liner.  Oh well. It's worth it.  Note:  doesn't rise as much in the middle as most cake recipes.  No dome to cut off.

Fabulous cake!  I don't understand why so many cooks are having trouble, I make and bake exactly as directed (I do always line my cake pans with a circle of waxed paper in the bottom) and it comes out perfect every time!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe there is. I have been making  it for years. I cant understand why Pookiepie214 says its not chocolatey enough. You have to use a good cocoa powder and if thats not chocolatey enough... add more. I have seen this recipe with different amounts of the ingredients. One recipe called for 1 cup of cocoa powder and instant coffee powder along with the hot coffee. I have tried many of the recipes for this cake and they all come out perfectly.    Pookie.... i  hope you try it again.

I was terrified when it came out of the oven. I am not a cook and it looked terrible to me. By the time I finished frosting it, though ,it looked beautiful, but I was afraid of what was underneath. As it turns out, the cake tastes amazing and my whole family loved it. Huge success. Moist and delicious. So much winning. Great recipe, don't give up on it until it is finished.

I’ve used this chocolate cake recipe so many times and it’s utterly perfect. It’s rich and moist and my go to chocolate cake recipe when I make layer cakes. I make this cake in high altitude, about 6,000 feet, and don’t even have to make any adjustments to the recipe.

Really delicious.  I've made it several times.  Doesn't need frosting, it's that moist and tasty.

I've made it in a 13x9 pan each time, and every time, the center sinks.

This was tasty, but a bit bland. It needed something more- maybe chocolate chips or more sugar? It was done in about 27 minutes, and had risen somewhat unevenly.

It was very moist and rich in flavor. I would for sure make it again and again. I might even make it for my mother´s 50th birthday. I just hope I have all the ingredients. Might have to see if my dad will help me with buying any needed items. :)

Great recipe.  I followed instructions to a tee, except I substituted butter instead of vegetable oil.  And, I cream my butter and sugar first before adding other ingredients.  I messed up and used store bought frosting and it was not complementary to the cake.  The cake, alone is soo delicious.  Please make your own frosting.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe several times (I'd say at least 10).  This cake is absolutely delicious--moist and chocolatey! But it almost always falls in the middle.  It doesn't seem to matter what kind of cake pans I use - 9x13 or two 9-inch rounds - it always sinks in the middle or just never rises (though the edges always do. I was just Googling this problem and found a comment that said to try using sour cream instead of buttermilk, so I'll do that next time.  Someone else said baking it at a lower temperature might help. So frustrating because it's such a delicious cake!

There's not much else I can say (all the reviews tell the story), but this cake got rave reviews when I brought it into work!  I don't even like chocolate, but I could tell it was good from the smell and texture.  I would suggest spraying your cake pans liberally and lining the bottom with parchment paper, as the cake WILL stick if you don't!  Highly recommend.

The chocolate cake to end all chocolate cakes! The most moist cake I've ever made. It took the whole 40 minutes using 2 9 inch round pans. I cooled them in the fridge over night before icing. The top of the cake is really sticky, so if you're decorating you might need an extra thick crumb coat. I filled with a wonderful chocolate icing/fill recipe on here and used buttercream to decorate. Everyone loved it.

This far and away exceeded my expectations and I am a advanced cook who has made a zillion chocolate cakes over the years.  I only had a half a cup of buttermilk so I added a half a cup of whole milk but other than that I made it exactly by the directions.  I cooked my cake for 31 minutes and it is perfection.   Thank you soooooo much! Ive been searching for the perfect recipe for literally years.

I used honey instead of sugar and mixed it first with a teaspoon of honey to neutralize the acidity. I would definitely make this recipe again. This is an extremely rich chocolatey cake.

5 STARS FOR SURE.  I always follow recipe, except we have to cut back on sugar, so, I used Truvia Sugar Baking Blend instead of regular sugar and since coffee always enhances the chocolate flavor, I did add a few drops of Hazelnut pure extract, this was soooooo delicious, It will be my go to chocolate cake.  I didn't put any frosting on it, but when time for dessert I topped it with Oinko's  Zero yogurt, yum.

I just tried to frost this and am not impressed. It took me four tries to even get it to turn out of the pan and big pieces of it stayed in the pan, even though the pan had been thoroughly greased and floured. It has a weird texture. We haven't eaten it yet but I can tell just by looking at it. I made a double batch of peanut butter frosting, which should have been more than enough to frost and decorate a normal cake but because this one was so bad, I had to use all of the frosting just trying to keep this cake together. It's supposed to be for my son's 17th bday party today. I'm never making this again. I've baked a thousand cakes and have never had one do this before.

In the words of the guests, it was lovely. Personally it was a bit on the sweet side and the batter was a little bit thin, but the end product turned out pretty nice!

Perfectly moist and awesome taste! I increased the cocoa powder amount a bit as suggested in other comments. I made muffins with the leftover batter and they did not come out well. They broke while removing them from the mold. Also, I took tips from a similar recipe and mixed all the wet ingredients in a separate vessel before adding them to the dry ones.

I honestly was very excited for this cake. However, it was a bit chewy. Being from a family of  non-coffee drinkers, I made it for a party, and used hot chocolate. Perhaps next time I will just make it for me WITH coffee.

This cake came out wonderful! It wasn't super sweet and was chocolate enough for everyone. I followed the directions exactly and baked for 35 minutes. This was my first stacked cake so I was happy that it stacked nicely and was still super soft and moist.

Absolutely the best recipe for a chocolate cake. Moist, rich, dark, everyone loves it. For three 6", 33 minutes in my oven and it's perfect. Last one I made (last night) came out of the pans easily and in perfect shape, but I had used Wilton's Bake Easy!, liquid version. I put a lot in the pan because previous attempts would usually result in part of the cake breaking off. I've used butter and flour in other attempts and had same issues. Last night was really the first time they came out of the pans perfectly, after I let cooldown about half an hour on the counter.

I made this for a family dinner and got rave reviews.  The only things I tweaked was to add an extra egg and 1/2 a cup of strong coffee with 1/2 a cup of amaretto.
I layered the middle with melted chocolate with a little coconut oil and topped it off with a silky vanilla/almond butter cream.

This has been my go to cake recipe for years.  I have never had any complaints in fact, I have had nothing but people who obsess about this cake whenever I have brought it to potlucks.  I have found that either cream cheese or mocha frosting is the best with this cake.

I don't often write reviews, but this is the best chocolate cake recipe I've found. I only made one change, because I cook for a gluten free bunch I just substitute my gluten free flour blend for the flour in this recipe. This cake was so moist, chocolaty, and rich it was like eating a little slice of heaven. The batter is very versatile and I've used it for everything from cupcakes to cake pops. A sure win, you won't regret trying this out!

this is probably the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  Up to this point, my favorite devil's food type chocolate cake has been the depression era cake that takes vinegar and uses no eggs.  This recipe has surpassed that.  used special dark chocolate cocoa powder, and since I never keep buttermilk on hand in the fridge, I used the powdered buttermilk(4tbsp powdered buttermilk to 1 cup water-perfect!).  I used espresso powder to make my coffee portion of this.  This cake is so dark, so moist, and so delicious.  a synch to prepare.  Made 2 dozen cupcakes baked for approx. 25 minutes in my oven.  thanks so much!  a definite go-to for when in need of a chocolate cake.

Such a simple, easy to make and forgiving recipe. Pretty much signed up only to be able to review this recipe. The only change i made was substituting brown sugar for white- worked just fine. Moist, rich and immensely satisfying for anyone who wants a quick chocolate fix without too much fuss. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake now!

Next to the Silver Palate carrot cake recipe, this is the most requested cake in my house.  Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made.  I like it with just some confectioners sugar sprinkled on top, the rest of my family likes it with buttercream frosting.  Either way, you can not go wrong.  I would not change a thing!  I do use 2 tsp of espresso powder for the strong coffee, but only because we are not coffee drinkers and I don't have coffee on hand.

I use this for ALL my chocolate cakes, super moist and easy to make.  Use your favorite frosting's or glache'.  

You do not taste coffee or buttermilk in my opinion.  The coffee adds a richness and the buttermilk adds moister.  

Hats off to whomever developed this recipe

I have been making this recipe for almost 50 years, a real keeper! Found it on a Hershey's Cocoa can and have always used Hershey's cocoa...

This was the best chocolate cake ever.  Followed the recipe exactly and baked in two nine inch layer pans.  It did however require an additional 5 to 10 minutes in the oven.  I used a traditional German cake frosting to fill and ice the cake.  So moist and yummy.

I'm not much of a cake person - I generally prefer other kinds of desserts.  That being said, this cake is decadent!  And, it's even better the 2nd and 3rd day - if it lasts that long.  I've never made a moister chocolate cake & I'm known as the "dessert lady" at my church ... I've made this one again and again.  I did however change the type of frosting I use.  A dear friend gave me a special frosting recipe that is cooked - I add almond extract to it & that compliments this cake very well.  This one is definitely worth a try!

This cake was so easy to make and it was  do yummy and delicious! The only change I made was to use 1/8 cup less of white sugar.  And, this was the first cake from scratch I have made for a good 20 years, and I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  But, no problems at all. I will  make this cake again and again and again.

I will never use boxed cake mix again. This was so simple and the taste was fantastic. I made cupcakes and they cooked for 26 minutes. I also used the Chocolate Coffee Buttercream Frosted recipe that I found on here and it was just perfect. 
Everybody raved about how great they were. 
A must try!!!!!

I followed the recipe except I "bloomed" the cocoa first.  I mixed the Unsweetened cocoa with the hot coffee in a metal bowl so it would cool quickly.  I then added this along with the other wet ingredients.  I didn't use frosting, but made a cherry filling and then used whipped cream on the servings.  The cake itself has quite a bit of sugar, so the added frosting seemed like overkill for me.  BTW, I strongly suggest lining the 9" pans with parchment for easy release.

Awesome recipe... My 10 year old made it with minimal supervision and we substituted 1 cup sugar for 3/4 c Splenda since she is type 1 diabetic. About 27g carbs for 1/12 slice + 15g for 1/8c icing. So 42g per 1/12 cake slice is not bad!

Absolutely amazing cake!! Instead of buttermilk I used a cup of almond milk with a teaspoon of lemon juice, and instead of vanilla I used maple syrup, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and it turned out perfectly! Super moist and has that deep chocolate taste without tasting artificial. To add a little freshness I made a strawberry glaze to go in between two layers in on top. I used powdered sugar, coconut oil, and fresh strawberries, and blended it all in my Neutra bullet!

Wow!! Sooo good! All the rave reviews are true. My only issue was having trouble getting the moist cake out of my pan, so I cut a piece of parchment and greased and floured that before pouring in the batter. But wow! What a cake! I'm making it for my friends birthday which is on Halloween, so this should be perfect.

This cake is fabulous!  It was rich and moist and everything I want in a chocolate cake. When I made it, I was short on some pantry ingredients, but had a major chocolate cake craving. I used homemade buttermilk made with milk and lemon juice. And I made baking power with baking soda and cream of tartar. And since I didn't have any butter or cream on hand, I ended up poking it, then glazing it like a doughnut, rather than frosting it. So good!!! This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Nice work with this recipe!

Made this exactly as written for a family reunion.  I frosted the cake with a peanut butter buttercream frosting.  I used Double Dutch Dark Cocoa and the cake was fantastic.  I will definitely make this cake again.

This is very similar to a vegan chocolate cake I make: I love the mix-in-pan and bake cakes! I made a 7 minute frosting to go with, and made 24 cupcakes with this recipe. They were definitely better the next day! I prefer my vegan chocolate cake because I never have buttermilk, but this was very good.

Easy to make and only had to buy the buttermilk as I had all the other ingredients.  We bake tons of cakes and cookies and bars for our annual Christmas Fair in Quincy Mass the first weekend in December so amlways on the lookout for great new recipes.  This more than filled that need.

Make sure to use the best chocolate for the frosting. I made that mistake.  Never again!!  The cake was beyond awesome, so moist and rich chocolate. I used soured milk because I can't use  buttermilk or any dairy.  Still a perfect cake!

A slice of childhood! My mom made this as I was growing up, now I'm making it for my kids. Makes great cupcakes, just cut the baking time down to 15-20 minutes. And for some extra moistness, try adding 4 tablespoons of instant chocolate pudding as you are mixing. Melt in your mouth! I've handed this recipe out more times than I can count.

OMG! Moist and even though the coffee is used to enhance the chocolate flavor it was not over powering. This recipe is a keeper. I got lazy and used canned frosting instead of making my own next time I will make it. Check this out once I had the cake mix in pans I realized I forgot to put the coffee in the mix. I added  a 1/2 cup  of coffee to each cake pan of mix and prayed for the best and God was good.

This recipe came from a small paperback book that was free with the purchase of Hershey Cooking Cocoa back in the 70's. It's always been a family favorite but I never frost this cake. A friend gave me a chocolate sauce recipe and I make a double batch, poke holes in the cake and pour the sauce on top. It's so delicious this way.

I just made this cake today the only substitutions I made is I used Stevia in the raw because I am diabetic and Hershey's special dark because that is all I had on hand. As another reviewer suggested I made cupcakes and it only took 20 minutes in my oven at 350° toothpick came out clean they are cooling on the counter waiting for me to frost I am going to use the sturdy buttercream frosting Jo-Lynn posted and I will let you know how it turns out; my batch yielded 20 standard size cupcakes. I filled them two thirds of the way full and they peaked nicely in the center; I don't care for my cupcakes to be uniformly flat. My stand mixer made very short work of this but did not mix at thoroughly as I'd like; thankfully, it will be covered by the frosting. Thank you for sharing, the cupcakes came out so dark like midnight and they are very moist.

Made exactly as written and its a good cake but personally I would still like it to be a bit more chocolatey (if thats a word). But icing it with a dark chocolate icing made it  popular with the family and it dissapeared quickly.

I have been making this cake for my children since they were babies. I have never had a better recipe!! What I really wish for, is to be able to get a yellow cake recipe as good as this chocolate recipe. If anyone has one please post.

I am really tired of seeing vegetable oil in recipes. It's not  healthy,  people.  I use butter or  coconut oil instead.  I can't remember the last time I bought vegetable oil.  No offense, but I'm looking for recipes that are more hip.

This is, hands down, our favorite chocolate cake. I always cook it in a 9"x 13" pan and frost it with a cooked brown sugar frosting.  Dynomyte!!

I have also used this recipe from the back of Hershey's baking cocoa and it has always been a winner.  However, since moving to higher altitude (3900+feet), I have had problems with it not coming out of the pan in one piece.  Nonetheless, this is just about the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted and even better with chocolate buttercream frosting, especially since I am a chocoholic!!!

I could not be more pleased with this recipe. I'm glad the author warned of it's batter being thin, it's the consistency of soup! This hits all those notes you want when you crave dark chocolate. I made a cream cheese/dark chocolate/ espresso frosting on the fly, no recipe, and it got rave reviews. It sure didn't look pretty, but there was no mistaking the flavor. Rich and lovely, and very fine crumbs. I can't wait to wow people with this one again.

This was the first cake I have ever made. Yes, the first I have ever   made in my entire life. All that to say, the recipe was very simple. I used dark chocolate frosting from the store. One canister was a perfect amount. If I could go back and change one thing I might've unselected the "Strong" brew option on my Keurig for the 1 cup coffee.

I have been baking for 50 years and hands down this is the very best chocolate cake I have ever made and the only one I'll ever make going forward. I made the recipe as directed choosing to use the coffee, not the water and I'm sure that choice enhanced the chocolate flavor.  Worthy of ten stars!!!

Wanted to try something different and this sounded so good! Cake turned out very heavy and did not taste very good - it was very bland.  I was very disappointed.  My Grandmother's cake is much better and always get compliments anywhere I bring it.

This may be my new, go-to chocolate cake recipe! The only mistake I made was using 8-inch pans instead of 9-inch, so the batter spilled all over the oven, but it still tasted wonderful! I used espresso for most of the coffee, but finished it off with Kahlua!

Very rich, chocolatey cake!  Amazingly dark in color.   I made a 9x13 cake in a glass dish and covered it with a thin layer of Caramel Frosting I frosting.  It was a perfect flavor combination.  Next time I will double the frosting amount as I think the cake can handle the extra frosting.  
I did substitute applesauce for the oil - because that makes it healthy, right? :)  I have never made such a runny cake batter before, but I will be again because this cake was such a hit with everyone, I know I will be making it again!

Delicious,  moist,  and deep chocolately.  I made recipe exactly as is,  but made into cupcakes and  they turned out perfectly. I iced with fluffy peanut butter icing from this site and it was a delicious combo.  I made for a dinner party and got rave reviews. This recipe is a keeper.

Came out awesome, except I thought I'd take it up a notch and add chocolate chips. BIG MISTAKE. The sunk to the bottom and when I took the cake out of the pan, the chocolate chips were all stuck to the bottom ?? So I scraped them out and tried to spread them out. I made peanut butter frosting for it. So it doesn't look the prettiest but it tastes fantastic!

- fast, easy and everyone's favourite!
- no changes made
- pans were greased, floured and parchment paper bottoms
- cook time for me is 40 minutes
- Note: the higher the temperature the more the middle will rise. Lower temp=flatter cakes=longer cook times.

I had to make this twice.  The first time was a disaster as I used two 9 inch circle pans.  The batter is very thin, as others have said and is deceiving as to how much it will expand!  It overflowed into my oven and made a huge mess.  Fortunately I had a cookie sheet underneath...but still was a mess.  I made it again for a second time in addition to 6 cupcakes!  Still overflowed a bit.  Recommend the cookie sheath under the baking pans.  Was delicious and could not taste the coffee...good for me because I don't like coffee!

I made this cake exactly as directed, and I think it's one of the best cakes I've ever made. The chocolate flavor is perfect (not too sweet, not too bitter, and very present). It was also incredibly moist! Unlike a lot of people these days, I prefer a cake that is a bit moist and dense over cakes that are considered "fluffy" or "airy" -- all of which I would describe as just plain "dry". This cake isn't fluffy, airy or dry. It's not dense like a brownie, but it has some substance to it. I will make this one again and again. It is now my go-to chocolate cake.

This is my go-to birthday cake recipe. With a stabilized strawberry cream cheese frosting (not too sweet!), I always get at least one person staring at me in shock and wonder. Often they've had it before, but forgot how friggin' good this moist cake is.

I used a touch more vanilla and made my own buttermilk from lemon juice and milk. Sprayed nonstick pans liberally and had no issues getting them out after fully cooled. Frosted with One Bowl Buttercream Frosting

Moist and delish. My 7-year old was able to make it herself  with a minor assist with the mixer. She loved trying to get people to guess the "secret" ingredient (i.e. the coffee).

This is the best chocolate cake I've made yet.  The search stops here.  I pair it with its "That's the best frosting I've ever had" and it's perfection.

Would give this 10 stars if I could! Prepared it exactly as directed and frosted it with a tub of Chocolate Hazelnut frosting. Baked for the full 40 minutes and the cake had such a sheen that it almost threw me! After reading the reviews, I was prepared for it to be super delicate, but I still could not seem to prevent it from being difficult to work with! I also froze the cakes for 10-15 minutes, but I was in a rush...next time I will try a more substantial amount of time in the freezer. It did slope tremendously in the middle, but it's still the best chocolate cake I've ever tried in my entire life and it may be old baking powder or something. Next time I will try canned cherries and whipped cream. Then I will try raspberry jam between the layers and buttercream frosting. Then I will try this as strawberry shortcake. Lol the possibilities are endless! I will probably be making this every few weeks...insanely good, super moist and dense with the perfect amount of chocolate!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and it was the best chocolate cake I have ever made or tasted. I was a little worried about how thin the mixture was but the cakes turned out amazing once cooked. The cake is very versatile, I stored it in the fridge overnight and thought it might have dried out when I cut it open, but it was very moist. Perfect recipe, I will use it for every chocolate cake I make in the future

I made this cake yesterday.  I said it was "for my husband" but the truth is that I just wanted to bake a cake and I've never made a from scratch chocolate cake before.  I am not sorry that I did.  This cake is delicious.  Plenty of flavor and I could smell it every time I walked by the counter that I had it sitting on.  I had to wait all day just to try it!  It was so moist.  It baked up just perfectly.  I buttered my pans and then lined the bottoms with parchment & rebuttered the bottom.  Cakes came right out of the pan and they baked up very evenly as well.  I made a chocolate buttercream frosting to go on it.  I would absolutely make this cake again.

I have never been a fan of chocolate cake- they are dry, or heavy and dense. Now, THIS cake is not only quick to throw together, but provides a light, moist, beautiful and just chocolatey enough dessert. I followed to the letter, but did bake it in a 9x13. My family was thrilled and when I asked my husband if he wanted to bring some in for his crew, he replied, "No way am I sharing this!" lol Will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I made this recipe as written except that I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and I made 1 round cake and 12 cupcakes.  The cake came out super moist and light. Taste great without frosting, but I might try the cupcakes with Kahlua frosting.

This is not only a delicious cake but an easy recipe.  It's so good as it is that I feel it doesn't need any frosting.  I make it in a bundt pan and sift confectioner's sugar on it only if I want to dress it up a little bit.

Super delicious!  This was moist (ate it 24 hours after making it, and was still moist the day after that!), chocolatey (I substituted the coffee for hot chocolate since it was for my son's first birthday), and fluffy.  Baking directions were accurate.  It's simple, yummy, definitely a keeper!

This is quite possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted - it is certainly the best I've ever made. Moist and chocolatey but not too sweet.  Everyone that has tasted it has absolutely raved about how good it is - even my husband who is not a big "sweets" guy. It's good without frosting but what fun is that? I use the One Bowl Buttercream Frosting recipe for yummy chocolate cake perfection!

My family adored this cake. Added 2 tbsp of all-purpose flour to the mix because we live at above 5,000 ft. and let it cook for an additional five minutes, which may not have been necessary. Unsure if the altitude was a problem, or if the coffee should have been cooler before we added it to the mix, but it was deflated in the entire center. Next time we're going to use room temperature coffee and see how it behaves. Sometimes baking in Denver makes things interesting, but the flavor of this cake was magnificent! Wonderfully moist and the perfect mix of sweet with a touch of bitter thanks to the coffee - we used Segafredo espresso. 
Hoping we can make it come out a little prettier next time, but this is one of the best tasting cakes I've ever made.

I have made this many times and every time it's loved. My cake always sink in the middle no matter how I beat or mix, but I used a sheetpan to make it for my daughter's birthday and it didn't sink! It was perfectly moist and not sunk. I don't use butter milk, just plain whole milk works fine too.

Wow, this was awesome! Will be my go-to recipe for dark chocolate cake.  This cake is not overly sweet and the coffee really gives it a little extra umph. My oven tends to run mid-range in cooking times. I used two 9" rounds and baked for 31 minutes and it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

Moist, easy-to-make cake. No problems at all.

I was happy another reviewer said it's possible to substitute hot chocolate for the coffee, since my husband can't stand coffee.

I don't recommend making cupcakes with this recipe. Cake is so moist the paper just stuck. Cake was good. Very deceiving with how thin the batter was. Was tempted to add more flour but didn't. I try to make recipe exactly as stated the first time. Cake came out moist.

I liked the cake. I will definitely hold on to the recipe. I think the cake is little bit on the side of a "pudding cake."

This cake was the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  It is also the first I have ever made from scratch.  After reading reviews I was very careful to make it exactly as directed, even checking my oven temperature with the oven thermometer.  I would not change anything to get a moist, dense chocolate layer cake.  And please, if you don't make it according to the directions you really cannot rate or review it properly.

I lowered the sugar amount to 300 g. the batter was amazing. just what i wanted, and exactly what i imagined it would taste like.  it took longer to bake for me, i don't know why. after 35 minutes the middle was raw, so i turned it to 190 Celsius for another 30 minutes. it was worth the wait. :D

I was very jittery when I poured the cake batter in the pan and put it in the oven. I have never seen such a watery batter before. But I just didn't have the mind space to think of how to alter it. So I thought this is going to be another floppy mess. But 40 mins later what a delight. Perfectly baked, moist and intensely chocolatey. Excellent recipe.

My Family Loved It! I added more cocoa (3/4 cup to be exact), giving it a much stronger flavor. Also I used dark cocoa to give a unique, but even more delicious flavor. I plan on making it again!

Failed.  The cake fell and I under-cooked it, but it was delicious!! Great dark flavor and with chocolate chip filling (on the side, of course) and chocolate buttercream  frosting (also on the side) we were soon swirling around home with the most wonderful chocolate high ever created in my kitchen. Once I've recovered from my sugar-coma, I'm trying this one again!  Well worth the effort!

I will give this 5 stars because I don't like chocolate cake, but this was not terrible. Also, everyone else said it was delicious. Definitely moist and good chocolate flavor. Interestingly, Ina Garten posts the exact same recipe on food network.com. I frosted this with hot fudge buttercream (but used Nutella in place of hot fudge topping) from this site.

Best chocolate cake recipe I've had. Not too dense or heavy like a lot of homemade cakes and very moist. The coffee worried me a little, I thought it'd be more prominent but it was perfect!

This recipe is absolutely divine! I've been searching for a good recipe  for a long time but this recipe beats all. It is so moist and chocolatey! I made it with the chocolate cream cheese frosting. The only thing I would change is to do 1.5 cup sugar instead of 2. Two is quite sweet with the frosting. Other than that perfect!

Wonderful chocolate cake!  It is very rich.  I am not a fan coffee/mocha so I substituted 1 cup of strongly brewed cocoa  (about 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa to 1 cup of water.)  I used chocolate buttercream frosting and drizzled with caramel sauce.  All I can say is yummmmmmm

Yum! This has become my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  It is outstanding.  The taste is so good and it's so nice and moist, not dense at all.  This is great for any occasion and can have anything added to it, frosting, coconut, strawberries, etc. all taste great with this cake!

This is a very nice chocolate cake, very moist.  It's better than my usual scratch chocolate, so this one will be "it" from here on.  Followed the recipe except bumped up the cocoa, used coconut oil, and followed reviewers suggestion of vinegar in the milk in place of buttermilk, which I don't usually have on hand.  No need for frosting for me and my husband - this is sweet enough.  Thanks for posting.

Moist and rich; the coffee adds a little complexity to the flavor and I think a little extra sponginess. This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe for friends' birthdays.

I've made this twice, and used 1/4 C regular cocoa powder + 1/2 C Hershey's Special Dark.  I made the change the first time because that's all I had left, and the second because everyone loved the first batch.   Personally, I detest chocolate cake... and this is delicious!  Everyone at my sister's wedding agreed that this is a winner of a recipe!

Oh My!  Yes this is THE chocolate cake!  It was so good.  So flavorful!  So moist!  The Best!  I was rushed on time, so I only made it in a 13 x 9 pan, but making this with a tall layered cake would give you the most gourmet chocolate cake you will eat!  I used a frosting recipe I found in another recipe here on Allrecipes for a Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting, which paired really well with it.  I am screaming over here to tell you to make this!!  Thank you so much for the great recipe!  It really is the ultimate chocolate cake from scratch!

This is a great cake to make. It was very moist and my family loved it. The only problem was I didn't really like the taste very much.

FYI: I substituted all-purpose gluten-free flour and an egg replacer due to allergies and this cake was still AMAZING and handled the substitution perfectly.

Nothing special...a very basic recipe...had high expectations due to all the positive reviews but was disappointed. The cake took way longer to bake and ended up overspilling & it stuck horribly to the bottom of the pan despite being generously coated with butter. Will not make again.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes instead and kept them in the oven for 12 to 14 minutes. What a hit. I had to make a batch of 24 twice in one weekend because there were no left overs and everyone wanted more. I added chocolate frosting to the middle which tipped it right off.

This is the best cake I have ever made or ever had!! Everyone compliments it every time I make it. It is amazingly moist and perfectly chocolately. I have done it with vanilla frosting and mocha frosting (my family's favorite) and both were excellent.

20 minutes at 350, if you're making this into cupcakes. (I used a 1/3 C measuring cup to spoon them into the papers, and that seemed juuuust right.)

So delicious and easy.  Comes out perfect every time.  I've been using this recipe to make a trifle dessert by slicing 2 rounds for the trifle dish, and layering them with whip cream frosting, caramel topping, and english toffee bits.   perfect texture for a trifle.  The coffee adds an interesting, not too sweet flavor that goes well with whip cream

Delicious and easy.  Made 24 cupcakes.
*When we made it this time we used 1/2 the  amount of sugar (so 1 cup). This made them SO amazing!!! They were beyond delish and moist, cooked to perfection. Baked in silicone muffin cups. Iced with raspberry whip cream (no sugar) for Z's 6th bday. The whole family loved!

This is my go-to chocolate cake. I make it for work parties, friends birthdays, almost anything that I need to bring a dessert to. It's always a hit, people tell me they've never had anything better, and they always ask it for the next party. I'll make it a day (or even two) before I need it, it always tastes so much better after 24+ hours. It's not an insane kick of chocolate in your mouth, but it's very moist and just pure heaven in your mouth. It does take a while to bake, it could use a couple more min in the oven after the time goes off.

I made this cake yesterday - the only change was to add 1 cup of cocoa powder instead of 3/4.  This cake is absolutely moist and delicious.  The batter really is thin - but that's correct.  It bakes up amazingly well.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy. Fast. Coffee isn't necessary. Can use water or milk. Buttermilk makes or breaks this recipe. I've tried substituting with various combinations and the original (sans coffee) is the best. I've made it half a dozen times and have received positive feedback each time.

Made this about four times now. Really good cake. Better than the chocolate cavity maker recipe on this site I think. I usually make recipes as stated the first time before making changes but I didn't know what strong brewed coffee was so I used a cup of coffee liqueur (Tia Maria). Amazing!  

I've made it the same way all the time now and we have this cake with cream all the time. With each spoon, everyone goes "mmmm"....we all love this cake - Thanks for sharing!

I love this cake recipe!!! I would definitely make it again! I made this cake for my wife's birthday because I she loves chocolate cake. 2 things I did that I would recommend: 1) Instead of coffee I used Pero. I used 1 cup, but I also added some Pero powder to the mix because my wife loves the flavor. 2) for icing I used a german chocolate icing with evaporated milk, butter, coconut, sugar, and pecans. I would do it exactly the same way again! Great recipe. I think the added sugar from the coconut icing added a great sweetness to the cake. I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and baked it the full 40 minutes. I let it cool for 4 or 5 hours before slicing it, stacking it, and icing it.

This is so  moist and a little like sponge cake in consistency.  It is so chocolatey that it almost seems like there are melted chocolate chips in each bite - so good!  I used Swans Down cake flour which calls for 1 cup + 2 tablespoons for 1 cup of all purpose flour.  I also sifted the flour before measuring.  I really like using buttermilk instead of butter or shortening. I made the Quick Chocolate Butter Icing recipe from the Joy of Cooking and it was a nice compliment to this cake.

I've also bake a number of goodies in my life and when i made this cake i thought ok, that's THE chocolate cake recipe i leave behind, tried and true old recipe apparently. It's rich dark flavour is true chocolate lover paradise. It raise well so you can make a 4 layers,  or as is, still serves generous portions. I used Wilton's chocolate buttercream icing for the likes of my family who likes the moist cake trapped in a solid icing. Perfect recipe for the kids in your kitchen, college students or as we get older, not caring so much about all the dishes, one bowl is all you need! Thanks for sharing Marsha :)

Simple and great. I usually add less sugar though, but I guess that comes down to personal preference.

This cake is wonderful.  I have tried so many cake recipes in the past and none are as great as this.  I gave half away because I knew I couldn't stop eating it.  For icing, I used whipped cream with a small amount of sugar and vanilla and kept it in the refrigerator.  Very moist and great chocolate flavor.   Make sure you use an 8" pan that is at least 2" high or it will over flow.  It sunk in the middle while baking but I beat the batter longer than the directions said at 2 minutes.  Will make this again.

I love the texture of this cake. However, I used sea salt because that is what I had on hand. Needless to say, there were bites with "rocks" of salt that hadn't dissolved. I will be cutting the (fine) salt content in half next time I make it.

I made this with just a couple of changes.  I didn't have any coffee.  Instead I mixed up a cup of mocha flavored hot chocolate.  I also decreased the oil to 1/4 cup, because of the reviews of it being almost too moist. The cake came out perfectly!  Even dh, who usually prefers milk chocolate, rated it 4 stars.  Everyone else said it was the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I used  the Chocolate Ganache recipe by ingridevogel for the filling, and One Minute Chocolate Icing for the top.  Delicious!

There are no words to describe how good this is, don't play with the recipe-just make it as written there is nothing that can be improved! Absolutely the ultimate chocolate fix.

YUMMY!!! I made this recipe exactly as written.  I am not normally a chocolate cake person, but OMG this was FABULOUS!!!!  It was moist and almost spongey.  It didn't even need icing because it had such great flavor.  Of course I DID make icing too since it was a birthday cake for friends.  I made the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting on this site from another reviewers recommendation.

I used 3/4 cup of sugar together with sweetened cocoa, it went pretty good. at first it seems very liquid but after baking it was an amazing result.

I made this for my husband's birthday since he is a chocoholic and avid coffee drinker. I used the coffee chocolate buttercream icing as a filling between layers and Ganache I as the icing. Very decadent, moist, and rich. This was a big hit with my husband in the whole family.

It was a delicious cake! Best cake I have ever made. I substituted the buttermilk for 3/4 cups yogurt plus 1/4 cups water. It tasted delicious. The best part of this cake was the chocolate flavor with coffee. It is easier to make the coffee in a French press. It is easy to make and it is even easier to eat it!

Oh boy!  This is the one!  I live in France, where the standard chocolate cake is extremely dense.  I so miss what I remembered  of American chocolate cakes.  When my daughter asked for one for her birthday, I tried this one with chocolate cream cheese frosting (from this site, too), and it was superb!  Moist, chocolate-y - just right.  Mine rose and sank just a bit- not sure why, but it didn't matter.  I would like to try making this with baking chocolate, rather than cocoa, but I don't know it that's possible or not.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper.

Best chocolate cake I have tasted and it stays moist for days. A week later it's still in top form. It is dense but it's a treat for chocolate lovers.

I'll be making this moist, dark, chocolatey cake again! If I don't have buttermilk around, I might see how it'd work with 1 cup milk plus 1 tsp of vinegar or lemon juice would work as a substitute like the video says.

I did have to make some changes because I didn't have real coffee or buttermilk. So I made instant coffee instead. I knew the instant I have is really strong so to counter its over powering nature I added one more teaspoon of vanilla extract to it. To replace the buttermilk, all I had was canned unsweetened coconut milk; I added the same amount for the buttermilk mentioned in the recipe. I would say those changes enhanced the aroma and flavor of the cake making the chocolate the star without making it too crazy. As for the frosting a simple glaze worked and for those who do not like frosting or glazes powder sugar worked beautifully.  I have saved this for future use if needed.

This is the only chocolate cake I have made since I found this recipe a few years ago. Delicious! If I am out of buttermilk I will add some vinegar to regular milk and substitute accordingly. It always turns out fabulously. My all time favorite go to cake. So simple and no mixer required! You HAVE to try it.

This cake is absolutely amazing.  I've made it twice now.  Once, I made it as a layer cake with a chocolate, cherry ganache topping.  The second time, I made it as cupcakes with a cherry creme filling topped with a dark chocolate buttercream. I actually made this cake as the recipe is written.  It is such a good, moist chocolate cake, it will carry a variety of decadent flavors in frosting and filling choices.

Moist, however it had a bit of a bitter taste I assume it is the amount of bicarbonate of soda in the recipe or the coffee. But will variate next time to see if there is some change

Over all, I think the recipe works. It kind of tasted like I'd put too much baking soda in, but I followed the directions exactly. I liked the consistency, though. And the ratio of chocolate worked for me as well.

Marvellous chocolate cake. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. This is the first chocolate cake I have made that properly tastes like chocolate, I do believe coffee is needed to bring out the flavour. I made this today as the adult cake for my son's first birthday, and frosted the cake with fresh whipped double cream and raspberries.  Beautiful and will be my go to chocolate recipe!

Only draw back is I always line my metal cake tins with baking parchment, but because the batter is so thin, it leaked and baked into the paper, so I had to trim a good bit off. I will invest in good quality silicone cake tins for this cake.

I do not cook much. I don't bake much. This cake is amazing. And easy. 
I first had it when my husband's aunt made it for us for a birthday. It was amazing and I was hooked. I've made it twice since then and she made it one additional time. This is our go-to recipe for cakes now. 
My singular problem with the cake - and it is my problem, not the cake's- when icing it we can't use white/vanilla icing because the chocolate crumbs show through and make it less pretty than it deserves. Doesn't change the taste at all - just the appearance and that irks me a bit. 
Just means more chocolate though. Chocolate frosting solves the whole 'problem'.

We have some single guy friends that always request chocolate cake for their birthdays. I think this one will be the keeper. The batter is very thin, but it cooks up really moist. I used a bundt pan and added some mini chocolate chips (which all sank to the bottom of the pan) and the cake actually cooked over the side of the pan a bit. It still came out perfect at about 45 minutes. Great recipe - really easy, too!

My sister-in-law and I found this recipe on Allrecipes years ago and have been using it as a go-to ever since.  What I love about it is that the ingredients are pretty much always on hand in my pantry and the batter is super nice to work with, although it is thin.  The cake is a little delicate - I liberally grease and also use parchment paper on the bottom of my cake pans which greatly helps with removing the cakes from the pans - and it does crumb up easily when you are frosting it.    Overall this is a faithful recipe which wins every time and makes a perfectly delicious cake.

This is "Hershey's Perfectly chocolate cake", my go-to chocolate cake recipe EXCEPT the boiling water in the Hershey's recipe is replaced with coffee. YUM! Have made this twice now, sometimes I can taste the coffee, sometimes not. Makes a tall, moist, 8 " cake. Thanks for the recipe.

Very moist cake, but family and I agree that it's not rich enough. I frosted with chocolate frosting (that also turned out to be not rich enough) and this didn't satisfy our need for chocolate, chocolate cake.

This cake is delicious. Great recipe. I used Chef John's cream cheese frosting (recipe can also be found here). Incredible combination. Everyone loved it, it was a hit. My family keeps asking me to make it for every birthday!

This recipe is awesome! I made it for someones birthday in May, by this month August, I will have made this recipe 5 times,per birthday requests. Once with toasted coconut frosting, one "Reese's" candy w/ peanut butter filling/frosting. One used peppermint extract in batter/frosting/decorated w/"Jr.Mints", one w/almond/coconut and one w/ classic buttercream. each time I swapped out the oil for coconut oil, super! Thank you!

Very dark, very moist, very chocolatey and very very delicious. Didn't change a thing. Made two round pans, greased with butter and cocoa, and then lined with parchment paper.  Cakes came out of pans like a dream.  Frosted with German frosting, and got rave reviews.  This is my new chocolate cake recipe.  Absolutely wonderful!!

FABULOUS. CHOCOLATEY. MOIST. HEARTBREAKINGLY DELCIOUS. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe to coat the tops of the four "mini cakes" that I made. Shame that my nosy dog licked the glaze off three of them!

Rich flavor, but came out very dense, especially on the bottom of the pan. Perhaps I didn't cook it enough, even though the toothpick came out clean. I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa. I will try cake flour next time to try for a lighter, fluffier texture.

After looking through many recipes for my son's 14th birthday cake, I decided on this one and now it will be the "go to" cake recipe from now on.  I didn't need to change a thing; just took the advice of someone on here about freezing the layers for a short time to make it easier to ice.  Iced it with my own version of chocolate butter cream, adding 4 oz of cream cheese and a tbls of Amaretto an decorated with sliced strawberries.  Everyone said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever had!

My go to chocolate cake! So rich and moist.  Just delicious. I've made it twice, and am both times so impressed. I love the addition of coffee. I frost with Beatty's chocolate buttercream, and then add some chocolate shavings...just to feel gourmet. But it really turns out beautiful. I think about this cake often.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very crumbly. I left the cake in the pan for several hours to cool and it broke apart when I removed it. I greased with butter and flower. I think I will try again and grease with vegetable oil. I'll also try putting the cake in the refridgerator or freezer before removing from the pan, or maybe parchment paper. The flavor was delicious so it would be worth ironing out the kinks.

Had too much cocoa and wayyyyy too much coffee. My mother compliments my cooking, but she really disliked this cake. 
The only thing I got compliments on was the filling (strawberry filling from this site, but I used a mix of frozen berries) and the cream cheese frosting (from this site also). Disappointed, will not be making this again.

wow this recipe is really good. very moist and soft cake. the batter is very runny so I was scared I did not get the ingredients right. it came out perfect. it took 45 min to fully bake. but the cake was very soft that you need to be very careful to take it out of the pan. it falls apart easily. my first time baking a chocolate cake and I am really glad I chose this recipe. thank you

It was amazing. It was very moist and delicious. I read that someone said it was not chocolatey and that made him disappointed. But I added an icing that was perfect for the cake. I don't know the name but I will tell you what it is in my next post

So moist and delicious. I love the sticky texture of the cake. I was able to whip up this cake in less than 45 minutes. It took me about 30 minutes to bake two round pans. I have made this cake twice now and each time it has been seriously stuck to the pan. I just used a heavy coating of cooking spray but that won't cut it.  I must say, I would also prefer a chocolatier cake..does any one have suggestions? Would more cocoa powder do the trick? Or would too much cocoa powder dry out the cake? Thanks!

I have made this in a bundt pan and 8"two layer many times. You can't beat it. I started leaving out the vanilla because I forgot it one time and my wife loved it and swore it was a different recipe. Sometimes I frost it and sometimes I don't. It's easy and delicious, thanks Marsha for sharing it with me.

This recipe looks exactly like Ina Garten's (the Barefoot Contessa) "Beatty's Chocolate Cake" recipe, which I've made.  It's extremely moist and chocolatey--I can only surmise something went wrong for those reviewers who said this didn't have enough chocolate flavor.  Baking this at high altitude (Mexico City, 7,350 ft.) I adjusted the recipe a bit as per this website's high altitude baking instructions.  Came out perfectly.  Paired it with a milk chocolate version of the Barefoot Contessa's chocolate buttercream recipe.

I made this non-dairy with one simple substitution: one tablespoon of cider vinegar (although white vinegar also works) plus enough non-dairy milk (I used rice milk) to add up to a cup of liquid. Then you let it sit for 5 minutes, stir, and use just like the buttermilk.
I frosted it with frosting from earth balance, cocoa, and powdered sugar. It was a HUGE hit at my meal!

A good cake with a dense, heavy crumb. Moist and had a lot of great chocolate flavor. The texture can hold up to a thicker ganache frosting, but tastes great with a lighter mousse or non-dairy whip frosting.

Amazing recipe!  So moist and choclatey...and not too sweet.  There were only two of us so I halved the recipe and made it in one round cake pan and just dusted it with confectioner's sugar which was the perfect topping so you just enjoyed the chocolate-goodness.

I replaced buttermilk with a cup of milk and a tablespoon of vinegar. I used an 8 inch round pan, 200 degrees Celsius and it took longer to make which was an hour and half. Cake turned out well I am very satisfied with the flavor!

I love this recipe! This is the first time that I do a cake from scratch.  So I called my mom, the baker in or family, to give me some pointers. So we switched the oil for butter. Then we mixed the eggs, vanilla, sugar and butter together for 6 minutes before adding any dry intrusions. it turned out awesome!

I didn't have vegetable oil, so I subbed melted extra virgin coconut oil but otherwise followed the recipe. The top kind of collapsed and looked funny, but it was cooked through and it tastes absolutely delicious. I frosted it with Chocolate Coffee Buttercream Icing.

Awesome, did used Chambord as I was out of vanilla.and it is so yummy!  And silly me I checked some pointers on another site,that will remain nameless, to make a giant cupcake and put a pan of water under the side the makes the top of the giant cupcake as was suggested.  I do not recommend this, the top did not cook!   The cake is also very forgiving as I had to put the top back in and was simply able to cut off the top and put it all together.

The first time I made this recipe, I forgot to grease the pan. Oops! My family and I just tore bits off of the cake, just as is. A year ago was my mom's birthday and we were also celebrating my mom's parent's 49th anniversary. I didn't forget to grease the pan that time! I also left out the coffee, as there were kids that were younger than 7, it was still really good. I'm making it again tonight for my parent's friend's birthday. I accidentally added 1/2 cup too much buttermilk, but, veryveryveryveryveryveryVERY surprisingly, it turned out perfect!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and it had everyone raving and asking for seconds! It was fairly dark-chocolatey and not too sweet at all. I frosted it with an oreo buttercream icing which added that punch of sugar for those with a sweet tooth! Perfect recipe as is.

This recipe was great, one bowl, all ingredients go in and super easy! Tastes divine. Always moist, rich and makes a lovely thick cake, cheaper, easier and much better tasting than a box cake! This is fool proof

This cake was rich and delicious! Delectable for chocolate lovers like my family. I hate to say anything bad about it, except the batter totally over flowed my 2 9-inch round pans! I should have known better, since the recipe made a lot of batter, but only a few minutes through, I ended up putting a cookie sheet underneath the pans. The cake was a mess! But a tasty mess! The only thing I was advise is leave enough room for the cake to grow. I think I'm going to make it tomorrow when I have some of my old buds come over, I'll just use a big pan :)

Please help!   I have baked this cake twice and both times it has sunk in the middle, like a crater on the moon.   I follow the recipe "to the letter" and after my first tragic failed attempt which I blamed on opening the oven door, I didn't  even go in the same room while it is cooking.  I love the taste of this cake and it is so easy to bake, what is happening?   Thank you.

I tried this recipe for the first time today, and loved it! The batter was extremely thin and I was worried it would take longer to bake, but I followed the instructions to a T and the bake time was right on point. No need to tweak the ingredients,thanks for sharing??

I loved this cake! It turned out really moist and delicious! I added sour cream to help it be moist, and i plan to use ganache as my filling. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this last night with my niece. It was her first time baking a cake and it came out wonderful. So moist and light. We had a great time! easy and fun to make. Her dad and my hubby pretty much inhaled it! It was a huge success. 

I didn't not have buttermilk and just used what I had which was low fat milk. It seemed to work great. Next I will try the buttermilk to compare the difference.

I have made this cake several times now and it is just amazing! However, I did try something new which was a huge mistake. I substituted a little bit of buckwheat flour for two reasons, 1. because I needed to use it up and 2. because I try and be healthy once and awhile. Anyways, this was just terrible, really it was. If I have to give advise on anything, is to avoid the buckwheat flour in this. Not only am I the only one that is forced to eat and entire bundt size cake alone, I now have a husband who will not let it go. Thankfully I didn't attempt to serve my 'masterpiece' to guests. I'm not sure what is worse, forcing my toddler to eat it or the fact that my pregnant tastebuds actually like it. Super great recipe though, just stay away from the buckwheat!

OMG! The best chocolate cake ever!! Moist heavenly deliciousness to put it simply. The 9" cake was devoured by my family of 7 within minutes.  I made my own buttermilk by adding vinegar to whole milk. The batter was thin but the cake was perfectly baked in 30 mins. Keep an eye because any more than just baked would compromise the moistness (OMG!!) of the cake.I kept it for a day in the fridge, covered and I thought the chocolate flavor became deeper the next day (tasted crumbs!!). Topped it with a lovely condensed milk ganache from another website. Got rave reviews from the family. My go to chocolate cake from now on...and so easy to make!!

Amazing!!! I questioned the coffee. I added three tablespoons of instant coffee to a measuring cup, then filled it with water to the correct amount. It came out wonderful. I thought the coffee might have been too much, but it was perfect. My son loved it.

I accidentally left out the vanilla and this cake still turned out magnificently! It was moist and rich but not too sweet. I made a layer cake with whipped ganache frosting and a raspberry filling and my coworkers were raving about it. This is definitely a keeper. It was a little difficult to frost because it was so sticky and a little crumbly, but well worth the effort.

This is an excellent, super-moist, coffee-ish chocolate cake.  I made a simple topping for it by combining honey, Redi-whip, and cinnamon and spooning it over individual portions.  Don't overdo the honey or cinnamon; you want to complement the cake's flavor, not overwhelm or mask it.

Danger! Danger! This recipe is awesome, the best chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch!  I did not have buttermilk, so I looked on a site for the substitute and it said to use 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup water to equal 1 cup of buttermilk (this is the only way I'll make it since I ALWAYS have sour cream on hand and I never have buttermilk!,) this cake is to die for, even without frosting. ,I have tried several chocolate cake recipes, but they always turned out dry. This is a perfectly moist cake recipe. I also brewed 1 cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee and it was strong enough for me since I am also going to use a coffee frosting to make cake balls :-)
UPDATE 9/13/14: I used this recipe for coconut poke cake and it was awesome!! After I baked the Black Magic Cake I poked holes in the cake with a chopstick while cake was still hot, then poured a can of cream of coconut over it. After the cake cooled I refrigerated it. Right before serving I frosted it with whip cream and topped with flaked coconut.YUM!! Thanx for this great recipe!

This is seriously the best chocolate cake I've ever baked! The flavor has such an intense and rich chocolate flavor it's unbelievable. It's also SO moist! I made the cake with powdered buttermilk because that's all I had, but besides that I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. I made around 32 cupcakes with this recipe and they were done in exactly 30 minutes. I'm definitely keeping this recipe as my go-to chocolate cake recipe because it's honestly the best!

Made this as a 2-layer cake with a strawberry jam filling and thin chocolate icing. It was absolutely wonderful! I did use parchment paper at the bottom of the pans and had no issues getting the cakes out of the pans. Super-dark and moist. I would not want a heavy icing with this cake, or it would be overwhelming.

Awesome recipe! I made it, let it proper cool out and then put it in the fridge. No additional frosting. My family but I'm too are very happy that I'v found a way to make this cake by myself. It taste much better than buying a ready mix from the Supermarket. I also uploaded a picture.

This cake was amazing! It's easy very easy to make. I only change one thhing and that was substitute one stick of butter for the veggie oil.  You do have let it bake the whole 40 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean. I also let it chill in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it easier to icing. I used a chocolate buttercream icing for the frosting and it taste amazing. This cake is moist and rich in flavor, my family loves it! I can't wait to try using cherry liquer next time.

I've been making this exact recipe for more than 50 years - I got the recipe from my MOTHER!   It's been a favorite of my family for all these years.   Best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.  It's even great with no icing and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This cake recipe was originally posted on the Hershey's website where I printed it off more than 16 years ago.  The website no longer exists but thank God the recipe still does.  I have encased mine in a protective plastic cover because it is the most used recipe in the house.  I have to make it for every birthday (6).  The secret is to only bake it for 33 minutes if you are using round pans.  Anything more than that and it will be dry.  Allow to cool completely before removing from pans.

This is the first time I baked such a lovely cake. Thank you for sharing the recipe. 

I made some changes, I reduced the sugar, only used 1 cup of sugar and still tastes good. Instead of using buttermilk, I used milk and Greek yoghurt mixture. I replaced hot chocolate instead of coffee.

I will definitely bake it again. Love it!!!

it is important to use a good cocoa in this recipe, not the chemically separated standard grocery shelf . 
I replaced the buttermilk with greek yoghurt (cut with a drop of milk) one the second batch and this was a 5.

This was awesome!  I halved the recipe and baked in a square pan.  I subbed applesauce for just a little of the oil.  Still delish after 4 days!

I have made this cake a couple times for special occasions, and it's fantastic. The coffee really takes it to another level. I also use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for a deeper chocolate flavor.

I finish it with a simple peanut butter cream cheese icing for the perfect sweet and salty combo.

I made this recipe for the first time for my husbands 5oth birthday party.  It was the best chocolate cake that I have ever had.  Everybody wanted to know where I got this recipe from.  My sons birthday is 9 days from now,  He requested this cake be made again but wants some chocolate chunks in it.  The frosting I used was the cool whip and vanilla pudding frosting. Just delicious!!!

I've made this cake several times, it's my go-to recipe.  It freezes great!!  This cake is so moist and light tasting, it really is incredible.  I make mine into a 9", 2 layer.  I also make my frosting out of skim milk, fat free chocolate pudding, icing sugar and light Cool Whip.....OMG...it's to die for.  This chocolate cake with my frosting makes for the BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!!  5+ Stars!!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for years, but I never have buttermilk on hand. I had some leftover from making Irish soda bread, so I was excited, but the end result was just...meh. I had no problem baking it or having it stick and it looked really good, but it has a very strange texture to it, not really sure how to describe it. The photos of this cake is why I wanted to try it, it just looks so dark and chocolaty, but all I could taste was coffee. I didn't even use a strong brewed coffee. I guess it depends on the brand/strength of coffee, but I used a popular brand. The pudding icing I made for it from this site was fabulous though. I recommend the one-bowl chocolate cake III and the crazy cake from this site, those are my usual go-to recipes and are both very chocolaty. Will not make this one again, sorry.

This was pretty much perfect as is.  Made as written with chocolate buttercream frosting and a layer of fudge and pecans in the middle and it was wonderful.  I didn't have any problems with it falling apart, although I could see that happening if it stuck even a little to the pans - it's a really soft, fluffy cake.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I'm not a good cook or baker and this cake was very easy to make.  The only change I made was using powder buttermilk.  It's rich and moist.  I frosted the cake with a heavy whip,  cream cheese and chocolate frosting.  This is the first cake my spouse and I ate completely in three days.  That's never been done.  I used a 9x13 cake pan.  This cake rose really high in the pan.  Please make this cake, you will not be disappointed.
2/9/16 - This is the only chocolate cake I will bake, there is no cake better.  Recently, I started added chocolate chips just because.... I wished that there was a yellow version of this but there isn't so I just make a yellow Texas sheet cake when I want a yellow vision and change the baking time.  Still the BEST cake ever.

This is seriously the best cake recipe I've tried. It is perfectly moist and so so so delicious. We added chocolate pudding to the batter and it turned out even thicker, more flavorful, and even more addicting. I also love it with cream cheese frosting.

Moist, chocolatey, quick to put together and it rises well.  If you want a no fail moist chocolate cake - go no further. This is worth the high grades.

Loved it!! Made it exactly as written and it came out beautifully. Needed full forty minutes in a 9" round as others have said to get the right texture, but its definitely worth the wait. Made as cupcakes also, but the time needed was closer to 20-25 min. In my opinion, best chocolate cake ever!

This is by far the best cake recipe I have ever tried.  My husband is not a chocolate lover but he LOVES this cake.  I usually put butter-cream frosting and strawberries between the cake layers and top with chocolate frosting...decadent!

I made this recipe as cupcakes with an extra 30 ml of flour and with a chocolate mocha whipped ganache frosting for the people at work. They were a big hit, one man asked to buy the leftovers and wants to order a dozen for his own birthday...lol

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! I will never buy a box of chocolate cake mix EVER again! This is incredible - you can't taste the coffee, it just compliments the cocoa and makes it rich and decadent! This seriously tastes like cake from a fancy restaurant or bakery. If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. Made yummy homemade peanut butter frosting to top it all off. MmmmMMM!!!

I've been making this cake for about 12 years now.  I haven't found one person that hasn't fallen in love with this rich,  wonderful, chocolate cake. I'm craving it right now as I type this. Soooooo yummy.

Great recipe.  I used water instead of coffee, since this was for a 3-year-old's birthday party. I multiplied the recipe by 2.5 in order to have enough batter for a round wilton 6" 2-layer cake and a round wilton 10" 2-layer cake. I'm a decorating novice, but I was looking for a heavy enough cake to support 2 layers on a 2 tiered cake with butter cream (special butter cream frosting) and marshmallow fondant, both from this site, and this one did a great job.  I also used wilton's cake realase and got a very nice crust from this recipe!

Incredible! I used this recipe last night and it was my first time making a cake, I was so nervous. Now after using such an easy, delicious recipe I feel much more confident in the kitchen so thank you!
Tips and alternative ingredients: 
I didn't use eggs, I used egg replacement powder.
I don't usually drink coffee and therefore don't own a coffee pot to brew the required pot of coffee so I used a can of Mr. Brown (it's a pacific island thing, made in Taiwan).
I couldn't find butter milk so I made some! Add one table spoon of white vinegar to a measuring cup, pour (soy in my case) milk to make one cup. Let sit five minutes then add to recipe.
Voila!

I've made this cake twice now and it is a hit every time.  After reading reviews, I was nervous about getting it out of the pans.  I cut parchment to size and sprayed the parchment on both sides, as well as the complete interior of my baking pans, and did not have a problem.  I needed an additional 5 minutes (total of 45) for my cakes to pass the prick test - maybe it's my oven? As other reviewers said, this cake is delicate after baking and is fragile to put together.  I used a chocolate ganache to fill and frost this cake, and it was a delicious birthday cake!  Everyone commented how moist and delicious it was.

We were having the super bowl party at our house and my plan was to make cupcakes and frosting them with the "colors" of the team.  I bought the special frosting; however, I forgot to buy the cake mix!  I had the ingredients for this recipe, it had great reviews so I mixed it up.  It turned out terrific.  The frosting I purchased was pretty sweet and this cake worked perfectly with the frosting.  Will be making this again.  Thank you.

Oh. My. God. I recently made this for a birthday and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD good. The Birthday Boy requested almond butter-cream frosting, which was also amazing, but incredibly sweet and not for this cake. I think next time I'll use a cream cheese frosting or skip it all-together. This cake can definitely hold it's own without a frosting. Absolute MAGIC.

By far, the most moist, decadent cake yet. My daughter wanted to bake something special for my father-in-law's birthday and it needed to be rich and chocolatey to appease his sweet tooth. At first I was concerned that with the creamy chocolate frosting we had made it would be too much but instead the cake is beautifully balanced. It is SO moist & flavorful without being too much. We added coconut flakes to mimic Almond Joy candy which is one of his favorites.

Made exactly as written and I will continue to do so several more times. This cake is so moist and smooth flavored, nothing like a box cake at all. Why make a box cake when this is so easy? I used my own butter cream recipe and add peanut butter to it....doesn't get any better than this!!

(2)Update: made this again but made cupcakes; it made exactly 24. The batter is so thin that I poured the batter in a plastic cup and easily poured the batter.     (1)Made this cake for a friend and unfortunately didn't get to try it, but it was a hit. I was told that it is very rich. I kept this simple and baked it in an aluminum pan. It fit a 9x13 pan perfectly.

Great recipe.  I used cake flour instead of AP flour for a more tender cake.  For those of you who were unsuccessful with this recipe...you need to do the toothpick test for doneness...all ovens are different.  I made cupcakes and found for my oven, 20 minutes was perfect.

This recipe was very easy to make and tastes delicious. It is so moist and chocolatey. When I made cupcakes out of this recipe they did come out a little flat, so just beware of that. This is truly the best chocolate cake recipe I have tried.

I have only made this once, but it will now be my go to recipe.  After I mixed it up, like other reviews said, it was runny.  I thought there was no way it would bake up.  But it did.  I wanted to taste before I served so I took just a small piece off the corner and it was dry.  Really concerned at this point.  When I served it...everyone LOVED it and so did I.  It was very moist and not at all dry!  Topped it with a simple chocolate fudge frosting....mmmmm....mmmmm good!

I made this cake for new year 2014 and everyone loved it! The cake came out beautifully! I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used 1 tbsp lemon juice and rest milk (total 1 cup). Soft and moist, everyone said. This is one recipe I am going to keep and pass on kids some day!

It has been my favorite for years.  I have made it so many times that many of my friends and family request this cake.  It has become the “go-to” cake for birthdays.  We always frost it with my mom’s cocoa frosting made with coffee instead of milk.  Yummy!

This is by far the moistest chocolate cake i have ever tasted or made in my life!  The only change i made was i stirred in 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips in the batter right before i poured it in the 2 layer pans.  I let it cool and frosted it with the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe on this website. Sooooo good!!

OMG ... this cake is so delicious.  I topped it with the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting (also on this site).  Talk about a delicious combo.  If you like coffee flavors, this was great.  It was the hit at my Thanksgiving table.  Everyone raved about this and I had made a ton of other desserts, but this cake/frosting went first.  Delish!!!  Oh, one thing I did was add a small box of Jello Instant Pudding/Pie mix since I add a box to every cake I make (make them extra moist).

I love this chocolate cake. I make it as a layer cake with a cool whip/vanilla/sweetened condensed milk filling and I cover the entire cake with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. I we call it the ding dong cake. Delicious!

OMG!!!!  I made this recipe exactly as written for my niece's birthday party. I was nervous because I've never made a cake from scratch before. So nervous in fact that I took a 'back-up' boxed cake with me.  Although it didn't rise as much as I thought it would,the cake was moist and delicious. I topped it with the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site and it was a HUGE hit!!! I did add chopped pb cups to the top for decoration. Thank you for sharing. Definitely a keeper!!!!!

This was easy/ fast to put together, using mostly on-hand ingredients (except the buttermilk).  Cake wasn't "amazing" tasting, but it was a good moist chocolate cake.  I had higher hopes for the final product since the batter tasted really mocha-ey, but I guess the coffee dissipated a bit during baking, because I couldn't taste any coffee/mocha after baking.  Might try a stronger coffee next time.  I frosted using "creamy chocolate frosting" from this site, and the result was a tasty snack cake.  THe cake itself wouldn't really have stood on its own that well flavor-wise, but the two together worked well.  I have a more "special occasion" chocolate cake that takes more time, but this is a nice option for a quick/easy cake that's still very good.

I made this cake to try to use up some leftover milky whey after making ricotta! So for the cup of buttermilk, I put 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/2 cup of my leftover whey. So I didn't follow the recipe entirely but the cake turned out pretty good. Nothing spectacular but it was easy enough, so I suppose I could make it again sometime.

Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed by this recipe. I followed it to a T but it sunk in the middle, stuck to everything and fell apart. I was also hoping it would taste much chocolaty-er. Sorry for the unhappy review :(

I have made this many ,many times and still my favorite I use self rising flour instead. I removed the baking powder and soda, salt. Added a stick of butter instead of the oil. Used the dark cocoa. Topped it with vanilla icing..

This is a recipe that i have used over and over for the last two years thought that it was about time I posted a review. It is incredibly moist cake that is a treat with either whipped cream or ice cream. The kids love it. I do agree with some of the reviews posted before than it is an incredibly sweet cake so I switched to brown cane sugar instead of whit and I have been measuring it to a little under a cup measurement so that it is not quite 2 cups of sugar. Also because I don't want it too become bitter especially for the kids I make a more of a weak to medium strength cup of coffee. however the first few times I followed the recipe exactly and made changes as i went along, its a foolproof recipe that works every single time.

This is my "GO TO" chocolate cake from now on; simple and SO moist and delicious!  I filled it with a whipped cream chocolate frosting and then covered the outside with chocolate ganache!  SO GOOD!  My husband requested something chocolately for his birthday cake this year and this is truly worthy of a celebration!

I've made this cake several times now. The first time I made it, I didn't make any modifications, but the second and third times, I added one small packet of Cook and Serve Chocolate Pudding mix to the batter. Cake is awesome with or without the modification tho.

I thought this cake was fantastic!  This is the first time though where I thought my cake was a little "salty".  Weird, but I think it may have something to do with the baking powder.  This recipe is definitely at the top of my list, although I will use aluminum free baking powder or maybe decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I have never noticed that taste in a cake before.

Best chocolate cake recipe ever!  So easy to make.  Super moist.  I frosted it with a lite layer of peanut butter frosting and it was a big hit.  Will definitely be adding this recipe to my collection!

Super moist & Chocolaty.....easy to make & kids LOVED it!  I used soured milk instead of buttermilk & made into cupcakes - 18min & done although shiny & wasn't sure...unfortunately they fell after taking out of the oven..Im blaming the Lynyrd Skynyrd music I was blasting at the time...built them back up with lots of fluffy frosting & they were still a hit :))))

The best chocolate cake ever! I made it in 2 9" round pans and frosted with 2 recipes of the Creamy Chocolate frosting (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Creamy-Chocolate-Frosting/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=chocolate%20frosting&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page) and it tasted like it was from the bakery!

This cake was AMAZING. I was planning on frosting it with a cream cheese mocha frosting, but this cake was so moist and delicious, it didn't need anything. It was a huge hit at the BBQ I attended. The only problem I had was that I didn't make enough!

Amazingly moist, perfect chocolate cake! Used regular milk since I had neither buttermilk or vinegar to create buttermilk and it tastes amazing! I don't know if I'm missing anything by not using buttermilk but I can't imagine. This is the perfect chocolate cake!:)

I  made this and took it to work... they devoured it. One lady told me it was the best chocolate cake she ever had, (I have to admit I agree). Everybody raves over it. May I suggest a simple chocolate frosting recipe.

For a change, we made this cake for a birthday instead of buying the normal ice cream cake from a popular chain store, and lets just say, we weren't disappointed.  We made this along with the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe and together the cake was amazing.  The coffee enhances the chocolate flavors and the cake is perfectly spongy/moist.  Even 48 hours later there was no change in how moist the cake was.

The cake took 35 minutes to fully bake. Make sure you cool it to room temperature or lower before removing it from the pan. It is very most, soft and delicious ! Thanks for the recipe, my husband loved the cake ! I filled it with mocha whipped cream filling and chocolate ganache on the top.

PHENOMINAL! Best chocolate cake recipe ANYWHERE! This cake comes out so dark, so moist, so delicious and perfect I'll never buy boxed again!  It looks really runny when you pour it in so don't be afraid...that's normal! It comes out perfect still though and is seriously, the best thing I've ever eaten.  I made a home-made chocolate mint frosting that just made this thing divine!!!

This cake is better than a 5-star recipe!  I haven't always had the best results with cake from scratch before, so I braced myself for not-so-stellar results when I tried this for my daughter's 5th birthday.  Not only did this cake mix together almost as fast as a boxed cake mix, it baked up beautifully and tastes AMAZING!!  It is fluffy, moist, and the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten - the whole family agreed this was absolutely delicious.  I frosted this cake with the Special Buttercream Frosting from this site, delicious!  My youngest daughter, who just had a birthday last month, has already requested it for her next birthday!  I think the highest compliment though, was from my 5-year-old who NEVER eats the actual cake, but rather just the frosting.  Not this time though - she cleaned her whole plate and said it was the best cake ever.

This cake was absolutely delicious...tasted like a Hostess Suzy Q, only better!  I added an extra egg, teaspoon of vanilla, and teaspoon of baking powder.  Frosted with a home made vanilla frosting.  This cake was super moist.  This is now my go to chocolate cake.

Great chocolate cake! This is my go to recipe chocolate cake!
My brother was concerned it would taste too much like coffee, but you couldn't taste it at all, it just enhanced the chocolate flavour!

I made this cake for my husbands bday and it was amazing, not too sweet because it has a dark chocolate flavor, I used the chocolate ganache recipe from this site for a filling between the cakes and then made the creamy chocolate frosting also from this site to top the cake, It was really good, and not overly sweet :) thanks for the amazing recipe.

This recipe made delicious cupcakes.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty for a dozen moist chocolate cupcakes.  I do want to confess to my disastrous attempt at using this recipe for cakes, not to the fault of the person who submitted this recipe which is why it doesn't reduce the stars I'm giving it.  I didn't pay attention and baked my cakes thinking I was going to use them and make Black Forest Cake.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to remove those cakes from the baking pans after cooling for ONLY 10 minutes.  I left mine for several hours without thinking anything of it and they wouldn't come out at all.  My husband said it was so depressing to smell chocolate every time he lifted the trash lid!  LOL!!  So, I'm going to attempt that again and don't anticipate any problem.

I always take things five minutes out of the oven before its required cooking time. And its a good thing I did. It came out perfect at 25 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. It was moist and not too sweet. The coffee was a great addition to the flavor. The next day however, the "muffin top" became a bit dried up and chewy. Since the edges are the first thing you bite into, it kinda takes away from the cupcake. The middle part is still very moist and delicious. The next time I make it, I'll make sure to not fill the cups as much. Other than that, it was very good.

I made this cake tonight for the second time. I learned a trick from Joy the Baker that helps make sure you get cakes out all in one piece - grease the pans, then put a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, grease the bottom again and then flour the pan. It's extra security, and it's worked great for me so far. I have noticed that this cake tastes better after sitting for at least a day - preferably two or three days. I don't particularly care for the taste much when it's fresh, but as it ages the coffee mellows and the chocolate deepens, resulting in the best chocolate cake I've found yet. Both times I have used milk soured with vinegar instead of buttermilk - this time I used goat's milk. I am curious as to how other people have stored the cake. Last time I made it into a layer cake and frosted it, and kept it in the fridge covered with plastic, but we decided that we prefer it plain and made ahead of time, so I'm wondering how to store it for the next two days until I need it.

This will be my go-to chocolate cake from now on!  Super moist but light and great intense chocolate flavour!  Use Ghiradelli cocoa and increase to 1 cup like other reviewers recommend. Soooo easy for cupcakes since the batter is so thin and pourable.  My cupcakes had fresh orange curd filling and orange buttercream... everyone who tried them just raved!!

Incredible chocolate cake, hands down the best from scratch chocolate cake I've ever made. Moist and rich with chocolate flavor; good enough to eat on its own or frost (as I did) with fluffy PB frosting from this site. When I started making the cake, I went to add the sugar and didn't realize I was 1/2 cup short. I still decided to forge ahead and the results are STILL amazing even with the reduced sugar. Highly recommended recipe!! Thanks for sharing :)

This is the first cake I've made from scratch (but not nearly the first cake I've ever eaten, so I know what I'm talking about here) and I can honestly say this is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It is moist, full flavored, and rich; and the icing on the cake (figuratively speaking) is how easy it is to make. I don't even have a real mixer and I made a cake that had the room silent once people started eating it (with the exception of some chocolate induced heavy breathing of course). I decorated the cake with a deliciously decadent chocolate butter cream icing, which added to the memorable experience of eating it. I will definitely make this cake again as soon as I have an excuse to do so.

This is the best chocolate cake I know of!  My only change was to use shortening instead of vegetable oil, which is hardly a change at all.  Great with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting recipe from this site.

I've never baked a cake from scratch in my life until today. I baked this cake for my daughter's birthday, and it turned out fantastic. The whole family loved it. I used Hershey's dark cocoa powder (we like the dark chocolate) and baked it in a 13x9 pan. It was black, moist and delicious.

Super moist delicious chocolate cake!  Extra bonus b/c it includes basic ingredients that you already have on hand.  For the buttermilk, I just do one TBSP white vinegar to a cup of milk and let it sit for 5 minutes.

This cake was very moist, but not really rich. It was just not to my taste but there is nothing wrong with it. I just expected more based on all the great reviews. It also really stuck to my prepared pans. I bake alot and don't usually have that trouble.

I have done a lot of baking and I've made a few different types of cake.  This was my favorite.  I made two 9in rounds and took them out of the oven at 30minutes and made a perfectly moist and delicious cake.  About the only thing you could do wrong here is try to get to fancy and screw up the measurements or bake time..Avoid those things and you've got yourself a great recipe that you can follow exact with no worries.  Thanks for posting it!

Moist and delicious, but just not chocolaty enough for me, so the second time I made it I upped the cocoa to 1 cup - perfect!! As a side note, I have to laugh at the calorie count for this cake. 155 calories for a slice of rich, decadent, chocolate cake?? Now THAT'S magic -- until you read that they say there are 24 servings!! That makes for very teeny, tiny servings which very few of us will actually do, but, ummm . . . well, let's just chalk it up to good marketing. haha

Really good, chocolatey, moist. I didn't have buttermilk and really didn't want to go buy any so substituted 1 Tbsp vinegar with milk. and that worked out fine. I frosted it with Chocolate Fudge Buttercream frosting from this site. This is my new go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Simply delicious.

FABULOUS cake, fairly dense, not too sweet, and nicely moist. Good flavor, but I might add a little more cocoa next time. Easy to make, too! I'll be making this one a lot in the future, especially if it keeps nicely. I saw that some reviews mentioned that it doesn't dome up... will be nice for rounds that I'm going to stack, but my 9x13 cake was flat out of the oven and sunk a bit in the center as it cooled. I just put less frosting around the edges to make it look flat and noone could tell, but don't make a 9x13 if that is a concern to you. Might be an issue if you're using just powdered sugar or a glaze.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and everyone loved it.  Everyone complimented that it was the best cake ever, and my brother-in-law turned to his wife and asked her to make the cake for his birthday (so I gave her the recipe).  I followed the recipe per written, except I used HERSHEY'S International Delight Gourmet Coffee Creamer (Chocolate/Caramel) instead of white milk (somewhat following another reviewer's use of french vanilla creamer).  I also followed the advice of others to line the cake pans with parchment paper, and had no problem with the cakes falling apart.  I also used a buttercream chocolate frosting recipe from another website that was very simple, and then topped with chocolate shavings.

I made this cake for my birthday and I absolutely LOVED it!!! It really is a magic cake, no matter how much I ate from it, I could not get enough of it!! The batter may seem really thin, but when you bake it, it comes out rich, thick and moist, complete magic!!! I will definitely be making this cake on my hubby's upcoming birthday. What I love about this cake (besides the cake itself) is how basic and simple the recipe is. Most of the stuff you have right at home. For buttermilk, I just used about a cup of milk with 2-3 tablespoons of white vinegar. I also used a coffee butter cream frosting from this site, but the cake tastes just as good without it. :)

This recipe definitely rates 5 stars!  I've made it twice -- the first time as written and the second time substituting 2/3 cup of Egg Beaters and two tablespoons of instant espresso powder dissolved in a cup of hot water.  As other readers have noted, there is no detectable coffee in the cake, but rather a depth and richness of flavor that are wonderful. I used the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting from this site and served it with coffee ice cream.  Stellar!

Great, moist cake.  Made for an office B-Day party.  It was easy and tasted oh so good with chocolate buttercream frosting.  It took longer to bake than stated for a 13 x 9, but worth the wait.

I'd never made a chocolate cake from scratch or made one using buttermilk.  I was hesistant at first because the batter was so thin but it worked out well in the end. Just don't forget to add the baking soda like I did the first time otherwise you will end up with a black magic brownie =)

I had great success with first try. Cut sugar to 2/3 c if you are Asian or like slightly sweet. I used 1 c orange juice and 1 c milk soured with lemon juice( ~ 1 Tbsp). Made 2 dozens cupcakes. I filled mine with cream cheese filling. Yum:-)

This is the best cake ever!  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it still came out fine.  We like it with Cool Whip Frosting.  Also used a French vanilla flavored coffee and dark chocolate cocoa.  Yummy!

a very good recipe, I like a chocolate cake and think i will search for one but not because the recipe. The batter gave me a scare because it was so thin but rised just fine and turned out beautiful, nice and airy.

This was by far the best most moist chocolate cake I have ever made. I followed the directions to a T and it was perfect. I did make into cupcakes and it amde 24. They were cooked perfectly at 20 minutes.

Wow, this cake is GOOD! It's moist and tender, with a nice crumb. I used a heaping cup of cocoa powder and it was the perfect amount for me. I baked it in a 9 X 13 pan for 30 minutes. I didn't frost it, just sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. Would be good with almost any flavor frosting (coffee, peanutbutter, vanilla, chocolate, coconut......) This is a quick throw-together recipe, one of the easiest I've ever made. Why would anyone use a box mix??

I made this exactely as the recipe stated. It came out perfect. However it is EXACTELY like Betty Crocker Moist Dark Chocolate Cake mix. I'm not saying that the cake didn't deserve praise but going through all the effort to bake from scratch, with the end result being same like a Betty Crocker Cake was probably not worth the hassle :(

This is my favorite cake, usually I use the chocolate cheese frosting recipe from this site with it, but this time I used the chocolate cheese frosting and then raspberry jam for the middle frosting layer... and piped some on the top... YUM. Oh, and I chopped up a dark chocolate bar and put it into the batter before baking...

I iced with the "fluffy seven-minute frosting" from this site and it was a roaring success!

Incredible recipe! I baked it just as the recipe said, but in a Bundt pan and covered it with a chocolate ganache glaze. I brought it to a party where there were way too many desserts, and I was amazed to see this cake had disappeared within minutes while other desserts went untouched. Everyone raved about it- definitely my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

Amazing! I used the Hershey’s Special Dark cocoa powder in the cake and I added a layer of cherry pie filling between the cakes.  I frosted the cake using the special dark chocolate frosting recipe on the back of the Hershey’s container. The pie filling actually added the perfect amount of sweetness since the cake and frosting were so dark. My husband was super impressed! Thank you!

A moist and easy cake that was just delish! Really great, rich, chocolate flavour.  I subbed whole wheat flour and sour whole milk instead of buttermilk and it turned out great!  I also used a vanilla via packet for the coffee.

The first words out of everyone's mouth consisted of compliments of how AMAZING this cake tasted! 
I was hesitant at first when I was mixing the ingredients because the batter was REALLY runny but I looked through the reviews and other people said not to worry about it - and it's true! The cake turned out very moist and it was easy to remove it off the baking pan.
The few changes I made was instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup white 1 cup brown. In addition, I only have instant coffee (my roommate's) and I made my own buttermilk by mixing 1 tablespoon of lemon juice with 1 cup of 1%milk. 
To top it all off, I had a whipped cream cheese frosting - which really completed the rich chocolate taste.
I saw this recipe on the Hershey's cocoa powder box but it's a little different because the baking soda & powder amounts are altered.
Thanks again!!

This cake was wonderful. Made it in a 9 x 13  pan and topped it with a medium chocolate buttercream icing from a hersey cocoa can and it was the best. Don't worry that the batter is thin, it bakes up just fine.

Very good moist cake.  I used regular whole milk and instant coffee. Delicious!

*** Just made this cake AGAIN... We love it!! I use a cream cheese frosting. It doesn't last long in this house. For my mother in law's birthday I used blue food coloring to make a light blue frosting. It looked amazing with the dark brown cake..

so easy and so delicious. The only change I made was a substitution of heavy cream for the buttermilk. I simply didn't have any on hand or I would have stuck to the recipe exactly. I will make this again with the buttermilk and I am sure that it will be even better. I made whipped cream with the leftover cream and topped it with a can of cherry pie filling and it was spectacular!

Ohhhh...this is really good.  I will never make cake from a box again!     I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  Baked for about 20 minutes.   Really yummy!  I made a cream cheese frosting to go with, and that was good, but I think a chocolate frosting will go a lot better.

So easy and very flavorful! The coffee gives depth to the flavor of the cake, not a strong coffee taste. Will be using this many times in the future!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for Halloween.I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out extremely moist and delicious.I love this recipe because it calls for oil instead of butter so it's very quick and easy to make.I frosted half of them with a white frosting where you just beat a stick of butter at medium speed until creamy then gradually add 3 cups of powdered sugar,beat until smooth then add a teaspoon of vanilla and 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk.I frosted the other half with chocolate frosting but I really loved the white frosting the best.Delicious!

This is an excellent Cake!  So moist, and delicious. I made it in a bundt pan and 35mins later it was perfect.  The taste is so rich and incredible, not overly sweet and the coffee makes it that much better.  Will be making again!

I was craving desert tonight and wanted something fast and easy. It was fast and easy. I didn't have buttermilk, so I added a tbsp of lemon juice to 2% milk and let it sit for 5 minutes. I also substituted the sugar with Splenda's half & half sugar.  It turned out good, but that Splenda aftertaste is still there. Trying to get used to it.  To me it was your basic chocolate cake, I liked it, but nothing too special.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

So good!! I agree its a nice change to have a cake thats HOMEMADE!!! very good, nice texture. I used the chocolate cheese frosting from this site and it turned out yummy! I followed someone's advice from a review and froze the cakes for about 20 minutes before trying to get them out of the pan. . and it worked great. . .even for someone who usually messes those kinds of things up!  Decorated with the chocolate cheese frosting and some candy corn for a cute fall look!! my friends were impressed!!

I was so excited to make this because of the 5 star rating but I did not care for it. The texture of the cake was like a sponge. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I'm not sure if I'll give it a 2nd try or not. I did make vanilla bean cream cheese frosting that was great.

This cake is amazing! I've made it twice now, once for a family function (my family devoured the cake) and another for my dad's work who also loved this cake. I followed the directions word for word, and baked for a full 40 mins and the cake came out perfectly. People are shocked when I tell them it's from scratch because of how moist the cake is. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This is superb! I love the moistness of the cake itself. I made them in cupcakes, and they looked beautiful because of the extreme darkness. However, the only thing I did not like was the somewhat lingering taste of coffee-next time I will not add as much. Otherwise, will make again!

My children are throwing a Halloween party and I have been recruited to make the food so I baked this cake last week to test the recipe. All of my guinea pigs agreed it was the best chocolate cake they've ever had! It was very moist and incredibly rich when paired with my homemade chocolate frosting. I'll be making this for every occasion where a chocolate cake is requested. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and this cake was delicious.  I suggest spraying your cake pans with Pam or really greasing them up because although I did as this recipe asked my cake still stuck to the bottom of the pans.

I followed the directions and because I read all the reviews and cooked it the full 40 minutes, it was OVERCOOKED.  Next time 30-35 minutes.  Other than a bit firm, a very good cake.  I used the Rich Chocolate Icing and it is FAB!  I will try this again and update.

This is the BEST recipe!  It's so easy and it's delicious!  I get compliments all the time on how moist this cake is.  This is the only cake recipe I use.  I like to get creative everytime I make it.  So far the best frosting I made was buttercream frosting and sliced strawberrys between the two layers!! All I have to say to the person who created this: THANK YOU

I'm always on the hunt for THE perfect chocolate cake recipe and I think I found it! It's super moist and soft with a really great chocolate flavour. I'm the type of person who doesn't like to eat chocolate cake the day it's made (I think it tastes better the next day), but this cake tastes incredible any time! This is my go-to recipe from now on.

I have made this many times.  it is the ONLY chocolate cake recipe i will use (after trying many).  It is so perfectly dark, moist, and with just the right amount of sweetness.  And looks beautiful when cut into.  Most recently i made it for my mom's birthday, and 2 months later people are still talking about it.  I think I prefer it with homemade cream cheese frosting.  Although chocolate goes great too ;-)

Loved the cake, very chocolatey, very moist. Batter is indeed thin, but the cake came out perfect. Needed the full 40 minutes though. Because the cake quite easily falls apart, I found it better to make the cake the day before filling and decorating it. Make sure to keep it refrigerated, or put it in the freezer for a few hours before decorating.

My world has been rocked by this cake! I used a bundt pan and make a frosting with 3/4 choc chips, 3 tbls butter, 1 tbls corn syrup and 1 tsp vanilla. Seriously amazing and crowd pleasing.

Moist but not as flavourful as I thought it would be - quite floury.  I used the correct sized pan, so I don't know why the top cracked.  Maybe it needs a bigger pan.  And it definately took a lot longer to bake, about 20 mins more (though I reduced heat to 150 degrees C).

Excellent cake! The coffee is not over powering, it gives it a nice mocha taste. It was very moist, and as another reviewer mentioned, the batter was very thin or "liquidy," which made me a little nervous, but it baked beautifully in exactly 30 minutes.  I avoid spraying the edges of the pan so the center doesn't sink and let it cool in pan before removing from pan.  Then put in freezer for 20 minutes before frosting.

Just made this cake, and it came out pretty bad. The cake was all bubbly, and the center had a hard, crusty top. It is very moist, but virtually flavorless- I couldn't taste any chocolate at all. What did I do wrong? I used sifted cake flour, 1c milk + 1TBS lemon juice for the buttermilk, and very hot French press coffee. My guess is that I should have let the coffee cool before adding it. I'm disappointed it didn't turn out well, but maybe I will try it again someday.

This was soooo good! I made it exactly as written, but I tasted the batter and it had a stronger coffee taste than I would have liked, so I increased the cocoa to a full cup to balance it out. It was moist, tender, and so fragrant! I made a 2-layer 9 inch cake and used the "Chocolate Ganache" recipe from this site for the frosting to make the ultimate combination! Absolutely delicious!

I only had enough cocoa powder to make half of a batch, but it still turned out GREAT! I made cupcakes out of the batter. So moist, so good. I used a mixture of 1/2 cold espresso and 1/2 cold coffee for the 1 C. of coffee.   Will definitely make this again.

This is my go-to chocolate cake/cupcake recipe. I have made it many times.  I always have the ingredients on hand, it is easy to make, and makes a delicious cake.  I do prefer it as cupcakes, as they seem to come out a bit more moist but the cake tastes great as well.

The catchy name of this cake is more than just a moniker: it really was magic that the cake batter, which was pure liquid managed to provide a solid, light, fluffy cake and the cake was deeply dark colored due to the addition of coffee. I used Cafe du Monde chicory coffee and consequently the cake had a chicory taste, which some may like. The baking time for me was 30 min. While the cake was light, and fluffy, I don't think it would be very enjoyable without frosting, but chocolate cakes all tend to be fairly plain without frosting. I used cake flour and that probably helped it become even fluffier.

Absolutely Divine!  I used Dark Chocolate Cocoa instead of regular and we loved it.  I'm not usually a chocolate cake fan but this was so moist and the hint of coffee just rounded it all out.  I used the Creamy Chocolate Icing and a raspberry filler to complete this amazing cake.

I just made this cake using a Gluten Free flour mix.  Generally when I use GF flour I use xanthan gum so it isn't too thin but I ran out.  This recipe still worked amazingly without it and using the GF flour.  Though I was a little hesitant as it literally was like water based soup consistency.

I acutally made this cake for the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake recipe on this site instead of using the box mix that was called for.  I orginally made 2 layers to put a filling in between and then frost.  I could not get the filling to set up and went ahead and put it on the cake anyway.  It all ended up in the garbage as a big soupy mess.  But, before I threw it out, I tasted the cake.  Marvelous.  Probably the best chocolate cake I have ever had. And I was actually hesitant because of the amount of coffee used - I am not a coffee drinker.  I made the cake as written except for using 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  It was moist, flavorful, and I ended up making another one in a 9X13 pan that I will put a chocolate ganache on in the morning to take to work.

This cake tasted great and was easy to make. I did use a little less sugar than the recipe called for. I also didn't have buttermilk, so i added some white vinegar to 1 cup of milk and substituted. For the filling I used a cream cheese frosting, I frosted the outside with chocolate cream cheese and decorated the sides with sliced almonds. Looked and tasted great - got lots of compliments!

Excellent!  Even my son that doesn't care for chocolate came back for a second, HUGE piece! I frosted this with 7 Minute Frosting, which is a marshmallow-like frosting and put crushed Oreos around the edges of the cake. Didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular 1% milk and all was perfect!

Wowie!!!   This was the first homemade cake I have attempted - and it came out sOooOOOO good.  Super moist and chocolatey delicious.   I have made it since several times at the request of my boyfriend - it  is such an easy, almost foolproof cake. Just make sure you have fresh baking soda & if you can find it use valhrona dark powdered chocolate

This is my first scratch cake attempt and it was a success. Easy to make and quite delicious. I probably baked it for too long as it was a bit dry on the edges. And I liked it better after overnight refrigeration with frosting. I did a 2 layer cake with strawberry preserve in the middle and it was a great combo.

This cake is perfect. I did use plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and added only 1-cup sugar. With all the adjustments, it still tasted great. Use Aluminum foil brushed with oil to help it come out easily because the cake itself is very moist and may I say delicious.

This cake was absolutely delicious! It was moist and the coffee gave it a great flavor. I made it for a friend's birthday party at work and everybody loved it. Being a chocolate junky, I have to say this is one of the best chocolate cakes I've tasted.

This cake was surprisingly good.  I especially like that it does not use a box cake mix as many do on this site.  I had my first piece shortly after it came out of the oven and it seemed a little sticky, but after it cooled, it was fine.  I agree with some other reviews, it IS better the next day!  It was super moist and didn't dry out quickly.  I would definitely make it again.  This recipe is a keeper.  My sister and bf (who doesn't care for cake) both really liked it.

Very good cake.  Coffee flavor is not apparent--tastes like a devil's food cake.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I used a cup of thick Greek yoghurt and 2 tablespoons of milk and it came out just fine.

I was disappointed in how this cake turned out.  I found that it lacked a rich chocolate flavour, and tasted quite plain.  I prefer a quick 'box' cake over this one!  I won't make it again.

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I've come across.  I bake cakes all the time, and I'm always looking for the next best cake recipe... but this is one I keep going back to.  It is very moist and delicious.  I line my cake pans with parchment paper to make removal a breeze.

Your search for the best chocolate cake recipe is over!  This is it. I used chocolate raspberry coffee in the batter and frosted with chocolate buttercream frosting. My guests kept commenting on how moist it was.

This was the BEST chocolate cake I ever made.  Everyone went nuts over it and wanted the recipe.  The batter does seem thin, but just go with it - it turns out great!  I made mine in a 9x13 pan and used the "chocolate cream cheese frosting" recipe from allrecipes for a beautiful mouth watering combination.

I tried the recipe before with 1 cup of milk and one cup of water and it was good, but the coffee and the buttermilk made it perfect, the butter milk makes it more moist and the coffee made the chocolate flavor stronger but I did't feel any coffee flavor in the cake . I used 1 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar.

Well... I forgot the baking soda. I haven't made a mistake in years so I suppose it was about time. It was very, very flat. However... it was tasty. I'm sure if I had added the baking soda it would've been very tasty.

It's a good cake if you're looking for a chocolate cake.  If you're looking for a mocha or capuccino cake, then this is not it to make.  I brew the coffee really strong but still didn't tast any coffee in the cake.  I think I'd stick with the Hershey's dark chocolate recipe.

This cake is so delicious.  I baked the cake as directed.  I filled it with a rum custard filling and then frosted it with a whip cream frosting.  Everyone loved the cake as it was way too yummy!!!

This is the second time I used this cake recipe and just love it.  It is great for the chocolate lover in your family.  I stuck pretty much to the recipe except I subbed one cup of the white sugar for brown.  I whipped up a batch of buttercream chocolate frosting and it was moist delicious.  I also used a sheet pan and it worked just fine this helps when your busy.  The secret is to use fresh and good quality cocoa it makes such a difference.  Love it!

The cake was SUPER! Everyone loved it!  I have a single note, though. Tha cake took way more time (about double) in the oven even though I used the same temperature.  Oh, and I changed the coffee used to Classic Nescafe dissolved in a cup of water. Mmm...delicious.

Fantastic cake! Simple yet delicious! I made this for a big group of friends and loaded it up with some chocolate chip/butter/powdered sugar icing and it was perfect! We were calling it pudding cake it was so moist!  Thanks for the great recipe, I will be keeping this for years and years!

After greasing & flouring a non stick pan somehow parts of this cake still stuck to the pan. I followed the recipe and this is the 1st time a cake ever stuck like this for me. Decent moist taste but no wow factor for our likes. Too much of a risk factor so I would not make this cake again.

Easy to make, tasty.  They were really light (in crumb, not color).  The coffee flavor added an extra dimension that I'm not sure I loved.  I'll play with this one again.

Absolutely super moist... very easy to make (made it with my toddler).  I didn't have buttermilk, but the substitution (milk/ vinegar) worked just as well.  I will definately make this again and again!

This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Be sure to line the cake pans with parchment paper for easy removal of this delicate cake. I made a two layer cake and frosted it with the 7-minute frosting (google Karo corn syrup.) It tastes like a very fresh Hostess Suzie-Q! Yum.

Very good cake. Used chocolate truffle coffee and it added just a hint more mocha decadence. The cake by itself would not be quite sweet enough for my taste, but topped with the chocolate frosting I recipe found on this site, it is wonderful - would highly recommend trying this recipe (note: you can also replace the coffee with coke or dr. pepper for an interesting variation)!

This is good, but not the best. Same recipe that is on the back of Hershey's Cocoa box only it uses boiling water rather than coffee.

Heavenly! This cake is moist and fluffy. Great go-to-cake. Made it for a dinner party almost everyone left with the recipe! FYI I didn't have vanilla so substitued with equal amounts of maple syrup, also didn't have buttermilk and subbed with 1 C milk and 1 tsp of lemon juice. I added a little cocoa powder to cream cheese frosting, sooo good!

terrific cake,. I iced it with "chocolate icing" by Chas recipe from this site. Everyone loves this cake. It seems to be more moist the second day. I cooked it for 35 minutes. Wonderful cake.

I was very skeptical of how this would turn out because as others have said, it looked very runny. I'd also never added coffee to cake before, so I worried about the flavor totally overpowering it.  All my worries dissolved when I took my first bite of this cake. It is the most delicious, moist, wonderful cake I have ever had! I made two for Thanksgiving and frosted them with buttermilk frosting. I would've preferred a glaze kind of like in the picture, but I was strapped for time. It was still delicious and has room for many other topping options! Next time I want to try and make it with some sort of raspberry glaze. Mmmm.  Just... Amazing. This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Very moist.  I made it in a bunt-cake pan so I had to increase the bake time for 15 min, but it came out perfect.

This is truly the one & only best chocolate cake.  Aside from using two 9" rounds instead of a 9x13, I followed the recipe exactly and had perfect results.  I frosted the cake with my favorite chocolate frosting recipe: 6 oz. good semisweet chocolate, 2 sticks unsalted butter, 1 large egg yolk, 1 tsp. vanilla,  1 1/4 C. confectioner's sugar, 1 Tbs. instant coffee.)   I researched this recipe and discovered it has been used & demonstrated by several well known celebrity chefs during the past decade.

Superb easy recipe for a homemade cake!  The coffee really brings out the chocolate flavor.  It was tender and rich and baked evenly too.  I made two single layer cakes frosted with white buttercream and topped with chocolate ganache.  Amazing!  I can't wait to make this again!

I was looking for a birthday cake for a good friend of mine.  Every year I make him a cake and mostly get the recipes off this website.  This year I wanted to try something new.  WELL, let me tell you, I made this and it was a hit I cannot even begin to tell you how good it was.  He is a co-worker of mine and several people stopped in his office to celebrate and have cake.  Everyone could not stop raving about this cake.  They all said it was the best chocolate cake they ever had.  I am certainly keeping this recipe to use again.  Very easy to make, I didn't change a thing and it was perfect!  Great for the chocolate lovers out there.

I made this for my daughter's second birthday and it was a HUGE hit! It wasn't chocolaty enough for my taste, so I added about 1/2 cup of melted chocolate to the batter and it was awesome with chocolate-peanut butter cream cheese filling.

Hubby said "it's a killer" and requested I make it for an upcoming meeting...very moist and easy! Used about 1/4 cup dark cocoa for part of the cocoa as I ran out of regular while making this. Used a chocolate cream cheese frosting (from this site) with the dark cocoa as I don't use baking chocolate squares; it made a very dark cake. Delicious!

Absolutely amazing. Make sure you get the cake out of the oven as soon as possible to leave it super moist. I frosted it with standard Pillsbury frosting and it was so incredibly tasty. My family was amazed.

I planned to make this cake for a Halloween party.  A week ahead I made a "test" cake.  Let me tell you, this is THE BEST chocolate cake.  I took half of it to work and the raves were overwhelming!  Needless to say it was a hit at the party and several people asked for the recipe.   I followed the recipe and the only adjustment I used (if you want to call it that) was soured milk instead of buttermilk.  I used ganache in the middle and top.  It was wonderful!  The cake was still moist 2 days later!   My D/H says this is the cake I have to make for his birthday. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch.  I was a little nervous when the batter was so thin, but was pleasantly suprised at how fantastic the cake turned out.  I brought it over to dinner at my parents and my dad said it was by far his new favorite chocalate cake.  This was pretty amazing for my dad to say since my mom is known for her wonderful cakes!

I was really disappointed in this cake, the batter was delicious! I also made a really fantastic chocolate frosting, but together it was bland.

This cake was a huge success at my Halloween party.  Deliciously moist and cooked to perfection in 33 minutes.  I cooked it in a 9x13 pan and used a vanilla glaze frosting that I dyed orange to compliment the rich chocolate taste.  Many people called it the best chocolate cake they had ever had.

Incredibly moist and delicious and just as easy to prepare as a cake mix in a box.   Didn't have time to brew coffee so I dissolved some instant espresso granules in a cup of water. I used a 9x13 pan and it rose just fine and didn't stick to the pan at all.  (Baked at 350 for 32 mins)  This is now my family's favorite chocolate cake recipe.  We iced it with the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting (also on the Allrecipes site).  Thanks so much, Marsha, for the excellent recipe!

Good basic chocolate cake. Made no changes. This will be a go-to "easy" chocolate cake recipe but you do get a better cake fr recipes that involve more steps/additions etc. for airiness.

I know I wont be making any other chocolate other than this one.  It was FANTASTIC.  I am a die hard chocolate fan.  Moist, crumbly, yet stays together, and perfect.

This cake is great! I used splenda instead of sugar. The only problem I had was it sticking to the pan (bundt) and a big chunk was broken off. If I was making this for company I would not take the chance and would use a 9x13 pan instead.  Very moist cake! Used a chocolate glaze and garnished with whip cream when serving.

Gosh, not sure what I did wrong with this recipe but I had the hardest time getting it to come out of the pans without falling apart.  I let them cool enough and I greased my pans and I also tried using my silicone pans but I still had sticking problems.  However, all in all, the taste was lovely and I hide the bits that fell off from sticking with icing.  I'll try this again just to rule out my human error.

It's amazing how moist this cake is.  I also wondered about whether I put the ingredients together properly since the batter was like water.  Sure enough, it was OK!  I will try making cupcakes next time.

This cake was pretty simple to make but i had alot of trouble getting the cakes out of the pans. I took my time greasing and flouring the pans beforehand and cooked for the full 40 minutes. I guess this cake is just extremely fragile. One of my layers fell apart when i took it out. Other than that it was amazing!

The only problem I have with this this cake is that I'm sick to death of making it. I've had almost non-stop requests for this-- every birthday, every holiday-- ugh. Someone even told me to make this for my own wedding cake!  I top this cake by drizzling bitter chocolate ganache over it and make the coffee as strong as possible. It's perfect.

Holy smolly this was the best chocolate cake I have every eaten. You have to make this and do not change a single thing! If you don't have buttermilk, just use 1 cup of milk and about 1 tbsp vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes. WOW WOW....I made this into a black forest cake it was AMAZING! Thank you for this recipe....

I made this recipe as written, only I baked it in a 9x13 pan. It was wonderful, very moist and light! I like others, was worried about how thin the batter was, but I went with it! Glad that I did! I did have to bake mine about 10 minutes longer for it to be completely done! Wonderful recipe, thank you Marsha for sharing this!!!

Not only is this cake THE BEST, it is easy to make. It is chocolaty without being dense. I've now made it as a cake and twice as cupcakes. It is, if possible, even better with the Coffee butter frosting (from this site.)

This cake is definitely magical....it is a must for a chocolate lovers dream, if there were anyway to give this 10 stars I would. I cooked it in a throw away foil 9x13 and when cooled made the following 'One Bowl Buttercream"frosting and drizzled on top. In Bowl beat 6 Tbl Soft butter, add 2 2/3 cup confections sugar, 1/2 cocoa powder, 1/3 c milk, beat stir in 1 tea.vanilla, drizzled over cake (it is not thick) YUMMY combination..Thank you Marsha!!

I am not a fan of chocolate cake - it is usually too dry - but this one is a keeper - the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had and it is so easy to make - I love it - I have made it 4 times in the past few month!  Thanks!    update - I have made this cake now a dozen times - I pair it with my foolproof chocolate frosting and it makes the best chocolate cake ever!  I only need to bake mine for 30 min and the edges usually stick (even though I use silicone paper rounds in my pans and spray them well) so I usually freeze the cake before I frost it so it falls apart less.  My next attempt will be to make cupcakes out of it!

Made this as written, it was a very thin batter, and I greased the pans and lined them with parchment paper. It came out a two very nice layers. Very chocolaty and moist. Was a huge hit.

I really liked this cake. It was fluffy and light. I used a little bit of canned pumpkin for some of the oil (maybe 1/4 cup of pumpkin and 1/4 cup of oil) and it turned out great. I think I would use dark chocolate powder to bump up the chocolate flavor and add walnuts. I didn't frost it as it was sweet enough to stand on its own.

This cake was just as easy to mix up and put in the oven as a boxed cake mix. It was AWESOME! Everyone really enjoyed the cake. No icing needed. Just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top! We did experiment with some of the leftovers and found that warmed hot fudge topping poured on top of the cake made this a rich, elegant dessert!

I doubled this recipe and made 1 three-layered cake and 1 half-layered cake (to keep home). I made the Chocolate Ganache on this website (no rum) to frost in between layers (by whipping up a portion of the ganache) and to coat the cake (using the unwhipped ganache). I refrigerated the cake overnight then covered it with sliced strawberries. The whole thing was gone after the cake was cut and people asked for seconds! I'll definitely do this again. It's VERY simple, but the layers are super soft and I had to piece them together with the frosting. No one could taste the coffee, but it did enhance the chocolate flavor and gave the cake some extra oomph.

This cake was the BOMB! It was simple and easy but delicous. Very moist and chocolatey. The batter seemed thin after it was completely mixed, but it turned out perfect!

I used this recipe on Saturday and received wonderful reviews! The cake baked up nice and thick but still moist with the right amount of sweetness. I was a little cautious about the coffee but it gave the cake a robust added flavor that you barely recognized as coffee! My family and friends loved it! I paired the cake with the scrumptious penuche frosting for filling with strawberries. The result was a tad on the extreme sweet side, but the overall outcome was superb. This will be my go to chocolate cake recipe!

I needed a good chocolate cake recipe for my mom's birthday and this was definitely a good choice. This cake is super super moist. I made it in two round pans and let them cool for 10 minutes and then put them in the freezer for another ten. I had no problem getting the cake to come out of the pans. I didn't have time to make an icing so I used good old Betty Crocker and it was very good.

I like this cake.  It is moist and flavorful.  It is a delicate cake though.  It didn't stand up to much handling (I was trying to slice in half it to make an ice cream layer).  I think I'll stick to using it as a two layer round cake - where I'm sure it will be perfect.

this cake turned out great. when i poked it with a toothpick to see if its done it came out clean which made me kinda worried cuz i didnt want it to be airy and cakey. but after letting it cool for 6 hours, it tasted very moisty and dark. mostly i could taste coffee and it wasnt that sweet. so thank god i put frosting on top. with the Rich chocolate frosting on top, it came out great.

Loved this cake!  I used a cream cheese-sugar mixture with strawberries for the filling and tried the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site.  I also stuffed the cream cheese mixture into a few strawberries to garnish.  Wonderful.

I am hopeless at baking cakes.. seriously. If it can be messed up, I will mess it up. But this recipe was AMAZING. There is no way you can go wrong.   Even a hopeless baker like me made an awesome cake.. everyone at the party loved it! It was VERY MOIST and slightly dense, but ever so YUMMY. Put some chocolate ganache on the top, and you have a winner!   Although, as pointed out by other reviewers, my cake needed a bit more time in the oven.. around 45-50 mins or so... Try it, you will not be disappointed.

A delicious and moist cake! As it is very fragile, it broke into two the first time I made it. Let the cake cool completely before removing it from the pan.

I made this recipe into mini cupcakes, filling the cups only halfway - which turned out to be perfect. They rose beautifully! They came out moist and chocolaty little bite sized treats. Frosted them with Scrumptious Penuche Frosting (recipe also on this site) for a real treat! Thanks for sharing.

This cake was amazing! The only thing I did differently was beat the egg whites seperately and fold them into the rest of the batter. It came out so light and fluffy that I ate 2 whole peices without ever feeling that it was too rich or dense. Amazing.

This is definitely a great chocolate cake.  Rich and very chocoaltey and super moist.  Plus, I can make it on a whim, since I keep all of the ingredients on hand.  I've tried it with chocolate and vanilla buttercream icings.  I think this cake is screaming for a mousse filling and ganache covering!

I found this cake to be very moist, with a deep, rich chocolate flavor that was very good.  I usually find chocolate cake to not be 'chocolatey' enough, but this one is a keeper!  I iced it with peanut butter frosting.

Yummy. My first time making a cake from scratch and it was pretty easy. Messy but easy! It seemed pretty dry (crumbly) when I took them out of the pan and put them on the racks to cool so I was kinda worried. But I frosted and served about 3 hours later and it was very moist and good. I guess what everyone else mentioned is true... it must get better with time. I wonder what it will taste like tomorrow! Thanks :)

I love cooking from scratch and this recipe fits the bill.  I was a little worried with its consistency, but it turned out perfect! I made them into cupcakes and it made 24 generous cupcakes.  Baked for about 25 mintutes and frosted with cream cheese frosting. They were gone in a flash!

A cake to share...very moist crumb, very dark, chocolately, dense, home made, old fashioned texture--delectable. I added cinnamon to the batter.  Between the cakes, I filled it with butter/cream cheese/yogurt fruit filling and frosted with cinnamon coffee frosting.  Just so perfect!  Two 9" round pan, baked in 33 mins.

This cake was excellent.  I made it without any changes and it was moist and very rich.  It is also very quick and easy to prepare.

Oh my GOSH...this really is the best chocolate cake ever!! I have made this 2 times now..The first time was the best. I did not have buttermilk when I made it the 2nd time so I used vinegar to sour the milk and it just didn't taste the same. So use the real thing!! Even my mother-in-law wants the recipe!! It's a keeper for sure!!

Perfect chocolate cake. Made for my graduation party and everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly. Paired with Creamy Chocolate Frosting and Chocolate Ganache. **Update** I also made with peanut buter frosting from this web site in a 2 layer cake. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 container of vanilla yogurt and cut back the vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp. Next time I need to let the cake cool longer before taking it out or use parchment paper because it stuck to the bottom of the pan pretty good even after grease & flouring it.

What a wonderful cake! I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce since we had applesauce that needed to be used. I used a bundt pan for this and it came out perfect after about 35 minutes. I think next time I will make the coffee stronger and I might add some mini chocolate chips to it. All in all, it's a wonderful cake and it only gets better the next day :)

For a chocolate cake (just not my fave) this earns its keep for sure. The batter is sooo thin, you won't think it will come out right, but it does. I split my batter into 3 9in round pans and two cupcakes for testing. I followed the direction exactly, using homemade buttermilk (milk and lemon juice). I'm sensitive to caffeine so the tester cupcakes gave me quite a little zip! My only problem was the cake was so moist that it was difficult to cut off the tops of the layers without it crumbling, but I managed alright. I popped them in the freezer and will shape them up a bit more after they're frozen. I plan on using Caramel Frosting V for the filling and Rich Chocolate Frosting for the outside(both from this site).

This cake is phenomenal.  I have been on a quest for the perfect chocolate cake for a while and the folks I go to Bible study with know that.  When I made *this* chocolate cake they said "Yeah, this is the one.  This is perfect."  I don't think I need to keep looking.  I made one change by using dark chocolate cocoa powder the second time I made it and it was really really really good; but I think you can go either way and be in no danger of a bad cake.

WOW, this cake recipe is truly wonderful! I was amazed at how thin the batter was but oh mine, the cake is wonderful! I added black cherry concentrate to the mix and it was so great, very moist cake. I used the chocolate butter-creme frosting also found on allrecipes.com, enjoy!

absolutely the best chocolate cake i have ever made (and i've made a few). upping the cocoa to 1 cup is the only change i would make. is best eaten after letting it sit for a day.

Good but way too moist.  I've made many chocolate cakes from scratch, but this one was almost falling apart from how moist it was.  I will make this again because I liked it, but I will reduce the liquids.  After baking, I filled the middle with strawberries and topped with fudge frosting.

I would give this cake 10 stars is I could! It was very moist, I used 1 tsp of almond extract for something different. For frosting I made a coffee flavoured icing and topped it off with chopped pecans. Delicious!

Have made this cake twice now.  First time exactly as recipe written.  The second time had to substitute 1 c water for buttermilk and 1 t. coconut extract for the vanilla. The first time it was wonderful and the second time it smelled like an Almond Joy candy bar and had that wonderful full-bodied chocolate taste with a slight hint of coconut.  Oh my!

This does not disappoint! I too was worried because the batter looked thin, however it baked up beautifully.  The cake is so moist with a wonderful chocolate flavor that gets better as the cake sits...if it lasts for more than a day!

I needed a non-dairy choc cake and this recipe worked perfectly- replaced the buttermilk with regular soy milk (didn't even bother with the lemon juice to make up for the acidity) and it was a huge hit!  Not a piece was left!

I made a low-fat version and it was JUST as good as the original -- which is the BEST chocolate cake I've ever made! I substitute Fat Free Mayo for all of the oil; used Egg Beaters instead of eggs and skim milk -- truly -- my husband could not tell the difference!

A delicious cake! Made it exactly as instructed, and it was perfect. To garnish the cake up I made a vodka-coffee sauce that I sprinkled on the bottom layer (1 part sugar to 1 part warm water, with a dash of vodka, and instant coffee to taste). For the filling and frosting I simply whipped up some light Nutriwhip - the white made a nice contrast with the darkness of the cake itself, and balanced out its sweetness nicely.

This is my favorite chocolate cake!! I like it way better than the Too Much Chocolate Cake that is highly rated on this website. I use only half the amount of sugar and sometimes I put a tablespoon or 2 of vinegar in regular milk to sour it instead of using buttermilk. Do be careful not to overbake! It could get crumbly. I bake mine in a bundt pan at  about 335 degrees. I also use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on this site. All this is just as easy as the highly rated cake mix one I mentioned previously and in my opinion, better!! try it and you will not be disappointed.

5 stars for taste but really really crumbly. It completely fell apart when I tried to ice it and ended up a crumbled mess around all 4 sides. But it tastes wonderful so it gets 4 starts. 1 star for presentation.

This is a wonderful, yummy, rich cake. Thanks!!

UPDATE! If you ever need to make a gluten free/ dairy free cake this recipe still ROCKS just use rice flour and any dairy free "milk" such as almond or soy.

Really delicious and easy--I made it for my daughter's birthday cake.  She liked it with the frosting because it was sweeter, but I could have eaten this cake plain.

So good!  I made this for a birthday at work and it was a huge hit.  I followed the previous reviewers advice and used a 7 minute frosting with melted chocolate chips.  Next time I might add more than 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, but other than that this recipe was perfect!!

I had to stop myself from having thirds!  It is heavenly decadent.  Dark chocolate is so much better than regular chocolate for making it taste like a five star restaurant's $10 dessert.  Super moist.

I made this cake for a party today and the whole thing was gone before I could take a picture! What a delicious cake! I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 cup milk and 1 tbsp vinegar as suggested by one of the reviewers. Sooooo good!!! Everyone went home with the recipe.

I normally don't care for chocolate cake, but the birthday girl requested it.  I used the sturdy whipped cream frosting with this cake and it was a great combination.  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out moist with great flavor.

This is a very rich chocolate recipie. I used cake flour and was worrried that it would not rise enough so I added 3 eggs instead of 2 and it turned out wornderful. you have to grease the cake pan good and use regular flour I had no problems with it stickng at all it came out nice. The secret is to use a small spatula and go around the edges well and cool the cakes before taking them out. I loved the icing as well. I made this today for my husbands 41 Bday.

So delicious!!  It was definitely worth five stars.  However, it is incredibly delicate.  It stuck to the pan and broke in to bits.  I didn't care that much, because it tasted amazing!  Oh and I definitely prefer it slightly underdone to overdone.  I might make it as cupcakes next time so that I don't have to worry about getting it out of the pan in one piece.

This is my favourite cake recipe ever!! I had this recipe from an Amish cookbook but when I moved to Sweden I left that cookbook behind.  I found the recipe here and have been using it since.  Buttermilk isn't available here so I use milk and vinegar or a swedish dairy product called fil.  I use to keep instant coffee just for the recipe but I started drinking coffee so I use normal coffee now.

This is THE best cake ever!  I found it in my Grandma's recipes after she passed away and then made it for years until I misplaced it.  I searched  and found this site.  Was happy to read all the great reviews as this is exactly how I felt about it...so moist and rich in color.  Finding it here was like finding a long lost friend!  Thank you!!!

This was PHENOMENAL! The only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of skim milk and a tablespoon of vinegar for the buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand. This cake was moist, and tasted like it was right out of the box, only without the chemicals and mystery ingredients. It wasn't dry and crumbly like a lot of homemade cakes. I baked 2 nine inch layers, put vanilla buttercream in the middle and on top, and then topped with a chocolate ganache. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making this again!

This cake was fast and easy. Wonderful!!! I did not have buttermilk so I used regular milk, 1 cup, and 1 TSP of lemon juice. Also, I used espresso instead of reg. coffee. It came out just beautiful and moist.

OMG!  Wonderful!   What I did, since it was my hubby's b-day, is I made two fillings, one coconut flavored which I made up, and this one http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Ganache/Detail.aspx which I also used as topping. Let just say - DUDE!  lol!  It tasted just like Petit Gâteau! We all loved it, and it was gone in a jiffy.

This is Definately the best chocolate cake I've made! I got great reveiws from the party, as well! However, I did substitute water for the coffee, and since I'm at high altitude, I altered the recipe a smidge. The first time I made it, i put it in the normal pans, and it was very difficult to get out. However, the second time I did it, I put it in a spring pan, and it didnt crumble. The cake was amazing altogether! So moist, and lucsious! I did find the icing a bit difficult to spread because its so soft, but I took that to mean a good thing (?). Overall, I will be making this cake a go-to whenever in need!  Thanks for submitting it!!!

I baked this for a friends birthday last night and it turned out amazing. I made a  chocolate butter-cream icing, dusted it with cocoa powder and pressed grated semi-sweet chocolate around the sides. It was incredible! Especially if you stick you piece in the microwave for 10 sec before eating it....

Very good cake recipe - but very thin batter!!!  I placed both round pans on the rack in my oven, where the convection fan proceeded to blow each cake to on side.  Next time I will just back without convection!!! Made it for a dinner party and topped with a white frosting and everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing!!

This might be the best chocolate cake I've made. Followed recipe exactly.  Took 38 minutes in a 9 x 13.  As another reviewer stated, it has the texture of  a regular 'birthday cake' but a deep rich chocolate flavor. I used the cake instead of a Devil's food as the base for a "Better than Sex" cake and it's delicious but I'm already looking forward to making it as a frosted layer cake or with a simple glaze.

Whoa, this cake is intense. It's extremely moist, make sure you have a tall glass of ice cold milk at the ready! This cake like the combination of a sugary kids-birthday-cake-cake and a dense french chocolate cake, it has the texture of the kids cake but the rich dark flavor of the french cake, which is just what I was looking for. Definitely worth a try! Something worth noting: the final product doesn't have any distinct coffee flavor, so if you want more delicious bitterness I suggest adding a bit extra coffee or throwing in some instant coffee.

So moist and so chocolatey!!!  This was a hit!  I used 2-9 in cake pans and it only took 30 minutes to bake.  I greased the pans really well and they were still really hard to take out of the pan.

Excellent!  Super easy to make with a wonderful result, this was a great choice for my brother in law's birthday cake over the weekend.  Iced with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it was well loved by the whole family.  Great flavour and a nice moist chocolate cake!  I did reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup (used 1 1/2 cups) and it was fantastic!

I made this at sort of the last minute for my son's birthday.  I used Creamy Chocolate Frosting with it.  I was more than a little nervous about how thin the batter was, but everything turned out perfect.  I didn't have any trouble with sticking or anything.  They did try to crack down the middle when I was handling them, but nobody knew or cared once the frosting was on and the milk was poured.  In fact, I just bought the stuff to make it again last night.  I'm going to get fat and love it!

This cake was fine, but is not very interesting in itself. It became much improved after I soaked it with blackcurrant liqueur (Creme de Cassis) mixed with some water and sugar. I also made a frosting out of butter, sugar (powdered would've been better, but I ran out), a bit of milk, and some of the same liqueur. I would give the overall result 5 stars, but I'm only giving the original cake recipe 4.

This cake was SO moist. I used a fudge frosting, and for the center filling, I mixed some pumpkin butter with the frosting. It was delicious!  
The only problem was that a greased and floured the heck out of my pans and still a large portion of the cake got stuck. It ended up turning out ok in the end.

Made this cake for my son's birthday, it was spectacular!  Best chocolate cake I've had in a long, long time.  It was nice and moist, cooked evenly, and held it's shape well.  I used the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe on this site submitted by T Larsen (perfect).  This cake is HEAVENLY!!!  Thanks a bunch!!  I'm planning to pass this recipe on to all important family members!

very delicious and easy to make!  everything a chocolate cake should be, light, moist, chocolatey: its hard to mess this up!  I had no problem with sticking, I used 2- 9" non stick pans coated with PAM for baking.  filled with Whipped Cream filling from this site and iced with a whipped chocolate ganache.

This cake is incredibly moist and delicious!!!  I will NEVER go with another chocolate cake recipe.  The second time I made the recipe I added about 1/8 - 1/4 cup more cocoa to intensify the chocolate flavor (the chocolate flavor was a bit too subtle the first time we tried it, perhaps competing with the coffee flavor).  Yum, yum, yum.

Great texture, but missed the extra chocolatey taste, which would have come with some chocolate in there.
I topped with cherrys and cream rosetts

Super moist, very dense & delicious.  You can't really taste the coffee but it adds depth to the flavor. I found my cookies took about 9.5 to 10 min each sheet.

I followed this recipe as written and got a beautiful cake out of it.  The only thing that was different I think, is that I used a strong chicory coffee as that was what I had on hand.  I made a 2 layer, with a chocolate custard filling and a ganache poured over.

I've always had a different chocolate cake recipe that I was so satisfied with. For a change I decided to try this recipe, but deep inside I knew it wouldn't be as good as the one I make. I was definitely proven wrong. This is excellent. If you're craving for a real chocolate cake. This is the recipe for you..

This cake is awesome!!  It is so fluffy and keeps well for a couple days.  I put vanilla store-bought frosting on top, then added fresh raspberries.  It was so good!  Tasted like it was from a bakery.

This is soooo good! I do agree with the others- make sure to coat the pan well!!! I used two 9" pans and made it with the coffee cinnamon icing on this site.
It is super moist. I made this the night before a party and it was still outstanding the next day!

Oh this was delicious. Wonder how I did not review this earlier. Made a car cake out of it for my son. Was tough cause the cake was so soft. Always cover and keep in the fridge as it will lose its softness if not.

This is one of the only chocolate cakes that would be AMAZING on it's own without icing.  I actually think icing takes away from the cake.  Sooooo yummy!

I love this cake.  It reminds me a black forest cake without the cherries.

This cake is so easy to make and so yummy.  It's been a big hit with the whole family and with me.

If you come across this recipe in your search for chocolate cake, this is definitely one to try.

This is my favorite chocolate cake!  I make fresh espresso for the coffee.  This recipe is so easy and delicious.  Like many other, I frost it with Cinnamon Coffee frosting.

It does have good flavor and is moist.  As others have mentioned it is rather spongy.  Overall I liked it.  I used the Coffee Cinnamon Frosting as has been mentioned.

This turned out wonderfully.  I used 2  9-inch round pans and frosted with coconut icing.  It was light, and a little spongey.  No more chocolate cake from mixes for me! :-)

This is truly the best chocolate cake that I have ever had; can't believe it took me so long to try this recipe!! Many, many years ago I had a piece of chocolate cake that was called 100 year old cake (have no idea why), and I have always wanted to duplicate that recipe because up until today, it was the most delicious chocolate cake I'd ever eaten. Well, this recipe makes a cake that tastes just like the one I remember from from well over 25 years ago! Fantastic recipe! Thank you so much!!

Made this into cupcakes.  Really moist and good color and texture.  Could be more chocolatey, but then again, almost everything can be for me! Will make again.

This cake is truly awesome!  My husband considers chocolate cake his favorite dessert, and he LOVES this one.  First time I have ever added coffee!  You do not taste the coffee, but it imparts a deep, rich flavor. (No changes were made to the recipe.) It is very moist - even 4 days later. I topped it with our favorite dark chocolate frosting which I have used for over 40 years.  There is just the 2 of us at home now, and the cake is disappearring rapidly for an older couple!  Thanks, Marsha, for a fabulous recipe.

As some others have said, this cake was even better the next day! Though, it didn't stop my kids from trying right after it was cooled;)It was very moist, even a few days later, and that was with the foil not covering it all the way (couldn't keep up with all the hands getting into the pan and not putting the foil abck right). I had no frosting on it, and didn't try the frosting recipe included, but the cake itself was very yummy and will be made many times over, I am sure!

I would have given this cake 5 stars as it tasted awesome and was really moist and delicious, but the center never rose and the entire thing fell once I took it out of the oven. It tasted great, but looked terrible and broke apart when I took it out of the pans. I used the Coffee Cinnamon Frosting recipe to top this, and it was really good that way, but it just looked terrible. I'd like to make this again since it was definitely the best chocolate cake I've ever had, but I'm not sure if it'll work for me.

This is without a doubt one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made or eaten.  It's dark, moist, and delicious.  I highly recommend it, and I expect I will be making it often in the future.

This recipe = FABULOUS!!!  I just made it for my sister's birthday.  It was dark, rich, and oh so moist!  The batter was thin, as noted, but I had absolutely no issues with it rising improperly or falling afterwards.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp. of pure almond extract, along with the vanilla extract.  I also iced with cream cheese frosting, but seriously, any flavor frosting would taste great on this cake.

This was a huge hit. I made it with chocolate cream cheese frosting and added a layer of fresh strawberries in the middle to give it a little lightness. The friend I made it for doesn't even like cake (I didn't know this before hand) and she loved it. Definetly a keeper.

This is a fabulous cake!! I made it for a friend's birthday and received a lot of compliments. I suggest pairing it with chocolate cream cheese frosting posted on this site, but really it's great on it's own as a snacking cake.
