Excellent! I've never made borscht before but this was great! I substituted chicken breasts for the chicken thighs and then shredded them.

This was delicious.  It was hearty and aesthetically looked great too. I modified a few things- I used bagged cole slaw for the cabbage and used beets I had prepped & frozen previously, which sped up the process.  I also substituted red wine for the red wine vinegar.  This soup has a delicious flavor!  Even my husband, the self proclaimed non-vegetable eater, went back for seconds!

Yes agree on the Dill the original recipe I submitted had a spoonful of sour cream and a sprinkle of dill to finish in the bowl. Allrecipes left it out for some reason.

Very close to traditional ukrainian recipes. Borsch is so much more than just boiled beets! I would add *dill*

This was an excellent recipe. It was my first time making Borscht with my sister since I got back from a Russian trip this last summer. We tried Chicken rather than pork for something different. Other than what is in this recipe we changed Bay Leaf for some dill weed and parsley. We also added a teaspoon of sugar for a little extra flavoring. We also had about a teaspoon of pepper and salt. It turned out really good. I would definitely use this recipe again. Also to finish it off we topped it with sour cream for a final dish to serve. It will be a great dish for our New Years celebration tomorrow.

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was using canned beets, (it's what I had) and not adding chicken. Everything else was just as written, and boy was it AWESOME. My husband absolutely loved it. Big hit! Thankyou for the recipe!

Great way to use low cost chicken thighs.  Really tasty mix and divine with just a little lowfat sour cream on top.  Did increase the garlic and used 2 cup vegetable stock with water to boil the chicken, which gave enough flavor without the added salt, but that was the only adjustment.  Will do this again - a great way to use fresh beets.
