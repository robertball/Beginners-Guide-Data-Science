I will state, this isn't so much a "cake" in the traditional bready sense, more like a hard set multi-grain custard with raisins in it and a bottom crust like a bar/pie.  We really didn't care for the texture of it because of the egg/milk base and the jumble of banana vs apple vs spices together. The extra addition of yogurt and honey does make this better, but it wasn't for us.
