This recipe was a huge hit! I served it with reduced fat vanilla ice cream.. and everyone loved it! It's not as rich as regular pumpkin pie, but it was lighter and nicer.. I didn't feel so heavy after eating it.

My boyfriend loves pumpkin pie and I am always trying to find healthier substitutes.  This was the perfect solution.  It was light fluffy and didn't make it through the night between the two of us.

I've made this pie several times between last fall and now for everything from a family dinner to girls' night to a special surprise for my coworkers. I've even made one for my boyfriend to take with him when he hangs out with the boys. Each and every time, the pie disappears within minutes, and the response has been nothing short of, "This is amazing!" I actually don't follow this recipe completely; I have zero regard for the measurements of the spices. I use a LOT of cinnamon, and sometimes I've been guilty of cheating and using McCormick's "Pumpkin Spice Blend" instead of the other individual spices. I give a healthy dusting of spices to the top of the pie before putting it in the oven, to bring out more flavour.

Great lower-fat recipe alternative. I did use two whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites and used 2 1/2 tsp of Spice Islands Pumpkin Pie spice blend instead of the individually listed spices. I also used the reduced fat Keebler graham cracker crust. Huge hit with the hubby! Will definitely make this again.

I give this 5 stars!  It is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made.  Even after 2 days, it is firm...not moist and runny like some of the other pumpkin pies I have made.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Highly recommend it to anyone....especially if there is a desire to cut down on the use of fat.

Swigdor is right, it's delicious, and it has lower fat! I must have had 5 pieces last time I made it!

This pie was okay... I enjoyed it, but next time I'd look for a different recipe.
