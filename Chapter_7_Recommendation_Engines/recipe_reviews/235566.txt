I have made this at least a dozen times since the video was published on youtube several years ago.  As written it is 5 stars. I have since done a few things to add to the flavor and learn from my mistakes.  I do not have a Dutch oven but a large roasting pan with lid works fine.  The first time I made it I had 2 pork butts weighing in at 15 lbs total (cooks in twelve hours no matter what size butts you have).  Just remember that the more you make the more fat will leak to the bottom of your vessel.  I had so much fat that first time that it flooded the ramekins.  I now set the butt and ramekins on a mesh stand that sits perfectly inside my roaster â€“ about an inch high (you can easily make one with heavy duty chicken wire).  I cut the top off of a small to medium sized onion and the tops off of a small bulb of garlic and sit them on the stand which permeates the meat and adds a nice pungency to the flavor and aroma.  Several people have told me that this is the best pulled pork they have ever had, without knowing that it had not been properly 'smoked'.  I chop it very rough and remove most of the fat so that the pork speaks for itself.  This pork is so juicy and tender it is surreal.

Oh my gosh.  The absolute bomb!  I can't believe I set my alarm on a Saturday morning to put this in the oven.  I am so glad I did.  This meat is to die for.  I mean really!  It isn't about the rub or the sauce.  It is about how the meat comes out.  I didn't have a bbq dry rub so I used one I found on the Food Network...Bobbie Flay I think.  1 tablespoon each of cumin, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, chili powder and brown sugar; 2 tablespoons kosher salt; and 1 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, white pepper and black pepper.  I used about a 1/4 of the batch.   I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  I can't rave enough about how good this was.

Okay - so is this the best I've ever had?  No. Is it WAY up there?  Yes!!!  Much better than any in a slow cooker I've ever done. I made this and popped some in the crockpot anyway, just in case, as my husband was returning from a long trip & requested my pulled pork, as he was overseas & no pork products for a month.   I decided to step it up a little & try this. Let it suffice to say the other is still in the crockpot in the fridge. I made it EXACTLY as outlined.  He was happy, and grateful that I tried this new and better incarnation.  I used a rub from Sandfly BBQ in Savannah and Johnny Harris BBQ sauce, on homemade bread.  Wonderful.

This is a great recipe.  I have made pulled pork in my crock pot and it has never been as tender as this method.  I purchased a 4.5lb pork shoulder, seasoned the meat (mustard covered by a dry rub)for 5 hours, sliced 2 medium onions, lined my dutch oven with the onions, added 1 ramekin with water and then put it in the oven for 12 hours at 225F.

This was my first time making pulled pork and I won't ever bother looking for a different recipe. This is one of those wonderful recipes that you don't forget.  Our next door neighbor is a smokehouse bbq restaurant whose bbq is some of the best in the state and we liked this pulled pork better than his!  I followed Chef John's directions closely.  I used the same ingredients for the rub and sauce that "poshlynne" listed in her review (review #4) - thank you poshlynne!!! I think Chef John's technique with the smoke flavor and poshlynne's spice rub were both key to the success of the recipe.  Try it! You'll LOVE it!

I had a 7 lb bone-in pork butt.  I followed the recipe above, adding the onion to the bottom of the dutch oven after reading the reviews.  The rub I used was BBQ 3000 from Penzeys.  I put this in the oven at 9:00pm and it was done at 8:00am.  Yes, we woke up to the aroma of cooked pork.  I'm serving this at our July 4th party.  Having the meat made ahead of time was perfect for my sanity!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Chef John!

Oh my goodness!! You will never go back to crock-pot pulled pork after this!  We used "Butt Rub" that we picked up in a specialty shop, but I think it is the liquid smoke that makes the difference.  So, so simple but it tastes delicious.  I served it with sauteed cabbage instead of the traditional slaw.  Used a gigantic pork butt so we have plenty to freeze for another time.

This is a decent recipe, but I brushed on a bit more liquid smoke, then  rubbed on my own rub. But, having said that, I much prefer using my 7 qt. slow cooker. 

I put the pork in the crock, brush on the liquid smoke, then rub on my rub. Next I add two 12oz bottles of good ginger ale, and a 3" piece of fresh ginger, roughly chopped. Stout also works well. 

Now, It takes a good long time to get that huge piece of pork hot all the way through and if you didn't cook it on Low for at least 10 hours if room temp, and at least  12 hours  if right from the fridge, it will not be tender. I've done so many of these I can probably  do it in my sleep, and I've never had one that didn't fall to pieces when I tried to get it out of the crock. You can't get any more tender than that.

Followed recipe to the tee. I was waiting to smell at some point, a smoky scent. Fast forward the 12 hrs. It's a tender, moist pork roast. There is nothing that resembles a smoked pulled pork. The BBQ sauce in my opinion is the only thing that takes this to something other than a roasted pork dish. I will stick to the smoker should I desire pulled pork. Basically same ingredients & same amount of time. End results are galaxies away.

I was skeptical about making this as Chef John's recipe only called for 3-1/2 lb  shoulder. I had a big 7 lb'er. Thank goodness for reviews! When another said that it didn't matter the size, she was absolutely right! Another that said that the fat level would rise and overtook her liquid smoke and water, yes! Not sure how to overcome that...BUT! My husband is the smoker in the family and didn't expect much. He was totally impressed, as were all my guests!  Moist, juicy, delicious! Will definitely be making this again!

I was given sizeable chunk of smoked pork left over from a picnic.  Since it would need to be reheated anyway I decided to try this recipe. Since it was previously smoked I omitted that part.  Gave it a generous rub and wrapped it in foil to reheat and bake at 350Â° for about 2-1/2 hrs. Followed remaining recipe directions. It was amazing. Everyone that tried it loved it.

Made this for a party!  Definitely a better alternative than the slow cooker!  We roasted 6 lbs of pork shoulder for 12 hours at 210 degrees, used the ramekins with added Smoke and water.  The pork temperature was 195-200 F at the end of cooking and was moist and delicious!  Shredded the pork, added it to a slow cooker with Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce at low heat and served it with mini potato buns!  It got rave reviews!

Fantastic Pulled Pork!  My wife and I loved it, the only change was to use our slow cooker.  We will definitely make this again, and again...!

I used a 9# Pork shoulder roast and made this pretty true to recipe, except for cooking it an extra hour. I did put the roast on a 1.5" raised rack (actually I improvised with a jalapeno grill rack) in a roasting pan, and that kept it from swimming in its fat.  I think not allowing it to absorb all that grease is important to the quality.  I also put half an onion and a couple of cloves of garlic underneath the rack to instill more aroma to permeate the meat while cooking. Ended up with about 5 pounds of meat. I used sweet Baby Ray's honey chipotle BBQ sauce - that was a little on the sweet side so I added a couple of Tbs. of vinegar and some more liquid smoke - tasted perfect. Served with coleslaw and baked beans.

Great video for the tips! I have disposable gloves and cleaver that I finally used.  It was perfect for the job.  The technique for the liquid smoke is the best.  No nasty aftertaste when you do it this way!

This is my fave recipe for pulled pork... I used a pork tenderloin and cooked at 195Â° for 12hrs. Used my ma-inlaw's rub and my own BBQ sauce. This is so succulent...

This is excellent and SOOO easy!  I made a TON of it. Three 15 lb. pork shoulders to feed a football team. Each cooked to about 10 lbs. I used the Butt Rub from Costco and followed the recipe and they all turned out fantastic! I have to say, I cooked two on racks in the roasting pan and one was not (I didnt have enough room in the oven so had to take one off). The one that was sitting in the juices and fat was MUCH more tender and shredded. The ones on the rack were also very tender but I had to chop each into small pieces, they did not shred. I think I would not use a rack next time as it was easier to cut up and they both were delicious. I use a bottled BBQ sauce (Kraft Spicy Honey is a favorite ) and add Worcestershire,  sriracha and vinegar. AMAZING! Get rave reviews!

Fantastic! Family loved it! I used a 4.5 lb. roast, cut off the excess fat. I didn't have a rub on hand and couldn't choose from the many at the grocer so I made one using this recipe I found on another review from this recipe. It is as follows: 
from Bobbie Flay I think. 1 tablespoon each of cumin, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, chili powder and brown sugar; 2 tablespoons kosher salt; and 1 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, white pepper and black pepper. I used about a 1/3 of the batch and coated the roast generously on all sides. Set is directly on bottom of my dutch oven with room for only one ramekin of water and liquid smoke. I took it out after 11 hours and it was ready. Absolutely delicious. Had the Sweet Baby Rays out but no one felt it needed any. I will make this again and again. My husband felt it was a bit too salty so will cut down the salt in the rub next time .

If I could give this ten stars I would! It's the most delicious BBQ pulled pork I've ever made and ever eaten. 
Use the rub suggested by poshlynn in the review section of this recipe. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I used a dry BBQ rub I found off this site and I would HIGHLY recommend using the BBQ sauce from Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Ribs also from this site. My husband and I both loved it, I only wish I could give it more stars :)

I made this for a party this weekend - so good! I've done slow cooker pulled pork but this wins on convenience (put it in the oven and forget it!) and the taste is amazing! Another winner from Chef John!

What can I add only to say this was the tastiest and tender pork butt I have ever made and for that matter one on the best I have ever eaten anywhere. While 12 hours is a long cook it is well worth the effort. Thankfully my oven has a delay start. I prepared the butt the night before and placed it in the oven when I went to bed and programmed the oven to come on at 2 AM at 210 degrees, at 2 in the afternoon I opened my cast iron dutch oven and was greeted with a delightful sight and smell. I pulled on the blade bone and it came right out. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe, 12 hours and it's done. No fuss, no muss. I used a very heavy salt rub on the outside and may work on more of a "plan" for  a dry rub, but overall the taste and moistness was perfect! The "smoke" insinuated itself into the meat and didn't overwhelm the flavor. Instead of "pulling" the pork, I chopped it as suggested and it was buttery soft and delectable not tough or stringy, much better than the crock pot recipes we've used before, plus easier to clean up. This IS a keeper!

Oh my goodness!!!!!!! This is pure deliciousness!!!! I used poshlynne's dry rub (from the reviews) applied the night before. The only thing I might suggest is more salt......  anyway lined my Dutch oven with sliced onion and garlic cloves.  I didn't have room for a ramekin for the liquid smoke so I just added it to the pan with about half a cup of water.  Baked at 210 for 8 hours and I was a little nervous on how tender it would be so I raised the temp to 300 for the last 4 hours. Pulled it out of the oven and it was pure pork heaven!!!!!  I added more of the dry rub as I shredded the pork (actually it just fell apart) and some extra salt.   Served it with freshly made coleslaw, no bagged mix!!! Also cheddar cornbread and it's pure heaven!!!!! Thank you once again Chef John, your recipes absolutely ROCK!!!!!!!

Fabulous, fabulous! Made rub from Poshlynne review...excellent.  Used 2 roasts, so had to use  my blue roasting pan and put double aluminum foil around pan...worked well since you don't have to check on roast. Also used heavy duty small coffee cups for ramekins.  Put in oven at 9:00 pm & in morning when done and fat removed, I used Sweet  Baby Rays Hickory & Brown Sugar & and the Sweet &  Spicy BBQ sauces &  blended meat & sauces together. Reheated at dinner before serving on buns. Company raved.  4# roast filled 8 buns generously.

This was an amazingly excellent pulled pork recipe. I used a slightly bigger roast & it was still done in 12 hrs. The hardest part was getting up at 5:30 am to put it in the oven! Will Definitely make this again!

I made this today with a 9 lb pork shoulder.  I seasoned the meat last night with a not too spicy rub concoction I found on the internet and refrigerated it.  At 3am I put the meat into my Lodge 7 qt dutch oven  (along with the liquid smoke ramekins).  At 3pm I checked it and it was ready to eat.  I left it in the oven until 4pm because we weren't eating until 4:30pm and it didn't 'overcook'.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with it and it was wonderful.  This was my first time making and eating pulled pork.  I made a copycat KFC coleslaw to have with it.   

I have a lot of leftovers which I'll freeze for another time.  This was a very economical meal.  The shoulder was only .99/lb "this week".  I live in the Greater Boston Area.   I should probably grab another one soon and freeze it.  

My only problem with this recipe is the 12 hour cooking time.  I'm not an early morning person.  I'm wondering if this could cook from 10pm thru 10am and be reheated in the afternoon for dinner.

Chef John to the rescue! I needed to feed a bunch of people cheaply. My grocer sells Boston Butt  dirt cheap a couple of times a year so I had one in the freezer. I used the spice rub in Chef John's parchment  pork recipe, and put this on a rack  in a turkey sized clay pot with little containers of smoke on the sides.  The next morning, I had some pretty stellar stuff. 

I made a couple of sauces including CJ's very spicy North Carolina Sauce, and made a double recipe of his hamburger buns. Added fresh corn on the cob, and a basic coleslaw. Made  strawberry shortcake for dessert and ended up feeding people for less than $4.00 per person and they were all very happy.

Very good recipe for oven pulled pork! I did not have a lot of smoke flavor, but the meat was perfect! Try rub Was the way to go.
I have to say, I served this dry with different types of BBQ sauce and it was a fantastic hit!

This is a great recipe and you can add different things to add flavor. It's hard to mess up a pork butt for pulled pork long as it's cooked low and slow. I have even put it in a heavy pan covered well in heavy duty foil. One tricked I have used is to inject some liquid smoke into the meat before roasting but be careful and follow directions for the liquid smoke and not over do it. I never chop pulled pork. Pulling it apart with two forks has always worked great for me. I noticed in one review Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce was used. It is good sauce but I'm parcel to Stubbs marinade and BBQ sauce but for liquid smoke I love the Wright's brand which is becoming harder to find in my area (NW Ga.) so now I have to get it form Amazon or another on line source.

I made this the first few times in a crockpot because it was easier.  I thought it was good.  Today I decided to make in a dutch oven.  Oh my goodness -- I had no idea this recipe could be even that much better.  The meat fell off the bone.  I cannot say enough good about this, and I can hardly wait for leftovers in my lunch tomorrow.

Made exactly as written, except I only used one ramekin of liquid smoke; my pot was not large enough for two. I used Traci's Adobo Seasonings from this site for the rub. Yummy

Simple and so delicious!  The meat was so tender, it fell off the bone.  It made the house smell amazing.  Saying "goodbye!" to our previous slow cooker pulled pork BBQ recipe!  This is our new go-to!

I made this over the weekend and it was so easy and so good.  The entire family loved it!!  I didn't have rub so I used the recipe I found in one of the reviews here. 1 tablespoon each of cumin, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, chili powder and brown sugar; 2 tablespoons kosher salt; and 1 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, white pepper and black pepper. I used about a 1/4 of the batch.   I followed the directions on everything else and I will be making this again!!

Very good and it's super simple! I will make it again. I had to add a lot of salt afterwards. Next time, I will rub the shoulder with salt prior to the rub and let it soak it in prior to cooking. It was great without sauce.

This turned out beautifully.  I love that it let me control the texture of the finished product. I had to reheat it a bit before serving and I chose to lay it out on a foil lined baking sheet and place under the broiler just long enough to heat and crisp the sauce up slightly.  This will be fun to experiment with different sauces until we find our favorite.  It's a keeper.

I've made this twice (with Chef John's Rub recipe) and it is the most delicious ever!!! My 11 year old son had two pulled pork sandwiches, and he said they were delicious!! I make my own BBQ sauce to go with this, and homemade coleslaw... take the time to cook the pork for 12 hours; you won't be sorry!!!

p.s. - I added at least double of the liquid smoke to one ramekin...

I made this recipe,  I used 2 roasters w 2- 8.5lb pork butt roasts. I dry rubbed them & placed in refrigerator overnight. I set on racks but were low racks I read some reviews talking about high racks with layering onions  so I scattered onions on & around. in 1 roaster I was able to put an oven proof dish w liquid smoke & water. the other I put water & liquid smoke around roasts. cover w lids placed in 225Â° oven overnight for 12hrs. I read reviews about all the "liquid and fat", well I'm wondering what happened? see photo. the roast both registered 220Â° insta-read thermometer. I thought great dried out. the roast w dish of liquid smoke the pan was burned (ruined?)the 1 w  liquid added to pan had maybe doubled the liquid?....I removed roasts as they fell apart  and shredded them taking little samples...the roast were so moist tender & flavorful...I used sweet baby Ray's bbq sauce to just wet some of it and let people add to their sandwiches I've gotten rave reviews on the roast. * the one in burnt pan wasn't burnt or dried out I combined w other pulled roast cant tell the difference! will make again, just wont use dish.
side not pan came clean w 2 rounds of heavy baking soda a plastic scraper & lots of elbow grease

Taste delicious. I feed a total of 8 adults and we all agreed this was one of the best pulled pork BBQs we have had.  Used an equal mix of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and their regular BBQ.

Made this again on 12/14/19 for a crowd of 100 and received a lot of complements.  I use Bad Byron's Butt Rub and put a generous amount on all sides in step 2; and ends up being more then what the recipe calls for.

We dropped the temp to 200 and let it cook about 2 hours longer. It was very flavorful and moist. I left the BBQ sauces for the guests to add on their own since it was for a kids party.

My husband declared this the best barbecue I've ever made (almost restaurant quality!).  He thought the taste and texture were miles ahead of the slow cooker barbecue I usually make. The smokiness was very subtle--not as much as I expected--though I probably shouldn't have expected much without a real smoker. Like I others, I used the rub recommended by Poshlynne, but I think other BBQ rubs would have worked just as well.  After draining the liquid and skimming off the fat, I had almost 2 cups of liquid, which can be used as a broth in other recipes.

It was very good, but the amount of work, considering leaving oven on all night, it was good, I had to cook my in a big roaster with lid, also purchase the ramekins, as I did not have them, never used them before,  I also added some onion & fresh garlic to the pan,  as per many reviews I read, cooking the pork in a rack above  the juices. I also followed many others here and prepared my own BBQ rub,  Once it was done, I shredded the meat & put it in my crockpot, as I was bringing  it to a family gathering, it was better once it set in the warmer with some BBQ sauce & I also added some of the juice from the roasting pan, so  the meat would not be too dry....but my family, still prefers  the one I make in my crockpot better.

Hands down, this is the easiest pulled pork recipe and best tasting that Iâ€™ve ever made. I used another dry rub recipe from AR that worked well. I cooked 30 lbs of pork butt overnight using this, one in oven with cast iron roaster, one with an AllClad slow cooker, and one using Instant Pot slow cooker option. The very best result was using the oven and roaster/Dutch oven as described in recipe. Pork fell apart in my hands, similar to the video. Cooking was consistent throughout. I was surprised! From now on, Iâ€™m reevaluating using slow cook method in oven rather than my slow cooker.

This pork is so tender, juicy and delicious that I am deleting all other pulled pork recipes I have saved. This one tops them all...absolutely delicious!

An okay recipe for essentially just baking in the oven.  But, nothing replaces actually using a real smoker.  I would say increase the liquid smoke to one teaspoon each ramekin instead of half teaspoon.  Otherwise that smokey flavor just isnâ€™t there.

Love the liquid smoke... It did the trick! 

Pork fell right off the bone. 

So good!

I squeezed a 15 lb. shoulder butt, rubbed with Flay's recipe, into my dutch oven. I elevated the roast about 1/2 in. with onion slices and the ramekins. I spilled a little of the water from the ramekins when I put the pot in the oven, but wondered if that is all the moisture I would need because the pot seemed so dry! Ten hours later, there was 4 cups of broth that I defatted  and chilled, then added about 1 cup of the jellied broth back into the meat along with a bottle of Trader Joe's Kansas City barbeque sauce. I broke up larger chunks of meat with my fingers, and reheated in a skillet; but by the time it was stirred and hot, most of the chunks were in fine shreds. I set out cheap white hamburger buns, more bbq sauce, and coleslaw. Enjoyed by all.

Turned out a really nice, moist pork roast, but not really the same as pulled port from a legit smoker.  Mine didn't really have any smoke flavor to speak of, but maybe that's because all of the liquid that was standing in my dutch oven and even overflowed the ramekin.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the pot to find about 2+ inches of standing fat/drippings.  I was basically braising at that point and so didn't get any nice bark either.  I did a 6+ lb shoulder and since it was my first time with this method, thought I'd check on things at ~10.5 hours and I am glad I did.  Internal temp was at almost 210 already and pork was fully cooked.  The meat was super tender and pulled/shredded really nicely, but not a ton of flavor.  The rub I used was called Memphis Dust from a recipe found online.  It's hard to judge the rub since there was so much liquid that I didn't get a good crust at all, but I know I won't use smoked Spanish paprika in my rubs anymore.  Has a very unique and strong flavor that stood out against all the other rub ingredients.  I'll probably give this another try, but next time elevating the roast a bit more to keep it out of all the liquid.

My previous pulled pork recipe was palatable but way too simple in the flavors and too sweet. This one is a home run!  I was looking for a dry rub pulled pork recipe to make for my niece for her birthday. Since a trip to Memphis made her into quite a  connoisseur of BBQ I was up for a bit of a challenge but this was almost too easy!!  Simplicity aside, I made it with no changes and it was literally, the hit of the party!

This is an easy recipe and the addition of the ramakin with liquid smoke really accentuates the flavor. I was looking for a different technique and this will be my go to method. Thanks Chef John!

It is not the weight of the roast that matters it is the circumference that determines how long you slow cook your Butt.  I just did a 15 1/2 lbs shoulder and it took 16 hrs. only because it was so tall.  I took it out when it reached that magic number of 203 degrees internal.  Great recipe CJ.  Keep them coming.

I am a fan of Chef John, and so wanted to love the idea of making pulled pork using liquid smoke instead of a smoker.
I followed the instructions except for the fact that my Dutch Oven only allowed for room for one 6" ramekin with a 5.5 lb pork shoulder roast, so I put all required water (almost) and liquid smoke in one ramekin instead of two.  I also added one onion quartered, and a head of garlic with the tops cut off to the dutch oven.
The meat was incredibly tender, but I have to agree with some of the less than positive posts; it just didn't have the flavor I hoped for.  No smoke flavor came through.  It just tasted like a tender pork sandwich,

Used  7.5lb butt. Made it exactly as directed. Put it on at 9pm and it was cooked,shredded and ready for game time. Nothing but compliments! I added the BBQ sauce slowly so as not to put in too much. Thanks

Made it several times and it's always a hit. So easy just leave it in oven overnight and voila it done in the morning! So flavorful and moist but good on its own so I serve the BBQ sauce on the side.

This is the only pulled pork recipe I ever use any more. I make it every 2 months or so. It is so easy--it's prepped in about 5 min and I bake all night--it's about the most hands off main dish I ever make. I make up a double batch of rub from the Everything Dry Pork Rub recipe on this site, so I always have it on hand. Try this and you will be sold!!

This is the first time I have made pulled pork.  It was fantastic and so easy.  I did add a sliced Vidalia onion to the bottom of the pan and a head of garlic with the top cut off.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband said I can make this anytime!

This recipe sent me down a path to greatness, thank you.  I did make a couple changes that I had read in other recipes and I think it came out stellar.  I preheated my oven to 230 because I only had 8 hours to let it cook.  I used my big cast iron Lodge Dutch Oven, poured in a couple tablespoons of avocado  oil and got it nice and hot, I seared all sides of my dry rubbed meat (turbinado sugar, kosher salt, black pepper,  fie in the hole powder and a little Carolina Reaper powder I made from one of my pepper bushes).  After it was nicely seared I put the meat aside and sautÃ©ed a chopped up yellow onion in all the juice and goodness on the bottom.  I put the meat on top, added the ramekins with liquid smoke in, covered it, put it in the oven and walked away.  It had a good 9 hours in, and fell apart as soon as I touched it.  I shredded it all up in a bowl, poured about half of the drippings in my Lodge back into the meat, mixed it all together and put it on cheap fluffy buns as prescribed in your video.  I slathered it with my favorite Everett & Jones Hot Q sauce (from Oakland, Ca it's the best in my humble opinion) and dug in to heaven.  Everyone else used the mild sauce.  My kid inhaled three because they were absolutely, flippin, insane goodness.  It's what's for dinner tonight and I'm looking forward to it, I might have one for lunch.

Made with a pork tenderloin in the crock pot as it is 100 degrees outside and didn't want to turn on the oven! Turned out great. Loved that it tasted alittle smokey, without actually being smoked! Tender and shredded easily. Hubby and kids loved it!

Made almost as written - but doubled.  Very good but after I added the BBQ sauce I couldn't tell anything other that it would have been just as good cooked in the slow cooker.  However, I did have double the meat so after I removed about half of it, we fried it like carnitas and had it for breakfast.    Loved the meat without the BBQ sauce

This turned out really well.  I didn't like the bbq sauce that I used because it made way to sweet for our taste, but that was not the recipes fault.  I did use Poshlynne"s bbq rub recipe that many of the other reviewers commented on and was really pleased how great it tasted on the pork.  This was an awesome way to fix bbq pork....many thanks to Chef John!!!!

i'm an Eastern NC style fan so I used a vinegar based sauce. When the meat is fall off the bone tender, the sauce just the dressing.

I made this as the recipe stated but used my own dry rub mixture which is similar to #4's recipe, and it was delicious!   It's the best home cooked pulled pork we've ever had.      It was moist, flavorful and my family gave it a 10.   Sure, the commercial smokers are different but this is the easiest meal for a crowd.  Just put it in the oven and forget it.

I made it in a slow-cooker instead of the oven.  I put the liquid smoke mixture in a small bowl in the slow-cooker.

Made it exactly as the recipe says using the dry rub recommended by others (onion powder, brown sugar, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, Kosher salt, cayenne, white and black pepper). I have a cast iron Dutch oven and cooked it overnight. I use the Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet Gold Mustard barbecue sauce as we like mustard base sauce. It was good.... it just wasn't the WOW that I was looking for. I've had the WOW before and I'm just going to have to hunt that hostess down and torture the recipe out of her!
UPDATE: I had to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars after my husband ate it... for breakfast. Smelling it cooking all night long did him in. He says it's the best BBQ I've ever made. He's a southern boy raised on this stuff so I'll have to go with his opinion. States the flavor is fantastic! Being a diabetic, he doesn't use extra sauce on his Q and I only put half the amount in it when mixing it.... just enough to keep it moist.

Excellent and simple recipe. We heavied up the liquid smoke a bit. Turned out so well we went to the store and bought two more roasts the next day for a main dish at a spring party. Don't forget the slaw!

Wow, moist and juicy. Didn't have liquid smoke. Used some beef broth in the bottom if the Dutch oven. We worth the pre-planning and time. Will never make pulled pork in my crock pot again!

This is the absolute BEST pulled pork recipe I've ever made. The only thing that I did not do was add the liquid smoke. I'm sure it would have been even better had I done that step. I had a 9.5lb and still cooked for 10 or so hours at 280* (I did not get up early enough for 12 hours). I did sear the outside of the roast in the dutch oven, then added about a cup of water, sliced up an onion, and put the roast on top, fat side down. I cannot express how delicious this was!!! I will never make pulled pork another way!!!

I used about 5 1/2 pound bone in pork shoulder.  It served about 12 with several sides to add to dinner.  It came out just as pictured and everyone really liked it.  Definitely will make again.

Outstanding! Love the liquid smoke. This is so much better in the dutch oven than recipes that call for a slow cooker. I recommend a very simple brown sugar based dry rub which will crystallize perfectly. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! I rarely ever leave reviews but plan on making this for a second time tonight for a BBQ tomorrow and can't wait! I figured I'd leave a review while I'm here because we enjoyed it so much ?? I doubled the recipe and followed all instructions exactly. I used the Bobbie Flay rub Poshlynne mentioned in her review and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce ???? Came out soooo good on sliders with a simple coleslaw on top. Make it, you won't regret it
