Had to buy more kale after I tried this recipe. I shift it up adding cranberries, grated zukes. Awesome!

This is the best kale salad! Can mix up the flavor a bit by using different cheeses, otherwise follow directions as they are written and it is delicious!

Sooo good!  I was tired of my usual kale salad recipe with cranberries and sunflower seeds.  This was a very welcome change.  I have been sharing it with all my family.

Fantastic recipe! I served it as a main course with a side of Italian bread and cheese. My grocery store didnâ€™t have shredded smoked cheese so I cut up a small block of habanero smoked white cheese and it was dandy. Everything else was exactly as listed. My husband and I both went back for seconds and will be finishing it up for lunch tomorrow. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Prior to this dish, I had only had kale baked in a strata or as a chip and had avoided it raw. Boy, was that a mistake! It's very hearty and satisfying. I thought the vinaigrette was delicious and the corn gave it a great burst of sweetness. I didn't add the eggs, only because I served this as a side to chicken but I'm sure if I did I could be satisfied eating this as a full entree. Thanks for the great recipe!

I LOVE this recipe. The basic dressing is the bomb. I skip the maple syrup just bc I love the zip of lemon juice. I added walnuts, craisins and herbed crumbled feta and I am not sharing. I don't use the 1/4 cup olive oil either. I use one bunch of curly kale chopped into smaller pieces and after I add a few turns of olive oil and massage the kale with salt it doesn't need anymore? Love it.

The kale was on its last legs and I had to find a recipe asap. I tried this one and it was so fantastic, even tho I substituted some of the ingredients. I'm gonna enjoy making different variations of this salad! Thanks very much for sharing.

I have tried this salad a few times when somehow kale wound up in my shopping. I didn't want to throw it out and didn't know how to prepare it. I got on my favorite food app and found this recipe. The dressing is amazing and I wasn't intimidated by kale any more! as I buy it on purpose now and use whatever veggies I have on hand! Thanks for sharing...

Loved this salad!  I added jicama just because I like it and had it on hand. This is a keeper.

The dressing for this salad is incredible. I've been making variants of this salad over and over again for months because it's so good and easy. I usually don't have all the other non-dressing ingredients but I've done it with pomegranate seeds, parmesan, chicken, and pine nuts and it's sooo good. Thank you!
