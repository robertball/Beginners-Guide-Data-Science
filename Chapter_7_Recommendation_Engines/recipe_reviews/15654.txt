This is a basic sponge cake recipe soaked in a milk mixture.  A succesful sponge cake requires proper treatment of the egg, at every step.   The egg whites form the body or lightness of the cake.  It is extremely important to properly fold the whites into the batter.  Too much folding and you have a flat cake.  Too little folding and you will have "chewy" pieces from unincorporated egg white.  The 1/4 c. granulated sugar should be added to the egg whites before whipping, as sugar helps build peaks, prevents overbeating, and dissolves in liquid egg.  I don't know why some reviewers thought white sugar meant powdered sugar, but sponge cakes are made with granulated sugar.  I substituted cake flour (1 c. + 2 T.), added a pinch of salt, and the cake was great.

Maybe I am the only cook that does not know this, but this recipe should call  for CONFECTIONOR'S SUGAR, not to be confused with granular sugar which is obviously white too--I am new to the cooking scene, but this info would have been nice to know.

I took this cake to a Cinco De Mayo party.  I looked at all the tres leches cake recipes on this website, and I decided to try this one.  I was not dissapointed.  Everyone raved about it.  I did substiture Fresh strawberries with the cherries, so it was like a super moist strawberry shortcake.  Even my kids loved the "strawberry cake"  My 2 yr old son actually ate his own piece, and then tried to steal mine. I definatly recommend this cake.  There is no excess run off of liquid like the others cakes listed on this web site.  Try it, you'll like it.

Soooooo good! Don't make the mistake of trying it before you chill it for at least a few hours. Room temperature milk is nasty and you will think this cake is too if you do so (i tried a piece right after frosting it, that's  how i know). I've done this cake twice and i decided to add some sugar and vanilla to the whipping cream the second time to give it more flavor. The second time i also didn't pierce the cake with a fork , i left it in the pan and poured the mixture on it and it soaked it up without any problems and more evenly. The cake came out fluffy and moist and i didn't want to stop eating it. I also liked it better when i separated it into two 8in pans and frosted it in between the two layers.

Awesome!  25 year old dude here...not really in to cooking but trying to learn...if i try something and like it, i'll go to this site and look it up and try to make it for my self.  A chick bought this cake in to work and I thought it was really good so I after reading the reviews of the others I decided to try this one.  Again, I dont know how to cook but I made this and it rocks!  I may have beat my eggs to long because I only had to cook it for 30 minutes, but again, it's awesome.  This one is my new recipe box!

This is great. However, I've always added the milk mixture (with 1 tsp vanilla added) as soon as the cake comes out of the oven. If your cake forms a "hump" just slice it off to level it, then pour the milk mixture all over.  The milk mixture distributes itself well when the cake is still hot. Let cool to room temp, then refrigerate still in the pan and covered with foil. I let it sit overnight. Once cold, just flip it onto a serving plate and garnish with whipped cream and fresh fruit. Deeelish!!

This is an excellent cake and a crowd pleaser (but some people didn't like how it's kind of soggy).  I suggest using yellow box cake mix - it tastes the same and its faster.

I had no problems with this recipe as others did with the cake collapsing.  I thought it was perfect.  Before icing the cake, I cut it in half and placed sliced strawberries between the layers, then soaked it in the milk mixture.  A bakery where I live adds the fruit in the middle and I think it is just delicious.  I will use this recipe again, thanks for another great one!

Although this cake takes a relatively long time to prepare, it tastes great.  However, I put my cake in for exactly 45 minutes and the bottom burnt quite badly.  Fortunately, that was easy to slice off because of how moist the cake is.  Still, I would suggest 30-40 minutes as a better guideline.  I also found I had way too much milk mix left over, but what can you do except make more cake next time... I added Godiva chocolate liqueur to the syrup and it tasted delicious with the cherries.  Next time I might try Amaretto or Bailey's.  Yum!

Yum! I've made this a few times for people who know and love authentic tres leches and it always gets rave reviews. I do skip the cherries though. Also, save and refridgerate the leftover milk mixture. Mix in an egg & a splash of vanilla the next morning and it makes an AWESOME soak for french toast! :)

This a very good recipe. Through my 15 year experience with pastries I only changed one thing. Egg whites and sugar make meringue. The secret to a great meringue is one and only and people don't know it, so here you have it. Place the egg whites in a pot with the sugar at the same time. Heat it up while whiping it with a whip. Do that for just 2 minutes un until sugar melts. Be careful not to cook the mixture. The reason why your cakes fell is because sugar was not dissolved and made the cake extra heavy. Enjoy!

Great cake, much better than store bought. I made this recipe for my husband's birthday, who was born and raised in Mexico, and he loves it! I made a double layer cake with fresh strawberries and whipcream frosting in the middle and on top. I didn't have problems with the "chewy lumps" you just have to make sure everything is well mixed. I added confectioners sugar to the whipcream frosting, but granulated is fine in the cake. The flour can form lumps when it's mixed with the yolks, I just mixed it well with a whisk. Very tasty, not too milky and perfect birthday treat! Thanks!

The cake is not hard to make. What i didnt get was the part where it calls for discarding 1 cup of the measured milk mixture or cover and refrigerate. And do what with it? If you discard 1 cup, you poured the remaining, and what do you do with this one cup that you discarded? Not a bad recipe overall, just that last part a little unclear...

My husband spent two years in Mexico, and had told me about this cake. I decided to make it for him for Cinco de Mayo as a surprise, but I was nervous because he had told me that even some latinos can't make it well, and most of the time it turns out too soggy. He was so surprised, and he LOVED it! I made the cake following the recipe to the T and I was very happy with the result. I didn't poke holes in the cooled cake, but left it in the cake pan and poured the sauce over it. I think it is imperitive to reserve the one cup of liquid in order to save yourself from a soggy cake. There were three things I did differently: add a pinch of salt to the cake before baking; bake for only 40 minutes; and add a little bit of sugar to the cream before I whipped it. Perfect! 
UPDATE: I made this again at my husband's request. I tried to save myself some time by refrigerating the evaporated milk and the sweetened condensed milk, but I found that the sauce didn't soak into the cooled cake as quickly as it did when I left the two cans room temperature. It ended up that I didn't even save myself any time because it took the same amount of time for the sauce to soak into the cake as it did to cool the cake in the first place. Next time I'll just leave them room temp and refrigerate overnight like I did the first time. Why mess with perfection?

My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this cake! He always asks me to make this for him for any occasion. As for me, I like the cake, but wouldn't say love. Something about the texture is not quite right, but as for flavor, it's very good.

Great recipe that tasted best the next day. I found that I needed to trim the sides of my cake so that it could absorb the milks evenly and used more of the milk mixture than called for. I would recomend frosting with the stabilized whipped cream recipe found on this site so that it will hold up a bit better than a regular whipped cream.

This cake is delicious!!  I made it for my daughter's birthday yesterday and all five of us loved it.  We usually purchase tres leches cake from a nearby fine bakery for $36, and this recipe comes very, very close in taste and texture to their cake.  I just need to learn to decorate :)  

I always make recipes as written first, then if there is potential for improvement, I tweak them. THIS RECIPE NEEDS NO TWEAKING!! What makes it so much better than other recipes I've tried?

* The chiffon type cake is light and fluffy so the milk mixture absorbs quickly.  Poke those holes! I used a skewer.
* The milk distributes throughout the cake.  I have made recipes where when you eat the cake there are parts with and parts without milk.  Even the sides of this cake were moist with milk.
*Milk ratios are perfect creating a mixture with the right consistency - not too runny, which creats a sopping mess. 

By the way, if you bake this cake for 30 minutes (15-20 minutes less than recommended), your cake will sink.  There cannot be any moisture or wetness in a chiffon type cake so bake it as directed. Even if it ends up slightly overcooked/dry, the milk will put moisture back and you will have a high, level cake.

I didn't feel like taking time for the cake part today, so I just used a yellow box cake.  I punched holes in the top and then followed instructions.  AMAZING!  It looked like a lake of sauce and then, the cake soaked it up (after a few minutes) and it left you with a super-moist layer, a cake-like layer and then the delicious whipped cream finish.  I did add some vanilla and confec. sugar to the whipped cream. I topped it with toasted coconut.  KEEPER!!

This cake is awesome..for those who dont know it's suppose to be a wet moist cake...this cake recipe is just as good as the tres leches they serve in the Cabana restaurants in NYC...I did a little research before I actually made this cake...my advice is you should shave the top of the cake once it comes out of the oven...this really helps for all the milk to soak in, I have had friends make this cake and some parts of the cake comes out dry...poke the holes and pour your milk over the cake while it is still hot...this really soaks in wonderfully, I have made this twice...I have people on line and requests for the next time I make it!

This recipe is perfect. It is very similar to Emeril's recipe and it is failproof. Followed to a T. Great results.  Don't bother with the others on this website..The "Tres Leches(milk cake) is not accurate and the amounts of liquid are off. I've been making this cake professionally for 3 years. Use this recipe!

SOOOO GOOD!!! Made in a bundt pan so that I could take the cake out of the pan pour the milk mixture in the pan and then put the cake back in the pan. So much easier. I even over cooked it(not burnt) I just used all the milk to make up for the dryness and it was great. Had people who don't like cake say they loved this. Even better the next day.

I wish this recipe described how to fold in the egg whites a little better.  My cake sank, just as a lot of people said.  I thought maybe this was normal because my son says it is supposed to be dense.  Well, I looked up how to fold in egg whites after the fact.  Put about a third of the whipped egg white into the batter, and gently mix it in to 'temper' the batter, which will make it easier to mix in the rest of the egg white. Hold the bowl over the mixing bowl containing your batter, and tilt it so that the egg whites slide out into the batter. Using a large spatula, cut a path down the middle of the mixture with the edge of the spatula. Then gently turn half the mixture over onto the other half. Continue cutting down the middle and turning a portion over. Don't stir. The purpose of folding is to retain the air you have beaten into the whites. Be careful to only work the batter enough to incorporate the whites, and never use an electric mixer for this step.  Mixing the egg whites into the batter too much will cause your cake to sink.  My cake still tasted good, even though it sank.  My son requested it for his birthday, and my husband thought it sounded gross.  But once he tried it, he loved it!

For the life of me I couldn't figure out what was missing from this cake.  Then I realized it's missing butter.  This cake was more spongy than the traditional tres leches cakes I've tasted.  Tres Leches is supposed to be dense--sort of like pound cake.  This cake was very porous.  I also think that more of the milk mixture needs to be poured over the cake.  It's not supposed to be soggy as some people have mentioned.  Though it's a lot of milk, it should absorb nicely into the cake and there really shouldn't be any traces of the milk on the cake plate.  I'm going to have to keep searching.

Came out nice and moist, however since I am lazy I'll just buy it at a bakery, but I must correct this is not a Mexican cake, Tres Leches is Nicaraguan =)

This turned out very well. I too, added a little sugar when whipping the cream.  I served the whip cream and sliced strawberries splashed with a little triple sec on the side. I served this to a dinner for 5, everyone had a piece and everyone took a piece home LOL. My  girlfriend told me I could freeze the leftover milk mixture for next time, so I'll keep you posted as to how that works out.

Monica, thank you SO much. For years, my friend selfishly hoarded the recipe to this fabulous cake. I've tried nearly every recipe out there (including one on allrecipes), but THIS IS "THE ONE!" To add my own personal touch, I spiked it with Kahlua and garnished it with strawberries. Yummy! Thanks again.

This was a very quick and easy cake to make. Mine baked in 30 minutes, maybe even faster because it was a little more dry/dense than I wanted. I would have given it 5 stars if the cake had been a little more airy, I'm comparing it to the tres leches at Cafe Rio. Only my husband and I thought it was dense everyone else thought it was wonderful. Also I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and sliced strawberries.

This tasted good but wasn't anything that special.  It turned out well though and here's what I did: to make it two layers with strawberries in the middle I followed all the directions as written but put it in two 9" cake plans that were greased/floured.  I cooked them for 13 minutes and they were already done, cooled in the pans for about 10 minutes, then inverted onto wire racks.  I used someone's suggestion of "shaving" the cake so it would absorb more of the leches and that worked out great, especially since half the bottom stuck to the pan when I inverted it!  A steak knife scraped the rest off nicely without taking any cake with it.  Then, while still on the rack with wax paper underneath, I poured the leches on top of just one layer of the cake until it couldn't hold any more (there was about 1 C left...I'd mixed them in a large liquid measuring cup).  Then I layered the dry cake, strawberries, whipped cream, wet cake.  The top was a "good kind of soggy" as others have mentioned but the bottom tasted like sponge cake.  It made the whole thing taste like a giant, partially wet strawberry shortcake.  It tasted fine (the wet portion was better than the dry), but you can essentially get the same result from normal spongecake with berries and whip, so didn't really seem worth the effort.

This is a great recipe.  May I offer a friendly addition: when adding the ingrediants to the egg yolk mixture, add a cup and a half of ripe banana slices.  Also, add up to another cup and a half of ripe banana slices to the whipped cream just before frosting the cake.

Very good cake.  Not too soggy and not too dry.  My family loves it when I make it into a 2 layer round cake and add strawberries with bananas or kiwi fruit.  Love it.

Only needed to bake 30min at most! Although the flavor on this cake is great thanks to the tres leches the cake was dense and somewhat dry in spite of the milks being poured. I've had better and moister versions.

So delicious & easy to make!!! I've had some not so good tres leches, but after seeing the ratings on this recipe I thought that I would give it a try. I didn't use quite as much of the milk that it asks for, and it turned out perfect...not too soggy. I also ended up with enough milk left to make another cake. Will Definitely make again!

Great cake. I only put about half of the condensed and evaporated milk, and was spongy enough for me.

I have made this several times as well as a few other recipes on the site.  Hands-down, this is always the best.  I actually beat my egg whites first, save and fold in when whent the recipe says.

This was really good and not hard.  I like that this recipe separates the eggs for a true sponge cake.  Remember to discard 1cup of the milk as the recipe states.  I made it for poker night.  Surprisingly, no one had heard of it before, so I didn't think they would like it, but was a BIG hit!

made this for my husband's birthday-the directions were easy to follow and the result was a really delicious cake! I was skeptical about the milk mixture-it took a while to absorb and never did fully, even having removed 1 cup of it. I only made two slight adjustments-For the flour, I used cake flour-seems like it just helps in keeping a lighter cake, well, light! I also used super fine sugar-it disolves easier and doesn't weigh down the cake, especially when you add it to the egg whites. It was fantastic tasting! Will make it again in a heart beat!

We made this for my son's birthday today and it was the best I've ever had.  We had Tres Leches in Guatemala, my friend from Honduras made it periodically, and from various places in the US and this was as good or better than anything else we've had.    We followed the recipe almost exactly except did it in a 9x13 cakepan instead of springform.  We also added about 1/4 cup powdered sugar to the whipped cream topping and topped with sliced strawberries.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's a keeper!

I thought it was great. I didn't have a springform pan so I baked it in a 9x12 glass dish. Worked out really well. I'm going to substitue coconut milk for the evaporated milk and add toasted coconut on top.

This cake is as good as everyone says.  My kids beg me to make it every week now!  I've made it for bbq's and taken it as a housewarming gift with a nice plate and there always "mmmmm's" and smiles at the first bite.  However, and this is important, they only loved it once I kept that extra cup of milk mixture in.  Without it the cake is too dry.  So don't waist any of it!  It's just delicious.

awesome!! it's pretty much a mexican better-than-sex cake, if you've ever had one of those. i used whole wheat flour with this cake and it still turned out really good, but next time i would use all-purpose to achieve the texture this cake is supposed to have. also, don't discard 1 cup of the milks! i followed this step, but next time i'll only discard a 1/2 cup because i think it could have been even a little gooey-er :) overall though: delish!

From a white girl's point of view this cake is great! However, my mexican friend said that the cake was too dense; I think I didn't beat the egg whites long enough :-(  other than my mess up, this was a simple and straight forward recipe--next time I will spend more time on the eggs whites and use a bundt cake pan so the batter will rise a little more.

Despite the fact that my cake actually fell (which I really can't figure out), this was an excellent recipe.  The top of the cake may look soaked after pouring about half the milks, but keep going!  I didn't, and the parts that were moistest trumped the rest.  ALSO- I frosted with a mocha whipped cream (heavy cream, sugar, instant coffee, coco) to make a cafe con leches cake.  Sublime.

Overall, I liked this cake a lot.  I used an 8 X 8 inch pan rather than springform, as I planned to leave the cake in the pan to absorb all the liquids.  Don't toss the extra milk mixture!  I used it all.  The cake had a nice rise, and could have been split into two layers if you really want good penetration of the leches.  Using all the liquid was maybe a little soggy around the edges, but it was a GOOD soggy.  I did not frost with whipped cream, though that would have been good too.  A drizzle of dulce de leche (which would make it a quatro leches cake) or some fresh fruit (think ultra-ripe fresh peaches) would also be great additions.  Thanks, Monica.

Nice tres leches cake recipe.  For a flavor variation, sometimes I use cream of coconut instead of sweetened condensed milk. Also I do not find it necessary to pierce the cake with a fork.  The milk mixture seems absorb just fine. The whipped cream frosting works really well especially if you add seasonal fruit as a garnish.

I thought this was excellent!  Next time I will use more of the milk sauce.  It tasted best where it was soaked through.  It also tasted better the next day.  I added a touch of pwdr. sugar and vanilla to the Whipped Cream.  I will make this often now.   I think I will caramelize some of the condensed milk next time and see if it is good. I am thinking with a caramel flavor it will be PERFECT.

Made this for Christmas and it was gone in less than 10 minutes. It was sweet and delicious. The only changes I made were in the topping. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar because the heavy whipping cream was not very sweet but it came out great! Gonna make it again for New Years. Yummy!!!

I have never baked nor eaten a Tres Leches cake, but my husband wanted me to make one for a mexican event we were having with friends.  I was terrified because one of the men mentioned that he eats this cake every time he's in Mexico.

But...he LOVED it...he raved about it, as did everyone else!   I followed the recipe to a tee except I did add some powdered sugar and vanilla to the whipped cream icing and I garnished it with strawberries instead of cherries.   I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a family party this weekend. We are from El Paso and used to really good pastel de tres leches. Of all the recipes I've tried so far, this one comes closest to the cake I love. I made the recipe exactly as specified, except I omitted the cherries, and sifted cinnamon on top of the whipped cream before piping a border of whipped cream on top of the frosted cake. In all, this cake was a huge hit with my family, and I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

Honestly, I give this one a boo. Maybe it was just me; but there was way too much liquid in the pan, even after I drained it. I think I'll look for a new recipe next time.

This was a great reciope.  I added some vanilla and sugar to the frosting like others did.  Next time I'll use some more of the milk mixture.  I like my tres leches a little more wet.

I made a 2 layer cake (doubled the recipe), soaked both cakes with the milk mixture. Decorated with strawberries but next time I think I'll puree fresh strawberries and put it in the middle layer along with the whipped cream.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday, and it was a success. Coming from a Mexican family, our dishes are very traditional, and this cake has become a favorite of my family. Being a baker myself, the instructions in this recipe were very helpful. You just need to sift the flour before mixing it into the egg yolk, and measure it correctly. don't use powder sugar because you will be making merengue; instead, of a sponge cake. don't overfill the pans; rather, fill them half way or 3/4 of it that way the mixture would not overflow while baking the cake.

What is with this cake? I made it twice with bad results. I followed the directions exactly, and it came out of the oven looking like a quesadilla, one inch thick! Nothing like the picture. I didn't even frost it. I will not try this one again. What a disappointment.

This recipe is wonderful. The cake is so rich, I did not frost it.  I whipped up the cream and served it on the side.
I followed original directions, the only chnage was I added a pinch of cinnamin to the batter.  My family loved it!

WE LOVED IT!!!!  I used 2 circle cake pans, reduced the cooking time slightly and garnished it with fresh berries (strawberries, black berries or whatever is seasonal).  My hispanic friends said it was perfect.  One other tip is to take off some of the crust so that it is all smooth and so the milk soaks in.

Great tasting . . . I did have trouble getting the moisture to soak all the way to the bottom of the cake.  So I served the cake in a little pool of the leftover milk mixture.  That worked well, but I would still appreciate suggestions on how to saturate the cake.

I made this cake for a Thanksgiving dessert and eveyone (especially my boyfriend) loved it.  It had the perfect amount of moisture.  We thought that next time we make it, we'll add Amaretto to the milk mixture before we add it to the cake.  MMM good

I just made this and it turned out very well. I am an experienced cook and find that a lot of people that write reviews on this site obviously are not. It might help if recipes were rated as  beginning, intermediate or experienced, the way knitting patterns are.

Excellent, unique and relatively healthy (as far as cakes go).  No butter and only 1 cup of sugar (plus sugar in condensed milk).  Here are some tips (ignore everyone else :p):

Bake for the recommended time.  This cake will look finished on the outside after 15 minutes into baking.

For newcomers to cooking, when the recipe says beat the eggs until soft peaks form (firm) this will take a while, especially if whisking by hand. The difference between firm peaks and stiff peaks is in the shape of the peak...if it looks like this ^ it's stiff.... if the peak settles down a little bit, but is still raised with a point, that is what you are shooting for (firm). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!  If you don't get the eggs to this point your cake will not be spongy enough and will not absorb the milk properly.  

I used all of the milk and it turned out great :D  Have fun!

My 10 year old daughter made this by herself in a 9 x 12 glass dish.  It turned out amazing!  We added sweet-n-low to the whip cream to make it sweet.  Other than that, she didn't change anything.  Fruit is NOT necessary and may dominate the flavor if used.

I have searched for the perfect tres leches recipe, and I can now end my search!  This recipe hit it right on.  Some tips I would offer to 'first-timers' is:
When you fold in the egg whites, be very careful not to over-mix them in.  If you must choose, under-mix them in, but overt mixing will result in flat-custard like cake-yuck! Secondly, This cake tastes better if you let it sit for a day or two  in the fridge (the perfect make ahead dessert!)  Only don't frost it until the day you serve it.  The receipe said to trow out the remaining milk, but I like mine extra moist, so I saved it and added it on serving day, and the cake soaked it right up.  Lastly, whip up the remaining cream with about 1/4 c sugar and 1 tsp vanilla for the frosting. Yum! Recipe says garnish with cherries, but I prefer lots and lots of fresh fruit and berries.  Enjoy!

Really liked this recipe. Will be making it again. Also, it is easy to just do the cake part when you don't have all the canned milk on hand.

The Cake was easy to make only took 25 min in the oven with 2- 9in round pans. Let it sit in the fridge with the milk for 2 hours before icing it. Everyone enjoyed it

This cake was great! Made 2 of them for Cinqo de Mayo party. Forgot the baking powder in the first cake. No biggie. They both went over pretty well. I also used strawberries instead of cherries.

Mmmmm this cake was so yummy!! I used granulated sugar and it worked fine (rather than confectioner's). However, when you whip the cream, you need to add some vanilla and a few teaspoons of confectioner's sugar to make it sweet. I followed this recipe, but checked the reviews, and added the milk mixture to the cake when it came out of the oven. Everyone was so impressed! I made this for Valentine's Day (we had tacos for dinner) and topped with chopped strawberries. Delicious! Thanks again for sharing!

Great recipe but don't discard that extra cup of milk mixture!  Refrigerate it and right before serving a piece of cake, pour a little bit of the cold milk mixture onto the plate and place the cake on top.

Delicious and turns out great every time.  I reduced cook time to 30 minutes. Instead of fruit on top I sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mix.  The trick for whipping the heavy cream is keep everything cold: the cream, the bowl and the beaters.  I place them in the fridge while making the cake.  If it won't whip, stick it back in the fridge for a while.  Patience! It takes time to whip.

This was my first time making and eating a tres leches cake. I was skeptical because the thought of a soggy cake grossed me out! This was a very nice surprise though! I did cut back about 1/2 cup on the milk mixture and it was perfect! Not dry at all but not a soppy mess. I will make this one again!

This was an amazing cake!!! It was also very easy to make. I love baking, and my best friend suggested that I try Tres Leches cake. I will admit, I was skeptical, but tried it anyway. I am so glad I did!! My entire family loved it. I will definitely be making it again!!!

I made this cake yesterday and my family loved it.  As another reviewer mentioned, it sank in the middle.  I am not an experienced baker and have no idea why this happened.  Maybe its a characteristic of this kind of cake?

I added 1/2 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the whipping cream when I made the frosting, which was delicious.  I also arranged kiwi, strawberries and blueberries on the finished cake.  It was a beautiful cake and I'm happy that I made it.

When I find out how to fix the sinking thing, I'll try it again.

This is a great cake. I modified it a bit--used all of the milk mixture and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. Made th whip cream layer the next day (added some vanilla and a little powdered sugar) and skipped the cherries. A Big hit!

Awesome cake. Fairly complex to make considering the number of steps involved, as well as the number of utensils required (it's somewhat messy). The result, however, was REALLY good and most definitely worth the work. The cake was such a hit it didn't last very long at all in the fridge; we ate it so fast!

This recipe makes a good basic sponge which doesn't shrink or shrivel upon cooling. However this is one cake which requires you to really REALLY like the taste of milk. I know it sounds silly to say that but I was very overwhelmed by the milkiness. You really must cut the milk syrup mix by half for if you tried using all of it, you're just wasting  for it seepes out of the cake. In terms of taste and texture, despite sogginess, it was rich, sweet and creamy. I much prefered it on the third day when it became less sweet, more flavourful and no longer a sugar bomb. A good way to counter this is to cut the cake up into tiny little squares( think indian sweets) and serve them bute sized. I give this four stars for it makes a good base cake to experiment with different flavours( I made it using rose milk) and only four because it makes way too much milk syrup. Maybe I'll try experimenting with bailey's or chocolate or strawberry!

Yum. Cool cake upside down (like all sponge cakes) and it won't fall. I wish I would have used all the milk mixture and I will the next time I make this cake. I like it to ooze the milk when I put my fork in. Delicious!

I just finished eating this Tres Leches cake after a very sweet co-worker of mine made it for my birthday. I think the cake was perfect. I have tried other cakes that were similar but never got the real effect of TRES LECHES!! I mean it's like no other ordinary cake. It's got a whole lot of milk products in it and it came out in every bite. MOIST MOIST MOIST CAKE! YUM!!! :) THANKS CARLA and ALLRECIPES.COM

Made it for a coworkers birthday I wanted a change and it definately did give me that.  It was hit and miss.  The girl I made it for promptly req. my cheesecake next time.  Another wanted the recipe and still raves about it!  It was sweet and messy.  Hard to make presentable.  Maybe a home cake for family...would not take for others to present as a birthday cake.  Serve with strong coffee to cut the sweet!

This cake is AMAZINGZ! The only problem I had with the cake was the amount of intense sweetness! At first I thought that the cake would be much better off with only 2/3 a can of condensed milk, but as the bites continued I found the sweetness irresistable! Although if anyone likes a more mild taste (the cake taste like sugar syrup) I personally reccomend the 2/3 a can of condensed milk. OR Make two 8" cakes and have a tart fruit inbetween the two such as stawberries and also on the top of the cake to even the flavor out. I used all of the milk. And although I ate more than half of the cake by myself it isnt as good as the tres leches cake I had at a favorite restaurant. This cake was very easy to make considering that I am new to the baking thing.

This was a different kind of cake than what I'm used to. The milk made it very moist and the whipped cream was a welcomed change from heavy,sugary frostings. I did not top it with cherries. It was great plain.

I love this milk mixture! I've made this cake a few times, and every time, I also get those little chewy pieces. I'm not sure why? Maybe I'm not folding in the whites enough. Still yummy though!

WOW!  I made this for my company christmas potluck. It was a big hit.  I separated the batter into two 8" pans and filled with vanilla pudding in between. I was worried about the person's comment saying you should use confectioners sugar instead of granulated or it would come out bad.  I didn't have time to go to the store and buy confectioners sugar so I took a chance.  The cake came out perfect.  I think that person just didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would love to give this cake 5 stars because it tasted great but there were hard little chewy bits throughout the cake that were a big turnoff. Not sure what exactly they were, but I followed the cake directions exactly. I won't make this recipe again but might try buying angel food cake and covering it with the milk mixture since this cake is very similar.

I made this cake for my son's birthday.  Tres Lecher cake happens to be his favorite cake.  I used two 9" cake pans.  The cake rose up over the top.  I will use three 9" cake pans instead.  I assembled the cakes in a Saran wrap lined 12" frying pan, the crust of the first cake at the bottom, a layer of strawberries. and the crust of the second cake facing up.  I used a bamboo skewer to poke holes in the two layer.  Poured all the liquid except one cup into the cake.  The liquid got soaked in a few hours.  Then I inverted the cakes into another Saran wrap lined frying pan.  Poured the remaining liquid into the cake and let it soaked for a few hours before frosting.
My son loved it so much that he took the leftover with him when he left.

I've used this recipe 3 times and it has been excellent each time.  I use fat free condensed milk and lowfat evaporated milk.  Everyone loves it!  Fresh strawberries look and taste wonderful on this cake.

Amazing! I made this for a "food day" in our AP Spanish class and everyone loved it! The taste is definitely worth the time you have to put in to making it. It has a texture similar to that of a spongecake, but tastes savory. Being that it is full of milk, be sure to keep it refrigerated! 
In addition, I just used a 9x13 inch glass pan and didn't transfer it to a serving dish and it worked out perfectly fine. I also didn't allow it too cool completely (mainly because I wasn't going to transfer it) before I added the milk mixture (which takes a fair amount of time to absorb into the cake). 
Though time-intensive, it is not a difficult recipe to follow, so don't be afraid, any beginning bakers!

This is a great recipe. Moist and delicious. Too many reviewers don't have experience baking and don't understand the directions.  White sugar is granulated sugar and if your cake comes out flat is because you did not follow/understand the directions.  Folding egg whites  into the batter is a delicate process and is where people are making the mistake and over mixing. That or you forgot the baking powder.  It is a shame people are allowed to write reviews when they did not understand the directions and are inexperienced bakers.

Great cake recipe. Easy to make for sure. This cake is not from Mexico, FYI it's from Cuba and moved to Miami and there in Miami is where it became very famous. It is a Cuban recipe brought to Cuba by the spaniards. Another country that uses this recipe a lot is Nicaragua, because of the influence of the Cubans during the exodus during castro's takeover. One if the best ones I've ever had is in the Havana Restaurant in West Palm Beach, FL

This was amazing!!!! Made it for thanksgiving and it was a definite HIT!! The only things I changed is I beat the whites with the sugar at the same time. Also I poured while hot the 1 can of condensed milk, 1 can of evaporated milk and measured in the evaporated milk can half regular milk and half whipping cream. It was delish super moist, spongy, and not too sweet.

I attempted to make this after having a friend's Tres leches cake. His cake was an old authentic recipe. 
 I was disappointed by this recipe. 

The instructions were simple enough to follow, the cake texture was good, but it was definitely missing something. I recall the cake he made as being melt-in-your-mouth delicious and there was quite a bit of liquid. 

 This was more spongy and as the instructions called for - I discarded off some of the milk mixture - I immediately regretted it. The cake was more dry than i'm used to. 

 I also believe that the cake is supposed to be served chilled, but i cannot recall if it's the milk mixture or the cake itself...... 

I added vanilla and strawberries to the whipped cream topping and some sugar for a little more sweetness. I was glad i did that.

I have never made tres leches before but mine came out beautifully! It didn't sink and I think I can contribute that to folding in the egg white mixture just right. Don't overmix as other reviewers said, better to undermix then overmix. Thanks for the recipe.

This could have been something I did but my cake "deflated"/collapsed some and did not keep its height when taken out of the oven. BUT no one noticed after I put the whipped topping on! 
I used a 13x9 inch pan and forked it while it was still warm, turned out amzing! I refrigerated the cake overnight and then added the topping an hour or so before serving. 

People went back for seconds ;)

No problems with the cake falling here. It came out nice and tall.
I barely sweetened to whipped cream because I was worried it would be too sweet otherwise (I used 1 tablespoon sugar to 1-1/2 cups cream). I'm glad I didn't use more. The cake was really sweet. A bit too sweet for my liking.

This recipe was AMAZING.  The recipe does call for white sugar,and I took that to mean regular granulated sugar not confectioners sugar and it came out really good.  Also it said to cook for 45 to 50 minutes but in my oven it only took 25.  Overall it was SUPER YUMMY!!!

very good and easy.  But will try adding cream of tartar to the egg whites next time to see if it will help maintain the height I was looking for.  Great taste.

This is the best tres leches recipe I've tried so far. I did take some advice from previous posts though. I added a little confectioners sugar to the whipping cream. Normally you would top this cake with either cherries or berries. My husband doesn't like berries very much so I put sliced banana between the cake and whipped cream. It came out great.

This is my first time ever baking from scratch.  This was a great recipe and I managed to get it right!  This cake has great quality, it tastes just like from the mexican bakery!  (only you are saving A LOT of money!)  Just remember, let it soak in the fridge for a couple hours,  all the milk tastes better cold!

I have made this cake 3 times and each time it deflated in the middle...don't know why.  Any answer?  I also did not use all of the liquid and have enough for another cake.  I also added a little sugar to the whipped cream frosting.  The whipped cream did cover the middle inperfection.  It is a very good cake and very easy to make.

This is the go to cake when strawberry season rolls in.  Now over time I've dabbled with changing things up.  Use 1/4c. of fresh lime (or other citrus) juice plus 2T water for the liquid in the cake (nice little tang to it).  Infuse the white sugar (granulated) with the zest of the citrus you pick.  I've added rum to the milk sauce with great success.  And we always use fresh fruit rather than canned.  I use all the milk and we always pour the milk on while the cake is warm.

This cake was DELICIOUS!!!!  My family and I ate the entire thing the night I made it.  The only thing I didn't understand was the part about setting aside 1 cup of the milk mixture to whip for a topping.  I was unable to whip it to a thick "frosting".  Next time I will set aside only the whipping cream not the mixture of 3 milks.

I had been using a different recipe before but decided to give this one a try.  So glad I did!  While I don't particularly like this cake, its my husband's favorite, so i made it for his birthday.  I only had 7.5 inch round pans, so it only took about 20 mins in the oven.  Also i used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of the 1/4 cup of heavy cream for the milk mixture and used all of it, since he likes it super wet.  I took some of the whipped cream for the frosting and added about half a package of instant vanilla pudding mix and about 3/4 cup of homemade strawberry preserves and used that as filling.  My husband said the cake was better than the ones from the pasteleria, and for a fraction of the cost!

This is such a great recipe, I had a lot of fun making this, the creativity is endless. For the first time making it, it turned out alright, I look forward to experimenting with this, I added sugar to the whipped cream to give it a little more spirit, combined with strawberries, makes for a delicious dessert that all can enjoy.

My husband is from Mexico and has been craving this cake, but I had never made it before.  I decided to give it a shot and used this recipe. He absolutely loved it and that was the biggest compliment! I followed the recipe exactly, but made two round cakes and used fresh strawberries instead of cherries.  I will defiately make it again!

I have made this several times with great results.  I do not care for the taste of evaporated and condensed milks so I like to play with other flavors to mask the milk taste.  I have used rum, coconut, white chocolate, chocolate and a favorite with my customers and friends is a tiramisu/coffee tres leches.  I also sweeten the whipping cream and garnish according to the flavor i use.  Another delicious idea is to slice the cake into 2 layers and add a fruit filling.  All ideas are better served the second day!  This is a great recipe to play around with...have fun!

This is a really nice cake.  Like some other reviewers, I sweetened the whipped cream with powdered sugar and added a bit of vanilla.  Instead of frosting the cake, I just served it with a big dollop of the sweetened whipped cream and some nice strawberries.  It looked great and tasted great too.  The next day, I drizzled caramel sauce on a dessert plate, put a piece of the cake on top, and added a dollop of cream on the side.  It was a nice change but very good too.   I put to good use the cup of cream mixture that is discarded from the recipe.  I served it over berries. Yum!

Be sure to let this cake soak for several hours- at least 8- before you eat it!  We didn't have the patience, and ate some of it after just a few hours.  It was okay, but when we finished it later on after many more hours had gone by it was significantly better.  The recipe is quite authentic and good.  One more tip, be sure to mix the vanilla in with the wet ingredients before you add the flour.  It seems obvious, but the recipe doesn't make that clear, and if you toss the vanilla on top of the flour it will make little vanilla-flour balls in your cake.

This recipe is amazing!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't whip any cream to frost the cake with.  I stand by the decision - it's moist and creamy enough without it.

I'll give this 3 stars, only becuase I haven't tasted it yet (maybe it's delicious!) but it looks like a flattened hourglass.  So I'm not necessarily writing this to critique the cake, but for some tips on how I could get this cake to turn out like it should.  Made it for my boyfriend for his birthday...luckily he rates things on how they taste, rather than on how they look. :)  But seriously, if anyone has any pointers, bring 'em on!

Delicious.  Followed Rebecca V2 advice snd used cake flour.  Added sugar to egg whites, at first I thought I had ruined the whites because it was soupy.  But I continued beating about 9 minutes with a hand beater and they came out looking like whipped cream, which made folding into cake mixture very easy.  It didn't have all those air bubbles.

This is a delicious, super moist cake.  It is very easy to prepare, but requires a bit of time.  After the cake is baked, it must cool completely before pouring the milk mixture on top of it.  Then, you should allow the flavors to congeal in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.  Believe me, it is worth the wait!  I use mandarin oranges as a garnish.

I have never made this type of cake before.  But directions were easily followed and turned out amazing!  I made it the night before for a ladies get-together and they raved about it. Topped with fresh strawberries is incredible!  Can't wait to try fresh rasberries!

I thought this cake was exceptionally yummy! It didn't look as nice as the one pictured, but was delicious all the same. The cooking time on my cake because of the high altitude was 40 minutes.  I also left it in the the glass dish it was baked in.  I just let it cool completely before pouring the liquid in.

I was very disappointed in this cake after all the glowing reviews.  I'd give it a 5 for presentation, but only a 2 for taste.  As others have experienced, the cake took only 35 minutes to bake.  It looked beautiful coming out of the oven, then the top fell.  I hated wasting a cup of the milk mixture.  (Try it in coffee or tea!)  The cake was not "moist" but "soggy", and once cut a puddle of milk formed on the bottom of the plate.  I also thought there was too much whipped cream for the icing.  The taste just didn't really appeal to me.  But garnished with strawberries it really was beautiful!  (See my picture).

I would say a 3.5. This cake was gorgeous when it came out of the oven, however, a couple minutes later, it caved!! It shrunk and looked similar to a crater.. luckily I hid the shape with A LOT of whipped cream. The cake didn't absorb the milk mixture very well. Overall, the cake was pretty good, not very sweet (the way I like it). I topped it off the cherries b/c my friend's allergic to  strawberries (which I would have preferred). Thanks for the recipe, I wonder if I did something wrong?

I loved this cake!!  It was SO delicious - I substituted the strawberries for the cherries as well.  I used a deep dish pie plate and that worked really great at keeping the liquid contained.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, because it looked beautiful coming out of the oven, but then shriveled and was really FLAT by the time I poked holes in it to pour the milk over it.  Either way - it tasted divine - I'll make this again for sure!

FANTASTIC!  I am no baker by any means, but this cake came out so well!  I absolutely loved it, and the instructions were easy to follow!  I actually ended up using the entire milk mixture rather than "discarding" or reserving 1 cup of it.  And strawberries added a perfect visual and flavor accent!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for my brothers graduation party, and it was awesomely fabulous! EVERYBODY loved  it! 
It is deceptively light tasting, so you feel like you could just keep eating more and more. Probably not the best idea.
I used strawberries instead of cherries. Muy delicioso!

My family loved the recipe.  They keep asking when I am going to make it again.  The one things I did change was that I added 1.5 times the amount of Condensed Milk, Evaporated Milk and Heaving Whipping Cream.  My family likes this dessert wet, so I included more of the milk mixture.

Made this for christmas this year, and my family loved it.  It is so moist.  I personally found it a little bland, but everyone said it was fantastic.  I may add a little cinnamon and nutmeg next time.  but overall a real crowd pleaser.

Soooo delicious.  I added more sugar to the whipped cream- do it to taste.  I actually made two at the same time, since I prepared them for a Spanish oral presentation that I had for class.  Everyone loved it- even one Mexcian classmate, who said she usually hated tres leche cake (It was my first time tasting it) liked it.  You're in for a VERY sweet treat.  I topped with strawberries (see the picture).  It is a bit tedious to make, so make sure you have time to make it, but the end result is rewarding.

Awesome!  I used 2 9'' pans and put a layer of fresh strawberries in the middle with some of the whipped cream.  I also used all of the milk I just kept adding more to the cakes as they absorbed it.  I also sliced off the top crust for eiser absorbtion.  Soooo  Good!!

The cake is pretty good.  It tastes like a mix of angel food cake and yellow cake.  I didn't have whipping cream, so I used whipped topping instead for the frosting, and it was good.  The cake didn't really start soaking up the liquid really well until a few pieces had been cut, and it was in the fridge a couple of days.  It was really good with cherry pie filling.  Next time, I will try to add some additional flavoring to the milks.

This is a GREAT cake.  My family is hispanic and we've eaten A LOT of Tres Leches cake.  This was better than anything we've bought at the store.  It was an instant hit and the cake disappeared in 10 min!

Followed advice of Phoenixdoughboy and used 8x8, and this recipe was wonderful.  You can use all the milks and it does not become too soggy.  I did however, put a meringue topping and baked for 15 minutes 350, just for looks.  The dulce de leche topping I'll try next. Nice dessert for something different.

This is the second Tres Leches Recipe I have tried... I have to say that so far it is the BEST recipe. Because the cake was not too sweet, the three milk mixture made the cake taste just right. HIGH FIVE MONICA! Thank you!

Yum! Made this for my daughter's Spanish Fiesta at the end of the year.  I read reviews, and poured milk mix on hot cake, worked beautifully. I have never made homemade whip cream before, but based on web search chilled beaters and bowl in freezer 20 min before whipping. Worked like a charm. Also used unflavored gelatin to stabilize the whip cream. Was good looking for next day, plus left overs on day 2. I made recipe as is,  in 9 X 13 inch pan to send to school, my oven is fussy but I baked 20-25 minutes (seemed to be about right time for size of pan).  It was just enough batter for cake to be good size at serving time.  May have helped with soaking up milk too.  I will verify this can all be made the night before, with excellent results. I have never had this but liked it, my daughter's friends liked it as well. Thanks!!

This recipe also works if you bake two layers instead of one and use the same milk proportions. I recommend starting with the bottom layer first, then place the top layer and put the rest in it.

The cooking time for the cake was a little too long  and I added sugar and vanilla to the whipped cream “frosting” but other than that I love this recipe. The cake comes out light and fluffy. It’s the best Tres Leches recipe I could find after searching for a couple of hours.

I followed the directions to a tee except I poured all the milk mixture into the cake and I only baked for about 20-25 minutes.  That could be due to my oven running hot.  Served it at a party and it was a hit!  One of the best tres leches cakes I have made and I have made quite a few!

I liked this cake a good amount but would change the following;
1. I used ALL of the milk mixture and added it while the cake was warm. Refrigerated afterwords till cold. Cake held together wonderfully
2. Would add a little cinnamon to the milk mixture for more flavor. It was a tad bland.
3. Find another way (besides adding cinnamon) to enhance flavor of milk mixture. The cake flavor was perfect.
Tip: tastes better after chilling overnight and adding sugar (2 TBSP) and vanilla (1tsp) to whipped cream topping.

It would have helped if there was a separation in days to make this recipe and to explain it within the two days. The cake was pretty dense, we continued on pouring the milk mixture for a while because we were unsure of how long to be doing that. But, the overall taste was pretty good.

This cake was OK. I found it rather bland and flavourless, and quite dense. There was also a lot of milk wastage. I would make it again, and try to whip the eggs for longer, as I think that this contributed to the density, and add some cinnamon to the milk mixture that is poured over the cake, as well as make less of the mixture.

It tastes great! It’s fairly easy to make too. The only negative thing I have to say is that it’s not as airy as the cakes you get at restaurants. I’m not sure how you would fix that though - maybe cream of tarter in the egg white mixture? In my case the milk mixture was completely soaked up by the cake and it was still dry in some parts. I even added the remaining 1 cup milk mixture. I think I’ll add a 1/4 cup whole milk into it too next time. But then again, I used a slightly smaller pan so the milk had more distance to climb/soak upward. Overall, I would definitely recommend this cake!

I was looking for Puerto Rican recipes. I followed the recipe without changing anything. It was moist, and sweet. The cherries were tart, nice contrast to the sweet milk. I will continue making it.

Made as-is, but did pour milk prior to cooling, and put strawberries on the side (unlikely my kids would eat candied cherries). This is really delicious.

This is a terrific recipe! Be sure to follow the instructions: mix egg yolk with sugar and dry ingredients before gently folding in beaten egg whites. I poured the milk over the cake a little at a time, allowing it to absorb evenly one spoonful at a time. The final cake could have absorbed additional milk mixture; next time I will try adding more and reserving less. It might be yummy with rum, amaretto, tuaca, or brandy added to the milk mixture. The recipe is correct with granulated sugar; I'm not sure why some reviewers say it should be powdered sugar.

Do not listen to these people saying that you use confectioners sugar white sugar is granulated sugar not powdered sugar. other than that the recipe turns out great use parchment paper in the bottom of the pan after you grease it and then pour the mixture in and then you can lay the fruit into the raw batter and bake it

This recipe was incredible. I worked alongside my grandmother to make this, and the result was one of the best cakes I have ever had. I would like to applaud the maker of this cake and this recipe, as it is incredible! The only drawback is that it is fairly complex and hard to make, but once you get the handle of it, it makes for an amazing dessert.

This will definitely be a new favorite for holidays!!! One small problem was I should have never put that amount of sugar in with whipped cream topping. Maybe taste as your making it.

Not a big baker but this was fun to make! It's perfect and I had lots of good compliments. Only thing I added was a little bit of sugar and vanilla with the whipping cream for the topping :)

This cake turned out pretty well and it is delicious.  I baked it for approx. 35 minutes only.  Next time I would only mix half the required milks and half the cream instead of mixing it all together to only discard it.  I saved approx. 1 1/2 cups from the mixture as I didn't want a soggy mess for a cake.  It turned out well this way.  I whipped the whipping cream with 2 tbsp. of white sugar and added 1/2 crushed crispy crunch chocolate bar to the whipped cream then iced.  Refrigerated for 2-3 hrs.

Needs to be eaten pretty quickly, doesn't save well. It was very good though! I saved the extra cream and added more the next morning because the cake had soaked up the first!

First time making tres leches and it was so good! Followed instructions and cake turned out perfect! What I did different:
- checked the cake after 30 mins and was done
- didn't wait for cake to cool down completely
- didn't poke any holes to the cake, milk mixture was absorbed evenly
- added a tsp of vanilla and almond extract to whipping cream before mixing
- added 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of conf sugar to whipping cream at the end. It has been almost a day and whipped cream still looks perfect.
- little cinnamon powder on top
Beautiful, easy, delicious!

May possibly be one of the best cakes I've ever made/eaten! I went easy on the liquid when it came to pouring over the cake and like some others I did this when the cake was hot. My seven year old loves cinnamon too so I mixed a teaspoon of ground cinnamon in with the cream topping. It was delicious, definitely destined to become a regular bake!

THE PERFECT AUTHENTIC TRES LECHES CAKE RECIPE!!
I live in Arizona and this is my favorite cake. There are many authentic Mexican food restaurants in my area that serve this cake so the bar was set high for finding a recipe that could measure up and this one does! I tried another recipe from this site for this cake and it turned out awful! This one is amazing!!! The other recipe called for copious amounts of sugar and milk and did not suggest to separate the eggs. Separating and beating the eggs really makes all the difference! Otherwise the sponge is too dense. This recipe calls for the right amount of sugar and is not too sweet, just sweet enough. The cake is light and airy and the milk mixture has the perfect flavor. I used heavy cream instead of milk but I do think I will use a bit more next time as I like a bit more of the 3 milk mixture in my tres leches cakes. Thank you so much for this recipe and my search for the perfect authentic tres leches recipe is now over! 10/10 all the way!!!

I made a perfect mistake By adding 1.25 cups of sugar total to the recipe. 1 cup for the flour mixture and .25 cups of sugar for the heavy whipping cream mixture. I served this for Cinco and my whole office loved it. Some of them said it was the best cake they have ever had. I'm not a very good cook by any means but I have to give myself a pat on the back for this one. Enjoy!

Let's face it.  This recipe is more difficult and challenging than most cake recipes.  However, if you follow the directions EXACTLY, it turns out perfectly, maybe reduce the baking time or check five min early.  If you pay attention to whipping your egg yolks, then cleaning the bowl thoroughly before whipping the egg whites, AND THE EGGS ARE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, you will be fine.  Would add some lemon zest next time, although it really was perfect as written!

I made this for my husband's birthday, and everyone loved it! The only thing I changed is I omitted the cherries. I added strawberries that I macerated for approximately 2 hours in 1/4 cup of sugar and 6 oz. pineapple juice. Absolutely delicious!

I added fresh strawberries and let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  
I didn't use all of the milk mixture  so the cake came out moist not soggy
It tasted like Starwberry Shortcake.  This recipe is a keeper

It is extremely important to properly fold the whites into the batter. Too much folding and you have a flat cake. Too little folding and you will have "chewy" pieces from unincorporated egg white. The 1/4 c. granulated sugar should be added to the egg whites before whipping, as sugar helps build peaks, prevents overbeating, and dissolves in liquid egg.

Easy recipe to make. I think the pan size in the recipe is too big. I just used a single round pan. You could also use probably an 
8 in or 10 in spring form pan too.  I did not make any adjustments for living at high altitude (adding more flour)  and it is rising perfectly! Bon Appetite! The recipe does not need confectioner sugar.

This cake was AMAZING and I am a foodie so I know good...I am a beginner cook of about 2 weeks and was scared to try this but it was EASY and delicious. My 18 year old son said this is his favorite cake ever. The only thing I would change is...I discarded 1c of the milk mixture as the recipe suggested but the next day the cake was a little dry so next time I will save the mixture and add it the next day as needed.

This was an excellent recipe I made it for my daughter for her birthday today and for Thanksgiving.  I did make a few changes to the milk adding 1 cup of whole milk in place 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I also added 1tbs of vanilla to the milk mixture.  For the whip cream topping I added 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar and the entire pint (2 cups) of heavy whipping cream and whipped on medium/high speed until thick enough to spread on top. For a finishing touch I added some cinnamon on top just for a little color and added flavor.  It came out perfect, my while family really enjoyed it!

Only bake for 30 minutes. Also sweeten and add vanilla to the whipping cream to frost it. I also put crushed pineapple and strawberries in between the layers and on top. My husband loves it and he only likes authentic Mexican food!

I made Tres Leches cake for the first time using this recipe and served it at a Cinco De Mayo party; it was a huge hit. It sunk a little bit while cooling but didn't affect it at all, I was amazed at how the cake absorbed all of the milk so quickly. I covered it with fresh sliced strawberries which gave it a nice crisp summer flavor. This was the first time I myself had never had it before and am now hooked!

This recipe is great and easy to make! Although, I did make some changes. I baked it for 40 mins instead of 45. I used condensed, evaporated heavy cream and almond milk, so I should probably call mine Quattro leches lol. Otherwise, the cake itself is spongy and delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper

First time I Had tres leches was recently and it was absolutely delicious.  Decided to make it, using Monica's recipe.  Made it twice with the same result - flat cake.   I followed the recipe very closely.  I was so disappointed that I couldn't make it especially since it was supposed to be dessert for Easter Sunday.  :(
I have no idea what I did wrong twice!!!

Very good. Only substitution I made was substituting cake flour (1 c. + 2 T.) and added a pinch of salt. Will make again.

Update: Made again 6/17 and completely followed this recipe. Family loved it as is. I used all the liquid and the cake absorbed everything.

All that talk about tres leches cake on the buzz , it got me motivated to finally make it after being so intimidated for a long time.   I haven't had tres leches cake for almost 10 years. I chose this recipe from judging on the milk listed and technique.  Anywho, this cake was fabulous!!!  I made as written but wanted a touch of cinnamon to my milk mixture.  I didn't taste any cinnamon because i added too little so next time I will double dash it and see if I like it best with it. Stay tuned....

Super easy, just a little time consuming. This is not too sweet, and is really moist. My husband usually hates cakes in general, but said he really liked this one, and in fact ate several slices.

This was my first attempt at baking a cake from scratch and I loved it. I think that I may have undercooked it for fear of burning the bottom because it collapsed when out of the oven. Otherwise, it was delicious! I can't wait to try it again. Thanks!

I had heard of this cake and tried it at a Mexican restaurant and thought it was okay but blah.  I made this recipe thinking one you make it home would be much better.  It came out great, looked great and tasted okay but just not much flavor. I will not make it again - it's not the recipe but just not to my taste. I even added strawberries and sweetened the whipped cream topping but still blah.

This cake is simply awesome!  Melts in your mouth delicious, but very rich.  Only suggestions - probably don't need to use as much of the whipped topping as called for in the recipe.  Also, make sure the batter is fairly well leveled flat or the milk will pool along the edges.

The cake was good as far as flavor goes.  I'm not too convinced on the textured.  I don't know if I beat the eggs too much or what I did wrong, but the texture of the egg just didn't seem quite right.  I've ate many tres leches cakes and this didn't seem to have that authentic taste, but it was good.

WOW! This was sooo delicious! I was a bit wary about the idea of a soggy cake, but it was anything BUT soggy! I used this recipe for my daughter's 7th b-day party (she requested a mecican fiesta), so I figured this would be a nice alternative to a regular cake, and it did not dissappoint. Everyone at her party had seconds, which didn't leave us any left-overs. The only thing I changed was fresh strawberries instead of maraschino cherries since they were in season! Thank you so much for this!

This is a good recipe if you're in the mood for a shortcake flavor. I topped mine with strawberries before I put the whip cream on-very good.  Watch your cook time closely, this only took 25 minutes to bake as I have a gas range.

I have now made this recipe a few times, mostly for friends' birthdays.  Each time, I have been surprised by how AMAZING it turns out!  The last time, I laced the milk mixture with dark rum (this is only for adult crowds, of course) and it was a huge hit!  
     My favorite part about this cake is that it's virtually impossible to screw up.  If you overcook the cake, no worries, the milk automatically adds the moisture for you!

Something was really wrong with this cake. I accidentally put the 3/4 of sugar into the whites instead of the yokes so i only put about 1/4 into the whites b/c i didnt like the idea of using anymore sugar.... big mistake the cake turned out flat and corn cake like.. definately was not the texture i was looking for... i probably wont try this again because of  all those mixed reviews ... Although like i said it could have been the fact i made the cake in reverse order:) i orginally wrote this review and rated it 2 stars but the cake seemed to have improved after it settled overnight in the milk mixture.

Had never had tres leches before, but needed something for a fiesta party. It was OK, I wasnt too fond of it and neither was anyone else. Very basic and easy to make, which was appealing! I used 2- 8" round cake pans. I kept them separate though, so I would have more cake to serve! It was too wet of a cake for all of our tastes!

This cake is amazing!  I substitute strawberries for cherries, and put them in a layer between the wet cake and whipped cream.  Easy to convert to 10,000", comes out perfectly everytime.  Will make time and time again (the recipe is magnetted to the 'fridge!!)

Wow. This was amazing. My only suggestion is to use fresh fruit instead of maraschino cherries--I peeled/sliced a whole mango and arranged it on top of the cake. Wonderful.

The cake was wonderful, however, there were some hard/chewy bits throughout.  I don't bake often and think the problem may have been because I didn't sift the flour and baking powder before mixing with the other ingredients.  I also added the left over milk mixture to the whipping cream for the frosting as someone else suggested.  I would definetly do that again.

I obviosly did something wrong. This was my first tres leche cake. It didn't look like the picture instead it look a little hill. The cake was delicious in flavor but lack in the texture part. It didn't come out like a sponge cake but like but a rubber sponge cake. Not too sure what I did wrong. Thanks for the recipe. Trust me the cake is not going to waste.

Ever since I tasted a slice of tres leches cake, I've been hooked. Thanks for the recipe. Now I can make it instead of buying one. I think it's perfect 'though I used 1c. self-rising flour instead of the flour+baking powder 'coz it's what I have on hand. My son rates it YUMMY!

Absolutely PERFECT! I would give it more stars if I could. We have spent a lot of money purching this cake from the bakery for parties for years and this is an even better recipe! Thank you!!!

WOW, what a great recipe.  This was my first Tres Leches Cake and everyone loved it!  I added a little more sugar to the recipe and a little sugar to the whipped heavy cream and it was wonderful! Seasonal strawberries are a perfect topping.

My boyfriend's family is from Nicaragua and his mom has made this tasty treat before.  This recipe turned out just as delicious, and the only thing I had to change was adjusting my baking time to only 35 minutes.

It's so easy to make and is soo delicate!  Saw a special about it on FoodNetwork and had to make it!  Glad I did!  Not too sweet, but it's so good!  Trust me, it's easy.  I'm only 20!!
