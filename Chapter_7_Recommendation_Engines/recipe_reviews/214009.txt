Great base recipe to put your personal spin and embellishment on.  I wish I had a nickel for every time Mom made this as I was growing up and then myself after that.  We never add sugar, but we do add a little dill pickle juice, a squirt or two of yellow mustard, and a plop of sour cream - oh, and maybe a dribble of milk if it's too thick.  And there are so many possibilities for add-ins - thinly sliced radishes, green onion, chopped dill pickles or cucumbers, bell pepper - just go to your produce department and see what looks good to you and has lots of color.  Good, reliable and nostalgic recipe.

Great base for potato salad!  This is classic picnic food and I made this to go with pork ribs.  No matter what your personal preference potato salad is always a hit!  I add more eggs and use green onions. I always mix the dressing part separate then add it to the potatoes and veggies so it doesn't get mushy.

This is still the best recipe for potato salad. The only thing I do differently is add less salt, more like 1/2 tsp.

I have been using this recipe for several years.  I started using it when I ran across it on the back of a Hellmann's jar.  It sounded perfect because I do not like mustard.  Family and friends always ask me to bring the potato salad because it is so good.  I made it for Easter and forgot to put the onions in.  If it is possible for this to get better, I think the missing onions may have made it taste even better.  I do increase the sugar to a heaping tablespoon.  Next time I may try cutting the onions in half and see how that taste.  Even if you follow the recipe as written it is delicious!

I have been making a very similar recipe for years, but I omit the salt, sugar and vinegar and substitute a chopped medium large garlic pickle with the brine.  Be sure to toss this with the potatoes while they are very warm.  It is irresistable after it has been chilled for at least an hour

A little bit bland as written. I added some sweet pickle relish, dry mustard and green onions. Would make again with these additions... some have said they added radishes... I LIKE THAT IDEA!

This is the recipe my mother made most often and is the one I refer back to in a pinch when I am short on time. Sweet pickles can be added to taste. It's creamy, old fashioned flavor is perfect for those summer picnics and backyard parties!

This is the ONLY potato salad I use!  Perfect combo of spice.  I think you need to make this at least the morning of or a day before so the salad has a chance to gel.

They used to put this on the label- this and their Macaroni Salad recipe were the best (starter) cause you can tweak it from there. Always good, I used to cut back the Mayo  so it wasn't sloppy wet.

This was just okay.  I didn't have any celery and I think that may have helped a lot.  May have to try again and re-rate.

Good start but you can add to this base recipe to make it GREAT. I added sliced radish and used green onion instead of chopped white onion. I also added 1 tsp of mustard, a pinch of dill and cut back the salt to 1 tsp.

Great recipe! I did feel compelled to add mustard and dill relish.  Everyone has their own tweaks for potato salad:)  And I've used only Hellmann's since I found out how much better it is than the others on the market!

Delicious, quick and easy! My family don't like lots of ingredients in their potato salad, so this was perfect! Was a little uneasy about the sugar, but added it anyway and it tasted great.

Since I don't eat potato salad I am rating this based on the react that I got from others.  I have made this twice and I was told that it's perfect!  I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it worked out great.  This is my go to recipe when I need potato salad.

Simple and delicious recipe !I followed the recipe but added a cucumber for more crunch and a red pepper for color. Next time I'll add more vinegar.

Great, versatile recipe - lots of good suggestions in the reviews. I was in a rush so I didn't mix the mayo + seasonings in a separate bowl before adding the potatoes. I just added all ingredients in one bowl and mixed. I could see how it'd make the mixture more even and easier to mix with the potatoes. Next time I'll do that. still, it came out great and everyone went back for seconds (at least). I did change it up a bit using review suggestions and also due to laziness/time. I used dill pickle juice (about 2 TBSP) instead of the vinegar and sugar, added a dash of sour cream, a squirt of yellow mustard and a little less onions than called for. I usually don't like raw celery so I used a bit less than it calls for - but loved it in this salad. It gave it a much needed texture. Delicious, easy and will definitely make again. (I used russet potatoes and did add the boiled eggs.)

Maybe I cooked the potatoes too long but I thought it was mushy!  I also thought it was lacking in taste.  It needs some spicing up!  Next time I will try and add some spices.

Excellent basic recipe. I used the exact recipe provided here. It tastes almost like I remember, but maybe a bit too sweet. In the future, I will add less sugar and a bit of dill pickle juice.

I've always like this recipe but it's way to salty.  Cut it back to .5 tsp or to taste.  I use Yukon Gold Potatoes.  After they are done cooking I splash them with additional apple cider vinegar to absorb the tang.  Very good recipe.

This turned out as expected...a good potato salad. Nothing special, but good. I think you could add things to it to make it your own...chopped pickle, radishes, olives, etc.

I, too, have made this potato salad before after seeing it on the back of the mayonnaise jar (Hellmann's is the ONLY brand I buy/use). It is super simple to throw together, and tastes great! I also like to make it a day ahead to allow the flavors to blend together. This is a very versatile recipe. You could change up the quantities or add anything to it to suit your tastes. This is a wonderfully simple potato salad! :)

This is my idea of what potato salad should taste like. I halved the recipe, added dill pickle and omitted the onions. I will never use another recipe again. Good hot OR cooled.

I made this for a BBQ.  It was a huge hit.  I did make a few small changes.  I added pickles and left out the onions.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I came home without leftovers.  Its a keeper.  Thanks!!

This is always a classic, but I make some adjustments. I leave the skins on the potatoes, use fat-free mayo, use green onion instead of white or yellow, and add a chopped pickle and a tbls of mustard.

Your basic potato salad recipe.   I just made one change...I like sliced potatoes (New York deli style) rather than chunks and when in a hurry it takes much less time to cook.

I think this is the very best  potato salad recipe. I've been making this for 20 years, my mother made it before me. Maybe it's because I grew up on this recipe, but it's really the only potato salad I truly love. My kids feel the same way.

This recipe is TO DIE FOR.  My mother, aunt, cousin, and I fight over it every year!  We add 2 seeded and diced cucumbers to this potato salad for a soft crunch.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Oh - we also add more eggs. :-D  But that may just be us!
