What a fabulous recipe that can be put together in a jiffy.  I would recommend wild caught shrimp for full flavor.

I added ginger as one user suggested to add flavour. This was pretty good but we still prefer the "Easy Shrimp Lo Mein" for one of our favourite "Meatless Mondays" dish.

This is quick and easy but a little on the bland side for us.
