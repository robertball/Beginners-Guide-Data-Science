This recipe was awesome as it was. I hate it when other people alter it in reviews (not fair if it's a different recipe) but I will say this so no one makes the same mistake I did: make sure your sauce has garlic in it, otherwise it won't be just right. Not sure how I managed to buy the only kind without it but.... If you do this, this recipe rocks as it is and will be made again and again in our house. Thanks so much.

I used to make something very similar to this that I got out of an Italian mafia cookbook.  I baked it as a casserole.  I would prepare the polenta, then spread it on the bottom of a 9X13 plan and refridgerate it until it firmed up.  Then, spread the cooked sausage filling on top and finish with more polenta on top of that and of course lots of cheese!  The top browns in the oven and it is sooooooooo yummy. I can't tell you how many compliments I receive on it.  For even more cheeziness, layer provolone slices between.  Scrumptous!

Great idea to serve polenta with veggies in tomato sauce like that especially with italian sausage. I have made some modifications however: instead of spaghetti sauce i used a 24 oz can of crushed tomatoes, i have added 3 crushed cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. I also made the polenta instead of buying it and didn't do the broiling part which actually sounds really good. (To make the polenta just bring water to a simmer and slowly add corn meal mixing constantly; let cook for about 5 mins)

We enjoyed this last night!  I used a vegetarian sausage and made the polenta for more flavor.  This is a quick recipe that you won't feel guilty about!

Very very tasty veggie, meat and sauce mix.   I used spicy turkey italian sausage and egg[plant because it was what I had handy.  I made homemade polenta with a a recipe off the back of the stone ground cornmeal bag.  The polenta itself is very plain, but absorbs the sauce and is pretty tasty for what it is.  I got the "go ahead and make this again" from my family

YUM!!! I used turkey sausage instead of bulk Italian sausage and used a 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce instead of a 16 oz jar. Also added a small amount of some random spices (oregano, pepper, salt). Delicious! Will definitely be making again.

EXCELLENT RECIPE...wouldn't change a thing. I wasn't sure if the polenta was supposed to brown (nothing seemed to be happening), so I just let it crust a bit. So good.

Man, was this delicious!  I used spicy turkey sausage, an orange pepper, and larger quantities of all the vegetables than it called for, but I don't think any of those changes substantially affected the dish.  While I don't think the polenta added much to the dish, the sauce was wonderful and would be delicious over pasta too.

This is now a go-to recipe for me for quick dinners. I used veggie crumbles because I'm vegetarian and made my own creamy polenta (from this site) and didn't bake it. Yes, I know it's not exactly the same, but this recipe was great inspiration! Makes me wonder why I haven't been making polenta all my life :)

I could not find polenta so I made cornmeal mush to which I added cheese, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  The sausage mixture was absolutely fantastic! Will definitely make this dish again!

Yummy! Even my hubby, who isn't a fan of polenta, raved about it several hours later.  I couldn't find tubed polenta, so I used instant from a box, then spread it on a cookie sheet and baked it.  After baking, I cut it into rounds and broiled it with havarti on top before adding the veggie mixture. (you need to add your own seasoning to the mix).  I'll be making this again.  Thanks!

This was great!! I used homemade sauce and veggie crumbles instead of sausage but otherwise followed the directions exactly. We'll definitely be making this one a lot. The veggies came out perfectly after 7 minutes on the stove. Delicious!

to say that i am a novice cook is generous. but im getting there. :) ive been wanting to try polenta and when i stumbled on this recipe, i figured it may be a good start. this was SO good. i used hot italian turkey sausage and green squash since thats what i could find. i loved it and my boyfriend loved it. a definate keeper. i did feel like there was more sauce in relation to the polenta.

The sauce is much  better than it looks in the picture. With the zucchini, peppers, and onions it is actually quite substantial.  I used a bit more spaghetti sauce to make it less chunky. I served it with cornbread muffins. Delicious!

We absolutely loved this. I made it with Trader Joe's
Autumnal Harvest pasta sauce, which gave it just a bit of sweetness. I like to sprinkle some Parmesan on the polenta before broiling.

Will make it again, but hubby didn't rave over it. I used turkey sausage, not hot. That would have been too hot for us. I did use 25 ounces of spaghetti sauce.A good, rather healthy dish..

10-19-2015  ~Silly me, I forgot I used all the zucchini in the minestrone I made yesterday.  Oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, as the saying goes.  I had already started this dish, so I had to make do without the zucchini, adding some green pepper in its place along with the red bell pepper.  In addition, I did adapt the recipe in several other ways.  First, I added fresh garlic and, once the sausage and vegetable mixture was cooked, a good glug of white wine.  I never use any sort of commercial spaghetti sauce so I used fresh, chopped, peeled tomatoes. I also try to avoid “Italian seasoning” whenever possible and in this case I used fresh parsley, oregano and thyme from my garden. Now I generally don’t care for prepared polenta, but since Hubs was away on a business trip and I was on my own for supper, it worked well in a pinch and actually wasn’t too bad. (Doing the whole polenta stirring thing to make my own just wasn’t practical)  Overall I liked this well enough, but I found it just a tad rich (even without the heavy spaghetti sauce) and too sausage-y, admittedly just a matter of personal taste.

Really great one pot meal. I made it in a wok because that was the only pan I had that was big enough to hold everything. I didn't have italian or spicy italian seasoning, so I made my own blend of dried basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary, and red pepper flakes. Homemade tomato sauce (with lots of garlic) also helped make it extra delicious. Perfect with the polenta. I served with parmesan and fresh basil on top as in the picture.

Excellent. I prefer this recipe over a couple of others I've tried where the sauce and polenta were made into a casserole. My proportions must have been off. I used a half pound of sausage, and a full twenty-four ounce jar of marinara, and my sauce was plenty chunky. A definite keeper!

The only changes I made were using mild Italian sausage (we prefer it), adding a clove of minced garlic and being generous measuring the veggies and sauce (I had a 24 oz. size of sauce so that's what I used). Not only is it delicious, but it gets points for being very quick and easy.

This was delicious! My whole family enjoyed this dish. The next time I make it, however, I will make more polenta.
