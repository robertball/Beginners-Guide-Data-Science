These were pretty quick to make. However, they seem to have too much butter (the recipe called for 1 cup). They came out very greasy and they were not gooey at all! They have a very weird texture. They tasted okay, I think the consistency and texture affected the taste.

I am not sure I would consider this quick. Melting chocolate took longer than most recipes. The brownies were good. Omitted the walnuts. Everyone at them.
