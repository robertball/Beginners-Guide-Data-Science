This recipe is always a huge hit.  One word of advice...after you put the 1st layer of cake and berries down, pour half the "pudding" mixture over top, then finish with another layer and pour the rest of the pudding mixture. The mixture is too thick to reach the bottom layer if you only pour over the top.

First off, this is the ONLY dessert I have ever made where my husband asked for seconds...and he doesn't even like dessert!  This was one of the best and most delicious recipes I have ever gotten from Allrecipes.com!  I did, however, make the following changes:
1) In place of the cool whip, I used a pint sized container of heavy cream, whipped, and flavored w/ vanilla extract.  I added approx 1 1/2 cups of the whipped cream to the custard mixture, and "frosted" the top of the trifle with the rest.
2) Instead of the blackberries, I used a 16 oz carton of frozen sliced sweetened strawberries in syrup.  I thawed it in the  microwave and spooned the syrup on the cake layers to moisten instead of the praline liqueur.
3) I made multiple layers of cake, berries and custard, instead of just one layer of cake on the bottom.
4) I used a 13 oz Entemann's All Butter Loaf Cake and it worked perfectly. 
This was SO delicious I can't even believe it!  I definitely plan on making it for family and friends in the summer, when fresh berries are in season.  Thanks for an AMAZING recipe!

Yum, yum!  This was a hit.  Definitely add the extra half cup of milk to pudding.  Next time I will layer cake and berries for an even prettier presentation.  Leave more time for berries to defrost, as well, so that the juice is well absorbed by the cake.

Absolutely outstanding recipe and sooooo simple to make. Some substitutions (or additions) I made were: cut the lb cake lengthwise in thirds, spread apricot jam on each layer, put back together, then cut into cubes. I then layered the ingredients using a different berry for each layer (fresh berries only - blackberry, raspberry, blueberry,& strawberry)- cake, berry, pudding, etc. I couldn't find any praline liqueur so I lightly drizzled caramel over the cake before adding each layer. I garnished with a big dollup of whip cream and a fanned out strawberry and then placed fresh blueberries around the edge of the bowl...it just looked so yummy and pretty!!

I used angel food cake and added fresh strawberries.  I also used 2 cups of milk in the pudding recipe, omitted the condensed milk and added 4 oz cream cheese.  It turned out great and I have had multiple requests to make it.  Thanks for a great and really easy recipe.

I skipped the praline liqueur for this recipe and served it at a barbecue and received rave reviews.  Looks pretty too!

This was my first trifle-making experience and I LOVED IT! I used angel food cake instead of pound cake, and sliced it into 3 horizontal layers. I also omitted the praline liqueur. It was delicious and all my dinner guests raved about it. I will continue to use this recipe for years. Thanks, Iron Chef!

This was a delicious desert!  I made a few changes though; I made Aunt Johnnies Pound cake also from this site.  Then, I used fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, I think fresh fruit makes a big difference.  I did add more milk to the pudding mixture as others recommended.  I couldn't find praline liqueur at the store, so I skipped it.  Everyone at our Fathers day BBQ loved it!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was soo delicious.  I used Frangelico (Italian hazelnut liqueur), and fresh strawberries instead of the blackberries, and Entemann's butter loaf.  Also, I used all milk, as suggested by someone else, and it tasted GREAT.  THANKS!!!!

Ths was great.  A bit on the sweet side.  I used frozen blueberries, raspberries and peaches.  I omitted the praline stuff (in laws don't drink) and as some mentioned I add and extra 1/2 cup of milk to the pudding.  I think next time I won't use the sweetened condensed milk and use all regular insted.  It was so pretty!!  
Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!! How simple and yet so delicious! I doubled the recipe and brought it to a family gathering and it was gone in minutes. I made it the night before and took it out of the fridge 2 hours before serving.  I used boxed yellow cake instead and really recommend that. I find the cake more flavorable than pound. I used less condensend milk (personal preference)and more milk.  I did as others suggested and soaked the berries in some suger for 20 minutes before layering.  I did not use liqueur as I didn't have any on hand but it didn't need it anyway because when you layer the berries on top of cake the juices from the berries soak nicely into the cake as it defrosts which made it so yummy.  Second time around I made homemade cool whip instead which made it even more fantastic! Really a GREAT recipe that you can easily adjust to suite your taste preference!

I'd give this recipe five stars if it did not get soggy so quickly. However, this is a great recipe. I do not drink alcohol, so I always use a bit of orange juice or a bit of berry syrup (Smucker's makes one I believe) instead. I have discovered that the oj or berry syrup maximizes the flavor of the berries, whipped cream, and custard. I would recommend starting with just a little oj or berry syrup on top of the pound cake, as the cake got soggy for me the next day (and that was when I did not even put a lot of it on). This is a great crowd pleaser, but I would be hesitant about making it a day ahead - you might have a watery, gooey, mess. I will say that if you put it in the refrigerator for four to six hours after you are done assembling it, it looks and tastes divine (that is the best time to serve it for sure). This is one of my favorite desserts to serve at parties! It is a huge crowd pleaser (and it serves a TON of people too, so that's even better. ;) less work for me!).

We were invited at the last minute to a Memorial Day get-together at a friends' house, and I'd just gotten a new trifle bowl, so of course, I had to make red, white and blue trifle :). I ran to Wally World at about 10:30 the night before and the only pound cake I could find were these eight-to-a-box mini poundcakes. I was hoping to find a lemon poundcake, or at least a Sara Lee frozen poundcake, but I think everyone had the same idea I did. I decided to do four berry layers, so I bought frozen blueberries, frozen raspberries, and frozen blackberries and fresh strawberries. I sprinkled them all with a little sugar and let them sit overnight. I decided to use cheesecake pudding (it just seemed like it'd work). Since we don't do liqueur, I decided to spread the poundcake with preserves. While I was trying to decide which one I wanted to use, I spotted a triple berry ice cream topping by Smuckers (strawberry, raspberry,blackberry) and decided on that. It's thinner than jam or jelly, so I think it'll soak into the poundcake nicely, but not turn it to mush. When I put this together tomorrow, I'm going to do traditional layers. Poundcake, blackberries,pudding, poundcake, raspberries, pudding, poundcake, blueberries, pudding, poundcake, strawberries, pudding. I've made a basic version of this before, and it's always a huge hit. I think this is a great recipe you can have a lot of fun with modifying and adding your own personal touches to. 
*It went over REALLY well. I made a huge bow

I have made this recipe multiple times and EVERYONE loves it.  In fact, my fiance has twin sisters and for their birthday "cake" they requested I make this trifle.  I do add 1 cup of fat free milk, I use the sugar free vanilla jello, omit the liquor altogether, use fat free condensed milk, angel food cake, and fat free cool whip.  I swear you can't taste a difference with this lower fat version.  This is one of my most favorite recipes!

I got this from my mom in law and it is awesome! We use one half of an angel food cake, 2 pkgs. vanilla instant pudding mixed with 3 cups milk, 1 can condensed milk and only 4 oz. size cool whip. Use 2 pkgs.(square kind) of frozen raspberries or strawberries and 1 large can of sliced peaches drained and cut in small cubes. Peaches really are great with raspberrirs! We don't use the praline syrup but lightly sprinkle the top with orange juice or ameretta. I suggest the ameretta. Then we lightly toast sliverd or sliced almonds and sprinkle on top. It's great!!!

We've made this many times, thought I'd finally add a review.  This is a killer recipe, always a hit, very forgiving.  We've used-- fresh fruit, a mango & papaya blend instead of the berries, Grand Marnier, Amaretto, Coconut Rum, left the liquer out entirely, made it full fat, non-fat, used lemon pound cake, angel food cake--it's always wonderful! Very simple, makes you look like you've slaved over it. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was SOOOO good!  Raves from everyone!  It definately tastes as good as it looks, and it looks very impressive and elegant. I made minor changes, but only because I wanted to layer this into a trifle bowl (two layers of everything), so I doubled the fruit and used an 18oz packaged pound cake.  I used fresh strawberries and blueberries, and 12oz bags of frozen raspberries and blackberries. (I also omitted the liqueur) To make more custard without having to use more pudding, I added another 3/4 cup of whipped topping and used probably 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups of milk.  I felt that this was a perfect custard consistency for our taste.  I used some of the fresh berries for garnish.  This sat refrigerated for about 6 hours and we sat it out for about 45 minutes before serving.  No frozen berries!  This was better the next day when more of the juice saturated the cake....YUM!  Next time I make this, I will use an angel food cake cubed (per hubby's request) and try to "lighten" this up a bit by using fat/sugar free ingredients as much as possible.  Thank you for a great recipe....an absolute keeper :)

This trifle is amazing. Everywhere I take this dish it is raved over. I can't find the praline liqeur, so I use a little vanilla instead. Tastes wonderful. I use more pound cake than the recipe calls for. It's just not enough. I also layer my ingredients in a trifle bowl. Much prettier presentation.

What an easy & lowfat dessert. It looks & tastes like it requires much more effort than it actually does. I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers & increased the amount of milk used, added lowfat cream cheese to the pudding mix, & omitted the licquer. I also used angelfood cake. Great dessert.

Sensational!!  So easy and absolutely delicious!!  I read one review that recommended using twinkies instead of the pound cake and they were fantastic.  Definitely use twice the amount of milk, it will make for a very creamy, very smooth custard.

didn't care for this all that much. was pretty dry using pound cake, and the pudding mixture was too thick and not creamy enough to soak into the cake.

This is good and had potential as is. But I brought it to WOW with a few changes. First off, mixing the pudding mix with condensed milk makes for a grainy custard. So that being said, I made vanilla pudding per the box instructions, using 1 c milk and 1 cup condensed milk. Then I used all fresh raspberries and bought a butter pound cake from the store. I cubed the cake all up and divided the raspberries and started layering, alternating between the pudding, berries and pound cake and sprinkled 2 TBS of the praline liquor over each layer. Topped with whipped cream and sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate curls over the top. Voila! it was beautiful and tasted wonderful!

This can be a great summer dessert!  Everyone always loves it when I make it for BBQs and summer parties.  Here's how I make it in case you find it helpful.  First I cut up the pound cake, drizzle it with orange juice and allow it to soak while I prep everything else.  I also use freshly washed strawberries and blueberries and about 16-20 oz of whipped topping.  I do create the pudding mixture as directed and then layer as follows:  cake, pudding, strawberries, whipped topping, cake, pudding, blueberries, whipped topping.  Lastly I garnish with a few blueberries and cut strawberries.  Note:  I do not use the praline liqueur.  This dish is great refrigerated over night before serving and everyone always has seconds!  Thanks for posting this delicious dessert!

This was great! I served to co-workers at a gathering. I'm only giving it 4 stars cuz I was a little disappointed that after over 15 hours in the refrigerator...I made it the night before with berries that were already slightly dethawed and it got served at 3pm the next day that everyone still got a frozen berry or two in their serving. Nonetheless they enjoyed it but next time I will let it sit out an hour or two before serving.

Made this for the Holidays.  Layered it in a trifle dish and looked great. Used several tbsp of rasberry liqueur instead of the praline...and increased the milk by 1/2 cup. Thought it actually tasted better after it sat in the fridge for a day or two, allowing the flavors a chance to blend !

This was delicious but not recommended to be left out of the fridge for an extended period of time.  It gets mushy quick.  BUt otherwise it was really good.

Great recipe.  My Bunko group really liked it.  I used fresh sliced strawberries, bosenberries and blueberries.  Patriotic theme!  May try different layering next time. Yummmmmmyyyy!

I didn't use pound cake or angel food cake, just regular cake I had frozen overnight when my first attempt at a ladybug birthday cake failed. It was fabulous, adults and children alike gobbled it up. Great way to use up an otherwise ruined cake.

I'm not going to give this the full 5 stars because I felt like the sugar of the sweetened condensed milk made it sweeter than it needed to be. It could just be my taste/preference, but I think I'll just use vanilla pudding next time or something. Other than that you can't really go wrong with pound cake and fruit. :)

I whipped up real whipping cream because I hate the manufactured taste of cool whip.  I also layered this whole things so that all the cake wasn't on the bottom, and all the fruit was on top. I started with the pound cake, then the pudding, then the berries, then the whip cream.  I did this sequence 3 times.  Then for the very top, I garnished the final layer of whipping cream with a few whole strawberries & raspberris, and a couple mint leaves.  Looked gorgeous!

I am a picky eater, and I LOVED this. Everyone said it was delicious. Nothing bad to say about it. I did thaw the berries before hand and do make sure you buy the sweetened fruit. The un sweet were too bitter, but other than that this is a keeper here!

I found this recipe while searching for something different for my weekly "cook" at my parents house.  My mother no longer cooks desserts and it is my father's favorite day of the week when I bring a dessert.  I used angel food cake instead of pound and added strwaberries to the mix.  I did not use a trifle dish, just a large bowl.  I did whip my own whipped cream.  My father has requested that I make this "anytime I want".  It kept very well in the frig and he enjoyed it all week long.

FABULOUS (and I'm a chocoholic!) At others' suggestions, my changes were: used store-bought angel food cake, fresh blueberries, strawberries and diced peaches (soaked the peaches in ~4-5 T peach schnapps for ~20 min,) used two 3.4 oz boxes cheesecake pudding combined with enough low-fat cool-whip and milk to make it creamy; omitted sw/cond milk; topped with cool-whip and blueberries; layered as a trifle, making 3 layers of each - assembled the night before serving. Lots of "oohs" and "aahs" and recipe requests - even from a few men!

Well I probably butchered this with substitutions in an effort to make it as low-fat as possible.  So if you're thinking of trying the same thing, don't bother!  I used angelfood cake, rather than pound cake; all raspberries; amaretto; fat-free instant pudding; fat-free Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk; and low-fat whipped topping.  The texture of the custard was just sort of indescribably gross.  It just wasn't a great dessert, but I doubt that it's Iron Chef's fault.

This was delicious! I watch my fat intake so I made a few adjustments. I used Entenmann's fat free marble pound cake, fresh blueberries and strawberries, skipped the liquer, used skim milk, lite whipped topping, and fat free sweetened condensed milk. The custard layer was so rich and creamy. Everyone wanted the recipe, especially when they heard it was lowfat. Thanks, Iron Chef. This definitely tops my favorite dessert list!

This was very good.  I made it the night before and it really worked well.  I exchanged the sweetened condensed milk for skim evaporated milk and Splenda for a lighter version.

I brought this to a ladies' dessert night and it disappeared quickly.  It was delicious.  I wanted a big bowl full so I combined both a pound cake and an angel food cake, added an extra pudding mix, tripled the regular milk, and used two 16 oz. bags of mixed berries. It was so easy!

This dessert was a big hit with my dinner guests!All the hints were helpful...extra milk to pudding, do leave time for berries to defrost - it tastes better absorbed in the angel food cake.  I will add liquor next time, dinner guest commented they thought the liquor would bring out the fruit even more.  Great recipe!

This was a very nice trifle. It actually tasted better after 2 days in the fridge. I used frozen raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries, and plan to make this again in the summer with fresh fruit. Great recipe thank you.

I made this last night. I used angel food cake, drizzled cherry brandy over it, 2- 16 oz bags frozen mixed berries & made the pudding mixture with 2 C milk & no condensed milk. I think it would be better with white chocolate pudding mix & maybe some cream cheese as some people have suggested. I also think it would be better layered. My husband kept asking why I wasn't layering it, he thought the way the recipe says to do it is weird. I think it could be a 5-star recipe with improvements. "Raspberry Trifle" from this site is still my favorite.

Very easy and delicious - I used fresh fruit and skipped the liqueur. I think next time I would alternate cake, berries, and pudding mixture a couple of times rather than just having all of the cake at the bottom and all of the pudding mixture at the top.

Delicious. As others suggested, leave plenty of time after making it for the fruit to thaw. Otherwise they are a little crunchy. Also slightly better the second day. Yum!

I use Grand Marnier instead of the praline liqueur.  The first time I served this, some of the berries were still frozen - even though I followed the time frame on the recipe.  Now, I take it out of the frige about 1/2 hour before I serve it.  It looks so pretty and tastes so rich.

This was so easy and so delicious. My husband good not stop talking about it. I used 1/3 fresh fruit and 2/3 frozen. I used white choclate pudding in place of vanilla and also used white choclate liqour in place of praline-because I could not find it.

Made this for my family's big Christmas Eve get together... a big hit! Did not have the praline liqueur so used OJ instead. Used homemade whip cream instead of the cool whip. Made 2 layers in a bowl instead of the one. Put chopped nuts on top. Sooooo good!

Beautiful in a glass bowl. I believe you made a typo on the pudding size; not 5-oz but maybe 1.5-oz?! Delicious. Will definetly make again. And again!

I used sliced jellyroll poundcake and lined the glass dish to give the trifle a 'pinwheel' design, but I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delightful.  Thank you!

I've made this twice-once with fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries and it was wonderful.  Even better next time w/ frozen blueberries and raspberries and fresh peaches. Pretty and you don't need the liqueur! Got raves from the inlaws-they even took a picture of it!  Definitely use angel food cake.

If you wish to enjoy something try this for your next party.  My guest (10) all enjoyed this.  My husband is eating the left over as we speak. 
I made one change:  Hostess Twinkies for the cake.  
I prepared it four hours prior to my party, and kept it refrigerator for nearly 6 hours.  When Berry Trifle  was served ---- it cut like a cake.

used the custard from this recipe with Angel food cake squares, crushed pineapple, bananas, strawberries and blueberries and it was excellent.  It also works with sugar free ingredients.  The custard is very thick, so use half to top first layer and half for top, as it will not ooze down.  Love the custard part, best I've made.

Fantastic.  Made it for a large 4th of July picnic.  The only dessert that was eaten down to the last bite.  The only changes were fresh fruit vs frozen:  strawberries, blueberries & blackberries, & frangelico liqueur instead of praline.  It makes a beautiful presentation.

This dessert is easy and delicious. I always serve it at summer parties and use any combo of fresh or frozen fruit available. Last time I made it with a mocha liquor that I had on hand and it was perfect. Store bought pound cake stays cubed better than my homemade (too crumbly). It is a great red, white and blue dessert for the 4th of July.

I have made this trifle several times and am asked for the recipe each time. I do prefer to use fresh fruit since frozen fruit seems mushy to me.  Fabulous looking and delicious.

This was very, very good and so easy and quick to make.  Will definitely become a summer favorite in our home!  I used Angel Food Cake instead of pound cake.  I used the berries called for in the recipe, plus a bag of strawberries too!  Deleted the liqueur.  The only thing I would change is perhaps not using the sweetened condensed milk.  It was very, very sweet.  I also am going to try it with cheesecake pudding next time!

Yum! Made this morning of BBQ, was just barely frozen in center by dinner time, so be sure to leave plenty of time for defrosting! Sprinkled 2T. blackberry brandy over cake instead of praline liq. I also used lemon pudding instead of vanilla. 
Recieved many compliments. Will definitly make again!

Great with fresh berries -- I took the basics of this recipe and changed according to what looked good in the store. I sliced fresh strawberries, added a little sugar and let them sit for a couple hours to get juicy. I made the trifle the night before so the cake absorbed some of the juice. I even made a mistake and added all the cool whip at once, and it turned out fine.

Delicious, super easy and a huge hit with my husband's family. I took the advise from other reviews and used amaretto instead of praline liqueur and angel food cake instead of pound. Also, I didn't use the condensed milk, I just made the vanilla pudding and mixed it with the still partially frozen whipped topping.

I have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I think it's so impressive looking also.  The only thing I changed is I always use fresh berries and add some banannas also and I use fresh whipping cream that I whip and then add the condensed milk and pudding to and it comes out very creamy.
Thanks for sharing the recipe

YUMmy!!  I made this last night and it was very good!  I used twinkies (as was suggested by someone else) but I think I'll use angel food cake next time.  The twinkies make it a little heavy.  I didn't use any condensed milk - just regular milk but adding whipped cream to the pudding made it very light and creamy!  I can't wait to try it with fresh fruit.  Great recipe!

I had to use angle food cake instead of pound cake.  Everyone went crazy over it!  You may want to add a little extra milk into the custard mix because it is a little stiff.  I recommed this for family gatherings.

Love it...I have changed it up using a raspberry schnapps in the bottom. I also have made this using chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla. Both are a big hit at family picnics or for when I go over to the neighbors....

This is a great recipe that is easily modified to fit your own tastes and preferences. I made this for our engagement party and it was gone so fast my fiance and I never got any so I made it later that week just for us.  I never used the liqueur because I didn't have any on hand and it doesn't miss it.

This did not work out for me.  One small box of pudding is one ounce, this recipe calls for a 5 ounce box of pudding.  I bought 5 boxes of pudding, added 1/2 cup of milk and 1 can of condensed milk and cool whip.  This was like cement...am i missing something here?  I tried adding more milk, but it was still too thick...and I only used 3 boxes of pudding because I thought it wasn't right.  I spent $40 on this...what a waste.  Sorry...I guess I must be confused :(

I made this for my sisters 40th birthday party.  What a hit!  I received so many compliments!  I used frozen strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.  Could not find praline liquer in my small town, so used the "juices" from the fruit - worked just as well.  I topped with a couple of fresh mint leaves....AWESOME!

I brought this to a barbeque and everyone raved about how good it was. I used fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, and also 2 bananas. My husband asked me to make another the next day so we would have some to eat at home. Very Good. A keeper!

I would rate this a 5, but I made a few changes after trying it the first time to spike up the flavors; Place the frozen berries in a bowl and sprinkle with sugar (instead of using the liquor), while those are soaking cube the poundcake & assemble custard mixture. I used 2/3 of the condensed milk and added more milk to the vanilla pudding before adding the cool whip. Use 1/3 pound cake, sprinkle berries and spoon custard over berries, countinue layers. My family said they would have like the berries to have been a little more frozen, so next time I will let it defrost for 3 hours, not 5.

Served this as dessert on Chrismas Day. Out of this world! Did sub condensed milk for whipping cream as we don't like condensed milk sweetness. Was still good on 3rd day! Great recipe.

This recipe was excellent. Wanted to make a 4th of July dessert - this is what I did. Used Sour Cream Pound Cake III from this site for the prepared cake (but only used half the cake and froze the rest to use later). Cube the cake and place half in bottom of bowl, top with half of the fresh blueberries & strawberries, pour half the pudding mix over it then repeat the layers. Top with whip cream. Skipped the liqueur - didn't have it on hand.

I used this recipe as a base, but I guess I ought to submit my own, since it hardly resembled the original. Instead of pound cake, I used vanilla cake mix (didn't take all of both layers). I also used 2 boxes of cheesecake pudding, mixed with 1 3/4 C milk and folded in fresh whipped cream (with a bit of sugar and vanilla). Like others, I also used fresh berries and layered it instead of dumping it all on top. You really can't mess up this type of trifle. Yum!

Wonderful! It received rave reviews at a recent dinner party. I made with most the variants suggested by others (added extra milk to the pudding, layered the berries and topping, spread the pound cake with rasberry jam) and skipped the liquor and used homemade whipped cream.

I made this for a family occasion.  This was an easy, delicious, and attractive dessert.  I also layered the cake and bluberries and raspberries and blackberries.  There were many kids at my party so I omitted any alcohol and it was still delicious.  I put a berry on top to top it off.  I enjoyed it and so did my guests.  I will make this again.

This is great.  I made mine with angel food cake and reduced-fat condensed milk and whipped topping.  I don't think it hurt the flavor at all.  However, I thought the custard was a little too sweet and rich, so I mixed in a lot of the whipped topping to tone it down a little.  I took this to a dinner and our friends LOVED it.  This makes a large amount:  there were six of us and we all had seconds and I still had leftovers to take home.  I had some for breakfast the next day and surprisingly, it was not separated or soggy.  Yum!

This was so easy to make! I used more milk as suggested by other members. My trifle bowl was not big enough to accomadate the blackberries. I also used angel food cake, which i was very happy about. I used fresh berries and made real whipped cream, which I layered. This turned out beautiful, I made it for my family renioun. It keept well outside which I was concerned about (it was over 90 degrees). I did put it together the night before, I did put just whipped cream on the top of the last layer of custard. Next time I will make blueberry and strawberry sauces to put on the cake.

Made this for Easter dinner and there wasnt a speck left in the bowl. I only changed two things slightly, I used fresh strawberries that I marinated in some sugar for about 2 hours before I used them, I also used Frozen blueberries and rasberries. And I put some fresh strawberries and blueberries on top. Next family dinner I was already asked to bring 2....
This was the perfect dessert, not too sweet but very very delicious and EASY!

I made this with Aunt Johnnie's pound cake from this site and used amaretto in place of the praline liqueur.  It was absolutely delcious and beautiful too. I will make this again and again--if you like fruity desserts you MUST try this recipe. Was even better after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Thanks for sharing!!

I would give this recipe 100 stars if I could!!  I have made it 5 times already and have probably been asked for the recipe by 15 people!  It is absolutely delicious!!  However, I have made a few variations.  For the pound cake, I used a cream cheese pound cake recipe I found on this website.  It has almond extract in it which is wonderful with the praline liqueur (I have also substituted with almond liqueur).  Instead of vanilla pudding, I have also used cheesecake flavored pudding.  It is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  Definitely try it .... you'll be glad you did!!!

I have made this dozens of times and everyone loves it!  As per suggestions, I use angel food cake, make layers instead of all in one, omit liqueur and condensed milk, and add one full cup of milk. I also let the dessert sit overnight in fridge to thaw out berries. I leave out strawberries and prefer juicier berries like raspberries and blackberries - it gives a nicer taste.  I also bought a larger container of whipped topping.

Delicious! Not at all mushy or runny. The custard firmed up nicely, and the whole dish had a sweet, fruity flavor - not heavy or overpowering. I used a mix of fresh and frozen fruit. I also had to double the recipe to fill my trifle dish. I'll definitely make this one again!

This was an excellent, easy, yet somewhat healthy dessert, that everyone loved! I took it to a company party and it was well loved. You could either layer the ingredients or just pile them on once for each. It's great either way!

This was fantastic!!!  I made an "adults only" version for a 50th birthday party and everyone raved about it.  I used lemon pound cake, mixed frozen berries with fresh berries.  Also added raspberry liqueur and 1 tbsp of sugar to the berries and let it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator. Assembled everything into wine glasses and served. Beautiful presentation.

I didn't use praline liquor (had no idea what that was), I used 2 3.5 oz packages of instant vanilla pudding mix and a 1 lb. pound cake. I also used slightly more frozen berries which I thawed in the fridge before I assembled it. I sprinkled the top with fresh blueberries and it was really pretty for Easter.

This trifle was a hit with our family of 6.  We used Angel Food Cake and pinched it apart.  Instead of praline liqueur we drizzled the berry/cake mixture with maple syrup...  Also - we found the need to make the vanilla pudding mixture a bit thinner for pouring by adding a little more milk and we used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding.  Love this!!!

Excellent recipe.  I added the Praline Liqueur
 (2 TB) to the pudding / whipped cream mixture instead of drizzling over the fruit.  Gave it a faint, but distinctive flavor.

This recipe is so great because you can keep everything on hand in the freezer or pantry and it goes together in a jiffy.  My only change... I used either amaretto or if trying to go non-alchoholic, amaretto coffee flavoring syrup, instead of praline liqueur.

I used leftover pound cake to make individual trifles.  I also used cheesecake flavored pudding.  Turned out to be a great summertime dessert that we all enjoyed.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ.  It was a huge hit.  I still have people calling me for the recipe!  The only thing I did different is, I used fresh whipped cream rather than cool whip and used frozen and fresh strawberries.  I liked the frozen berries due to the juices.  This is a keeper, but be prepred to hand out this recipe.  People will rave!

This recipe was excellent. I added a drop of lemon extract to the pudding mixture as well as the cool whip - the hint of lemon worked well with the berries. Also, I couldn't find praline liquor, so I made a simple syrup and added a teaspoon of hazelnut liquor to it (and I used a bit more than the recommended 2 teaspoon sprinkling over the berries). This was wonderful - I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe! I did swap Amaretto for the praline liquor and make more layers so the pudding is on the bottom too.  Otherwise... perfection!

This recipe is great!  I did however make some modifications.  I used Angel food cake instead of the pound cake.  Used some orange juice and some strawberry syrup to moisten the cake instead of the praline liqueur.  I also added extra cool whip than called for in order to create more layers.  Then I decorated the top with fresh fruit.  I took it to my work for my boss's birthday party potluck and it got rave reviews.

I followed many of the suggestions for this recipe using angel food cake, additional layering, fat free sweetened condensed milk, additional milk and whipped topping with the cheesecake pudding.  I also used the amaretto liqueur.  Maybe there were just too many substitutions and I should have stuck to the original recipe, but I found this very boring. I wouldn't make it again.

This was so easy and tasted great! The only problem is pudding doesn't come in 5 oz boxes. I used cheesecake pudding and also used 4 berries, raspberries, strawberries, blueberies and blackberries.

This was really good and everyone enjoyed it. I didn't use the liquer but I don't think it really needs it. Nice light dessert for the hot summer days.

INCREDIBLE!  Instead of Praline liquor, I used blackberries soaked in amaretto (1 week) because I had them around.  I also used low fat condensed sweet milk, low fat cool whip and non-fat jello pudding.  This was a big hit!

i love this recipe for its taste and simplicity. did without the liquor and couldn't tell the difference. any frozen berry mix will do. the best part of this dessert is when the berry juices soak into the cake. also, it's best served cold.

This dessert was wonderful - 10 stars! Using fat free sweetened condensed milk, fat free whipped topping and fat/sugar free pudding made it guilt free and did not change the taste one bit!  Wish I could find fat free pound cake! Could not find the liquore but did not miss it.   Used a good quality frozen berry with no juice, I think this is important.

I made this for dinner guests last night and I thought it turned out great.  Everybody was pretty full from dinner so we didn't indulge too much but I got lots of compliments for it.  I left out the liquer because I didn't have any, and I used lemon pudding because I was out of Vanilla.  I really like the lemon flavor though.  I even ate some of the leftovers for breakfast this  morning (real nutrious, I know) and it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just took this to a barbecue and got rave reviews and everyone yummed it up.  Left out the liqueur as we had lots of kids eating it.  Looks pretty and tastes yummy and makes a nice big bowl.  I used Sarah Lee's frozen pound cake and cheesecake pudding per other reviewers and did 2 layers of cake and berries with the custard on top.  So easy to make! Thanks Iron Chef!

My husband said this was the best new dessert recipe I've made. Not only is it beautiful to look at but it was truly wonderful. I read all the reviews and omitted the liqueur since I didn't have time to go buy some and I used cheesecake pudding as suggested by some. This was absolutely fabulous and will make it again. My husband wants me to try the recipe with fresh peaches when they in.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good I used 12 oz bags of strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries and a 16oz pound cake so I could layer in my triffle bowl. Also added a little milk like others. Make sure to leave plenty of time for thawing mine was still frozen a little even though I made it several hours ahead.

Excellent!  My dinner guests loved it.  Will definitely make again, but maybe create layers of the ingredients for a better visual affect in the trifle bowl.  Thanks!  Here it is 2008, and I still make this frequently, and I do layer it.  It is always a hit!

AWESOME!  Made this for labor day picnic and it was a hit.  Used a combination of fresh and frozen fruit and ammeretto liquer.  Easiest dessert I've ever made!  Everyone had 2 helpings.  Thanks!

Very good dessert!  I only used fresh blueberries.  I didn't have praline liqueur - so I very generously used "Irish Mist" liqueur instead.  Thanks for the quick recipe!!!!

This is my ONLY non-chocolate dessert I make.  It is delicious!  If in a hurry used thawed berries.  I also sprinkle extra blueberries on top of the whipped cream for appearance.  I use a 16 oz pound cake and there is more then enough filling and fruit to cover it!

Fabulous!  This trifle is light and full of flavor, and presentation is great too.  I used half of a raspberry swiss roll for the sponge, 2 bags raspberries and one blackberries, Grand Marnier for the liquer, lowfat milk and a little heavy cream in the pudding and Lite Cool Whip for the topping.I only gave it 4 stars because even though I made it 5 hours in advance and kept it the fridge the blackberries were still frosty when it was time to serve.  I won't worry about making it too far in advance next time!  Thanks for the recipe it was a hit!

Wow! This was the overall response when I served this dessert.  I couldn't find the praline liquer, but the clerk at the liquor store recommended a mocha caramel liquer instead.  It turned out great.  As a matter of fact, I only had one bite, because it went so quickly.

Made this using chocolate pudding mix rather than vanilla and only strawberries but otherwise exactly as written.  I needed an extra container of Cool Whip though, I wouldn't have had enough for some visible layers without it.
Amazing flavor and so easy.  This is a keeper - thanks for sharing!!!

Great recipe.  Easy dessert to make.  Changes I made:  1.  added frozen strawberries.  2.  I layered them differently.  Cake, then berries, then pudding, then whipped cream, then repeat.   Came out great and looked delicious. 3.  I also sliced the sound can in half length wise and added a raspberry jelly to it, then cubed the pound cake for the bottom and missile layers.  4.  I did not use as much whipped cream in the pudding mix.  Using whipped cream as directed left the pudding very thick and did not flow down to the cake.

I made very little changes to this recipe, but I did use fresh fruit appose to  frozen, and used fresh whipping cream instead of canned.  
I did double the custard because I made mine for 30, and added some heavy cream with my milk, condensed milk and pudding mixture, I did leave out the almond milk.  I had to leave out the praline liquor someone was allergic, so added some caramel vodka.  
Everyone loved it and asked for more.  This is a definite keeper and will make it again.

I have made this every year for the last 5.  It's a huge hit for the 4th.  I use fresh strawberries and blueberries since they are in season with low fat coolwhip and fall in our red white blue theme.   I put the pudding mixture between each layer of cake and fruit.  I do make a double batch so i dont run out.   This year I did switch to fat free condensed milk and will update on the taste.

This should be a 4 1/2 - but I made a number of changes. First, I used ladyfingers instead of pound cake, as it's summer and I wanted it to be lighter. I dipped the ladyfingers in amaretto and layered them flat. then did a layer of the pudding mixture, then a layer of berries. I did ladyfingers/pudding/berries/ladyfingers/pudding/berries/lady-fingers/pudding/berries.  If I do it again, I will leave out the cool whip (it leaves sort of a coating on your tongue) and might cut the condensed milk in half. I used fresh berries -- strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I took this to a dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. My son just ate 3 helpings of the leftovers! All in all, a lovely summer supper dessert!

Loved this! Was a big hit and easy to make. I bought a combination pack of frozen strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and black berries.  I also poured the mixture on each layer instead of just over the top. And instead of a praline liquor I used a chocolate liquor and it was delicious!

I've made this trifle many times leaving out the liquor because my kids eat it (although it's such a small amount it probably wouldn't matter but I take it to pot lucks Sometimes too so I leave it out to be on the safe side) and its not a liquor I have on hand. It's so good. The creamy filling is spot on. So easy to make. Very pretty in the bowl. Makes a huge amount!

I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla and fresh strawberries and blueberries because that's what I had on hand. I didn't use any liquor, but I macerated the berries in simple syrup before I added them to the trifle. It was really good. Oh and I used angel food cake because that's what I had bought at the store. I'll be using this recipe again for the summertime.

Made some of the suggested changes and this dessert was amazing! Layered it in a trifle bowl - didn't have the liqueur but used berry jam mixed with a little water to make a syrup instead. I also did not use cool whip but used my own whipped cream and I used fresh berries mashed with a little powered sugar to sweeten.  I used one full cup of low fat milk and the can of sweetened milk - the custard was sweet so I only sweetened the whip cream for the top (not the whip cream that was folded into the custard).  The texture and flavor was like a cross between cheesecake, strawberry shortcake and tiramisu. Delicious!

I liked it.  I used a gluten free cake from betty crocker and the cake didn't get soggy.  (Gluten Free winds up being denser than a regular white cake).  I made my own whipping cream and berries out of the garden.  I made it for a dinner party this summer and it was a hit.

My husband requested a berry dessert for his birthday and this is what i made.  He loved it!  I couldn't find the praline liqueur, but used a pecan-praline ice cream topping instead.

This is so refreshing! I left out the praline liquer (didn't have any) and used angel food cake mix instead of pound cake (just a personal preference), but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It wasn't too sweet, very light and airy. Make sure to make it the day before so the frozen berries have time to thaw and drip all over the cake pieces. It's a great summertime dessert and looks beautiful too!

I made this trifle for Easter and my family loved it! The whole thing was gone by the end of the day. I did not put in the praline liqueur and I used fresh fruit instead of the frozen fruit, which people seemed to appreciate. I also did several layers of the cake, berries, and pudding to make for a nice presentation.  Great recipe!

Great dessert.  I used an Absolutely Almond pound cake from Tastefully Simple, 1 cup of milk and the sweetened sliced strawberries following others suggestions.  It was a hit at my party and I left with an empty dish!

I used a triple berry preserves and spread it on the pound cake before cubing it.  I used fresh blackberries in the first layer, frozen raspberries in the second layer, fresh blueberries in the third layer, and decorated the top of the dessert with sliced strawberries and fresh blueberries.  I used cheesecake flavored instant pudding.  This was served at a Father's Day cookout and was incredible.

This is a great easy recipe for a tasty dessert!  My only modification was that I didn't add cool whip on top b/c my trifle bowl was already full with the other ingredients.

Delicious!  I highly recommend that you do 3 separate layers (of cake, caramel *I skipped the liquor* drizzled, 1 kind of berry, pudding mixture). It breaks everything up into even layers and looks beautiful. Yum!

Made this for our annual family picnic.  What a hit!  It was very easy to make and tasted great.   I used sliced strawberries instead of raspberries and all the fruit was fresh, not frozen.  Took other reviewers suggestions and used lite or low fat condensed milk and whipped topping.  Still delicious!  Will definitely make again.

I used a three berry blend frozen fruit mix and banana pudding( I was out of everything else). I got rave reviews at the party I took it to. I have been asked for the recipe several times already. It's a keeper. So simple. Have the kids help.

I love this recipe, it was ecxellent. I took this to a Chinese New Year event, so I omitted the liqueur. My desert was the first to go and the entire night people were telling me how wonderful it was and asking me for the recipe, which I happily shared. Thanks Iron Chef, it was the talk of the evening.

This recipe was a success. I used angelfood cake instead o pound cake and didn't add the alcohol because I know the kids would eat it too.  It disappear within 10 mins. My family loved it and are asking me to make it again soon. I think next time I will use fresh berries instead of frozen and make a sauce tp go with it.

This was delicious, attractive and easy.  I didn't have praline liquer, so I used Frangelico (hazelnut) and was very pleased.  It got rave reviews from my friends and coworkers.  I also lightened it a little by using a store bought angel food cake and light cool whip.  I thought the top looked a little plain, so I tossed some blanched almonds on there - not too many, just enough to look nice and not change the flavor.

Fantastic recipe!  Praline liqueur was expensive, so I mixed brandy into bottled caramel sauce.   This sauce is delicious on vanilla or praline ice cream, too.

Truly awesome!  I am a chocoholic, and yet I think this deserves 5 stars!  I do use a 16oz. pound cake, but there still is plenty of the custard filling!  I also recommend using the berries frozen as it keeps the dessert cold for traveling, and is a nice texture if still a bit frozen when you eat it!  I recommend this, and make it, often!

due to a weird supply of ingredients on hand, i had to basically come up with my own version of trifle composed of different recipes. i used the custard from this recipe.. and it was sooo good!! definitely making this custard again in the future.
