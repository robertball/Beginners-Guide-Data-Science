I have been making this the exact same way for years and always comes out great. Point is to make sure that the pork stays in the "juice." I always put my roast in frozen so maybe that makes the extra liquid needed to keep the pork moist. My family loves this.  Sometimes we even add potatoes to the slow cooker.

If you want real Bavarian flavor, you have to brown the seasoned roast/pork ribs on all sides before adding to the Sauerkraut. It locks in the juices and flavor.You can use the broiler to do this. Add the drippings also to the Kraut. No garlic please !!!. You can grate an apple and add it to sweeten the Sauerkraut. Bayleafs (1 or 2) are a must and so are the pepper corns  and Karaway seeds. If the Sauerkraut is to vinegary, rinse it until you have the desired flavor or just simply add an extra can of water. Remember, the longer you cook it, the better the taste.   Every one loves my Sauerkraut...Happy cooking

I actually learned to make this when working for a roofing company in South FL at a "tar kettle" cook off.  I use 2 bags of kraut and it keeps the pork tender and juicy.  As my DH doesn't eat kraut I wrap the pok loin in cheese cloth so it isn't "contaminated" - silly man eats the pork and potatos like there is no tomorrow! I don't add anything other that the pork, potatos and kraut.  The juice and pork season each other nicely and don't really require anything else. And 8 hours is about the right time (for my slow cooker anyway). Darn, now I'll have to make this sometime this week!

Cooked this on low for 8 hrs. (minimum time stated)and the pork was dry and overcooked - when I tried to slice it, it shredded into threads and fell apart. The pork was virtually flavorless.  I thought about making it again with more seasonings for flavor and reducing the cooking time, but 8 hrs. seemed absolutely perfect for the potatoes - they were not mushy/overcooked so reducing the cooking time might cause undercooked potatoes.

This was perfect! I subbed red potatoes (with skin) for the white peeled potatoes and am still amazed that such an effortless dish came out so incredibly delicious. The pork was so moist it was falling apart, the potatoes were soft but not mushy, I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

I read most of the reviews and there were complaints of the roast being dry after cooking. I added a can of chicken broth, and it was very moist. I also added a little onion and that gave it some more flavor. My bf love this recipe.

I grew up eating pork ‘n kraut and have cooked it using all kinds of different methods.  It's important to know how your crock pot cooks when it comes to cooking meat.  This particular recipe calls for an 8 – 10hr cook time.  That works great if I’m using my 30+yr old crock pot, but my 2yr old crock pot will have this done in 4 hours because it cooks 10x hotter than my old one.   If there is one thing you don’t want to do, that is over cook a pork loin because it gets really, really dry if it’s overcooked.  Another option to consider would be to use a pork butt roast.  It gets tender and juicy the longer it cooks and isn’t as easy to overcook as a loin roast.

My mom used to make the pork in a pressure cooker - this is now my preferred method!  I like to use boneless country-style pork ribs (goes on sale at Safeway a lot).    This is the part I feel passionately about - DO NOT PUT THE KRAUT IN UNTIL CLOSE TO THE END.  I hate kraut that's been pulverized to mush.  I poured in the brine at the beginning of cooking, putting in the kraut 1hr before the finish just until it warmed.  The meat/potatoes do taste better after it's had time to sit with the kraut, but you really don't want to cook it that long together.    Things I feel less strongly about:  Try fooling with the amount of caraway - I like it more subtle, around 1t.  Try a bit of apple cider vinegar to brighten it if you need.  Try searing the meat before you put it in.

This almost the same receipe my mother used to make when I was growing up. I remember is fondly. Only difference is we didn't have slower cookers in those days.  I will make this today,leaving out caraway seeds and browing meat before cooking. Thanks for the receipe. It brings back great memories.

I am rarely disappointed in my Allrecipes recipe but this one was terrible.  It had no taste although I salted, peppered, used onion powder and garlic salt.  The meat was dry and although the potatoes held their shape, they were very close to inedible.  If I were critiqueing this recipe, I would anticipate that the sauerkraut liquid was overwhelming.  This recipe is going in the trash can

i agree with one review that you must add peppercorns, caraway seed and bay leaf to give it that bavarian flare.  browning the meat is very important for added flavour and moistness.  this is an easy recipe and is especially good on those cold winter nights.  a keeper for my family who, i might add are german on both sides.

My boyfriend conned me into making pork roast one night.  I don't care for pork in the slightest, but I tried this recipe and it was really good.  I'll definitely make this one again!

loved this dish. My nephew loved it and he was sworn against it! I did modify it by pouring a 1/2 cup of vinegar over while cooking and it was delish! Don't forget to top the kraut with apples.

Made this last night.  It was very good.  I sliced the potatoes into thin slices, and did not use garlic.  I did season the pork roast w/ garlic pepper/ salt/ and thyme.  I used Bavarian Kraut and left out the caraway seeds as they are already in the kraut.  Put it on at about 9AM and we ate at 5:30.  Pork was amazingly tender as were the potatoes.  Very good!!  Next time I will add some baby carrots also.  Easy and good!  Leftovers, too!!

Wonderful smell and taste!!  Those that didn't use the Caraway or Saurerkraut.....disregard their ratings and comments.....those 2 indredients are what gives this recipe all the flavor and pizazz!!!!    Though I think highly of a plain old tender pork roast with a little salt.....this recipe is all about the Sauerkraut and caraway (a flavor which I have only recently acquired a taste for). I followed recipe exactly, with only a few minor differences (not changes).....my roast had a bone in it, I used unpeeled baby white potatoes, and my large can of Sauerkraut was only 28 oz.  I am surprised that so many remarked about dryness.....my roast was so tender and moist, it litterally fell apart with the gentle touch of one fork and with a bit more liquid could have been a soup!!  I ended up shredding it completely and mixing it in with the sauerkraut and potatoes, so the dish became ONE!  I cooked for 10 hours in the crock (unfortunately, I started it too late in the day, so it didn't finish until 9pm last night, but I picked and picked and tasted and retasted until I finally had to put it away.....can't wait to have it for dinner tonight!  Really good flavor and aroma!!

This recipe is ok-BUT- I always add a large onion and brown sugar, about a 1/4 cup. Don't forget to brown the meat on all sides, adds flavor. Salt and pepper while browning.

This was a nice change. The potatoes picked up all the flavor from the sauerkraut and garlic. I loved it. The meat was super tender. I did not have caraway seeds so maybe next time i'll get some. I was surprised the potatoes did not go mushy at all they stayed nice and firm but were cooked through. I will make this again.

I made this and really enjoyed it.  The only thing I added was a couple of bay leaves.  Great flavor--makes great ruben sandwiches with the leftovers!

I've been making this for years because it's so easy and so good!  My husband prefers using sauerkraut that comes in a jar because the flavor just seems to be better.  Depending on how big your slow cooker is...and the amount of pork you're cooking...you can use up to two jars.  (Use the large jars that hold the same amount of sauerkraut that the large cans do).  If you want a milder sauerkraut flavor, however, cut your sauerkraut liquid in half and add water for that other half, instead.  Or just use the sauerkraut and water...no sauerkraut liquid at all.  Believe me, the flavor will still be there.   Make sure your pork is almost completely covered by the liquid you've put in.  This way it will be moist and just fall apart when it's done!  I love the carraway seeds but if you don't have any, don't worry...salt and pepper works just fine!  (Add an onion or a bit of garlic or even Pickling Spice if you're in the mood for them but they're not really necessary).  You can also add a level teaspoon or two of regular sugar (or a half-packet to one packet of Sweet N Low) if you find the liquid to be a bit too tart or bitter for your tastebuds.  Then add your potatoes when the pork seems to be about half done.  I like to wait until the meat is falling off the bone before telling my husband to "come and get it!"  :)

Left the potatoes out but followed the recipe in every other way. It was Wonderful! Meat was juicy and so tender it almost made a knife "optional". Will be making this again very soon.

Fabulous comfort food!  I didn't have caraway seeds, but I did use Polish kraut which has them in it.  I sauteed a large onion in light butter and threw that in also.  This was so good I can't wait for it to be cold so I can make it again, the whole family loved it!!!!

I opted to leave the potatoes out and just do mashed taters on the side. I also doubled the amount of meat and sauerkraut. Even though I browned the pork on all sides in a skillet before placing it in the crock pot, it still was really dry. There was plenty of liquid in the pot from the kraut. I also had to chop my whole caraway seeds with a sharp knife (the whole seeds get into my hubby's teeth). It works, but be careful of flying bits of caraway seed! I will make this recipe again because even though my meat came out dry it is worth another shot. Thanks for the recipe.

Sear the roast first on all sides.  Drain the kraut and add a can of beer instead. Also add a sliced peeled apple to the kraut.

kraut/potatoes had a very good flavor...smelled delish all day in the crock, however the pork was a little dry and lacking.  I will experiment per other reviews next time.  Not counting this one out just yet, but i found that the pork does need a little sumtin, sumtin to spruce it up.

I have searched every sauerkraut receipe you have and couldn't believe that there were none that added tomatos!  I was brought up on sauerkraut, my grandmother was slavic, but was married to a German and she used pork shoulder, browned before cooking, plenty of onions sliced, sauerkraut and canned tomatos.  The tomatos sweeten the sauerkraut without having to add sugar.  Mom sometimes used caraway seeds too and then made fluffy dumplings for the first night.  After dinner, she would boil small potatoes in their skin, peel them and stick them down in the liquid and sauerkraut along with some hot dogs.  This would be refrigerated for a day or two, and then warmed up for a second, but slightly different meal.  Absolutely divine.  I make this for about 40 people so use pork loin only because it slices more uniformly and I don't have to worry about bones.  Also I cook it on top the stove as I will be making so much.

The roast turned out incredibly tender. It wasn't very pretty, though.  The sauerkraut was okay, but the potatoes were horrible. We threw them out.  They were a tad over done and the flavor from the sauerkraut in/on them was not very good.

This recipe is OK. Good recipe for a busy day when the slow cooker saves time. Potatoes were done, but still seemed kind of hard. Used country'style pork ribs instead of a roast, that was good.

I've never been able to cook a kraut casserole to my liking, until now.  I made this with a pork butt roast, seasoned w/ salt, pepper, MSG, garlic & onion powers. I seasoned the kraut with 1 t. caraway seeds, 1 sliced onion, 2 bay leaves & a large pinch of celery seeds.  The result was very moist & flavorful, I loved it. Next time I will double the kraut because it was my favorite part. I like this with mashed potatoes. 

Thank you for this recipe!

Cooked this on low for 8 hrs. (minimum time stated)and the pork was dry and overcooked - when I tried to slice it, it fell apart.  We tried to eat it but it all went in the garbage.

Excellent!  We didn't have any caraway seeds, but were still pleased with results.  Even our picky eaters enjoyed it!  It was good with leftover barbecue sauce from last night's dinner.  It was very moist and all enjoyed the flavor.  We cooked it on low for 8 hours.  We used packaged sauerkraut from the deli, juice and all.

I love this stuff!  I've also added two peeled, sliced apples (they mix in w/ the potatoes so it doesn't taste "appley" plus 1 or 2 T brown sugar to soften the tartness of the sourkraut. And 2 bayleaves. Sometimes I add small chunks (1 inch) too to add a different flavor. My family gobbles this up - and it's EASY.

Found I had all of these ingredients but the pork roast.  Purchased a fresh, non-frozen, pork loin roast, then followed the recipe steps wehn I got home on a Friday night.  It cooked from about 8:00 PM, and I checked it at 6:00 AM.  Everything was tender, tasty, and done.  Yes, I ate some for breakfast.  The only thing I did was to add about 1 cup of water as the cooker juices were a bit sparse. In reading the other posts, I do think adding onions and even apples would be some alternative flavors I will try in the future.  I would also add even more saurkraut. In summary, this has got to be the easiest and moistest recipe I have ever tried for pork.  I cannot wait for those leftover pork sandwiches! Yum! 8-)

Excellent recipe!  I made with fresh pork loin, and everything turned out perfect.  I left smaller potatoes whole or only sliced in half if they were larger, turned out perfect with the timing.  I added 1 onion sliced in half,which added a delicious flavour to the sauerkraut. Also because we love mushrooms, I added a can of whole button mushrooms when I had about an hour left.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Good and easy.  My review can't be very accurate because I did not follow the recipe well.  My boyfriend would have liked the taste of the sauerkraut but I worried it would be too much for my parents, so I only used 28 oz jar.  Because there were 6 people going to eat I used 10 small potatos (red and yellow, were done perfect around the 8 hour mark) So then I worried that the pork was going to dry out because it did not look like enough liquid.  I added water at first would would have been okay I think if I just used more sayerkraut but it was still not enough for me so I put some chicken broth in it.  I think this was my big mistake.  The pork came out tnder and would have been great if it didn't taste like chicken.  Maybe some veg broth or like the recipe says more sauerkraut would have been great.  I will try this again, but not for a while.  Also, the seeds are a must, and I suggest more seasoning becuase it was a bit bland besides tasting like chicken. 4 stars because it can be as easy as you want it to be

Great recipe! I added a little brown sugar and a dash of cider vinegar as the comments said and it came out AMAZING. I cooked the potatoes separate since I didn't have enough room in my crock pot. I took mine out after 6.5 hours and it was perfect, if I'd waited 8 hrs it may have fallen apart too much. I think it depends on the cut of meat probably.

Very nice! I skipped the garlic and the potatoes. Served it with mashed potatoes instead. Added diced onion, bay leaves, carrots and a diced apple and 1/4c apple cider vinegar. Tasted like my German grandmother's recipe. Thank you!!

I took someone's advice and seared the roast first.  This is delicious!  Tender, juicy... I've been eating it every day since making it, and I'm not sick of it yet.  And I don't even like sauerkraut.

I ended up draining the sauerkraut and putting in roughly the same amount of apple juice.  I also omitted the garlic.

I'll definitely be making this again.

This was delicious.  Even my husband who turns his nose up at the often dry crock pot roasts raved about this one.  I used a 24 oz jar of sauerkraut because that is what I had.  I did not measure the caraway seeds, just sprinkled them over the top of the kraut.  Moist and tastey.

I love this recipe. I also make this with smoked sausage. I don't care for the caraway seeds but love the flavor they add to the dish. I put the caraway seeds in a cheese cloth and bury it. I also add white vinegar to taste.

I made the Slow Cooker Getman-Style Pork Roast German Style with Sauerkraut and Potatoes. My daughter and I felt it was tasteless and my grandson and my husband liked it.But then what do men know as long as they fill their bellies. I made it exactly as the recipe said except I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic,the sauerkraut was dry as it just lays on the top of the meat, and the meat and potatoes had no taste I even used cans of pork gravy over the meat and potatoes and it didn't help. It is certainly easy to make and I will make it again but I will doctor it up next time, I might try BBQ sause.I'll try different things. I love crock pot cooking because the mess is cleaned up and the dinner is cooking and I have the rest of the day to goof off. Thank you for all of your great recipes.I copy them then print them out I also send them to all my friends.  Tillie Polen Scholz, Bay Shore, Long Island, NY

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit.  I did not use the caraway seeds and I thought it would turn out a little dry so I added chicken stock.  I will certainly be making this again in the near future.

Even if you are not a sauerkraut lover, you will love this! After reading through many comments from 4 similar recipes on this site I did the following: I seasoned a 4 pound boneless pork loin roast (with Stubb’s all- natural pork spice rub, black pepper, garlic powder & a little salt) & seared all sides on the stove in a little oil. Transferred the meat to the slow cooker with the fat side up (do not add the oil—it gets a burnt flavor with high smoke point searing) & added 1 large jar of all natural sauerkraut with juice (look for all-natural versions in the international aisle from Poland or Germany. Less sour/better flavor than the common brand because they have no preservatives), 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves,  a sprinkling of caraway seeds, 10 whole juniper berries & 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar.  I then topped with 1/2 of a very large granny smith apple (peeled and sliced), 1 medium red onion (sliced) and 2 tablespoons butter (cut up into little chunks). Cooked for 6 hours at 250 degrees and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful & the kraut/onions tasted great. You can’t taste the apple at all & the small amount of apple, brown sugar & butter cuts the sourness of the kraut juice. Served it with mashed potatoes on the side. My husband said he thought he'd died and gone to heaven, lol, it was that good :)

I really liked this recipe but it wasn't perfect for me. I LOVED the flavor of the caraway seeds! I did make minor changes such as: I used yukon baking potatoes that I peeled and halved which was absolutely perfect; and I used a bone-in pork roast because boneless pork loins get way too dry. Next time I'd double the sauerkraut and replace the garlic with onion. I read another recipe that called for some butter to help cut the acidity of the sauerkraut so I may do that next time too. But, really, those are personal preferences. This recipe is still really good as written!

Great way to use inexpensive bone in loin end or rib end roasts, let the meat simmer with the kraut for about 2 hrs. add washed unpeeled potatoes and a hand full of Barley for the last (3rd) hour of cooking, I don't use the caraway(I like it in the thick crusty Jewish or German rye bread I serve with this)or the Garlic. Plenty of Black pepper. Un drained Kraut and water to cover. The meat will fall from the bones and if you let it sit a while it will absorb the cooking liquid and never be dry. My Grandfather loved this, called it"Heaven in a bowl"
I had this for dinner today,,, Grampa was right !

I woke up on New Years Day and my husband surprised me by having this in the crockpot after finding it online. He left out the caraway seeds but everything else was just as the recipe called for. It was absolutely delicious and he's not usually a cook. It is company worthy, and very easy to prepare.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it's pretty much the same one my mom made for yrs. if your roast is dry then you didn't have enough liquid. And I would add 1/2 the Kraut in at the beginning and other half at the end. I don't think my mom used minced garlic, just garlic salt, caraway seeds etc..

I've made this several times, it's always a big hit. Even my kids like it since the slow cooker tends to take a bit of the edge off the sauerkraut! Tried it tonight with polish sausage instead of pork, it's also excellent that way.

So tender and tasty. After reading the reviews, I dry rubbed it with herbs and seared the roast, poured sauerkraut over it, then cooked it in my roaster at 325 for 1 1/2hrs. Nummy!

This was great. Made it twice. The first time my boyfriend loved it - I thought it needed a little tweaking. Added onion (like others suggested) as well as more garlic. Left out the caraway seeds the first time because I didn't have them. Also used red potatoes. Second time, I added more onion, the caraway seeds, as well as I used Yellow Potatoes. I also reserved a little of the sauerkraut and mixed it in at the very end for the tangy flavor. My boyfriend requests this all of the time. The pork falls apart and is really juicy. It makes great leftovers. Thanks!

Delicious!  My husband and I "pigged" out.  I used red potatoes since it was what I had and it turned out wonderfully.  No problem with being too dry.

Great recipe! I cooked the on low pork for 8 hours and it was tender, juicy and delicious! I agree with other comments re: adding bay leaves, a bit more caraway and freshly ground black pepper - it really does bump up the flavour. I'll make this again, but with a bigger roast - there simply wasn't enough!

I always use frozen meat and instead of potatoes I use dumplings. My kraut is homemade and packed in jars tight so not much juice, I add 4 cups chicken broth to the bottom of the crock, place dumplings(frozen) then pork with kraut on top. Cook on low 7 hrs and it turns out awesome! Juicy meat makes a happy camper!

Wow. Wow. Wow. Absolutely loved it. I used homemade sauerkraut and I didn't have caraway seeds in either the sauerkraut nor the pork, but the first bite shocked me with great flavor that I totally didn't expect,  it is simply amazing. I served it with toasted bread and that made my day.

Great base recipe to nake your own! I wanted this dish now and didnt want to wait 8 hrs for it to cook so I did it stove top. I used a large pot and tore the tenderloin, by hand, into rough forkable pieces. I didnt habe any garlic and left out the potatoes.  So I put the sauerkraut and pork tenderloin pieces into the pot together, added the caraway and cooked covered on medium low to low heat for about an hour stirring occasionally amaking sure all the pork pieces were mostly submerged in the liquid when I wasn't stirring it. Towards the end I added some dark brown sugar to cut the tartness to my own taste. I was looking for this recipe with caraway in particular because my polish grandma on my fathers side makes it with the caraway and authentic polish kielbasa every year for Thanksgiving and I wanted to learn to make it myself. Also my grandma on my mothers side makes it with pork and lots of brown sugar so its super sweet with no caraway. I love them both so I added a little bit of each family recipe into my own new one. The pork was super tender and juicy and was the perfect amount of caraway. I probably only added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar just to level out the tartness.  Thanks for this great recipe to inspire a new family recipe of my own!

The meat was soooo tender, but the sauerkraut juice made all the ingredients taste the same. And no salt & pepper?  BLAND for sure. Love the convenience, but result less than great.

My boyfriend and I did not like this. I followed the recipe as directed, there was hardly any flavor in this dish. It tastes like it's missing something. Highly doubt I will ever make this again. If I do, I would not add all the sauerkraut in the beginning. I would probably do half the sauerkraut, all the juice, and add the rest of the sauerkraut  a few minutes before serving to heat it up. The one thing we did like was the potatoes. They tasted really well being cooked in the sauerkraut juice.

I really enjoyed this, but my husband wasn't as crazy about it.  He did admit that the flavor got better the more he ate.  The roast was tender and the potatos cooked.  I didn't salt the roast, I will next time.

It was good, but dont use the bag sauerkraut unless you rinse/drain it first. Could not find the jar and never used jar sauerkraut. I think maybe using a 12oz beer (like sam admins) would cut down on the sourness (Like a Belgium style sausage with sauerkraut)

Came out very well and was liked by all. Added sliced carrots just to give the dish some color.

Very tasty. I’ve made it with and without caraway seeds and both are good.

It was delicious.  Tasty krout & potatos too.  So simple too make.  I did have to go out for the caraway seeds but you need them for sure.

I followed the recipe with one exception...I did brown the meat on all sides before adding to the slow cooker.   I put the meat in the center, surrounded by potatoes, and covered the meat with sauerkraut which kept it from drying.   It was tender and moist. We thought the vinegar flavor was a little strong, so next time I will add a little brown sugar and apples.  Some recipes drain the sauerkraut and add water, so that's another option.

This was a nice comfort meal, but sort of bland. My sauerkraut wasn't sour, and I'm not sure why, as I didn't rinse it.

This is without a doubt a great and easy dish to make. I'm a working man and cooking time is limited when I get home. So I prepare it the night before, leave it in the refrigerator, then add it to and start the Crockpot when i leave in the morning. I actually crave this and cook it every month to month1/2.

Made power recipe except I added the suggested chicken broth to prevent the pork from drying out. It was like chewing on damp mop strings. We enjoyed the veggies and kraut. The roast was awful.

I have made this dish several times. It is a New Years Day favorite and always turns out well. Even my daughter who doesn't like sauerkraut likes this. As I have a large family, I double the recipe. Other than that, I make no changes.

I saw some people saying it came out dry so I put the roast in frozen and about halfway through I added two cups of chicken broth to keep the toast covered and in the juices. This worked wonderfully as the pork was juicy and falling apart. Everyone who was here that liked pork and sauerkraut loved it.

We browned and seasoned the meat prior to putting it in the crockpot. Also added one cup of chicken broth. Super easy and tasty.

Way to sour. I'll make the pork again and serve the sour kraut on the side.

This went over very well with my family.  Our pork ended up a little tough, but we increased the heat and reduced the cook time, I'm sure if we had done it for 8 hours it would have been perfect.  I did add baby carrots with the potatoes and they both soaked up the flavor of the sauerkraut and was wonderful.

This was wonderful. I have a new crockpot so as listed by other reviews I did not cook it as long. The roast was done in 4 1/2 hours.  The kraut is so wonderful. I used Bavarian sauerkraut, and had regular I put in too.  I did add the apple to it and a small amt of brown sugar. I'll never make it any other way now. Thanks so much.

I have made this many times using a frozen pork loin, do not drain the kraut and add about 3 Tbsp brown sugar. I sometimes add a chopped green apple. Sliced onions are a nice addition also. Perfection!

It sounded so good and easy that I did not read the reviews.  I followed the recipe and while it was moist, it was flavorless.

made this exactly as written.....ewwwww....so sorry.  DH couldn't even eat it and he loves sauerkraut.  Perhaps if I had just placed the sauerkraut in at the very last hour might have been more palate pleasing or not.  Will not make again.

This was fantastic -- tasted like a slow cooker reuben!  Goes on my short list of easy, tasty crock recipes.
