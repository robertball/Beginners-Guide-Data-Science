Soooo easy....and "eat yourself sick" good!    I changed it up a SMIDGEN by adding: a sprinkle of cinnamon, and about 1/2 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla.  Ohhhhhhhhh myyyyyyyyy!! My husband, (a farm guy raised on summer rhubarb dishes) asked if there was a way to give it 6 stars...LOL  ENJOY!

This is very easy to make and delicious. It has a very sweet dense cake bottom but the rhubarb is still tart.

Delicious, only changes: I added 2 tsp ground ginger and baked for 50 min. Yummy, very easy to make. Will make this again.

Very interesting recipe.  I, too, was skeptical about the water, but it worked.  Following others' advice, I cut the sugar down to 1 c. and it was still plenty sweet.  It was definitely pudding-y, not the drier cobbler consistency I half-expected.  Next time I will increase the amount of rhubarb, or try it in a smaller dish.  The rhubarb was too sparse for my tastes.

This was very good and very easy to make. I will probably use a little less sugar next time as it seemed a bit sweet to me, but other than that, it was great.

what smelled great, and actually tasted good, was a floating mess of cake...  after 40 min, the crust was browning on the edges but the whole dish was floating in liquid.... what a waste!

easy and tasty.  I added a little vanilla and cinnamon.  I was worried about the water but everything set up great.  Just a little plain for my taste (definitely more a cobbler than a pudding)

Good and easy.  I was uncertain about dumping the water mixture on top but it turned out great.  I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar by about 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I might cut back even more next time.

It is very sweet. I would add a tab bit of salt and cinnamon if I made it again. Someone suggested baking it longer, I think that would be a good idea too.

Way too sweet and I used half the sugar called for.  The boiling water seemed to make the batter portion gooey and not really baked in parts.  I think if you cut down on the sugar you should also reduce the water.  Simple, yes, but not a great use of rhubarb.

Well I was a little thrown off by the cooking time differences.  On the directions it said 40 minutes and the cook time section said 20 minutes.  Looks and smells great, very easy to make.

I was looking for a quick recipe and I didn't have much on hand.  This worked great!  I agree that I might use a little less sugar next time.  My son loved it!

This was super sweet! If I make this again I will cut down on the sugar for the sauce. I was also thinking that I might double the cake portion of the recipe. I will have to wait until some more rhubarb matures in the garden though before trying this again.

This was quick, easy, cheap and good. Defiantly more of a cobbler than a pudding.

Made this pudding exactly to the recipe.  Came out looking just like the photo.  Stupidly sweet with pasty white flour cobbler and sugar sauce dripping everywhere.  I like the cobbler concept.  If I make it again I'd greatly reduce the sugar and replace at least half the white flour with whole wheat.

Very Good.  Did bake it in a 9 x 13 even though there didn't look like enough batter to spread out.  I added 1/2 t. vanilla and about 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I cut the sugar down to 1 C. and maybe could cut down a tiny bit more.  I used 5 C. frozen rhubarb.  I ended up baking it about the amt. called for or maybe just a tad bit more.  It was definitely custardy, except on 1 end where it was a little more dry because I think the oven is not level.

Super easy. I use recipes as more of a guide and always change a few things up. Added more rhubarb, probably another cup's worth and also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture.  Baked an extra 10 minutes and turned out delicious.

I was liberal when adding sugar, and didn't need to since the recipe is plenty sweet.  It turned out really yummy, especially adding ice cream or milk!

It's a good basic easy dish.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it's a little too sweet.  I'd cut at least a 1/2c and I'd add another cup of rubarb or make it in a smaller dish.
