I was craving a really good deli lox spread reminiscent of my childhood in the northeastern part of the US. It was pretty good. I added some fresh dill weed for added depth of flavor and to add some more complexity. But it's pretty close to what I was looking for. Thank you for bringing me a little piece of home. It's one of the only lox recipes here that wasn't fussy with a whole bunch of extra stuff (the added stuff takes away from the authenticity). I diced the capers really fine (some leave it whole as well as onion garlic & dill weed. If you feel like something's missing add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. It adds a little something that you didn't resize was missing until you add it. Thanks for the recipe!
