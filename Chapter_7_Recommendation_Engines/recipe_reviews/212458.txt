I made this with calf kidneys and cider; lovely. I might add more curry next time.

I like offal very much and I found this recipe most pleasant.  The whole idea appealed to me.  Tomorrow I plan on having a ragout of lamb.  To change my ideas a bit, I am going to use this recipe.  I might try putting in some mushrooms too.

I did this pretty much as is, but using only 6 kidneys and adding a 1/4 tsp salt.  It did take longer than 10 minutes to reduce the wine.  The sauce it made was fantastic.  The cream, tomato paste, and curry powder was a great combination.  But this was my first time eating kidneys, and I don't think I will be getting them again.  They tasted & smelled, even after cooking, like the outside of an animal.  I'm not sure if anything can be done about that.  I have eaten half of them, because the sauce was so good, but I had to eat them slowly, and at first I wasn't sure I'd be able.
