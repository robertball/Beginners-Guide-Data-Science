In my opinion, these are better than traditional oatmeal raisin cookies.  This is a good option for someone who prefers chocolate over raisins (because after all, raisins are just wanna-be chocolate chips), or someone who likes a hearty, not too sweet cookie.  I used olive oil, almonds, and regular oatmeal.  Stirring the dough took a little elbow grease -- at the end I had more success with a wooden spoon than the electronic beaters.  I did end up adding a splash of milk to make it easier to work with.  This dough does NOT keep well, so bake right away.  The cookies do not spread out very much, so you can load the pan pretty closely.

These are really good.  In an effort to keep my husband away from some of the really gross snack foods (Little Debbies, Hostess Twinkies...) I have been making more things from scratch and these will be a staple at our house.  Normally I take great pains to follow a recipe to the letter the first time but I was out of chocolate chips and used Reeses Peanut Butter Chips instead and was very pleased with the result.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Additional Note!  I made these again a couple of weeks later and (still) didn't have any chocolate chips and put in a heaping 1/2 cup of toffee chips.  Wonderful.....

This is our new favorite cookie recipe!  The texture of the grape nuts really makes it what it is. We made them even healthier by using 1/2 the butter and replacing the other half with applesauce. I also like to double the recipe and make a few batches and then freeze some of the dough for later use. We also eat the dough straight from the freezer. :)

I love this recipe!  I was looking for something more healthy than our usual chocolate chip recipe, and this is perfect.  I have made these several times now, according to the recipe, and the texture is great.  Soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside, and the grape nuts provide a nice little crunch.  You don't need to eat alot to be filled.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

Dough was extremely stiff, rather hard to work with. The cookies were OK, but I'll stick with my favorite recipe next time.

Really tasty with a tall glass of milk! I added some almond extract, a little nutmeg, and some cinnamon. I used almonds instead of walnuts. I didn't have the grapenuts, so I just left that part out. I love the combination of white and whole wheat flour. Makes for a great texture! :)

Used some old grapenuts--turned out perfect. Had a lot of young people here--they gobbled them up. Liked the reference to Iowa City--my favorite place in the world!

Will you believe me if I say these are the best cookies I've ever tasted yet? Pinch me. I'm not dreaming. THEY ARE!! GRAPE NUTS RULE!!

I kept everything the same except using 2 cups oats (didn't have enough) and 2 cups of chocolate/toffee bits (didn't have chocolate chips & walnuts). Basically you can use whatever you have in your pantry and I bet these cookies will still rock. 

The batter is a bit dry (I squished the balls real good) and my cookies DID spread (some turned into cookie bars- still Mmm) and in 10 minutes some of them did burn on the bottom so make sure you keep a close watch over them.

btw, GRAPE NUTS RULE!! :D

I really like this recipe.  However, the batter is very dry and wants to crumble...which leads to a crumbly cookie.  I took the advice of another reader and added a little milk to make the batter hold together.  These cookies LOOK best if you roll a golf ball size cookie, then flatten to about half the height of the ball.  That makes larger cookies, and needs an extra minute to cook.

This dough was so dry and crumbly - difficult to form into cookies.  And even decreasing the baking time didn't prevent them from turning out as little dry nuggets.  I compared this recipe to other oatmeal cookie recipes that I use and the proportion of oatmeal to butter is much higher in this one.  I'll probably stick with my other recipes, but if I make these again I'll cut the oatmeal amount in half.   I really liked the crunch of the Grapenuts, though.

These are fabulous!  I've made other "healthy whole wheat" cookies before and they were just chewy and dry.  (Ick!)  But these were so good!  They make the perfect breakfast cookie, I used dark chocolate chips instead of regular, and added just a wee bit of canola oil when I was mixing the batter to help it stick together.  The crunch from the grape nuts is the best! :)

These Cookies are the best cookies I have ever had!  I love that they have whole wheat flour but what really makes these the best is the nugget cereal (grapenuts)!  It's SO GOOD!!  You really should try it!

Very disappointing. The balance of fat to amount of dry ingredients is out of balance. I baked a few and they turned out ok. I put the crumbly dough back in my kitchen aid mixer with dough hook and added 3/4 cup peanut butter and an egg for binding. I was then able to roll them into balls without falling apart. I flattened them in the pan before baking. They turned out much better.

I didn't have any semi sweet pieces available or else I would have used. I did add 2/3 cup grape nut cereal instead of 1/2 cup because I didn't have any walnuts on hand either.  Even without these 2 ingredients, these cookies were delicious and I liked the idea of combining 2 healthy cereals, oatmeal and grapenuts, to make them.

These are delicious....the grape nuts add something special with an extra crunch...the dough may be a little crumbly, but it didn't affect the overall outcome once the cookie was baked. I added pecans instead of walnuts and dark chocolate chips. One of my new favorites.

Really loved these. Didn't have any trouble with crumbly cookies or dough. Used 3/4 C king arthur unbleached white flour and 1/4 C whole wheat pastry flour. For the cereal added Cascadian Farms granola as I didn't have grape nuts. Used pecans and dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips. Added 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 t salt. VERY GOOD!!!10 minutes did the trick with the heavy duty baking pans I use.

A different twist on oatmeal cookies!  For those that can't have chocolate - I found using an equal amount of toffee baking bits (Heath) worked just fine!  ****Also - WARNING - one past reviewer of this recipe recommends eating this cookie dough RAW - I reported this to Allrecipes and they will not remove the review or put a footnote on this recipe - it is NOT safe to eat raw dough - not just for the raw eggs - but because of the raw flour!

This is a great recipe for oatmeal cookies!  My whole family ate them up in just a few days. : )  I found that instead of chocolate chips, uses white chocolate chip, and add about a half cup of dried cranberrys!  Yum!

The cookie dough wouldn't even stick together. It fell apart! I had to improvise...I guess I didn't do a good job on that.

delicious! I love the grape nuts crunch. I dont know why there is half regular and half wheat flour. Maybe I can just add grape nuts to my usual oatmeal cookie recipe? Either way, these are good.

Delicious!
Instead of the nugget cereal, I added raisins. Instead of the sugar, I added 1/2 cup Splenda.
Simply wonderful and easy to make.

Sorry everybody. I agree with Phil--they were dry and crumbly and I added an extra egg, too, which stiffened the dough and I was hoping for the best.  From now on, I'll go with the recipe that's on the Quaker Oats box.  They're the best that I've had so far.

These were excellent.  I did, however change a few things.  I used 3/4 cup sucanat in leau of all sugars.  I used spelt flour in leau of all flours.  I also used Wheat germ instead of "wheat and Barley".  They endd up tasting very good!

Yumm! Mine came out a little dry so I added another egg. They were great. Soo may flavours rolled up in oatmeal!
