I used the ingredients listed, but being a cranky old man I just winged it for the amounts of each thing used. The breast halves were large and my knife was very sharp so the thickness of the slices varied. I used fresh pineapple chunks because that was what I had. I used garlic salt, thyme and creole seasoning and everything came out good! Next time I think I'll try some well aged white cheddar cheese.
