Great taste, however I would recommend sauteing the onions, celery & bellpeppers in olive oil for about 5 min.  They are just too crunchy otherwise.  Also, I deleted 1 can of soup & added approx 1/2 cup of sour cream, along with a little fresh rosemary & pepper.

Excellent base recipe! You can use almost any type of meat, veggies and cream soup. I used only 2 cans of cream soup and added a cans worth of mayo, skipping the cheese and adding half a package of soda crackers (crumbled). Turned out great and was a big hit (my BF had 3 helpings)!

I liked this recipe because of all the veggys. I only used 1 can of soup with 1 can of milk. However, the leftovers were a little dry. I also sauteed all the veggys first instead of putting just the broccoli in the pasta water.

This was very good!! Next time I would either saute the celery ahead like one other reviewer said, or leave it out completely though. It was still pretty crunchy. I also cheated and bought the frozen peas and carrots medley instead of cutting raw carrots. I'll still definitely give it 5 stars. Mmmm...

I changed somethings, Instead of 3cans of soup, I used 2 and 1/2can of milk, and I used pimentos in place of the red pepper. Then I sauted the onions, celery, broccoli, & carrots in olive oil before placing in the oven. Then, sprinkled grated parmesan cheese across the top. But, this recipe is very good, I enjoyed it! It's cool to see a recipe and kind-of make it your own too! Thanks!

Good, EASY recipe.  8 oz. pasta was enough for me, and I heeded the other reviewers comments: 1 less can of soup, added rosemary and added pepper... worked well.   I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top.

Yummy!! I only had 2 cans of the soup, so I added a cans worth of milk and added a very light sprinkling of bread crumbs on top and it turned out very well. I omitted the peppers and used dehydrated onions. My hubby did not like it, but he doesn't like casseroles in general. He did try it, though. I,on the other hand, was impressed. Thank you for a yummy, quick recipe. :)

Very good recipe. I was surprised, it didn't look very appealing but was very nice. I made half the recipe which worked out fine and the only substitutions I used were for organic cheese and soup. Very tasty.

I made this for my parents and boyfriend and it was a HUGE hit! It was so yummy and full of flavor! I heavily emphasize on making sure the carrots and broccoli have enough time to soften with the pasta before draining it! Unless you don't mind the crunch, then just let it soak a bit with the pasta! I can't wait to make this dish again!!

I made this casserole per directions and it tasted very bland. It needed some type of seasoning to add taste.

Very good......I did saute the chopped veggies before combining all ingredients; I didn't have cheddar on hand, so I used some grated locatelli.  A trip down memory lane.....I hadn't made this recipe in years.

Great recipe, but I used pepper jack cheese, and I used organic mixed vegetables. I also added bread crumbs on top, and buttered my dish before baking. Delish!

Loved it! I added a block of cream cheese instead of the third can of soup, only saut√©ed the onions, doubled the broccoli & only used a 12 oz package of noodles. I love my veggies a little crunchy... The taste was great the first time I made it, but divine with the cream cheese!

Tuna Noodle Casserole Haiku: "Lacking in flavor. Too much pasta, crunchy vegg. Overall not great." Found that the noodle amount was overwhelming, so after boiling the pasta I set some aside for another dinner later in the week, and upon reducing the noodle, I also dropped one cream of can. The vegetables could've greatly benefited from being sauteed first, as several other reviews indicated. Without salt, pepper, garlic or any seasoning, this was a very bland dish that needed a major flavor massage. And while I don't need gooey strings of cheese in my meals, I found 2 TB of cheddar on top of 9X13 to be chuckle-worthy. To make this again would require so many changes it would be an entire different casserole altogether.

I added a can of seasoned canned tomatoes instead of one of the soup cans, and added peas and mushrooms and a bunch of garden spices. This is a great base recipe!

I made this and it was great. I heeded the advice & put in 2 cans of soup (1 can mushroom
 and 1 can golden mushroom) and some almond milk to make up the liquid. I did saut√© the veggies in some olive oil & that worked great. Used a 12 oz box of tri colored rotini & a mix of cheddar & parmesan on top. Yum!
