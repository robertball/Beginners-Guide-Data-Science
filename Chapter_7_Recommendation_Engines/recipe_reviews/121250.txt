I didn't have instant rice so I used breadcrumbs. Yummy!  For those of you who don't like a gamey taste, put ground venison in a colander & rinse it with plain water, then drain before using in a recipe. Makes a world of difference - people who tell me they hate deer always enjoy my ground venison recipes.

Delicious! My whole family loved this recipe and devoured these meatballs. I used dried bread crumbs instead of instant rice (because I didn't have any). I served them with spaghetti. Can't wait until next fall when we have some more venison and I can make these again.

My husband took one bite and said, "Can we have this again soon?  It's great!"  Next time, I will add some diced green peppers to the meatballs.  I served it with egg noodles and roasted asparagus.

I did not have rice but used panko breadcrumbs. This is a easy dish and has enough seasoning to cover up the gaminess. Great for a party.

Quick & easy and tastes just like I hoped.  Used fresh moose I ground this morning, breadcrumbs instead of rice, didn't have paprika and I added liquid smoke.  Nice & tender and not dry on the inside which can happen with moose.  Glad I doubled the batch so I can freeze some.

Really good. The sauce may need a little more ketchup in it. I added a dash of cider vinegar to give a little kick. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe and easy enough to make. We eat more than 200 L.B.S's of venison a year and always looking for new things to make and these were absolutely GREAT! I didn't have a fresh onion so I added some Minced Onion about 2 tbs. & still was Great and full of flavor. This get's a Thumbs Up from me & my family!

Just made the 2nd batch with Fresh onions. Superb! I did make another half batch of the sauce. Heres what I done. Made the recipe as directed, put it into a crock pot & cool. Let sit in the fridge over night. Mix another half batch off sauce add to crock heat it up and it's Great! Did I mention? We love the Sauce!

Very good and I will make again!  No instant rice so I used panko crumbs like others did.  I also used some homemade tomato sauce in place of the soup.  The ground mustard and paprika make the sauce different but very good. UPDATE: I have made this several times now using the tomato soup and it is a very good recipe.  I am very picky when it comes to ground venison.  This recipe is a winner and so easy!

Wow- these are really quick and easy to make. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made my own sauce when I didn't have all the ingredients and my family liked my improvised sauce better than the original recipe. They are a family favorite! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe! I made these meatballs with moose meat and flavor was still wonderful!  I almost forgot to put the water into the topping mixture and used a little beer instead and it was the perfect substitution.  Great recipe!

This has turned into one of our favorite meals!  I use different types of soup, rather than the tomato soup to change the taste every now and then.
