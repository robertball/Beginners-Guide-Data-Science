This was good! I give it 5 stars for simplicity, 4 stars for taste. I used 2 cans of crabmeat and used onion and chives cream cheese. I would prefer fresh crab meat, but in a pinch, this is delish.

So simple, so delicious! The horseradish adds a nice kick, and I only used half. I like it chilled instead of warmed. Either way, it's a hit. I also used 4 oz of cream cheese with chives and 4 oz of reg cream cheese because it was what was in the fridge.

This is a good basic recipe that can be tailored to your own tastes.  I actually use about 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce and 4 tablespoons of horseradish, since we like stronger flavors. A tablespoon of mayo lends creaminess, and I use 8 oz of pasteurized crab rather than canned. Thanks for the recipe--it's quick, easy, and tasty!

My sister used to serve something like this and I always assumed it was incredibly difficult to make. What a big faker she was! I made it exactly written, but sprinkled slivered almonds on it and baked it (no microwave). It was great, every bit was gone. About 20 minutes in a 325 oven, if anyone wants to know.

This didn't go over very well with my group.  I didn't care for it too much myself.  Kinda bland and the texure was weird to me.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 cans of crab.  Won't be making this again.

I made the recipe exactly as directed. It was very good. It was the hit of the party and very little was left over.

very good ... on the suggestion of another reviewer, I also made it with 2 cans of crabmeat but added another tbsp of horseradish, 2 tsp of worcestershire, salt, and fresh cracked pepper.  This gave it density and a little kick.

Fantastic and so easy to make. Original recipe didn't have much flavor. I doubled the recipe and added about 3 to 4 drops of Mean Devil Woman hot sauce, 1/4 cup of minced green onion,  and increased crab to 3 cans. HUGE hit on New Years Eve.

Thought it was great, but it was missing something initially. Then, the second time I added a few solid shakes of Old Bay seasoning before microwaving. Perfect.

As other said, this is a great basic recipe.  I doubled it and used about 10 oz of fresh crabmeat.  I ended up using more horseradish and more worcestershire than called for.  It's really to taste...  Also, I did nuke it and it was ok that way but served it cold.  I overheard someone say at the party, who brought the crab because it's awesome!

Love this even cold.  I used fat free cream cheese, with double the horseradish and Worcesteshire, and a table spoon of lite sour cream for creaminess.  Yummy on celery and no guilt!!

Needs a lot of something else to give this some flavor.  I doubled the horseradish and worcestershire and added garlic .  It still had no flavor.  I also used onion and chive cream cheese.

I must be missing something. It was SO bland. I did it the way the recipe said to and ended up redoing it. My golden retriever wouldn't even lick the spoon from the original. I added sea salt, white pepper, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, and a sauteed onion. WAY better.

Yes, this was not the 1st time I had made it, but had lost the recipe.  I added a little more Parmesan cheese this time.  Much better.!
