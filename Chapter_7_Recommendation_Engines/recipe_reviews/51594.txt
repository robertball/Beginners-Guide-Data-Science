I am glad I read the first review- because this recipe needed some work.  First of all- there is too much coffee in the original- I decreased it to 2 Tablespoons and I increased the amount of white sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup mini chips instead- that was enough.

These cookies turned out delicious...  I used five *teaspoons* of instant coffee crystals instead of *tablespoons*, and the coffee flavor was a bit too subtle.  Next time I'll try seven or eight teaspoons.  The batter was very creamy, and made for a plump, chewy cookie.  Yum.

This makes a very cake-like, strong coffee flavored cookie(almost a brownie consistency). The butter or margarine should be melted for best results, not just softened. Very good flavor.

Added extra 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips. Followed recipe otherwise. Result was a bitter cookie. Not very sweet. Cookies burned on bottom after only 9 minutes. Straight to the garbage.

Very good, will make these again. They only made about 2 1/2 dozen even though I made them really small.

These were very easy to make and very delicious--or so I'm told.  I gave them as presents, and everyone said they were delicious...so going by what they said, I give this recipe 5 stars.
Also, I did add a little less instant coffee (like 4 Tbsp instead) and used caramel-chocolate chips, as opposed to semisweet regular ones.  Maybe that helped?
Good luck with yours!
