I made this recipe twice now, and will continue to make it. My biggest complaint is the sauce, will having some great flavors, is saltier than I would like. The fish turn out really oily, even when I leave them with some paper towels to soaked out the oil. I serve it with a hefty side of rice and veggies. Even still, it is usually greasy then I would like.
