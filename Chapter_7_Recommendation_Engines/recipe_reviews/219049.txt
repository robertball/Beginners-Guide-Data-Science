I used Bagel Thin sandwich slices, red bell pepper and red onion (that's what I had on hand) and I omitted the avocado only because I don't care for them. The jalapeno slices I used were homemade. I paired this sandwich with a half cup of Zesty Broccoli and Cauliflower Salad which made for a filling and satisfying lunch. This sandwich was one of the best I'd had in a long time.

This worked great for lunch today with what I had in the house. I did defeat the purpose of the title by leaving out the jalepenos, because I don't care for them in a sandwich. I used white bread as it was what I had. I had all the ingredients but the avacado so I had to leave that out. I probably doubled the tomato and cut the amount of green pepper and onion in half for personal preference. I loved how the dressing was light and not a heavy mayo. I used white wine vinegar. For the cheese I used Cabot 50% low fat cheddar. I made an olive tapenade the other day and used about an equal amount of that instead of opening another can of olives. Thanks, for helping me use up some of my bits of veggies in the fridge and make them taste good to.

Pretty good sandwich. I don't like olives so I left them out, but besides that I stuck w/the recipe.  Good sandwich to take to lunch, and the dressing is a nice change from the usual mayo or mustard.  Thanks for sharing!
