This was very good! The only thing I changed was adding a bit of the pasta water to the mushroom mixture, then added the pasta and tossed. Then I added the egg mixture while stirring into the pasta as other recipes instructed.

I really liked this recipe. I was skeptical since it did not have onion, or ham, or a hint of creme fraiche. Given that I reduced it for only two people, it is totally worth it. I added 2 more teaspoons of  parmesan because I like it. I reserved 2 tbsps of the water from the spaghetti and added it as I tossed the spaghetti and mushroom mix together to make it easier for the mix to stick to the spaghetti. Will definitely make this recipe again.

It was a little on the dry side, added about 2 tablespoons of water and that helped. We will try it again.

This is the second time I made this for my family dinner night. Super easy to make.

I most recently made this with frozen cheese tortellini from the grocery store â€” extra cheesy!

As one other reviewer mentioned, too dry, would go back to the saucy, creamy option.

Not my favorite. Seems dry and plain. Probably would add more of a sauce next time.
