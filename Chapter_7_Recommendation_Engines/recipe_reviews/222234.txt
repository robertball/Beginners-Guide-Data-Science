This recipe was delicious! Instead of cherry pie filling - I used fresh picked cherries (pitted), tossed with cinnamon, corn starch, and sugar. For dough, I didn't have white whole wheat flout, so I used all purpose. With intentions to share with the girls at work, my husband and I gobbled all of it that night! Thank you Chef John for such a great recipe!

Made this recipe as instructed and it was easy and delicious.  Needed a quick dessert for Christmas Day so made again using what ingredients I had on hand.  Frozen pie crust dough and canned blueberry pie filling. Did not have course sugar, so sprinkled the top with colored red sugar for Christmas.  Was light, tasty, and not too sweet.  Be careful as most canned pie filing contains High Fructose Corn Syrup.  ShurFine brand does not contain High Fructose Corn Syrup.

This was a great recipe to make using leftover pie crust.  I needed a recipe that only used one can of pie filling since I forgot to by enough for a traditional pie. It was a hit and a nice change, too.

Tasty , simple dessert that comes out cute as a button ! Yes you can use all purpose flour in place of the wheat flour . I wanted to use fresh cherries so I followed another users suggestion and mixed fresh pitted cherries with about a tablespoon of sugar and half tbs of cornstarch and a dash of cinnamon. Let it sit and get all syrupy before assembling . Yum!

Delicious!! I was pressed for time, so I didn't chill the dough at all.  Also instead of ice cold orange vodka, I used a tiny bit of orange extract and plain vodka to equal 1 T.  For the filling, I used a little more than one cup. Easy, fast, delicious, beautiful.

This was very delicious. The crust reminded me of making scones. I filled it with a can of sweet cherries. (Cherries only, no added ingredients). Next time, I would use two, to be about the same amount of filling as one can with sauce. It tasted great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Also, I used regular flour in place of white whole wheat, and orange juice in place of orange vodka. I look forward to trying the recipe again when I have access to the correct flour. 

I plan to serve this the next time we have guests over!

I made cupcake tarts with fresh cherries. First I made a slurry by adding sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon to the cherries.

Great recipe. Easy to make but looks impressive. I made it exactly as it is written. Not too sweet or tart. Thank Chef John.
