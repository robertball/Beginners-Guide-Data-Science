Ach - who'd want to mix everything together?  It'd look and taste a sorry mess!  Made as directed, it looks and tastes spectacular, and is easy easy easy.  It's not for wimpy palates though:  the flavours are robust!  I made 1 1/2 times the amount of cheese mixture and used a little more of the tomato to yield two bowls.  A note to people who are doubtful about the sundried tomatoe:  even though ordinary tomato paste is indeed cheaper, the flavour can in no way compared to sundried tomato paste or pate.  Dry-packed (ie. in a packet, not in a jar in oil) dried tomatoes are CHEAP, and you're far better off using those.  Simply place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water, allow to soak until soft and swollen, then drain and wizz in the food processor with good olive oil, oregano, garlic, and salt and pepper, and a few olives and/or capers if you like.  Extremely delicious, inexpensive, and better than anything you could buy - particularly ordinary tomato paste!

I love this recipe.  It's pretty and tasty and easy to prepare.  One substitution we like is to put chopped, roasted red peppers in place of the tomato layer.  Also, chopped walnuts pressed on the outside kind of dress it up a bit.

Very good and very easy -- it got rave reviews.  I used sun-dried tomato pesto (I think Classico makes it, with the jarred pasta sauce) -- and I agree with other posters -- just wouldn't be the same without the sundried tomato tase.  Would definitely make again.  I served it with bagel chips and brushetta toast.

I was at first worried that it wouldn't pop out of the bowl properly but I've made it 3 times without a problem! I've never been able to find sundried tomato paste, but I just cut them up or throw them in the food processor before I make the pesto. I think I might make my next version without them altogether, because they are expensive and their taste is always overpowered by the garlic anyway. I serve this spread with cut French bread or baguette and it's always a big hit (I add extra garlic too).

Wow!!  I don't measure the basil/spinach so I usually end up with more mixture - I break out the cheese to make two balls and serve with the small round rice crackers from trader joes.  My guests ask for it!

I just made this to chill overnight, and I already know I am going to LOVE it!  I couldn't find sun dried tomato paste so I used sun dried tomato pesto instead!

Cartha, what a wonderful recipe.  My family says I am not allowed to come to the party unless I bring the dip! I have made this for every party and always get great comments. For the sun dried tomato paste, I used a jar of chopped sun dried tomatoes. Drain the tomatoes of all the oil. Don't mix all the layers together!! The presentation is very pretty. Even my brother loves this and he is 17!

The fresh basil gave the spread a strong flavor.  Although it was a good taste, the next time I will add a bit more of the sun dried tomato mixture.

WOW!!  First of all, I couldn't find sundried tomato paste so i just took some sundried tomatos that were packed in oil and I ran them through the food processor until they turned into a paste consistency.  I also made this 24 hours in advance and it was WONDERFUL!  All of my guests raved about it, and it was so simple to prepare.  This would be perfect for Christmas with the bright green and red interior.  Also, since the flavors are so concentrated you don't need a lot of the spread for each cracker so it really goes a long way.  This is a wonderful party appetizer because you can make it so far in advance and then all you have to do before the party is put it on a plate and open a box of crackers.

This recipe is to die for.  I made it for a family barbeque and was a bit worried that my unsophisticated relatives would not appreciate the sophisticated flavors, but I was happily surprised to see them gobble it right up.   Just watch out - it's so delicious that you'll probably end up eating way too much, and you might get a stomach ache!

YUM!  I'm going to use this recipe now whenever I'm asked to bring an appetizer to a party.  It's easy to make, looks great and gets raves from the crowd.   (I have not been able to get it to flip out of the bowl so easily as the insturctions say, however.)

I usually leave out the tomato paste, mostly because I don't have time to make all the fancy layers.  It's a very versatile recipe - leave herbs coursely chopped and use on bread - or finely chopped for crackers.  It's a rich but delicious recipe.

I took this to an adults only party, and gave out the recipe to four different people-went over tremendously well.  My daughters also loved it, but it may be too flavorful for less adventurous palates.  Cleaning the basil was the most time consuming part, although it made my kitchen smell wonderful!  Only problem was that I didn't know how smooth to process it to.  I put this into a Corelle bowl-not a large vegetable bowl, and not the small salad bowl-I think they call it a cereal bowl.

I made this for a recent girls gettogther and everyone raved. I found it quick easy and very appealing to the eye. I followed the advice of a previous reveiw and added more sundried tomato paste and found it was perfect.

I love this recipe. I first had it at a wedding reception and everyone around us asked for the recipef from the hostess. I serve it as all my parties and even at the bridal and baby showers we have at work. If you use Saran Wrap and line the the bowl, it looks great! Yum. can't wait to make it next week at a wedding shower.

I wasn't sure how it was supposed to look, so when I pulled it out of the fridge and didn't like the look, I mixed it completely and served it in a bowl.  Everyone raved at the flavor.

Goat cheese is not a favorite of our friends and family, so I substitute ricotta and add a bit of garlic powder to it, or use flavored cream cheese and add 4 extra ounces of it to fill out the desired amount.  I eliminate the salt because other ingredients are already a bit salty.

Maybe I should have taken some of the others reviewers advice and just mixed the whole thing together because I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe. Although it looked pretty, the flavors did not meld. I felt like I was just eating cream cheese, tomato paste and pesto. I think the flavor would have been better had I used an herbed whipped cream cheese.

It is very true that this spread is full of robust flavor and is not for those who like mild dishes. Use with plain crackers (I used Triscuits) since the strong flavors could not pair well with a flavored cracker.

Excellent.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, and divided some of the parmesan to be whipped in with the feta and cream cheese.  I brought this to a family outing, and it was very popular.  I was skeptical about whether or not it would be a hit.  It was easy to make! I made it as written, except that I made more layers to make it look even prettier.  It worked well.

This cheeseball is outstanding!!!  I have a small catering business and have definitely added this to my menu choices.  You can also use just regular tomato paste if you don't have the other on hand.  I did increase the cream cheese by 4 more ounces. You will not be sorry when you bring this to your next gathering.

I did not use the food processor, instead I just minced the basil and added the shreded parmesan. I actually doubled the recipe and instead of using a bowl, I used a loaf pan. People loved! It is easy, fast and delicious.

This is SO good! I had this recipe saved in my box for few years and finally I made it for the Thanksgiving this year. Everyone at the party couldn't stop eating it. It's so easy to make and it looks so beautiful! I made few small changes - I used about 2 cups of spinach and about a half cup of basil, I was afraid that 1 cup of basil will give a very strong taste. Will definitively make it again!

Excellent flavour to this dip. I ended up stirring the whole thing together after I saw how it looked in layers, and it tasted great.  Also, instead of crackers, I made "crustinis" from a french baguette sliced up and toasted with a herb butter.  Got lots of compliments from party goers!

I just made this for a party and it was a HUGE hit!!  I used about 4 small cloves of minced garlic...and, because I didn't have any fresh parmesan, I used another white, harder cheese I had on hand.  I couldn't find "sundried tomato paste," so I used some bottled store bought sundried tomatoes in Olive Oil & Italian spices, and just chopped those up--then, like many other reviewers, kept that as a separate layer all by itself instead of mixing it with the basil & spinach in the food processor.  This was seriously delicious and i will make it for many future parties!!

I made this with the pesto recipe (i always use spinach in my pesto to make it less bitter) and it was good. There seemed to be not enough tomato forand it did not make a lot. It was sticking to the Saran Wrap so I put in in the freezer for a bit to remove it from the bowl and take off the Saran Wrap.

Brought this to Easter & everyone loved it! Could not find sun dried tomato paste, so used sun dried tomato pesto I found and it was great! I covered the ball with pine nuts after removing it from the bowl. Have some extra crunch when eating & also a great presentation. Would make this again!
