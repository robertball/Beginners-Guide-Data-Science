Instead of frozen hash browns I used two large russet potatoes.  Peeled them and grated them with the food processor grating blade and them into a salad spinner full of cold water.  I also grated 1/2 a white onion and added that.  Let the potatoes soak while the sausage was cooking.  Drain the potatoes and spin them dry.  Mixed it up along with the grated onion and it was ready to go into the oven in about 10 minutes.  I used an 8 x 8" casserole dish and it was just the perfect size.  It baked in exactly 45 minutes is a well pre-heated oven.  Next time I would add some cheese to the top in the last 10 minutes of baking and garnish with green onion to spruce it up a bit.  It made 4 very generous servings.  Note:  Diced Green chilies would be excellent in this.

Loved this basic recipe, but when trying to make this the first time, I also found that the recommended pan was too small and that there wasn't enough liquid, so I had to follow other reviewers' advice.  I had to use a larger 11x16 baking dish to fit the potatoes. I also used 2 cups of shredded cheese and 8 eggs with 1.5 cups of milk whisked in.  I folded the cheese and sausage into the egg mixture and then stirred  the egg mixture into the potatoes.  I baked it a little longer and it came out great!  I have also made it using chopped broccoli and diced cooked ham.  Next time I may even try to make it healthier with venison sausage, and shred my own organic potatoes.  I'm SO glad to have a delicious and versatile breakfast casserole recipe that isn't full of bread!  --Updated 4/21/2016:  Thank you, 80percentgray, for correcting the amount of potatoes in your yummy recipe above.  We love it!  I recently made it for dinner using my own shredded organic potatoes, venison sausage, organic spinach, mushrooms, minced garlic, Daiya vegan cheese, and reducing the (almond) milk by 1/4 cup.  Delicious!

I doubled it and used 8 eggs.   I put it in a 9x13 pan.  I used half the amount of salt and pepper.  It was still salty, I'd use no salt/pepper next time.  Used a cup of milk total.  I also used 1 lb. of sausage.  I tried to follow other suggestions for the recipe.  It was good, but like I said, I think it would be fine with no salt.

This was a workable dish, although it could not all be fit in a half-casserole as suggested. For me, it fit more appropriately in a three-quarters casserole dish, and I used 20 ozs of the "Simply Potatoes" fresh hash browns from the refrigerated meat section and squeezed the moisture out of them between paper towels. Like some others, I found that in 45 minutes baking time, the egg & milk mixture was still too wet. Flavor would not have been as good had I not chosen to add a half-cup of scallions. I did add a little extra grated cheese on top, as others have suggested. The foodie guests whom I served this to, and I, agreed it would be even better with some chopped fresh mushrooms and some diced fresh green or red pepper, or a small can of green chilis.

Made this today as written, and it was very good. It took 60 mins for the eggs to set, but that may just be my oven. Next time I will probably add a little onion & maybe extra cheese on top. I used regular pork sausage flavor, but you could totally change it up with sage flavor or hot. Will definitely make again!

Recipe does need tweaking!  Don't add the salt as others mention.  I added maybe a shake or two and that was plenty!  I can't imagine if I would've added 1.5 teaspoons?!?!  I also used 8 eggs and eyed the milk to make it what looked like the right consistency, maybe a 1/2 cup.  I added 1/4 cup red onion, red & green pepper to the sausage as well. Realized I forgot the mushrooms I wanted to add as well until after I had everything in the 9 x 13 dish and so topped it with those.  Put it in the fridge overnight so that Christmas morning I could just pop it in the oven.    Baked 45 minutes then added a little cheddar cheese to the top and put back in oven to melt it.  It was delicious!  I got up early to put this in the oven so that my 22 year old son could eat a nice warm breakfast before having to work Christmas morning....  I had to beg the little stinker to eat it because he isn't "much of an egg person".  Who know since not too long ago (like a year!)  he was making egg scrambles nearly every morning.  He had seconds and took some with him to have for lunch!  I would rate it 5 stars with the changes I made per others suggestions!  This will be my go to breakfast for holidays and is easy enough it may be a go to breakfast during the school year as well!  Enjoy!

I added 6 eggs instead of 3 and used Potatoes O'Brien (diced potatoes with peppers and onions) instead of plain hashbrowns.  It set within the time frame stated in recipe.

This is super easy and delicious! I doubled the original recipe, using 1lb spicy sausage and 1lb original sausage. I precooked the hash browns in the pan that the sausage had been cooked in until they were just barely browned.  Lastly, I added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder to the egg mixture before baking. 45mins in the oven was just enough time, even with the recipe being doubled. Fantastic recipe - I will make it again and again!

Thought the recipe was great. Used refrigerated hash browns, so that step was easier. Sauteed some chopped onion with our homemade venison/pork sausage and added some sliced, fresh mushrooms to the pan to cook a bit before adding to the mix. I cut the salt by 1/2 tsp. and it tasted just right. Made it "pretty" by sprinkling with paprika and dried parsley flakes before baking. I'll definitely be making this again.

I did some things differently but still adhered to the recipe (meaning I used all the ingredients listed). I doubled the recipe, cooking it in a 9x13 casserole dish. I made my own hash browns by shredding 6 medium potatoes, followed by putting them in a bowl of lightly salted water. I then drained them, squeezing out the excess water. I added 1/2 shredded onion to the mixture. I then sprayed cooking spray at the bottom of the casserole dish and spread 2/3 of the hash browns at the bottom to make a crust. I put in the oven for 15 minutes while making the mixture. I used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk and added the other half shredded onion to the other mixture (2 lbs Jimmy Dean regular pork sausage, 1 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, and  the rest of the shredded potatoes). I sprinkled some cheese on top and put in the oven for the 45 minutes suggested but after the 45 minutes, the eggs were not set. This may be because I doubled the recipe. That is okay. It just needed an additional 15 minutes. While making this I did NOT add as much salt as the recipe calls for. Some of the ingredients already contain salt. It was a good breakfast casserole recipe and we served it with biscuits as my six year old had her heart set on biscuits with our next breakfast for dinner.

Very good recipe! I made it for a church brunch, so I did the overnight version and had everything ready the night before and just quickly threw it all together and baked. It turned out excellent and I got lots of compliments on it!! I do get my meat from an actual butcher, so the ground pork is very lean compared to store bought. I give this recipe 5 stars for simplicity and excellent flavor!

Made it just as written and everyone raved about it. One thing about the original recipe, it will never fit in a deep dish 9" pie dish! I put mine in a 2 qt. casserole dish and it filled it to the top!

I did mix the sausage, hash browns and cheese the night before. The next morning I topped it with the eggs and milk, then put it in a cold oven & turned it to 350. It took maybe 15 minutes longer. 

This one is a keeper!

I made this using Simply Potatoes hash browns (20 oz bag minus 1 1/2 cups), 1 hot Italian sausage, 1 chicken & jalapeño sausage, omitted most of the salt except for maybe a shake or 2 (so glad I read the other reviews!  Not much salt needed), added 1 small can of green chiles and lots of mushrooms, used 4 eggs instead of 3, and cut the milk in 1/2.  Next time I make it I will do the exact same thing except I will use a full cup of milk.  Cooked in the oven for approximately an hour.  It was Delicious!  4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few changes to the recipe.

I thought this recipe was great, and everyone else loved it too.  I used the suggestion for the 20 oz. packages of  simply potatoes refrigerated hash browns instead of frozen, I increased the eggs to 5, and increased the amount of cheese.   I also used a 9x13 dish and it was just right.

This was just ok. It didn't have a lot of flavor and definitely needed to be "dressed up".

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was so well received that I plan on making it our annual Christmas breakfast.  I used Potatoes O'Brien instead of plain hash browns and I used Jimmy Dean's Maple Sausage. The peppers and onions in the potatoes gave this dish great flavor as well as some nice color. Another great thing about this dish was how easy it was to heat and serve left-overs, not to mention that the flavor was just that much better after having sat for a day or two. :)

I liked this a lot.  I used five medium potatoes diced small and added cheese onto the top the last ten minutes.  I will probably try some diced onion, green pepper, and maybe green chilis next time.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used the Simply Potatoes hash browns rather than frozen.  I used five eggs, and one cup of milk, I also added sautéed mushrooms and chopped green onions. I didn't use any salt, because it really didn't need any. The zesty sausage was perfect, I don't think I would ever try it with a different kind. I made this the night before and just refrigerated it until we were ready for breakfast the next day, and it turned out just fine! Highly recommend it, so easy and so yummy!

Made this for Christmas morning, breakfast for eight. Everyone thought it was "sorta" good, but no one raved about it. I prebaked the hash browns per advice from reviewers, but thought the potatoes still made it heavy and solid in texture. I'll leave it at four stars because my grandchildren ate it, but it's more of a three to me and I'll be trying a different egg casserole next time.

It's not very good unless you work with it. The first time I made it it was very bland and I had to use double the eggs and milk because how much it called for didn't even come up to half of the hash browns/cheese/sausage. So after a few times I got it how I liked it and now my dad asks for it every week. I added cayenne, cumin, paprika, and garlic powder to the eggs/milk and it was much more flavorful, and like I said I doubled the eggs and milk, plus I actually used cream instead of milk and the texture was much less tough, and I added some chopped onion and it was a nice touch. Lastly, DO NOT go by what the recipe says for how long to bake it, give it about an extra 30 mins. In conclusion, the recipe itself is not very good but you can tweak it to how you want it

This recipe worked perfectly. I cooked extra sage sausage and mixed it with the hash browns, cheese, salt and pepper the night before serving.  I also added a little onion. The next morning it was easy to finish it up for brunch. A 9" square dish was the perfect size. The last 10 minutes in the oven I sprinkled the top with shredded cheese. The recipe could easily be adapted by using lactose free milk and sharp cheese.

I browned the hashbrowns in the sausage grease and used 6 eggs.  I sprinkles some extra cheese on top.  I only baked it about 45 minutes, but left it covered in the  oven until we were ready to eat it.  My family enjoyed it.

I liked this heartier version of breakfast casserole and thought it was a welcome variation. Unfortunately, my husaband is not a big potato eater. He prefers my regular recipe with just eggs, sasuage, milk and cheese and bread.

I doubled the recipe, and it just barely fit in a 9x13 pan. The taste was good, but the egg was completely lost. I think next time I'll add at least two or three more eggs. It was tasty and really filling, though. And excellent with chunky salsa.

I think out of all of the breakfast casseroles that I make, this one was the easiest...and very tasty!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I only used a dash of salt (instead of what the recipe called for), and I added a 1/4 tsp of onion powder and a couple shakes of dried sage.  It was delicious!  I will make this again and again, experimenting with different breakfast meats and veggies.

I just made this for the first time and did what many others have. I used 8 eggs and doubled everything else other than the sausage and only used a total of 2t salt.  It took much longer to cook by needing a 9x13 pan, but turned out moist and delicious. I will have fun using a variety of other veggies and meats to make this in the future.

The basic recipe is good, however like many other reviewers I sauteed onion and red pepper and added to the sausage.  I only used half of the hash browns and 5 eggs.  It was delicious!

Made this for breakfast  on the stove top b/c my oven is on the blink.
I browned sausage, then shredded a very large potato that I had on hand. I cooked the potatoes with sauteed onions until almost done. I added the sausage and the egg mixture (omitted the cheese..just my preference) and cooked covered for about 20 minutes. 
This dish did not brown because it was not baked in the oven. I plan to make again when the oven is repaired.
That being said, it was still delicious and very inexpensive to make!

The ratio of milk, egg, cheese and potato seemed out of balance when I read the recipe. I cut the milk to half of the quantity noted in the recipe and still had to add 20 minutes to the cooking time to get it to set up.  added additional cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking. It was worth the wait! will make again. 4 stars due to needed adjustment to recipe,

My husband and I love it. I followed some of the other reviewers’ advice by doing 8 eggs, 2 cups of cheese, 2 cups of milk and only salt and pepper in the egg mixture. I also tried it with turkey sausage the second time and still great!

I followed this recipe as written except I did add some cheese to the top.  I have to say I did use a larger casserole pan as that is what I had, and it did come out ok, everything was cooked perfectly and crispy,  HOWEVER, in my case I didn't get enough flavor from the sausage, and thought that the potatoes overwhelmed the recipe .  This is a easy peesy recipe start, so next time, less potatoes, more meat, maybe chorizo, maybe bacon, or maybe sausage and bacon.  I will also season it with some extra seasoning and onion and green pepper.  As I said, this is a great throw together , super easy recipe that anyone can change around to meet their families tastes.  Thanks  for sharing it

I read most of the reviews before making the dish.  Usually, any attempt in making a recipe is “as written”, however, I made a few changes on my first try.  We don’t eat pork so I substituted hot Italian turkey sausage (removed casings).  While I browned the sausage I threw in a red onion, I used a little canola oil to brown the meat and drained in colander.  When I put the dry ingredients together I threw in a jalapeño pepper, just because I thought it would be pretty and I like pretty things.  Following other reviewers recommendations, I cooked in oven for 60 mins.  I used the exact measurements for the entire recipe and did not find it salty, but it may be due to change in meat and use of kosher salt.

Everyone loved this casserole!  The one change I made was once I sautéed the sausage and drained it, I added the hash browns to the pan and browned them up a little bit.

I made this with one substitution- vegan chorizo for sausage since I do not eat pork. I also doubled the eggs and adjusted the milk like the top review said to. It ended up being a waste of expensive ingredients. I ate less than half of what it produced over the span of a week. It may have been the fault of the chorizo (from Trader Joe’s) but I could not see or taste the egg in this dish. I would not recommend or make it again.

Wow, so yummy! So easy to make and fits in with my busy single life-style very well. I love this recipe but found that as written it's too salty for my taste. I leave the salt out completely. This dish lends itself to a little playing with. I've found that onions, green chiles and mushrooms all make great add ins.  Sometimes I substitute chorizo for pork sausage. Oh, wow! That really gets me going in the morning!

Yes, I did make changes. I used jimmy Jean Turkey Crumble sausage rather than the pork sausage. I used Hash brown patties and more cheese.

Good, easy recipe.  I should have put some onion in it to perk it up, but other than that really good.  I adjusted it for two people by using 1/2 bag of hash browns, and I put in extra cheese in the layers.

Second time I’ve made this. Omitted the salt and used sharp cheddar cheese so the saltiness was perfect. Only additions I made was one diced bell pepper and one half diced onion. Note: if you forget to thaw your potatoes in advance, it will take twice as long to cook and will be a little watery in the middle!

Very good breakfast casserole. I used the food processor to shred three potatoes. After rinsing then twice in cold water, I fried them lightly to give them a crispy texture. I seasoned the potatoes and the eggs with salt and pepper and omitted the rest of the salt. Nice presentation.

I quartered up a can of tube biscuits and tossed that with the cooked/drained sausage. Added half an onion and thin of drained mushrooms. Put cheese on top. I left out salt because everything is pretty salty already. This is my favorite!

Was very tasty.  Used Sage Jimmy Deans sausage, would use the hot next time.  Also will use less milk and more eggs, was a little runny and did not seem to set.

The only change I made was that I used 8 eggs and added sage seasoning. My family enjoyed it but said it was missing something. My husband suggested I add sour cream the next time I make this.

I used hot sausage. It was good, but took way longer to cook/set-up, about an hour and a half. Not sure if I'll make it again.

Was in Quebec when I decided to make this recipe.  They do not sell ground pork break sausage or bags of hash browns.  I used breakfast sausage links (delicious) and hash brown patties instead.  I cooked the sausages then cut into pieces and baked the hash brown patties and cut into pieces.  From there I followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious!   
Having to make these substitutions made me realize how versatile this recipe is!

I doubled the recipe, using one 1 lb regular sausage and 1 lb hot sausage, 7 eggs, and lightly browned the hash browns in the sausage grease. I did not add any salt or pepper.  Everyone loves it!

It is very good! And very easy, but you need to add more time. I made a double batch in my 9x13 for work this morning and just had to microwave it for 8 minutes as there was runny egg in the bottom of the pan. :-( 
But this is the 2nd time I've brought it in and I get tons of compliments.

I used tater tots instead of hash browns, and it was a bit salty, but still very good. I would only use half the salt next time, but I'll definitely make it again. 
A double batch fills a 9 x 13 slightly more than half full.
I baked it exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfectly.

We found this recipe to be a bit on the greasy side, even though I thoroughly drained the sausage.  I made it the night before and it needed an extra 10 minutes of cooking time.  I also added an extra egg and some chopped onion.

I used frozen thawed hash downs. A pound of Jimmy Dean sausage with 6 strips of bacon browned. Chopped the bacon. Added chopped seeded jalapeño. Green onions. Raised the eggs to 5 and a cup and a half of milk with the cheese. No further salt added. Baked in 9x13 casserole. Perfect.

I found the recipe and my husband made it  for Christmas breakfast for the family.  Everyone thought it was good.  Next time we might add some veggies to round out the flavor.  We also didn't have hash browns but we smashed up tater tots and they worked fine also.

Super easy to create! We added in onion, red and green peppers and some seasoning salt.  Next time would probably put some more veggies (broccoli and mushrooms). Good base recipe to start with.

Had issues with the instructions....
1) when it says "1/2 (30 oz) frozen hash browns" does it mean half  the bag will be 30 oz or half of a 30 oz bag?
2) what size is half a casserole dish?
3) two cooking times were given...45 min and 1 hr...which one is correct?
It was quite tasty and well received...would add a bit more kick next time though...thanks

I added the onion and peppers that were suggested.  Used seasoned salt and a touch of yellow mustard powder.  Also added more eggs - used 6.  Used a 9x11 pan and that worked out great for a cooking time of 60 mins.  Great basic recipe that you can really be creative with.

I made it for the office crew.  I would follow the tips about NO SALT added.  It was easy to make and I made it the night before, added the eggs & milk in the AM and took it to the office hot. It was a big hit.  I will add the peppers, fresh mushrooms, and a little more cheese next time.  My husband wants it for Christmas brunch.

Make this for the first time, and it turned out great. I agree with the other reviewers, and will cut down on the salt. Just 1 tsp would be fine. Other than that, it was really good. Will be making this again for Christmas Brunch.

I made this for my friends. It was a huge hit with them and my daughters.  I used Italian seasoned pork sausage.  It added a ton of flavor. My girls are asking why I haven't made this sooner.

I've made this many times for a friend that had her first baby.  Her husband loved being able to get up in the morning and throw it in the microwave before work.  I did use mild sausage instead of hot.  Super easy and yummy.

Excellent and easy!  Used the hashbrowns with onion and white pepper.  Great flavor and a big hit on Mother's day morning (with grits, of course!).

Easy and delicious. The first time I made it I used frozen hash browns, and it was good, but the second time I tried Golden Grill Hashbrown Potatoes, it only takes 15 minutes to rehydrated them and they turned up better than the frozen ones. Either way this recipe is real good.

Fantastic dish not just for Breakfast.  My 15 year old son loves this recipe and we make it in advance so it can just be popped into the oven.  You can double with a large deep casserole dish and makes a great splurge dinner dish. Yum!

I didn't add salt to the eggs but did 1/2 milk and the rest half & half. I added the S&P to the mixuture which also had one onion and bacon(cooked) added. I put the cheese on top instead of mixing it in. After it was cooked I poured country gravy over it. Yum

I browned the potatoes with some diced onions and red pepper. Very tasty. It would be easy to make in a muffin pan too so that you could freeze and defrost individual portions.

Excellent breakfast.

I doubled the recipe, added a couple more eggs than called for and of course extra cheese.
Added fresh diced tomatoes, onion and diced zucchini. 

A major hit on Saturday morning.

Salsa on top for me please!

Really easy to make and very good.  It didn't fit in the recommended size of dish and there is way too much salt (I don't think I would use any next time).  I had some left over hot Italian sausage which I cut into cubes and it worked very well and added a nice spicy taste to the dish.  I added a little extra cheese as well.

Modified basic recipe by frying the hash browns first and by adding onion, peppers and garlic. We enjoyed the recipe a lot and will make again. We topped with salsa and sour cream before serving. Next time we'll add a bit more grated cheese.

Added one more egg but forgot the onion. Seemed a little bland. Maybe a spicier sausage would help.

I tend not to like breakfast casseroles that bake in the oven for the better part of an hour, impatient I guess. I used homemade venison sausage instead of pork, I'm sure it made it drier.

Made this for a Saturday night supper with a side of broccoli.  I had local, fresh sausage, just garlic and pork.  I found the casserole to be kind of dull.  
Next time, I think I might toss in half a cup of salsa and cut back the milk?  Have to try something to liven it up.

I have made a similar breakfast without the eggs. I used one pound hot sausage, one pound hash brown potatoes , and approximately one half bag of frozen cut  okra. Fry with cooking oil and season to taste. I cooked eggs separately. I call this Georges breakfast hash.

excellent! I made homemade hashbrowns instead of using frozen. added paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and chopped jalapeno, red pepper to sausage. Lots of cheese! Less salt is better. easy and yum!

Eggs needed over an hour to set and it was very very full in the 1/2 casserole. Will not use frozen potatoes next time. Very tasty, but needs a bigger pan or slightly higher oven temp

This was a very tasty dish that everyone in my family loved. It is a bit much to squeeze into a half casserole dish. I did manage to get it in there but it was all of the way to the top. Very easy to make though and has a great taste. I used regular sausage instead of hot since we don't eat a lot of spicy food. Overall a very good dish.

I found this recipe on here three years ago - I have made it for Christmas breakfast ever since!  SO simple, very easy to make ahead and refrigerate until you're ready to bake!   We just pop it in the oven once we all wake up Christmas morning, and it's done in no time!  I have two teenage boys, so between them and my husband, we don't have one bite left over!   Husband likes it with salsa, the rest of it like it as is!

This was a great recipe.  I have made it twice and did it  just like the recipe called for and added the onions.   By the way 1/2 bag of hashbrowns is 3 1/5 cups. This will definitely be a go to recipe for me.

was a great start to a delicious casserole.  like other folks, I doubled the amount of eggs, and added lots of veggies (yellow, red, orange and green pepper, onion,and mushrooms). served with fresh fruit and banana bread for brunch. everyone loved it. leftover casserole was warmed and served on soft burrito (w/ salsa) for breakfast the next day. yum.

What do you make for a Derby breakfast at work? That's right - anything with sausage!  Added diced green & red peppers and sweet onions to the sausage. Used 1/2 tsp salt, added dried ancho chili pepper,  onion & garlic powder, cumin and a bit of chili powder. Upped the ingredients to make it a double batch (and tripled the eggs), used some extra sharp and stinky cheddar and BAM it's a keeper!.

Recipe suffers a bit if you use milder sausage. Stick with hot or if you can't tolerate that use a little bit of Jalepeno jack to your cheese. Taste is good but a bit narrow. The suggestion to add onions (and peppers) is a good one.  One clarification, it is 1/2 of a 30 oz. bag, not 1/2 bag - 30 ounces of hash browns. It was a little confusing but you'll notice right away the recipe won't fit in the casserole dish suggested if you have 30 ounces of Hash browns. Nice dish, and simple.

It was delicious. I didnt measure but used all ingredients. I plan to make for large school breakfast so I did a trial run at home and my husband ate it and he's picky. I like the salt and pepper in my food because I like flavor.

I made this but I mixed half of it with ground turkey and the other half with Mexican chorizo.  Both sides tasted good, but I have to say the chorizo side was delicious.  Will definitely add this to my list of recipes.

This was amazing! I've made it twice now and love it any time of the day. Some changes I made: I used 8 eggs, regular sausage instead of hot sausage, put fresh chives in the mixture and cheese on top. I used a 9x12 baking dish to fit it all. I just cooked it until the eggs in the middle were cooked through. I also put some salsa on top and a dollop of sour cream after serving it onto plates. I'm thinking to spice it up some next time I'll put some sriracha in it just to test the flavor.

Made it this morning for our playoff brunch and it came out great!   I used  spicy Italian chicken sausage instead of pork and added half of a small onion and a quarter of a red pepper  after reading other people's experience.  The salt was cut waay back but I did add cayenne pepper (dash) and a splash of Chrystal hot sauce to the egg mixture along with the black pepper.  For milk, I used 1% because that is what I had on hand and it was fine.  The mixture fit perfectly into my casserole dish and it was done exactly at 45 minutes.  The gang gave it a big thumbs up so it will be on plates again!

I did make a few changes to accommodate for ingredients I did/did not have on hand. I substituted O'Brien hash browns  for the shredded ones and plain almond milk for the regular milk. I also reduced the salt to half a teaspoon and added 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp ground mustard. Enjoyed the final product! 1 1/2 tsp salt would have been too much.

I made this using leftover ingredients.  I had about a lb of fresh potatoes so I grated, soaked, and drained like the other reviewers recommended.  I had about a 1/2 lb of bulk sausage that I browned and drained.  I also grated a 1/4 lb block of cheddar.  I used 5 eggs and about a 1/4 cup of milk but there was not enough liquid so I added 3 more eggs and another 1/4 cup milk.  We like our breakfast casserole pretty hearty; the milk makes it fluffier.  I think next time I will quickly saute some onion and green bell pepper and throw that in too.  It all fit in a 9x6 pan.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was done.

Doubled the recipe and used a 10X13" pan. Not nearly enough liquid, so I added another 12 eggs.

Dbl the recipe but used 8 eggs. Tastes good but would take out the salt next time.  Maybe add some onions too and extra cheese on top.  I used a bit larger than 9x13 and baked for 45 minutes at 350.

Can't actually rate the recipe as written as I did not make it as written. I subbed buttermilk for fresh milk as I had it, and didn't want to waste it, added an extra egg and green onions. Used a cheddar/jack blend for the cheese and a combination of seasoned salt and Penzey's Northwoods seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Sprinkled with additional green onion after baking. BTW, watch salt amounts. The ingredients list gives one amount (which is clearly way too much), the body of the recipe gives another. Other than the salt it's pretty hard to mess this up. Good.

Loved this simple recipe because there are so many ways to customize it! I strongly dislike condensed soup and this was one of the first breakfast casseroles without it. I made this recipe as directed except with chorizo instead of breakfast sausage and the family loves it.
