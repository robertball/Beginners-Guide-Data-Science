I have been making this recipe for years but not in a skillet. Brown your chops (butterfly chops are the best, No bone) with seasoning. In a 9x13 pan pour in your Cream of mushroom soup OR golden mushroom soup with 1/2 can of milk. Bake @ 350 for 1 hour & cover with foil. MMMmmm good! The easiest & most tender chops around. Serve with potatoes & use the gravy.

I only gave this four stars as it is, but when I changed it a bit it was fantastic.  When I make this now, I brown the chops really well and then I de-glaze the pan with a bit of white wine.  after the alcohol cooks off a bit I lower the temp and add some minced fresh garlic, a pinch of thyme, the soup, the fresh mushrooms and put the chops back in.  Comes out fantastic every time.

This is a great recipe.  I poured a little olive oil in the pan and sauteed a clove of garlic before placing the salted chops in the pan.  Once they were brown, I removed them & sauteed the onion & mushrooms.  While those were cooking I whisked about a half cup of dry white wine & a half cup of milk in with the mushroom soup and added a tablespoon of fresh tarragon & some fresh ground pepper.  I returned the chops to the pan & poured the sauce over them.  I covered them & simmered for about 30 minutes.  There was pleanty of yummy mushroom sauce to pour over the chops & the rice.  This would be good with potatoes, too.  This is a recipe that when served looks like it took hours to make, but is really very easy.

I also use the golden mushroom soup for this recipe.  For a one dish meal, I just put the pork chops in a 9x13 dish, pour in all the ingredients, add potatoes and cover tightly with foil bake at 350 for about 40-45 minutes.  Big Hit at my house and really easy when you don't want to cook...which is pretty much every evening.

My husband loved this! I did make some changes based on reviews.  I tenderized the chops, rubbed in seasonings & browned them in a skillet with oil.  I sauteed onions w/ fresh garlic & then added them to the chops.  I increased the soup to 2 cans & added white wine & milk (I really felt that gave it more flavor, thank you to the reviewer who recommended that!) I poured it over & also added fresh mushrooms (I didn't saute them simply because my husband brought them home with him).  They turned out really well...I simmered it for a good 30-40 minutes.  I made mashed potatoes with it, and used the leftover mushrooms and onion to saute with some green beans and garlic.  The only thing I may try next time is a marinade before browning the chops to give them even more flavor.  I gave it a 5 because it's a wonderful base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking, I'm not sure if I would have liked it as much without the changes, though. Great meal idea, super easy and adaptable, thank you! :)

This recipe tempted me based on the few ingredients and time to prepare/cook.  As written, it was okay, not great, not bad!  Definitely lacking something....  hmmmm!  Probably will not make again without adding seasonings, so as written, only 3 stars.

Absolutely delicious!!  After the pork chops were browned I removed them from the pan and sautéed the onion and mushroom with some fresh garlic.  When the onion was tender I added some red wine (pinot noir) to de-glaze the pan then put the chops back in and added the soup mixed with a bit of milk.  This recipe was very easy and everyone in my family loved it.

I have made these pork chops for 30 or more years, and at first did this exact recipe.  However through the years I have tweaked it to my families liking and have found my families favorite way.  I brown the chops as stated here with a simple salt and pepper start.  After browning the meat, I remove it and place in a casserole pan.  I add the onions (lightly salt and pepper them too) into the fry pan with the meat's leftover grease and cook until they are translucent, add the mushrooms and cook another 6-8 minutes or so, I then add 2 cloves minced garlic and continue to cook about 30-45 seconds.  I then remove all of the veggies from the pan and put on top of the chops. Then deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup white wine.  Be sure to scrape all the bits of brown from the bottom of the pan.  I then add the can of mushroom soup and add the milk -cream- or half&half, whatever you have, and mix with a whisk until reheated again.  I then add some ground or fresh rosemary and thyme to the sauce and mix well again, then pour over the veggies and meat.  I sprinkle with a bit of Paprika, cover with foil and place in a 350 oven for about 1/2 hour.  I then remove the foil and cook another 15 min, remove from oven and serve with some creamy mashed potatoes.  YUMMMMM-O!  So tender and good you'll wish you made double!

Excellent with a few changes.  Mixed 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup white wine with soup, poured over browned chop mixture, and baked in oven for one hour covered.  Moist, tender chops with to die for gravy.

Awesome...I'll make this recipe again.  First I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning, browned the chops in olive oil and butter.  I don't like canned mushrooms so I used Shitake mushrooms and I sliced the onions in rings, then cut them in half so the onions were larger slices rather than chopped.  I used two cans of mushroom soup and mixed about a cup of white wine with the soup before adding it to the chops. I found that I needed to cook this longer than what's called for in the recipe, I cooked for a full hour and the chops were VERY tender.  Served with white rice, fabulous !!

This recipe was really delicious, and my father raved it was the "best pork chop recipe he'd ever tasted."  It was fairly easy, although chopping up the onion and mushroom can take a few minutes.

I made this for six pork chops.  While doing so,
I omitted:
- garlic salt

And added:
- 4 cloves chopped garlic
- 1/4 cup red wine
- 1 can lowfat cream of celery soup
- Flour (before serving) to firm up gravy

I added the red wine after sauteeing the onions, mushrooms, and garlic in a bit of olive oil.  I let that simmer for a few minutes before adding the soups.

Because I was waiting on my brother to get home from work, the pork chops simmered a bit longer than the recipe suggests.  At at the low temperature, though, I didn't have any problems.  It turned out fabulous!

Make it in one step - throw it all in a crock pot! Just use one can of soup, season to taste, and cook on low 4-6 hours. This was the very first home-cooked meal I made my husband in college, and I'm still using it 20 years later.

After reading a few reviews, I decided to follow Jennifer's.  It was DELICIOUS!  My husband said "You outdid yourself!".  Here are Jennifer's changes:

This is a great recipe. I poured a little olive oil in the pan and sauteed a clove of garlic before placing the salted chops in the pan. Once they were brown, I removed them & sauteed the onion & mushrooms. While those were cooking I whisked about a half cup of dry white wine & a half cup of milk in with the mushroom soup and added a tablespoon of fresh tarragon & some fresh ground pepper. I returned the chops to the pan & poured the sauce over them. I covered them & simmered for about 30 minutes. There was planty of yummy mushroom sauce to pour over the chops & the rice.

This is excellent ! I add a big spoonful of sour cream into the gravy the last 10 minutes you have to try that! Makes the gravy so much better!

Yummy!  First I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in EVOO, then added my salt and pepper coated chops.  After they browned I added in the mushroom, onion and cream of mushroom soup.  I also added a few tablespoons of milk to thin it out.  Set to med-low for 35 min (covered).  Turned out AMAZING.  The sauce was rich and had a very creamy taste.  I think the garlic was key :)

I finally found the recipe that produces tender pork chops! I've made this in the crockpot too, and really liked the results. I poured two cans of cream of mushroom soup in the crockpot, put the chops on top, added the mushrooms and chopped onion which I'd sauteed in a little olive oil, then topped everything with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I started these in the morning (about 10am) on low heat and they were perfect for dinner at 6pm. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This recipe was a breeze and super delicious!  As others had noted, I made a few changes as well.  I seasoned and browned the chops in a bit of olive oil in my skillet, then removed them and popped them into a 9x13 pan in 375 oven.  In my hot skillet, I added two minced cloves of garlic, one medium onion chopped, and the mushrooms.  I deglazed the pan with 1/2cup veg stock and finally added the soup. Once all hot and bubbling together and onions were tender, I poured this over the pork chops and returned to oven until cooked through.    These were great!

This is an excellent recipe. I passed it on to my son and he loves it also. I added 1/2 can of milk so as to have more gravy. I also substituted a jar of whole mushrooms for the fresh. Tonight I will be making it again. This time I am using sliced Pork Loin. Thanks you.

I did not salt the pork chops because the garlic salt was plenty. I actually laid the pork chops in my slow cooker, spreading the onion and mushrooms over the top of that. I did add a half cup of fat free evaporated milk because I wanted a thinner gravy. My family thought this was good. I served the chops with buttered egg noodles to soak up the gravy with garlic green beans on the side. There was enough for three dinners and a lunch for my husband tomorrow.

Artzbet...15 Jan., 2011  to ans your question about pork chops getting too dry.  A couple things.  When the instuctions say bake 20 to 30 min always choose the least amount of cooking time. Our Publix super makket here in Tallahasse offers weekly cooking classes for its customers.  This subjuect came up to one of the Chefs recently. His comment was, "if you think they are done you have waited too long"!  You don't have to worry about getting sick from under cooked pork like our mothers and grandmothers used to have to do.  Triganosis has been eliminated as a hazard due to new prep and feeding methods of pigs.

Fabulous! So easy. Will be a staple in our house! Seared the butterfly chops in our cast iron then deglazed the pan with 1/8 cup of beef broth, added the mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk and simmered for 30 minutes. Served over brown rice and a side of steamed veggies.

Yummers! I followed the advice of the other review's and used two cans of mushroom soup. I also browned the pork chops in the olive oil, 3 minutes on each side, then and additional three minutes for both sides. While the meat was browning I mixed the two cans of soup, a half a cup of sour cream and thre tablespoons of grated parm cheese in a bowl. Once the meat was done I deglazed the pan, add sauteed fresh mushrooms, red onion, and four cloves of fresh minced garlic until soft. Returned the meat to the pan and poured the mixture over the chops. Covered and cooked on the stovetop for 25 mins, stirring often. The pork chops were sooo tender. This is a keeper, will make again!

This recipe was so good! I did take other suggestions. First, I did not brown the chops but rather just seasoned them and placed them in a baking dish. I sauteed the onion and mushroom with butter and a little bit of olive oil. I then stired in the soup mix with 1/2 can of milk and cooked until simmering. I poured the mixture over the chops, covered and baked at 350 for 1 hour. It was the best pork chops I ever made! Highly suggest!

I've been making this for years as well. I sautee the onions until transparent then remove. I brown the chops after seasoning them well with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Accent. I then put the onions back on the chops in the skillet, mix equal parts mushroom soup with white wine (usually a whole can). I sprinkle in a little Kitchen Bouquet for color. No matter how thick the chops they come out fork tender and delicious. You can also use a drained  can of mushrooms but lately I've finely chopped a firm apple, letting it 'marinate' in the wine while prepping the meat and onions. My family likes it seved over a bed of noodles because of the delicious gravy it makes.
This is COMFORT FOOD!

I too, have been making this for years in the oven.  Peel and slice a 3-4 potatoes, mix the cream of mushroom soup with a little milk, reserve about 1/4 cup to top the pork chops.  Stir in the rest with the potatoes, put the pork chops on top of potatoes, top with remaining mushroom soup, cover with foil and bake 325 for about an  hour.  I usually put in some poultry seasoning or garlic to make it a bit more flavorful.

I make this dish but in the oven and adding a few ingredients extra makes its own gravy.  Just add a packet of powdered onion soup with a little milk.  Bake for about 45 mins. (depends on size of chops) covered.  Stir and your gravy is done!

This was excellent. My husband raved! We will make it again and again. So easy and quick. The only addition I made was adding a splash of vermouth to the gravy while cooking. Superb! Thanks for submitting this.

Made this tonight, FANTASTIC! I browned the pork chops then put them in my slow cooker, sauteed the mushrooms in butter, poured them on top of chops, and added some milk and garlic powder to the soup, heated it and mixed well then poured that on top of the pork chops, came out great, made a very nice gravy for the pork chops and mashed potatoes, I will make this again, Thank You!

As others recommended, I doubled the recipe. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I did bake in the oven after browning with onions and minced garlic cloves. My teenager who never ate my pork chops before asked for seconds. Delicious!

Very good recipe. Like a few others, I did change a few things. I browned the chops with onions then placed into a baking dish with white wine, milk and the soup. Baked at 375 for 45 mins with foil, uncovered for the last 10. Probably would have been better at 40ish mins. Wonderful wonderful wonderful gravy! I was licking it off the spoon while putting away left overs. I'm trying to save my left overs for work but having a very hard time waiting :)

This is a go to/pantry meal that I prepare often.  I always have these ingredients on hand and my family won't eat pork chops any other way.  I don't use onions at all.  I use a pork tenderloin cut inot 1/2 inch thick slices, season with salt & pepper and brown them in a little oil.  I thin out the Cream of Mushroom Soup with about 1 cup of milk and add Worcestershire sauce.  Add a can of sliced mushrooms (drained) and simmer, covered on the stovetop.  Simple and delicious!  I always serve over brown rice to make it a bit more healthy.  Add some steamed vegetables and dinner is on the table in less than 30 minutes!!!  Great weeknight meal, quick, simple and delicious!  This was the meal I used to get my kids to eat brown rice.  If you cover the rice with the gravy they don't even realize they are eating brown rice.  We have gotten to the point now that my kids prefer the brown rice over white rice! It's a small victory in my nutritional quest to get my kids to eat healthier and actually enjoy it!

Awesome!  I changed it a little using some suggestions posted in other reviews. I browned the chops in olive oil and then removed them and added the white wine then the chopped garlic and onions and mushrooms and a little paprika and sauted it all for a few minutes and  added the mushroom soup and stirred it all together.  Then put the chops back in in the large skillet  and covered.  Cooked for 30 mins. on medium-low.  Checked and stired occassionaly and flipped the chops over once while cooking.   Removed the chops when done and then poured the soup mixture with the mushrooms, garlic and onions into a bowl and wisked in a large dollup of sour cream.  Served the chops on a platter and the gravey /sauce in a bowl with a ladle to add to the top.  Sprinkled with sliced green scallion tops.  Wow...this was really good and it presented beautifully.   It was only my husband and I for dinner, but I would definitely make this for company,  Very easy and little time to prep and cook.  Only one skillet to clean.   NICE!!  Served with steamed rice from a microwave bag, but egg noodles would be great also. I loved that gravey!!!

A Five-Star Weeknight meal! I read through a lot of the reviews before making this one and took these suggestions: Used fat-free cream of mushroom, added one cup of milk, half cup of red wine and two sprigs of rosemary - the rosemary and wine really make it great. I baked it, instead of cooking it on the stovetop, for 45 minutes at 350.

With a few tweets taken from other reviewers this was delicious!  I sautéed some about 1t. minced garlic in a couple tablespoons of butter. Add the chops on med/high heat. Browned each side, stacked them off to one edge of the pan and added the mushrooms and onions. Sautéed til tender, removed the chops, deglazed the pan with some white wine, stirred in the soup and re-added the chops. I put them in the oven because I was also v

This was really good.  The chops were tasty and tender.  I made according to recipe with the exception I did not add the soup.  We are trying to watch our weight and decided after starting to cook this that I would try it without the soup.  The juices from the pork chops and mushrooms made a delicious broth.  I know it would be great with the soup too.

My Mom used to make this recipe (basic) as a standby when I was growing up. I made it for my family for years as well. To add a really nice twist to it, try browning portabella mushrooms and regular white mushrooms as well as using an entire onion also sauteed. Deglaze the pan.....white wine...the mushroom soup whatever you like. Seasoning and browning the chops is key......adding all the brown goodness to your casserole dish. I always finish mine in the oven....makes clean up in the kitchen a breeze after dinner. It's great with basmati rice, any type of potato dish or egg noodles.

Fresh mushrooms make all the difference in the world to this recipe. Growing up my mom made chops with just a can of cream of mushroom soup, but when I made it this recipe my family loved the new addition. I seared the chops, then sauteed the onion and garlic, then added mushrooms. When everything was cooked I added some white wine and a can of mushroom soup with a splash of milk. Served with mashed taters and a fresh veggie and this was a comforting meal. Thanks for sharing.

This came out great.  I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added 1/3 c whi wine, 1/2 c milk and didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I used canned but still came out great.  Make mash potatoes as a side dishes.  To say they were licking their fingers.

Followed another review by browning chops a little (not cooking them all the way through) in a skillet with seasoning mix (frozen) and mushrooms in the grease (olive oil) I used to brown the chops. Add the soup and a half-can of milk. Then put them in the bottom of a glass pan and poured the sauce on top. Baked at 350 for about an hour. Served over brown rice with a French style vinaigrette salad and whole (frozen) green beens (with butter). Yummy and easy!

I made this last night, and just finished off the leftovers for lunch.  So good!  I took the advice from other viewers here and browned the chops, took them out, deglazed the pan with a chardonnay and sauted onions with three cloves of garlic for two minutes, then added the mushrooms for one more minute.  I poured the soup (I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic) over, added 1/2C skim milk and then tossed the chops back in.  I covered and let simmer for 30 minutes.  This was EXCELLENT with fresh green beans on the side (I'm on a low-carb diet so potatoes weren't an option though it would have been just as good).  This is a quick, healthy, and great recipe!  I will make it again for sure!

FANTASTIC!  Outstanding pork chop recipe.  After browning the chops, I sauteed the onion, garlic, and mushrooms in red wine, added the cream of mushroom soup, and transferred all to a 9X13 dish and baked covered for 45 minutes.  The aroma was intoxicating.  (Oops..maybe I should have used white wine with pork?  It was still unbelievably delicious.)  *****++++

I love this recipe. It produces fork-tender, totally delicious pork chops every time, and I absolutely adore mushrooms. I love it with rice or mashed potatoes.

My BF doesn't care much for it, but he's weird. I think he just doesn't like recipes with cream of mushroom soup...total bummer, because I love cream of mushroom soup with any meat. :)

This was not bad, I added extra mushrooms just because I love them and I wanted to use them up.  I only had boneless pork chops and think they cooked too long, bone-in would probably work better.  I think this could use a little more flavor, garlic possibly.

I have made this many times over the years and its good no matter if you use a skillet, bake in the oven or in a crockpot. All works well. I it make as is or add onions, bell pepper strips and extra mushrooms (my favorite). Good with rice or mashed potatoes (not a fan of this with noodles but use egg noodles when I do). Fast and fabulous.

Great base recipe. I modified it too and sauteed the mushroom with minced garlic and chopped onion. Then thinned the soup with red cooking wine and served it over rice. I think it could also go well with chicken breat instead of pork chops or served over egg noodles. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This is a quick, easy weeknight recipe.  My husband and son really liked it.  Next time I will saute some onion and fresh garlic to add to it.  I served it over egg noodles, but it would be great over mashed potatoes too.  I used golden mushroom soup, because that is what I had on hand.

This was absolutely delicious.  Took other reviewer suggestion and added 1/2 cup skim milk to the soup. I also cooked the mushrooms and onions a bit and threw in 1/4 white wine to let it reduce down before adding the chops back in. The gravy was golden brown and served with white rice and roasted Parmesan lemon broccoli.

It was good for a quick weeknight meal. Easy, cheap and fast fare with good flavor. I added a bit of wine to the sauce as it was cooking and sauteed the mushrooms and onion with some garlic and olive oil first....

I found this recipe very bland....Added extra garlic and fresh thyme and still felt like something was missing....it needed one more "layer" of flavor....The chops, however, were very moist.

This is a good recipe. Try it with wild rice too. Just makes sure you cook the wild rice first. I simmer mine in chicken broth. saute some celery and onion in a little butter, add the rice and soup, put your browned pork chops on top and bake until done.

Great!  Per other reviews, I sauteed the garlic, then browned the chops, then cooked onions and mushrooms for a couple of mins.  I mixed 2 cans of soup with sherry cooking wine (didn't have white wine) and milk - 1/2 c each and poured over it.  Covered and simmered for 30 mins.  I made extra sauce for gravy for my potatoes!  Excellent!  All ate it and loved it.  Super fast and easy!!

Very easy and very tasty!  I've also made this dish without the onions and mushrooms, and used 2 cans of Golden Mushroom Soup with a cup of milk to thin the soup - it makes an excellent gravy.  I've simmered it up to an hour, for a tender, melt in your mouth meal and always serve it over rice. I also use garlic powder or granulated garlic in place of garlic salt. Grandkids love it!

I gave 5 stars both to Melissa and the other reviewers since I combined several suggestions/recipes to make this wonderful dish. I did the pan thingy and then went on to place them in a pyrex and bake. I served the wonderful gravy over buttered egg noodles. We did homemade bread also. A nice Sunday evening supper - YUM!

Yum!!  This reminds me of my childhood (COM soup, pork chops and rice), but soooo much better with the addition of the fresh mushrooms and half an onion.  I used 98% fat-free COM, diluted with a little bit of milk.  Delicious!!  I had to put the leftovers away before my husband and I finished them off!  I can't wait to give this recipe to my Mom.

There I was: it was blowing cold with sideways rain, and it was dark outside... wife coming home from the barn and me without all the ingredients. I didn't have fresh 'shrooms, but I had dried mushrooms. I didn't have stock, so I used chicken-boullion in water and boiled those dried mushrooms tender. Then I used some of that stock to dilute the mushroom soup and I added in some crushed red pepper. I had no fresh garlic so I massaged in some garlic powder and black pepper into those chops. Browned 'em in bacon drippings, smothered 'em in the gravy, and cooked 'em down. I made Jasmine rice in chicken broth and spooned the chops and gravy over the top. I'd have taken a photo, but it all disappeared so fast! Yeah, that night ended well...

Excellent recipe!!!  Works great with chicken.  Only changes I made was to saute the onions, mushrooms, and some slice garlic before browning the chicken and adding the cream soup.

Great recipe for an easy, flavorful, and relatively inexpensive dish. Like several other cooks, I used sauteed garlic instead of garlic salt. This is a great weeknight dinner and I will definitely be making it again.

Very easy and tasty! Easy to put the sauce and ingredients together. I love the mushroom soup simmered on top of the pork chops. I added 1 garlic clove instead of garlic salt and used Maui onions (sometimes Red Onions). I added a lot more sliced buttons mushrooms and I served this over hot rice. Fried pork chops with a creamy white mushroom sauce and lots of mushrooms is what I would consider comfort food. ONOlicious! UPDATE:10/07/11 Family request to make this again. Served with, "Bacon Rosemary Mashed Potatoes," and "Garlic Green Beans," from this website.

I have mixed reviews on this recipe.  First of all, I took the suggestion of other reviewers and deglazed the pan after browning the chops, with white wine and added freshly minced garlic, thyme, and a half of can of evaporated milk.  I thought the sauce was delicious and really seasoned the mushrooms well!  I found that the pork chops were not all that flavorful themselves.  Next time I'll probably marinate the pork chops in some kind of seasoning (maybe mojo???) before browning them. The gravy that this makes tastes delicious on roasted potatoes by the way!!

Updated --- I tried this recipe again and instead fried the pork chops with italian bread crumbs! Made a difference!  Also used the white wine combination mentioned above.  Everyone loved it!

Really good.  I think I browned the chops a little too long (4-5 mins each side, thick & boneless) because they were dry so next time, I will brown them for about 2-3 mins on each side and add a little salt & hot peppers to the mixture (because I like spice).  I also did what others recommended:  seasoned chops in EVOO & placed in glass baking dish - sauteed onions, 3 cloves of garlic & mushrooms - mixed cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of white wine and poured this mixture over the browned pork chops & veggies.  Baked at 375 covered with foil for an hour.  Served it over brown rice.

It's hard to rate this recipe because I didn't exactly follow it, but it was definitely the basis for what I did so I gave it five stars.  I took the advice of JUSTJEN33 and did it in the oven.  I browned my butterfly chops, added garlic to my mushroom and onion saute and deglazed my pan with Chardonnay.  I used milk when I mixed in the soup.  It was terrific with the brown rice.

I changed this because I wanted to bake it and forget about it, and I didn't have any fresh mushrooms or onions.   I followed "Justjen33's" review fairly closely.  Thank you, Justjen33! They turned out excellent and couldn't have been easier.    1.)  I browned the chops on both sides in a skillet with olive oil after seasoning them as directed, then I transferred them to foil-lined baking pan.   I didn't have any white wine, so  2.) I deglazed the pan w/ a bit of white wine vinegar to get the brown bits stuck to the pan off and into my "sauce."  I poured this in pan w/ the chops.   3.) I then poured equal parts of condensed mushroom soup and milk over the chops in the baking pan.  [I whisked together while the chops were browning.) 4.) I covered the pan w/ foil and baked for about an hour at 350.    CAUTION: when you undo foil after removing chops from the oven, there will most likely be a lot of EXTREMELY hot steam that's dying to escape.   BE CAREFUL!!! These came out deeee-lish, and there was a bunch of fabulous, flavorful gravy to douse all over mashed potatoes (or whatever side you'd like.)  ENJOY, and thx to all who contributed ideas!!!

I ended up baking the chops after browning, as one reviewer suggested. I found them to be a bit tough and dry, but tasty.

This was the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried. It was moist, tender and delicious ! The only thing I changed was to saute the onions and mushrooms for about ten minutes first. Delicious !

Two stars for easy, and because my wife liked it. To me, it was very disappointing. The gravy had very little flavor, even though I used golden soup and sauteed onions and mushrooms. Even added a bit of sour cream to try to sharpen it up.  Served over pasta, it was seriously bland.  I was expecting some meat flavor.  Maybe should have added bouillon granules.

This was so good. The only change I made was I added a little milk, more garlic and a pound of mushrooms. WE love mushrooms. We served it over white rice. I will be making this again real soon! YUMMY!!

My 'hates pork' husband loved this.  I gave it 4 stars only because I did it a little differently.  I browned the seasoned pork chops in 2 T of Olive Oil, removed the chops, then deglazed the pan with white wine (about 1/3 C).  When the alcohol burned off, I added 1T of crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp of thyme and the onions.  Then I added the soup, the onions and returned the pork chops to the pan.  Yum!

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few tweaks, like most of those reviewing.  I used two pounds of mushrooms and one whole sweet onion. I browned some garlic in olive oil in the pan, then removed the garlic and browned the pork chops really well.  Then I removed the chops and set them aside.  I put some butter and olive oil in the pan and all of the sliced mushrooms and onions.  Once the moisture from the mushrooms had evaporated and everything was nice and brown, I put about 1/4 cup of milk, the pork chops, and some tarragon in the pan with the onions and mushrooms.  Then I poured the Cream of Mushroom Soup on top of the chops and covered it all for 30 minutes.  It turned out delicious!  It was a big hit and I will definitely make it again.

Sooo Good.  I browned my chops and then added minced garlic and diced green onions(all I had).  Removed the chops to a casserole dish and added the mushrooms.  Deglazed the pan with a couple of swirls of white wine (great suggestion).  I mixed a 1/2 cup milk the wine, garlic & onion mixture with the soup and poured over chops and mushrooms.  Cover and baked.  So good with mashed potatoes.

DELICIOUS and so easy!!!  I added about a cup of white wine to the mushroom soup before pouring it over the chops and it made a big difference, I think.  I also added everything to a covered baking dish to finish in the oven as I didn't have a lid big enough to cover my sautee pan.........  Highly recommend this recipe - thank you!!!!

So good!  I browned the chops, removed, then sauteed onions and mushrooms, added milk and soup, then threw everything in the oven at 350F for 30 mins or so. Tasty, moist and tender.

I don't know about this recipe, I have tried it twice and both times the chops are super dry.  I usually have great luck with recipes from this site.  I would like to know if anyone else had the same problem.

Yum, Yum, Yum! I sauteed a clove of garlic in the pan before adding the chops to brown. Seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and thyme. Mixed 1/4 cup milk & 1/4 cup white wine with the mushroom soup before pouring over the chops. Excellent served over egg noodles or mashed potatoes. Thanks :)

I have made this type of recipe before...the only thing I do different is slice potatoes thinly with the skin on and line them on the bottom of the baking dish. Next, I place the pork chops on top of the potatoes, and sprinkle chops lightly with Lawry's season salt and a little garlic.  I then top with soup, cover the dish with foil and bake. I have even used cream of chicken soup in a pinch and that has been fine too.

This was only OK; I had high hopes for it, but it was quite bland - even after I did the garlic and wine as recommended by others. Seemed like it was the recipe on the side of the soup can. My husband asked me not to make it again. Sorry.

This is the best pork chop recipe I have made.  My husband and I loved these pork chops.  I made white rice to go along the side, which went great with the extra mushroom sauce.  My husband even had this for lunch the next day.

I sided with the reviewers who chose to bake the chops raw in a casserole dish rather than browning first. I added the raw mushrooms and onions (in hindsight I recommend sauteeing the onions for a couple of minutes first). I also sprinkled some rosemary, suggested by another reviewer. Next time I may add a touch of sherry. My family rated this one a "keeper". Thanks for such an easy recipe- this one is great when you're busy on a Sunday night getting ready for the work and school week. I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers.

I thought this was great! Considering the "basic" ingredients, they all meshed wonderfully. I used real garlic and added a 1/2 cup milk to the soup. This was a really wonderful, tasty meal I thought. My husband isn't big on "fresh" mushrooms, and he really like this too. One of the best recipices I have pulled off this site.

Excellent recipe! I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes to ensure an equal cook time.  I also used the mandolin to slice the onions - and would suggest you double the amount of onion called for, as then do tend to cook away.  I also sprinkled the opnions with a little sugar while browning in the porkchop drippings and they were carmalized beautifully and were delicious.  I baked covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered and baked for 15 more minutes - just to brown the potatos, as they were thoroughly cooked. Probably should have just put the whole dish under the broiler for a few minutes.  Turned out great. Will try this with cream of celery soup next time.  A little tired of mushroom soup!  Thanks for the recipe, Marty.

Pretty good. I used 6-1" chops in a 9x13" dish and baked them (with sauce topped on them). I doubled the amount of mushrooms and added some sour cream. Next time I will add a smidge of wine.

This was a great recipe.  The sauce was very tasty.  We served with rice and a salad.

I have been making this for 40 years! Have not made it in a while, though. Basically the same only I add thickly sliced carrots and use either golden mushroom soup, pork or beef canned gravy. The golden mushroom soup or one of the gravies give a deeper color and richer taste than cream of mushroom soup. It's a nice cold weather standby recipe. Good with buttered wide noodles, rice or mashed potatoes. If you add the carrots, you have the vegetable already. The carrots cooked in the onion gravy mixture are very good. Thank you for posting and reminding me of this oldie, but goodie! ;)

This turned out to be one of the best mushroom sauces I have ever tasted. I use white wine to deglaze the pan I sautéed the veggies in. OMG the pork chops were tender and juicy. I sautéed kale and top mashed taters with the sauce. My kids are my biggest critics and they loved, loved, loved it! Oh and my husband kept kissing me in between bites!

Even with adding a few spices, the dish was too bland. It was very easy to make and is great in a pinch.

I made it twice, but the second time I made my own mushroom sauce, it was better without the Cream Of mushroom soup, and my own sauce.

This recipe should call for 1/2 ounce fresh chopped garlic, tenderized bone in chop at room temp lightly coated in flour then seared in light olive oil. Cook 1/4 lb. of baby Bella mushroom on the side with light butter and salt and pepper to taste. Cook pork chops for only 3 min. per side(yes they will be under cooked) but remember we are essentially recooking the pork when we simmer the chops in the cream of mushroom soup. Finally add in all ingredients to one large skillet and simmer on very low heat covered for 20 min. Uncover and add fresh chopped scallion and Italian parsley for flare and serve over a bed of white rice with olive oil and chopped green onion mixed in and presto a refined family favorite for all!

This is a great "quick" meal; I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used the condensed cream of chicken that I did have and it still came out great. I personally thought the sauce was a bit too thick and I think adding some wine (deglazing the pan with it) and some more herbs would have done it wonders. Next time!

I love how easy this recipe is.  However, I baked mine in the oven @ 350 for about 45 minutes or until the chops were done. I found this helps keep them moist.

Delicious!  I added Sweet Vermouth, and it was amazing.  Stuffing the pork chops was a little tricky (hence the missing star) but the flavors are yummy.

This was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend who isn't very fond of pork, and he really enjoyed it! I took the advice of some other reviewers by sauteing the onions and mushrooms in garlic, browning the chops, adding 2 cans of condensed soup ,and 1/2 a can of milk. I popped it right in the oven at 350 for about 30-40 minutes. I have to say, I would have liked the gravy better with 1/4 can of milk. It would have been creamier. It is also very important you salt the chops!

We were surprised at how good this is, since I have used these same ingredients in a crock pot, but never with these results!  I used a pork tenderloin and think the searing may have made a big difference.  I did not use fresh mushrooms, but left the tenderloin to sit in the sauce and onions for a day before baking, covered for an hour.  Very tender and very delicious!  (I made this the second time with sliced loin. It was tougher and not as good.  Definitely use the tenderloin.)

Delicious recipe! I dredged the pork chops in flour, salt, pepper, and garlic salt and browned them. After adding the rest of the ingredients I cooked it in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes before serving. The sauce was very creamy and worked great spooned over mashed potatoes.

This was sooo flavorful and SIMPLE!!!! I opted out on the extra mushrooms, as my hubby isnt a bog fan of them, but he really liked the cream of mushroom soup base!!! I sprinkled the top with paprika and then some freshly chopped green onions as a garnish and a little extra umph! A definite add to my cook book!

I used two large bone-in pork chops, about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic in olive oil, left out the mushrooms (because I didn't have any on hand. Will add next time.), and added chunky chopped potatoes, with skins. A key ingredient that I added was some milk -- this really added to the flavor and tenderness of the meat. Per suggestions from other reviewers I decided to put all ingredients into a baking dish, cover with foil (so that the steam baked the potatoes thru), cooked on 375 for about an hour. Served it all together and my boyfriend practically licked his plate. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Just like Grandma used to make. Follow Festie's suggestion adding potato slices mixed with some soup. Makes a great one-dish meal.

I thought this was an easy and quick dish.  I would definitely make it again.

A couple of notes:  (1) I browned the beef and then removed it from the pan while I cooked the onion and mushrooms.  The pork rested on the plate and when I added it back into the pan, I also poured the juices with it.  (2) I used a meat thermometer to monitor the meat.  I don't think I had to cook it the entire 20 minutes.  I used a boneless chop that dries out faster than a bone-in.  I let it go to 155 and it got up to the 160 when I removed it from the heat.

This was very good and very easy to make.  No doubt I will make it again but I think I'll possibly add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce to give it a little more pizz-azz.  My husband loved it -- declared it "GREAT comfort food"!

This was great. I threw in some minced garlic and olives. I also doubled the ingredients except for the cream of mushroom. I just used one can and then the can of milk and that was plenty. I will definietly make this again.

I made this for my fiancé and he absolutely loved it. He is not a very big pork chop fan and just gave me raving reviews!! I did too just throw everything in a pan. Except I modified it to 1 fun can of mushroom soup, fresh garlic clove instead on garlic salt, and i added 1/2 green pepper.  Covered it all with foil and cooked for about 1 1/4 hrs. When done I put it over spaghetti noodles and used the left over sauce from the chops. Unbelievably moist and very yummy!!!

I substituted pork steaks for pork chops because I had some in my freezer I needed to use.  This turned out wonderfully!  The meat was nice and tender and the sauce was delicious.  I added onions and diced green peppers to my sauce (I needed to get rid of them) and the onions gave it great flavor.  Can't wait to try this again with pork chops!

I though this was delicious.  I deglazed the pan with  1/4 cup of chicken broth, then added the soup and half a can of milk.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It made a great sauce and the pork just fell apart- Yum!

We LOVE it! I made a couple tweeks to it though. I brown the pork chops in just a bit of butter, then when it is time to add the mushrooms and onion, I remove the pork chops and give the mushroom and onion some room to cook on their own, and when they are sauteed I add the soup and throw the chops back in. It is absolutly delish served over brown rice.

I browned them in the skillet, then put them in a baking dish, poured the sauce over them, and baked them. They came out the most tender I have ever seen pork chops. Even my mother said they were the best she's ever tasted!

I used a small can of sliced mushrooms instead of fresh because I had it on hand. Since we had some errands to run I also cooked this is my Dutch oven on about 250 for 2 hours after browning the chops on stove in the Dutch oven and adding other ingredients in. The chops turned out tender but not mushy and the flavor was out of this world! My hubby raved all night about it and ate all the leftovers by himself the next day! My picky 9 yr old, who won't touch a veg, ate 2 helpings! I served with steamed white rice and green beans and some crusty french bread. Hubby has already put in a request to have it again. Thanks!

This recipe was great. My hubby, who doesn't love pork chops actually liked it! I added a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream for added kick. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is (which is rare for me!)

This was so yummy. I put in the crock pot & added 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken (it was all I had). I didn't add the salt (doesn't need it). I first added 4 pork chops, mushrooms, an onion and then poured the cans over it. I cooked it on low for 6 hours (probably could have done it for less. It was so yummy. I am definately adding this to my regular recipes!

I made this tonight and it was a hit. My fussy toddler ate all most all of it. I did pretty much as the recipe asked. The only difference was after I browned the chops and sauteed the mushrooms and onions. I put everything in a dish and baked it in the oven with some cooked egg noodles.  So good I will def make this again.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever made.  I added white wine and milk to the gravy and it was the best - I could've eaten that by itself with rice.  I will absolutely be making this again and I have a feeling we'll be fighting over the leftover chop for lunch tomorrow!

This is a great base recipe!  I substituted chicken breasts for the pork chops and browned them in olive oil, then removed them from the pan.  I then sweated the onion and a clove of chopped garlic, then added and sauteed the mushrooms until softened.  I added the can of soup mixed w/ 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup white wine, then added the chicken breasts back in.  I then put the pan (covered) into the oven at 350 for 25 min., and the chicken was perfect...very yummy dinner.  served w/ mashed potatoes.

Delicious and easy!  We like the gravy so well we double the ingredients (except the meat) so we have plenty.  Good good over rice, potatoes, noodles or biscuits. We made the gravy with hamburger patties and call it "Grandpa Steak!

if you like this recipe with mushroom soup, try this or any pork recipe which calls for mushroom soup and use cream of celery, you will be pleasantly surprised.

These were great. I took the advice from another user and baked the pork chops covered with foil in a baking dish for about an hour at 350. I threw all of the ingredients in the baking dish as well as a half of cup of milk before I covered. I made some garlic mashed red potatos and used the gravy on that as well. It was FANTASTIC!!!

MAde these for dinner last night, made a few changes used 6 chops, sprinkled with seasoning salt, garlic powder & pepper. Sauteed onions & mushrooms and and about half of cup of white wine. Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used golden mushroom soup. Browned the chops on both sides for a couple of minutes, placed in a baking dish, added the other ingredients and baked for 30 minutes. Chops were delicious!

Wow, this was fabulous.  As a previous poster suggested, I sauted garlic & onions in some oil.  Added the seasoned chops & browned.  Then transferred to a baking pan with 1 can cream mushroom soup & 1/2 can milk. As that baked, I boiled wide noodles then mixed with veggies.  Once the chops were done, I mixed the noodles & veggies in with the mushroom gravy, like a stroganoff.  Very yummy!

Was good, but the slow cooker made the prok chops fall apart and mix with the sauce.  A little too much like stew, so wasn't as appealing to look at.

Loved it! Perfect for a quick/easy weeknight supper!  Used the garlic salt on the chops AND added some fresh garlic to the pan while browning; doubled the soup and added about 1/2-3/4 c burgandy  to the sauce.  Delish!  Thanks Melissa!

Very good and tender. I added a little bit of milk to make more gravy for the mashed potatoes I cooked to go with it.

Snaps for Melissa! Great recipe. I read the other reviews & made some changes. I whisked together 2 cans of soup 1 can of milk & 1/2 can french onion soup and added that to the pork omitting the fresh onions & mushrooms for a smoother gravy. Can't wait to try it with chicken.

I am making this tonight for a second time.  It is tasty, and super easy!  We had ours with rice and peas.  It tastes like it cooked all day in a slow cooker.  GREAT RECIPE!

Awesome!!!  I LOVE this recipe and so many great suggestions to go with it! I made it tonite for the first time, and before I was done eating, my husband was filling his containers to take to work the next two days. Even my kids love it. I tweaked it a bit... here's what I did... First, I used Lawry's season salt instead of salt and pepper. I used garlic powder instead of salt. I used one can of golden cream of mushroom, a can of french onion soup, and 1/2 cup white wine. I sauteed two cans of mushroom pieces. I also simmered it about an hour, while I made the mashed potatoes to go with it. Yum! Thanks so much!

This was a great recipe.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and only had sliced baby bella mushrooms, but the pork was tender and the sauce was great.  Served over rice and it was a great meal.

This recipe, by far, is the easiest and tastiest pork chop recipe I have tried and I have been incorporating it into my meal plan for a few years. I add 1/2 can of water to the soup to increase the yummy gravy and serve it all on a bed of rice.

I made a super-simple version of this in my slow cooker.  I seasoned the chops with garlic powder, onion salt and pepper -- then browned.  I then poured half a can of Campbell's 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup into the cooker, placed two boneless chops in the soup, then poured the remaining soup on top.  I covered crock and cooked on low for 2 hours!  The meat was SOO tender and delicious!  It was absolutely perfect and EASY!!  NOTE: it is always recommended that you fill your slow cooker at least half full... however, I cooked those two chops in my 5-quart cooker (which was no where near half) and it turned out great.  If you use more than two chops, simply extend your cooking time.  Whenever I try a new recipe like this, I like to make only 1 or two servings first to see if I like it so that I don't waste any food (by throwing it away if we hate it).

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!  However, I did make a few changes of my own and added a few more condiments to the original list of ingredients because in previous reviews, I read that the chops and the sauce turned out to be kind of bland.  So, what I did was: season my chops on both sides with seasoned salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, sage, and pepper and cooked in a little bit of olive oil (about 1TBS) for a few minutes just until the chops had turned nice and brown.  After that, I combined 2 cans of mushroom soup, a little bit of (about 1TSP) seasoned salt and garlic pepper, and a lilt bit of milk (about ¼ cup) in a pot and cook over a medium flame.  Then, I placed a little bit of olive oil in a skillet and sautéed my chopped onions (I did not have mushrooms on hand so I left them out) and once the onions were nice and tender, I poured them into the mushroom soup/sauce and cooked for a few more minutes.  Finally, I poured the mushroom sauce/soup on top of the chops, covered and cooked for an additional 15-20 minutes and then VOILA!!!  MY ENTIRE FAMILY LOVED THEIR DINNER!!!!  I hope yours do to.

Excellent.  This was a fabulous gravy!  I left out the mushrooms (but did use the COM soup) because I am not a big fan of mushrooms.  I used another reviewers suggestion of adding 1/2c of sherry.  I added 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke (hickory) which gave the gravy the flavor of being cooked on the grill instead of simmered on the stove.  Yum...this is definately on my keeper list.

Loved these.  I didn't alter the recipe other than lacking the fresh mushrooms, however, I believe the pork chops still turned out great.  They came out very tender and flavorful.  These were well received by the entire family; especially by me considering how easy they were to make!  Thanks for sharing, Melissa!

This was very simple and delicious over white rice. This was my first attempt at chops and would recommend it because it's so easy! I added a bit of milk to thin out the sauce a little, but it was still so simple.

Very good.  I used boneless thick-cut chops.  I had to add just a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan when I added the onion and mushrooms.  There was no fat in the pan after browning the chops.  That helped get the brown bits into the sauce anyway.   A yummy dish indeed served with rice.

What I did was follow the recipe all the way up to after browning the onions & mushrooms.  I then put the pork chops in a baking dish and I made about  3 cups rice and once that was done I then mix 4 cans of cream of mushroom soup together and put that on top of the pork chops and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 min.  I just made this tonight and my Husband; Parents & Grandpa really liked it and would like it again in the near future.

oh my gosh! this was SOOOOO good. My whole family loved it & the sauce over jasmine rice was YUMMY! I added some crushed garlic to the onion/mushroom saute. I also took some others advice & added a half can of milk to the soup. Next time I will make 2 cans of soup for some EXTRA sauce. The kids wanted 3rds,but we'd run out of sauce. A big thumbs up for this super easy & delicious meal. Thanks for sharing! This will defintely be made again.

This is a wonderful dish.  Although I have been making a different version for a few years now.  I put the raw porkchops, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, and chopped onion in a casserole dish.  Cover and bake on 350 for about an hour.  I think this comes out with more tender pork chops versus pan frying the porkchops first.  Then use your mushroom soup for gravy over mased potatos!!  W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L - yummy =)

Quick and satisfying.  Good way to use up mushrooms that I always seem to forget about...  Definitely a hit with my two small kids.  White rice is a nice accompaniament, as its great when it soaks up the gravy.

This is awesome! Even my 1 year old and 3 yr old ate this like it was going out of style! I too added one can of Golden mushroom soup and half a cup each of whole milk and a dry white wine.  I browned the chops with a tablespoon of minced garlic and then removed them and added the mushrooms and onion.  I poured my soup mixture in the pan and then transferred all to a dish and baked for an hour at 350. Served with egg noodles drenched in the gravy and some biscuits to soak up any gravt left over - oh so good!!!

All my family loved this one, even the kids! I, too, cut back on the onion and used two cans of soup for extra gravy. I also deglazed the pan after searing the chops with a little apple juice, white wine would work. That added some extra flavor and wonderful color.

This is a terrific recipe and the meat it cooked perfectly!  I made a slight change in which after I browned the the pork chops I removed them from the pan and sauteed the onions and 3 cloves of minced garlic for a minute, then I returned the chops to the pan, covering them with the onions and then the soup.  This recipe's a keeper!

Oh my goodness, these were so good! My kids are probably the pickiest ever, and they LOVED this! Everyone would give this a 10 out of 5!!! I did change it a little. I browned the chops in garlic like someone suggested, and didn't use salt. Didn't use mushrooms because of kids, and because I didn't have any. Then, I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom, 1 can of Cream of Celery, and 1/2 can of milk. Served with mashed potatoes!!!! YUMMY!

This is a great dish!  I made 2 changes.  I doubled the soup.  Because we love lots of gravy.  I also just browned the chops and cooked the onions and mushrooms partially, in a skillet.  I then tranferred them to the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes.  Serve with mashed potatos.  MMMM

We really enjoyed this recipe! I had just made pork chops the night before, so I used boneless chicken breasts instead...they were delicious! I just sprinkled them with our favorite seasoning salt (BAM!), and followed the directions for the pork. Definately a keeper!

We have made this recipe twice.  My husband loved it both times.  The second time we cooked the meat a little longer  and it turned out much more tender.  Definently a keeper in our recipe box.  Thanks!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I omitted the salt and used just a little garlic powder since the soup is already salty.  I served it over egg noodles and it was a huge hit. One of my favorite recipes.

This was a big hit. Made it for just me and my hubby so I used double thick chops. Followed recipe exactly as written with a minor change. Did not have garlic salt on hand so I used garlic powder. Did not have to cook longer due to thickness of meat. They came out perfectly cooked and moist. Hubby deemed it a gourmet meal!

Mushroom Pork Chops Haiku: "There was too much 'sauce', but I guess the sauce is soup. This needed more jazz." I didn't change anything about the recipe other than using those crazy-thick pork chops from Costco (3 of them), so my final simmering step was closer to 40 min. for them to reach the proper temperature. I suppose I should've made mashed potatoes or rice as a side dish b/c there was so much of the mushroom soup/onion/sauce leftover in the pan. Also, if I were to make this again, I would do more than just S&P, and a pinch of garlic salt ... I'd use minced garlic, paprika, thyme or marjoram; not sure. The chops were tender, but the taste was a little dull.

Have been making this for a long time, and it is very tasty. The only thing I add is a pinch of curry powder.  Gives a nice little kick to the sauce.

I've done this for years too.  My mother made it.  It is slightly different and is an oven dish.  Salt, pepper and garlic powder dust the chops, Dredge in flour, place in greased oven dish, Mix mushroom soup with a can of milk, add a can of sliced mushrooms, pour over...cover and bake.  We eat ours with mashed potatoes.  The soup, etc makes a gravy.  I'm going to try it this way.  The added onion sounds great!

This was very good.  Per previous comments I did 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup of milk and had a lot of extra gravy for only 2 people.   I wish I went by the recipe but if you have 3-4 people eating and serving it with noodles I would go with the extra gravy

Tried this recipe and followed everything accordingly. The pork chops was good but not phenomenal, it was missing some flavor which I couldn't tell. I think I will definitely give this recipe another try with other's suggestions.

I used this recipe last night for dinner and rather enjoyed it! I substituted the cream of mushroom soup with golden mushroom soup and really liked the flavor but the sauce came out a little more runny than I would have liked it.  Additionally, I used the same amount of salt that was shown in the video on both sides of the chops and it was way too much.  Recommend using about half that amount to reduce the saltiness.

This is a quick and easy, yet super yummy meal that my family loves. Like others, I brown my seasoned porkchops. Then I saute onions, garlic and mushrooms in the pan and de-glaze with the mushroom soup (2 cans + 1/2 cup of milk). Finally I return the chops to the pan and finish cooking them through. It turns out great every time. I've used the oven bake method as well, and they still come out as good. I don't know what it is about this recipe (made with canned soup no less!) that makes it so good, but it works. I usually serve it with steamed white rice :)

I have used this recipesfor a long time and its better in the crock pot. It's more tender. Just pour your ingredients in and let them cook for 4 to 6 hours or 8 hours and I always cook rice with this dish. Its amazing! It works well with chicken too.

Both my husband and I liked this recipe. It was easy to make and tasted great. I served it with rice and steamed broccoli. Only suggestion I would make is to use boneless pork chops.

These were delicious! I took out my pork chops and cooked the mushrooms, onions adnd garlic on their own for a few min before adding the chops back in. I also used a little white wine with the onions and mushrooms to scrape up the pork chop bits a little. YUMMY! And just as delicious as leftovers the next day.

I do not like mushrooms, so this was more for my boyfriend. He absolutely loved this and said he would order it at a restaurant! I baked the pork chops instead of placing them in the pan so that I could keep the sauce separate. I served them with a salad and garlic redskin mashed potatoes.

I deglazed with some white wine, sauted onion, mincerd garlic, and mushrooms. Did use 2 cans of soup and some sour cream. Put it all in 9 x 13 covered with foil baked @ 350 for about and hour. Served with rice. Had a 9 yr old grandson who informed me that he didn't like mushrooms or rice. Had him at least try a small bit. He had 2nds. This does make a lot. Tastes great and simple!!!

Ive made many mushroom pork chop recipes before, but this one looked appetizing.  That couldn't be farther from the truth.  It was bland and boring, even after I tried to add some spices to fix it.  There are much better recipes out there that won't destroy a perfectly good pork chop.

Great, easy recipe. I added 1/2 cup of white cooking wine to get the color from browning and and couple of capfuls of Dale's steak seasoning sauce. Dales is a soy sauce based marinade in the southeast.   Also, I added garlic salt and soul food seasoning.  Delish!  My granddaughter had 2nds and 3rds with stewed potatoes.

Good recipe! I changed it a bit for more my familys taste. I seasoned the pork chops with pepper, garlic salt, and cavenders seasoning. Put in a crock pot, then i mixed one can regular cream of mushroom soup and golden mushroom soup with milk.( just enough to get it smooth and easy to spread) add some fresh mushrooms and potatoes. Cover and forget about untill its done. Pork chops come out very tender.

Definitely a keeper in my house.  I can't stand onions, so I omitted them.  I also used 2 cans of mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms.  I ended up having way more sauce than the recipe needed, but that's ok.  This was served over a bed of wild rice at my house.  It would also be good with egg noodles or any other types of pasta, I think.

I finally was able to try this out last night and it was GREAT!! I sautéed my mushrooms in garlic butter and onion salt and left out the onions because we hate them. I seasoned my chops with my favorite seasoning called "Aw Sh*t".  That's seriously the name. It's so good. I bought it at my local  Purina general store. Then I added an additional can of cream of mushroom soup to make a thicker sauce. I served with a side of wild rice covered with the soup and mushrooms.

My family has been making this since I was a little girl and now I make it for my little girl.  Since I have a fussy daughter, I use seasoning salt on the pork chops, then fry them at a fairly high heat in the frying pan for about 3 minutes per side then turn down and cook for about five more minutes...the more stuff on the bottom of the pan, the better the flavour.  I then take out the porkchops add the mushroom soup and water and stir to get all the flavours off the bottom of the pan. I then put the pork chops in the soup, cover and let simmer for an hour or so.  About a half hour before supper I add egg noodles to the soup mixture(put the pork chops on top of noodles) and let them cook until they are ready, stirring occasionally.  Pork chops are nice and tender and egg noodles cooked in sauce have a wonderful taste.  This can also be made in the slow cooker.

This basic recipe is fine; however, following the advice of other reviewers, I made the following adjustments: combined 1 can cream of chicken soup with 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of white wine and poured this mixture over the browned pork chops that I had placed in a glass baking dish. Covered the dish with foil and baked at 350 for about 1 hour 15 minutes.

My family LOVED this -- we actually fought over the leftovers (only one pork chop) the next day!

This was good. I added a little sherry cooking wine  and about a half a cup of milk to the mushroom soup before I added it to the pan. I doubled the amount of mushrooms. I served it over spaetzle noodles and with fried cabbage. Great comfort food.

Very good recipe, I used one clove of garlic added with onion, and added lots of sage, which pairs with pork so well.

A little bland, but a great starting point. As a beginning cook, it was perfect for me to try the recipe as is - than grow as a cook and spice it up each time. Great recipe.

I altered this to take in other reviewer's suggestions. I sauteed onions, mushrooms and 2 gloves of garlic and then browned the pork. The I threw it all into a greased casserole dish and poured the cream of mushroom soup & some milk over top. Not super stellar flavor, but very good and easy. The chops came out very tender and the extra gravy was good over rice. This will be a keeper for the nights I am pinched on time.

This is a great base recipe! We loved it! I made some adjustments, based off other reviews. I sauteed mushrooms, onion, and garlic, then browned the chops. I deglazed the pan, then added the veggies, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, and some milk. Mixed it all togethre and added the chops back in and simmered for 30 minutes. Served over rice with a side of string beans. This is going into our regular rotation!

Pretty good with mashed potatoes!  Definitely use fresh garlic instead of garlic-salt though - makes a huge difference in flavour.  I have seared and baked this instead of finishing in a skillet, and it's great!  Very tender :)

This tasted so, so good. I used seasoned salt rather than salt, pepper and garlic salt. I think that made it a bit salty, so I'll use less next time. I removed the chops to make room for the mushrooms, onions, and per other reviews, garlic. I also deglazed with 1/2 cup of white wine. That made the dish. After I put the chops back in, I added another 1/3 or so as I thought the soup would be too thick. After it cooked for a while, it was then a bit too thin, but, in the end, it worked out as we loved the sauce and finished it off on our rice. I used everything to mop up the sauce - the chop, the rice, and the broccoli I served with it.

This one is definitely a keeper!  The only changes I made were to not use the salt & I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt with the pepper to season the pork chops.  I was skeptical as to how moist they would be, but they were so juicy.  I served these with brown rice and my husband & son both loved it. I figured I would have enough for leftovers to bring for lunch the next day & they ate all of it so there was nothing left!

I grew up on this recipe and still think it is the best way to make porkchops.  The updated versions are interesting---the addition of white wine and mushrooms sound very good.

I've made a version of this using my crockpot.  After I brown the chops, I put everything in the crockpot on low.  I add 1/2 pk of dry onion soup mix.  Chops come out so tender!  I like the suggestion of adding a little wine to the soup mix.  Thanks for sharing!

This is actually a recipe from Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup  except the recipe was called Glorified Pork Chops. I have made this many times,but always tweak the recipe myself and have added Italian Seasoning. A very good & easy recipe. Hubby loves it,and like another review it makes plenty of sauce which is fantastic over rice.

Nice easy recipe for when you don't want to cook.  Very creamy.  I thought there was quite a lot of sauce, but the gravy would be good with mashed potatoes or something else.

A great staple meal for us! A very easy and quick meal on busy nights. We scaled the recipe down for 2. Sauteed the mushrooms and onions with a little minced garlic poured it over the chops and placed in the oven. The flavor was wonderful and we had TONS of sauce even though we only used 1/2 the can of cream of mushroom soup!

The boyfriend inhaled this - I think I found a new quick and easy favorite. I cut two thick chops in half, seasoned & browned them, then dumped in what was probably way too much onion (1 large) and mushroom (8 oz), smooshed the soup in on top, covered and let simmer and it was done.  I didn't even bother sauteeing the veggies since there was no room in my cast iron skillet, and it still turned out perfectly. I served it on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes with green beans.

Pretty good as written, would be better with more sauce.  I had six chops, so I added milk to make the soup go further, but it still wasn't enough.  Next time I'll use two cans of soup and more milk.  Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli, made for a nice hearty meal.

This gets 5 stars from me since it's the only time I have ever cooked pork chops without drying them out. I used baby bella mushrooms and served the dish with roasted red potatoes and green beans. Next time I will serve it with rice since there is quite a bit of sauce left over.

DELICIOUS! I followed the advice of 'Jennifer' and added olive oil and garlic to the browning step. I also used the white wine and milk in the cream soup. I served this over a bed of brown rice with a side of steamed asparagus. My entire family (even my 8 and 6 year old daughters) LOVED it. I will absolutely add this recipe to my 'favorites' file! :)

This was a fast, easy, weeknight meal!  I added minced garlic but the flavor overall was a little bland.  I would make this again if everything was already in the pantry but otherwise I probably wouldn't make it again.

The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup so we'd have plenty of gravy. This recipe is very delish! We had it with Garlic Green Beans (recipe also on this site) and it all went together very well!

We really liked this recipe.  It was easy to prepare and was super yummy. I made this in my electric skillet.  The only changes I made was to add a fifth pork chop and an extra can of mushroom soup so we had plenty of gravy for mashed potatoes.

One dish wonder--preheated my stoneware baking dish in the oven.  When I added the not-quite-thawed chops, they quickly browned on one side.  Added garlic salt and pepper, flipped them over.  Tossed on the sliced mushrooms and onions and topped with the mushroom soup (added 1/4 c. sour cream for extra richness along with 2 minced garlic cloves) and baked til bubbly and tender. Yippee for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I baked it, as another user suggested and it was fabulous! I also added a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream for a richer flavor. I used light sour cream and the Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup.

I had yet to find a recipe for pork chops that I really liked. This one was great, as usual I read the reviews and made some of the changes others recommended. I browned chops quite a bit with pepper and garlic salt then removed them from pan. Then sauteed onions and clove of garlic in some white wine. Once onions were transparent I added back the chops, soup, can of mushrooms and thyme. Simmered 25 min. and was very tasty!!

4 at BEST.  I find this boring and something you do at the last moment, butwho has port in their freezer.   I would marinate and tenderize the pork.

This was a great recipe, but I did agree with other reviewer, ...after browning pork chops well in onion and garlic on stove, I baked them, covered in foil 45 minutes...mixed the can of cream of mushroom w/ 1 can of milk and poured that on top....also, instead of salt and pepper, I lightly sprinkled sides of chops before cooking with barbecue seasoning, and added a dash o soy sauce while browning...very good

I hate mushrooms, but this recipe was still awesome!  I omitted the mushrooms and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom...browned the chops in 1T butter and sprinkled them with Montreal Seasoning...then baked at 350 for one hour.  Wow--delicious!  I will be making this again and again--mushroom free, of course!

Cream of mushroom soup added nothing but calories to the pork chops, no flavor whatsoever. And OF COURSE it will turn out tender, you're smothering it in cream! I say throw out the soup, we barely managed to rescue the dish with honey dijon dressing and veggies. It presented badly, tasted bland. You could not tell that we cooked it in bacon fat and garlic either!

GUZA really called it. I mostly followed her suggestions, except instead of white wine I used half a bottle of beer, 2 cloves of garlic, a pinch of thyme and the soup. It turned out great even without the fresh mushrooms.

i just love this recipe. this is not the first time i have made this, but the first time i have written a review. i did change a few things...nothing major. i browned the pork chops then set them aside while i sauteed the mushrooms and onions. i added the soup and 3/4 can of half and half. i poured that over the chops and let that simmer for about 20 minutes. pulled the chops out and added a little corn starch to the soup mix to thicken it up a little. served with rice and green beans. very good and simple.

I adapted this recipe for a slow cooker.  I followed the directions for browning the chops and then I added it all to a slow cooker and cooked on low for 4-5 hrs.  It had a real nice taste and the chops were very moist and tender.

I followed some of the advice others gave.  Season the meat with salt, pepper, and a little dried thyme.  I browned the pork chops and baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes.  I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup mixed with half a cup of milk.  I de-glazed the pan with half a cup of white wine and poured that right over the pork chops after I had set them in the pan.  Then I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in butter with some garlic.  They turned out great and I will definitely make these again.

I did everything according to this recipe except I deglazed the pan with white wine after browning the chops and sauteeing the mushrooms and onions as another reviewer suggested. I will do that next time too, it was fabulous and made the house smell wonderful! Thanks for an awesome recipe that my hubby now requests frequently! I am definitely going to try the suggestion of baking these chops in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes covered with foil to see if they are even more tender and delicious this way!!

These are DELICIOUS!  I followed the advice of reviewers who suggested including white wine in the soup mix, and I seasoned the pork chops with garlic salt and oregano.  I doubled the soup, as some suggested, and ended up with a TON of sauce (as well as a mess on the stove from when it bubbled over a bit).  So next time, I probably will just use one can, but it did give me some ideas for playing with mushroom soup recipes!  Also, I used the Campbells Healthy Request soup for the low fat content, and the sauce was still very creamy and delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was awesome. My fiancee and I loved this dish, it was tender and the mushroom sauce along with plenty of sauteed mushrooms was fantastic. i served this with some green beans and some roasted red potatoes.  This is going to be a mainstay in my cooking rotation.

I've used a few pork chop recipes on here and this is my second favorite ("Baked Pork Chops I" being the fave).  This really is a great recipe and the preparation is quick too.  I followed the advice of others and baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour after browning them in the skillet.  The only things I added were garlic to the onion/mushroom saute mix and milk to the cream of mushroom gravy.  The chops turn out tender as a mug and the gravy is excellent for mashed potatoes!!  Will definitely make again, Bruh.

Very flavorful!  I added onion powder to the chops and after browning the chops, sauteing the veggies, and adding the cream of mushroom I put it in the oven to finish cooking at 300 for 30 minutes.  Very tender and yummy!

This is such an easy meal, and yummy! I like it because I can get it started, then set it low to simmer and get my kids bathed/cleaned up while it finishes cooking. My husband always has seconds. We try and serve it with a colorful veggie like peas or beans.

This was a very simple dish to make. Was a good simple dinner. I did listen to the others advise and added some wine and milk. 1/4 cup of each. Made the sauce creamer and a little tastier in my opinion. We will make this again when we need a quick meal.

This is a really good, easy, workday recipe.  I did brown some garlic in the pan before adding the chops- I was concerned that they might be a little bland.  And then I didn't add the garlic salt. I did everything else to the recipe and served it over rice.

These were OK.  The chops I used were too thick and therefore the overall taste was a little bland.

This was pretty good but think next time I will roast a whole garlic to use with this recipe and add another can of mushroom soup with a little sour cream mixed in, however, if I am short on time I will make as is again.

I thought it was good. Not amazing gourmet style stuff but just good, tasty, quick and easy weekday meal- this is not meant to be some fancy gourmet pork. I browned the pork first with garlic powder, salt, and pepper- i did use a lot of those 3 spices because i know cream of mushroom can be a bit bland as to suit many people. After browning I de-glazed the pan with some Merlot- thats what i had in the fridge- I used about 1/2 a cup. Then I tossed the onions into the dutch oven (i was using a dutch oven not skillet for this) So onions went in with the wine- i let them cook a bit to release some of the sugars in the onions and to remove the alcohol from the wine. When the onions where almost translucent i added a bit more wine- about 1/4 cup and let it cook a few more minutes- then threw in the mushrooms that i fried in another pan, let all that cook for a few min, added the soup, mixed it all up, threw in the pork, and cooked it for another 25 min- then just left the lid on. 

I think the big difference is using some wine to add flavor. You can use white or red. Most recipes on here require the addition of your own personal preference. This is a great standard everyday recipe to work off of. If something is to bland- which a lot of the 1-2 star reviewers noted than it is up  to the individual cook to spice things up. It is impossible to meet the needs of every palate with one recipe. I enjoyed this and think it is a great alternative to the basic pan fried chop or breaded chop

Good recipe. Minor error in that I forgot to buy cream of mushroom - had to use sour cream instead. Followed the recipe othwise. Would do this one again - with the soup. 2nd attempt - tried it in oven instead of skillet - big mistake. Dish was far too liquid - lacked flavour / tenderness that it had in the skillet.
3rd try - Based on another person's take on this dish, tried it their (the best) way. Little olive oil in the skillet. Sauteed 2 diced cloves of garlic. Put in butterflied chops - sauteed them both sides. Removed them from the skillet. Sauteed fresh sliced shrooms and chopped onion. Meanwhile, whisked 1/2 cup dry white wine with 1/2 cup milk - added that to cream of mushroom soup. Added tsp dried tarragon & pepper. 
Added chops to shrooms, onions, poured sauce over all - put on low and simmered for 30 min.

These were delicious!  I baked them in the oven as suggested by other reviewers, but I'm sure they would have been good in the skillet too.  They were extremely tender.

This was a pretty basic dish, but turned out pretty good. I added some white wine and milk to the soup, but I think that was a mistake. I became to runny and then I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. If I make this again, I'll stick to the recipe.

YUM!!! I made these exactly as recipe says with the addition of 1/2 cup light sour cream in the soup mix as well as milk, and used boneless pork chops. They were the best, most tender pork chops I think I have ever had in my life! :) So easy, too! Thanks!

These are the best!!!! I browned the onions/mushrooms in a bit of oil and added 1/2 can of milk, used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, and browned the chops using pepper and Adobo instead of garlic salt. I then put all of it into a pan, covered it with foil and baked it at 350 for an hour... FALL APART TENDER!!! The gravy is WONDERFUL over homemade mashed potatoes (which I season with Montreal steak seasoning and butter).  Family wants this meal OFTEN!!!!

Love this recipe! I've made it twice. Seasoning is the key.  I seared the chops then removed from pan. Then added fresh mushrooms, garlic powder and a little soy sauce to saute. Added chops back in and added a large can of cream of mushroom soup, dry minced onion and more garlic powder. Simmer. Great with homemade mashed potatoes. My 4 year old ate it up. Thanks!

This recipe was a huge disapointment. I did follow all the suggestions, fresh garlic, white wine & even a dash of worchester sauce. Its a good thing I did - I found the chops were tender but the sauce was way too soupy & bland. It shocks me there are so many 5 star reviews for this recipe. I will not make it again.

I have to say that this is one of my favourite recipes!  I have been making it for years & never get tired of it.  I do however use more garlic.  Also, sometimes I'll throw in a shake of chili powder or cayenne to kick it up a bit.  A major comfort food, especially with rice.  MMMMM

Not bad. I guess if I had seasoned the chops more it would be more flavorful. It just tasted kind of bland. I may try again and add extra seasonings.

Very good, thanks!  I served it over whole wheat pasta.  The only change I would suggest is dipping the chops in egg whites before coating with bread crumb mixture, I couldn't get it to stick and felt like I wasted alot.

Yummy!  This was so easy and it was very good.  This was much quicker than Baked Pork Chops I that is on this site.  Less steps and the results are great.  I added some light sour cream to the sauce at the end and served it over spinach...great lo carb alternative.  WHite rice would have been excellent!

This was good.  I would have given it five stars if the chops were more tender.  Maybe they simmered for too long?  The taste was outstanding though. I added 1/4 cup of white wine as others suggested, another half of a can of mushroom soup, and of course, some fresh garlic.  I served them with roasted potatoes and green beans.  Very nice meal.  Will keep it around for future use.

To make this a truly remarkable dish add: 4-6 slices of bacon, 1tsp minced garlic, 1/2tsp. ground coriander, 1/4 Cup white wine or vermouth, add 1 extra onion and 2 tsp. onion soup mix.
Crisp up diced bacon and set aside. Brown onions, mushrooms and garlic in fat.,set aside.  Leave 1 tsp. of fat in pan and brown chops 2 min. each side.  Add rest of ingredients, cover and bake in 325F oven 15-20 minutes.  Can be prepared to the bake stage and refrigerated for the next day.  Just add 10 min. to cooking time, Great for company!

This was a great way to liven up pork chops! My boyfriend doesn't like mushroom soup, but even he really enjoyed this dish.  The chops came out tender and yummy, with very little effort needed.  This was a pleasant, low maitenance meal that  will soon be a staple in my meal plans!

I followed the suggestions to double the gravy but ended up with too much.  The gravy was very good but my pork chops were kind of bland.  I also deglazed the pan with white wine as others have recommended.  I will definitely make this again but I'll probably marinate the chops first.

This was good and easy.  I made a few adjustments.  First, I used a spoonful of minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also didn't use the extra mushrooms aside from soup.  I added a little milk, because the sauce was cooking down too fast.  In the last few minutes I added a handful of french fried onions.  (I used a little less fresh onnion.)

Simple, elegant and delicious! I altered this recipe the second time I made it by adding a cup of white wine to the mushrooms and onions after sauteeing them, reducing until almost evaporated, then adding the soup. Served with rice the first time, mashed potatoes the second, and tonight am serving this dish with pasta.

This recipe is delicious.  Only substitution I made was I used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup because that's all I had.  Before serving, I sliced each porkchop into 1/4" slices, fanned it out on the plate, and poured the delicious sauce/gravy over it.  It looked great and tasted even better!

I am so sorry to be in the minority. How disappointing!  I was looking for a comfort food recipe and thought that surely I'd found it.  We all agreed the name brand mushroom soup gave the gravy an unpleasant, artificial and chalky, taste.

FLAVOR- for those who want flavor the way I do it is... Take the soup, a little milk to thin it out in a pot and warm it up, flavor with garlic, pepper and season salt and maybe a little italian seasoning to taste. In a pan, brown your pork chops with season salt, garlic and pepper (staple seasonings in my home and works for chicken too).  We like ours medium rare so I do it on med-high heat when I brown them and then add the onions and mushrooms.  Then place the porkchops on plates, top with the gravy and then top with the sauteed onions and mushrooms!  FABULOUS!  :-) I grew up on this receipe and so did my mom and her mother before her. Hope you like the flavor version!

i found this recipe works better if you cook in the oven @ 350 for 30 minutes. I also brown the pork chops for 2-3 minutes. they did not turn out quite as tender when cooked on the stove

I seared my chops in the skillet with some chopped onion and then tossed them into the slow cooker using "healty" cream of mushroom soup and a packet of dried garlic and herb soup mix. Minutes before serving I added about a quarter cup of lite sour cream. A comforting dish on top of egg noodles that took the chill out of an icey March night. Thanks Melissa!

This is sooo easy and very good! My fiance loves mashed potatoes with it. I only make 2 1/2" boneless chops and have a little sauce left over. I would definitly use more soup for more chops. I also tried substiting the low fat soup and there is no difference in the taste.

This recipe was easy and turned out very good. I served it over roasted potatoes, added rosemary and worchestershire to the mushroom gravy. The pork turned out very tender and tasty.

I have made this before, and made it again tonight.  It is great as is, but my husband suggested dipping the chops in flour before putting them in the pan, to create an actual gravy.  Thanks Melissa!

This is a good recipe. I added a little rosemary and sage to the soup and simmered the chops. Very tasty!

Simple one dish to clean main dish. My family loved this. I browned the chops in olive oil after seasoning with pepper and garlic season salt.I cooked the onions a little then  I used about a 1/4 cup of water to deglaze the pan. I didn't have any mushrooms and they were not missed. I used the low sodium muschroom soup so it was not too salty. Great Dish.

I know I have a dissenting opinion here, but we truly didn't like this one.  The chops and the sauce were both pretty bland.  The sauce seems like it would go better with chicken.

Excellent recipe!!  Quick, easy and delicious!  Even my picky husband and 8 year old LOVED it!  Added 1/2 can of milk and served with garlic mashed potatos.  The sauce that this makes is wonderful over the garlic potatos!  Will definately be making again, alot!

My 14 year old son, who loves to cook, made this recipe and it came out great!  An easy recipe and probably the best pork chop dish I've ever had!  The chops were very moist.   Delicious!  (Especially if you love mushrooms!)

Wow! This recipe was extremely easy, but Oh, so delicious! My only variations: I used pork loin boneless top chops, added about a 1/4 c. of water to the Cream of Mushroom soup, served it over mashed potatoes instead of brown rice, and used maybe a little less onion. Terrific dinner; your family will be licking their plates!

This was so easy and very good.  My husband said it was the best meal I had cooked in awhile (wasn't sure how to take that!) I made a side of mashed potatoes and we used the sauce as a gravy.  Delicious!!

Before making this, I read some of the critical, but helpful reviews. I took note that a few reviews described the dish as bland or no taste.  What I did, which seemed to help a lot, was marinate the porkchops in vegetable oil, fresh rosemary (dried will do nicely), salt, pepper and garlic powder.  After that, I followed the recipe's directions.  In the end, I added Dijon mustard to the mushroom gravy, stirred it in quite well and let it sit for the last five minutes.  The flavors were really outstanding. It's still a very easy recipe.

I added extra mushroom soup because I had 6 pork chops instead of 4. I didn't totally follow the instructions the way I was supposed to, so don't judge. :)

Very good.  I lightly sprinkled seasoning salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme on both sides of the chops prior to browning. Sprayed skilled with Pam for both chops and onions. Removed chops prior to cooking onions/mushrooms.  Skipped the garlic salt and added a clove of minced garlic after browning the onions/mushrooms and cooked 1 minute.  Removed from pan.  Deglazed pan with 1/4 c. red wine, added 2 shakes of Worcester sauce, soup and 3/4 c. of milk.  Wanted plenty of sauce for noodles.  The wine curdled the milk, so next time I'll use broth instead.  Returned everything to pan and cooked for 30 minutes.  While the addition of the wine tasted good, did not care for what it did to the appearance of the dish.  Delicious, anyway!  Will make again.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!! I did it a little bit different. Instead of sautéing the mushrooms and onions with the pork chops I sautéed them in butter in a separate pan then added them to the browned pork chops. My husband loved it!!!!

Read lots of reviews, made a few minor changes but basically followed the recipe - this dish smelled amazing cooking in the kitchen but the flavor was lacking.  I did brown the chops on the stove, then sautéed garlic, onion and mushrooms, added soup, some milk and red wine, added a little rosemary and thyme, poured over chops and baked for an hour covered in foil.  Sauce was a little on the thin side.  Served over egg noodles and with broccoli.  Not my favorite way to make chops.

I made it according to the recipe and it was really good. I also made it  as some have suggested using milk and white wine to the sauce. Yuck. That was terrible. I had to add cream to it after it was done to make it taste good. This recipe needs no changes made to it-it is great as it is.

I made this as Jennifer suggested, with white wine and tarragon. And we love sauce so I make extra, using one can of golden mushroom and another of 'regular' mushroom soup. Sauce was fantastic! I have some left over so think I'll brown a couple more chops tonite. This would also be great with pork loin medallions.

I did make one mistake though.  I moved the chops off the burner when they were at 140 degrees and let them sit for a while in the sauce. Next time, if we're not quite ready to sit down to eat, I'll rove then at @ 125 degrees, as they do continue to cook.

I'm a directions kind-of-girl.  I don't substitute and I can't easily figure out how to change a recipe.  This was bland for my family.  I so wanted to like it but it was lacking something.  I wish I knew what it was.  I followed the recipe exactly (including watching the video).More salt?  I don't know.  Until then, this is a no-go for us.

This was fantastic! I seasoned & browned the chops, then added sliced onions & mushrooms until softened. Then I placed everything in a glass baking dish & added canned cream of mushroom with half a can of milk (mixed together). 
Cover with foil & bake at 350 for 1 hour. Soooooo good. Try it, you won't regret it.

.  I browned the meat and sautéed  the mushrooms and onion the put it in a slow cooker and cooked it 4 or 5 hrs.  I also added some water so the gravy wouldn't be so thick.  Served with cinnamon apples, green beans, baked potato, and rolls.  It was delicious!

I followed another reviewers suggestions and browned it and then put it in a pan with potatoes and the other ingredients and baked it at 350 for an hour (cover with foil). Turned out great and really easy.

I thought these were great! The onion really kicks up the flavor. I sautéed the onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic in butter first (I didn't have fresh mushrooms). Set that aside. Then turned the heat up and browned the seasoned chops. Put the chops in a baking dish. Put the onion, garlic, can of cream of mushroom, and 1/2 cup of milk in the pan to infuse their flavors for a few minutes. Then poured all of it over the chops, covered and baked at 350 for an hour.  Didn't need white wine, there was tons of flavor! Delicious!

We absolutely loved it however I doubled the sauce. With 4 pork chops I did 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 and a half yellow onion, and a pound of mushrooms. Then I served it over rice.

My family thought it was great!  I followed the recipe exactly with on exception.  I took the pork chops out of the pan once brown and added a little olive oil to sauté the onions and mushrooms.  Then I returned the pork chops to the pan.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Great dish! Yes I made changes as one of the guests JUSTJEN33 did. I made it just like she said and it turned out great????. I did not use the skillet I  seasoned the pork chops, placed them in a pan, cut up some onions, mushrooms. Poured cream of chicken, cream of mushroom and poured a little milk as the guest stated. Placed oven on 350, the only thing for me is it needed more than an hour to cook. Overall I cooked it for 2hours with foil and another 15min without foil to get that tenderness I was looking for.

This is a perfect base recipe. You can do a lot by adding to the recipe, but with what is there, it still would probably taste good. Anyway be creative with your additions to this recipe and I'm sure you will like the outcomes

This recipe is a great start, but needs improvement! What I did different: I sauteed the mushrooms, onions, and added minced garlic in a separate pan, and in a skillet I browned the pork chops: to the chops I added cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and onion flakes. After I sauteed the veggies, I added them to the pork chops, then added the cream of mushroom soup: I then added a touch of milk to make it more creamy instead of keeping it bland. It turned out amazing, and everyone loved it!

Great recipe as written.  Husband and I  loved it, gravy was to die for.  Made double recipe for gravy yesterday so today I made hamburger patties and simmered them in the leftover gravy.  Delicious!! Husband said it was the best gravy ever.  Served it over mashed potatoes with a side of baby peas.  Very hearty and definitely a comfort meal.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe! My family enjoyed it but I did add some changes. I browned the pork chops a little longer so I don't have to bake it long. For the sauce I sauted mushrooms, onions and green onions in butter til it got golden brown. I add that to my sauce and then add salt and pepper before smothering it on the pork chops. Delicious!!!!

My whole family and I loved this! I decided to go with other reviews to add somethings, but since my family is bigger, I have to use more chops, so I doubled the soups to 4 cans, added a whole cup of milk, and half a cup of white cooking wine. I browned the chops in olive oil with two minced garlic cloves, added garlic powder and seasoned salt to the chops, then put them in the pan with the soup mixture on top. I also added carrots to the pan and baked for one hour on 350, but they still weren't done so I put them in for another 30 min on 375. Gravy was amazing and there was barely any leftovers. Will make again!

This is great! I used 6 very thin chops without the bone, so I didn't have enough room in the frying pan and therefore stir fried the veggies, removed them, then browned the chops. It's very tasty! I only had to simmer the whole thing for about 10 minutes because of the thinness of the chops. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe! these were some of the best pan cooked pork chops we have eaten.  Recipe was simple and easy to make.
I will definitely be making these pork chops again.  They went great with my home made mash potatoes and salad.  They would also be great with rice.  Thank you mmcgee!!

Excellent, though I made changes based on ingredients I had, and didn't have.  Used leftover white country gravy in place of mushroom soup, and a can of shitake mushrooms instead of fresh.  Browned the chops, added the onions and sauted, added the gravy/mushroom mix, then baked in a foil-covered pan, at 350 for about 35 minutes in my toaster oven.  I know some object to reviews with so many changes, but I wanted to let people know this still turned out tender and yummy.

I made this tonight and it was easy, but pork chops were dry.  I baked after browning, but the chops were only about 1/2 inch thick so they probably didn't need an hour.  I served over rice and the gravy was very nice.  I'll make again but with thicker chops or for less baking time.

I made this recipe with cube steaks because one of my guests did not eat pork. Browned the cube steaks in olive oil.  Deglazed the pan with sherry as I did not have any white wine. Browned onions and mushrooms as in recipe. Used golden mushroom soup and half can of milk as the base for the sauce.  Added a little crushed garlic and thyme for added flavor. Transferred to a greased baking dish.  Baked in the oven in a foil covered dish for 1 hour.  Served with mashed potatoes. Melt in your mouth tender.  Wonderful.

I have made this recipe for years either on top of the stove or in the oven, In the oven makes it really simple but I always added 1/2 an envelope of dried onion soup mix which always gave it that little extra something. As it cooks you might have to add a 1/2 can of water. I used to let it cook longer also, then it ends up fork tender. A great recipe for kids who are learning to cook.

I have made this recipe for years (found it in Mr. Food's magazine) and as written, four stars. But make these changes and it goes up to five stars -- instead of garlic salt, use garlic powder. Far less sodium and better taste. Second, mix in 1/2 cup of milk with the soup for a creamier and better tasting sauce. Oh, and just personal preference, but I use Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup and I always use two cans and 3/4 cup milk because we love lots of sauce on our rice (I always serve this with rice) and on our chops. :) This is one of my families favorite meals!

I have made something similar to this for many years - I use chopped up garlic as well as a little lemon juice.  A favorite of my family.

I make this often with a few changes...I love using pork loin instead of chops, slice it and season with garlic salt and pepper..sautee in 1 tbs olive oil..and add wine to the sauce white or red whatever is available.

This recipe will perk up with a couple of cloves of garlic sautéed with the onion, and a teaspoon of low sodium soy to individual taste.

I make this all the time. My mom used to make it when I was a kid. I also add soya sauce and a dash of Worcestershire. If you do not want to fry the chops, put them is a dish and cover them with the mixer. Bake covered at 350 for about a half hour.

Four stars as written, was good, next time I will tweak it a little and I'm sure it will be a 5.  I think it needed more seasonings.

I just tried this and it was pretty good. I loved how easy and relatively healthy it was! However, mine turned out pretty bland. Maybe I didn't use enough salt, pepper and garlic salt , but next time I'll add fresh garlic or something to give it more flavor.

This was amazing.  I only had 2 pork chops but they were thick so I opted to keep the rest of the recipe the same. I did simmer for 30, and I flipped the chops and recovered them with mushroom mixture after 15mins. Went great with my spinach and garlic cilantro rice. I used some of the sauce over the rice also. YUMMY

Oh dear, we so wanted to like this recipe!   The pork was very dry, and had very little flavor despite using minced garlic (instead of garlic salt).  Not the recipe for us.

Good base. I did think my pork chops got a little dry and chewy. I would have preferred to baked this instead of on the stovetop so the pork chop would be more tender.

Very easy recipe. Under $20 dollars and fed 2 plus lunch the next day. I substituted Virgin Olive oil for the vegetable oil and added in a minced garlic clove to the oil before the pork chops. I added a garden salad and small garlic bread sticks to the meal. Still all said under 20 bucks! Kids loved it!

I believe this recipe is a wonderful base ! My twist included fresh garlic, added fresh white mushroom (added 6 min. before rest), a touch of new Mexican red chile, and then poured over a wild rice medley. In August, I thought I'd see if others liked as much as me. Not only was the oversized dish empty, I was told I was in the wrong business ! Yay !

I made it following the original recipe exactly. The gravy seemed a little too thick so I added some milk (I'd deduct 1/2 star for the required adjustment). The end result was fabulous and a hit with the family (including my 3-year-old). I served with barley. Definitively adding this to our rotation especially considering how easy and quick it is to make.

This had a really good flavor, It was just a little bland. I used portabella mushrooms and it still could use a little something. The chops were very tender and moist. I will make this again, but will probably try adding a little worcestershire sauce and maybe some minced garlic or the golden mushroom soup that was suggested by some reviewers. It was also very quick and easy!

Made this recipe a million times. I always use 1/2 can or so of milk, a lot of fresh chopped garlic and stir in a few dashes of soy sauce. Gives the gravy a great flavor for over mashed or fried taters.

Kind of bland for my taste, but it was a simple way too use up our mushrooms & take advantage of the sale on pork chops. The kids liked it. We'll definitely stick this away for a future meal.

I usually put about 2 cups of instant rice in the bottom of a 9 x 13 dish.  I brown the chops (or chicken)and put them on top of the rice. I put the mushroom soup on top of it and add about 1/2 can of milk or water.
Cook in the oven for about an hour.  Make a vegetable or salad and dinner is ready.  A great recipe to change to suit yourself.

Not bad, but think the chops need more seasoning. It was a little bland, but was moist and tender.

This recipe was tasty and very easy. I made the following modifications: sprinkled the chops with flour, onion soup mix and garlic powder. After cooking the chops I removed them from the pan and used some wine to deglaze the pan and then followed the recipe as written.

I thought this recipe was great! I only gave it a 4 star because I used the suggestions in the comments to modify it. It turned out wonderfully! We had extra sauce and it was amazing as a gravy on the mashed potatoes I served with it.

I gave this rescipe 4/5 stars because it needed to be adjusted. I followed other's suggestions using additional spices to suit your needs and de-glazing the pan with some white wine for added flavers. After the adjustmants, it was a 5 for sure. Will make it for the family again.

This is a very easy and delicious dish! I've already made it twice now, and we love it every time. The only thing I did differently was to use canned mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms. But it still turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Vey easy and adaptable recipe.  I made it following the recipe the first time but the second time I added milk and white wine as mentioned in many other reviews.  My family liked it better the original way.

I made this very close to the original recipe, but made a few changes based on reviews and personal preference.  I seasoned the chops with seasoning salt and garlic powder and browned them in a tiny bit of butter flavored crisco, removing to a piece of foil and pouring any juice over them.  Wrap up sides of foil to keep warm.  Used canned mushrooms and used a spoonful or two of the juice in the can to deglaze the pan.  Ommitted the onion for personal preference.  Cooked drained mushrooms 1 minute and reduced heat to medium low.  Added in a can of Cream of Mushroom and a can of Golden Mushroom Soup.  Mixed all well and added pork chops back to pan.  Made sure they were covered with sauce, covered pan, and let simmer.  Fipped chops every 10 minutes.  Were done at 20 minutes, but got more tender the longer they simmered.  I served over rice.  The "gravy" was wonderful.  Next time I may try it in the crockpot.

So incredibly yummy!  I followed advice from other reviewers and de-glazed the pan with white wine.  After adding everything back to the pan and adding the soup I also added a few dashes of worcerstershire for a little kick.  Everyone loved it!

Simply put - delicious!!  Very simple and quick to prepare.  My husband and 3 children loved this and asked me to make it again.  No changes needed.  I used 5 chops and wish I used 10 because they couldn't get enough of it! Thank you!!

I love this recipe and it's hard to mess up.  I've been making this for a dozen years but slightly different.  Easy to modify - I sear my chops both sides first and then assemble in glass oven dish to bake.  But I always add apple slices to the assembly process.  I bake it all over top a bed of uncooked minute rice and as long as there's enough liquid and sauce everything bakes and combines very well. Yumm.

These were just OK.  I followed another users suggestion of adding 1/2 can milk and browned meat and sauteed onions/garlic/etc. but the end result was just adequate.  Hubby and I had to keep adding salt and pepper as we ate.  Overall, not bad but not great either.

My husband really loved this and he is very particular about what he eats! I deglazed the skillet with a half cup of chicken & vegetable stock. After pan searing, I put the pork chops in the oven at 350 for thirty minutes. The pork chops fell off the bone. He made himself an extra plate.

trolling the meat department for "mystery meat" (what I call marked down-dinner tonight meat", I happened upon pork chops that had been on sale for 1/2 price, then marked down again. OK-fresh mushrooms were not on sale, so I used canned-- quick, convenient and always better when cost effective. Thanks for posting this oldie, but goodie....

I've not made this yet, but it sounds great.  I would prepare as directed, except once it was done, I'd mix the sauce into rice or noodles and serve the pork chops on top or on the side.  Any green vegetable and apple sauce would compliment this dish nicely.

I also made a bit of an adjustment.  I browned the pork chops then mixed one can of rice with the mushroom soup and poured it over the top.  Baked in the oven the top turns a nice golden brown and is delicious.

I make this all off the time using fast fry boneless pork chops which I cut into strips and cook lightly. Then, I remove the pork chops from the pan and saute the onion and mushroom. Then I add back the pork chops, and the mushroom soup, with some milk and soy sauce (don't add addditional salt). The soy sauce makes it a nice brown gravy that is perfect for your rice!!

This recipe was good, but just short of five stars to me. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 can of milk (skim) for every can of soup. I used 10 pork chops and 3 cans of soup (increasing the other ingredients accordingly). I did the oven method in a 9x13 inch pan. Didn't brown the chops or sautee the mushrooms in a pan first, both of which I will do next time. Put all of the ingredients in the pan, covered with aluminum foil and baked at 350F for about an hour and 15 minutes. The taste was very good, but just not overwhelming. I will definately make this again, though, as the family did very much enjoy it, but just probably not for company.

Unfortunately, I don't agree with most of the rave reviews here. It might be that my tastes have changed since childhood (when this kind of recipe was a staple in  my mother's cooking) but even with a very high quality cut of pork, I found this recipe rather bland and uninteresting.   There are countless pork recipes here that surpass this recipe not only in taste, but in health as well. It just is not good enough to warrant the incredibly high calories resulting from using the cream of mushroom soup. I'll enjoy these calories much more, elsewhere!

I didn't use onions and mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I deglazed with white wine and added milk to the cream of mushroom mixture.  Not very sophisticated looking or tasting but pretty tasty.  Best thing is the toddlers gobbled it up.

This was very good.  I added a whole pound of mushrooms because I love them.  The sauce was creamy and tasty.   The pork was very tender.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this tonight for dinner, and served it with white rice.  I followed the recipe exactly, but pieces of the veggies started sticking too much to the pan, even though I used a nonstick pan and olive oil.  To fix this, I added white wine and stirred to loosen those stuck pieces. I also decided the cream of mushroom soup needed to be thinned a little more, so I added about 1/2 cup of 1% milk.  At that point, I felt like I could let it simmer safely.  This simmered (on low heat) for 30 minutes.  They came out perfectly cooked all the way through, and definitely tender and moist.  I'm sure baking it for a longer period of time would turn out an even more tender pork chop, but I was happy with how tender it was just from cooking on the stove for a shorter period of time.  Thanks for the recipe.  I really appreciate the use of fresh mushrooms and onions!

This is comfort food at its best.  I made exactly as written using fat free cream of mushroom soup mixed with a bit of skim milk.  It was delicious.  I sliced my onions instead of chopping as that works better for me.  I will make this again and again.  Had to use golden mushroom this time and it was even better.  Sprinkled on some seasoned salt and spicy pepper blend before browning in a bit of olive oil.  Thinned the soup with some water and then made as directed.  Yum.

I added 1.5-2 TB of white wine vinegar, 2/3 C milk and generously seasoned the chops prior to browning in bacon fat with minced garlic. The vinegar made all the difference between bland and good.

Easy to prepare. I like that this recipe used ingredients that I had on hand. Instead of fresh mushrooms, I used canned. I found this recipe delicious with a side salad and rice.

This was good except for the onions. They gave it such an overwhelming onion flavor. Just double the mushrooms instead

Pros: It's filling. It Makes enough sauce (with rice) to feed a family.  Cons: Chops were cooked on 2 yet tasted  like they had the flavour boiled out of them. Flavourless, watery sauce.

I must be missing something - I thought this recipe was rather bland.  I did use a "healthy" version of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup - maybe that killed the recipe.  So for anyone else out there who likes to make things healthier, maybe skip it with this recipe!  I did think it was easy, and it has potential...we have leftovers tonight and I'll try to jazz it up with some spices and salt.

My husband and kids really enjoyed this dish. As suggested by other reviewers I browned the butterfly (no bones) pork chops first and set aside, then de-glazed with some white wine, added fresh garlic, onion, mushrooms and soup. Trafsferred everhything to a crok pot, added 2 cubed potatoes and cooked for 3-4 hours. Very easy, I will definitely make this again.

For some reason mine looked NOTHING like the picture but it still tasted amazing. If your household loves mushrooms and onions I would suggest adding a little more to the recipe. I am not the best cook and seem to always burn the sauce a little. Even having done so, everyone raves. I guess it just adds a little more flavor ;)

Great recipe. Quick and easy prep.  I made the following changes.  I browned the chops in olive oil 4 min per side.  After adding soup chops mush/onion/garlic to baking dish I topped  with fresh oregano and basil.  Then for a crisp crust covered with Italian flavor panko, crispy fried onions, and shredded Italian cheese blend.  I baked at 359 for 45 minutes.  Was fabulous Golden brown crust!

I love this recipe.  I added some wine and milk to the soup.  Also I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of onion soup and reduced my chopped onion to only half an onion which worked fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to everyone else who commented and made suggestions!  They were great!

This dish was very delicious.  Don't over-due it with the salt, which is what I did.  The onions and cream of mushroom soup give it lots of flavor.  I will definitely add this to my favorites list.

Fantastic!  Hubby said one of my best meals.  For those that fear they will be low on gravy - just add some milk while cooking (this will also help thin out any that has 'clumped').

This was a great idea that I revamped a bit.  Instead of using cream of mushroom soup, I simply took half of the mushrooms 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and about 3 tablespoons of water salt and pepper and simmered for a bit until the mushrooms broke down.  Then I placed the seared pork chops, and remaining mushrooms in  the pan, covered and let cook for about 20 minutes on med-low heat.

I'm rating this recipe as five stars, but I did make some changes according to previous posters advice.  I used about 5 pieces of sliced pork loin and froze the rest.  First I browned them in a little olive oil, then added a bit of white wine to the the pan after removing the pork chops.  I sauteed the mushrooms first, then added chopped onions and cooked them until tender.  Once the wine had cooked down a bit, I added a little more, a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of cream of celery soup, about 1/2 cup of fat free Half and Half, a little salt and pepper, and about 1 tsp of thyme.  They simmered for about one hour and came out delicious.  I served them with green beans and brown rice.  Very good!

Wonderful AND simple, exactly as written.  Served with the sauce poured over the chops and white rice.  Even better leftover!

Great tasting, very easy.  One warning- I think you will need to simmer much longer than advertised.  My pork chops weren't that thick but it took over an hour before they were tender enough for our tastes.  They will be "cooked through" rather quickly, but not tender.

This is the only way my kids enjoyed and at pork chops!  I took advice from previous reviews and really seasoned the pork, then took the chops out after they browned deglazed with a little white wine and then sauteed the mushrooms and onions with garlic.  I then used 2 cans of reduced fat soup, wine, milk and seasoned that with a bit more salt, pepper and garlic powder and it can out terrific.  I was afraid the pork would be over cooked but the long simmering is what made it so tender.  I will absolutely make it again.

Great recipe as is! The only thing I did different was to add two cans of cream of mushroom soup, but it was not necessary. I just wanted more sauce for the plain rice I served with it.

Family loves it - I've made this dish a couple times already.  The first time I cooked as instructed and turned out well.  The 2nd time I added one can of milk for every can of mushroom soup and turned out delicious!  "Saucier" and a little less salty.

Thia was a very good recipe and very easy.I added 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup milk like others suggested to the cream of mushroom mix before adding it to the skillet. It turned out wonderfully, I served with wild rice witch went wonderfully with the sauce.

Super easy and super good.  Pork Chops are really tender and the gravy is so good on Mashed Potatoes.  Veggie side of Green Beans with bits of bacon is great.

This is a great recipe!  I have been making something similar for years.  Try adding rice (and a little water) to the mix and put the pork chops and rice in the oven for approximately 30 minutes.  My family loves this dish.

Not that this recipe needs another review but I have been making pork chops this way for years myself; a family favorite comfort food they now make for their family.  I have also used condensed tomato soup as an alternative from time to time but the condensed mushroom soup will always take top billing.  If you have not prepared pork chops in this way I highly recommend you try them.  ENJOY!

This recipe is great.  My boyfriend and I eat a variation of this almost every week.  We like to add a lot more mushrooms than this recipe calls for.  We also like to substitute the pork for chicken or lamb/veal pelmeni (Russian ravioli).

Great basic recipe, used something very close to it for years. Used Hedder & Jennifer's suggestions, mainly wine & tarragon. I let my costco porkchops simmer in the gravy/sauce for an hour or more so the meat falls off the bone. Spoon over mashed potato's.

Took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup milk & 1/2 cup white wine, onions & garlic.  Followed cooking directions, but chops weren't delicious or tender, and extra liquid made the gravy too watery.  Disappointed.

Just okay, nothing fabulous about it. Was pretty bland even after taking advice of other reviews and adding wine. Seemed a little tough too. I might make this again but it's not on my list of favorites.

This really was good. I did make a few changes as some of the other reviews suggested - I added a half can of white wine and a half can milk to the soup mixture, sauted some garlic with the mushrooms, and added some corn starch after the chops were done simmering to thicken the sauce. I also omitted the salt since I was already adding garlic salt and I know the soup has quite a bit of sodium. All-in-all this is a great recipe and a keeper.  Thanks

Best pork chops we have ever had!  I realized at the last minute we didn't have fresh mushrooms, but the recipe was still excellent without them.  If you are using boneless pork chops, you may want to check them at about 15 minutes.  We let ours go 20 as suggested and they were slightly overdone.

Great recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  First let me say that I used half shitaki  mushrooms and half regular mushrooms.  I also added two cloves of minced garlic.  It was FANTASTIC!  I loved it.

This recipe was very good and super easy! We have made this 2 times, once with bone-in pork chops and once with butterfly chops. Both turned out super moist and delicious, but I would recommend butterflies. :)

This was pretty good.  I've had better pork chops before and frankly, I was expecting more from this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly but the chops were a little tough.  I'll probably try it again but not before trying other recipes first.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  The pork chops were moist and flavorful and the gravy just put it over the top.  I saved the leftover gravy from last night to eat with tonight's chicken-- it's that good!  Thanks for a new instant favorite the the whole family loves!!!

This recipe is great for even the cheapest cut of pork chop, even the shoulder steaks.  Makes the chops so tender and juicy.  I use seasoned bread crumbs pulverized in a food processer as the coating.

TENDER AND FLAVORFUL! I took a few reviewers' advice and added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup wine. I actually was out of white wine (what others recommended) and used sherry. I also took one reviewers' advice and browned them in the skillet and then baked them in the oven at 350 for 1 hour. THEY WERE SO AWESOME and tender! The gravy was perfect over the potatos. I think they would have been just as nice in the skillet.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only thing I did different was instead of adding the fresh sliced mushrooms. I just used a can of mushrooms and made sure that all of the juice was off of them.

I don't quite know what happened with these pork chops of mine! I probably had poor cuts of meat, but they turned out really tough. The sauce was very runny, almost a soupy consistency. I added artichokes with the mushrooms (this may have added to the runny consistency) and LOVED the combination with the mushrooms. Overall this dish had great taste; I think I will need to tweek the sauce (and buy better meat cuts!). My boyfriend definitely liked this more than I did...

I would give this recipe a three but my boyfriend really loved it so it gets a four. I followed the recipe to a T. In the future I would try some herbs and spices maybe a little Thyme. They were just a little to bland for my likes.

This was great!  I think next time maybe I will add a little sour cream to make it a bit creamier, but it was great just the way it is also.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  It's pretty salty though.  Leave off the garlic salt.  Instead, saute fresh galic cloves before adding the pork to the pan.  Yum!

Sorry - I did not care for this recipe.  I was looking for a good pork chop recipe as opposed to the standard shake-n-bake fare.  The meat was like rubber and the sauce was very bland.  I wound up tossing the leftovers since no one would eat them!

Nice base recipe, as others I added some white wine and milk.  I also added some fresh ginger and rosemary and sauted with onion, and two cloves of garlic.  Seared chops on both sides(big Husker chops about 2" thick)than placed them 13X9 poured sauce over top and baked at 400F for about 15-20min, was very good.

Loved it. The sauce was excellent. I have added the can of mushroom soup to it.. The chops was a bit overcooked but the sauce make out for it.. I use fresh garlic and garlic salt. Yummy will make again. It's simple and most of the ingredients can be found at home.

Fantastic recipe.  The whole family loved it and it was easy to make.  I pre-seasoned the chops with salt and garlic salt.  Added with the soup the dish was a little salty.  Will pre-season with just garlic and peper next time I make it.

Made this again (2nd time)tonight.  As per a few of the other reviews, I added some wine (after sauteeing the onion and mushrooms - which I did separately from the chops), and added a half cup of milk to thin the cream of mushroom soup.  Delicious with homemade mashed potatoes.   My husband is a casserole/meat and potatoes guy, so you can imagine - he LOVES this!!!

I love that it was so quick and easy! Served with the "Pan-Fried Asparagus" recipe.  Perfect Friday night dinner for the boyfriend and I. One change was using fresh garlic over garlic salt.  So much better this way.

I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand, and I also added a bit of beef broth to the mixture.  Probably could have done without it and it still would have been great.  I used sirloin chops and they were soooo tender.

Great pork chops. To keep the pork chops tender make sure you don't brown them or saute them for too long before adding in the rest of the ingredients.

This recipe produced the first pork chop I could cut with a fork!  I followed Jennifer's suggestions and was amazed at the results.  My wife, who doesn't like pork chops went back for seconds.

This recipe was great - it's even fool proof!  I accidentally used cream of chicken soup (only used 2/3 of the can)instead of cream of mushroom and my boyfriend still devoured it.  I took the advice of previous members and added worcestershire, thyme, fresh onions, and white wine.  I used the Beringer Chenin Blanc wine and then we had the rest with dinner.  As side dishes we had some steamed broccoli and Uncle Bens Long Grain and Wild rice.  It was one of the best dinners I've made in a very long time.  I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it was very good but I don't know what it tastes like when you actually follow the recipe.  :)

I thought this was good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 cans of mushroom soup which I thought to be overkill.  Next time I'll just use one.  I did use a full pound of fresh mushrooms as well.

We enjoyed this very much.  It *is* a little bit like a pork stroganoff, but what's wrong with that?  It's quick, easy, tasty and a nice change from chicken.  I used 3/4" bone-in chops (only 2, but used the same quanities for the sauce), fresh mushrooms and served over egg noodles.  The chops were tender enough to cut with a fork and my hubby asked me to add it to the regular rotation.  Thanks!

So What.  It was food and that was about it.  The sauce is a keeper but the pork was just okay.  I look for foods with a wow factor not an "okay I cooked"--made it a second time and for some reason I really liked it and gave it an additional star

Yum. We loved these. I used 5 thin pork chops, so they did not take as long to cook. Will make again soon.

This was ok.  I think I'm spoiled by the famous "Baked Pork Chops II" recipe on this site.  While this was good, that recipe is very similar and just tasted a lot better to me.  However, this one is much less time consuming.  This one just seemed a lot like pork chops in mushroom soup sauce, even with the added white wine....

I made this last night and it came out great!  My husband, who is very stingy with his food compliments, actually said it was 'very good'(though he would have liked mushrooms in it - I didn't have any so I omitted them).
My modifications:
I used the Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup
I added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup lowfat (1%) milk to the cream of mushroom soup.
I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (I already put salt on them, why do I want to add more?)
I used boneless pork chops that were about 1" thick, and simmered them only 10 minutes after adding the soup, and it all came out perfect.  

I will definitely be making this again!

These are the best pork chops around. I don't think I will be able to make pork chop any different way. The only change I made was to thinly slice the onions instead of chop them. The chops were tender & juicy after only 25 minutes. You could easily double the sauce to serve over mashed potatoes or noodles. Yum! I don't think I would change anything except to add a little garlic. Thanks!

A new favorite for pork chops!  The only alteration I made was to loosen up the soup with a can of chicken broth.  I added left-over white rice to the skillet at the end, and served it as a one-dish meal.  Even the kids loved this one.

Not usually a fan of the "mushroom soup" recipes, I didn't have high hopes for this one.  I decided to try it, though, based on all the good reviews. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  I did make a few minor changes that enhanced the flavor.  I didn't have any garlic salt, so I sprinkled the chops with garlic powder instead.  I also chopped up two cloves of fresh garlic and added those with the onions and mushrooms.  Right before adding the soup, I added a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, which I think really added to the flavor.  You could also probably use chicken stock.  After adding the soup, I also sprinkled the whole pan with a dash of dried thyme.  I was tempted to add some water to the soup, but I'm glad I didn't, because it really thins out as it cooks.  The result was a thick, delicious, and plentiful sauce full of mushrooms and perfect for spooning over brown rice.  I also served it with peas.  Good recipe!

This was great! I used pork steaks rather than chops and non-condensed cream of mushroom soup. I also added white wine and threw in a couple of really big green onions cut in half. Served with mashed potatoes, it was just what I had in mind!

Love this recipe!  I used Lawry's Seasoning Salt instead of salt and pepper to season the chops.  I also added a little chicken broth to the gravy.  Great flavor for such a quick and easy recipe!!!

I don't usually cook pork chops this way, but I figured I'd give it a try.  The pork chops had no taste and got tough; the only thing that saved this recipe was the cream of mushroom soup.

I enjoyed this. It does a tad taste "mushroom soup-y," but I love mushrooms, and I put a lot of fresh ones in! I used 2 cans of the reduced fat/sodium soup and fresh garlic, rather than garlic salt. These were also the most tender pork chops I've ever made. Thanks for the recipe.

Very Yummy!!  My four year old son asked for second helpings of mommy's new recipe.  My six year old liked it as well.  My husband and I thought it was a nice change of pace from summer BBQ pork chops!  Very simple to make!  I would definately recommend an extra can of soup like others.  I served it with white rice, and there was plenty of gravy to put on the rice with the extra can of soup. We will definately make again!!!  Thanks!!!

After reading the reviews I really expected these chops to be great. I used the "golden" mushroom soup and it was just so-so. I love mushrooms, but this was sort of bland. Sorry!

I fixed this last night. I did saute the onion and mushrooms, then seasoned the chops with pepper and garlic salt, browned them and then added 2 cans of soup with 1/2 can of water water and added minced garlic then,scraping up the bits left from browning the chops, added the chops,onion and mushrooms spooned some on top of the chops and let simmer for at least 30 minutes Served over rice. The chops were so tender we cut them with our butter knives. Hubby loved this dish and it will be a regular on our menu.

Even though the soup looks thick when you first put it on, it does thin out as it cooks...so I wish I hadn't added milk as it turned out runny.  As far as tenderness goes, this was average for pork chop tenderness.

I sauteed mushrooms and onions first in a little butter and olive oil.  Browned the chops then added mush/onion mixture.  Added soup along with some milk and chicken stock to thin it out a little.  Moist and delicious. I've also used white wine instead of milk as well.

I love this recipe!!!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand so I used canned, still great.  I also served them on a bed of extra wide egg noodles.  It was like pork stroganoff, just yummy

Wow - delicious and so easy.  Spiced the pork like I usually do, served on a bed of brown rice.  Didn't have any fresh mushrooms but this tasted great even so.  (Used 98% reduced fat mushroom soup and this still tasted rich.)  I'll make this again and again!

I thought this was very yummy. I did change it a bit however. I used chicken breasts and baked them separately at 350 for 35 minutes. I made the rest on the stove. I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, a whole medium sized white onion, 14 oz of fresh mushrooms sliced, and a pinch of garlic, salt and pepper, and 1/8 cup of a port red wine. I put it all over rosamarina pasta. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

very good for as easy as it is!  The pork chops came out tender and flavorful.  I have made this several times.  I season the pork chops with sage or pork seasoning along with the salt and pepper.

I was a little disappointed in this... the flavor was good, however my pork came out a little tough. I think maybe thicker, very high quality chops are needed. I used boneless  butterfly chops.  My little boy loved it and ate several pieces, my daughter liked it and my husband hated it. Oh well! :-) I may try this again if I can ever find some good chops.

I thought this was fantastic...quick, easy, and it tasted great!!!  I rubbed the pork chops with minced garlic rather than using garlic salt.  I threw in a 1/4 soup can of milk and added the rosemary that others mentioned.  We'll definitely be making this again!

I tried this first using the original recipe, then again using tips from other reviewers (adding milk, rosemary, etc). I didn't care for it either time. It just didn't  have that much flavor, and I had to put even more pepper on the final product to give it more "punch."

Wonderful recipe!  This was so easy, but so good.  I used fat free mushroom soup.  I served it with seasoned yukon gold potatoes and broccoli.  The pork was so tender and juicy.  This is now a favorite of my husband's.  He usually frowns when I say we're having pork chops.  Not this time!

this was very yummy and the sauce was really good.  i substituded garlic powder for garlic salt (don't have garlic salt).  the first time i made this i added a little bit of milk because the sauce seemed thick but that turned out to be a mistake since the sauce gets more runny as you cook it because it's covered so i won't be making that mistake again.
very simple dish and tasty too!.

This was ok.  Somewhat like a pork stroganoff.  It was lacking in something.  Very quick and easy, though.  I did double the mushrooms and the cream of mushroom soup, which made for a very nice, thick sauce.

This is a good dinner for any night of the week. It's easy, and good. It's probably not fancy enough for company, but is just fine for a regular dinner. I didn't use the onions, and the mushroom soup didn't make quite as much "gravy" as I would've liked. Next time maybe I'll double the amount of soup and mushrooms (we really like mushrooms). Served with white rice. (Would like to try it with egg noodles sometime, too.) I used 5 small chops instead of 4.

Although I am not a big fan of pork, this was actually quite good.  I used season salt and pepper, browned the pork chops then sauteed 1/2 onion, 1 tsp garlic and the mushrooms.  I added 1/4c red wine to the sauce (highly recommend this) and cook in the oven at 350 for an hour. Served over bow tie pasta.  The sauce was wonderful(especially the mushrooms), the pork was well...still pork:)

This was very tasty however I added some additional flavor. To dilute the canned soup taste, I added a splash of red wine, about 2 tablespoons of light sourcream, chopped rosemary (a must!)and topped off with fresh lemon juice and a pinch of paprika. I served with rosemary/lemon pepper potatoes and the sauce was a great addition to the potatoes!

Excellent taste.  Easy to prepare.  We loced it.  I didn't have time to go to the market for the fresh mushrooms so I used the canned ones.  It still turned out perfectly.

Excellent recipe!I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic. I added about 1/4 teaspoon ground sage, 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary and 1/3 cup white wine to the mushroom soup before adding it to the pork chops in the pan. Next time I might try slicing the boneless pork chops into thin strips and adding a mixture of sour cream and a little flour to make it into a stroganoff.

I was pressed for time last night after we got our Christmas tree. Made this recipe and had dinner on the table by the time the tree was in the house and in the stand.I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Served with rice, applesauce and peas. Yummy!

EXCELLENT & EASY!!!  I'm not a very good cook and my family acually raved about this meal!  I think the secret is keeping the lid on during the simmering without opening and stirring.  Mine were so tender just like they had been cooked in the crock pot all day!  I used quite a bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder on both sides and even canned mushrooms (2 cans), can't wait to try it with fresh mushrooms, and a whole big onion which tasted so sweet after the simmering, all the flavors were just amazing!!  Thanks for a meal I can be proud of!

Very Good.  Although, I would recommend using one small onion or half of a large one.  I used a whole large onion and it had a bit too much onions.

My family loved these - even the picky kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds, then thirds. I omitted the onions (hate them), added another half-cup of mushrooms (love them) and served it over brown rice (much more flavor than boring white rice). Next time, I'll use a lower-sodium cream of mushroom soup, though, to cut down on the salty taste.

Wonderful! Really delicious gravy! I was out of garlic salt so I used powder instead-there's enough salt in the recipe to begin with-and it was fine. My kids, who hate mushrooms and are very picky, cleaned their plates, so we'll definitely have it again.

This is a delicious recipe!  I used 98% fat free condensed mushroom soup instead of the regular condensed mushroom soup.  It tasted fantastic!  My boyfriend loved it and he could not even tell that it was low fat.

After all the reviews, I thought this would be good.  I hate to say that we did not like it AT ALL!!!  There is no flavor, something is missing. I will definitely add garlic POWDER if I make it again, which I doubt.  I am sorry, this dish is not for me.

This is an exceptional recipe and while I didn't have a large enough frying pan to add the soup mixture, I placed the porkchops in a roast pan and once the rest of the ingredients were sauteed and heated I put it on top and baked it in the oven. I also subsituted garlic powder for garlic salt. The pork chops were the most tender I've eaten!  Great recipe!

I made this dish last night for my 7-year-old and myself. I thought it was pretty easy and quick to make. My son loved it and ate it very fast. I thought it was okay. I used the 98% fat-free cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

I thought these were very good.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I used canned and they turned out great...probably even better with fresh mushrooms.  They were so tender they practically fell off the bone, and I literally could cut them with a fork. And easy?...fuhgeddaboudit!  I will definitely make these again and again.

The pork chops were very bland. Next time I would sprinkle them with garlic and possibly oregano or some other kind of spice.  The sauce was very tasty over rice.

Awesome! I added minced garlic, instead of garlic salt. Also rubbed some sage into each chop before browning, and added a handfull of mushrooms. Will definitely be making this regularly.

I thought this was really tasty, although a bit salty.  I will probably not season the porkchops before browning because the soup is so salty. This was really quick and easy to put together.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I used 2 butterfly chops and cut them in half to make 4 servings.  The pork was so tender you didn't even need a knife.  And the gravy kept the leftovers just as tender and moist.  I only wish we would have made potatoes instead of rice as a side dish, that would have been great with all of the gravy.

Very good gravy and easy to make.  I just added a little milk with the mushroom soup to make more gravy.  Also added more pepper near the end of cooking.  My eight year old and husband loved it! Thanks!!

Excellent! I did as directed, although I did remove the chops to deglaze the pan with white wine, then added the soup with about 2 TB of heavy cream (for my own tastes) before returning the chops and veggies to simmer.  Fantastic!

I made this for my family for the first time and it was a big hit, even with my 5 and 6 year old granddaughters.  I did change it up a bit based on the reviews (which was very helpful).  

I did sear the chops and added the white wine, etc.,  after; however, I did it in a different order.  I sauteed the onion, mushrooms, and garlic first...  I removed them and then the chops, did the wine, then did the sauce and added the chops to cook them on the stove (due to time).  I paired it with rice pilaf and asparagus and it was great even the next day.  Will definitely make this again and I'm not a pork person, normally, but it was definite good.

A great easy weeknight dinner.  Only suggestion that I can offer is that a pinch of Thyme added along with the mushrooms and onion really adds to the dish.

I also made a healthier homemade cheese soup instead of canned cream of mushroom.   I've loved this recipe for many years.  We need to make more of our favorite recipes healthier.

I made this easy recipe,  however I heeded the warnings pertaining to bland and bumped up the seasoning with McCormick's pepper and garlic (goes with nearly everything) garlic powder and just A touch of season salt,  served over rice and mixed veggie on side,  great meal and super easy YAY on the eve of the eve of thanksgiving.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Followed the recipe and it was very tasty. I will make it again. I tried it with TJ's Portobello Condensed Mushroom Soup and that made it very flavorful. I also used shallots along with the yellow sweet onion and that also added nice flavor.

I'm not a fan of pork chops, so I wasn't expecting much when I made this. It was really good, everyone in the family cleared their plates. I made it as is and only added some cooked rice in at the end as a starch. Definitely will make again.

We really liked this recipe.  Very simple and relatively quick.  I only gave it a 4 because of the directions. I sauteed the veggies first to keep the pork from over cooking.  But other than that for sure will make again.

Well, yes, I changed the recipe. For one thing, mushroom soup (or any canned soup) is just not in my programming, nor as a diabetic.  Instead I use a half cup of chicken stock and 4 oz. of cream cheese. I also used sliced chicken sausage, what I had. Sorry if anyone hates this, but any recipe I use is usually a starting point anyway. It was great.

I found this a bit bland the first time I made it.  So the second time I fried the onions and mushrooms and fresh garlic, then moved into a casserole dish.  Fried the pork chops till nicely brown, added to the casserole dish,then mixed mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper and poured on top.  Baked at 375 F.

It was good, but nothing extraordinary. Good to make when you don't have a lot of time or a plan. Will make again and play with some spices.

This is a recipe that my family asks for time and again.   I made it for years as is and it was always fine.  I do now tweak it just a little.  Instead of seasoning the pork with garlic salt, I season with sea salt, pepper and either ginger or cinnamon, both are good.  I have substituted a shallot for the onion for a little variety and I use 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup as it is a little "soupier" and makes a better sauce. (That last one resulted from a mistaken purchase at the store and surprised me, but now I use it all the time.)

I added golden mushroom soup in place of the standard mushroom soup as well as a touch of garlic powder, (no garlic salt on hand) which added a welcome change. It will be new dinner staple in my home.

This was the easiest recipe ever. It has minimal seasoning and ingredients for someone like me. I thought I had some cream of mushroom but I had already used it. I used cream of chicken instead and it was still amazing. I plated it on a bed of mushroom rice with the onion/mushroom gravy on top with black eyed peas on the side. My husband said this was the best meal he has ate in a while. Thanks Allrecipes, my go to place. Thanks to the chef

Such a simple and easy recipe!  I didn't have a can for condensed cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted it with condensed cream of chicken.  It was very flavorful.  I would certainly make this dish again.

I was looking for a recipe for Pork steaks and came across this. I followed the recipe , except I added about 1/2 of a soup can of water. It was delicious.  I simmered it for about 50 min and it was soo tender.   I'll make it again for sure, but I'll try it with  Pork chops next time.

Yum, yum, yum!  I had taken out pork chops with no clue of what I wanted to do with them.  Allrecipes to the rescue! I took another reviewers suggestion and added about 3/4 cup of dry white wine plus added some chopped garlic to the end when sauteing the onions and mushrooms. Made an excellent gravy over the chops and mashed potatoes. Thank you for the excellent dinner we enjoyed tonight!

Very easy to make, but it was missing something. Just a little too plain for me. I even added a little chicken bullion to the gravy at the end, thinking that would help. It needs an herbal spice added to the recipe to give it a little more depth. Maybe thyme or rosemary would have helped. Deglazing the pan with a white wine after cooking the pork chops may have helped too.

Delectable as is. It was devoured. 2nd time made, I tweaked with Justjen33 tips. I used "boneless premium pork ribeye steaks" seasoned with S&P and some garlic powder,  browned about 1 minute each side in cast iron (until they no longer stick)  and placed them in a 9X13 pyrex pan, set aside. Cooked the shrooms and onions in the cast iron until softened, added 1 cand of Golden Mushroom Soup and a splash of Pinot. Heat through. Pour mixture over pork steaks , cover with foil and bake at 350 for 45 minutes. Delectable and devoured.

I browned the pork chops with salt and pepper, probably a little too long, just need to brown next time.  Then removed and added diced onions and mushrooms, sautéed until translucent and then deglazed with some white wine.  Then added the mushroom soup with about a can of milk.  Then put the chops back in and baked at 350 for 45 mins.  Cooked in the LeCruset covered.

Very simple and fast to make for a busy weeknight. With broccoli on the side and a bit of rice or noodles, this dish is juuuust right.

Didn't have any mushroom soup, so made a little white sauce with butter, flour, milk  and the  mushroom and onion drippings. I had used porcini mushrooms so the flavor was very good and enhanced the pork chops perfectly. Served with baked potatoes, green beans and salad.

My family loved this recipe.  The meat was so tender and fell off the bone.  Flavor was fabulous.  The only thing I did different was I took the juices out of the crockpot and made the gravy on the stove to cook it faster.  I will definitely make again.

This was the perfect pork chop recipe when I needed fast-easy and few ingredients.  Pork chops can be dry and a little tough alone and this solved that situation.  Even though I didn't have the total amount of mushrooms, it came out great and made 2 meals for my husband & I.

I made mine in the crockpot by searing them first, then placing them in the crockpot on low for four hours along with all the ingredients. It was such a hit , I’ll definitely double it next time. Fork tender with enough gravy for mashed potatoes. Delicious.

A stick of butter and 4 oz. of cream cheese made a big difference!! Also, it's fairly low carb...perfect for a Friday night "binge!"

Made for my family and we loved it. I added more mushrooms than recipe called for. Pork chops were tender and not dry.

I made it as is except for the mushrooms (because I didn’t have any). And I added 1/2 cup milk to dilute the cream of mushroom soup. Easy and delicious.

Hubby and I enjoyed this. I sauteed garlic with the onion and did not use salt since pork and the soup have plenty for our taste. I added some sherry to the pan as well. Quick and easy!

Instead of garlic salt i used garlic powder and more than a pinch. This us definitely a keeper. I have done the same thing with cubed steak but I rolled steak in flour with garlic powder,  salt and pepper delicious.

This is just so good. Simple and affordable. Hubby and my 4years old which is a picky eater love it. I prepared it with fried rice and on the next day I prepared it with white rice and still the best. I doubled the ingredients to make sure that we have left over for a couple of days. Dinner SOLVED!

Great recipe. I followed it with only two changes. I used gluten free cream of mushroom soup, and added a half can of milk to make more sauce. My husband and I will be enjoying this again,  We both found it very good.

I'm really bad about taking the time to rate all the recipes I try, but I had to make an exception this time.  I was very hesitant to try this recipe because my hubby usually doesn't like anything with a creamy sauce on it.  But I had some mushrooms I needed to use up before they went bad, so I figured I'd try it once.  Well, he not only liked it, he was practically licking his plate clean.  He loved it, and so did I.  I tweaked original recipe as another reviewer suggested, using white wine and fresh garlic, but otherwise didn't change anything.  The boneless pork chops I used came out moist and tender and delicious.  We put the extra sauce over Texmati brown rice, and that also was yummy.  Definitely going to make this one again.

11/17/18:  I love onion, but this is a LOT of onion.  I either need to use small onions the next time or half the onion.  Also, I am thinking of adding some worchestershire and broccoli with the next bake.  I served this with rice, and I added the rice to the bottom of the baking pan instead of making it separate.  Easy and yummy!

Followed recipe.vey easy will make again. I used  country style pork. Once pork was browned, take them out and sauté onions and mushrooms. Place pork back in pan once mushrooms and onions are cooked. Poured half cup of milk and half cup of red wine plus cream of mushroom and cooked everything down for half hour.. Ate with boiled potatoes and asparagus.  My hubby and I enjoyed it. Delicious.

Agreed with other reviews.  Browned chops and put foil over it and baked in 350 oven for 30 minutes...depends on how thick the chops are.

A very kind friend brought these to us while I was recovering from surgery recently and they were delicious.  She was also kind enough to tell me it was an Allrecipes recipe!  So, now I've made it and we love it.  Per my friend's suggestion, I browned the chops and set them aside, added and sauteed the onions and mushrooms in the same oven-safe pan.  I added about 1/2 can of water to the condensed soup, stirred that and put it into the pan, mixing it with the onions and mushrooms and scraping up the brown bits in the pan.  Then I put the chops back in, turning to coat both sides, covered the pan and baked it at 350 F for 45 minutes.  Yields wonderfully tender chops and delicious gravy.

Added splashes of Marsala wine sauce and half and half cream, and it was yummy. Thick chops were done in 10 minutes, though, so you might want to check them early.

My family loved the mushroom pork chops. I wish I would have browned the chops in a little butter then I should have sauteed the onions and mushrooms  in a separate pan then cover the pork chops along with the cream of mushroom soup. Quick and easy was just what I needed. Thank you for sharing!

I didn't't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned mushrooms instead; sautéed the onions with the canned mushrooms. The gravy for the pork chops tasted great. Very easy and simple recipe; I will make this again.

This is a keeper recipe for me.  My husband gives me the thumbs up or down on a new recipe.  I prepared this because it was quick and easy.  We had a Chinese student staying with us the evening I prepared it.  They both raved about the taste, and she asked if she could have the recipe.  This will be on my table again - as is.  No changes needed, in my book.

I'm a beginner cook and this was really easy. Take my review with a grain of salt because I didn't have any onions, fresh mushrooms, or garlic salt, so I didn't go EXACTLY by the recipe. I used onion powder, garlic powder, and the can of mushroom soup the recipe calls for. It was very tasty and I feel that if I went exactly by the recipe it would be even better.

Quick and easy. Just added more onions for a bit more zing. Perhaps diluting the cream of mushroom a bit should result in a less heavy gravy.

I decided to make this with chicken breast instead of pork chops. Came out delish! I also added two cans of Golden Mushroom soup, fresh garlic, peppers and onions. Chicken was fork tender. Hubby enjoyed it too!

Good basic recipe.  I doctored it up by sauteing cut up mushrooms with the chops, and seasoning with pepper and garlic powder.  I mixed cream of mushroom soup with milk, water and one package of dried onion soup.  No salt needed (onion soup already has salt). Bake until chops are 140 degrees.   Very nice gravy!   Great with mashed potatoes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Four stars as written, but I used a few ideas from other reviewers and it's definitely a 5 star hit.  For the most part salt and pepper on meats don't get it for us.  I added a bit of dried tarragon,  rosemary, and rubbed it in with a drizzle of mushroom & sage infused EVOO. I let this marinade for about an hour.  While browning the chops I included the onions and added 1/2 t of minced garlic.  Normally I have a good wine and would have used that to deglaze the pan, but we'd finished it the night before so I used about 1/4 c broth, then added the mushrooms until just softened and added the cream of mushroom soup.  We aren't big gravy fans, but we agreed this was awesome!

This came out better than I expected. I used golden mushroom soup which deepened the flavor. Served with wild rice and asparagus and corn both of which complimented the mushroom pork chops.

This recipe wasn't really that good. The sauce was too heavy and needed a little something to lighten it, especially since it's condensed soup. I had to add a lot of seasoning to get mine to taste OK but I just felt like I was eating mushroom soup with some pork under it. Not really good.

Simply satisfying. 

Simple ingredients. Simple on the budget.  

 I thought it was high on the sodium.  I wanted to give people a heads up, for those who are concerned about that.  So, that is why I gave it 4 stars. 

Next time I think I will opt for fresh garlic, instead of garlic salt.

I added olive oil as others had suggested. I also used minced garlic and added a teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  The mushrooms  soaked up a little of the white wine and tasted delicious. The pork chops came out nice and tender thanks to the mushroom soup and ample sauce to use on the rice. Thanks everyone for your reviews!

I added a bit to much water to the cream of mushroom soup (did not think about it being to thin). No worries, I just added a second can with no water and thickened up the gravy.

Basically a pork stroganoff over rice.. not super impressed by it My husband enjoyed it though. I followed the directions exactly, aside from adding a little milk to the soup mixture and I let it simmer on the stovetop instead of putting it in the oven like some reviews said. Good, quick recipe for when you want to make something quick, but I wouldn’t serve it to guests.

I love how quick and simple this receipt is. Like everyone says it is missing something.... I am going to try Worchestire next time to it. I definitely want to try it with the white wine.

I've been making a variation of this recipe for quite awhile now and I always receive complements on it, with the chops emerging quite tender, juicy and flavorful  This recipe, as written, is basic  but it can easily be ratcheted up with a few tweaks. The trick, I think, is to season the chops well first --- I usually opt for one of several family favorites;  cajun seasoning, Old Bay, poultry seasoning, or adobo.  This recipe is ideal for a cast iron skillet.  After  browning the  chops, set aslde, and sautee the onions and mushrooms.  Return the chops,  cover with the veggies and the soup, then  take the whole skillet to the oven, covered tightly with foil or a good fitting lid. I usually bake the chops at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops.  I also love  that there's only one pan to clean.

Good stuff.   
I brown the chops with onion  and add white wine to the mushroom soup instead of the water and milk.    Add some garlic and you're good to go!

Tasty recipe.  I changed it up a little based other reviews and ideas.  I  seasoned the bone-in pork loin chops with one of my savory pork rubs and let them sit for 20 minutes.  I sauteed 2 cloves of chopped garlic in some extra virgin olive oil.  Added  the  chops and cooked then all the way through (about 5-7 minutes per side.  I covered them in foil on the side.  Next I sauteed the chopped onion and mushrooms in 1-2 tbsp of butter. After 5 minutes I added the  sauce (whisked together 1/3 cup of dry white wine, 1/3 milk and the can of cream of mushroom), and simmered and stirred until the sauce thickened up slightly. Finally I added the chops back to the pan and covered them. Simmered another 5 minutes and served.

I only added some "Accent" seasoning to the Salt and Pepper a and Garlic powder. Since I used boneless pork chops I only  simmered for 20 minutes.  Came  out delicious. Will make again.

I make this recipe but without these changes, it is very dry and unappealing.  I simply add milk to cream of mushroom soup so that there is some kind of liquid to simmer the chops in - it works for us.  I brown the chops well, as stated in other reviews-most necessary to get the tasty 'bits' that add so much flavor.  I follow the recipes from that point on and we do enjoy.

I took the suggestions of others so I added 2 cloves garlic-minced, used wine and milk and mushroom soup and baked it for 1 1/2 hr.  It was delicious.  My husband said this is a keeper. Thanks to all!

This was awesome! Easy and very very tasty. I used thin bone in pork chops so I simmered for 15 minutes. They were perfect. I did not have garlic salt so I used Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. I will make this again and again and again......

I skipped the onion since I forgot  to buy it. Seasoning salt added a  lot of flavor to the chops along with fresh garlic and deglazing the pan with red wine. My preference is golden mushrooms soup, which made the gravy so good that mashed potatoes was a must. To thicken the gravy I used a little cornstarch, along with removing the chops for a  minute and letting the gravy simmer down a bit. My word of advice is to watch the chops carefully. It is easy to overcook the chops so they become dry. For that reason I prefer preparing this meal on the stovetop so I I can more easily check on the chops. I used a boneless chop and a couple of chops with bones. The boned chops had some grease, but I think this added to the. gravy flavor.

Easy and quick to make. I used another recipe to make cream of mushroom substitute to make it healthier, but it took longer. The pork turns out moist and flavorful.

I loved this recipe. Not only was it really easy, but, I had everything on hand. I used a small amount of olive oil to cook the chops and saute the veggies, and added a little milk to the soup so that it would flow a bit better, but, all in all, this was very tasty. I'm hoping I can use this sauce to make chicken!

This was a really good recipe, though I did follow the changes Cheryl Brick' s made in her review.  However, I  didn't have white wine, so used cooking sherry.  Also,  found to my surprise I had no rosemary, so used sage along with the thyme instead.  It turned out really good!  I'd like to try it with the white wine and rosemary next time to see the difference.   However, this recipe is a keeper for us.  My Mom who has been craving comfort food, loved it!

I made this the other night and it was very easy and had wonderful taste!  I invited my father-in-law and daughter and family on short notice and served it with mashed potatoes.  Everyone at the table raved at how tender the pork chops were.  I used butterfly pork chops with no bone and they worked out so well.  I will definitely be making these in the future.  I want add that I worked all day and had all of the ingredients on hand and we had a great meal in under an hour!

This recipe was amazing!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.
I made a few changes to my liking and made my own gravy instead of the mushroom soup.
After pan searing the pork chops, five minutes per side, in two tablespoons of Canola oil; removed chops from pan.  Added about a tablespoon of butter with the fresh mushroom, onion and also fresh garlic, browned up veggies; added two tablespoons of flour and mixed that around and  then added a can of low fat, low salt chicken broth,  splash of half and half.  I seasoned the gravy with some Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt and pepper and then I transferred chops back to skillet with their juices.  Simmered as suggested in recipe.  At the end, I added a slurry of cornstarch to thicken the gravy some more.
Served over egg noodles with a side of mixed vegetables.

The chops turned out moist and tender. The sauce was delicious. This was quick and easy to make. My kitchen didn't heat up while I cooked this on top of the stove. Fresh mushrooms are best, but I substituted a small can of drained mushrooms with good results. The sauce is great over rice and works with potatoes too.

It's too simple a recipe to make changes to.  That's why I loved it so much.  I think the only difference was that I has boneless pork chops.  They came out really juicy and my family loved the mushroom sauce.  I served them with a lentil zucchini pasta.

So easy and delicious! The only variations I did was that I used some garlic powder instead of garlic salt (too salty) and I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup instead of the original. It was so tasty. This will definitely be in my dinner rotation from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly as written but omitted using salt since the soup had more than enough for the recipe.  This turned out very good. I will definitely make this again.  A great quick and easy dish!

I thought that this was a simple,  but delicious dinner that could be made very quickly. I don't see the comments about it lacking something. I did use more than a pinch of garlic salt to coat the chops.

The pork steaks were lovely and moist, we loved it, we did find we couldn't really taste the mushrooms.  When I made it the second time I cooked the mushrooms separately and added them in once the steaks were cooked, much more mushroom flavour.  Will definitely make it again.

VERY easy & delicious! I didn't even need to reference the recipe again after I scanned it once. I did add fresh mushrooms and garlic-Whole family loved it (except one picky 7 year old who didn't even try it!) Thank you for a great recipe!

Made this with a few variations of my own. Sauteed some onions in butter, added pork chops and braised it with the butter and rosemary and thyme. After browning the chops, I set it aside and cooked the mushrooms in the butter, added 2 cans of the cream of mushroom, added salt, pepper, red chilli flakes, pressed garlic. Then added the pork back in. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Husband and I ate all of it! Will make again and again but only use 1 can of cream of mushroom and thicker cut pork chops as mine were overcooked and tough. Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad. I made it just as the recipe said except that I left out the salt. It was fairly easy. Next time I'll probably dice the pork so that it has more surface area to absorb the sauce.

3 stars means "it was ok" - and it was just that. I love the tastes, especially combined (mushrooms, onions and pork chops) but I felt like something was missing. I splashed a bit of worcestershire into the pan but still kindof mediocre. Maybe some freshly minced garlic? Stir in fresh parsley at the end? I don't know.

Mmmushrooms. I didn't have some of the ingredients so I had to substitute (garlic cloves for the garlic salt part and no mushrooms at all). The first part I kind of marinated for a few minutes with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic. It tasted delicious! Goes well with mashed potatoes~

It was good but nothing to write home about.  Easy?  Yes.  Quick?  Yes.  But I often find pork chops rather dry.  Nothing against this recipe in particular.  Just not my favourite dinner.

Loved the sauce and mushrooms however cooked 1/2" chops after searing chops and then cooking for 15 min extremely tough, next time will not sear and cook for 10 minutes, cook mushrooms and onions a little longer/ Also added white wine
to cream of mushroom soup.  Would double for 4 people

This is a great recipe. My family loves gravy, so next time I think I will put two cans of soup instead of one. I also prefer to sauté the onions and mushrooms a bit longer so they are a little more tender.

Made the whole dish in a heavy bottomed oven proof skillet.  Seasoned chops with salt and pepper both sides.  In skillet with two tablespoons of vegetable oil on low to medium heat  browned onions with chops. Removed chops deglazed  pan with  wine. Added garlic and mushrooms . Cooked until mushrooms started to release moisture and browned just a bit. Keep heat moderate so as not to burn garlic. Next added mushroom soup and half and half,  1 teaspoon fresh rosemary and thyme.  Stirred with spatula until incorporated. Put chops back into pan and coated with mixture. Tightly put aluminum foil over pan and placed into a slow oven, 325 to 350, until chops were tender. About 1 hour depending on thickness of chops. Mine were boneless and about 1 inch thick.  After checking chops for tenderness I added about 8 small honey gold potatoes and resealed aluminum foil and cooked another 15 to 20 minutes until potatoes were done.  I even tossed about 1 cup of frozen green peas in for about 5 minutes at end.  Delicious and only  one skillet to wash.

Just made this for myself and my fiance, he LOVES it and so do I! Only instruction I would add is to let it sit for 5-10 minutes after it's done, so the sauce thickens. Will definitely make this again!

Not bad for a soup based meal.  I thinned the mushroom soup with white wine but changed little else.   Nice  comfort food for a nasty raining fall dinner.

Very good comfort food.  I use Canadian Steak Spice on All meat so that's what I used instead of salt/pepper... I browned the chops in coconut oil, removed them from the pan and sauteed the onion (sliced, not diced) and fresh mushrooms with 3 tsp.  of chopped garlic. Deglazed with 1/2 C water.  Mixed 2 cans crm.  of mushroom with one can 2% milk.  Put the chops back in the pan and poured on the soup. I put it in the oven on 350 for an hour. I used loin sliced an inch or so thick for chops. Served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  So glad I doubled it!  These will be great leftovers!!! Will definitely be making this again!!!! Thanks for the post.
p.s. Made in one large stainless fry pan so quick clean up too!

This was absolutely delicious but I altered the recipe after reading the reviews. As one review suggested I sautéed garlic first and then browned the chops. I removed the chops and added the onion and mushrooms and sautéed a few minutes. I mixed 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup milk with the mushroom soup, put the chops back in and covered with the sauce. I seasoned with tarragon and marjoram. I placed the covered skillet in the oven and baked at   325. I had thick chops and after 1.5 hours they were very tender. This is a keeper.

I'm definitely making this again! I sautéed the mushrooms and onions ahead of adding the chops, added white wine to thin out the soup, and put a little soy sauce on the chops before I added them to the pan. Everybody loved it. The sauce and veggies would be great on chicken, too, I bet.

DELICIOUS & TENDER!!!

Thank for a wonderful recipe.  I added extra mushroom soup to ensure enough gravy for mashed potatoes.  I'll make this again and again. The wife raved over taste and tenderness! !!

I love chops made this way, I have been making them for over 30 years. I found it on the back of a cream of mushroom soup can. The key to the best ones are to use smoked pork chops!! It adds that missing taste many of you are looking for. 
These are good as well with some tweaking, easy enough to figure out. Simmer for a full hour once they are done though..the added time just makes them juicer and more tender.
Happy cooking!

Great recipe. Very simple to make. 
Because I needed more sauce, I added a can and half of heavy whipping cream (once I added the mushroom soup, I measured in the can the cream).
I also added a splash of marsala cooking wine to the onions and mushrooms in the pan, that's for personal preference.

I had really thick porch chops and I overlooked them a bit but the sauce was wonderful. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used a small can of sliced. I also added about a half cup of white wine towards the end because I was trying to thin the sauce out, which was delicious. The sauce would be good on chicken or beef also.

I also changed things  up a little  bit . I deglazed pan with white  wine, used two cans mushroom  soup and half can milk.  A little  thyme.  I used butterfly chops. Served over mashed  potatoes.  And note to self I baked at 350° for 45 minutes then took foil off and baked for additional 15 minutes.  Very good!

I cook pork chops often and I LOVE mushrooms so I thought this recipe would be perfect. However, cooking them on the stove top is not my favorite way to make pork chops. I prefer to grill them so they soak up and keep the favor and juices. I made it the way the recipe called for and I did not agree with the taste of the pork chop made stove top style.

I took the recommendation of others and used two cans of soup, 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I used some seasoned salt on pork chops, browned them and moved to baking dish.  I then cooked the mushrooms and onion in oil left over from chops.  Mixed the soup mixture with the vegetables and pour over pork chops.  Baked at 350 for one hour.  Was amazing with lots of gravy for the mash potatoes.  Family loved it.

A delicious and filling recipe! My family loved it, even the youngest who hates mushrooms. This is most definatly a recipe I'll continue to make. One issue though is that I personally think the directions need to be more organized and descriptive.

I made this recipe as written. I used a thick boneless pork chop. Cooking it 20 minutes was plenty of time. The chops were moist and tasty. This is definitely a keeper.

Trying to get better organized, I was going through copies of old recipes that I had printed out, mostly from this site. I came across this one that I had made a few times, over 10 years ago!! All I had written on the copy was 'Excellent', and to add some water to it. I think it just may be time to try this again!!!  UPDATE 7/11/16:  I topped the chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder before browning. After they were browned, I removed them and added mushrooms and onions to saute. When those were done, I put the browned chops back in and topped with the sauce. For the sauce this time, I also added 1/4 c each of milk and white wine, some tarragon and black pepper. They cooked perfectly at 20 min. (My chops were on the thinner side.) One thing though, the sauce seemed a little salty so I would omit or lightly use salt on the chops. The soup wasn't overly high in sodium, but I would definitely be light-handed with the salt.

Very good. I added white wine to the dish and did what a few others suggested (browned the chops first) before baking them.

This is the second time I made this pork chop dish and love it. 2 seasoned chops, medium high heat, 4 minutes per side. 1 sliced onion, 8 oz of sliced mushrooms and a can of mushroom soup. Cover the pan, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, can't go wrong. Pouring the sauce over the chops, with rice on the side. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe, super easy and very tasty. I used two cans of soup and added a splash of white wine. I removed the pork chops while sautéing the onions and mushrooms, mixed the sauce in and then added them back. I served over egg noodles and topped with green onions. Very easy weeknight meal.

WOW. This was so much more than the sum of its parts. The only change I made was the addition of a small amount of fresh rosemary, because I had some to use up, and pork plus mushrooms plus rosemary is a no brainer. I cannot wait to make this again! Fast, easy, and delicious.

I always season my meat so that was a no brainier! However, I followed a previous user and browned the bone-in pork chops in extra virgin olive oil. Due to the size of the 5 chops I had to use 2 9x13 pans. I used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and a half can of evaporated Pet Milk mixed them together in a bowl; splitting it between the 2 pans.  Baked an hr in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees covered tightly in aluminum foil. Fabulous! Tender! Will definitely make it again.

OML! This came out fantastic! The only thing I did different was adding a 1/2 cup muscato(it was all I had for white wine, lol) and 1/2 cup milk to the golden mushroom soup. I also used red wine and a little butter to sauté my mushrooms and pearl onions ( only type of onions I had). Guess it was a wine kind of night, lol.

I thought this was fabulous.  One of the easiest recipes I've ever tried but it tastes great. just as is.  When I re-heated it, I cut up the chops into bite sized pieces added a little sherry and it was even better the second time.!  I am going to try this with chicken breasts and steak too.

I browned chops in 1 Tbsp. olive oil with some Adobe, salt & pepper , parsley and chicken seasoning for the grill. Then sauteed onions, fresh garlic & fresh mushrooms. Placed chops in glass baking dish topped with onions, garlic & mushrooms. In small bowl combined cream mushroom soup with 3/4 cup milk & 1/4 cup cooking wine. Baked @ 350 for 1 hour. Delicious and plenty of gravy to pour over garlic mashed potatoes.

This dish as written is not anything to rave about. It is a good base recipe and I am going to make it again with the following changes: add white wine to dilute the soup because the sauce is too thick and gummy as written; I'll add more mushrooms and thinly sliced green peppers to the veggies; and flour the chops before frying. I might add dill weed to the sauce because the sauce is begging for herbs.

I made this tonight., using  wild oyster mushrooms found on Christmas Day. I don't like to rate a recipe if I'm not using the exact ingredients, one of the reviews recommended Golden Mushroom soup which I had on hand. I would definitely make this again, using the Cream of Mushroom soup, as I'm sure it would be just as good.

to make the meal stretch further, freeze any left over 'soup' juices and when you want it, saute a few extra mushrooms with 1 garlic clove, then defrost the frozen soup base  in another saucepan and add the mushrooms and garlic and stir in about 1/4 cup full fat milk. now you have some soup! yummy

Will definitely be making this again. Might tweak it a little... some red wine, sherry, or even bourbon would do well in this recipe and add another dimension of flavor to it.

Simple and delicious! I added just about a teaspoon of fresh garlic with the onion and mushrooms. Because of the simple directions and ingredients I have it at a 5 star for a weeknight dinner!

Great base recipe!  I removed the meat from the pan and sauteed onions 5 to 8 mins, mushrooms about 4 mins and fresh minced garlic about 2 mins.  I deglazed the pan with a little Marsela wine and waited til the alcohol cooked off before mixing Golden Mushroom & little milk to the pan.  I placed the chops back in there and spooned the sauce of the meat.  I put foil over the pan and slid them in the oven for an hour.  They came out perfectly!  Served over baby red mashed potatoes and a side of steamed vegetables.  YUMMY!

Absolutely love this recipe! Quick and easy and soooo flavorful! I added minced garlic and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic rather than regular cream of mushroom soup! In this house garlic makes most dishes a little better!

When my eight year old takes a bite and says mmmm, I know it's a winner. I made one small change by using 3/4 a can of golden mushroom soup and half a can of regular mushroom soup.    Yummy.

This was a great recipe for the end of a long day. I changed it up a bit, I made it more of a one dish meal by cutting unpeeled potatoes into bite size pieces and adding frozen peas.  My husband and teenage son loved it!

Very good and easy recipe. I had a pound of mushrooms that needed to be used and it wasn't too many at all. Also I browned the chops, removed from the pan, deglazed pan with 1/2 cup white wine, added the mushrooms and onions, sautéed those for 5 minutes, added the soup and the chops and simmered for 20-25 minutes. I also added a clove of minced garlic with onions. I served it over tender Arborio rice. Yum! Thanks, mmcgee

This was surprisingly good!  My expectations weren't super high with the cream of mushroom soup, but it actually turned out very savory and tasty.  It didn't taste like canned soup to me.  My only change was to remove the pork chops to a plate so I could saute the onions and mushrooms a bit, then I returned them to the skillet.  My other tip would be to keep watch on the temperature of the pork chops and pull them off the stove when they reach 145.  I used really big, thick chops (each was about 10 oz) and mine were done after 15 minutes, can't imagine any chops taking 30.

My children who are 2 and 4 and picky when it comes to pork had two servings each, my husband ate the rest and he IS NOT a fan of cream of mushroom soup, i did cook in the oven and add 1/2 can of milk to the soup and blended until smooth, also sauteed mushrooms and onions in skillet after browning the chops! Great recipe though!

I'll admit I'm not a big pork chop fan, but I tried this recipe and liked it a lot!  So did my husband and kids and we've made it a couple more times over the past month.  I have used both fresh mushrooms and canned mushrooms and both have turned out pretty good!

I feel like I'm always cooking the same things over and over....so I decided to give my regular pork chops and twist... I tried this recipe out....and omg it was a hit with my husband! I did change a few thing, my husband doesn't like mushrooms so I made a pan for him which I substituted onions instead...and then my pan was with the mushrooms and onions. Also I did as another review said and I mixed the can of cream of mushroom with a half a can of milk. And pored that mixture over the pork chops. It was delicious!!

It's about what I expected. My children and husband love pork chops; I on the other hand would be ok if I never saw another one again. This covered the flavor and texture enough for me and gave the rest of my family an indulgence that they wanted. I threw some sour cream into the mixture to tang it up a bit and served it all over noodles. The kids and hubby ate it all!

I made the recipe exactly as stated, but thought the gravy was a little anemic looking.  To make it look more appealing and add a little heartier flavor, I added 2 Tablespoons of Gravy Master.  The family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this okay, maybe it was the gluten free cream of mushroom soup I used, but it tasted a little bland to me.  I will try it again and make some changes that some of the other reviewers made.

My mother made this for years although with Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup. She also boiled white rice and the gravy on the rice is excellent!

Excellent recipe, substitute garlic salt with  fresh garlic (2-4 minced cloves), deglaze pan with white wine, add soup and cook as directed.  Serve with wild rice and veggies.

Absolutely Wonderful!

Let me just say that I'm not a great cook! I can follow a recipe but I don't have the natural talents or intuition of a lot of the great cooks on this website.  However, I followed this recipe with the following recommended tweaks... I put some olive oil in a skillet and added 3 cloves of fresh garlic and cooked for a while to flavor the oil.  Meanwhile I salted, peppered and garlic powdered my chops ( I had more than 4 so I cooked them in batches )...Removed garlic then browned both sides of the pork chops (mine were boneless..not thin cut) then put them in a 9X13 I had sprayed with Pam.  Once they were all browned I put some red wine (others used white wine but red was what I had... about 1/2C ) into the skillet to get up all the pieces at the bottom then put in my onion and mushrooms.  I used presliced mushrooms to save time.  I cooked them in the wine till they got a little soft.  Then I put them in a big bowl and mixed with 1 can golden mushroom soup, 1 can of mushroom with garlic soup, and 1/2 can of half and half. I put that on top of the pork chops and baked 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then 15 minutes uncovered.  Company was running late so I turned the oven off and left the dish in to stay warm for another 20-30 minutes.  Even with that it was delicious.  I didn't think the soup would make the gravy so wonderful and the house smelled great!  It is definitely worthy of guests with the tweaks...Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe. I took the suggestion of adding the wine but I add it after browning the chops very well and sautéing the onions and mushrooms. The flavorful is awesome. Next time I will try some of the other suggestions. What I like about this recipe is how easy if is to adjust it to your own taste.

I fried the chops in Crisco. Oil is healthier, but doesn't brown as good. Used 2 cans of soup with" a little" milk, a small container of fresh mushrooms and one slice of red onion minced. Tender and delicious!!!!!!!

This was so much better than I expected, didn't have the mushroom soup look or taste. I made 8 pork chops with the other ingredients unchanged and it made lots of sauce.

My husband loves onions and said that it needed more onions.  Love that it is an easy & fast meal to make. Will serve it with mashed potatoes next time to use up the mushroom soup gravy, as I only made two chops.

Used Amy's organic mushroom soup and it was too watery since that brand isn't thick like Campbell's. Good flavor overall - I used to make this in casserole and bake in oven when I was growing up and it is good, simple food. Be sure to have starch such as rice or potatoes to go with it..

Simple but delicious. Added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the cooking oil for the pork and fresh thyme to the soup mixture. Reduced the pan with a few ounces of white wine. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes.

I've made a similar recipe for many years. Just never tried it with onion. I also peel and slice potatoes and season them with garlic powder and pepper. Then top them with mushroom soup in the same pan. Very, very tasty.

I have been making this dish with pork chops OR chicken for 40 years. The only change I make is, I use Cream of Celery for a more delicate gravy. We do not like the strong mushroom taste. This has been a winner  every time. (One can of cream of Celery plus one can of water. Do not use milk as it tends to burn.)

I've been making this for years sans onion & mushrooms. The addition of these does take it up a notch but the reason I gave it only 3 stars was the garlic salt. The canned soup is plenty salty enough without the addition of garlic salt. I use garlic POWDER instead & it's not nearly so salty. I add a sprinkle of black pepper too.

I spiced this up with steak seasoning, which put it to 4 stars.  Without extra seasoning, it would have been too bland (3 stars), so make sure you add more seasoning.  I served it on top of garlic mashed potatoes, which really made it good.

Great recipe! Soo yummy with mashed potatoes covered with the sauce :) I followed advice to bake it after searing and sautéing only because my pork chops (5) couldn't fit in the pan to simmer. Husband loved every bite of it! So easy too!

Been doing this for years and we love it. So quick and easy. I do use fresh or garlic powder instead of salt. Soup has enough. We will also use nice big hamburgers. Always fix boiled potatoes. Soup makes good gravy.Can be done with chicken breast too.

Quick, easy, and delicious. My husband ate it right up. I paired it with rice and a side veggie.

Wow.  These pork chops were absolutely phenomenal.  I only did one thing slightly differently: I used a little bit of olive oil in the pan to help the chops and veggies saute.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  My husband said they were the best chops I've ever made, and I'm inclined to agree with him.  Even my son had half a chop for himself, and he hates pork chops!

Great recipe. I did add 1/2 cup white wine and 3/4 milk and used 2 small cans of mushrooms because I didnlt have fresh on hand and this turned out incredibly good! I also cooked the onions and sauted mushrooms with some garlic in a seperate pan just to speed things up again and then after deglazing the pan with the white wine and simmering the alcohol off a bit, tossed in the mushroom onions mixture and then tossed in the soup. Next time I may try serving over egg noodles. Definitely a keeper and love how fast it was to make!!

Tried this,as it is written set timer for 20min, and found that the pork chops were over done... I think I will try a few changes others tried next time. I was happy to find this as I actually had all the ingredients to make it.

This was a quick, easy and pretty tasty way to prepare pork chops. Not out of this world, but I will probably make this again sometime. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this with chops and pork butt steaks and it is really good.  I use minced garlic and 1/2 can of milk, otherwise as directed.

This was pretty good but needed bit more seasoning or something.  I made this almost exactly as written except that I added a about a cup of white wine - 1/4 cup to deglaze the pan after browning the chops and the rest I mixed into the soup before adding it to the pan.  After I made it, I read some of the other reviews (I usually do it before I make something but didn't this time) and next time I'll add some minced garlic and herbs.  Served it with wild rice blend but I think it would also be good with mashed potatoes.

These were great! I see a lot of reviews that made the dish more complicating and I think it is great just how it is! Super easy and delicious. I would recommend letting the chops sit 5-10 minutes after cooking so the sauce can thicken. I also added a close of garlic at the same time as the onions and mushrooms. very good and easy recipe!

This is a keeper recipe.  My boys raved about this one!  Easy recipe to make and absolutely delicious.  I had mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with it.  Topped the pork chops with fried onions.

Yum!Yum! Yum! Yummy!!! This was so good.  I did use bone in chops, doubled the mushrooms and soup, and served with mashed taters!!  I did bake the meal in the oven because I was way behind in laundry and it all tasted good.  Even my picky husband, who thinks that the only acceptable way to cook chops involves shake-n=bake, mashed taters, and peas liked this!!!  So did my teens!!  I will add this to the list of yummy dinners!!!

I have been making this for many years and love it. It's easy, quick to put together and delicious. One usually has all the ingredients already in the pantry to boot. I've also "fancied it up" by adding a little wine, Worchestershire sauce, tarragon or whatever strikes my fancy at the time. It's pretty much a foolproof recipe as long as you take care not to overcook the chops. By the way, this is also an excellant way to cook chicken. I'm just sayin'. :-)

I've been making this recipe for a very long time. I always add a half a can of milk to the skillet and slowly simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours to make the chops nice and tender. This one is a family favorite. Even the little ones love it. Serve over brown or a mixture of brown and wild rice.

I hate giving bad reviews, but I was definitely disappointed.  I actually took into consideration some of the suggestions that everyone else gave.  I tenderized the meat slightly, added milk and deglazed with a bit of wine as one reviewer suggested.  The meat was cooked well.  The sauce came out good, but honestly, the pork did not serve as a good base for all this.  I could have had a healthier meal with chicken or veggies under this sauce.

I come from a culinary culture with a lot of pork (Vietnamese and Chinese).  Most of the recipes I know of require a lot of marinating or stewing to get the flavors to blend together.  This is essentially a good sauce that you can toss on healthier item.  For me, personally, pork can be put to better use in another recipe.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand, so I substituted cream of onion.  I knew the flavor would be pretty mellow, so I heavily seasoned the pork chops (I cut up a pork loin into chops) with Cajun seasoning, salt, pepper, and fresh garlic.  I have 3 little ones, so before serving I cut up all of the meat and put it back in the sauce.  It made for a very enjoyable meal.

Fantastic. I know people complain about reviewers who deviate from the original recipe, but this is great as is if you have simple tastes. For those of us who like to spice things up a bit, I made it again using a splash of white cooking wine and a little bit of milk to the sauce and seasoned the chops with a little bit of meat tenderizer instead of salt. My DH was in love with the gravy, better than the basic recipe. Great thing about this recipe is that for people who aren't kitchen savvy, anyone can make this, I'm thinking I might start teaching my son to cook, and this is a great starter recipe as we move on from our microwave/toaster oven dishes.

tenderize your chops before cooking!! Also the recipe says sauté the mushrooms for one minute, do it for way longer than that. Make sure they're soft!

It was tasty, after we added some white wine, garlic, garlic plus and grilled vegetable seasoning and it was delicious! Will defiantly be making this again.

We are a working family and don't have too much time to prepare a meal and this was spot on. Prep was minimal and outcome was delicious. The recipe is flexible enough so you can personalize it and change it up to suit your tastes or mood.

Super easy.  Great with rice.  Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt to cut down on the sodium.

This makes the most tender pork chops!  I followed other reviewers and after browning I put the chops in a 9x13 pan and covered with the cream of mushroom soup and a little milk and covered with tin foil.  They were just falling apart!

After reading the reviews, I did make a couple of adjustments.  First, I purchased boneless thin chops and that was nice because the cook time was less.  Also, I wouldn't recommend the garlic salt - either real garlic or garlic powder.  I did deglaze my pan with white wine and put in fresh garlic and thyme.  After the alcohol had cooked off, I put in the fresh mushrooms, the soup, and a half of can of milk, stirring all together.  Lastly, I put the chops back in with a lid and this meal was done thirty minutes later.  Beautiful!

My 5 year old son LOOOOOVED this and couldn't get enough !  I did what someone suggested & browned it first, then put it in a Pyrex dish & baked at 350 for 45 min (actually it said an hour, but my pork were cutlets, not chops).  I used a Family sized Cream of Mushroom for extra sauce (I didn't add the milk, but will try that next time) and my son kept asking me to add more sauce to his.  This is a keeper.

This recipe is soooo good!!  I doubled up on the mushrooms and took the pork chops out n let the mushrooms and onions sautee for about 10 min and then I added the soup, stirred up, and then added the chops back and let simmer. My picky teenagers love this!!

Yum! Quick note & it makes it sooooooo much better, same time, tasty & WAY healthier. Aluminum is linked to all sorts of bad stuff for us down the line, & if you read what’s in the canned version, there is partially or hydrogenated  as we all know is horrible for us. Use the cartons or little boxed organic crème/condensed soup. you may pay a dollar more or get on sale but boy is it a HUGE difference! The brand I see at all grocery is Pacifica & trader joes makes them now & Sprouts carries them. There is portabella, golden & cream of chicken. All of my recipes calling for canned soup, (my family loved) have now been made over & even my 7 year old noticed. Husband will only get the cartons now as well!! Im adding this to my box & thank you!

OMG this was so easy and so good!! The entire house smells so wonderfully. I DID use some of the advice from other reviewers - deglazed pan with Marsala wine, &  added cream to the sauce. Finshed off in the oven as I still had some chores to finish. Had over wild rice with steamed  broccoli and carrots.  EVERYONE ate everything.  Thank you for another great meal to add to our rotation.  I can't wait to share this with our daughters..

I followed the lead of others. I browned the chops (12). Put chops in a 16x13 pan. Sauteed a diced onion, 1 lb of chopped mush and a head of garlic minced. Added soup (lg can),1/2 can milk and 1/2 of cab wine (I know but the only other wine I had was White Zin-too sweet). Pour over chops. Cooked it for an hour at 375ish. Tough. Cooked it for another 30 min. Getting there. Another 30 mins and I was too hungry to care BUT it was pretty tender and my dh and 3 teenagers LOVED it. Some one usually hates something. Great recipe. I just need to make a note to plan to cook for 2 hours if I use so many chops. It was a Sams pack of center cut. Make sure you have lots of mashed potatoes.

The pork was tender and it was pretty good, I just thought it was a little bland...it definitely did get better on the second day though!  I guess the flavors came together a little better.

Splendid. I took JustJen33's advice and baked this for an hour after browning the meat/veggies. I did brown with a little balsamic vinegar dressing. Came out of the oven tender and full of flavor. Will make often!

We make these all the time, just omitting the mushrooms, I think there's plenty of mushroom bits in the soup.  I bake them in the oven like one of the top reviews recommended, and we LOVE them!

This was great.  We omitted the onion since none of us like it and used some onion powder instead.  Also we were out of mushrooms, so I wasn't able to use those either.  I was surprised it came out so good considering how few ingredients it takes!  I will definitely make this again and add mushrooms next time.

Five Stars because of it's ease and family-pleasing flavor!  Couldn't be more simple!  I prepared using boneless pork chops, made a double batch in an electric skillet.  My whole family, including my young children loved the gravy the soup made.  Tender and Perfect!

I gave this recipe a four star just because it needs a little more. I had to use two cans of mushroom soup to smother the pork chops and it will also leave some extra to put on your mash potatoes which just makes the dish. I recommend leaving the pork chops simmering in the soup for 35 minutes or so. It lets the pork chop marinate in the seasonings and mushrooms. Definitely makes the chops more flavorful. My two sides were mashed potatoes with the extra gravy and green beans which I sauteed with the extra onion and mushrooms.

Good and quick dinner!  Also pretty healthy if you exchange out the soup and use a low fat/low sodium cr of mushroom soup instead.  My husband liked it, which says a lot in this household!

Mmmmmm! This turned out moist and flavorful. The sauce would make an excellent gravy for mashed potatoes if you make some extra and add a little flour.

I thought 1-1/2 hours for baking already seared chops would be way too long, and I found them to be way overcooked, no longer resembling the beautiful chops I started with. I made a mushroom cream sauce from scratch which was lovely... I will go back to my standard method: a quick sear and 15 minutes each side in braising liquid over very low heat... sans bread crumbs.

I don't like to write anything negative,  but I found this recipe very  BLAND even after deglazing with wine and adding garlic as suggested by previous reviews.  Also, with cooking the pork chops for the minimum time, they were tough.  Would not make again.  :>(

This is the recipe I've been making for over 30 years - with one addition. Before browning the chops, I coat them liberally with yellow mustard. Don't bother with oil in the pan - the browned mustard fond is what gives the dish its savory flavor, and the soup will release what's stuck to the pan. My mother made this when I was young, but used chicken rice soup. I prefer the cream of mushroom. I like the addition of onions and mushrooms. Oh, and it's always served over wide noodles, by family tradition.

I had a memory of these very tender pork chops baked in cream of mushroom soup but I could never find the right recipe.  This is exactly what I had been looking for.  I loved this when I was a child and have not had this for 25 years but now that I have 'discovered' this recipe I will be making it regularly.

Delicious and flavorful! I have a hard time finding foods that are so full of flavor as this one. Easy to make light; use a reduced fat Cream of Mushroom instead of regular.

This is a great comfort food. My dad and I make this and serve it with mashed potatoes (we use the sauce as gravy). The only differences in our recipe is we caramelize the mushrooms before adding the cream of mushroom soup COMBINED with a can of water. we used boneless lean pork chops, as well. i've never tried onions in it because the roommate hate's them but sometimes i'll add onion powder along with garlic powder for extra flavor. we let the pork simmer for an hour+ or until it's tender and falling apart. it's yummy!

Was very tasty, as well as easy to make.  I would suggest a bit more garlic, but then again I like the taste of garlic.

Realy enjoyed this recipe, with a few additions. We like more sauce, so we used 2 cans mushroom soup. Since we didn't have fresh mushrooms, we used 3 cans of sliced mushrooms, drained. Then, using one of the soup cans for measure, we also added one-half can of milk, and one-half can of white wine. It turned out quite tasty!! Will make this again, as it is so easy. (by the way, serve this with mashed potatoes, and the sauce makes a great gravy!!)

Whole family Loved it! I thought it was way too salty (and I like salt) so I need to cut back on that. But I, too, used the white wine/deglaze method, added some milk, a pinch each of tarragon and thyme. Used thin cut bone-in pork chops, cooked 30 minutes--very good!

Pretty good, will make again. However, when I went to cook the porkchops on medium high heat they almost burnt and I was watching them closely. Would recommend a lower heat setting. Loved the sauce, wish the porkchops absorbed more of the mushroom flavor/sauce.

So my best friend in the whole world gave me this web-site to find some great recipes. I fell in love at once. I came across this recipe today in fact and had all the stuff I need. It was fabulous. I de-glazed the pan with white wine and add the 2 can of cream of mushroom to make some extra sauce for my rice pilaf. Kid tested and approved. Family enjoyed very much and we will be adding it to our rotation of meals.

The chops were very tender.  The sauce was thinner than I wanted but I think the fresh mushrooms add a lot of water to the mix.  I browned the chops with the onion, and then finished cooking them in the crockpot.

My only change was using 'meat magic' seasoning with ground pepper instead of the above listed.  I am not a mushroom person, but my boyfriend loves them.

Superb!!  I made a few changes. I used 8 boneless pork chops.  Trim all the fat from the chops.  I sprinkled chops with "Magic Seasoning Blends" (for pork and veal).  Brown chops on both sides.  Put in 9 x 13 (or larger) pan. Cover with sliced portobello mushrooms and 1 large thinly sliced onion.  Sprinkle with seasoning over everything.  Blend together 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of golden mushroom soup, and 1 can milk. (I used a blender to thoroughly blend the soups and milk together.) Pour over chops, mushrooms and onion.  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.  You're gonna love it!  Use the sauce over mashed potatoes.

Lots of mushrooms! And the cream soup started congealing - not appealing aesthetically. I prefer my pork chops in the oven, too. Overall, this just didn't meet our food preferences.

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so used canned, but tasted great.  The cream of mushroom over the top really adds a unique flavor.

My husband loved this recipe!  I did take the advise to chop the potatoes and add to the chops.  For a vegetable, I put my favorite veggies in a pan, covered with heavy cream and baked til tender.  Then sprinkled with shredded Gruyere cheese, put back in oven until melted.  My husband was in heaven last night!  You can also use chicken stock instead of cream and parm. reggianno instead of Gruyere.

This was AWESOME!!! I fixed mashed potatoes and green beans and used the soup from the pork chops as a gravy. My 15 month old ate it up! She hadn't been eating very well lately, but her plate tonight ended up empty!

This is a very good recipe.  I substituted chicken for the porkchops. I went with the advice of others and added 1/2 c. of white wine and 1/2 c. milk. I also seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic powder before browning. Cooked for 1 hour on low heat. Served over rice.

This was an overall good recipe.  The reason why I gave it a 4 was because I changed a few things and deviated from the cooking time. I seasoned both sides of the chops first with garlic powder, sea salt, and black pepper.  While I had that marinating a bit I whisked together a 1/2 cup of condensed milk with 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I sauteed the chopped onion and mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil.  Removed the veggies then quickly seared the pork chops.  I then reduced the heat to low then added the sauteed veggies back in.  Next evenly poured the milk and soup mixture over the veggies and chops and simmered on low heat for 1 hour and 15 minutes. The chops came out very tender and there was plenty of sauce for the chops, rice and/or potatoes you wish to eat with it.

This was a great recipe! The only changes I made were to use a full can of cream of mushroom, and added a 1/2 cup of milk.

Excellent meal even though my husband is
diabetic.  Had a green salad to go along
with this instead of rice or pasta. Barbara, Houston

This recipe was great!  Be careful not to overdo the chops due to cooking time - ours were done long before the estimated time.  The gravy was amazing, I found myself using bread to scoop up every last bite!

I read the reviews and added milk and white wine, but felt the gravy needed a bit more help.  Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes, and more garlic.  Pork was moist and tender.

This was a fantastic recipe! We didn't have any onions on hand so we used onion powder, no olive oil so we used canola oil, and used one can of sliced mushrooms. 1) Spiced Porkchops with ground pepper and garlic salt (omitted the table salt entirely), 2) Heated canola oil over med-high heat and browned porkchops on each side and removed from pan 3) Sauteed mushrooms in the canola oil and addded onion powder and some tarragon leaves 4) Wisked 1/2 c. of milk with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 5) When mushrooms were sauteed, I added a pinch of tarragon leaves to the milk/mushroom soup mixture and sprinkled some on the waiting porkcops 6) Placed porkchops back in pan on med/low heat 7) Poured Milk/Mushroom mixture over porkchops, put lid on, and let simmer for 25 minutes 8) Added 1 tbs. powder to left over gravy for mashed potatoes - MMMM!

This was such a great dish and my boyfriend's mom said they were the best porkchops she's eaten - including her mom and grandmother's. Judging from her own wonderfully delicious cooking, that's one heck of a compliment!

This is definitely going in the recipe box! Thanks!

WOW... OMG...  I just finished eating and I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could go back for seconds.  That was amazing!!!  Of course, I made a few changes...

I used dried porcini mushrooms...  Boiled them in water to rehydrate and then used the water with the mushroom flavor to make some rice...  So Good!!!

Also, I used Marsala and Sherry Wine to delaze the pan...  I can't until the lunch tomorrow, so I can eat more of it...  This is a must try recipe, and so easy!

Thanks again for sharing this wonderful recipe, I look forward to cooking this one time and time again...

I thought this was fabulous.  My boyfriend ate 4 pork chops!  And was getting the rest of the gravy up with bread!  He loved it!  I sauted garlic in olive oil and put browned the pork chops in it.  I then took them out and put them in a baking pan.  I then put the chopped onion (which I coarsely chopped) and mushrooms in the pan and cooked those a little and added some red wine (Shiraz) which I had on hand.  Cooked those for a while for the alcohol to be cooked out, then added cream of mushroom soup and golden mushroom soup with about 1/2 a cup of milk.  I let that boil a little, then poured it over the pork chops in the baking pan.  I covered it with foil and put it in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes.  It came out delicious with tons of gravy!  The onions and mushrooms came out delicious.  I thought the pork chops could have been a little more tender, but  either way, great!

This recipe was pretty good.  Per others' suggestions, I added milk and sauteed fresh garlic and mushrooms.  I also put it in the oven for 1 hour.  I think if I tried it again I would probably cook it stovetop like the original recipe suggests, just to see if the meat comes out more tender.

I have been making this same recipe for years! It's quick and cheap. I serve it with some steamed veggies over a bed of rice because the extra sauce is great on rice.

This was very easy to make, easy to clean up after and tasted good.  My kids (5 and 6 years old) also ate it.  I had to scrap off the mushrooms but they ate the pork chop with the gravy.  I will make this again.

My husband & I really enjoyed this-I did add a couple of things; seasoned the chops with rosemary and paprkia in addition to the salt,(I use sea salt) & pepper. To the onion & mushrooms saute added fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt. To the soup I added a good dollop of sour cream & a good splash of white wine before I poured it over the chops. If I had green pepper would have added it also.

I gave this recipe 4 stars since I modified it to include ingredients that I had on hand. I used thin sliced bone-in pork chops (next time I'll cut the bones out). I seasoned the chops before putting them in a skillet heated on medium with some olive oil. While the chops browned I minced some garlic (1 clove) and then sliced the mushrooms. I sautéed the garlic after I removed the chops and then deglazed the pan with some chicken broth. I added a can of golden pork gravy rather than cream of mushroom soup, and then added the mushrooms. I let that simmer for a few minutes while I got the rest of dinner ready. I added the chops back to the pan, covered it and let it simmer for 15 minutes. I served this with stuffing, fresh steamed baby carrots and broccoli. The chops were so tender, even though they were thin, and the gravy was perfect served over the stuffing. My b/f didn’t like the mushrooms so he picked them out, oh well. I really enjoyed this meal, and will make it again. Thanks mmcgee!!!

This recipe is very easy and tastes great. I took the advise of others and baked it in the oven instead of over the pan. I could have used more spice and seasoning, but the guys ate it up and stuffed it in. Almost feel bad for taking the praise for such an easy meal...almost.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. I felt it was way too bland. The only part of it I modified was 1.Sauteeing the onions and mushrooms before adding soup 2.I used Healthy Request by Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup which was a reduced sodium version of regular cream of mushroom and 3.Added 1/2 cup of milk to soup, as other members suggested. I seasoned the chops before browning, used garlic when browning, and cooked the chops which were thick for the 1 hour. Well the chops were a little overcooked and totally bland. I wonder if adding the milk and using reduced sodium soup made the difference..who knows. :(

I had to modify this recipe to what ingredients I had on hand, but it was a terrific starting off point.  I used 2 large pork shouler steaks instead of the 4 pork chops, granulated garlic instead of garlic salt, 1 can of mushrooms insead of the 1/2 lb of fresh, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom.  I wasn't trying to create a new recipe, just trying to use what I had on hand.  I ended up adding the onion and can of mushrooms (with the water) to saute and cooked until the water was evaporated and the onions started browning (for good flavor).  This turned out delicious and we served it over rice.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious. I added 1 cup milk to the cream of mushroom soup. This recipe is very quick and great for people on a tight budget.

This was a good basic recipe. There are several other recipes very similiar to this one, but this is one of the better. The sauce turned out great. Make sure not to overcook the chops though!

Very good cold weather comfort food. My husband wanted me to find a recipe close to one his mother used to make & I think this is it.  I deglazed the pan with a 1/2 cup of white wine and served over noodles.  Quick, easy and tender!

This was my first time cooking pork chops (I'm a vegetarian cooking for a meat eater!) and I thought the recipe was easy to use and the feedback was that it turned out great. I took the advice of others and browned the meat in the skillet and then baked it with the soup/milk/mushrooms/onions over top. The "gravy" turned out great and he said it was very flavorful, considering it was basic ingredients.

This was really delicious but it was a bit too "mushroomy" according to my husband... but then again he cleaned his plate so thats a good sign!  Easy to prepare & if you love mushrooms then this is a great recipe for you.

This recipe was good.  I didn't do exactly as follows but did follow alot of the comments and added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup white wine, mixed that together with the soup and extra mushrooms.  Poured the mixture over the pork chops in a pan; then baked at 350 degrees, covered with foil for an hour.

Great easy weeknight meal. I'm not a fan of Mushrooms, (hubby loves em) but I didn't hate them in this...used sliced portabellas. Also added 1/2 cup of white wine...makes all the difference!

This is great.  The only change I made was that I added 1/2 cup milk.  My husband and I really enjoyed this, but felt it 'needed something' as most recipes do, to be made to your own taste.  I may try adding some white wine and extra spices next time - I will also try putting it in the oven instead of on the stove.  The sauce tasted amazing with egg noodles!!

Made this tonight and it was yummy!  Didn't have any onions so left those out (would be great in this!) and added a half can of milk to stretch the gravy a little more, cooked in skillet over egg noodles.  Very good!  (and SUPER EASY!)  Will make again with potatoes

This was excellent.  My husband usually only likes his pork chops with stuffing, and suggested this again!  He doesn't usually ask me to print out the recipe.  
I did saute' the onions first and then added them after the chops were sauteed.  Give this recipe a try!

Excellent! Quick and easy with a great outcome. My chops were super thick so had to cook for about 45 mins. Added a little butter to saute the mushrooms and onions. Goes great with peas and rice.

Delicious recipe!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked the pork chops in a can of mushroom soup with 1/2 can of milk.  It makes a nice gravy with potatoes or rice!

This turned out great, even the kids liked it. I made it with mushroom rice and it was a hit. (mushroom rice= 1 can cream of mushroom soup,made as usual then after it cooks add 2 cans minute rice and let sit about 3-5 mins.)

Super simple to make and very good.  Nothing to fancy, but great for a quick, scruptious meal.

This was one of the better pork chop recipes I have tried in a while.  The entire family rated it a 5.... I made it with FF mushroom soup so that we wouldn't feel so guilty about putting the gravy on top of mashed potatoes, which is a definite must with this recipe!

Followed recipe exactly and it came out a little dry and bland. If I tried it again, would probably have to add more spices and adjust the cooking time.

My husband said this was his favorite pork chop recipe to date.  I really liked it but am not a big pork chop fan.  A great recipe to try!

Nice and easy, very moist and flavorful.  This is a really good after work dish.  Rice would be the perfect side dish because there is plenty of the mushroomy sauce.

Delicious. I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to or not, but I added a spoonful of butter to saute the onions and mushrooms.

We thought this recipe was great!  As others suggested, added fresh garlic, a hint of white wine and used one can of Cream of Mushroom and one can of Cream of Chicken.  Served the chops over a bed of long grain white rice cooked with beef stock and crimini mushrooms...quick, easy and very good!

Moist and tasty, simple, nothing stellar.  Good weeknight meal.  You could indeed add herbs or wine for zing; or try a different cream soup (maybe chicken?); or add some extra liquid and then add chopped potatoes or chunked peppers.  The soup stays quite solid when you add it, so don't worry...just turn the chops over again to distribute the soup and it will 'melt' with the heat.  Could be very nice with lamb chops, if they don't get tough (I'm no expert on the timing that would need).

Was very tasty and easy to make. Next time I make it, I will probably try adding the suggested worcestershire, thyme, and wine; but it was wonderful w/out these as well.

This recipe was quick, easy and tasty.  My fiance who is very picky liked it. I did reduce the amount of onion and mushroom to work better with one can of mushroom soup.  Next time I would take other raters suggestions and increase to 2 cans of soup.

This recipe turned out great! I used two cans of cream of chicken with herbs(to add more flavor)since I did not have any cream of mushroom on hand. I aslo added 1/4 cup mik to the soup and 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs 10 minutes after the chops started to simmer to thinken and add more flavor. This was a big hit at my house!

Cooked the chops in a skillet, added half a cup of milk and thinly sliced potatoes. Kids loved them. Thank you for posting.

I made it for the first time tonight. Very good, my family loved it. The pork chops came out tender and juicy. The sauce had a very good taste, I did add alittle sour cream and crushed garlic to the recipe. My husband ,as picky as he is, agreed we should have it again. Thanks for shareing

Excellent!  The only thing I did different was I added 2 cans of the mushroom soup.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was excellent and tasted fantastic! My husband ate the pork first for the first time, and took the leftovers for work.  My kids loved it as well.  I will be making this over and over!!  I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans. YUMMY!!

Absolutely delicious! Big hit with my 6 year old and husband.  I will definitely make it again.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 box approx. 10 oz) fresh mushrooms.  It came out great and this is going to be a regular dish in this family.

I made all of the recommended adjustments, using wine to deglaze the pan, adding extra soup, used fresh mushrooms, added garlic,etc.  It still tasted pretty bland to me.  My husband liked it but I didn't think it was that flavorful.

This was so easy.  I only made it with 2 chops and kept the recipe the same.  I loved the gravy it made.  The extra gravy goes good with mashed potatoes and some warm bread

This is so easy...and so good! (Of course, I do love mushrooms, onions & garlic) So, if that is what you like this is the dish for you! I added an extra can of soup to make more gravy for mashed potatos, & I added some lemon juice to bring out the flavors. I used 6 boneless chops thinly cut...I would only simmer them for 15 minutes next time--they were a little tough at 20 minutes.

Gravy is very tasty. I used 4 small chops which totaled 1 pound. The cooking time is too long for small pieces, next time I would use fatter chops or cook less time. I used green beans instead of onions.

The whole family enjoyed.  The kids and I picked out the mushrooms (preference)and my husband enjoyed them.  Per other reviews, I also used two cans of mushroom soup and 1 can of milk.  Made a nice gravy to go along with the mashed potatoes.  Instead of chopping the onion, I sliced.  (kids could pick out easy and adults enjoyed.)  Thanks

I would change a thing about this recipe, it was wonderful.  I made mash potatos with the pork chops and the gravy over the potatos was fabulous.  I will use this recipe over and over again, it is a total hit with my family!

My first time cooking for the family, and easier than I expected! The only problem is that I had to cook 6 chops, and my skillet only had space to brown 2 effectively, so i browned and sauteed 2 chops in turn, and then put all 6 chops in and poured the mushroom soup over to simmer. As a result, the bottom 2 were kinda over-cooked, and the top 2 were undercooked. My family loved it, though the dish ended up with a slightly burnt smell, but that's probably due to lack of my own cooking skills!

When I went looking for a new way to cook pork chops, I ran across the recipe. this is now a dish that I serve almost weekly.  I did use 2 cans of soup for the extra gravy on the rice or egg noodles. And since i am the only one in te house that likes muchrooms I sauteed them in a seperate pan and added them just to mine.  This is one of the best *****

I only added some white wine (Chardonnay is my favorite white, so it was what got added)  and cracked black pepper- tres fabuloso. I'd give it 5 with these additions.

This was yummy!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as well as two cans of soup.  We did a side of white rice which was delicious with the sauce over it and a side of broccoli.  My husband actually licked the plate clean...literally!

This was the first time ever that I made pork chops.  I served it with white rice and broccoli.  I made it for my mom, dad, my boyfriend, and myself.  It was great!  My boyfriend, who is studying to be a chef, ate it while waiting for the bus and called to say he left not even a grain of rice!  I definitly will make this again.

This was simple to make and very tasty.  My family loved it and there was not much mess to clean up afterwards because there are not that many ingredients.

Wonderful!! My porkchops were really thick, so my cooking time was a bit longer.  I loved the gravy and it was soooo easy. Will be making this again!

The only change i made to the recipe was using 2 cans of soup instead of one and it turned out great.  i was a little skeptical at first because i don't usually have good luck with pork chops in the skillet, but this time it worked!!!  i will definitely be making this again - it was super easy.

This was so easy and great! It's going to be a regular for us now. I modified just a little...I don't like onions so I used onion powder and garlic powder (not salt) along with pepper for the seasoning of the chops. I also used some basil (a great herb to add to about anything!) I did not use any salt. It's really not needed. I also used 2 cans of condensed soup instead of one. Do this because the gravy is so good you'll want plenty! Instead of fresh mushrooms I just used one small can on sliced ones. It's faster and easier and tastes the same. I served it over a bed of white rice and my husband and I both raved about it!

I used boneless country style ribs with this recipe. Wasnt quite as tender as the original. Maybe with additional cooking time? Recommendation- used regular pork chops.

I tried this one with very cheap porkchops. Ya know the tough one's that you need a chainsaw to cut. With this recipe, FANTASTIC! Moist & Tender. It's now a family fav. used the milk tip also.

This is very good.  I've been on the South Beach Diet for a few weeks and have been looking for a pork chop recipe that doesn't require a coating.  I rubbed the pork with pepper, garlic powder and sage before browning. I cooked this the first time with 2 cups of chicken broth (which was a little too much).  This time I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added a little chicken broth to thin it out a bit.  I also added a whole onion but no mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I served with steamed asparagus.

Okay....I really wanted this to be like the recipe I remembered from my childhood.  I was disappointed, it may have been that I used Pork butt chops instead of center cut or boneless.  Everyone else thought it was wonderful...the sauce was incredible.  I will make this again, only next time I will use good pork chops.

Divine! I LOVED this! I wanted to lick the plate clean! Tender, and just awesome! Watch out for the mushrooms, they do stick to the pan easy and burn. But even so, its AWESOME! A new favorite. Going to try it later this week with chicken :)

I added 1/2 Cup milk and served over fluffy white rice. Made it in a covered frying pan and it was still tender enough for my 20 month old to down like no tomorrow! Husband and I both liked it too! Very good, very fast!

This was okay but not as good as I thought it would be. Next time I will try using some milk like another reviewer suggested to make the sauce go further, because it did not last long for my family.

it was super easy and really yummy, but it was a little too salty for my liking, but i added a little hot water and it worked out. dont let the mushrooms stick to the bottom of the pan while simmering because they get burnt, that;s what happened with some of mine. but overall, super fun to make and reallllly awesome!!

This recipe is very easy.  I used boneless porkchops, seasoned them with onion powder, garlic powder, and celery salt.  Then browned them in vegetable oil.  Drain porkchops, I used a small can of mushrooms and water.  Using the mushroom can, fill with water.  Then I only simmered everything for 10 min.

Great recipe! I followed others' advice and sauteed the mushrooms in some white wine, then added the soup. I seasoned and grilled the chops separately on the Foreman and still turned out nice and juicy.

This was delicious. I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt and a small can of mushroom pieces, drained in place of the fresh mushrooms (since I didn't have any fresh ones on hand). I think baking at 350* would probably be better than stove top cooking though.

I found and tried this recipe tonite for dinner. It was unbelievably easy to make, and just as equally delicious. My boyfriend loved it, and raved with every bite. Will definitely be making again. (P.S. I did not alter the recipe at all, it was perfect as is!)

i thought this was "ok" but my husband loved it.  i took another's advice and added 1/2 c. sherry and a little milk to thin it out.  i also added some basil and thyme and spice it up a bit.  next time will add more as it was pretty bland to me.  i served over brown and white rice. even the kids ate it!  i will make this again!

Everyone loved it.  I added a little more liquid and soup, so more sauce was yielded.  This was good because I served the pork chops with pasta and peas and that sauce was very good over everything.  No leftovers!  The Garlic Salt really made a difference in my opinion.

This recipe was very good for a nice quick and easy dinner!  I used boneless pork chops (trimmed all the fat) so I used a couple teaspoons of olive oil while browning.  I used garlic powder, salt and pepper and rubbed it on the chops before browning.  I simmered for 30 min., but next time I will do like 22-24 min. because they were slightly tough.  Served over plain white rice because the mushroom soup/real mushrooms/onions on top gave the white rice an excellent flavor.  Will definitely make again and try a few differnt spices to jazz these up a bit.  Overall, it was a great quick recipe.

This was a quick meal and the whole family enjoyed it. I did add about a 1/4 cup of Sherry to the gravy before simmering and it seemed to complete the flavor.  Will be using this one again, thank you.

This is a wonderful recipe. It gave a great flavor to the chops.  I used 1/2" cut chops, and 30 minutes was a bit too done.  I think next time I'll try a thicker cut. This is a definate keeper!

This is one of the few dishes that I didn't alter the recipe in some way first. After cooking it for the recommended time, I checked the pork chops and found they needed to be cooked more. I then had to add more salt, pepper, and garlic and cooked it for an additional 30-45 minutes to get it tender. The dish was pretty good....I liked it better than my husband did. He didn't go back for seconds, which is unusual.

The sauce is good on this.  I only gave it three stars because the pork chops were dry and tough, but I don't have good luck with pork chops.  I'll try this again with a different cut of pork chop.

I guess this is really a matter of personal preference, but I didn't care for this recipe with pork ... perhaps we would have like it better had I used chicken or beef.  The pork and creamy mushroom combination just didn't suit us.

AMAZING!  I'm someone who loves to cook and couldn't believe that something this simple could turn out so wonderful...but this did!  My husband is definitely not a pork chop lover - but ate 3 helpings of this one!  Served over rice, this is crazy good!

This was certainly easy to make and I liked the fact that it required so few ingredients. Unfortunately I must have used the wrong cut of chops. They came out dry and not very tender at all. The flavor was good though.

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I served it with scalloped potatoes but think that the dish would have gone better with rice.  I agree with other reviewers that less onion would work but the amount suggested makes for some extra gravy.  This was well-received when I served it for dinner.

An excellent dinner!  We served ours over egg noodles.  I only added about half of the mushrooms needed (since that's all I had) and I did add an entire onion.  Although it was still delicious, next time I will add a full 1/2 lb. of mushrooms or cut down on the onion a bit.  Loved it though!

Instead of the mushroom soup I used the Golden Mushroom Soup and added 1/2 to 3/4 can of water and just salt and pepper for seasonings. Double the soup and you have an excellent gravy.  I bake this in the oven for at least an hour or more at 350. I never get any negative comments on this one!

This was horrible. I tried cooking it with wine the first time YUCK!!!!!!!.  Then I cooked exactly like the recipe called for. That was a different taste but still horrible.

Very good.  It is not mind blowing but it was about as easy as it gets and very tasty.  I threw a little garlic in when I browned the chops.
