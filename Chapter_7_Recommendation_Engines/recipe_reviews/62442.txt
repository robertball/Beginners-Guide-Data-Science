**REVISING MY ORIGINAL REVIEW**.  
We still 100% love this recipe, BUT BUT BUT... I decided to try ELLIEGIRL1's tips of using Nori (roasted seaweed) instead of spinach (as I have done in the past),and grated fresh ginger (I grated it into the cooled rice). These two ingredients put this recipe clear over the TOP and then some (Wish I could give it more stars)!  TY TY TY for posting the Nori use! For a potluck dish that has to travel, a dish you want to make several hours ahead, or a salad that has to wait awhile to be served we still nix the lettuce. Nori and Wasabi paste can be found in the ethnic area of most grocery stores. 

Original review-
A TOTAL POTLUCK HIT !! WOW! If you like traditional California Roll sushi you will love this for a change! I have made this several times, but have evolved to totally nixing the lettuce as it tends to get way too limp for our taste! Now, it's just rice, avocado, fake crab, cuke, and I add steamed spinach. Amounts are too your taste.  I make the dressing exactly as directed. I now use this dressing on fish, and numerous other things. IT'S THE BEST! I will make this again and again.

A great idea for someone who loves california rolls without the fuss of sushi rice and rolling at home! I used a bit of dry sherry and white wine vinegar in place of rice vinegar. Wasabi paste (1tsp) added some grated ginger to the dressing, crumbled Nori papers and topped it with toasted sesame seeds!

This sald was really great as a main dish on a hot summer's day.  We added a bit more wasabi, since we like things spicy, and we cut down on the rice.  If you like California sishi rolls, you'll like this salad.  Next time will try a bit of sake in the dressing.

Being of Asian descent, I've eaten lots of traditional sushi rolls so I had my doubts about how this salad would compare. Was I pleasantly surprised – it tasted like the real thing without the time consuming work of making and slicing the rolls… easy and delicious! I used romaine lettuce so I didn’t have a problem with soggy lettuce… or maybe it was because we finished the salad before the lettuce had time to wilt. I used wasabi paste and tried to stir the ingredients for the dressing with a fork but the mayo wouldn’t combine with everything else so I put everything in a small jar and shook it all up. Great recipe!!!

Great new salad!  I changed things and took suggestions from others... I used Romaine lettuce, put sesame seeds in the dressing, and since I didn't have wasabi powder, I used wasabi paste instead.  I also used either basmati or long grain rice, since japanese rice or short grain can be too sticky to use.  I put nori strips on top and fried wonton strips.
Definitely a salad I would bring to a potluck to bring something different.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted just like a Calf. Roll.  I did use the iceberg lettuce, but cut into chunks and added seaweed strips to the top just before serving.   I did double the dressing and added ginger to the rice.  This was so different and delicious.  I am craving it now.

I nixed the rice and just made a regular lettuce salad instead. The dressing is really good; I make it often and keep it in the fridge to have on weeknights. I served this at a party and so many people came up to me to rave about the dressing. Highly recommended.

Nothing spectacular, but a nice light summer salad (as a main dish, not a side one).  The lettuce WILL go limp if made in advance, so I advice either dressing it at the last minute, or tossing in the lettuce at the last minute.  Toasted, shredded nori sprinkled on top just before serving gave it real oomph and more of that California Roll flavour.

This was really good.  I'm doing a low-carb thing right now (just like the rest of the country) so I left out the rice.  The wasabi powder doesn't come through (no heat) I have wasabi paste so I'm going to try it with the paste.  Thank you for posting this recipe I will make it too many times for anyone to ever count!

I was impressed by how much like a California Roll this salad tasted like!  If serving as a side dish, this makes way more than 6 servings.  Simple, tasty and refreshing, thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! This salad will definitely help to curb your sushi craving if you can't get to a Japanese restaurant. We grew up in large cities with lots of great sushi places but now live in rural New Mexico, where there is no sushi at all. So we make this every time we have the urge! There are a few things I would suggest to improve the ease and taste: 1. We don't add the lettuce leaves, we just make it a rice, veggie and surimi salad. 2. We always add about a teaspoon each of black and toasted white sesame seeds for a pretty and tasty touch. 3. According to your taste, matchstick carrots are another nice touch for added color and flavor. You won't be disappointed with this dish if you like California rolls!

I was a little worried about this recipe after some of the more recent reviews, but it is excellent. Made exactly as is, but topped it with some toasted nori and used wasabi paste rather than powder. As in any other salad, it's best to eat it right after its been tossed with the dressing, which we did. It was absolutely awesome and will have a heavy rotation at our house.

While this had a different and interesting taste I felt like the rice and avocado got lost in the salad. Hubby liked it but I probably won't make it again.

I love making sushi at home (anything without the raw fish).  This dish is fantastic.  I did take someone else's suggestion and substituted the lettuce for a sheet of shredded nori I mixed in.  Any one who loves sushi or one of those rice bowls restaurants serve (chirashi) would really like this.

I think this is one of my favorite finds on this site, for many reasons.  It tastes very good, it's something different from our usual potato or macaroni salad.  And I thought the light green cucumbers and avocado mixed with the salmony pink color of the crab looked really pretty, very spring like.  I added toasted sesame seeds on top and omitted the lettuce.  Somehow I miscalculated the amount of rice so I was low on that ingredient, but other than that I followed the recipe.

I still can't believe how good this was! I cooked 1 cup rice in the pressure cooker with 1 and half cups water. After it cooled slightly, I added a generous tablespoon of rice vinegar. I didn't have lettuce, avocado or crabmeat so I used a 7oz can of skinless, boneless salmon, one carrot grated and one cucumber. The dressing really was phenomenal. I added a little ginger powder to the rice and dressing and reduced the wasabi powder to 1 tsp (for my toddlers). I had 4 sheets of nori left over so I tore it up and mixed it in. This was fast easy and inexpensive since I was using up stuff. Next time I make this I'll add toasted sesame seeds. Thank you for a great recipe to build upon!

Wow, this is really, really good!  Because of the dressing, it really does taste like a sushi roll.  The only ingredient I added were sesame seeds.  Next time, I'll double the dressing and make it a bit more "wasabi-y" since we like a lot of wasabi on our sashimi.  We weren't able to eat the whole thing, and I know tomorrow it's going to be soggy.  We'll probably just pick out the crab and avocado for lunch tomorrow.  Delicious salad!  Thanks, Tara.

Really good.  I had to sub cider vinegar because I only had seasoned rice vinegar, but it worked out fine.  Next time I'll make it as written.

Yum, yum, and yum.  This is such a great idea! I only had red leaf lettuce so used about 1/2 head of that.  I sliced up some nori and grated some fresh ginger as well.  I only used 1 tsp mayo, and I had wasabi paste, only used 1 tsp as well.  It was wonderful! The only thing is I think we were missing that pickled ginger taste so I may add that the next time! It could do with a little more rice too I think.  But 5 stars for the idea alone! Genius.

This was SOOOO good.  I surprised my husband with it last night and when I brought it to him, he says 'WOW whats this - this smells like Sakora's (sp?)'.  We loved it.  I did not use the lettuce, but did put in about three leafs of shredded romaine; added two crumbled seaweed rolls, lots of toasted sesame seeds, and grated ginger. I also doubled the sauce,but did not use as much vinegar as called for.   I did not have the powder and used a Wasabi Sauce I had, but it needed more hotness, so then we both individually added more real wasabi and a little salt to bring out all the flavors.  Without the lettuce, it will not feed 6 more like 3 or 4 small eaters; so just be careful if you do not add the lettuce - allow for less servings.    I would add more rice, just to make it stretch for more servings.  But the flavor was wonderful.   I had a very small bowl left over for lunch today and it was good.  I think that without lettuce it was fine to serve the next day.  Thank You for ths great recipe.

This was FANTASTIC!  We made this with nori strips instead of lettuce and added 3/4 cup of edamame.  Will be making it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM, LOVE THIS! I did as others and used seaweed in place of the lettuce (I found a sesame oil roasted seaweed @ the grocery store), and that went perfectly. I only had 1 avocado, so that's all I used and I cut everything into small chunks just because. The dressing is wonderful and compliments the salad nicely. This really does taste like a California Roll!!!! This is gonna be a new salad staple @ our house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a great salad and such a nice change of pace.  I didn't particularly care for the dressing *until* I tasted the salad - the rice absorbs the flavors beatifully.  Making do with what I had (grin), I used romain and napa cabbage for my greens and then thinly sliced some leftover s&s chicken and tossed that on top.  Perfect! Note to self: decrease sesame oil to 1/2 t, wasabe to 1 1/2, add 1 additional T mayo.

This was a great and easy salad! Finally, I can enjoy CA rolls without the work! I used way more rice than it called for: about 2 cups sushi rice. I will also cut back on the sugar a smidge next time. Other than that I will be making this a lot! Thanks!

Awesome Recipe. I added a teaspoon more of mayo and teaspoon of Sriracha sauce to the dressing. I received rave reviews at a cookout.  I think next time I will substitute brown rice.

Great salad!  My boyfriend and I loved this dish!  We made the following additions:  dried nori strips, sesame seeds and flying fish roe.  This tastes just like a california roll.  The salad dressing really does the trick.  Great for a picnics and potlucks!

Pretty darn good for when I'm too lazy to make the sushi rolls! The taste and texture is the same, just not in neat little packages.

This is one of my favorite salads.  It is so easy, different  and tasty.  I use the wasabi paste in a tube from the oriental food aisle or sometimes by the fresh salad section.  I also add some sugared ginger sprinkled on top, and some grated ginger in the dressing.  Sushi is all about the ginger for me!  I usually don't mix in the lettuce, but put the salad on a bed of lettuce for people to take if they want.  I also tried adding the sushi seaweed sheets chopped up and mixed in- did not like it  at all.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it did tast like a California roll, but I preferred it with more rice and an extra dollop of soy sauce just before I ate it. (since I like to dunk my roll in soy sauce before eating)

Tastes JUST LIKE a california roll! This makes a HUGE batch. We ate it for a few days, and then I was pretty sick of eating california rolls! Overall - great alternative to making actual sushi. I added edamame beans, nori sheets, and extra wasabi. yum.

Great idea to satisfy the sushi cravings! I agree with the previous reviewers: lettuce is optional but you definitely need shredded nori and pickled ginger to get the true sushi taste!

This was very good. I used romaine lettuce and added pickled ginger and crumbled nori, and I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds over the top. The ginger really added to the "sushi" flavor. Even though I added about 1 tsp more wasabi than the recipe called for, it still didn't have the kick  I like, so next time I'll add more. I may try using olive oil or mashed avocado instead of the mayo for the dressing, just because I don't like to use mayo (or any of its vegan counterparts).

10.12.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/62442/california-roll-salad/ ... As suggested, I skipped the lettuce; but otherwise followed.  Yum.  I had my doubts.  How could it ...? It does.  I used the full 2t wasabi &, while it wasn't super hot, it detracted from the other flavors.  I'll use 1 1/4 - 1 1/2t next time.  Second day, it got watery even using an English cuc.  Very surprised the avocado didn't turn, but it was fine.  Suggestion:  Be sure your avocado is ripe & firm - not "guacamole ready".  It still tasted fine, but using both too soft avocado & 2t wasabi, it was that color (not so pretty anymore). How great is it that the package of imitation crab has four cups - two recipes of this?!  Great, I say!  :D  :)

What a clever salad! You can enjoy the flavor of Californina Rolls without the work! I followed the recipe exactly and used the nori instead of lettuce adding about 1/3 cup pre-cut nori strips. I would make this again but I would use half the Sesame Oil in the dressing. Thought it was a bit overpowering but that could be a personal thing.

This really tastes like California rolls! I left out the lettuce and only used 1 avocado. I did not use wasabi powder because I wanted my kids to eat it too. As suggested by others, I shredded dried seaweed (available at Asian market) and it really helped tie everything together

This was so much easier than making sushi -  and tasted just as good.  I used brown rice and increased the amount.  I left out the lettuce, but added ginger, sesame seeds, and strips of seaweed.

Wow this salad is great!  I do change it up a bit - I leave out any type of lettuce so that I can bring this dish to a potluck without worrying about wilting. I follow the dressing directions exactly and it is wonderful! I add some shredded nori (toasted seaweed) and toasted sesame seeds to the mix to give it even more of a "California Roll" taste. This is always a big hit whenever I bring it anywhere!

There is a good concept in this salad-just not as written (for me anyway). Maybe I'm just not a fan of rice-based salads, or maybe there was too much rice and not enough salad; but for some reason the rice just overpowered the salad. The dressing is delicious, and I would double next time so I had some to pour on before and during serving. Will try again, but am feeling the need to tinker with this a bit to make it something I'll love eating.

Excellent!  Be careful with the wasabi...you can always add more, but darn hard to 'dilute' once its added. This is a wonderful recipe; easy, fast, tasty! Perfect for my 12y.o. niece to make for her friends when they come over to do 'girl stuff' and have a sleep-over!

This was really tasty. I added some shredded up nori as others have recommended and added a bit more mayo to the dressing to make it a bit creamier. I also used fat free mayo. This was a delicious dish along side a chicken breast on very warm evening.

I followed everyone else's suggestion about the nori strips which really gave it a more "authentic" roll flavor.  The dressing was fabulous!  I could have drank it LOL.  I chopped everything and left in bowls and we assembled the salad to our liking.  Shrimp, faux crab, mango, macadamian nuts, avocado, nori strips, rice, and the dressing.  It was fabulous!

This is fantastic!  I omitted lettuce and added roasted seaweed (nori)instead.  My husband said this might be better than my hand rolls and that's saying a lot!  We LOVE california rolls and I often make california hand rolls at home with roe.  But I didn't add any roe to the salad but next time I think I will.  This is sooooo good, thank you.

This was very, very good.  I used red leaf lettuce instead of the iceburg, and added nori strips as others suggested.  My husband used to work in a sushi bar a long time ago, and he said the flavor was very close to a California roll.  I served it with Thai Chicken Tenders, and the salad was the best part of the meal by far.  Thanks for the post!

This was wonderful.  Used nori strips as others had suggested and only 1/2 of an extremely large english cucumber. Good use for leftover rice too.  This will be a regular lunch item for us.

My 11yo daughter and I are having this salad right now, and it's just wonderful. We omitted the lettuce and added strips of nori as suggested. It looks beautiful and tastes almost exactly like a Cali roll, just a little more moist. Thanks for a simply delicious recipe!

This was so much better than expected.  I'm not a huge imitation crab fan, so I was really hesitant, but this came out great.  Definitely should substitute nori strips for lettuce as they really tie the dish together.  I also doubled the rice to make it a main dish.  Toasted white and black sesame seeds make a great garnish.

I loved this recipe... such an original idea.  I omitted the lettuce, as I expected a bit of leftovers.  I also made a 3-egg omelet and cut it into small strips to add to the salad, along with 3/4 cup of shredded carrots and 2 tbsp of sesame seeds.  I served the salad with extra dressing and nori sheets cut into 3" x 3" squares.  We put spoonsfuls of the salad onto the nori squares and added a little dressing which makes for a big delicious mouthful... just like sushi!  I got GREAT feedback.  Thanks for this wonderful idea, as I am sure I will make this at least once or twice a month.

I did not like the idea of lettuce to this salad, so I did not use it. Great for satisfying a sushi craving and easier to do. Definitely add some thin nori strips. It really looks cool in the salad. I wasn't sure about the mayo but ended up liking it. I did have to double the amount of wasabi to give it the kick I felt it needed. I like to add edamame, and the color looks great too. Sometimes I use pickled ginger, but have found some people are picky about it. Overall a good salad that can have lots of variations, depending on what you have. Works great with cooked shrimp too.

Whoever thought of a California Roll Salad is a COMPLETE GENIUS!!!  A perfect combination, I must say.  I omitted the imitation crab since I didn't have any on me and I substituted baby greens for the iceberg lettuce.  Still pretty good.  I could even eat it without the rice!  Delicious!  The dressing was phenomenal.

Definitely a hit with my family! Didn’t use lettuce and decreased the wasabi powder to 1 tsp. Topped the salad with sesame roasted nori and sesame seeds.

What a fabulous salad! I added two carrots, peeled into strips, for color and crunch. I didn't have wasabi sauce or paste; I used a few drops of hot sauce instead. This was a great, light supper.

I was looking for the dressing recipe and tried this one.  It's actually quite yummy but way sour.  so I reduced the amount of vinegar to 1TBS instead of 1/4 cup.  Way better!

This is outstanding! I used brown rice, pickled ginger and nori crumbled over, toasted sesame seeds, wasabi paste with a head of red lettuce after reading all the review suggestions.  
This was perfect!! My husband was so impressed. Truly tastes like a California Roll. Loved it!

Thank you for an amazing and easy recipe!  It tastes just like the rolls without the extra work.  I used wasabi paste because it's what's readily available at the store.  It is a five star recipe as is.  However, after making it, I went through the reviews (usually I review first then try the recipe) and there are some good ideas, grated ginger, sprinkling sesame seeds and the nori vs lettuce debate.  I'll give some of these ideas a go but if you decide to try as is, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks Tara for such a wonderful, fresh recipe that gives us the California roll taste without the extra work.

We love this recipe. We skipped the lettuce and just crumbled up some sheets of nori and mixed it in. You could also probably just scoop it into nori cones if you wanted a "lazy" roll.

Hard to rate this recipe.   We loved the crab and rice part (I made actual sushi rice), but the dressing was really not good.  It could have been my wasabi powder but it was really bitter.

If only for the dressing, (I made many substitutions to the basic salad due to the ingredients I had on hand), this recipe is 5 stars! What a great substitution to regular old salad!  I was very skeptical of the rice, but it added a great touch. Also, used shrimp from the freezer in place of the . Yumalicious !

I made half the recipe for the two of us and we scarfed the whole thing. I served it with grilled corn and Grilled Asian Chicken from this site. With or without lettuce this salad is a keeper! I did grate a bit of ginger into the dressing and garnished with sesame seeds and nori as ELLIEGIRL1 suggested. I'm going to make the full 6 servings next week and serve it as lunch for two. I'll bet there won't be much in the way of leftovers.

Will use slightly less vinegar next time, maybe a bit more soy sauce. Otherwise loved it! Definitely needs the shredded nori and sesame seeds for authentic California roll taste, and Japanese mayo tastes better than regular mayo in this recipe. Thanks for sharing! Great idea :)

As is, with no changes to the recipe, I thought this was just ok (I noticed a lot of other reviews gave it a higher rating, but with changes). Too much vinegar for my taste, especially after it  had marinated in the fridge overnight. I ate some of the leftovers the next day and the acid was intense. I'd add more rice if I were to make it again, maybe more sugar/mayo. Definitely didn't fix my sushi craving.

wow these DID taste just like california rolls.. we totally loved it.. halved the sugar.. used wasabi paste instead of powder and upped the soy, mayo, and sesame oil to compensate.. ate these alongside fried wontons.. ty so much for the recipe!  ~~UPDATE: this time we omitted the lettuce and sugar, used cured salmon for the crabmeat, still used the wasabi paste and eyeballed the measurements with the mayo, soy, vinegar, and sesame oil.. SO SO good! ~~UPDATE#2: this also works well with cauliflower "rice" wrapped up in nori sheets.. i SO love this recipe!

OMG this was incredible! The only thing I did different was to use Kikkoman Wasabi Sauce in place of the wasabi powder (could not find the powder in the store). I ate 3 platefuls! My husband was lucky I didn't eat more, I really could have eaten the entire bowl without his help. Definite keeper!

This was everything I hoped it would be and then some! Delicious! It absolutely satisfied my craving for sushi. I used only half of the wasabi powder and I could not even really taste it. Next time, I will use the full amount. I also shredded up one sheet of Nori seaweed and it added an authenticity that I think I would have missed if I left it out. Thank you so much for this great recipe--this is a perfect summer time supper. We will be making it again, for sure!

Addicted.  Really, I can't leave it alone after I've made it, and I've taken it to potlucks and it seems to have the same affect on others.  I have subsequently tweaked a couple things (substitutions if I was out of something), but the original is the best.  Thanks!

So this is not a good dish to bring to potlucks. It is delish and was a hit but in my opinion it is probably alot better when prepared and eatten right away. By the end of the day the bottom of the container was full of liquid so the chance of leftovers is not happening. I made this dish last night but didn't add the romaine until right before I left for work this morning. I right away knew this dish was not going to keep for long as it got alittle mushy. Again big hit and I'm being critical because I love to cook and no how to cook so everything is taste and presentation to me. Overall great dish just again I would not advise work functions or anything that requires this dish to sit for a period of time.

This is a great idea.  I really like the sushi roll flavor.  However, if you pour the dressing over the entire salad including the rice it looses something.  I liked it best with the dressing was on the greens and the rice was just dolloped on top.  That being said, this is a great recipe with lots of potential.

I really wanted to enjoy this as I love California rolls. Unfortunately, while the flavors in the original were mimicked relatively well, it's better suited to an actual sushi roll. I think the mayonnaise may have been my least favorite addition.

After reading all of the great reviews I was really excited about trying this one.  Unfortunately, I walked away disappointed. The salad tasted very bland and did not have anywhere close to enough dressing.  I'd recommend using a different recipe or adding a few more ingredients to it.

My whole family thought this was amazing!  It tastes just like the real thing!  My teen daughter took the leftovers to school for lunch the next day and is requesting that I make it again soon.

My husband and I both love California rolls and although this DOES taste like a California roll, somehow it just seemed strange to us to eat them in a salad form (maybe it was the lettuce?). My husband only managed 2 bites.... So for us despite the great reviews we won't be trying it again.

I was looking for a recipe for California Rolls and found this.  Wonderful salad.  The seasonings can be adjusted to make it more or less spicy.  California Roll in a bowl!

This salad was very original and really does taste like a California Roll...which is exactly what I was craving!  I found wasabi powder with the spices and used the flake style crab.  EDIT: The salad is much better right after making and doesn't taste near as good the next day.

Though I liked the base combination, I had serious reservations when I tasted the dressing before adding.  It tasted too vinegary, but I was reluctant to add anything until I tried it on the salad itself.  So rather than tossing the entire salad with it, I did individual portions.  The over-acidity of the dressing almost vanished completely when it was on the base; it's the combination that makes this recipe nice.  I wouldn't call it amazing, though my daughter loved it.  But it certainly made a nice change.  I used romaine instead of iceberg, and seaweed for a little more authenticity.

Oh wow!  I love California rolls and crave them often.  This recipe is so easy and way cheaper than running out 3 times a week to get them and tastes exactly (if not better) than the real thing.  I did add a little crushed up Nori (seaweed) and to be honest I never got around to making the dressing at all, just used a little soy sauce as a dressing.  Yum!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

Not bad. In place of the lettuce, I used Nori strips, but that was the only change I made. My coworkers weren't too crazy about it, but I thought it was alright. It was fun to try something different, thanks.

This is a winner! I changed a couple things and think this dish is fantastic.  I didn't use any lettuce at all.  I wanted to use the seaweed but my local store didn't have any so I substituted some prepared seaweed salad.  I actually think this is what made the dish, it added almost all of the flavor before any dressing was used. I winged the dressing, added seasame seeds and just tinkering with it until it tasted the way I wanted, I didn't have any wasabi but I could have went either way using it or not. I cooked my rice in my rice cooker and threw some in the fridge to cool, very important, use cool rice only. I will definitely make this time and time again.

I made this with another recipe from this site. "Asian fire meat".  It was really good.  Tossed dressing with each individual serving.  I halved the recipe and it still made way way much salad. What a original idea.  Thanks

Great summer salad.  Left out the lettuce, added extra mayo and rice wine vinegar.  Then as a finishing touch I added some Mexican hot sauce called Tapatio, (any hot sauce will do), yum!  With 3 inch nori squares on the side to make tiny rolls, it tasted just like a California roll.  Will definitely make again for my sushi loving son.

I found this recipe to be more of a starting point than anything else. I eliminated the rice and added chopped sugar snap peas and shredded carrots to add some color and some more variety to the veggies. I found the dressing quite bland as it was. Next time I make it I think I'll add some garlic and ginger, and possibly some more wasabi.

Loved it! Quick & easy.  Satisfies a craving, light, but filling.  I used the brown rice, baby romaine and prepared wasabi, but stuck to the recipe otherwise.

This is an AMAZING salad. The lettuce does get soggy after a bit, but if you put the dressing on right before serving i'ts fine. I couldn't taste the wasabi at all so I just leave it out.

My husbands likes sushi, but doesn't like salad - and he loved this.  It's very adaptable...I didn't having ginger or wasabi and it still turned out great.  I added scallions for a little bit of an onion flavor (not in sushi, I know, but it tasted great with the avocado).  It's very FILLING, too, so it's great for a healthy summer meal.
