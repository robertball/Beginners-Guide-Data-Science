This bread was SO easy to make and it turned out great. Never knew I could make such tasty bread in the microwave.

I never thought you could even make bread in the microwave. These were really good. Tasted just like english muffins.

Excellent bread from a m/w oven. I used 1 tsp. of the yeast that is added with the
dry ingredients. Thank you for posting this recipe.

The flavor of this loaf is pretty insipid, even when toasted.  The dough was also quite sticky and needed about an extra half cup of flour to be able to be handled easily, while still remaining relatively soft. Generally, the proportion of liquid to 3 cups of flour in a bread recipe is 1 cup, not 1-1/4 cups. The taste is definitely dominated by whole wheat, and as such, it didn't taste to us remotely like English muffins. Flavor-wise, it lacks salt, but adding more might inhibit the dough's ability to rise, so do so judiciously. The grain is too close and fine to resemble English muffins. None of the requisite "nooks and crannies" associated with them. The rising technique was definitely cool, however. I'll remember it when I need to get my yeast breads to rise in a hurry. Since my microwave is pretty powerful, I used 40% power for the rise stage, and even so, only had to give it the 1 minute/10 minute wait twice before it rose to 2" above the pan. Interesting premise, but flavor is decidedly lackluster.

My wife has made this recipe for years.  It is always in our frige.  It makes the BEST garlic bread, french toast, grilled sandwiches, croutons, or just toast and jelly/peanut butter.  It's also great with ham/egg/mock Hollandaise - easy eggs benedict.

I used these directions to make Amish White Bread (from this website) in the microwave.  I dried out the bread overnight and made homemade Panko breadcrumbs.  Thanks for the great instructions.

It tastes like bread. Really. Great quick snack for the kids, and a good preschool project. Instant gratification.

made this with whole wheat pastry flour.  Used wheat bran for the corn meal since I didn't have any.  I don't know how much I would say this was like english muffins, but it was definitely good and definitely easy.

Simple and tasty!!! It tasted a little like steamed buns (I've never had english muffins before so I can't compare to that). It was a little denser than normal bread, though. First time I got compliments on a bread recipe! Thanks for posting!

Thomas's English muffins move over!  This is so simple and the results are great.  I have an 1100 watt microwave, so I had to adjust the time and power levels a bit.  I settled on 1 minute at 30% for the rise and 2 minutes at 70% followed by 3 minutes at 60%.  This gave me the cooked top and nice moist bread, but I do think I will add 30-45 seconds to the 60% time.  Nice job Larry, thanks for sharing.

Well, I have to say, I am so pleasantly surprised by this bread.  It was so easy, relatively healthy (I used skim milk) and delicious to boot!  I did 3 cycles, one on 50%, one on 40%, last on 50% in a 1000 watt overn.  I did let it rest 10 minutes between those nukes.  Then I let it bake for 6 minutes at 100% and it came out so nice.  Slices very nicely and toasted up perfect.  Thank you for this great recipe, I had no idea you could bake bread in the microwave.  Can't wait to try this in the summer when you don't want to heat up the oven but would like a good loaf of homemade bread.  Thanks again!

I agree that the flavour of this bread is not that great but the technique is awesome! A very decent loaf of bread in under an hour?!  That alone deserves all the raves that this recipe is not getting... Next time I will be putting some cinnamon and possibly raisins into the dough. Maybe use some molasses too!

Made it for the first time, and my kids loved it - it doesn't have a hard crust like bread machine bread, and at their age (3 & 4) that's a plus. To me - no, it's not as great as home made bread I make in the oven, but then again, if I had time for that, I wouldn't be looking for microwave recipes. It does resemble steamed bread or dumplings as someone else wrote, so it could be used instead of those - way easier to make than steaming!
Also, here is what I did with 1400 Watt microwave: 
To rise: 1 min on 20%, let sit for 10 min, repeat 2 more times
To bake: 6 min on 50%

I use this recipe every year in my microwave cooking unit at school.  Hard to believe you can make a yeast bread in the microwave.  Toasting this bread is a must!!!--it does not have great flavor without the toasting process.

After all the rave reviews, I was most disappointed at how bland this tasted and how dense it was.  Mine came out looking just like the picture and I followed the recipe exact; but when I went to cut myself a slice the edges were very tough and it did not taste anything like an English Muffin.  I still had almond butter with it and it filled me up, but don't think it can be qualified as an English Muffin.

I followed this recipe exactly.  Turns our very dense and rubbery.  The flavor is nice, and I like the rapid rise method- but I think this is one that would have turned out so much better just baked in the oven.

I have this recipe somewhere but unable to locate it since the move! I found this in a magazine about 25 years ago! It makes the best toast! Thanks so much for posting it as I have been thinking about making some to start freezing. Fall is just around the corner and everyone would appreciate getting this as a gift!
