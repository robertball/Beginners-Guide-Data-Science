This was a really good soup. It was very simple to make and my son and I enjoyed it. The only change I made was that I used ditali instead of fussilli, because I don't like large pastas. The ditali was wonderful. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Easy and good. Also works to add a raw, bone-in chicken thigh. Simmer until it's done, remove and shred  the meat and add back IF you want. Just that short time with the bone in will add flavor to the stock box.

Very simple, for medicinal purposes, I added a teaspoon of  minced garlic and a 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger. Also used one package of Reames egg noodles instead of the pasta...

Excellent and yes I'll make it again.

I'm not feeling good today so finding Chef John's 1 step was a godsend. It  came out really good, tho I didn't have any onions (I used 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder) and dried parsley flakes again didn't have fresh Italian parsley. Works well with rice too. Thanks Chef John; I'm feeling better already. :-)

Really good, really easy. But next time, I'll use chicken thighs.  The breast meat got over-cooked and so was a bit tough.  Otherwise hubby had the leftovers for lunch and he said it was just as good as supper the previous evening so that says a lot. A keeper for me.

I used 1.5 pounds of chicken Breast cubed. 
I added half a jalapeño chopped and 1 poblano pepper sliced. I used two Cartons of low sodium chicken broth and increased the amount of celery  and carrots to make a Dutch oven full. Mine didn’t get foamy as chef johns did. Maybe because of the added ingredients. I also cooked it covered for thirty minutes  on medium heat. Came out absolutely perfect! This is my new “go to” chicken noodle soup. So easy and tasty.

I tried this and it was great! I added a little bit more noodles, but it was still easy and tasty. My daughter even asked for seconds :)

I really loved this soup. I left out the cayenne because I don't like spicy. And I left out the thyme because I don't like it in my chicken noodle soup. I sliced the veggies very small. I think I'll double everything but the chicken. It didn't fully feed my family of four, but I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I will definitely make it again but I would make a change....add pasta during last 10 minutes of cooking if you like your pasta al dente which we do.....

I had to use elbows, Better Than Bouillon, and dried basil but it was perfect. I cooked the vegs in butter for about 5 mins. Thank you so much. You always save me. Going back to bed.

I added a little cornstarch/water to thicken it a little....but it didn't need much.  Was really good.
