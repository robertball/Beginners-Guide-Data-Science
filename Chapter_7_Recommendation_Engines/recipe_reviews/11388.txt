FANTASTIC!!  My only suggestion is to make sure you beat the butter/margarine for 15-30 seconds before adding the sugar and flour mixture.  And you also only have to shape the dough about halfway up the sides of the pan.

These taste phenomenal but I gave them a 4 because you can't make them as written.    Since other readers said they were too thin in a 9x13 I made mine in an 11x7, which I think was perfect.  However, there's no way you'd get 48 servings out of them, even in a 9x13.  In an 11x7 my husband and I each had dessert 3 times, so basically 6 servings.    The other problem I have with the directions is step #4.  If you're just supposed to sprinkle the chocolate chips and spoon the raspberry mixture on top, you get a lot of crust peeking through.  I ended up just spreading it all on top like a frosting, leaving some edge of the crust showing.  It looked pretty and evenly distributed the toppings.

My husband thought this recipe was "excellent"  It was delicious but I think it could have been  even better if I had used a smaller size pan to bake the crust in, making the bars thicker.  Also, I did add extra sugar to the raspberries to sweeten them up.  Will make this again

Absolutely fantastic, but rich.  Be sure and cut into small squares.  The crust is wonderfully buttery crumbly; when I baked the crust for the first 15 minutes, it only browned on the edges and seemed a bit loose still, but it turned out wonderfully.  And the whole thing will solidfy a bit more once it cools, so don't worry if it all seems just slightly loose after the final baking.  Enjoy!

Worth 6 stars!  This is an incredible recipe!  The combination of chocolate & raspberry is incredible & the shortbreadish crust goes perfectly.  What a lovely cookie!  I made it in a slightly smaller dish than the recipe asked so my crust was thicker - as a result, I had to cook the crust 3 minutes longer.  This recipe is going in my permanent file, I will use it frequently & try different berries (blueberries, blackberries, etc).  DE-LISH!

Unfortunately, these are far from low in fat - the butter & the chocolate provide plenty of fat - but well worth it!

I found this abit tart on top so I sprinkled it with icing sugar.  I also kneeed the dough into a ball then spread it into the pan so it would not be crumbly.

I substituted white chocolate chips.  I liked it a lot and it gives the cookies a more grown-up look and taste.

I did not think these bars were that great.  I was expecting more of a thicker, crumbly bar than what this recipe produced.  I also thought they were a bit tart.  Perhaps using raspberry jam, like someone else suggested, would have made a better tasting dessert. NOTE - the recipe is low fat if you cut them into 48 servings.

Would actually give it 3 1/2 stars, as it tasted all right but I found it very thin even though I used an 8 x 8 pan, and the raspberries on top grow a tough skin quite quickly. I would like to try it with blackberries though, and mess with the recipe a bit, as the basics were good.

Has anyone else noticed that the serving size is tiny?  You're supposed to divide the 13x9" pan into 48 squares?  I've only ever cut that size pan into half that amount of bars.

Good and very versitile.  I made a small tart out of it.  You can also make this in a muffin pan, pulling the crust up a bit on the edges for small servings!

Ugly looking dessert and very messy to eat with your hand. We found the chocolate overpowered it and the crust was overcooked with the specified time listed on the recipe? It was hard as a rock!

I took the advice of others and made these bars in a 9x9 pan, so the crust was a little thicker. I also formed the dough into a ball before pressing it into the pan, so the crust isn't too crumbly. Overall, they are good bars and are very simple to make. In my opinion, they could use a little more chocolate chips; maybe I'll try drizzling some melted chocolate on top.

Wow oh wow!  I can't tell you how good this is.  The only thing I did differently was I used two small packages of fresh blackberries and 1 small package of fresh raspberries.  The crust is is so flavorful and moist!  I like it so much I will use this crust recipe for future baking recipes.  I used ghirardeli chocolate and this added the best rich and creamy flavor to it.  Will make this again for sure!

These bars taste good, but their appearance isn't all that great. I thought I could have used less butter to make the crust and maybe use a smaller pan, a 9X9, like someone else suggested. They taste great and I didn't think they were too tart at all. I used white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips so maybe that made them a little sweeter. Very quick and easy to make.

These were a huge hit for Father's Day.  I used fresh berries and regular-sized chocolate chips (details are not my strong suit in recipes).  If you like chocolate and raspberry together, you will love these!

These were fabulous!  Didn't have minichips, so I used regular.  I sprinkled them on then let them sit for about 5 minutes until soft, spread the chocolate evenly over the base, then poured on the raspberry sauce.  Five grown men ate the entire pan in one sitting!

These bars are fabulous!  Instead of making the raspberry mixture, I simply spooned on jarred raspberry jam and followed the rest of the recipe as directed.    
For a fun treat, pop one of the bars in the microwave for 15 seconds, then top with a scoop of ice cream--delicious!

This was pretty good.  To start off I halved the recipe, which would have made 24.  I ended up with 12 bars, using an 8x8 pan which worked great.  Based on other reviews, that's what I was hoping for.  I wouldn't recommend sweetening the berries.  The crust and the chocolate make it awfully sweet.  I think the tartness from the raspberry is necessary.  I added some Grand Marnier to the filling, not a lot, but next time I think I'll try it in the crust.  I didn't find the crust overly crumbly (although, like I would with a pie crust, I worked it with my fingers until it looked like small crumbs).  The gooey-ness of the raspberry didn't bother me, either.  I will definitely make this again.  Tastes great and it's very simple.

I thought it was too much of the raspberry flavor.  I did make mine gluten free, though, so maybe that is what messed up the total taste.

Everybody loved this.  Added a little sugar to berries.  Tried making mini tarts in mini muffin tins, didn't want to release from pan.  Looked tragic but tasted great.  Next time will make in a 9x9 or double crust in a larger pan.

I will make these again, with alteration--DOUBLE CRUST!  Also, I used 1/2 of chocolate chips and made extra crust to crumble over the top of the bars.  Tart, but wonderful flavor.  Just more crust!

I thought this recipe was tart, also, which is exactly what I like. Great taste. Was hard not to leave them alone, but my grandchildren helped me out by taking care of most of them.

This is yummy!!! I used unsweetened raspberries (the recipe doesn't specify) but I was afraid that even with the OJ they wouldn't be sweet enough so I added a bit of sugar - I'm not sure if it needed it or not. Everyone loved these. My mom took them to work and now all her coworkers want the recipe. Thanks a bunch.

The crust was a little bland but everyone seemed to like the raspberry seeds/chocolate combo!

Great ingredients, but 20 minutes is not nearly enough time for this smallish dish to cook through. Too tart. Add sugar.

This was a quick dessert to make with fresh raspberries that needed to be used and a few ingredients that we always have around.  I think the calorie count is off though - you really can't get 48 little bars out of a 9x13 pan.  It's more like 150 calories per bar if you cut 24 of them.

I also used 7x11 pan. I also added sugar to the berry filling. Very pretty for the holidays.

Spectacular! Lots of compliments. After reading reviews about thinness, I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan and thought it was perfect that way. I also reserved some crumbles to put on top, drizzling extra chocolate on top of that. The raspberry sauce was too tart so I added sugar while cooking. Next time I will reduce sugar in the base.The sauce was not at all runny but I was short a tablespoon of orange juice(per single recipe), so maybe that helped. I will be making this again.

I almost doubled this recipe for a 9 X 13 pan, and it was delicious.  Very easy to cut and lift out of the pan.

Completely perfect as is: 1"x2" bars, not too sweet (use dark chocolate), thin crunchy crust.  My friend made this for a party with literally about 30 desserts on the table and this was the best of them all.

Awful recipe, the measurements are completely screwed up. Should be made in an 8x8pan not a 9x13. What a waste of great ingredients.

too tart..crust wasn't set enough and the jam didn;t get to a point in solidity that when i cut into it, it gooed all over, making for a very messy and unstable square.
Could have been really good but either I messed up somewhere or the berry mixture isn't strong enough to stay together during cutting.
