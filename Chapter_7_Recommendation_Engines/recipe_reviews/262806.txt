By far one of the better Beef Stroganoff recipes we have tried.  I enjoyed making it, and while it is a bit labor intensive, it is still a relatively quick and deeply satisfying meal. Next time around I will start by adding a Half Cup of Sour Cream and adjust from there.  I feel that one cup of sour cream covered up some of the great flavors that were building through the process. Thank you!

I followed the recipe as written, but I used NY steaks because that’s what we had in our freezer.

I've always made it this way.  I don't usually have Sherry, so I sometimes use a dry red wine and some Worcestershire.  I never use cooking wine or cooking Sherry though.

The kids loved this, however I did not have sherry, so I used 1/2 cup of beer.  It still worked well.

Will definitely make this again.

My only experience with beef stroganoff over the years has sadly been though TV dinners; but I liked it anyway. Finally, as an adult and a father, I had my 8 year old (two nights before her 9th birthday) make this recipe with me and my own grandmother.

It was helpful to have my grandmother present while making the gravy, because I’d seen her make various gravies in the past, but never done one myself. We almost lost it, but her help saved us. That part is VERY time-sensitive.

Overall it was good, but I must say that it wasn’t a “best ever” recipe. I’ll need to play with it in the future to make it stand out more. All four kids were “OK” with it (one basically just ate the steak).

Definitely a recipe to try again, but as a base with modifications performed.
