Another hit out of the Ball Park!  Thanks for a wonderful dinner tonight!  I didn't buy the ready-made patties but rather the ground turkey itself and added the seasoning before grilling it outside.  I used pepper jack cheese for these and thought it made a perfect combo!  It was a really good dinner, and we will have it again!  Thank you so much!

Oh yum!  I love turkey burgers.  This was a very moist burger.  I loved the spice balance of the burger and the freshness of the guacamole on top.

Overall this was really good. I made my own patties, so I just added the spices to the meat mixture instead of spreading them on. I added about a tablespoon of dry bread crumbs to the mix also. The turkey burgers tasted good and came out great on my George Foreman grill. The guacamole was good on top, but I piled it on too high, because after my first bite, a bunch of the guac squished out of the sides. Oh well... tasted good anyway.

Great Burger all around! Everything is healthy and tastes wonderful together! The buns tasted so fresh and I will now always take the extra step to brush the buns with melted butter and toast them. That brought these burgers to the gourmet level and was so easy! Will make again and again!

So good for a quick and easy burger! Although, we did cheat and used store bought guacamole (same ingredients as the recipe though). I would prefer to increase amount of seasonings and mix in with ground turkey but, when short on time or feeling lazy, get the preformed and these turkey burgers are delicious! So flavorful, especially with the guac. No need for the other toppings as we normally would do. Hubs added cheese to his burgers and had two in one sitting--he's normally a beef burger guy! Quartered some potatoes and cooked over the grill in a foil packet for a side along with a basic garden salad. Definitely will be making this again!

This was a hit!  I wish I had bought more ground turkey because everyone kept asking for more.  The seasoning was perfect.  Be sure to butter and toast the rolls because it adds a nice flavor and crunch.

I enjoyed this burger very much, I thought the application of the spices to the Turkey patties was easy and made a big difference to the overall flavor. Good Stuff.

We really liked these burgers! They came together quickly, are fairly healthy, and taste pretty darn good. That's a win in my book!

Maybe our meat was too lean, but the burger was really bland. I couldn't get into it, the guacamole didn't complement the burger.

Absolutely delicious! The guacamole really adds a whole other layer of flavor and texture to this already incredible burger! What a great way to eat healthy at a summer cook out!

I love turkey burgers and Mexican food, so, this was a great combination for us!  I couldn't find prepackaged uncooked turkey burgers, so, I bought bulk turkey meat and mixed it together with all the seasonings.   I thought the guacamole was easy to make with the use of salsa.  I would have liked some fresh cilantro added.  Thanks for the recipe, Ball Park!

We eat turkey burgers on a regular basis and these burgers were a great way to change things up. My husband loved the addition of guac to the burger. We will be making these again!

We really liked these Turkey Burgers. The southwest flavors and the guacamole really enhanced it. We will make these again. Quick and delicious. Perfect for a BBQ or a week night meal.  Thank you Ball Park for another great recipe.

Surprise, surprise, here is a real alternative to an all-American hamburger!  This turkey patty had a great flavor, and I love the idea of brushing it with oil to hold the seasonings.  They made a sort of crust which added to the mouth "feel".  My turkey was so loose, I could never have put it on the grill, so doing it stovetop was the best solution for me.  The guacamole was a nice touch, and sliced tomatoes, lettuce and cheese added to this beef-less burger.  Will definitely do again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think the burgers could be greatly improved by using ground turkey and mixing the seasoning throughout as opposed to brushing the outside of preformed turkey burgers with seasoning. The guacamole had an unusual taste because of the chili powder, so I would leave it out. These burgers hit the spot! I used Gouda cheese, and it was wonderful with the guacamole

I grilled the turkey burgers on the grill. The turkey burger was a hit with the whole family. It has been a long time since I ate a turkey burger. The seasonings did not have an overpowering taste even for my grandkids. I would suggest not placing the guacamole on top of a tomato because it made the bun slip around.

I can honestly say, I've never had a turkey burger. I made these for dinner tonight, and these were absolutely delicious! The seasonings add such a great flavor, and the guacamole brings it over the top.  Thanks, Ball Park Buns, for a great recipe. I'll be making these again.
