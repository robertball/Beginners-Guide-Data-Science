This was a hit at my party!  I did alter it though.  Instead of the cherry pie filling, I whipped whipping cream until it peaked.  Added it on top with fresh berries.

Baking Fool- I've never done mini-mini cheesecakes.  You might try putting a few of the mini vanilla wafers in the bottom or perhaps just break up a few of the larger cookies.  The cheesecake filling does soften up the cookie so you won't notice really the change in shape.  Good luck!

I remember making these a very long time ago and was surprised at how many coworkers asked for the recipe, after making them for a Thanksgiving get together. I'm making them again today for a Christmas party. The cherries and Christmas paper liners really give them the Christmas Spirit!

These were good. I bit messy for me but my nephew and his family enjoyed what we didn't eat. These i will make again since i am dieting . I like to have a little "snack" after dinner and 1 or 2 of these would be great. Thanks!!

I’ve now made this twice in 3 days thanks to two events I needed a dessert for, and everyone has loved them.  They are small, easy to eat, and apparently really good.  (I’m dairy free and didn’t get a chance to pull everything together to make them dairy free, but will in the future!)  Highly recommend as a special treat to serve to guests or to easily pack up and bring along to an event (as long as you have some cool storage if you’re not eating them immediately).

I made these according to directions and they perfect!  Took them on a hike with several girls and everyone raved.  Taste exactly like a recipe I used years ago and had lost.
