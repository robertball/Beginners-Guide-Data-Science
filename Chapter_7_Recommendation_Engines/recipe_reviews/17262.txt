Wonderful gift idea.  Everyone I gave it to raved and many copied the idea!  It is a little difficult to pack the ingredients properly and maintain the layers, but with a little practice, you can make a beautiful, tasty and inexpensive gift.

I was given this recipe as a 'gift in a jar' for Christmas.  When I made it today, I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup (could have used even less) and the oven temperature to 325ยบ, because I was using a glass baking dish.  I baked the brownies between 40-45 minutes before I felt they were "done."  They still gave the appearance of being quite gooey and were greasy.  The gift in a jar idea is great, but the recipe for the final product needs some adjusting.

The texture of the brownie base was heavy and greasy, not appealing.

This is a great gift. The brownies end up really good. Great little gift idea for those you need "a little something" for.

These do turn out a bit heavy and somewhat greasy as others have mentioned. As they baked, the oil was literally bubbling out of the tops of the brownies. They did take about 45 minutes to bake. The amount of oil seems excessive, but when I tried mixing these with just 1/3 cup oil, the mixture was too dry. I would probably try using 1/3 cup oil and a little water for added moisture the next time.

I've been making these for a few years now. I got the recipe from Quick Cooking magazine. Super easy to make (think assembly line style) and they make excellent gifts for the office! Everyone says they're yummy!

I use pinking shears to cut circles of holiday fabric to layer between the lid and the ring and I print up the baking instructions on shipping labels, add some holiday clipart and stick them on the jar. I'm making my annual batch tomorrow!
