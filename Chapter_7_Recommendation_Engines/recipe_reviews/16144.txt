Awesome!  I used 2 heaping cups of chopped cooked potatoes and this worked out great.  Delicious and so easy to prepare and a huge hit with teens and kids alike!

The sauce was rather runny and I was left with a lot more sauce than potato.  Definitely an 'A' for being quick and easy, but the flavor was just okay.

This was very easy to make, even with cooked potatoes (which I used in place of canned).  But I thought the taste was a bit bland.

It's not bad.  As expected, a little on the balnd side and we're really not fans of that much dill.  It was still better than store-bought though!  Used cooked potatos instead of canned.  Sauce is a little runny, but the potatos will absorb some of the liquid if you let it set.

I thought this was a good base recipe, The dressing was a little thin so I added a little more of the salad dressing. I did use cooked potatoes instead of canned. Since we like a little more veggies in our potato salad I added celery, red onion, olives, cucumbers and some shredded carrots.
