These were incredible!  I had to restrain myself from eating the whole batch! We sometimes add shredded chicken for an extra non vegetarian treat!

We loved this recipe!  My husband and I love black beans and I'm always looking for new recipes, this one is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.  I did make one change though, I used salsa instead of picante sauce.

It was really wonderful!  I made a few slight adjustments like using chunky salsa instead of picante sauce and tomatoes.  Very good!

My whole family loved this!  My DH usually insists on meat with a meal and even he enjoyed these with no complaints!  I did make my beans from scratch and had to add salt and I also added a little cumin to the bean mixture.  Very good!  I served this with Spanish rice.  A new way to enjoy black beans.  Thanks!

These are great tasting and easy to make.  Definetly use flour tortillas.  We tried used corn and flout and the corn tortillas don't work well.

My husband thinks he has to have meat with dinner, but he LOVES these.  I added rice to mine and used a reduced fat Mexican cheese blend.

A good healthy alternative to regular enchiladas. Made ours with low-carb/high fiber tortillas and substituted the green pepper with canned green chilies for a little more heat. Very filling too!

I am married to a meat-loving Texan and he loved these!! He was very impressed. Very easy to make too. I added a jalapeno chilie to spice it up a little. Next time I'll add two. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe. It was really easy to make and everyone raved about them. Even my brother-in-law who professes to dislike black beans. An added bonus is that all the ingredients are usually on hand.

This recipe is my boyfriend's favorite.  We use fattening cheese instead of the skim, but we love it!

Good as it is, but I'll be customizing it next time...mixing the sour cream into the filling, instead of on the side, using 3/4  or 1/2 the onion, adding a couple chili peppers, and maybe some extra cheese...

Really enjoyed this recipe. According to my husband, if all of our meatless meals tasted like this, he would seriously consider giving up meat (and he's an avid meat eater) - mj

I'm sure this recipe was awesome as is, but I had some extra time so I tinkered around with it.  I used homemade red enchilada sauce instead of the picante sauce.  I also added some brown rice, canned jalepenos, canned green chiles, and about 1/4 c. sour cream and some salt to the filling.  My husband loved it, and like others said, he didn't even miss the meat.  This recipe is so affordable.  My husband actually stood and and started clapping for me when he finished eating.  You have to try this!

Very easy to make and everyone like it.  A very generous serving size so we didn't have a side dish.  I used regular thick salsa.  Next time I will give it a spicy kick.

These were excellant!  I added jalapenos to the bean mixture to spice it up a little.  I also used a can of red enchilada sauce to roll these in and topped it off with picante, enchilada sauce and all cheddar cheese.  Didn't even miss the meat!!!

This was OK. I am always looking for good meatless recipes and thought I would love this. It just needs something, but I'm not sure what. Maybe I'll try again and modify.

These enchiladas are wonderful!  My boyfriend didn't even complain about the lack of meat!  I served with a side of Spanish rice and I used chunky salsa instead of picante sauce.  I will definitely make these again!

My husband loved them, but I wasn't as enthusiastic. There was something missing, but I'm not sure what. If I make them again, I will probably use way more picante sauce - they were too dry for my liking - and maybe some cilantro.
