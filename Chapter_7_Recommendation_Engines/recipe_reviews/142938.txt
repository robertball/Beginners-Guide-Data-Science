I used oatmeal in the crust instead of pecans, and it turned out really good.  I used a 9 inch pan , so I baked the crust for 10 minutes (to avoid mushiness).  I also used fresh peaches.  Very good flavor, and not too sweet.  A very good use for peaches!

Very good recipe.  Did substitute fresh peeled peaches for the canned peaches, and low-fat cream cheese for regular.  The crust was really easy and my son, who never eats fruits, had 2 slices!

I used fresh peaches the first time I made this, doubling the cream cheese mixture because I had extra peaches.  I baked the crust about 15 minutes to make it crisper.  It was delicious.  The next time I made this, I tried to use frozen peaches and it was a miserable failure because the frozen peaches were too juicy and I did nothing to the recipe to compensate for the extra liquid.  Made as indicated - wonderful!

I don't know where this recipe has been hiding all these years, this is great! I love the crust, I baked it for 10 minutes at 425f. I used a 7 by 11" cake pan, and it was perfect for the amount of crust. Next time I'll use the same pan, but I'll double the cream cheese mixture. I also used Fresh peaches, 5 regular sized peaches. I would describe this more as a Tart then a Torte, and the fruit possibilities are endless ( apples, pear, cherry, blueberry, etc.). This would be so good with apricots or raspberries with an almond crust instead of pecans. A must try!

This tasted fantastic! My only question is how long is it supposed to cool? There were no instructions about cooling in the recipe. After being in the fridge for over an hour the pie was luke warm and a little on the runny side. Now that it's been in the fridge longer, it has set nicely, but I wish I'd known to cool it longer before cutting. Didn't affect the wonderful taste though. Next time I'll know- and believe me, there will be a next time!

The amount of dough was perfect for my smallest pie plate to cover only the bottom and a bit up the side. It was very creamy and tasty, much like something from a European bakery. Would be nice with plums or apples too.

I should have taken the advice of the other reviewers and cooked the crust a bit more - I found that there was too much crust as well; next time - and there will be a next time - I'll only make half as much crust mixture. Filling was excellent!

Creamy, delicious and so easy to make!  I, too, used fresh instead of canned peaches.  We loved the nutty bottom.  I made two at the same time: one for us to enjoy now and one for the freezer.

Great crust! I used fresh peaches (about 5 or 6 medium size) scalded, peeled and sliced. Also, I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg with the cinnamon, and mixed this into the cream cheese mix rather than topping the torte with unsweetened spices. This recipe is a keeper.

I rated this 5 stars, because I'm sure it will be! I have a question...have you ever tried making this with 'reduced fat' or 'no fat' cream cheese?

I found the crust to be chewy and not crisp like I thought it would be.  Perhaps if this was baked in a 9 X 13 pan it would be better.  Very disappointing!

This recipe was awesome. I didn't change a thing. It wasn't too sweet, yet just enough balance. My boyfriend and I were fighting over the pan. Finally I just went to the store and made 2 more... Will definitely make again

I used about 2 big, fresh peaches for this recipe.  It was relatively easy to make, but not especially "pretty" to photograph (smile).   I also wasn't sure from the recipe if I should serve it room temp or chilled. (?)   Overall, I loved the blend of flavors, along with the shortbread-type pecan crust. If I make it again, I would probably reserve a layer of peaches to lay across the top, so that the presentation was a little nicer on the eyes.  :-)

The dish was so easy to make and so fabulous to eat. I did use fresh peaches instead of canned. I took it to a dinner party and one of the guests was a sous chef at a country club. He talked to his chef and now wants me to supply these to the club.

I did not have pecans and made oatmeal crust instead as some reviewers suggested, it came out crunchy and tasty. It did stick to the pan and was hard to cut, not a big deal. My husband and son didn't like the filling... They said they did not care for cream cheese flavor in it. I agree, it did have a weird taste (I used kraft cream cheese, nobody ever complained about cream cheese taste before ie in cheesecakes). I didn't think it was that bad, and I actually liked the tart but I will omit cream cheese and use sour cream next time. We also don't like almond extract, I don't think it goes well with peaches, I used vanilla.

I made this, with no changes for guests and it was a real hit with everyone. Even the ones who weren't fond of peaches. 

It didn't save in my favourites list the first time around, so had a difficult time finding it again, but well worth the effort.

I made this and it was delicious but I was not sure if the butter should be cut into the flour like regular pie crust, or if the butter should be softened, or melted? If anyone has the answer please post.

This was a delicious and not too heavy dessert!  I used frozen peaches instead of canned, and can't wait to make it with fresh peaches.  The creamy cheesy filling was perfect with the nutty crust.  Try this!  You'll love it!

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I  left  it in the oven a few extra minutes to ensure it was cooked through.    I cooled it at room temp and then chilled in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.   Got rave reviews from my guests.  Will definitely make this one again and again!

A very good cheesecake. I doubled the filling recipe because when I made it it didn't look like much. I made my own graham crumb crust because that's my favourite. I also topped it with sliced almonds to make it look prettier. Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I'll make it again, quick and easy.

Since I'm in the north east & it's winter I used Kirkland peaches in the glass jar with extra light syrup. I made a double batch, I used a 13x9 glass dish & I sprayed a bit of Pam just in case, I substituted oatmeal, cashews & English walnuts for the pecans, it's what I had on hand & wanted to get used up. I precisely followed the balance of the recipe. My crust did come out kinda dark, when I make this again I'm going to adjust temp BUT it's still delicious. It's a great dessert, sweet but not overly sweet
