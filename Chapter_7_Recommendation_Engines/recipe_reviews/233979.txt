Fruit smoothies are a staple in my household. I leave for work early while my hubby sleeps so its easy peasy to whip one up and leave it for him to get a good Healthy breakfast! I always add a scoop of Uncooked oatmeal just the regular quick kind. Freezing the fruit helps thicken the smoothie up without watering it down with ice cubes. Thank YOU Carolina Blond!

This smoothie is definitely epic! It almost broke my Vitamix blender. Why in the world it would not budge I have no idea? I cut the recipe in half and had to use an additional 1 cup of liquid to blend it. Only change I made was using homemade almond milk and Truvia for the sweetener which I have done numerous times. It about burned my motor though for some reason. I tasted it and like many typical all banana and strawberry smoothies it had that vitamin after taste that is kind of hard to explain. I fixed it by adding about 1/2 orange. The photo of the recipe looks great either way.
