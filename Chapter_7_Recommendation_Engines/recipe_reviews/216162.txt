I would like a little more direction about how much lemon juice to use. We enjoyed this on sausage/veggie pitas. I used curry powder that looked yellow...so I guess it was what was called for. Mine said "Bombay style" but I don't know if that is the same thing. This was not spicy hot so I may have used too mild a curry powder.

I enjoyed this simple Curry recipe. It was a bit sweet but still not bad for how quickly it can be made. Try leaving out the lemon juice reducing the honey and mustard by 1/2 adding some soy sauce (1 to 2 Tbsp.) and 4 to 5 diced Scallions. Pour over a bed of Rice topped with Chicken and Brocollli. Delicious either way!

Pretty easy but not the authentic Indian taste I was wanting.

Pour this over raw chicken and bake it in the oven at 350 an hour or an hour an a half until the chicken is cooked through. You'll love it.

I did not care for this it tasted like honey mustard. I added two more teaspoons of curry powder and still tasted like honey mustard.

This is an amazingly versatile recipe. I've made it both with normal yellow mustard to acclaim and by replacing the yellow mustard with honey Dijon mustard. This change makes it ideal for a barbecue. Some chicken fried rice with this modified sauce is in high demand whenever I grill.
