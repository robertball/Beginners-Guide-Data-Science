Yummy!  Used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening, made sure all the peanuts were split in half, and baked for 13 minutes.  Slightly crunchy on the outside.  Great cookie that is 'peanut' and not 'peanut butter'!

Delicious.  I used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract and I think this gave them even more flavor.  Served them at a party and they were a real hit.

Excellent recipe. I also made a batch with Splenda substituting one cup of the Splenda and two tablespoons of peanut butter for one cup of Brown sugar.  Both batches turned out great. Putting egg white wash on the cookies made them look prettier.

Cake like cookie with nice appearance. I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 margarine. I also used honey roasted peanuts and added a cup of chocolate chips. My husband and kids enjoyed.

Although I halved the shortening the cookies were still sweet and salty enough from the sugar and peanuts that there wasn't anything lacking. Thanks for the recipe idea.

I love peanut butter cookies and went looking to find a faceless recipe.  Although this recipe didnâ€™t have peanut butter in it, it was packed with salted peanuts that give this cookie a wonderful taste.  I used my small cookie scoop and it yielded 87 cookies.  This was more than enough to share with my family, the neighbors, in-laws and a good share to take on a road trip to Tennessee, which was the intended purpose of making these cookies.   The directions tell you to flatten with the bottom of a glass, make sure that you do so.  I forgot to do so, on 1 pan, and the cookie does not flatten much on its own.  I flattened with a fork and chose to sprinkle the sugar over each cookie rather than dipping a glass in sugar each time.  We all enjoyed this recipe and it will be made again.

I think I have made this recipe 20 times.  It is easy and very tasty.  When I buy mixed nuts over the holidays the leftover peanuts go into these cookies.  Yummy.  Thanks

I really liked these cookies. I used half butter and half margarine. I omitted the salt b/c I was using the salted peanuts and I thought it would be too much salt. I halved the recipe and used all whole wheat flour and 9 tsp. vital wheat gluten (Whole Foods). I think they tasted so great b/c my salted peanuts were really fresh.

It was ok.  I think next time I'd use butter instead of shortening.  Also, I'll add chocolate chips.  They were kind of bland.

These did not spread, I didn't think they would be crispy, but they were. I subbed half of the nuts with butterscotch chips. Very good according to the K's.
