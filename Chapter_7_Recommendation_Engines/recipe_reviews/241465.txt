This turned out great.  My store only carried the 15 bean package and not the 12 bean.  I live in a place where fresh green chili is always on the menu.  My husband doesn't like beans so much, but he loved this dish.  The green chili made all the difference.  It is a keeper for sure.

This was really good! I did sub chicken stock for the chicken base as mentioned in the footnotes. I had a hodge podge of mixed dried beans on hand  and made my own "8 bean soup mix".  This recipe will work with any dry beans you have on hand or beans you prefer. Just be sure to use 32 ounces of beans total. This turned out better than the last few ham and bean recipes I've tried and I really liked the flavor the beer added. Keeper!

Excellent.  This turned out great following the recipe as written.  The second time I made a 10 qt batch and used 2 lbs of ground hot sausage instead of the ham hocks (family preference).  I also soaked the beans overnight and then cooked everything for about 3 1/2 hrs on the stove.  Very easy to make.  It freezes great and makes a satisfying meal on its own.

So, I took a few things from several recipes as I often do. Cooked it on low in crockpot for about 24 hours and the ham bone was totally clean. Threw in the kitchen sink with this one and it perfectly filled my crockpot. Made Red Lobster garlic parmesan biscuits with it and it was divine!
