I have to admit I just took the basic ingredients & didn't follow the recipe but what I ended up with was awesome.  If you are interested, I melted 1/2 c. butter on the stove top, and stirred in 2/3 c. half & half since I didn't have any cream.  Then, I added 1 1/4 c. shredded parmesan cheese.  Tossed with angel hair pasta & added some chicken sauteed in olive oil & 1 clove of garlic.  Very delicious!

Easy and tastes great!!!!  I used skim milk and low fat parm cheese and it was fabulous.  Throw in some California Blend veggies and you have a nice, healthy meal!

I really liked this recipe when I tossed it with the warm pasta. Although, I had a little trouble with it separating when I added it to a sauce I was preparing on the stovetop. But now that I know this, I will prepare the sauce differently and add the alfredo at the last moment.   Great short cut recipe.  Thanks, oh, and if you have any left over sauce, it is fantastic added to your mashed pototoes!

This was awesome!  I did add some garlic powder to the butter mixture. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but as soon as I mixed it in with the pasta, it became instantly smooth and creamy. I used portabella mushroom stuffed tortelloni purchased at the grocery store refrigerator section for my pasta. This is a keeper! Thanks Becky.

Pretty good.  Nice thing is that you can put it in the fridge and wait for the pasta to get done or chicken.  Makes for a never-fail alfredo sauce.

Really really easy and very good!  I mixed leftover peas, broccoli, and chicken in and it was fantastic!  A great way to use up leftovers.

Just what I was looking for, simple and FAST.  I needed to use a rotisserie chicken up and wanted something other than a casserole.  Thanks!

Great, very simple, tasty sauce. I added a pinch of ground nutmeg when stirring onto cooked pasta. It fully coated 4 oz. (uncooked) of shells. I will make this again.

I work as a cook at a nursing home in Montana.  I use this recipe for lasagna & manicotti sauce instead of the traditional marinara sauce.  All of our employees & our residents love it & always ask for 2nds!  The only change I made was to add diced fresh bellpepper, mushrooms & onions to the sauce & let it simmer awhile to enhance the flavor!

This was amazing.  BUT - if you are looking for a tradition alfredo sauce you must add fresh garlic/parsley and a few shakes of nutmeg.  My husband says it tastes just like Red Lobster's alfredo sauce (so obviously it would be amazing with lobster or shrimp!)  All three of my kids ate it ages 1-7 and loved it.  Reheats beautifully and so easy.  My mom said it is resaurant quality.  If you add the few little things I said and do it in a sauce pan, just melt it all together, you will LOVE it.  It is fattening, so be careful! Also, I used whole milk b/c that's what I had and I would recommend that so it won't be so, so rich.  Enjoy!

This was the easiest recipe I have found and loved in a long time. I read most of the notes and also added in garlic salt. I slowly added the heavy cream (I made mine) and stopped as I got closer to 3/4 cup. I found that this helped it from being too runny. I whipped it and it came out perfect.

This was soo quick, how ever I mixed it in my Ninja chopper and it thickened really quick, which was awesome for what I was using it for on dinner. I did add 2 tsp chopped garlic 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. For my taste. But the recipe tastes like a basic alfredo sauce no question about it. This is a fabulous quick recipe. Thanks for this so much because it was a last minute "OH MY GOD!!!!" Don't have a jar of sauce...so again thank you it saved my bacon!!

For years I've been trying to convince my husband to try fettucini with Alfredo sauce.  He was convinced he hated the stuff, though he'd never tried it.  I decided that since I was craving it, I would cook up some chicken breasts I had in the fridge, throw some fettucini noodles in a pot and make this sauce.  It was amazing!  My husband loved it, although he did say it was "a little rich"..Who cares?!  I love rich!  LOL  My only complaint is that when you reheat the dish the next day, the sauce doesn't stay creamy.  Excellent though, and will make again!  Thanks!

I have used this with heavy cream . . and its FANTASTIC!! I will make again!!! I didn't have cream and tried to use non fat milk, it was terrible! If you don't have the cream, don't use milk!  Just look for another recipe for which you have the correct ingredients for!!

I found that when using fresh grated parmesan, it was a bit lumpy and an unpleasant consistency. Kraft-style powdered parmesan works much better for this.

I used this recipe to make sauce/pasta for 150 people. (but added garlic-you must have garlic in alfredo!) I doubled the recipe, added garlic and kept making it until I had 2 gallons of alfredo. The no cook sauce is the way to go for cooking for large crowds. Everyone loved it, it did not separate and THANKS!

Very quick & easy. I made mine in the blender - the sauce was more thick than frothy but it did go on the noodles well.

Worked well for a quick sauce...I heated it, used milk and shaking parmesan, heated it in a sauce pan and added some flour to thicken, stirred in leftover chicken and added it to spaghetti. Yummy!

Made this for family reunion dinner, served it with a rosemary garlic grilled chicken, California blend veggies, wild mushroom mix and some onions. There was nothing leftover. Very easy to make, and it scaled up to feed 30 people very well. It is a keeper.

I made this alfredo sauce in the morning and took it to work in a crock pot for a potluck lunch. It was sooo good and lots of people asked for the recipe. I used half and half so it would be a little bit thinner. We also ate the leftover the next day and it did not separate when we reheated it. Absolutely a great recipe! You can adjust it to your liking and you can't screw it up. Yum.

This was really good. I mixed it in my Magic Bullet, but you could probably use a blender too. That made it quick and easy and I added a couple garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and parsley. Then I put it in the microwave for about a minute. It was really thin when I added it to my Shrimp and sauteed vegetable mixture, but it thickens after it sets off the heat for a couple minutes. It was rich, tasty, and super easy.

Super fast and easy to put this one together. Even faster and no pans to clean up with no cooking required. It wasn't quite as rich or creamy as the other cooked methods, and when it melted down it was thin and very saucy but it was good enough for a fast easy no cook alfredo sauce. I'd fix this again. Thanks MommyD!

For ease of preparation, definitely 5 stars.  Our guests all thought it was tasty, cheesy and I love having a quick recipe on a weeknight.  It would be very simple to add ingredients for variety and flavor.

Well, this was a complete failure for me. The Parmesan cheese wouldn't mix in with the other ingredients and just ended up being a clumpy, lumpy mess. It wasn't edible and so this became the very first recipe that I have actually just thrown out. I had high hopes for this one and was really looking forward to it...oh well. Good thing I had a jar of alfredo sauce in the cabinet otherwise we wouldn't have had anything to put on the noodles that were already cooked. I will keep looking for that perfect alfredo sauce.

Subbed half & half and Three Italian Cheese blend (parmesan, reggiano and asiago)...it was a bit lumpy but still delicious. MUCH better than the canned stuff and not too complicated. I will try again soon and hopefuly will perfect the consistency....

I'm not sure if I had rotten ingredients or if it's this recipe... The parmesian didn't mix well with the butter so it just turned to chunky mush floating in cream.  Not to ruin your apetite or affend anyone... just be prepaired to finish with disappointment in case it goes wrong.

I had such high hopes for this one. The flavor was there and it was easy but the consistency did not work for me. I don't know if I did something wrong but it was too runny. And the leftover sauce hardened up in the fridge.

If I hadn't tried it - I wouldn't have believed it! It worked it actually worked. And it tasted pretty darn good. I did add garlic though. And I'll only make it when I'm in a pinch for time.

I thought for sure this was  a dud in the making and I was very wrong. Two very very picky toddlers ate it all up over angel hair pasta. I also used half n half as I did not have whipping cream and had to sub soy margarine and yet it still really good.  Will definately keep ingrediants on hand for this one going forward.

This was so easy and pretty tastey.  (added some black pepper and salt to taste) The best part is that it didn't require cooking!  It was quick and easy and made enough for several meals.   I made a batch on Monday to use with stir fried chicken, broccoli, zucchini, red peppers, onions and pasta.  It was FANTASTIC!  Had it again on Wednesday and yet again today!

Needed a quick alfredo sauce for dinner tonight and chose this one. Amazing! I added a little cube of cream cheese i had left over to the ingredients, added dried garlic and some herbs, and used 1% milk. Me and the husband both thought it was great! Thanks for an awesome recipe... never would have thought to do this!

I too took the basic ingredients & went from there.  In addition to the basic ingredients, I used approx. 1/3rd of a packet of dry Ranch dressing/dip mix.  Tossed it with sauteed shrimp and it was AMAZING.  Be sure to use good cheese, it will make or break this recipe

I was really rooting for it because of all of the great reviews and it just doesn't get any easier... It needed a LOT of salt.  I tried adding a little nutmeg and even some Old Bay seasoning to give this some flavor, but it never happened.  There's another recipe that's similar but uses some garlic salt.  Maybe I'll try that.

Maybe this would be a good base to build on, but as is (which is how I tried it) it was much too bland.  Garlic would be a start...

Absolutely delicious, with a little tweaking.  I added a generous amount of salt and pepper which made it completely amazing.  You really need those two items to bring it all together.  Also, freshly grated parmesan cheese is the way to go with this.  I used Sargento's block of parm, it was only $2 at the store, so it's not as expensive as the imported stuff, but still wonderful.  Since I used up all my parm, tonight I'm trying it with shredded mozzerella and also adding some garlic powder.  This is really very good and so easy.  Also, it's even better warmed up!!  I served it with fettuccini and the "blackened chicken" from this site, excellent combo!!  Try it:)

As yummy as it was easy! I followed others' suggestions of adding a little cracked pepper and some garlic (though I put in a bit too much garlic), and I would have added nutmeg but I was out. Ended up using too little cream, I think, since the consistency was more of buttered pasta than a cream sauce, but still very, VERY good. 
AND... my children, who've before tonight refused to even TRY an alfredo sauce were so excited by me getting out the electric mixer (thought it was cookies, I explained that it was basically garlic butter) and they all decided to taste the sauce before the pasta was done. ALL 3 of them loved it and gladly gobbled up their pasta when I served it. VERY nice change to have everyone liking the same thing. Thank you! I will definitely make this again and try for a better consistency.
NOTE:
Made this again, and had the same results (though I did reign in the garlic. This is very yummy, but it's not creamy like an alfredo. Clever though!

I was really skeptical about this.  Especially since I was using this as a last minute dinner idea for a date.    But it was really good.  Even my rommate had second helpings the next day -- and she never does that!  Goes great with the grilled chicken, broccoli (or spinach), and penne dish I use it for.  Definitely a keeper.

What an easy and tasty recipe!  I did use garlic powder for extra flavour and tossed the pasta with leftover roast beef strips.  Adjusted the recipe for 2 and hubby and I both enjoyed it. (I didn't have cream so I subsituted milk without any problem).  I couldn't believe you didn't have to cook an Alfredo sauce!

Very simple and came out perfect.  Only word of advice I have is continue beating the mixture at a high speed, as if you are making whipped cream. I added some garlic powder and it was awesome!

When I make my homemade alfredo sauce, this is the way I make it! The only difference is that I add fresh cracked black pepper and some parsley at the end for color. This recipe is super simple, delicious and will not disappoint! :)

Excellent - so easy and delicious.  I've made many alfredo sauces from this website and this one is just as great as some of the others, but much, much easier.  As stated in the recipe, the original mixture will be like finely scrambled eggs.  Its amazing, when you put it on the warm pasta, it just melts and looks great.

Awesome Alfredo Sauce - so much better than store bought and just as easy as store bought to prepare your meal.  The recipe looked exactly like scrambled eggs at first (not very appealing) but once mixed with hot noodles melted down into a creamy-rich, buttery, cheesy dish!  Just awesome!

Not bad.  I'll make again.  I used 2% milk instead of cream.  I added an extra 1/2 cup because I had more noodles than I thought.  Probably won't do that again, as it was too thin.  I did throw in some garlic, frozen peas and sliced chicken sausage.  tasty, even my 2 year old ate it.

We have been using a variation of this recipe for more than 15 years and everyone in the family loves it.  We heat the cream and butter together in the microwave and stir, then we toss the butter/cream, the cheese and the drained hot pasta all together in the pot until every thing is coated and blended together.  So simple, so good.  Add fresh ground pepper and a pinch of salt.

This was a hit with the hubby and room mate! It was a little chunky even after it was blended, but it all melted on the warm pasta. I also used milk and it was fine:)

Wow. I used this sauce for my Spinach Lasagna Roll Ups. My boyfriend has lost his appetite and going as far to losing alot of weight (illness), He ate two of these and loved the sauce. He said that it made the Roll Ups at hit. He liked this sauce much more than he would have a tomato based sauce. As I didn't have any cream or half n half, I used evaporated milk and it did just fine. I was amazed! Thanks. This one is a keeper!

Simple, easy, delicious.  Like another reviewer here, I only had milk on hand, but when I saw what she said, I tried it.  Did add a little flour to help thicken (not too much else it taste like flour).  I recommend adding pepper and parsley flakes. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

LOVED this one!! So easy!! I followed the instructions exactly, only adding about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, salt and pepper (just my family's taste).  Was worried about the cottage cheese-like consistancy, but it turned out creamy when mixed with the hot pasta.  My family LOVED this cream sauce.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

This couldn't be easier.  I was looking for a "bland" sauce to cover various pasta for my 3 year old.  She's not a fan of parmesean so I used 1/4 cup parm and 1/2 mozzerella.  It was so good, the whole family liked it and it was "bland" enough for her.

I've made this twice and my family LOVES it! The first time, the butter wasn't quite room temperature and it didn't mix well and I ended up having to heat the sauce.  The second time the butter was room temperature and it worked out perfectly!  This is certainly a keeper.  I added cooked chicken and broccoli to it the second time and my 7-year-old liked it so much he took the leftovers for lunch in his thermos.

The only cream I had was double cream which is thicker then heavy cream and not a liquid. It was too much because it was so rich with the butter. We ended up throwing it out after dinner. I may try it again because it was easy, but we like other alfredo recipes better.

This is EASY EASY EASY! I like to add Portobello mushrooms and garlic angel hair pasta for this particular sauce.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it's so high in calories, but we all deserve a little Alfredo every once in a while!! Thank you, Becky! Oh, one more thing--I think the best way to mix this sauce is with an electric mixer on the highest speed until it achieves the scrambled egg texture mentioned in the instructions.

My entire family loves it when I make pasta with this sauce and I love the time factor. It's so quick and easy. The only things I cange are: I only add 1/2 the cream called for and this time when I made it I added a couple of tablespoons of Hellmanns mayo. It just gave it an extra zip.

This was an excellent recipe and I did what others had posted and added a little garlic to the mix.  I went the easy route and added garlic powder, but it still turned out great.  Just a little word of warning: I did make it with broccoli, and since it absorbs water so well when cooked, stirring in the broccoli to the alfredo sauce actually turned the sauce even thinner than it was originally going to be. I used a full cup of grated cheese and still that wasn't enough. I would add more cheese and skip the broccoli next time, but still it tasted great.

This was the first time I made homemade alfredo sauce.  I loved the flavour, but thought it needed a little something else, so I needed a bit of white cheddarand it turned out nice.  THanks for the recipe

I substituted half and half for the heavy cream and ended up heating the sauce on the stove with some garlic powder.  This is a good sauce and covered a box of penne pasta.

Delish and easy.  Love the no cook.  You can get the sauce ready while the pasta cooks.  Would be nice if they told you how much pasta you need for this amount of sauce.  I doubled the recipe for a pound and sprinkled some extra cheese on each plate.  I made this for my nieces and nephews for breakfast at a sleepover and it was a big hit!!

It was good but I had to still melt it on the stove- the butter didn't mix well at room temperature.  I added a tiny bit of garlic for flavor.

This is my go to cream sauce, made exactly according to directions, never fails.  Perfect base, then add grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes or whatever we have on hand.  Also perfect!

This recipe was quick and easy. I do suggest, however, that you stay away from the really good Parmesan when making it as this tends to become a bit stringy as it melts. Using the canned Parmesan-like product from Kraft works much better.

Excellent! For a lower fat version substitute milk (2% or skim) and white American cheese for the heavy cream and butter, add Parmesan and melt slowly over low heat stirring frequently. A really quick healthy lower fat recipe is Asparagus Alfredo with capellini. Cook capellini and asparagus together in boiling water for 3.5-4 minutes. Drain and return to warm pot on low heat. Add milk, white American cheese, Parmesan and a bit of fresh chopped parsley. Stir frequently until sauce is smooth. Season with salt and white pepper. Garlic, onion and small red hot peppers (called pepperocini in Rome - not the American hot yellow pickled ones ) are optional and should be sautéed in extra virgin olive oil until onions are translucent, then added to the heating sauce. Plate, garnish with a sprinkle of Parmesan and serve immediately. Preparation time ~ approximately 10 minutes.

I used  I Can't Believe It Is Not Butter with a dab of butter  along with fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and  bit of heavy cream.  Did not measure precisely. Then, I slowly heated it.  Poured over already plated porcini and truffle ravioli.  It was awesome!  We had for main course but would be great appetizer!

Very good, very useful recipe. I love that you can mix it together while your pasta boils. I always add garlic powder, freshly ground pepper and a bit of nutmeg. Sometimes I add spinach, broccoli or cooked chicken. 

One time it was quite runny when I added it to the pasta, and I put it over very low heat and added more parm. cheese -- that fixed it.

I never get 8 main dish servings from it. It must be meant as a side dish, and it actually goes well beside a piece of chicken and a small salad.

I made this recipe for dinner to go with penne pasta.  My daughter absolutely loved it and will be packing it for her lunch tomorrow.  I, however, thought it was grainy.  I guess that's to be expected with the large amounts of powdered Parmesan cheese the recipe calls for.  Next time,  I'll try grating block Parmesan.  Other than that, it tasted good.  It beats the jarred variety.

This was certainly easy to make, and the flavor was pretty good, but it was missing something.  DH thinks it might be better if done on the stovetop because the ingredients didn't blend as well as we would have liked.

I kind of followed the recipe tngirl wrote in and melted 2 tbsp country crock, 1/3 cup heavy cream and shredded ramano (I was out of Parmesan) and I also added 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp of real bacon bits, and 1/4 cup steamed broccoli pieces.  It turned out really creamy and delish over linguine noodles with a dash of salt and pepper.

I really liked the taste of this, although I had a difficulty with it separating. I used milk instead of cream for a lighter sauce, but I don't think that was the problem. I melted my butter in the microwave because it was frozen, and I think the separation occurred because of the difference in temps between the butter and the milk. I will try this again with softer butter, it's worth another try. The flavor was delicious, and it was so easy!

This was so good and easy. I creamed the 1/2 cube butter and 1/2 C parm by hand in a small bowl while heating up 1C milk. tempered the butter/cheese with about 1/4 C warm milk created a nice melted cream then added into rest of milk. Poured over about 1# cooked cheese filled tortollini with 1/2# cubed Left over ham. Let sit 10 min while broccoli finished then ate it up. Kids loved it. almost as easy as opening a jarred alfredo sauce!! I will definetely do this again!!

This was very good; however, I had to use half and half and I doubled the recipe.  I also used fresh parmesean cheese and asiago.  It didn't mix well, so I heated and added a little flour to thicken.  It tasted a bit sweet - due to the half and half I assume.  But, overall very good.  I will follow recipe exact next time - looking forward to it.

This was awesome! I've been making different versions of alfredo sauce for years, and often have a problem with the sauce separating or getting clumpy. I made this last night and it was smooth, cheesy, and delicious! I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and a little salt and pepper. Yum!!!

So easy, so quick and so delicious.  My kids AND my husband loved it.  I halved the recipe and used skim milk instead of cream.  I also added garlic for extra flavor.

Quick and easy, but quite runny.  Will add a little Wondra next time.

Flavor is ok, but definitely very runny. Took other reviewers' advice and added garlic. Will use this basic recipe again but will need to thicken it.

The taste was good (I added a chopped clove of garlic), but the "sauce" turned out really soupy and was more like a liquid than a sauce.

This recipe was easy to make and it turned out wonderful. Best recipe for alfredo sauce I have found. I doubled the recipe because I added it to a whole pot of spaghetti.

This was definitely easy and delicious. I added garlic powder which to me seems to be a must. The sauce was pretty thin when heated. Will definitely make again for a quick lunch!

Wow, this is GOOD. Don't feel like you have to use heavy cream.  I used milk and is was wonderful.  I added a pinch of garlic, and parsley flakes and also made extra because we like our alfedo very saucy.  It seemed to cool off the pasta too much so I heated it a bit while mixing it.

Great and easy!  After following the recipe and right before adding the pasta, I added 5 slices of cooked bacon and a can of peas.  Worked great!

This is a very good basic alfredo recipe.  I was worried when I looked in the bowl and everything was separated, but when I poured it over the hot pasta, it all blended perfectly.  In a saucepan, while the noodles were cooking, I sauteed mushrooms, onion, a little garlic, and precooked shrimp with butter and olive oil.  Yum!  I mixed it all together and it was great!

This is a great and simple Alfredo Sauce.  It's quick and delicious.  I did like some people suggested and added garlic powder.  I'd been looking for an alfredo sauce and now I've found mine.

I made this recipe for the first time for a gathering of 25 family members.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  I grilled chicken tenderloins to go with the lingini and alfredo sauce.  Yum.

Idiot-proof!!!  I have an amazing knack for messing up even the easiest sauces.  Usually my problem is I boil them too long.  So ... this sauce is perfect for someone like me!  You can't screw it up!  I substituted milk for the cream, because that's all that I had.  After I added it to the hot pasta, I let it simmer and added two pinches of flour to make it thicker, and some garlic salt for a little more flavor.  It was great!  Perfect taste and consistency.  I served with tri-color rotini and chicken.

This was so incredibly easy to make!  I just had to try it when I saw that it involved no cooking at all.  I followed the recipe except for a sprinkle of garlic powder since I can never get enough garlic.  Also, I topped this with some cubes of chicken breast that I had cooked in olive oil with salt, white pepper, and more garlic powder.

The flavor on this was great. My pasta was a little too cool to melt the butter so I just put the plate with the pasta and sauce in the microwave for 30seconds. It did end up pretty thin, so I think I might add a little less cream next time and maybe a little bit of flour or something to thicken it. Will definatly do this again though!

Good starter recipe that can be modified. I used freshly grated parmasan, but dint mix well with butter, so I threw everything in a saucepan, added ground pepper, a pinch of salt cooked until cheese melted, and it still came out great.

Very good, very easy.  I bet it would be even easier if I actually followed the directions!  I forgot to put the butter out, so I softened it in the microwave, and then dumped all the cream in at once, instead of adding it slowly.  It still turned out wonderfully.  This recipe is just about the right amount for a pound of pasta.  Thanks!

I've been looking for a good alfredo sauce recipe, and this one's been the best so far! Although, if you think it needs seasoning, try a pinch of garlic salt and white pepper-it really finished it off.

Good...I was really skeptical cause the lumpy sauce doesn't look all that great but when you mix it with the pasta it melts into a really nice sauce.  I added garlic and pepper as well which made it even better.

Not the best alfredo recipe, but one of the  easiest. I added garlic powder and pepper to the sauce and that made it taste a little better.

Great easy way to make alfredo! I will def use this in the future, though I might add a little garlic...
