This was a little too moist for my taste with not enough taste to satisfy those who craved a little more "sweetness" in their cake.  Overall, not a bad recipe.

I added a creamcheese/cool whip icing and doubled the topping to spice up this recipe! The more fruit the better!

Very surprised at how moist this cake was.  I substituted mixed berry yogurt for plain.  Very good
