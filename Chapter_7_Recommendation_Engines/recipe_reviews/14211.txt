I made this for a cover dish dinner, and it did NOT last.  Everyone remarked about the flavor and how creamy it was.  It is so good.  I did change just a couple of things.  One, I left out the onion as neither my husband or myself can eat them..and it was n't missed.  Also, instead of using pickle juice and the sweet pickle, I used sweet relish.  I did increase the dressing half again, as we do not like a dry macaroni salad, and this did not get dry.  I made it the day before, and yes, it tastes better the second day after the ingredients have had a chance to sit and blend.  I put the carrots through my food processor and they were perfect for this salad.  And one little tip.  When using celery seed, rub the seeds between your palms to crush them a little.  This releases not only the aroma, but the flavor as well. Oh, and if you are making a dish that requires both onion and celery, cut the celery last, and rub some leaves, or even part of the rib on your hands.  It will remove the onion.

I made this over the holiday weekend for my family and it was a hit. The only thing I did differently was I chopped the carrot and added sweet pickle relish instead of the chopped pickles. I will make it again. The celery seed and spanish olives were nice additions.

This is a very good recipe. Multiplied it many times and made it for my daughter's wedding reception, and I received many compliments. My only question would be about the number of servings. This recipe makes between 13 and 14 cups of salad.  Unless you are feeding Paul Bunyan and his brothers, I think that's a lot more than six servings. Maybe it 's supposed to say 16?

I can't rate this yet because I didn't like what I did.  I used large elbow macaroni (that was all I had) and it was much too starchy.  I nearly doubled the wet ingredients and still a little dry (and starchy).  Unless you are having a party for a least ten big eaters I would at least half this recipe.  I have a family of four and even though I 1/2 this it will be enough for at least 3 meals.  I'm excited to try again w/ small elbow mac.  Thanks!

!!!We really love this recipe.  It does make a HUGE amount, and the dressing should be at LEAST doubled.  We leave out celery and add thawed sweet peas and cheese.  Great for cookouts.  We've made this many times and will continue to make it.

I made this with all the ingredients except the olives and bell peppers ('cause my wife doesn't care for them). I did make more of the dressing (about one and one half times more). I only had one sweet pickle left so I subed one dill pickle and a little sweet relish. I'm glad I made more dressing as it would have been to dry otherwise. The recipe as written makes a LOT(about a gallon) of salad, but it's so good it should be gone in a couple days! As far as the taste..... EXCELLENT!!! Definately five stars!

I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, and the dressing was great.  I didn't add the carrots but added fresh diced tomatoes before serving.  Used lemon juice in place of pickle juice for a bit of tartness.  Nice versatile recipe, Thanks!

This is the best recipe I found for macaroni salad. My hubby even said it's as good as his mother's! :)  It makes a lot of food. I used sweet relish instead of pickles & I used pimentos instead of olives...It turned out great! Thanks!

A great place to start!  As prior suggestions I was generous with my mayo/sour cream measurements.  The dried mustard didn't offer enough flavor so I also added 1T dijon mustard.  Instead of pickle juice I added 1T lemon juice and 1T apple cider vinegar.  I used sweet relish instead of pickle.  After tasting I felt it needed a little sweetener so I added  1T honey.  I used red pepper because I prefer it to green pepper and it really added to the variety of colors.  I did not have celery seed so I omitted.  This was delicious. My husband loved it and he is a macaroni salad lover!  I was so worried he wouldn't care for it and he just loved it! Thank you.

Great recipe Linda! I used salad macaroni, left out the olives and cut the celery seed to 1T. Wonderul! The flavors meld nicely together. Oh yeah...I also used Dijon mustard instead of ground and I chopped rather than grated the carrots. The egg adds a nice flavor as well. Thanks for sharing.

TERRIFIC, EASY recipe.  Basic and very TASTY!!!!  I used red pepper instead of green bell because it agrees with me more.  But everything else A #1. Thanks for having this on the web.  I even put tuna in it the second day - and had a whole new dish!!!

Very, very good stuff! Instead of increasing the dressing ingredients I just used 12oz. of macaroni...perfect! There was still enough to feed a small army! I used 3 eggs and a yellow bell pepper since that is what I had on hand and it was a hit...thanks!

I love this macaroni salad and have made it several times.  All of the extras -- pickles, olives, green pepper, etc give this macaroni salad great flavor.  And best of all, it's really easy to make.

This recipe took a lot of work (I have no food processor) and the results, although okay, were not outstanding.  Makes a HUGE bowl of mac salad.  Needed a LOT more sweet pickle juice (or maybe sweet relish), mustard, and less celery seed.  Good recipe to tweak to your liking.  Probably won't try again.

This was my first ever macaroni salad. I followed the recipe to the letter except for changing out yellow onion for red onion. It was fantastic! All the flavors blend together just right. Many people at our party loved it. I'll make it again for sure.

This is wonderful! I used it for my church dinner feeding 120 ppl, and everyone raved about it. the only changes i made was doubling the dressing, i used sweet pickle relish & i sprinkled on a lil bit or sugar & bacon bits! also, it makes WAY more that 6 servings. i would estimate at about 15-18 servings per recipe.

This went great with the ribs I made. I only made half a box of elbow macaroni but used the recipe amounts for everything else. I didn't have any celery, green pepper or olives. So I had to substitute some frozen peas and carrots and added some chopped roasted red peppers and a little garlic powder. It was wonderful. I almost threw some crumbled bacon in too, but didn't feel like cooking any. I will make this again and definitely add the olives some fresh carrots and peas -I love them. The red peppers gave it nice color too.

Excellent recipe. I had finished making the salad and when I tasted it, I wonder why it didn't have a kick to it. I had forgotten to add the pickle juice. Once I did that, it was totally awesome. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was terrible. I made if for a super bowl party and was very disappointed. Man, I can't believe all the good reviews on this - I was expecting something worth while eating. Very disappointed!

i used all of the celery seed called for and loved it.  i increased the olives the second time around.  i think this tastes best on the second day -- once thoroughly chilled.  will use this again and again.

I have been looking for a great macaroni salad recipe for a while and this one is wonderful.  My husband loved it.  I did have to add more dressing as it did get dry with the full amount of macaroni used in the salad.  Otherwise, a keeper.

This was really good macaroni salad.  I made a few modifications for personal preference.  I omitted the bell pepper and olives.  Cut the recipe in half which was still a lot of salad.  This is definitely a keeper.  My husband claimed it as one of his favorites.

I made this as a trial run for a friends shower.  It turned out great!! I had a neighbor taste it for me so that I could get an honest opinion.  Her son actually took the plate and ran!!LOL. She also asked for some for her husband, since I had a ton of it and my husband doesn't like it.  Thanks so much for an easy recipe!

I love this macaroni salad.  For years I have said my grandmother's is the best, but this one is definitely better.  I halved this recipe and it was still enough to serve six though, so I agree with others who have said the servings are off.  The only changes I made were leaving out the olives and substituting sweet pickle relish for the sweet pickles and juice and using celery salt rather than celery seed (all I had on hand).  It turned out great.  I will use this forever as my macaroni salad recipe!!!  Thank you.

Delicious! Just what a macaroni salad should taste like. I didn't use the carrot and I only put in one teaspoon of celery seed, and it was still very good!

This salad is pretty ordinary, kind of a little bland. I gave it 3 stars because it is very easy to make and with more seasoning could be great. I am glad I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut the recipe in half; it still made a lot! We ate it for dinner with bbq ribs and baked beans. I plan to mix the leftover salad with tuna and more seasoning, so at least I get 2 meals out of it!

This was totally awesome. I made this for my whole family at our Easter BBQ and everyone loved it. Say hello to our new summer specialty.    I made a few small changes: made double the sauce, used lots of relish instead of pickles and juice, added a bit of yellow mustard,and used black olives instead cause i really hate green ones. i kept all of the celery seed in there, slightly crushed like someone else said, and even added a little celery salt. I am still in awe of how great this tasted since i dont really like mac salad that much in the first place. thanks so much!!!

I did not like this very much.  It seemed to have too much celery taste in it.  It needed more sweetness and creaminess.  I ended up adding more sour cream and more mayonaise just so I could eat it.  I will try a different recipe next time.

I made this recipe and found several over-powering ingridients...the sweet pickles ,sweet pickle juice, pimento stuffed olives and sour cream was all you tasted . I then made it again ommiteing the sweet stuff and olives then used less sour cream and it was great, then on a serving ,a touch of dill weed (fresh) and it was outstanding!

This salad was great! Like others, I did change a few things.  I didn't use the measurements posted at all, just "eye balled it", and I omitted the olives.  I also used plain mustard, dill pickle juice instead of sweet and diced up a few pickles in there.  Other then that the salad is amazing...love the dressing! I think I've found a new favourite!

Great flavour, but I agree with other reviewers who recommend either decreasing the pasta to 12oz or increasing the sauce ingredients by half to get a better consistency. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for a cookout before I even tried it and it was a huge hit!  I loved it too!  When I went to make it again, I couldn't find the recipe and I was really bummed out.  I'm so glad I found it again!  Thanks for posting it!

Very good. A little spicey though. I will cut down on the celery seed(maybe it's a typo) next time. But was a great change, tangy, and the different ingredients work together wonderfully. Hopefully it will go over well at my sons birthday party.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I will agree with other users in regards to the serving size - the serving for six can actually feed a lot more.  I used a little less bell pepper and onion than instructed, and it still turned out great.

Everyone loved it, thank you!

I made this for a family barbecue and everyone really enjoed it.  This was the first time I have attempted to make a "macaroni salad".  The mayo mixed w/sour cream makes a very creamy sauce (a nice "tang" to it as well). I actually increased the dressing mix by 1/2 and this made the salad a little bit more moist. I omitted the onion, olives and celery seed for some do not like them.  I used sweet relish instead of sweet pickle and also added an extra two tablespoons of sweet relish to salad. I can't wait to make this easy and wondreful recipe again.  It will be on our menu often!

I enjoyed this macaroni salad because of the different vegetables and the sweet pickle. My husband said he prefers traditional mac salad. Good recipe with a lot of different flavors.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2002 and my family enjoyed it very much.  I believe this may be the first one I have made myself but have eaten many.  It was good but takes a while (at least for me) to cut all the stuff, etc.

Green olives are a good twist. I skipped the onions and came out with a yummy salad.  Different than the normal high mayonnaise type. Good for getting a lot of veggies in.

Just go ahead and double the amount of mayo and sourcream. You won't regret it. Delicious. Much better than store bought macaroni salad. I usually cut the recipe in half except for the mayo and sour cream. I like the carrots finely grated.

I followed it exactly and have two major complaints: (1) WAY too much celery seed. Next time I would cut this in half at least because all I could taste was celery seed with every bite. (2) it really was too crunchy, so I think the celery and/or green bell pepper should also be cut in half. Additionally, the olives seemed sort of pointless to me so can easily leave them out and get the same salad.

I've made a lot of mac salad but this is by far the best.  The ONLY thing I did different was to use Famous Daves Signature Spicy Pickle Clips for the pickle juice & sweet pickle.   You gotta try it!  YUMMY!

Super delicous!  The sauce makes this salad!  I followed what other users said and put more dressing to noodle ratio and it was great.  I changed a lot of the other things like the celery and such that went in it and it still turned out great.  Thanks. :)

We didn't get too crazy over this Macaroni Salad but I might try again leaving out the olives, using only 2 teaspoons of celery seed and add a little garlic powder.

I was asked to bring macaroni salad for a Mother's Day gathering,and I new my plain old mac.salad would be boring.I searched this site and decided on this one.It was a huge hit! very flavorful,not difficult,besides the chopping, and the sour cream dressing was much better than the ordinary mayo.I'm glad I decided on this one and will continue to make it for all gatherings from now on.

Well, I am being generous with a 4 as I had to really tweak this recipe. I loved using both sour cream and mayo, however, I cut the macaroni to half and I still had to add more mayo/sour cream. I cannot imagine using the full 16 oz of macaroni! I omitted the olives and carrots. Thanks for the post.

Liked the recipe, good base to start from. I added more mayo, more mustard, some honey, some hotsauce and only did 1 tbsp of celery seeds, instead of two. 
Good, good!

This was excellent.  I read the reviews before making so I did 1 1/2 times the dressing.  The only thing I changed was I added sweet relish.  It was a hit and I have been asked to make it again and again.

I was looking for a macaroni salad that I could count on to taste the same each time I made it.  This one fits the bill. As a rule, I make a new recipe exact the first time, then make changes.  I would not change a thing on this one...it's great!! and everyone loves it.  Thanks for sharing.

I have looked for years for a good macaroni salad and I finally found it when I made this one. I made it for my daughter's birthday party and it was a HUGE hit with everyone, even the kids. I used sweet relish instead of the green olives and I also added some red bell pepper. This is definatly a keeper. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I've made this recipe for two different get-togethers and it was well received at both.  I do not like salads that are dripping with mayonnaise.  The combination of mayo and sour cream makes this much tastier.  The green olives also make a great change from a regular macaroni salad.  I do have to agree with a previous reviewer that this can't possibly be only 6 servings as I used an 18-cup bowl and it was more than 3/4 full.

Pretty good noodle salad. I used only 2 tsp of celery seed, ommitted the olives, used red & green bell peppers, miracle whip instead of mayo, and used lemon juice instead of the pickle juice. Everyone seemed to enjoy this one and its versatile enough that you can use whatever veggies you want. Thanks Linda.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly as written and thought the celery seed was overpowering.  I have made it many times since and have either omitted the celery seed or used just a teaspoon and love it.

This macaroni salad is delicious! I followed the recipe but omitted the green olives.  This salad has such a fresh and clean flavor and the celery seed is so nice!  I think I would add more of either the pickle juice or pickles next time for more of a sweet tangy flavor but other than that and just my taste buds, this salad is great!

I have been trying to find a mac salad without sugar, this went over really well.  The only changes I made was using red and yellow peppers, knob onions, a touch of garlic and celery salt. Additionally, I used plain greek yogurt to sub for the sour cream to cut the fat and add some protein.  There were no leftovers. Making this again for the fourth!

Was okay. I think it would have been a lot better with less celery seed. Too strong of taste. If i make it again i'd maybe add a few dashes only.

I thought this was good but not outstanding a little too much celery seed took over the taste.  I may try next time but cut back on both of the celery and seed.

Needs sliced radishes, but apart from that, it stands without alteration. I loved the addition of celery seed and sweet pickle, although I did tweak that component slightly. I added the pickle and omitted the sweet pickle juice. It's actually quite similar to my family recipe, except that my family recipe contains tuna fish, which I have recently become allergic to, much to my dismay. Definitely, absolutely, and under all circumstances, do not add dill to this. It's fine as it is without making it taste like soap flakes.

Very good base allowing room for tweeking the recipe to your tase and pantry supplies! I used whole wheat pasta....(the only way to go).  I dusted the salad with paprika for a little color.

Recipe is pretty good, but calls for way more celery seed than is needed. I believe two teaspoons would be more reasonable. Makes a lot of macaroni salad!

As suggested by HEBH I also made some modifications.  I doubled the amount of mayonaise and sour cream.  In addition to the ground mustard I added dijon mustard (2 tsp.).  I doubled the amount of sweet pickle juice.  I added probably about a cup of chopped sweet pickles.  I omitted the pimento-stuffed green olives.  I also subsituted a red bell for a green bell pepper.  I added a tbsp or two of honey. Yummmmmmmmmmm.

I found this to be delicious.  I only used one tablespoon of celery seed though because it's not my favorite spice.  Plan ahead because there is a lot of chopping involved in this recipe, BUT worth it.

I made this for a group barbecue, and everyone seemed to like it alot.  The mayo mixed w/ the sour cream makes a very creamy sauce (a nice "tang" to it as well).  I omitted some of the items the recipe called for, just because I didn't have them on hand (the green pepper,celery seed & sweet pickle) and it still came out tasting great.  I also added approximately a tsp. of "all purpose" salad seasonings (contained onion, parsley, oregano, celery salt), then I sprinkled bacon bits over the top as a garnish and was told that added some good flavor.

THIS IS AWESOME!!!!  I made this for tomorrow 4th of July 2015 and I can breath a sy of relief!!  My macaroni salad has always come out dry no matter what I did to it, it was dry.  So today I thought I would look to see what was available.  This was the first one I came across and it's not DRY!!  Thank you for sharing!! Happy 4th to all

The only thing I did differently was switch out the green pepper (I didn't have any) with a chopped cucumber (I had the English cuke).  This is good and I will make it again.  This would be good for a big get together as it makes quiet a bit.

I had everything but the peppers so I substituted an English cuke and celery.  It was a little bland for our taste so I added smoked paprika and more salt than it called for.  I also cut the recipe in half and it still made a big bowl for us to eat.

I knew the dressing would not be enough for the amount of pasta, so I doubled it, and I did not even mix in the full 16oz of pasta at the very end of mixing. Additionally, I did not add as much celery seed as it calls for just because I thought it was wayyyy too much. Other than that, this recipe was great! I think I added more pickle juice too because I like my macaroni salad sweet. Great for a barbeque!

Too much celery seed not enough pickle.  The pickle was easy to correct but not the celery seed.  The amount of dressing seemed fine but we like it a little dry.

This is good the way it is.  I'm looking for something a little different, thought this might be it, but it wasn't.  It was a good salad, just thought it was still missing a little something.  Will likely try it again and work with it a bit. Maybe a little less mayo or sour cream?

I liked this recipe.  The only thing I had to take out was the olives.  The wife would not eat it otherwise.  Overall, a lot of good flavors in this recipe.  I see a lot of other people changed the recipe to suite their tastes and preferences.  Some day when I feel like eating a couple of pounds of macaroni salad by myself, I'll make it as is, but not today.

I didn’t add the olives but otherwise made this to the recipe.  I will definitely make it again but with less celery seed - maybe 1tbsp instead of 2 and more pickles.

This is very good. Because I was making it for two, I used 4 oz of macaroni, or 1/4 of the amount recommended by the recipe. Rather than use a 1/4 measure of the dressing, I made half the amount and I am pleased I did. 1/4 would not have been enough. I also added more olives, because I like them, but it would pay not to overdo this. This is a recipe you can easily make to your own specifications. I would perhaps use chunks of ham sometimes, or salami just to add a little more body if this was to be a main meal. Even so, just on its own, it is certainly worth making again.

In refridgerator cooling now. Haven't tasted yet but just wanted to say (for those complaining about being TOO dry) I used 16oz, uncooked Macaroni with  Miracle Whip (1 cup) & (1/2 cup) Sour Cream, It's plenty moist & creamy for my tastes as I don't like "soupy" Mac. salads. Left out olives & will update when I eat some.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it. Even my husband who doesn't like macaroni salad couldn't help sneaking a bowl before the bbq. I made as directed, aside from a few changes based solely on what i had in the fridge. Used red and green peppers, left out the olives and carrots, and used sweet pickle relish. Also added a little smoked paprika. I know many reviewers suggested increasing the dressing, but the amount called for ended up being perfect for us as we dislike "wet" salads. I will make again, next time with some black olives added in. Thanks for posting, great recipe!

I left out the eggs. Used only light mayo no sour cream, and left out the relish and pickle juice. And used red pepper. It was still delicious but the pepper and celery seed were much stronger as a result. I’d need to add the relish or cut down the  pepper a little next time.  Great recipe overall.

I loved this pasta salad. I left out the celery seeds (I was out) and the olives (this salad was delicious without them but I don't think I would enjoy it with olives) and substituted pickle relish for the sweet pickle and juice. My family liked it. I used the vegetables it suggested, although I think red bell pepper, zucchini, or new peas would all work well in this salad. I will make this again!

Mostly made as is with minor substitutions such as peas instead of boiled eggs but the dressing was too tart. I only used 2 tsp. Instead of 2 Tbs. of celery seed and thought it was still a little much. I ended up putting a little sugar in the salad to tone down the tartness. I don’t know that I’ll make this one again. But my 9 yr old granddaughter liked it and so does everyone whose tasted it so far so maybe it’s just me:)

I make this recipe often and it never last long. The only changes I make is I don't use the carrots or the olives and I use pimentos we are mayo lovers so I add more mayo. I highly recommend this recipe it is easy to make.

I was searching for a recipe similar to the way my Mom used to make macaroni salad -- she rarely ever wrote down her recipes. This is very close to her version and it is good.  She did not add the sour cream, however, and as we are not sour cream fans in my house, neither did I.  I compensated for this by simply adding more mayo.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the proportions are a bit off.  I used  only 1/2 a standard box of elbow macaroni and had a big mixing bowl full of macaroni salad.  We ate it for several days.  The amount of dressing  called for in the recipe produced too dry a mixture.  I had to increase the overall amount by at least another 1/2 cup.  I also thought the number of hard boiled eggs was too much , unless you really want more of an egg salad.  I halved the amount of eggs and, even with the quantity of pasta I had, it was a nice balance of flavors. It also needed, in my opinion, a bit more salt than was called for. The basics are all there -- but this is  definitely a "taste and correct"  sort of recipe to produce the amount of creaminess and the balance of flavors that you prefer.

This was a good recipe, we liked it a lot.   I left out the olives (my wife's request) and the red peppers (I can't eat them raw) but it was still very flavorful and good.   I usually do not like a very "wet" macaroni salad as I am not a huge fan of mayonnaise, but this was just a bit too dry.  My wife added ended up doubling the sour cream amount and it was (to us) perfect.   Nice recipe - thanks for posting it!

I made this recipe just for a lunch snack for the house. I saw all the reviews about how dry it is so before mine could even get dry all i added was olive oil. The flavor still soaks together and it doesn't dry out. Thanks for sharing this one. I was looking for a simple pasta salad and I've found it.

This salad has become a staple at our kids birthday parties. We made it exact with exception of leaving green olives out 2nd time around. We have had mixed reviews about the olives, some loved them in and some did not. I prefer without the olives but the rest of the ingredients mesh well together and makes for a great salad!!

I left out the olives and celery seed (didn't have it) but other than that followed it to the letter.  I prefer a dressing that is cut with sour cream, I also do that with potato salad.  Very yummy.

Used  8 oz dry macaroni (that was too much).  Used Dijon mustard instead of ground mustard.  Could probably have used 1/2 tsp-1 tsp instead of just a 1/4 tsp.  Instead of sweet pickle juice, I used 1 TBSP lemon juice and 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar.
Used 1 TBSP celery seed.  Easy on the onion if it's strong and fresh.  Did not put in green olives or sweet pickle or green pepper or diced tomatoes.  This is one of those salads that can be versatile and put in what you like.

Halved everything except dressing. Didn't have celery seed so used dill seed from the bottom of the pickle jar. Hated it! Put it in the fridge anyway, just had with dinner and LOVED IT! A big hit here. It really needs a few hours in the fridge for flavours to blend. I refrigerated about 5 hours, thankful I didn't throw it out lol.

Everything comes together for a delicious macaroni salad! The next time I'll set aside some of the dressing to add later for more creaminess.

I haven't made macaroni salad in a while and decided to try this recipe out because of the sour cream.  It certainly lightened up the recipe and added a nice zing. I would make a little more of the dressing next time though, as it was a tad dry.  I used Dijon mustard instead of ground.  It got raves at my party & I will make it again

Big hit with the family.  I made a half batch and it was still too much.  I added cooked chicken to the remainder the next day for a very successful and delicious main dish salad.

5.30.16   Holy smokes does this make a lot of macaroni salad, enough to feed an army!  IMO this will give you ten servings, at least (and I’m not talking tiny servings, either) rather than six.  I liked many things about this salad.  The sweetness of the chopped pickles and juice contrasted nicely with the saltiness of the olives.  I also liked the dry ground mustard (I used Coleman’s®) instead of regular mustard in the dressing, gave it a little tang.  Changed just a couple things...I used Miracle Whip instead of  mayo (family preference for mac salad), and I cut back on the celery seed, since I thought that amount might be overwhelming.  Linda, nice recipe!

I left out the sweet pickle, but used everything else. I think the sour cream added a nice creaminess to it.  The mustard enhanced the flavor.

This turned out great!!  I substituted cucumber and tomato for bell pepper and egg because I'm not a fan of those ingredients.  I took out the seeds and diced them.  I didn't have any ground mustard and forgot to add mustard.  I think the mustard would have given it a little zing that would have been nice but it was fab anyway.  Great recipe!!

Really really good! I added black olives instead of the green, and I used a little bit of every color of pepper to give it a nice presentation and it worked out perfect! I also added stone ground whole wheat mustard like 3 Tablespoons and that really gave it a nice kick!

My husband and I loved this recipe. He is a picky eater and enjoyed it. I did not add olives, celery seed and ground mustard because I didnt have any, but I did use yellow mustard and it came out great!! I also didnt measure anything I just eyed it. I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I adjusted the servings on the recipe to 4, and the amount of pasta was still too much. So, I used all ingredients on the adjusted 4 serving recipe, but I reduced the pasta to just 1 cup dry.  That worked, and the result was great!

Good, but does need adjustments per the other reviews to make it moister.
