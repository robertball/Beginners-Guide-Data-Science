I thought this recipe was good, however, I seem to always modify even the best recipes.  I added garlic and red,yellow, orange peppers to the chicken while browning.  I also added dijon mustard to the chicken/bread crumb mixture for that extra kick of flavor.  All in all, pretty good.

This was very easy, different, and tasty.  You can also vary the spices and ingredients.  I has some chopped nuts on hand so I tossed them in as well.  I'll be making this again soon!

the sauce was a little too salty.  The roll was bland enough so the kids liked it.

I thought this was very bland even though I added green peppers, garlic and onion powders. Didn't have any ground chicken or turkey in the house so I used beef and I'm glad I did or else I feel it really would have been tasteless. The sauce screamed of salt, so I used leftover gravy from a rib roast I made the other night. I'll try this again but possibly use sloppy joe type of ingredients to give it some pizazz.

This was good.  But I did make some changes.  
Didn't have puff pastry-but did have phyllo, so I used that.  I've never used ground chicken before, so this my first attempt, and it turned out great.  I added more bread crumbs, 1c. because I was expecting "moldable" to be more like a meat loaf, it didn't hurt anything.  I used 2 onions, cause I like onions.  The gravy was great, and super easy.  Also, in my opinion very necessary, it would have been pretty blah without it.

This was a hit with my husband...  Super easy to make and the gravy was amazing!  I used ground beef instead of chicken.  Next time I'll use a little less meat.

The gravey for this meal was absolutely amazing! It's going straight into my personal recipe book! But the pastry was so-so. It tasted good, but not anything I ever have to have again.

I tried this with ground beef and I should have sauteed spinach and added it in there. Ok I maybe dense but I did not get the whole "roll it and tuck it". The meat was spilling out so I layed the pastry and spread the beef around and the last 2 sheets I put on top and baked. It got stuck on the bottom which was a bummer.

LOVED the mushroom sauce!! I added a little more wine. Did not realize how easy it is to make gravy!!!

The Sauce was 5 stars! The chicken was 3 stars. I used ground turkey and after reading all the reviews and added garlic and some red pepper flakes. But it still lacked something. With the right seasoning this recipe would be sooo good!

This dish is simple to make and very delicious. If you have leftovers they're even great.

I halved the recipe and perhaps didn't measure my onion well. It seemed overly onion-y. But still it was pretty good. Nice for something different and I may make again sometime but don't think I'll add it to the rotation. Also, it was easy to make. That's always nice. I'm slow at cooking with the prep work and whatnot as I do not have any fancy knives or equipment or a whole lot of experience, but this came together quickly and looked nice and tasted good.

Great "quick dinner" idea!  Thought the filling needed a little more flavor so I added finely chopped red pepper and some italian seasoning!

This is a great recipe; very versatile and quick to make.  I used ground beef as that was what I had on hand, ended up looking like a sausage roll.  I added lots of spice to the meat; I love thyme and rosemary. I also added seasoning salt and garlic powder.  I added a hand-full of raisins as an after thought (doesn't sound good, but the raisins tasted AWESOME, I will add twice as many raisins next time).  I have never grated an onion before, and frankly, I don't think onions were made to be grated!  Next time I will dice the onion.  The sauce was a bit too salty; I would add the onion soup mix to taste.  I watered mine down and added a bit more wine.  Hubby loved it, and said it should become added to our regulars.
