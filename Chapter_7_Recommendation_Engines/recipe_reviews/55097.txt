Just tried this & am obviously doing something wrong because when I took them out of the frier, there was hardly any cheese inside the breadcrumbs!  I gave them 3 minutes as suggested.  Did I not coat them enough?  Please advise as I know I can do it right! :-)

I was anxious to try this as a local restaurant serves a favorite of deep fried stilton with cranberry sauce. Unfortunately the flavor of the brie doesn't hold up to the frying. Perhaps a larger chunk of brie or stronger cheese would work better for this recipe.

This was pretty darn good.  You really have to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn, though.

Yummy! I pan fried the brie in vegetable oil--a deep fryer is definitely not necessary. Be sure to use plain bread crumbs; I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and the added flavor clashed just a little with the brie. Served with cranberry sauce on multi-grain baguette was perfect!

This was pretty good. I added a pinch of italian seasoning and basil to the egg mixture, as well as the pepper and salt. Would be better with a different type of cheese, but I'll definitely make the egg mixture/breading again for other cheeses. Make sure you press the cheese into the bread crumbs really good on all 6 sides of the cube, otherwise the breading can tend to fall off a bit.

Absolutely delicious. I added lots of salt and didn't use the cranberry. The description of the recipe says it all!

These are delicious.  Put the Brie in the freezer for 30 minutes before cutting into pieces. I coated them lightly in flour before dipping in the egg.  Used panko bread crumbs instead.  After coating put in fridge for recommended time.  Only took 2 minutes to cook in fryer.  Served with jelopeno jelly.  Will make again.

I also ended up with hardly any cheese inside the breadcrumbs.  Where did it all go?

I used a wok pan and filled it so half os the breaded Brie was covered, fried for a few minutes then turned over until they were golden brown.  I also coated in plain flour before dipping in egg and took them out of the pan when golden.
