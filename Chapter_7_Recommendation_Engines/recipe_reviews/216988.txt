This is a really good recipe. The only thing I did was cut the cinnamon and allspice down a bit. I felt that using 1 whole teaspoon of allspice overwhelmed the fruit flavors in this pie.

Amazing. Was told by several people who ate it that it was THE BEST pie they had ever eaten. I followed the other reviews and cut the allspice down. The only other change was that I added some rum as I was mixing the fruit, about a couple tablespoons. (Before I looked up a recipe I remembered that when a friend had made it in the past her recipe had called for rum, so since I had already bought a whole bottle, I figured I might as well use it in the recipe!) Then, of course, simply had some extra liquid that I left in the bottom of the mixing bowl when I transferred everything into the pie pan, to keep the mixture from being too liquid.

I have been making strawberry rhubarb pies (my favorite) for many years.  I have to say this is one of the best I have eaten.  I omitted the allspice, I don't really like the taste of it. The brown sugar and cinnamon really brought out a nice flavor. And the proportion of rhubarb to strawberry was just right.

The BEST ever strawberry-rhubarb pie.  I made it several years ago and then the recipe was lost during a divorce & several moves.   Was so glad to find it on AR ... this time around I switched it up & for the sugar on the crust I mixed white & brown sugar with some spices...yummy

Taste is ok. Not impressed that even after adding the extra corn starch, it was still "juicy" and ended up overflowing so bad that it stuck to the pan it was on. What a mess to try and clean up.

Very tasty but the cooking time was not enough because the rhubarb was crisp.

I cooked it for 30 minutes more and it was wonderful

I brushed the bottom crust with beaten egg white. I sauteed the rhubarb with some sugar, strained and let cool to reduce moisture. I used two tablespoons of corn starch. I used Turbinado sugar to coat the lattice after brushing with milk. I used all white sugar and a tablespoon of molasses because I didn't have any brown sugar, and it tasted great. I did not use allspice. I let cool several hours before slicing and it all turned out fantastic.

Was quite easy I also did not put as much allspice as recipe called for. Husband loved it. Next time I might add extra strawberry next time because he said the rhubarb flavor was a little too strong.

I just added a dash of cinnamon instead of the full amount, and skipped the allspice. Next time I think I'll use an egg wash on the crust (which I didn't lattice, I just used some small cookie cutters to cut a few pieces out) because it didn't brown like I wish, but I'm also at 7200' altitude. I was concerned I wouldn't like it as much as my great aunt's who would make a rhubarb pie for me every year for my birthday, but this was fabulous - not too sweet at all (I don't like super sweet pies). This recipe goes in the Keeper pile!

I listened to the words of those who went before me: First, I doubled the cornstarch and drained the whole bunch of fruit before putting it in the shell; I also painted the shell with egg wash first. Then, I sprinkled more cornstarch, flour and bits of butter on top, covered it and egg washed the top. Then I sprinkled coarse sugar on it and baked it as suggested. I let it cool on the shelf and stored it there as well to maintain the bonds that the cornstarch created. In the mix, I added nutmeg and allspice but just a tad and drizzled a little lime over it. My hubby loves SRPie, so I could have mixed mud in it and he'd have raved about it. But I liked it as well. So, there you have it.

Great recipe! I won a rhubarb pie contest with it. I think next time I'll try adding a little coriander and see what happens.

I made this like written until I realized I didn't have enough strawberries so added a bag of frozen raspberries to it and made it a 9X13 pan cause my pie plates were packed! I added the spices and as one reader had written  on here was going to add rum but realized that was packed up for moving too ! So I added some Pineapple schnapps! Everybody thought it was amazing!!!
