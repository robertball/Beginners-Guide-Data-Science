I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS DRESSING!!  I forgot to pick up the pectin, so that got exempted.  I just blended the oil alone for about 45 seconds, and added the other ingredients (so that it wouldn't seperate).  Don't let the corn syrup scare you, as I almost didn't try this because I thought that ingredient was odd.  Thanks Barb!!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I have a suggestion for all those who's dressing came out watery.  Try mixing all but the oil together, then slowly pour the oil in as the blender is running.  I have made good season's Italian dressing in the blender this way for many years and have never had to shake the jar again, even after being refrigerated for a couple of days.

This is a beautiful recipe! Even my husband loved it and he's a devoted Ranch Dressing fan! I chose to use olive oil and took the advise of another review and blended the oil alone for a while and then added the other ingredients. It was so tangy and tickled the tongue! I have lots of company coming this month and I'm making it for everyone of them. Thank you so much!

I agree, this was tasteless and watery, not at all like the Olive Garden salad dressing. I found it to be a disappointment.

This turned out awful!  Mine, too, was like water.  Not only did the mixture separate, but it was also a cloudy, milky color - nothing at all like a vinaigrette.

This was pretty good.  It really does taste quite similar to O.G's -  wish I had seen this recipe when I was craving their salad while pregnant (and lived 45 min away).  I'm not loving the corn syrup, as we try to avoid GMO ingredients.  Might experiment with agave nectar or honey next time.

Great taste and plenty easy to make with items on hand.  Used this for a Chicken Marinade, also on this site.  Will try it as dressing next time.

I was really happy with the look and taste of this dressing, but the consistency was way off!  Mine was just like water.  It all blended nicely together but just sunk to the bottom of the bowl.  So, I marinated some cucumber slices in this rather than using it for a dressing.  Next time I will take MC's advice and blend the dressing alone first and then add the other ingredients.

This is easy and very tasty. I did cut way back on the salt. I only put in 1 teaspoon and it was plenty for me. I do agree it is restaurant-quality. I'll definitely make this one again!

It is indeed similar to the dressing at Olive Garden. Similar, but not exact. I also subbed olive oil for veggie oil. Really enjoyed this.

I like to substitute olive oil for vegetable or canola oil.  It is thicker and a nice consistency.

This dressing is comparable to some very good Italian dressings in local Italian restaurants.  It is important to use the pectin for thickness & the corn syrup for taste.  The dressing is not overly sweet, but the slight sweetness takes away the sharpness of the Italian seasonings.  Very easy to mix in a jar if a blender for food processor isn't handy.

This recipe makes a great dressing.  I blend the lemon juice and vinegar alone for about 20 seconds, and then let that rest for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also like to use plain old distilled white vinegar rather than white wine vinegar because I think it tastes more like the dressing at that famous Italian restaurant.

I replaced the corn syrup by adding honey. It turned out great.
Also added a pinch of black pepper.

This was great! Im so glad I made it. Because of all the mixed reviews, I was afraid mine would fail like so many others did. I was wrong. Tasted very similar to Olive Gardens. So refreshing and delicious! I followed others' ideas and blended the vinegar and lemon juice first, then added the rest. Definitley a keeper!

This turned out like watered down milk (in appearance).  The taste was NOTHING like an Italian restaurant.

Hello people...  The pectin is a thickening agent and CANNOT be left out.  If it is, the dressing will be watery and you will NOT like the consistency.   The taste is great..

This was pretty good.  Although I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any lemons around, and it would probably be better with it.

Like everyone else, I found that it separates in the fridge, but isn't that true of most pre-made dressings you buy at the market?  Just a little shake fixes the problem.  We don't have pectin or corn syrup readliy available here (as far as I know and I have looked) so I omitted the former and substituted honey 1:1 for the latter with no troubles.  It was a bit more of a creamy consistency than I expected, but I think it's a good dressing.  Used it on a pasta salad and it was perfect for it - just the right tanginess and flavor.

This is a great recipe - very tasty!  I substituted 6 packets of Splenda instead of corn syrup.  I did use fresh squeezed lemon but will try reconstituted next time.

This is really good and is pretty close to what I've been looking for.  I've made it three times now and find that it separates to some extent whether or not the oil is processed first, though doing that does seem to make it a little less prone to.  Either way, the separating is not a problem at all to me.  I cut back the water to 2 tablespoons the last time to keep the flavor less diluted.  And omitting the cheese makes it a very nice white wine vinaigrette, which I use to marinate warm potatoes for potato salad.  This is so quick and easy to make - I'll always keep some on hand.

I liked the creative approach to this recipe.  I found it a bit acidic for my taste but will adjust for that in the future.  For those of you who had trouble with the emulsion/consistency. I can think of three possible reasons that you had problems.  First, did you use all of the ingredients?  If you did not use the right proportions and left out the pectin, you will not get the same results.  Second, did you really give it a good mix to get the emulsion started?  As we all should know, oil, vinegar (and oil) need encouraging to get along!  Third, did you let it sit refrigerated for at least an hour?  This time allows the pectin to help thicken the emulsion and for the flavors to blend.  I would also like to address the comment that said they would not use corn syrup because they don’t use GMOs and might use agave or honey instead.  I don’t know what kind of corn syrup that you buy, but it is nit usually GMO.

I just happened to have some pectin onhand, which I think is the secret to holding this all together. few substitutions, used olive oil, and garlic powder. I think fresh garlic may go bad too quickly. And I didn't have corn syrup so I threw a good splash of honey in. love it, tastes amazing and so much healthier than store bought salad dressing.

I didn't add the water and because I'm against corn syrup, I used REAL maple syrup! If you don't have Romano cheese, use parmesan :)

Did not have pectin or cheese but made it anyway and it was great.  I had to use dark corn syrup as that was all I had and I was nervous but it totally worked.  Weird!  I am making it to use on pasta salad and it tastes great on the broccoli already without even being refrigerated yet!  I'll make it again for sure.

Very easy dressing to make, and the whole family liked it. I enjoyed using grated parmesan cheese. And just left out the pectin.

I made this when I realized I had no dressing in the house and now I will never buy it again! Darrell said he liked it better than any bottled we have ever tried.
*I used garlic powder, didn't have pectin and was to lazy/hungry to blend, still came out great! 
Thanks for taking the time to post this recipe.

It is a very nice dressing. I left out the corn syrup and pectin and changed the salt from one TBSP to one tsp.

There are eight people in my family. It is so hard to find dressings that my whole everyone likes, someone is always unhappy. They all loved this one, it is definitely a keeper! I couldn't find my pectin, so I left that out. I also replaced the cheese with parmesan cheese. It was glorious!

I skip the pectin and corn syrup. I use this as a marinade. I mix the ingredients, and immediate throw on top of chicken. About 2 hours and your chicken is good to go on the grill.

I loved this dressing, it was very good. Be careful with the oregano,depending on what kind you have it can easily overpower everything else. I didn't have pectin and I used sugar (dissolved into the vinegar)instead of corn syrup so it wasn't very thick -just toss it in your salad just before you serve if you make it like I did. Tasted just like I remember a famous Italian Resteraunt chain serves. Thanks!

So I am guilty of not using pectin, and am going to store to see if I can find it, tastes great, just thin.  Also I have subsisted minced garlic for powdered because I read from a chef that fresh garlic changes. But I enjoyed making this, most ingredients I had in the pantry.
