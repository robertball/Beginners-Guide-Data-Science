This was a good martini recipe. I also like using Green Apple Schnapps with Butterscotch Schnapps for a Caramel Apple Martini. I garnish with a sliver of green apple, and sometimes even dip it into melted caramel to enhance the presentation -- YUM!

Green Apple Martinis can only taste like the Jolly Rancher candies if you use Apple Pucker.
That is an awesome drink! Not even Apple Bol comes close!

I think this recipe is a mistake. It tasted just like a Midori Sour. There was no green apple taste at all. I think the author left out green apple liqueor.

I don't really like martinis that much, but this was a very good drink. A little less sweet&sour would make it perfect.

This drink is fruity, smooth, and sexy. Oh, and it glows, too. :) Seriously, if you want a fruity drink that has the tones of a martini with the smoothness of a pina colada, make this one tonight!

I used apple schnapps instead of the midori (I think that must be mistake in the recipe) but I didn't have green apple schnapps. I think I'll make another tonight, using TMoore's suggestion of adding butterscotch shnapps.
