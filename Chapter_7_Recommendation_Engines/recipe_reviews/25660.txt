This is a very old, traditional German recipe and is an acquired taste. Here are a couple of hints - use a light beer, nothing stout; try something cheap! This lessens the beer taste considerably!! Also, add a little cinnamon - that's very traditional - 1/2 tsp should do it.

All I could taste was beer!  While normally that is a good thing...in this case it was not!  Beer was the only flavor, I even added garlic and some other flavorings and it still tasted bad.

We reduced the amount of beer we put in and it was STILL too much. It didn't taste like anything except for stale, hot beer.
