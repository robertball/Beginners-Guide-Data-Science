I made these for a derby party and they were a huge hit!  They were very time consuming, and I wouldn't make them for any reason other than a special occasion, but it was worth the effort.  The only thing I changed was using about a half of an onion instead of shallots.  I couldn't find shallots - I can't imagine that it would have made the recipe any better - already great!  The fresht thyme really contributed to the recipe.
