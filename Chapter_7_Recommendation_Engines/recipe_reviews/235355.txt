This dish is so rich and meaty. The meat is tender, the aroma of it baking is to die for. I accidentally - as I had been looking at lots of recipes - opened a can of tomato sauce so added a cup of that and also increased wine to one cup. Served with garlic mash and extra garlic in dish. It is good for you! I'd give this a 5.

I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I used 3 dashes of Worcestershire sauce  with a dollop of raw honey and I forgot to add the cinnamon but the dish still got rave reviews from my dinner guests. I'll definitely make this again!

I have made this a couple times now, and it turned out perfect.   I served it with wild rice and a green salad,  I used four lamb shanks, and it fed my family of 6 very well, they just loved it!  I didn’t have any red wine  so I used white wine instead. I also added an additional Tbsp if flour to the gravy at the end to make it just a bit thicker. I initially didn’t think the sauce was going to be good, but I just trusted the recipe and poured it over the lamb shanks and baked it for a couple hours. When the meat and the sauce cook together it just produces the most delicious gravy you’ve ever tasted.  This  recipe is a keeper for sure!

Everyone was impressed with the presentation, but even more with the taste! left it on a little longer and the meat almost literally fell off the bone.

Sooo good!! I was thinking of using Chef Johns rack of lamb recipe on this because we love it so much, but I’m so glad we used this one instead. It was a nice change. Didn’t change a thing and it was perfect. Thanks Chef John. My husband jokes around and calls you my boyfriend lol. ;)

I was excited to make this dish and all was fine except I did not have an actual "roasting pan" so I used a glass 9x13 dish.  When I poured the braising liquid into the pan, it shattered!  Very scary.  I was not hurt but the dish was ruined.  I put the lamb shanks in another pan with some water and red wine and finished cooking.  The lamb was good, tender just lacked flavor because of the loss of liquid.  I will try it again but I will be buying a real roasting pan first!

I'll make it again but I'm going to double the sauce part of the recipe.  It simply wasn't enough for 5 pounds of lamb. Loved the flavors of it and it was really easy to make.

After cooking the shanks and draining as much fat as I could I put the pan on top of a burner and gently cooked down the juices, adding a little broth.  Will make again.

Was fantastic!!!!  I would suggest that the recipe should have more garlic, 6 cloves, and grate the cloves.  The cinnamon was a very interesting addition.  I will make it again my family loved it

I was craving lamb shank and this was easy to make!  I only used two shanks and cut the recipe in half. I served it with roasted potatoes and rainbow chard.  I will be making this again for sure.

Too much wine. Could barely taste the actual lamb flavor.
