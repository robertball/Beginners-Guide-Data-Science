Used green onions instead of spinach (none on hand) and added some bacon fat in place of oil,  was great and easy

Holy smokes this is good!!! I knew reading the ingredients that I would like this, but I was blown away by the flavor once I got to dig in! The chick peas are not something I had ever put into a frittata, but they totally make this dish. I halved the recipe because I'm cooking for just one, and I did add salt and pepper to the sauteed veggies and the egg mixture. Otherwise, everything else was kept the same. Once cooked, I added the crushed red peppers on top, along with a bit more shredded cheese.  A nice heat and not overly spicy at all. This is a very impressive dish, one that i'd definitely make for company.

I added dried herbs, more crushed red pepper, and garnished with fresh herbs. It was a nice, light dinner served with fresh bread.
