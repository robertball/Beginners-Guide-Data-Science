This recipe is very good for a nice summertime pizza.  I actually modified it slightly by cooking it on the grill instead of the oven and it came out very good.

I thought the olives and goat cheese were going to overpower everything and it wouldn't be good!
I was wrong -- it was fabulous!
Still good the next day.
We used another pizza dough recipe from this site.

This was good, but the taste of goat cheese is very strong so you can't eat a whole lot.  Might try again with mozarella.

Wonderful blend of ingredients that really go well together!  Make sure the goat cheese you get crumbles well.  The first time I made this, it was really clumpy and just ended up in big globs and was too much for my taste.  Also, it is a little on the salty side, but delicious just the same!
