I used butter instead of margerine and I sauteed some fresh minced garlic and onion in with the butter before adding the other ingredients. I added A LOT more milk to get the sauce to the consistancy I wanted and even then, it was too thick as we were eating it which made it unappealing. The flavor was great. I would make this again but I would add something else to thin out this sauce (like maybe chicken broth) and maybe cut back on the cream cheese.

Delicious! Here's what I did... I used 8 oz of medium shell pasta, 2 ounces cream cheese, 2/3 cup parmesean, 1/4 c half and half and a few tablespoons of margerine. I added more parmesean as the sauce cooked, added a tablespoon of freshly chopped basil rather than dried, used powdered garlic, then added about 8 ounces of crushed tomatoes. It made a very pretty pink sauce that was outstanding. Thank you for the basics... I wouldn't have tried the ingredients without the blueprint!

Very tasty sauce. I ended up throwing in some red onions as well. I found adding  a bit of lemon juice (about two caps' full) helped deplete the clumping, much like it does in fondue.

GREAT (and easy) recipe.  I always used DIGIORNO - ALFREDO SAUCE but they took it off the market in my area.  I have tried many, many alfredo recipes and this one has won by a landslide!

Thanks

This is sinful.  Very rich and filling.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and had sauteed and cubed a chicken breast which I added to the sauce while cooking the pasta.  I will make this again.  The sauce does get very thick when it cools, so I may add an additional 1/4 cup milk next time I try this one.  Also we love garlic so I will increase the garlic to 1 Tbls.

This should be called cream cheese fettucini. It does not taste like the traditional one. My family didn't care for it.

This is the best Alfredo sauce I have ever made, and will be our sauce of choise from now on. Creamy, thick, delicious, restaurant quality. I only used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the full cup (I don't cook with margarine) and it still tasted outstanding. My favorite recipe so far!

I made this one for my mom for mothers day and she LOVED it. It was really creamy and rich and super good.  It took me no time to make it too. I'll unquestionably make this one again.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have fettuccine so I substituted penne.  Also added some broccoli to the pasta while it was boiling.

I added chicken, spinach, onion and peppers to this for added colour, texture, and nutrition (as if anyone who makes this cares about nutrition...). I used no milk because of all my added veggies, and I also added a bit of lemon juice for a bit of "spark". And of course, I used butter, not margarine (the very idea!). Very good.

My whole family loved this recipe!!  I didn't have nutmeg or basil, so I just spiced it up with garlic powder, pepper and some italian seasoning blend and it was fine.  I guess I don't really know if the nutmeg and basil would have made it taste different, but it was still good and very easy to make.  Thank you!!!

Great recipe.  I ended up making 6 servings of this for 3 adults.  I used 1 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of milk, and the rest of the ingredients were the same. It turned out great. Garlic bread sticks were the perfect accompaniment! Will definitely make this again.

This is the easiest Alfredo recipe I have tried and it is delicious! I added another 1/2 c milk and it was plenty of sauce for a pound of fettuccine! Next time we will add chicken, maybe mushrooms, then try bacon...the possibilities are endless!

Followed the recipe exactly (estimated the cream cheese, so it might have been a little less) and it turned out great. I will defiantly use this recipe again.

We used 1 1/2 cups shell noodles, 4 ozs of 1/3 less fat cream cheese with chives/onion, 1/2 cup skim milk and the rest of the ingredients as written.  It was very creamy and rich.  My husband took one bite and said "This ones's a keeper for sure".  This would be really good with shrimp or chicken too.

This is so very easy and it is my husbands favorite.  I have made it with chicken, stone crab, and lobster.  The men in my family prefer it without the nutmeg and I find I need to add about a cup more milk to make it a little less thick but it is AMAZING!

This is a wonderful sauce! I love it for it's ease, but also for it's flavor. I'm a nutmeg fan, so I threw in an extra pinch. Also, I used almond milk in place of regular milk because it's what was in the fridge, and it worked beautifully. I would think plain soy milk would be great too. One could probably get away with scaling back the amount of cream cheese in the recipe to 6 oz. or so for the sake of saving a few calories.

The taste of cream cheese was quite overwhelming. It was not the flavour I was expecting. However, it is one I will probably play with until I find a nice balance of flavour. I had to add more milk at the end of cooking, as it was too thick to mix with the pasta. I also omitted the nutmeg, in part because I did not have any on hand and because it didn't seem appealing with garlic in the recipe.

After seeing the good reviews I was so looking forward to making this. Followed the recipe to a T.  It ended up tasting like salt and garlic, not alfredo. I was so disappointed. It took adding a bunch of cream and parm to get it to be edible, we could barely stand it.

Because this tasted so wonderful, I have been banned from my house mates from making it for fear of eating too much. Good if you add asparagus / ham / cut up spinach.

I have a recipe I use for fettuccine alfredo quite regularly however, I was in desperate need to go grocery shopping and this fit our needs.  I doubled the batch, used half grated parmesan and half shredded parmesan cheese.  I was also out of butter so I just added more milk and omitted the nutmeg out of personal preference.  Although, this recipe won't replace my regular recipe, it was a decent alternative.  As the title reflects, it is a very creamy sauce.

Great alfredo sauce even if you're not in a hurry.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to make it more of a pink sauce but the flavor was great!

I made this recipe as directed, but I'm using it in lasagna rolls. I tried the sauce and loved it so much, that I've been eating it at the stove with a leftover noodle (and I must admit, the spoon when the noodle ran out) while the lasagna cooks. Absoltely FANTASTIC, and it actually works with store-bought grated parm. Nice.

We all gave this a 5. The only thing I added was another 3/4 cup milk, another 1/4 cup parmesan, and I used 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning. We prefer this type of alfredo because it is lighter since I use neufchatel cheese and 1% milk. We liked it even better than the Quick & Easy Alfredo Sauce, also from this site. Thank you Barb!

I cut the cream cheese and butter in half like others had suggested, but I'm sorry, nothing could save this recipe.  It tasted nothing like alfredo sauce, tasted more like cream cheese with pasta.  It wasn't the worst thing I've ever tasted, but I certainly won't be mking this again.

REALLY GOOD! I really appreciated how fast this recipe was yet didn't forsake flavor or texture.  I did add a bit of lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer and fresh ground pepper, which I put in almost everything.  I had about 6 oz of cream cheese to use but sauce didn't seem to lack a thing.  Thank you for this!!

Fantastic!!  As a few other reviewers mentioned it does get really thick.  I added a little more milk and garlic.  I also added in some cooked boneless skinless chicken breast and cooked broccoli before serving.  Hubby loved it said it tasted just like that famous restaurant.  I will continue to make this and not buy sauce.  I made a 1/2 lb noodles and used the est for dipping sauce.  MMmm!!

While this was very creamy and tasty, I kinda felt guilty enjoying it, with a stick of butter and pkg of cream cheese!  I'm no health nut but this seems a bit much! Still good tho !!

For a quick & yummy meal, this is perfect! Like some of the other viewers I doubled everything (including the noodles) EXCEPT the cream cheese.  Even if you don't double it, only use half of the cream cheese recommended in the recipe.  We added Broccoli and Shrimp to make it a complete meal and it was sooo delicious!
When used as a complete meal the portion is a little larger so doubling it will serve 5-6.

Extremely thick! I ended up adding almost an entire can of chicken broth to make it "my kind of creamy". Overall, awesome and easy recipe! I added some broccoli for the kids and it was a huge HIT!

i thought this was really good. before i made this, i read the reviews and a lot of reviewers said that it was perfect as is and a lot of reviewrs said that theres too much cream cheese, so I decided to just cut out a little cream cheese. i used like 3/4 pkg cream cheese, (so like 6 oz) and then left everything else the same, oh except i used butter instead of oil, just cuz i like butter more. The sauce tasted fabulous and it was so easy to make. I put it over homemade noodles, and then added shrimp. everyone loved it. i bet this would also be good mixed with prego pasta sauce like 50:50 ratio and then mixed with meatballs. i'll try thatnext time

Quite good and a definite kid pleaser! I needed something quick and this surely was. I added cooked, diced chicken and had to sub a mexican blend cheese (I know, it's supposed to be alfredo!) but hey! It's all I had. No leftovers and that's all that counts. ;-) thank you and will definitely use again.

Absolutely delicious! I've never rated anything before, and this sparked me enough to have to. I made this exactly how is is written, and I am eating it as we speak! The only difference I made was I used Italian Seasoning instead of Basil, and my Parmesan was a four cheese blend. Cooked nicely, and I'll definitely be making this again. c:

Although my kids enjoyed this recipe-anything with noodles is pretty much a-go for them-I thought it was average.  I love Fettucine Alfredo, and I would probably make this again simply because it's easy.  However, there is way too much cream cheese in this recipe.  The overall result ends up being very thick and sticking to the roof of your mouth.  Cut the cream cheese and make it creamier-with cream or milk-and perhaps this would be more doable.  We also added seared chicken, which increased the flavor.

This was very good and very creamy, as the title states, but I think I'll make it with about 1/2 as much cream cheese...the cream cheese does add a great texture and makes it creamy for sure, but it just really overpowered the parmesan and took away from the traditional alfredo sauce flavor.  I'll do another review after I try it with 1/2 the cream cheese and let you know if it's better that way!

Very good simlpe sauce.  I used a little extra milk to thin it out a bit, but it wasn't the least bit glumpy or grainy.  Perhaps the other reviewrs who had this problem didn't heat it enough to melt the cheeses...also use a wisk to stir it constantly as it heats.

Such an easy recipe and so delicious too! I only had half the butter called for so I added some heavy cream for the rest. I used a shredded parmesan/romano blend and it turned out great. The nutmeg added a nice warmth and made this really stand out from other dishes. Thanks, this was great.

Absolutely delish! I am not a fan of alfredo but this was delish. I just made it which was super quick as I had some frozen pasta. Took a bite and here I am. Only change was I added 1 cup milk instead of 3/4. Will definitely be making this often. I added shrimp too.

This is so much better than jarred alfredo sauce! My husband has requested it once a week for the next two weeks! Updated 1/20/11 - Tripled this using fresh shredded parm and froze it with chicken in the mix. Very good, thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly, no alterations or substitutions, and found it to be kind of thick and very grainy. The large amount of parmesan made the this sauce undesirable. I think a melting cheese with strong flavor, say fontina, would work better in this recipe. I intend to try this recipe again with fontina and an extra 1/4-1/2c of milk, because it really was quick and simple, and a very good base recipe.

"Excellent!  Better than what you get in a lot of restaurants!"  Those were my husband's words.  I completely agree.  I tried to follow the recipe and went as far as grating fresh nutmeg but accidentally forgot to added it!  Ooops! Still... Yummm!

My family LOVES this recipe! It is really thick, so we add a little more milk. My husband- not a cook- actually made it the first time for Mother's day! One word of advice- it needs to be served right away or it gets thick. The nutmeg really makes a difference!

This turned out really disgusting-I ended up pouring it down the drain.  I don't know what happened, I followed the directions word for word.....it was really chunky, not at all creamy.

Absolutely spectacular!!!  Raving reviews from my husband.  I used low fat cream cheese, and I substituted 3/4 (a stick and a half) of butter for the margarine because it was actually a little too thick with just a half cup and it didn't just a touch more of that buttery flavor.  Served it w/ broiled red & yellow peppers and zucchini and garlic bread.

Very easy & creamy. Nice shortcut. Added garlic, broccoli & chicken. Heating the serving dish before putting pasta & sauce in, will keep it from cooling too quickly and clumping.

this tasted pretty good. I halved the cream cheese like some others did and it came out great. the only down side is that the oil and the cheese started separating within a couple minutes and the texture became somewhat chunky. but it still tasted good.

Recipe was great and very easy! I did add less cream cheese and it turned out wonderful. I think all the cream cheese called for would have been a little too much. Very good recipe, thanks.

This is my husband's favorite dish, and I've never really found a recipe I liked until this one--very delicious, and VERY EASY!  I like that it doesn't involve whipping cream, because I do not carry it usually, and is quite expensive!  Loved it!

Margarine does not belong in Fettucine alfredo....always use butter.  The recipe calls for way too much cream cheese and not enough pasta.

Total disappointment.

I added chicken and mushrooms and will absolutely make it again, as  I've already had to make two batches...It is a winner...family and friends told me i 'nailed' it! Oh yes, I did have to add about  twice the amount of milk to get the perfect consistency, otherwise, great!

Absolutely love this recipe! Better than Olive Gardens!:) I made this multiple times for my demonstration at cooking class (for my high school) and everyone loved it! I use the sauce to make white sauce pizza and it's heavenly. My parents love it when I make this. Sometimes I add fresh garlic and mince it very small, or I add in spinach and broccoli. This is very rich, creamy, and you can definitely tell there's cream cheese in it. If I had to change anything (I suggest not to the recipe is perfect) I would use less butter and cream cheese. ALSO, I made this a wee bit healthier by using almond milk instead of regular milk and I didn't notice a difference!

Amazing! We were having this as a side to bruschetta chicken so I halved the recipe. I used neufchâtel to cut out some of the fat. I omitted the nutmeg and used a little black pepper instead. I agree with other reviewers that it gets really thick. I probably ended up using more than double the milk (1%) to thin it out. Will definitely make again!

This Alfrado sauce is good! It is very rich and creamy. So many recipes are watery and runny. I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter instead of margarine.

In addition to the alfrado sauce I added grilled chicken and sautéed mushrooms with the dish. You can serve the sauce with gnocchi instead of fetticcine pasta. Yum!

Great. Only negative is, I can taste the cream cheese more which regular alfredo does not have. This was still good nonetheless. Used light better, lowfat cream cheese, added a squeeze of lemon wedge, and upped the basil and garlic for our liking. I used the pasta water to loosen up the alfredo when it became too thick from setting. My husband LOVED this. Said it was the best alfredo sauce I'd ever made. Definitely make again.

This is the best fettuccine alfredo I have ever tasted!  I have made it so many times now I've lost count, and every time people say it's better than Olive Garden!  :)  I also love how filling it is--I double the recipe and make a big pot of it; it lasts for days and just gets better and better every day.  This has become one of my all time favorite recipes to make.  The basil in the sauce is really what makes it distinctly alfredo.  :)  Thanks so much!!

I used 12oz. of fettuccine pasta. I left out the basil and the nutmeg. I added 2 chicken breast (boiled and shredded) and about 1c. cooked broccoli. I mixed the noodles, chicken and broccoli in a bowl and poured the sauce over top. It was excellent! Definitely a family favorite!

This IS "really creamy!!" I scaled it down to two servings and based on that, I had to add an extra 1/8 cup (1.5 tbsp) of milk so it wasn't so thick.  I want to mention that I threw a slice of provolone in the mixture so maybe that's why I needed the extra milk.  I also used a bit of black pepper, Italian seasoning instead of basil, and a bit more garlic powder than the recipe called for.  Pretty good recipe, I would use this alfredo recipe again! (I recommend you try Zucchini Alfredo from this site - best alfredo i've ever made came from that recipe!)

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly. However I did add more milk to it because it became really thick if let sitting too long. or maybe because I used reduced fat cream cheese? not really sure. Next time I will add more garlic and make sure to time it better.

I love this! I make it at least once or twice a month.  My only advice is to not use low fat cream cheese, it's not nearly as good.  I've made it with fresh parmesian and with the other stuff, the sauce was quite thick and paste-like with the stuff from the can, but it was still good.

I tried this last night as a sauce for a lobster pizza. It was awesome and I got rave reviews! I will certainly be making this again!

Served this yummy goodness to my son's basketball team before a big game.  They devoured it! My son said, "it is better than Olive Garden". I used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and added more parmesan cheese to the alfredo sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I found this recipe when I couldn't find the other recipe I've made and love when searching for it.  This recipe was just ok.  Not so great that I'd stop searching for my other recipe.

This sauce was very good! I deviated from the recipe a bit by adding 3 cloves of crushed garlic, substituting heavy cream for the milk (I added roughly a cup of heavy cream as the sauce tasted a bit to tangy with that much cream cheese),1/2 tsp crushed black pepper and increasing the grated parmesan cheese to 1 cup. All in all Delicious!

Very easy - yes!  Creamy - yes!  I prepared the sauce as directed and added steamed broccoli at the end (when mixing it with the pasta).  Next time I will cut back on the cream cheese and sub it with extra parmesan or maybe even sour cream?  The cream cheese just had too strong of a flavor for it to be "alfredo".  I will also add a bit more garlic (maybe use fresh-minced?) and add some white ground pepper.  Also - the leftovers the next day were not good!  The sauce got clumpy and the taste was gone!?  Good recipe regardless and I would make this again with the changes I mentioned.

Because there were comments about the sauce being a bit mealy, I left out the parmesan cheese and served it on the side at the table.  The doubled recipe was a big hit with my vegetarian friends with nary a leftover for today.  As suggested, I added chopped tomatoes and slightly steamed chopped broccoli, which added color as well as texture and flavor.   This was an extremely easy dish to prepare, and I'll definitely be serving it again.  Thank you!

I give this 5 stars with the adjustments I made. I didn't have any milk left so I used half and half, used butter instead of margarine because I only had spread or butter and wasn't sure if spread would melt well, I also added minced garlic and green onions. Also forgot the nutmeg...oops! So I managed to make it WAY more fattening but it sure was tasty!

Huge hit with my fussy boys and husband.  I added a little extra milk and then I added some pre-cooked chicken strips.  Very quick, simple, and easy to prepare meal.  Great taste.

This is an amazing recipe! I used neufchâtel cheese to cut out some of the fat and calories from regular cream cheese, and used real butter, but only 1/4 of a cup. Also, because I am lazy, I bought ore-cooked chicken and threw it in the sauce when it was almost done. For the amount of sauce this recipe makes, and the richness of the sauce, I'm going to use more pasta next time. Yummy and easy!

This recipe was great. Ended up using Penne instead and everything turned out great. Used more pasta and kept everything else the same. Made some Baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken from this site and it went together really well. Wil def. make again.

This was excellent and so easy. I did, however, use about a 1/4 less of the cream cheese and margarine. I also used skim milk and a little extra parmesan. Very creamy!

It wasn't the recipe I was looking for, but  I still had all of the ingredients.  It was delicious, but in no way could you call this recipe healthy.  I will keep looking for the alfredo recipe I lost and use this until then.

Made this last night and my wife was amazed that I could cook something so delicious! We were both really impressed with the way it turned out. Per another reviewer I only put in 25% less cream cheese and it turned out perfect! Thanks everyone! And kudos to AllRecipes iPhone app!

This was alright.  It is missing something though and since I am not a chef I don't know what else to add.  I kept adding more milk b/c it just seemed too clumpy.  Overall the taste was good, just a little mealy.

The flavor of the sauce was good but it was way too thick and clumpy, it left us feeling very filled up. If I try this again, I will use more milk, less cream cheese and less garlic!

This recipe was very good but VERY VERY rich. Next time I will cut down on the cheeses and add more milk. A little bit of this sauce goes a very long way taste wise. I doubled the recipe and also used fresh garlic rather than the garlic salt.

OOHH SOOO GOOOD!  I used slightly less cream cheese and I did not have margarine so I used butter but just 3/4 of the stick.  For my taste preference I didn't add in the garlic salt but some fresh garlic which I minced up extra extra fine.  WOW what a dish thrown over some spinach fettuccine with some roasted chicken on top.  Will keep this one in the good old box.

Delicious! I also added chicken to it as my husband likes to have meat in just about everything. I left out the nutmeg. I don't care for nutmeg in foods other than baked goods. Will definitely make again.

I thought that there was a little bit too much cream cheese (would have used more butter) and a bit much on the garlic but over all it was good. My family enjoyed it a lot and i will make it again but with some small changes. Also the Nutmeg is a must.

Although this sauce had good flavor, it was thick and pasty in texture.  I tried adding more milk, and also some pasta cooking water to thin it out.  I will not make this again.

I cut the recipe size down to two. After that, I cut down some of the butter/margarine for lower fat content. I also cooked in the nutmeg instead of sprinkling it on top at the end. Really good taste, but unfortunately, it came out really thick and clumpy, so the presentation is a bit off! Glad it didn't contain heavy cream! :)

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a little too much garlic powder when my roommate read the recipe to me. I'll definitely be making this again and again for my roommates and me.

Very good.  I think the idea of cutting the cream cheese would be good because it is VERY thick the way it is.  I used the sauce as a sauce on a "white pizza" with the original recipe and it was great because it was so thick.  But with the pasta it is too thick... I had to add much more milk to thin it out and make it saucy.

Great recipe!  What a very easy recipe to make.  I elaborated on the recipe by adding some salmon and broccoli.

It was creamy but I wasn't crazy about the taste.  Somehow it ended up with a canned taste in my opinion.  I loved the concept since I never seem to have cream but I'll go out and buy it for the more traditional alfredo sauce.  Sorry.

We loved this dish.  I halved the cream cheese and butter, and cooked the noodles for 12 minutes.  Delicious!!

Fantastic! I was impressed with how delicious and easy this was! 

Next time I make it, I'll use less margarine. There was a bit too much of it, so it wouldn't blend completely. 

Thanks Barb!

I have tried several different Fettucini Alfredo recipes and this is by far the best. My husband is a very picky eater and he has asked me to prepare this for him numerous times. I recommend anybody to try this recipe first, you will not need to search any further.

I made this with my girlfriend one evening when we were hungry.  We wanted to make FA for so long, since we already knew how to make our own spaghetti sauce and she loves FA.  Well, she loved it so much, she took the recipe from me and now regularly makes it at home with her sister.  Recipe is soooooo easy and the nutmeg REALLY helps it not be bland.

This recipe was fabulous.  I added sauted vegtables and used 1/2 the cream cheese.  I doubled the recipe and froze some and it still tasted great.

I used this to top my fresh fettucini noodles I had made and mmmmmmm, it was incredible.  I found this recipe simple to make and the results outstanding!
