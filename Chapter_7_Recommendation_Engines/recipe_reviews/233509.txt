All hail pickled okra from Aunt Lillian! It's hard waiting the 4 weeks but once you open one, you'll wish you'd made more. I used a habanero pepper for a bit more kick and trust me, it's perfect. Thank you Happy Grandma for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

I use this recipe for my cucumbers.  I omit the peppers in most jars and add a head of dill to each from the garden.  Perfect every time! When the pickles are gone I toss in cauliflower florets and pepper slices.  Waste not, want not!!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe

This worked out well.  I did not include the mustard seed but did put in a cayenne pepper and clove or two of garlic with mine.  Their great.  My only problem is not stuffing the jar well enough with okra pods so they floated after canning.

Not a whole lot going on in the flavor department despite adding lots of garlic. They are tangy but thatâ€™s about it.
