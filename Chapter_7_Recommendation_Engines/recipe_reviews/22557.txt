For an easier way to get the same flavor just use the jar of marshmallow cream and pure orange extract. use 1 teaspoon in place of the liquor and the zest. It also makes this recipe cheaper. This works well without the nuts too. Either way.

Amazing! I also used the marshmallow cream and orange extract. It worked out great. also replaced the orange with vanilla, the chocolate chips with white chocolate and the nuts with crushed oreos to make cookies and cream fudge

I used the marshmallow cream, and pure orange extract too (the 2 Tbsp)...it was so good! I'll be making this lots more!

If you love the combination of orange and chocolate, here you go.  This is so easy and so good.

When I tried making this fudge, it set up fine but ended up almost completely flavorless, unfortunately.

So good. A nice hint of orange. I didnâ€™t microwave for the full 8 minutes as it began to explode. But seems that the 4 minutes was sufficient.
