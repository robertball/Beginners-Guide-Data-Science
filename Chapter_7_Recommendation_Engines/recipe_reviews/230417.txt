Good combination of flavors that I adapted to use in the crockpot. I marinated the roast for several hours (used white wine and dijon because that is what I had) then browned it in a skillet and transferred to my crockpot along with a sliced onion. I took the leftover marinade and heated it to a boil on the stovetop and added just the apricot jam. I poured this over the roast and cooked on low. The meat was very flavorful and the sauce was great over rice as well.

Fantastic! I didn't have sherry on hand but used port and some apricot liqueur. Marinaded overnight then browned the pork and cooked on low in a crock pot! This is an amazing recipe for pork sirlion/tenderloin/chops,  etc and I plan to use this for a future dinner party for special guests.  It's great with garlic mashed potatoes as well! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Love this recipe! I had everything on hand so I didn't have to run out for any ingredients. The sauce was simple and a big hit with my children.  This recipe went right into my recipe box.

Amazing! Holiday worthy and super simple! The "only" change I made was to add some of the marinade to the pan with some carrots. Delish!

Loved this! I will make again. The only thing I did different was I added worchester sauce because I was out of soy. My husband loved it!

This was very tasty!  I let it marinade about 6 hours and made no changes to the recipe.  The glaze makes this recipe a keeper. Will make this again!

Yummy! I will confess that I was looking for a sauce/glaze when I found this recipe and used another marinade that I like. Next time I will try the marinade as well but, just the sauce is elegant, simple and perfect for a pork loin. If the marinade is as good, it will be a five star for sure.

Who couldn't love this recipe?  I left out ginger because I've never like it, added green onions , used white wine instead, and added a little bit of oil to help with browning the meat in the oven, then placed in crockpot after meat was golden brown on top and added glaze, it was perfect, juicy and enhanced my pallet!  Will make again for sure!!

We cut our pork loin roast into thick chops since just two of us. I Marinated all day in the marinade. We just grilled our pork loins on the gas grill since it was a bit warm for the oven. The pork was so moist and simply tasted wonderful. The apricot sauce was a bit sweet for me, and I really couldn't taste the Sherry or Soy in it, but my husband loved it. I used Simply Fruit Apricot preserves. We're going to give this recipe another try but next time use the sauce as a basting while cooking and reserve a bit for dipping.

SO good!  Had been losing my faith in pork for a while there, but this came out super moist and flavorful.  Didn't change the recipe part at all, but I did "sear" it before roasting it.  Helped keep the juices in, and cut down on roasting time. 

Perfect!

This was ok. The flavor was very  subtle.  I did marinate it over night. The sauce was good and  might be better with chicken.  I probably will not make again.

I actually marinated and used moonshine, and added it to make a gravy instead of apricots. SO tender and yummy! My neighbor loved it.
