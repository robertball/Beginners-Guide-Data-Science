This is good stuff. I made it for my dad's retirement party that was jimmy buffett themed & i think even jimmy would agree it was delicious!  wouldn't change a thing.. 
ps to below asking was simple syrup is:  Simple syrup, or sugar syrup, is very easy to make and is used in many cocktails such as Jell-O Shots, Daiquiris and Hurricanes to add volume and sweetness. With this recipe you can make as small or as large a batch as you wish and store it in the refrigerator in a well sealed bottle indefinitely. 
Ingredients:
2 parts sugar
1 part water

Preparation:
Bring the water to a boil. 
Dissolve the sugar into the boiling water. 
Once the sugar is dissolved completely, remove the pan from the heat. 
Allow to cool completely and bottle.

I sure hope more than 4 people have tried this recipe for the perfect mai tai, because that's exactly what it is, simply PERFECT.  This is absolutely a crowd pleaser...I mean no one walks away after having made this for them without begging and pleading for this recipe and amazing their friends with it too.  Try it, I promise you'll like it.  No substitutions needed.  This one by far is my absolute favorite mixed drink home or at restaurants.

Amazing find.  Alcohol is well hidden in amazing combination that creates a bright, smooth drink.  

To keep things sweet, I used a combination of regular limes and key limes for the juice - just juiced 5 regular limes, then over a dozen key limes to get an equal amount of juice.  For the orange liqueur, I used about 3 shots of Grand Marnier, then filled up the rest of the cup with cheap BOLS triple sec.  For the OJ, I used store-bought "not from concentrate" orange juice to save time.  The almond syrup really added a unique twist taste, and should not be missed.  Also, to save money and make sure it was not too strong, I followed the suggestions of others and replaced the 151 proof rum with a combo of the light and dark.  Tasted amazing the first day, lost a bit of it's bright, fruity taste the next day; so I'd suggest you avoid storing it.

Equal out the portions of Light & Dark rums - drop the 151 rum (unless you're going to 'float' it) and lose the orange juice - they you have a REAL Mai Tai!  By the way, the Almond syrup is Orgeat and is available from many sources online.

ooohh be careful with this one! Mai Tais are the one drink that really creep up on you. I served 2 pitchers at a 4th of July grill and everyone was silly drunk. Per other peoples suggestions, I used half the syrups, and eliminated the 151 rum. Really not necessary. I also added a little pineapple juice. They were really sweet drinks, but rum had a real strong punch. The sweetness wasnt too sweet, and perfectly masked the booze, so we drank these things like water and next thing you know... well it was a great party. Also: dont ever bother buying the pre made bottles of simple syrup. All it consists of is equal parts sugar and water. Boil 1 cup water then add 1 cup sugar. I love this recipe!!!

This was a HUGE hit at my reception.  There was not one drop left. As others have stated I omitted the 151 and used 2 cups light and 2 cups dark rum, Triple sec for the orange curacao, Ameretto, lime cordial, simple syrup, and bottled orange juice.  Mixed all in a punch bowl and chilled for a few hours.  Definitely a winner!!

Made a batch of these this weekend and loved them. I used Cointreau in place of the curacao. You can find Orgeat syrup (almond)at most coffee houses ie; Zaks or cowboy coffee. It is made by Torani. And for the lady who thought it was a lot of work squeezing all those limes, just replace it with lime cordial (its about an 1/8 of a cup per lime. With all these ingredients you can't tell the difference at all. We drink it with different blends of juices, pineapple, mango, orange ect. they all taste really good. Cheers!

This was a very nice cocktail and so festive looking; looks are deceiving though--it will kick your butt if you're not paying attention to how much you're consuming!  As others, I did not use the 151 proof, and just divided equally between the dark and light rum.  One cup of the almond flavored syrup was overpowering; next time I will cut back to 1/2 cup, sample the drink, and then increase the amount if needed.  Same goes for the simple syrup.  (I think I just have sour tastebuds.)  We will be enjoying again!  Thank you.

I actually give it 4 1/2 starts. These were tasty but yes, they are strong! And I didn't even use the 151 because I was out. Instead I took the advise of other reviewers and just used an extra 1/2 cup each the light and dark rums.

To the reviewer that said this is not a 'real' Mai Tai', actually it is. Or at least it's close. The Mai Tai was originally invented by Victor Bergeron of Trader Vic's and consisted of rum, orgeat (almond syrup), orange curacao, fresh lime and rock candy syrup (simple syrup). The difference with this recipe is the orange juice. Although I personally like the fruity Hawaiian versions with pineapple juice better, this recipe is closer to the real thing then they are. 

For a twist, next time I might try using 4 cups of OJ and 4 cups pineapple juice. Thanks for the recipe!

This was exactly what we were looking for.  One thing that may help some (especially in the pocketbook area) is to make your own almond syrup.  After striking out at several stores I I checked the ingredients in the vanilla syrup and then made my own.  The vanilla syrups said that they only had vanilla extract, water and sugar... heck I can make that for a almond flavored syrup.  I just doubled my batch that I made for my simple syrup and added almond extract.  I made it kind of weak given the recipe, but the taste is the same, and it is way cheaper than a bottle of syrup.

Holy Batman and Robin. I can hardly type. I never try mixed drinks on the rare occasions when I go out. They're usually bitter, lukewarm and altogether unpleasant. In the past month, though, I've tried to make some of my own. This site has a great recipe for beer margarits and another for mojitos. This one, though, takes the top spot. 

It's a perfect mix of sweetness and potency. I used a $20 bottle of orange liquer rather than the cheaper triple sec so I could get a real sense of how good it can be. I didn't realize my Myer's dark rum was almost empty. I only squeezed a quarter-cup out of it, but that's plenty. I did add a squirt of grenadine just to see how it affects the flavor. I also used Dole's orange-pineapple juice rather than straight orange juice. 

I didn't know how to make almond syrup, and I couldn't find anything of the sort at the grocery store. So I made a double batch of simple syrup and added a squirt of almond extract. That seemed to do the trick.

My, these are delicious.

As others have said, cut the rum in half to start then ramp it up to suit your crowd's taste.  I add a quart of pineapple juice and substitute Amaretto for the almond syrup.  Nice to be able to give 20 people (in-laws) a night to remember for under $100.  
I made 4 gallons and froze in freezer bags ahead of time.  Otherwise, I would be tied to the blender all night like I have been for the past 10 years for our get-togethers.
Do it...it's a no brainer!!

Fabulous!  I make this in a 3 gallon clear server that has an ice base to keep it from getting too warm in the summer.  It is such a hit that everyone always wants the recipe.  It's  become my signature drink around the pool and at the swim up bar.  So great, and I always have the festive fruit picks ready to pop on top.

I doubled this recipe to serve to a large party (actually making two doubled batches).  It was excellent!  We did as others have suggested, to eliminate the 151 rum in favor of a 1:1 dark to light rum combo.  Added a little extra curacao for a little more orange-y flavor.

Absolutely the perfect drink for Asian dinners!!  My 12 favorite foodie friends are in total agreement.  Made it exactly according to recipe, use good quality rum (I used Bacardi), fresh juices and you cannot go wrong!

I made this over the weekend to RAVE reviews---followed the recipe (almost) exactly.  I had thought about leaving the 151 out but after taste tests we all decided it needed the extra oompf!  Really super yummy.  I buy the Orgeat at my local liquor store and, my one change, used Dole Orange Pineapple juice as a Mai Tai does really need that pineapple flavor for me.  juicing the 10 limes resulted in about 1 and1/4 cups lime juice--but I have an electric citrus juicer which makes this much easier---might try Nellies Key lime juice in a pinch.

I made this as directed, well except without the 151 Rum, for 5 people and we all loved them. We consider ourselves "experts" on Mai Tai's as we go to Hawaii frequently and have them over there and we thought these were on par with the best and very authentic.  I had a really hard time finding Orange Curacao in my small town but if you have a BevMo they have everything you could possibly need.  Cointreau is very expensive compared to the Orange Curacao which was only around $7 a bottle. These will sneak up on you so be warned!

This is an awesome recipe, but I don't want a whole gallon of mai tais. I customized this to make one good drink, because the serving calculator is way off when you change it to one or two servings.

Yes this one is perfect!  I made this in a 3 gallon decanter and it was gone in 2 hours!  I did substitute crystal light sunrise for the oj to cut the calories.  It was really good and tropical!

Yummy!!!
We made this for a party and it went very quickly.  
We also left off the 150 rum and used Ameretto liqueur instead of flavored syrup. 
I Then replaced about 2 cups of orange juice with PINEAPPLE JUICE to give it a more authentic Hawaiian taste.
I FLOATED LIVE ORCHIDS on the punch for a festive look
and served it in glasses with pineapple and cherries on orchid topped spears, a fruitier twist on the typical umbrella. 
We made the punch in the morning so the flavors could blend.
It does NOT keep well for more than 1 day.
We will definitely make this again.

Made exactly as written for a tailgate party.  It was delicious. Because it is fairly strong, I served it over a lot of ice. I wouldn't change a thing.

Since I love my liquor, I left in the 151 rum and substituted the almond syrup for Amaretto. The second time I did the same and dropped the orange juice. Both was a winner with me.

I made this for my bridial shower, it was a hit!  You can purchase almond syrup at Cost Plus World Market, Toroni makes it.  I used orange pinapple juice as suggested and it was great! I've come back online to get the recipe again as I have a bbq this weekend and can't wait to have them again!

It may taste good, but it's not a Mai Tai.  Mai tais are Hawaiian drinks, and they feature pineapple juice.  Without pineapple, you can't even begin to call it a mai tai.  It is absolutely essential.  I notice that the recipe does include almond (orgeat) syrup, which is a plus because it does belong in a mai tai and most recipes exclude it.

Excellent.  Watch out, this will knock you on your butt if you're not careful.  I didn't use the 151 rum. i triple sec in place of curacao and 1/2 cup of ameretto in place of the almond flavored syrup.  i added some pineapple juice.  i had some extra left and it kept well in the fridge for a few weeks.

Very refreshing and potent - yet smooth and fruity!  Guaranteed good time!  I couldn't find the almond syrup, so I sub'd one cup of amoretta and added one cup of simple syrup.  1 squeezed lime = 2 tbsp juice.

This was way too sweet for my tastes. I reduced the amount of simple syrup; used Frangelico in place of the almond syrup (that's all I had) and added some mango juice to the orange juice. It was nice but just too sweet for my tastebuds. I'd serve it at Bunco but I'd prefer something lighter. Thanks for the post and for expanding my taste palate!

First had this drink in Vegas. I watched the bartender make it but after having a couple forgot the recipe. After lots of searching I found it again and it is just as good as I remember. Everyone always begs me to make these for them. A great drink but they can sneak up on you.

Been trying to replicate the Mai Tai at my favorite crab restaurant for a while.  This has come the closest.  Used 2 cups of dark rum and omitted 151.  Made my own syrups.  Used Triple Sec instead of curacao.  1 1/4 lime juice instead of 10 limes.  Orange Pineapple.  If storing in the fridge for a while.  I won't mix the juice in until serving time.  Top with maraschino cherries and an umbrella. Delish!

Ended up serving two gallons of this at a party.  It was a HUGE hit.  I left out and did not substitute anything for the 151, but served with an extra splash of dark rum floating on top of each glass.  I used amaretto for the almond syrup and used 1/2 OJ and 1/2 pineapple juice instead of all OJ. It tasted just like the mai tais we had in Hawaii.  These really sneak up on you!!!

Made this recipe for a graduation party and everyone loved it!  It was all gone within a few minutes. I followed some of the other reviewers advice and I skipped the 151 rum and just made up the difference with equal parts of the light and dark rum.

WOW what a hit....and a hard hit if not careful.  I suggest pouring over lots of ice and sipping s-l-o-w-l-y!  I omitted the 151 proof and used dark rum in it's place, used Dole pinapple orange juice, and also my local liquor store suggested BOLS Creme de Noyaux (almond liqueur) in place of the almond syrup.  Very yummy and great for a party.  We made a second batch and used simply limade in place of squeezing all those limes and cut down on simple syrup to taste; almost as good!

I was not as thrilled with this as I thought I would be from all the reviews. It had too strong of a liquor taste. I elimintated the 151 rum and substituted with light and dark rum to equal 1 cup of the 151. Maybe I should have just left out 1 cup of alcohol all together. I froze what was left over for slushes.

Orzata syrup is more readily available in Italian Pork and Specialty stores and avoids the expense of buying Orgeat Syrup on line.  I believe that Orzata is the original almond syrup used by Trader Vic.

We made these for our "Luau" dinner party last night and LOVED them!  In fact, I'm going to the grocery store to get the fixin's for another batch tonight.  

My husband accidentally put 3 cups of light rum in and only 1 of dark rum and they still turned out well...they just didn't have that standard Mai Tai color.  We also used bottled lime juice.  

These were strong enough to get the party started, but didn't taste like pure liquor.  YUM!

Very very smooth, but also very strong. I scaled this down for myself. I had to add some more juice to mine, it was just too strong for me. I skipped the 151 as I thought it would be a little overkill, but I added a big splash of Grand Marnier to compensate. I'm not sure what was meant by almond syrup, so I used Amaretto almond liquor. I used grenadine for simple syrup. Looked beautiful in the glass, nice color, all I was missing was the little umbrella.

I made this for a party over Memorial Weekend and it was a hit!! I could only find Blue Curacao, which made it green, but it still tasted great!  Thanks

THIS WAS GREAT!!  I USED 2 CUPS LIGHT AND 2 CUPS DARK RUM INSTEAD OF THE 151. PUT A SPLASH OF GRENADINE AND SERVED OVER ICE.  THIS WAS THE BIG HIT AT MY PARTY.  ITS SOME WORK TO HAND SQUEEZE ALL OF THE LIMES BUT WORTH IT!!

We gave my parents a Hawaii party for their 50th wedding anniversary. I made this recipe and it was a hit. My mother loved it. I had to make another gallon for her to take home.

I never review recipes but I had to rate this one because it is OUTSTANDING!!!  I used Myers for the dark rum and left out the 151 and it was delicious. I also substited Looza brand tropical juice for the orange juice.  Tasted just like we had in Hawaii.

This truly is the perfect mai tai recipe! I wouldn't change a thing. Served these at a dinner party where I had grilled marinated teriyaki chicken, grilled pineapple slices, green salad, etc. and they were a hit! Thank you.

Per other reviews, I did not add 151 (its plenty strong without). However, my Dad and I both thought it needed a little more dark rum which we added to our individual cups as to not disturb the original recipe.  Everyone loved it and we drank the whole batch pretty quickly...lol (6 adults).

Made a batch for a Hawaii 5-0 themed 50th birthday party.  Everyone LOVED it, but it really does sneak up on you.

Loved it!  It was not overly sweet and the alcohol was hidden within all the deliciousness.  Just be careful, after two of these you may not be able to walk a straight line!  My only substitution was the 3rd alcohol which I did not have.  I just added  half light half dark to make up for it.  I also used the organic orange juice from Costco, which tastes just like fresh squeezed juice.

i have to agree with everyone, a darn  good mai tai! i was looking for one that had almond flavor in it as i just came back from a royal carribean cruise and was hooked!  i followed the advice of another review and subbed out amaretto for the almond syrup.  i used the recipe calculator to get it down to four drinks and following that was great.  for the 1 1/4 limes juiced i used 2 T fresh lime juice, and also cut down the oj from the 1 cup it said to 1/2 cup because the first batch (of 4!) was a little too "juicy" for my taste.  thanks for a great recipe...it's a keeper!!

Also makes a nice drink omitting the OJ and using just Simply Limeade.

151 is entirely for kick, and does not seem necessary for taste.

Way too much orange juice. I cut it literally in half, if not more. The grenadine is a nice touch with just a pinch drizzle of it. Where can you find the almond syrup and simple syrup?

I used equal parts light and dark rum and left out the 151.  Still very powerful.  I made this for my husband's fortieth (along with the beergaritas posted on this site) and didn't have a drop left of a quadrupled batch!
