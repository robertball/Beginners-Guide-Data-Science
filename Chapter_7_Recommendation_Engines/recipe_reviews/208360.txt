I went ahead and tried the recipe as is despite thinking the ratios were wrong. I make guacomole all the time and use 3-4 avocados to 1 onion. I love onions, but one onion to one avocado was just way too much. I would also suggest adding a clove or two of minced garlic and a little cilantro for some more flavor. When it comes to spiciness, I have a qualm with dishes that have the word "spicy" in them when they aren't really that spicy. Some extra cayenne and diced jalepeno peppers add a nice kick.

This is a keeper!  Lots of flavor and very low effort.  Decrease amount of cayenne if you want a little less heat.  Next time, I am going to try this on some fish, and I will try squeezing a little lime on the meat (possibly marinate in lime for 10 minutes or so) before I pat on the salt/pepper rub.   Thanks for contributing this, it's going in our rotation!  **UPDATE** I tried this recipe on tilapia and now make this all the time, only with fish, not the chicken.  Go easy on the spice layer on the fish, saute/pan fry over medium to med-hi heat for 3-4 minutes each side, until fish turns to solidly white.  For the salsa, I REDUCE the lime and onion to about 2 tsp of lime juice (1/2 a juicy lime) and 1/2 a small-medium red onion, chopped fine.  Yum!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, very tasty.  I didn't change any ingredients, but I did change the way I prepared them. My husband and I preferred grilled onions so I cooked the chicken first, set aside, then grilled the onions, then added the chicken back to the pan.  I served it over brown rice, with the chicken and onions, then avocado mixture on top.  Really yummy and healthy, but we both decided next time I would omit or put very little lime juice. It was a bit much for our tastes.  Perhaps it was perfect with the raw diced onions. Definitely a keeper.

We love this over pan fried chicken. I go easy on the cayenne or even leave it out. I cube the Avacado slices and use a thin slice of red onion chopped fine. It's a Salsa so I have to dice up a tomato that's been cleaned out. Salt, Pepper and Garlic Powder. I then add some fresh Cilantro, dried if need be. I like the lime juice, but just shy of 2 Tblspns. A couple of easy stirs with a big spoon, chill and serve it over the chicken. It's just the best over/with chicken. It's a bit of chopping/dicing but it's top chef praises from all who eat it.

I prepared this recipe.  It was okay but I wouldn't make it again.  It just tasted like chicken with guacamole on top.

I would have given this dish 5 stars but I made two big changes that I think added to the flavor.  I agree with some other reviews that the ratio of avocado and onion seemed wrong.  I had way too much onion for the garnish, and had to scoop about 1 cup of it out to have a better ratio.  Next time I will increase the amount of avocado or decrease the amount of onion.  The second big change was adding bacon.  My husband and I first thought the picture on this recipe had bacon in it...and then decided that sounded great!  So we cooked about five pieces of bacon and broke it up into little pieces, added it to the garnish and served.  We also decided to grill the chicken (to save some time), which turned out awesome!!  It added a perfect amount of salt to compliment the spice.  Great dish and I will make this again!

We will make this again.  My husband wants to top it with cheese next time and melt it under the broiler before serving.  Had a nice kick.  A tad spicy for me, but husband was ok with it.  I might cut the red onion or increase the avacado next time and add some garlic or Italian seasoning.  But all in all a good recipe.  I rate it 3.5 stars.

my son highly recommended this recipe, i added onion powder and garlic powder to the chicken spices and sauteed as the recipe says. I used wholly guacamole with red pepper flakes, chopped cilantro, the onions, and lime for a sauce. I served over rice (that was in the fridge). yum

Really impressed!! I had thawed chicken and an avocado and had limited time for dinner. I cut the recipe in half and the only changes I made to the original recipe were to add a pad of butter with the olive oil when cooking the chicken (for that yummy brown crust) and I added diced tomato to the avocado topping. Perfect for an easy, quick and light dinner. The flavors were really amazing!!

I made a couple changes--used less cayenne for less heat, used yellow onion instead of red, and added some garlic powder to the avocado mixture.  Both my husband and I loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipie for my family as part of a new low-calorie diet I'm forcing them to go on with me. THEY LOVED IT! My mother loved it so much, she wants me to prepare it for the pastor and wife at the church for their anniversary. I used lemon juice instead of lime, used white onion instead of red, used canola oil instead of olive and added about 1/2 cup of plain lowfat yogurt to make it a little more creamy. It was a hit!

Very tasty and fresh.  Also easy to make. I have used the same cayenne pepper rub  for chicken with a lot of other meals...it goes with everything.

i used lemon juice instead of lime juice (didn't have lime) and the recipe was delicious. the avocado provided a nice balance to the cayenne pepper.

Made this last night.  It was very good.  I cooked the onion in a tiny bit of bacon drippings which pumped up the flavor and I added three cloves of garlic, just because I love garlic!  I will definitely serve this to friends and family.

Dean, my husband, and I loved this dish.  Now I did make some changes.  I didn't have Cayenne Pepper so I used Chipolte Chili Pepper and I used a 1/8 teaspoon because this is very strong and didn't want it too spicy.  I had read other comments and agreed that 
the chicken should be cooked with oil and a little butter, worked out beautifully.  I also cooked cooked the onions in a little butter, awesome, then added the onions to the lemon juice and avocado.  I served this over a bed of cooked fresh spinach (no seasoning).  I was so pleased with this recipe.  I do think that its not a spicy as the name implies, but the dinner had a lot of flavor (definitly due to the salt) and the lemon juice with the carmalized onions. I felt like I was at a fine resturaunt but I was home watching baseball.

This was a very bland dish, if made as the recipie calls. I may try to change a few things to see if I can spicy it up some. Not spicy as it describes, and the avocado was over bearing, to heavy without being spicy.

I thought this was great!  It was different from the other chicken meals I usually cook.  The only thing I changed was to use less red onion.   My husband gave it four stars.

I am confused as the photo looks to have bacon but none called for in the recipe. I am not sure the recipe and the photo go together as the photo shows sliced avocado and the recipe calls for diced.
I agree there is way to much onion for the amount of avocado called for so I used way less of the onion and still, not impressed.

Delicious.  I decided to saute the onion prior to topping the chicken with it and the avocado and I don't think it would have been quite right raw.

I think that it would be much nicer with a simple vinaigrette rather than pure lemon.  In my country we eat avocados as an hors d'oeuvre with a vinaigrette.  I will try it like that the next time.

I made this the other night because it sounded delicious.  My kids are tired of my chicken dishes so I had to try this because we all love avocado.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the red onion ruined the taste, in my opinion.  Next time I will used a sweet yellow onion and maybe add some diced green chilies.  But I do have to say the kids liked this and I was pleased with that.

Great recipe.  Perfect amount of cayenne, salt and pepper.  My only suggestion is that if you are using 4 chicken breasts, I found that two avocados and only 1/4 of a red onion was best.  Also, I don't understand the photo for this dish.  Is that bacon?

This was not spicy at all. It was very bland so I won't be making it again.

This is the tastiest chicken recipe! I bought chicken breasts that were too thick (or so I thought). 
I just browned them in the pan w/the olive oil and then put all of it in the oven to finish baking while I made the Avocado topping, BTW, the topping is fabulous too!
The chicken was flavorful and moist. The topping made it a great! Delicious combination. What an easy dish!
My boyfriend and I can't wait to have this again!

One of my favourite chicken dishes to make! I add a little extra cayenne pepper and use two avocados because I like the topping so much.

This is a refreshing light summer recipe. I laid mine stop fresh spinach. I doubled the recipe because it sounded so good!  Was I right. I added half the cayenne because I don't like things to spicy and it still had a good kick. I also added two small cucumbers deseeded and peeled. I also added two small sweet red and yellow pepper. It was enjoyed by all three of us for lunch. Thank you for the great recipe.

This recipe is great, quick, cheap, and nutritious. I used a lemon because I rarely have lime and it still tasted amazing. One half avocado and one half lemon juice, and about half a tablespoon of raw onion (I had white on hand). Just season the chicken and cook with a little olive oil. Perfect! I was worried about my cayenne burning but it made such a nice crisp! Yum. But becareful! I'm sure if I let it go any longer it may have burned. 

One tip, cut the breast in half! It'll cook more evenly and less guess work. :)

We loved this.  I used half of a yellow onion instead of a whole red and used just over half of the lime juice, but otherwise followed exactly.  Will make again!

I made it with pre-grilled chicken, so it didn't have the spicy rub.  The topping was delicious.  Next time I'll try it with the peppery seasoning.

I made this recipe tonight but added garlic powder to both the rub and the avocado spread. in addition I also added green chilies to the avocado and lowered the onion to half an onion. I also like things spicy so I added extra cayenne pepper to the rub and it was pure perfection. Love this recipe and would recommend to anyone. Delicious!

Total winner! I added sliced garlic to the pan when I stir fried the chicken (in my wok). It was delicious. For the avocado I used lemon juice instead of lime, tiny diced garlic instead of onion and added 1 tsp of superfruit balsamic vinaigrette. I served it on the side of wild rice with sautéed veggies. My fussy 13 year old devoured them both.

Great recipe! I added smoked Paprika & Cumin to the chicken after I applied the rub. I served it with roasted asparagus seasoned with lemon salt & olive oil, red pepper rice &  Margaritas-fresh squeezed lime, jalapeño, agave nectar & 100% agave Blanco Tequila.  My peeps loved everything!

very good - made for Andrew's 22nd birthday. I added garlic powder to the chicken and, for the salsa, used 1/4 c onion, 2 T real lemon juice, 2 avocados, 1 clove garlic, minced, salt and pepper, cilantro.

I really don't like avocados, but someone had given me a few and I was looking for something to do with them.  I followed this recipe exactly - except I diced the avocado very small and served it over the chicken on a bun as a chicken sandwich.  They were great for someone who doesn't even like avocados in the first place!

This was excellent! I made it with two changes. I added some chipotle cheese on top of the chicken for the last 2 minutes or so and because some reviewers mentioned that the red onion was overpowering, I sauteed it first til it was nice and soft, let it cool and then added it to the avocado and lime juice. I served it with salsa and sour cream.

Delicious! This was so good - spicy seasoning, chicken was juicy, and the lime and avocado made it very fresh and summery tasting. Will definitely make this again! Also very easy to make, too!

We enjoyed this, although I made several changes.  I grilled my chicken rather than frying it and I added garlic powder and onion powder.  For the avocado part, I left out the onion but added some lemon juice and salsa and just made it into guacamole.  Fabulous flavor!

LOVED this! Would have given 5 stars, except for the onion - definitely do not need one whole onion to one avocado. I'll assume this is a misprint. So delicious!

I thought this recipe was alright...I would make it again, but it was almost too simple. I would definitely cut down on the onion next time - it was overpowering. It was a simple and decent recipe.

I made this last night, and we loved it. I do agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that the onion to avocado was a bit of an "off" ratio, so I was careful to keep an eye on that.  I halved this recipe since I was only cooking for myself and my husband, so I used one avocado and about 1/3 of the onion. So, if I were to make this with four servings, I would probably want to use two avocados, and maybe one very small red onion. Shallots would also taste great in this recipe. I also added a little bit of garlic salt, just a personal taste. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is my first time cooking with avocado and I'd have to say this is a winner! This was super easy to make and everyone loved it. I agree with some of the other reviews regarding the red onion ratio. Next time I will be using less oion and more avocado for sure! I cooked it with Goya yellow rice and some mixed greens. Went well together.

Excellent chicken and avocado dish with loads of flavor, low in fat, high in anti-oxidants. I didn't have red onion so substituted with white onion and I wouldn't recommend that! If you do use the red onion, only use a small amount--maybe 1/4 cup? or less! Using a less ripe avocado would be helpful as well.

This recipe is great!  I had some avocado that needed to be used, so it hit the spot.  I loved the combination of cooked/not cooked ingredients, and so easy and quick.  I put some of the onion in with the chicken to cook, and also pounded the chicken to cook more quickly, but that is just personal preference.  I cook have used more cayenne pepper - but also personal preference.  Great recipe!

This looks great as is but since I am trying to cut most fat from my diet, I think I may "Shake and Bake" it then add the avocado mixture With added jalapenos, cilantro and garlic salt

These is delicious, fast and easy. Opted to not have the avocadoes since there are family members who don't like them, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I did saute the onion/lime juice out of personal preference.

Tried it and it was a hit with my family. I would recommend adding cilantro with the red onion and lime juice. Very easy, quick and simple.

I can’t do spicy, so I left out the cayenne. Still super tasty! My husband says it’s the best thing I’ve ever made. I didn’t have any cilantro on hand, but I would add it next time. I’m not much of a cook, so to have something so easy turn out so delicious was awesome!

I used all of the ingredients in the recipe but I did not put in as much onion or hot pepper.  Everyone I’m the house loved this recipe. It was flavorful and creamy. Making something creamy in a dairy free house is very unique. I loved how simple and quick it was to make. I highly recommend this dinner for a working mother during a  very  busy week.

Made this tonight. Basically followed the recipe.  Used the rub on the chicken. It was not spicy but had a nice flavor. I baked it in the oven with olive oil instead of on the stovetop. Used green onion instead of red.  Served it over sautéed spinach. My husband and I really enjoyed this tasty meal. A bonus is that it was very easy!

A great week night meal, quick, tasty and easy to prepare. The chicken took longer than 5 minutes per side.  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet and finished it in the oven (350 for 10 minutes). The avocado cream sauce had way to much onion. . I would suggest using half of a red onion.

Boyfriend thought this was wonderful... i however thought the chicken was bland with just the basic seasonings on it. will make again but this time add some onion powder/cumin or maybe just some more salt. A solid 4 star meal for me!

I happened to have grilled chicken and ripe avocado in the house. I needed to pick up some cayenne pepper, but figured it might be good go have around. Well, I know that for sure now, because I will be making this again. The seasoning on the chicken would be good enough to stand alone, but I love avocado with chicken. I think this dish will be quite popular with most people.

It was a little more salty than I prefer, so next time I'll only use half a teaspoon of salt for 2. I served mine on a bed of spinach that was misted with olive oil and it was so good.

add more cayenne pepper, add garlic, and add cilantro to the avocado/onion mix. definitely helps to use a higher avocado to onion ratio... like 2:1.

I usually do not favor pan cooked chicken, but gave this recipe a try since I had an avocado that needed to be eaten.  I absolutely loved it, and so did my "mister".  I will be using the left overs as a chicken salad sandwich by cutting or shredding the chicken and adding to the avocado mixture (if stored properly, won't brown).

I altered the recipe a little after reading the reviews.
I used 1 avocado and 1/4 onion for 2 chicken breasts. I didn't have a lime, so used lemon instead. I also smahsed in 1 clove of garlic into the avocado mixture. Garlic tasted really lovely with the spicy chicken!!

This is the best way I've found to eat a chicken breast. Avocado turned out so creamy and flavorful!

Easy, delicious and healthy!  I only had part of a red onion, but used that with a whole avocado and it was perfect. I sprinkled on cilantro at the last minute, just because I had it to use, and that was tasty. I will definitely make again but might try using some of my homemade taco seasoning from this web site to add more flavor to the chicken. A keeper!

Super easy to make and delicious. I cut up chicken breasts into smaller pieces/chunks and marinated in paprika, cayenne pepper nandos medium sauce and salt and pepper. Instead of onion I used spring (green) onions and it turned out great! A light enjoyable meal.

Flavour of spices on chicken really good but taste of onion was too overbearing and took away from other flavours.

I altered their recipe a little. When I sauteed the chicken I put lime juice in the pan. Then, when there is only about 5 minutes left for the chicken to cook I put about 3 tbsp. of yellow onion in with the chicken to give it more flavor (and I didn't have red onion). After you remove the chicken from the pan top with the sauteed onions and sliced avocado, squeeze lime over the whole thing. Delicious!

Really good!  This had a lot of flavor.  After reading other reviews, I used only one tablespoon of lime juice and grilled the whole onion.  I will make it the same way next time.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe with a cool start and a spicy finish!

The combination of heat from the cayenne and the spice from the black pepper and salt are rounded out perfectly by the coolness of the avocado, lime juice, and red onion.  Round that out with perfectly cooked chicken and this entree is a real winner.

Note: as I remember, the recipe is non-specific as to whether or not the avocado, lime juice, red onion sauce should be hot or cold I served it cold over the cooked chicken which seemed to further reduce the heat from the cayenne.

Definitely going in the recipe box!  Just the right amount of spice!  After I rubbed the chicken with the spices I very lightly breaded with Italian bread crumbs and baked.  My very picky boys wanted seconds!

made it as written- but in the picture I thought there was bacon pieces on top and I had already opened a bag of bacon bits before I found out they weren't in the recipe.  I added them- very tasty dish

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.  It was not spicy at all and too salty (I followed the recipe exactly).  Will never make again.  Was upset too because I was on a roll with using highly rated recipes on this website, and my husband was beginning to think I was some type of master chef.

The lime/onion/avocado mix perfectly balanced the salty/spiciness of the chicken. Was more liberal with the seasonings. Great recipe!

The spice rub made the chicken pop and the avocado, onion and lime juice toping was so good. I would cut back on the amount of onion, but that is very subjective.

Recipe was delicious and easy. Would recommend cutting onions in longer round slices instead of diced to have them a little larger and absorb more flavor.

This was easy and very flavorful.   I'll use the avocado topping on BBQ chicken and pork loin too.  Would serve to guests in a heart beat

This dish was sooo good.  I choose to use Emeril's chicken rub on it, along with kosher sale (just a little) and black pepper and also added fresh tomatoes to my onions.  It was really great.  Next time I'll try it on tilapia or salmon.  Very good with yellow rice.

This recipe was good but nothing to write home about.  Maybe next time I'll follow other reviewers' suggestion and add some fresh cilantro to give it some added punch.

Kitchen version to bulky. I prefer your print version to the kitchen version. Please don't ever change it. Avocado chicken is a fantastic dish also.
