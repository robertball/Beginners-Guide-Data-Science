We've been making these for 20+ years.  Use Bacardi frozen margarita mix if possible.  It's so much better than making with Limeade.  Only one bottle of 7-Up, not two.  You have to use Corona!  I'm not sure about the ounces of Tequila.  We eyeball it in the bacardi can.  1/2-3/4 full depending on your personal taste or how much you've had to drink.  ;-)  I've converted many of my friends who now only make margaritas this way.

We enjoyed these very much. They were light , refreshing, and screamed summer time.  I did think 12 ounces of tequila was too much so I started out with 8 ounces first and that ended up being perfect for me. I definitely recommend starting with less and tasting as you go until you get it where you like it.  These flavors work great together and I already can't wait to make them again. I'm going to try them slushy style next instead of on the rocks.
