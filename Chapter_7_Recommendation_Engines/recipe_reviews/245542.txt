Lets try this again lol... So as I was saying no one really noticed the bacon so Id suggest doubling the bacon and the other thing I would suggest is making double the cheese sauce as I  found the sauce soooo good but didn't seem like enough to me I think id it really saucy. My mother and sister in law thought it was enough but I guess its all a matter of preference. Regardless this was definitely a keeper and I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.

It was easy to make, we used onion tots doubled the bacon but something still seemed to be missing in the flavor.  Served it's purpose but not sure I'd make this one again.

What's not to love?! I used American cheese in the sauce instead of cheddar, but that was my only change. YUM, YUM, YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Added some broccoli and made a dinner out of it. Family loved it and will surely be cooked again.

It was great tasting and easy to make!   I made it for my family so I made a smaller  amount and just adjusted the recipe.  I did add more bacon.   I'm sure I'll make it again!

I'm not a tater tot lover, but made it for a birthday party, and it was unbelievable.  Made exactly as directed but did add just a bit more sour cream to the  cheese sauce.  Make sure the tater tots are good and crispy before the sauce is added.  There will be no leftovers!
