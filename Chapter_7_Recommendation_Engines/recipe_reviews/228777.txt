I used coconut oil in place of butter. It made a huge difference. This is super amazing recipe. Must try!

These really are decadent.  I made them as directed, but only had 2/3 cup of coconut and used chocolate syrup instead of hot fudge topping as that is what I had on hand.  I had my doubts when I took it out of the oven and sprinkled the coconut on.  It scattered and didn't adhere to the dry surface.  But then when I drizzled the caramel and chocolate it melded into a delicious topping that adhered well.  Very delicious and rich, great recipe!

These are incredible, I also did a variation using marshmallow instead of caramel and they turned out well too. :)

This recipe could have been really great...if it wasn't so awfully sweet.  As it was, I reduced the sugar by 1 cup, used unsweetened coconut, didn't add the chocolate chips, and added 3/4 cup toasted pecans, and didn't put the topping on afterward.  It was still almost inedible, except with a strong cup of coffee.
The flavor was good (especially with the addition of the nuts), but I suspect 1.5-2 cups of sugar would be plenty. If you're going to add the chocolate chips, I wouldn't put that many and I'd try to use dark ones to cut down on the sweetness.
They are nice and gooey, however.
