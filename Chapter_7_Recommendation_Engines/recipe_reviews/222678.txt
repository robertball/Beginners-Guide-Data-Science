A message from the Author. I appreciate having this recipe published. Thanks. For the original recipe refer to my recipe box and the original is right next to it. The cooked meat means browned. I also leave the sausage in tact but do puncture it with a fork to allow the fats to go into the sauce wile browning it. I only remove the meat from the casing to mix with meatballs.

I made this recipe exactly as listed but omited the ox tails as I didn't think my Italian family would eat themGreat recipe full of flavour. I made this to go along with brascole and linguine pasta. Came out wonderful .The smell in my kitchen was like I died and went to heaven. Everyone licked their lips and fingers at dinner. Thanks for the great meal!!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  Well worth taking the time to make it.  Hubby was in heaven.  Only change that I made was to use canned crushed tomatoes

Growing up, my family (me, mom & dad, and 4 brothers) spent a great deal of time at my aunt's (mom's sister) & uncle's house; as it happened, my uncle was 100% Italian, and they had 7 kids.  Legend has it, that our 2 families didn't have much choice but to hangout together, as none of the rest of the family wanted to hang around all of us kids! LOL  Anyway, reading your recipe brought back such wonderful memories of my uncle always telling everyone: "Stir the sauce!!"  I've never been able to get the recipe?? because like yours, no one ever wrote it down. As I type this, your recipe simmering on my stove top. I'll have to update my post, sharing the quality, when it is done & after we eat. At this point I can only say that it smells awesome! Thank you so much for sharing!!
