These cookies were very good.  Easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used butter instead of shortening.  Sorry but I never use shortening.  I also used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa powder as I love the dark chocolate flavor.  Did not taste much of the peanut butter flavor and not sure how to correct that.  Will have to experiment a little bit.

I've made peanut butter blossoms before, but not with chocolate, and not rolled in sugar before baking. These were absolutely delicious! I'm not a big PB & Chocolate fan, and I think the addition of the cocoa powder to the mix really takes that strong PB flavor down, while still having an authentic flavor. The sugar helped make them a little chewy with a slight crunch that didn't complete crumble apart like other PB blossoms, and all in all, I would for sure make them again! Made a double batch in my Kitchenaid mixer bowl using the paddle attachment and had absolutely no issues.

We loved these gems!  My oven is off but they came out perfect in 10 minutes. I only made a half batch following the recipe exactly except I used Milk Chocolate Kisses. The first batch rolled nicely, I should have chilled the remaining dough with a cover.  Loved the rolled sugar and using the Reynolds Parchment Paper! Will make these again:)

These were a great subtle twist on a classic favorite.  I ended up yielding 42 smallish cookies.  As I was rolling the balls, I noted some of the chocolate/PB hadn't fully mixed.  Partially because I kind of dug the swirled look and mostly because I"m lazy, I left them as they were with no issues.  My only slight criticism is I had some breakage issues w/a few of the cookies when I pressed in the kiss (and they weren't overdone, which would make the breakage make sense due to dryness).  I used milk chocolate kisses because I'm not a dark chocolate fan and had about 15 kisses leftover from a "regular" sized package of holiday kisses.  I must admit I was happy to not to have to find room in the already loaded dishwasher for the baking pans since I'd used the Reynolds (R) precut cookie sheets (which they provided, but is not skewing my review; I'm not that easily bought...).  THANKS for the recipe!

Great spin on typical peanut butter blossoms! I veganized it with banana instead of eggs and coconut oil instead of butter and vegan chocolate on top. So so good.

LOVED these! Peanut Butter Blossoms are my favorite cookies of all time but these just took it up a notch! The addition of chocolate to the dough and using dark chocolate kisses made the traditional blossoms even better! They are so easy to make and the Reynolds Parchment helps with simple removal and clean-up! Will definitely be making these again!

This is a beautiful tasty cookie, with a light peanut butter flavor. The dough is easy to work with and they are pretty enough for any cookie exchange.

I made a Gluten Free version of this recipe using 1/2 each of Rice Flour, Tapioca Flour & Sorghum Flour and a 1/2 tsp Xanthan Gum.  They came out great.

Fabulous!  I love peanut blossoms anyway, they are a favorite in our house so the addition of chocolate in the peanut butter dough is great. The dark chocolate kisses are nice but personally I like milk chocolate so I did some of each to please everyone in the family.  The Reynolds parchment paper just makes the job so easy and clean up so quick.  #MealMagic  #AllStarsReynolds

We liked these very much! I thought the extra sugar on the outside was a nice touch, gave these cookies a slightly different texture than other versions. The parchment paper was a great idea! Thanks for the recipe!

Well, the flavor of these was unbelievably good!  Dough looked like chocolate dough, but with good peanut butter flavor.  But we had issues with the cookies falling apart after placing the chocolate kisses on them, and I mean crumbling to bits.  I did notice that even though you could press the dough together, it was still a bit crumbly.  I will try these again, but will maybe chill the dough before making them.

This recipe was great!  I just substituted in butter instead if shortening, and my kids added sprinkles to the sugar for rolling the dough ball in.

I made this for my culinary final. A little too sweet; probably won't roll in sugar next time. I also didn't completely mix in the cocoa, so the cookies had a nice swirled look. Teacher thought it was great! 90%

Easy and tasty. The cocoa adds just enough of a chocolatey flavor to the peanut butter cookie.

I followed the instructions carefully, even chilling the dough for a bit. I was delighted with this recipe though I did bake the cookies for 14 minutes per batch. My kisses melted & cooled nicely and don't fall out of the cookie base. So happy with my 11 dozen that'll be traded at next week's office cookie exchange.

They crumbled even when I lightly pushed the kiss on top. They would not hold their shape and instantly crumbled.

I was looking for regular peanut butter cookies, when I found this recipe.  Glad I did.  Made these exactly like the recipe states and they came out nicely.  I used buttery Crisco shortening instead of regular, but next time I may just use regular butter.  Rich and delicious.  Thank you.

This recipe is great and a keeper! Cookies baked perfectly and taste fabulous. I followed the recipe using chunky peanut butter.  Since I wasn't power baking, I baked 1 pan at a time and didn't need to worry about rotating pans. Thank you.

Instead of rolling the dough in sugar before baking, I rolled some of them in rainbow dot sprinkles, which gave them a very festive look for my friend's birthday. I only rolled the top half of each cookie. I do think the sprinkles may have made it harder for the Hershey kisses to stick to the cookies, as some fell off in transit, but it was still worth the colorful effect! I wish I took a pic before everyone ate them. I also replaced the shortening with butter... not a shortening fan, and the recipe still worked great. Would make again!

These were so easy to make and they tasted great. My grandson and my husband couldn't get enough of them. Though my husband didn't taste the peanut butter until I told him it had peanut butter in them. I liked baking with the Parchment paper. It made it so easy to keep the cookies going with less of a mess. Love it and the cookies. Followed the recipe exactly.

These were so easy to make and delicious!  Just follow the instructions to the letter and you're guaranteed to succeed.  My daughter had a great time helping out, too. Definitely a keeper!
