fantastic, cook at least 40 mins at 400, then a few minutes under broiler. Bake on cookie sheet to get bottom edges brown. Do not use glass pan from micro wave

WOW! This was amazing. I made exactly as written and this turned out perfectly. It comes out of the oven gorgeous and would make a lovely presentation for company. Be sure to spread the mayo mix around the sides and as much of the bottom of the cauliflower as you can. It was basically like frosting a cake but not. Super fun recipe and one that will not disappoint!
