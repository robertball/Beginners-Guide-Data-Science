Delicious!! Instead of tofu, I used about 2 cups of TVP. Nobody even noticed that the TVP wasn't ground beef!  Instead of all black beans, I used kidney, great northern, black, and pinto beans to give it a variety of color, texture and flavor.  I also added some frozen corn to give it a little something extra.  This is a delicious recipe and I will definitley use it again!  If I am making it for just my husband and me, I will atleast halve this recipe as it makes alot!!

Absolutely delicious - REALLY spicy, the mention of guacamole and sour cream is not really a suggestion.  The chili had a great full body and did not seem too watery.  A couple minor changes/substitutions I made - 1/2 less onion, 1/2 T of red pepper powder instead of Tabasco (I was out), 1 can of kidney beans instead of black beans (again, I was out).  Even my carnivorous fiancee approved.

This is the best chili I've ever had.  As a recently new vegetarian I was surprised as the tofu tastes just like meat!  You'd never miss the meat.  My carnivorous boyfriend  loved it.  I halved the recipe and it easily could of fed 6, so it makes A LOT!  I'm not the biggest chili fan but I never thought to serve it with nachos, guacumoule, sour cream and cheese, a la Mexican style.  Great idea and I'll totally make this one regularly.

Family and friends loved this chili!! I substituted Morning Star Vegetable Crumbles (it looks like pre-cooked hamburger) for the tofu and nobody knew that it was a vegetarian dish. Absolutely tasty!!!!

this recipe was really tasty! i cut back on the chili powder a bit to suit our tastes. the only problem i had was that it got a bit soupy by the end of cook time - so i added about 1 cup of cornstarch to thicken it up and it was delicious!

This recipe was flavourful and so tasty.  I liked the combination of the different spices.  I nixed the tofu and added a can of chickpeas and corn - it added a very good texture to the chili.

Yummy! We will never go back to regular chili again. I tried this recipe today for the first time and it seemed like a lot of food so I halved it and even then it almost filled my regular size slow cooker.   It was awesome....didn't miss the meat at all.  We don't like chili too spicy so we used less than half of the chili and hot sauce that was called for.  I would recommend this to anyone, vegetarian or not.

This was great! I've been looking for a slow cooker vegetarian chili for awhile. The only changes I made were using 2 cans of black beans, and 2 cans of white beans (what was in the pantry). I also eliminated the tabasco sauce and chili powder (not usually in a college student's pantry) and it still came out great!

I've been making this chili for a while now. Here's what I do:  I don't saute the veggies before hand anymore, the oil is just added calories..throw them in raw.  This is way too much for my slow cooker. I halve most spices, garlic powder for ease, 2 cans black beans, 1 can kidney beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes (one being spiced). I don't use tofu or any meat substitute, as the 3 cans of beans really is enough substance.  So after those changes, I'm not sure that it's "fair" to rate it since I changed a lot of things - but I'm still going to. It's great as written, but as with all recipes - you'll eventually find what works best for you.  I also sometimes add a little cinnamon or a small square of chocolate to change things up a bit and make it a slightly sweet chili.

I'm eating the leftovers of this as I write this.  (It's even better the next day!!)  I made several modifications, but it's a great base recipe to customize to your own liking.  Here's what I did: -Cut the recipe by half so it wouldn't overflow my slow cooker -Used 1 can black, 1 can garbanzo, 1 can vegetarian baked beans -Omitted the tofu -Used garlic "powder" instead of cloves -Omitted oregano b/c I didn't have any -Added 6 oz of Shock Top beer -I was going to put in the veggies without sauteeing, but at the last minute I decided to sautee b/c I feel like it enhances the flavor  With the baked beans and beer, mine has a slightly sweeter edge to it, which I personally love.  Spicy and sweet!  The author of this recipe is right, it really is "meaty" and SO EASY!  It turned out looking almost identical to the pic.  Inexperienced cooks, try this one without fear.

A wonderful balance of flavors that pleased my mix of meat and non-meat eaters. I was worried about the size of my slow cooker but everything just fit into my 6QT crock.  Like a few others I used veggie crumbles rather than tofu. I was worried they would disintegrate over 6 hours of cooking so I added them in the last hour and they maintained they're ground beefy texture.  This is not a spicy chili but those who wanted to crank up the heat could easily add cayenne. Bravo, Simone.

This has been my go-to chili for about two years. I LOVE it. Tons of veggies and protein, but pretty low in fat/calories. The only revision I made is cutting the oil down to about 1 tbs. It works just as well!  I've reviewed it at my blog: http://therecreationalgourmet.com/content/recipe-review-meatiest-vegetarian-chili

Great recipe.  Made it for pot luck and it was a huge hit.  I couldn't tell the difference between this and chili made with ground beef.  Ratios of beans to peppers to tomato was perfect.  Used 4 cans of beans as called for but mixed them up (black, red kidney, pinto, great northern).  Thought it needed to be kicked up with seasoning so added a minced jalapeno, an extra teaspoon cumin, and a tablespoon of italian seasoning. Used a very spicy habanero sauce for the hot sauce, and added a dash at a time, retasting every hour until right amount of heat.  Also used that fake soy ground beef stuff instead of tofu.

This was awesome!! The vinegar scared me a little, but I love the result.  Since my husband and I are dieting, I used 1/2 cup broth instead of the olive oil to simmer the vetables in.  The flavor did not suffer at all without the oil.  Will be making this again!!!

Excellent - We served alongside some elk chili in a crowd of mostly meat eaters and 2 true vegetarians.  There were no leftovers. Made exactly as stated, except in the dutch oven instead of the crock pot.   Spices were perfect for my 18 month old daughter - not sure about the reviews that said it was too spicy.

Great chile, my husband and I were both very impressed.  The only thing I might do differently is to saute the tofu separately because with so many things in the pot at the end, they could not be "lightly browned" as the recipe said.  However, it might not make a difference and we liked the tofu in it regardless.  Otherwise, I don't think I will make any huge modifications to this recipe in the future, but I will make it again.  An amazing vegetarian option that does not sacrifice any flavor when the meat is gone!

This recipe is an excellent chili all on its own but can also be used as a base to do some personalizing. I made it with morningstar crumbles instead of the tofu. We also like our chili with chunks of tomatoes so I added to 15oz cans of diced tomatoes with the juice (which makes it go further and balances out the thickness the crumbles add to it). if you want it with more (like my hubbie) cut the chili powder in half and add a mccormick HOT chili spice packet. I've even made it with 1 cup of guinness stout and it gives it a great depth of flavor (turn the veggies up to a high head at the end of cooking them, add the guiness & cook for a few minutes).

I was skeptical about this, but it turned out really good.  I didn't have cumin, so I left that out.  I was also out of canned tomatoes, so I put fresh Romas in a food processor.    I think next time I make this, I will crumble the tofu.  I didn't really like the cubes.

This recipe was delicious! I'm trying to be healthier, and it is a great option and you can play around with it to your heart's content. Myself, I added a can of sweet corn, garbanzo beans, and substituted seitan for the firm tofu-- I find it has a firmer, more "meaty" texture. I also added about a teaspoon of brown sugar to cancel out the acidity, which I think really added a lot. I halved this recipe and it still was a LOT of food... probably at least 4-6 servings. Enjoy!

My husband is a vegetarian who doesn't like a lot of vegetables, so as you can imagine cooking for him is a nightmare.  He absolutely LOVED this chili!  Using black beans instead of kidney beans was a delightful taste and texture.  I will forwarn you about one thing while preparing the onion/pepper saute':  If you don't have an EXTRA large skillet (assuming you're cooking the entire 8 servings), it will become an absolute mess and the veggies won't brown. I ended up having to take the mixture and transfer half of it to another large skillet in order for it to brown.  That aside, it was easy and delicious!!

Not at all what I expected from all the hype.  Definitely decent chili, but 5 stars?  No.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I was not very impressed.  Sure, it was spicy.  But flavorless.  

3 stars though!  Better than most!

This is really good!  I oopsed and added the tofu to the tomatoes in the slowcooker rather than mixing it into the vegetables in the skillet, but it still tasted great.  I also crumbled the tofu rather than cutting it into cubes-- it's much less noticeable that way.  Two carnivores never noticed they weren't eating meat.  And whoever said that this is too spicy?  I used maybe 5 tablespoons of chili powder because of others' comments, but next time I'll use 6 heaping tablespoons, to give it a bit of kick.  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I've switched to another brand of chili powder, and now I only use 3 tbsp. The quantity you use depends not only on how well you tolerate spiciness, but also on the type and age of your spices.

This was delicious! I halved the recipe (from 8 to 4), used a can of corn in place of one of the cans of beans, sliced 2 carrots and cooked them at the same time as the onions, used only 1 tablespoon of chili powder (all I had) but 2 tbs of Tabasco and threw in a bit of ground cayenne pepper, thickened it with a 1/2 cup corn starch in the last hour and garnished with sour cream and cheese. Thank you to the original person who posted this and all of the excellent tips provided by others!

This was a great recipe. I took it to a family reunion with the intention of having something vegetarian for myself and everyone (even the meat eaters) loved it! I used a variety of different beans, left out the tofu, added mushrooms and added 2 tbsp of brown sugar to cut the spiciness a little because I wanted the older family members and kids to be able to enjoy it also.

My daughter has been loving this recipe for two years now (she's 10 now). At school she is known as the "chili" girl. The main thing is that she will not eat it unless it has meat. So I used this recipe with the following changes: 1/4 onion, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 yellow pepper, 1 to 1 1/2 lbs of ground meat of your choice, garlic salt instead of regular salt, 3 tbs of chili powder (she doesn't like it spicy) and no hot sauce. Follow the instructions for cooking in the slow cooker. I freeze portions in freezer bags. She says that it taste better after freezing. Maybe flavor fusion? She will take this chili over a sandwich any day! I'll keep the original version for my hubby;) Thank you for sharing.

I am no longer afraid of tofu!  My meat-loving, tofu-hating husband had seconds, and declared it great chili.  Made exactly as written.  Will make again and again.

This recipe is TRULY IMPRESSIVE, and this is coming from a newly-converted vegetarian! I had always thought that juicy beef made good chili. No, I was wrong! As this recipe demonstrates, it is the right choice and proportion of veggies and spices that blends the flavor and texture together that makes this chili outstanding. I halved the recipe but followed the ingredients proportion exactly. I do not have a slow cooker so I simmered it in a pot on stovetop for about 2.5 hours. The "mountain" of chopped veggies was reduced quite a bit at the end, and gives a thick, authentic consistency. All the spices are just right. Thank you so much for this recipe -- I have no regret turning vegetarian!

I added 2 large yukon potatoes and a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar. This was definitely the heartiest and tastiest vegetarian chili I have tried so far. 

1/2 cup of oil is not at all necessary, I added less than 2 tablespoons and it was totally fine, definitely would NOT add the full 1/2 cup. 

I highly recommend trying potatoes as an addition!!

I tried this from the slow cooker only an hour after I started because it smelled so good. It was amazing. But when I served it five hours later it wasn't as good, just ok. Maybe I cooked it too long?

We made this recipe exactly as it is written and most of the family really liked it. However, I agree that it had too much seasoning, which took away from the flavors of all the other ingredients. Next time I will try and remove a few things, but overall this was a good recipe- especially for how wonderfully healthy it is!

Although I reduced the chili powder by 1/3, this chili tasted awful to me.  I think it was too spicy, had a burnt taste, and maybe too much cumin, and/or the crushed tomatoes I used, an organic name brand, tasted bad.  I tried to doctor it by adding diced tomatoes, then sugar, but neither my husband nor I wanted to eat it.

Best Chili -even my carnivore hubby loved it and begged for more!  Halfed the chili powder and nixed the hot sauce for my delicately paleted family.  Also used tvp and one less can of beans and it was rockin:).

This is a fabulous recipe.  We all love it in my house & have shared it with family and friends. I always get requests for it when it is my turn to cook at my work's "Lunch Club."  However, it is far too hot for most of us w/ all 6 tablespoons of chili powder and the Tabasco.  I just halve that during the prep and put out the Tabasco (along with the sour cream and shredded cheddar) when serving for those that like it spicier. Bon Appetit!

I used a slight variation of this recipe and won best vegetarian chili at a work competion.  The only changes I made were to subtract one onion, substituted two cans of black beans with two cans of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans, and substituted 2 tablespoons of regular chili powder with chipotle chili powder (ran out of the regular).  Turned out great and wasn't too spicy.

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was use Yves Veggie Ground Round in place of the tofu, and added celery and mushrooms (because I love them!) My meat loving father raved about it and probably wouldn't have even known it was veggie if I didn't tell him!

This recipe is awesome for a vegetarian.  I have now made it about 3-4 times in big batches and get better with each tweek of some ingrediants. I don't that much oil but probably 2 TBS and let the veggies steam rather than fry in the pan. I'm Asian Indian so add more garlic and chili to taste and I don't use salt (the tomato makes up for it) I've tried it with tofu and soy beef and i have to say i like it with soy beef better. I also add in other veggies such as carrots and dice them up very very tiny. Great recipe!!!

Fab, Simone. My wife is (perpetually) dieting (hope I spelled that correctly, I can 't remember ever using the word  before). we both like chili, so I have made this a  few times. I make this with a mix of black and pinto beans.  And the wife and I being heater eaters, I skip the  hot sauce and use serrano peppers.  Purr-fection. I also leave out the tofu and don't miss it at all. And I always want a can of mushrooms in it.  WOW!! Many thanks, Simone.

I made this chili for the first time today, and I was very pleased with the outcome. There are, however, some problems with the recipe. It does not specify how large of a crock pot you will need, and I think that would be helpful, because it barely fit into mine. I even reduced the volume by using 2 large onions instead of 4 onions. I used 4 green peppers rather than 2 of each, because I think they have the best flavor. Near the end, the chili was quite watery, so I added a half cup of cornmeal which thickened it up quite well. Next time I intend to use a can of Ro*Tel (chopped tomatoes and chilies) and a can of tomatoes instead of two cans of tomatoes. This recipe was not spicy to me at all, but not all powdered chili pepper brands are equal. I am very pleased with this recipe overall.

This stuff is the best thing since chili, i'm a college student and was left with a crock pot buy my mother. I was worried i would never get to use it and when i saw the recipe i couldn't pass this up. I went to bed and this morning it came out great! I had to cut the ingredients in half though since i have a medium size pot. other than that i love the spicyness and flavor!

I've made this a few times and I think it is the best vegetarian chili I have ever had.  I only use about 2 Tbsp. of oil, just enought to saute the veggies, and it comes out just as good.  I've made it with Morningstar Farm crumbles instead of tofu, and I like it both ways.  This is a staple for me in the winter!

Really Good!  I made it as directed, except after reading that it was very spicy, I added only 4 of the 6 table spoons of chili powder and omitted the hot sauce.  It still came out slightly spicy, but not over the top!  I added mushrooms, celery and substituted kidney beans and white beans for three of the cans of beans and had one can of black beans.  It was VERY good!  Even my picky teens liked it! (:

Perfect. I cut the recipe in half and cut the Tabasco sauce by a 1/3 because the kids were scared of the the hot flavor. No loss in flavor.

I like spicy food, but this chili was inedibly spicy, even though I used only 3/4 the amount of chili powder called for and no pepper sauce. I guess different chili powders vary greatly in how spicy they are. I recommend using only 1 tablespoon to start with, and then adding more to taste.

I was a little unsure of this chili when it was cooking, but it tasted really good!  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is for a few reasons:  1) Prep time was longer than stated.  Easy to make but it took a little time to cut up all veggies and tofu.  It also took quite a bit of time for everything to brown up before I could put it in the crock pot - maybe my pan wasn't hot enough.  2)  There should be a note in this recipe that you need a very large crock pot to prepare this.  My crock pot is of average size and this was virtually overflowing.  I cut back on some of the ingredients and it was still leaking out of the pot.  3)  The taste was good, but I did cut back on the onions and the chili powder and left out the hot sauce.
Overall, a very good recipe.

This was really good; the chili flavor was like a meaty chili and not predominantly vegetable flavored as some veggie chilis are. The red bell pepper was particularly good. I added the tofu as it said but I think in the future I'd try soy burger. Even in the slow cooker all day the tofu just didn't taste like much. Also, I used half the onion it said and it was fine.

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe and cooked on LOW for 6 hours.  Nice spice to it but not too hot.  Replaced the green pepper for orange just because I liked the colour!

This was my first vegetarian chili and I can honestly say it was better than expected! The only change I made was instead of 6 tablespoons of chili powder I only used 3.

This was really good after you get past how spicy it was. I followed the recipe just as written with the exception of cooking it on the stove rather than in the crockpot. I will make this again but I will cut the chili powder probably in half next time.

I served this to my meat eating friends and they could not believe it.  Some saying it was better than "Moms".  I put in some vegetarian meat crumbles the last hour which made it a little thicker.  Will make this again.

Since I prefer spicy I added some additional hot spices.  Leaving that aside this is a perfect dish for an easy lunch or a hearty dinner.  Quite good.

This is very tasty - my meat-eating husband even enjoyed 2 bowls.!!  We substituted boca crumbles for tofu, and only1 large onion and added a little water to cook as it looked a tad too dry when all the ingredients were added to the crock pot.  Will definately make this again

The taste was very, very good.  We followed the recipe exactly.  I wish I read some of the warnings from other reviewers about the chili powder.  I guess it does depend upon the brand of chili powder.  We love hot and spicy foods, but the combination of the six tablespoons of chili powder and the one tablespoon of hot sauce was WAY too much with our Indian chili powder.  Mouth, nose, eye and ear burning - enough that I ran to the store to get sour cream and plain yogurt to cool it down during the middle of dinner!    The next time we'll use only two tablespoons of powder, and add hot sauce at the table if it needs it.  It's easy to add more heat that way.  It's hard to remove the heat once it's in there.

This recipe was tasty but it had too much salt.  I think there are a couple of reasons for this: I used Morningstar veggie crumbles instead of tofu and they are salted, chili powder already has salt in it, canned beans and tomatoes are also already salted.  You may want to hold off on adding the salt until you've cooked it for a while and then tasted it.  I also agree that it is very spicy and could use a bit less chili powder.  (Reducing the chili powder could also help reduce the salt.)

So delicious!  The recipe is enormous, so I halve it for about four servings total.  I also reduce the amount of chili powder because I don't like food really hot.  I've also made it on the stove top when I don't have time to slow-cook it and it is DELICIOUS.  I've been making it two or three times a month since I found it.  The inclusion of tofu is brilliant.

I invited both vegetarian and meat-loving friends over to enjoy this chili.  It was a hit!  I cooked a bag of black beans in place of the canned.  I also cut back a bit on the chili powder and hot sauce because my husband doesn't like it too spicy.  Next time I would use the additional spice because my guests and I were adding hot sauce to our bowls for extra kick.

I made mine with both the firm cubed tofu and the Morningstar farms veggie crumbles. I think without the crumbles it would not have had enough texture.  I also added 1 can of Rotel because we like things spicy.  It tastes great on tortilla chips with sour cream and guacamole!

I loved this! I did change a bit, I used white beans and didn't drain, and also added some water, I like stuff soupy. I didn't have tofu, but I like to add potatoes instead, they really taste good after 8 hours. I have made this many times, my husband and I love having it on a cold day!!

great chili!  i used kidney beans for a more traditional chili. i also didn't have any oregano so that was left out.  its a very thick chili so i used additional liquid to have a more soup/chili consistency.  i used about 1 cup of tomato juice but water would work fine too.   i will definitely make this again soon!

So I am one of those terrible reviewers who modified the recipe. I put in half the required onions, omitted the peppers, and omitted the tabasco sauce. What a great base for a recipe! I am not a vegetarian and I have to admit I am not completely used to eating tofu. However, the blend of spices and ingredients in this recipe made for an amazing chili. I didn't miss the meat all. This is definitely worth making. Also it is super easy to make and tastes better than anything out of a can. Update: I had my mom try this chili. She has never had tofu before and turns up her nose at the thought. She loved it! In fact, she wants me to make another batch just for her.

Best chili I have ever made.  I used the Morning Star Grillers Crumbles instead of tofu (one 12oz bag).  For the beans I also used a mixture (two can pinto, one can black, and one can kidney).  then only other change I made was to use 5 TBSP of chili powder as that was all I had left.  Mine did not turn out too runny as others noted.  And it does make a good bit, about 4 quarts.

This recipe was very satisfactory to all of my guests, even though I was the only vegetarian present.  I didn't attempt to "fool" my guests (this is so cruel), but prepared them ahead of time I was preparing a vegetarian chili.  They really enjoyed the spicy flavor.  I served the chili with vegan cheese and a tofu sour cream, fresh coleslaw (prepared with veganaise), and homemade rolls.  My non-vegan family and friends truly enjoyed this animal-friendly meal.

I got the peppers for this ages ago, then kept getting side-tracked (it is tax season, so I have little time to cook).  By the time I was ready to make it today, only one green pepper was still good.  BUT THIS WAS STILL DELICIOUS!
Mods: 1 green pepper, only 3 tsps chili powder (bf doesn't like too much spiciness), half the salt, froze the tofu, and for beans I used 2 cups garbanzos, one small can red kidneys (rinsed), and one pound dried black (cooked up).  This recipe smelled delicious while cooking and was so perfect.  I topped mine with a bit extra Frank's Red Hot and cheddar.  BF mixed in cheddar and sour cream. *so happy*  ALSO the recipe yield is accurate, don't add more liquid, and the recipe filled my 6-qt slow cooker.
Take 2: 4 tsp chili, cattle beans in place of black, all peppers included, no tofu
Take 4: 5 tsp chili, 6 cups cattle/soldier beans, 2 cups black, 1 can kidney beans
Take X: 2 Tbs (6 tsp) chili, 6+ cups black beans, 2 cups garbanzos, 1 can kidneys, three green pepper and one red, and I only had three onions in the house

Great recipe!  I don't like bell peppers, so I left them out and added corn.  Also, I couldn't find black beans, so I used kidney beans and cannelloni beans instead.  I decided to make this around 4 pm, so I opted to cook on the stove, and it still came out absolutely amazing!  Will make many more times!

Wow!  What a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing this one.  I did add the Morningstar Farms recipe crumbles as well.  Also used 1 can black beans & 1 can of dark kidney beans, as well as no salt added, organic canned tomatoes.  Next time I will omit the oregano and use cumin, fresh cilantro and a bit of lime juice for more of a TexMex flavor.

I would have given the recipe a full 5 stars, had it not turned out extremely hot to the taste.  I followed the instructions to the letter and just halved the recipe as described, however, it was way too spicy.  I then needed to add more beans, more tomatoes, and even a little honey to try to cut down on the spiciness and found myself with a very large pot of chili....enough to feed "The Waltons" on TV.  When I prepare it again, I will definitely eliminate a lot of the extra heat by leaving out the hot sauce and some of the chili powder.

This recipe came out fairly well. I overdid it on the spices but I did not notice any drawbacks to accidentally confusing teaspoon with tablespoon. I never really indulged in chili while I was a non-vegetarian, but this is one dish I would not hesitate to make again during the week.

In my version, I used 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of kidney beans. In addition to the Tofu, I also added vegan meat crumbles and it really made the chili texture awesome. I think it could use a little more kick so next time I am going to add 7 tablespoons of Chili Powder and a little more hot sauce.

Loved this veggie version chili. I cut back chili powder to 4 T and left out the Tabasco but added half of a jalapeno pepper finely diced with the onions and peppers. Also, we like tomatoes so added a 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes. The  pot was full and so were our tummies. My husband really liked this and it will be a winter staple in our household.

This was a delicious chili. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ingredients overflowed my slow cooker (literally it started bubbled out the sides of the lid and made quite a mess). I think next time I will make 3/4 the recipe (but keep the same amount of tofu). My 11-year-old son and husband also loved it. My 9-year-old son wouldn't touch it but he is extremely picky.

Not bad but seems like it's missing something.  I substituted veggie ground beef for the tofu and used raw veggies instead of sauteing them (just easier to throw it all in the crock before heading off to work).  It had a great flavor but seemed too mushy throughout.  Need a chewier or crunchy texture to go with it.  Might try this again after trying a few others first.

Excellent chili that I will continue to make.  I may have done things a little differently than suggested: rinsed the canned beans, used no-salt chili pepper, froze and thawed the extra firm tofu, and used rooster sauce as the hot sauce.  It turned out terrific!

This chili was delicious hands down! The only things I changed were replacing one can of black beans for a can of kidney beans and I only used one large onion as I am not a big fan of onions. The chili tastes incredible on nachos, with cheese on top and rice, and even as the sauce for huevos rancheros.

The is really one of the best chili recipes that I have found! I also halved the recipe and used veggie burger crumbles, but I only used about half the onion and instead of black beans I used one can of light red kidney beans and one of dark red kidney to make it more like regular chili. The only other thing that I did differently was instead of using a red pepper I used a yellow one which is think added some nice color to the dish. I added some cheddar chese and ate it with tortilla chips. It was excellent!! I will deffinately make it again!

I loved this recipe.  Like kimberleyowen who reviewed last year, I substituted the Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles.  I have served this to neighbors and friends and every one loves it.  Quick and easy, too.

This was my first time trying a veggie version & im thrilled to say this will now be my go to recipe for chili. I also used the morning star crumbles, rotel & varied the beans as other people had suggested. Thank You for a great start to my Vegetarian Collection.

I followed the recipe fairly accurately, but for some reason, the tofu didn't blend in well.  It looked very unappealing - little white blobs floating in it.  The chili smelled great, and probably would have been very good, but we couldn't get past the weird look of it.  Maybe I did something wrong?  But I was disappointed as this got so many great reviews.

Made this for a party with vegans and meat lovers in the crowd and everybody went crazy for it.  I followed the recipe pretty closely just changing for what was at home (2 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of black) and 2 minced jalapenos and a teaspoon of hot sauce.  Makes a HUGE pot of chili.  I did it in my enameled dutch oven as my slow cooker was busy with the "slow cooker italian beef for sandwiches" from this site (also very yummy)

I didn't make this recipe as shown, used it as a starting point to kind of wing it on my own. Allrecipes.com is a great way to break me out of "following" recipes!! I did use the spices as shown, except cut the chili powder and tabasco in half, as others did, and I'm glad for that!

This was a huge hit!  Even my picky husband loved it. Try it on nachos with cheese and jalapinos - delicious! I left out the tofu and added extra beans.    To save time and avoid onion-tears, I chopped all the veggies in the food processor.  It gave the chili a perfect consistency.

SOOOOOO Good!  I love the flavor and spice combo. I cut the recipe in half because I thought I was cooking for two. (after our two meat eaters tried it they ate big bowls full too!!!) Even though I cut the recipe down it filled my typical sized crockpot and was enough for four with leftovers too!!! I did make a few little changes but stayed pretty close to the recipe.  TRY THIS RECIPE ITS REALLLY GOOD!!!!

You will need a LARGE crock pot for this recipe as it is written.  A regular size crock will be too small.  The amount of onions & peppers was almost overwhelming for the skillet so it took quite a while for them to cook.  The overall taste (compared to chili with beef) is only slightly similar but I think the cumin was overpowering.  the texture was good.  The chips, guacamole and sour cream are a good addition so there is something accompanying the chili.  Overall in my opinion, this recipe was average.

This was the best Chili I have ever had!!! Although I am not a vegetarian I enjoyed the tofu addition very much! It is not for the faint of heart. I would probably cut the heat in half next time. Also next time and there will be a next I will add fresh frozen organic corn.

Best veggie chili recipe I've ever tried.Thank you for sharing this recipe. The only change I make is to pan fry the bite-size tofu chunks a bit before adding to pot. Every time I make this I am blown away by the flavor! SO GOOD!!

This is a crazy-good recipe.  Instead of tofu I use meat substitute.  I have snuck this by my meat-loving countryside Finnish in-laws and they gobbled it up.  Great indeed with guacamole, sour cream, cheddar and even some crushed flavorless corn chips for some crunch.  It makes a big pot and you can even set some aside to freeze in small tupperwares for chili dogs later on!

Great base recipe. I changed a lot, subbing the tofu for Morningstar farms fake ground beef. I also added orange and yellow bell peppers, jalapeños, carrots, potatoes, thawed frozen corn, cilantro, mushrooms, red and kidney beans and basically the kitchen sink. So many veggies I had to sauté them in a wok. I also added a bit more oil, garlic, tomato and spices to make up for the extra veggies. My slow cooker was very full. I kept adding spices to taste as it cooked, and it ended up pretty spicy which in my opinion, it's chili, it's supposed to be spicy! I think it's the best chili I've ever had. I garnished with shredded sharp cheddar, plain Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream, fresh cilantro, and tostitos scoops which were great for scooping it up like a dip. I froze the leftovers in mason jars so I'll have chili all winter now. Highly recommend anyone make this recipe and just adjust and add or take away things to suit your tastes. I'm not the best cook so I was pretty proud of myself for making such great chili. The fake meat was great too, so convincing my cat was begging me when I would stir it.

I used 3 onions instead of four and less chili pepper and hot sauce, based on the reviews and absolutely love it!  Next time, I'll use the 4th onion, though.  I thought it would be too oniony, but it's surprisingly not

Loved this chili, but true to my nature I did not follow the recipe strictly.  I used only 2 cans black beans, 1 can kidney beans, and 1 can chili beans.  I also used only 1 can diced tomatoes, and then 2x 10 ounce cans diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I also added a 4 ounce can of diced green chilies, and omitted the tofu.  It was absolutely delicious!!  Will make again!

I thought the dish was amazing; I would leave out the tofu next time as it distracted me from all of the other yummi ingredients.  The tofu tasted fine, just not my cup of tea.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Best chili I've ever tasted! I made it for a party and had to tell everyone it was vegetarian because it was so meaty you couldn't even tell there wasn't any meat in it! (I used the smart ground vegetable protein instead of tofu). Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried many vegetarian chili recipes over the years and most of them are just lacking.  I almost gave up, thinking that chili just needs meat - until this recipe.  Awesome!  I recommending halving though, unless you need alot.

Best chili I've ever had. Had to add a little more spice at the end, but I eyeballed the measurements in the first place, so it was probably my fault.

This recipe is really wonderful.  It will convert meat eaters to eating tofu! It is a real keeper.  We have been fighting over the leftovers.

This is hands-down the best veggie chili I have ever eaten! I didn't have hot-sauce  (the chili powder is plenty spicy though), and used veggie burger crumbles instead of the tofu. I also halved the recipe. For some reason mine looks more "soupy" than the picture - but still tastes delish! With the tortilla chips, guac, and sour cream suggestion, this recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! Very easy and as other users have said, you can add or subtract the chili powder/hot sauce to suit your taste. I fool my meat-eater husband every time with this recipe!

I cut the spice to about a quarter the amount in the recipe but it was still much too hot for me. A bit runny (easily fixed) but as a newbie to the chili world, it's not a bad recipe overall!

The only thing I changed was to use 12 oz. of veggie crumbles in place of the tofu.  I left out the hot pepper sauce.  This was good, but not great.  I thought the chili flavor was overwhelming, even for chili.  But, overall, it was a hearty dish that was just above okay to me.

After eating this I don't think I will ever eat chili with meat again. The tofu is true star in this dish - so easy and so delicious! I made a few changes/additions - added a can of kidney beans, butter beans and corn. Increased the crushed tomato to 28oz can and instead of hot sauce I used some adobe sauce for the heat. Please try this recipe you won't be dissappointed.

I made the recipe as is and it was great! A keeper! I've been looking for a good veggie chili recipe that isn't wimpy and finally found it. My meat eating husband also loved this. It makes a lot of chili so we were able to freeze over half of it. It tasted even better from frozen.

Say 4.5 stars. This is a good, hearty, VERY nutritious chili. I use a very firm tofu or a baked tofu in this. Adds to the "meatiness". You can also add whatever veggies are in the fridge to use them or substitute or whatever.

I wanted to love this because it's so healthy.  It's ok if you're a health freak like I am.  But it's not 'meaty' like the recipe says.  It is 'beany'. Not bad, I just expected more because of the reviews.

Great chili recipe!  Make sure to really press that tofu if you want a meaty texture. This tastes even better the next day as the tofu absorbs all the flavors. Will probably only use 1 jalapeno next time as it was quite spicy and I want to make it for the kids.

I used a lot less oil and a lot less chili powder. I also threw everything into the crockpot the night before and then put it on to cook the next morning. The four hours cook time was more than plenty. When it was done, I added a little more cumin to taste. I'll make it again, but agree with another user who said don't bother precooking the vegetables. Just put them in and let them cook with everything else - especially if you are going to leave the chili cooking for six hours.

We're not even vegetarians and I've still made this chili a few times, just because we like it so much. Due to the slower cooking process, and especially if you first press your tofu between 2 plates with a heavy object on top for an hour or more, the tofu is quite meat-like. Great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was good. I'd make it again. Thing is though, the reason I gave it only 4 stars is that there is no way this doesn't need some liquid. I added about a cup and a half of water at the end, upon discovering how not soupy at all it is. Not  even stewy. Or you could just add the liquid with the beans and not drain them, if you can digest it. That'd be just about right.

We really enjoyed this and the kick it has! As with any recipe you can tweak it to suit your taste. Before tossing in the veggies, I cubed the tofu (like one might chicken breast for chili)and fried it in the oil until browned. (Remember you are using olive oil and it has a lower smoke point than other oils) I omitted the green pepper and put another red pepper in it's place. I feel the flavor of green peppers is often overpowering. I used 2 parts New Mexico Chile Powder and 1 part Ancho Chile Powder. The other tweak I made was to double the hot pepper sauce. If using Tobasco brand, I would follow the recipe. We keep Crystal Pepper Sauce in the fridge and it does not have the same kick as Tobasco. After adding the tomatoes, beans and spices only cooked it for 1.5 hours to get the flavors to meld. When chopping up the large quantity of onions and peppers I was a bit concerned. It cooked down just fine. The small amount of tomatoes also concerned me, as I usually always have almost the same amount of tomato as beans. This chili does have a bit of a kick and got me to break a sweat. It's a good heat and not an uncomfortable burn your mouth off hot. It's very tasty and would make it again. I might even try the TVP crumbles that others tried.

I have made this recipe often since 2009, at first with tofu, more recently just with ground meat (a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground venison today.) I used to follow it exactly, now I use it as a guide.  Very good, very tasty.  Kudos to the inventor!!  I came looking for it in here today so I could print out a new copy, and thought that I would throw in a review lol...

Despite being a house full of carnivores, this might just be the best chili we have ever made. Only change I made (out of necessity) was I added 4 different types of beans because I didn't have 4 cans of black beans on hand.

Great recipe! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added some corn. My family doesn't like spicy foods, so I cut the amount of chili powder by 2/3 and added 2 tsp of smoked paprika. I'm making it for the second time in a month and am using "beef" crumbles instead of tofu, which I used last time.

Also, I find it tastes better next day, or even a week after.

I followed the recipe as written, but cut it in half as the original quantities make a huge batch.  It was delicious with just the right amount of spice without being too hot.  I will definitely make it again.

I go back to this recipe again and again. The only things I change are the chili powder to taste, and the bean mixture. Instead of 4 cans black beans, I do 2 cans black, 1 can red kidney, and 1 can corn. I also do only 2-3 peppers. If I want the tofu to have texture, I cook it separately, but I usually cook it all together with the pepper mixture and it turns out fine. As is, the recipe is 5 stars; I just made adjustments to suit my preferences.

I've made this a couple of times now and absolutely love it. Everyone who has shared it with us is amazed at how tasty and how much it doesn't seem like a vegetarian meal. Only comment I have is that the first step will never take ten minutes, if you do it right. There's way too much water in the onions, veggies, and tofu to be able soften onions, combine others, and then brown. Always takes me at least a half-hour to do it right. 

Great recipe!

Believe it or not, we won a chili cook-off with this recipe! I took someone else's suggestion and used the Morning Star Vegetable Crumbles because it looked like meat, which I'm sure had a lot to do with the win. :D

First try at vegetarian chili as several vege family members came for dinner.. and all meat eaters loved it as well.. even competed with seafood gumbo! We love spicey.. so added some more "kick"!
But any recipe that starts with 4 onions, garlic and tomato.. is a winner! Thanks!

Pretty good! I like the tofu - never would've thought to add to chili! Added a variety of beans as well as chick peas and corn but total number of "cans" was about the same.

I was quite pleased with how my chilli turned out.  I halved the recipe like other commenters; however, I still used the whole container of tofu.  I added the chilli to hot dogs and cheese (to make chilli cheese dogs).  I will definitely keep this recipe

I made this with veggie crumbles instead of tofu, and threw in some frozen corn for color. It was delicious!! I fed three guys, they all has seconds or thirds (one guy had fourths!) and no one knew it wasn't real beef! Will definitely make this again, delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!  I reduced the onion to one because I'm not a fan and increased the hot sauce by several tablespoons.  I don't like extremely spicy foods but I thought it needed a bit more flavor.

Next time I'd skip the tofu, add a jalapeno or 2, and swap white vinegar for apple cider vinegar. A good base recipe for sure!

We've made this so many times and each time it's great!  My daughter is vegan and eats it almost every day.  I've started making the beans from dry rather than the canned and it's turned out great each time I've done this.  I have never added the tofu and it's still delicious without it.  Pair it with some homemade tortillas and you have a great meal.

This was so easy and awesome amount of flavor!  I served it with Tortilla chips for dipping instead of spoon served. I also topped it with sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. Definitely a must keep!

I'm not even a vegetarian and I love this recipe. I've made it several times and it's been a hit every time. I use a variety of beans, including white, kidney and black. I also use a variety of peppers- green red and yellow. Finally, I substitute an entire package of Morningstar or Boca crumbles for the tofu. I made this for a crock pot lunch for the teachers at my kids' school, and it won the prize for the favorite entry!

This was pretty good! I do like tofu so it was not a stretch for me to try this one...I also added some zucchini that I froze from the summer to amp up the veg factor in the dish amd make it a bit more hearty...otherwise it was just pepperrs and onions. I thought the spices were pretty much right on and it was a very flavorful chili and if you dont eat tofu....you would never know by taste since tofu takes on whatever the flavors are. Good healthy chili and so easy since its a crockpot meal! I didnt sautee the peppers and onions first....jsut dumped everything in the crockpot. I also used dark red kidney beans instead of black. Thanks!

This was GREAT!  I was planning on making another tofu dish but realized I didn't have one crucial ingredient at the last moment.  Taking inventory of the things I DID have, plus a quick ingredient search, resulted in making this recipe.  So poor planning on my part led to a great discovery of this chili!  Since I hadn't planned on making it, I didn't have time for the slow cooker, but let it simmer for about an hour and it was great.  I used kidney and pinto beans (due to pantry contents) and orange pepper instead of red (due to fridge contents.)  I halved the recipe (just the hubs and me) and it was plenty for us and some leftovers.  I will be making this again!

I added 1/4 cup red wine at the beginning. Seemed to work.This Filled a 6 quart pot so half the ingredients in a smaller one. 

Put corn chips in a bowl, ladel this on top, shredded cheese on top of that, then have sour cream and guac on the side with it...yep this recipes a KEEPER thank you!

I have tried dozens of vegetarian chili and this is by far my favorite. I substitute 2 of the 4 cans of black beans with black beans in a cumin chili type sauce. I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes with (hot) green chilies instead of crushed tomatoes for extra zip. I also use one less onion and pepper and substitute the tofu with soy burger crumbles. Delicious! And plenty of leftover's.

This was a bust. I'm not sure why but it just wasn't anything like chili it was just a pot of beans. I did follow the recipe exactly. Not going to be on my veggie rotation.

I LOVED this chili.  Next time, well.  Next time, I probably won't make it because I'm the only one in my family who will eat such a bean-y dish.  But, I could have done without the tofu.  Best vegetarian chili I have ever had, though!  I was going to try and give away the leftovers since I'm the only one eating it.  But, I decided I'm just going to finish it off.  LOVE IT!

Have made several times.  Always a crowd pleaser!  I usually half the chili powder and add more hot sauce.  Otherwise, I find it can be a little too spicy for some.  Love it!

This is an excellent recipe - quick and simple to prepare, very delicious and filling, plus lots of leftovers for packed lunches. It is made at our house monthly. Here are a few changes made based on other reviewers' comments plus a couple of my own;
•Use 5 cans of beans instead of 4, and rather than using all black beans, use one can each of red kidney, white kidney, black, chickpea, and pinto beans.
•Add 4 tbsp of chili powder instead of 6 for starters. If you feel the finished product needs some more pop, add an extra 1/2tbsp at a time, stir well and let it meld in the crock pot for at least 15 minutes before tasting again. 6 tbsp is too much based on the palettes of my family members.
•Instead of using hot pepper sauce, use up to an entire 6oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, based on your heat tolerance. This adds a wonderful smoky element to the chili! Chipotle peppers have a "slow burn" which is perfect for this chili.
•Add 1/2 cup of sliced black olives, drained.
•Add 1 cup of frozen corn.
•Use 2-1/2 cups of TVP (textured vegetable protein) instead of tofu. This should be added in the final 30 minutes of cooking. 
•Don't add any water! You will find that the TVP needs more water than tofu will to get the consistency you are after. Add slowly until everything combines well and isn't dry. Usually about 1-1/2 cups. You can also use vegetable broth. 
•As others have said, this is best served with cheese, sour cream and chopped tomato, avocado and cilantro.

This was a great recipe but as a reviewer noted, she halved the recipe as you can end up with chili for an entire neighbourhood. Half of this recipe makes enough for a plenty large family and some leftovers to boot. Pretty meaty tasting for sure. Thank you for a nice recipe.

Made it exactly as recipe states. Drained my beans because of the reviews that said it was watery and made sure I fried up those veggies really well, but it was still watery. It was okay - don't get me wrong I'll freeze and take it in my lunch to work with noodles and lots of cheese, but I won't make this again.

I enjoyed this chili a lot. I also cut chili powder & pepper sauce by 1/2 & thought still ample spiceyness. I sauteed tofu separately as I didn't take time to let it drain sufficiently & wanted to be sure it got browned a little. This worked well.  I'm not vegetarian but would definitely make again.

First time making a tofu style chili and it turned out excellent. I made a few subs based on what I had on had. I used pearl onions, vine tomatoes that I gave a quick pulse, and a can of tomato sauce. I mixed black and kidney beans to get different textures. I needed to add a little more liquid so added a splash of red wine and about a half cup of water. For spices, I followed the recipe except I reduced the chili powder to two tablespoons. I cooked on the stove for about an hour and a half. Will definitely make again.

I changed the recipe, just a little.  I added a small can of vegetarian baked beans and added about a cup of left over sweet wine.  I prepared it for my daughter  and her wife and they  said it was very good.  I am going to add some ground beef to the left overs for us carnivores and know  we will love it.

Delicious! It’s a staple recipe in my otherwise omnivorous household. I make it exactly as written and take it to pot luck events, to great acclaim from vegetarians and others alike. Usually though for dinner at home, I substitute gr. beef for the tofu and kidney beans for the black beans, as they are more likely to be on hand. It’s spicy enough for the husband who loves his food SPICY, and I just add a ton of cheese and sour cream upon serving for me and the kidlet. It makes a TON. I would say the description of ‘feeds 8’ must mean 8 hungry lumberjacks....

We LOVE this chili!  I use three onions instead of four and I swap two of the cans of black beans for 2 kidney (one light, one dark red) but that's all I change. 

My best recommendation is to bake sweet potato tator tots and spoon some of this chili on top - AMAZING! You can also use fat free plain greek yogurt for sour cream as a topping.  SO GOOD :)

It looks like it won't all fit into your slow cooker, but it will.  I also use a slow cooker liner for a much easier clean up.

Vegan for about 2 years and this has remained my go-to chili recipe. It is SO good and filling, makes so much, and literally everyone I feed it to loves it. Meat-eaters and all.

Wonderful chili recipe for vegetarians who won't settle for bland chili! Tofu is completely optional - I've tried this recipe both ways and found it maybe made it more filling? Would recommend frying the tofu if you want it to have a more defining presence. The amount of onion seems a little much, but so worth it! I also added a lot of fresh garlic and used a variety of beans - black beans, great northern, and pinto!

Smash hit - completely devoured at potluck. I used the equivalent of 2 cups rehydrated TVP in lieu of tofu. Be sure to press excess moister out of the TVP after hydrating, or the tofu so you get full flavour absorption. I thought my slow cooker was big until I tried this recipe. I had to get the second one out and split it up between them. I used two cans black beans, one red kidney and one white kidney beans. Added additional colour and texture variations.  Do serve as suggested by our recipe provider, but include making fresh cilantro available.

Delish! I used veggie crumbles instead of tofu and added a can of corn. My non vegetarian adult son had no idea that he wasn't eating meat. My vegetarian daughter loved this. They both ate multiple bowls for days. I cut the recipe in half b/c it makes a ton of food and we still had lots of leftovers. I served it with a sprinkle of cheese on top and fresh cornbread. A hit with the entire family! They've demanded I make it again ASAP. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading others' reviews, I used a mix of black, kidney, and great northern beans, used rehydrated TVP instead of tofu, and cut the spice in half.  My spicy-loving husband said it was spicy enough, and my small children also tolerated it (I won't say they loved it).  I thought it was fantastic.  Great texture, great flavor,, very satisfying.  Easy enough slow-cooker meal for a weeknight.  I did the chopping and sauteeing the night before, then mixed everything together, put it in the fridge overnight, and started it in the morning before work.

Definitely a keeper. I omitted the hot sauce. I just felt it had plenty of spice given the other ingredients. I topped mine with sour cream and cheese.

This was great! I followed the directions almost exactly (the ony change was using Frank's instead of Tobasco sauce) and we were not disappointed! The whole family loved it and I will make it again, but I next time I would like to somehow incorporate a sweet and smoky flavour, and reduce the heat a little. Other than that, an excellent chili and I much prefer the tofu in it to ground beef! So, for us it was true - we really didn't miss the meat at all.

Made this for a dinner event and it turned out well!  I made some slight modifications - used 3 onions instead of 4, and subbed out one can of black beans for one can of kidney beans.  Also added one can of whole kernel corn.  To make it less spicy, I also did not add tabasco sauce and only added in a couple teaspoons of chili powder instead of the recommended 6 tablespoons.

I made this for work, and it was a hit!  It filled my big crock pot, and I barely had any left. Like others, I used protein crumbles instead of the tofu. I also did not add the vinegar or tabasco.  It was very flavorful and not too spicy. I would make it again.

I want to play with this recipe, a good one in a family of mixed vegetarian and non vegetarian eaters.  My husband did not like the look of the tofu, but acknowledged it did not change the flavor.  Maybe if tofu was fried separately at high temp it would look better.  Texture was same as meat chili.  I used 2 /3 (66%) off the chili powder this called for and it was too much chili powder.  I want to try with half the chili powder and substitute chipotle chili pepper for chili powder.  This is reasonable prep and slow cooker recipe I need in my busy life trying to become vegetarian.  A cheat is this is yummy with sour cream.

Left out the tofu.  3 cans black beans and 1 can white.  Threw in a can of white corn at the end.  Like many reviews...chili powder was a bit strong but we didnt mind it.  Had to add water because it was just too thick.  Will make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe as a family.  I have two boys (9 and 11) and they gobbled it up!  I've made several different recipes for chili and I think I've found my keeper.  I loved the combination of flavors.  The changes I made: TVP instead of tofu, a bit less chopped onion, used a variety of beans per others' reviews, because I didn't want my chili too spicy I cut back on the chili powder (about 2 TBSP is enough for us),  and I didn't add the hot sauce.  My husband who loves spicy hot food didn't feel the need to add more spice to it so the flavor was plentiful and the mild burn was sufficient even for him.  I ended up putting all of the spices together in a bowl and combining them with the vinegar and then adding it in.  I don't know that it made much difference but we LOVED the flavors and the textures!

We split the recipe and added cooked ground beef to half of it. Both meatless and with meat were delicious!  Only changes we made: using 6C of cooked black beans instead of cans, half red onion/half yellow, simmered on the stovetop for approx. 2 hours; very well enjoyed by all.

I don't like cooking but this was worth it :-)  Delicious.  Used extra firm tofu which worked great.  Definitely will make this again and again.

Yum Yum.   Surprised to loved the tofu.  I cut the amount of oil to a minimum (approx 2T) to reduce calories.  To give the chili additional depth I added 1T chocolate and 2t cinnamon and cut the tobasco.  Thumbs up from both my vegetarian teen AND my carnivore teen.

A good base chili recipe, although I made several tweaks based on reviews from others.  Added a jalepeno pepper, 1.5 times the garlic, and a box of portobello mushrooms.  I did not find the result to be very spicy, and would amp up the seasonings next time.

This gets 4.5 stars.  I use both black and kidney beans for some variety.  I also reduce the amount of chili powder a little bit, and substitute TVP for the tofu.  You'd never know it wasn't ground beef.

Amazing chili - made it the first time with Tofu; made it again with Ground Turkey. Delicious both times! Also added mushrooms, two carrots and a stick of celery to the veggies.

Do not cook peppers, onions, etc. in oil first.  Just put all ingredients in crock pot at the same time.  Either double the amount of tomatoes or add one can of tomato sauce (8 oz. for half the recipe).  Use less chili powder at first.  Adjust to taste.  Use soy crumbles instead of tofu.  Total calories for entire pot, recipe halved is 1702.  Makes 5 servings of 2 red ladles.

Super yummy chili!  Great for both meat eaters and vegetarians alike.  I made the recipe as is other than adding some corn.  Will definitely make again.

This is great chili.  Tended to be overly-spicy for some, but I liked it. If you feel the chili powder, onion or pepper quantities are over the top, feel free to cut back. Still tastes great.

Definitely a keeper.  The recipe is flavorful.  Some changes I made were: 
1) Used refried beans instead of black beans.
2) Included frozen corn
3) Used frozen chopped bell peppers instead of fresh
4) Used TVP instead of tofu.  I will try seitan next time.
5) Added a bit of water (maybe a half cup or so) because of the TVP substitution

It was a tad too salty than what I'm use to.  (I used kosher salt) Next time I'll probably reduce the salt to half or just skip it.

In any case, the original recipe yields more like 16 servings, not 8.  It's A LOT of food.  Especially for those of you out there on a diet, 1 serving of chili is about 1 cup (6oz to 10oz depending on your size).  Eat it with a small piece of low-fat corn bread and you're good to go :)

Anything with tofu that is consistently and ravenously consumed by my Southern-raised husband AND my 5 and 7 year old boys gets 5 stars. I have made this several times now and each time, I think there might be some leftover to freeze, but that has not yet happened. Anything leftover is eaten the very next day and then it's gone.

I don't precook anything in a separate pan, just add onion, peppers, etc to crockpot with warmed oil in it, let it go for 15 or 20 minutes before adding other ingredients. I also don't add as much hot sauce since my boys like a little bit of spice, but not a lot.

Seriously, this is really, really good. And I use sprouted tofu (from Trader Joe's) so I feel even better about the healthfulness of this dish. 

Making another batch today- perfect since it's snowing outside.

This is my "go to" recipe whenever I make my chili. I made adjustments according to my mood and ingredients on hand. Usually i use diced tomatoes  and use another type of bean instead of all black bean. I have even out corn in. Yummy. I made this for a chili party and it was a success!

Just delicious, and very thick, two things I much appreciate as a vegetarian. I always skip the added salt, use low-sodium black beans, and add a chopped jalapeno to spice it up even more. I also use tofu crumbles instead of having to cut up the tofu cake.

This was so good!
I used TVP instead of tofu and diced tomatoes with chilis instead of crushed since its what I had in the pantry.  
Served over fresh corn and quinoa it was SO good!
