Very good! I was looking for a change from my normal bagged frozen fruit smoothie. So I used a can of maderine oranges some plain yogurt and some orange juice. I also used 2 teaspoons of vanillia in hopes that it would taste like a dreamcicle. Its pretty close! Great idea!

Good little drink. Vanilla yogurt was the most prominent taste, so I think I'll try plain if I make this again.
