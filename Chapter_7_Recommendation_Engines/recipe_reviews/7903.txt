Let's face it.. the cake itself is not what we're reviewing here.. it's mainly the cake icing. It's so light, delicious and addicting, and can go well with basically any cake. I recommend chilling the icing for a couple of hours before spreading it so that it will stay on the cake easier. I garnished my cake with grated coconut to complement the pineapple. It was great! I will definitely be making again! (Just to let you know, this recipe makes a TON of icing.. the leftovers make a wonderful fruit dip!)

a refreshing cake indeed! the natural sweetness of the pineapple and mandarins is a great change from normal sugar frostings. i liked the bits of pineapple and mandarin oranges in the frosting.
to cut the cake in half horizontally, stick toothpicks halfway up the sides of the cake, then use unflavoured dental floss to wrap around the cake with the toothpicks as a guide, cross the floss and pull the two ends away from each other, the floss will cut the cake cleanly into two layers.

Hi, I am so pleased with this recipe, I have made it five or six times. I suggest you drain the juice from both cans of fruit. Then you can add liquid as you need it. I used a boxed butter cake in a bundt cake pan. I mixed together some sugar and cinnamon, poured in half of my already mixed (accordingto package) cake mix, sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon mix over that, then added the rest of the cake mix. Bake according to directions. You will find there will be plenty of icing left over when using the bundt cake pan. I fill up the center of the cake with it. Anything left over, I eat. This is the best cake I've ever had in my life! Thank you, Glenda. Katherine D (katydid) June 12, 2009 I made this cake again for a church picnic. This time I used the Kentuckey Butter Cake found on this site. However, I think I took too much juice from the crushed pineapple. I made the cake the day before and refrigerated it. This always makes it better, but this time the cake was not as moist and good as on previous occasions when I used a box cake. I'm not blaming the cake, though. I think I will take the advise of other reviewers and refrigerate the icing before putting on the cake. I will let you know how that goes. It's still the best cake in the world. I also prefer the four layers rather than the bundt cake pan. Who wants this wonderful icing on a so-so cake?

This cake is indescribably good. The topping reminds me of ambrosia fruit salad and I could eat it with a spoon! Ambrosia usually has coconut in it and I can imagine coconut would be good on this cake. I used "real vanilla" white cake mix and cheesecake pudding mix instead of plain vanilla. The topping was just a little soupy and I had trouble getting it to stay on the sides of the cake (it was fine on the top and between the layers). I think if I had prepared the frosting through the step where the pudding is mixed in and chilled it till it set up a bit before folding in the whipped topping it would have worked out better. Refrigerate the assembled cake overnight for best results.

I love this cake! I drain the pineapple and mandarin oranges thoroughly and use the juice instead of water in the cake. It gives the cake a bit more flavor. I also chill the frosting before frosting the cake. I also make cupcakes using the same recipe so everyone gets their own individual cake. I'm a baker in my spare time and this is my most requested recipe. It's very light and refreshing.

This is delicious.  I made a few changes. 1.  added grated orange peel to cake mix 2.  instead of just water I put in about 1/2 c or orange juice in cake mix  3.  I drained some of the liquid from crushed pineapple--this made for a stiffer frosting.  This is yummmmmmmmy

This is a wonderful cake recipe.  Delicious, without being overly sweet.  Also, the cake is visually stunning after it's frosted--tall, fluffy, and with a pretty orange tint.  It looks like it was a lot of work but it's a very easy recipe!  Thanks!

Delicious!  I served this cake for my daughter's first birthday...everyone loved it!  I added a package of vanilla pudding to the cake mix - for a bit denser cake.  For the frosting, I drained the oranges, then smushed them with the back of a fork and drained them again.  I was worried that the frosting wouldn't be thick enough to stay on the cake, but it did just fine!  Will definitely make this cake again - very springy, light and yummy!

I have made this cake twice now and I believe I have solved the problem of runny frosting. Use a can of pineapple chunks, drain and reserve the liquid. Then puree the pineapple and mandarin oranges in a blender and make the rest of the frosting as directed. It is smooth, delicious, light, and just the right consistency for spreading. Use the reserved pineapple liquid instead of water when mixing the cake. It makes it more flavorful. Yummy cake. Will make this again and again.

I have been making a version of this cake for years, however, in mine you do not follow the cake mix directions.   You substitute mashed banana for oil, and pineapple juice (reserved from the crushed pineapple) for the water.  This really makes the cake! You also add sliced bananas between the layers.  Try it!

This was a very delicious, very well-received cake. I made mine into a 9x13 sheet cake, and used the entire amount of the "frosting" spread right over it. I did drain my pineapple and I think if I hadn't it might not have thickened up very nicely, but with it drained it really did thicken up just like pudding. (This recipe, cake plus total frosting, just barely fits into a 9x13 cake dish and allows room to cover with Saran wrap. JUST barely -- the Saran wrap was touching my oranges that I had on top as a garnish.) Thanks for the recipe!

Lovely! Made it for hubby's birthday, who said he wanted something light and fruity and not too sweet. After the first bite, he said "this is excatly what I wanted."  I didn't at all get the "cake box" taste in this cake. I used a mixture of orange and pinapple juice (from the cans) in cake instead of water, and used the leftover juice to brush the layers. Wonderful cake. Frosting is to die for.

Absolutely excellent!  I have used this recipe several times at my summer bbq's and it's a HUGE hit.  The only thing that I do differently is toast coconut up in the oven and sprinkle on top edge.  I also place the mandarin oranges to look like flowers and place a maracchino cherry in the center.  It really makes the cake look beautiful.  You really can't loose making this cake!  Enjoy!!!

OH MY! This is one delicious monster! Mine turned out huge! Loved it. It is all about the filling. I didn't even bother trying to frost the sides. Looked pretty, showing off the layers, all 8 of them (4 cake, 4 frosting, by the time the layers were completed)! I did add some coconut into the filling, then sprinkled some on top along with decorating with the mandarin oranges. Fan-tab-monster-lious!

I made this cake for tomorrow's company, but temtation gave in and hubby and I had to sample it tonight! This cake is outstanding! And it is aptly named! I made some healthy changes, albeit minor ones. I used 1/2 C. Splenda instead of XXX sugar; 1 C. applesauce in place of 1/3 C. oil; and cheesecake flavored pudding. I added a packet of unsweetened orange Kool-Aid to the icing. I always like the fillings in my cakes to be a bit different than the outer frosting. So I took 1/3 of the frosting and added 1/2 C. shredded coconut and 1/2 C. chopped maraschino cherries. I used this for the filling between layers, and it gave the middle of the cake a bit richer color. The Kool-Aid adds a nice tangy punch. Also, I pressed the juice from the pineapple through a colander, and discarded the juice. It wasn't needed at all. I chilled the frosting while baking the cake. We cut the cake straight from the fridge, and it was delicious. Very light and refreshing cake without the sugary sweetness of a traditional frosting. The cake itself is extremely moist. Sixteen ounces of whipped topping was too much, but 10 ounces was perfect (about a tub and a half.). Thank you Glenda for this great recipe! I will be making every summer! I put a picture of it in my profile.

I wish I would have read the reviews before making this cake.  The frosting was a little soupy so had trouble on the sides of cake.  Topping and layers were fine, as another user also stated.  I would suggest doing what other users suggested by either placing the frosting in the fridge first, or setting aside the pineapple juice to use as needed.  Also, I didn't cut the cake, and just used two rounds with the frosting in between the two cakes to save some time.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! This has become the only cake I make for special occasions.  One word of caution: Don't tinker with the frosting ingredients or your cake won't be as good.  A diamond of a cake.

I agree that it reminds me of an ambrosia type desert.  Therefore, I sprinkle a bit of browned coconut to the outside icing which adds a bit more tropical flavor and makes the cake look finished.

The first time I made this I used an orange cake mix and put some orange rind in.  I liked it but others thought a white mix would be better.  .  The second time I used a white cake mix.  The icing was a little loose even with draining the fruit so the second time I also added another 4 oz. of cream cheese and a small package of coconut.  I made two 9 inch pans and split the layers.  I then took a hint from the Coconut Poke Cake on here and poked small holes in each layer as I assembled and poured coconut CREAM over each before icing.  Wow!  The eight in the dinner party ate most of the cake!  Will make many more times!

WOW!  Wonderful, couldn't even wait for it to be chilled overnight and it was still great!  Made according to recipe except that I did drain most of the pineapple juice and used in the cake instead of all water.  I made in a 9x13 pan and it all fit except the icing did touch my lid but there is so much icing it won't matter.  Plus the icing is so fluffy that it really didn't hurt the look of the cake either.  I did end up adding about 3/4 cup of coconut to the icing.  Thanks this will be a great cake to make during the hot summer months!!

My mother has a recipe very similar to this that she has been making for years and I was so excited to find this one! I changed two things: I used pineapple cake mix and added chopped walnuts as part of the topping. I've made this cake several times and every time it is a HIT! Thanks for sharing!

I was trying to find a cake that my boyfriend loves that's like the "Millionaire Pie" served at Furr's Cafeteria  (a restaurant in the southern U.S. states). It's not quite the same, but the icing is almost right on.   I used french vanilla cake mix and instead of adding all the water I added some of the mandarin orange syrup - I'm not sure if that made a difference or not. I slowly added the confectioner's sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet; I probably  used 1 1/4 c instead of 1 1/2c. Also, I heeded other users' advice and didn't add the pineapple juice. This icing is also great as a fruit dip!

I made this into a trifle because it was easier for me to do and my kids could help.  I had a pile of navel oranges to use up, so I used them (sweetened with Splenda) instead of mandarin oranges.  I drained the pineapple and blended the fruit in the food processor before adding it to the pudding layer.  This recipe is delicious any way you style it.  Light, citrusy and creamy with every bite!

A truly beautiful and delicious cake!! Mine turned out looking just like the picture! I made the icing first and let it sit in the refridgerator while I made and baked the cake, only taking it out at right when I was ready to use it. This made the whole process easy and it stayed on the cake perfectly. This is definitely one of those that tastes better after getting thoroughly chilled in the refridgerator (2-3 days) though. I can imagine it would be good with coconut in the icing, cake, or even both and with orange flavored cake too.

HUGE compliments on this cake.  Changed only slightly.  I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar and found that was plenty.  I used the juice from the pineapple, but not the oranges.  I also found that the mixer was enough to break up the oranges, when I used high speed.  Oh, and I sprinkled coconut over the top and around the sides.  It made a nice presentation.

I think that this could be made lighter by: using Cool Whip Light, Fat-free Sugar-free pudding mix, and light cream cheese.  

I chose this cake for our potluck because I also made the Cavity Maker Chocolate Cake from this site, which is very dark and heavy.  It was a great complement, and many people had a little of both.

this was very good!  I listened to the previous people who rated this recipe.  I held back the juice and added it to the frosting as I saw fit.  Since it was a rainy day, that turned out to be a wise decision.
We used cheesecake pudding and it added a little more oommph.  Everyone that tried it wondered why I didn't put coconut on it. 
Maybe next time.  This recipe is a keeper.
Thanks!

I made this for a co-worker's birthday and it was gone in no time. I did substitute 1/4 of the water in the cake mix with coconut rum and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the rum. Very Yummy!

I've made it in couple of occasions and its wonderful~!
Very refreshing.  Though I've found original frosting too soupy and it doesn't quite stay on the cake.  I've took out 1/3 of the pineapple juice instead of pouring it all in.  Also the cream is more than enough for even 3 cakes!!!  thank you for the great recipe!

I made this as one of 2 desserts for Easter.  Used 3 eight-inch square foil pans (to make 3 short layers, and no cutting layers involved).  Used French vanilla pudding and French Vanilla Cool Whip.  Followed others advice.  Made on Friday, let it sit uncovered in frige (icing protects it), and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  Thanks, Glenda!

I'm sorry I didn't read more reviews before attempting this cake.  The frosting/filling was way too loose and didn't set up well.  I should have drained all the liquid from the canned pineapple and maybe have used a larger size box of instant pudding or another block of cream cheese to make it more manageable.  The cake was really a mess but tasted quite good.  I will try this again using the aforementioned changes.

I'm a guy and like to cook/try out new recipes. I have made this cake 3 times now, with no changes. 

 It was a big hit the time I took it to a potluck and the comments were,"you made this, really?"

As others have suggested, dental floss works great to divide the rounds, along with toothpicks as a guide.

Kids loved this too. I mixed frozen coconut to some of the icing and added to a small portion and it was dramatically improved! Very tropical and light. I will add coconut to the entire cake next time! Great cake for a summer block party

I made this cake exactly except left out the oranges. It was pretty good. The icing wasn't quite as thick as I would have liked it to be. Putting the cake in the fridge helped that though. The icing is great if you are a pineapple fan. I made this as a birtday cake. Two people didn't eat, but everyone else completly finished it. I liked it. I didn't think it was super great, but definately good. It would be great for a summer event. If you like pineapple I'm sure you will like this.

I didn't have vanilla pudding so I used coconut cream instead.  It was the best substitute!  Gave the cake an overall tropical flavor and I think I'll make it that way every time!  I also followed other reviewers and drained juices from both fruits, adding them later to adjust consistency.  It seems VERY runny at first, but after adding pudding and whipped topping and letting it chill a few minutes it was perfect!

I frequently bring in cakes for my co-workers, and I have never seen one disappear so fast!!!  This even got rave reviews from one person who doesn't like cake!!!  I followed the recipe, but did drain the pineapple first and kept the juice in a bowl in the event I needed it.  The frosting didn't seem to need any more liquid so I did not incorporate it.  I also added a box of vanilla pudding to the cake mix, since I do that with all cake mixes anyway.  I think next time I'll try it with an orange supreme cake mix.

This is a moist, scrumptious cake! After reading reviews, I drained the pineapple as well as the oranges to keep the icing from being to wet and sliding off the cake. It was perfect! The only complaint I have is that the icing it a bit too sweet (and I like sweet stuff!). Other than that, a unique and delicious recipe!

Great cake, didn't change a thing. I would suggest however, letting the frosting chill for about an hour or so before trying to frost the cake so that it doesn't run down the sides of the cake.

This recipe is great nice and light. To cut the amount of sugar in this recipe I didn't put the powder sugar in the icing and added some vanilla there is plenty of sugar in the pineapple juice. We also decided to make our own cool whip with heavy whipping cream in order to avoid buying the over processed cool whip they sell in the stores.

This cake was wonderful!  I made it for a friend's birthday.  It was a HIT!!! I baked in 3- 9 inch pans.  I reccommend draining the fruit and reserve it to add to frosting as needed.  I also used the juice to brush on the cake layers as I assembled it.  Really fabulous.  It remind me of ambrosia also.

Light and delicious. The only change I made was completely draining the pineapples before adding them, then gradually adding the juice later. 
I used the recipe in a 3 tier birthday cake, using the pineapple/mandarin mix as a filling and fondant over the entire cake. Since it isn't very sweet, it almost neutralizes the fondant.

I didn't have any yellow cake mix on hand, so I used white instead. I thought the 4 eggs and cup of oil was too much, so I ignored that and went with the back of the cake box.  But instead of putting water in it, I put the oranges and added water until it was "cake batter" consistency. I agree with others that you can't even tell the cake has the oranges in it.  Also, use a 9x13 pan like it tells you, because if you use 2 circle pans, the top layer tends to just fall off the cool whip icing. Although, I think I would make this again because it tasted really good in the end.

I'm giving it 2 stars because I was told the cake was good, although it didn't all go.  I know it got great reviews and maybe it was just my taste, but I really didn't care for the icing.  I couldn't get passed the texture of the crushed pineapple and mandarin oranges.  I also think I don't like cool whip in my icings.  Sorry, but this just wasn't for my taste.

THIS WAS SO AWESOME! I have a saying "if it's not chocolate it's not worth it." This was so good and light, I am all about chocolate and not so much on fruit.  This had me hooked i'll make it again and again.

I just made this cake and the frosting is so delicious!!  I can't wait to take it to my family party later today.  I know they will love it.  I did drain the pineapple as recommended and I used light cool whip.  The consistency and taste were perfect!!

Update - since originally making this recipe, I cannot go to a party without bringing it.  Everyone is crazy about this cake, even those who do not normally like cake.  It is light and refreshing!

I think I must have done something wrong although I followed the recipe exactly.  The final product was not appealing in appearance.  It did however improve in taste after a day or two in the fridge.

I made this cake for a co-worker and it is requested every time we celebrate another birthday.  Everyone just loved this cake, very flavorful without all the sugar normal icing has.  Extra topping left over can be used for cupcakes on the side.  Love this recipe.

Really good.  Made for a potluck, and it was a hit!  I used Duncan Hines orange cake mix for the base, as another reviewer suggested, drained the fruits and used the juice instead of water,frosted only the 4 layers and not the sides.  Yummy and impressive looking.  A definite keeper.

Delicious.... nearly impossible to eat just one slice.  It is light and so easy to enjoy, even after a big meal.  I drained the pineapple and mandarins completely as others have suggested.  Good advice.  Topping was a nice fluffy consistency.  Yum!

I make a similar cake for a long time. You just need to know the basics and play with it. Like using white cake mix and only egg whites for a lower calorie and lighter cake. Or using different pudding mix such as chocolate, lemon or even Pistachio pudding mix. Use sugar free mix for lower calorie version. Instead of pineapples, use fresh fruit chopped very finely such as strawberries or blueberries.  Make sure there is enough fruit and fruit juice equaling the 2 cans of pineapples’. Our favorite is White cake with egg white, sugar free cheese cake pudding mix, crushed Pineapple(can)  and coconut flakes just for decorating. It’s a very light cake and somehow guilt free.

I've been making a similar cake to this for many years. I don't use the cream cheese or powered sugar. For the oil in the cake mix, I use unsweeted applesauce and only eggwhites. This cuts down on the calories and fat content. For the icing, I use pineapples canneed in their on 2 cans of pineapples in their on juice but drain one of the cans and a a large box of sugar-free pudding. I do chill it for several hours. I split the cake layer and only use use the filling between the layers. Allowing the cake to chill over night lets the favors to absorb and makes for a wonderful cake. Many of my diabetic clients can eat this cake. I have never had anyone to complain about the "light" version. PS: I don't normally use the oranges but that's my preferences.

Yummy!  I really enjoyed this cake and it was easy to make.  My husband didn't like the mandarin oranges in the frosting.  I, on the other hand, LOVED them in it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Don't you just hate when someone changes your recipe, but in an effort to cook/bake more lowfat/sugar free this year, here are the changes I made.  Baked the yellow cake mix as called for including the butter.  (Could have used applesauce instead of butter to really make this low calorie.) For the topping, used lowfat cream cheese, DID NOT add confectioners sugar, added the crushed pineapple with juice, added package lowfat, sugar free vanilla pudding mix and a container of lowfat frozen whipped topping.  Baked in a 9 x 13 inch pan.  The cake was very good and moist and, surprisingly, my picky husband did not even notice these changes!  This cake has lots of wonderful flavors with the oranges and pineapple.   I will make this again!

Yummy!  My family couldn't let it sit in the fridge overnight--a couple of hours was all it took.  This recipe is a summer favorite and a keeper!

Delicious! I sent this to work with DH and it got rave reviews. I followed some other suggestions and drained the pineapple. I used the juice in place of the water in the cake mix. The frosting seemed a little thin at first, but it thickened well after a few minutes in the frig.

I had huge hopes for this based on the reviews, but it just wasn't that great. Cake mix+pudding mix+cool whip=very processed taste. It was good and we ate it all, but it wasn't a "wow." The fruit combo plus cream cheese was excellent--maybe real whipped cream would make it wow, although it wouldn't keep as well.

Thak you, thank you Glenda for the post.  I made very few changes, as I think it was nearly perfect on it's own.  I used a butter cake mix instead of standard yellow (made with half butter & half applesauce), used fat & sugar free cheesecake pudding mix in the icing, reduced fat cream cheese and drained but reserved juices from the crushed pineapple to add back as needed.  I topped it with chopped pecans and would decorate with coconut in the future too.  My picky DH said it was "really good" and barely scraped any of the icing off.  Guests couldn't get enough!  I'll make this OFTEN!

This recipe was fabulous!  I did not add the cool whip to the cream cheese mixture until the very end.  I used the cream cheese mixture as the filling and reserved about 1/2 or 2/3 cup of the filling and added the cool whip to that for the outside of the cake.  There was more "fluffy" stuff to make the outside really pretty and it made the inside really rich and decadent.  I also toasted some coconut flakes and sprinkled them on top.

To DIE for!!!  To make this an easy fix I made a regular cake, let it cool then put med chunks in bottom of cake pan and a layer of topping then another layer of cake and another layer of topping.  Easier than layers, and easier to serve.  I also tried it with coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla!  Fabulous!

This cake is absolutely heavenly! I hope heaven is as good as this cake! The only aleration I made was instead of using the water called for on the cake box, I used the pineapple juice drained from the can of pineapple. It was wonderful! It was even better on the 2nd and 3rd day. Keeping it in the fridge and waiting a day or so to eat helps all the flavors come out and really meld. Excellent recipe. I highly recommend.

I decided to make this for my boyfriend's birthday since he is not a fan of sweets and this cake hit the spot. He declared it the best cake in the world. I followed the recipe exactly except for the frosting, which I blended in a food processor to smooth out the chunks. Wonderful cake as is and I think I'll play around with it to get different variations.

The frosting on this cake is to die for.  I used 3 oz more cream cheese for the flavor.  Put this icing in the fridge for a couple of hours at least and spread generously; there's plenty. =)  I put it on orange cake the first time and coconut breading for my best friend's birthday, garnished with shredded coconut naturally.

EASY AND EXCELLENT! I made this for a co-workers birthday. There is usually leftover cake, but not on this occasion! This cake was really light and delicious. May try to add shreaded coconut to the frosting next time. A definite keeper!

I absolutley loved this cake but had to give it four stars because my guests had mixed opinions. I made it for my daughters 2nd birthday and loved how the cake was light and not too sweet. I went with some of the others reviews and used only 1 cup of the powderd sugar and made it the night before. I will make it again, this time for a different crowd.

I treated this recipe more like a concept....lots of substitutions, and it still worked out wonderfully!  I didn't need a big fancy cake, so I baked the cake in two 8x8 pans - one for now, one for the freezer.  I used a coconut cake mix, and the 'low fat preparation'.  For the 'frosting' I used fatfree cream cheese, the cup and a half of powdered sugar, then sugar free vanilla pudding mix, the crushed pineapple, just one can of drained mandarin oranges, and fat free cool whip.  Even though I had reduced the 1 can of mandarin oranges, I still had plenty of topping, and the cake is really tasty, even with all the reduced fat and reduced sugar options I used.  Thanks for this really lovely flavor combination!

Yum.  After reading the reviews, I expected the frosting to be runny....It definitely wasn't...i wonder if those reviewers weren't using the right size box of pudding?  Either way, this was delicious and was a hit for my husband's birtday.

I used French Vanilla cake mix and french vanilla instant pudding mix as suggested by another reviewer.  It was a huge success.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

This cake was good, but not fantastic.  Basically just a box cake mix with cream cheese & fruit frosting.  Nothing special.  A good easy cake for maybe a child's party.

I tried this recipe when searching for a special cake for my one yoear old daughters' birthday . I heard nothing but rave reviews from everyone ! The only change I would suggest is to use a white cake mix instead of yellow - it's lighter , and seems to match the filling better in texure.If you want a sure fire winner that people will be talking about for days use this one ! THANK YOU GLENDA!!!

I turned this into a trifle. I don't trust myself with layered cakes. I failed once and said never again. 

the frosting/filling was too watery/juicy from the crushed pineapple. I added another box pudding to thicken up some. but of course adding the whip cream/cool whip loosed it up some. 
my box cake was super moist. I added some of the reserved mandarin juice to one layer of cake similar to poke cake but made it mushy. to my box cake mix added hint of vanilla for additional flavor.

I had enough cake & filling for another small trifle with this one added walnuts.

I made this for my mom's birthday. She absolutely LOVED it! My aunt tried it and loved it, too 
I love scratch made food but the boxed butter cake mix is impossible to replicate at home. It's so moist, tender and delicious. 
My frosting has a slightly more yellowish color from the vanilla pudding mix.  It certainly doesn't mess up the flavor.
I'll be making this again.
(I tried adding the picture but for some reason, it won't add it.)

If the icing is too sweet for some of you, use sugarless vanilla pudding mix.  That's what I did the second time around.

Well, the whole thing was delicious with some adjustments. I understand that some use a cake mix to save time, but really, it does not take much to follow a good cake recipe out of a recipe book, and the whipped topping is just icky. Buy fresh whip cream in a can and shake it up instead.

I have made this cake several times. The only thing I change is I use heavy whipping cream and whip it myself. It comes out great every time. Everyone enjoys it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake as a birthday cake.  I read the reviews prior to making it and they were very helpful.

Drain the crushed pineapple...should give you 1 cup of juice.  Use this juice instead of 1 cup of water for cake mix.

I made just the 2 layer cake...spliting the cakes into makes it too hard.  It does fine with 2-8" or 9" cake pans.

Be sure and make the icing 1st and put it in the refrigerator while you are baking the cake.

I added  a cup of pecans to mine....was the only change I made....except for the juice, you do not need any for the icing at all.  You can use any flavor of instant pudding.

Very good and makes a beautiful cake.

My grandmother requests for me to make this cake for her every holiday. The only change I made was to crush the mandarin oranges & drain the juice off of them again in a paper towel. It made the icing more even over the cake. First time I made it I left them whole & the icing was not as appealing. I did leave the additional (reserved) oranges whole for decorating. ***HELPFUL TIP*** try making the frosting ahead of time & chilling it a few hours or overnight before icing your cake. Place a piece of Saran Wrap touching the top so it doesn’t get a skin.

This cake was a delicious hit! I followed the advice of another viewer and, for the frosting, drained both the the oranges and pineapples, reserving the juice to add as needed. Turned out I needed none of it. I refrigerated the frosting before icing the cake and it spread nicely. Instead of halving each 9-inch cake, I simply frosted the top of one and sat the other on top. I had no frosting left over but had enough. I refrigerated the cake overnight and the results were amazing. Loved by all! I just had to post another review for this awesome cake but mostly because I found to my horror, out of cool whip!! I did have a container of heavy cream about 3/4 full and whipped that up until it was nice a fluffy. I then added 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar at a time, totaling a 1/4 cup. I folded this into the frosting and, while the frosting is a little thin (Note, I used none of the juice from the pineapple or mandarin oranges) refrigerating,  I adding a good handful of shredded coconut and refrigerated the frosting while my cakes cooled completely. Great results with another fabulous tasting cake. I thought it would be helpful to know that whipped heavy cream works just as well as cool whip should you, like me, find yourself without it.

Love, love, love this refreshing cake. I am not a baker but even I can make this delicious treat.  The only change I made was to use whipping cream instead of whipped topping. (Not a product I use). Best summertime cake ever!

What a great recipe! I used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and added a can of drained chopped up mandarin oranges, I think it made the cake moister.
I did what others suggested, draining the cans of pineapple and orange and adding liquid as needed. 
I made the cake for my moms birthday she loved it. My father, who isn't a cake eater generally had two slices and said he loved it because it wasn't overly sweet.

I used all the pineapple juice and the frosting was soupy!!  With 1/2 the juice, it is the best icing EVER. Best if you drain it all and then add it as you go until you get the best texture. Once you fix this, you are good!

Great cake! It's not near as dense and rich as most cakes which is what usually turns me off to them anyway. I did add chopped pecans to the icing which makes a nice addition. Love it-Thanks for the recipe!

Very good but my icing was runny even after leaving it in refrigerator to set up... Probably will drain pineapple next time... flavor was still delish though!

When I was doing Weight Watchers this was a recipe given to us by our leader. It was delicious, and guilt free. We used fat free pudding, and whipped topping. I also don't recall the use of cream cheese. All in all, it was a nice dessert for those of us watching our caloric intake.

Made this cake today, leaving in the frig overnite so haven't tasted yet but looks beautiful and icing tasted yummy. A word of warning: I broke one of my glass pyrex 8" cake pans (which I love) and cannot find them anymore. I bought 2 metal non stick (not!) in 9". First, 8" layers would be easier to split, will definitely do that next time. Also, I would use parchment paper to be sure I don't have the sticking problem. Huge thanks to reviewer emmcelle for the tip about the dental floss, works like a charm.

I took this cake to a fund raiser (cake walk) for our Square Dance Club.  It was a hit.  I didn't drain the pineapple, as others suggested, thinking maybe the problem with the frosting being too thin was due to over beating the cream cheese.  Careful as I was, mine still turned out too thin.  I chilled it 2 hours, still too thin, so I added some coconut.  It was still thin.  At this point I'm thinking that I have to start over with the frosting.  After analyzing the situation, I discovered that I had used "cook & serve" pudding mix!  Having nothing to loose, I whipped in a small box of "sugar free, fat free" instant pudding mix, let it set for 5 min.  Perfect!  Amazingly, the additional pudding mix didn't alter the taste.  I give the cake 5 stars because the problem with the frosting was my own.

I made this icing to go with the Orange Sunshine Cake on this site. SO DELICIOUS! I'm already envisioning the leftover frosting on pound cake, angel food cake, or just vanilla wafers. So, so, so yummy!

A crowd favorite every time! This easy and delicious cake is the perfect compliment to any light summertime meal - yet is a favorite for the holidays as well. One variation my "taste-testers" love is a layer of thinly sliced strawberries before adding the filling to each layer - and then strawberries sliced in half to decorate the top of the cake! BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS!

Made this tonight for the second time. My son said he wants this cake from now on for his birthday.  Like some of the other's I did not add the juice of the pineapple in the icing and it held up much better than when I added it the first time. Tastes just like ambrosia that my mom used to make. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Loved it!  The frosting was a little droopy.  I would drain the pineapple first, and add the liquid til it gets about right.  My layers were all poorly done, and my mom said I should have used dental floss, so I'll do that next time for sure.  My daughter had it for her b-day, and didn't want to share.  Making another for Easter!  Yay!

As described by one of my husband's employees, who got to taste this cake, this cake is soooooooooo awesome.  I made it for my twin's first birthday and it was a success!  But I made it for the first time a week before my babies' birthday and everybody was impressed.  Even my sister who's not really into sweets kept calling me everyday to see if I had any leftover cake.  Instead of using the serving & scaling system I just quadrupled everything, but it was a huge mistake because I ended up with lots of frosting.  Even then I did O.K.  I used a 12X18 pan (which is huge) and still did four layers.  I ended up with 2-16 oz containers of frosting, which I will be using later.  Thanks, Glenda for such a delicious cake recipe!

Great cake, will probably make it again.  I made this for company and everyone enjoyed it, plus the presentation of this cake alone is great for when you are entertaining.  It was a cold winter's night but this cake made it feel a bit summery inside our house - very light and refreshing. Also easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for our Thanksgiving office party.  It was a huge success!  I didn't make it in 4 layers though.  I use a  10x13 pan and just split the cake into two layers!  It was gone in a flash at the party!  Several people asked me for the recipe!  The only suggestion I would have would be to drain some of the liquid from the pineapple, I found the icing to be a bit runny!  I will be making this for Thanksgiving dinner with my family.  I'm sure they will gobble it up!

I have made this recipe countless times and now it is on my most requested list.  It is easy to make and the cake turns out moist and delicious everytime.  It is also good when lemon pudding is substituted for the vanilla.

I don't usually like to use cake mix, but I was in a hurry to produce a nice dessert, so I had no choice. Turned out great, and I'm glad I did. I dusted the top with the sweetened coconut. It tasted almost tropical. Yum! :)

Wonderful!  I used a basic 1-2-3-4 butter cake recipe and used this as the frosting.  The frosting was good enough to eat it without the cake!  Will definitely make again!

Turned out wonderfully. Super easy to make and put together. I followed the other suggestions and drained about 1/3 of the pineapple juice before mixing it in. Next time I'd probably use a lemon or orange cake mix instead of just plain vanilla. Cheers!

I made this cake for Easter dinner and it was the hit of the day!  Everyone loved it and they've already asked me to make it again, which I will.  One hint - this makes a LOT of frosting, so use a big bowl!  Also, if possible, it tastes even better the next day!  Thank you for a great recipe.
