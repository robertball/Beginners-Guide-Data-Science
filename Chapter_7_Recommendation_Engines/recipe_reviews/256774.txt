This recipe was delicious. I love anything with avocados. For my family, I did use 1/2 cup of corn and 3/4 cup of black beans because we like the avocado to be the star of the dip. I also added, 1 roasted green chili chopped  and chopped tomatoes.

This was so easy and became an instant favorite! We just loved how easy and tasty this comes together. I kept some of the avocado in chunks and it was great. Taste is perfectly seasoned! Definitely will be making again not just as a dip but also to top tacos!

Not my favorite dip, but very tasty. I like it as a side dish more. The flavors all mix together well  making a tasty dish to enjoy with friends or family.

This was a very easy dip to whip up in a hurry but it tastes like it took you longer to prepare. It's great to have the seasoning packet to just dump and mix.  I can see us using this recipe often as a quick dip to munch on.

This was a quick and easy recipe! I used frozen corn which added a nice pop of sweetness. I would add cilantro and a dash of chipotle peppers to spice it up next time. This would be great for a picnic or a snack out on the lake.

My husband and I loved it.  I don't usually use mixes when I cook, I like to cook from scratch . But I loved the McCormickÂ® Guacamole Seasoning Mix. The mix  was easy to use, tasted great, was more affordable than I expected, and the best part was not having to worry about adding additional seasonings and etc. The only thing I changed was using frozen corn instead of canned. I roasted the corn on the stove before putting it in the guacamole. We will definitely be adding this to our recipe rotation.

This was a quick and easy dip to make.  Served it with organic corn chips.  I made it with all organic ingredients, now if only the seasoning packet contained only organic ingredients, then it would have been 5 stars.

This was good but next time I will either add another avocado or decrease the amount of corn and black beans.  I  also think it would be good with the addition of some chopped onion and garlic and maybe even some cilantro!
