Gold medal meal! This is the perfect lunch when the thermometer hits 100Â°. I used thawed sorghum and some cold chicken (Sarah's Easy Shredded Chicken Taco Filling). Adding the sour cream, as mentioned, does take this over the top. I added jalapenos, black olives, and some manchego cheese. This recipe is simply too delicious to pass up. Soak your sorghum for about 30 minutes in water before cooking; it will reduce your cooking time in half. Thank you for your recipe.
