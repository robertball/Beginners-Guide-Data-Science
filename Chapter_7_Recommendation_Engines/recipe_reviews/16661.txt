This is a fabulous recipe!!!!  I made it using filo pastry instead of puff pastry.  I sprayed a 10" quiche dish with olive oil then lined it with 3-4 sheets of filo.  I sprayed on more olive oil (brushing it on) and applied another 3 layers or so of filo.  I sprayed the filo again and turned the ends of filo that hung over the dish into the dish.  I checked one last time to ensure that the last layer was lightly sprayed everywhere (top and sides) and baked it at 400 F for 10 minutes.  I also used one package of frozen spinach which I thawed by putting in the skillet with 4 T of water.  I cooked it over medium heat only until it was thawed to not destroy the nutrients.  I then put the spinach in a sieve to drain pressing down lightly to extract as much water as possible.  I didn't puree it.  I just added it with the nutmeg to the egg mixture.  I used 1% cottage cheese which I also drained (somewhat) in a sieve.  I sauteed the onions in olive oil instead of butter.  One large tomato thinly sliced will yield one layer over the onions--that's what I used.  The rest I did according to the recipe.  It looked great, was very quick to make and boy, did it go over well with both my vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests!!  This recipe will become the family favorite!!!  Many thanks, Diane.

This is really called "Prisnajac", it is from Italy, and normaly does not use the puff pastery, but the add off the crust makes it VERY nice...For people looking for a low carb style, I go with 4 eggs, 1 pound, cottage cheese, 1/2  stick butter, 1 pkg frozen spinach and 1 log of Crackle Barrel Yellow Cheddar, Defrost the spinach, and squeeze dry!!!, chop up, cup up cheese in chunks, mix everything together, season with salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder, nutmeg....but I DONT add any Whole onions or tomatoes, dump everything into a oiled with oilve oiled 8x8 pan and bake for 1 hour till set... Yummy

Very tasty.  I used a package of frozen chopped spinach, three eggs and 3/4 cup cottage cheese.  Used only 1 sheet puff pastry and made a 9" pie. Never thought of using puff pastry for a crust.  I make quiches often and now have a quick solution when I'm too busy to make pie crust.

This was really good.  Time consuming but simple and worth it.  My two kids (9 and almost 8) didn't rave but ate it.  This is high praise from my picky eaters.  The 200 temperature isn't high enough to cook in the specified time.  I will up it to 250-300 next time I make it.

I adjusted this recipe a little since I'm on a pretty restricted diet. I'm not permitted to have dairy products, or refined flour products so I substituted Extra firm Tofu (drained and crumbled) for the cottage cheese, instead of the fresh tomatoes, I substituted sun dried tomatoes, and used olive oil instead of the butter. I omitted the puff pastry (although I would have loved to have it) and I opted to have a nice salad on the side. Making this a tasty and filling meal.  The next time I make this, I'll opt to scale back just a tad on the nutmeg.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks!

I made this recipe in mini puff-pastry shells for a brunch.  I received so many compliments, and requests for this recipe.  Thank you so much!  This was absolutely delicious!  Even my kids who don't like spinach ate this.

Excellent recipe! I've made this a few times now! Though the first time, I didn't blind bake the crust properly...not knowing exactly what that meant! But now I know to add dried beans to keep the pastry in place while baking! My vegetarian boyfriend was very happy with this! He thought it was unusually light for a quiche and I agree! I even made this for Thanksgiving for him to go along with my Roasted Turkey Breast! It's something I'd make only on weekends or special days...definitely not a busy working mom/weeknight kind of recipe...but overall very, very good recipe!

Tried using phyllo dough- the crust came out soggy. Definitely use a pie crust and mix sauteed onions in with egg mix (after they've cooled)

I made this for a party and everyone raved over it. Especially my sister-in-law who is a vegetarian and has a hard time finding quality recipes without meat.

The only thing I did outside of the recipe was add a little bit of red pepper (needed to use it up). Excellent recipe - husband hates spinach but he ate two big helpings of this quiche. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! I left out the tomatoes, because my daughter's boyfirend, who was eating with us, doesn't like tomatoes. I was skeptical about the crust, thinking it would be soggy, but it wasn't at all. Didn't puree the spinach, but chopped it really finely and added at least twice as much. Thanks so much!

Made this for an unsuperbowl party. I used sauteed mushrooms, onions and spinich and did not put the onions on the bottom.  It was fantastic. I have so many people asking me where i got the recipe, they say its the best quiche they have ever eaten.  I will definately be making this one over and over!

I really liked the mixture of cottage cheese and spinach with nutmeg. (Don't worry---the nutmeg isn't dominant if you're hesitating to try it). My changes: added 6 slices of cooked bacon crumbles and used a prepared 8oz. container of crescent roll for the crust.) Loved it!

Was trying out something special to serve my upcoming vegetarian houseguests.  This was pretty good, but not something I would serve to company.  Liquid pooled at the bottom of the quiche making the crust very soggy, even though I pressed the tomatoes between towels before I put them in.  If I could fix that problem, it might be worth trying again because it had good flavor.

Excellent!  It was so good we didn't have any leftovers.  I used broccoli instead of spinach since my husband doesn't like spinach.  Don't skip the nutmeg.  I think it makes this recipe.

It was wonderful. Great Taste.  I even used a whole 10oz box of thawed, drained chopped spinach.  I put 1 cup of cheese in bottom and egg spinach mixture on top with tomatoes last.  Awww it was scrumptious.  Won't make it often because of the cheese fat, but it was good.

We loved this, didn't change a thing.  We did add sour cream and some sharp cheddar when we folded up the tortillas.  Great recipe will become one of our go-to recipes.

Ahhhhh Puff pastry. This recipe must have been taken from my own heart. I just loved it. The center was delicate and the crust from top to bottom was still crisp and light. I made a couple minor alterations, I blended one garlic clove in with the spinach, and strained the cottage cheese just a little. I don't own a quiche pan, so I decided to experiment with a 9" cake pan. I made sure to curl the pastry over the edge so it wouldn't fall, and that worked. 
Must comment on a few of the other reviews I've read, I didn't find it time consuming. I baked my shell early and cooked the onions and dealt with the spinach at the same time. Then beat my ingredients together. Was pretty simple Also, I've read "too many onions". I say choose your onion. I used a medium sweet and it was perfect, thought thinly sliced shallots might be good too. I'll always use puff pastry for quiche from now on. Thank you!

Loved it. I followed others advice on using phyllo. I used fat free cottage cheese and fat free cheddar cheese. I sautéed the onions in a small amount of cooking spray. I added fresh spinach to the onions and 1/4 tsp nutmeg & 1 tsp water. I actually ended up using 3 cups of fresh spinach cause it shrunk down and it appeared to need more. I mixed it all up with cheese and eggs and poured it on top of the tomato. This was delicious. We loved it and I will definitely make it again. Also, I did what the other reviewer suggested and sprayed the phyllo every 3 sheets, I sprayed it all at the end and baked at 400 for 10 min. When I put the quiche in to bake I covered the edge with tin foil so the phyllo would not burn. LOVED IT!!!! 

Okay, now that we have eaten the leftovers we are more in love with this recipe. I am planning next time to do as a reviewer suggested and make it without any crust to bring the calorie and carb content down. I am going to add shrimp and increase the nonfat cottage cheese. The leftovers on this were awesome!!!!

Delicious!!! This beautifully browned, colorful 
layered dish is worthy of a magazine photo and gets rave reviews from all. I did not purée the spinach, used sharp cheddar cheese, and added a dash of smoked Spanish paprika, which is amazingly delicious on eggs. Thank you, Diane, for sharing this new favorite recipe.

I served this quiche to my family for Christmas brunch. Everyone loved it including the picky eaters. I used the filo pastry. I brushed quiche dish with melted butter, then laid down a sheet of filo pastry (folding the edges back into the dish, laid another sheet, brushed with butter. I laid about 6 sheets, each time brushing with butter. I followed Gloria M's instruction and baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. I then followed the recipe. It was delicious and I'll surely make it again.

We didn't like this one so much way too many onions.  Although i like the flaky crust and i will use that again with my quiche recipes.

This was pretty good, though next time I'm going to try it with filo as another reviewer suggested. as I think it would stay crisper on the bottom.  Sauted a little garlic and some sliced mushrooms along with the onions and used frozen spinach, which I thawed and squeezed dry. Only used one sheet of puff pastry, which was more than enough.

This was really good. The kids said they liked it because it didn't have the 'eggy' taste. The cottage cheese gives it a ricotta texture. I baked these in 12 muffin tins using puff pastry squares.  I had some left over egg mixture so I baked that in a small pyrex baking dish without the crust for a wheat free option. Everything was baked in about 25 min. I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. I also used green onion instead of regular onion because of personal preference. I omitted the nutmeg because I don't like nutmeg in cheese dishes. Again because of the kids, I left out the bottom onion and tomato layer.  It seems like a lot of changes but the basic egg mixture was the same, minus the nutmeg. I will make this again.  I served the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. It's great for those vegetarian dinners, and for breakfast.  To reheat the next morning, just put on a baking sheet and warm in the oven at 350 deg for about 10 min.

This was very good! I made it for my picky toddlers w/ mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, left out the tomatoes, used half the nutmeg, used 1 box of frozen chopped spinach heated in the microwave instead of fresh (easier and  no blending or cooking on stove), and used olive oil instead of butter.

Very easy and VERY delicious! This was the first time I have ever made quiche, so for simplification, I skipped the puff pastry and just used two regular frozen pie crusts. So I have one quiche for this week and the other frozen to use later. I used diced tomatoes because I figured it would be difficult to cut with slices. I will try sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms next time. This will definitely be a regular menu item for me!

Excellent quiche; great flavors- although I did use lower fat versions of the cheeses, less butter, and phyllo with light sprays of olive oil to cut the fat a bit. And lulu589, yes, this most definitely is vegetarian...perhaps you are thinking about vegan-vegetarian?

I really liked this. Husband and brother-in-law liked it okay, but they're not quiche lovers like me.  I added garlic and bacon bits. Next time I am going to dice the tomatoes, because the tomato skin becomes like a string when trying to cut slices.  Will make again!

We replaced some of the onions with mushrooms and feel that this added a LOT of flavor. It was a solid quiche--we weren't blown away but it was moist with good flavor as wasn't overly Peggy.

Loved how fluffy and flaky it was. The cottage cheese made it very creamy. I changed only a couple of things. I buttered a tart pan and used a store bought pie shell, threw a sheet of aluminum foil over top just so the edges wouldn't start baking. Par-Baked at 350 for 10 minutes. I used 1 cup of egg beaters and 2 whole eggs (equivalent of 6 eggs) and wasn't sure how fluffy it would be w/o all the yolks so I added ~ 1-2tsp of xanthum gum just to be sure.  I also used 1/2 a pkg of frozen, chopped spinach and instead of tomatoes, I used about 1/4 cup of chopped roasted red bell peppers from a jar. I made all in advance except the egg mixture since this was for Easter brunch. I covered the edges with foil and baked the filled pie at 325 for 1 hour. Then pulled off the foil, increased the temp to 375 and moved the pie to the lowest shelf in the oven, baking for an additional 15 minutes. It was better than the quiche Lorraine (meat) that I made and it was good, but this was superb. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  Not sure whybsomeone would say that it isnt vegetarian.  It certainly is.  I would use Earth Balance, egg whites, et alt cheeses to lower fatvand cals, though.

I played with this recipe a lot.  I left out the tomato, added mushrooms, used scallions instead of onion and chose not to puree the spinach.  It was great.  I will definitely use this as a base for future quiches we have.

LOVED IT! I am a big fan of quiche so this was an easy one for me to love! I used puff pastry for the crust,left out the tomatoes (personal preference) and used Monterrey jack for the top. I thought the cottage cheese added a nice creaminess with the egg. I will try mushrooms in place of the tomato next time. Thanks a bunch for sharing!!

I was cleaning out the freezer and typed in puff pastry and spinach and found this recipe.  I used a box of frozen spinach and it turned out great.  My husband and I really enjoyed, but I had to bribe the kids to eat it by offering an apple turnover made from the other sheet of puff pastry!

This was the first quiche I have ever made. Everyone really liked it, I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee except I did not purée  the spinach,I just cut it into small quarter inch pieces. Could use a little more flavor but it is a good base to start on.

This was very delicious.  The only part that I did not enjoy was the puff pastry as the crust, but that might just be my preference.  Next time I will try pie crust or crescent rolls.

This is delicious and a real keeper.  I made it in a 10 inch pie plate since I don't have the right size quiche pan.  It fit perfectly.  I didn't change the quiche ingredients at all but I did use an almond flour crust to make it  low carb.

I made the quiche but added different vegetables i.e. mushrooms, artichokes, red peppers, & garlic, grated nutmeg along with pre made dough for the quiche. Hubby and I loved it and thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very good,  didn’t bother to puree the spinach. I’m going to add more veggies next time.

This was awesome!!! Made it for a Christmas brunch party and everyone loved it. I didn’t use the full tomato, just enough to cover the bottom. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty.  Just not appealing looking due to spinach being pureed.

So very good. I doubled everything to make 2 quiches. Also, I added 2 extra eggs to fill the pie glass since I don't have a quiche dish. Assembled exactly as instructed. Next time I would like to pour a little eggs/spinach mixture on top of the onions, then lay the tomatoes, and finally the rest of the egg/spinach mixture. Hopefully then the top half won't slide off the tomatoes.

Reheat for frozen quiche: Defrost in fridge 1 day. Insert pan into oven. Set to 350 degrees. Turn off oven when the temperature is reached and allow to sit for 30 mins in the oven.

I'm a big fan of quiche but didn't love this one. If I made it again I wouldn't puree the spinach. Also I didn't roll out the puff pastry enough so the crust was kind of thick. With some tweeks it could be better.

Loved this!!! I had to make some changes because I couldn't find a puff pastry anywhere near me. I used a regular pie crust. Still tasted great. I was out of nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice. It made it tasty, different for sure. Because we are on heart healthy diet here I used fat free cottage cheese, skim milk or low fat cheddar, and did all the veggies raw. I too substituted some of the onion for mushrooms. Great recipe can't wait to try it with just the nutmeg. It was a huge hit my house of nothing but boys.

I used frozen pie crust, added a can of salmon, added some chopped zucchini, and defrosted (and squeezed dry) a package of frozen spinach. Also, only 1 tomato was needed. So delicious!!

Excellent!  Everyone asks me for the recipe.  Sometimes I omit the tomatoes, if I don't have any.
