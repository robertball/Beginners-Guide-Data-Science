Really good!  As suggested, I also skipped the parsley and added two big cloves of minced garlic which I sauteed in the butter before adding the other ingredients. I will be making this side dish often!

Had some bakery croutons in the freezer that got completely squished - perfect for this recipe.  Not a lot to criticize or analyze on this one - prepared this exactly as written and would do so again.  Loved it - took the lowly green being from boring and merely edible to interesting, elegant and delicious.

This recipe was a good way to change up green beans.  My sister had seconds and she never eats green beans!  I added minced garlic to the beans as they were boiling and skipped the parsley.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the directions exactly and did not care for this recipe. The bread crumbs fell off and got gummy. It wasn't pretty.

I was looking for a real Italian recipe with real ingredients.  I love this recipe.  I did make some changes- I used a 1 lb bag of frozen green beans, cooked according to directions, then (seperate pan) melted the butter (only using 2 Tbsp) and added minced garlic, once brown, I added the green beans and mixed together.  Then, I added the parmesan cheese.  I omited the parsley (taste) and bread crumbs (making it low carb!).  My daughter ate 3 portions! When I'm not low carbing, I plan on making this recipe exactly as is.

I skipped the parsley also and added garlic pepper & seasoned salt.  I was in a hurry to make the green beans and didn't measure out the bread crumbs or cheese -- and it still tasted yummy!  Great, simple recipe for using fresh beans.

This recipe is great. Only thing i did different was switch the amount of cheese and bread crumbs.  I like more seasoning than cheese. My husband and kids even liked it. They hate veggies!

The greasy breadcrumbs did nothing for the green beans and while we ate them, it was the unanimous verdict that the leftovers be rinsed off in an attempt to salvage them.

I made this recipe exactly as written last night and the entire family loved it. I served these beans with Italian Breaded Pork Chops, also from this site, and parsley potatoes with a half cup of sour cream to take the potatoes up a notch. This dinner was worth a 10 star rating and would be a customer pick on any resaurant meno.

These were some of the best green beans we have had. What an easy, simple recipe! I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so used extra seasoning of basil , oregano and Parmesan cheese. Simply fantastic!,,

This was very good, but will not make again.  There are a lot of ways to make good green beans without adding the calories of butter, bread, and cheese.

I made this recipe primarily as written, except I used Italian seasoned panko crumbs and added some chopped oregano into the breading. I didn't mind that the crumbs did not adhere to the beans, but I think overall there could have been less bread crumbs.

This recipe was excellent!  Only slight changes I made were to omit the parsley and salt to taste (enough salt in the cheese).  This will now become one of our "go to" fav green bean recipes!  Thanks for posting!

It looked delicious but I wasn't impressed with the flavor. I usually add a Tbs of salt to water when I'm cooking green beans, that brings out their flavor, but since it wasn't in the recipe I didn't do it. Big mistake! I added chopped garlic and sauteed in the butter before adding bread crumbs+Parmesan, and I didn't have fresh parsley so skipped that part. The crumbs didn't stay on the green beans, and everything just tasted bland, the garlic didn't even come through. I guess I needed more green bean flavor and spice to make this interesting... but it's not the healthiest way to eat green beans AND I didn't enjoy it so I probably won't make it again.

This is a super easy way to jazz up green beans. I used it when we had so many beans in season that we needed variety. It looks so beautiful in the dish; I tucked julienne red bell pepper all around the border of the dish. It'll be my new Christmas bean dish, a lot lighter than the mushroom soup etc. One thing to be careful about is that you really want keep proportions right. One time I made it, the bread crumb/parmesan was overwhelming - also delicious but not what I had in mind.

The only seasoning is the little bit in the bread crumbs. How about some garlic and basil? Or even a spoonful of Tomato sauce to give it some oumph! And all that butter? Who needs that when most of us are watching our fat intake. Not impressed with this recipe, it needed a lot of work. Sorry, not a keeper in my Box.

Very good recipe. I used Parmigiana and Romano cheese with Pre-seasoned Italian bread crumbs. The flavor was great but it was very salty. The next time I make it I will omit the salt alltogether

Very tasty. I followed this recipe exactly, except omitted the parsley and added garlic powder as others suggested. This complemented nicely the red sauce with meatballs and eggplant parm.

Just tried this recipe last minute, as dinner was ready except for cooking the green beans, which I hate by the way!  It was outstanding, my hubby and I were fighting over the last few. (he loves green beans!)  I microwaved mine to 75% done, rather than steaming them, skipped the parm and parsley due to a lack of it, and used the italian flavored bread crumbs I had on hand.  Thanks for this, hope to do it again exactly as written, but your recipe was a great spring board for me tonight.

Simple, easy and delicious. The only thing is I will do next time I make this is to add fresh garlic. My 5 year old who normally won't even touch green beans devoured them. Once I add the garlic I am sure this will be a 5 star recipe and I will be making it again.

Easy to make and delicious...  I would make this again...  It was the perfect side dish... I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so seasoned some bread crumbs that I made the other day...  So much better than "store bought"...

I have two members of my family who don't like green beans, but if I make this, they clean their plates. Very good!

These were very good and easy to make. Used frozen green beans (steamed them--careful to not overcook). Green beans are rather boring on their own, but this recipe brings them alive with ingredients you already have on hand. Easy to convert to gluten free by using GF Italian Seasoned Panko bread crumbs. Will definitely make this again!

I added some minced garlic and really enjoyed these string beans!  Would definitely make again!

I hate green beans and this has been my go to recipe.  I've made this recipe at least 4 times since trying it a month ago!

Delicious ! Made this tonight. Followed what others said about skipping the parsley and added garlic. The only other thing I did differently was to add a splash of red wine vinegar towards the end to give it a little acidity. Great recipe. Thanks !!

Loved the crispy Parmesan flavor. I used garlic salt since so others recommended adding garlic. Perfect!

I think the parmesan is better on top after the dish is done but by far the best way to spruce up green beans that I have found. Thank you!

I loved it! My family however...not so much. They are anti-green when it comes to veggies, broccoli, green beans, peas. I can dress them up in chocolate and they'll still have a hard time eating them. I thought they were delicious and super tasty. I did omit to the parsley though because I didn't have any but it was still very good.
