I coudn't find peach nectar, so I used frozen peach concentrate, it was a little thick, so I added some sprite to thin it down a bit.  Was a hit, tasted just like a bellini!

very good and simple. I am giving it only a 4 because the people that I made the punch for were looking for more of the alcohol punch. This is great for a Bridal shower!

Great punch!

I made this for Mother's Day Brunch without the Peach Brandy and everyone could drink it as a juice for the kids or add it to champagne for a wonderfully different adult beverage.

I served this at a 50th wedding reception and the color was perfect for "gold".  I could not find Peach Nectar like I used to get years ago (real thick) but what I was able to find was in the Mexican section of my grocer. It seemed to lack the peach flavor as much as the thicker nectar so I added about 1/2 c. Peach Shnapps which worked well.

This was absolutely the hit of our winter party! I ended up making another batch only an hour into the gathering because it went so fast. Everybody raved about how good it was! I used the Ceres brand peach nectar, and added frozen sliced peaches.

This punch was a hit with EVERYONE! Only problem is this does not serve 24 on a hot day, it was gone in about an hour. Perfect for a hot summer BBQ, men loved it too, double the recipe for 20 people or more if you want it to last all day. Also, for a less juicy version, cut back or omit frozen orange juice. Ran out on 2nd batch, threw in some fresh OJ, and some people preferred it. Also I used 1 cup Peach Vodka 1/3 cup Regular Brandy.

Good recipe. I made this for a small gathering and it was a hit. It makes two punch bowls full. I was not able to find peach brandy so I used apricot brandy and it was just great. I will be using this for wedding showers that I cater.

This was a very good recipe (I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if that was an option).  I made it for a bridal shower and the guests wouldn't drink anything else.   The other bridesmaids kept tapping me on the shoulder saying - "I think you need to go make up some more of that punch".  I had to refill my punch bowl at least 3 times during the shower and several guests asked me for the recipe.   Made it exactly as the recipe called for and later started cutting it with some Sprite soda because the room was spinning :) - beware it does have a kick to it.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  

I can't remember exactly the changes because I just started to adjust the ratios when I couldn't fit it into my container I was working with.  I think this is pretty much what I ended up with: 

I substituted 1 bottle of champagne for 1 bottle of Sprite and left out the 3rd bottle all together.  I did use the peach necar which looked like soda pop cans (found in the latin food section at Wal-Mart).  Everything else was used as directed.

Absulutly deee...lish. I made this for my parents 50th anniversary party. I did not measure anything. I just threw it together and it turned out wonderful. I used peach schnapps instead of the brandy. I also used Korbel brut champagne, it was perfect because it's not sweet. Their were people drinking that never drinks. I had alot of people asking for the recipe. Thanks so much...

I recently made this punch for a friends bridal shower it was a hit.  I  ran out and  had to send a friend to the store quick for more champagne.  I used blackberry brandy instead of peach brandy because that was all they had at the liquor store I went to.  I also used 2 bottles of peach champagne and 1 bottle of strawberry.  I just gave the recipe to my mom to used for my aunt and uncle's 50th wedding anniversary.

Would have been better if we hadn't accidentally used regular brandy instead of peach brandy.  I thought it needed to be a little sweeter, but using the right ingredient probably helped.

great recipe and easy as well.
couldn't find peach brandy so used peach schnapps.  I also floated a package of frozen peaches in the bowl.  Everyone loved it (and it was a tough crowd to please). I will keep this recipe and make it again. Thank you

Very good punch!  Made it for my son's engagment party.  Used peach schnapps instead of brandy per other reviews.  Actually, used extra schnapps because we prefer a stronger "kick" to our punch.  Made the ice ring and put frozen peach slices in it.  Very pretty and very tasty.  Every bit of it went.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was super tasty and a hit at a baby shower I threw. I used frozen raspberries instead of a fruit ring and only used 2 bottles of champagne (my punch bowl couldn't hold any more!), and it was still tasty.

Love this, love this!  I've made it for two parties already.  The only thing I did diffrently is that I had to use Peach Schnapps instead of the brandy.  My liquor store was out, so I made do and it was fabulous!

I made this punch for my grandfather's 80th birthday party and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and used a freshly squeezed lemon where it called for lemon juice. I also made a beautiful ice ring out of some extra peach nectar. I froze maraschino cherries and lemon slices into the mold. It was a huge hit!

This is my go-to party punch! Just be careful, because after a few glasses the alcohol tends to sneak up on you! I've also substituted strawberry nectar and liquor for the peach when I've had people over who don't like peach. Not quite as good, but still tasty!

This was great!  I made just as is, except subbed peach schnapps for the brandy and added cointreau as well to enhance the OJ flavor.  I used frozen raspberries instead of ice cubes or an ice ring.  What a hit! One guest who doesn't even like peaches asked for the recipe! Will definately make again!

This went over very well for an afternoon bridal shower. I goofed and left my peach brandy at home, but the host had apricot brandy and it turned out fine. If I have occasion to make this again, I would be sure to buy pulp-free OJ. Didn't even occur to me, I always buy OJ with pulp (personal preference) but not so attactive in a punch like this.

This punch was SOOOO good!  I made it for my New Years Eve party and my friends kept begging for more! I threw in a few maraschino cherries to make it a big more exciting, but it is so incredibly delicious.

This was a HUGE hit at my New Year's gathering.  I used peach sherbet instead of nectar and peach schnapps (that's what my grocery had available) but it still came out great.  Thanks - this one's a keeper!

Easy to make and delicious! A fantastic punch  for your next "girls only" party. My friends and I like to go out for Belinis, and this drink is just as great.

I made this for a party recently and everyone loved it.  I only used 2 bottles of champagne and I floated frozen peaches on top which looked pretty and kept the punch cold.  This is definitely a keeper!

Perfect for brunch. I used schnapps instead of brandy and did not have grenadine. Was sooo good.

I did use schnapps instead of brandy.  Was a little sweet and tame for my taste.  everyone thought it was good though, and the second batch went pretty quickly.  I used frozen peaches for the chill factor., hindsight, should have cup them in half or thirds to allow folks to eat them instead of getting splashed in face.

I made this for a brunch Sip and See baby shower.  I couldn't find peach nectar so, I just used peach juice and it was fine.  I didn't have peach brandy so, I just used regular brandy and probably almost doubled it.  Didn't even add the club soda.  (Why water it down:)  Other than that, followed the recipe.  I even squeezed my own lemon juice. The punch came out great.  Gone before I knew it.

Love this. I added some peach schnapps because I needed to use it up. Delish!
