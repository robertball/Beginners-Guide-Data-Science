I followed the directions in this recipe with the exception of  1) using a mix of yellow squash and zucchini, 2) using my Paderno to cut the squash into "noodles," and 3) adding diced, cooked chicken, making this an all-in-one casserole. I loved the texture the almonds gave to the dish! It was a delicious, fresh tasting entree for dinner.

I cut the almonds in half, used yogurt instead of whipping cream, and parmesan for the cheese.  I also increased the butter and oil to 2 tbs apiece. Great idea for a recipe.

Great Recipe!  I didn't have fresh garlic so I used some garlic salt.  Didn't use almonds.  I used a can of CREAM OF CELERY SOUP, with half can of skim milk in the egg/cheese/squash mixture. After spreading in the baking dish I topped with FRENCH'S FRENCH FRIED ONIONS and THEN topped with some shredded cheese.  DEEELicious!

Delish! I'm really not a squash fan, but this was soooo so good, I had seconds! I didn't have any cream so I used 1/4 c. skim milk and 1/4 c. nonfat Greek yogurt, which really gave it a creamy taste and more protein. I also didn't have onions, so I used half a large shallot and lots more garlic.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow :-)

Made this for a family get together. Everyone loved it even the young ones! Followed recipe to a T except for using a Tex Mex blend of cheeses which added a bit more flavor but honestly, didn't really need it. The crunch of the almonds was fantastic. Having made it once, I will definitely make again. It's very adaptable, and will try varying with differnent cheeses ( gruyere comes to mind) and more heat now that the young ones aren't around

This recipe is awesome!!  What an ingenious solution to the typical mushy squash casserole using boiled squash.  I didn't have whipping cream, but used sour cream & milk as suggested in another review.  Really liked the almond topping & LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the texture.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe Tigray!

Like another reviewer said, this recipe is really a good base that you can then customize to your own taste. Like others suggested, I added a can of Rotel. I used hot Rotel with habeneros. For the cheese, I used Pepper Jack. I shredded the squash rather than dicing it, which gave it a texture like a hash brown casserole. The almonds are a really great and unique addition to the recipe. However, I used them only on the inside of the dish. For the topping, I used panko breadcrumbs and a few dabs of butter. You don't need to use a lot of breadcrumbs to add the texture, so you can still keep it relatively low carb even with this addition. Overall, this was a really good recipe base that is easy to play around with. I love it and it will be a go-to recipe for years to come.

I have made this a couple times and it is always excellent.  I use both green and yellow zucchini and never peel them.  I also add a can of rotel.  The almonds definitely enhance the dish so if you're on the edge about using them or not, use them!

To fool the youngsters and picky eaters, I shredded the squash instead of cubing (which also speeds up cooking). I browned the garlic and onion, added the squash and seasoning. I also subbed pepper jack cheese to blend the colors- further masking the deception of feeding them a vegetable dish. Next time, I'd rather use 2 cups of cheese and substitute whole milk for the cream so that the fat content remains nearly the same. I also plan on mixing dijon mustard in with the egg and milk, adding celery salt instead of plain salt and putting the roasted almonds and cheese mix on after it comes out of the oven. It was a little bland, but with a few extra personal touches is a great way to eat squash. My girls said it was great! This also would make a great breakfast casserole if you wanted to crumble sausage in with the onions and substitute hash browns for the squash.

I also made some changes. I added 2 chicken breasts, grilled and cut in bite size pieces, 1 bunch of broccoli florets, 1 can rotel tomatoes, to make a complete meal. My daughter and I loved it. She said it deserved 10 stars. I will be making it again, especially this summer when we have our own squash. Loved the almonds in it. Thanks for the recipe.

I have someone in the family that can't have almonds, this was still excellent. I had 2 yellow and 2 zucchini squash, next time I will double it with 4 yellow and 4 zucchini squash and double all other ingredients.

So good.  Shredded the veggies.  Used carrots,onions and zucchini.  Used feta cheese instead.  The almonds were delish.  Ate too much but at least it is healthy.

I have an egg allergy so I used a personal size container of Greek yogurt in place of the 2 eggs and added a tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening. Aside from those two simple changes I followed the recipe as stated. I put everything together and added some cooked bacon crumbles (which just happened to be available in the fridge that day). This dish turned out amazing!  The flavor is incredible, very similar to scalloped potatoes. Next time I will likely add a layer of shredded chicken, prior to topping with the cheese and almonds. With a bit of added protein this would be a scrumptious main meal.

Loved it! Added a can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes, and used shredded zucchini, squash, and added a shredded carrot for some color. I used 1/4 cup of almond flour inside (instead of ground almonds) but no almonds on top (kids). Also added homemade seitan to add some protein. Oh, and inside used Monterey Jack cheese, on top used cheddar. Really great!

Second time I made this I subbed homemade Greek yogurt for the heavy cream. Also turned out great.

I made this with a few changes.  I used red onions, added maybe a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, I added 1/2 cup medium salsa, and I used shredded parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. I followed directions otherwise. My whole family loved it and I was shocked lol. They aren't usually a fan of my healthier lower carb options.

Yummy! I made this as written, except I did not put toasted almonds on top, only because I was running out of time.  I plan to use the toasted almonds next time, though. I really liked the crunch of the raw almonds inside the casserole. I'm eating low-carb and have a garden, so this recipe is a keeper!

My hubby and I are not big fans of squash, but we are determined to expand our list of vegetables. This is a keeper, but I need to cut the recipe in half next time. It was too much for just the two of us. I also had to add cheese and almonds to the top to cover it all. I also used a lot more butter.  I liked the extra crunch that the almonds added to the dish. In rebuttal to a one star review that claimed this was unhealthy do to the fat, they are 100% incorrect. This recipe uses good fats, and is very healthy.

I cut the squash into noodles also, cut the egg to 1, used greek yogurt instead of cream. Used a mix of  Parmesan, Pecorino and Romano instead of the cup of cheese.

Yes - make again.  I used smaller pan as it didn't seem to make as much for a 9x13 pan.   Also, I would decrease the amount of almonds next time and try adding zucchini into it - maybe a 1/2 zucchini, 1/2 squash.

Very good -- ALL of us liked.

I made it according to the recipe and found it to be quite good.  My family also liked it.  I’ve been looking for low carb dishes to help me with health issues.  This would be a keeper even if I weren’t eating low carb.  Thanks for this one!

I really liked it! it tasted much better than I thought it would since it is a healthy dish. the cheese and almonds go nicely together. I added a little more cheese and almonds into the casserole and added a bit of cayenne pepper to the dish for flavor

No, but next time I will add a can of cream of chicken or mushroom soup and more cheese.. If want to keep the carbs down just the cheese. The toasted almonds were delicious in it.

This was great. Used a mix of yellow squash and zucchini sliced thin with a hand held mandolin. Used sour cream and a splash of skim milk. No almonds. Used Parmesan and mozzarella. Was watery on bottom. I think I’ll reduce the liquid next time and let the squash cook uncovered in the pan with the onions before baking. Still delicious. Maybe sprinkle in red paper flakes for something extra.

The addition of almonds added another dimension to this casserole. I sliced the squash and didn't peel it. And I used chopped almond slivers. Delicious!

Great way to use up summer squash. Only thing I changed was swapped yogurt in place of the heavy cream and left the squash a bit crunchy. Will definitely keep this recipe.

I omitted the almonds yet it was still good. Also, I used cheddar cheese and milk with plain yogurt instead of cream. The last 2 minutes I topped it with panko bread crumbs. The family liked it.

Had 4 c zucchini to use up, so used it all.  Instead of almonds inside, I used 1/2 c Bisquick, then topped it with about 1/3 c chopped roasted, not salted almonds and crushed crackers, like Ritz.  
Don't know whether I did not bake it long enough, but it came out quite mushy inside.  The taste was Very good, though.

Very good! Did change a few  things though to help my picky husband! 1. Added two tablespoons oil and 1 tbs butter. 2. Added two chicken breasts  cut up in small pieces. 3. Added one can original Rotel tomatoes with green chilis. 4. Sprinkled ritz crackers on top along with the other items it suggested. 5. Added a half cup greek yogurt to whipping cream and egg mix.  Very yummy!!!

Really liked this as an alternative to the normal boring squash.  Tried to make it even more healthy. No butter, just Pam. 1 egg, 1 egg white,  1/2 cup total mixed cheese,  and almond milk.  Cooked the same way as described.

I had no Colby jack so I used cream cheese mixed in, about 1/3 cup.  I used feta on top with the chopped almonds and it was very good.  I also used milk in place of the cream.  So I improvised but it was still very good.

This was REALLY GOOD.  I did not have Colby or Monterrey Jack cheese, so I used Cheddar and topped with Parmesan.  Next time I will use more yellow squash/zucchini--maybe another two cups.  Definitely a keeper.

The only change .. I used a different cheese blend that I had on hand.  Truly, I believe you could use your favorite cheese and it would be just as good.

Very good and I’m not a squash eater. I did not peel the squash and added some of my own seasoning. Will make again!

Made exactly as recipe but found it very bland.....if I made it again I would add peppers and hot pepper cheese in addition to more seasonings.

This was delicious!  Made a few tweaks... swapped almonds for gluten free panko and heavy cream for almond milk.  I used two squash...would suggest three to have a little more squash and definitely recommend spraying the pan with cooking spray.  It really stuck to the pan as I forgot to spray.  Great side dish!!

Had a butternut squash fresh off the vine, ended up with 8 cups, doubled  the recipe.  Used Tex Mex cheese along with the Colby Mozzarella cheese.  Soooo good, what little bit that was left served with  breakfast.

I made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out great.  A wonderful way to use the many yellow squash I got in my garden this year.  I will make it again and again.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I doubled it because I knew the regular recipe wouldn't allow  enough leftovers.  I did not parboil the squash as instructed.  I threw it in the skillet with the butter and green onions, added garlic powder, black pepper and a bit of kosher salt, and covered it for about five minutes.  The squash was tender.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe.  In my opinion, the crushed pork rinds aren't really necessary, as you can't taste them.

It is definitely made for a low carb diet.  Still healthy with the addition of the cheese because one needs fat (good fat) in a low carb diet.  I went a step further and added some homemade pork sausage to the recipe.  It turn out wonderfully in that even our grandkids liked it.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe made an unbelievably tasty side dish, and made a squash eater out of my husband. I felt that the 9x13 dish made the recipe a bit flat in shape, although it browned quite nicely. At first I thought the amount of almonds was a bit over the top, it totally was not. We plan on remaking this in a smaller dish, with coarsely ground cooked ham, and chopped green peppers. We plan on reheating the leftovers with some coarsely ground ham on top as our breakfast tomorrow.

Awesome dish! Made it yesterday and took it to a gathering where everyone asked to take some home. So good! Not heavy but very satisfying. I didn't have almonds and substituted macadamia nuts. Believe this is a great recipe that can be tweaked in many different ways. Add spices, other veggies, meats, many possibilities. Enjoy!

Didn’t quite understand why you’d peel yellow squash So, I  used yellow (summer) squash, thinly sliced without peeling.  In place of cream, I used whole milk with 1/8 cup of Half & Half—totaling 1/2 cup. Also, instead of more almonds, I substituted   a small amount of bread crumbs sprinkled over top cheese.  Cooked for 30 minutes until browned...Delicious!!!!

This was a very tasty dish. I combine it with the Yellow Squash Casserole the second time, and still delicious.

That was delish!  I really needed a recipe for all the squash coming out of my garden and that was the perfect dish!  I might switch out the almonds with French fried onions like another user suggested.  But overall great dish!

My husband and I loved this, and most of my kids (except the pickiest) thought this was pretty good. They are so hard to please, especially when I’m making them eat “healthy” food, so this says a lot. I doubled the recipe, used a mixture of yellow squash and zucchini, and baked it in the same ovenproof skillet I used to cook the squash.

This was really good and will make again.  I had to make a few changes with what I had on hand.  I only made half the recipe.  Used Monterey Jack cheese and half and half cream.  I also added a small can of diced green chilis.  Rather than using another bowl, I followed the steps and mixed it in the frying pan.  After putting in the baking pan, I topped it with grated Parmesan and sprinkled panko, I didn’t have almonds.  Really yummy!!

Since I had just picked the tender yellow squash in our garden, there was no need to peel it.  I did not cover the pan to precook the squash and onions, which added a few minutes to the prep time BUT eliminated the excess liquid mentioned by several reviewers.  I had no heavy whipping cream, so I used half and half.  This turned out very well and I will make it, again.

Excellent low carb recipe! I also added about 1/4 cup grated parm and used both zucchini and yellow squash. I didn't have almonds so just used cheese. We will make this again!

I made this for dinner last night. The only change I made was I used a combination of toasted sliced almonds and just blanched sliced almonds because that was what I had on hand. It is definitely a keeper. My husband and I both enjoyed it.

This was a very tasty side dish. The almonds were a really nice touch. I forgot to separate the cheese and ended up just adding the whole cup into the mixture instead of half on top, but it still turned out great! Will definitely make again. I feel like this would make a great dish at Thanksgiving or Christmas too!

We loved this dish. I didn't have Monterey Jack so I substituted the sharp cheddar and mozzarella I had on hand. I also didn't have almonds so I omitted them, I'm looking forward to adding the almonds to the recipe in the future.

Perfect for a low carb diet.  I made it pretty much as written.  I did add in 1/2 tsp cumin seed to the onion when sauteing - it just seemed like it needed some herbs or spices.  I used a Mexican Blend shredded cheese because that's what I had.  The almonds added a lot of intrest to this.  I think next time I'll use a combo of veggies - maybe some carrots.  Thanks Tigray for the great recipe!

Pretty good stuff, and a welcome change from my usual steamed squash. I made it as written, but will substitute milk instead of cream, and probably back off the amount, next time. I'd like the taste of the squash to be a bit more pronounced.

I made this for a Thanksgiving meal at work.  It got rave reviews! I added some spiral zucchini to it instead of all yellow squash.  By the end of the luncheon the casserole dish had a lot of liquid in the bottom...wondering if I should add some Xantham Gum to thicken it up a bit next time...may have been extra moisture from the added Zucchini...?

Tasted great! Hubby didn’t like it he thought it was too much like a quiche. I gave it 1 less star because it definitely didn’t keep well overnight in the fridge and ended up a little watery.

Yum! I didn't have almonds so I put some pork rinds in the food processor and used them. I added garlic powder and seasoning salt to them. I used Monterey Jack cheese and it was fabulous! Great low carb dish!!

Umm...Amazing! I made exactly to recipe and won't change a thing next time I make it either. This was so rich, it really hit the spot. I recently went grain, potato, and legume free so I've been craving something other than the plain ol veggie and this was perfect! My husband who doesn't like zucchini squash even said it was really good. I just grated my zucchini on a cheese grater bc I don't have a noodle thing. Will make this for guests!

While the squash was cooking in the pan I mixed the cheese/eggs/HWC then added the squash before putting into a baking pan. Then I sauteed the almonds in butter, added some Truvia and then bacon bits. Poured this on top of the squash with some extra cheese and baked until the top began to brown. Delish!

I made this almost exactly the way the recipe calls for, minus cooking the squash in the skillet a little longer due to cutting pieces a bit big (Oops), and not adding as many almonds. It was very good, and imo doesn't *need* changing.

There are different things I'm going to try, but this turned out really well! Very tasty.

My husband couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it. I really liked it too. Next time I think I will use some zucchini as well since others seem to have had success doing that.

This dish was very tasty and a good way to use the tons of yellow squash we have from the garden this time of year. Next time we make this dish, we will reduce the salt and add some peppers to the sautéed mix. We also used sliced almonds for the topping which added a delicious crunch.

Too bland. I followed the recipe as written, and it doesn't have much flavor. It definitely needs something more.

Yummy!  I have been doing a low carb diet the last few months and this a great new recipe.  I followed the other reviewers recommendation about the Rotel.  It was a great addition!  The only other change is that I used raw almonds for the topping instead of roasted.  The almonds add a nice crunch!

I tried this recipe and it was a big hit! My boyfriend is watching his carbs so I looked up low-carb dishes. We both love squash. I cooked as is. I have to say the prep time was longer for me. I'm considering buying the diced squash to save prep time. He would prefer the almonds not be in there. Otherwise, he told me not to change a thing! I was wondering what (that I can use again) can replace the whipping cream. Not only did he ask for seconds, he asked for the recipe! Excellent!

I've made this casserole twice and it rocks the house! Its a really great side if you're trying to cut down on carbs but have gotten sick of steamed broccoli. The first time I used evaporated milk in place of the cream but the cream sure does make it richer! I don't recommend leaving out the almonds as they really give this a unique texture that make it something special. Both times mine came out looking like the picture submitted by csread.

I used 2 large yellow squash, 2 large zucchini. This turned out ok- not great.  Maybe that other home chef's idea of adding chiles is just what it would take to make it special. I ground up my almonds in the nutribullet with a milling blade- maybe chopping
