Have made it 3 times with good reviews from vegans and non-vegans.  
Reduced seitan amount to 8oz (Upton's Naturals) because that was size of package, and it seemed the perfect amount to us.
The last time we had it I added a cup of frozen peas when nearly done, which enhanced the color and the flavor.

I wan't able to find actual vegan stout before I was ready to cook this, so next time I will find, ahead of time, where I can buy that.

I used Guiness;  I think for my own tastes I would buy a lighter stout.  I used store bought seitan, and it was a little chewy, not so pleasant, so I might actually try making my own to see if I can come up with a better consistency.

Otherwise, made as directed, very good flavor.  My family enjoyed the flavor, not so much the seitan.

Added some peas because I like them and threw in a not beef bouillon cube, a little water and a bit more flour. This is an awesome recipe. Iâ€™ll be eating this all week.

Guinness is not vegan or vegetarian, since they still use fish batters to filter.
