This is a great salad for picnics.  Always a big hit!  I omit the almonds as I am not a big fan of almonds.  Instead of almonds, I add crumbled bacon and golden raisins..... FABULOUS!

Seems like a strange combo, but is one of our favorite salads.

A somewhat unusual combination, but delicious!  It's light and fresh, which is perfect for summer.

02-29-16 ~ Great salad!  I thought the combination of broccoli and strawberries sounded a little odd, but it works.  And......it works, well!  I made this up, as written, in the morning.  At dinner time I toasted the almonds and added them before serving.  The flavors blended nicely in this dish.  Next time I might add some diced red onion.  Served this as the side to 'Buffalo Chicken Wraps' from AR, along with cucumber slices and cooked carrots.

I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots (shredded), and strawberries.  I also used vegan mayo and varied carrot colors which gave nice varied color for salad.
