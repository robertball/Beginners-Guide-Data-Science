YUMMY!! I didn't have any lemon juice but had a couple lemon bars leftover from earlier this week.  Blended everything together except the lemon bars.  I did not press through a sieve.  I like the chunkiness. Then chopped the lemon bars in tiny pieces and stirred them in.  SOOO Yummy!!  (It needed the little bit of lemon).

This was about the easiest thing I ever made.  Had some old blueberries to use up and this did the trick.  It came out yummy.  I served it with hot fudge and it was good.  Would definitely try with other fruits.  I may adjust the amount of sour cream down next time just a little.

I used fat free cream cheese instead of sour cream. I liked the texture so I didn't strain it. Really delicious. You must follow the direction to remove from freezer 30 minutes before eating. It froze rock hard. I stole another reviewers idea and served this on top of a lemon bar. Very pretty.

Try 1/3 raspberries, 2/3 blueberries and don't strain, just mix the frozen berries with everything else in a blender and then run in an ice cream maker. Super!

Super easy!!  I make my own yogurt so I used it instead of the sour cream for a frozen yogurt treat.  It came out excellent!!
