Oh baby you know how to play with my taste buds! Beets are so underrated. I don't like them pickled etc...but they are so good cooked in dishes and this is no exception. Very nice and healthy too!

Very good recipe - this will be a regular in our house.  I used regular beets and quartered them, honey in place of the stevia, and romaine for the watercress.  Served the salad on the side without the tuna.  The salad would also be good with orange supremes and goat cheese.  Marinated the tuna steak for 10 minutes in soy sauce, orange juice  concentrate and honey then pressed black and white sesame seeds onto the steak and grilled.  Served that as a main dish.

We've just experienced a snowstorm and, the store being low, I had to substitute baby spinach for the watercress. I prepared the recipe exactly in all other ways. The vinaigrette was suprisingly subtle when paired with the beets. I liked this one. I'll make it again.
