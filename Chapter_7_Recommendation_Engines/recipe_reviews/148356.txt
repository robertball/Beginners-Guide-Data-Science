I made this with modifications (of course, I cant help myself!)  I jazzed up the quinoa by cooking in vegetable broth and adding some italian seasoning, mushrooms and asparagus because I had them and needed to use them up.  Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  Didnt have fresh lemon to put on top and think it would have made it even better.  My husband (who I don't think was expecting much, by the way!) said it was really good and maybe we should add some lemon pepper to the top before baking and I will try that next time.  This is probably a 3 star before modifications, and a 5 after, so am rating a 4.

This dish was a nice combination of flavors. My husband said "wouldn't have expected quinoa in an Italian dish, but it went very well together."  I did substitute Pangasius instead of Sole, which is a good alternative, I read on a site. The quinoa I cooked less time than was given - medium low, otherwise it would have scorched.  My herbs were dry rather than fresh, but that was not a problem. I just did the dry to fresh reduction. Also my vinegar was apple cider - didn't have red wine.    Due to the thickness of the fish and quinoa I did have to take it out of the oven after the 4 minutes and carefully flip it so the other side would cook in the broiler.  All in all a good healthy meal!  Thank you.

This is a good basic recipe. My only difficulty was that it was a little bland. I'm on a lot of food restrictions, though, so I wanted to make this recipe work! Solution: GARLIC! I added 2 cloves of garlic to the quinoa as it cooked, and then sliced a 3rd clove and laid that over the sole before popping it in the oven. I also sprinkled a little sesame oil over all before tossing it in. I can't have spicy food right now... but should my stomach again be able to handle it, I would love to try this recipe with a little hot red pepper chopped fine and added into the mix. Someone try it and let me know how it turns out!

As a few others said - the underside of the fish did not cook properly. I really liked the idea of this because I love quinoa - but the final product was only OK. It just wasn't that great of a taste - not bad per say, but nothing I would make again.

Very bland.  It didn't taste bad so that's the reasoning for 2 stars.  The only difference we made was to substitute tilapia for the sole because the store didn't have any fresh sole that day.  I can see the potential with the quinoa and fish, but I just don't know what I would add to give it flavor.  I won't be trying this again.

We felt that this needed some more flavor--perhaps some onion or onion powder in the filling, and more Parmesan.  Nevertheless, it was a decent fish dish, and certainly healthy.  I was unable to get sole and used cod.

Excellant - however, I combined the quinoa with the toasted almonds from the almond sole fillets. And stuffed the fillets. Worked out great! Will do it again.

This was a really fast and easy dish, I couldn't believe how quick it was!  The sole we had was a little too fishy (not an issue with the recipe of course), otherwise all of the flavors were great with it and helped tone down the fishy-ness.  I love vinegar, so I'll add more next time.

Prepared as described and had a few issues. First, had to change oven to bake to generate heat from underneath to get fish cooked thoroughly. Second, it was a bit bland. If I make this again I will add fresh oregeno and lemon juice to the stuffing. I do appreciate how healthy this recipe is and think it is worth experimenting with.

My husband and I enjoyed this.  I added baby spinach (just layed it overtop of the filling prior to folding the fish over).  I sprinkled black pepper and a bit of sea salt over the fillets prior to filling.  I added a couple of slices of orange sweet pepper to the top as well prior to broiling.  I used chicken stock to cook the quinoa.  Lots of flavor (surprisingly as other reviewers complained of a lack of flavor).  Yum.

I was worried this would be a little bland do to the low fat content, but it was surprisingly tasty.  It was really quick and easy, too!  I liked how versatile it is as well, you could toss anything you like into the quinoa stuffing.  I will definitely try this one again.

Sole needs more flavor and the herbs and lemon don’t give it enough oomph. Quinoa is clever and I’ll try using it in other recipes. It also took much longer to bake. It depends on the size of the fish, eh?

I prepared tonight. IT was a flop. I used fresh herbs from my garden but frozen sole fillets. I would never make again.

The whole family liked it, which is saying alot.  I did flip the fish after 3 minutes and cooked it for a few more minutes on the other side, it was perfectly done after that.
