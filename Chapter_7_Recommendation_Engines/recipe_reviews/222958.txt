Pretty good! Next time I am going to add crab meat, I think that would make it a 5 star dish. And as a main course you might want 2 caps per person.

This was a huge hit. Had to bake it because I didn't have a grill, but it turned out great. And so quick. First time working with portobellos, but it won't be the last.

I would only add 1/4 cup sauce because it is way too salty with 1/2 cup. Not the best of flavours. I will not be making these again.

I served this as an appetizer. A big hit. I learned though that for ideal melting the first topping should be to spread the cream cheese, followed by tomato, topped by the Parmesan.

Great! I added some fresh mozzarella chunks and topped it off with some toasted panko crumbs. Yum!

I skipped the green onions and added some mozzarella cheese to the ingredients and it turned out great. I also used the stuffing combo to stuff red and green peppers as well as an alternative for picky eaters!
