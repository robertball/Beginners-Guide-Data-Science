We use a recipe similar to this except we use the braunscheiger, a half package of onion soup mix and mix it together.  Then for the frosting I use the cream cheese and some Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  YUMMY

We really love Braunschweiger but we felt the chili sauce over powered the taste.  Next time I will omit the chili sauce completely.  Maybe add a small amount of Worchester or something.  I also did not make it into a ball.  I used a glass pie plate, put the Brauschweiger in first and then the cheese mayo mixture.  You could line a pan with plastic wrap, put the cheese mayo mixture in first, then add the Brauschweiger and invert it and it would be beautiful.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and it presents nicely and was accepted in a like manner. Additions I made were to add a teaspoon white pepper, use tomato sauce rather than chili sauce. Then, after removing from the food processor, folded into the mixture firmly but thoroughly 1/4 cup finely chopped pistachios and three tablespoons capers. Delicious! Even my 12 year old granddaughter couldn't get enough! Thank you, Michael, for sharing something new and very tasty.

I made this for Christmas Eve and my family loved it. My sister had to have the recipe! Very easy although I did not make it into a ball.I put it in a shallow dish and then frosted it. I also left off the olives. Next time I'll try them.

I forgot to add the green olive decor...and folks at the party thought it was a bean dip loaf with frosting! The chili sauce, horseradish and Tabasco give this spread an interesting and mildly sweet-hot taste....a big hit with braunschweiger fans for sure!

Delicious! Made this for our Halloween party and it went over VERY well. The kids thought it looked like an eyeball monster, so it was perfect for the holiday. Great combo of flavors. Made just as written...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
