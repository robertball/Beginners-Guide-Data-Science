Oh my, this was great! I left out the jalapeno because my 8 yr old was eating it too. I used white beans instead of black. And for the Ranch mix for the topping I used Fiesta Ranch mix. Usually chili is better the next day, this was GREAT the first day. My husband's first bite: "WOW! This is great!"

This is a great chili recipe.  I had never used pinto beans in chili before, only kidney beans.  I will definitely always use pintos in the future!  I did add about a cup more water at the end because we like more "juice" to soak up the crackers, but the flavor and ease of this recipe was excellent, especially for a weeknight meal.

I made this for my husband during the winter months and he thought it was the best chili he has ever tasted!  Thanks for the recipe!
