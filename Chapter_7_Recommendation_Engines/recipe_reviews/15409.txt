I love this receipe and play with it each time I make it. My suggestions: (1)Timing is everything so I have all sauce ingredients pre-measured in small dishs ready to go. (2) Use more heavy cream in the sauce. Don't think you can use too much. (3) Use very fresh chives. (4) I prefer to finish the fish on the grill, versus the broiler. To do so, this is a 2 person receipe, so the fish and sauce finish at about the same time. (5) I'm partial to Jasmine rice on dishes with great sauces and it works well here. Just be sure to add some other vegetables for serving "color" to balance the appearance of the plate. Finally, don't worry about fat and calories. I do a long workout the next day everytime I make this!

I used fat free half and half because I had a little left in the fridge that I didn't want to go to waste. Delicious!!! Looking over the recipe I was a little intimidated, but it really was pretty easy. What I did to make it easier for myself was to separate out the ingredients. In one section were the ingredients to make the sauce, then in another section were the ingredients to finish the sauce, and in the last section were the ingredients to bread/crust the fish. Working through the recipe in sections like this made it way easier... Also, before turning any stoves or broilers on, or even before taking anything out of the fridge - mince your almonds and shallots. Oh, and follow the part where it says only one or two minutes in the broiler.. I left mine in longer and burned some of the breading. :(

To be honest, I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about when I read this recipe - it seemed pretty bland. Well, I made it tonight and my husband and I could not believe how incredible it was. I used Chilean Sea Bass and served it with rice pilaf and steamed cauliflower. Next time, I will double the sauce to serve over top of the vegetables although that will send the caloric content of this one over the top. But it will be worth it! DO TRY THIS!

Wow.  YUMMY recipe!  I'm glad I read the other reviews, simply to know to double the sauce and to have all the ingredients prepped (it helps, IMMENSELY).  I also changed the recipe a tad to make it more "diet friendly" by using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, used only the egg white for brushing the halibut and I substitued Brummel and Brown spread for the butter (I also cut the 10T down to 5T for the sauce). While I don't know what the original recipe tastes like, my husband, daughter and I all loved this with the exchanges!  PS it's also EXCELLENT when prepared with chicken if you're not a big fish eater....  Bon Apetit!

Presentation is nicer than this actually tastes.  Was very easy to make. Toughest part was spooning the almond mixture on top; and that wasn't a big deal at all.  It took an hour and 10 minutes; start to finish. I will make again. However, will definitely use half the shallots, 1/2 the vinegar and 1/2 of the butter. The shallots were overwhelming, the sauce had sour undertones from the vinegar and I really don't think all 10 TBSPS butter was necessary, either.
Will BRUSH ON the oil/butter mixture and BROIL the fish (to save cleaning another pan) without the crumb topping, and use the same pan to finish, with the crumb topping. I think this is worth trying again.

Incredible! As per other's advice, I used Tilapia instead of Halibut ($6.99 per pound versus $16.99 per pound for the Halibut)and saved a bunch without sacraficing any taste.  Watch out - the sauce is incredibly time consuming, but well worth it in the end.  You'll probably need an extra pair of hands (like your hubby) to pull this one off.  I served this over white rice from the rice cooker and balsamic asparagus.  Give 30 minutes to make the sauce, counting on starting the fish with your "extra hands" after about 25 minutes.  Definitely keep the sauce in a bowl surrounded by hot water - this trick really worked.  DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE!!!!  You'll regret it if you don't - the recipe doesn't make much and you'll especially want more if you serve with rice.  I made this for 5 people, doubled the sauce, and used it all.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

FIVE STAR RECIPE, IT DID NOT TAKE THAT LONG TO PREPARE EITHER,  I THINK THE KEY IS TO HAVE ALL OF THE INGREDINENTS READY TO GO, BEFORE YOU START COOKING.  MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED THIS..

Fantastic flavors. To lighten the sauce I added only 4 tbls of butter. Next time I will add less shallots (maybe 1 tbls) to help lighten the onion flavor since using less butter made the flavor very pronounced. We still liked it, but some people might find it overwhelming. I think I will add a little more cream as well to help extend the sauce. I happened to have some chive cider vinegar that I used in place of chopped chives. I left out the lemon juice since some other reviewers had mentioned it was tangy enough without it and I agree with them. I don't think the sauce needed it. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I just used the minced almonds and egg for the topping. This worked fine. I really liked how the topping hardened and helped keep the fish moist while it broiled. It took about 7 minutes for my topping to brown and I had been concerned that my fish would be overdone. Not to worry the topping did the trick. The fish was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a delicious recipe. My mom,who normally frowns at whine sauces, loved the sauce and my dad who questions anything that isn't BBQ said it tasted great. Also was not difficult to make, although there are several steps. This is a keeper. (Mom also said it can be our weekly fish dish!)

My husband made this for dinner the other night and it was delicious. I am not usually fond of fish but ended up having second helpings and our 3 year old wolfed also it down. I don't know how much work it was because I was kicked out of the kitchen while the "chef" was at work but it was worth the effort. (He said it took about 45-50 mins to prepare which isn't too bad) Halibut isn't an inexpensive fish but it's worth going to the trouble of obtaining it if you can because the combination of this fish and the other flavours in this recipe was wonderful. We're fortunate that we can get wild Alaskan halibut locally and have already bought more just so we can make this again!

The closest thing to 'gourmet' that I have ever made!  It looked and tasted like fine restaurant quality!  I took advice of others into consideration tho:  1) Didn't know Halibut was so expensive...got 2 fillets for $19.95 (about a lb which was plenty for a romantic meal for you and your spouse) 2) Still made the full recipe for sauce so we would have enough...it was perfect for 2 people, 3) The sauce takes the longest about 30 mins, and you use alot of bowls/utinsels for this recipe..so have all that out, prep food & cut, sliced, chop first, and have an empty dishwasher, 4) used a fine strainer cuz I didn't have a seive, and 5) don't tell any health concious person how you made the sauce!!  I served with a simple orzo recipe from this site and made that while making the sauce...excellent meal, but next time I'll go lighter with a side and have a salad. Get a babysitter, candles, and a a nice white wine with this and enjoy your night!

When I got to my Seafood place the Halibut looked a little dry, so I got Chillean Sea Bass and it came out awesome. The sauce does take a while and uses alot of bowels and pans. I didn't have a sieve and used a fine strainer.

Successfully substituted tilapia --- ask for the thickest ones they have.  Made the time consuming sauce ahead and reheated in a double boiler.  Like others, I doubled the sauce.  Served for a dinner party of 8 and they're still raving. Not an "everyday dish," but a starred entry for special occasions!  Recommended!!

EXCELLENT! DYNAMITE! A REAL KEEPER!! especially if you are on alow carb diet this is to die for, just eliminate the breadcrumbs, (though after your on the carb diet for awhile you can have the breadcrumbs!) I thought this was very easy to make and was surprised to find halibut fillets, living in kansas city you always see halibut steaks, the fillets are the BEST!!! Thank you so  much !

I've tried numerous recipes that i've found on line and this is the first one that I felt compelled to review! Doubled the sauce recipe to four while only making two filets based on others reviews. Ended up with plenty of sauce. I followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with results. Kept the sauce warm as indicated but also reheated for 30 seconds in microwave before serving. I was attempting to duplicate a favorite dish of mine from one of my favorite restaurants and this was as good if not better. Served with Roasted new potatoes and Thyme green beans with almonds, both recipes found on this site. This is a keeper!

This turned out absolutely fabulous!  The sauce was not quite as thick as I would have liked, but other than that, it was great.  Outstanding flavor.  Even my husband raved about it!

I have tried many wonderful recipes from this site with excellent results. In fact a good number of them have made it into regular circulation around my house. But this recipe is the first that I felt I had to review.

 I hate fish ... I mean I really HATE fish. My husband on the other hand is always asking me to make fish. So with company here for the holidays I decided to try 2 fish recipes from the site. The Broiled Tilapia Parmesan recipe and this one... based mostly on their high ratings and overwhelming positive reviews. I really enjoyed the Tilapia recipe ( altho I used Basa not tilapia) but I LOVED this one. I now have 2 fish recipes I will make again. 

The only change I made to this recipe was I doubled the sauce as suggested ... it was unbelievably good but I did have some leftovers not a lot tho so I will probably continue to double it. It was a big hit and compliments the fish wonderfully. Making the sauce was the most time consuming part of this recipe but worth the effort and it wasn't as unforgiving as I feared at the start. It reheated well in the microwave (not to boiling) so you can make this a bit ahead of time rather than trying to keep it warm ... then do your fish. I also did not use halibut but instead opted for Basa a fairly firm very mild white fish. No fishy flavour at all just delicate lovely flakes. Bottom line is that this is a very good recipe .. gourmet even .. try it.

I made this for my boyfriend the first time I cooked for him, and now he's convinced I'm a master chef.  Perfect flavoring and it makes for a very impressive presentation.  I reduced the sauce a bit more than what it called for.  Next time, I'm going to substitute the heavy cream with evaporated milk and cornstarch to cut out the fat, which has proven to be a great alternative in my experience.  I'll definitely be making this again for him when I need an extra special favor ;-)

I made this last night for guests and it was very good. I thought the sauce had a strong vinegar taste.  Maybe I put too much in.  I also agree that you don't need all that butter I tasted the sauce after each tablespoon added and adding more butter was not improving the taste.  I also doubled the sauce as others suggested and ended up with a lot left over.  I don't think you need to add that much sauce to the halibut it drowns out the delicate halibut taste.  I refrigerated the leftover sauce and reheated it with some extra halibut and it was still very good.  If I make this again,  I'll make the sauce in advance which would really speed things up in the kitchen if I have guests

This recipe was very good, but called for way too much butter.  I only put 5 tablespoons of butter in the sauce, and it came out fine.  I did feel the sauce was in desperate need of a little salt.  The thyme and bay leaf didn't wow me, so I added a little tarragon which I thought improved the sauce quite a bit.  I don't know if this dish was really worth all the work, but thanks for the post.

A complicated recipe with a lot of special ingredients, but definitely gourmet and very delicious.  Good for a planned small dinner party, not something you'd cook up with what you have in the kitchen on a weeknight after work.  I've made it with frozen halibut (very good) & with fresh salmon (EXCELLENT).

This was ok.  It was a lot of work for just an average meal.  There was nothing bad about it, we just were not overly impressed.  Really could not taste the almonds after adding the sauce, which is the part we were looking forward to.

I prepared this today for 7 (5 adults, 2 teenagers.)  I served this with rice pilaf, steamed broccoli (and dinner rolls).  The buerre blanc is easily prepared the day before. I reheated it in a double boiler on low until serving time.  I fried the fish hours before my guests were to arrive, let cool, topped it, and refrigerated covered until I was ready.  I doubled the sauce, used 16 pats of butter (only this once), and used the whole 8-oz container of heavy cream (instead of 2/3 cup).  For seven servings, this was perfect.  I used tilapia which is thinner than one inch so I fried them for a shorter amount of time.  The results, the same as (most) all the other reviewers.  They raved.  Fresh chives and thyme are a must.  The green vegetable balances the plate with color.  Spoon the sauce around the fish as the recipe states because the topping looks wonderful.  This is a fine, restaurant-quality meal that any host(ess) will be proud to serve, as I was.  Thank you for this keeper.

I was a little intimidated by this recipe, so before I started, I had all the rest of my dinner ready to go, all of the ingredients for this recipe pre measured and chopped, lined up in little dishes, all of the utensils I would need were out on the counter and ready, and I read through the directions several times.  Once I started, it all went together as smooth as silk and the dish was a big hit.  I will definitely make this again, especially when I want to impress.

Just like a symphony, this dish contains both delicate and powerful elements meshing in pure harmony.  The sauce is obviously the key, so you might want to increase sauce-related measurements slightly.  Also the broiler browns the crumbs very quickly so be sure not to allow them to overcook as an overly dark crust ruins this otherwise gorgeous presentation.

Very yummy but not enough sauce.  I think I'll try and work with the beurre blanc to see if I can make more of it without so much butter.  It was soooo good but I felt guilty eating it!!!Worth the effort.

This recipe was Fantastic!!  I love shallots so I kept them in the sauce, it gave it a lovely texture.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it is a keeper!  We just came back from a Halibut fishing trip so I am trying a bunch of halibut recipes, this is the best so far!!!!!

Delicious!  I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, and he raved!  I recommend reducing the amount of lemon in the sauce, it was a little tart (and I like lemon).  Otherwise, perfect served with wild rice & roasted asparagus.  I didn't think it was overly time consuming, or difficult.

I'd like to add my name as one more fan of this terrific recipe. I used creme fraiche in the sauce; it was creamy and delicious. It's not a recipe you want to start at the last minute (when everyone's starving) because it takes awhile to get things in place and the sauce prepared. But it's well worth the effort.

I'm sorry, but I was so disappoimted by the recipe.  The sauce wasn't good at all.  The fish was okay with the bread crumbs and the almonds, but people were saying such good things about the sauce, and I just didn't think it was any good.

Delicious!! I used Tilapia like many other reviewers and I did make a few minor changes to the sauce. I added 1/2c. of fat free evaporated milk and 1/2 tbsp. cornstarch instead of the cream. I did add a little bit of minced garlic to the sauce at the end too.  It was a really nice flavor without all the fat. My whole family loved this( including 8 and 10 year olds!!) Thanks for a great recipe...I will make it again.

We cook and try new recipes alot, and while this is labor intensive, it is very good.  The sauce is excellent, don't overcook your fish!  Sustituted items I didn't have like garlic & onions for shallots, 1/2 & 1/2 for heavy cream, skipped the bread crumbs and just used the crushed almonds.

WOW! This was EASY to prepare and tasted great! I gave up looking for halibut, and used frozen Cod fillets, which I had on hand - I think ANY fish will work here! The buerre blanc (I used 8 T salted butter) was absolutely the secret! My husband said I needed to quadruple the buerre blanc so he'd have enough to cover his rice! Good suggestion! Next time I will make more sauce and try a different fish! Thank YOU Susan! One of my favorites from this site!  PS: Due to wheat allergy, I substituted ENER-G Rice bread for bread crumbs.

Fantastic!   I also prepped all the ingredients for the sauce in advance, and it went together quickly and easily.  I used tilapia instead of halibut, and used a food processor for the scallions and almond/breadcrumb topping.  It was quick, delicious, and impressive.

My children loved this recipe! This did take a little more time to prepare, but like everyone else said, it was worth it. This is a nice switch to something that tastes wonderful since I am on a low carb diet. All I did to make this low carb was to use crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Amazing..a ton of pots and pans, but well worth it! I used only 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and I used tilapia. The only step I'd say to take out was putting the creme in a dish of hot water--I just heated it up in the microwave before serving. Best fish recipe!

Family loved this, despite the high cost of the halibut!  I felt the sauce was a bit tangy even though I didnt even add the lemon juice. I think next time I would try with balsamic vinegar instead of cider. Definately double or 1 and 1/2 the sauce though as it doesnt make as much as I thought.

I expected this to be a lot harder than it really was, but it wasn't that bad at all.  It keeps you busy though!  I took the advice of others and made sure all the ingredients were layed out ahead of time in order and ready to go.  The end product was spectacular!!  My husband said it was comparable to any fancy restaurant we'd ever been to!  This will definitely become a staple in our house.  Oh yeah and I substitued macadamia's instead of almonds which I don't really care for.  I thought it was better this way, but I'm sure it's just personal preference.

RATING THE SAUCE ONLY - as I nabbed it to compliment my chicken breasts topped with shrimp.  :-)  I'm not a big fish eater, but I do like shellfish.  Anyway, I'm giving the sauce a 5 star rating, though next time I will further reduce the amount of lemon (I doubled the recipie but NOT the lemon) and will go even less next time, because the lemon makes it a little too "bright" for my taste.  However, that said...as is, I would serve this sauce to company. It is marvelous and not at all hard to make.  Time consuming...not particularly, not if you are multi tasking.  Thanks!

the sauce takes alot of work as others mentioned, but it's worth it!  my husband and i have made this more than once and it gets easier every time.  once we substituted the halibut w/ orange roughy... not as great. i really think the sauce compliments the halibut extremely well.  we love to eat it over rice and drizzle the sauce all around and sop up the extra sauce w/ fresh, warm dinner rolls.  i give this recipe 4 stars only because of the high fat content, but all in all, this is one of the best recipes i've gotten from this site!  thank you!

I agree with some previous reviewers in that it was a lot of effort for an okay meal.  It was a bit rich for me.  I prefer to just blacken the halibut with cajun seasoning and grill it.  It's faster, healthier, and tastes great.

I really liked this recipe, but my husband (who is fish sensitive) did not so much.  I think any fishy taste he tasted was the store's fault where I bought it. I would make the recipe again, for myself.

Another rave review from my husband.  He really enjoyed the recipe.  Definatley a do-over.  Even my 2 year old daughter enjoyed this one.  My four year old son had a great time helping me make this.  He was great at measuring and cutting up the butter, which I thought there was slightly too much of.  Next time I think I will make in stages as suggested for a dinner party.

Another great fish recipe to add to my collection!  I used frozen Tilapia filets (from Sam's Club) which I, of course, thawed first.  They weren't very thick but they worked out just fine.  The only mishap I had was that, after being sauted, the fish was so tender and wanted to fall apart.  So, I gently scooped them out of the pan and put them on my baking stone.  Each piece right next to the other.  This made it easy to add the almond mixture.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I did substitute Tilapia for the Halibut because I had Tilapia on hand.  I also omitted the lemon because I don't care for lemon with my fish.  And I doubled the sauce recipe but I ended up having quite a bit of sauce left over.  The sauce was awesome and needs a strong flavor to balance the dish.  The fish adds the crunch and the texture but there isn't much flavor without the sauce, especially if you use a very mild tasting fish like I did.  My husband and 10 year old daughter loved it and would like to thank you.  I insist on making them eat fish and they are continually surprised about how much they are enjoying it.  I even had enough left over for my lunch the next day.  I couldn't believe how fabulous it still tasted even after being reheated in the microwave.  Thanks for sharing!

I fish regurally and often bring in Halibut.  Because of the frequency of consumption of this fish, I have become bored of the traditional preparations and usually just give it away.  However, I tried this recipe some time ago and the resulting dish was excellent.  I'm only 19, and a guy, and because I've never before attempted cooking anything I thought the recipe would be difficult, but I was rather surprised at the ease.  I caught another fat Halibut and am preparing this dish once again for some ladies.

This is an awesome recipe!  I would definitely double the sauce but cut the butter down just a bit.  I also sprinkled a little bit of sea salt on the halibut as they were sauted - I can't tell you what a difference that made!  It really brought the flavor out in the fish.  The prep time does take a bit longer than I expected, but as previous reviews have said, it's much easier if you have all of the ingredients prepped.  This is something that is relatively simple to make but looks and tastes like it was prepared by a professional chef!!

As others said, this was yummy!  Two changes based on ingredient availability. I did not have bay leaf so I chose to add a bit of oregano. I didn't strain other than removing what was left of the thyme...seems like you could play around with the seasonings if you had to and still come out with a very delicious dish! Thanks Susan....will use often!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated with no changes.  Very elegant and rich in flavor.   My very picky husband (who travels quite a bit for work, and has eaten in many great restuarants) absolutely loved it, and I can assure you, that speaks volumes!

This was absolutely the best gourmet dinner i have ever made. I have never received THAT many compliments and praise from one meal. I am by no means an expert so this is coming from personal opinion. I did not sieve the sauce. I just removed the bay leafs and left the shallots in there. For one I didn't have one and two didnt see personally why i would take out the shallots? So if you want to skip that step feel free because this recipe is TOP NOTCH! Agree with other posters. Prepare everything in advance. I put every step in separate bowls and it helped big time! Add rice and DOUBLE the sauce!

My first beurre blanc attempt and I was VERY pleased with the result. The instructions are right on and I didn't screw up the consistency! I did have to substitute white wine for ginger ale for a family member who cannot have alcohol for health reasons. I researched it and ginger ale is a good sub for white wine if you can't find the alcohol free at the stores. 
The breading around the halibut was awesome and my family was really impressed with how it turned out. I don't even care for fish but I gobbled this dish up!!

I haven't yet eaten this recipe exactly as it's written, as I wanted something healthier and made it without any butter, but even the healthier version tasted great - it was rich and you felt like you were eating something decadent even though it was healthy.  I substituted a little olive oil in place of the butter, and instead of heavy cream I used fat free half and half.  I used a combination of almonds and corn flakes in place of the bread crumbs.  I liked the way the flavor of the sauce blended with that of the fish.  The crunchy coating on top of the fish was also delicious.

This recipe is great as is! My only advise would be to chop up everything BEFORE you start cooking the sauce as everything comes together quite quickly. I put almond slices in the food processor instead of mincing them by hand. Found the halibut at my local fisherman's market so it was very fresh. Served with Jasmine rice and steamed asparagus. This is definitely a KEEPER recipe!!

I have to admit this was really delicious. Although the ingredients are pricey and the preparation of mincing almonds took awhile. I also substituted the fish with Tilapia. Also I didn't bother straining the sauce I just spooned it onto the fish. Be careful the fish is very delicate and will tear apart when transferring to the other pan.

It might be the fact that this was on the top 10 list of 'best recipes' on this site, but I was pretty disappointed and so were my friends.
I'm further disappointed that nobody in town had halibut except the local Fresh market which charge 18 dollars a pound - it cost me about 70 dollars total to buy everything to make this dish for four people.
The sauce did get a lot of positive comments, but considering how LONG it too to make, how many dishes and counters I got dirty making it, and how LITTLE the recipes actually yields in the end, I would suggest doubling the sauce recipe, at least.  If you end up with leftovers, oh well - the sauce isn't expensive.
The halibut itself - I don't know.  I just wasn't impressed with the texture.  I think I could have let it sear a bit longer in the pan and cook less in the oven.

We decided to splurge on our diets and try this.  It was good artery clogging, 45 grams of fat meal.  I would like to try and make it with fat free half and half next time.

This recipe was fantastic! I did not have thyme or a bay leaf so I used some leftover cilantro. I think next time I will double the sauce b/c we liked it so much. My husband felt like he was eating at a fancy restaurant. It also was not as difficult as I expected it to be.

Although I have used a lot of recipes from this site, this is the first time I have been moved to post a review.  This is absolutely the best fish I have ever made.  The little extra time it takes to prepare is well-worth the effort.  My sister-in-law wouldn't leave until I gave her the recipe too!

This is by far the best halibut recipe I ever tried. I cooked it twice for guests and everyone loved it. I recommend using 2/3 of the suggested butter amount for the sauce, but brushing the crusted halibut with a little of the melted butter before sticking it under the broiler.

This recipe was wonderful.  I might try using all nuts instead of the breadcrumbs next time for the coating.  Delicious.  We did end up in the emergency room to get a fish bone out of my husband's wind pipe - other than that, no complaints.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I have often read other reviewers list a recipe as "restaurant quality" and have wondered where they've been dining, but this recipe exemplifies that expression.  The only changes I made were to omit the bay leaf (I was out) and to use Chilean Sea Bass instead of the Halibut.  It took a little coordination of effort to have the sauce and fish ready at the same time--try to have all the ingredients prepped before beginning. This was a superb recipe which I will be making again and again!!

Susan thank you. I used swordfish instead of Halibut and it was delicious.  Elegant classy dish and easy to make.   Everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make for more family and friends

Just excellent! I will most certainly make this again. I don’t know if I’d categorize it as “dinner in an instant.” It did take me a little over an hour from start to finish, but I was also making two side dishes. I don't even really like fish all that much and I would make this again in a heartbeat. FYI – I tossed some fresh steamed green beans with the shallots that were strained from the sauce – they, too, were delicious.

The sauce is great! I didn't enjoy the fish with the almonds.  The almonds tasted funny but I adored the sauce, I just scraped off the top.  Next time, I might toast the thinly sliced type almonds with a bit a sugar to caramelize it and see.

I just made this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! Definitely make extra sauce, you need it for sure. My grocery store did not have halibut so I made it with tilapia instead and it still tasted wonderful. Instead of using a broiler, I popped the fish into a 400 degree oven for a few minutes (checking regularly to see when the tops were golden).

THIS WAS SOOOOO YUMMY!

My enitre family loves this recipe, the sauce is really delicous, I have made it both with the sieve and without, it works fine both ways, the easiest way to make the sauce is to measure every thing out in advance and set in small pinch bowls.

Yum!  Could have been served in a restaurant.  I doubled the sauce, but didn't need to.  I also reduced the butter to 6T and used dried thyme (b/c that's what I had).  I dipped the halibut in egg then the almond mixture and baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees rather than pan frying.

This recipe was pretty good, though not spectacular.  I do want to give a heads up.  I tripled the sauce recipe and only used one tablespoon of lemon juice and it was more than enough.  My husband started the fish as I was whisking the butter into the sauce and both of them were finished at the same time.  I would make this again.

Two thumbs up on this one!!  I followed some of the advice given from the reviews to have the ingredients prepared prior to starting - that helped alot.  Accompanied this with a side of strings beans and Chardonnay and it turned out great.  Perfect for a nice occasion.  Awesome recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  I will definitely make this again.

I had to try this recipe with raving reviews.  I also used Tilipia given cost and availability.  I doubled the sauce which we finished it up for 4 adults.  Everyone loved the fish and especially sauce.  Next time I might try with light cream.  When I doubled the recipe I only used 11 T of butter.  This came out fabulously.  It made fish yummy.  My little ones ate the fish without trying the sauce and gobbled it up!  Thanks for sharing and all the wonderful reviews.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe even though I overcooked the fish a bit.  Yes the sauce is fussy, uses a lot of dishes and takes some time to prepare, if you're looking for a recipe for a "special" dinner, it is worth the time and effort.  Next time I will saute the fish for 2 minutes per side, 3 minutes was too long.  And by the way, half and half works just fine for the heavy cream, considering beurre blanc typically doesn't have cream anyway.  I'm also going to try this with other fish varieties.  Thanks!

I made this for my anniversary dinner tonight.  We both thought it was delicious.  I might only use half the amount of vinegar and lemon juice next time as the sauce was a little tart for my husband's taste.  I loved it like it was, though.  I was unable to find fresh halibut so had to use frozen fillets.  They were only about 1/2" -3/4" thick but worked fine.  I also tried this on a couple of tilapia fillets and it was good, but not as good as the halibut.  Thanks for a fancy, memorable dinner recipe!

Susan W, this recipe is divine; thank you to you & your future MIL! I've been wanting to make it for ages and finally got a beautiful halibut filet at Costco today that begged to be used for this! This was absolutely delicious but how could it not be with the butter and cream in it?! Definitely a company-worthy, fine meal.  Served it with "Thyme Green Beans with Almonds" from this site, as well as steamed basmati rice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I thought it tasted good but what doesn't with heavy cream and butter.  I only gave it four stars because I thought it was fussy to make.  Too many dirty dishes.  I also do not like the amount of calories and fat in the recipe.

I used Tilapia instead of Halibut and it was a cheaper but oh so good substitution for this dish. Very yummy and worth the time!

What a fancy, elegant dish! Halibut is such a mild, light fish!  For anyone afraid of "fishy" tasting fish, this is the one for you!! Halibut is costly, so don't be surprised when you see the proce tage, but it is really
great for a special occasion.  Feels like fine restraurant dining at home!   Thanks!

Five Star indeed!  I used Talipia instead of Halibut; however, I believe that the sauce provides the most flavorable part of the dish.  It does take some time to make all at once.  I think you could probably make the sauce ahead of time and reheat it later.  I'll try that next time.  My kitchen and house smelled incredible.

Only change: used homogenized milk instead of cream.  Absolutely delicious!  Takes time to make beurre blanc, plan for lots of time if first time making.  Well worth time and effort.

I have never rated a recipe before but I had to this time. This was the best fish recipe that we have ever come ever had. The sauce was to die for. Followed the recipe except I used regular butter instead of unsalted. It didn't seem to matter. You have to use salt anyway. Thanks for the recipe. This will be are new favorite.

I served this with brown rice and roasted asparagus.  It was a fantastic dinner--this is an amazing recipe!!  I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't eat the fish, but the beurre blanc was out of this world!  My husband couldn't get enough of the fish and the sauce...he said if we weren't already married, this dinner would have gotten me a marriage proposal!!

Definitly need an extra hand for the sauce. Served over a bed of steamed spinach/red pepper and mushroom risotta. This is a great "special occasion" meal!

Really good fish recipe. I am a total beginner when it comes to seafood, but was able to manage. Would save a lot of time to have everything minced/chopped ahead of time for entertaining purposes. I made this for my husband and he really liked it. The sauce was great, but a little bit acidic with the wine/vinegar/ and lemon juice. I cut back on the vinegar, will cut back on the lemon juice as well next time. But I will definatly make this again. I too subbed talapia which cooked up nicely.

This makes a delicious dish.  Halibut was out of season, so I used orange roughy and it was delicious.  This dish has an impressive flavor.  To make it frequently for my family, I'd have to find a way to cut down on the butter (cholesterol, etc).  Thanks.

Wow! What's left to say about this amazing dish? Delicious! A novice cook might be intimidated, but it is really easy. I used Tarragon vinegar because I had no cider vinegar in the house. Do double the sauce, however. Yum! Thanks Susan and to your MIL, too.

EXCELLENT!  Juicey and tender.  I have made this with fillets and with halibut steaks and actually like it better with the steaks.  Takes a bit of work but well worth it!  Best fish dish we have ever had. mmmmmmmm good!

I am incredibly picky when it comes to my fish, but this was heavenly!!!  Everything about it was perfect!
Yes, the beurre blanc was very time-consuming but again - heavenly!
This is not a recipe I will use in my day-to-day cooking, but it will be the first one I whip out for a special occasion!  
The only modification I made was instead of halibut, I used tilapia (only because HyVee didn't have any fresh halibut and they had just received the tilapia an hour before I bought it).
Thank you, Susan W., for sharing my new favorite seafood dish!!!

This is possibly the best recipe I've ever made.  The sauce is amazing.  If you are gonna spend your hard earned dollars on an expensive fish like halibut, this dish makes it worth it.  Have it with a nice white wine and you are all set.  Enjoy!

This fish is so delicious.... everybody liked it, even my 2 yr old. I made it a little different, i did'nt had chives or heavy cream, I used sour cream instead... it turned out great. I also added some pecans to the almond mix and used a little less shallot and lemon juice. And instead of normal bread crumbs I used panko bread crumbs... it still was delicious. A little time consuming, specially when you do side dishes. I served it with broccoli/couliflower and brown basmati rice... added some beans to the rice as well... exquisitee!

Really great recipe.  Try adding a candied pecan cluster for an interesting garnish.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was easy to prepare and everyone loved it.  The key is to do all the prep first as the cooking parts are quite short.

I had read the reviews that said this was too much work, but really boiling it down was simple - i could do that without even watching it... from there you just added the cream and butter.  Simple!  The recipe just looks intense but it's not hard!  I only gave it 4 stars though because I did end up having to add a little salt/pepper to add to the flavor.  I also added a little chicken bullion to give it more "umph" - it did lack a little something.... but it was impressive and really tasty with just a few tweaks.  I served it with steamed broccoli and a chipotle roasted corn salsa.... YUM!

This really is good but not a "quick and easy" recipe. I stuck to the recipe except I did not strain the sauce(didnt need it). It was very tasty but a lot of work for the result. I would suggest going easy on the amount of topping on the fish - I used all of it and it was too much.

I would give this one a higher rating if I could.  WOW, amazing taste!  I cut down on butter and used talapia the second time and it still came out great.  Totally worth the time.  Thank you, Susan.

This was SO delicious. Grocery store didn't have halibut so I substituted tilapia with no detrimental effects. I reduced the butter by almost half (used 6T instead of 10) and the sauce was still fantastic, nice and tangy. Do listen to others and doule the sauce. I just made two fillets for my husband and myself but made enough sauce for six. There was definitely some leftover but I am so glad I didn't go longing for more (very possible if I had made only 2 servings'-worth).

This is truly amazing, but only as long as it's fresh. Just don't refrigerate it: it is one of the best fish recipes out there as long as it's fresh, but once it's stored overnight, it's not good at all. A real shame, but it's not really a problem because there probably won't be any leftovers to save anyway (I made it for more people than I ended up serving).

A symphony indeed! Every bite was heavenly.  Even my kids who were skeptical at first oohed and aahed.  The sauce makes the dish -- I tried not to think about the butter/fat content as it crossed my lips (then went straight to my hips).  I didn't need to double the sauce because I only made three fillets instead of six.

Yummy!!! is the first word that came to mind when I tried it! I had my doubts about this, but it turned out so great, I wanted to eat the beurre blanc on its own. I doubled the sauce recipe and I didn't finish it, but next day I prepared with cooked chicken I had, and made sandwiches....you have no idea how good they came out, you should deffiently try it. Thanks a lot for 2 awsome recipes!!!

Oh my gosh, this was wonderful. I used chopped macadamia nuts instead of almonds. With this substitution this dish was upscale restaurant quality and reminded us of one of our favorite dishes in Hawaii.

Absolutely fantastic! I made this last night for my husband and father-in-law and they are still raving about it. It really is a lot easier to make than it may look at firt. Next time I will double the sauce recipe. Great company dish! Instantly made it into my husbands Top-5 list!

I halved this recipe and it turned out great.  If I'm going to make it for company (and I probably will), I would increase the amount of sauce slightly.  I think doubling would be too much.  It went great with a simple side of steamed asparagus.

This recipe is awesome! My boyfriend and I made it, and now every time we go to the nice seafood restaurants in our city, he complains that no fish is as good as this one! We definitely recomment doubling or even tripling the sauce, because everyone we served this to wanted more of it!

I just made this last night for a Valentines dinner and it was excellent! I used half and half instead of the cream and I cut down on the amount of butter and the sauce was still SO good. Halibut is out of season (I'm in Hawaii) so I used Ono and it was great. I served this over brown rice.

Fantastic! I went to 3 different places looking for halibut, but no one had any on hand, so I ended up substituting with sea bass. I also substituted the White Wine with some White Chardonny. I will be making this one again!

I would give this recipe 10 stars!  Worth the time and is guaranteed to please.  I used grouper instead of halibut and doubled the sauce.  I used tarragon vinegar and fresh tarragon in place of cider vinegar and thyme.  I also used pecans because I didn't have almonds.  Really great recipe.  Thanks!

Everyone loves this-even my son-in-law who does not like fish!  The sauce was the best recipe I've found for beuure-blanc sauce.

I love to make good food, and I don't mind spending the time and money necessary to do it.  I made this recipe exactly, except I couldn't find Halibut the day I needed it.  Instead I subsituted Chilean Sea Bass.  This was probably the best dish I ever made.  My husband and I both agreed that this dish is singularly specatacular.  We will serve this to our next seafood loving guests.

This was very good, but the fish came out a little dry. May have cooked it a little too long with the two step process (sauteeing, then broiling.) The sauce is delicious.

This was fantastic, prepared exactly as written. I made it for guests, without trying it first, and was a bit intimidated. I prepped all the ingredients ahead of time, and it was actually easy. Got great reviews! I will definitely make it again.

This was REALLY good.  I actually think though that it doesn't need the almond topping.  It was a big hit with my husband who isn't even a huge fish fan.

I couldn't find halibut so I used flounder. I also bought some fresh water shrimps because hubby doesn't like fish. I added some garlic to the beurre blanc. I got rave reviews from hubby and in-law (in-law, imagine that!)

This recipe was awesome... however I did make a few changes because my husband is allergic to most nuts. Instead of almonds, I substituted Macadamia Nuts and chopped them in my food processor. My husband who usually will not eat any type of fish ate the whole thing.. He said he would eat it again. This is one of my favorites on the site so far:)

This recipe made me feel like a kitchen superstar! While it looks like it would be difficult, it really wasn't. Plus, I employed my husband as the sous chef so he was prepping as I was working. I was expecting the beurre blanc sauce to separate as I was cooking the fish, but the hot water bowl kept it in a perfect state. There isn't a thing I would change with this recipe. Oh, I did use European style butter (known as plugra) instead of regular butter because it's creamier. I can't wait to have company so I can show off with this one!

This was incredible.  We used Grouper as it is much more common in the Florida panhandle.  Time consuming, and well worth it.  I will make more sauce next time.  YUM!!!

My wife and I tried this recipe last night. We cut the butter portions in half and it still turned out great. Used Blanched Almond Meal/Flour instead of minced almonds. This gives it a little lighter texture. Next time, we might try this recipe with salmon...

One of the best halibut recipes I have tasted.  Love the combination of flavors and tones from the spices.  Just excellent.  I cook the burre blanc in a double boiler and that eliminates the transfer to a bowl step.  Also I double the blanc ingredients.

Well, this is definitely a recipe that can be streamlined. While I loved the flavor, next time I will 1) start the sauce 2) bake the fish ( something cheaper than halibut) 3) make the topping while fish bakes 4) add cream and butter to finish the sauce ( won't bother to strain, just reduce to desired consistency) and 5) set oven to broil, add topping to fish and broil a few minutes to brown. This way, I can make this delicious recipe on weeknights.

This was not very good to me.  The sauce tasted like a stick of butter, and I did not like the fish pan fried then broiled.  Maybe if it were completely broiled, and the sauce had less than half the butter and more cream it would work better.

I made this fish for dinner tonight and the end result was pretty good, but not spectacular I'm afraid. I did make the beurre blanc and as it was my first attempt I didn't really know what to expect. The end result was very tangy with the biggest flavour being vinegar. I think if I were to make this sauce again, I would look for a different recipe. For the fish, I followed the recipe with one exception, I did not brush the fish with egg, there was enough butter/oil left on the fish from frying that nothing else was required. If I were to make this again, I would skip the frying step as it's unnecessary and just ended up causing a few of my filets to fall apart.

My wife and I made this for the second time tonight. One word....awesome. Absolutely one of our favorite dishes to make. If halibut wasn't so expensive these days, we'd probably make it all the time. 

We tend to use more heavy cream than the recipe calls for to make more sauce. The first time, we used the specified amount (1/3 cup) and it didn't make enough sauce. Tonight we used 1 cup and we had a good bit left over. I think next time we'll try using 2/3 cup and see if it's the right amount.

Yum yum yum! The sauce was amazing! Doubled the sauce recipe like others syggested but halved the butter. I could have eaten that alone. Topped with chopped Macadamia nuts instead of almonds. Definitely worth the time.

Overall the taste of this dish was very good. I found it difficult to manage my time correctly to make everything finished cooking at them same time, so my sauce ended up getting cold before I poured it on. I even put it in a bowl of hot water. Next time I start the sauce later.

Yum. I wasn't sure I wanted to try something new but am glad I did.  I used special mayo, soy creamer and crisco instead of cream and butter because I am milk free.  Still turned out good.  Probably not exactly as intended but as close as I could get and I loved it.  Watch the time in the broiler and cut halibut in to serving size portions.  I tried to do a whole filet and that was hard to move around.

This dish is so good!!! It is much easier to prepare then it originally sounds. I made it for a dinner with my sisters and everybody wanted the recipe. I made it again with chicken since my husband doesn't like fish. He thought it was great. Definately double the sauce!

Talk about a truly delicious, company-worthy recipe!  Wow!  Can't say enough about this one.  The only thing I didn't do is the egg brushing.  I used 1.09 pound of halibut and had leftover buerre blanc--which I'll freeze for another meal.  The smell of the wine and vinegar cooking down was a turnoff for my hubby, but when the food went before him, he couldn't stop raving!  All the sauce and topping can be made well ahead of time--the buerre blanc heated ever so slightly in the microwave, and the topping saved in a baggie.  I am so glad I ran into this recipe!

Absolutely amazing recipe!  People freak over this every time I make it.  Definately double the sauce recipe, and be careful with the lemon juice.  I used less than 1/2 called for because I prefer a creamier buttery sauce that is not over powered by the strong flavor of lemon.  I always use Halibut.  I have tried with other fish, and it is never quite the same.  Spend the extra money on the Halibut, light some candles and make this dinner for the love of your life...they will NEVER leave!

WOW! I don't even like seafood and this was AWESOME.  I will double the sauce next time though.  I used 2 8 oz halibut, used dried thyme and I did not strain the sauce.  I also only used 4 T of butter in the sauce.  For the bread crumbs I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 panko.  Only need to broil for a minute and it was perfect.  Next time I will make my sides first as this dish comes together very quickly.

This is a fabulous recipe! It is one of my very favorites on the site. You almost have to make it twice to get the timing down, as others have said.. timing is key! Every time my husband brings home fresh halibut from his fishing ventures, this is on the menu.. absolutely fabulous!

I went to my grocery store and they did not have halibut! So I used tilapia and I dont know if it wouldve made a difference if I would have used halibut.. this recipe was very good..however Im not sure it was good enough for the amt of calories it has. I, like others used fat free half and half in the sauce...and mine never really thickened up ( I dont know if it was supposed to).. plus the butter flavor stood out a lot to me..kinda tasted like melted butter with spice in it.. (which is basically what it is..)..I used 8 tbsp and that seemed like enough to me. However, the crumb/pecan topping was phenomenol.. i just dont know if I can get past that prevelent taste of butter in the sauce..I probably wont be making this again..

This recipe was wonderful! I followed advice from other reviewers and set everything out in advance and did not think it was difficult at all.  I substituted half and half for the cream and crushed macadamia nuts for the almonds.   I made it last night and my husband is still raving about it this morning!

Wow!  This is a great recipe!  I doubled the buerre blanc recipe because it wouldn't be enough for four people as is; I also think half and half will work fine for the sauce because it's quite thick using heavy cream.  I minced the shallots etc. for the buerre blanc and didn't strain it; I like it with some texture and colour. Make sure you watch the fish under the broiler as the topping will burn quickly.  This would go very well with chicken too.

This fish was good, but I would not call it great.  We also did not have enough sauce for it to make an impact on the taste.  Fresh squeezed lemon was a must to give this fish some flavor.  I will not be making this one again.

Pretty good.  I thought the sauce was a little bland.  Next time I will decrease the lemon and add some sage or something else to bring out more flavor.

The sauce was fantastic (although time consuming), but the recipe did not call for enough of it to drown out the taste of the fish.  The sauce was far too light for a heavy, fatty fish such as halibut.  If you plan to use this recipe try a lighter white fish and skip the almond coating, it doesn't blend well with the sauce.

OK, as usual I made double the sauce and followed that precisely.  I didn't have any almonds though for the breading and just used the bread crumbs, butter and egg.  I wasn't that impressed with the topping as it really burned in the broiler and the fish wasn't done because of it so I had to scrape off the topping to finish cooking, however the sauce was out of this world which is why I gave this 4 stars.  Next time I'm going to skip the whole topping process and grill the fish using just the sauce for topping.  Maybe the fact I didn't have almonds had something to do with the results, but my husband isn't a fan of nuts in his food anyhow.
thanks for a great (easy) gourmet sauce!

It seems there are enough ratings on this recipe, but I had to put in my 2 cents worth. I tried this over the weekend and was most impressed with the flavor and simplicity of making it. It was even delicious left over the next day! Only thing I did different was not use the bay leaf and that was only because I didn't have any. Flavor was still supurb. This will be my new "special" dinner.

This is so delicious!  And the beurre blanc recipe is worth saving for other dishes.  Technique is the same as for hollandaise.  This is a YUM, YUM, YUM!

This is a not a recipe for beginners, but it's also not overly complicated.  My boyfriend said it was the best fish he'd ever eaten.  The only problem I had was that the sauce got cold immediately when I added the lemon juice and vinegar, so I had to warm it back up.  Excellent dish.

I'm not a huge fan of fish, but I loved this recipe!  It's quick and not too difficult to make, and rather forgiving if you don't have all of the ingredients.  I'm adding this to my recipe box and will definitely be making it again.

Yes, this did take a little time to prepare, but it was very much worth the results.  My husband and I plan to entertain with this dish, because it is one to impress visually and the palate.  Thnaks for sharing this gem of a recipe.

AMAZING!!!  I don’t like when people make changes and then review the recipes—I’d prefer to make the recipe first as is, rate/review it, as written, THEN make any desired changes. This recipe as is....is fantastic!  And needs no changes.  Elegant, impressive presentation and delicious. Served it with lemon-asparagus risotto and steamed carrots & broccoli. Will make again.  For company. Thanks.

I love this recipe! So yummy. For the crust I substituted panko bread crumbs, added 1/4 cup of fresh Parmesan cheese, and 2 tbsp of fresh chopped parsley. I chopped up sliced oven roasted almonds in my processor and added 1/4 cup of butter to the  mix. The topping was so delicious and the sauce just brought it all together!

This recipe is amazing. It is my Halibut go to. Super simple but restaurant quality.  Do not be afraid to make this.  I have Halibut delivered from Alaska but have also made it from Costco Halibut.  No need to change anything.

Easy and delicious! There are steps to follow, but they are absolutely worth the time. This recipe can be modified depending on your available ingredients. I used marsala wine instead of white, and dried thyme instead of fresh. I used the pan melted butter and oil to mix with the minced almonds and breadcrumbs. If the halibut is fresh and not overcooked, it will be fantastic! Do strain your buerre blanc sauce and keep warm in a small sauce pan, stirring occasionally. This is an absolute winning recipe! Enjoy!

So amazing! If you don’t like modifications to a recipe go ahead and scroll on now. I used corn flakes bread crumbs instead of real bread bread crumbs an also macadamia  nuts instead of almonds. I also doubled the sauce as other recommended. Defiantly made it a breeze to have all items proportioned and ready to use. This made for no stress in the timing of the steps. I think next time i may add a few slivers of cream cheese with the heavy whipping cream! This turned out so so so so amazing.

I have used Allrecipes since it started, and in all my years of cooking, this recipe ranks up there as one of the best I've made!  I rarely make a meal following a recipe as written, but I did so with this one, and I can't think of a single thing I'd change.  Oh, I used Cod instead of Halibut because that's what was available, and my only regret is that I didn't get HUGE portions of this fish because it is so darned good that you want more, and more!  I could literally drink the sauce!  As mentioned in other reviews, do yourself a favor and have every ingredient pre-measured and ready to go so you can create this fabulous dish easier .  Can't wait to serve this to my next guests!

This was delicious! I did double the sauce as others suggested. I also seasoned the fish with garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and a littler paprika. My husband said, "babe, this is a keeper."

I haven't made it with the sauce yet but will definitely try it.  but, I prepared the halibut according to the recipe and it was so delicious.  Served it with rice pilaf and steamed veggies and it was superb.

This was fantastic!  I did exactly as it states.  The only difference (and I do this with all white fish) is to soak it in buttermilk for about 10 minutes first.  Then I rinse and pat dry.  It seems to take the “fish” taste out of it.  My wife, three-year old daughter, and I loved this.  I highly recommend getting all the ingredients out and ready first.  Makes it much easier.

I watched the video and read the recipe  a couple of times before deciding to make it.  
Yes - double the sauce recipe. 
The sauce is the  very best sauce I've ever made.  Finally a recipe that is not laced with garlic.  Garlic can't sometimes over power the flavor. I'm also a lover of capers which this recipe didn't have but I didn't miss them either.
Rich and smooth.   Serve to impress!

Until yesterday, I realized I'd never made halibut myself at home.  I love to order it when I go out, but my husband came  home with a package of fresh halibut from a friend of ours who catches, so I scrambled to this site for a quick recipe to help me out.   This was the first one I came across and it might be the last one I ever look for.    IT WAS SENSATIONAL.   Oddly, I had all the ingredients on hand except the slivered almonds.  I chopped up pistachios instead and it was a fine and flavorful replacement.  Otherwise, I followed this recipe to the letter and it was honestly my favorite halibut dish I've ever had anywhere!!!  THE SAUCE is incredible!!!  Not too heavy and not hard to make at all -- it is divine.   I agree with others to double it because it cooks down so much.  It's slightly hollandaise-like and I may use this sauce again for just those purposes (over eggs benedict or asparagus).    So happy I found this.  It will be happening again and again and is very "company worthy"!

I slightly overlooked the fish and it was still amazing!!!  Best Halibut recipe I’ve had!!  Flavors blend like a symphony!  I would recommend you slightly under cook the fish in the pan.  Fish was perfect until I placed it in the oven.  Other than that it is great for a really involved gourmet meal!!

This recipe is simply excellent! I modified it just a bit by stuffing the halibut fillets with chopped pieces of steamed lobster, shrimp and dover sole before pan frying the fillets. I also added a pinch of dried tarragon to the beurre blanc but otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Everybody I have made this for raves about it and just loves the flavors.

Fabulous! Made exactly as written and it was perfect. Very easy too. Halibut is our favorite fish and we just brought home 80 lbs. that we caught in Alaska.  Used fresh herbs from my herb garden and served with wild rice and fresh asparagus.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Very good! A little time consuming for prep. I was worried it would be too bitter after tasting the sauce before prepping the fish but it went well once mixed on fish. I'll use again many times

I made this without the buerre blanc, as my husband and I are cutting calories for 10 days to shed our winter coat. This was AMAZING even without it! Made it twice in one week! Ready in 20 minutes. Used chilean sea bass instead.  I sprinkled sea salt and a little pepper and sprayed  a little olive oil on the fish and spread with a brush; cooked for 5 minutes on a broiler pan at 400; removed, flipped and basted the fish with a little egg white, then topped with the almond mixture. Put back in oven, cooked for another 10 minutes then broiled for 2 additional minutes to crisp up. Served with haricots verts and that was it. Can't wait to try the buerre blanc, though I don't care too much for butter, but my husband loves it. The recipe takes practically no time and it rivals a meal at a fine restaurant. Thanks for sharing!

This was such a simple recipe, but tasted like a restaurant quality complex fish.  I added a bit of lemon zest and fresh parmesan and it gave the crust a bit more flavor.  
The sauce was also so delicious we served it over our veggies too.  Definitely making this again.

Made this for a family birthday dinner....the recipe wasn't too difficult, and it was truly restaurant quality cuisine.  We got a very high quality halibut from a local seafood shop, so that helped.  Used creme fraiche as someone else suggested, and it was divine.

Served on bed of wild rice, with side of asparagus; made as directed. Really easy preparation, showy but simple. The crunchy  slivered almond topping added crunch without overpowering the sweet natural flavor of our  wild caught Alaskan halibut. I think this is quick and easy  enough for family but upscale and showy enough for entertaining, will definitely make again.

This is so amazing! My sister in law from Alaska brought halibut to Washington state and made itit is to die for....since then we've been to Alaska and brought back over 100 pounds of halibut and when I invite friends or family for dinner, this is their request. I found it easier each time by having all of the ingredients ready in advance....we serve with rice pilaf and a green salad. Doesn't get much better than this recipe!

This was a really delicious main dish! I made it for my father because he loves seafood. I'm only giving it four stars because I enjoyed the sauce and the breading but wasn't huge on the halibut. I will probably make it next time with another type of white fish, Like cod or tilapia. I can't wait to experiment a little. The only change I made this time was I sprinkled on some parsley at the end. Other than that, this was a beautiful dish.

First, the sauce is terrific! It is time consuming, but so well worth the effort. The only change I made was the type of fish. The store where I shop did not have fresh halibut, so I used fresh haddock which worked perfectly. This was a super meal.

I just made this last night! YUM! Even my 14 yr old daughter (who doesn't like fish) LOVED it! The sauce makes the dish. I did some substitutions;
You really can use any mild fish, I used Cape Capensis (I would also use Cod) and I'm not a fan of Thyme, so I used a Rosemary sprig in the sauce.
Plan to spend more than 45 min. on this dish, it is time consuming but worth it!!

My husband just loved this. I kept the recipe the same, however, I would recommend starting the butter sauce when the fish only has a few minutes left to go.

I made this years ago and still crave it and compare restaurant meals to it, just haven't made it since it pairs so well with halibut I like to save that fish for special occasions. I don't think I nailed the sauce exactly texture wise, but it still tasted that amazing.

Even though I prefer Basa or Tillapia over Halibut in this dish it gets a 5 star because it truly makes my family pause and show sheer bliss when they take the first bit.  Also, it is so elegant to serve to guests.  But it has taken me some practice to get it timed just perfectly when served with other elaborate dishes.

This is right out of a french kitchen.  I have made it 4 times now, and the only thing I have to say is don't let it cook to long.  Once it is flaky it is done.  Excellant.  My whole family was impressed.  Not has hard as it looks!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was FANTASTIC.  I love halibut but NEVER cook it at home because I do not like the fish smell.  This recipe has so many wonderful flavors that the aromatics of it cooking far overpowered any fish smell.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked half the portion of fish as I did not want left overs.  The sauce is decadent, the fish was cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend said this was the best home cooked meal he ever had and that it was a gourmet meal.  VERY VERY good.  Next time I might try basil instead of thyme as I love basil.

I adore this recipe.  I have made it several times and just love it.  I can even get my kids to eat it, and that's a big deal.  I suggest making sure you have fresh herbs for this.  Oh, and the sauce is so good, I could bathe in it!

I found this to be very good. I tried this on a whim today. I went to my local fish market, and they did not have halibut. So, instead I went with tilapia. I just lessened the cooking time by a minute or so. The sauce was so tasty, but beware of using too much lemon.Yum!

I really liked this recipe. My husband thought it was good, but not his favorite. I don't think I will make it again just because I can never find halibut and I finally did for $16.99 on sale! I really don't think it is worth the cost. But otherwise, great recipe!

As much as I love fish, I thought I couldn't go wrong with a recipe so well-reviewed, but unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  I won't be making this again.  The taste was just bland with a lot of buttery sauce.  Not for me!

I was looking for an elegant dinner to serve for guests and this was it! 5 stars is an understatement.  I did leave the thyme leaves in the sauce along with the shallots rather than drain them and doubled the sauce too.  My  mother, who doesn't care for fish, loved this recipe.  I served this with Daddy's Fried Corn and Onions from this site to give the plate a little color. I will make this again for sure.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  With all the rave reviews I thought it would be delicious but it wasn't.  My husband felt the sauce was too heavy in his stomach and neither one of us liked the taste of the sauce.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This was simply delicious.  I added extra cream to the sauce so that there was plenty to drizzle over the halibut.  The flavor was amazing and the almonds were such a nice touch.

the end product was fab.  however, having never made a buerre blanc i could have used a little more detail.  i prepped my ingredients as suggested.  and i, like a reviewer below, used brummel butter as well as half & half.  i also increased the almonds & lessened the breadcrumbs.  oh, but it took waaaay longer than the times listed.  the buerre blanc seemed to take forever(hence the four star rating).  still, i will make it again cuz the taste was absolutely fabulous!

I served this for company and everyone raved about it, but I thought the sauce was quite bland.  The halibut tasted wonderful but the recipe had no effect on the fish flavor. I thought the almond topping was good, but I've had a pecan topping on salmon that was way better and easier (I will never blanch and mine nuts again).  We had plenty of sauce for the 4 of us and I followed the recipe as stated.  I doubt that I'll make this again due to the time it takes and the end product.

It was awesome.  I couldn't get fillets so I used 6 oz chunks and browned them longer than 2-3 mins.  Even my fish hating sister like it :)

Wow!  Just an excellent dish.  The sauce definitely takes a little bit of time, but it is well worth it.  If  you like fish, you have to try this one.

I made this recipe for 2 people and doubled the sauce. I followed the recipe exactly and for me, the sauce was a bit too sour/acidic. I would cut down on the lemon in the sauce. I think the breadcrumbs could use a bit of seasoning before being mixed with the almonds. I think a little bit of garlic powder and more herbs would suffice.
