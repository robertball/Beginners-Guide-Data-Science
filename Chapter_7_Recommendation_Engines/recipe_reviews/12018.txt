This was delicious! The only ingredient adjusting I did was, instead of using beef I used three GardenBurger Flame Grilled Patties (My husband & I are vegetarian). The directions forgot to tell you to add the garlic, so I added it when I went to simmer everything. I layered it like I would lasagna. Noodles, sauce, cheese. Noodles, sauce, cheese. I will definitely make this again!

Overall, this is a good dish. I did not feel that it was saucy enough so I added a can of tomato sauce in addition to the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. The sauce by itself would make great spaghetti sauce. I would recommend not to over cook the noodles. They do the best if slightly undercooked.

I love this recipe.  The only things that I do different are using a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes and tomato paste.  I also use white onion instead of green in the cream cheese/sour cream mixture and add italian seasoning to it.  I have also topped it with cheddar cheese.  Lots of stuff you can do with it and it's all yummy!!!

This was a very good recipe. I loved the seasonings used in the meat sauce. The white sauce that went on top of the meat sauce was wonderful and decadent. I made home made egg noodles. This did not add to the recipe as I hoped it would. Save yourself some time and buy the packaged noodles. Next time I think Iwill double the white sauce and mix half of it with the noodles...then layer as directed. Also, as far as the directions go, I always saute and drain my meat before I add my vegetables. This way I don't throw any flavor of the vegetables out with the grease. Also, I used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  Thanks Donna.

This recipe was excellent! I used hot hungarian paprika for the top and in the tomato mixture which gave it a little kick. Instead of making one large 13x9 pan, I made 3 smaller 8x8's. Really yummy!

This just takes too long to make. I can go to McDonalds and eat the meal before this is done. It doesn't taste bad, but for a quick meal...it's too much. It's almost 2.5 hours, due to the prep work, the stewing and the baking...sorry

This was excellent. Thickness of sauce and texture were perfect. I skipped the mushrooms (I don't like them) and substitued Boca vegetarian 'burger' crumbles for the ground beef. Will definately make again!

I used venison, yum!  My family was not big on the cream cheese/sour cream topping, but I thought it was perfect!

My husband loved this. It keeps well for leftovers. It was a little time consuming, but a really yummy comfort food dish.

This was very good, and not too hard.  Tastes a lot like a scrambled lasagna.  I added more grated cheese when I layered it, and simmered the sauce a little longer after reading about the juiciness.  I think I'd rather go ahead a make my lasagna.

We won't make this again.  Good flavor but runny and with a horrid texture, like a great pasta dish put through a blender.  Recipe needs work.

This was soooo good!!  I used my favorite sauce and stirred in artichoke hearts after the sauce was cooked in place of the green peppers.  It was
sweet and tender and just plain yummy....your family will love it...at least my family did...and the leftovers were even better!!

We love this! Be sure to add enough seasoning as the tomato paste and crushed tomatos are bland. The mix of sour cream and cream cheese is great!

I also layered the casserole and topped it off with a light layer of mozzerella/ parmesean cheese mix.  I had some fresh basil from the garden and added that instead of the parsely.  It was great.

Tasty recipe that smelled great while baking.  I omitted the green pepper and didn't think it compromised the taste. I sauteed onion, mushrooms and garlic while browning the ground beef instead of before as directed.  I cut the recipe in half and it was the right size for dinner with some leftovers.  Everyone in my family ate this up, including my 3 year old and 9 month old.  Will make this one again.

This recipe deserves 5-stars. Delicious. I did add some extra pizza sauce to the skillet mix, and then after 40 minutes of baking I pulled it out and added more pizza sauce on top (heart shaped to impress my wife) for the last 5 minutes. Absolutely fantastic recipe. This kind of dish can be modified to your heart's extent. I used Feta cheese instead of Parm, and ground turkey instead of beef. You could add bacon probably also, maybe next time I make it I'll add that. My wife and kids loved it. It does take a bit more prep time than other recipes, but totally worth it!

it was an okay meal, although it overflowed so you may want to use a lager dish to bake it in and i recommend you layer it: 1/2 noodles, 1/2 sauce, cheese, rest of noodles, rest of sauce, it's much better

I've made this recipe a number of times now.  I really like it.  I don't really modify except to omit/change ingredients that I don't have on hand.  The green onions often get omitted.  I will usually add extra garlic and more seasoning to give it a little more flavour although its really good just as is.  
Awesome recipe!  Lots of work but well worth it!
