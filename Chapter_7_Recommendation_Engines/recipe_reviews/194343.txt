The kids loved this one! I didn't change a thing on it, but you could very easily use a graham cracker or vanilla wafer, pre-made crust and turn it into a pie instead of having the filling upside down in this. Would  be good with your favorite nuts, not only the peanuts! I will certainly make this up again...it is very easy and quick! Thanks Kraft!

I liked this, but my family (husband and 2 6 year olds did not), perhaps because I used lower fat cream cheese and lite whipped topping, it seemed to be a less sweet dessert.

it was good, i doubled the recipe and put it on a graham crust.... i didn't put cool whip on top because of ratio, and i decorated the top with the remaining marshmallows, peanuts and chocolate chips.  it wasn't as rich as i was hoping. and it was a bit too sweet. smaller pieces were definitely better. next time i would use chocolate fudge pudding, about 2x the amount of chocolate chips and peanuts and i would add condensed milk instead of regular milk.

This is so easy to make and tastes wonderful. I did not change a thing but thought I'd put almonds next time instead of peanuts. My husband says not to change a thing!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  I printed it out and lost it, so when I was making it I had to go by memory, but it was delicious.  I cut the milk in half and added the whole carton of Cool Whip; otherwise, my attempt came out pretty close to the recipe.  I used chocolate fudge pudding mix and 1\3 less fat cream cheese.  I loved it and so did everybody at work - a great recipe.  I'll be making it again this weekend with my niece.  I think this will become a family favorite.

This is good. I would like a darker chocolate. I might ad some cocoa next time.

Excellent. Next time I'll make it with a Oreo cookie crumb or graham cracker crumb crust though.

I made this a little differently.  I used a pastry crust that I pre-baked.  I then used all the ingredients except for the vanilla wafers.  I didn't freeze it, but just put it in the refrigerator.  I tasted more like a mousse pie.  I think I would melt the chocolate chips and drizzlem them over the top instead of putting them in the pie.

Really, really good.  We did these in cups with a stick for popcicle style and the kids loved it.  So did the adults.  We also made it with sugarfree pudding and whipped cream because of diabetics at the party.  What was great is it makes a bunch so we just kept them in the freezer and snacked on them. Oh, we used oreos as the cookie the second time, way better!

Very great pie, I used a pre made crust, fat free cream cheese, sugar free white chocolate instant pudding mix, fat free whip cream, low fat milk, instead of chocolate chips, I used reeses peanut butter cups chopped up and the marshmallows and also honey roasted peantus was a big hit to even those who don't care for chocolate
