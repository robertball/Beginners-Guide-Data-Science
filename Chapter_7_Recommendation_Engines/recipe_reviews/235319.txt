It's a holiday staple. I use Jameson Irish Whiskey, my favorite. I think the flavor, and certainly the alcohol, loses its kick the more it's kept warm. I will usually add more at the end.

I think one of the kids made it with the brandy once, but I was getting so cranky/flustered with all our 20-somethings in the kitchen that I threw more straight Jameson into my mug. 

I believe they call that 'self-medicating'. Enjoy!

I made this to give away as gifts for the holidays! I sampled it before I bottled it, and it is the perfect blend! I used two bottles of red plus one bottle of white and doubled the ingredients. Seemed to do the trick just fine. My friend had given me a recipe years ago, but gave me pre-packaged mulling spices. This is the first time I’ve made this mulled recipe from scratch. I used 24 cloves and grating the ginger didn’t seem to work well, so I diced it up in little pieces. I used 6 cinnamon sticks. Heated it in the crock pot for two hours. I used a fine mesh strainer to separate the mulling spices before I bottled it all up. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Was very tasty but I put the cloves and ginger in a cheesecloth bag and that seemed to help keep it "neat" looking.

I made this wine in the slow cooker for a winter solstice party.  Everyone enjoyed it.   Several guests asked for the recipe and made it for Christmas.  Easy and festive.

It was good but not as spicy as I would have liked. It may have been due to sub standard spices so I would suggest using high quality spices.

I had no idea that wine could be so fragrant and amazing! I didn't use the cloves, or ginger, and felt that it maybe didn't need the 3rd cinnamon stick, but it was worth trying, and I'm glad I did. I also left the peel on the orange, because I think it looks nicer, and it didn't make it bitter or anything.

I used a sweet pinot noir and would prefer a less sweet wine, but even with the sweetness, it was a very good mulled wine with cheese and crackers for a snack supper with my wife.

This was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly using a very nice and smooth Argentinian merlot.  The only difference was that I didn't have any  brandy, so I used what I had on hand, which was Remy Martin.  Not an economical way to go, but it was amazing!  I also like the idea of trying it with Jameson's.  Anyway, I will make this again.  It's wonderful on these very cold nights in front of the fireplace.

Loved it! Perfect on a cold winter night. I didn’t have any fresh ginger on hand  so I threw in about 1T of crystallized ginger chips. Put slow cooker on high to get it hot quickly. Garnished as pictured. I may make it again tonight!

Did mine on the stovetop and goosed the brandy up to probably 1/2 c (had a bit left in the bottle so I just dumped it in). Perfection on a chilly December night. I'm making this for Xmas eve!

Nice recipe, but it turned out a bit bitter. Next time I will try it with less ginger.
