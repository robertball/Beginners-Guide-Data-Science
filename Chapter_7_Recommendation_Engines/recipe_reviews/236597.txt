I substituted coconut flour in this recipe, and I think that was a mistake. I did not realize how absorbent coconut flour is, and my muffins are like little bread lumps. Perhaps I'll use a mixture of coconut flour and flax meal next time. 
My family is brand new to the world of gluten free foods. My toddler was diagnosed with Celiac's recently, and I'd rather prepare her food from scratch, instead of buying processed, over priced, gluten free snacks in the grocery store. Many of the recipes I'm trying take a little practice, but I'll figure it out. 
Even though the muffins did not turn out as planned, they smell amazing!

I used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Baking Flour, cut the sugar in half (per several reviews) and it was plenty of sugar. Since I didn't have quite the amount of chocolate chips, I used a bit less and will probably cut in half next time, since my gluten free son eats these as part of a breakfast, he did exclaim several times, "these are the best muffins ever!".

Great tasting muffin! When I cooked them for 25 minutes they came out a little burnt so I would suggest cooking them for 20 minutes and keeping a careful eye on them

A nice gluten-free muffin! I found them too sweet with 3/4 cup brown sugar, so I will cut it down to 1/2 cup next time. When I looked at the original recipe,1/4 c. of the brown sugar was originally sprinkled on top with chopped pecans. I will just leave it out. I did substitute 1 cup of a raisin/craisin mix for the chocolate chips. The muffins were moist and delicious and enjoyed by wheat eaters as well as those of us on a gluten-free diet! Thanks for a "keeper"!

I used Turbinado sugar and 3 Tbsp of maple syrup in place of the brown sugar.  Added dried cranberries, pineapple and blueberries. Used avocado oil vs. butter and nutmeg vs. allspice. Came out deliciously fantastic even at high altitude.

My non gluten free coworkers love these muffins.  I have used both regular and chunky applesauce with success.

I used coconut flour and pumpkin spice ( I didn't have all spice on hand) and baked extra 5 minutes. They were delicious.

Good base recipe but too sweet as written â€” I made it a couple of different ways. The most successful had a number of differences:  1) I used whole wheat regular flour; 2) I used coconut oil, not butter; 3) I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup; 4) I used a little over 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips; 5) I added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts; 6) I used about 1-1/4 c rolled oats. I also adjusted leavening/moisture for high altitude (I live at 7000 ft above sea level).

I added a few more chips and a little bit more cinnamon but left the rest the same. Holy cow are these good.

I used Bob Redmill's Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour. These turned out awesome! My son and I are sensitive to gluten but my daughter other two sons and husband are not. When I bake, I do gluten free so we can all enjoy it but it is hard finding recipes that everyone enjoys. These muffins were moist, sugary ( just the right amount) and delicious. The only substitute I made was using ghee instead of butter since my daughter and youngest son have a milk protein allergy. These will go on our favorite list for sure! I'm going to make another batch and try to freeze them so we can have them on hand!

Too much cinnamon and too much brown sugar.  They don't look very attractive either. Also, if you don't have xanthan gum in your gluten-free flour, you'll need to add it.

These muffins came out  AMAZING!!!  Better than my regular muffins! I made this a few times with some small changes and they still came out perfect.  I made them in mini muffin tray, this is how I like to make our muffins most of the time.  Tip: If you try different flours, you might need to add more milk or water to it, as some flours are more absorbent than others.  Once you know the right consistency, you can play around the recipe quite a lot, like add shredded carrots or zucchini,  nuts, or substitute mashed banana for the apple sauce etc.

It was really good for a gluten free muffin. I made half chocolate chip and half blueberry. It is a little on the sweeter side but I thought it was really good this way. I might try it with mashed banana instead of apple sauce next time to switch it up. All and all a great recipe that I will use again. Thank you!

I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup, but these muffins were still VERY sweet.
