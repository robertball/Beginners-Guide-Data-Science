I really liked this recipe. I am an avid tomato salsa recipe maker, but my husband has been asking me why I never use tomatillos. My response was that I've never used tomatillos ever in my life. Well, this was the lucky recipe I chose, and I'm glad I did. It was a great choice. Excellent flavor, and very easy to do. The serrano peppers were small, and after roasting, I couldn't get the skin off without tearing them apart, so I just threw them in the blender with skins on.... didn't notice one bit!! Will definitally make this again!!

I liked it.  I made it with 4 serrano peppers but next time I will add more (like the cook recommended) and leave some seeds in to give it more heat.

This is the Holy Grail of Salsa Verdes.  Be sure to use gloves to cut your peppers.  I learned the hard way!  Ouch.  Recipe definitely worth it though!!!  Best I have ever eaten.

Apart from using a little more garlic, I make this as written, and it is phenomenal. Awesome as a dip, but also REALLY good poured over grilled chicken and/or salmon. I always make a big batch of it because it never lasts long. Thanks!

My father in law is from Mexico and makes the MOST AMAZING green salsa, having said that, I love this recipe. It has great flavor and uses authentic flavors and techniques. I actually didn't use the serrano chiles (all I had were 4 poblano) so my salsa is not hot, but very flavorful instead. Next time I will try using the serranos. I have a hand blender, and I used that to blend it up. If you use a regular blender make sure you clean it very well if you don't want your smoothies to taste like chile!

This is so easy and so delicious! I did add a little cumin, but otherwise followed exactly. Left the seeds in 2 serranos and it gave it a good kick! Thanks for sharing!
