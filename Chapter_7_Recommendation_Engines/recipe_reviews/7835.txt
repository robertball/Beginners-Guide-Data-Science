This was pretty good, although I did make quite a few changes.  I used graham cracker crust. Added 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar, let out the ginger and added 1 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 tablespoon flour and baked in a spring form pan like a regular cheesecake.  I think next time I will try adding an additional package of cream cheese and a little more pumpkin pie spice just to get a little more cheese flavor.  Thanks for the idea!

Delicous!! Better than plain old Pumpkin Pie! The only thing I did different was drizzled caramel syrup over it before I served it, and also topped it with whip cream and crushed ginger cookies! YUMMY!!! Even my kids loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made some changes to this recipe to make it suitable for my husband who is diabetic. I used splenda and added just a touch of vanilla extract. I also baked it in a single deep dish crust instead of 2 regular. It was very good, even our non-diabetic friends enjoyed it. It was very fluffy and light and had a nice smooth consistency. We added a dollop of sugar free cool whip and a few chopped pecans before serving. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Fabulous!  I liked it better than regular pumpkin pie.  I used low fat cream cheese too!  My family seemed disappointed when they heard there was no regular pumpkin pie, but after tasting it they were very impressed!!

This is excellent.  I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, add 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, 3 1/2 Tbsp. flour & 4 Tbsp. milk.  Adding flour gives the cheesecake structure.  Since I prefer my cheesecake a little firmer, this works well and for those with the same preference, you may want to try this.  I served this dessert for Easter and it went over very well with many compliments received.  Good post!

I love cheesecake and pumpkin pie, so I was excited to try this.  It lived up to my expectations, and my whole family enjoyed it as part of our Thanksgiving dinner.  I used pumpkin pie spice, which has the cinnamon, ginger, nutmet, and allspice already in it, which simplified things.  And I made only one deep dish 9" cheesecake instead of two 8" cheesecakes...would rather have a little leftover than two skimpy pies.  I had to bake it a little longer, but it was worth it...delicious and would definitely make again!

Made this one after Thanksgiving to test it out for Christmas.  Love it!  Going to follow the advice this time and put it into one 9" graham cracker crust pan instead of two 8".  This will definately be a family favorite for years to come.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is sooooo easy!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it came out great. It tasted very much like Pumpkin Pie, but with a lighter flavor. Everyone thought it was delish.

i'm following a low carb diet and this is a fantastic recipes if you do the following: cut the recipe in half, use splenda instead of sugar, and bake in a glass dish.  When it's cooled, spoon into a dish with a dollop of whipped cream and you have a dessert (or breakfast) for only about 6 carbs!

I made this twice- once for my roommates (as a test) and another for my boyfriend's family. Everyone who tried it loved it! It didn't taste too pumpkiny whichw as good, although, it did look more pie and not cheesecake (with a dark orange color). Maybe I added too much pumpkin. Either way, it was delicious, and I'll be making this every fall! Thanks!

We loved this cheesecake, pumpkin lovers and haters alike.  Everyone liked it.  I made a couple of modifications based on other reviews.  First, I used crushed gingersnap cookies mixed with a teaspoon of sugar and some butter for the crust.  Second, I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual seasonings(which is essentially the same combo).  I also used two cups of fresh pumpkin puree I had roasted and frozen from Halloween instead of the canned pumpkin.  I only had enough filling for one cheesecake since I used a larger springform pan.  I had to adjust the baking time to 75 minutes due to my modifications.

I think more pumpkin could be added here, as the pumpkin flavor was very very subtle. Good, creamy texture though, everyone loved it. Also, I used canned pumpkin pie filling which includes all the spices so it was super easy!

I was intimidated by the thought of making cheesecake but this recipe is awesome!  It's easy and tasty!  My mother in law is not a pumpkin fan and yet she loves this recipe.  I think it would be a good one to modify too... maybe add blueberry instead of pumpkin.   I haven't tried that yet but it seems like a great base recipe just the same.

This is by far the best pie I have ever made.  I accidentally bought Libby's Pumpkin Pie Filling, instead of the pureed pumpkin, so  I omitted the spices.  I also baked it on a graham cracker crust.  Superb!!!

I'll be making them today for the fifth time.  Everyone loves them.  They're not too sweet and they really do mellow out the pumpkin flavor.  Great topped with whip cream.

It was ok, but I didn't care for the premade crust. It just had a too graham crackery taste. The pie was not creamy, but that could be attributed to something I did.

I also have a diabetic husband, so I used fat-free creamcheese and Ideal sweetener.  I also added 1/2 cup of greek yogurt and baked it in a water bath to reduce cracking because of the low fat.  It was creamy and yummy and the calories are reduced to about  110 per servingg!

SO GOOD! i was a little worried because i didn't like the taste of the batter that much, but once it's baked it's phenomenal!  i used a homemade graham cracker crust which makes all the difference.  YUM! would definitely make again.

MMMMM MMMMMM good! This was extremely easy to make and very delicious! I topped mine with cool whip after it cooled because the filling doesn't "fill" the shell up which is fine because the cool whip made it even better, yum yum!

This chesecake was really really good! My family loved it. I ended up adding more pumpkin, used less sugar so it could be more'cheesecakey' and also used pumkin spice instead of the ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Overall this recipe was delicious!

This is the first type of cake/cheesecake/pie I have ever made and it came out great. It was easy and tasted wonderful. I added a lil extra sugar because some said it wasn't sweet enough and my pies needed to cook a little longer than 50 minutes. I took one to an office party and it was a big hit. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this twice now...the first time last Thanksgiving and the second time today.  The first time I used regular pie crusts, but today I used a graham cracker crust and put it in a springform pan, covering the bottom of the pan with foil (outside of the pan) and placing in a water-bath to bake.

I thought this was pretty good, but it wasn't as "pumpkin-y" tasting as I wanted it to be. Next time I will try adding more pumpkin puree and adding some of the premade pumpkin pie spice to see if it brings it up to a pumpkin pie type level.... but thanks very much for the starter recipe, there weren't any leftovers!

I like this. I used a big springform instead of 2 small pans; my crust got a little burned on the bottom but that's my oven and my failure to use a water bath. Other than that, delicious. Upon realizing I only had 1 egg, I had to replace the other egg with a spoonful of mayo. Just in case anyone's curious, that works fine. :)

This was yummy and SO easy to make!  Like someone said before, I added some flour, 1 tsp and it still came out a bit runny. I also added some brown sugar and a little more that 1/2 cup pumpkin. It took much longer than 50mins to bake, I baked it for about 1hr 20mins and lowered the temp to 325 after 1 hr. It was so good! I'm sure it will be even better next time I make it.

This was not enjoyed by anyone in my house. I was *so* disappointed. We love pumpkin pie & cheesecake so I was expecting this to be a big hit. It wasn't! The texture was awful, the spices were way off, and it was not sweet. We topped it with LOTS of Cool Whip and pecan pieces but never finished half of the pie. I would omit ginger & increase the sugar for starters if I ever attempted this recipe again. Sorry!

I actually don't like pumpkin pie, but I volunteered to make the desserts for Thanksgiving this year, and I felt like I had to make it. Wrong! I found this recipe and decided I would try it out; it was delicious! The whole family raved about it! I made a few changes to make it a little more cheesecake-like though, including adding one package of cream cheese and making a graham cracker crust. I think next time I'll even try using a little less pumpkin filling too.

I panicked when I couldn't find my pumpkin cheesecake recipe for Thanksgiving. Gave this one a try and was very pleased. Made it in a 9 in springform, using graham cracker crust instead of pastry shells. Yummy!

This worked well. I made my own pie crust (graham crackers - feh) and used homemade low-fat fromage blanc for the cream cheese and it still was flavourful and rich. Oh, and acorn squash for the pumpkin works well too - just bake it in halves, cool it, mash, and let sit overnight in the fridge in a cheesecloth-lined strainer. Handy when squash is dirt cheap!

This is a really good recipe for the filling. I made a graham crust with brown sugar and pecans and turned this into bars. (I didnt follow and direction for the crust) It turned out great, the bars go a lot farther, and with a tastey recipe who doesnt want too make more of it :)

My boyfriend followed this recipe while he was in NY and said it was the best pumpkin cheesecake ever! Even sent me a photo to upload to the recipe. If he likes it you're gonna love it!

This was easy to make and great to eat!  It was simply delicious.  It had a light and fluffy texture, and great flavor.  Neither the cream cheese, nor the pumpkin really overwhelmed the pie - it was the perfect mix!

YUM!!!  This pumpkin cheesecake was super-easy to make and it was delicious.  Accidentally, I used only one pie shell and it still turned out fine.  My guys really loved this recipe.

This pumpkin cheesecake is fantastic!  I did make some changes though.  First of all, I used low fat cream cheese.  Also, I didn't have any ginger or nutmeg so I substituted 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I was making this for a work party so I made cupcake cheesecakes instead of making it in pie pans as the recipe suggests or a spring form pan like a traditional cheesecake.  I put some graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of each cupcake paper, filled them 2/3 full and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  Everyone loved them and my husband can't wait for me to make them again for Thanksgiving!

YUM! Like a few others, I used one 9-inch pie crusts (instead of the recommended two 8-inch). I also added a tsp of vanilla and 2 Tbsp of Flour. PERFECT!

I wanted to make this on the quick for my husband, who's having a bad day. I had an extra can of pumpkin puree in the cupboard and some graham crackers I wanted to use up for a crust.

I made a graham cracker crust from cinnamon graham crackers, 1/4 c. of melted butter and 1/4 c. of sugar. (For those of you who don't have a food processor to crush your grahams, use the ice crushing button to crush them.) I kept the cheesecake recipe about the same, only adding a little vanilla and used a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. This 
dessert only took me about 15 minutes to throw together.

I baked it in an 8x8 baking dish, which took longer to bake but turned out well.

I am not a fan of cheesecake, thus I have never made one, but wanted to make a pumpkin cheesecake at the suggestion of a friend.  This recipe got RAVE reviews from the three friends who tried it--all cheesecake fans.  I made it with neufchatel cheese to cut on the fat, and no one seemed to notice any lack of flavor. I will make this again--thanks!

Everyone had the same reaction, it was just like pumpkin pie but just not as strong.  Really simple, but it took a bit longer to bake than i expected.

This was a good recipe, though I tweaked it to make fuller pies.  The recipe isn't quite enough to make 2 full pies.  So if you add 1/3 of what the recipe calls for, to what you've already got, it should be enough to fill 2 pies.  I wanted a more cream-cheesy feel/taste, so I added more cream cheese and cut down on the sugar.  For my preference, it was a creamier not-so-sweet flavor.  All in all everyone loved it.

This recipe was alright, but I still prefer regular pumpkin pie.  I thought the cheese made it tooo creamy and the taste was a bit overwhelming.  My family liked it though!

I made these in muffin tins from a review i saw on here...i used cinnamon and vanilla as spice, no ginger or nutmeg...and instead of vanilla wafers as the crust i used keebler pecan sandies...they fit the muffin tine PERFECTLY and gave it a buttery crunchy crust rather than a mushy vanilla wafer...I also pared these treats with a Maple Cream Cheese Frosting...and then atop, I put a pecan...SO delicious! I am going to be making different variations of these too, vanilla caramel biscotti...rasperry cream...possibilites are endless! So much easier than a cake or pie, in my opinion...and they look more appetizing!!!!

This is super tasty! I've never tried it before and this was so yummy! I used gram cracker crust and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mine cracked in the oven I think I'll try a water bath next time.

Recipe is very simple to make and turns out delicious!  I used 48 tart shells instead of a pie crust and topped with whip cream just before serving.    Very cute!

I make this recipe every year around Thanksgiving, and every year it's gone before all the other recipes. This year I had extra pumpkin, so I substituted cream cheese for premade cheesecake filling, added some flour, and poured it into a mini cupcake pan. A huge hit as well!

Wonderful!  Everyone in my family enjoyed this at Thanksgiving.  I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan, so to me this tasted exactly like pumpkin pie, only better :)  I used 1/3 less fat (Neufchatel) cream cheese which turned out fine.  Also I did a graham cracker crust, added a little vanilla extract and made one 10-inch pie rather than two 8-inch pies (it was exactly the right amount of filling for a 10-inch pie).  Definitely top this with some homemade whipped cream like traditional pumpkin pie, because it is not super-sweet.  I would absolutely recommend this recipe if you are looking for a tasty pumpkin pie alternative!

Very simple and tasty. I halved the recipe and used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and an additional 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I baked it in the Graham Cracker Crust I from this site.

Made this, it's in the fridge now waiting for tommorow's Halloween get together =) I used a gungersnap cookie dough [[baked]] as the crust; pretty excited to see how it turns out!!! Unfortunately it cracked. Horribly. It was really easy an was able to get two pies..was prepared for one. Haha. Will update manana. UPDATE:: It was delicious!!! I loved it, and as did those who cleared their plates. And the crust was good, too. I'll definately do that again. Thanks for this easy, easy, convinient recipe from your madre ^_^

This came out wonderfully.  I doubled all the ingredients and used 1 - 30 ounce can of pumpkin pie mix (the kind that has all the spices already in it).  This eliminates the need for the spices.  I also used 2 - 9 inch graham cracker crusts.  I also increased the baking time to 1 hour.

Not exactly my favorite cheesecake, since I only have the Cheesecake Factory cheesecake to compare it to.  But decently tasty!  I halved the recipe for a 9-inch premade graham cracker crust, which ended up being just enough after my slight alterations, but it cracked in the oven while cooling.  I put a little more than a cup of homemade pumpkin puree, 2 teaspoons of flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and used a teaspoon of fresh ginger.  I suggest using the full teaspoon of cinnamon for half the recipe, and adding flour if you prefer the more cakey texture for cheesecake.  To marble, I just reserved about 1/6 cup of the original cheesecake mixture without pumpkin or spices and poured it over the mixture in strips, and then ran a knife up and down alternately through the batter.

A friend of mine is a caterer and I served this to her.  She loved it!  I followed some of the other comments...I increased the sugar and made it 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added about 50% more pumpkin than the reciped called for.    Used All Spice because I didn't have nutmeg.  It was a great hit.  Even the dog liked it (he got into the second pie as they were cooling down in the laundry room.  Bad doggie).

For the past three years on my birthday, I've had a pumpkin cheesecake - but this have been my LEAST favorite so far. The pumpkin is overpowered by the thick, heavy cream cheese and the whole thing is far too rich. I'd try it again with a bit of citrus zest and half ricotta cheese in place of the cream cheese, but I don't care for this recipe the way it's written. I was very disappointed by my birthday cake this year.

This is really good.  I did tweak it a little though.  I added 1/4 t. of cloves, 1 T. of flour, and 1/4 c. of cream.  Also, if you cook it until a knife comes out clean, it will be over done.  I cooked it on a sheet pan with a little water in it until it no longer jiggled when shaken.  I also topped it with caramel and whipped cream.  YUMMMMM!

Pretty good. Make sure you let it cool the full three hours or else it won't set. I added a little more spice than what was suggested but overall it was pretty good.

My husband loves pumpkin pie and I hate it. This is our compromise. This is delicious- my only complaint is that you have to really work at mixing it well or it will be gritty.

Excellent pumpkin cheesecake.  I used splenda instead of sugar and I also 1 1/2 times the recipe.  This made 2 deep dish pies.  Very good and creamy!

This is an excellent recipe!  I made these 2 cheese cakes for 25 people, and I never heard the end of it. Even people who didn't really like pumpkin loved this cheese cake. Had an uncle come visit me the next day and said he heard all about this cheese cake and needed to try it. Will be on the desert menu for years to come! Thanks!

I loved this reciepe for it's ease of use.  Instead of using the ready made pie crusts (which is a huge time saver), I made a cookie crust. No matter - the pie tasted divine, wasn't overly rich and was silky smooth.

As an alternative, I used low fatfat free cream cheese and you wouldn't even know the difference!

This was really good. You would think the pumpkin flavor would over power the cream cheese, but it really is less pumpkiny than pumpkin pie. I added a couple scoops of sour cream and cooked it for one hour. I also used a graham cracker crust from scratch in a springform. It was great!

Quite tasty; the cheesecake and the pumpkin balance each other so neither is too strong.  Raving reviews from everyone I've made this very easy cheesecake for.

My husband says original recipe probably gets 3 1/2 stars.  I used Nilla wafers and butter to make a crust, added 1/2 cup plain yogurt to the filling and poured it into a 2.2 quart rectangular pan.  It's much easier to control your portion size this way.

I use one 9 inch deep dish shell, and add just a bit of vanilla and a little extra sugar.  It makes it unbelievably thick and sinful!  I make this year round, as I am a cheesecake junkie and my husband could live on pumpkin pie.

I used two cake pans sitting in a cast iron skillet with water to the rim of the cake pan. I also used a graham cracker crust and 2 cups pureed  pumpkin instead of the can. This was delicious!

I made this for my dad who is bedridden due to recent surgery, so I used low fat cream cheese and Splenda to try and make it a little healthier. It was a little dry for some reason but when paired with ice cream or simply covered in whip cream, it was perfect.

So this was my first time ever making a cheesecake....made it for Valentine's day for my bf who loves pumpkin cheesecake.  He thought it was amazing!  The only thing I would change is maybe next time add a little more creamcheese to it....I topped it off with warm caramel sauce, awesome!!!

Not bad however I thought it was a little heavy for the thickness or depth of final product than I was looking for. It also did not have the right balance between pumpkin and cheesecake for my taste.

I liked this more than traditional pumpkin pie.  You just cannot go wrong when you add cream cheese!  I used a graham cracker crust and topped it with whipped cream.  It was very good and everyone seemed to like the variation.

This was a great recipe, but a little light on the sugar.  I added 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4. Very good!

This wasn't much different from a pumpkin pie. I didn't get rave reviews - rather "its pretty good". So I am giving it 4 because its a good pumpkin pie - but whats the point of the cheese?

I made this with a graham cracker crust instead and it was a hit!  Next time I'll make it a little fluffier...maybe by adding a bit of flour like another person suggested?

Really a fantastic recipe.  I had a party and everyone was raving!  Thanks!

I used fresh pumpkin.  Just scoop, peel, cube, boil, and puree in the food processor.  

Also, making a crust from scratch takes minimal effort and is well worth it in the end.  There are recipes on this site, but basically add lots of melted butter to crushed graham crackers and sugar, bake for a few minutes, and refrigerate.

When I first tried this recipe, I was very skeptical. I don't like pumpkin pie (neither does my husband), but when we first tasted the end result of this recipe we fell in love with it! I make it all the time as a substitute for pumpkin pie.

Well I liked it but when I brought it to work it sat in the fridge for a while. Maybe people were just being polite but they didn't gobble it right up. They said they liked it but didn't have seconds. Hmmm.

This was really easy and it turned out beautifully.  The cream cheese flavor balances out the pumpkin taste perfectly.

I added about 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices alone and a little more sugar. Definitely use two 6" pie crusts. Didn't make enough for 8". Came out very good.

I used Cabot cream cheese, and had to add more sugar because it was much more tart than Philly. I would recommend tasting the batter (before the raw egg is added), and adjusting the sugar and spices to preference.

My suggestion for anyone making this is to make it a day ahead of time. I made them in the morning, and we ate them in the early evening. They tasted OK. The ones I had left over were in the fridge and when I had one the next day, there was a world of difference....much better flavor.

I made the pumpkin cheesecake just as written, but made one large pie instead of two smaller ones. It was a big hit -- we all had two pieces! I was asked for the recipe afterward. Delicious!

It came out fantastic, I used egg replacers because of an egg allergy but ask that I needed to do was cook it a little longer. I also used a homemade Graham cracker crust and only needed one pan. I will definitely make this again.

I used half the amount of cream cheese (because cheese cakes don't always agree with me) and it was like a thick and delicious slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream already on it.

I used a springform pan and made a graham cracker crust instead of baking 2. It was still done in 50 minutes as recipe states. Everybody at our Thanksgiving dinner loved it.

This is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever made!  My family loves it, including two of my sons who don't like anything cheesecake.  They said it's better than pumpkin pie.  The only ingredient variations I made was using 1/3 light cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and 1/2 cup of Domino Blend (sugar/stevia combination) instead of sugar.  I used one big pie crust, which was the Keebler graham cracker crust with 2 extra servings.  The batter fit perfectly in that crust.  I baked it for one hour.  This will be a new regular dessert at our house!

Made it today with a gluten-free crust.  I use Bob's Red Mill 
Gluten-Free Shortbread Cookie mix for pie crust.  Plenty of crust for two pie pans, baked it for about 8 minutes then filled the crust. It is a lovely combination with the pumpkin cheesecake.  My family loves it!  The kids would like it a bit sweeter but it is great by my standards.  Very simple and fast recipe.  It did take longer to bake but I made my thick in smaller pans so it needed more time.  Fresh whipped cream made it divine!

I made this for a group of 6 people and it was a huge success. I used low fat cream cheese and instead of white sugar I used coconut sugar.
Two of my guests requested to take some home with them!
