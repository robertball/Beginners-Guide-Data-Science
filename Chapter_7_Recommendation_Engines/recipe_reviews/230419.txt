Wow! Did this tonight in the crockpot. Just threw everything in and put it on low for 8 hours. Turned it up to high for an hour to thicken with a bit more flour, and that was it. Super tasty. Everybody loved it. I used 2 teaspoons of each of the herbs, and threw in some bay leaves. Short on wine so used some water and chicken soup base. One of the best things I've made in the crockpot. Will be making this again regularly!

This got rave reviews. i didn't transfer my pork into another dish after browning it. (why dirty another bowl/dish?) I just pushed it aside in my ovenproof metal skillet and browned  the onions and garlic, then used white wine instead of sherry to make a roux. The rosemary and thyme are a nice touch.

Made this yesterday for my daughter's family, who are fussy eaters,  they loved it.  My daughter, who is a great cook, demanded the recipe.  One small change, did not have either sherry or a white wine (we like the reds!!)grabbed a bottle of Merlot and used a generous dollop of that.   BuggyBob

I reviewed the comments and decided to fix this in the crock pot.  I did coat the pork cubes in Dijon mustard then put them in a zip lock bag with the flour and brown sugar mixture to coat them again.  I browned the pork then put the pork in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients.  I also added some cubed parsnip.  It turned out great.

This is a keeper for me. The only change I made is to use 2 pounds of pork and 3 large sweet potatoes. Yummy on a cold winter evening.

I was very skeptical about this recipe and actually put a 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/3.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was superb!  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious. We eat Paleo so I made some adjustments (coconut sugar in place of brown, apple cider vinegar  in place of sherry and  coconut  flour in place of reg. )

This is a very good pork stew recipe-I usually make it exactly by the original recipe.  We really enjoy it, but for us, it makes a fairly large batch...more than one meal worth.  So, last time,  I added some (rinsed canned) black beans (about 3/4 Cup)   to the leftover stew and we liked it even more the next day!

Used a pre marinated pork loin (because that's what I had), cut into bite size pieces.. Placed them in a Pam sprayed crock pot, layered with cubed sweet potatoes.. Mixed remaining ingredients (substituted 1/3cup sweet vermouth for the cup of sherry) in a glass bowl, then poured over meat and potatoes. Cooked in low about 6 hours. House smells amazing and dinner was wonderful. Served with a green salad for side. Thanks for this recipe!

I seared the meat as directed in a large stoneware pot and put this in a separate dish while I used the same pot (without washing) to make the recipe, adding the meat back in before it went into the oven. Came out beautifully. Great flavors!

It was delicious! I didn't have any pork on hand so I used beef instead. I also didn't have brown sugar so I used organic sugar. Beef was nice and tender, stew had great flavor! I though it would turn out too sweet because of the sugar and the sweet potatoes but it surprisingly wasn't. Would make again for sure, especially around the fall!

My husband and sons loved this recipe and asked that I keep it for future meals.  I was surprisingly a bit more neutral.  Though I am someone who likes food a bit on the bland side, this tasted like it needed something more.  It was tasty, but I would have liked it if there were a bit more flavor.

I had high hopes for this but have to say I was very disappointed with the results. Nothing special and a lot of prep work.

I subed coconut flour and palm sugar and simply cooked it in an oven safe skillet. It came out great!  The only change I would make is adding some extra water before baking and forego the added uncovered baking time at the end. I really liked the addition of rosemary and thyme, I was a bit skeptical as to how it would mix with the sweet potato, but it was a very good flavor combo!

I used 2.75 lbs of sweet potatoes (2 large sweet potatoes) with 2.8 lbs of pork, which filled a 3 qt casserole dish heaping full. I used aluminum foil to cover the dish. At 50 mins in the oven, the temperature of the pork was 180 and the sweet potatoes were plenty tender. I would recommend checking the dish much sooner than recommended, for this reason.

 (Pork loin is considered done at 145 degrees, so if your sweet potatoes are tender too, you should be good! http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/dining/porks-safe-cooking-temperature-is-lowered.html)

We thought this was really delicious. I absolutely love the flavor - pretty unique - not something I would say I've had before, though it is a bit reminiscent of other rich stews with sherry in it. It's a little sweet (not in a bad way).

Excellent...did not add wine, and it was still very good. Savory and delicious. Takes a while to make, but worth it.

side of brown rice-used chicken broth for liquid and added cranberries to the liquid  and let it come to a boil. Used Marsala wine instead of Sherry.
Great flavor

So good!  I substituted boneless/skinless chicken breast, because I had some that needed to be cooked before it went bad.  Since chicken doesn't yield as much fat or liquid as pork, I added more broth (approximately doubled) and added a tablespoon of butter.  It turned out amazing! I can't wait to try it with pork.  The dijon mustard combined with brown sugar is to die for!

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand, but didn't have sherry (substituted extra chicken broth) or rosemary.  It is still an excellent dish.  I imagine it's better with the sherry & rosemary.  I'll make this again!

This is a delicious treat.  I added a bit of cauliflower just for an additional veggie, didn't use the Dijon mustard simply because I don't like it.  The stew came out great.  Served with choice of as-is or over rice, complimented with dinner rolls and butter.

I won’t make it again because it is simply A ton of prep work! It was just OK. I had to Nuke the potatoes in the microwave to soften them so I could cut them into cubes. I did not have rosemary so I finely chopped about 1 Tbs. fresh thyme. I used more potatoes than the recipe called For so I added 1 C. Water. I put it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hrs, as per cook’s note. It was watery so I transferred it to a stock pot and dissolved 3 Tbs. flour into water and added it to the pot, simmered just until thickened. Also, It was mushy so less time in the crock pot would have been appropriate.

Easy and delicious. I made this in the slow cooker. I did as others suggested and coated the pork with mustard then coated with flour and brown sugar. After browning the pork, I put the pork and other ingredients in the slow cooker. Cooked for 6 hours on low. Yummy!

Loved it. I used pork tenderloin instead of the pork loin. And I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker. Next time I will only use half of the sherry. (I loved the sherry but my husband thought it was a little too much).  I served it with a rustic, homemade oatmeal bread.

Was pretty good but got tired of it after a while. I added more salt and then some cinnamon too after it was done cooking because it was initially bland. They both helped.

Did a half size of everything and it turned out delicious. The brown sugar/flour mix gave the meat a little sweetness to go well with the sweet potatoes. My onion had gone bad so I substituted some green onions from my garden.  Next time I will cut back a little on the time as the sweet potatoes were a little too soft.

It has a robust flavor.  It made too much to fit into my 9x13 baking dish, so I had to split it between 2 baking dishes.  Did not have to cook the extra 20 minutes that the recipe called for. It was a little thicker than the picture.  I forgot to take a pic of mine.  I will next time, because we definitely will be making this again.

I also threw everything in a crockpot, without pre-cooking anything. I didn't use any sugar or flour, and for liquid I used a 2 cup can of chicken broth and a splash of red wine. I used a large sprig of fresh rosemary because I have a bush. I used meat off a pork rib brisket bone which is really a horrible cut of meat, that I had cooked the heck out of the day before. I threw in a half cup of chopped celery and a couple of chopped carrots. This turned out excellent. The flavor is quite sweet due to the potatoes.

Other than adding some cauliflower to make it a one pot meal I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this again.

I used the recipe, but cooked it in the crock pot.  My husband and I loved it.  I've made it 4 times now and plan to make it again.

I made this yesterday and I thought it was off the charts! I used a  seasoned pork loin and a tad more sherry than it called for as the sweet potatoes always soak up a lot of moisture. I used a bit less brown sugar (as I was almost out) and a tad more of the seasonings. All in all,  it's a keeper!

This turned out all right. I thought the sauce was bland. I think I'll skip the sugar next time. I threw everything in the crockpot. Only used 2 lbs of meat and regular mustard. The other issue I had with this recipe is its lack of veggie variety. I had some leftover carrots and spinach from a salad and threw those in there. I also think this recipe would go well some green beans, but we were out of them. Someone suggested cauliflower, might try that too. Will probably make again.

OMG. The best! We had this on a cold, snowy day--12 inches of snow. It had great flavor and really warmed us up. The meat was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tasty. I didn't have sherry, so I used white wine. and I added some white potatoes. Yum!
