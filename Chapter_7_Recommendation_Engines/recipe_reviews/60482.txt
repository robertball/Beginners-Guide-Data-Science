My boyfriend and I enjoy this recipe a lot... we certainly reminisce about meatloafs eaten in our youth!
The only thing we don't like about this recipe is the onion soup mix. We find it makes for a very SALTY loaf. Instead, we sautee onions and green peppers before hand and throw them in to bake with the other ingredients. 
I definitely recommend this recipe for anyone, and it goes well with veggies, potatoes, stuffing, or anything else you can dream up! Very filling!

It's a decent base to start with, but I would omit the onion soup the next time. It was WAAAAAAY to salty for my family.

I have tried other vegetarian meatloaf recipes and the results have ranged disappointing to dreadful.  This meatloaf is so good and so simple to make, I'm stunned.  It also seems like it's really easy to customize without risking a disastrous outcome.  

I'm looking forward to experimenting with barbecue sauce, tomatoes, etc.  This time (my first), I doubled everything except for the soup mix and it came out great.  I held back on the mix based on some other reviews, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary.  I'll probably test different amounts of that in the future.

I followed Georgia's advice and sauteed onions and bell peppers instead of using soup to cut back on sodium and MSG. This was fantastic as a meat loaf and it's versatile, too.

Using a cookie scoop, it also makes wonderful "meat" balls. Just bake them about 20 minutes and they're perfect. I put a couple on a hoagie roll with some marinara and parm and it makes a great meat(less)ball sub!

I LOVED it & so did my meat-eating husband!  I was shocked at how good it was.  The only thing I did differently was I added 1/2 cup+ of water b/c the veggie crumbles that I used are the frozen and didn't quite have the right consistency without the water.  I recommend this recipe to anyone!

We thought that this was really good, except, too salty.  I should have paid attention to other reviews.  The loaf held together good, I used a pkt of (Lipton) onion soup mix and a tablespoon of vegetarian beef boullion in doubling the recipe (all in one pan, it must be pretty scrawny as a single batch.)I used homemade seitan instead of Boca crumbles, a little extra work but we make up a bunch and freeze it in packages of 3/4 pounds.  Served this with mashed potatoes and package vege beef gravy and asparagas.

This recipe was really good! I used Hain's vegetarian gravy mix instead of onion soup (although I would probably use half the mix if you do not like it too salty). I also cooked the Boca crumbles with some sauteed onions and mushrooms, then added the gravy mix and a few tablespoons of water, a teaspoon of sherry, and rosemary, garlic, and thyme. I also used Progresso Italian style breadcrumbs for more flavor. Otherwise I followed the recipe and cooked the loaf for 30 minutes. It was so good... and my veggie-friendly but meat appreciating husband LOVED it! Thanks!

I wish there was 1/2 stars so I could give it 4.5.  The only reason it's not a 5 is because it fell apart and I made slight changes.  Like the other fantastic reviewers noted, the soup mix would've been too much so I used half a packet.  Also used 2 pckgs Smart Ground from the fridge section instead of frozen. I've tried both and neither hold together.  Also used sunflower oil instead of veg and added sauteed onion, garlic and grn. pepper instead of powder.  Glazed with 3/4 c ketchup, 1tbsp mustard, 1 tsp worsh. sauce, 2tbsp brown sugar.  I served on a bed of mashed red potatoes (5 potatoes boiled and mashed, 1/2c mayo, 1/2 c milk, 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp salt) and a side of steamed carrots.  Very hearty meal, will definitely make again.  I'd love suggestions on how to make it hold together better.

I'm another one of those with a meat-loving husband who didn't believe it wasn't real beef! We thought it was delicious. I agree that the amount of onion soup called for it too much; in fact, I'm just going to use my usual old-fashioned meatloaf recipe in which I put in a can of diced tomatoes. I used a 10 oz. can for a double recipe.

As a vegetarian, I am always looking for new meatless recipes. I have tried several meatless loafs on this site and they were okay but this is by far the best! I did leave out the onion mix and added a ketchup glaze with prepared mustard and a little brown sugar. Fabulous!

Easy, quick and delicious! I didn't use soup mix, instead sauted onion, garlic, basil, oregano and parsley and also added a couple tablespoons of steak sauce. Will definitely make this again!

I tried this recipe and really liked it...as did my meat-eating mother. I followed the advice of some of the others and only used half the packet of soup mix to cut down on the salt. Very easy to prepare. Only problem is that it was a little dry. Probably should have followed the other advice and added more water to my frozen veggie crumbles. Overall, it was a good recipe and I would recommend it to others.

I used egg re-placer (wet) in this recipe and it turned out completely vegan! Oh, the soup mix (I used a vegan gravy mix instead)! I will try adding some veges in it the next time I make it!

This was a really good base. My boyfriend and I added finally chopped carrots, celary, red pepper, onions and garlic to the ground feef (fake beef) all in a big skillet, added some generic all herb seasoning, the skillet was big enough to mix the bread crumbs and oil/egg in with later.
We also added the ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, sauce to the top and it cooked up really nicely.

Loved this recipe.  As a vegetarian I have tried so many "meat" loaf recipes hoping to find one that would work for special occasions.  Well, I finally found one.  This worked out great.  I served it with mashed potatoes, gravy and brussel sprouts.  It was one of the best meals I have made in a long time!!  Thank you for ending my search!!:-)

Excellent! I didn't add the onion soup mix, but did the peppers and added dried minced onion. I also did mine in the muffin pan a la meatballs. I served them over a half of a baked potato. YUMMY!

I loved this recipe!  I used the can of Rotel and added chopped celery and onions per others suggestions.  I also used the frozen crumbles which others had said came out dry, but with the addition of the Rotel found it to be a tad too moist for my tastes.  Next time I'll try it with TVP and a little less of the liquid from the can.  I'll also double the recipe b/c it didn't come close to filling up my loaf pan.  Still tasted great!

This recipe was just okay for me. As another reviewer stated it was much too salty since both the veggie crumbles and soup mix contain lots of salt. I prefer using the Cottage Cheese Loaf recipe on this site instead and my husband agreed. I did bake some carrots and other veggies while this baked to make my meal easy.

This loaf has an excellent flavor but was way too salty with the dry soup mix.  Next time I'll use 1/2 pkg. and it should be just right.

Easy to make, just a few ingredients. Replaced eggs with cornstarch and water, and obviously used a different flavor of  soup mix - beef is hardly vegetarian! Added ketchup, because it didn’t seem moist enough...

The end result was delicious.

This recipe is awesome, with a few changes. I agree with most other reviewers that with the soup mix, the meatloaf is very salty. Instead, I put in 1 cup of chopped, sautéed onion. I also use the Quorn brand of meatless crumbles, and it is delicious.

After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try. 
...doubled the crumbles and omitted soup mix
..sauteed onion (1 med),  garlic (3), & bell pepper (1) together
..added crumbles and sauteed with veggies for just a few minutes to melt the ice - used frozen crumbles
..followed the rest of the recipe BUT I did beat the oil with the eggs so that it would be easier to mix in
I made a vegetarian brown gravy to go with it.  I will definitely make again.

I was more than pleasantly surprised at my family's reaction to this recipe-- they loved it!  I followed the recipe as written with the result being a bit dry (and I thought a bit salty, but no one else did), which overall pleased everyone as it wasn't greasy or mushy-- just flavorful.  My one additional contribution to this was to make an beef/onion gravy using chopped onions fried in butter with beef boullion, etc.  I then served it with mashed potatoes and put gravy over both the meat and potatoes.  Turned out to be just right.  If/when we want meat(less)loaf again, this will be the "go to" recipe.

Instead of buying the crumbles I cooked garden burgers and crumbled them myself. The taste is much better. Also to make everything stick together better I used Sweet Onion BBQ sauce until I got the consistency that I wanted. My wife is a vegetarian and she said this was the best recipe for meatless loaf she has ever had.

I don't consider beef and onion dry soup mix as vegetarian. So i used a dry onion soup  mix without any meat products instead.   It made a great meatloaf.

I probably haven't had meatloaf in over 20 years. I don't know why I never tried making a veggie meatloaf before but I am glad I finally did. This was super tasty. I doubled everything except the soup mix and I topped it with ketchup mixed with a little bit of mustard and brown sugar. I also added sautéed onions and little water to the mixture to get the right consistency. I can see being able to easily change up the recipe for variety.

Husband and I love this! We first tried it attempting a diet, but it was soooo good we ended up eating way too much of it. I like it just the way it is!

This is the best vegetarian meatloaf recipe I've ever tried. It didn't come out soggy, dry, or hard like other recipes I've used. I sauteed half of an onion and I added a "Meatloaf Flavoring" packet instead of the Onion Soup. I won't add the seasoning packet next time, it was too salty.

This was a wonderful recipe. I added shiitake mushrooms which added a meaty taste. Used the left overs as a meat substitute in tacos.

We did not care for this recipe. It was too dry.
