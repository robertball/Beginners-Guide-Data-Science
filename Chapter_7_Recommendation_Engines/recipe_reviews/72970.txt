Mmmm! Good stuff! This was even better than I expected. The dressing was delicious. I used fresh, raw corn (8 ears), and 1/2 clove garlic plus 1/4 tsp sea salt instead of garlic salt. The only change I'd recommend is to cut back on the olive oil--I used 1/2 cup, and that was plenty (just make sure you adjust the lime juice and cider vinegar accordingly so it's not too sour--I eyeballed it and then added a drizzle of juice from the pimentos). I only had about an hour to let it marinate, and that was just fine.

This is excellent to go with a Bar-B-Q, very tasty, everyone loved it at my husbands birthday party. I used grilled corn nibs from Trader Joe's, gave added flavor and color contrast. I will keep this recipe and make it again.

This is a beautiful, mouth watering taste of summer.  I used fresh corn, blanched and cut from the cobs.  Thank you for a tasty & easy recipe.

Monday June 18, 2012 by Lorene
Terrific salad! Easy and the dressing is to die for. I deleted the zucchini and opted for a couple each of sweet orange and red peppers for more color. Added a small amount of Cilantro and used a can of black seasoned beans rinsed and drained. It is delicious. Going to try Dill next time because some of the family does not care for the Cilantro. Will definitely make this salad alot.

This is a delicious summer salad that's very "juicy".  (Read into that that you should have french bread on hand to sop up the left overs!)   I'm not big on pimentos, so I substituted chopped tomato and it really was a nice addition.   Be warned that the recipe makes p-l-e-n-t-y of dressing.   Too much, actually.   So I would probably half that next time.

Yummy!  I used fresh red pepper as I didn't have pimento peppers and I added chopped jicama, but it is definitely the dressing that gives this dish the zing!

I really didn't like this at first, but didn't want to throw the whole salad away. It started to grow on me and we ate it with tortilla chips like salsa.

I made this and it was very good. I decided to use fresh corn, blanched fresh red bell pepper, and blanched fresh japapeno with the seeds removed. It turned out really fresh and tasty.

Delicious! I made a half version, using fresh corn that I steamed. I didn't have zucchini on hand so I subbed peeled, chopped cucumber which I really liked. I didn't drain the chopped pimentos (great addition, btw) and used garlic powder. I didn't want to open a can of green chilies for a small amount, so I just added a bit of cayenne pepper in its place. The dressing was very good but just a little tart for my taste so I added a few pinches of sugar and it helped. Avocado on the side would go great with this. Thanks Kristi! This will be a refreshing salad for the summer, as you mentioned.

Excellent.  I halved the recipe and used 6 ears of corn, but I think 5 would have been plenty.  Using corn cut from the cob is really gonna give you best corn flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious! I had to modify it a little cause I scaled it down for two and had to sub some ingredients. I boiled one seeded jalape√±o for three minutes to soften it a little and dial back the heat, then diced it to replace the canned chilies. I didn't have pimentos, so I diced two jarred peppadew peppers. This is so great, when I make it again (and I definitely will), I'll make a full batch. I could certainly eat two servings by myself. I think maybe next time I'll fold in some diced avocado and serve it in pita breads, cause this would make a great summer vegetarian meal in itself. Thanks so much for sharing!

Made this with fresh corn off of the cob, and took it on a picnic.  Everyone raved about it!

So salty I had to add  more liquid to the dressing to be able to use it. Thank goodness I tried it on a sample salad before     adding it to the main salad.  The salad mix was very good, just be careful with the salt.  I would reduce it by half and go from there

I was nervous about this recipe... but it turned out sooooo tasty!  I didn't have pimentos, added a clove of garlic (instead of garlic salt), and cut the corn off ears of corn instead of frozen.

This was really good.  I had to make 2 small changes and that is that I don't care for pimiento so I used black olives, and I didn't realize I was out of green chile, but it was probably for the best because our 2 year old was eating this too.  The reason we didn't love this is that we were apprehensive of the raw zucchini.  Maybe I'll try cuke next time.  Used corn cut from leftover (cooked) cobs and it was the way to go!

This was perhaps one of the best salads I have ever had. I substituted fresh red pepper for the pimiento, and more important:  I ROASTED THE VEGETABLES ON THE GRILL AND CHILLED THEM before assembling the salad. It was fantastic.

So flipping good. I will make this every week it was so good. The only thing I did was cut everything in half because there are only two of us and I added a bit of chopped cilantro. I LOVE this corn salad. Thank you!
