These are terrific! I will definetly make them again. One tip so you don't make the mistake I did  - don't make the dough balls too big.  They don't cook in the middle, leaving a creamy center, which is still good, but not how they are supposed to be.  Also make sure, as with all oil frying, that your oil it hot hot hot! That way they won't be greasy. These were so tasty, not heavy or greasy at all, and my picky husband who rarely tries anything new even liked them!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I thought these were great!  I didn't have any half & half, so I just used the same amount of milk and they turned out great.  I'm not a big nutmeg fan, so I substituted cinnamon and ginger.  I recommend trying to not make the fritters too large, which can result in the middle not being done.  To go with the fritters, I made an apple sauce out of shredded apples, dried cranberries, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, butter, water, and a dash or two of salt.  I heated on the stove (slightly above medium) until it became somewhat thick (around 15 minutes total).  Try cutting the cheese fritters in half and placing the apple sauce on it.  Yummy!

What a great taste!  I had some leftover cottage cheese that I wanted to use up and this was the perfect solution!  Make sure you drain the fritters well after frying as they do retain the grease.  The nutmeg adds an awesome surprise flavor.  Light and fluffy and yummy w/raspberry jam!

OM Gosh but these are good... fluffy little balls of heaven!  I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2 so I used milk, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I served them with seedless raspberry jam.  I like them enough that I'll be making these for Easter morning!

I made these last Chanukah and found they were fantastic. I made them for a friend who is really picky and he just kept going on and on about how good they were!

Made these to go with dinner tonight.  I thought it would be a great way to get my kids to try cottage cheese.  No can do, they wouldn't eat them!  I don't know if they turned out right though.  Some were soft but "cooked" inside, some were runny inside.  Not sure which texture is correct?  I thought they were yummy, but I like cottage cheese anyway.  I followed the recipe as posted, except for draining the cottage cheese...I didn't have time to wait, and it didn't seem necessary.

Very cool recipe.  I'm a newbie cook, so I'm looking for simple recipes like this to play with.  I was a little messy, but altogether, they tasted pretty good.

If you know me then you know I have somewhat of an addiction to cottage cheese. We go through container after container, week after week. Costco sized portions can’t keep up with this household’s needs. Cottage cheese on toast, cottage cheese to top off a hot dog, CC on a BLT, pour some honey in for sweet cheese. We do it all. And now, in a beautiful fried ball. Needless to say, I used twice the recommended amount.

No nutmeg and only one tbs of sugar.  My husband and kids loved them and I was amazed by how fluffy they were

We made no changes, however you could use this batter as a base and change it to almost any thing you could think of. Will definitely make again.

These were delicious!  Cheese melted and made them flavorful.  Great recipe when you have an extra jar of cottage cheese.

I really did not care for this recipe.  I was not fond of the taste of cheese and nutmeg together.  I was looking for a recipe similar to the one for Cheese Fritters sold in a local restaurant, but this one failed to compare.
