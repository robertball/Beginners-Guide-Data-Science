This is awesome cheesecake!! The best cheesecake I've ever made-and I've made a few.  It will defintely be made many more times. Tip for those lactose intolerant.  I replaced the cream cheese w/Better Than Cream Cheese(soy product)and no one ever knew.(I've done this before and no one knows the difference. It sounds kind of gross, but it is very good, especially w/ chocolate!).  There is also Sour Supreme Better Than Sour Cream you can use for the topping if you want.  But like others, I left it off.  Thank you for the recipe Elizabeth!!

I loved the taste of this cheesecake.  Not so chocolately that you can't eat a piece, moist and creamy.  I think I will make the crust half again as large as I like a thicker crust on cheesecake.  It was a hit with friends! A keeper!

I made some revisions to this receipe. I used a regular graham cracker crust. 
However this cheesecake was a hit. I made a total of 3 different kinds of cheesecake for a family event and this is the only one that everybody wanted the receipe for. 
It is now a staple for me.

This is a fabulous recipe!  The cheesecake turned out beautifully and I was so proud of myself, being my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  Our guests were very impressed and some even stopped by the next day to see if there was any left over!  The next time I make it I will try it without the topping.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was totally easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Before serving, I grated a dark chocolate espresso bar over the top with a microplane grater to conceal any imperfections, and then I added stars of whipped cream along the outer edge and topped each star with a chocolate covered espresso bean.  I can't believe I forgot to take a picture. I will make this again for sure.  Very creamy, not too dense, and best of all, the cake didn't crack!

My first ever cheesecake and it came out great.  I skipped the topping.  Next time I will drizzle some chocolate over the top and I would double the crust (might also be good with a graham cracker crust).  I also turned the oven off after 40 min. and kept the door closed.  Texture was perfect.  This was a big hit with my boyfriend.

I changed a lot in this recipe, but what I made was amazing! I split the cream cheese mixture into two and added coffee to one and the chocolate to the other to give the cheesecake a layered look. Instead  of the sour cream topping, I used melted chocolate chips and for the crust I used oreo's...very chocolaty and VERY delicious!

Made this the night before for a coworker's birthday.  It was really rich but totally delicious and the topping looked nice.  I would definitely make this again.
