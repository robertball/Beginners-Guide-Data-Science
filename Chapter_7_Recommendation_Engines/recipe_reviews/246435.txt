Thanks for posting this recipe!  I used it as a base for my smoothie.  It was delicious, filling and kept me full for a good part of the day.  I used almond milk instead of water,added  1/2 of an avocado, ground chia seeds, 1 tbsp. Peanut Butter, and 1 tsp of honey.  I like some sweetness.  The beans were a great idea for added protein and fibre!  Love this and can use the base recipe for many filling variations.

This is a good and healthy smoothie. I would suggest adding a banana to smooth it out and maybe a bit of sweetener or sugar for a wee bit of a sweet flavour.

Had high hopes for this, but it was just ok.  Needed more tang.

Super Smoothie! I like the Match tea with the mango and coconut, adds  great flavor and kale is pretty.
