This slaw was good, but I did half the dijon mustard, any more than that and it would have overpowered the dressing, IMO.

We LOVED this.  The only changes made we made was we added a bit more blue cheese crumbles, one packet of Sweet & Low, and since the kids don't like cabbage I used bagged broccoli slaw. SO GOOD!  Everything was gone and bowl licked clean!
