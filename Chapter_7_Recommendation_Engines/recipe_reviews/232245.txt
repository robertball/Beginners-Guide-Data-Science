Not being a big fan of what I call weeds - mixed salad greens and fresh herbs - I decided to go for it anyway and I am so glad I did. The mixed salad greens and fresh herb provided the perfect blend of flavors. I made my own taco salad bowls and served the taco salad in them. Thank you ciheins for a great recipe and and changing my mind on weeds.

07-07-16 ~ DH is not a fan of ground turkey, but I had a half pound of browned ground turkey to use up. I made large meal salads to use it up. Not sure if we weren't in the mood for taco salad, but thought it lacked the punch that a taco salad usually serves. I added diced tomatoes, avocado and jalape√±os to the mix. It is good salad, and healthier than a beef taco salad, so your family should give it a try.
