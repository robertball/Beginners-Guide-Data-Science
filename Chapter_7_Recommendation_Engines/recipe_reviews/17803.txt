This is a great recipe..I made it with skinless thighs, and poured off all of the rendered fat from the first 25 minutes of cooking before adding the oyster sauce mixture. Also, after the chicken is done you can add the sauce from the pan to a bowl which has a little cornstarch & water whisked together in it...whisk the constarch mixture with the sauce to create a thicker "gravy" to spoon over the chicken..Yumm!

Way way way too sweet.  Made a second batch of the sauce using only 1 tablespoon of sugar and it was greatly improved.  Then added 3 tablespoons of Asian chili garlic sauce and cooked according to recipe.  Absolutely great that way.  Original recipe yielded a syrupy goo.

I was looking for an easy dinner tonight and was excited to find this recipe.  I didn't expect it to taste so good!  I added 2 inches of ginger, peeled and chopped and 1 teaspoon chili with garlic sauce to suit my taste.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for sharing Myrna.

I love oyster sauce on chicken, so I was looking around to see if anyone posted a recipe like this and if not, I was going to submit it. Well I guess I'm too late!! This is the exact recipe I use for my oyster sauce chicken and it is phenomenal!  I have a couple additions though, first I add some Sambal (hot sauce)to the mixture and I marinate the chicken for 30 minutes before roasting.  I use it on chicken wings instead of doing the same old buffalo wings.

I live in Australia and I have cooked this recipe twice now with an excellent result. My wife and son aged 22 enjoyed it the first and asked me to cook it for them again.Each serving was on a bed of boiled rice with a serving of stir fried seasonal vegies

If I recall, I think this made a lot of extra sauce, which I kept in a sealed Tupperware for making another batch.  Later that week, I marinated 10 more thighs in a Ziploc bag with that extra sauce, for 2 days, and took it camping with us.  Tastes even better on the grill!

This chicken was tender and tangy and really good I put the liquid from the bottom of the pan in a ramekin and dipped the meat in it. I love food with alot of flavor and this has it.

It hit me while I was making it that I was adding an awful lot of sugar to dinner. DH and I thought this was OK, but the kids didn't like it at all.  I don't think I'll make it again.

This was very good, thank you. I don't think it's necessary to precook the chicken though as I found THAT to be the unpleasant smell...kind of like thawing ground beef in a microwave. Yuk! If you don't precook the chicken and you turn down your temperature there is no need to add water or thicken your sauce with cornstarch (which is not good for you) I skinned my thighs as we all know chicken skins are not good for you either...sorry for the 'health kick'. I only used 1 cup of Oyster sauce as it's expensive and just a bit of brown  (instead of white) sugar 'winging it' as I usually do. The chicken was tender, the sauce perfect. Great for pouring over my Basmati Rice.

Made this tonight for dinner - it was an all-around winner at my house!  Used brown instead of white sugar and threw in some minced ginger as someone else had suggested to counter the smell of the oyster sauce (which it did) - other than that, as instructed and it came out great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband love this.  I found the sauce to be too watery.  Next time, I think I'll reduce the amount of water.  I also added a lot of Tabasco to give it more zip.

the wife said it smelled funny(?), i thought it smelled great. i used another reviewer's suggestions and mixed 2 parts oyster sauce with 1 part sweet garlic chili sauce. removed the skins and drained the fat off at 25 minutes. i used bone-in thighs salted and pepperd. made parm-egg noodles and a salad. very good stuff.

Used much less sugar, but overall it was wonderful! Added ginger and hot sauce like others suggested the second time I made It and I think it improves it. Save the sauce and drizzle some on rice! It's awesome!

One of the best chicken recipes I have ever made! My husband is a little picky, but he LOVED this recipe! A few things though. I used only a little over 1/2 a cup of sugar. The first time that I made it, I thought that it was a little sweet. Also, I used boneless,skinless chicken thighs. It really cut down on the grease left in the pan. I served it over sticky white rice, and spooned some of the pan drippings over everything! It was great!

This is an awesome and easy dish to make.  We loved the flavor of the sauce, allthough after reading other's reviews, I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 a cup.  I used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white.  I also added about 1 tsp. of minced ginger.  I can't wait to use this on shrimp and pork chops too!

Great flavor.  Loved the way this skin got crispy.  Just wish there was a way to make the sauce thicker. I think alot of that has to do with how "fatty" your chicken is.

THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! I did add a little bit of onion powder to mine. I also used 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts chopped up into cubes instead of wings and it still came out nicely. I prepared my dish as a meal so I cooked 4 cups of white rice and put it on the bottom of a 9x13" pan and then I put the finished Oyster Sauce Chicken on top and sprinkled on a little bit of sesame seed for look. It was delicious! I will absolutely make this dish again and again and again!

Loved it! The chicken was steamed instead and then simmered with the oyster sauce and garlic. I no longer added sugar. I'm gonna cook this dish again. :)

I really liked this, but cut sugar to a 1/3 of a cup,too much sugar in original recipe. My kids loved it , served with rice and broccoli , with toasted almonds. Great , quick during the week dinner.

So simple and was a big hit! Didn't have enough oyster sauce so substituted with beef broth which add so much more depth of favor.

I love love looooved this recipe. I made a few tweaks but all in all it came out great.  I use vegan oyster sauce, as I'm allergic to shellfish, and added a tablespoon of chui chow chili oil, reduced the sugar to just under 3 tablespoons, and it came out amazing!

I added only 2 Tbls of brown sugar and extra garlic,it was still sweet, so at the table sprinkled with ground red pepper for some heat. Love sweet and spicy. Very good.

This was okay, nothing special. I agree with previous reviewers that the sugar amount is way too high. I substituted Asian sweet chili sauce (3 TBSP) and only put about 1/3 cup of sugar. I would recommend brown sugar as white sugar is just too sweet and not in a good way. I've had better recipes with oyster sauce.

My kids enjoyed this well enough, but I could still taste the oyster-yness in it, which I am not fully supportive of, even though I like oysters.  I wanted it to carmelize more, crisp more.  I have tried other oyster/chicken dishes that seemed to work better.

Easy to cook. At first I though I would have to pan-fry the chicken after baking so it turns out to be golden but I didn't find that necessary. After pouring in the sauce and baking it for the second time, the chicken parts that were not submerged turned out to be golden brown. Yummy!

Very good, but way too sweet. I reduced the sugar down to 1/2 cup but next time I will try 1/4 cup. Really easy and very flavorful.

Wonderful and easy to make!  I also saved the sauce to marinate the extra chicken thighs I had left over with.  I'm thinking the grill would be perfect for next time around.  Using the sauce for dipping was a great suggestion too!  My kids liked the sauce poured over the rice! Yummmmmmmm

Interesting dish.  I made exactly per the recipe and did not heed the warnings about it being too sweet.  I tasted the sauce before I added it to the chicken and it did not taste too sweet to me.  But when it was completely done, it was a little too sweet for my tastes.  Will probably cut back on the sugar next time.  Served over sushi rice which was nice and sticky.

I really did like the way this tasted & it was very easy.  I used brown sugar, added 1 tbsp chopped ginger, & marinated for about 2 hours. The yummy sweet bite of ginger was my favorite part, I would not leave it out!  All that being said...I don't think I would make this for guests because I found the smell to be borderline offensive (sorry!)  I love seafood & I'm VERY adventurous with food, but I had to dare myself to take that first bite.  It's a musty old fish smell (duh, oyster sauce, I know) but I've learned never to roast oysters in the oven, grill 'em instead.  I'll probably try this recipe again but it's going on the grill, and outa my house!

Great flavor and something different.  I've made it as is and the kids loved it.  You can mix it up with your standard asian additions.  A little soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame seed oil, hoison(spl?) and sambal although i've subbed chipotle with success also ginger and diced green onion are good.

I cannot get enough of this recipe.  Most of my family and friends don't know what oyster sauce is and they always seemed to be turned off by the name "oyster sauce".  However, it is extremely good.  I usually cook this on a breast of chicken (bone-in) and it turns out great.  I tend to make too much sauce and it sticks to the pan so be careful.  I open occasionally to "baste".  Sometimes I use honey instead of sugar, either way is good.  Delicious!  I've made several times already and making again tonight.  Enjoy!

Oh my gosh this was heavenly! I couldn't find Oyster Sauce, but found Oyster FLAVORED Sauce made by Sun Luck. I used the spicy kind. It smelled wierd in the bottle but wow, what a recipe it turned out to be! I only had 2 thighs and 3 drumsticks left in the freezer. Normally the two of us would eat all of this but we loved the sauce over rice so much we didn't eat much of the chicken. (Good, can't wait for leftovers!) The chicken was perfectly moist. I only used about 1/4 cup of sugar and minced 2 garlic cloves. Next time, I will do like another reviewer said and pour the fat off after the initial 25 minutes of baking because it made the sauce kind of greasy. I like others, also mixed the remaining sauce with starch water to thicken it up. After reading one reviewer served over stir-fried pineapple and bean sprouts I tried it. It made quite an addition to the meal, boyfriend loved it. Must try this recipe! I will use it again and again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, and the best part is, since we have very busy lives, it was great to just be able to put it in the oven and forget about it for a while.  However, we did think that it could have done with a bit less sugar, so we'll try that next time.

This was surprisingly wonderful!  I was looking for an oriental sauce to use with my stir-fry.  I had run out of soy sauce and was looking for a sauce that didn't use it.  This was so good. My husband who doesn't usually like oriental food loved this sauce. Thanks for sharing and this is going in my recipe box!

I thought this was very good.  The sweetness of all the sugar and the oyster sauce was a nice combo.  I had this with steamed white rice.  I love how easy it was to make.  Next time I'll chop up some Thai chili and add it to the mix.  Also I brushed the sauce on 3x during the baking, every 5-10 minutes.  Definitely adding this to my recipe box! :o)

Excellent!  When I made the sauce I thought "This is going to be terrible".  But when it came out of the oven it was oh-so-good!  I added some sugar to mine and my bottle of oyster sauce was a 9 oz bottle.  Husband loved it too - I froze the left over sauce and we will make again!

Overall, this is a great recipe.  I thought that it was a little heavy on the oyster sauce, though.  My house smelled like a Chinese restaurant for days!  The leftovers were even better.  Serve with lots of rice and veggies b/c you'll have a lot of sauce left over.

It was ok.  My kids normally like "sweet" marinade, but they weren't too fond of it.  My husband didn't like it either, so I doubt I make it again.  I thought it was good and easy.

Very good.  This recipe is almost exactly the same as Baked Teriyaki Chicken by Marian.  I think Marian's would be cheaper because you don't need to buy the oyster sauce. Marian's requires a little more attention because it says to baste every ten minutes.  I think I remember reviewers saying they just poured all the sauce on at the beginning and it was still good.  So depending how much time I have both recipes are very similar but the oyster sauce chicken is a little easier.  Thanks, Michele, cambridge ontario

This was an excellent recipe, my family really enjoyed it! It was easy & delicious. The only ingredient I would omit in the future would be the pepper, I didn't care for the taste. However this dish will become a regular family favorite!

Required a lot of changes to become edible. Do not add an entire bottle of oyster sauce--you will regret it immensely.

We adjusted to 2 servings and cut the sugar to 3 TBL.  Used 3 thighs and left the skin on.  Baked at 400* as stated.  We thought it was going to be to high them but was exactly correct.  Served with curly noodles, 4 Oz.  Perfect and we ended up with a left over for each of us!  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again!

My family loved this and ate it right down.  I could not tolerate it.  If I plugged my nose, it was delicious but the oyster sauce smell was overwhelming for me and I won't be making it again.

I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed exactly and found it was way too salty.  I wish I had not salted the chicken thighs before baking.  I think it would still be too salty but at least it would eliminate some of the saltiness.  Don't know if I will try this recipe again.

We enjoyed this very much. I left a little skin on the thighs and brushed it with olive oil so it was crispy. I used sugar to taste which was a bit less than 1/2 a cup and added a good squoosh of tube ginger. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken was delicious and super easy to make. Following others ideas, we also used the juices after cooking to make a gravy (by whisking with corn starch while heating) and added chili garlic sauce for a little more zing.  We also lowered the sugar to 1 tablespoon.  The chicken turned out very moist, flavorful, and tender. Will definitely make again!  P.S. just find gluten-free oyster sauce and the dish is totally gluten free!

Only fair to say that when I make new recipes, I check comments which paid off big this time.  I used bone in, skin on thighs.  Listened to others and cut sugar to 1/4 cup of brown & 1/4 cup white sugar.  Added a tablespoon of sweet chili sauce, 2 TBLSPN of hot sweet chili sauce and a TBLSPN of ginger paste.  Only made 4 thighs but full sauce recipe, plenty left over.  Sauce came out as expected without thickening.  Topped with toasted sesame seeds.  Might try to broil briefly to finish to add extra crispness to skin.  Served over rice with stir fried broccoli and onion.  Will use left over sauce on some shrimp and add leftover chicken to make house riced rice.  Some mentioned there is a lot of sugar in this recipe.  Bear in mind there is a lot of sauce and you really don't consume much per serving, especially when cutting back as I did, but I prefer a bit of spice and heat to sweet.

I modified it by reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, and then adding 3/4 tbsp. of sugar-free liquid sweetener. I also added chopped green onions as garnish after pouring the sauce over the thighs. 

This was perfect for stir frying the rendered juice mixture with Udon noodles, carrot shreds, more green onions, sliced pre-stir fried green peppers, 2 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce, and 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger. It was a hit!

3/4 c of sugar seemed like way too much, so I started with 1/8 c, tasted, added more, repeat, until it was sweet but not cloying - I probably used less than 1/2 c total before it seemed right.

I followed other suggestions and used drumsticks.  For the sauce: 1/8 c water, 1/4 c oyster sauce, 1/4 c sugar, 1/8 c sweet chili sauce, 2 tsp minced garlic.  I baked the chicken as directed (400 degrees for 25 then 20 mins, lining with aluminum foil), and it turned out wonderful.  I had lots of sauce leftover.  Served with rice, salad, and side of spinach.

Unfortunately, I thought the amount of sugar called for in this recipe was way too much. The oyster sauce is more than sweet enough, especially when using a 10-ounce bottle.

made this recipe last night for dinner. loved it! hubby thought it was great although i didn't tell him that i substituted splenda for the white sugar. used only a small amount as a little splenda goes a long way. the glaze/sauce was tasty and kept the thighs moist and the skin crispy. this recipe is a definite keeper for my family.

I do a lot of asian style dishes & this one was right on** In order to help with the smell, add a teaspoon of minced fresh ginger. Filippinos use ginger with chicken adobo mainly to help the smell  and the ingredients in this dish are similiar to adobo. Also, add some thinly sliced onions & extra garlic.

Very flavorful and easy. I did make a few changes, only 1/4 c sugar and added about a 1/4 c of sweet chile asian sauce. Also added 1/4 c Crystal hot sauce, love the vinegar flavor. Had a pork tenderlion and marineted for two days and cooked on the outdoor grill, will make this again and again.

I tried this recipe and it came out beautifully. I used chicken breasts and they came out deliciously tender and juicy. The source was a little sweet so I added about a table spoon of lemon juice to it before poring it over the chicken. Yum! I served it with Chinese style fried rice and my husband almost licked his plate!

This is very easy to make. The only thing I'd do next time is reduce the amount of sugar. It is too sweet for us. Recommend to cook it with skin on, it is the best part!

This is so quick. I would like to use this recipe again just for speed. Unfortunately, I think that I could get the same taste with a bottled marinade. My son did not care for it. I thought it was ok.

Used 2/3 of the recommended oyster sauce as i wanted to make this for the next day, and marinated for approx. 24 hours. Cooked it in the oven without any extra sauce, and the chicken came out wonderfully soft. We stir fried bean sprouts, asparagus and pineapple with salt and pepper and placed it on the plate. We heated 2 ladles of the leftover sauce and after putting the cooked chicken on the veggies, we poured it over on top of everything. The sauce is pretty watery as people were stating, so adding the starch water will probably do the trick. The sauce still tastes good with the rice as is but I will try the starch water with the left over sauce next week. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of the dish, I just could not fathom at all the taste from just reading the recipe. One thing was that when we were cooking the chicken, the sauce gave off a strange smell. I've never cooked with oyster sauce before, so I don't know if it's supposed to smell like that or it was the brand I used. We eat a lot of Chinese food, and we've never smelled that scent before. It wasn't a super strong scent, but I have a good nose so maybe my nose was working too well. Anyhow, I posted a photo of dish we made. Thanks, Wendy, for the recipe.

This was pretty good. I used four boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut in half to make them cook faster. I cooked them 15 minutes without the sauce and 15 minutes with. If I make this again, I'll just cook them with the sauce the whole 30 minutes. I halved the amount of sauce, and used Splenda in it instead of sugar. The sauce was good, but could have been a lot more richer in flavor with more ingredients. But not bad for a really quick meal.

this was an excellent recipe - i made it with skinless drumsticks and it was so easy and delicious.  i put the sauce on right at the beginning and basted it a couple times while it was cooking.
