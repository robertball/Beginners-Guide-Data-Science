Oh my gosh, this is one of the best chicken dishes I ever made. My husband was skeptical about the cream cheese until he took his first bite. He was looking for thirds!!!! AWESOME RECIPE!!

My boyfriend and I both thought this was fantactic. I didn't have garlic cream cheese spread, so I mixed some powdered ranch dressing mix into the cream cheese and it tasted great. I also sliced a pocket in my chicken breast and stuffed instead of rolling (Live on the top floor of an apt, didn't want to be banging chicken). I also did not freeze, but cooked right away. The only problem I had was I did not use toothpicks and since my chicken breasts were so thick, some of the filling had leaked out. SO I would recommend doing as the recipe suggests as far as the technique, but the ranch dressing in the cream cheese was perfect. Also, I would recommend dipping the chicken in something before rolling in bread crumbs because the bread crumbs did not stick as well without it. And use panko!

I came across this recipe one day and had to try it!!  I am not the most patient cook so I typically dont like a recipe that has this many steps but it wasnt nearly as bad as it seemed while reading it!!  It was a major hit among the people I made it for and definitly plan on making it again!!  The best part is that it wasnt a lot of stuff that I had to go shopping for.  I had most everything in my kitchen already!!

Tried this, minus the garlic ingredients, and it was great!  Easy enough. Prep time was less than stated, though I did use 'thin sliced' chicken breast skipped the garlic & onions! Also, froze for less than 20 minutes, as I was time starved.  Everyone thought I had purchased the chicken, pre- breaded and stuffed, at a local gourmet market!!  Really good recipe! Thanks for passing it on!

This is the second time I've made this.  The first time, the chicken was totally overcooked at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes, so this time, I cut it back to 375.  The photo chicken breast was 10 oz (huge) and, again, it was slightly overcooked  at 20 minutes at 375.  My supermarkets do not carry garlic-flavored cream cheese, so I used lower fat cream cheese and added garlic powder (and some chopped chives) to it.  I also used some herb seasoned  Pepperidge Farm stuffing which I crushed and used for the breading.  What you can do with the cream cheese filling is almost unlimited.  My recommendation would be to bake for 15 minutes at 375 degrees F and then use a thermometer to check the internal temp of the chicken.  This is very good but would be even better if cooked properly, so it ends up juicy.

I made a few minor changes... I used a Kraft garlic & parmesan [cream cheese] dip in the middle, I used Italian herb mix in place of the Italian seasoning, used plain bread crumbs, and I used only butter rather than butter and oil when I fried the chicken. Firstly, there was way too much "sprinkling" herbs - I only used a quarter of it, if that. I poured the butter from the pan over the chicken before baking it. It needed to be in the oven for 30 minutes and came out nicely. However I think the recipe calls for far too much garlic. I am usually quite insensitive to garlic but this really was too much. Next time I make it I will modify it and use my own herb/spice mixture. A good concept though, with some changes.

This was wonderful!  I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing I would change is doing the entire process of seasoning and stuffing the chicken one portion at a time, otherwise the seasoning came off the outside of the chicken breast.

This was o.k.  No one in my family was too thrilled with it.  I followed it to a tee but it was still too much garlic and I love garlic.  I doubt I'll make this one again.

This was a pretty good change, but if I make it again then I'll tweak the recipe some.  Maybe using a different kind of cheese, adding some lemon zest...

Super easy, and my family loved it. I used thin cut chicken breasts, and the oven time only took 15 minutes for super moist chicken! Next time I will venture out and try another flavor cheese spread, maybe roasted red pepper?? Delicious! You know it's good when the kids compliment it!

Eh....it was okay.  I was expecting that it would be amazing, seeing as how it involved cream cheese; but it was barely mediocre.  The italian seasoning didn't really work in this recipe, and there were none of the mentioned "drippings" to pour over the chicken before serving.  It was okay, but I won't make it again.

This was pretty easy to put together and the result was very tasty.  I used neufchatel cream cheese (less fat) because it was what I had on hand and it was good this way.  When I was done sprinkling the seasoning mixture on the chicken I had some left over so I tossed it into the bread crumbs before rolling the chicken in them.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil for easier clean up.  Served with parmesan risotto.  Great!

Yummy! Followed all the directions, just adjusted the filling to my taste. Added slivered sauteed mushrooms and shredded cheese to the cream cheese mixture and dipped in egg to keep the panko on.  My chx breasts were huge so took about 35 mins to reach 180 but they were so tender and juicy! Cut mine with a fork while I was eating it, will definitely make again! Thanks!

I took the essence of the recipe and put a twist on it.  I made my own cheese filling by using the last remains in the fridge of crumbled goat cheese and cottage cheese, seasoned it, and whipped them together. I also added fresh, chopped spinach before rolling the chicken. I got very positive reviews at dinner. I had company as well as three kids to please and I could have doubled the recipe. Thanks for the inspiration.

I've just made this, but my own way and it is SO GOOD!! I made my own garlic cream cheese with elephant garlic and shallots, then i rolled it up inside chicken that i sliced thin myself. I toothpicked them, dipped them into flour, egg, then breadcrums, all which were seasoned. Dropped them into oil in a dutch oven, and now they're delicious little morsels of chicken and cream cheese! I surprise myself sometimes! Also served with some asparagus with sour cream. I would have taken a photo but my husband and I destroyed it, it was just that good!

The chicken was wonderful and juicy, I only used half of the garlic power and onion salt and used regular bread crumbs. It doesn't really look like the picture though since you only use 1 tbsp cream cheese  per chicken breast. I didn't find the garlic over powering like some reviewers. I cooked it for 10 minutes on 400 and 10 minutes on 375. I agree with the reviewer who said there were no drippings. It says wait for the juices to run clear. What juices?

We didn't have garlic cream cheese where we live, so I had to substitute Philadelphia cream cheese's chive and onion. Similarly, we didn't have the correct bread crumbs, so we went with an Italian bread crumb. It was DELICIOUS. Definitely going to be a staple in our home!

I made this, but I tweaked it a bit, I added some sautéed spinach to the center as well. It turned out amazing. My husband loved it. I will definitely be cooking this again soon. Also, I didn’t freeze mine before cooking, I just went straight into cooking it after filling it, and didn’t have an issue. I just didn’t have the time to wait on it. But it turned out great!

I put the seasonings in the cream cheese and rolled it in buttermilk and flour (paprika & parmesan cheese), I didnt have any breadcrumbs. My husband raved about it. Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. Very good.

This was pretty delicious and filling. I had no toothpicks with me and had trouble to get it as a roll, even when I pounded on it. But I did swap the butter with a butter spray and used regular bread crumbs. The garlic cream cheese spread was okay.  I would make it again.

Made this exactly as was written and my hesitant family absolutely loved it!  Gotta flatten the chicken more, though....doesn't roll up easily when it's thick.

Eh this was okay. Not as delicious as I thought it would be looking at the pictures.  Wasn't really impressed.  Would not make again

I made this for my fiance on our anniversary and will definitely be making it again. Our store didn't have any garlic cream cheese so we used jalapeno instead. We both like spicy food so it was an ok compromise. I also added a little slap ya mama to the spices to give it some extra kick. The chicken was juicy and tender. I'm happy we didn't get garlic cream cheese because I think it would have been to much for us, but I urge everyone to try it with the jalapeno cream cheese. It was seriously one of the best chicken recipes I have made!

Despite that I forgot to add the final salt and pepper....this came out excellent! Served with a side of mixed salad greens and Parmesan Roasted tomatoes from this site. Excellent!

We found this chicken to be too dry and needed more cream cheese.I mostly followed the receipt but I didn't measure the garlic powder. I used garlic and herb cream cheese and about 3 tablespoons spread over large skinless breasts that had been pounded flat, rolled, and breaded. I didn't brown them in the butter but  used Pam spray on the oven pan and on top.

I think this needs a sauce of some kind. Maybe a cream of mushroom soup with parmesan cheese added to the baking dish. It was alright but next time I'd add more cream cheese and bake in a cream sauce.

Found this recipe and it sounded great. We decided to use pork chops instead of chicken. Used cream cheese and added minced garlic. Cut pockets into the chops and stuffed with the cream cheese mixture. Followed the rest of the recipe and waiting to eat.

I used thin sliced breasts and didn't pound them. I had regular cream cheese and seasoned it with garlic bread sprinkle. I browned in a cast iron pan for browning and then put the  whole pan in the oven.  It was great! I'll make this recipe often.

Instead of the pounding, I butterflied the Chicken breasts and also coated Chicken rolls in ranch dressing instead of the dry seasoning then into the bread crumbs (panko).  I did flavor plain cream cheese with fire roasted Tomato's  and slice of black forest ham. So good and great starting point ! Thanks

This was good and easy to make but it was missing something. Salt? Something else? I also thought the cheese would be creamier. I made it as written except I couldn’t find garlic flavored cream cheese so I added garlic powder to plain cream cheese.

I followed this recipe exactly using Perdue  Perfect Portion chicken breasts and Allouette garlic and herb spread cheese. I thought that the meal was delicious. And my husband said "it was excellent". So, I believe that the size of the chicken breast matters (mine were 4.5 oz to 4.8 oz and they cooked perfectly with these directions).

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have the cream cheese the recipe calls for so I just mixed minced garlic and Italian seasoning in some  plain cream cheese.  I also used garlic power instead of the onion powder to season the chicken,  and it was delicious.  I did leave the chicken in a few minutes longer than the recipe said but the chicken was cooked through and nice and juicy.  Even the kids and my picky husband liked it.  I will be making this again!

The only change I made was to use Panko bread crumbs.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly.  The chicken was moist and tender and delicious.  The cream cheese oozed out a little bit, so I spread it across the top of the chicken before serving.

This was yummy! The only changes I made was I used regular cream cheese instead of garilc  cream cheese and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because that was what I had on hand. I also cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes because I was worried 400 might dry it out.

This was great! I used three chicken breasts but only pounded to 1/2 inch ( read the recipe wrong) so it took about 40 minutes to cook.. but it was so worth the wait! I used Onion and Chive cream cheese and Panko crumbs (added in my own seasoning). I am a cream cheese freak, not to mention I'm pregnant, and my husband was in awe of me scarfing it down. Delish!

I didn't use egg before frying. When frying I put one side spices, one side breadcrumbs. Turned out great! I might try following the recipe next time.

This recipe is SO delicious and easier to make than I thought! I made it for my boyfriend and we are both hooked. I couldn't find garlic cream cheese so I just mixed the cream cheese with garlic salt. This is definitely happening again in our house!!
