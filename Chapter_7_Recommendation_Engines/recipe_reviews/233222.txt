This was a fun and easy meal for the kids.  However, it was very heavy on the bread.  Next time, I would split the muffins in half.  That way you make 20 and it tastes more pizza-y and less biscuit-y.

I wanted a simple recipe that my 3-year-old could help me make and this was perfect. I didn't want the pizza too bready so I peeled the biscuit in half before my daughter flattened and pressed it into the muffin tin. My daughter could do every part of this recipe, except put it in the oven and take it out. She was so proud that she made dinner for the family.

These freeze beautifully. I double the recipe, use whatever pizza toppings I have on hand, and throw them bad boys in a freezer bag. Perfect for the kids lunch!

I followed the recipe but used Newman's Own Fra Diavolo (hot and spicy) sauce. It was AMAZING!!!!! My boyfriend and I work late, so we're always looking for easy dinners to cook. This was perfect. Almost too good.

This was great. I am always looking for an easy snack for our weekly MahJongg game.  Something  inexpensive, easy , but good of course. This completely fit the bill. I sprinkled a small amount of Italian seasoning on each one.  Everyone loved them.  It gave me ideas for other combos. Thank you.

I made these yesterday for my mom and kids.  They were simple to put together, and needed very little cleanup or prep time.  My mom said she liked them and kids were happy, which is always great.  I used my favorite pizza sauce (Classico brand) and made some with pepperoni and some with broccoli.  This is an easily customized recipe to make any style pizza desired.  I appreciate the idea of using biscuits in muffin cups to make cute little mini-pizzas.

These were so simple, easy and delicious! I was asked to bring an appetizer for Mother's Day and being 9 months pregnant I really did not feel like being in the kitchen that day. I saw this recipe in the magazine and decided to try it. SO glad I did!! Everyone loved them. I cut the biscuits in half after reading other reviews and omitted the pepperoni (only because I did not have any). I filled each biscuit cup with chunky marinara sauce baked them for 10 minutes then topped them with grated mozzarella and baked them for another 3 minutes until the cheese melted. Perfect! Definitely will be making these again! The addition of your favorite pizza options are endless for a customized appetizer.

These were delicious! We used one package of flaky layered biscuit dough and it worked well. We used about half of the biscuit and then stretched them to fit in the muffin pan. We also added more pepperoni layered in between two layers of sprinkled cheese. Next time we'll use some more pizza sauce. 

It's important to let them cool, otherwise you could burn your mouth (my boyfriend learned the hard way).

No changes made!  My 3 and 5 yr olds helped make it and it was super easy and fairly mess free.  We had lunch on the table in less than 20 minutes! Will definitely make these again!

Instead of biscuit dough I used the can pizza dough. It cuts down on the " bread" overload. I use silicone baking cups and don't need to spray the cups. Add cooked mushrooms, chopped salami or pepperoni, diced cooked green peppers or whatever you want.

Thank you for this recipe. We make these all the time, a great portable snack. We also serve them at our kids' parties, and kids always love them. Sometimes we make them in mini-muffin tins so they'll be appetizer sized. We do use homemade pizza dough instead of canned biscuit dough, and they rise up high.

Fantastic! I used the regular biscuits, not the Grands, and cut them in half. Didn't bake for the whole ten minutes nor did i let the dough rise for five minutes. They turned out just fine. The only complaint the family had with them was they disappeared too fast!

The pizza was easy and delicious. It works with lots of cheeses. Liked how it was soft and puffy like a pillow. You should try this easy recipe.

This recipe was easy, healthy, inexpensive, anyone can make it, and its a good way to let your kids help with dinner or a snack. You can add whatever toppings or even use pizza dough, its all up to you and what you want to add.

This was simple and very enjoyable. It tasted like biscuits as it should have and the frozen mini pizzas that you would always get for lunch. All in all, it was very tasty and easy to make.

They were good but were not cooked all the way. They looked cooked on the outside but doughy inside.  Would make again but would cook for longer.

We give this five stars because it was really enjoyable, especially with the pepperoni. I just think if we cooked it longer it would be better.

These turned out great. I recommend that if using "Grand" size biscuits, you should use a large muffin pan. Otherwise regular biscuits are better. Less beady. Wonderful idea & easy to make vegetarian.

These were Delicious little bites! I split the biscuits into 3 so I got 24 little pizzas. Not too bready. My grand daughter and I made these for "movie night".  We put 1 slice of pepperoni on hers,  and 1 slice of mushroom and 1 slice of pepperoni on ours. The mushroom and pepperoni were the best!  I made Chef John's homemade pizza sauce from this site. The only problem was that I had a terrible time getting these out of the muffin pans. I sprayed liberally with Pam olive oil. Any suggestions? I ate way too many of these, so yummy!

Very quick and easy! Also fun to switch up with different toppings. It's having a small buffet of muffin sized pizzas.

Very tasty, and very easy! I cut the biscuit dough in half horizontally to make the muffins a little less doughy. I also threw in some other toppings along with the pepperoni. I’d make this again, for sure!

My young grandchildren helped make these, which took only a few minutes. They liked the finished product. A fast, easy meal that's very kid-friendly.

Something the kids will eat....YAY!!! These were cute, easy to make, and if the kids will eat it, it's a success. I used smaller biscuits, and they were like little deep dish pizzas. If you like a thin crust, you may want to use a 1/2 biscuit in each muffin cup.

6.15.17   I was in another room when the timer went off, didn’t hear it and, unfortunately, my muffins overcooked a little.  In spite of that, they still were pretty good and very easy to make, a yummy treat for children.

I made 10 ( one can of biscuits) to start out. I did use more peperoni than called for. And then our son came in!
I ended up running to the store and getting a can of large biscuits. I had plenty of sauce and pepperoni and stuff.
Cutting the large canned biscuits in half and making everything the same, i ended up making 26 of these.
I ended with 6 left over, and i only ate 1.
I barely got them out of the oven before they were gobbled up.
Thats a good recipe!

Made them three times.  The first time I use the entire biscuit and found them a bit doughy.  Then following suggestions by other reviewers, I cut the biscuits in half and voila - perfect.  The hardest part of making this recipe is opening the tin of unbaked muffins!

Yummy easy meal! I took the often-mentioned suggestion from other reviewers to divide the biscuit dough in half and it was good. I also added minced veggies and fresh basil and parsley to the mix to pump up the flavors. Looking forward to lunch leftovers of this tomorrow!
