It was delicious!  I ad libbed a bit..one can orange juice concentrate, one can lime-aid concentrate (it is what I had in the house), and probably 1 and 1/2 cups Crown Royal...I keep in the fridge and when the mood strikes, use one part whiskey sour mix with one part ice and one part water....

Finally, a great recipe to make a drinkable whiskey sour, even in cold weather when we in Ohio are offered lemons at $5/bag. This is easy, no fuss, and convenient on the refills. Bless YOU. The only thing I would change next time is add about 1/2 more whiskey. THe recipe is not strong, which is good for a crowd. Thanks again.

I didn't need 26 cups of whiskey sour's, so I scaled this recipe down using AR's "change servings" feature.  I think the ingredient proportions are really off on this recipe.  There's too much orange juice and water, and not enough lemonade and bourbon.  It tasted watered down and almost void of any bourbon.  I made adjustments, so it was drinkable, but I won't be making this again.  Sorry CookingGirl for the bad review, but this was a disappointment.

Not strong enough.  Tasted like spiked orange juice.

Delicious!  Especially coming from someone who is not a fan of whiskey.  This recipe is perfect!
