Delicious!  I can't give this enough stars.  I am going to make this for a girls night next week, I think everyone will like it too. UPDATE:I make this with limeade instead of pink lemonade, get the real lime stuff, not the acid green stuff made with food coloring.  I like it even better now.

This wasn't my favorite recipe ever but my husband LOVED them. So I'll be making them again. :) I used fresh strawberries that weren't too sweet so next time I'll try frozen strawberries in syrup.  Super easy to make, definitely worth a try!

Very tasting margarita and my first time making one! I had to borrow the alcohol mix from a neighbor to make it. I will keep this in mind for any future summer parties!

I decided to make this when having company over for dinner (chicken fajitas, black bean tacos, and Mexican rice).  EVERYONE loved the margaritas!  I ended up making another pitcher, and there wasn't a drop left at the end of the evening.  This is a SUPER recipe!!
