This was a very easy accompaniment to the mahi but I changed it slightly due to the ingredients I had on hand.  I added diced jalapeno and used crushed pineapple, frozen mango chunks and omitted the red wine because I didn't have any.

I loved this recipe. My bf and I made this with frozen vaccuum sealed Mahi and I didn't think it was going to be that great but even with the frozen fish it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was wonderful. I don't have a big sweet tooth and thought the brown sugar was going to be a little much but it just carmelizes the onions and has a subtle hint of sweetness. Great with brown rice and a salad. We will definitely be making this again.

My husband suggested mahi mahi last night, so I went on the hunt for an easy recipe...I purchased cubed fresh pineapples and cut up mango to make it easier..(next time I will go with mango salsa to save prep time)..all in all took about 40 minutes between preparation and cooking time. Looked absolutely gourmet and was cooked to perfection. I followed the recipe closely (just added fresh pineapple verses canned) and it wasn't too spicy with a touch of sweetness.. "tastes like it came out of a restaurant" was my husbands comment and he wanted more when we were finished! Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Whole family loved it, and it was pretty simple.  I'd never made fruit salsa, anything blackened, or Mahi Mahi, but it all worked great; it's now a special-occassion favorite!  I used Toms Blackened Seasoning from this sight.

This was super! I made my own blackening spices.  The mango/pineapple salsa would also be great on chicken, salmon and even pork.  Will be adding this to my recipe box.

I only made the salsa and found it simple to make and sweet.  A little too sweet for me so I suggest only adding 1 TBSP of brown sugar initially then adding more after the pineapple and mango have been added until it meets your preference.  I served this with a white fish and it added flavor to a bland fish.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written using a blackening seasoning mix I had premade. Like another reviewer, I used frozen mahi mahi steaks. I served them with with coconut rice, sweet potatoes and broccoli florets for a tasty, easy meal. My husband and 13 year old loved it. Definitely a keeper!

For a short cut, add Newman's Mango salsa instead. Save you a few extra steps.

My wife was leaving for work and I asked her what she wanted for dinner and she jokingly said "blackened mahi mahi with mango salsa".  So I looked this up;  made it;  and she thought it was the best thing she ever ate! It really was great and will definitely make it again.

My husband loved it and it was easy so it was a win win. I have been doing Paleo and substituted coconut oil for the olive oil (used only 1.5 teaspoons for each part) and substituted 3 packets of agave for the brown sugar.  This is a keeper!

Did this recipe with fresh mango and pineapple.  My wife loved it and so did I accept I should leave out the brown sugar and use a little maple syrup because I am diabetic.  Made a coconut rice to go with it.

I made this with a couple of variations. I added red bell pepper along with the onion. I used a frozen mango medley that included peaches and strawberries. I used a splash of white wine instead of red. It was delicious!

Delicious as is. Starts of sweet then you get a spicy kick from the blackening seasoning. Made with wild rice & a salad. This meal will be on our regular rotation.

Great recipe. I used Tom’s Blackened seasoning from this site. Mango salsa was good but I prefer the pineapple habenaro from Costco.

I made this exactly as written, and my family loved it. The mango salsa was almost too much for the fish, though.  We all wished that I had put it on the side so we could really taste the fish. With that said I will make this again!

I love blackened dolphin, but the salsa is what makes this recipe.  It was delicious.  There are may recipes for blackening rub.  Pick one that you like.  Then use this salsa and it is a definite winner.

Delicious meal but instead of blackening and sautéing the mahi mahi I used a chile lime rub and grilled it, using my new pampered chef fish grilling cage. The salsa turned out OK, but next time I will replace the onion with a green onion and sauté a shallot with the brown sugar and then add a jalapeño and cilantro to kick it up and further compliment the sweetness of the pineapple and mango. All in all it was a great, easy meal and goes well with grilled broccoli with garlic, salt and pepper.

Really good recipe and easy to follow. I prefer my food a little spicier so if you're like me just add some Cajun seasoning.

Just made this tonight for dinner. It was my first time using fresh mango for anything. Took a minute to figure out how to de-pit it without mangling the fruit but was so worth it!! This was a very easy recipe and my husband, who's notoriously skeptical of anything new, loved it! Will definitely make this again soon.

tasted great..a bit too spicy for my husband but was perfect for my taste.  Will probably use less blackening seasoning next time.  served with sticky rice.
