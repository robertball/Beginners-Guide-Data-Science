This has a great tasting dressing! I didn't add quite as many veggies as the recipe but it was still good. I'm not even a fan of pasta salads but have made it 3 times in 2 weeks. Thanks Sylvia

This is a good base recipe, but I found the dressing way too sweet.  It was much better with 1/2 the sugar plus garlic and herbs.

Love the dressing in this. I used Hellman's Just 2 Good mayo and varied the veggies for what I had on hand --was great!

This is a wonderful conbination of ingredients.  However, it calls for too much pasta.  Uncooked pasta expands double, or more, when cooked. Six cups pasta, plus all the vegetables, certainly would serve more than 6.  (When you lower the amount of pasta, the calorie contents changes!)

Very good pasta salad. The only changes that I make are adding black olives and using fat-free Italian for the dressing. I used tri-color pasta.

This was really a good recipe.  I made it just as written, leaving out the mushrooms because I'm allergic to them.  My family loved it.  Light and tasty and filling.  I did use whole wheat pasta, which made it more healthy.  Was very good.  Will definitely keep this one for future use.

Really good!  The dressing is just like the traditional broccoli salad that I love, but no cheese or bacon or raisins.  Any of those items would go great in this and maybe make it taste even better, but I like this one because I felt good about eating it with out all the fatty additions, and it still tasted great. Even my picky friends went back for seconds.  I didn't have cauliflower, so I doubled the broccoli.  Good stuff.

Great base recipe for any number of veggies depending on your personal taste. I made the dressing exactly as stated in the recipe, and it was absolutely perfect. The only changes I made were omitting carrots, mushrooms and cauliflower because I didn't have them. Served it at a party last night and everyone loved it.

Very good. I liked all the veggies. I used only 2 c. pasta to up the veggie/pasta ratio. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I feel it could use some herbs for some more flavor, but this is a good starting point!

The sweet and tangy dressing is what makes any combo of veggies taste awesome.  This recipe is similar to the broccoli salads I've mad in the past.  I didn't have all the veggies so I used rotini pasta, peas, broccoli, red onion, bacon, cashews and the dressing.  It was a big hit at the baby shower I took it to.  I add the cashews and bacon right before serving to keep them from going soggy. I'll keep coming back to this one!

Delicious! Omitted celery, broccoli and cauliflower for personal taste and used a full 12oz box of pasta. Will probably add some garlic/herbs next time.

Great pasta salad recipe!  I loved all the veggies in it, although I left out the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  I did put in some halved cherry tomatoes, though, and it was really good.  I had to increase the dressing a bit since I was making more, but it turned out nice and light.  I used whole-wheat pasta, and we really liked it.  I can't wait to taste it today for lunch after it's been sitting for a bit.  Great recipe!

Took this to a large gathering, everyone raved about it.  I used less pasta than the recipe called for and I used brocaflower instead of brocalli and cauliflower.

A nice pasta salad loaded with 8 vegetables. I added radishes in place of the mushrooms.  The dressing is very similar to the dressing that goes on a broccoli salad.  We liked the salad, but thought it lacked seasoning.  Salt and pepper just weren't enough.  It is definitely better the second day.

Excellent recipe. I also cut the sugar in about 1/2 and left out mushrooms.   Other than that, this is my 'Go To' pasta salad recipe.

Made this recipe with varied vegetables and Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I found it to be WAY too sweet and thick of a sauce; probably would be much better with an oil and vinegar based dressing.

This is a great basic recipe which you can tweak out according to individual tastes, I backed off on some of the carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, added olives and a dash of oregano and garlic powder and it was great, too. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I thought that this was okay.  I thought it tasted kind of plain.  I let mine sit in the fridge overnight and it made the veggies tender but not soggy.

I thought this recipe was really enjoyable. The only vegetables I had in the fridge were broccoli, carrots and celery. It still turned out great! I will try it again using all of the ingredients...raisins would be good in it too I think. The dressing would also be good to just dip raw veggies into. Oh and I didn't use quite 1/4 cup of vinegar...a little less...just to taste.

Added a few more vegetables and a little less pasta and sprinkled shredded Parmesan on top.
I served it as a main course with bread.

I really liked this although it did take me some time to cut up all the veggies but it was well worth it. My husband thought this was a great change to the usual side dish of rice or veggies.  I think next time I may add more vinegar and less sugar because it was on the sweet side. Someone compared the dressing to that in the broccoli salad and that is accurate. I would make it again!!

I made this with less pasta and used whole wheat spirals and splenda instead of sugar.  It took a lot of time to cut, slice and chop all the vegetables, but it was tasty.  I made a batch without pasta and only 1/2 the dressing for a work lunch and several people liked it.  I like broccoli, cauliflower, raisin, bacon salad just as well and it takes less time but this was nice for a change.

Very good, and so easy!  I made it even easier by using a mix of frozen vegetables that I cooked for a minute or so, just to unfreeze them.  I used less mayo and sugar, for a lighter salad, and it's very tasty!

This is a great recipe.  Sometimes I don't want the pasta and it tastes great over fresh broccoli which you can mix in red onion, cashews, and craisins

I love this easy twist to a seven layer salad minus the lettuce.  Can be whipped up with everything you already have in the crisper and pantry.  Great summer salad although I'm sure I'll make it all winter too!

I left out the bell pepper, mushrooms and onions and steamed the other vegetables for a couple of minutes beforehand.  I also added sliced black olives.  I found this recipe very appetising for something so healthy and relatively simple to make.  Although the dressing is basic, it is very good and complements the salad well.
