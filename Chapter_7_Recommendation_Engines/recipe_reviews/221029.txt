This recipe is awesome.  I got some bok choy with my CSA and while I've eaten it, I've never prepared it.  I found this recipe and realized I had all of the ingredients already so I settled on this for my inaugural run with bok choy.  I only made a couple of changes - my bok choy wasn't as big as I think the recipe calls for, so I halved the dressing and only used two packets of ramen noodles (full amount of butter, though.  Hehe.)  Other than that, I had to use white wine vinegar because I didn't have any red wine vinegar.  Finally, I tossed in some shrimp to make it more of a dinner salad.  The end result blew my mind.  I was nervous about the ramen noodle mixture, but it turned out so well that my husband and I were just eating it straight off the cookie sheet.  Speaking of the hubs, I fully expected him to refuse to eat it, but he ate it and requested I make it again the very next night. And the kicker about this recipe is that it's so EASY!  The proportions of the dressing are spot on - even when I halved it.  This was a delicious, quick weeknight meal that I know will please the picky husband, so thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was great! I subbed pine nuts for sunflower seeds and only used 2 packs of ramen, but I'm a new lover of bok choy!! And so is my boyfriend! Super easy, next time I might throw in some craisins, but other than that, we skipped the "main course" and just polished off the salad.

I used these ingredients, but cooked it differently, so I'm not even sure it counts as the same recipe anymore. I modified it to make it easy enough for my kids to make on their own as an afternoon snack. I put the ramen noodles in a pot of water with the bok choy in a steamer above them, covered the pot, and put that on a burner. Then I put 2 tablespoons sugar and a pinch of salt in a pan, tossed in 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup of almonds. I let that caramelize, which took 2-3 minutes. Then I strained the steamed noodles, put both the noodles and bok choy in a bowl, drizzled the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and soy sauce over them, and tossed it all with the sunflower seeds and almonds. My kids have already made this on their own once since the first time we tried it. From start to finish it takes 5-10 minutes.
