Fantastic recipe!  I used Cayan Pepper instead of curry.  Has a great little kick.  Next time I will use just a little bit less pepper as my kids found it a little spicy.  But the ate every little piece and asked for more.  VERY yummy recipe!!  Will definitely make again and again!

This was quick, easy and tasty. I think leftovers might make for some good chicken salad as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Thankfully I'm not the first one to prepare or rate this recipe.  I took advice from several different reviews and here is my variation:  Spray the baking dish with cooking spray, substitute half the butter with EVOO, increase the honey to 3 Tbsp, add 1/2 tsp each of ginger and garlic powder to the other sauce ingredients.  Bake as described, my chicken pieces were large and took a full hour to cook.  When the chicken is finished baking remove from baking dish, put chicken aside to rest, with a rubber scraper transfer the sauce and drippings into a sauce pan.  Whisk 1 tsp of corn starch into 3 oz of cold white wine.  Mix this into the sauce and drippings and heat until sauce thickens.  Serve the thickened sauce over the chicken or as a dipping sauce.  Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm! The side dishes served were buttered carrots and Jasmine white rice.  Mmmm^3

Followed recipe exactly. The breasts were thick so it took closer to an hour to fully cook but these were moist and delicious! I'm wondering if they were marinated in the sauce for several hours if it would be even better. I'm saving the leftover drippings to add to a soup later this winter.**Update**Making this for the 3rd or 4th time in a month. My son specifically asked for this meal. It's definitely a keeper!

I added a 1/2 cup of coconut milk, and 2 Tablespoons of flour to thicken it. I steamed broccoli with it. It was good, reminded me of a peanut sauce Thai dish.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The sauce was good but runny. It looked very unimpressive when I took it out of the oven. It was tasty, but here are a few suggestions... I was steaming broccoli to have on the side & decided to add it to the casserole dish after it was out of the oven. The broccoli soaked up the sauce & was good. I served it with rice. I topped it with some fresh cracked pepper, some parsley  & added some crushed peanuts. Turned a blah looking dish into a totally impressive one. My husband loved it. I may try one other reviewers stove top method next time.

I am not exactly sure what I was expecting.  I chose this recipe based on the ease of it versus other similar recipes.  Followed the recipe as written and it smelled wonderful while cooking.  I was just disappointed in the sauce being so runny and the lack of flavor.  While not a complete disaster, this one will need some tweaking before being worked into the dinner rotation.

This is a delicious recipe! I did everything the recipe called for except I made it on the stove instead of in the oven.  I only had thin cuts of chicken and I was afraid of them drying out in the oven. Also, this cuts down on the cooking time.  I put the chicken and in a covered frying pan and cooked on medium heat for about 10-15 min, flipping them every 5 or so minutes. I then lowered the heat and uncovered for 5 more minutes to allow the sauce to thicken.  

The sauce is the best part!  I made this with some rice-a-roni and everyone ended up pouring sauce on the rice.  It was the best rice-a-roni ever!  I also made it with creamed spinach.  We had no leftovers! 

The spinach recipe I used was Emeril's creamed spinach from the food network.  It's an amazing creamed spinach recipe and the spices of the chicken and the nutmeg in the spinach work very well together.

We didn't have curry powder, so I used cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and red pepper. Came out great! I think next time though, I'll chop up the chicken first, because there were a couple little pieces in there, and they came out bursting with flavor!

Just whipped this up. It came out great! Chicken was soft and tastes delicious. I baked the chicken as recommended but I covered it with foil for 30 minutes, basted it after that time, turned it over and then put it in the oven uncovered. After 5 minutes I turned the chicken over and placed it back in the oven.  After it browned (not sure exact time, maybe 10 minutes) I poked the chicken (topside) with a fork and basted it again. Put it back in the oven uncovered and turned off the stove. Let it stay for another 10 minutes or so then took it out, basted and let cool down. Important note: I did this with the breasts and thighs. Also, I threw in some onion, garlic and black pepper to some of the marinade to put over the rice.  That I did not try but I'm sure it will taste fine. Happy eats!

I did make these on the stovetop, pan searing boneless breasts for a few mins with a bit of the butter. Poured sauce over top, covered for about 20 mins. Turned out moist and flavorful. I will probably make them  again using oven method, but I only had the boneless breasts and it just seemed to be the way to go. Also only had 4 breast halves,and it was just enough sauce.

great recipe. i adjusted the servings to 3, used 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of honey, kept the rest of the adjusted measurements the same. I cooked it in the oven - covered for 30 minutes, then flipped and uncovered for 10 minutes. The sauce was runny, so i removed the chicken from the pan and added some wondra flour to the sauce, thickened up great! served with corn and jasmine brown rice. definitely a do again.

I thought this was good. My husband, who is not a big chicken fan and rarely comments on meals besides BBQ steak, instantly said it was "awesome" and commented twice on it. So, I figured 5 stars to cover the family response. Both kids like it a lot, too. I made it as directed but poured the sauce off and thickened it with cornstarch at the end of the baking and then poured it back over the chicken.

I halved the sauce recipe for 2 chicken breasts. It was the perfect amount. Instead of using the amount of salt called for, I just salted my chicken breasts. I loved the flavor of the sauce on this chicken. At the end of the baking time, I added a little cornstarch to it to thicken it up. Perfect over rice or potatoes.

Delicious! I made it on the stove after reading another review. I also added the 1/2 c. (lite) coconut milk and 1T flour per another suggestion. After tasting, added a little more honey. I served this with roasted potatoes, but it would have been perfect with jasmine rice. Next time!

Very good.  I would pound the breasts to make them a bit thinner and also dredge them in flour to thicken the sauce the next time I make it.  Very nice flavor!

I agree with others about the runniness of the sauce, but I attributed that to the fact that I cooked this on stovetop. I used Dijon mustard but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was tasty and quick and easy, and there's a lot to be said for that!  The sauce would be good thickened a tad and maybe doubled so you could pour some over rice or potatoes.  Hubby liked it, so that was all that mattered!

This was awesome! Only made 2 chicken breast an didn't bake. I made them on the stove top. I cut them into small cubes and marinated them for about an hour before cooking. I did make some small changes by taking the advise of other reviews. I ommitted the curry powder since my husband is not a fan of it and added less than 1/2tsp of cayanne pepper. I did keep about the same amount of the honey and used about 2Tsp of honey mustard and about 2tsp of prepared mustard, less than a tsp of salt. Mixed all ingredients together then added in the chicken and marinated about an hour before cooking. Towards the end I added about a tsp of cornstarch thicken up the sauce since it does stay very liquidy.  Other than that this was very simply to make and delicious. Served with rice and broccolli as side dishes. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe last night and I loved it.  I made the same modifications that a few other people did: I replaced the curray with just under half a teaspoon of cayanne pepper; I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and cooked it on the stove; I also added bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce at the end.
I served it on a bed of rice with broccoli.  I don't like mustard, but I like honey mustard.

What a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe. I followed another reviewers suggestion and made this on the stove. I mixed all ingredients listed and added 5 good shakes of cayenne pepper. I placed 4 chicken breasts (1/2 inch in thickness) in a 12" fry pan so they were not crowded and poured the mixture of ingredients on top. Covered the pan and cooked on medium heat for a total of 30 minutes, flipping the breasts every 5 minutes. I then removed the cover and cooked for another 5 minutes. I removed the breasts and kept them warm in a corning ware and threw into the sauce mixture a bag of frozen broccoli (unthawed). I brought the sauce up to a boil over high heat, lowered to medium and covered for 4 minutes, then I removed the cover and cooked them another 3 minutes. I plated the chicken, used a slotted spoon and covered the chicken with the broccoli. I had exactly one cup of sauce left. I wish I would've made rice!!! I ladled a bit of the sauce over our plates and my husband said "boy this good" about 5 times.
I hope I did not write too much to discourage you from reading this review.

I have made this recipe for years (with dijon mustard), originally using a whole cut up chicken, basting it every 15 minutes until chicken is nicely browned. Yes, the sauce is a bit runny but serve the chicken over a bed of rice spooning some sauce over the chicken and rice. I promise you it is delicious!

Made this for my family last night and it was a hit. Yes, the sauce is thin, but that was fine with us because it was soooooo tasty.  I baked 3 medium sized chicken breasts as directed at 350, and it took roughly 50 minutes to bake.  The chicken was so moist and tender - perfect!  My stepdaughter especially loved this dish and was spooning the sauce generously on the chicken.  I served with sweet potato fries because I thought the sauce would be great for dipping the fries into (it was).  Thanks for a great recipe!  Will definitely be making this frequently.

This wasnt bad but it was just ok, not one that I would go crazy about making again or being requested by my family to make.  I made it exactly like the recipe said I should had read some of the other reviews first and made some changes.  It was definitely easy to make...

Very good recipe! The chicken turned out very tender. The ONLY change I made to the recipe is I took another reviewers advice and added garlic powder. But for me it was a personal preference because I love garlic. Thank you for the recipe. It’s a keeper!

I never have curry on hand, however I always have Cayenne, so that was totally on me. Apart from that, the sauce in this recipe is f-ing great!!! I mean, it's super tasty. I use it all the time.

This is going in my weekly rotation. I took the advice of other reviews and made it like so: I made the ingredients as listed, I mixed the sauce ingredients in a mixing bowl with the chicken breast tenderloins, then put it all in a deep pan on the stovetop and covered. I added turmeric for the health benefits and thought it would mix well with these flavors. When the chicken was cooked, I put the juices in a saucepan with 1tsp of corn starch and 1/3 cup white wine, and 1tsp turmeric. Boiled until thick. The chicken was so tender, I cut it into cubes. I served over rice with the sauce in a dipping bowl on the side for my family. I served my chicken over salad with a bit of the sauce as dressing, it’s so delicious!

This is a very easy, very good, weeknight, go-to recipe.  Here are a few tips that I've used to improve upon its basic nature.

1. You're already not eating beef, you might as well just get thighs. They're small. Stop freaking out. Just tell them it's breast meat and they'll love you for it.
2. The recipe calls for 1 tsp salt. Who wrote this recipe, an elk? I use 1/4 tsp and it's perfect.
3. I add in 1/4 tsp of freshly shaved ginger
4. I also add in 2-3 tsp of soy sauce. If you go for 3 tsp, you might want to cut the salt even more.
5. I also add a pinch to 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch more curry. We like da spicy. 

This, with a small dollop of perfectly prepared rice  (a high quality rice cooker is not cheating) and a nice, cold, simple salad with a oil-based but light and spiced dressing, and you're good to go.

Does it seem plain or runny to you?  Well stop mucking with it while it's baking!  Before I put it into the oven I *completely* baste it. Lay the filets with the side down where skin used to be and get all your sauce in all the nooks and meaty crannies. Then fold each thigh over. Cover the facing side with sauce. Then flip it and cover some more.  Now it's ready for the oven. Leave it in there for 20 min without doing a thing until the initial basting has cooked and dried onto the top of the chicken.  Quickly re-baste.  Give it another 10, or 15 depending upon the size of your pieces. Sometimes this is all it needs. Sometimes I'll rebaste a few times towar

Great recipe! I used vegan butter because of allergies and I did cut the amount in half. Everything else I kept the same. Used boneless chicken breasts and it was so good! Was looking for something different to do with chicken, but one that the whole family would like. Will definitely be making again.

A great Sunday dinner recipe. We enjoyed the aroma as this baked. As others have suggested, we added garlic powder and ginger. We doubled the recipe. We used Dijon mustard and honey mustard, but any mustard would work. At the end we removed the chicken to a warmed casserole dish and added a flour-water slurry to thicken the sauce.  That made the sauce turn creamy; I might use cornstarch and water next time.  As another suggested, some red pepper would be fun too. I would serve this at a dinner party since it makes the house smell so good.

It was easy, and looked great coming out of the oven.  One son said it had a bit of an "eggy" taste. I attribute  that to  his tasting the butter so intensely, with his school age palate.  (We're working on widening their tastes.  Picky eating is so obnoxious.).   One son, on the other hand, asked if I could  make the sauce alone, for a dip.  Thus 4 stars .

I didn't have curry so I also used cayan pepper otherwise followed recipe. I followed advise of others and cut my chicken into small pieces and cooked it on the stove top. I didn't have the problem of thin sauce. Cooked covered on medium low for about 20 minutes and then removed lid and cooked for 5 minutes more. Sauce was more of a glaze. It was very yummy.

I substituted butter for coconut oil.  It was easy and delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  The chicken breast were large so I cut in half lengthwise and only made 1/3 of recipe for 2 of us. My husband liked it too.

Only had two chicken breasts, so I halved the sauce. Very tasty, but I covered the chicken because the sauce was evaporating quickly. Will make again regularly.

Used a little less butter and included some chicken legs. I broiled the chicken for the last 2 minutes to crisp the skin a little. VERY good! Served with lemon basmati rice (recipe on this site).

I was really excited to try this recipe but the sauce had NO taste to it whatsoever. :( really disappointing. the chicken was nice and juicy but was really hoping to taste at least ONE of the ingredients in the sauce. :/

This recipe was awesome! I really didn't think I would care for it, because I usually don't like baked chicken recipes. They usually seem dry and blend, but this recipe really delivered. I used coconut oil instead of butter, because that's what I had on hand. I also sprinkled a little ginger in. The recipe made a ton of sauce and I didn't use it all, so I probably could have cut it down a little bit. The flavors were great and we ate every bit!

The chicken came out bland, and the sauce was runny and the curry flavor was not noticeable.  To fix the sauce, I dumped it in a pot and thickened it with a slurry.  I also added WAY more curry powder, as well as some red pepper flakes.  Prior to cooking, the chicken should be seasoned with salt and pepper.  Next time I think I will pound the chicken a little and cook it on the stovetop.  My sauce came out delish after I tinkered with it a bit.

Super simple recipe that was very tasty! I might try marinating the chicken in the sauce prior to baking next time, just to see if would infuse a little more flavor - or you can always thicken the baking juices on the stove with some flour/water paste or cornstarch/water paste whisked in, and boil to thicken if you want to serve it with sauce. My husband, son, and I all enjoyed the simplicity of this dish and the blend of flavors. The curry powder gave it a nice hint of "zing" without being overpowering!

Simple and easy to throw together. I thought it was fine, liked the curry aroma and taste. My family totally loved it. I only thought it was okay, but even a kid that stated the night with one of my children, said it rocked....hmm wow. Okay, I guess it was better the I thought. ;-) SO it will be on the menu again. TY

I loved the sauce, though I don't usually like mustard. I think it would have better, though, had I sliced the chicken breasts thinner or cut them up, as others have suggested. They were rather tough. (But that could be because of microwave thawing.) Would be good with rice.

The chicken came out really good. The chicken was filled with the same of the sauce after it came out of the oven. I will try to cut the chicken into little pieces so that more of the chicken can be cover in the delicious sauce!
