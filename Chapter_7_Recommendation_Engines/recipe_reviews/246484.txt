One bite in and Hubby said I could make this again.  I only made 1 small change.  I used both sharp Cheddar and Swiss cheese.  Awesome!

This was delicious.  I used turkey peppered bacon and a mix of  shredded cheddar and jack cheese. I dont know if  the recipe submitted intended them to be able to be eaten out of hand as a sandwich, but I was able to do that with mine.  If you want something you can eat with a fork, I'd say add more eggs and milk .. I had this for dinner with some homemade tomato soup

Made this for a Christmas Brunch - What a Hit!! I changed it up a bit. I used Sourdough bread instead of white. I used both Sharp Cheddar & Swiss Cheese slices. I forgot to buy shredded cheddar, so I just used more slices (I broke apart 2 slices of cheddar and scattered them around on top). I didn't use bacon or milk. I just whisked 7 eggs with S&P and poured that on top. Next time I won't add the cheese on top till the last 5 minutes as it all ended up sticking to the top of the foil, so I didn't bother with letting it get bubbly & golden.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a potluck with tomato soup and came home with an empty dish! It's time consuming, but not difficult at all.  I used less bacon and crumbled it on the first layer rather than putting ham an bacon all on the second.  Really really good!!!

We were in the mood for grilled cheese and found this. Itâ€™s like grilled cheese on steroids. Very good very satisfying. Even better the next morning for breakfast. Did just about what the recipe said except substituted white American cheese for the cheddar at the bottom. Used cheddar shredded throughout the rest of the dish very good will make again
