I tried this recipe as is and found it a tad too sweet, and a bit bland as far as flavour goes.  It was very moist however so I tried again, using 3/4 cup of sugar instead.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon.  They came out perfect!  Yummy:)

Excellent!!!  Even my husband who is not a banana muffin eater love them!!!!  I did shorten the cooking time to 25 minutes.

One tip...Freeze old bananas.  Just peel and put in a zip lock bag for future use.

Thanks! Karen

Really delicious banana bread in muffin form.  Just a tad too sweet--maybe I'll use less sugar next time--but very tasty.  I'll probably make this more than once.

I used whole wheat flour, added a tsp. of baking powder and a tsp. vanilla, and cut the sugar in half. I substituted half homemade organic applesauce for half the oil. We don't like walnuts so I used pecans. I think because I used whole wheat flour it was a little dry, so I had to add a half cup of buttermilk. I got twelve big muffins out of this recipe. This was a quick and simple recipe, which I appreciated at five am this morning.

This is an absolute delicious recipe. Very, very easy to make. I put a few nuts on top before baking for added presentation. I baked mines in a regular muffin pan (not the nonstick) and it only took 20 minutes. I will make this many more times! Thanks for such a great recipe!--sk

These muffins were pretty good.  Instead of adding 1 cup of sugar, I used 1/2 a cup and it was still good

Amazingly delicious!  I've made these muffins many times since discovering this recipe and I like to make a few adjustments.  To make these a little more healthy, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup all purpose and substitute half of the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce.  Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I use 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/3 cup splenda granulated (or white sugar).

For an extra kick of flavor, try adding 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I dice or mash lightly at least one of the bananas so that there are yummy chunks of banana in some bites and sometimes throw in 2 tbsp of chocolate chips or oatmeal to vary the texture and reduce sugar or flour accordingly.  I add additional chopped walnuts or sliced almonds to the top for decoration.  I tend to fill the muffin cups to the top for puffy muffins and this recipe yields exactly 12 regular (~20 min) or 24 mini (~14 min).

This recipe is very good and very easy to make. Instead of walnuts, I used mini chocolate chips and it turned out great. I used about 1 cup of chocolate chips. Thanks Sarah!

These muffins are awesome!! SO easy and so tasty!  All mixed in one bowl, now what could be better?  I made these for my husband to bring to work, they vanished!  Thanks for the recipe, it's the only way I use my ripened bananas now.

These are EASY and wonderful!  I love that the batter is done in one bowl!  After a little reading reveiws, I changed it up a little.  I used only 1/2 c. sugar, 1/4 c. veg. oil with 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. nuts (pecans or walnuts).    I added 1/2 c. mixed dried fruit (raisins, crasins, cherries, blueberries), 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cloves, and orange zest from 1/2 small orange.  YUMMY!

Wow Sarah, these are some really awesome "Banana Bread Muffins"! These were perfect for Sunday morning breakfast with a cup of tea. I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I also subbed coconut for the walnuts. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin and got 6 huge muffins. I topped them with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven for a little added crunch. I baked them at 400 for 30 minutes. They smelled wonderful and tasted even better - thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect.  Made one batch as written, and a sugar free version for my kids.  Sugar Free:  sub half flour with whole wheat, sub 1 c sugar for 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce, add dash cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, add 1/2 cup raisins or blueberry.  NOTE:  to make this sugar free, the overripe bananas are CRUCIAL.  also, i want to add that this recipe is great as written AND with mods for sugar-free/whole wheat, etc.

I tried several Banana bread/muffin recipes from this site and this was by far the best!  I made slight substitutions - 1/2 whole wheat flour; 1/2 brown sugar; used 4 bananas, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg.

I thought these muffins were fanastic and very easy to make.  After reading the reviews, I made a few minor adjustments.  I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar; added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon; added 1 tsp. vanilla.  For a topping, I mixed additional chopped walnuts, a dash of cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar and mini chocolate chips.  My muffins baked for about 18 minutes.  They came out looking like gourmet muffins and tasted like it also!

These were wonderfully light and moist. I use 2 eggs instead. I got 12 regular sized muffins and a whole pan of mini muffins from this. My husband liked these and took a bag full to work to share. Thanks this is the first time I ever had banana bread turn out right for me!

This recipe is really great! I love how easy and customizable it is. I tried the recipe as written, but for a second batch, I added more chopped pecans. I topped a few with old-fashioned oats. I also used canola oil and some brown sugar, and per some reviewers, added a tsp of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon. Mine were nice and golden in 26 minutes.

My primary goal was to find a recipe that would give me muffins that were very moist, & a little dense like banana bread...This is it!!! I admit that my 5 stars includes the flavor I got from adding a dash or two of nutmeg,cinnamon, & a tsp vanilla....But either way, my goal of finding a muffin recipe w/the texture of banana bread was accomplished...Thank u!

Outstanding. This should be a breakfast staple. Like others, I reduced the sugar to about 2/3 cup. I had an extra banana so I threw that in. I only keep whole wheat pastry flour on hand, but it works just like all-purpose, in my experience. The funky part is that I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup kefir (kind of like yogurt) and they were still moist and dense just like a "cake bread" should be. Seems like a pretty fool proof recipe!

I just made these with 1/4 cup coconut instead of the walnuts and they are AWESOME!  tastes just like banana bread, but with a twist, and the tops got this wonderful crispiness from the sugar.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Although I would prefer a muffin with less sugar and a healthier choice of flours, I wanted to make the recipe pretty much as printed so I could give it an accurate review.  I used a scant cup of sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown), and I topped each muffin with old fashioned oatmeal before baking.  Also, since my bananas were small, I used 4 bananas.  This was a fantastic muffin.....full of flavor and wonderful texture.  Next time I will try spelt flour and use even less sugar or even Sucanat or turbinado to make it a little healthier.  I suppose someone could also use an egg substitute, but I don't usually keep them in stock.  I imagine this recipe could be altered quite a bit without affecting the end result.  Thanks for the recipe!  I love that it doesn't require buttermilk or sour cream or anything I may not have on hand.

I have been making these muffins every day for the past 2 weeks since my kids are eating them up as fast as I can make them. I did sneak in about 1/8 cup of oat bran for more fiber and I added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder making them even fluffier. Recently  I have added 1/3-1/2 cup cooked quinoa to add protein too.

Thank you, Sarah!  My family is enjoying this almost weekly now.  I did make it a tad healthier by reducing sugar from 1 C to 2/3 C and changing 2 C all-purpose flour to 1 C all-purpose and 1 C white whole wheat flour.  Also baked for 25 mins instead of 30 - 40.

These are not bad but not great. My kids loved them. I still prefer to make a banana bread loaf and with the few more ingredients in it: it's worth the extra effort

Very good recipe and so easy to make.  I made some substitutions to make it not quite so calorie loaded.  I substituted the sugar with Splenda, the vegetable oil with applesauce, and the all-purpose flour with wheat flour.  Even with those substitutions it tastes very much like homemade banana bread only in muffin form.

Very delicious! But I adjusted the recipe a little bit. I used 3/4 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of oil, 2 eggs, and 1/2 tsp of baking powder (not soda).  ?

Fantastic muffins!  I did make some changes after reading the reviews first.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, a few dashes of nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I think without the spices and vanilla the muffins may have turned out a bit bland.  I skipped the walnuts and used a mixture of chocolate and butterscotch chips.  As far as the cooking time goes, they were perfect at 20 minutes in a 325 degre oven.  Everyone loved these and I will certainly bake them again.

Really easy! Kind of a Plain-Jane muffin though. I made some as is & some with vanilla, nutmeg, ginger, and topped with sugar. Those are much better. If you like a pure banana flavor you will love these. If you like a little sass I suggest adding additional flavoring. Also, in my oven I only needed to bake them 30 minutes @ 325.

I followed the recipe for the actual muffins except I used four bananas instead of three because I had four and didn't want to throw one away. This is by far the best Banana muffins I've ever tasted or made, just delicious. Very moist too. I made a topping of brown sugar, flour and butter and sprinkled it on the top of each muffin before baking. I also used the larger muffin tin and papers. Thank you Sarah, this is a keeper for sure!

This made 18 muffins for me, but it's certainly not a complaint! What an easy, delicious recipe! I used pecans instead of walnuts, as that's what I had on hand.

Turned out GREAT! I did add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and I think that brings out the taste of the banana bread! And you could probably add a hint of cinnamon if you wanted an extra kick to it. Thanks for the recipe! Love it and enjoying it.

I only put in 1/2 cup sugar, I increased the walnuts to 1/2 cup and I substituted half of the oil for apple sauce and they were delish!

These were very yummy. The only thing for me was the baking time was only 22-25 minutes and I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla. I will make again. Loved them.

Ok, so after reading other reviews, I also "tweaked" my recipe. I give it 5 stars though because it's a good base recipe to start from. Instead of 1C sugar, I used 1/2C agave nectar and 2T sugar. I also used two eggs instead of one. I did not have walnuts, so I added a teaspoon of walnut extract. I made jumbo muffins (filled 6 tins EXACTLY), so my baking time was 30 mins.
And since I'm lazy and didn't want extra dishes to wash, I mixed it all at once in one bowl. (I started with mashing the bananas first, then chucked the rest of the ingredients in the bowl.)I've just taken them out of the oven and they are nice and golden and smell wonderful! Next time I will use almond and flax flour to make them gluten free! Thanks for sharing, Sarah. :)

I needed a banana bread recipe that didn't use brown sugar as I had ran out and came across this muffin recipe.  OMG - these turned out amazing! I followed suggestions from other reviewers and only used 1/2 cup of sugar and subbed apple sauce for the oil.  I also subbed chocolate chips for the walnuts.  I forgot to add vanilla or cinnamon so I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of the muffins as they were going in to the oven.  Delish! Thanks, Sarah!!!

I've made this recipe probably over 2 dozen times and always get rave reviews from my family. I make it exactly as the recipe states but sometimes, for a change, I will add a little cinnamon (1/2 to 1 tsp) and it makes it even tastier!

These were so good! I used only 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 oil and 1/4 applesauce, and did half white flour and half whole wheat. They were done in 22 minutes so set your time for 20 minutes in order to check on them.

I've made this recipe many times since I first discovered it in allrecipes.com.  My family loves bananas AND coconut, so these muffins always go fast!  I also add a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Very yummy.

I had never made  banana bread or muffins before, so I was glad to find an easy, well-reviewed recipe. I only had 2 very ripe bananas, so I added in one of those individual cups of applesauce. I also cut the sugar in half, added some cinnamon, and used equal parts whole wheat and unbleached white flour. YUMMY!

Very good! I doubled the recipe and made a dozen with crushed pecans, and a dozen with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I read what some previous reviewers mentioned and halved the sugar to 1/2 cup per batch.  Also, the cooking time was only about 25 minutes.  Still, very moist and flavorful.

I haven't made this recipe as it is; I modified it a little to please the picky eaters at my house.  I used 4 ripe bananas, an extra heaping spoonful of flour to account for the extra banana, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Like some of the other reviews suggested, I used only 3/4 cup of sugar, since the bananas are so sweet.  My daughter and I loved them!  Because of the extra ingredients, the recipe made 18 good-sized muffins.  I'll definitely be making this recipe every time I have ripe bananas in the house!

Didn't have nuts but I've made this twice without them. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great...the second time I added a little nutmeg and cinnamon and it turned out even better YUM! The only "bad" thing about this recipe is the time is totally off.... check it after 20 like everyone else says...

Very good! I made mini muffins and they only needed to be baked for 15-20 minutes. I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 c. white flour.

This recipe made 12 perfect muffins. They rose just beautifully. The only difference was I added coconut instead of walnuts.This is a TERRIFIC muffin recipe and they are absolutely delicious!

I feel bad about rating these since I changed so much about the recipe, but as I used this as a base I figured I might as well. These turned out really well with a few changes: I followed a lot of advice I read in the reviews and cut the sugar down to half a cup. I used a cup of whole wheat flour and a cup of all-purpose, and then to continue on the health kick, I replaced the oil with an equal amount of vanilla non-fat yogurt. Then since I didn't have any walnuts, I decided to try almonds. I sprinkled some brown sugar on the top for a little sweet crunch. I baked for 20 minutes and they turned out perfectly - moist and not too sweet, just banana-y enough. yum!

This was my first actual bread attempt and it came out beautiful! I was very pleased with the bread overall although it was not as moist as I expected.... Next time maybe I'll cover it.

WOW!!!! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I also added 3/4 cup of white sugar instead of the 1 cup it called for, and found it was still a little to sweet for me. Next time I think I'm going to try adding brown sugar. I will be making this recipe again.

Muffins turned out awesome. I took everyones advice and I cut the sugar down to 2/3 Cup. I used Splenda instead of white sugar. I also added 1tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.   Great warm with a little butter. Yummy!

Made these last night and enjoyed one for breakfast this morning.  I used three bananas, since that was what I had available, so mine are pretty favorful.  I also added some raw suger to the tops before baking, because I like the way. :)  Very delicious and pretty little muffins that baked up tall and golden.  I also liked that the recipe fit 12 muffins, as that is plenty to had on hand at one time.

These muffins are delicious. I followed others suggestions and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and halved the sugar. The muffins are just all around delicious. Next time I will chop up additional walnuts for extra crunch on top. I baked them forr 35 minutes in total. I have a glasstop electric stove. They came out perfect. These would be yummy with coffee or a nice tall glass of milk. Who am I kidding these would be delicious with anything!!!

A nice muffin! Lowered the temp to 325 and still took them out a minute or two early...added cinnamon and probably could have used a little more.

Easy and delicious!  As per other reviews, I added 1 tsp vanilla and cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Instead of the nuts I threw in 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  Thanks for posting!

Perfect way to use up bananas and tasted delicious.  Used 1/2 cup sugar as suggested by others and omitted walnuts.  25 min. in mini muffin pan turned out great.

YUM!!! Perfect recipe (also a great base for some creativity) and so easy to make. I also lessened the sugar a bit and they were still really sweet and delicious. I added a touch of cinnamon, omitted the nuts and added peanut butter chips. I also subtracted a little more white sugar so I could add some brown sugar.

I followed the recipe almost to a T, but decided to add a little less oil and all came out great.   I would have added additional banana and substituted oil for apple sauce but didn't have additional bananas or apple sauce.  They were yum!    If your oven runs hot, I would only bake for 27-28 minutes.  I left them in for 30 and if they were eaten within about a half an hour they would have been hard after a few hours..

It was pretty sweet, but nice and dense, too. It's not as much a breakfast muffin as a healthy dessert muffin, which is exactly what I needed! To get a more dessert-y feel to it, I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also sprinkled sugar on the tops before I baked, which gave me a nice crunchy crust. Yum!

Good recipe.  I added cinnamon, vanilla extract, and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup.  I was out of walnuts, so no crunch, which they do need, so I will be sure to add them next time.  Cook time was only about 20-22 minutes.  Will add more cinnamon next time.

Really easy to make!  I used whole wheat flour and 3/4 c. sugar.  I also added 1 t. vanilla and a few hefty sprinkles of cinnamon.  Next time I may try to replace half the oil with applesauce.

Great recipe!  I subbed a stick of butter for the oil and a half cup of butterscotch morsels for the nuts, and they disappeared quick!

Great recipe! I reduced cooking time to 24 minutes. Kids aren't big on walnuts, so I substituted about 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 3 T. flax seed, then sprinkled some flax seed on top. Just the right amount of nuttiness and crunch.

I made 12 muffins instead of a loaf. Excellent texture. I just added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter.

Very, VERY good. Rose beautifully but still dense, moist, delicious. My daughter and I left out the nuts and put in some chocolate chips, instead. She's two and loves to help out in the kitchen, and this recipe was perfect for little hands to help mix. We made both regular-sized muffins and mini muffins. Might do well to add a bit of vanilla or a dash of cinnamon, but overall, a great base recipe. Thank you!

I think this recipe is a great base for banana bread or muffins... However, I did modify.
My modifications: 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and I add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon almond extract when i don't have walnuts... Have made this as a banana bread loaf as well as muffins and EVERYONE loves them!

I made a double batch of these, using 4 VERY ripe bananas that I hd frozen.  Because I was short on bananas I threw in about 1 1/4c or so of chocolate chips along with the nuts.  No worries, they still had great banana flavour...but the chocolate chips were still a nice addition in my opinion...but I like everything better with chocolate in it!  Really great muffin recipe, I will definately make these again!

A great recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, which I think adds a little more flavor, and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup per others' recommendations. They came out perfect! Definitely a keeper.

Really good muffins... I did half white sugar/ half brown sugar to total a cup... Found the sweetness just right! I added in a splash of vanilla cause I always do when I bake:) and instead of walnuts I added in mini chocolate chips and coconut... Yum! Thanks for the recipe Sarah.

so moist! I took other reviews into mind and made a couple of changes. I used 4 bananas and 3/4c sugar. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I also sprinkled quick oats on top for added flavor and decoration. They are fabulous! I'm eating one right now!

Really delicious! Nutty and moist. I increased the walnuts, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white, added a tsp of vanilla and about 2 tsp cinnamon. I only had one banana so I also added a cup of applesauce. Otherwise made just as directed - very good! Will make them again!

This is a good banana muffin recipe, I found the banana flavor stood out. Based on reviews, decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 brown, 1/2 white) and used white whole wheat flour with good results.  Would make again.

These muffins were the bomb! I only made 6 but next time I'll make a lot more.  Nice rounded tops, moist, and delicious! I had to use pecans because I didn't have walnuts. Next time I might add a crumb topping.

Delicious. However... She mentions coconut twice in the descriptions and it's NO WHERE in the recipe or directions. I used 1/2 cup mini choc. chips instead of walnuts. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white. She mentions using "muffin cups in muffin tins". I believe she meant paper cupcake cups. I used them. I highly recommend them. No clean up! I had more than 12 cupcakes though. (20 mins at 350!) So I sprayed PAM in a ramekin and put the rest in it. (25 mins at 350 cuz it was bigger.) It was delicious with some ice cream warm out of the oven.

This recipe was wonderful!  Like other reviewers, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and they were great! I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, added 1 more banana (I love bananas!), and toasted the walnuts before I put them in the batter. I also sprinkled a few on the tops of each muffin before I baked them.  They turned out great! Thank you Sarah!

thanks for all the reviewers suggestions to bake at 325.  I don't understand why it is, because I bake muffins at 350 with no problems but I started out at 350 and then turned it down; glad I did.  Also added the 1/2c. oatmeal as suggested, and threw in some mini choc. chips, 1 tsp. vanilla.  Nice banana flavor, as my bananas were very ripe.  Made 8 Texas size muffins.  Maybe if making this as a loaf, 350 would be fine, but if muffins is what one is doing, definitely @325 degrees.  Quick and easy, very tasty.  *I did find them a bit dry but perhaps because I added the oatmeal for substance.  Not a problem though, I just put them in a covered plastic dish when still very warm, and they 'steam' bath and make them nice and moist after a while.

The original recipe makes good muffins, but some changes were needed to make this a "five star" recipe.  I agree with other reviewers about adding vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also agree about lowering the baking temperature to 325 degrees.  I do not agree about reducing the amount of sugar though.  I tried that the first time I made these muffins (reducing sugar to 1/2 cup) and there was a funny aftertaste that I didn't care for.  With the full cup of sugar added, these taste wonderful and they are not too sweet at all for my taste.  Another addition I really like is 1/2 cup rolled oats instead of nuts.  The oats add texture and make this muffin more fitting for breakfast, and a little heartier.  With the changes I've implemented, these muffins come out perfect, moist and golden every time I make them!  A new family favorite in my house!  My three year-old can't keep his hands off them!

YUMMY!!!  We are wheat-free in our house; so I made these with Spelt flour - just added an extra 1\2 tsp of baking soda.  I also brushed the tops of them with Maple Syrup after baking - simply scrummy.  I know this will be a future family favourite!!!  Thanks for sharing, Sarah.

I love this recipe, the only think I added was sour cream.  The muffins were moist and delicious.

Delicious!! I always have a hard time making banana bread (or pumpkin) because I either over cook it or undercook it. I hate dried out bread, but I hate the flop in the middle bread. This solved that problem nicely and they were just yummy!

I made these and modified the recipe.  I used apple sauce instead of oil.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead, added 1 tsp of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Turned out great!  My family really enjoyed it!  Will make these again.

Delicious!  Since I'm not a lover of bananas I did add the chocolate chips suggested by someone and they were perfect, also used self rising flour instead of the all-purpose.  Plan on taking some to the office in the morning.  Made 18 in all. Thanks!!

Loved this recipe.  I have a heart condition and unfortunately desserts are my weakness - so my changes were to use an artificial sweetner and reduced it to 3/4 cups, used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, used  1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose flour and I did sneak in a little coconut.  Loved it!!

Exactly what I was looking for! I used 1/4 cup of organic sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar I also used King Arthur 100% Whole Wheat flour. Makes for a little denser muffin, but that's the way I like it. Also, tooth pick was coming out clean in 25 mins at 350.

I liked the taste very well but I did make a few changes.  I did not use walnut, I used Oats.  Then i added 2 tablespoons peanut butter and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Then I justed 1 cut all-purpose flour and 1 cup wheat flour. and also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cut brown sugar.  I LOVED THEM!!!!

The best banana bread recipe ever! We don't like walnuts so I didn't add them. We baked in muffin tins with the foil muffin wrappers. They were so moist and delicious. Everyone loved them! For something a little extra we added mini chocolate chips to a batch and they were very good too.

Previous banana muffins recipes have always went wrong for me! This recipe is brilliant! Lovely moist banana muffins.  
I only added half a cup of sugar and a tbs of honey instead. Lovely!
Thanks for this recipe.

I've made this recipe several times because it's so good.  Until now I have followed the recipe.  This time I cut back the sugar back to 3/4 cup, used organic unrefined sugar, used apple sauce instead of oil and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour.  I also leave out the walnuts.  They were fantastic with my substitutions.  I love that this is a one bowl recipe.

These muffins were delicious.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and instead of the 1/2 cup of oil, I used about 2 tablespoons of oil and the rest unsweetened applesauce.

Thank you Sarah for the great recipe!  I was sitting here on a rainy Saturday afternoon with 3 ripe bananas and voila!  Some lovely muffins were made.  I am trying to follow the "clean eating" lifestyle so I made the following changes to fit into our diet.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and decreased my "sugar" to 3/4c. and I also used Sucanat (non-refined cane sugar) as a replacement for white sugar.  I used unbleached whole wheat pastry flour in place of white flour (it is a 1 to 1 substitution), and safflower oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also sprayed my muffin pan with olive oil spray from a "Misto" which leaves no weird olive oil taste, just a healthier alternative.  I figure if I made all those changes and they still turned out good they have to be good the original way.  I'm still trying to convince myself that this healthy stuff is good, and this was definitely a good "cleaned up" recipe.

Kind of bland, needs something I just can't put my finger on it. I think next time I make these I'll follow another users idea and add vanilla and cinnamon. I'll update my review after I make the changes.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. My boyfriend said it's yummy but a little too sweet. My mom, brother and aunt told me they were so yummy. So I'm torn between the comments but I think I'll cut back on the sugar next time :) I bet it tastes great with tea!

I made these muffins this morning because I had some bananas I needed to use. I thought they turned out great! I didn't have any walnuts on hand, but they would be even better with the nuts. The only change I made was using canola oil instead of vegetable oil because thats what I had. I was a little weary about how these would turn out based on everyones reviews, but I thought they were very easy to make, and taste pretty good. Oh, and I too only baked them 20 minutes, glad I checked them, 30 minutes and they would have been burnt!

These muffins turned out great... I did make the following adjustments after reading many of the reviews... I used 4 large, ripe bananas instead of 3, used almost a cup and a half of wholemeal flour and the rest white flour, used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and it was still quite sweet because of all the bananas.. next time I may use even less sugar. Added 1/2 tspn vanilla extract and 1/2 tspn cinnamon. I used only 1/4 cup canola oil instead of 1/2 cup and added approx 1/4 cup crushed pineapple as I happened to have that left over in the fridge.  Baked for around 25 minutes and they came out very moist and surprisingly light, given that I'd used so much wholemeal flour.  My 3 year old gobbled these up and kept asking for more!  I will definitely make these again and may try adding some oats next time.

These muffins were fantastic.  I followed the suggestions and used slightly less sugar (a mix of brown and white) and cooked the muffins at 325 degrees.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla per recipe.  I doubled the recipe for 12 muffins thinking I would end up with about 48 mini muffins; however, I had 84 mini-muffins!!!  My guess would be the original recipe for 12 muffins actually makes a few more.  For the mini muffins, I recommend cooking at 325 degrees for no more than 15 minutes.  Yummy!

These muffins were excellent and very easy to make; I will definitely make them again.  As another rater suggested, I added 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon.  I had to omit the nuts because I was making them for a playgroup with kids, but next time I'll add them.  They had a great flavor and IMO, they weren't too sweet.  I knocked off a star only because they were quick to dry out.  Even 36 hrs later they were kind of dry.  Maybe it was my fault for how I stored them though (in a big ziploc bag).

I made these subbing it with a 1/2 Cup Splenda instead of sugar and they came out very well.  The mix was a little thicker but after they baked they turned out fine.  Just a little dry.  Nice and easy!

I love this recipe, and made some healthy revisions.

2/3 cup sugar, 1 cup AP flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 4 bananas, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce.  Bake for 30 minutes.

Comes out yummy and guilt-free for the kids.

Perfect! I made 6 muffins in the jumbo muffin tin.  Watch the baking time carefully.  I baked for 28 minutes but 25 minutes would have been perfect.

Makes a very tasty muffin!  The only changes I made were to use 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp + a dash of vanilla. This will definitely be my standard banana muffin recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING!  It's so easy -- I actually didn't expect much from it because it was so effortless -- and most importantly, all three sons will eat it, even Picky Toddler :)  I used toasted pecans and about 1/8 c. sweetened coconut.  Next time I'll throw in raisins, too.  Baking time was 15 minutes for mini-muffins, and about 25 for regular size muffins. These muffins are so good you'll be amazed that YOU made them!  Their taste and texture is like a bakery item.  Thank you, Sarah!

I followed others' recommendations and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of orange extract.  I used oversized muffin tins so had 6 large instead of 12 small.  Baked at 325 for 30 minutes and they were perfectly done.

I wasn't brave enough to try the coconut - I made it as written!  I added a bit more bananas though - I used three really large ones.  I like a really fruity bread. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Turned out great!

Unlike other reviewers, I did NOT think these had too much white sugar--actually the opposite, I doubled check to make sure I didn't forget sugar because I thought they could've used a tad more.

I accidentally added 1 cup instead of 1/4 cup of walnuts and I'm glad I made this accident, 1/4 cup wouldn't have been enough for my liking.  I also added a couple dashes of cinnamon and vanilla extract per another persons suggestion and I'm glad I did, they would've been bland.

These came out moist and delicious. My kids loved them. I omitted the walnuts and added some semi sweet chocolate chips. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Yum!

Super easy and yummy. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the nuts b/c I didn't have any), however since I only had two bananas, I did reduce the serving size to 8 (rather than 12). It made 10 regular size muffins and they came out perfect & moist. I only had to bake them 20 min.

Awesome and super easy - this is my new favorite muffin recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. This is how a banana nut muffin should taste.

DON'T OVERBAKE! Or at least definitely use 3 bananas (I used 2, since that was all I had, and it was rather dry). So maybe it was my fault! But other than that I really liked it. I think the 1 cup of sugar works well. I also substituted coconut for all the walnuts, and it was pretty good. Nice recipe!

Very good muffins! I used milled oats instead of flour. I used 2/3 cup sugar and substituted the walnuts for coconut. Also, I added about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp-1 tbsp vanilla extract. They were finished in 25 minutes. I would use walnuts next time.

Maybe I needed to use three larger ripe bananas...not a really strong banana flavor, but good muffins all the same!  They were done in 25 minutes, so keep an eye on them while they're baking.

I like the idea of these, but took the suggestions of some of the reviewers to make them more to my taste: cut the sugar in half and used light brown instead of white, did half wheat and half white flour, added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla, used pecans because that's what I had on hand and added about a 1/2 cup chocolate chips (because they make everything awesome!).

These were fantastic!!! I just made these this morning and everyone in my house is devouring them! I followed the recipe exactly (only adding a little cinnamon bc I love the smell when baking) and we did not find these too sweet. But I can see how reducing the sugar a little would not hurt the taste, especially if you wanted a heartier, healthy breakfast muffin. Next time I am going to add more nuts and not chop them so fine, as its nice to get that crunch inside.

Great and super easy!! I also made some modifications, ie: using half the sugar as indicated by the recipe, and I used course brown sugar instead. I always bake with Borges light olive oil instead of vegetable oil for a healthier alternative. I used 100grams polenta and 150grams flour. It gives an amazing texture, taste and colour. I had no nuts so I substituted them with oatmeal and sesame seed. Also adding some vanilla and cinamon as suggested by other users. Sprinkeling them with sesame seeds and brown sugar prior to baking. Yum!

I liked these. Thanks Sarah they were easy to make and really do resemble a bread like texture.... prolly due to the lack of baking powder so there not puffy like muffins. I never use walnuts due to peanut allergies but i never heard of using cocoanut. Maybe next time i'll try shredded cocoanut as it doesn't  affect the peanut allergy.  I hate changing original recipes but i did to the flour portion. Only cause i need fiber i used 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour ... my family is none the wiser of this change. I made these befor reading reviews about people cutting the sugar..... and yeah you could probly cut the sugar a bit but all my sweet tooth kids and hubby will have them gone in no time. I will make these again ... the title easy to make always catches my eye as time is of the essence for me. Thanks again Sarah.

Modifications: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, dash nutmeg.  Used pecans not walnuts. They were great! Wish I had added another banana for more flavor and didn't chop the nuts too finely.  I like bigger nut pieces.

excellent basic recipe.  used 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1/4 brown as suggested by another user.  also added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  i made 3 muffins using this plain mix for my 4 y/o (he doesn't like alot of extra stuff in his food).  i then added some chocolate chips to the remaining batter and made 3 banana chocolate chip muffins.  i then added pecans to the remaining batter and made 3 banana chocolate pecan muffins.  i then added some shredded coconut to the last of the batter and made 3 banana chocolate pecan coconut muffins. everything came out excellent!, including cooking time and oven temperature.  thanks for a great recipe!

I have horrible luck when baking and even I made great muffins with this recipe. I did use a little less sugar and sub'd 1/2 applesauce with the oil to make them a little healthier. Turned out perfect!

Delicious!  I substituted the vegetable oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce, cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, added a tsp of vanilla extract, and baked at 350 for only 20 minutes.  I like it a little nuttier though, so next time I'll up the walnuts to 1/2 cup.

I had 3 very ripe bananas I had to use, so I thought I'd try this recipe. I did cut down on sugar a bit (3/4 cup) and used whole wheat flour instead of white, but otherwise followed the recipe. The muffins were somewhat bland, and I thought they were a tiny bit dry. I baked them for 30 minutes and that was too much, I think. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't make these again. I had to throw most of them away because no one would eat more after they tried one.

Just made these & they are delicious! I took advice of others and cut back on the sugar...using 1/4 c white sugar & 1/4 c brown sugar. I added 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Only took 25 mins to bake. After they cooled a bit, I glazed them with a mixture of powdered sugar & milk. The true test is if hubby likes them :)

Family thought these were very tasty.  I added peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Cook time is long for my preferences.  I baked the first part of the batch for 30 minutes and, though they came out okay, I thought they were a little too done--tops were quite brown and kind of hard.  Baked second part of batch for only 25 minutes and they came out just slightly browned and soft.  Much better.  Would make again.

this is an amazing recipe! followed some other's suggestions to use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. also added some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. before baking, i sprinkled a little homemade streusel mix on top (brown sugar, quick oats, flour, butter). they turned out delicious, and they look great, too!

Made a few changes.... Like others, I halved the sugar. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and used one cup all purpose flour and one cup whole wheat flour. But they are TASTY! Next time I would probably add about 1/2-1 teaspoon of cinnamon. But I'm a sucker for cinnamon.

Great, easy recipe. As others wrote, it is a bit sweet, so the sugar can be reduced if desired. I also added an extra banana as the ones I had were kind of med/small size. I upgraded the recipe a bit as pecans were on sale, so I was able to use chopped pecans in place of the walnuts. I then added a streusel topping before baking. What a difference! This turned the muffins into something you might find at a bakery or coffee shop. To make the streusel, mix 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped nuts (pecans here too), 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 Tbsp. softened butter. Combine with fork until crumbly. Cover filled muffin cups before baking. ENJOY!!

These muffins are great!  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and cut the sugar down to a half cup and I also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts because thats what i had on hand.  They were more bread-like, not so sugary sweet like the banana bread I've had in the past but i still think it had just the right amount of sweetness without over doing it.  Very versatile recipe with delicious results!

This is the third banana muffin recipe I've made from this site and this one is by far the best! So easy, too. I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts. Yum, they turned out delicious!

They were yummy and easy and I didn't think they were too sweet at all.. They got a little dark at 350 for 30mins, so maybe next time I'll bake them for 25mins at 350 or do as previous suggested and only do 325 for only 30mins. Otherwise, they are awesome.. and this was my 1st time making banana nut muffins from scratch!

I made this recipe healthier--Sub 1/2c unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil, 1/2c sugar instead of a full cup, and subbed in 1 cup whole wheat flour and only 1 cup all purpose flour.  The result was a super moist, super yummy muffin that is PLENTY sweet!

Very very good!  I added 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. 

Instead of walnuts I added some coconut and chopped almonds.

Will definitely make these again!

These are very moist, tastey muffins!  Usually I make muffin-shaped banana bread using a bread recipe from Fanny, but this had a better consistency.  For the record, about 19 minutes is all I needed for mini-muffins, in case anyone's interested.  The folks at work will be pleased, and I'm glad to have not wasted very ripe bananas!

Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  The coconut was a nice touch, it gave just a little bit more texture and I really liked it.  Hot from the oven and with a little butter... mmmmmmm.  My family loved them.  I might try them with some mini chocolate chips to make them special for my kids.

I thought it was pretty good, my husband
thought it was dry. I read all the reviews, the only changes I made was instead of 1 cup sugar, I used 1/4 cup
of white sugar and 1/4 of light brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I definitely will make it again and add
alittle applesauce to the batter. I didn't want muffins so I made it in a
9x5 loaf pan, cooked it for 1 hour on
350 and it came out perfect!

Quick and easy to make.  Son (11) said they were awesome (I don't eat bananas myself).  We used 1 cup regular flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  We also added a few extra walnuts to the top of each muffin before putting in the oven.  Recipe made 12 very generous muffins.

These muffins were so good.  I had lots of rotting bananas and I needed something to do with them.  I figured banana nut muffins would be good for breakfast.  In classic All Recipes style, here are my changes.  I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour.  They tasted perfect that way.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. good cinnamon, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, and 1/2 cup walnuts.  I will definitely make these again.  I was very impressed that even when the muffins were hot they came out of the muffin papers perfectly.  The muffins were moist and tasted good hot or cold.  I did not use any coconut.  I also baked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes.  I can't wait to make them again!

This was a great recipe!  I made this into a loaf instead of muffins.  I also used chocolate chips, walnuts and raisins as an addition.  The results were amazing!  Not only was the cake tasty but the added ingredients was a great touch.

These muffins are fantastic.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings as it's only my husband and I, but I should have kept it for 12 and froze the rest!   I added 1/4 tsps of cinn & nutmeg, 3/4 tsp vanilla, added 1/2 cup coconut and used Diamond's glazed walnuts.  Since the coconut and walnuts were sweet, I cut the sugar down by half and substituted applesauce for the oil.  The subtle coconut taste really adds a nice flavor and texture.  I will definitely make these again...Thanks Sarah!

These are yummy! I used Splenda instead of sugar. Also added 1 tsp baking powder to help them rise. I took someone else's advice and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Banana bread perfection! I'm going to try making actual loaves with this recipe - should be just as good!

Yummy!  I did half the batch according to the recipe and half the batch with added coconut and chocolate chips.  They were both wonderful.  My 3yo son helped me make them and he ate 2 all by himself. Great recipe!

Looking for a nice banana muffin recipe and this one sounded good. After reading reviews tried it with half the sugar, half oil/half applesauce. Used a regular 12 muffin tin and filled them almost full. Turned out beautifully! Nicely rounded peaks, moist, not too sweet. I used chopped pecans and put one on top. Only baked just under 30 min. Next time I will add cinnamon and maybe a little riper banana. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

I just made "this" recipe with a few modifications due to what I had on hand and to make it healthier. I followed other reviewers and cut down on the sugar. I used 1/3 Cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup stevia. I substituted coconut oil for the veg oil (because i didnt have any veg oil). And I used self-rising flour instead of all purpose and therefore omitted the baking soda. My kids loved it! I didnt use nuts because my daughter has an allergy- though I think craisins would have been delicious too.

I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and they were delicious! I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder and tripled the amount called for to make the appropriate adjustment. Lastly, I substituted applesauce for the oil. So light and fluffy.

I thought this recipe was really good and simple. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and reduced the sugar to 3\4 cup as some people suggested. Baking them for 30 minutes was too long though. I should have checked them at 20 minutes! Thanks for the recipe. I will make again.

I made it today but saw the sugar comments later; however, I always use half the sugar in all recipes (this time I used 3/4 of a cup; I also add pecans to everything so it managing any sugar spikes). I believe that a whole cup of sugar is too much.

I wish I'd read previous reviews. This recipe was too sweet. I added a bit of cinnamon and cloves, and it was still a bit bland. I'd maybe do 3/4 tsp. salt, and add vanilla and more spices next time, and cut down on the sugar. Nice and moist, though.

I like sweet and moist banana bread, but was baking for someone who does not like sweets, so I tried this recipe. It was ok, I would put in more bananas and cinnamon if I made it again.

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to this recipe (both of which go beautifully with banana). I also subbed in half a cup of agave syrup and some raisins instead of refined sugar and used a high fiber gluten free flour. Thanks for providing a simple base that I could experiment from.

Thanks for sharing this! I decided to make some modifications of my own based on others' feedback. I did 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also omitted the nuts since my nephew has a nut allergy. The muffins still turned out to be amazing. :)

These muffins were just o.k. for me.  I used 3 very ripe bananas but the flavour was overpowered by the sweetness.  I don't think I would make them again.

I LOVE Banana Nut bread and muffins so gave this recipe a shot. It was extremely bland, no banana-y flavor or real taste. I tried it with the customization of vanilla and cinnamon and it still didn't flavor the muffins enough.

These are awsome! I did make a few changes. I added a tsp of vanilla, used pecans instead of walnuts (that's all i had) added an extra banana and baked for only 25 minutes. They came out moist, flavorful and just plain delicious. Also, unless you make big honkin' muffins, you're going to get more then 12 out of one batch. I doubled the recipe and ended up with 40!

I loved this recipe and despite a few blunders it came out great.  I got distracted and accidentally added 1 cup of oil (however it was olive oil so no real harm done) but they still came out moist--not greasy--and delicious.  In lieu of walnuts, which I did not have I used 1/2 cup of semi crushed honey bunches of oats cereal and it was a delicious breakfast treat for the whole family!

Not sure how to rate this - came out great but I made a lot of substitutions!  Used only 1/3 c sugar because my coconut was sweetened (no walnuts).  Also, substituted slightly more than 1/2 c of pumpkin for the vege oil (ran out of applesauce and didn't want pure oil) and only had 2 ripe bananas.  Whole wheat flour instead of white.  Finally added both a dash of vanilla and cinnamon. Baked for about 20 minutes - made 24 mini muffins.  Loved this healthy version!

Mmmm!  I added a tsp of vanilla, a little extra oil, and a fourth banana.  I think next time I will add some cinnamon.  I made 12 mini muffins which only cooked for 16 min. and 12 regular muffins which cooked 22 min.  They were all very moist and yummy!

I followed the recipe almost exactly to a tee-- except I added some chocolate chips at the end (what can I say, Momma needs her chocolate). The muffins were good.. but not GREAT. They weren't the moistest or most flavorful muffins ever. I don't know if it was due to the white sugar (instead of brown) or lack of vanilla/cinnamon.. but they came out being pretty.. well, average. With that said- I think they'd be a great recipe if making with children. The limited ingredients and straight forward directions make it perfect for beginner bakers!

Great recipe to make substitutions - I've used apple sauce instead of oil, splenda instead of sugar and half whole wheat flour, they turn out good each time.

Wasn't as cakey as I was expecting it to be... Good just not what I was going for. This is just like banana bread in muffin cups.

This was a great starter recipe. I followed it...sort of. I read some other reviews that said it was too sweet so I did 1/4 cup white sure and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Then to make it low fat I did 1/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. I also added a couple dashes of cinnamon for some added spice :)  These were dense but I think banana muffins or bread will always be this way. Great recipe and will make it again.

These muffings are fantastic. I use splenda sweetner in place of sugar and you can't tell at all. They are soft but not super crumbly so easy to take on the go!

I only baked them for 25 min., based on other reviews, and they turned out perfect.  Would be good with chocolate chips, too.  Kids loved them!

These were very easy and so good! I used 3/4 cup of sugar, substituted softened butter for the oil and salt, and doubled the walnuts. They were done baking in about 24 minutes. Wonderful!

Very good, inexpensive to make and produces a lot of cute little cup cakes.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and half butter/half evoo, because these were the things that I have in my house at all times.  Added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract for fuller flavor.  I loved that I didn't have to add heavy cream or anything like that, as other recipes I've seen in the past have asked.  Great!

wow, these by far are the best banana muffins I have ever made. So simple yet so good. I used coconut instead of nuts because of school issues and the coconut is a very nice addition.

I enjoyed these muffins as well.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Added an overflowing teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/2 c. of coconut along with the walnuts.  They baked in about 20 minutes in muffin cups.  I'll definitely make these again!

For my first batch,the only thing I changed was to use 3/4 C sugar instead of the full 1 C, since so many people suggested that. My muffins came out way too dark (350 for 30 min)and a little dry. Tried a second batch right away, since it's easy and I still had more over-ripe bananas. This one was much better: 325 for 25 minutes, and I added 1 more banana, since mine were small, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Yum!!! Simple, quick, lovely gift to bring to my husband at work and have around the house for my toddler and I to snack on all day. :o)

Had a 9x13 pan already prepared so used that.  Tasty with nuts and coconut, but uneven and lopsided.  I would have used a mixer if that was suggested.  I also subbed about 1/2 C white whole wheat and with 3 large bananas it was quite moist!   Second time I added coconut and I hated the texture!  Won't do that again.

I added coconut and vanilla. NOTE: If you have a fan forced oven like I do, the muffins only take about 20 min (I'd check after 16-18 min) instead of 30-40. They'd be burnt to a crisp left in that long.

I actually followed a few of the other reviews from the get go and cut the sugar amount in half. They were delicious! A family member is allergic to milk and butter so this recipe was okay to share with them as well. They tasted fine without nuts too so if you opt out the nuts it's okay for people with allergies to nuts too (don't forget to check packaging though since some products are packaged on the same line as nuts and dairy).

Fantastic recipe! I did add 1 healthy teaspoon of vanilla as it helps to cut down that sometimes bitter after taste that ripe bananas can give off. These are moist and so flavorful. Thanks for sharing a terrific recipe.

I love this recipe. I was looking for banana muffins/loaf that didn't use dairy or margarine, found it and love it. I use 3/4 the amount of oil and sugar suggested and it still tastes amazing. Dounle it and it freezes wonderfully. Thanks for a great recipe.

I gave these 5 stars because they couldn't be any easier to make and are moist and delicious.  I love that I did not have to use my mixer.  You only need a bowl and a wooden spoon.  Great way to save garbage-bound bananas!

These were quite good. Modified the recipe a bit as suggested by other commenters. Used 3/4 c sugar, added vanilla and cinnamon and used same amount of wholemeal flour. Didn't notice the tagline before and I agree the recipe could be improved by some shredded coconut. Would try that next time!

I took some suggestions and used 3/4 C sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and these only took my oven 20 minutes when they were perfectly done.  Moist and delicious with a tiny crunch on top.  Yum.

I changed it a bit to make it low-fat and less sugar.  Instead of oil I used 1/2 c. cinnamon apple sauce.  Instead of 1 c. sugar, I used 1/3 c. brown sugar.  I also left out the nuts so my 1 year old could eat it.  It was nice and moist and not too sweet.  I'd definitely make it again.

This were excellent with a few changes- Use 1/2 cup sugar.  Use 1/2 whole wheat flour to make a bit healthier.  I reserved some walnuts for the top and sprinkled a bit of sugar in the raw on top for a little extra crunch.  Delicious!

I thought these were very good!  I also used only 3/4 c. of sugar, substituted 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil, added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon, then topped them with a mixture of 1/4 c. chopped walnuts, 1 Tbsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

I just made these & of course ate one, they are excellent. I had 4 bananas to use up so added all of them, did not add the nuts as I did not have any. They came out good, fluffy & good consistency. I cooked them on 325 for 35 min. Perfect.

These muffins were absolutely delicious. However, I did modify these to make them lower in calories and fat. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and substituted splenda in (you can't even taste the difference!) I also cut out the eggs and veg oil and replaced them with about 2/3 cup of canned pumpkin. Not only did this cut calories and fat but it added amazing texture to the mix. Lastly, just to add a bit more spice I put in a teaspoon of cinnamon. I think next time I may try adding a tsp of vanilla and possibly some nutmeg.

I made these muffins today and I was out of oil, so I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead they are so moist and they taste great not to mention lower in fat.

Great recipe! I baked my muffins at 350 for 25 minutes. I put my bananas in a food processer so they would be smooth in the recipe. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix. Also, I added 2 teaspoons of flaxseed to the mix.

near-perfect recipe! I cut the sugar in half, as suggested by other reviewers. Glad I did, too, because any more and they would have been too sweet. I used 1/4 c olive oil and 2 tbsp lighter bake instead of the full amount of oil that the recipe called for. I baked at slightly lower temp, 330F, and they were done in about 25 mins (probably b/c I have a fan oven). All in all a great recipe and I'll definitely make again!!!!

Recommended. THESE SMELL AMAZING WHEN YOU BAKE THEM. My boyfriend really liked these because they weren't "as banana-y" as my usual recipe. Based on users' suggestions and my own tastes, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used 1 and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white. I didn't use coconut and threw in more walnuts. The tops came out crunchy and the insides were moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this again!

portion size was really good!, made 10 good sized muffins and 2 smaller, diddly ones. Used only 25g of white sugar and 75g of brown sugar, and added 1 tsp of vanilla essence and some cinnamon as per other reviews.  Added abit more baking soda to make the muffins more puffy and big!, worked a treat, and baked them for just over 25 mins at 165, but this was still too hot, next time ill change the temp to 160 and check the muffins before 25 mins.  They browned too much.  I thought the muffins were abit too dry and texture abit too dense for my liking, kept them over nght and they turned abit gooey and sticky on the outside.  But my friends seemed to like them loads.  Also added in some chocolate pieces, made loads of difference, cos the muffins werent bananary enough, next time ill wait till my bananas are really ripe before use.

This recipe was so easy! Only thing I didn't have on hand were walnuts, so I used raisins. Soak them for 10 minutes in hot water before putting them in the batter. And, I used 1/4 c brown sugar, 3/4 c white sugar. They're perfect!

I think these are the best banana nut muffins I have ever had.  Very moist and flavorful.  I made a few adjustments due to personal preference: used half Splenda and half brown sugar, half white four and half whole wheat flour, added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon, used melted butter instead of oil, and added about 3/4 cup of coarsely chopped pecans.  I will definitely be making these muffins frequently. For variety I'll try adding some peanut butter or add some blueberries.  This is a great recipe!!

Very good basic recipe that I will keep using!  Like others, I changed it a bit.  Used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil.  Used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.  Added 1 tsp vanilla to wet ingredients and 1 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients.  Added both chopped pecans and coconut.  Baked at 325 for 20-25 minutes.  The part that tied it all together for the WOW factor was frosting these babies with homemade coconut cream cheese frosting:  creamed 6 oz lower fat cream cheese softened to room temp with 1 tsp vanilla.  Beat in 2 cups confectioners sugar.  Stirred in 1 cup coconut.  Topped the warm muffins with this stuff and it was delicious!

Very Banana tasting, added the coconut instead of the nuts. Good texture. Next time will add a pinch of baking powder, and a little less sugar.

This recipe is AWESOME! I had two variations...

1)I used 4 bananas...I needed to use them!
2) I added vanilla! I went to the store to pick up more when I ran out and then realized that I didn't need them. So I used it anyway!

I plan to use this version, the regular version and some of the other versions too! It was great!

These were yummy.  I didn't have nuts but I did add a half a granny smith apple and a scoop of protein powder.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  I served them with butter, strawberry jam and peanut butter.  My son liked them with peanut butter best.     Watch the time...my muffins were done right around the twenty minute mark.  This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious recipe.  Very versatile....you can add almost anything and it will turn out great.  I added 1/3 unsweetened coconut and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I also added one extra banana to make them moist.  Will definately use this recipe again and again!  I followed the advice of others and baked at 325 for 25 min.  Perfect.

I love these muffins and I am really picky about banana bread.  So easy and good!  I forgot to add the vanilla extract, which would have added a nice flavor, however, it still turned out well.  I used brown sugar instead and also baked at 325 degrees for about 22 minutes.  Fabulous!!!!

Turned out excellent. I had 3 black over ripe bananas and I was looking for something easy to do with them. I made a couple of changes- I used the same amount of brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also I added more walnuts because I love the crunch. I used the other reviwers suggestion of baking them at 325 for 25 minutes. They smelt great when baking and tasted wonderful when done. Thank you Sarah for the recipe.

I love this recipe!  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly(minus the coconut) and they were delicious.  This time, I used spelt flour and only 1c of dark brown sugar.  I also added fresh strawberries and the turned out amazing!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I LOVE THESE MUFFINS!!!  I have made them multiple times in the last five months, and everytime they are fantastic!  Notable: they are good with every possible additon--I add a cup of chocolate chips (or half, if that's all I have), 1 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, sub 1/3 c brown and 2/3 c white sugar for the 1c white sugar, and include 1 tsp vanilla.  I also like to sprinkle the muffin tin with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before filling.  I've taken these to meetings, sent them to work with my husband and taken them as a snack on a week-long road trip--good all-around!  Tasty, tasty, tasty; you can't go wrong.  (Bake at 325 for 20-25 min and watch closely toward the end.)

These are so DELICIOUS!!  I did substitute half the oil with some applesauce, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. (Like another lady had done)  They were so yummy!!  My husband loves them.  I made six muffins in a texas sized muffin tin.  baked 28 minutes.  These were really good...I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Thanks SARAH!!

This was my first time using mashed bananas in anything and it worked out great! I combined many of the recommendations that other people made - substituting 1/2 C honey for the sugar, 1/4 C oil instead, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg, 1 C coconut, 1/2 t baking powder for rising, and walnuts for decoration. I also sprinkled coconut on top - makes for a great presentation! Next time I'll make sure the mashed bananas are more lumpy. Otherwise, people loved them and they were a breeze to make! Thank you everyone!

I love this recipe. It was moist and good. I did take another persons advice and use 1 teasoon of vanila and 1/2 cup sugar. I will always cook this recipe in the future. The reson i looked and tried this recipe was because it was one of the only ones i found that had used only baking soda. I did not have to use baking powder since i did not have it on hand. Thank you Sara!

Amazing! Took some advice from other reviewers and added a personal touch as well: Sub 1/2 C Honey for the Sugar (Note* b/c of substitution have to cut the oil to 1/4 C). Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Add choc chips - sooo good. And the final touch...topped each muffin with a few slices of fresh organic farmer's market Strawberries.  Delightful!

This recipe is awesome.  I don't like nuts and didn't have any coconut, so I added raisins instead, which turned out great.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  Definitely a keeper!!

Not too shabby for a quick muffin fix this morning, the recipe definitely needs more 'banana's' also maybe another liquid too, fairly dense!

I've made these twice and both times they were a hit. My husband asked me to make them for the security guard force and since I only have a 6 muffin pan, I will spend Saturday making enough for the whole crew.  They are wonderful with coffee or tea!  I will make them again often. I've always added at least twice the number of bananas and it makes them moist and flavorful.  Also, I've been adding a few chocolate chips and those are also yummy!

Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and oil to 1/4 cup. Mixed one cup all purpose and one cup whole wheat flour. Used 8 ripe bananas. Added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Baked 30 minutes. Turned out awesome. Kids loved it. A bit sweet for me.

Really good recipe.  I think they were a little sweet too, but I added frozen berries to some of the muffins and those were so delicious!  This is an easy recipe, and I think the muffins have great banana flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

I had some over-ripe bananas I needed to use and found this recipe.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 teas. Cinnamon.  The muffins were excellent!  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe has become my signature Grandma recipe for my 5 year old grandson.  He asks for these every time he comes to my house.  I omit the walnuts and substitute about 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Also, when I have brown sugar I use 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar.  The whole family loves them and they're so easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe !

We are peanut butter and banana fans so i chopped up a few peanut butter cups and stirred them in rather that the nuts and they were a big hit.

The only changes I made were for high altitude: Extra 1/4 cup flour and decreased sugar to 3/4 cup and added 2 teaspoons water with the flour.  Baked in Large muffin pan (6 muffins) until tops sprung back when touched.   Everyone loves them.

This a quick and easy recipe to make.  The muffins tasted great, and my kids loved them, even the picky ones.  I did make one substitution.  My kids are not fans of nuts, so I used 1/2 C of old fashioned rolled oats instead.

With some modifications these turned out Great!! So nice and moist. I used 1/2 cup unrefined sugar and 1/2 cup muscovado sugar (which is a more natural kind of sugar, even less refined). I used half the oil and added 1/2 cup apple sauce. Added 1 tsp natural vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Only 20 min in the oven. DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for the recipe (and the reviews) I will be baking them again for sure!

Great muffin recipe!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup as recommended by other reviewers.  I also cut the oil to about 3 TBSP and used 1/3 cup of vanilla greek yogurt.  Made these in a mini muffin tin and baked at 350 for approx. 18-20 minutes.  Will make again!

These were great- based on reviews I used half the sugar and added chocolate chips.  Mashed 4 bananas since i had them.  Also added 1 tsp vanilla.  And we added a few tbsp flax oil along with the veg oil.  Very moist and delicious!!!

Definitely put in both the nuts AND the coconut! Use a bit less sugar... and serve with local honey!

Good, but did cut the sugar to 3/4 c and added about 1/2 tsp vanilla and cinnamon and 1/4 c flaxseed.  Could use a little more sugar, however, as they weren't very sweet.  I used my convection oven at 325 and the baking time was reduced to only 15 minutes!

I love this recipe.  Because of health conditions, I omit the nuts.  However, I've found that using a cup of choc. chips or banana chips is wonderful!  I make these quite a lot when I have bananas that need to used soon.

I changed this recipe a lot.  Firstly, I took the ideas of 3/4 cup sugar.  I also only used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 milk to substitute for the other half.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and sprinkled sugar on top to make a crust.  My dad also doesn't like walnuts so I used pecans(I have no idea how that will turn out)  The bananas I used has previously been frozen and then thawed. the time to bake was really weird, some took awhile, others not so much. they are really good, but not super bananay.  that might be because I used frozen bananas.  They were good though!

This recipe couldn't be easier- great basic to tweak based on what you have on hand. My changes:   I used 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C agave syrup.  I used 1/3 C unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 C canola oil.  I used three bananas, and used walnuts and coconut and added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  Baked for about 20 minutes.  They came out great!

This is a great go-to recipe.  I did add 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon both times I made it just for a little extra something.  This is not a light muffin...tastes like a small loaf of banana bread.  No complaints in my house!  Plus it was a great "first" recipe for my second son...easy instructions and mixing.

The consistency is perfect!  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, too, and the flavor is wonderful.  I did not add the walnuts since my daughters do not like them, but I am sure these muffins would be even more amazing with them.  Delicious recipe, Sarah!!!

FANTASTIC!! Used 1/4 chopped walnuts in batter and another 1/4 cup walnuts on top of muffins before baking for presentation.  Cooked in about 30 mins. Loved the more bread consistency rather than muffin consistency.  Just took to the gym and they've already asked me to bring again.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

The muffins were perfect! Followed the recipe except used 3/4 cups sugar and the sweetness was just right. Shortened baking time to 25 minutes. It literally takes 10 minutes to prepare.

These are very good! I cut the sugar in half and added some cinnamon like others had suggested, and used 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 oil in place of the oil.  I omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any.  I mixed some brown sugar and margarine and sprinkled it on the top before baking for a crumb topping.  I baked these for 27 minutes at 350 and this was a little too long.  Try baking for 22-23.

I'm really not a great baker, but these worked well. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers: - 1/2 cup sugar (1/4 brown, 1/4 white) - 1 tsp. vanilla - pinch of cinnamon - choc.chips cook for 25 min.  Will do these again (next time I'll peel the banana's before I freeze them though!!!)

these were pretty good but not very flavorful. i used just 1/2 a cup of sugar and added 5 small bananas, 1 tsp. vanilla and some cinnamon...still now enough flavor. these muffins get 4 stars because they're not dense. i have a favorite butter-filled banana bread recipe but sometimes it's just too heavy. i think by adding a bit more sugar than the 1/2 (maybe brown sugar) and some more spices these will be a 5 star

These seemedjust a little dry.  I only put in 1/2 c brown sugar instead of the 1 c. white sugar.  Came out really great!  Everybody loved them.  Also to make them a little bit healthier try using a different oil.  I made these with grapeseed oil but next time I may try coconut oil.  YUM!

Simple and easy recipe.  Nothing new or unique but delicious and a good snack for the kiddos when they come home from school.  Cook time is FAR too long, but if you are using the method of pulling out a clean tooth pick, then you'll know just when they're done.  Maybe 25-30 min in a standard oven.  In my convection oven, I baked 22 minutes.

I made this recipe the other night while dinner was in the oven. It was so quick to put together. I was looking for a dairy free banana muffin recipe. So glad I found this one! My daughter said the muffins were better than my usual ones. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Thanks, Sarah, for a great recipe!

These were absolutely wonderful!  I took FLEUR-DE-LYS's advice and changed the sugar to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and a little more than a pinch of cinnamon and they turned out wonderfully!  They were subtly sweet, but not overly so.  Also I kicked the temperature down to 325 as ORF2B and baked for 30 mins even and they were ready on the dot.  I also added a few chopped walnuts to the top of the muffins before baking for texture and looks.  Thank you to Sarah, as well as the reviewers.  Perfection!

I didn't add any coconut and these muffins were fantastic.  They looked good and tasted good!  On top of that they were really easy to make.  I might try to add some cinnamon next time because I think that might be yummy too.

Very good texture, my kids love them. My eggs are small so I added two eggs instead of one, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, no nuts because my kids don't like them and reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup, the muffins were done within 35 min. I like that the muffins are not greasy and heavy like some others recipes I found online. Will do this one again next time I have leftover bananas.

These muffins are now my absolute favorite.  I also followed the suggestions and used only 3/4 cup sugar (1/2 white & 1/4 light brown) and used pecans instead o walnuts simply because I don't like walnuts.  The recipe made exactly 12 regular sized muffins which I baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  I think the next time I make them I'm going to try adding a couple of tablespoons of molasses to the batter as well as a tiny bit more flour to compensate for the thinner batter.

Delicious! I made 3 muffins, and put the rest of the batter in a loaf pan. Both came out very good, though for the loaf I think I'll take it out a couple minutes sooner.

Cut sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup granulated white sugar. Cut fat to 2T. and replace remainder with applesauce. A teaspoon of vanilla punches up the fruity flavors. I don't add coconut, just a personal thing.

These were very good.  I omitted the salt, added a handful of raisins and used slivered almonds for the nuts.  I also used 2 bananas since thats all I had.  My husband was going to have one with a cup of coffee.  He ate four and was eyeing a fifth one.  All in all, very good and will be making these again.

These needed a little spice.  SO I added 1 teaspoon of cinnammon.  I agree they're a little sweet next time I'll use 3/4 of a cup instead of 1 cup. I liked them. I'll make them again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, agreed with other's reviews regarding cooking time, at 25 minutes in my non-stick cuisinart muffin tins, they were almost overdone. And I substituted half white whole wheat flour and they weren't very moist at all, I will make again with all white for that moist banana  bread goodness.

Really tasty muffins - they didn't even last the whole morning.  The coconut was a huge hit.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and put in less sugar, and they turned out great.

This was pretty good. I tried to cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup like many reviewers suggested, but my husband asked me if I had forgotten to put some in. I think that the next time, I will try the full cup to see if it tastes better. I did lower the cooking time to 25 minutes and it was just perfect.

I thought this was very good! I did take the advise from others and cut the sugar in half and added some cinnamon. I also thought that 2 cups of flour was too much, I ended up adding in some milk! Very tasty!

I use all whole wheat flour and add a streusel topping to the top of these muffins, and they are always a big hit.  Even my picky two-year old loves them!

Love them!  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla just like other users did.  I also added cinnnamon (a little more than a pinch).  Muffins turned out amazing!

I just finished baking these muffins for my co-workers tomorrow and I had to eat one to test how it came out.  I gotta say they might may not make it to my job tomorrow.  These muffins are awesome!  Not hard to make at all.  I will definitely be making these again!!!!

This recipe is not only easy but fool-proof and just delicious! I did it for the first time last night just as directed, with a few minor adjustments: I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, I didn't have walnuts so I used cashews that were salted, so instead of using 1/2 tbsp of salt I used 1/4 and 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup since most reviewers seemed to agree that a full cup wasn't necessary (next time I'll use brown sugar to see how that turns out). I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2 tbsp of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon . They were perfect! And also, mine only needed 30 minutes, no more, no less. We loooooooved them. Thanks for this recipe!

I followed the recipe as is, but cut the sugar by 1/2 like many people said, but I wish I didn't.  Even with the lack of sugar, I wish that it had more flavor. I added cranberries which fit pretty well. Next time I'm going to try chocolate chips.

The title of this recipe says it all. These muffins are like miniature loaves of banana bread. I was short on banana so I added a second egg. These are crunchy on the outside and densely yummy on the inside. They would be lovely to serve with a cup of coffee or tea.

These muffins are so good.  My daughters are 3 and 15 months and they loved them!  I baked them at 325 for 20 - 25 minutes and they were perfect.  I also used slivered almonds rather than walnuts.  I will be making these for my family often!!!

I usually make muffins using the standard muffin mix available in the store but when i came across such an easy recipe for Banana Muffins to be made from scratch, i couldn't resist and tried it out...I added a little bit of Nutmeg and Cinnamon for the extra aroma and the results were amazing..Thanks Sarah for such a easy recipe. This recipe will stay with me forever

This is a great basic banana nut muffin recipe.  I modified it by increasing the bananas to four, reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup, adding vanilla extract and my secret to moist baking, one package of vanilla pudding mix.  The turned out fantastic.

I made this recipe just as the instructions said.  I added a bit of coconut and a 1/4 tsp of rum extract (figured if I'm going to add the coconut it needed the rum extract! lol) They were not too sweet at all as previous reviewers said but I guess it all depends on personal taste.  I brought them to work and the girls loved them.

I had the chance to make these muffins this morning,and can not say enough about them!
They have the texture of banana bread but in portable form!
I used wheat germ instead of chopped walnuts(i use wheat germ in all my recipes that call for nuts).
I began to question the results though, in the beginning, because the batter was so stiff...but all ended well:)
 Thanks for another great recipe!!!

This recipe turned out very well! I made some of the changes recommended by other reviewers: I decreased the sugar to about 3/4 cup and added some cinnamon & vanilla. However, I didn't think it was quite sweet enough this way, so next time I will probably use the amount of sugar as written. Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter (14) made this recipe and it was very easy and quite tasty!  She had enough for 12 muffins and a small loaf of bread using the 12 serving suggestion.

This is a very simple, very good recipe. I used two cups of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, added one teaspoon of vanilla extract, omitted the nuts and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup (the sweetness for me was perfect, a full cup would have been too much). Also, 350 degrees as recommended, at about 23 minutes, turned out just perfect.

It rose very well and was light and delicious. Thank you!

These are sweet- I cut the sugar to 3/4 cups and decreased baking temp. (as others have suggested) to 335.  Perfect.

I was looking for a simple recipe to use up some bananas.  This was great!  Such simple, basic ingredients that you will have around the house.  I was able to make 12 muffins and a mini loaf with this recipe.  The muffins were so good right out of the oven and the bread just as good the next day.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar like some suggested and also added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I set my oven temp to 325 and baked for 33 min- they turned out great.  This is a keeper!

This is the best banana muffin recipe I ever tried.  It's very moist, delicious.  It doesn't need anything else.  Intead of walnuts, I put one peanut butter hershey kiss(point down) in each muffin. It tastes so good and gives beautiful presentation.  This is a keeper for sure.

Very good recipe. I lowered the sugar to 2/3C and added both walnuts and coconut--which I had never thought to add to banana muffins before. Very good and very easy. Thanks for another great recipe!

This recipe is great! I made some changes to make it lower in fat. Substituted the 1/2 cup butter for 1/4 cup applesauce + enough bananas to make 1/2 cup. Added 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon and this really brings out the banana flavor. Reduced the sugar only by about 3 teaspoonfuls and everything tasted just nice! Muffins were ready in 25 mins! Yum!

This recipe was a snap from start to finish.  These looked good at every stage of the process.  I omitted the nuts and added in just over a half cup of butterscotch chips folded in at the end.  As previous reviewers mentioned, they were quite sweet, and although the flavor went fantastically well with the banana, the butterscotch chips only added to the sweetness.  Still, these were fantastic, so easy, and a delight to make.

After reading some of the reviews, I added an extra banana to the recipe for moister muffins, and 1 Tsp of pure vanilla extract.  I baked them at 325 deg for 35 min., and they came out beautifully golden brown and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making this again soon!

These muffins were perfect!  I even used half splenda/half sugar and they still rose enough to look like muffins.  No bitter aftertaste that I sometimes notice with banana nut concoctions.  They also froze and reheated really well as someone else had suggested.

Soooooo yummy! These were great! I haven't made very many muffins before, but this was so easy! I substituted the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour, the walnuts for pecans, and the twelve cup muffin tin for a six cup one. This recipe was extremely delicious and easy to make. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make a quick and awesome batch of muffins.

These muffins were easy and they were great tasting too. My boyfriend and I loved them. I did make a few modifications as per other reviewers. I used 1/2 cup of honey, and applesauce instead of oil. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla as well as coconut and walnuts. I am making them again and this time I am adding nutmeg, I love nutmeg. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose and also added some quick oats. I like having a hearty muffin in the morning for breakfast.

Wonderful muffins! My modifications: added 1/2 cup light sour crm, added 1/4 c raisins, 1 tsp vanilla, and instead of all white flour, I did 1 cup white, 1/2 cup ground flaxseeds, 1/2 cup bran flakes to increase fiber.  Important to use very ripe bananas for maximum flavor & sweetness, & the sour crm kept the muffins moist despite the flour substitutions.  Filled regular muffins right to the top & baked 28 minutes in my oven in dark muffin pan (made 12 muffins).  I like to toast my muffin the next day to get that crisp top. My friends rave about these each time I make them.

This was one of the easiest banana muffin recipes I've ever made.  The muffins rose wonderfully, and had a great texture.  My sons loved them, and we'll be making them again soon!

This was so easy.  I substituted whole wheat flour, applesauce for the oil and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup regular sugar.  I didn't have walnuts or coconut, so I used pecans instead.  I only needed to cook them 20 minutes.  Yummy!!!

Delish - I went with the coconut instead of walnuts and my girlfriend Sarah absolutely loves them. I may try some rum extract next time.

These were great. However, I had to add 1/3 cup soy milk to achieve the proper batter consistency, while cutting back on the amount of oil a little bit. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup frozen blueberries. Also, I substituted 1/3 cup of the flour with oat bran. And of course, I used sucanat (evaporated cane juice) instead of white sugar. Baked for 40 minutes. Very moist and delicious!

My family LOVED them! I had one request to add chocolate chips next time. I will make 6 with chocolate chips and 6 without. We omitted the walnuts as we're not a family that enjoys any form of nuts in our baked goods! We may substitute coconut sugar next time we make as founf them quite sweet or will adjust the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and 1 tsp of vanilla.

I made the recipe exactly as listed (youโve got to have a baseline!) and it was super tasty. I have a sweet tooth and even so I found it a little sweet - I think I would use half the sugar next time. The crunch of the walnuts is a nice touch. Would make it again with half the sugar!

These were very dry.  Did not even bake them the entire 30 minutes.  Used a dark non-stick pan so dropped temperature to 325.  Will not make again.

Iโve made these about 20 times so far. I first made these muffins using mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts and adding cinnamon sugar to the tops before baking. They were fantastic!Hereโs where the happy accident happened.Typically, some of the cinnamon sugar spills off when handling. One day, I prepared a batch early and left the unbaked muffins on the counter for several hours. After baking, the cinnamon became a crunchy topping. The guests raved about them (at three different brunches!) and thought, because of the fancy topping, that they were from a bakery.Apparently the cinnamon sugar had soaked up liquid from the batter while sitting out and this formed the crunchy topping. So now, rather than leave them out for several hours, I spritz the cinnamon sugar a few times with water before baking.

Making it for a second time. They were awesome, going to add Apple pieces into it also this time, for added flavour. I also added 2 tbsp margarine, 1 tbsp of oil extra & 2 whole diced & skinned apples with the banana's. I got more volume this time by doing that & makes them even more soft, so I'll have at least 18 muffins this time around. Hoping! It was awesome the first time I made them. The reason the margarine ended up in mine the first time is I had just made banana bread & had that brain fart when making the muffins. It was an oops but I am so thankful for the oops lol, cause they turned out fabulous. This time around I have apples going bad so am using them up. Can't wait to try them. I yielded 12 Banana Apple & 10 Banana Apple Choc Chip.

Very moist and great flavor because of the butter instead of oil.  If you put streusel on top, bake and eat them the same day, I baked mine the night before and the abundance of moisture from the bananas caused them to become very soggy.

I also add coconut and golden raisins with the crushed walnuts. Adds to the texture and flavor Great in the muffins and the Banan bread. Coconut, nuts, and golden raisins are also yummy in zucchini bread Both breads freeze great to have in the winter for when zucchini is not in season. I do however freeze shredded zucchini and mashed bananas, in 3 cup measurements, for when I need to quickly bake a loaf or two but donโt have the main ingredients on hand. Just take them out of the freezer. They thaw quickly

I only had 2 bananas so I added some blueberry yogurt. I only had self rising flour so I used that. They still came out good but I missed the third banana that would have given more flavor. I also used 2 eggs.

This recipe turned out really well. I didn't have walnuts even without, it came out amazing. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. The muffins baked in 30minutes, the loaf took 40minutes in an electric oven.

I made this recipe with a few small alterations: I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of almond flour.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and I added about 1 cup of chocolate chips .   They came out amazing crispy on top and gooey in the middle!

I have tried different recipes but this one delivers. The result was a moist, no overly sweet, delicious banana muffin, that even the appearance was truly appealing. For my own personal taste I substituted the nuts for blueberries and the variation was better than expected. Totally recommended :-D

I thought that this was a super basic, easy, but delicious recipe.  I took someone's suggestion & added about a teaspoon of vanilla & about a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I also added chocolate chips into the mixture.  I did not put walnuts into the muffins.  After I put the batter into the muffin cups I then sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar, then put chocolate chips & walnuts on top.  Mine cooked perfectly in 30 minutes!
I just devoured one... SUPER DELICIOUS!

Best banana muffins I've made yet! My adjustments are follows: I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and used four small bananas instead of three large. I barely mixed the dry to wet- just until it was combined. I fill mine right underneath the top of the tin so they bake to a good size. I also added candied pecans to the top before they went in the oven. I cooked these for 30-35 mins then drizzled the top with melted butter when they came out of the oven. Will definitely make again! Next time I will try cutting the sugar in half because they aren't the healthiest  ยฏ\_(?)_/ยฏ

The fact that this recipe is easy, is very nice. I modified it to be a touch more flavorful and less sweet. Here are the ingredients i used: 
2 cups flour, 1 egg, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce, 3 bananas, 1 tsp vanilla,  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 2/3 cups sugar. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes and they were perfect.

I don't know about you other ladies but I used the full cup of sugar and all I can say is....it was the perfect amount.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was instead of nuts,  I used chocolate chips  (bout a cup).  They were done way faster than 45 min. although!!  Glad I took them out at 25!!  Will be making these again...got a blueberry craving for tomorrow!!

The cooking time is too long.  I did there muffins for 30 min and they are overdone a bit and  dry. 

Also a bit too sweet.  Less sugar would have been better. 

 Also I suggest adding vanilla extract as well

It was gross, the flavor and texture was off. It was too crumbly to eat. And I ask for nobody to use this recipe. There is no chance that I will ever use this recipe again.

These turned our great! iโd been wanting something for breakfast and i absolutely love banana bread, mine werenโt the prettiest things in the world but they taste amazing. The only things i changed is i didnโt use walnuts because i donโt like them and i used thawed over-ripened bananas.

My Family loved it! I just followed the recipe except omitted nuts , added an extra banana, 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla and a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  It made 13 muffins.  I added the walnuts on top of 8 (picky child who hates nuts) baked for 30 minutes and they came out perfect!

My husband likes this recipe better than the more difficult banana bread I make, so does my son. I do only use half a cup of sugar, add vanilla extract and cinnamon, but also use really ripe bananas. We usually have extra bananas at the end of the week and it's easy enough to have my 3 year old help me.

My family really enjoyed these muffins. I made them with whole wheat flour instead and without nuts. They were tasty and just the riight amount of sweetness for us. We love them best cut in half, warmed in the toaster and topped with butter !

I cut back the sugar to less than 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  These are my grandsons favorite.  Make them in small muffin cups for a lunchbox treat.

Not much of a guy for following a recipe but thought I'd try.  Only had 2 bananas so I added a Fuji apple. I used 3/4 of a cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown.  Added a teaspoon (ish) of cinnamon and a dash of lemon juice. Turned out great. Thanks to OP for this one.

I loved these muffins! My brother and mom are gluten free so I made it with gluten free flour. I read reviews and they said to use 1/2 cup of sugar and I did. Also I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts! It tastes so delicious!!! I will definitely make them again.

Because I didn't have the right muffin tin I needed to shorten the bake time.  They came out nice and moist. :)

Good recipe.  I used dark brown sugar instead of white as I like a darker looking brown sugar.  I had no walnuts so used semi sweet chocolate chips.  I agree it did not end the full 30 minutes. I will use this recipe again but will shorten the cooking time to 25 minutes as other users suggested.

I made these with a few changes--I halved the sugar, subbed 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour, and added blueberries. They came out awesome, still cakey despite the whole wheat flour, and just sweet enough.

Made these when I was in a hurry and needed a muffin recipe quickly.  They were great and enjoyed by all.  Only change I made was to use pecans because this is what I had on hand.

These muffins were soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
AMAZING!  the only thing is  it only made 9 muffins not 12. that might Just be because we used mega muffin tins, but still, make more batter to get the actual amount of muffins. what makes these AMAZING muffins EVEN BETTER is sticking a walnut in the top before cooking. we will DEFINATELY make theses again, and I COMPLETELY reccomend it.

I love banana bread, but with a handful of small children in my house, the hour in the oven plus cooling time is too much sometimes. I made these muffins as a compromise, but they will now be my go-to for over ripe bananas! My 4-year-old said, "Mommy, you've outdone yourself with these muffins!" and my 2-year-old who is crazy picky ate two! I omitted the walnuts due to allergies and, even at high altitude, they came out beautifully!

I did it and I took the recs of other users who did 1/2 cup of sugar but I did add some chocolate chips and I didn't have chopped walnuts since I don't like nuts. But, I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter with everything after I mashed up the bananas. I'm going to try them soon and I hope they come out awesome!

These were tasty!  I used 2/3 cups of sugar, after reading other reviews regarding muffins turning out too sweet.  I think 1 cup would be fine, but my wife and I enjoyed the flavor with the reduced sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, because we like "cakey" cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing!

i love banana bread. in my house i am known as the banana bread queen, but this recipe was terrible, my muffins turned out  way too dry and while the out side was burning up the inside was just plain batter plus they did not rise at all. i have cooked with over 20 different recipes and here is the one i recommend (it is an allrecipes recipe): http://allrecipes.com/recipe/42719/banana-muffins-ii/
( was generous with even 2 stars)

The recipe was bland and super sweet. So, I added 1 more banana, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cups, added a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of Moringa powder and a teaspoon of vanilla. My son and I also ate them with cream cheese and jam; the reason why I only used half a cup of sugar. My son liked it.

I really like this as a foundational recipe. I wanted to add more flavor & texture to my version.
I used only 1 1/2 c. Flour w/ 1/2 cup rolled oats. Then added dark chocolate chips & seed blend from Trader Joe's (found in cereal aisle) when mixing in walnuts. 

Poured mix into muffin tins & sprinkled each with more seed blend. 

Turned out tasty! Next time I may try to add a little apple sauce to moisten even more.

Pretty tasty! At the hint of another review, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I think I must prefer sweeter and I will use 1 cup sugar next time. I also cut the cook time down to 25 minutes.

I just started baking a few months ago and started with something easy (banana bread).  I have become rather famous in my neighborhood for my banana bread, but I had never tried muffins.  These seemed easy and when I read the other reviews I cut back on the sugar (to 1/2 cup), added about a tsp. of vanilla and as well as walnuts, threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I baked them for 25 minutes.  The hardest part for me was getting the batter into those little cups.  Everyone raved about them, especially the 2.5 year old neighbor.  I think he wants me to adopt him.  LOL  Anyway, thanks for this recipe.

These muffins were very tasty, probably some of the best banana muffins I've made, and I have baked a lot of muffins. I knocked off a star because I did make some changes in light of some of the reviews. Here's what I did: kept the one cup of sugar but used half brown sugar, added a fourth banana and two heaping tbsp of flour (to balance out the sugar since I already had added it when I saw the reviews about their being too sweet), and added one tsp vanilla and a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon for flavor. I also mixed the dry ingredients separately and baked them for about 23 mins.

I love starting with a good recipe and making it my own.  I used half the sugar, substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, left out the walnuts, and added mini dark chocolate chips.  Excellent!

Very good! I added 1 t of vanilla and my oven only needed 23 minutes to bake muffins. But other than that, the recipe is good as stands. I might try reducing the oil next time just to see if they are as moist. After making them several times now, I've reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and use 4 small bananas instead of 3 regular and they come out moist and tasty!

Great! I altered the recipe a little... added a pinch of baking power to make it puffier. Also traded the walnuts for almonds and chocolate chips... great flavor!! It never hurts to add a little vanilla and cinnamon... Mmmhmm hmm... They will be damp and soft but that is just because they are banana... they hold moister. If you live in the tropica like me, keep in ziplock in cool area so they don't sweat.

Delish!! I took some of the other reviewers advice and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. Also added 1/4 c. raisins. Cook time was only 18 min. in convection oven. I will make these again.

I used 2/3 white sugar and 1/3 dark brown sugar, used pecans instead of walnuts, and added a little nutmeg. The crisp sugary glaze on the outside was yummy with the moist and nutty inside. I made this recipe because it was dairy free, but it might be better than any other banana bread I've had!

Made these last night. I love to bake. They made the house smell amazing while they were cooking. I'm sorry to say. I'm very disappointed. I cooked them at 325 for 20 minutes. They were sooooo dry. And no taste. Not a recipe I would even try to tweak. ??

I tasted the dough as I was mixing it and found it indeed, a little bit bland. As Fleur-de-Lys has commented, I also added some allspice and vanilla. The end result... delicious!!!

Tried to lessen the sugar because I have read from reviews that it's too sweet. Mine just turned out not well and no one bothered to eat (unfortunately). But I will give this a try again.

I substituted unsalted butter for the vegetable oil and used both white and brown sugar. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla and cut the baking time to 25 minutes. The muffins turned out very flavorful but a little dry.

I made these for my family this morning.  Big hit;  they absolutely loved them.  I left the walnuts out as I have a family member with a nut allergy but they didn't taste as though anything was lacking.  I'm sure I will be making these many more times to come.

Absolutely phenomenal.  I used melted butter instead of oil and omitted the nuts.

This is a great, simple recipe.  As per another review, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and reduced to 3/4 cup.  Very tasty, not too sweet.  Perfect for breakfast or a snack.  Kid and adult approved at my house!

I just took these out of the oven about a half hour ago and couldn't wait to try them.  These were a huge disappointment.  With 3 bananas, I figured they'd have a ton of flavor, but there was little to no flavor at all.  It was hard to understand why that would be, but they just have no flavor.  I'll continue my search for a good recipe.

I make these often because my kids love them. I've made them following the recipe and a slightly healthier version and they can't tell the difference. I generally use 1 c. whole wheat and 1 c. regular flour, add 1 T. flaxseed meal, use apple sauce to replace half of the oil. They freeze well and make a quick delicious breakfast!

My family loved it. Followed the suggested less sugar,1/2 cup, and teaspoon of vanilla. A lactose free recipee  for my husband that tastes great. Made the first 6 muffins without  chocolate chips for him and added 1/2 of chocolate chips for the remaining batter for the kids.

These muffins were delicious. I made them with 3/4 cup of sugar, half a teaspoon vanilla extract and some cinnamon, as suggested by another reviewer. The only change I made was I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts, due to food allergy. Overall great and simple recipe.

Added 3 tablespoons yogurt, no nuts, and 2 tablespoons more flour (to compensate for the yogurt). Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Baked for 20min is gas oven. Came out perfectly!

I've gotten rave reviews from everyone who's had one of these muffins.  A definite hit!  After reading some of the previous reviews I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar to cut down on some of the sweetness.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts (just like 'em better) and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Very moist, sweetness was just right.  I think the next batch might have a tablespoon of dark rum in them.

This is a great go to recipe for banana muffins! I got to use up 3 bananas in my freezer. I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup like others suggested. I added in some coconut flakes and about 1/4 cup of cranberries! This is a great base to add in things you like. Will make again

I rarely cook and was looking for something super easy. I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. I also substituted the walnuts for macadamias. The muffins came out perfect and it was so easy.

I make this recipe often. I have altered it slightly to make a healthier version with a  lower glycemic index. I use 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup and 1/2 cup of coconut sugar in place of one cup of white sugar. I also use 100% white whole wheat flour. I also add pure chocolate chips (low sugar and darker chocolate.) And it makes a great weekly healthy muffin for my kiddos!

The recipe was great. To make it a bit healthier I used whole wheat flour and about a half a cup of finely chopped prunes. It tasted amazing with a glass of milk for breakfast.

Wonderful recipe!  I took others' suggestions and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (personal preference), and swapped coconut for walnuts (I'm allergic).  They were moist and the texture was perfect.  I've tried a number of other banana muffin recipes but will be searching no longer for the perfect one.

I tried it and it tasted great!  However, I didn't follow exactly everything. I added lemon juice, to make the muffins puff up more. Unfortunately, I mixed too much (this is my first batch) and ran a bit out of milk, and the muffin tasted too dry and dense. That's my fault, not Sarah's!  I will fix it next time.

I agree that I should have used more bananas and sugar. My muffins taste like dry bread, with only a hint of bananas and rather bland and barely sweet. I didn't add nuts because I didn't have them, but I'll definitely try that next time!  Now I feel thickheaded for not following your professional recipe!  I should have known better!

Thanks so much for your recipe!  I will continue improving my muffins without question!  They still smell like heaven though - wish they tasted like what they smelled like!

Only change I made was 3/4 sugar instead of a cup, and using an electric mixer I whipped the ingredients instead of making them creamy, and did the banana at the same time. But they were super moist, light and fluffy. I'd make again!

I hate walnuts so I used 1/2 a block of Cadbury cooking chocolate cut up and then used the rear of the block as a chocolate drizzle on top, super yummy. 

Come out fluffy and moist

I have been trying to get my grandma to eat healthier lately. I love baking, so this can be a problematic task!  I replaced the vegetable oil with applesauce, baked for 30 minutes and poof! Perfection!  Next time I will try reducing the sugar amount like suggested (for grandma's servings). I loved the recipe. Easy peasy and a good base recipe to play with replacement ingredients!

A bit bland and not very sweet. I reduced the cook time to 25 minutes.

I like this recipe.  I did cut the sugar but I'm not sure I needed to.  They are not too sweet, for sure.  The only thing I might change is I might use butter instead of oil and beat till light and fluffy, or add some yogurt or sour cream for a bit more moisture.  I added a vanilla bean glaze in top just to make them look pretty (confectioners sugar, vanilla bean, milk or cream)

Wow these turned out great, following the slight modifications from FLEUR-DE-LYS.. i used brown sugar instead of white and only about half a cup. Two ripe bananas seemed to suffice for me, as well half a tsp of vanilla and sprinkle of cinnamon. I also added milk chocolate chips bc i didn't have pecans. The baking time kinda threw me off, i timed it for 30mins, but at about 25 they were PERFECT! YUM!

These were good as is but smelled too plain so I added cinnamon, ginger and cloves to give it more of a spiced flavor. I also put a dash of vanilla to balance everything out. Delicious! I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and still found them a little two sweet. Next time I'll try 1/2 cup.

I changed the recipe slightly...I did include coconut and walnuts but did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup regular sugar. I also included whole wheat flour vs all purpose. I didn't have baking soda so I did some baking powder but it turned out ok! Altogether a simple, yummy recipe that I will make again!

Super delicious recipe!
I replaced the oil with a stick of margarine because that's what I had on hand. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white. I also added 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and made them as mini muffins as an after school snack for my boys. They also freeze really well!

Love these! Except I use 1/2 - 3/4 cup sugar (depending on the ripeness of the bananas) and I also add tsp vanilla, dash cinnamon & fresh grated nutmeg! I like to substitute pecans (personal preference). So delicious! Will I make again? Yes! I've already made them 3 times :)

Great recipe. I added a small amount of brown sugar as I only had 3/4c of white sugar. Also added ~1t of vanilla, because I love it. Subbed pecans because that's what I had. I also added a handful of mini chocolate chips. These turned out great. I also cooked about 25 minutes. Turned out great. Nice and moist. Will be a nice breakfast for the next couple days.

Just whipped this together because I had some ripe bananas. These are great! Not too sweet at all. I just added a splash of vanilla and cinnamon  otherwise I followed the recipe to the T. I also made this in a mini muffin pan. Will make them again!

Ridiculously easy. I took some reviewers advice and used about 2-3 of the sugar recommended in the recipe. Came out perfectly for my taste, but for my sugar loving coworker who eats chocolate and ice cream on the daily it was not enough. Easy to make cute pictures!

This was easy and excellent tasting and required very few dishes!  I took the other reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half (although i did 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar) and added spices (pumpkin pie and nutmeg).  I used more nuts than called for because i like nuts.  Per my usual I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I also substituted apple sauce for most of the oil although i left about a tablespoon of oil.  It was done in 25 minutes.  I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't require all the edits (sugar and spices).

I followed the recipe but added 1t vanilla.  Baking for 25 min was too long.  The were overdone and dry.  Reducing sugar might make them less crusty and I should have followed the advice of reviewers to use half the sugar.  The flavor was OK but they need enough tweaking that I won

I love this recipe. My muffin pans are probably smaller, I get 16 muffins. Also at 375 degrees, I bake mine for 12-14 minutes. They are perfectly cooked. My oven is circa 1945, so may make a difference, however I would recommend checking at twelve minutes, just in case.

I made these muffins, but changed it up a bit. I added 5 bananas instead of 2, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. I filled the muffin tin to the top and placed into the oven for 40 mins. They came out great. The size, taste, and texture and my family loved them! I will definitely do again!

These were easy to make and tasty. I agree with other reviewers that the sugar could be cut by half, and I'll probably add some whole wheat flour from now on, but this is a very good recipe. Mine were done after 25 minutes so check them early.

Absolutely delicious!! My little boy and I make and eat a lot of different muffins, and this will now be our go-to banana nut muffin recipe! I did change a few ingredients based on what I had in my cabinets: I substituted the all-purpose flour with 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of oat flour, I substituted the vegetable oil with a 1/2 cup of coconut oil, added 1 tsp of baking powder, and added 1 1/2 tsps of cinnamon. They turned out perfect! (Also, I liked their sweet flavor, but if you don't like your muffin too much on the sweet side, you might try using 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup.)

I thought 1 cup of sugar might be too much so I made the batter and tasted it and it was definitely too sweet so I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla and it counteracted the sweetnees and tasted perfect!

I make this recipe at least once a month, as I always have over-ripe bananas sitting around. The muffins are wonderful and super easy to make, and all of my friends go crazy for them. I like to substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts :)

Made these for the first time this evening and they are great. The only thing I did differently was to add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. The sugar and banana have their own sort of caramelizing effect. Will definitely make these again!

I made these exactly as written and my whole family loved, loved, loved them. I thought 30 minutes might have been a little too long for cook time, they were a tad overdone around the outside edges (especially the ones in the nonstick tray versus the silicone tray). I got 14 good-sized muffins from this recipe. I can understand why others are cutting down on the sugar - especially once they're cooled you can taste the sweetness so next time I might cut back to 3/4 cup. I would also add a sprinkle of chopped nuts on top of the batter in addition the 1/4 cup mixed in. I thought a little bit more "crunch" would be nice. Really great addition to our morning muffin recipes!

I just made these today! They were awesome and so easy to make that of course I will be making these again. I put a cinnamon brown sugar crumble on top of the batch I made, and it really made them special! I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a tablespoon of smart balance butter to make the crumble. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe twice. First time followed exact recipe, it was very sweet but good! So second time I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 Brown sugar. Made a big difference and was delish! If you like it sweet then follow with the full cup but keep in mind it's very sweet. Also it does not need a full 35 mins. I only did 27 and they were already done! 35 May be a tad to long.

Super easy and much faster bake time than a big ole loaf. I made these for my dad, but kept one for myself. I only tried it the day after I made it, but found it very flavorful and moist and a LOT like banana bread :) I did leave out the nuts for Dad's sake. DS enjoyed two with his lunches, thanks for sharing the recipe!

My muffins look awesome and I had just enough to make 12 muffins. Th flavor is just blah, nothing special. Doesn't have the same rich flavor as my bread normally does. I was excited to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews but my muffins are lacking. Maybe it was a cook error.

I substituted this recipe with pecans, 1/4 cup of oil, 2 Tbps of butter, and put in 3 1/2 bananas. I added the egg to the mashed bananas in a separate bowl, mixed those together,then I mixed the sugar, butter and oil in a separate bowl. Then I mixed the sugar,butter, oil mixture in with the bananas and eggs. I then sifted the dry ingredients twice in a separate bowl before adding it to the wet ingredients I was tempted to put in cinnamon and vanilla extract as well, but I needed to make this to have a reference point to follow suit from. My next batch I'm going to try with  1/2 cup of pineapple in it too!

I just finished making these. I love the muffin concept. I used mostly the same recipe except added vanilla extract and mini chocolate chips. I omitted walnuts due to allergies. They're good, moist and very filling.

I'm giving this a five star because I altered it to perfection! I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup (and would probably go less next time) as obesity is an undesired outcome of baking. I substituted the vegetable oil for organic, cold-pressed coconut oil and used almonds instead of walnuts. I added an extra banana and used whole wheat flour instead of white. I topped the muffins with unsweetened coconut flakes and sliced almonds just prior to baking. This is a healthier alternative and they still taste like delicious banana bread.

I like it because it is quick and easy. Good flavor. I did cut down on the sugar, but I think I will have to cut down a little more. And I did add 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Very good recipe.

Very quick and easy. We did add a little bit of coconut, yum. We did not use paper cups but sprayed the pan with Pam. The muffins had a crunchy crust. Ready in 30 mins.

Really good. I doubled the recipe; used 6 mashed bananas + the juice of 1/2 lemon; used a generous 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt; 2 cups unbleached flour + 2 cups whole wheat flour. Everything else doubled.  They came out great and the lemon juice balanced the sweetness.

Your basic banana recipe that after altering a few things comes out really delicious! Like most reviewers here, I used half the sugar and added some vanilla and some cinnamon. When I make these I like to also add blueberries, strawberries and coconut. Awesome!

Delicious and very moist. Read the reviews and mixed wet ingredients first, melted butter, creamed in the sugar. Preheated to 375, reduced to 325 for 20min only. They were perfectly done.   I also modified using no sodium featherweight baking powder, and used Splenda/sugar 1/2 and 1/2.  Didn't want 24 muffins so only made half Recipie perfectly done.

Makes the kitchen smell beautiful! Left out the walnuts (nut-free zone here...), but added 1/4c applesauce, and a pinch each of nutmeg and cinnamon!
Moist and fluffy! This recipe is a keeper! ;-)

Yes. Too sweet. I used 3/4 cup but wished I used 1/2.  I added coconut flakes (unsweetened) along with the walnuts and I really liked the flavor!  I also added about a 1/4 cup of toasted oats for a tiny addition of a whole grain. The batter looked really dry when I went to put everything in the tin but it turned out great after just 20 min.  Next time I'll try with a little less sugar and add cinnamon and vanilla.

I thought it tasted good. I read the reviews before making it. I only put 2/3 sugar and I added vanilla and cinnamon. Instead of almonds I put pecans because that's what I had. It came out good. I would make again.

These are delicious! I have been trying so many banana muffin recipes and finally found this one. I followed the recipe, but left out the walnuts and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. Also, I baked them for about 25-30 min. Next time I will try substituting apple sauce for the oil to cut back on the fat. However, the taste was delicious, the muffins were moist, and the recipe was easy.

I couldn't decide whether to make banana bread or muffins so decided to give this recipe a try.  They muffins were great - just what I was looking for.  I wanted to try a couple of things to make them healthier and substituted coconut oil and coconut sugar.  It was my first time baking with these ingredients, but will definitely be using them again. I made a streusel topping with the coconut sugar, chopped nuts, butter and flour that added a nice little extra flavor as well. Yum!  Looking forward to having these for breakfast this week.

I loved this recipe. I even took it into work and everyone loved it. I had some of the mixture left over and put that in a heart cake tin which came out amazing. My pic is in the gallery above. I did only place 3/4 cup sugar and added vanilla extract. It was beautiful the bananas after baking were lovely and still gooey throughout the muffin and tasted even nicer with nutella spread. I will definitely be making these again

Very good recipe! I baked then for about 23 minutes and I didn't add walnuts, but I'm sure they would have been delicious with them, I just didn't have any.

I added about a cup of sour cream, an extra banana and some vanilla. I couldn't find my cinnamon and I wish I could have added a heaping teaspoon. After reading all the other reviews I also cut it back to 1/2 cup sugar. The sweet tooth in me wishes I had kept it maybe at the 3/4 cup sugar. Otherwise it turned out really well and was easy to make!

Instead of regular sugar, I used organic evaporated cane juice crystals.  In place of the vegetable oil, I used Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.  I added 1/8t cinnamon and 1/8t nutmeg.  In place of the walnuts I used pecans.  I have celiac so I used Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour by Bobs Red Mill.  Baked them at 350 for 27 minutes  and they are AWESOME!!

It's a good starting point. I took some advice from others and cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup an added some vanilla. Still just a tad bland. Next time I will probably try brown sugar.

Loved how easy it was to make this recipe. My 3 year old daughter was able to add all the ingredients herself. I would maybe add another banana to make it a bit more moist.

This is the least favorite recipe I've ever made. I can smell and taste the oil. And, I should've followed the recipe and not read the comments about cutting the sugar. I guess I like mine sweet.

My kitchen is gluten free...so I substituted white rice flour for about 3 3/4 cups...and added 3 heaping tablespoons of milled flax seed.  I also used organic coconut oil and half white sugar and half brown sugar...a little less than the recipe called for.

These muffins are ok, but lacking in spices and texture.

Spices: I add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a hint of ginger. I also stir in a tsp of vanilla.

Texture: I have never baked them as long as suggested, and still they tend to come out a bit dry. Shorten the baking time to about 25 minutes and check.

Next time I make them, I will substitute apple sauce for the vegetable oil in hopes of softer and moister muffins.

I just made this recipe.  I changed a few things to suit my cupboard and taste:  used 2 bananas, added 1/2c sour cream, 1tbls vanilla, 1/4c flax meal, 2 tbls chia seeds, and 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, and almonds instead of walnuts.  Plus a ton of warm spices.  This recipe is great because it is forgiving to adaptations, but still tastes great.

Great recipe! I used 1cup whole wheat flour and 1all purpose.  I didn't have any nuts. I used 4 bananas+  added some shredded coconut in the last few. I did only use 1/2c sugar thanks to the reviews. I froze them and love toasted with Apple butter! Will keep this in my breakfast rotation for sure!

I loved this recipe! I used 5 ripe bananas because I had a lot of extra ripe bananas that I didn't want to go to waste. I think more bananas make them a lot softer. I also only had 3/4 cup of white flour so I added whole wheat flour to make up the rest of the 2 cups. Instead of a cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of brown which I thought gave it enough sweetness. I also used one egg and one egg white and  added a touch of nutmeg. They came out perfecto!

Highly recommend!

This recipe was delicious!! I added a bit more walnuts. It wasn't too sweet and I can't eat sweets much because it makes me sick. This was by far the best banana nut muffin recipe Ive ever eaten.

Very good muffins! My substitutions: 1/2 c. sugar, generous pinch of cinnamon, 1 1/3 c. all-purpose flour + 2/3 c. whole wheat flour, bake for 20 minutes in greased muffin tins. Will definitely make again!

Delicious and easy to make! I've baked these several times, and the muffins have always turned out very moist with a slight crust. As several of the other reviewers suggested, I reduce the sugar amount to 3/4 cup and add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

Very easy recipe to make.  Instead of 1 cup sugar I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added a tsp of vanilla and about a tablespoon of ground cinnamon.  Great kid friendly recipe.

I just made these and they came out dry. I'm not sure if I cooked them for too long. It says 35 mins but I took them out 10 mins earlier.  They're okay. Maybe the bananas weren't ripe enough? Not sure but mine didn't come out very well.  I also used less sugar. Maybe I'll add milk or more oil next time. I also used chocolate chips instead of walnuts.

Just made this recipe (minus the chocolate) as muffins.  Made 12 regular muffins in paper liners, and the remaining 3 in a sprayed muffin pan. I filled each muffin cup almost completely, and they all ended up having a nice, puffy dome on top. All came out beautifully after 25-30 min (sorry I'm not exactly sure!).  I immediately ate one that came out of the sprayed pan and it was DELISH!!  This was so easy to make and I definitely will be making these over and over again.

My family loves these banana bread muffins. They prefer it over a loaf. I leave out the nuts and add a tablespoon of vanilla. A great addition to any breakfast meal or to have as an afternoon snack.

I don't bake often but found this recipe to easy and yummy!  I made it exactly as the recipe instructs but did add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The recipe  is sweet but that's what my house prefers!  Next time, I'll add more walnuts!  This definitely a repeat recipe!

Really good muffins but made a couple changes.  Halved the sugar, added a tsp of baking powder, a tsp of vanilla, and a 1/4 cup of water (didn't have any apple sauce or yogurt) after reading they turned out dry in some of the reviews.  Omitted the nuts but added chocolate chips :)  Cooked them in a fan-assisted oven at 150 Celsius for 20 minutes.

loved it. so good, moist and tasty. i added some vanilla extract and used Brazilian nuts because i didn't have walnuts. phenomenal, and a definitely keeper. i love that it calls for oil instead of the tedious softened butter and mixer.

These are the changes I made--
Decrease sugar by ยฝ;
For flour use half oatmeal or coarse oat flour (I make my own by processing oats in the food processor);
Leave some lumps in bananas, donโt mash completely smooth. 

They donโt rise high (the way I generally prefer--I might try a little baking powder next time), but theyโre phenomenally deliciousโrivaling Taylor Florenceโs recipe anyday! (And, this is super quick and easy).

FANTASTIC!!  Loved these, so easy to make, moist, tasty, just perfect! I did decrease the sugar to about 1/2-3/4 of a cup and baked about 20 mins rather than the stated 30 mins, other than that I didn't make changes. Next time I'll add some vanilla and maybe some chocolate chips- this is a keeper!

Followed exactly except added 1 tsp vanilla. Bake beautifully, YUM!!!!  Made these again this morning...same results. My favorite part of this recipe is all ingredients are in pantry, and comes together very quickly with 2 bowls, no mixer!

This is a great recipe for moist banana muffins. Instead of walnuts, I used about 1/2 cup of regular chocolate chips. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. They didn't need to be in the oven for the full 30 minutes - I took them out after about 25, and they were done. I am definitely going to use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe. I took others suggestion and used 1/2 cup of sugar- seemed just fine. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and stirred in probably a tablespoon of cinnamon. I made half plain and half with mini chocolate chips. Very yummy- my son and dad actually thought they were chocolate chip muffins, they couldn't taste the banana- it's subtle- so if you want a more "banana" taste, maybe add an extra banana.

Made a few changes: used 1/4c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. Sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the muffins before baking them, turned out delicious!

I was really impressed at how light these muffins came out. I didn't overmix the dry parts with the wet parts. Oh, and I also cut the sugar down (like everyone else); mine to 3/4 cups. Everyone loved them! I am definitely keeping this recipe for the future.

Great tasting recipe and easy too. I always follow the recipe as stated the first time and then make adjustments here and there. On this one I add an extra banana to mine but that's only because my kids asked for more of a banana taste.

Wow! Great recipe!  I just made these and they're soooo delicious!  I substituted 1/2 cup of inulin for 1/2 of the sugar.  Not exactly sure why I did that, but they were just perfect nonetheless!  Baked for exactly 30 minutes at 350.  Thanks, Sarah!

I made these today, to use up some bananas.  They were very good.  I did add 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla.  The cinnamon gave them some extra flavor.  My husband really liked them.  I will save this recipe and make them again very soon.  Thanks! !  Rhonda H.

To increase protein, I used 1.5 cups flour and 1/2 cup hemp powder (instead of the 2 cups flour the recipe calls for).  I also decreased the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup.  The bread has turned out tasty, light, and moist!

pretty good and simple recipe. i added some macadamia nuts. cut the sugar like everyone said. next time i'll substitute some applesauce for oil to make it lower fat. be careful not to substitute all applesauce, or it comes out kind of dense and spongy.

I used 4 bananas, and upon others' suggestions, 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I also added about 1tsp cinnamon and couple pinches of nutmeg. Also substituted applesauce for the oil.  I was not impressed with the final result of this recipe.  There was a very flat flavor to it.  It was not sweet, and was not 'banana-y'. I will try other recipes.  Thanks anyway.

This was wonderful, and the kids I nanny for loved them.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time.  They were well done at 30 mins., so I would try 25 - 30 next time.

SUPER! I substituted applesauce for the oil, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. It turned out GREAT. I also used the coconut suggestion because I love coconut. The banana and coconut flavors were just right, not overpowering. I made muffins as well as one small loaf... both were great and turned out super moist. This is my new favorite banana bread/muffin recipe!

Super fantastic muffins!  I was out of white flour so I subbed whole wheat flour and only used 1/2 cup of oil and these still turned out SO good.  I used grated coconut and will certainly make these again.

These were delicious.  My family ate them up in one night.  I only had 2 bananas so I added a cup of banana applesauce and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

The kids are gobbling them down as I type...should have made a double batch, there won't be any left for hubby!!!  I substituted 3/4 c pure maple syrup for the sugar and used about 1/3-1/2 c cocnut...yumm, not to sweet which we like.

Delicious!  I tried several other recipes, and none had the dense, banana bread texture I was looking for.  I took the advice of other reviewers and changed the temperature to 325, and they were still done in 25 minutes.  We're not big fans of nuts, so I omitted those and added a teaspoon of vanilla and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  Out of this world!

I liked this recipe, I did leave out the coconut (don't care much for it and didn't have any around).  I will make again, but maybe add some banana extract and banana bread spice.

Quick, easy, and good. The cooking time was too long, though. I halved the recipe, but I'm not sure how that would effect the cooking time. I took them out of the oven at 26 minutes, but 20-22 would have been about right.

I think the recipe/ingredients are perfect and have made this several times over the past year.  However, I believe the baking time is incorrect.  My oven only takes about 20-25 or so minutes to cook all the way through.  So if this is your first time to make this recipe, keep an eye on the time, since ovens do vary.

Very good.  I was hoping they'd be moister after reading the reviews.  Next time I may add more oil than is called for.

These muffins were awesom!  Simple and quick. My husband can't eat nuts so I added chocolate chips instead. Yummy! Also added cinnamon and nutmeg.  They didn't last very long. Good recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Super banana muffin recipe and quick and easy as well.  I did a few modifications, I used half oat bran flour and added maybe 2 TB of ground flax seed, also topped with a struesel topping from another recipe. Delicious!!!

I thought this was a really good recipe, I only changed it by adding a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  I also did it as a loaf instead of the muffins (I'm lacking my muffin pan at the moment).

I followed the recipe exactly except for the nuts (nut allergy in the house), substituting coconut instead.  So easy and so delicious.  Very moist too.  Will make them again for sure.  Thanks.

Recipe would probably taste very good if I made it exactly as written...only had 2 bananas and tried to be healthy and substitute applesauce for the oil.  Also think I overbaked by a couple minutes. So the flavor was good, but they were a bit dry.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking and that was good.  Will try again.

Wonderful muffins!!!! They turned out very moist. I did use 4 small bananas that were very ripe, added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and cut the cooking time to 23 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were good.  I added 1/4 cup coconut and 1/4 cup pecan pieces, and it tasted like a "healthier" version of italian cream cake...I also decreased sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla

Great.  I used 3/4 c maple sugar and 1/4 white sugar, also, 1/2 c spelt flour and 1 1/2 c white flour.  I also added 1/2 c blueberries instead of the nuts.  Great flavors. I also didnt bake mine as long. Maybe 20 mins was all.  I will use this again.

this has become my favourite muffin recipe. I always use coconut instead of walnuts. I like to make them in the paper cups, they seem to turn out nicer. They freeze really well so I can always have one for breakfast. Thanks!

The muffins were very tasty!!!  The temperature was a little too high. The bottoms turned out a little to brown, and I only baked them for 25 minutes!!!  Next time I will definately lower the teperature.  Great recipe though.

These muffins were easy to make and very moist, however, I'm giving them a 4 because I kept thinking that they were "missing" something in the taste!  Next time I will take other reviewers advice and add coconut and/or cinnamon for more flavor to the batter.
