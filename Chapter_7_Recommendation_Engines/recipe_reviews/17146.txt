I've been making Potato Chip Chicken for my family for years! But for extra flavor and moistness, instead of coating the chicken with melted butter, I rub the chicken with Miracle Whip before coating in the potato chip crumbs. Tip for making potato chip crumbs: Leave the potato chips in the original bag they come in, just snip a very small portion off of one corner at the top to release the air before rolling. The original bag holds up much better during rolling, and the chips cannot escape from it! Also, for an EXTRA-SPECIAL dish that my family loves on special occasions, I drizzle a tiny amount of honey over the chicken just before serving. The salty/sweet combination is Really Yummy!!!

I have been making this for almost 20 years, but I use boneless skinless chicken breasts that I dip in butter (I do not marinate) and crushed regular potato chips that I also add pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to. The leftover butter I pour over and bake for 45 minutes uncovered at 350. It is delicious, moist, and sometimes I make country gravy and pour over it and serve with mashed potatoes.

I didn't marinate it. I thought that was a bit ridiculous. However, I cut my chicken breasts into thin strips and dipped it into milk instead of melted butter. Last time, I dipped anything into melted butter, it burned. I also used Sour Cream & Onion potato chips which gave it a lot of yummy flavor. Overall, it was good.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used peppercorn ranch (old dutch) potato chips - takes more than one cup though. They were so moist on the inside and crispy on the oustside. I did not bother to marinate and I added garlic and parmessan to the butter to make it extra tasty. It only took 30min in my oven and I will definitely make this again!!!!!!!

My sister used to make this for us when we were in high school.  Used regular flavored chips, dipped in melted butter just prior to rolling in chips and baking...not over night. 45 mins too long... chicken will be dry.

Deliciously crunchy!  This is  an excellent oven-fried chicken recipe.  I did not marinate it in the butter, though, just rolled chicken in the butter and  then  rolled in the chip-crumbs.  I used plain chips, but  will try this with other flavors for variety.
UPDATE: I like this  with plain chips,  but it is especially good with BBQ chips.  I thought I would like  Sour Cream 'n' Onion, but am  sorry to report that it didn't add any particular flavor. (In fact the SCO flavor got "lost".)

I have been making this for years. It is my husbands favorite dish.  While I do not marinate my chicken overnight, I do let it sit in the melted butter for a few minutes before coating it with the chips. I always use sour cream and onion chips and drizzle the leftover melted butter over the chicken right before putting it in the oven. I never use any additional seasonings as the flavor of the sour cream and onion chips is enough for us. I comes out nice and crispy with great flavor.

Great recipe for an amateur cook like myself...chicken turned out dry because I didn't tenderize it - OOPS!  I used Fun Yuns as the potato chip and it turned out very tasty.

Chicken was moist even without the marinating which I skipped because I didn't have time.  My family seemed to enjoy this recipe and I let my kids choose the flavour of chips.  I dipped the chicken in melted butter and coated with sour cream and onion chips.  The flavour of the chips really didn't come through but it didn't seem to matter to anyone. I added salt and pepper and a dash of garlic powder to each piece of chicken and baked on a foil covered baking sheet.  35 mins was plenty for the bone in chicken thighs we had.  Will try again with different type of chip.  If you like breaded chicken it's worth a try.

I have used Lays cheddar and sour cream chips, crushed. Really great flavor. I make this for my grandchildren all the time, better than those crummy chicken nuggets at McD's.

I pounded my chicken to about 1/2” for even cooking.  Like many others, I skipped the “marinating” step in this recipe, because I didn’t see the need.  I baked this for less time than the recipes indicates.  Mine were done in about 25-30 minutes.  This is a great way to use up the crumbs left in the bottom of the potato chip bag.  I made Chef John’s Spicy Honey Mustard Sauce to serve along with this.  Very tasty!

I see no marinating to the butter as it just goes solid when cold.  Next time I will try flavored chips.  The chicken was juciy and crunchy.  I will make this again.

My husband and I just finished this and I had to give my input. The chicken was very moist; but the flavor of the chips didn't come through very good. I did not marinated it over night, didn't feel the need to. I will make this again, but will add a little seasoning to the chicken before rolling in the crumbs. If I didn't feel it needed to be tweaked some, I would have given it 5 stars. I did give it a 4 because I will make again, adding some spices!!!

I thought that this was pretty good.  Like others I did not see the point of marinating when you are only using salt and pepper so I skipped this step.  I used regular Lays potato chips and thought that was a good flavor.  With a nice salad made a good and easy dinner.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was delicious!  I had 6 chicken breasts, so I made 2 with regular chips, 2 with sour cream and onion chips and 2 with BBQ chips.  All were fantastic and surprisingly crispy!  I didn't marinate overnight.

My husband is a fan of this and since it's so easy to make I am too.  We have used bbq and sour cream and onion chips, both have worked fine but we prefer the flavour of the sco chips.  I didn't marinate in the butter just ran the chicken through it and baked straight away.

maybe I needed to coat the chicken with more potato chips, but I felt like it could be improved.  Maybe an oven roast finished with a pan sear would have had more flavor.

This was fabulous! What a fantastic substitute for fried chicken! I was really surprised how crunchy of a coating the chips made. I also didn't think the marination made any sense (since the butter just hardens in the fridge). So I salt and peppered the chicken along with some garlic powder, then dipped the chicken in melted butter and immediately rolled it into the finely chopped chips and then baked. Note, if you pound out your chicken, like I do, 45 minutes is a bit too long for cooking. Next time I will probably check it at 38 or 40 minutes. Lastly, I only used a pound of chicken, but still found I needed closer to 4 cups of chips. But my (picky) hubby and I loved it at first bite!

I used large chicken breast halves, but even they were dry at this time and temperature. To me, the coating had no flavor and was not an appealing texture. I don't plan to make this again.

This was such a great change from my normal chicken dishes. I really loved the consistency and salty taste of the chip coating! I will definitely be making this again.

Loved it!  Super simple and delish.  My mom couldn't get enough and demanded the recipe.  I used whatever chips I had on hand, which happened to be some spicy queso kettle cooked chips.  Could not have been tastier!  I will absolutely be making this again and again.

8.9.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17146/potato-chip-chicken/ ... This recipe is the closest I've found to this one: 
 Combine 1 1/2c crushed chips, 1t salt, 1/4t pepper, dash paprika. Combine 2 slightly beaten eggs & 1/4c milk. Dip 2-3# fryer pieces in egg mixture then chip mixture. Melt 1/4c butter in pan. Place chicken in 325 oven 45 minutes. This is from Ruffles chips.  I'm thinking 1 egg & 2T milk would be enough; & just milk/water if ya had an egg issue.  For AR recipe, I don't see the point in marinating in butter, s & p.  I like wavy, not ridged chips.  Wavy are larger, deeper; ridges are small & narrow.  :)

Very yummy, love the crunchiness.  I needed to use up some less than delicious sour cream and onion chips.  This worked perfect. I did not marinate it over night, just sprinkled some pepper before the butter. There was enough salt in the chips.

I marinated it in the fridge overnight, exactly as the recipe says, then when i took it out the next day, it was one big solid lump of chicken and butter. So i filled the sink with hot water and put the marinating dish in, left it for 10 minutes, it was still solid. So i emptied the water out of the sink, boiled the kettle and filled the sink up with boiling water, and left the marinating dish in there for about 5 minutes. I opened the lid and most of the butter was still solid but also most of the chicken had turned white. Now i have no idea how long to put it in the oven for as it's already partially cooked.

It was pretty good.  I only had time to marinate it in the butter for an hour.  Totally forgot that one person couldn't have dairy so got a little flustered thinking how to prepare two a different way with all kinds of other things going on and people coming over for dinner.  The chicken was very moist.  I should have added some more seasoning but forgot.  I used French onion dip potato chips (except for the person who couldn't have any dairy - they got plain) and took the advise of one of the reviewers to leave them in the potato chip bag to crush.  I probably should have rolled it a little more but I had run out of time.  Still very good, I would just add more spices to it.  Would I make it again?  Yes.
