Really good - I added a can of tomato paste and and half a can of coconut milk so that there was more sauce.  I served it as suggested using Cous cous instead of rice.  I will definitely make this again

My family liked this!  I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts (that's what I had on hand).  I also used 1 jalapeno pepper, as I am kind of a wimp when it comes to spice level. I could have handled more . . . and hubby wanted a LOT more!  That's what's nice, is that you can adjust this recipe to your own liking by the type of pepper you use and how much. A couple of criticisms - the cooking time of the asparagus is way off.  I boiled mine for 3-4 minutes until they were crisp/tender (mine were fairly thin, about like a pencil).  Even for extremely thick asparagus - 12 minutes is too long. I also only cooked the chicken mixture for about 20 minutes.  I think 45 minutes would have turned the mango and tomatoes to mush.  Just my opinion.  Overall, good dish.  I'd make again.

Upfront, I mangled the recipe.  Dwindled it to two servings. Used leftover rice already cooked, and chicken thighs. But the flavors I was wanting are here.  I had all the ingredients in different forms. but the tomato mango onion spice mix rocks! I had chicken thighs.  removed skin, left bone in.  Had two ready to eat mangos, sliced and diced those.  ended up having to make my own curry powder because I only had a teaspoon full but enough of the other ingredients to make 1/4  cup curry powder. .Had leftover rice from last night and asparagus that needed to be cooked.  Rubbed the curry powder on the chicken, saut√©ed with the onions (I also added bell peppers) mixed tomatoes and mangoes together and poured  over stewing chicken.  A couple drops of sriacha was good too.  I was looking for flavors to use what I had from leftovers and this did it - only had to open a can of tomatoes.   Point is - good flavor combination, easy to prepare if you have everything.  (I found this by doing the ingredient search knowing I had mangos and asparagus)

Thought this recipe was really good. Adding more spices was key. I added hot curry to give it more kick.  I also didn't have serrano chiles (I used jalapeno instead) which probably would have given it more flavor as well.
