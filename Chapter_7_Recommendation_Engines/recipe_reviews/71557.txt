This is a great salad!  I made it this past weekend for my family they all loved it.  However, I think the recipe was meant to be used with 'balsamic vinagarette salad dressing' instead of the balsamic vinegar.  That's what I did and it turned out great!

This is a very good summer type salad.  I used Italian dressing and only used the shrimp.  It was very yummy.

Made without chicken.  Used balsamic vinegarette dressing as another reviewer suggested. I shredded carrot rather than diced it. It was a beautiful salad and it is a definite have again. May use more dressing next time.

Wonderful summer salad. Left out the tomatoes but added crushed nuts cashews and almonds, a two hard boiled eggs. I also pan fried the chicken in olive oil coated in montreal seasoning. I made my own balsamic dressing too (with a bit of brown sugar which added) It was so delicious!

This was good, but it could have used a little more shrimp and feta, in my opinion.  I used 16 oz. chicken and that was the perfect amount.

I made it exactly as listed and it just wasn't great. I like all of the ingredients, but the balsamic vinegar wasn't a great choice of "sauce". It made a really dry salad.  Perhaps I should've tried the balsamic VINEGARETTE as others suggested.

I really enjoyed this pasta salad.  I used elbow macaroni because it's what I had.  I also used a low fat balsamic vinaigrette, which everyone added to their own pasta at the table.  I served this with Chloe's Quick Fruit Salad for an easy, fast summer dinner.

Loved this recipe! I omitted the chicken and carrots. I served the balsamic vinaigrette on the side.
