My kids and I loved them!  You cannot tell the difference.  We used 1/2 cup cornstarch, 1/2 cup brown rice flour and 1 1/4 cup white rice flour for the baking mixture.  I used a real egg.  I also added 1 tablespoon milk because they were thick and cooked 10 min.  They were fabulous!

the picture of these cookies is kind of deceptive, i always do a tester cookie before dropping all the cookies on the sheet. when i did it spread about 8" in diameter and about 1/8" thick. . .not really a cookie.  so i added almost 2 more cups of the gluten free baking mix before it was passable.  but the taste was really incredible, definitely worth the extra time.  i made them for a friend who can't have wheat. . but i think they may be better than regular chocolate chip cookies.

Thank you for this recipe!!  These were definitely the BEST gluten-free & egg-free cookie I have made.  However I will make some changes next time I make them.  First I will add probably a 1/2 to a full cup more of the baking mix (without doing this the cookies came out more like lace cookies) and I will either cut back on the salt or baking soda (they were a little salty for our taste.)  I used gluten-free, dairy-free chips and cut the sugar back to 1 c. of brown sugar only.  I think with more sugar they would've been WAY too sweet.  My whole family loves them.  The bigger the spoonful the better the cookie.

**Since writing the previous rating, I have tinkered with this recipe and have come up with the following changes:  add 1/2 c. Teff flour to the dry ingredients, use only 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  I use about 1/2 bag of "Enjoy Life" chocolate chips.  I scoop out about a 2" ball and flatten it before baking.  Super yummy!!

OK I read many many reviews on this recipe, since I've been on a quest for the perfect GF choc chip cookie recipe for a while now.  The search is over- this recipe really is that much better than the others!  The cookies are soft/chewy on the inside and crisp on the edges- seriously perfect, and I bake a LOT so I'm tough to please.  Here's what I'd recommend on the tweaks, based on the other reviews and my experience:  I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup, NOT the white sugar, since white sugar adds the crispiness.  I think even with the full amount of sugar it would be fine.  I used 1.5 eggs, although if you use 2 eggs just up the flour a bit more.  I used 2 3/4 cup GF flour (used Bob's GF flour, which also requires 3/4 tsp xanthan gum be added).  Cut the salt in half (1/2 tsp) or leave it out if your baking mix has salt in it.  Definitely SIFT the dry ingredients as recommended since this makes the cookies softer and minimizes the graininess.  If your cookies spread too much, add more flour to stiffen the dough.  With the proportions above, I had a totally normal consistency dough.  I dropped them onto the cookie sheet and pressed them a bit since the cookies didn't spread on their own.  Finally, bake them til the edges/tips are slightly browned.  This recipe makes a large-ish batch but I'm so glad I doubled it because these cookies ROCK!

Very good recipe.  Just started to bake gluten and dairy free so this recipe was a good experiment.  I modified it a bit - dairy free chips and added some xanthan gum.  Also have no problems with eggs so did not use egg substitute, used 2 eggs.  I used a combination of white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca flour for the glutem-free baking mix.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is fantastic not to miss out on the sweet treats.

These cookies tend to be dry and crumbly  if you use "Egg Replacer" as the egg substitute.  Instead of all the baking
mix, try using 1/4-to-1/2 cup of potato starch to add more moisture to the dough ...

These are the best gluten free cookies ever.  My friends can't tell the difference.  I had a hard time not eating the whole batch myself!  Yummy!

Crispy on edges and soft and slightly chewy on inside partly due to the following modification: since dough was too crumbly with just egg substitute, I added 1 egg. Also I used 50/50 butter and Smart Balance margarine. I also added a cup of chopped walnuts. Yummy! I had to bag  and freeze cookies in order to keep from eating too many.

I decided to try this recipe because my boyfriend is deathly allergic to eggs. Since gluten is fine for him, I used regular vanilla extract and all-purpose flour instead of gluten-free baking mix. For the egg substitute I used 3 Tbsp water and 3 tsp baking powder (1/4 cup). Also, I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips because they're the best! My boyfriend said these cookies were the best thing he's ever tasted. My mother's words: "Wow - I guess you really don't need eggs at all." Be sure to check the ingredients on the chocolate chip cookies, though. I bake these cookies for 9 minutes, and when I made this recipe, it yielded FIVE dozen cookies that were a big hit with everyone who tried them!!

EDIT: My mom has a friend whose son is allergic to gluten. However when she tried the recipe with gluten-free baking mix, the cookies flattened into formless, crispy, cookie pancakes after being removed from the oven. What happened?? Any suggestions? (But these cookies are still AWESOME with regular flour!)

Holy mother of GOD....these actually are the best cookies, gluten free or otherwise,I have ever had.  I have a wheat allergy as does my sister so I appreciate this greatly.  Following the lead of another members review, I used 1/4 cup corn starch, 1/4 cup potato starch, 1/2 cup brown rice flour and 1 1/4 cups white rice flour in place of the baking mix.  I also used one whole egg, since I didn't need it to be egg free.  Delicious!!  These bake great, spread evenly, brown without burning and are chewy on the inside but crisp on the edges. WOW.  Next time I will add pecans.  .

Great for my son who is anaphylactic to milk and allergic to eggs. 
You can find dairy free chocolate chips in some supermarkets now (I go to Save on Foods (Canada)).

The only Problem with these cookies are getting them into the oven. The batter is soooo good. My cookies are still in the oven, but they look and smell great. I used equal parts brown rice flour, Glutinous rice flour, Tapioca Flour and arrowroot flour. I also used yogurt for the egg substitute (Coconut milk yogurt, plain). This recipe could also be easily changed to make it dairy free as well. By using Palm shorting instead of butter, and the dairy free chocolate chips. I use semi sweet chocolate chips from soyfreesales.com they are free of most common allergens.
Back again:
I have made these cookies many times now. using several varieties of GF flours. They are not all good my favorite purchased brand is namaste's biscuit and pie crust mix. But what I have found out if you freeze the batter first. It greatly improves the texture. Just portion the dough then freeze. Place frozen cookies straight into preheated oven cook until just starting to brown and then cool on the baking sheet.

These are excellent!  My gluten-free mix consists of white rice flour, sorghum flour, Tapioca flour, and Potato starch. I also added 1 tsp of Xanthan Gum, which I think is helpful in most gluten-free recipes. I omitted the salt as suggested by others, and used 2 eggs instead of egg-replacer.  I also cut the sugar by using 1/2 cup brown, 1/4 cup white, and 1/4 cup Splenda. The chips provide enough sweetness so the cookie didn't need it.  As with most wheat-free recipes, the batter is sticky.  I used my smallest cookie scoop, and flattened the ball to 1 1/2-2".  The 2 test cookies I baked didn't look done at 8 minutes, so I baked them 2 more minutes.  They tasted burnt, even though they didn't look it.  So I baked the rest for 8 minutes and they were perfect.  I got about 50 2" cookies.

This was the first GF recipe I've tried. I give it 5 stars with the following modifications (based on the other reviews I read): 2 eggs instead of egg substitute; no salt; 3 1/2 C. GF baking mix. Unlike others I did not think they were too sweet. My baking mix was 2 c. white rice flour, 1 c. tapioca starch and 1/2 c. sorghum flour. It was excellent; my 5-year-old son loves them and didn't think they taste any different than standard cookies. Thank you for this recipe!

Wow! Really good. I used the Arrowhead Mills GlutenFree Baking Mix and it worked perfectly. The only thing I might change next time is a little less salt. They seemed a tad on the salty side.

I made this recipe using the recommendation by one of the first reviews, 1/2 c cornstarch, 1/2 cup brown rice flour and 1 1/2 cup white rice flour and a real egg (no allergies here) and they were terrific!!! We were amazed at how great they tasted. I have already made a second batch.

These cookies are awesome!  I used Bobs Redmill GF baking mix (it recommends using xanthan gum, but I did not add it) and they still turned out soft.  
I also cut the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white.  
For the egg replacer I used ground flax seed.  (1 TBSP ground flax seed per 3 TBSP water is equal to one egg) I used enough to replace 2 eggs.  
I also used dairy free chocolate chips.  I was amazed that these tasted as good as they did.

These are great cookies if you do as other reviewers have suggested.  Half or quarter the salt (1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt), eliminate the white sugar, and add 2 more cups of gluten free mix to thicken the batter and your batter will be perfect and really tasty.  Otherwise it is too salty and your cookie melts to an 1/8 in and 5-6inches wide. Hope this helps!

Amazing!  Wow!  Can't believe how good these cookies are.  Definitely use the egg-replacer (the equivalent to 2 eggs) and beat until frothy and thickened.  These probably were the best cookies we've tried since finding out our children are allergic to dairy and eggs.  We substituted regular flour.  NOTE: Bake these cookies at a lower temp (350 degrees) for a 9-10 minutes; otherwise they spread too thin.

Fantastic. This is the best I have found. Cookies looked just like the photo. I made Alton Browns and they spread way out and didnt have the flavor of these cookies. I used Bette Hagmans flour mix. Did suggestions of no salt or white sugar, used 2 eggs and 3c GF flour. They lasted long in a container without getting crumbly and froze very well too. This is my staple for Chocoalte chip cookies and my kids and hubby agree. Thanks so much!

I am a GF, DF and egg free wife and mother of three. No one else in this house shares my allergy!!! I've made these cookies many times and I cant tell you enough how good they are. We follow the recipe exactly and use the Bob's Red Mill All-purpose flour replacer or a homemade blend that uses garbonzo or fava bean flours as the main. No one knows, no the neighbors or the kids and they are astounded when you tell them!

These cookies are amazing, they dont taste GF at all! I made it for my husband, who is celiac, and my kids ended up eating most of the cookies. They want me to make this recipe all the time. I mixed my own GF baking mix by blending brown rice, tapioca and almond flours. This is a winner! Thanks for the recipe....

SMITHERS22, if you're still reading this...
You need to check the baking mix she used- some, like Bob's Red Mill AP mix, require the addition of xanthan gum as a gluten replacement, others like Pamela's mix already have it in there.
I have found that sticking my cookie mix in the fridge for at least an hour or so (or the freezer for 20 minutes, if I'm feeling lazy) and putting it back while the cookies are baking instead of just leaving it out on the counter helps prevent against flat cookie sadness.  You could also try adding more baking mix.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have found since going gluten-free.  I did make a few changes, I omitted the white sugar and salt, used 2 eggs in lieu of egg substitute, and added 3 cups of gluten-free flour.  My kids could not tell they were gluten-free and my friends loved them.  Thank you for a great gluten-free recipe!!

Great reciipe.I used two eggs and only 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also listened to other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of oatmeal to make the dough less runny.  The cookie came out nice and crisp.

I'm Gluten, egg and dairy free.  I used Smart Balance for butter, Gluten-free Bisquick for the baking mix and dairy free choc chips.  I also found the dough to be crumbly so I added 1/4 to 1/2 C applesauce and that helped a lot...and I can't taste it either.  The dough tastes great!  And the cookies are a bit crunchy on the edges but wow, they're great!!  :)  Thanks!!

These ROCK!!! I used organic coconut spead instead of butter and non dairy choc chips. I also added 1/4c of apples sauce so wouldn't be dry after reading the reviews along w/ putting the batter in fridge to harden. Can't wait for the holiday cooking, gluten free is fun with your help.

These are SO GOOD!!! I read that people were finding that it was dry with the egg replacer, I found this to be true, so I put 1/4 cup of apple sauce in the mix. I think that these are better than, the wheat and egg ones. These are YUMMY as my 3y/o tells me.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, I was looking for a recipe to make for a friend and was shocked to see you needed gluten free vanilla. I did an online search and found a site that says it is not necassary to buy gluten free extracts or vinegars as the distillation process kills all gluten! As it was written by a woman with Celiac Disease and she's the auther of a cookbook, gluten free of course, I would tend to take her word on this. Oh yes alcohols are safe too!

These are like little cookie cakes from heaven! Both my son and I are gluten free, and we haven't had a decent chocolate chip cookie in forever. I've tried numerous recipes with no luck, and all the pre-packaged stuff you buy tastes awful.  I made a few substitutions because I needed something quick to bring for a birthday party and didn't have any butter on hand. I replaced the butter with 1 cup of fat free vanilla yogurt, used 2 eggs, and only used 1 cup brown sugar and no white sugar (since the yogurt was already sweet). I also added 1 tsp xanthan gum.   It made a batch of 28 cookies. I am making these again FOR SURE!

These are great!  I used a combination of potato flour, rice flour and tapioca flour.  I added a 1/2 tsp of xantham gum, a 1/2 tablspoon of soy milk and used a real egg.  They turned out really well.

I made these twice and the second batch was MUCH better. The first time I used the rice flour, cornstarch mixture recommended here. Second batch I switched to 1 1/4 cup rice flour, 1/4 cup potato starch, 1/4 cup tapioca flour. This mixture was MUCH better. I used 2 eggs, 1tsp. xantham gum instead of baking powder, and dark brown sugar instead of light brown. 
The batter is thick, so spread the cookies out before baking. Bake only for 6-8 minutes. They will not brown as nicely as wheat cookies, and they get very dry is overcooked.

really yummy if you do not over bake. changes i made 1/2 cup whole cane sugar or Sucanat , 1/4 cup blue agave, 2 eggs, 1 tbls almond milk vanilla flavor, 1/2 cup sorghum flour, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp guar gum, dark chocolate chips baked 6 minutes at 350 no more otherwise cookies were crumbly. Defiantly not regular chocolate chip cookies, but really really yummy with changes i made and not to over cook. would have given 5 stars if i did not have to make so many improvements.

I have celiac and do not often find gluten free cookie recipes that are worth eating, but these were amazing. I made these cookies but substituted two eggs for the egg substitute. My family, who don't usually eat GF foods, tried them and asked me to make them again because they all loved them so much.  Light, tasty and delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I can't believe so many people said these are good. They have a metallic taste and I'm pretty sure it's from the teaspoon of salt. Maybe without the salt they'd be OK, but I had to pitch them all and am sad I wasted all of my expensive organic ingredients on this recipe!

It may have been the gluten free mixture I was using but the amount of sugar to flour mixture is too much sugar! If you don't want to cookies to flatten out and make one big cookie halve the amount of sugar and margarine, use 3/4 tsp of baking soda and baking powder. After done they were awesome. If needed add a little milk or water to make to mixture moist

Thank You for this wonderful recipe!!!  My 2 year old daughter is allergic to eggs and this cookie recipe is the best!  I have adapted these for Christmas with green & red cherries with milk chocolate chips.  Haven't found them grainy.  Thanks again!

These cookies were delicious! I used one egg instead of substitue and followed everything else. Baked for 9 min and they were perfect. Soft and chewy and my office loved them. They taste no different than regular chocolate chip cookies.

These turned out flat as a pancake using the recipe to the tee.  They are also very sweet!  I will use others suggestions, reducing the sugar, and adding more flours. It also may depend on what flours you use. I use a combo of tapioca flour, sorguhm flour, and potato starch.  I added more flour to my second batch, and they are looking MUCH better!  We'll see how they taste.

I made this according to the recommendations in the reviews...  an extra 1/2 c. GF flour, 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar. The salt, sugar was fine, but it was too much flour. When I make this the next time, I will make te recipe and only add enough flour to get the right consistency (if any is needed at all). I really appreciated having this recipe for chocolate chip cookies! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Tasted great, but Can anyone tell me why my cookies spread out flat?  I used margarine instead of butter and 2 eggs instead of egg replacement.  Any ideas?  They fell apart too but I think that's because of the absence of xantham gum.

These are incredible.  I used vegan margarine, gluten free AP flour and flax seed meal and water as my egg replacer (1tbsp meal in 3 tbsp warm water).  Mine took 10 minutes to bake and they are pure delicious perfection.  I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp after reading other reviews.  I also added closer to 2.5 c of flour and then ended up needing a few more tbsp of margarine, so I would say the recipe is perfect as it is!

These taste great!  Thank you, thank you!!  I used two eggs instead of the egg substitute and increased the flour by 1/4 cup.  As other reviewer's suggested, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 (left out some of the brown), and they're plenty sweet.  Instead of baking powder, I added 1 tsp xanthan gum just because it was recommend by my GF baking mix.  Even my 14 year old gobbled them up, knowing they are GF!

These were pretty good for a gluten free cookie.  I'm celiac, so to find a decent chocolate chip cookie recipe is a big deal.  I used vanilla bean and demerara sugar (which is similar to brown, but it's a bit more moist and coarse).   I left it in the refrigerator overnight to let the flavours really develop.  Also, I used earth balance instead of butter because I'm vegan.  

Wonderful, thanks.

These came out great! I like the crispy edges, soft center.  I modified by adding 1/2 tsp of Xantham Gum for the 2 cups of flour I used, and I also used a real egg, and added 1/4 cup of oats.  They took 10 min to bake on 360.  These taste just as good to me as the traditional.  YUM!

This recipe was great!! The cookies baked perfectly and are still chewy! Definitely better than I've made with flour, that's for sure. Based on others' recommendations, I did change it a bit. For the baking mix, I used: 1/2 cornstarch, 1/2 brown rice flour, and 1 1/4 cup white rice flour like one reviewer said, as well as 1 tsp of xantham gum. I also used 2 eggs instead of 1 because the mixture was a bit dry. I think next time I will use more brown rice flour just for nutrition. I'm not a celiac patient, but plan on being a gastroenterologist when I graduate from med school; as a result, I wanted to experiment with gluten-free recipes. This website is by far, better than any cookbook I've looked at!! :)

This came out better than my wheat/egg cookies ever did.  I live at high altitude (over 7,000 ft), and finally made a soft, chewy cookie, thanks to this recipe!  My only substitution was vegetable shortening instead of butter.  I used Bob's Red Mill General Purpose Baking Flour, with about a teaspoon of xantham gum, for my baking mix.  I had no problems with runny dough using this version.  Thanks for bringing home-baked cookies back to my kitchen!

We tried this, wanted to love it, but just couldn't.  We used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Flour, which states on the front that it is ideal for cookies, cakes and the like, but they just ended up tasting like bean pods with chocolate.  \

My husband and I really enjoyed these cookies. I used white and brown rice flour instead of the baking mix and they turned out great. I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla and added some oatmeal (a little healthier). I will defiantly use this recipe again!

Excellent! I made these for my husband who thought I was making homemade cookies with flour. He loved them! He even said they were better than his recipe. Then I told him they were GF and he didn't believe me.  I only had 1 c brown sugar so I added more white sugar to make up for it. Next time I'll use the recommended amount of brown sugar because I think it made the cookies not as sweet. The chocolate chips made up for it and they were great. I also didn't use salt.

more of a 3 and 1/2 star. This recipe was....fine. The problem is that they turn out flat and practically clear...and very grainy. I used this recipe  quite often, and added 1/2 a cup more baking mix. I tried adding more another time but they became too "floury" and yucky. I would suggest another website for gluten free recipes. I love allrecipes but for gluten free baking they jst dont suffice. Go to websites that are for gluten free recipes. They also tend to be vegan.

My friend who is wheat-intolerant said these were really yummy treats.  She and her family enjoyed them.  My family said they were good.  I thought they were yucky.  They were very crunchy.  I used Red Mill biscuit and baking mix.  Maybe there is a better mix to use?

Delicious! These gluten free cookies taste just like the real thing! Following other reviews I cut out the white sugar, used 2 eggs in place of the egg substitute and actually omitted the salt. They are wonderful cookies! I am going to pass this recipe on! Thanks!

After a few tweeks, these cookies are amazing! I added more vanilla and used chopped toasted pecans instead of walnuts. Ended up tastier than the other batch I prepared that day containing wheat flour. I only slightly reduced the sugar amount and enjoyed the best gluten-free dessert I've prepared so far!

This is much better than store bought!  I did make some subs:  mixed in gluten-free, casein-free shortening with GFCF margarine, used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 egg, reduced salt to 1/4 tspn (I used Arrowhead GF baking mix which already had salt in it - could be why others mentioned theirs was salty?)  Mine were a little flat and crispy but not to the point of becoming one big cookie on the sheet.  Still delicious - kids loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you Ms. Arnold!  My mom is allergic to wheat and these were perfect!  What's better is, the rest of the fam liked them better than she did!  My brother didn't even realize they were wheatfree when he tasted them, he just said, 'wow these are good'.  So I sent some back to his roommate and he loved them in blissful ignorance, too!  Apart from being slightly grainy, which you can't really tell unless you're looking for it, these are fabulous.

Good flavor but as written makes very thin cookies. Read other reviews before making to help you make necessary adjustments.

I thought the cookies were really good, not too much different than normal wheat cookies with the exception of the texture. I used Brown rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch and rice flour so maybe that is why. Texture looked more like oatmeal. They were a little crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. Mine baked way longer than 6-8 minutes. I had them in for 12 minutes at 375 but I think 11 minutes would have been perfect. I have a baking business for cookies and cakes (wheat) and let me tell you, this gluten-free baking is a whole new ball of wax. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because it is way too sweet. Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1 cup and see how it is. I haven't been eating sugar for 30 days so that maybe why as my friends laughed at me when I said they were too sweet.

I baked these 2 different ways. The first way by the oven I would give them about 3.5-4 stars. They were a little browned, flattened, and misshaped. Not a very pretty cookie. The second way I used my NuWave Oven. I baked them in it on the 2" tray, lined with foil and sprayed with PAM. I baked them on medium power for about 12 minutes, I believe, from dough balls I had froze with a cookie scoop. They looked pretty, or more like the picture, this time, and had a nice soft texture. GF baking mix, is essentially ground rice, potato starch, and tapioca starch. So, don't be expecting a wheat flour baked texture. GF baked goods are more of a starchy taste with a slight graininess. I am comparing them to other GF cookies I have tried, especially the bagged ones at the store, and they are rather descent. Only change I made was making 1/2 recipe and subbing 1 egg for the egg subtitute suggested. Making 1/2 recipe yielded 28 cookies using a cookie scoop. I used dark chocolate and I did like that these weren't overly sweet tasting.

Good cookies that everyone liked.  I added xanthum gum (1/2 tsp.) and used a whole fresh egg. Baked them on parchment paper. They held together well and raised like a wheat made cookie. These were my first attempt at homemade cookies and pleasantly surprised.  BTW, I added the xanthum gum to the sugar/egg mixture not the flour. I also left out the salt, as I need low sodium as well as GF diet.

I am newly GF and knew I couldn't do this without a good chocolate chip cookie. This is the first one I tried and won't waste my time on any others. It was PERFECT! Dare I say as good as AP Flour cookies? They were soft and rose very well! 
*If you had trouble with them rising make sure your soda is NEW, less than 2 months old. It should flow out of the box (don't scoop) with no clumps. I never use butter, always margarine (tub or stick, I used a tub this time) and have never had a problem. It is already soft and chilled. Put your baking sheet in the freezer each time before you drop the cookies so they don't spread before entering the oven. I also chill my dough between batches. 
Here is how I made mine:
Tub butter
Same type/amount of sugars
Regular vanilla extract (not a celiac so i'm not too worried)
2 eggs
Same baking soda
NO baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 C quick oats
1/2 bag of chopped nuts and chocolate chips

GF Baking Mix:
1 1/2 cups white or brown rice flour
1/2 cup potato starch (not potato flour)
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1 tsp xanthan gum

These are SO good, soft & moist. Cannot tell the difference between these & cookies made with all-purpose refined wheat flour. I am not sensitive to gluten or eggs, I just like trying other grains & avoiding wheat. I used kamut flour (apparently has gluten) and 1 egg in place of the egg-substitute. We love the results. Thank you for a great wheat alternative cookie recipe!

This was my very first gluten free recipe I tried and I was pleasantly surprised.   For baking mix I used a pre-mix brand called Tom Sawyer (I bought it at the health food store nearby).  I added two eggs.

I would definitely suggest keeping the cookies on the cookie sheet for at least 2 minutes after cooking as suggested in the recipe.  Otherwise the cookies will crumble.   Next time I might add a tablespoon of milk.

I got plenty of compliments on these. I made my own GF baking mix (a hodge-podge of white rice flour, glutinous rice flour, sorghum flour, tapioca flour, cornstarch, and xanthum gum) and used 2 eggs (no substitute in the house!). The cookies are thick and chewy and SO EASY TO MAKE! Texture of the dough was perfect: the variations of thickness seen by other reviewers have to be based on choice of baking mix. Thank you for such an simple, tasty GF recipe.

I found this recipe when I grew tired of paying $5 a box for the Betty Crocker mix.
After I had everything all mixed up I was SO excited to see that it actually looked like regular cookie dough instead of a dry crumbly mess. However the uncooked dough does not taste good at all. Infact, I wasn't going to bake them due to the terrible flavor. My mom talked me into baking them and OMG I am SO glad she did they are AMAZING!!!! I did find they stuck to the aluminum foil even though  had sprayed it. I plan on using Reynolds Release next time.

Great gluten free cookie recipe!  They held together well, taste good, and you'd never know there wasn't egg & gluten in them!  Based on other reviews - I used a little more flour (1 c Pamela's GF baking mix, 1 c Sorghum flour, and 1/3 c coconut flour - which uses up a lot of liquid).   I added 1 tsp Guar Gum for consistency, and used 1 T chia seed soaked in 3 T water until gummy as my egg replacer.   I used 1 c choc chips, and 1/2 c pecans too.   All my egg & gluten eating friends loved these!

This is a great recipe, I've served it at school functions and these cookies get gobbled up!  I like to decrease the chocolate chips by half and add in some raisins and a teaspoon to two of cinnamon.  Yumm!!!

Really good but off course the results will be based on what Gluten free Baking mix you use9too much rice flour and you may get a grainy texture, too much bean and thus a bean taste).  I used full eggs, no need for egg substitute in my house.

Maybe the different review results have something to do with the brand of GF flour?  I used Bob's which is bean based - and I could definitely taste it in the dough, but the cookies themselves were wonderful and I couldn't tell the difference between these and toll house.  I did use 2 eggs and I did add 1 tsp xanthan gum, and reduced baking soda to 1/2 tsp (I can always taste it when I am not countering it with an acid).  The first couple batches spread nicely, but stuck to pan more than traditional cookies, but the last batch I used parchment paper and they came right off.  Mine looked just like the picture.  Really a nice treat for my wheat intollerant daughter.

GLUTEN-FREE/DAIRY-FREE/EGG FREE TWEAKS: Made these today/delicious, but daughter detected aftertaste of either baking soda or powder, so next time I'll eliminate the baking pwdr (original Toll House cookies only use bkng soda so why would one use both baking soda and baking powder? I will try to find out...)   My changes:  Increased butter to 1 cup & used a dairy-free  butter spread from Whole Foods;  Increased vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp;  Used 3 tsp EnerG Egg Replacer mixed with 4 tbsp water (as per box instr) This equals 2 eggs;  Decreased brown sugar to 3/4 cup;  Substituted 1/2 cup agave syrup for the white sugar;  Used Red Mill all purpose baking mix & increased to 1 1/2 cups to make up for liquid agave;  Decreased salt to 3/4 tsp;   Used 2 c dairy-free choc chips; .  Baked 10 mins 375 degree oven.   Cookies are crisp w/slightly soft middle. Almost perfect! (but no bkng pwdr next time!)

This was my first attempt at gluten free baking and it went surprisingly well. I didn't have time to run to the health food store so my only choice of flour was sof'ella gluten free all purpose baking mix. It includes baking powder, baking soda, vanilla powder and sea salt in the ingredients so I omitted these from the recipe. I went ahead and used two eggs because I am not sensitive to them. For the sugar I used 1 cup turbinado and 1/4 cup pure organic cane sugar. The dough was fantastic too. Much better than regular cookie dough in my opinion : ) I followed another reviewers suggestion to freeze the cookie dough after dropping it onto the cookie sheets for about 10 minutes before baking them. They only took about 6 or 7 minutes to cook and while some of them looked not quite ready I pulled them anyway because the bottoms were slightly brown. They were perfect after cooling for a few minutes. Overall, they turned out great! They are not as heavy as regular cookies but I expected that with the gluten free rice flour/navy bean flour in the baking mix. They were chewy and delicious and most importantly my husband approved which is very rare when I try to bake something 'healthy'. Great recipe, thank you!

These were a great texture. I did chill the dough for about an hour, and they did not spead much at all. My hubby said they look like store bought. Used GF Panty AP flour, and made sugar substitutions as well. Also used a couple of eggs rather than egg replacer. In short, this is a wonderfully adaptable GF recipe. I bet it is phenomenal with real sugar! Thanks for the great recipe. =)

I'm always looking for gluten free goodies to make for my niece who is sensitive to gluten and I feel bad that she can't eat all the 'good stuff' like the rest of us.  I didn't have a gluten free baking mix so I made my own consisting of 1/2 c tapioca flour, 1/2 c Quinoi flour, 1/2 c buckwheat flour and 3/4 c oat flour.  I then added 2 tsp of xantham powder to ensure it all 'sticks' (I found this all at the grocery store, Real Canadian Superstore or Loblaws). I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. and used 1 egg instead of the substitute. I used 3/4 c of margarine instead of the butter and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  I always use a mixture of milk chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips when making choc chip cookies, I think they taste even better that way.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my first successful attempt at baking cookies!  Before this it was all store bought, but a professor of mine can't consume gluten products. So I decided to give this a try.  He loved it!  According to him, every other gluten free cookie has tasted like chalk, so he gave up trying, but he actually wants this recipe from me! Everyone else in my department also loved them and my friends couldn't even taste the difference.    I did use 1 egg instead of the egg-substitute, and the recommended scooping size is perfect for small cookies for munching.  Also, I baked in my oven for 6.5 minutes to get the right chewy consistency. Any longer and the cookies became hard and burnt on the underside.  Warning though, this recipe makes A LOT of cookies.

I was looking for a recipe that looked like my moms chocolate chip cookie recipe, not necessarily a gluten free recipe..So when making these cookies I didn't use any gluten free ingredients, just the ordinary ingredients,and these cookies turned out wonderfully. They looked just like the cookies in the picture and the kids love them. Soft and moist..Thanks for the great recipe..

This recipe was great. I can have eggs, so I used one extra large egg instead of the egg replacement, and part gluten free pantry baking mix, part millet flour. I also used organic non-hydrogenated shortening in place of the butter, which I feel makes a much better cookie than butter.

These were really, really good.  I only added a 1/2 cup of sugar (I didn't have any brown sugar on hand), left the salt out and used 2 eggs i/o egg substitute.  They were still yummy and sweet.  I will absolutely make these again, and I'm going to try molasses too.  I'm recommending this to all my gluten free friends!

These are wonderful!!  I replaced the butter with butter flavored Crisco, and used 3/4 of a bag of chocolate chips.  These taste so much like "real" cookies, my husband asked me if they were really gluten free.  Thanks so much.  One more day of happily being gluten free.

These are fantastic. I wanted something that was similar to Bob's Red Mill GF cookie mix (but cheaper), and this recipe is very similar- only better! I may use less chocolate chips next time, as I had a hard time incorporating all of them. After I had used up all the dough there were still quite a few in the bottom of the mixing bowl. Fantastic recipe. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Modifications: 1/2 butter, 1/2 trex (the closest thing to Crisco I've found in the UK), 2 eggs, used gf bread mix with xantham gum (not sure if that made a difference), and lots of M&Ms.  I also made big cookies, approx. 3-4" after baking, undercooked them slightly, and left  them on the pan a few minutes longer.  These have stayed soft under a cake dome for 2 days so far, and aside from the slightly gritty aftertaste from GF flour (I'm a new gf baker, any suggestions welcomed gratefully), these were super.  I think the dough will become a staple all-purpose one--next time I'm thinking nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and white chocolate!

The BEST Gluten free, vegan cookie!  My two sons are allergic to everything and I have been struggling to find a cookie to give me my fix (baby is nursing and I can't eat anything he is allergic to). Like many others, I increased the flour, by 1/4c. I used 2 1/4c of bob red mill baking flour and 1/4c of garbanzo and flava flour. I used ener-g egg replacer, earths balance, for butter, and added a rounded tsp of xanthum gum. These cookies are DELICIOUS!!!!  And after my changes, they came out just as pictured??

The first time I made these the only change i made was I used real eggs and they came out pretty too flat. The taste was very good though. 
  
I don't advise adding 2 cups more of the  baking mix that one reviewer said. I added 1 extra cup the second time and they turned out too fluffy. I don't care for cakie cookies so i was disappointed. I used 2 eggs instead of the substitute and used dark chocolate chips because my husband is lactose intolerant. Next time I will us 1.5 eggs and the said amount of baking mix.

Used bobs red mill gluten free baking flour, 1 egg, 1/2 cup of each sugar. Plenty sweet. Cookies do spread out so add more flour if you want denser cookies. These came out sweet and crunchy!

I followed the recipe as written except I used the brown sugar with Splenda product rather than straight brown sugar, used a real egg, dark chocolate chunks and added chopped walnuts.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, the cookies were very flat and fell apart when attempting to transfer them from the cookie sheet to the cooling rack.  They were very gritty.  So much so that I couldn't eat them.  I would give the recipe one star except that my fiance and kids liked them.  I will try making the changes suggested by other reviewers (omitting the white sugar and adding more GF baking mix) and will adjust my review then if they turn out better.

These are great chocolate chip cookies and the first that I've made that didn't get flat and runny.  I took advice of others: decreas brown sugar by 1/4 cup, increase flour by 1/4 cup, used 2 eggs (no egg allergies).  Mine cooked for 12 minutes, they were crunchy outside and chewy inside - perfect.  I kept the dough in the fridge while the others cooked so the dough wouldn't get soft/runny.  Cooked on parchment and no issues with sticking. My daughter tasted one right out of the oven and asked for more.  This is a keeper.

This is a good and chewy choc chip cookie.  One tsp of salt was way too much. Salt dominated the taste so much I added 1/4 c oat flout to counteract.  Keeper recipe but I will probably skip the salt altogether. Texture often is an issue with GF recipes. Not so with this one. Very good.

I took some liberties with this one due to laziness of not wanting to go to the store at night to get the proper ingredients. I was out of butter so I used a 6oz + 2tbp of plain greek yogurt, 2tbp of canola oil, 2 cups of Arrowhead Mills GF baking mix, 1/4 cup of oats, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and half a bar of dark chocolate that I chopped into pieces and 1/2tsp xanthan gum. I was surprised at how great they turned out; moist in the center and crusty on the outside. They do not spread much so I flipped them halfway and flattened with egg lifter.

This was hit and miss. I made it with more flour as many suggested, and it never spread out. After adding more butter and sugar, they were falling apart. Then I had to play with the baking time, making it 10 minutes, and reducing the cookie size and shaping it on the pan to be round and flat on top so it would hold together.

I like this recipe- though I prefer recipes that use all scratch as opposed to mixes as part of its ingredient list.  I think it needs more sugar- the dough is not sweet enough for my taste.  Overall- yummy!

I made these for my husband who is allergic to gluten.  He thought they tasted pretty good.  I thought they tasted good for being gluten-free.  My kids even ate them which is a true test to any recipe.

Wow! These were so good I couldn't stop eating them. I used Bob's Red Mill GF All Purpose Baking Flour, plus added 1/2 tsp xanthan gum (per directions on Bob's baking mix). I also used Earth Balance soy free margarine b/c my toddler can't have soy. I thought the batter was a little thick at first too, but I just used my hands to shape it into balls and baked it as 2 Tbsp balls. Did I mention they are light & fluffy?!

These were our very first gluten free cookies. Easy to make, just the right amount of sweetness. I used Smart Balance instead of butter. In just five minutes of a 375 degree oven, the edges were very brown but the rest of the cookie was just beige and not the light brown they were supposed to be.  I ended up leaving them in for only six minutes because I was afraid they might burn.  These were okay, not great, but with some practice on my part (in terms of oven heat, playing around with ingredients, etc.) they might rate a 4.

Best gluten free chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found. I used Arrowhead Mills gluten free all purpose baking mix which made for a less grainy cookie than previous recipes I've made with gluten free all purpose flour.  The only changes I made were reduce brown sugar by 1/4 cup and used 1 egg plus enough egg white substitute to equal 1/4 cup because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.

My first try @ gluten free I used Coconut oil instead of butter.  Also used raw sugar.  The batter was pretty dry so I added almond milk & a little more egg.  Pretty good....not Famous Amos...but beats having none at all.

these were good, i even eat them frozen, straight from the freezer. under cooking always helps for softer cookies so i recommend checking them before the timer goes off. i used regular eggs but i dont think that would really effect the recipe too much.

These cookies are the best gluten-free cookies I've ever tasted. We cannot keep them in our house for longer than 2 days! We use a real egg instead of a substitute. And my GF flour mix is equal parts of: sorgum flour, tapioca flour, sweet white rice flour, corn starch, and coconut flour.

I'll be honest, i'm new to the GF thing and so I didn't have all the different flours on hand. I did find gluten free baking flour store and thought I'd give it a go. My kids and I licked the beaters (obviously, one cannot bake cookies and not eat several spoonfuls worth of dough. For quality control) and I'll be honest, I was a little worried at the odd aftertaste. But I threw them in the oven and barely waited for them to cool before diving in. You really could not tell they are gluten free! I can't wait to trick my father in law into eating one tonight!
I have no problem with eggs so I used one instead of the substitute. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the brown sugar to one cup and I think it's perfect. I didn't even have to add extra flour to thicken the dough!

Once again I made a batch of gluten free and a batch of standard toll house cookies and everyone liked the gluten free better. Same thing happened when I made zucchini bread. I'm thinking of doing all baking gluten free. Great recipe! I did make 1 ounce cookies and smashed them down a little on the cookie sheet so they came out thin and chewy, a little crispy on the edges. Kinda looks like cookie brittle.

I used 1 egg and 1/2 C corn starch, 1/2 C brown rice flour, 1 1/4 C white rice flour, and 3/4 tsp. xantham gum for the baking mix. Dropped by 1/2 Tablespoonfuls onto baking sheet, but they hadn't spread 6 min. in, so I flattened with a fork. Flavor was WONDERFUL, but they were dry and a bit crumbly, so I'll adjust it more in the future - probably an extra egg (most recipes this size have 2 anyway) and a dash of milk, or use the 40% whole grain flour : 60% white flours/starches I've read about (so 1 C brown rice flour, 1 1/4 C some ratio of white rice flour and corn starch). Two children and I who can all tolerate gluten fine, along with the one who can't, all thought they tasted great!

I have tried TONS of different CC cookie recipies and these are definitely far and away the best.  I did modify it by using Earth Balance.  I also used Bob's Red Mill all purpose GF baking flour.  My egg replacer is 2 tbsp ground flax seed soaked in 3 tbsp of water.  It is also possible to find vegan Chocolate Chips, but I indulged and used chips from Ghiardelli.  Cooking times were on the longer end, but I watched closely.  I think the reason these are so good is there is a lot more chips, butter, sugar, and salt in these than typical recipes.

After reading others reviews, I adjusted the recipe by using gluten free flour instead of the mix and increasing the flour by 1/2 cup.  I also increased the butter to 2 sticks and added 3 grated Hershey's bars along with nuts and chocolate chips. I baked for 9 mins, alternating racks in the oven at 5 mins. The result was awesome and looked just like the picture! My family raved over them.  The only reason I reduced the rating is because you can indeed feel the mildly gritty texture of the gluten free flour. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

These are INCREDIBLE!  I am not gluten free dieting, and I like them as much as my hubby does.  I didn't have the premade GF baking mix (I'll get some next time I'm at Whole Foods), so I used 2 parts brown rice flour, 1 part almond meal and 1/2 part cornstarch.  We don't have problems with eggs, so I used 1 egg.  They're awesome.

Had to make my own GF baking mix, but due to rice allergy I had to substitute millet flour for rice flour.  Otherwise I exactly followed the recipe.  The cookies came out absolutely awful.  They tasted good, but they were crumbly to say the least.  Not only did the cookies not rise, they fell in.  Basically it looked like a pan covered in pools of dough with chocolate chips stuck on them.  I guess maybe it would have worked if you actually had the GF baking mix, but for any substitutions, this recipe is awful.

This was my first shot at making gluten free cookies.  Full disclosure,  I added a few challenges by making the dough at home and baking the cookies in a propane oven at 8000 feet.  Having said that, I followed the other reviews and used 4 cups of the GF flour, cut the salt in half and used 2 real eggs.  Meh.  I personally enjoy a thinner cookie, and these turn out awfully thick.  I also enjoy all things salty, so I don't think the salt would have been offensive to me.  I added chopped walnuts, which was a good little crunch.  Not sure I will make them again.

I'm new to gluten free baking so I was unsure what "baking mix" was. I used all white rice flour.  They were very dry and crumbly so I baked them for a couple minutes as balls and then pushed them down with a spoon. I think this recipe has way too much salt.  I would only use 1/2 tsp next time. I also used a real egg. I might play with the ingredients a bit more.

This was my first try at GF chocolate chip cookies.  These are WAY too salty.  Next time I'll used unsalted butter or cut the salt in half and go from there.  They do spread out and if you don't let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transfer to the cooling rack (per the recipe).  If you don't let them sit they will definitely fall apart.  You can't treat these the same as a regular chocolate chip cookie recipe.  They're a little gritty, but they're a LOT better than I thought they would be.  I would have rated 5 stars, but they're just way too salty.  I used Arrowhead Mills Pancake & Baking Mix and used 1 large egg instead of the substitute.

This is a great recipe.  I have been having a lot of trouble this year finding good GF recipes.  They usually call for about three different kinds of flour as well as xanthan gum, which are all things that are not readily available in my area.  This recipe was simple and easy.  I only gave it a four because the cookies turn out very crunchy, and I am a fan of soft, chewy cookies.  Still, my husband took these to work, and nobody noticed that they were GF . . . score!

Over all the texture of the cookies were good, however they had a strong chalky taste. I used a pre done all purpose gf flour mix and I think thats what went wrong. I will have to try these again with one of the mixes that some other people have suggested.

I absolutely love these cookies! I have been trying to make a good gluten free, egg free cookie and before now, haven't been successful. I live at high altitude and these are perfect!! No running, they don't fall apart, and they taste just like regular chocolate chip cookies (which I can eat but my husband can't). Thanks so much for this recipe, it will be a staple in our household. :)

I haven't tried to make these yet and perhaps I should wait until I do..planning to make them for a couple friends that have gluten allergies..but I do know that if you soften butter too much that even a "normal" cookie recipe can flatten out like some of you are describing so I would soften the butter only just enough to be able to cream it into the sugar, egg/substitute and vanilla then add the dry ingredients...hope that solves it because here I'm off to give them a try...they just look too good!

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe. It's going to be the first time I use an egg substitute and hopefully, the outcome will be positive. It's great that more and more people are cooking gluten-free for so many reasons.

This is my first day of gluten free living so I am probably not doing everything right but thought I would share a couple of changes that I will make the next time.  The baking mix that I used was rice flour based & for some reason they did not spread out while baking.  As the first tray came out quite round I shaped subsequent batches flatter.  Will reduce the salt.  The batter was quite stiff & I had a hard time stirring in the large sized chips.  Will use mini chips the next batch and add a T of milk if necessary.

Even though I made a goof and added too much extra flour mixture, I'm giving a 5 star rating. I also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I  salvaged my dry cookie dough by pressing them flat with a glass dipped in water ( a little trick I learned from my mother a long-time Baker). I  baked the flattened cookies at 350 for 10 minutes. the result was a soft baked cookie that goes well with a cup of coffee or a glass of coconut milk.
next time I will be adding extra flour a little at a time as I should have known to do to begin with. 
these cookies have great flavor and great versatility for those who have a gluten-free, dairy free diet. 
This made a big batch of cookies that I shared with the office. Even after confessing my mistake everyone agreed they were still a yummy cookie. and were especially surprised when I told them they were gluten and dairy free.

Mmmmm. For my first gluten free recipe it was great. Used an egg and used an all purpose gluten free flour mix. Plus the xanthan gum.

dough  was  too thin- i added about 1/4 cup more flour. I also used 1/2 C butter, 1/4 c shortening, and  1/8 cup cashew butter. I also substituted coconut sugar for some of the brown sugar, and did use an egg.  THEY ARE SOOOO good- it's a shame they are for my boss......

Really good cookies. I wouldn’t say these taste exactly like regular cookies . However they are good.  I followed other comments and cut the salt in half, added about 1/2 cup more gluten free baking mix, and 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.

I made these cookies today exactly as listed in the recipe except :I used Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour (has xanthan gum in it already).I used one large egg plus an egg white instead of egg replacement.*Press the dough on the cookie sheet rather than leaving a mound of dough. If you press them, they spread perfectly !Nice and crisp around the edges and chewy inside. I added a photo! I’ll make these again for sure!

Made 1 1/2 times the recipe.
Followed advice re: adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour (before “doubling”) & using some potato starch in place of some of the flour & decreasing the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.
Used 1 regular egg + 1/8 cup sweet potato purée (since i made 1 1/2 batches...needed another “1/2 egg” or 1/8 cup of a substitute).
I also used 2/3 butter & 1/3 margarine to reduce spreading.
Used Pamela’s gluten-free All-Putpose Flour.
Baked for 10 minutes, flipping the trays at 5 minutes.
These are fabulous!
They held their shape really well. I prefer a more toothsome cookie - i think that subbing ground oatmeal & adding chopped pecans or walnuts would accomplish this.
Otherwise...making notes because I will definitely wanna make these AGAIN!

Wow. I was very skeptical that this would be as good as everyone said it was, but you really can't tell it is egg free and gluten free! The cookies were soft and delicious. I was a tad off with my egg substitute (soaked flaxseed-- the mixture was wetter than I meant it to be) so these were a bit softer than I planned, but these taste phenomenal. I am so happy to have found this recipe.

Great recipe! I made this 2 times, and found that using half gluten-free flour, half ground oats makes big difference in the texture. When I made it only with gluten free all-purpose flour, the cookies were quite hard, whereas with the oats they were a lot softer and more moist. Used a real egg both times and it turned out great.

I made these cookies at high altitude (~6000 ft). I made the following changes to the recipe after reading reviews. I increased the GF flour to 3+ cups, decreased sugar to 3/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C white sugar, used 2 eggs, cut salt back to 1/4 t. I used 1 C choc chips and 1 C butterscotch chips and about 3/4  C chopped walnuts. Very yummy! Just a little bit dry. I think next time I will try just increasing the flour amount by 1/2 C of what is called for in recipe. Made nearly 5 dozen cookies.

We loved these cookies! Substituted margarine (dairy-free) for the butter, used an egg, and 2 cups of fine rice flour & 1/4 cup of cornstarch -( the reviews were very helpful!) We also used Enjoy Life chocolate chips (dairy & gluten free). These cookies came out terrific! They are perfect for my dairy allergic child and my gluten intolerance. Thank you!

I loved them! I used a real egg instead of egg replacement, and I used brown rice flour and tapioca flour for the baking mix. I baked them for about 15 minutes before they were completely done in the middle. They were a little crumbly, but they were crispy and delicious!

These are amazing tasting!  I used a real egg and I upped the baking powder to 1 1/2 t. They barely spread at all. And puffed up with cracked tops. Gorgeous and yummy!

These were great cookies.  I deleted the sugars and added 1 cup agave.  I substituted coconut oil for the butter. I put in dairy free chocolate chips instead of regular chips.  I used Bella gluten free all purpose flour.  Delicious!!!!!

I used robin hood gf flour with 3/4tsp xanthan gum, two small eggs and some toasted pecan pieces.  I omitted the salt because my butter was salted.  Awesome recipe.

I thought it would turn out on its own but when making these cookies add more flour mix otherwise you will have cookies that grow too fast and then they r not cookies anymore

Hands down the BEST GF cookie I have ever had. I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose GF Baking Flour and one egg instead of the egg substitute. Literally couldn't even tell they were GF.

This recipe is the best ever! I love to substitute almond extract and coconut for the vanilla and chocolate chips! Flax seed or crushed pear(oddly enough) is a great substitute for eggs!

Delicious chocolate chip cookie recipe! I made these even healthier for my family by using soy free earth balance butter and dairy free chocolate chips (enjoy life) I did reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp based on other reviews also.  I also added 1/4 cup applesauce to ingredients based on one of the reviews to add moisture.  They did not flatten out like most of my other regular cookies and were actually the best looking cookies I've ever made :) These are simply the best cookies and a huge bonus to know that they are gluten/soy/dairy/egg free.

Almost inedible as written. The dough had a very metallic taste when I put it together as the recipe indicated. So...I went to work to "fix" it. I added a cup of peanut butter, one cup of rolled oats and an additional half cup of brown sugar in an attempt to mask the taste of metal. It worked. They turned out fluffy, sweet and rich and not at all flat as other reviewers wrote. In fact, on the second batch that went into the oven, I flattened the dough a little with the back of a spoon before baking. Next time, I will cut the salt in half and add the same ingredients I added this time. I might also add crushed corn flakes to mimic a recipe my mom made often when I was a child.

This was a great recipe, kinda salty tho. I used one jumbo egg insted of egg substitute, 1 1/4c all purpose almond baking flour mix and 1c sweet rice flour, and added 3/4tbsp xanthan gum. They turned out a bit soft after 8 min, but super tasty.
