My wife and I had the opportunity to dine at a Moroccan restaurant in Philly as part of a birthday celebration.  I'll admit to experiencing some concern as I am not an intrepid foodie- I like what I like and am not usually open to trying new things.  I'm glad I tried this time though because it was really delicious.  So I came to A/R looking to see if I could find anything that would be comparable and came across this recipe.  It was really quite good!  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used red wine instead, and chicken stock instead of veggie stock; other than that, I kept to the recipe.  Another keeper, thank you!

I admit, I don't know what Moroccan Stew is supposed to taste like, but if this is it, I like Moroccan Stew!   I followed the recipe as written except that I used ground thyme instead of dried.   I was really quite nervous about the recipe towards the end.   When I added the red pepper flakes, it got spicy fast and I thought it was maybe too much for us.   Then the vinegar I was very nervous about.   I added the first tablespoon, stirred and sampled, and it had no sour taste and had mellowed the spice of the red pepper flakes.   I added the second and a bit of bitterness showed up, but definitely not too much.   The perfect amount I would say.   Kudos to a great recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  I got rave rave reviews.  It was so flavorful and filling.  I added a chopped sweet potato and diced carrots.  I highly recommend that everyone try it.

We really like this recipe. Great job Vicki!  I don’t think it makes a lot enough for a family of 4-6 depending on sides. I added a tsp of turmeric. I’ll definitely make this again!

Sorry to be negative but we did not like this.  I followed the recipe exactly except to use a chopped white onion instead of the pearl onions (didn't have any).  It was very spicy but otherwise it was blah.  Hubby said it was edible but he wouldn't care if I never made it again.

This was delicious. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and used a yellow pepper and a locally grown species of red pepper instead of a green pepper. I used chopped fresh thyme, not dried, and added some chopped fresh parsley. My only regret was I did not invite the neighbors, we had plenty and it would have been a great dish to share.
