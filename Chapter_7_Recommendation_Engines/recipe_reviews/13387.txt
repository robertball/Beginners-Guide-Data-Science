It turned out awesome---my brother & I boiled up some Bisquik dumplings on top of it for an excellent meal.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was delicious, a real keeper. I made it exactly as written. I think the person who gave this recipe 1 star may have used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk, because this is not a sweet soup as written. They are 2 very different products.

Excellent! Simple to make, and endlessly customizable. I recommend serving it with some crusty rye bread for dipping, and shake some hot paprika over the top.

I really am not a big fan of kraut but I still liked this soup.  My husband ate 4 bowls.  I didn't have any boullion so I used canned chicken broth.  I am adding this to New Years Day dinner along with the other traditional kraut dishes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Even though I cheated and used frozen meatballs due to the lack of time, it was still AWESOME!  Will have it again for sure!

Made this recipe on Saturday for a progressive dinner that our art gallery was involved in. Got great reviews and requests for the recipe. Ate someof what was leftover on Sunday and it was even better. Had thoughts of usiing kiebasa instead of meatballs next tio\me I make it. Has become my favorite soup. Yum!!!

I really really didn't like this soup. I was really disappointed to because I am a fan of sauerkraut and meatballs and thought I would love it. I couldn't even eat it. My family thought it was ok but said they definitely wouldn't want it again. There was something about the combination of the sweet cream taste and the sauerkraut that I felt didn't work.

Really very good!  I was looking for ideas using ground venison instead of beef and this sounded perfect.  I also used turnip kraut instead of the regular (sounds strange but delicious) and the soup turned out wonderful!  It's always nice to find recipes that don't call for Cream of Soup!  The meatballs could have used a little spice though...may add some black pepper to them next time.

My husband and our neighbor's really enjoy sauerkraut however this was a bit overwhelming and apparently a little harsh on the GI Tract for all involved...  Unique, and maybe not as the main course would have been alright...?  for the three who we served, the recipe could have been halved, plenty of leftovers (for 3)...still in freezer...
I appreciate your sharing and we will continue to try new and unique dishes.

I'm visual and I like pictures in my recipe books but the ingredients made this soup sound pretty interesting; I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad that I did!  I halved the recipe and the only thing I did differently was to bake my meatballs and add dumplings from a recipe on this site.  This soup is warm and inviting and definitely a comfort food during the chilly winter months. Thanks Auntylene for posting this recipe :-)

This was okay. It was an interesting change of pace. I did add dumplings like suggested in a previous post and thought they were quite good w/ it. The problems I found is-1)It makes a LARGE pot of soup. The original recipe says it will serve 8, but really it's more like 16. If I were to make it again, I'd cut the recipe in half. 2)Unless your kids REALLY like sauerkraut, they won't like this. The flavor is quite strong.

Due to time constraints and not having a few ingredients on hand, I had to make changes. The flavor of this was really, really good. But I did not make the ground beef into meatballs. Instead I just browned it into crumbles, added a diced onion, and followed the general plan for the soup part. I did add some frozen mixed vegetables at the end to round out the dish. I loved the strong sauerkraut flavor but it was a little too much for my children. Anyway, I will make this again but will probably skip the extra steps of making meatballs and just keep it as a ground meat in the soup instead.

I tried this soup for the very first time yesterday and I will say I was a bit worried that it wouldn't taste good.  Boy was I happy to find out I would have been totally wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted to discover an extremely tasty soup that had complex flavors.  I think next time I will add other veggies to this soup to make it a bit heartier but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you to the person that wrote this recipe.  Its AMAZING!!!!

very good soup! Although the meatballs are very bland, I think next time I make I will put caraway seeds in them.  As for the soup I added kielbasa, gnocchi noodles and added some caraway seeds to give it a twist. Next time I will not add the caraway seeds to the soup itself I  will just add it to the meatballs.

This was very good. Be prepared to add a lot of the liquid to the flour or it will clump up. If you like sauerkraut you’ll love this.

Very good! I even used fat-free evaporated milk because it was all I had. I thought it might be too watery, but it was still very tasty!

This was very good and unusual, I think I will try it again and add some diced carrot. I also think it might be good with a little shredded Swiss cheese on top.

This was really good, kids really enjoyed it.  Don't be put off by the name!  We even discovered that the meatball recipe smelled kind of like Krystal hamburgers.  The kids want to try making a burger with that portion of the recipe and see if we can make a healthier home made version of the burgers.

I cheated & used frozen meatballs, as I already had them on hand.  Otherwise, I followed this recipe to the tee.  I love sauerkraut & I love meatballs, so the combination in this soup was heaven to my taste buds!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'll be making it again ... but will probably cut the recipe in half as this made a HUGE batch of soup, it definitely serves more than 8.

Thought it might be fun to try something unusual so fixed this recipe.  Followed the recipe to the letter and hated it...tried to add a few thing to make it 'better'..no luck.  Maybe you'll like it..We sure didn't!

A very interesting soup.  I made this and put several containers in the freezer.  We liked it better each time we had it(kind of grew on us) but I don't think I would make it again.
