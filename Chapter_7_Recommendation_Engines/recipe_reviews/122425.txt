Out of this world.  Everyone at Christmas raved about it. I did take the advice of others and I omitted all of the white sugar in the mashed sweet potato and they were still plenty sweet with the topping. Will make every year.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  I did cut way back on the sugar (1/4 cup) and also only used 1/2 tsp salt.  This is the best casserole recipe I have ever had.  I will definitely be making this again and AGAIN!!!

Great recipe, however I used 5 large sweet potatoes instead of the 3 cups that it called for, and cut the sugar in half, I think next time I will cut it out completely, as the sweet potatoes are sweet enough themselves. Loved the topping, and would double that part.  Loved the texture and consistency of the dish.

Everyone loved this recipe at Thanksgiving! I left out the white sugar all together and it was plenty sweet. This is a new tradition on our table!

My whole family loved this recipe at Thanksgiving.  I also used rolled oats instead of pecans and it made a great topping.

I made this last night for a dinner party.  I did a double batch and follwed the suggestions of others to put half the sugar and a little less egg.   So I did 5 eggs instead of 6.  Everything came out wonderful and my husband gave me that look... that look like omg! this is delicious! lol  Only thing I would do next time is add some mini marshmallows to the top.

My daughter couldn't get enough of this and has asked for it for her birthday.  I only used 1/4 cup white sugar as suggested by the other reviewers.  I'll probably omit it completely next time.  I doubled the topping and layered half sweet potato mixture, half topping, then repeated it.  Definitely sweet, definitely good!!!

It gets ***** for the dessert-ability of it--it's very sweet.  I cut the sugar by half and it was still sweet.  BUT the consistancy was pure joy.  My husband said it reminded him of custard and it does!  For the topping, I only sprinkled on the brown sugar and it turned nice and crunchy.  Next time, less or no sugar, and it'll be a dessert item that'll go over big!

Made this recipe and it is now our family favorite!  I have had to share it with my sisters and niece already, as well as some friends!  The only twist I gave it was some pumpkin pie spice, but you can leave it out if you like!  It is great EITHER way!

DOUBLE THUMBS UP!

We love this recipe.  I added half the sugar though! It'd be too sweet with a full cup.

This was my 2nd time making this dish for the holidays and as always it was a total hit! Kids and family alike loved it. I tweaked it a bit this year for my personal taste:

*Used more sweet potatoes than called for
*Based on other reviews cut sugar in 1/2
*Used brown sugar instead of white for the casserole
*Added nutmeg to taste in casserole
*Topping needed a tblsp more butter cut in
*Added cinnamon to taste to topping

Super easy to make, and versatile to play around with seasonings! Thinking I make try maple syrup instead of brown sugar next year, and possibly rolled oats instead of pecans.

Very good. I used non-fat milk and reading other reviews, 1/3 cup of Splenda instead of 1 cup sugar. All else the same. Made for church dinner and had positive comments. I will do again.

Took advice and didn't put any sugar in. Also doubled the topping and added small amount of oats to topping. It was as good as all the reviews stated! Whole party loved it. I'm making it again next Thanksgiving for sure!

These were really great! Made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them!  I did cut the white sugar in half based upon other reviews.  Not knowing how many sweet potatoes would equal 3 cups I mashed 4 potatoes and got 6 cups so I doubled the recipe, except the sugar, and added 5 eggs rather than 6. Other than that I stuck to it and it was great.  I did finely chop the pecans but next time I would leave them larger as they were really tasty in this recipe! Thank you it will be a repeat every year for the holidays!

This recipe beats all those marshmallow concoctions hands down.  I've made this several times and there's hardly ever any left.  If there is any left, it's fabulous for breakfast the next morning.

so good, it's sweet but you can still taste the potatoes.  Also very easy, it did take a while for the potatoes to cool.

Made a double recipe of this (16 servings) for Thanksgiving today in 9x13 pan, and there were no leftovers! I used 2 large cans of yams, so a little more than 6 cups. Upon reading the reviews, I was weary of putting in that much sugar, but I still put in 1 cup brown sugar, and about 1/4 cup white sugar, which it probably didn't need. I didn't want that much butter either, so I used 1/4 cup butter, and a little more than a 1/4 cup of apple butter. I also put in 2 cups of pecans into the topping. Perfect!

I"m not a sweet potato fan, but I had family over Easter 2010 and need something differen't from the usual Mashed Potatoes.  My family is extremely pick, so I was terrified about how this recipe would turn out.  I have family members that usually don't have anything nice to say.  This recipe is AMAZING.  I didn't try it myself until I overheard my great uncle whispering to his wife asking what this dish was and how delicious it was.  I scooped a small amount into my plate and had to scoop more.    He took it home, and later told family members who couldn't make it that my Sweet Potato Casserole was excellent.  This Casserole tastes even better the next day....

Made this last night alongside Christmas dinner. Got wonderful reviews. A nice light, fluffy addition to the menu. I had prebaked 4 large sweet potatoes until extremely soft. I cut back on the white sugar to 3/4 cup; next time, I will cut back even more, maybe to 1/4 cup, or cut it out entirely. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my office's Thanksgiving Potluck. It was my 1st time ever sweet potatoes. The prep time doesn't include preparing the potatoes, it took awhile. However, this turned out really well. I did add cinnamon and brown sugar and way more vanilla than it called for into the the potatoes themselves. The idea is good...just needed a little more flavor. I also topped the bake all the way across. I will make this again.

This is by far the most used recipe I have. It is delicious. I usually just use the ingredients for how ever many sweet potatoes I have; sometimes I have three, some times I have six. Whatever it takes, it is yummy -- the topping is the best. OMG We LOVE IT!

I made this tongiht for my in-laws. Everyone really liked it. I left out all of the white sugar. It was very well liked. However, I will probably add some (1/4 cup) of sugar next time to see how that goes. I definitely recommend this dish!

Everyone loved these sweet potatoes when I brought them for Thanksgiving.  The brown sugar crust wasn't too sweet, which is what I was afraid of.  Very good!

I made this for Christmas dinner - I actually prepared the whole dish yesterday and refigerated until about 4 pm today.  FAB!  Everyone loved it, and it was all gone!  I did follow previous comments and omitted the sugar - and I am glad I did - everyone raved at the flavor and the texture.  Great recipe! Thanks!

5 stars! Delicious. Sweet? Yes. But it's supposed to be.  I doubled it with 2 minor changes: 1/2 the sugar and oats instead of pecans in the topping. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it came out perfectly. No leftovers - it was a huge hit. I didn't find it too sweet with 1/2 the sugar (1 cup for double batch). I think you are either going for a savory dish, or a sweet dish. This one is sweet, so go with it. You don't need as much sugar as suggested, but I wouldn't cut it out completely. I will definitely make it again!!

I used a large can of cooked yams and added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and decreased the added sugar by 1/2.  It was a hit!

I think the "Mom's Sweet Potato Bake" is absolutely delicious! It's worth the time to make. I made it over Thanksgiving and since then I have made it just for desert without any special holiday event going on. It's great!

AWESOME! This recipe is wonderful and the finished product is delicious!!!! My husband, who is a very picky eater, LOVED it! He told me several times that he loved the sweet potatoes. This one is a keeper for sure. It is difficult to know how many potatoes are going to make the three cups mashed. I used two average size sweet potatoes, and I had just about two cups mashed. It seems to be just trial and error as far as the measurements go. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

Very yummy, got 5 stars from all of my guests!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and only used ~1/4 cup of white sugar, and added a little bit extra vanilla.  I also only used 2 eggs, since that was all I had on-hand, and it seemed to work fine.  I'm not a huge fan of nuts, so I substituted oats for the pecans and it worked out nicely.  Definitely a great recipe!

These were the BEST sweet potatoes we've ever had!!  I doubled the mashed sweet potatoes (who's family eats only 3 cups?!?!?  Not mine!!!), but left the rest of the recipe the same.  They are now a staple at holidays and easy enough to make during the week!!

This is the best recipe for sweet potatoes my family has ever eaten. However we are still wondering if it is for dinner or a desert. I wanted to put it in a pie crust to see how that would taste.  I did cut way back on the sugar as all the other people who tried this recipe has suggested. It was YUMMY!!!

I made this last night for company.  Everyone loved it.  I used 1/3 c. sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar in the potato mixture instead of the 1 c. of sugar and about 1 Tbs. of cinnamon.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the topping. This recipe is a keeper.

Loved this recipe! Very easy and tasty. Only changes I made were to cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, almonds instead of pecans and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice.

We liked this okay, but it's much too sweet.  My later version had 1/4 cup of maple syrup and no white sugar.  I also used egg substitute in place of some of the egg, and omitted the topping because we happened to have apple crisp with this meal, and that had a similar topping.  We didn't miss it on the sweet potato dish, but it's very good that way, too.

I use the canned sweet potatoes.  I add no sugar to the main portion -- only to the crumb mixture.  I also double the flour, nuts and butter for the crumb mixture but keep the brown sugar the same.  Otherwise, it's too sweet.  I also use a gluten-free all-purpose flour for my mom.

This dish was excellent and will be served every Thanksgiving to come. Even people who didn't like sweet potatoes raved over it!

I have made it for several years now and it is always extremely popular. I received many compliments this year at my extended family get together.

This year I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup of honey, added cinnamon and nutmeg and divided it into two layers of potato mix and topping.

Fabulous dish and so easy! This was a nice change for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was quite similar to Goodwood BBQ's sweet potato side dish that is so delicious. I used more sweet potatoes but otherwise followed the original recipe. The dish received lots of compliments!

Very, very good but very sweet.  I think next time I will try to cut down on the sugar.

This has become a family favorite!  I do adjust it a bit and it has worked to everyone's delight.  I eliminate the white sugar and add a bit of maple syrup.  The topping is crunched up with added flavor by including coconut flakes and rolled oats to the pecans.  It has been a huge hit.

If there were more than 5 stars, I would give them.  This dish was outstanding!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar instead of 1 cup white, and I used oats for the topping instead of pecans.  Wonderful!

I made this for my first time hosting Thanksgiving, and everyone LOVED it! I double the recipe for a bigger group and took a few suggestions from other reviews, I added very little sugar and only 5 eggs (instead of 6 as doubling would suggest). It was delish! Everyone asked me for the recipe and I am now in charge of the sweet potatoes for every Thanksgiving and Christmas for now on. Great Recipe! Thank you so much!

It was good... just ended up tasting a little too egg-y.  Next time I'll reduce the eggs to 1.  The topping was delicious!

This was the best.  I'll make this every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My kids normally don't eat this dish, they loved it.  I made a little more of the topping.  That's the only thing I increased.

I was assigned sweet potatoe's for Turkey day this year. And as always I go to my favorite recipe website.....AR. Found this one and let me just tell you that it was the most talked about dish at dinner. My adult neice who doesnt eat anything healthy tried a little bit of this and had 3rds and 4ths. She LOVE LOVE LOVED it. So did the rest of my family. I had to leave the recipe with everybody. I did add some mini marshmellows before and after the topping. Thanks a million Sandra for sharing your mom's recipe. We will be using it forever and ever. Amen.

putting on the pecans made it even better and the brown sugar gave it that sweetness and the sweet potatos are so smooth and the pecans gave it crunch this recipe is really great

I followed the advice of other cooks and omitted the sugar from the sweet potatoes and used my hand mixer to mix the ingredients.  I did infuse the milk with spices before using it, but this casserole fell short in flavor, thanks to the butter it had some flavor.  I found the topping too sweet for the potatoes.  If you like dense casseroles do not use the mixer but smash the potatoes by hand. I will add the sugar to the sweet potatoes next time, the topping makes it a necessity, but I will do 1/2 C, I will add spices to it too, at least cinnamon.

We didn't exactly wait for the potatoes to cool before mashing & mixing.  For that reason, the dish came out like a pureed dessert. As other reviews suggested, we omitted most of the white sugar. Even so, it was still EXCELLENT!  The candied pecans on top were TO DIE FOR!  For more decoration, we sprinkled mini marshmallows on top!

Wow, this was really surprising!  We were looking for something new for this Thanksgiving dinner and this dish exceeded our expectations.  This will surely become a holiday dinner staple in our family.  Like many before, we heeded the suggestion to not use the white sugar.  We believe it would have been too sweet if we had added it.  Thanks for the amazing dish!

These were so yummy! I had sweet potatoes that I bought on sale. I got them home and my boyfriend told me he hated sweet potatoes, so I took that as a challenge! I found this recipe, and I knew I had to try it. It came out SO good, but I did make some changes. In addition to the vanilla extract I added one teaspoon of almond extract, one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time I may add some cloves. The extra spices definitely made a nice addition. Instead of pecans I used hazelnuts, which perfectly set off the spices that I added. I did use the recommended amount of sugar, and I don't think they were too sweet. I also cooked them in individual ramekins which cut down on cooking time (to about 30 minutes) and they make for very presentable individual servings! I can't wait to make these for Thanksgiving dinner!

I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes but this recipe is great.  We even enjoy seconds and leftovers.  I did only add 1/2 a cup instead of a whole cup of sugar and it was sweet enough.

These were very good and simple to make.  I only used 1/2 cup of the white sugar and found them plenty sweet.  I did not use the topping.  I will definitely be making these again.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I cut the sugar down to just 1 tablespoons because I like the natural sweetness of the potatoes without adding too much extra sugar and the topping has brown sugar in it.  It was fantastic!  Looks great and is an impressive company dish.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this years ago when I was living with some friends (during my Hurricane Katrina evac).  My friends are not big fans of sweet potatoes, but everyone loved this!  I still make it every year during the holidays and always receive compliments.

STOP LookING!! This is the best, very best sweet potato recipe I have ever found!! Made it exactly as it said and wound up with an empty pan! Made me wish I had made lots more. Definitely a fixture at our holiday table from now on and probably thru out the year as a treat! Tks so much.

Everyone loved this dish.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sweet potatoes.  I cut the sugar in half as some people suggested and it was plenty sweet enough.  To the topping I added coconut which was yummy and doubled the whole topping recipe.  I didn't have pecans so used walnuts.  Will definitely make again, though I'm wondering if I can omit the eggs...will try that next time.

I made this for Christmas and it went over well.  The flavor was excellent, but I thought it seemed a little too wet.  I wonder if maybe it was because I baked it at too low a temperature, while warming the ham.  Will definitely try it again, though.

Delicious... very delicious.  Followed most suggestion to eliminate the sugar as the sweet potatoes are sweet enough on their own.  Doubled the topping and the rest was history.  Yum delicious!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. It was great! Several people said it was the best sweet potato dish they had ever eaten! I also used brown sugar instead of white according to suggestions by other reviewers.

I made this one other time and it was very sweet, so this year I was looking for a recipe and saw this one again and paid more attention to the reviews and suggestions, so I tried it again.  However, in the craziness of getting all food items ready for the holiday, I didn't get this dish ready in time to put in the oven for the full time.  So instead, I quickly prepared it using only 1/4 cup of white sugar and put in the microwave for 10 mins on high.  I then put the topping on it (added some cinnamon to the topping) and put in the oven for about 15 mins while carving the turkey and getting other items to the table.  It was excellent!!  Just the right amount of sweetness with the reduction in sugar.

I found this recipe really easy to follow. Not too many ingredients are required. My family loved it, they couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was. I thought it would be too sweet because of the amount of sugar required but surprisingly enough it was just right. Can't wait to make it again.

My mom hates sweet potatoes and she had double helpings of this!  I used skim milk and Splenda brown sugar to make it a little healthier.  I also added a shot of spiced rum into the mix.  This is the best recipe I've made so far for sweet potatoes.

I made this for my boyfriend's b-day dinner, and he just couldn't get enough!! I'm still hearing rave reviews a day later! However, the first time I made them the topping made them too sweet, so I put a thinner layer on...Perfect!

Not to bad. I did cut down on the sugar like everyone suggested, but after I ate it-I felt that it needed more sugar. I will definitely keep working with this recipe. Thanks!

This is a definite addition to our table, made it for my nieces birthday a couple of months ago and everyone raved about it. I was asked on the spot to make it for Thanksgiving this year! I read some other reviews and they were saying how they omitted the white sugar, I think that is a great idea, this dish was more than sweet enough to be a dessert!    Thank~you for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it "won" best dish of the night!  A few changes:  I used 3 sweet potatoes and 2 yams (so more than 3 cups mashed). In the potatoes, I used about 1/8 c white sugar and 1/8 c brown sugar, plus cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.  Made it again for friends last night and it was a hit!

Very creamy. I, too, omitted the cup of sugar. It's sweet enough without it. Added some oats in with the pecans. Yum! Will make again.

This was truly delicious!!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used one less egg, and only a few tablespoons of sugar.  I didn't have pecans (and don't like them much anyway) so I used oats like some suggested.  It was SUPER yummy, and the sweet potatoes themselves were just as good without the topping.  Lots of compliments on this one, and I'll definitely be making it again!

Big hit amongst my family! Passed the Thanksgiving table test with flying colors. I only did a tablespoon of sugar and it was still plenty sweet from the sweet potatoes and brown sugar.

I made this yesterday for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I guess I'd had more wine than I thought, because I accidentally used powdered sugar in the topping instead of flour.  By the time I discovered my error, it had already been in the oven for 1/2 hour. so I just let it go, and worried the whole time about it being sickening sweet and inedible.  I had purposely picked this recipe because it didn't have marshmallows.  Lucky for me, it was fantastic!  I honestly couldn't really even tell the difference.  Everyone at the table raved about the sweet potato bake.  Perhaps I'll make the same "mistake" every time.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

This is a delicious side dish. It is very sweet, so I do cut the white sugar down. I reduce sigar to about 1/2 cup. This has become "my dish" to bring to Thanksgiving dinner.

I cut the recipe in half and still had plenty for a family of four. Only change I made was cut the sugar in half from the already halved recipe. Even then, it was super sweet. Texture was odd and really just.....greasy. Only one who liked it was the youngest and he almost never likes anything. Think this would be okay, if it wasn't so sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving, it was my 1st time making any sort of sweet potato dish, and it was fantastic.  I added cinnamon, and pumpkin spice and I think it gave it an added punch to the taste.  Everyone loved it

This was absolutely delicious! My husband usually isn't a huge fan of sweet potatoes, and he loved it.   It is pretty sweet. I enjoyed the sweetness. However, if you don't like a lot of sweet cut down on the sugar. I also just mashed 4 large sweet potatoes and used that, I didn't measure to see how many cups it was.   Give this a try. It's worth it. I know I'll make it again.

We thought this was perfect. Just the right taste. I put it in an oblong glass cake pan instead of the casserole dish and baked it just a bit less. Very good.

I used fresh sweet potatoes and didn't add the sugar as many suggested, but I'd say to cut it in half, as it wasn't especially sweet.
Also, for the topping, I just used pecans and brown sugar- it turned out great!

This is a great recipe! I have never been a big fan of the "traditional" marshmellow sweet potato concoction everybody else seems to like. The was really good though, the pecans and brown sugar add the perfect sweetness. I tried it first on Thanksgiving and My teenager just loveds it so we had it again on Christmas and twice sense! This is now a family favorite that will be on every holiday table.

Served this at Christmas and was asked for the recipe.  Even the non-sweet potato eaters were asking for seconds (and thirds).  As others did, I cut down on the sugar.  Add a little honey (1/4) cup to make this sensational!

This was the biggest hit on Thanksgiving night dinner. It got RAVE REVIEWS as the Favorite sweet potatoe dish they ever had!! The only think different I did was to double the nuts on top. But I think it would have been an winner anyways!

Great recipe.Made some changes: left out the white sugar,decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon as others suggested,grated fresh naval orange rind into potatoes with the juice of half the orange, put half cup of chopped pecans in the potatoes for the crunch factor, and  increased the pecans on the topping using only three tablespoons of brown sugar. Excellent! The orange rind and juice gave it a nice zing and it was still plenty sweet. Will try it next time without the white or brown sugar.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was enjoyed by many! Even a very, very picky eater who does not normally like sweet potatoes liked it very much. I did use less sugar than the recipe, called for, however, and still found the bake a bit sweet for my family's taste. I'm making it again as I write this review, and I'm using half the amount of sugar. Great recipe overall, and very easy to make with just a handful of common ingredients.

This Dish was a Huge Hit.  My Gmother in law put the dish up befor everyone was thru lol.   She wanted it all to herself.  I did add double the topping amount and used the remainder of the stick of butter from the potatoe part.

It looked wonderful and tasted very good. I made it for Thanksgiving for a very picky crowd.  The only thing I did not like was the runny consistancy.  I don't think it was supposed to look like baby food. I'll make it again another time and will either add another egg, or add more sweet potatoes.

great, i don't even like sweet potatoes and neither do any of the friends i made this decadent dish for.  I added the pumpkin pie spice as suggested but skipped out on the vanilla.  I also substituted splenda and whole wheat flour for flour and sugar and it was still amazing.

I make it every year and it is the biggest hit of the holidays.  ***Changes- I leave out all the white sugar - not necessary at all!  And I double the topping.  I also add clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  It is divine!!!

My whole family LOVES this recipe!!! It is a staple at all of our holiday meals. I have made with only part of the sugar and with out adding any sugar and no matter what everyone LOVES it!!! I am the one person on the planet that could get a friend to eat sweet potatoes with this recipe. She was not a fan at all until she tried a bite of this!!

This is THE go-to recipe for myself, and now for my family! Such a good turnout every time, and the only thing I change is that I double the topping part!  Truly the best recipe for a nostalgically classic sweet potato casserole! Best. Ever.

We lost everything in a house fire... including long-treasured recipes. This is the exact sweet pototato dish that has become my signature contribution to every event. Thanks so much! (I have always decided on how much sugar to add to the potatoes depending on how sweet they are so modifying sugar amounts is all up to the cook.)

I make this every turkey dinner... Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is always a huge hit and is always one of the first things to go. Literally, everyone in my house fights over this dish. I am just so in love with it. :)

If I am not making a pumpkin pie, sometimes I will throw in a little nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon (a dash or two) just to give it some extra flavour... But it is delicious as is!

Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't care for the texture that the eggs gave it - it seemed more like a custard to me. It had an over-bearing "sugar" taste to it.  It was easy to make, though.

Best sweet potato casserole recipe this side of ... nowhere. It's just the best sweet potato casserole recipe there is. I cut the sugar in half, too -- onaccounta I'm a follower, and everyone else here seems to cut the sugar with some success -- and it's just great. The kid eats it. The husband eats it. It makes my mother-in-law angry. Who could ask for anything more?

My family is usually not a fan of sweet potatoes but even they were asking for the recipe before they left! My dad is a diebetic so I used 1/4 of granulated splenda in th mash mix and then splenda brown sugar in the topping - it was perfect. 5 large sweet potatoes are just right.

I tried this to see if I would want to make it for Thanksgiving dinner.  I added some Allspice, Cinnamon, and Nutmeg to make the flavors more like Pumpkin Pie, since we're all on diets and won't be having pies this year.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used Light Organic Brown Sugar, the new 50% Lowfat Butter, and No Fat Milk. It came out wonderful ... It is very creamy, velvety. I felt like I was cheating!!!  I will definitely make this for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing.

This was a different recipe from what we typically do, but it was a nice change.  I also used oatmeal instead of the peacans in my recipe since we don't use any type of nut in our house.  My topping didn't turn out quite right.  I'll keep this recipe and use it again, I'll just keep playing with it.

Excellent recipe.  Very tasty and sweet.  I took the suggestion of another cook to replace oats for the pecans, as I didn't have any pecans in the house.  And, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup in the mixture.  Otherwise, everything else was the same.  Everyone loved it.

This was good, and I dont even really like sweet potatoes! I think next time I'll make the top layer a base layer as well (or maybe turn it into a pie!). I omitted the sugar in the actual yams as other suggested but maybe mine werent sweet enough because the top was to die for but the middle was just mushy bland stuff -_-, my fault on that though ^^

This is my "secret recipe" that I refuse to share it is that good. I have never received a bad review for this dish and am constantly asked for the recipe. The only changes I make are I double the amount of the sweet potatoes otherwise it is just to sweet and I cover the the top of the entire dish with the streusel topping.

We loved this.  Not sure you could find a better sweet potato recipe.  I used 6-7 potatoes; cut the sugar to 1/2 c.; and used marshmallows for the topping (how our family likes it).  Wonderful consistency.  Smooth and sweet!

I made a "lighter" version of this recipe and it was divine.  The calorie/fat content is the only reason I didn't give if 5 stars.  To make the recipe lighter, I used 2 cups sweet potatoes and 2 cups butternut squash, skim milk, smart balance, 1/4 cup of white splenda, and splenda brown sugar.  Oh, and I used egg beaters instead of the normal eggs.  It cut out a lot of the fat and calorie content and no one even noticed that it wasn't completely sweet potatoes.  A also added a little bit of sugar free maple syrup to the mashed potato part, and a pinch of cinammon.

I've never made sweet potatoes before, but I was asked to bring them to a large family dinner.  I found this recipe, and it was a HUGE hit!  Several people asked for the recipe.  I followed it exactly, and added some quick oats to the topping.

Wonderful. I have made the sweet potato casserole with pineapple and son in law refuses to eat it.  Can't wait to try this one on him.  It was awesome.

I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I'll only make it this way from now on. Everyone loves this dish. I have family that didn't like Sweet Potatoes before this.
However, I did cut back on the sugar. And it was still good.

Really good I omitted the nuts b/c I knew I was sharing this with my two yr. old and he might have balked at them.  I did decrease the sugar by a 1/4 cup b/c to me sweet pots are so sweet to begin with.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup as many suggested, and stirred in a few tablespoons of brown sugar as well as a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Otherwise, didn't change a thing and LOVED this recipe!!  I will definitely make it again!

This tasted divine, but it was a little runny.  Perhaps using heavy cream instead of milk will stiffen it up.  Or maybe just less milk.

It could have used a little more oomph ... but although basic the texture was heavenly and even my husband who "hates sweet potatoes" ate seconds!

I made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving (07) and my family, esp my husband, LOVED it!  I cut the white sugar to a quarter cup like most of the reviewers here and it definitely was still sweet.  Looking forward to making more of this recipe in many years to come!

This recipe was amazing, and was rated the best dish at the Thanksgiving table amongst multiple amazing dishes.  I admit I cut the sugar and only used 1/3 of the sugar in the potatoes (I kept the sugar ratio for the topping), slightly less salt, and 2% milk.  People couldn't get enough!  I thought that the eggs in the dish were strange, but the dish is not eggy in the least.  More than one person at the table asked to have some for dessert instead of pumpkin pie!

I don't think I've ever tasted a better sweet potato recipe than this one!  I'll be making this one for years to come. It was pretty sweet, though, so next time I will probably cut down the sugar to 1/2-2/3 cup. Thanks for the recipe!

I pulled this off Allrecipes.com on Thanksgiving morning.  It is fabulous.  Wonderful texture and taste.  I cut the sugar in half and did not use the nuts, but still amazingly good.  Can't wait to make it for the extended family at Christmas.
