A long time ago, I found an excellent homemade recipe on the internet.  I can't find it anymore...so I looked to allrecipes.com.  I was attracted to this recipe bc it seemed simple.  I admit that in terms of texture and form, the cookie was excellent.  HOWEVER, it lacked flavour.  I found that I had to add at least 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves to give it that kick.  I also doubled the amount of brandy and vanilla essence.   I also toasted the almonds.  It came out authentic-enough ( but it still lacked a bit of kick ).  I have grown up and lived in Cyprus and Greece for 10 years, so I know that specific " kick " that is distinctive of kourambiethes.  I will make this recipe again, but I will add the cloves and nutmeg spice, double up the brandy, icing sugar and vanilla essence.

Hi, thanks for the recipe. I tried to make these and they tasted really nice but they were extremely crumbly that they were really hard to eat.. I want to try make them again but I need them to be more solid.

this recipe was pretty good although I made several changes to it instead of all Brandy I used Brandy and Marsala wine, I also used pure anise and almond extract for flavor, as well as he spoon of clove and Nutmeg to taste. I rolled out the entire recipe of cookie dough into a log, then used a bench scraper to cut the cookies to the desired with. I then shape them into crescents and bake them off for 25 minutes. after Cooling I just did them in powdered sugar and place them individually into cupcake paper cups due to their flaky texture.
