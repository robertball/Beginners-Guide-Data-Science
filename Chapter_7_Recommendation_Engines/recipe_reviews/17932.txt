I have used this recipe 5 or 6 times.  I always soak in the brine overnight.  Make sure you smoke    it long enough. I use about 7-8 lb pork butt and smoke atleast 10 hrs. The first few times the pork was done but didn't pull apart.  I started going 10 hours or longer and it just pulls apart.  Very tender and flavorful.  I use a variation of the rub.  Don't forget to rinse the brine off before you put your rub on.  Let it sit(rest) 20 minutes once you take it off the smoker. I use mostly hickory to smoke it on a weber grill using the indirect heat method.Put a small pan of water directly over the coals and keep it full. Cook the fat side up,to keep the pork tender.  Try this recipe and you will be hooked on pulled pork.  A great and inexpensive way to feed a small group for your backyard party.

I agree with EVERYTHING ALMOST...  But instead of 160 degrees I raise temperature to 185 degrees so that the meat releases the bones and fat can be pushed off the meat.  I also wrap in a HEAVY DUTY aluminium foil envelope after 4 hours of smokeing to trap all the flavor and moistness inside to be cooked all the way down to the bone. you can insert the thermometer into the meat thru the wrap as long as you don't poke a hole in the bottom of wrap as the meat is cooking in it's juices after wrapped.  Slices of onion and pieces of crushed garlic and pepper can be mixed with applesauce and stuffed into little slits in the shoulder to taste.

Dude!! This is without a doubt the best pulled pork I have ever had and I have had a lot of good pork but nothing like this. Today, 12/18/2005 and 9* outside, I am smokin' my second 8 pound Boston Butt using Smokin' Ron's Basic Brine for Smoking Meat. I poke several holes with a meat fork and soak the butt over night. The next morning I pat dry the butt and rub a generous amount of Grill Mates Pork Rub, light brown sugar, onion and garlic powder. I start off with Hickory wood chunks mixed with Cherry chips. For the second round of smoke, I use Pecan wood chunks mixed with Applewood chips. I go through about 5 cans of wood with two of them using the Hickory/Cherry mix and the remaining three using the Pecan/Apple Mix. I smoke at temps of 210-220* for about 24-26 hours or until the internal temp is 170*. 
BTW, I use a Brinkmann Smoke N Pitt and converted the firebox to use gas using the Afterburner system.

I would smoke the pork until it reaches an internal temp. of at least 190.  200-210 is optimal.

ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVEABLE SMOKED BUTT!  I USED THE BUTT ROAST WITHOUT THE BONE.  USE THE RUB THAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR THIS RECIPE.  TALK ABOUT AN EASY AND EXCELLENT RUB!  IT ADDED AWESOME FLAVOR TO THE BUTT!  YOU GUYS NAILED IT!  I HAVE AN ELECTRIC SMOKER AND USED HICKORY CHUNKS AND APPLE WOOD TWIGS FOR A GREAT SMOKE.  SMOKE PERMEATES THE MEAT IN THE FIRST 3 HOURS, SO STOKE THE FIRE UP GOOD!  I ADDED MORE WOOD AFTER 1/2 HOUR, AND THEN AGAIN AFTER AN HOUR, THEN AGAIN AFTER AN HOUR.  I SMOKED THESE BUTTS FOR 6 HOURS, AND FINISHED THEM OFF OF MY WEBER GRILL TO REALLY GET THE BARK FINISHED OFF MORE THAN ANYTHING.  TEMPERATURE WAS 175 AFTER THIS 6 HOURS.  PULLED APART VERY EASY.  IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED THIS RECIPE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO SO!  IT IS AWESOME PULLED PORK.  I FINISHED MINE OFF WITH SOME BBQ SAUCE I PICKED UP AT THE GROCERY STORE THAT I LIKE "SILVER DOLLAR CITY"  OZARK RECIPE.  MADE BY "OTTS" IN BRANSON, MISSOURI.  ITS GOOD AND THICK AND HAS GREAT FLAVOR!

This was amazing!  I would recommend getting the internal temperature to about 180F for maximum flavor and tenderness.

judibuggs old man here. soaked meat in a carolina vinegar sauce first for about four hours. needed more time in the soak, probably over night. did wrap in foil the last hour. used a combo of hickory and jack daniels chips for smoking. this was very good. was rushed when made. will take more time with it next time.

I make pulled pork all the time. I'd put the dry rub on for at least 6 hours before smoking. I usually throw mine in the smoker the night before at 180 so it'll have an extended period of time for the smoke to penetrate, then in the morning raise the temp to 235. Once the meat hits about 150, it won't take on any more smoke flavor. 

Cook until the temp hits 195, don't worry it won't be dry and overdone. You can't pull it if you only take it up to 160. Mine usually take between 12-14 hours. Then FTC (Foil, Towel, Cooler) for at least a half hour to let the juices re-distribute. The butt will stay hot for at least 4 hours in the cooler. Don't pull until you're ready to serve.

This was my first venture with smoked food.  Very easy to follow and very easy to prepare.  I used the suggested brine, and also added paprika and garlic powder to the seasoning rub.  Fantastic.

my dad makes this for special occasions and the smell itself is to die for.. neighbors make their way over when they know he is making his barbecue. we use a simplified version of leaving the meat plain and no brining. this brings out the flavor of the meat and the smoke taste. its a very traditional recipe. the meat should literally be so tender if falls apart when you take it off. it should be a long careful watched process to cook the meat properly. always place the meat fat side up and we always use hickory chips. we chop the meat coursely and add our favorite bbq sauce. i've had barbecue all over and this hands down is my favorite most authentic method. doesn't need anything else other than the smoke and the meat.. sometimes less is more.

Tried this for Memorial Day and was only my second attempt at smoking anything... I followed the instructions to the letter and did soak overnight in the brine. It came out fantastic and everyone loved it. The smoke ring was impressive too (see added photo). I could have let this go longer if I wasn't timing it for a dinner with guests but it was fabulous as is. If I were to do it again I would let it get a little higher than the 170 degrees I pulled it at. I would have let it go to 185 to pull apart easier.  All in all it was great and everyone loved it...I will definitely be doing this again!

this is a good recipe, I use my own rub/seasoning though equal parts of, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, red pepper, hungarian paprika, and 2 parts salt, (if you like it as a rub then add it to 1 cup brown sugar), but then again i use this seasoning on just about everything, also i don't have a good smoker so i use my gas grill and put mesquit chunks over flame side and meat on other side away from heat.... same basis

Simple and easy. My only suggestion is for TRUE pulled pork, it is imperative to take the internal temp past 160*, in fact the standard is 190-200*F and it will fall right off the bone. Breaking that 160*F plateau is essential for breaking down collagen into gelatin.

I made this last night.  It was wonderful (and I don't usually care for bbq).  Hubby said it is some of the best he has tasted.  I used the "basic brine for smoking meat" recipe on this site.  I did not have New Mexico chile powder so I used the Chili Powder that I had.  I smoked it with apple wood chunks.  After 4 hours I wrapped it in foil and continued smoking the meat.  It was tender...and good :)

Used this on a Pork Butt and it rocked our world... I just bought a smoker last weekend, and was looking for some help in getting started... this with the Brine recommendation... is perfection!  I have never! had pork this good, and coming from Kansas City, the birth of BBQ... that's saying a lot.

My previous review was innaccurate.  I left the a different recipe's review under Smokin Ron's on accident.  Smokin Ron's is good, but I like to vary meat rubs.

Best recipe.  Smoke with apple wood!  Really really good.

*****Make sure you brine for 12 hours!  
Check out the recipe here "Basic Brine for Smoking Meat" and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of liquid crab boil to brine recipe.  Unbelievable!

Great recipe but if you want the meat to fall apart you need to get the internal temp to at least 180-185 degrees. This is the temperature where the bonds break and the meat will fall apart. Also try using apple juice/cider instead of water for a nice sweet flavor

GREAT!!!!!  The wives cooked while the men rode ATV's all day and I smoked the Butt and the guys were very complimentary to this recipe.  I used the suggested Brine and the Pork was soooooo tender and juicy and oh, the flavor. You are Smokin' Ron....  Thank you.

Excellent recipe. I have made this a few times and I soak mine in basic salt water brown sugar brine for 12-24 hours then rub with a pork rub. I smoke my pork roast or shoulder uncovered for 2-4 hours then rap tight in foil with a small amount of Apple juice for another 12-16. I wait till the temp of the roast is above 185 (I wait till about 200) because then I really does fall right apart.

I smoked a 8.5lb pork shoulder yesterday and it was fantastic! I did use the basic brine instructions and it soaked over night prior to smoking. I did a few deviations from the recipe per the comments of others. One was that I used Big James' Pork Rub (which you can search on here). I smoked for 9hrs maintaining 200-220F, but I did wrap in foil half way through. And finally I cooked it with the fat side up. After 9hrs, I pulled it off and let it rest for 20-30mim. Results: "fall off the bone", juiciest, tastiest pork shoulder I ever had. I served a party of 12 and it was plenty. People raved about it all night. What a great feeling!

This was the best tasting pork butt that my family and I have ever tasted! Very easy to prepare also. The only way that I altered the recipe was to bake it in the oven. I added a tablespoon of instant smoke for an outdoor flavor.

Brined 8lb. pork butt overnight. Have smoked before without brine and brining it is the only way to go from now on. So much more moisture. Used a store bought coffee dry rub and smoked with apple chips in a electric smoker for 11 hours @ 225 degrees. It was so moist and  delicious that in my opinion it didn't require sauce.

I use my own rub which is salt, pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder and paprika.  I do inject apple juice and sugar mixture after brining then use a shaker to apply the rub all over after massaging  olive oil on the butt  to help it stick. Once it hits about 160f or when the bark is the nice color you’re looking for then I tightly wrap it in foil to finish, 205f internal temp. Too much smoke  is bitter.Let it rest for  40 minutes then shred. LoL I guess i just gave you my version.

Smoking to an internal temp of 200-205F will ensure "fall off the bone@ tenderness" - be patient and wait for it, you will be glad. A Boston butt  will take 1.5-2 hrs per pound at 225F. Hickory is a natural wood for pork.

Made it for the Super Bowl, had to speed the cooking time due to my lack of being prepared so it didn't pull quite as nice as I wanted (this was my fault, not the recipe).  It was delicious and I received tons of compliments, even heard a "best I ever had".  I added just a little Cajun seasoning and pork producers seasoning to the rub.  Great recipe, great instructions.  Thanks.

This is a good smoked pork recipe but you should really change the target internal temperature 145 is not going to be good. It should be at least 180 - 195 to break down all the fat and connective tissue that makes it moist and tender. Obviously if you cook it for 10 hours it should be way past 145 but smoking is about internal temps not time. Thanks.

I smoked a 9.2lb pork butt shoulder on a charcoal smoker using apple and some cherry. It took 9 hours at 190 degrees and it turned out great. I also used the basic brine recipe and added some extra seasoning to it and let it soak for 24 hours and this really tenderized and added juice to to the meat. The smoker also added a little burned crisp flavor edge that you will not get with a crock pot.
Easy and fast recipe to utilize for any level of smoking experience.

This recipe is great. Tried it the other night and the family loved it. I took a suggestion from above and soaked it in the brine overnight. Followed recipe as it is and it was perfect. Didn't even need to salt and pepper to taste. Thanks for sharing. I'll be making this all the time now.

I tried this last weekend and it was awesome. Brined overnight and used a combination of the suggested rub and some pre-made rub I had bought from the store. I wouldn't get too particular about the rub - any combination of spices probably works fine. I got the temperature of the meat to right at 180. It fell off the bone and was the best smoked meat i have ever eaten, including anything I have ordered at some very good barbeque restaurants here in KC. Considering you can buy a 7lb Boston rump roast for $14 bucks this is a very economical meal for a decent size group and everyone will be very impressed.

If you are only taking the internal temp to 165 you can't be getting it to pull.  195 IT is about the minimum to get pulled pork.  Now, you could chop it at 165 and make a great sandwich.

I like to pull it when done and add just a table spoon or 2 of rub to the meat and mix it up just adds to the level of flavor

was great except the internal temp on pork should be 160 minimum to eat and the pork butts need to reach at least 190 before it renders out enough to pull apart .  a temperature of 145 is not sufficient .

My wife asked if I could smoke pork butt for a party we were having that evening. This was great since it was very easy and simple to make. It has also become my families favorite rub!!
