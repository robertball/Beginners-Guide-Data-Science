These tasted really good. But they were FLAT. This is not a macaroon recipe. It is a recipe for almond flavored sugar cookies. If you want a true macaroon beat the egg whites with the sugar until stiff peaks form, before adding the other ingredients.

This recipe did not turn out correctly. I followed the measurements and the batter was like soup so I added more cake flour until I got a consistency  of a drop cookie dough. I used one cookie sheet(thermal)with parchment paper on top and another with foil on the top(ran out of p. paper). They poofed up like meringe cookies while baking then fell when I took them out of the oven. I could not get them off the paper(never had any cookie stick like that to parchment). They tore all apart. The taste was just like eating straight almond paste,which we love in any dessert recipe that we have tried. Will not try again and play with the recipe due to the cost of the almond paste.

Not very good at all!   Definitely not a true macaroon.  They have to be beaten. I could get the same thing by adding almond extract to my sugar cookie recipe. Sorry. :-(

This may not be a macaroon recipe, per say; however it is a seasonal favorite around my house and if you follow the recipe exactly you will have a puffy, chewy delish almond cookie!

I have not even tried this recipe and I don't even know if it is good but I find it too funny that people think coconut makes a "true Macaroon" the very first Macaroon was almond NOT coconut! Good Luck!
