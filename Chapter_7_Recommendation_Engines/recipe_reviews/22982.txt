This was just okay. Not very "veggie" considering there is only bell peppers and onions. It tasted good cold the next day. I added grated fresh parmesean cheese and it was better. If you want a heartier veggie patty, try the zucchini patties on this site. I've rated that one as well and gave it 5 stars.

Delicious. A great alternative to traditional sweet pancakes. I added mushrooms and jalapeno pepper. My husband and I ate them for breakfast with a little margarine and dipped in ketchup. Definitely a recipe I will continue to make.

My family enjoyed these for dinner. We had syrup on them, but I bet they'd be good with salsa and sour cream.  I also added some minced rign bologna I had left over.  I will definitely make again.

Surprisingly very tasty. I would add more veggies to the mix than what it calls for and don't be afraid to season it up more than it says. I used a bit of mrs. dash but went light for fear of over seasoning, I could have stood to add more without worry. The tomato/onion mixture on top with the sour cream in the side really kicked it up a notch! Husband loved it! I will make again.  It is filling and tasty.

I decided to try something a little different in order to make this recipe fit in with my lower carb diet. I used Trim Healthy Mama Baking Blend instead of the Bisquick, using a little bit less than called for. I also subbed  coconut oil and added a little salt. These turned out good and fit in perfectly with my way of eating.
