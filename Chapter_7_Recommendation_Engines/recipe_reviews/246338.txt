I've made this a few times for Ethiopian friends, and they loves it. I like it with a lot of ginger but was told that's not authentic.

Yum! Happened to have all the ingredients one night so I threw this together. Omitted the optional ginger and added a bit of garlic salt and a squeeze of lemon - tasting as I went. Also used peanut oil by accident (picked the wrong bottle out of the pantry - oops!), will use again. Overall a simple side I'll make whenever I find myself with all the ingredients.

This was pretty bland for both my husband and for me.  I've eaten a lot of Ethiopian food, both in the States and in Ethiopia, and was looking forward to making this for the first time with beets plucked right from the garden, but I'll need to perk this particular one up a bit if it's going to be a repeat dish.  I do think it has good potential with the right mix of added spice and am not ready to give up on it, but as it is, at least for us, it was just okay.  (I appreciate this base recipe from which I'll start experimenting though!)

Oh my gosh I absolutely fell in love with this and it will be a staple item for me.  The sweetness from the beets plays so well with the potatoes.  I can eat this just by itself.

Very good dish made even better when served with fragrant injera bread. I also added some hot peppers. Thank you for the recipe.

I recommend that you definetly put in additional salt and ginger because without them, this dish tasted bland.  I put in 2 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 1/2 tsp of ginger powder as an alternative to actual ginger. 

Sadly,  even with these additions, the dish was not as tasty as the one I ate recently at an Ethiopian restaurant.  I remember it to be  a bit sour and very savory, and this dish  barely gave a kick and was soggy.

We loved this dish! My son and I are transitioning to a plant-based eating lifestyle. We sampled this dish at an Ethiopian food stand and weâ€™re determined to make it a part of our regular meal plan. 

We added seven spice powder to our tastes. Love this recipe.

Made this for my significant other, who is Ethiopian, and he said it  was better than the Ethiopian restaurant he frequents. Used red onion  (half cup instead of whole onion) instead of yellow but not sure that made any difference.    Added jalapenos at the very end
