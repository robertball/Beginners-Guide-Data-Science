I too made a couple simple substitutions (cod and bacon instead of haddock and pancetta) because of what I had on hand.  Everyone wanted more!  My boyfriend said it was almost like eating crab.  Great recipe, Thanks for sharing!!!

The lemon aioli was sooooo good!! This is definitely a keeper in my house! I used sole instead of haddock and bacon in place of panchetta and since my sole fillets were really thin, I just laid the bacon right on top.  Just perfect.

I loved it - used prosciutto (sp) because it is what I had.  My husband is not a fan of haddock but he liked the sauce and will use the left over on his beloved salmon.

I used bacon and it didn't get crispy.  I tried to up the temp to 425 but it was still undercooked.  The aioli sauce was very good.  I will make this again but possibly cook the bacon first?

I love this recipe. I'm not a big fan of fish but I think I could eat this everyday! The only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made it with bacon. I couldn't find pancetta when I was shopping. And the sauce is out of this world!!

I wasn't a huge fan of this. I'm glad I tested it out on myself before preparing it for my husband. It wasn't bad, it just seemed bland to me.

Absolutely fantastic dish, and it was so quick and easy to put together!  I invited guests over to try this recipe, and it was a definite hit.  They all loved it, and couldn't stop raving about how well the combination of flavors worked with each other.  Definitely something I'll make again.
