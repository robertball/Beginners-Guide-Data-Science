Very tasty!  I had to make some modifications to fit what I had in the pantry, so my version was only gluten free, not vegan or dairy free.  I did not have shallots or red onion, but yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic tasted fine to me.  No corn oil either, so I used extra virgin olive oil.  I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth.  No frozen corn on hand, so I used 2 cans of the green giant super sweet niblets, drained.  I still reserved one cup, but pureed the rest, which was about 6 oz more corn than the recipe called for.  But really, what can more corn hurt?  :)  Right before serving I put in somewhere between 3/4 and 1 cup of heavy cream.  Not exactly sure as it was whatever was left in the container and I didn't think to measure before I dumped it in.  It was good before I did that, it was over the top after the cream!  I was wishing I had some shrimp to throw in there too, but not this time.  Oh, and I just realized I didn't put in the parsley!!!  Oh well!!

Definitely a keeper and good enough for company.  One suggestion is to roast 3 sweet potatoes, because they were good enough to eat like candy so not all of them made it into the soup.  Oops!

this was fairly easy to make, very tasty and relatively healthy. couldn't find corn oil in the store, so just used vegetable oil b/c i couldn't find my olive oil. it was very flavorful and a nice combo for fall. one thing it could have used was a little kick. i put a few splashes of tabasco in my bowl, which was good, but not sure that was exactly what it needed. my husband thought white pepper may have done the trick. definitely a keeper.

If you like sweet potato you will love this soup.  I used about 1.5 sweet potatoes (mine were huge!) and they took about 30 min to roast, but next time I will probably chop them into smaller cubes which should reduce the cook time.  I added some hot sauce to mine, which kicked up the flavour just a bit.  I would definitely make this again.

This soup was too sweet - with the sweetness of the sweet potatoes and then the corn. There wasn't really any other flavor going on, just the overwhelming sweetness. I agree with the other reviewers who said that something was missing... I might try to take what's left and add a lot more stock and maybe some other veg, in effort to cut the sweetness down. UPDATE: I made the recipe to a 'T' and wasn't happy with the results, so the next night I browned some fresh good-quality chorizo (from pork shoulder), then added two cups chicken stock, crushed red chili flakes, chopped cilantro, and the juice of 1/2 a lime. I simmered that for about 30 minutes. I then added the remainder of the original soup to my new mixture. The result was fabulous, we all agreed, and I would make the second version again. I understand, however, that this is nothing close to the original recipe!

With a few modifications our version was delicious! I used a can of creamed corn in place of corn puree and a can of whole corn in the end. I ended up using an extra cup of broth to total 4 cups and there was enough liquid. I also doubled the potato to 2. At the end I used dried parsley in place of fresh and a bit of salt and pepper to spice it up. It was a hearty soup that is great for Fall or anytime!

This is delicious! I boiled the sweet and regular potato together in the vegetable broth and mixed in one can of regular corn, undrained, and one can of cream style corn. I thinkened it up with some shredded cheese melted in at the end. The family begged me to make more!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  There was not nearly enough liquid, and he end result was nothing like a chowder.  It wasn't even like a stew, it was more like a hash.  It tasted pretty good (I agree w/ the first review that it was missing something, couldn't figure out what), but it just tasted like a bowl of potato and corn hash browns to us.  I will probably play around with the recipe, adding more broth, perhaps creamed corn instead of frozen, and maybe some half and half.  Thanks for the great idea, but we didn't love it.

I thought the flavour was delicious! The only problem was that there was not nearly enough liquid, especially the next day after more was absorbed.  Next time I will double everything except for the potatoes and add green beans and carrots.

This was excellent and so easy! I roasted the sweet potatoes whole (make sure to line oven w/ foil) at 450 for about an hour and then added to the other ingredients that I already had simmering for a while.  I didn't have celery, used regular onion and garlic, no tomato paste and chicken broth. I also did not add a potato or parsley. Very nice flavor.

This soup is great--very flavorful and easy to work with!  I made this before and added large chunks of tomato; I made it last night and added two huge cloves of garlic (my family loves garlic), substituted the vegetable broth for chicken broth, and added about 2 pounds of turkey ham to give it some extra protein.  This soup is great, not only by the recipe, but it's also easy to work with/adapt for what you have in your kitchen.  I get compliments every time I make it!

Really tasty recipe, thanks for sharing:) The only thing I added was some evaporated milk at the end because I wanted it to be a bit creamy.

So very, very yummy!  I made a couple of modifications based off of what I had on hand.  I will list them below.

I sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper on the sweet potatoes prior to roasting them to combat the sweetness.

I used white onion, instead of red.  I used Chervil instead of thyme, because somehow I am out of thyme.  I also omitted the shallots, simply because I didn't have any.

My husband raved and raved about this chowder.  It will definitely being going into the recipe book!  Thank you!

A keeper! This is a delicious recipe and full of good veggies! A yummy veggie meal! Very filling. The only thing I will change the next time would be to cut back substantially on the dried thyme as it was somewhat overpowering. Otherwise perfect!

An incredibly satisfying soup perfect for a wholesome vegetarian meal on a cold night. I added about half a cup of toasted peanuts on top to add some crunch. I will be keeping this recipe as a staple from now on!

This is a really yummy soup that is also fairly healthy.  It's easy to prepare and smells heavenly while cooking.  Might add a bit more liquid next time and there's no way that it serves 10 in my family.  But those are tiny things.

2nd time changes - Added an additional cup of vegie broth, substituted 1 zucchini, chopped, for celery and added it at the same time as the onion.  Added mix of cornstarch and vegetable broth for thickness.  Doubled the corn.

Honestly one of the best soups I've ever made. Everyone loves it regardless of their dietary restrictions/preferences. I added carrots and sub coconut oil for corn and siracha for tomato paste.Just made another pot today.

would be nice to add in the directions not to mix up the cubed potato and the sweet potato(when its time to put the first potato in the pot). i ended up having to mic a cubed potato and then wasnt able to do the 20min simmer because i'd put the sweet potatoes in in error. needed to not have one more thing to wash so skipped the pureed corn bit. next time will reduce some liquid and add cream.

Followed the other recommendations and used can of creamed corn.  Some might want to use more liquid than recommended.

I had a recipe for Sweet Potato Corn Chowder from my great grandmother and can't find it so I looked on this site and after reading the reviews I think I can tell you what the missing ingredient is.  As I recall, according to her recipe, it is "fat back," aka a slab of bacon, that is diced, rendered in the pan and the drippings from that are used to cook the other ingredients.  I know, not the healthiest, but you only need a small, 4" X 4" X 1.5" block and it really enhances all the flavors.

Wonderful for a chilly fall dinner!  I had never had roasted sweet potatoes as prepared in the recipe, so the soup was a little short of sweet potatoes!!

Very tasty, perfect for fall!  I blended mine partly with a hand blender, as I like my flavours to mingle.  I agree it could use a little kick - I might add some red pepper flakes next time.

I like the sweetness of this dish but found it lacking in liquid. I must admit though that I didn't purée the corn with the cup of water so I may be short of a cup of liquid there but I think it still needs more liquid than one more cup. Perhaps next time I will add in a can of creamed corn and maybe even evaporated milk to make it more chowder-like?

I took the advice of Jen and added 1/2 and 1/2 (not exactly sure how much--maybe 1/4 cup), I also puréed,
roughly 1/2 of the soup to thicken it. Added some curry, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, and chili powder for some heat. It's delicious. I will serve it with an arugula salad.

I posted earlier... Accidentally sent it. In addition to the extra broth, potato, garlic and onion I used creamed corn for 1/2 of the corn. I also added red pepper flakes and creole seasoning (this can double as your salt in the recipe too)  to the sweet potatoes before roasting as well as to the broth. And I added diced tomatoes. Delish'!

Although this recipe came out AMAZING (I was on the phone with my mom after eating and my boyfriend yelled into the phone- "Candy, your daughter can COOK!!!"), I'm giving the recipe a 3 because it was a solid base but needed some extras to really be tasty. Used 4 cups of vegetable stock instead of 3.  I included everything already in the recipe, but after the soup boiled and then simmered for 25 minutes, I then added ground sage (which I *highly* recommend; it really added a great fall flavor), more pepper and salt, about 3/4 or 1/2 cup of light cream, and Siracha (hot sauce) to taste.  The result was spectacular.  After finishing his bowl, my boyfriend was literally spooning it straight out of the pot!

So good, so easy, and so good as leftovers. Pureeing the corn gives it great texture. Thanks so much!

Really great flavor!  I followed the recipe but adjusted it to our taste by: I used 1- 1/2 sweet potatoes, roasted; added about a 1/2 can of drained corn at the end (I wanted a bit more);I also boiled a small, white potato along with the other 1/2 of the sweet potato then pureed it in the blender with a bit of chicken stock for a thickener.  We wanted a thick soup tonight. I didn't have veg. stock, so used a carton of chicken stock...  Really yummy!!  We'll all enjoy this recipe!!  Thanks!!

I love this soup. I did make a few changes. I use canned corn, added an extra sweet potato and left out the bay leaf. I also added pea's. It is so easy to make and taste great. I bring it to work for lunch all week.

Thank you to everyone who posted suggestions to make this the perfect chowder. I made it for a luncheon, and doubled the recipe.  I used 8 cups of broth, 1 canned creamed corn, and 1 can kernel corn.  I also added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Doubling the sweet potatoes took about 80 minutes to cook well.  It is delicious!

I mis-read the instructions and added the roasted sweet potatoes too early... and it still was excellent. I think I had 4 bowls the first day. Nice, lightly sweet and savory flavor. I tried adding Cholula to my second bowl (I like some zip) and it didn't work. On my 3rd bowl I added tobasco. That really added a nice zing too it.

When I was walking home amidst the piles of snow the other night, I remembered I had leftovers of this soup waiting for me in the fridge. That was a beautiful moment. The only thing I would do differently with this recipe would be pureeing some of the potatoes to make it more creamy.

Delicious! I found this recipe after doing an ingredients search because I needed to use up some sweet potatoes.  The only thing I didn't have was the tomato paste so I tossed in a (mostly drained) can of Rotel figuring the tomatoes would be a good sub and the chiles would add a little spice. I also added a can of white beans just because, why not?! :) Based on other reviewers comments, I added extra vegetable broth (4 cups instead of 3) to make it more of a soup than a stew. The Rotel gave it the perfect little kick and even my 13 year old who initially said, "ew, too many vegetables" ended up eating two big bowls. Will make this one again for sure!

We love this soup! Have been meaning to review it for a couple of years now. To save time, I will usually roast the sweet potatoes either earlier in the day, or the night before. Then it's a snap to put together. A very satisfying, healthy dish. Thank you, Mellie!

Yum! I love it made w/ chicken broth and also about a 1/2 tablespoon of red pepper flakes (which surprisingly brings out a LOT of spice). Oh, I also omit the celery, shallot, and tomato paste.

Wow - this soup is going to be a regular addition.  Followed the recipe exactly (except for adding a little bacon salt).  The sweet potatoes are key to this dish.  Perfect for fall/winter!

We enjoyed this, and it didn't take as long as the stated prep time; it was actually fairly easy. I made a few changes: olive oil, yellow onion, no white potato or celery. I think the potato is meant to thicken the broth, because mine was fairly thin, so I simmered it with the lid off, then threw in about 1/4 of the roasted sweet potato and blended it. Great flavor and a definite keeper.

In general the soup was quite good, but I did find that it was too sweet for my taste.  Next time I would use more regular potatoes in the puree part and a lot less pureed corn.  I would mostly use just the corn kernels.  I think that would cut down on the sweetness.  And I would use chicken broth instead of vegetable.

This right here was the business!  I seasoned my sweet potatoes with smoked paprika and a chipotle seasoning so I could add some spice.  I wanted a little more spice in the end so I added red paper flakes.  This came out to be really good and I added like 3 more white potatoes and more stock after hearing that it dwindles down the next day!  I loved this!

I agree with many other reviewers who have said this needs something.  The taste of thyme was strong, but  other flavor was lacking.  It is a great deal of prep for something that turns out mediocre and I wouldn't make it again.

I made this recipe with some of the same modifications as other cooks, due to lack of exact ingredients.  I did add the shrimp at the end as suggested by another cook and it was terrific.  It was hearty, a touch of sweet and with a little siracha, a little bit of heat

Quite delicious and super satisfying, it really hit the spot! Used three small/medium sized sweet potatoes and a handful of New Potatoes, maybe 15-20. Also didn’t have corn oil so used vegetable oil. I think next time I would add some spice since it has some sweetness from the potatoe and corn. Maybe a poblano pepper or jalapeño.

It's a nice flavoured soup and I loved it. But my SO didn't like it because he said it tastes like creamed corn which he dislikes. I disagree. My brother also made it and loved it.

Delicious. Unfortunately I burned the sweet potatoes and had to start over but it was worth it. I put in some guajillo pepper (mild) after it was done and I really liked the addition.

Made substantially as written (only had one sweet potato; no tomato paste so I minced up some sun dried tomato w/o oil). We didn’t care for the sweet potato so next time I will use all russets or mixed baby potatoes to take it to a 5-star for us.

It was too sweet and lacked punch.  Next time I will add lime juice, more spices and possibly sausage

I had some leftover cooked sweet potato so I decided to make this soup.  It was delicious!  We really liked the slight sweetness from the puréed corn.  I had some leftover cream of celery soup in the fridge which I added as well as a few sautéed asparagus and snow peas and these added even more flavour as well as some nice colour.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thérèse

I substituted chicken broth for vegetable, added an extra sweet potato, and added spicy italian sausage. So good!

Really yummy and filling. Added tofu for protein and it made it even more filling. Will definitely make this one again. Prep work was a little more than I expected going into it (should have read it all the way through first!), but all in all totally worth it. I expect it will taste even better as leftovers.

This is my favorite soup recipe, it's thick and sweet and comforting! I always leave the white potato out because of allergies. I also cook this in the instant pot a lot to make it easier! Salad shrimp is a great addition too!

I did make some changes, but I used every last ingredient--I only added to because it was so bland. I really tried to liven it up--I fried a couple strips of bacon and chopped them up.  I used the bacon grease to saute the vegetables and really let them go low and slow to bring out flavor.  I pureed the sweet potato in the veggie broth and then added all the ingredients back in the soup. Added a pinch of cayenne to kick it up.  Still bland, not sure what it's missing.  It was okay, not great, I'll eat it but probably won't make again.

This is an amazing starter recipe! The changes I made are as follows: I didn't have a red onion or shallots so I used a sweet onion and minced garlic; I used chicken broth instead of veggie and added 2 diced chicken breasts. Instead of thyme and bay leaf (I'm not a fan), I used crushed cilantro and cumin and used white shoe peg corn. It was a little sweet for my taste so next time I will only use half of a large sweet potato. Other than the sweetness it was really good! I did have to add more liquid and also added mashed potato flakes as a thickening agent.

A resounding yes! I will make this soup over and over. It is true, everyone loved this soup. Even my husband who absolutely hates sweet potatoes asked for more and said this is a definite keeper!

Overall, the final product was delicious so it gets 4 stars. that said, the final product was far from a chowder and more like a potato casserole. next time I make this I will use more water and maybe some green bell peppers.

This was just okay.  It was a little thin and didn't look creamy like the picture.  I had to add a little half and half and shredded cheddar.  Kids wouldn't eat it and the hubby thought it was a little too sweet for his taste.

My family loved this!  I'm vegetarian, but my family isn't, so I have a hard time finding things that they'll eat that I can, too.  I made a couple of tweeks, I upped the broth to 4 Cups, decreased the celery to 1 cup,  and left out the thyme and bay leaf because I didn't have any and my family loved it!

This recipe is a bit time consuming but WELL worth the effort. A perfectly hearty soup for the winter. Don't let "vegan" scare you from this. I have made it multiple times and all I think is YUMMMMM. It also holds up very well for several days and trully only gets better. I have served it at dinner parties and I get nothing but compliments and people begging me for the recipe. SUPER AWESOME!!!!! The only changes I make is I add more sweet potatoes and corn. I like it super chunky. I love to serve it with a roasted beet salad. It is a perfect partner.

Wow! Totally loved this! I added about 1/2 C cream at the end of cooking. I know some people didn't think there was enough liquid but I like the thickness of this chowder. I think it's perfect for a hearty warming chowder on a cold day.

This is an awesome recipe - so yummy.  I used a hand pureer just before serving was the only change I made - oh and used yams as the store was out of sweet potatoes.

This is an easy recipe that tastes great and is healthy too. The only things I did different were: used olive oil, fresh thyme, no celery, and a yellow onion.

This was good, not fabulous, though. Recipe was followed exactly, and family ate it. But they didn't rave or ask for seconds.
