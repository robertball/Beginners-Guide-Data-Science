My boyfriend and I were very surprised by how good this dish was.  We didn't have macadamia nuts so I used finely chopped pecans.  We didn't have hot chile paste so I used 1/2 chopped Jalapeno.  It was delish!  We will do this recipe again, no doubt!

This was a great recipe! We made it in a pan because it was raining, but it still tasted great. We had roasted sweet potatoes with rosemary as a side. This was my first time to try tuna (I am not a big fish eater) and it was great. I will definitely try it again and hopefully next time it's not raining so we can grill it.

Made this dish and it was wonderful!  The nuttiness of the macadamia nuts was very interesting contrast to the Papaya salsa.  I had never used Papaya for salsa before and it was very good.  I added some cumin and used 2 cloves of Garlic.  My Girl friend loved it also!

Tuna Steaks were great! Try to flip the streaks on the grill as little as possible to keep the nuts from falling off. The salsa was really good too but isn't needed. The steaks are great by themselves!
