Very good taste, I used two cans minced clams and added parmesan cheese to sauce.

This was DELICIOUS! I used 2 cans of minced clams, less clam water and a little more wine (use the best dry white wine you can afford - it makes all the difference). I didn't have linguini, but regular spagetti worked just as well. A simple to prepare yet flavorsome and classy meal. We had it with a mixed green salad, herby breadsticks, and the rest of the white wine!! Wonderful!

We've made recipes from Cooking Light before - too many to count.  This one, sorry to say, did not live up to the standard.  Sure, it was simple and quick, but it lacked in flavor (more complex spices, perhaps?) and texture. It just wasn't that good. We'll continue to look for a better recipe.

Good Recipe.  I followed others suggestion to add an additional can of clams.  I didn't add parsley or thyme and it was still a great meal.

Delicious.  I had some artichokes to use up, so I steamed them and added the diced hearts to the sauce with the clams.  Then we dipped the leaves in butter as an appetizer!  I also sprinkled fresh parmasean cheese on it to serve.  But I think it would be great (and even easier) without those modifications.   I only had dried herbs, but it had great flavor.

Ehhh.  That's about all I have for this recipe.  I had to add quite a bit of additional seasonings to get this to an edible point.  It was very bland.  Also, I had the same problem that others stated with the fact that this really doesn't have a "sauce."  It's just kind of an oily coating.  I was pretty disappointed here.

Unfortunately, I didn't like the sauce and ended up throwing it out.  It didn't thicken at all, and the wine flavour was way too strong.  I also don't know what the purpose of using both oil and butter is.

I added quite a bit of red pepper flakes to this and it was very good. But my one complaint was that it did not thicken at all. I even added 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch (mixed in with a dribble of water) near the end which helped a little. I had to serve it in soup bowls and soak up all the sauce with French bread. Puta lots of Parmesan on it too!

We thought this recipe was good, I added more clams than the recipe called for, and next time I think I'll use less wine, because the wine had a very strong flavor!

I thought this was excellent!  Light, great tasting, easy to make - I made it with whole wheat linguine.  I'll be making this again - thanks!

I really liked this! I agree that adding more clams is best. I didn't have the minced on hand, and although using just the baby clams wasn't bad, I'll bet it would have been even better. But the recipe is easy and fast!
