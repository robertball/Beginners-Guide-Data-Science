This is a very forgiving recipe.  I did not have mushrooms so substituted some frozen peas.  I only had microwave bacon so sauteed the leeks in olive oil instead.  And I only had low fat sour cream.  Still it was awesome!  Family loved it.  I might try throwing in some diced chicken next time, cooking it with the leeks.

Definitely better than it looks made some adjustments by adding extra: 1 tbsp sour cream, 1 tbsp parmesan cheese and basil I personally eye balled it to my taste preferences and parsley. I couldn't tell there was sour cream in it & my mom ate it and she's picky.

We made this recipe tonight and loved it.  We didn't have any mushrooms at home, but it was wonderful without them.  This recipe is flexible so that you can add more leeks (as we did) and other ingredients to suit your tastes, just remember to balance any added dry with moist ingredients.  It was definitely a hit at our house, and we'll make it again.

Great recipe! I was able to use only one pot. We used Rotelle because my 7 year old son picked the pasta and thought it looked cooler, Apple smoked bacon, more leek than the recipe suggests because the one I had was huge, baby bellas and light sour cream. The cook time is not 20 minutes if you read the directions and it could take longer depending on your bacon.  The parsley was good, but I might try basil or a mix of fresh herbs next time.

we really enjoyed this and per usual i used what i had on hand.. doubled the leeks and had to halve the bacon (but definitely want to try it with the entire amount!) used portabella mushrooms and added a lot more parm, parsley, and yogurt (in place of sour cream).. and salted to taste.. this was a nice simple lunch for us.. ty for the recipe

Overall a good recipe, but I suggest half the bacon and twice the leeks.

this was a great recipe but I didn't have all of the ingredients so I made some adjustments: instead of bow tie pasta I used fresh cheese tortellini, and instead of mushrooms I used red peppers. After reading some of the earlier reviews, I added some chicken broth to the leeks while cooking. Turned out delish!

I have made this a dozen times. it is great as written, but sometimes I'll put a little spin on it and add crushed red pepper flakes or serve on cheese tortellini.

This pasta was too dry, even after I added 1/2 cup of water the pasta was boiled in. I used pre-cooked, drained bacon, so perhaps if there had been more bacon grease, this would have been better.

Delicious and surprising. I was very suspicious about the sour cream, but it gives an unique taste to this dish. Perfect for a quick and tasteful dinner.

Really wonderful taste! The addition of the sourcream was a major plus.. and surprise! My kids gobbled it up! I left out the mushrooms (which would have made it much richer) only because I have a few in my house who turn their noses up at them.. something for more of an adult palette! Thank you for the recipe!
