Add black beans and fresh tomatoes. didn't add any sour cream, Used cream cheese instead. Added the whole cup of cheese to the meal, and decided not to bake it. Very flavorful and good. I would make it again. Had green beans and watermelon as a side.

This is good but not taco flavored...I added cumin and cilantro and garlic salt. Still not taco flavored  I also added tomato sauce 'cause it was dry.  The addition of tomato sauce diluted the seasonings. So this is a good starting point!

I made this with cream cheese instead of sour cream, with an added can of black beans, and the whole cup of cheese in the dish and another half cup on top before baking. It's DELICIOUS.! Also, it's more like 10+ servings. Lol

Had to adjust it a little due to what I had on hand. No zucchini and I didn't have a yellow pepper so I threw in a can of mexi-corn. Only had a 10 oz can of diced tomatoes so that is what I used. Turned out great!!!!! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is in my "keeper" file.  A definite hit with my family and our Brazilian exchange student!  I didn't have zucchini but added black beans as suggested.  Thanks SO much for this one.  A big hit!

The family gobbled this up! The vegetables add great flavour as does the cheese.  This will go into regular rotation for sure! The only modification I made was I used gluten free pasta (corn) and it was yummy! Thanks for the great recipie.
