I had to improvise a lot with this recipe to use what I had on hand.  I used red leaf lettuce, green onion, parmesan cheese and nectarines instead of peaches.  I did use the almonds, but I toasted them at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes - until fragrant and lightly golden.  It was a great salad, and at least somewhat similar to this recipe.  I made the dressing for Strawberry and Feta Salad by MSCHEF, also on this site.  The salad paired wonderfully with our grilled NY strip steaks.

A very colorful and attractive salad. It wasn’t bad, but not one that I would make again.  Sorry.

This was good.  All 3 of us (hubby, teenager, & myself) liked it.  It was not as good as my memory of a nectarine or peach salad that had blue cheese, but was otherwise very similar to this, that I had several years ago.  I'm very glad I found the recipe, though, and I think next time I'll just try nectarine & blue cheese as substitutions.  I made this for Recipe Group, sorta, but a few weeks behind schedule.

Excellent salad to use with fresh peaches. I added some fresh picked blueberries and some crumbled feta. Light fresh and delicious!

Recipe Group: Tried this out on the family tonight, it was good but not amazing. I did use chives instead of red onion for our taste preference. I made Raspberry Vinaigrette II from this site, which has mint in it, and thought it went well with the peaches.

I made this for Recipe Group July 17. If not for that I might not have tried this particular salad. I'm glad I did because the flavor combo was good and I would definitely make it again if I had the ingredients. My only problem is that this salad is ugly if you toss it. Everything is in the  bottom of the bowl except for clumpy, stuck together spinach. I mention it because I didn't expect it from the photos and I would have been sorely disappointed to serve this to guests. I ended up moving the spinach to another bowl and then topping it with the rest.

We liked this recipe.  I used ingredients I had on hand which was a spring mix containing some spinach vs. all spinach and I used an Italian cheese blend which contained Asiago. The raspberry vinaigrette dressing and the peaches paired nicely together.  This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for July 11, 2015. Thanks for sharing your recipe, ellie!

Recipe Group Selection:  11, July 2015 ~ I made this for my lunch and enjoyed the combination of flavors.  We like the lettuce/fruit mixture in salads and the raspberry vinaigrette was a nice addition.  Nice selection for recipe group, this week.

It was good - nothing Earth shattering. Not a huge fan of purple onions so I didn’t use a lot of it

It was ok, but not as good as the strawberry salad with raspberry vinaigrette. Probably won't make again.

I didn't have red onion and used pecans instead of almonds & parmesan instead of Asiago but it was very tasty.  I will make it again per the recipe instructions!

I LOVED this combination.  I used shaved manchego cheese instead of the asiago, used pecans instead of almonds, added some prosciutto, and made my own pomegranate honey vinaigrette.  Just melt about a teaspoon of raw organic honey, add a tablespoon of your favorite balsamic vinegar (I used pomegranate) and a little EVOO.  Stir and pour.  It's delicious!!

This is a very good salad and a nice change from the ordinary.  Loved the combination of the fresh peaches with the asiago and the almonds.  YUM!  My only change was to use romaine in lieu of the spinach, only because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe, ellie!

The flavor combination of the spinach, almonds, cheese & ripe peaches, drizzled with a quality raspberry vinaigrette is perfection.  We loved this.

This salad makes me want to have a dinner party because it is definitely a high-end type of salad!  It was delicious!  I used Fresh Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site and used Trader Joe's Pecorino and Romano Parmesan Blend cheese.  Of course, it didn't hurt that the peaches were fresh and sweet!  We loved this combination!  I think I could even eat this for breakfast!
