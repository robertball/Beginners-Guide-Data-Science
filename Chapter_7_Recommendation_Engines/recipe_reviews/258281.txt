I have not yet made the recipe but I plan to; however, I would like to suggest a change to Step 2.  Cook the bacon in the cold skillet alone.  Set aside until the end.  Use the grease to saute the onion.  Proceed with the recipe.  Reason:  If you want the bacon to add color, flavor and crisp texture to the dish, fry it and sprinkle it over the top at the end.  If you cook it with the moist onion, it will not get crisp.
