I had some fresh turnips in my CSA basket (community supported agriculture) this week and wanted to cook them but not mash them. This was great. I used honey to sweeten them instead of white sugar and added onions. I will use this recipe again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't know what to do with my CSA turnips and decided on this one after reading the reviews.   I used chicken broth instead of water & bouillion.  I had more turnips so I used a full can of broth.  I added onions as suggested.  Next time I may try the brown sugar or honey, but it was excellent as it is.

This really is fabulous. I love turnips even raw, but my husband is the pickiest eater on the planet and we were fighting over who got the last helping! I did replace the white sugar with brown sugar in my recipe, and I probably only used about 1 1/2 tbsp of it, but we are not sugar people and I use less sugar in every recipe. Really fabulous. SO easy and different. Can't wait to make it again and my husband can't wait either! Thanks so much!

This recipe is a no-brainer and very tasty.  I made it with brown sugar and hubby and I thought it was delish!  He kept walking through the kitchen while it was cooking, commenting on how good it smelled.  He had two helpings and then went back to clean out the pan.   I think this recipe would work equally well with rutabegas too.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it provided me a way to eat some of the turnips in my garden without gagging! Very good. Very easy.

This is such an easy recipe, I have given it out while checking out at the grocery.  You wouldn't believe the positive response I've received to this recipe.  My adult daughter who usually turns her nose up to turnips love it. I am thinking of adding carrots for the color next time.

I used 1 rutabaga and 1 turnip.  I also made it a vegetarian dish by using vegetable boullion.  This recipe is a wonderful alternative to roasting and not having to heat up the whole house.

Excellent recipe. I used beef bullion as opposed to chicken bullion for a bit of a richer flavor. Also, 1/4 c water seemed a bit too little, so I increased it to 1/2 c. The end result was dynamite.  Will *definitely* use this recipe again!

I hate turnips, but got some from my CSA. Instead of giving them away - of letting them rot with the best of intentions of getting around to cooking them - I actually found this recipe and tried it. I can't say I love them, but they are perfectly edible! IF it can make me eat them, trust me, it's a hit.

These were pretty good - trying to eat more veggies and this is a good way to have turnips. Make sure you use a big enough pan because the first time I made this, I used too small of a pan and they never caramelized.

A pleasant surprise.  My cooking usually is awful, but following this recipe for my CSA (farm share) turnips gave me confidence that I am capable of creating decent food.

This is fantastic! Be sure to pick turnips on the small to medium size....large ones can be woody.

A good way to get picky people to eat them. I added more butter and next time I'll use brown sugar.

I think my three year old's response to this dish captures the spirit of most of the reviews I have read.  When I told him they were caramelized turnips, he wrinkled up his little face and said "I don't like turnips."  When I made him try one bite, he made a sour face when the spoon went in his mouth. Then about two seconds later, his face changed and he said "Hey, I like turnips."  That's how I feel about caramelized turnips too.  I should also note that I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  This is a great, simple recipe that I will be making again.

This was very good.  I was given some turnips today and I didn't know what to do with them.  I have only used turnips in soups and roasted root vegetables.  So I turned to Allrecipes as I always do and found this recipe.  I did add onions as other suggested and only used one tablespoon of brown sugar.  My husband said he liked them better than he thought he would.  I will be making this again.  I also liked the fact that it was low in calories.  Thanks for sharing this.

Fantastic!  Doubled the recipe and used brown sugar substitute and light Blue Bonnet.....great for Weight Watchers.  Only 2 points for the whole recipe. Sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on it to give it a kick and it was so good. You have to try this recipe!

Utterly Fantastic!  However, we cheated and substituted in one crucial ingredient....  We were inspired by both this recipe and the Glazed Fall Root recipe.  We wanted the simplicity of one root, but incorporated balsamic vinegar from that recipe, at which point, we didn't think we needed the chicken broth.  The result, less water, and more of a stir fry.... and....?  Wow!  This is now our family's favorite way to prepare turnips.  We like the Turnip Casserole, we even like Turnips as oven fries with things like Bratwurst sandwiches, and they are fine mixed in with mashed potatoes, sadly I'm the only one in the house who likes turnips more than celery with our favorite cranberry dipping sauce - but I adore turnips that way too..... ,  .... oh, and the all around benefit of including turnips in stews goes without saying, but by far, this recipe, with the addition of balsamic vinegar, is TOPS in our home!!!  Thanks for posting!

Awesome turnips!! I've only had turnips raw or in soup, and have been looking to find an interesting way to prepare them as a veggie side dish - this is it! I used chicken stock, because I had it on hand, and used 1 Tablespoon brown sugar instead of 2 Tablespoons white – just a preference. Prepared them as instructed, and they disappeared almost as fast as the dish was set on the table! I also have made them with some chunky diced onion, and we love them prepared both ways. People who said they didn’t like turnips, and were smart enough to try these have now changed their minds. This is a keeper of a recipe!

Yum! I've never had a turnip before (I know, strange), so I thought I would try this as a "safe bet." Amazing! I'm so excited to try other things, but I know this will be a standout recipe for us. The only problem I had was getting the turnips to color; by the time they had any color they had cooked to such a soft consistancy they were difficult to stir. I'll probably try to just caramelize them from the beginning and forgo the simmering first.

This was so yummy, and I love how it didn't require a lot of ingredients. I used a beef bouillon cube since I didn't have chicken and used sucralose (e.g. Splenda) for the sugar. I made a double batch and threw in 1/4 cup cooked quinoa, which added a nice nuttiness.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  We loved it!  It was very simple to make.  I coated my skillet with canola spray before making it to make sure nothing would stick.  Not sure if that was necessary or not, but my pan was not a mess, so I just thought I'd mention it.

I had no idea what to do with some turnips a guy from church gave us...I had heard turnip horror stories, and I have five picky kids.  This recipe was a dream to make, very easy - and they turned out sweet and delicious!  We are having them for a late THanksgiving dinner.  I did sub chicken broth for the water/boullion, but otherwise made as directed.

Absolutely delicious recipe. :) I'll be making this one again for sure. It should probably be noted, on my part, that I had no chicken bouillon at the time, so I used beef bouillon instead. But it turned out extremely tasty. Thanks for sharing this!

Didn't think I liked turnips very much, but I could eat these every day! Followed directions exactly and came out great! I think onions would add good flavor too.

This was good. I think I cooked it too long because I wasn't expecting it to get tender so fast and it become mushy. Next time I will watch it closer and maybe add onion too.

I had never really tried turnips before, except as a murky ingredient in soups or stews.  My husband and I really enjoyed them prepared this way.  We had about 2 - 2 1/2 cups of turnips.  I did not cover the turnips when they were simmering, and had to add a little more water (next time, I will simmer with a lid on the pan).  We kept the proportions for the butter and brown sugar, which did not really turn into a glaze, but just lightly coated the turnips.  I thought the sweetness was a great compliment to the earthy flavor of the turnips.   I will definitely make these again.

maybe I did something wrong, but I thought the turnips were great by themselves, and not good in this recipe.  NEVER DO AGAIN

We got a ton of turnips in our weekly CSA basket and decided to give this recipe a whirl.  It was great! The little bit of left overs heated up well in the toaster oven the next day, too.

Delicious! I had some turnip greens that I chopped up and put in with the turnips at the beginning, and then also added a diced pear toward the end, but I don't know that that made any difference. I've managed to eat turnips before, but this is the first time I've really enjoyed it!

These were not to our liking. They needed more water not to burn and they were too sweet. Sorry!

I bought a turnip for the first time in 33 years of marriage!  We thought we should try something different.  This recipe is great.  We loved our turnips!  This was a delicious side dish that we will definitely enjoy again.

A vegetarian friend who disliked turnips really liked these. I didn't use the chicken bouillon cube, just plain water, and added a bit more butter plus salt.

The technique was great for bringing a great texture and moderating the bitterness of the turnips, but it was just too sweet for us. (I make desserts that are less sugary...) 

I did modify it quite a bit, instead of adding all that sugar I added just a little as well as cumin, garlic powder and black pepper and it was awesome!

A yummy twist to turnip.  However I added the onion as others suggested and cannot imagine there being enough flavour without it.  I also needed to add 10 minutes to the cooking time although my pieces were very small.  I accidentallyy  went overboard with the sugar and it was very sweet.  I would not recommend increasing the amount of sugar.

not sure what went wrong here, but this recipe did not work for me at all.  I had to add broth multiple times and it still kept cooking dry and ended up burning without the turnips ever getting tender.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Very disappointed.

I printed this recipe in 2012, and have made it about 20 times in 6 years. It's the recipe I make to blow my friend's mind when they grimmace at the word turnip. I've had the BEST results when I use my homemade chicken stock, but stay true to the measurment of 1/4 cup!

Oh My Gosssshhhh! This recipe was so simple and extremely delicious. I took the turnips straight from my organic garden and into the kitchen. I made turnips for my wife and my two picky children.  We all fought over the scraps. First time ever eating turnips for all of us, too.

This was very good.  Make sure you use small turnips, because the bigger ones maintain a bitter taste.

I fixed this tonight and my husband and I argued about who got the last bit! Only change I made was I cooked the turnips in beef broth that I made because I'm allergic to most broths and bouillon cubes that are on the market. Tasted great and we will be making it many times from here on out.

These were fantastic! Had some turnips in my CSA box and thought I'd try my hand at cooking them for the first time. I'm so glad I tried this recipe instead of hiding them away in a soup! I substituted brown sugar for the white, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. So good. I will be trying this for other root veggies and may add onion next time. Thanks to Lynn for sharing the recipe!

This was my first attempt at turnips and a total flop.  I followed the directions and even added onion and used brown sugar as suggested by others.  They never caramelized and just ended up mushy.  On top of the bad consistancy, they had a total lack of flavor.  I won't try turnips again.

Delicious!  I had to add another 1/4 cup water after the first evaporated because the turnips still weren't tender, but I'm guessing that will depend upon your turnips and how small you cut them.  Will definitely be making this again, I have never liked turnips before, but had to get rid of some.  I'm glad I did, I really liked them cooked this way.

I also used fresh CSA turnips.  I barely had enough for 1 cup and I substituted brown sugar instead of white.  My husband LOVED this. I have to admit that neither of my kids or myself liked this dish. However I only like turnips in stews.  But it was good to try something different.

These turned out great! I received turnips in my CSA share and decided to try this recipe out. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added thinly sliced onions and bacon, and substituted honey for the sugar. Also I used chicken broth instead of the water/chicken bouillon.  Even my kids ate these which means I'll make them again!

Good - but a bit sweet for me.  Added a touch of sea salt and lots of coarse black pepper to spice it up a touch.

Very simple straightforward flavor - just sweet. Still good, though, if you have turnips to get through.

Really enjoyed this dish.  I too used beef broth and added a pinch of Rosemary as it was to accompany a Beef Daube. The flavour was a wonderful accompaniment to the slightly orange flavour of the beef dish. It was easy to prepare and I will definitely make this again

I made it with half a large chicken bouillon.  I tried a bit of it without adding the sugar and butter and I thought it was delicious without them.  It did take much longer to boil the pieces so that they were soft though.  I cooked them for at least 30 minutes.

Excellent!! I meant to take a picture, but unfortunately they disappeared too quickly. It certainly made converts of one or two persons who had previously said that they would never eat a turnip.

Great way to serve up turnips! I've made these a few times now and here's what I'd recommend: 1) use brown sugar, instead of white, 2) cook in a steel or cast iron pan to get that crusty goodness while it cooks, and 3) make a little extra because it's going to go fast. BTW, when you cook these up in cast iron or carbon steel, use a bit of oil or butter to prep the pan before adding the turnips.

Tried as written. AMAZING. Suggestion -would go easier on chicken stock. & cook a bit less to retain more texture. Regardless, we still, gobbled up all of it! Great recipe!! Will make again.

I'll definitely make this again, but give it a taste before adding sugar. The turnips were plenty sweet on their own, in my opinion. My hubby has a sweet tooth so he didn't mind the added sweetness.

This was perfect for us.  Very quick and easy.  I added a couple carrots for color (and because I love them!) and after simmering the turnips and carrots, poured off the liquid, moved veg over to the side and sauted a little onion and garlic in butter before stirring all together and drizzling with honey.  Def do-over.   Thank you for the recipe!

I've never had turnips before, and was looking for a recipe that wasn't just "throw them in some soup", something my kids and husband would actually enjoy.... this definitely did the trick!!

I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I browned some boneless pork ribs in olive oil in my pan, removed the ribs and added 1/2 cup of water, then stirred up all the cooked bits from the bottom to make a pork "stock" (you could also do this with chicken or beef!).  I added the turnips, covered them, and cooked over medium-low heat 10 minutes, then followed the recipe as it's written-
 Cooked another 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until turnips were very tender and water was gone, then added butter and sugar and cooked another 10 minutes until they were nicely caramelized, and no longer bitter.... my kids ate an entire plate of turnips!!!!  

Will definitely be making again :)

Holy  this makes WOW from"meh",  I've always thought turnips to be just okay until now.  I've now made this twice in 2 weeks now,   both times using baby turnips quartered with a little more liquid to help cook more evenly.

This was my first time trying a turnip.  The recipe was a little frustrating.  1/4 C water plus 15 minutes sauteeing in the skillet did not make the tiny cubes of turnip turn tender.  I think I spent 45 minutes adding more water and cooking them to get them tender and then went ahead with the butter and sugar.  I do wish they would have turned out more tender but they were good.

Not a turnip fan but New Year, new things. I used a little less white sugar but also added a pinch of brown sugar and 1 large carrot.  They were amazingly good.  My teens went back for seconds and my husband (meat & potato man), actually finished the serving I gave him and declared them "pretty good!" (A huge compliment from him.)  Will definitely share and make again! Thank you!

This was really, really good! As an adult I have really grown to appreciate turnips, (as a child not so much, the sometimes bitterness put me off) but these were really  great! I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 onion chopped. the adults in my household all loved it , the teenager wouldn't touch it, (he doesn't like to try new things) I am not sure I really need to boil the turnips first, next time I'm going to try just sauteing them from the start. This replaces my stirfried turnips apples and cabbage as my favorite turnip dish! Thank you all!

Made this in place of my spicy glazed carrot dish just for a change on Thanksgiving and it was gone in a flash. My, now adult, children couldn't get enough and I will add this to my Christmas feast. I used clover honey instead of sugar and added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a bit of zing...it's a big winner at dinner!

Outstanding! Made with beef broth and used double than what the recipe calls for so turnips could cook down longer and soften more. Even people who thought they didn't like turnips loved the dish.

Delicious with Thanksgiving Dinner this year.  I diced the turnips and added carrots in the same size dice.  I only sprinkled it with sugar--probably not even 1/2 t.  Everyone loved the dish.

Never ate a turnip in my life until I tried this recipe and I have never left a review until today. I followed the recipe exactly and found that I needed way more water than the recipe called for (just kept adding water as needed to keep the process moving) in order to make the turnips tender and I used brown sugar in lieu of the white. The turnips also took longer to cook than stated, but that could just have been me being cautious. With that said, my husband and I adored the result.  Will definitely be making this again as an alternative to potatoes and I will probably branch out and add carrots as others have suggested for color and onions just because we love them.  Thank you Lynn for a terrific recipe! My family and I are now turnips fans.... who knew! Can't wait to try them mashed!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  Like so many others, I got turnips in my Bounty Box (local growers) and had no idea what to do with them.  I only had really negative memories of boiled turnips from my childhood.  I used beef broth, added onions and some fresh ginger.  I also went a little scant on the sugar and used brown sugar instead of white.  I took them to church for potluck in my electric skillet and they were GONE!  I'll have to make them again for my husband...he didn't get any.  I soaked the diced turnips for a little while in salt water (15-20 minutes) and made sure I peeled them before dicing them up.  There was no bitter taste at all and some of my turnips were pretty large.  Yummy!  I encourage you to try them; I'll definitely make this again.

I've never really liked turnips, but I wanted to get more vegetables into the family meals.  I found this recipe, and we all really enjoyed it.  The only thing I changed was to use some chicken broth instead of boullion to cut back on salt.

My turnip nay-sayers were amazed!  This was excellent. I used chicken broth and then added water as needed to make the turnip tender.  Then I used butter and brown sugar.  It was amazing.

I'll admit, I haven't made a lot of dishes with turnips in my life.  I was excited to try this though... as I had a lot of turnips in my CSA basket.  These were way too bitter for me and the caramel smelled nice, but didn't seem to help the flavor.  I will not be making these again.

Found the turnips got very tender, almost mushy. Probably cooked them a little too long. I'd cut the sugar in this recipe, but did not wait for them to carmelize. Thought adding onion would be good. Very tasty!

We hadn't ever done turnips but received them in our produce co-op.  This recipe was delicious!  Great wintery side.

Great recipe:) Added 4 stripes of cooked bacon to enhance the flavor, 1 cup of water and brown sugar.

Like others, we had a bumper crop of turnips from the CSA and wondered how to get the kids to eat them. This recipe was super easy and a big hit!

We're not turnip fans as it is. Got some in our CSA box, so we tried this recipe. It's ok. I think it's more that we don't like turnips than the fault of the recipe!

Yum!  You won't believe how good this is...it doesn't even taste like turnips!  A great way to use up a lot of produce from the garden.

This was quite good. The first few bites were great . . . by the time I cleared my plate, though, I'd grown just a tad bored of it. I will likely make this again, but certainly not as often and as enthusiastically as I'll make the kashmiri-style kidney beans from this site!
