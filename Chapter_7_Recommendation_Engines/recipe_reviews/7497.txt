My grandparents live in Vienna,  and i've spent summers there my entire life. This is not the sachertorte i have enjoyed at the Hotel Sacher on countless occasions. This recipe is too moist, not like the famed- whichever you take that to be. This cake tasted somewhat like a box mix- the flavors were not as deep to me, probably a result of the quality of chocolate in the States versus Wien. If you use the whipped cream, as is tradition, do not sweeten it, it overpowers the chocolate. The cake is not meant to taste like a Hershey bar as many Americans like. The difference is, desserts are on a completely different level in Austria. Pastry and sweets are time-honored, proud traditions- usually unchanged for centuries. On the up side, i imagine this would be a nice deviation from a simple cake, possibly for a birthday. I suppose i will simply have my Omi ship them to me in the States.

My husband has been begging me to make this torte since he went to Vienna and had the real thing. It came out nicely,  though not exactly the same. A nice cake for company nontheless. The coffee is a nice addition into the frosting - not too strong,  as I was afraid it would be.

this sachertorte was excellent.  In Vienna I went to the Sacher hotel to try Sachertorte.  It was dry and uninteresting.  My sister later went to Vienna and tried 3 tortes, also dry.  This tasted like I expected one to taste.  It was very moist even a week later a small piece refrigerated was still moist.  The frosting is delicious  thanyou.

I liked this recipe, the torte was moist and tasty.  However I found the icing too sweet.  I had a hard time cutting the cake in half, but that might be my technique - someone told me that a thread works best to cut it in half but that did not work for me.  The cake cooked in 30 minutes for me, but my oven is weird (even with an oven thermometer) so I won't blame the recipe.  It also shrank from the sides of the pan, and I was worried that it might be too dry - it wasn't.
I used saskatoon/raspberry jam instead of apricot, because I didn't think I would like apricot.

The frosting is what makes this cake. You can substitute a bit of coffee liqueuer, 1 to 2 tablespoons (whatever it takes to making spreading consistency) for the coffee. Cake is nice with a dollop of whipped cream on it. Bites without frosting or whipped cream are just average. I usually go for deeper chocolate flavor. Don't freak out at the crackled crust on top when you pull it out of oven... icing covers it.

Very good. I had made a similar recipe before but it wasn't as good. (I didn't include the coffee.)

I'll have to confess that with this cake I start with a dark chocolate cake mix made in 2 round cake pans. I follow the chocolate icing and filling mix to the tee.  After taking the cake out of the 2 round cake pans I slice off the top to even it out.  Fill and make the frosting to pour over it.  I've done it this way for years - ALL who eat this RAVE about it.  It's the filling and the frosting that "make" this cake.  It's to die for.  My family calls it "THE" cake and make requests for it. I've made it for many a family and social gathering...it's always a hit.  Sorry I cheat, but time is short and this tastes like or better than a completey homemade cake...much easier and it NEVER fails!  Very moist and absolutely to die for!!  Chocolate lovers you won't be disappointed!!

This torte was excellent.  I cooked the icing for about 10 minutes over the double boiler and the texture was perfect.  I pureed low-sugar apricot preserves in the blender, which also worked well.  The only difference I could tell from the real Austrian torte was the color of the cake.  This was much lighter in color than the one we had in Salzburg.

I don't think this can technically be called a Sachertorte.  Although it's original recipe is kept under as much lock and key as the Coca Cola formula, there are certain key ingredients. An apricot glaze and unsweetened cream are the two ingredients that differentiate this from just a typical chocolate cake. I enjoyed the fact that this recipe was easy to make but at the end, it was not impressive nor was it what I expected.

Attempting to bake this cake was quite a humbling experience.  After failing with the Sachertorte Icing and having the cake portion end up crumbly I decided to just find one online. Word to the wise... save yourself the difficultly that I experienced and check out Caroline's Cakes.  I actually saw her on the Food Network while looking up videos on exactly how to bake this cake.

After watching the Food Network’s Kid’s Baking Championship, my tween daughter was inspired to make a sachertorte like the contestant, Matthew. This recipe offered a lot of opportunity for her to learn some technical skills needed for baking like creaming, melting chocolate properly, fluffing egg whites, and folding in egg whites. We had a great time baking it and an even better time eating this sachertorte. We used dark chocolate chips instead of the squares of semisweet chocolate, simply because it was in the pantry. In addition, we omitted the apricot filling (we are not sachertorte purists…yet). My three girls all loved the sachertorte and nearly licked their plates clean. Not knowing if it tastes authentic, I gave it four stars. My tween daughter wants to make French macaroons and eclairs next, just like the kids on the show!

I made this for a cooking class as well as for my mother's birthday and feel I'd like it more if the cake itself was sweeter and more moist. I substituted raspberry sauce for the apricot preserves and lessened the amount of coffee right off the bat but found the cake was rather dry and bitter. With sufficient variations, this sachertorte could be splendid.
