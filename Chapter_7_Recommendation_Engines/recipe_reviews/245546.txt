This is my recipe. Thank you for the rave reviews! To the people who found it lacking flavor please use STOCK not broth. It makes a huge difference because stock was chicken bones cooked with veggies and herbs. Broth is just chicken bones boiled in water and salt. You found it nearly tasteless because you used broth. I make this without added salt, pepper, herbs, or spices in order to use different flavors for different recipes. This is only your base - experiment and change it up however you like!

It works! This is way too easy. It only needed about 3 minutes to thicken up so keep your eye on it. Thank you for the recipe.

This is Fantastic!! My daughter has celiacs disease and this recipe has allowed our family  enjoy comfort foods that have been missing in our GF diet. One suggestion is to use beef bullion instead of regular chx broth, the flavor is so much fuller! Super easy and great texture and taste.

I can believe how simple this was. I was making a casserole that called for cream of chicken soup. Normally I would have made it for my family and I wouldn't eat it because I'm gluten free. I whipped this up and added it I got to enjoy it with my family. I used two bullion cubes and water instead of stock. I only had 1% milk and it still turned out great! Thanks!

Love, love, love this recipe!  Finally have a base that can be used with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, etc.  how wonderful to be rid of chemical/preservative filled canned soups.  Always have these staples on the shelves - gluten free.  Yay!!!!

I made this to add to my chicken divan recipe.  Great substitute and flexible enough to add whatever you like to add more flavor.  Definitely use stock--it's much more flavorful.

This is really good. I used the stock and I added 1 tsp. of the Better Than Bouillon chicken soup base  to give it more flavor, and that made it even better! Very quick and easy and in casseroles it works really well.

I usedHodgson Mill potatoes starch instead of cornstarch. I only used 2 tbsp. I had to add a little more milk because it was too thick. I also added crushed rosemary and thyme for left over turkey for shredded turkey sandwiches. Potatoes starch thickens quick on lower heat.

Great recipe. The changes I made are using extra broth, then cook it down in order to get more flavor and I use arrowroot in place of the cornstarch. This would also be fine with almond milk instead of dairy. A touch of garlic is good too.
Thank you for your recipe.

I'll make it again; this was so easy! Keep stirring as it's thickening or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. My homemade chicken stock means that I know exactly what goes in this recipe.

I was very impressed with this recipe...I needed a gluten-free version for my instant pot recipe and it turned out wonderful!  I also used the basic portion of the recipe to make a cream of celery version for green bean casserole (for a mushroom allergic guest).  Amazing!

Huge fan of the simplicity of this. I've used other stocks, 2% and 0% milk, as well as adding onions, garlic, and seasoning at the start and ALL of it has turned out great. 

One of my favorite ways to take this to the next level is using Penzey's Fox Point seasoning w/ the chicken stock.

WAY too much cornstarch. Sets up like concrete if used in a recipe. I ruined two huge trays of green bean casserole with this recipe. Try using only two Tbsp. of cornstarch.

This is a great replacement for most recipes that call for Cream of Chicken, Cream of Celery or Cream of Mushroom Soups.  What I'm really enjoying about this recipe is my ability to add as much chicken as I want, depending on what I'm going to use the soup for.   This is a great soup recipe, quick and easy, tastes wonderful,  and has become a great comfort food.

I made a chicken stock from the caracas of a rotisserie chicken and it came out very bland. I added some bullion granules and it added just the right amount of flavor. Thanks for a GF replacer!

I didn't have whole milk so I used half and half and 2% milk.
I also didn't have chicken stock so I used vegetable broth and added a chicken bullion cube. I doubled this for a my GF son's favorite chicken casserole and he said it tasted really good.

This was awesome. I have 1 child with celiac and another child with a true allergy (epi-pen!) reaction to wheat. This recipe is such a blessing to our family. I can substitute it in some of our favorite comfort casserole dishes. Thank you so much!!

I made this recipe just as it states with chicken stock. It was beyond bland. It just tasted heavily of just cornstarch, but I read the comments and made homemade poultry seasoning and it completely fixed the taste. It was amazing in a casserole after the alteration.

Tasted like milk and cornstarch. Added salt pepper and chicken bouillon and it was OK. I did start with my own homemade chicken stock but that didn't matter. I think I'll do 2 cubes next time.

This is  just what I've been looking for to replace canned cream of chicken soup. It is also a great base for creating your own version of other soups. Since we are gluten free, this is a life saver. If you only have chicken broth on hand, you can add a tablespoon of gf chicken bullion for extra flavor.

My daughter can't have gluten so I was excited to try this recipe as a replacement in my cooking. The texture and color were perfect, however I felt that it had very little flavor.

Easy to make. I did add a pinch of salt and 1/8 tsp of garlic powder as I was cooking. I used the Cream of chicken in my Chicken enchiladas. It tasted wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly. It took much longer for me because I think I had the heat too low, but the finished product was great and it couldn't have been easier!
