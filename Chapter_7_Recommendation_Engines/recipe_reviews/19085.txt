I threw in some chopped glace cherries as well, and did not have lemon essence so just grated some lemon rind. The guys at work thought it was a nice normal cake for a change instead of the chocolate or rich cakes that I usually take in.

Pretty good.  I made this cake for my neighbor, whose bday is tomorrow.  I know she likes lemon pound cakes so I thought I would try this for her.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I didn't frost it bc I didn't want it to be too messy, but it's nice even without frosting.  She really seemed to enjoy it.  It is a bit dry, but maybe some sour cream or something would address that.  She said she would have some for breakfast tomorrow with coffee; it is a bit like a breakfast coffee cake, so it's a hit.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

I baked this cake following the recipe. I just added a bit more milk than it said and a few more drops of lemon extract b/c I could tase the flavor of the uncooked flour. Still, the recipe was amazing!!!

Cut sugar down to 1 1/4 cup and it was still sweet enough. Used 1 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 Cup of milk instead of the milk and water. It wasnâ€™t dry and tasted really good. Will def make again!

I made this. It was so tasty and the texture is perfect. I just added 1 tbsp of cinnamon to it since I like the mixed taste of cinnamon and raisin and used less sugar.

This was so easy and turned out great. I made it with soy milk and fake butter since we have a dairy allergy in the family and it worked just fine that way.
