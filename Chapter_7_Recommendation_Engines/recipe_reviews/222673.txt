Nice change from traditional tomato salsa.  From an eye appeal perspective, I think the salsa would benefit from not peeling the red apple giving that little pop of red to a very neutral colored salsa.  The recipe didn't say to seed the cuke, but I did.  We had this with tortilla chips, but I think this would be a really nice topping for either grilled chicken or fish.  Nice balance of sweet and sour with the orange and lime juices, as well as with the fresh fruit and the heat of the jalape√±o.  Thanks Grill Master Jay for a nice new salsa recipe.
