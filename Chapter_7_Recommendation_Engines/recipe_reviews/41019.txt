My Bunko group flipped when I brought this!  I used the goat cheese.  I blend everything in my food processor.  Do not omit the basil garnish - it is pretty and really does add flavor. You can also spice up this treat by using flavored breads from your local grocery store.

This recipe is delicious, but I added some chopped fresh rosemary for yet another flavor, and it was a wonderful addition.
