This recipe was popular with the family (i.e. not too spicy) and easy to make.  The chicken came out tasting moist, not that over cooked dry taste I have had from other chicken crock pot recipes.

I'm glad someone posted about the rice clumping.  I made sure I stirred it well.  It wasn't a problem.

I was skeptical about putting rice in the crock pot.  The results were not good.  The rice came out mushy and in some areas, clumps formed which were hard and not edible.  I will not be making this recipe again.

From previous experience I would not cook rice in the slow cooker. Cook the rice with the chicken broth in a separate pot or rice cooker about 30-40 minutes before the crockpot chicken is done. Just put the remaining ingredients in the crockpot and cook. Then serve over the rice. You will not have lumpy,mushy, or crunchy rice.

This is definitely easy but rice just isn't friendly in my slow cooker, ends up overcooked & mushy. I may try to alter this a bit and serve it over rice instead.

Does not look anything like the picture.

The rice never cooked and was very crunchy so I had to leave it in longer which made the entire dish mushy. I was really looking forward to trying it out but was disappointed with the result. I have had the dish in the crock-pot for over the 3 hours and 20 minute suggested time, on high.

This was delicious.  You could eat in inside a tortilla too.  We actually used it as a dip with tortilla chips.  This makes it very kids friendly.  All 4 of my kids loved it!

My family loved this recipe.  Even my pickiest eater cleared her plate.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of two and I used light red kidney beans instead of black beans.  I served it in a burrito shell and added sour cream, cheese and salsa.  It was delicious.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe was great in my rice cooker/food steamer!! I put the rice, chicken broth, salsa (used about 1 1/2 cups), chopped up onion & 1/2 of the taco seasoning in the main part of the rice cooker, and then put the taco seasoned chicken in the steamer tray of the rice cooker - I didn't have chilies so they weren't added, and I also added a little more chicken - it was delicious!! I've never tried cooking rice in the slow cooker so I'm not sure how that turns out, but the whole meal in the rice cooker took about 40 mins so I didn't have to wait 3 hours to eat :)  I also added some mild cheddar cheese & sour cream - It was moist & so yummy in a fajita shell too - I will definitely make this again!

Just a note to say that the problem people had with the rice being undercooked was probably because they used regular rice.  This recipe calls for converted rice which is quite different than regular rice.  If they were using Minute Rice, that's the reason for mushy rice.  I think Uncle Ben's is the only converted rice producer, not the rice mixes though, look for "converted rice".

I also used 3 breasts instead of 2. I omitted the green peppers to make it more kid friendly but to no avail. By itself, this is not very appetizing. It was okay served like nachos but I think I will try to make burritos with the leftovers.

I experimented. Quinoa instead of rice. Salsa Verde instead of red salsa. Sofrito instead of taco seasoning.

I expected it to be more aromatic, yet don't know how to make it that.  The taste was underwhelming at first, but the after taste was satisfying. 

I can't wait to do it again, and make it better.

So Yummy!! Rice was a little mushy but we wrapped it in tortillas and you couldn't tell.  We also topped with some cheese and sour cream.  Will definitely be making this again and again!!!

I used 3 breasts instead of 2. I didn't have a 24 oz jar of salsa, so I used a 16 oz mild and 8 oz of hot salsa - didn't use the green chiles.  I used the converted rice and stirred it every hour after reading other comments. It smelled great the last hour! My husband and I loved it. It's a keeper!

Easy to tailor recipe to spicy/non-spicy preferences. Four chicken breasts were moist and the rice was a great consistency. I plated with shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled tortilla chips on top. Everyone loved it!

Wish I could do 3.5 stars. Recipe came out okay, a bit bland for my personal tastes but I would make it again with tweaks. I like my Mexican food spicy so I think I would add hotter salsa and maybe increase the taco seasoning. I used parboiled rice in the slow cooker and it worked fine. Served it over chips with cheese and sour cream and was satisfied enough that I'll make it again if the ingredients pile up. One caution - this recipe yields a lot and it's a heavy meal. We (2 people) had more leftovers than anticipated and weren't able to finish them all before their fridge-life ended. I did get a lot of mileage by buying some tortillas and making lunch quesadillas a few times.

Good recipe, I added l another breast so it's packed with protein. Leave the rice out or cook separately , came out hard in the slow cooker, I did continue to stir it in order to keep from clumping. But very filling and does make a lot after you remove the breast and shred. Will make again, no more cooking this week except for breakfast.

Made this for a family dinner.  The rice turned out okay.  Had never used the converted/parboiled rice.  It work great was not mushy at all.  All the Kids when back for seconds.  I used 2lbs of chicken.  Had additional Salsa, cheese and sour cream as toppings.  Made a lot, the kids took some home for lunch the next day.

After reading reviews about the rice clumping....I did as one said "mix while it is cooking".  There was no problem with clumping with occasional mixing up the rice.  I shredded the chicken when it was done instead of cubing it.  Just make sure that the chicken is placed on the bottom so it cooks enuf to be shredded.  Also added so cayenne to give it a little kick.  Then some shredded cheddar cheese as a topper.  Yum Yum

As a relative novice cook, I tend to treat recipes like a scientific formula the first time I make them, so I made this exactly like the recipe called for.  I used Uncle Ben's converted rice, and it turned out like is was supposed to in the recipe.  I made a mistake and put in the black beans in the beginning, rather then at the end, but it still turned out okay.  We used it as filling for burritos, and it worked good for that!

The rice turned out so mushy. Very mild in flavor. Perhaps a second package of taco seasoning would help. I will probably not make this again.

This turned out great! Everyone loved it! I used 3 chicken breasts since it's how they are sold, and the whole packet of taco seasoning so it wasn't wasted. I'm thinking people with rice issues used instant rice. I prefer natural brown rice and used it in place of white with no issues.

I used chicken thighs instead of breast.  I left out the green chilis and black beans and used spicy Cochina refied beans instead.  Delicious!!!

This was great I actually ended up making a few modifications since I didn't quite have everything on hand.  I used 3 chicken breasts.  I added a can Rotel tomatoes (mild) since I don't like spicy stuff.  And also added a can of corn (undrained) and left out the onion too.  Still a big hit in my house.  I also didn't cook the rice in the slow cooker.  I ended doing that separately.

Rice was mushy and dry at the same time.  Chicken was dry and overcooked.  I threw the leftovers out.

I made this using only my dutch oven and cooked it on my stovetop. I browned the chicken and sautéed  some garlic and onion.  I used brown rice and some extra seasonings like crushed chili peppers and montreal chicken spice.  I also shredded some aged cheddar cheese through it at the end.  Will definitely be making this again.
