There are a couple cornbread recipes on this site that I really like.  This one intrigued me because of the cranberries, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Made this recipe exactly as written and was a little disappointed with the taste and texture.  I found this drier and less moist (and I didn't overcook) than my favorite corn breads, and quite honestly, I was expecting more of a punch from the fresh cranberries.  This is by no means a bad recipe, just for my own personal preference, it was a bit of letdown.

This is a sligtly moist soft cornbread. I love the added flavor of the cranberries. It is a mildly sweet flavor, great texture.  I will probably be making this again. It would be great for the holidays too.

This one is unbelievable! I used dry cranberries, cut the sugar in half (we don't like sweet food) and my son couldn't stop eating! Big success by friends too!

Ultimately a keeper and next time it will probably be a 5 Star.  Followed the recipe along with suggestions from other reviewers to be sure to keep the cranberries in sugar to avoid turning green.  Worked great.  My issue was cooking time.  after 20 minutes it was still REALLY raw in the middle.  Lowered the temperature and ended up cooking for about an hour total.  Still - flavor was GREAT and I'll definitely be giving it another try.

Super-tasty, but the cranberries turn the surrounding cornbread green, which is less than appetizing.

I made the recipe as is, except I used cashew milk in place of regular milk. It came out great, although my personal preference would be to have it a little sweeter so next time I may add a little more sugar.

Perfection... I served it with my homemade chilli. The cranberries worked well with the chilli taste. This cornbread works well "lathered" with butter or at the bottom of the bowl covered with chilli.
Thank you!

I found it a bit bland, as I prefer a richer corn flavour .
I subbed Splenda for the sugar but that shouldnâ€™t have changed anything .

This cranberry cornbread is excellent with any hearty soup or Thanksgiving leftovers. I will definitely make it again. Suggest serving warm with butter or whipped cream cheese.

I used cornmeal from a Grist, so it made it very crunchy, a lot better than regular cornmeal.  Soaking the cranberries in sugar made it even sweeter.

Excellent! I didn't make  many changes except to double the cranberries and the corresponding T of sugar.  If you let the berries sit for at least 10 minutes in the sugar they won't stain the bread. I usually split it into 2 bread pans to avoid overbaking the edges with a raw center. 
Really good quick bread! I'm not sure how it keeps because we've never had any leftover.

09.26.16 ~ A nice twist on cranberry bread. I made this to go with a pot of spicy chili. The texture is a little drier than other cornbreads I've tried. I wonder if using buttermilk would give it a moister texture. I baked in a round cake pan as I wanted wedges rather then squares. All in all a nice recipe.

I really like the recipe. However, I baked it for 20 minutes and had it the next day for breakfast and it was still very doughy in the middle. I had to put it in the oven for another 15 minutes to get it done.
