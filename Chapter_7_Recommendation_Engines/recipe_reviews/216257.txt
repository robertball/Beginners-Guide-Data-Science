EXCELLENT! I wanted something different to do with our pumpkin seeds this year, and this recipe was perfect! I actually didn't measure the seeds, just used whatever was there, so I'm pretty sure that I used more than 3/4 cup. I did have to move the sugar/beer mixture to my bigger pot because once it started boiling, it seemed like it was gonna boil over. We LOVE the sweet and spicy flavors of this brittle. Thanks, sueb, for our new favorite way to enjoy pumpkin seeds...this is definately gonna be a new tradition! :)

I would definitely try this again with something other than pumpkin seeds.  They were very chewy and I didn't care for them.  I think this would be great with pecans or pine nuts.

Drink the beer and save your time for something else.  I made it just as printed, using a 3 qt. pan.  It boiled over so transferred to a 5 qt. pan. It came out dark brown and a strong spicy taste that my family did not like. Took 30 min. to clean it off my glass top stove.  I'd use a good peanut brittle recipe and substitue pumpkin seeds next time.

Made this with peanuts instead of pumpkin seeds and it was a great addition to the christmas spread.

Great flavor.  Didn't get it to press out very flat as it hardened quickly but it still tastes great.  Use a big pan as it did try to boil over several times.
