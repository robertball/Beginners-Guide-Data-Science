We Wisconsinites are known for our frozen custard, and we like it rich!  So instead of two eggs I used 1 egg and 3 egg yolks, and 1 T. of vanilla paste (has the little vanilla bean specks in it). Normally I temper the eggs separately as in traditional custards, but this method is a lot easier.  If you have a candy thermometer, getting the mixture to as close to 180 degrees, being careful NOT to let it come to a boil, will produce the creamiest ice cream, as will care in not over churning. Proportions of milk, cream or half and half can vary so much in vanilla ice cream recipes, and this one is perfect!

WOW! This is amazing! In the past, I have tried ice cream recipes, all of which have hardened once put in the freezer for storage. This recipe however, resulted in an ice cream which froze like any store bought ice cream, smooth and pliable. The flavor was also top notch! The only variation I made, was I added the seed of  one vanilla bean into the custard mixture, as well as the vanilla extract. Highly recommended!

Be careful while cooking this!  You don't want to get impatient and end up curdling the milk.  For best results, make sure you get the mixture really cold before processing it.  I used a Cuisinart ice cream freezer and it was ready at soft-serve consistency in 25 minutes.  I served this over "best brownies" which I found on this website.  It was a PERFECT combination.  Oh, and a brief note:  The high butterfat in this recipe tends to dull the vanilla flavor so don't be afraid to add extra vanilla.

I doubled this recipe to put in a 6 quart ice cream maker.  It was wonderful.  I also added blackberries.  If you add berries make sure to mash them up beforehand or else they'll freeze into hard individual berries.  The ice cream had a great texture and a nice custard flavor to it.  Everyone loved it.

I was looking for a good homemade vanilla ice cream that has cooked eggs in it, so I tried this one.  The custard only yielded about a quarter of the ice cream tin, so I had to add tons of milk/half-half to get it to the fill line.  I also put in 1/2 tsp. more of vanilla than the recipe stated and it still didn't have enough vanilla.  I will try this recipe again, but using 2 T. instead of 2 1/4 tsp. -

I made this recipe twice on Memorial Day to give my kids something fun to do in the kitchen.  The first time I followed it to the tee and it was GREAT!  The second time we decided to make Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream with it.  We used 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. mint extract, some green food coloring then added 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mixture half way through churning.  This also turned out wonderful.  My kids liked it so well that they said "I don't know why anyone buys ice cream at the store.  This is way better and really easy."  This also freezes like the really good ice cream (not hard as brick).  I think that says it all and it is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is the best ice cream ever.  We have made it numerous times this summer and it comes out great.  Store bought ice cream is blah compared to this.  We use pure vanilla (5 tps) and it has such great vanilla taste!  Everyone who has tried it has asked for the recipe.

Have made this recipe several times now and it has turned out perfect every time.  Very rich.  Definitely a high-end taste.  Only upgrade was to use vanilla paste (available from King Arthur Flour)in place of vanilla.  It contains the vanilla seeds for the little black specks.

My son's 18th birthday party is this weekend and I promised him that I would make homemade chocolate chip ice cream to go with his chocolate chip cake.  I was bored with the recipes in the booklet that came with my ice cream maker and they never tasted just right - always kind of grainy with a filmy aftertaste.  So I went looking for one to use today and this one takes the cake!  I modified it just a bit and doubled the recipe and here is what I used - **note this made a perfect 4 quart serving size!**  4 eggs, 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 tsp of salt, 4 cups of whipping cream, 2 cups of half and half, 2 cups of milk (I used 2%), 3 T vanilla, mini chocolate chips.  I started by taking the sugar and the eggs and creaming them until they were thick and gooey.  In a medium pan, I put all the milk and cream in and stirred it constantly.  Once it was hot, I added the vanilla and the egg/sugar mixture.  I continued cooking on medium heat about 15 minutes, still stirring constantly.  After about 15 minutes, it will start to thicken nicely and stick to the back of the spoon.  I pour my custard into a bowl and lined the top of the custard with plastic wrap before adding the lid.  Let it cool for a few hours in the fridge then popped it in my Rival and started churning!  I added the chocolate chips about halfway through the churning process.  It took a full 40 - 45 minutes but it was perfect when it came out! I felt like I was eating an ice cream sundae fresh off of the farm! Thank you so much

This is a very good recipe - the secret of which is getting really good vanilla. I recommend Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste. It's ll cost you, but it will be worth it. Check the amount of sweetness before you refrigerate, as you loose some of it during the freezing process. Also, I recommend a candy thermometer for temperature control - it is very easy after the 175-degree mark to burn the mixture, but you will need at least that temp to get it the right thickness. Refrigerate the mixture for at least 8 hours, the colder it goes into the ice cream maker, the smaller the ice crystals - the smoother the ice cream. Enjoy!

Oh my!  I could not believe how creamy this is!  Wonderful!  I used 4 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs and added an extra 1/2 cup sugar.  It is as close to Blue Bell as I've ever gotten!

This recipe came out perfectly, smooth and creamy.
 There are so many recipes on Allrecipes that don't require eggs, and people complain that the ice cream is hard/grainy. And that so many people don't realize is that it's the eggs that make the ice cream smooth and creamy like you like.
 This recipe is perfect as is.
 Also, if you want it to taste like Baskin Robins Vanilla use powdered sugar instead of regular.

AWESOME!!! I made this last night, refrigerated it overnight, and then put it in my Cuisinart ice cream maker today. I am a big custard fan, so I added an extra egg yolk. I don't have a candy thermometer, so I was a little nervous about watching for it to thicken up to the point of "coating the back of a metal spoon".  However, after about 45-60 minutes in my stainless steel saucepan, it suddenly thickened up and I just knew that it was ok. I stuck a metal spoon in the mixture and it coated it like wax from a melting candle! I read the reviews about the vanilla and decided to add a full tablespoon. I also added Hershey's Dark Chocolate syrup and Reese's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups. My husband and I thought we'd died and gone to ice cream heaven! The only thing is I may drop back the vanilla next time as it was a little bit too much for me with the dark chocolate. Also, I have a small Cuisinart so I may drop down the recipe to 9 servings, as 12 was overflowing once I added the peanut butter cups. Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe!
UPDATE: I just made a batch of mint chocolate chip Oreo. For a full batch: I still added the extra egg yolk. I chopped dark choc chips in the blender, crumbled about 15-17 Oreos, 1 tbsp vanilla, and added about 5-6 tsp on pure mint extract. Oh, and to make it green, about 25 drops of green food color. YUM YUM YUM!

I love the quick (no-double-boiler) method, but agree with others who mention cooking longer (180-185 degrees) for the best results. I was short 1/2 cup of heavy cream but went with the recipe anyways. Also, I used vanilla beans in place of the extract. Since it wasn't quite ready last night, I sampled it this morning (6am treat!) and loved how creamy and delicious this turned out! My bf prefers this recipe over some others I've tried, as it's not too custardy. --I stirred in some crushed oreos to half the batch...oooh what a treat!   (Note: this recipe is nearly identical to Vanilla Ice Cream I.)

This is such an easy, tasty vanilla ice cream recipe! Even though it is a cooked version, I found this to be very easy to make, and everyone loved it! I used this recipe as a base for homemade cookie dough ice cream and used the "Cookie Dough for Ice Cream (eggless)" recipe on this site. Although one recipe didn't make enough cookie dough for this ice cream recipe, the results were absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Simple recipe with great taste!  It was done perfectly after 30 minutes in the freezer (doubled recipe) . I put it in a container in the freezer and the next day it scooped like store bought! This is a keeper in our family.

This made a nice base for our cookie dough ice cream using the cookie dough for ice-cream recipe from this site.  I thought it tasted little too eggy on the first night but it was perfection the second night.  
I think the directions are missing the important step of tempering the egggswith the warm milk before adding them directly to the custard.  Other than that this is a keeper.

This is without a doubt the alltime best ice cream I have ever made - and I've made a lot of ice cream. After reading other reviews the only thing I did differently was to double the vanilla. In addition to the wonderful taste, the texture is perfection. This is my new ice cream recipe. I seriously doubt a better ice cream recipe can ever be found. Try it - you will NOT be disappointed.

This tasted good, but I will have to try this again.
The instructions for this was not detailed very well. Unless you've made ice cream before it's a little confusing.

This ice cream is unbelieveably good.  I recently cut Splenda (and therefore store-bought ice cream)out of my diet.  I made this using 1\3 cup plus 1 and 1\2 tablespoons Truvia instead of the sugar.  This is much better than the sugar-free ice creams from the store, and I highly recommend using Truvia in this recipe if you are looking for a healthy dessert.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I wouldn't call it ice cream ... it is more of a frozen custard.  But, whatever you want to call it, it is definitely a winning recipe.  Very simple to make, very rich and creamy.  Exactly what we were looking for.  So far this is our favorite recipe.  Thank you for sharing Mary!

My family and I did not like the taste of this ice cream.  Very eggy taste and smell.  Most of the people that have reviewed this and gave 5 stars has changed the recipe in some way.  We made exactly as stated.  Sorry not a good taste as is.  Very nice creamy texture.

made this in my old fashioned hand crank freezer and i will never buy ice cream again!  i did add about a quarter of a gallon of 2% milk though b/c my freezer is REALLY big and the recipe barely filled up the bottom!  it was still absolutely delish and i will make it probably every few days for my husband!

I just got an ice cream maker a few weeks ago and have been obsessed with trying different ice cream recipes every since.  Of the many I have tried back to back, this is hands down the best!  Wonderful creamy taste and texture.  I added extra vanilla to taste and it tastes like Blue Bell!  I recommend using this as a base for other flavors like cinnamon or chopping up candy and mixing it in!

I have been goofing around with my ice cream maker and this is my favorite recipe I have made so far! Served it with "Hot Fudge Sauce II" from this site, but I doubled the chocolate in that recipe. Cooking the custard took forever though! I had to stir it for 45 minutes! My boyfriend said it was worth it though!

We made this for the first time on July 4th. It was a huge hit! My 6 year old daughter said it was the best she had ever had, "even the professional kind". I did double the recipe as we have a 6 qt. freezer. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added more vanilla (1 Tbsp./recipe). Tip: DON'T ADD MILK OR ANY OTHER INGREDIENTS TO FILL LINE. I think this may be the problem others are having.

Awesome flavor!  I have been using the Ben and Jerry's recipe but this is actually better.  It comes out deliciously rich and creamy.  It did get icy after about a week but this is often the case with homemade ice cream.

This ice cream was delicious but I did make two minor changes (one of which was on purpose) - I used 1 vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract and I only let it set up in my fridge for a few hours before putting it into my ice cream maker.

I wanted to try the flavor of a vanilla bean since extract tends to make ice cream taste "store bought".  One bean didn't yield a very strong vanilla flavor, but that could be due to the fact that I needed the ice cream the same evening as I made the base.  Therefore, the base didn't sit as long as it probably should have to allow the flavors to meld and mellow.

The flavor and texture was so good after on a few short hours in the refrigerator that I can only imagine how wonderful they must be after allowing the base to sit overnight.  I'm looking foward to trying this recipe again!

I loved this recipe. very flavorful and creamy. I also loved the fact that the eggs were cooked and that you used the whole egg. I've gotten tired of stacking egg whites because of recipes that only use the yolk. this one is a keeper. I halfed the recipe, and used organic vanilla extract. For those living in France, I used Elle&vire creme Fleurette entiere (30 %) as the whipping cream and Elle&vire Fleurette 15% as the half and half cream. I cooked everything, let in cool then put in the fridge until cold then poured it in my ice cream maker. it was delicious.

Excellent recipe!!  The first time I made it I used vanilla beans in place of the extract, second time I added 2 tablespoons cocoa powder....it was amazing!!  This time I'm adding 1 tsp cinnamon and some puréed peaches...you can add anything to this basic vanilla recipe and make so many different flavors!  My family loves how creamy it is!!  :-)

This is the perfect recipe for vanilla ice cream.  We made two freezers for a family reunion. What a hit!  The little bit left over was frozen and eaten later, and it was just as creamy and delicious then.  Didn't get icy at all. Thanks, Mary, we're using this recipe again!

Loved this! I used only 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and the rest 1% organic milk. It was delicious. I also added fresh mashed peaches and the juice of one fresh lemon. I love what using a cooked custard does to the  taste of homemade ice cream. Wonderful!

This made the best ice cream! I have used this recipe twice, once adding strawberries and Oreo cookies. The 2nd time I increased the vanilla just a little and added pureed strawberries. Very creamy ice cream, this recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious.  My ice cream maker holds 1 1/2 quarts and this was just slightly too much custard for it to handle, so next time I will freeze it in halves.

Love, love, love this recipe! I double batch doubling everything except did 2 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks. It does do better when refrigerated overnight I think. I did 1/2 of it same day several hours later and the other 1/2 the next day with oreo. Both turned out awesome, but the next day one froze up a little better. I also love how it doesn't get rock hard. This will be my base for all  flavors!  Thank you!!!

Fabulous and truly creamy! I added an additional egg (actually just an egg yolk) for added creaminess. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I went by the directions except for one thing. I cooled the mixture surrounded by ice but didn't wait for it to get really cold because I had limited time. It was slightly cold then I put it in the ice cream maker to let it get thick. After about 20 minutes I took it out and separated it into two different containers. In one, I added crumbled double stuff oreo cookies. In the other, 1/4 th cup miniature chocolate chips and 1/4 th cup Reeses peanut butter chips. Both tasted divine but if I absolutely had to pick one over the other, I'd choose the oreo cookies. It's heaven on earth! Several family members and friends tasted it and gave it rave reviews!

Oh my goodness!  My girlfriend came home with an ice cream freezer she found at Goodwill and wanted to try it out.  So off we went to the store to get ingredients for this recipe and came home to our own little test kitchen.  We followed the directions exactly, except for one minor change.  We drained and added one small can of crushed pineapple to the mix.  This was superb.  My girlfriend is quite impressed with my kitchen abilities.  Again.  Our only mistake in doing this recipe is that we didn't double it.  It only filled the can about 1/3 of the way up.  Next time, we go for a gallon of pure heaven.

This was perfect for my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker.  I only used 1 cup of cream because that's all I had, and 3 cups of 2%.  I added one more egg then called for, and a bit more sugar, too.  The ice cream was indeed creamy and smooth and oh-so-good!  Served with Fresh Strawberries on top.  There were NO left overs.

I increased the vanilla to 1 Tbl to give it a strong vanilla flavor, added an extra egg yolk, and cooked it to a slightly higher temperature, based on the previous reviewers suggestions.    Excellent recipe.  Smooth, creamy with a nice body to it.  Highly recommend it!

Wonderful!!! Made this over the Fourth of July weekend in a hand crank ice-cream maker. I adjusted the recipe to be 5 eggs, 2 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 t salt, 6 1/4 c whipping cream, 5 c 1/2&1/2, 1 T Vanilla, 1 vanilla bean. Adjustments I made to the recipe to lighten it up were to replace the whipping cream with the 1/2&1/2, and use 2% milk for the called for amount of half and half. I also reduced the sugar by a half cup, and cooked a vanilla bean with the custard to give the ice cream a boost. Very yummy stuff!

Easy-(be patient.....) The best recipe there is. Don't waste your time with
uncooked....you won't be happy. Get it really cold before freezing in your machine.

This is the first ice cream I have made from scratch with my new ice cream maker.  The other ones were from mixes and were very icy and I was afraid it would always be that way.  But this ice cream is not the slightest bit icy!  It's sooo smooth and creamy.  I will probably never make a no-cook ice cream recipe after enjoying this stuff.

Thanks for the help daughter in college and loves ice cream!!I substituted a 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk and filled the can with 1% milk for the half and half.  Then added 3 TBS of sugar instead of the cup.

It came out great!

PS skip the eggs and cooking!

Creamy & delicious! Followed the recipe very closely - I doubled everything but TRIPLED the vanilla - cooking the custard mixture just to 180 degrees, stirring constantly. Stored in the fridge overnight & I'm not sure why but there were some curd-like chunks which I just strained out prior to adding the vanilla just before freezing. The double recipe was enough to serve 10 adult & 4 children & was LOVED by all! I'm really glad I tripled the vanilla, & I could see this easily being used as a base for other flavors!!!!

this is a delicious recipe,very creamy and rich! I dont have an ice cream maker so once I began to freeze the ice cream, every 30 min I took the ice cream out of the fridge and gave it a good stir with a whisk to make sure there were no clumps of ice and it came out perfect and yummy. I also added 3 TBSN of Vanilla extract instead of 2 1/4 TBSN for a stronger vanilla flavor.

Creamy with a great texture but a little too sweet. I would prefer the sugar to be adjusted down (I'll start with a decreased amount of  1/4 c. next time and see) to better taste the vanilla. I used fresh vanilla too by scrapping a bean into the base. I also poured the base into a popsicle mold and when ready to eat I dipped an end into "Magic Shell" chocolate coating.

I made this according to directions except just as I was cooling it I added 2 chopped up Dove candy bars.  THIS WAS SO GOOD!!  Everyone loved it. I am making it again today along with the cinnamon ice cream.
I also made it without the chocolate and made the mistake of switching the measurements for the cream and half and half...it didn't set up as nicely as the chocolate where I did it correctly.  Lesson learned...It was still great tasting though-it just froze harder and took longer to set up in the freezer.

Absolutely delicious! I slimmed it down slightly by using lowfat milk instead of half and half, but kept the whipping cream, and it was still pretty rich. I also used a real vanilla bean that I scraped out, and still used another tablespoon of extract. I can't wait to make this again. I just wish it would freeze faster so we could devour it right away.

This is my go-to vanilla ice cream.  I add a couple extra egg yolks and double the batch, and it disappears almost instantly every time.  Great texture and flavor!

This recipe is awesome! This is the first ice cream I have made that has to be cooked and I was a little worried about whether the eggs would be smooth in the mixture. Turned out wonderful. I used a whisk to keep the mixture stirring while it was cooking. We doubled the recipe for our 4-quart ice cream maker and added some fresh strawberries that I chopped and mashed a bit.   The ice cream is creamy and doesn't freeze so hard that you cannot scoop it. I tried two other recipes that did not use eggs or require cooking and they did not have the creamy texture and froze so solid that they could not be scooped. Try it, and you will love it, too!

Made this recipe exactly as written. Let the custard cool for a few hours in the fridge and then made it with my cuisinart ice cream maker. If I had to rate this recipe the day I made it, I would give it 4 stars for tasting a bit too "eggy" but 5 stars for texture. However, the next day the eggy taste mellowed out and the ice cream was fabulous - more than 5 stars for sure! This is my first time making a custard based ice cream at home and I can not get over the texture of this ice cream - it is so good.  This definitely goes in the "keep" pile! Thanks!

I thought this had excellent texture and the flavor was almost what I was looking for, but I found it to be a little too eggy for me. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, maybe when doubled I shouldn't have doubled the eggs as well. I will still use this as my base recipe, but use only 2 eggs when I double it next time.

Made this for my youngest's b-day and it was really good! Followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and heated it on medium-low whisking more and more as it got closer to temp. I might try more egg yolk next time and a better vanilla but still better than store bought!

Turned out perfectly. It was my first time making a custard style ice cream. I wish i left it in the ice cream maker so it could set up longer i stopped it after 20 mins, i will let it go for 30 mins next time.

This is a great custard style recipe, don't be afraid to add more vanilla though. I don't like things too "vanilla-y" and this recipe doesn't have enough even for my taste! Can't wait to experiment with different flavors and mix ins!

I don't like the hard consistency that homemade ice creams are notorious for, so I added 1 TABLESPOON of pure vanilla extract which contains alcohol.  This also added extra vanilla flavor.  Instead of real eggs, I used egg substitute since that's what I had on hand.  Once the ice cream had ripened in the freezer overnight, it was still creamy.  I also used this as a base for cookies n' cream and blueberry cheesecake ice cream.  UPDATE: I've made this a few times more, and in addition to the vanilla extract, I've also added 2 teaspoons of vodka (flavorless) to maintain a softer consistency in the freezer.  I have a 2 quart mixer, and this recipe almost overflows, so keep this in mind especially if you plan to add mix-ins.

Superb!!  My kids loved it and said it was better than store-bought and I only buy Breyers and Edy's.  Only my husband didn't care for it; he thought it tasted like whipped cream - it wasn't sweet enough for him. -Update: Even though I rated this 5 stars, I still came up with small pieces of egg white no matter how slow I heated it. So I did what I knew to do and that was to warm the milk to a light simmer and combine the eggs, sugar and salt separately and temper the egg mixture. This time it was perfect. No little pieces of egg yolk.

I decided to try this in spite of having a good family recipe handed down.  It was a smash at work and was even requested I make it later for someone's birthday.  It's going to be the new family recipe now.  I didn't have half and half, so did 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 2% milk instead and it worked out beautifully.

This recipe is really rich. It was good but it was like a heart attack in a cup. I would make it with half and half instead of with cream and non fat milk instead of half and half.

I enjoyed this recipe; tasted like I expected, but the other two members of my household had a bite or two and then refused any more. Apparently they thought it had a funny "sulfuric" after taste from the eggs, and I have to agree that it at least didn't smell too appetizing for the same reason. Very creamy with a good texture however.

Delicious!!!  I used vanilla bean paste instead of extract, so there were black vanilla bean specks throughout the ice cream.  Letting the ice cream chill in the refrigerator overnight before freezing in the ice cream maker really improves the flavor.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe is very good.  I used 1 whole egg & 3 yolks like a previous review suggested.  Tonight it will be served with Peach Cobbler.  Yum!

I made this recipe first and am used to using only egg yolks and also scalding the cream while making the custard separately and tempering it with the hot cream. The ice cream was still very good. Next time I will use recipe #VII

I have to give this the maximum stars for taste.  It really is the richest, most creamy recipe you will find.  However, for some reason it's very slow to freeze.  We have to crank our machine for 35 minutes!!  We've made this so many times and we have to do the same thing.  Maybe because of the richness?

By far the best ice cream recipe I've tried! Due to an ingredient shortage, I added 2 and 3/4 c.  heavy cream and only 1 and 1/2 c. half and half. Insanely rich with the extra cream, but GOOD!

I made this icecream for my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit!  It is well worth the time and effort.  I'm going to serve this with a rich chocolate cake for Christmas Dinner.

This was very tasty and rich! The only thing I changed about the recipe was adding a real vanilla bean (split and scraped) to the mix instead of vanilla extract. This was my inaugural attempt at making homemade ice cream and went along a lot smoother than I had planned. The only caveat was that after freezing the batch overnight it set up pretty hard, not nice and "scoopable" like it was when I checked on it after about an hour or two in the freezer. After a bit of research it seems to be the nature of the beast... it's just best when it's fresher. (of course, I'll welcome any tips to the contrary!)

I think next time I'll try this recipe one step down the milk ladder and try half & half and whole milk to make it a little less fatty, because sometimes the film heavy whipping cream leaves on the inside of my mouth feels icky.

This ice cream recipe is excellent! It has excellent flavour and texture. I've been using it as my base for other flavours as well (i.e. chocolate - adding 1 cup cocoa; strawberry - puree 1 quart of strawberries). This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

Amazingly creamy and delicious. Made per instructions, just added an extra tsp of vanilla since we like our ice cream quite vanilla-y. The other ice cream recipes with eggs all seem to use a ludicrous number of yolks (8!?), so it's great to find a recipe with wonderful results that only uses two eggs and doesn't waste the whites.

Made the recipe as published for a party of 20 to raves from all.  I've tried more custard-like bases and lighter bases, but to me, this is absolutely the perfect balance.  Don't change a thing.

Wonderful! I switched the whipping cream (2 cups) and half-and-half (2.5 cups), mostly because the small containers are 2 cups and I only had one.  It still turned out delicious! I added vanilla bean...yum.  I love the consistency when it freezes, and it tastes better each day - well, up to 3 days anyway, that's the longest it's lasted around here!

This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream. I picked it because of the reviews and it used fewer eggs than others and I didn't have many on hand. It exceeded our expectations! It has wonderful consistency and tastes fabulous! I used whole milk in place of the half and half. I also scraped two vanilla beans into the mixture before I heated it (plus used the regular amount of extract). I WILL make it again and use it for a base for other flavors! UPDATE: Added small can of crushed pineapple, coconut extract and toasted coconut for an amazing pina colada ice cream!

Very yummy... I had a vanilla bean I needed to use so I added the scrapped seeds to the cream, I used all half and half except for one 1/2 pint of whipping cream. After cooking and cooling the mixture, I added the vanilla bean pod and let it set for 24 hours before freezing using my kitchenaid ice cream attachment.. Awesome, and very creamy!!

This had a very creamy texture, but smelled strongly of eggs.  I used exactly what the recipe called for, made no changes.  As soon as the icecream was ready and we took the lid off, the stench of eggs was all I could smell.  I didn't even want to try it, but I did.  It tasted like eggs, not vanilla icecream/custard.  I was very dissapointed.  My family did not like it either.

Outstanding ice cream recipe!  This gets rave reviews from lifelong homemade ice cream fans.  Cooking takes awhile to avoid cooking the eggs too fast but it is worth it!

Thank you for putting the pen to the receipe that I have been using for years, although mine was just from trial and error and it changed a little from season to season (depending on my memory) and of course I could never give the recipe to my children because I never measured anything so they always said but Mom, it doesn't taste like yours.  For the people who said it takes a while to freeze, the higher the fat content, the longer it will take to freeze but that is what makes it good and creamy.  Also, I would like to thank the people who made additions or changes that added the amounts.

Made this last night....everyone loved it! I doubled the batch...added more pure mexican vanilla, and chopped butterfinger candy bars. I put what was left in the freezer. We had it with lunch...it was even better being in the freezer all night. My husband loves icecream..he says this is the best he's ever had! I'll certainly be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  As others mentioned, I added a little more vanilla and the taste was wonderful.  Next time, I will make it the night before freezing and let it cool in the refrigerator overnight before transferring to the ice cream maker.  It was too warm and churned for 1.5 hrs (and still was too soft).  It was better the next day after it had hardened in the freezer.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I add two crushed up heath bars at the end of the cycle and let it set up in the freezer overnight.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with excellent results. I used the ice cream attachment for my Kitchen Aid mixer. I did think it would overflow, but it did not. (It came close, though!)Update: I made it again, this time taking some of the vanilla out toward the end and adding in strawberries. It was delicious!

This is a great Hagan Daz style ice cream. Rich and creamy. Also, a great base for other ice creams. I made a fantastic rum raisin. This is my "go to" recipe for homemade ice cream!

I loved it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c it is more of a frozen custard than an ice cream. I personally love frozen custard and will definitely be making this again!

This was some of the best homemade vanilla ice cream I have ever had. I made this for a large 4th of July get together. I had to triple the recipe to fill a 6 qt freezer. I also used the suggestion for the extra egg yolks. It was a tremendous hit! Great also with fresh fruit toppings. Thanks!

I didn't really like the flavor of this, but I forgot to add the vanilla in until I had already made it. I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.  It was okay, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

This is the best vanilla homemade icecream I have ever made.  It beats my family's recipe by far.  I made a mistake and added the vanilla to the initial ingredients and so cooked it too.  This didn't make any difference.  I did add extra vanilla as some others had suggested (1 TBSP).  Do not add any extra milk - it looks thick and is supposed to be!  I doubled my recipe which provided more than enough for 7 people.  Everyone agreed with how good it was.  Thanks for the recipe - it will be our tradition to use this one now!

I've been looking for a good ice cream base .. and boy have I found it !   My daughter loves Cotton Candy Ice Cream.  Can't wait to use this Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe as the starter.  It was a huge hit with the Memorial Day crowd.  Tasted just like store bought.  Definetly need to add extra vanilla!  YUM.

Very good and creamy.  Very rich and decadent, a perfect match to Grandma Ople's Apple pie recipe, also on this site.

This was ok.  It turned out a little icy, instead of purely creamy, but I'm not sure if that was a problem with my ice cream maker.  I added Heath Bar, Reeses peanut butter cups, and chocolate chips.  I'll probably keep looking for the perfect ice cream base.

I think this has good potential.  As it is it is rather blah.  We filled the ice cream freezer to the line with milk per freezer instruction so I am unsure if that was the difference.  It needs more sugar and more vanilla.  It just needs more flavor.  It was quite good after I just stirred a little more sugar it.  I would give it another try.  You will wear your arm off stirring the stuff though.
