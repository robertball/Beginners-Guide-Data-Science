I had never sweetened my corn meal mush before.  This tasted good with the all fruit grape jelly on top of Greek yogurt (I didn't have any cottage cheese).

This is good. My son hates oatmeal but loves this. I made it today with milk, and used ricotta cheese in the topping, which made it a little more luxurious.

I have seen an Italian recipe in a magazine for sweet polenta with milk (polenta cremosa con latte freddo). Both this recipe and the polenta recipe call for 45 min cooking times. However, I am usually running late in the morning- I don't know if these recipes are using a coarser ground cornmeal but I have gotten away with bringing to a boil and simmering maybe 5 min and it is smooth and creamy.

This recipe was more labor intensive than some of my entrees.  This MIGHT work with oatmeal, but not cornmeal.
