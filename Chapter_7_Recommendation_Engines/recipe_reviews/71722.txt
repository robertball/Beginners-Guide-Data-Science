I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because it's dangerously close to a 5-star recipe, but it's not quite there.  I gotta tell you, this recipe is an AWESOME way to sneak in those veggie soy crumbles (looks like ground beef, but doesn't always taste like it...except it TOTALLY works in this recipe).  Definitely make the sauce as suggested by another reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste)...in my opinion, the sauce makes this a 5-star recipe!  I used regular fresh ginger rather than pickled, and shredded some carrots to serve on top of everything.  I would have LOVED to have those nice crunchy noodle-y things, but once I heard they are fried in oil, I had to say "no thanks!"  I'm definitely going to make these again (they're really easy to make, by the way) and will also pass on the recipe!

Loved it!  Added about 2Tbs of chili paste for spice.  Next time I am going to make with ground turkey and add thinly sliced carrots and rice noodles for crunch.  I made an asian dipping sauce to add on like at PF Changs (1tsp sesame oil, 2T soy, 2T rice vinegar, 1T chile paste, sugar and i green onion slices)

I've been eating lettuce wrap at many Chinese restaurants since I was a little kid, so I have over 3 decades worth of eating this stuff.  I've tried many different variations and can attest that this recipe is top-notch.  

However, instead of ground beef, most Chinese restaurants use ground pork or duck.  Except for substituting ground beef for ground pork and omitting the pickled ginger (since I didn't have any in the house), I made no changes to the recipe.  As a suggestion, try serving the meat over a bed of crispy rice noodles (vermicelli) as I've seen done in many restaurants.  Simply heat some oil and dunk a small handful of noodles at a time...they crisp up in a couple of seconds.  Not only does it make the presentation nice, it adds a nice crisp crunch to the meat mixture.  

Also, for extra burst of flavour, put a bit of hoisin sauce (see recipe here as well) before wrapping it up in a lettuce leaf, as one other person suggested.

If I could give 7 stars, I would! My variations: I don't like ginger & finding pickled ginger wasn't worth my efforts so I omitted it.  I did add a very healthy portion (perhaps up to 2 tbsn) of Thai sweet chili pepper sauce (looks like a clear gelatin with red confetti in it).  I thought this tasted EXACTLY like PF Chang's, but without the hefty appetizer price.  The key to getting the taste just right, is the sesame oil. (It has a strong flavor & if it's missing, won't quite taste the same as PF Chang's, but don't over do it!)  For serving these as an appetizer, I used the leaves from butter (Bibb) lettuce. They are sturdy enough, but much smaller than iceberg and have a vibrant green color so they make the perfect appetizer ingredient or the perfect size for kids.

I was made this last night for my husband who loves PF Changs lettuce wraps.  In trying to be more like those at PF Changs I used chicken instead of beef.  Since chicken is a bit dryer I doubled all the liquid except the sesame oil (since it's so flavorful).  I also added crushed peanuts and bambooshoots.  My husband was impressed and told me they were just as good as PF Changs.

My sister and I are vegetarians. Yesterday, we challenged ourselves to go a week without bread, pasta, grains, etc.... Very hard to do as we feel that's what fills us instead of meat. I was looking for a good recipe besides our normal pasta, veggie burgers, fruit, and veggies. I came across this recipe and thought that I could make it using Vegetarian Ground Beef (I prefer Boca). It worked out perfectly. I just made it all in one pot. I substituted ground ginger for fresh and left out the chile and chestnuts. Used a little extra soy sauce, and we toasted some sesame seeds and chopped cashews for some crunch. Next time, I think I'll add some bean sprouts.

I used ground chicken and subbed bamboo shoots for the chestnuts bc i wanted the added crunch...they turned out delicious!  I also made extra sauce on the side: 1/4 c plum sauce, a tbsp OJ, 1/2 tsp cornstarch, 1 tbsp teriyaki sauce--boil for 1 minute and let cool.  Spread a bit on the meat mixture when eating--tastes amazing.

I had ground pork in the freezer so I started searching Allrecipes and found this GREAT lettuce wrap recipe. My husband loved it and said it was very impressive. I will place this recipe in my favorites for sure. I did have to add a little more hoisin sauce, because it was a little dry for my taste. The plum sauce and PF Chang sauce recipes posted were the finshing touch needed to complete this recipe. Thank you for the freshing recipe! Plum Sauce: 1/4 c. plum sauce, 1T. OJ, 1/2 t. cornstarch, & 1 t. teriyaki sauce ( I used Soy Vay) boil 1 minute. PF Chang sauce: 1t. sesame oil, 2T. soy, 2T. rice vinegar, & 1T. chile paste ( I didn't have paste, so I used Sriracha Chili sauce) wisk.  YUMMY DISH!!!

I have made this recipe and loved it, only change was to used fresh minced ginger, since like so many I did not have pickled ginger.  This is in my stack of favorites.

I made this as directed minus the water chestnuts and green onions as I didn't have any, but it was still really good. My husband and I have never had PF Chang's (they dont' have them here), but the recipe itself is very good and healthy. We are going to try it with ground turkey next time. We used romaine lettuce because our store didn't have bibb lettuce or butter lettuce, adn the romaine was really sturdy. We are going to have this a lot more often. Thanks for sharing the recipe--a great combo of flavors.

I love this recipe!!  Most lettuce wraps call for chicken or pork, which I don't always have on hand.  I use regular ginger and it works great.  I have used a similar recipe that calls for 4 c. finely chopped cabbage, so I added that this time (extra nutrition and makes the mixture go a lot further!).  Also, I make a drizzling sauce of equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a little water, honey, and ginger.  Yummy!

This was a huge hit!  Just a few minor adjustments.  I used ground chicken instead of ground beef and I used fresh minced ginger root. I also used an extra tablespoon of soy, vinegar, and chili sauce.  I served it with shredded carrots and rice noodles.  I also made a dipping sauce that was really good:     *   1/4 cup   sugar     * 1/2 cup water     * 2 tablespoons soy sauce     * 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar     * 2 tablespoons ketchup     * 1 tablespoon lemon juice     * 1/8 teaspoon sesame oil     * 1 tablespoon hot mustard     * 2 teaspoons water     * 1 -2 teaspoon garlic and red chile paste I am definitely making these again...so good!

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday party last weekend. It was a big hit with everyone, including the kids! I made it with ground turkey and used the great PF Chang sauce suggested by another member - too good!

Loooove this recipe!  It reminds me of Tin Star's Lettuce Wraps!  I didn't have the pickled ginger and ended up using ground ginger as it was the only thing on hand.  I also had to omit the green onions because I was out. Out of curiosity I added a couple Tbl of chopped cilantro.  All I can say is FANTASTIC!!! Hubby says it's a keeper. Thanks so much for getting me started.  Your recipe is awesome!

My bar is pretty high being Asian and raised in Vancouver with great restaurants, and this was good.  I made it without the chile peer sauce, but instead made a "Hoisin Dipping Sauce" from chinesefood.about.com (spoon it inside before you wrap up the leaf) and it was delicious.  I stir fried the garlic and ginger from the sauce, then put it a bowl with the other sauce ingredients to sit.  Then I used the same pan to cook the Asian Lettuce Wraps beef and so on.  I'm going to be making this one again.

My wife does these all the time with a twist and I love it. Instead of all the mess she makes a salad and we put the sauces ( garlic ginger, thai chili and sweet and sour) on and eat with a fork. So much neater.

I used this recipe as a base in an attempt to recreate Joey's Grill Chinatown Lettuce Wraps. Instead of beef, I used 2 cut up chicken breasts,  EVOO for the oil, fresh ginger, red wine vinegar instead of rice wine, and plain old iceberg lettuce.  Definitely add the hot sauce (I used Sriracha, the one with the rooster on it). I also added roasted unsalted cashews and topped with cilantro. Joey's wraps have those crispy noodles but I skipped them. These turned out awesome! I have saved this recipe and will make many times in the future! Thanks Rachel!!

Soooo good! I have never had an Asian wrap before so I don't have anything to compare to. I had made rice for a side dish but we ended up putting the rice in the wrap, and said we would not eat them with out the rice in the wrap. Very good and very easy tho!

This has a fantastic flavor.  I have made it twice now, once with ground beef and once with ground chicken and prefer the ground chicken in this recipe.  In no way is this bland.  I like bold, spicy food and added extra garlic chili sauce to spice it up and offset the sweetness of the hoisin sauce.  I made the recipe as written except used 1/2 tsp ground ginger instead of pickled and increased the chili garlic sauce to about 3 TBL and added shredded carrots and broccoli slaw to increase the vegetables in the dish.   This would also make a great filling for egg rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these for late night snacks for guests and they got housed!  While I didn't *love* them (I thought they were a bit on the sweet side) and would have rated them a "4", everyone else's raves bumped them up to a "5".  I followed the recipe, w/the exception of ginger which I didn't have.  I also followed the top reviewers suggestions for the sauce.

I made this tonite as directed, with the exception of using ground turkey breast instead of the ground beef.  Despite the variety of ingredients, this dish did not have the 'wow' factor we were expecting.  If you do try this recipe, be sure to have all ingredients prepped and ready to go prior to starting; it is a very quick and easy dish to assemble. Not a bad dish per se, just not for us.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used to think that the lettuce wraps at PF Changs were the best, but after making these last night with a few changes, they turned out even better! I used ground pork, made twice the amount of sauce, added a small amount of peanut butter & chopped peanuts as suggested and added the crispy noodles on top. We also used not only butter lettuce but iceburg lettuce which gane it a nice crispy bite. They were great, we ate them over the sink (messy) but until they were gone.

Made almost exactly as written, including optional pepper sauce. My only sub was ground ginger for pickled, our market had none. The sauce was delicious and I should have doubled it, it simply didn't provide a full enough flavor to the beef. Made with shredded or ground chicken, turkey or pork, a single batch of sauce would likely be fine. Definitely worth making again, although I'll likely use romaine. It'll make a sturdier wrap and provide some flavor of it's own. This was very good, thanks for sharing! ******UPDATE****** Made this again using ground pork. Delicious! I served it with rice and got rave reviews. Have made this numerous times now and have found it's great with added veggies, like red bell peppers, carrots, frozen peas, really anything. It's all good! Really, lettuce is not needed, forks work just fine.

I made very small modifications to the recipe, but I have to say that this recipe was absolutely AMAZING! Instead of ground meat, I used chicken and chopped them up into small cubes. I omitted the pickled ginger and used regular distilled vinegar because I didn't want to buy rice wine. I included about a 1/4 cup of sweet and spicy chili sauce and reduce the amount of sesame oil to 1 teaspoon. I served this up with warm rice and lettuce and I can assure you that I will be making this recipe many more times! Delicious!

This recipe was super easy and extremely tasty. My boyfriend and I agreed it was a much preferred replacement for our usual fajitas, which are not quite as healthy or flavourful. I did alter a few things and the wraps still turned out great. I used soy meat instead of ground beef (easy to cook with because it is pre-cooked, takes on the flavours of whatever dish you use it in, and is a much healthier option). I also used chopped red peper instead of water chestnuts for more flavor but still with some crunch. Finally, I added grated carrots and bean sprouts to be used on top - a great addition! They added extra texture and flavour. I really recommend this recipe, its perfect for every level of "at-home chef" out there!

Let's just say I wasn't expecting much from this recipe...but boy was I wrong!!!   This is one delicious meal!!  I used ground chicken instead of beef and left out the chile sauce and ginger(I didn't have any), but I was REALLY impressed with the flavor....my wife and I ate the entire bowl for dinner and I'm already planning on making this again(with the chile sauce this time).  I'm not the biggest fan of water chesnuts and was hesitant to use the whole can...but they added the best crunch!!!  I'm also thinking of adding some peanuts as well.  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe!!

The only change made was ground lean turkey instead of beef...we're trying to lighten things up around here.  My daughter and I loved it and will make again and let grandson and DH give it a try.

I've made this as is, but love it way better with ground chicken (it's supposed to be made with ground chicken or duck).  Also used spring roll wraps instead of the lettuce (b/c that's what we had), and added half a bag of stir-fry vegetables when browning the onion.  Served with hoisin sauce and red pepper paste and added sliced avocados and rice in the wraps.  The kids loved wetting the spring roll wraps for everyone too.

I never could find the Bibb or Butter lettuce so I had to use Iceberg. The only other change is that I halved the ginger because a little goes a long way for us. I made some using ground beef and some using ground pork and they were both very good. Thanks for the fun recipe!

AWESOME!  After reading the other reviews, I decided to follow the directions completely which required me to buy some new ingredients that I hadn't worked with before, but I'm so glad I did!  It was so good!  I served this on a bed of rice noodles fried in oil, and made a sauce as some other reviewers suggested using 1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste.  An awesome recipe!  I will definately do this again!

These lettuce wraps were a hit!  I will definitely make these again.  I added shredded carrots and zucchini, and I also put 5oz. of bamboo shoots and 5oz. of water chestnuts in the mix.  Before adding the ground beef, I saved some veggie mixture for vegetarian lettuce wraps. Both were exceptional and I will DEFINITELY make them again!  :)

Great and easy to follow recipe! This is a keeper! I forgot to buy hoisin sauce but I found an easy substitute recipe: 5 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp peanut butter, 1 1/2 tsp honey, 2 tsp hot sauce, 2 tsp sesame oil, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, & dash of pepper. Mix well!

Wonderful recipe that I think is very close to PF Changs.  I used regular head lettuce and didn't have rice wine vinegar (so I substituted red wine vinegar, not bad, but rice wine vinegar IS better).  Also cannot find the chile sauce (still looking) so I used Heinz chili sauce (not a terrible sub).  Finally, I wanted some crunch so I roasted some peanuts to toss on top of my wrap.  Served with white rice.  I did try a batch with ground chicken, but beef was much better IMHO.

These were very good!  Couldn't find Bibb lettuce so I had to use iceberg, but followed the recipe as stated.  Good flavor, nice crunch after I added soem shredded cabbage and carrots.  Next time I will add some roasted peanuts for another dimension of crunch and flavor!

Yum! These are fantastic!!! Made these for dinner 2nite. My hubby & I have eaten heavy meals w/ friends & family all weekend (it's my Bday). Tonight, I was craving a staisfying, yet "light" meal to balance out all of the calorie-laden ones. :) This more than exceeded my expectations! My hubby isn't even a fan of lettuce wraps, but said these were the best he's ever had (wow!). Rachel's recipe is perfect as is, but I did "tweak" it a bit.... Insted of lean beef, I subbed ground pork (it's waaay cheaper). And, since Rachel didn't mention how much chile sauce to use, I went with 1/2 T. NOTE: I do think pickled ginger is a better choice than fresh. Both have a distinct, yet very different taste (one is pickled - duh!). I ended up finding a small jar near my grocer's shshi section. My grocer was out of Boston bibb lettuce so I used the California bibb variety instead. CA bibb is pretty much the same as it's Boston counterpart, but a paler green color and MUCH better suited for wrapping, IMHO (it's sturdier). Oh, and make the dipping sauce other's have shared in their reviews (2 T soy, 2 T rice wine vinegar, 1 T Sirracha chile sauce & 1 t sesame oil). My hubby and I REALLY enjoyed the dipping sauce. It adds that extra "oomph" that everyone has raved about. Served with a sprinkling of crispy Asian rice noodles, a side of steamed jasmine rice and iced green tea, this was a light, yet incredibly filling meal. Thanks SO much for sharing, Rachel. I'll be making this again soon! :-)

I've never had asian wraps before,and just made this for dinner. Instead of wraps, I made the meat mixture (using poached chicken) and used it on an iceburg lettuce salad. I also substituted ground ginger,and terriaki sauce for the hoison,and used about a tspn of red pepper flakes,and let it simmer with the mixture. I served the salad with thai rice noodles mixed w/ peanut sauce,and topped w/peanuts,and cilantro. My husband said the dinner was "bomb",and I enjoyed also. The meat mixture had an all-around great flavor! Thanks for recipe!

I used ground chicken for this, but seasoned as written.  The flavor was good, but it needed something.  The kids liked it, but I thought it was just okay.  I was mad at my husband when I tried this, so it's possible that my irritation affected my opinion at the time....lol.  If i make again, I will prob use chopped chicken breast instead of ground chicken, and hope it tastes more like PF Changs.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would rate this higher if I could!  We went to PF Chang's after friends talked about it and we had their lettuce wraps.  I was hooked.  I searched for a recipe for something similar.  When I found this, I ran to store and made for dinner that night! The only change I made - I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and did not used pickled ginger, just fresh chopped ginger.   My family loved it!  I am making again tonight and I need to double the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I make a similar version of this using lean ground turkey.  I use water chestnuts for crunch, green onion, mushrooms (sometimes) and for the sauce I use Iron Chef Sesame Garlic sauce I find in the Asian section at Winco.  I use no extra oil and it is not missed.  After cooking the ground meat I drain excess oil.  DELICIOUS!

I have had this saved in my recipe box forever and finally made it.  What a treat.  Since we don't like water chestnuts I added 3 stalks of sliced celery.   The flavors were amazing.  I served it with steamed white rice.

What a great change of pace! Loved this recipe! Made just as recipe called for but held the chili sauce for kids. We put it on romaine lettuce leafs and garnished with shredded carrots and rice noodles for crunch. The beauty of this recipe is that you can use any kind of meat you prefer. I used ground sirloin but will try ground turkey next. I will definitely be making this for my extended family. This is very much "out of the box" for my meat and potatoe family.

Great meal for a summer night. I pretty much followed the ingredients, except used regular sesame oil, and fresh grated ginger. I'm all for easy and so cooked the ground beef and other ingredients together, my beef was very lean, so not much fat to drain. Topped with grated carrots and diced green onions. The husband sprinkled some grated cheese on his...not me it was terrific just as written. Will be making this one again.

Found a gluten free hoisin sauce today, so was able to make this for my wife who loved the taste - apart from the onions. I think next time I'll just add a little onion salt and replace the onions with bamboo shoots. But, anyway... Super yum!

Wow!  A big hit when I had everyone over for Christmas eve.  Abosolutely fab!  I used the sauce that some other reviewer wrote to serve them with (1 tsp seasame oil, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chili paste, 2 T soy sauce).  I am going to try it with ground chicken next(found it near the ground beef at the grocery store)so it will be more like P.F. Changs.  A keeper.

Fair warning, these don't taste like pf changs.  So if your going to make this thinking that it will be like pf changs they won't.  BUT.. if you do want a good Asian wrap recipe this is a the one.  I used ground chicken.  I also doubled the sauce.  Next time I will use less sodium soy because it was on the verge of being to salty.  Also I will half the ginger because it was pretty strong.  Pretty tasty!

Solid recipe!  Great tasting and easy enough for a weeknight dinner.  Like other viewers I made a dipping sauce (soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, siracha) and I topped with crushed peanuts.

I swapped the beef for pork, loin chops that I minced, and used romaine. Added some chopped mushrooms to use them up. Also made the suggested sauce but think I'd go 1 T soy  next time, even using low sodium I thought it was a tad too salty. Good  recipe to customize.

I made these for dinner earlier this week. I made quite a few changes due to our tastes, but left the seasonings the same. I used finely diced chicken breast instead of beef, and added diced carrots, celery, and green onions as well. We thought this was really good, and a relatively healthy and low carb dinner option. Thanks!

When my ultra picky son says "Mom, this is pretty good" I know I have a winner. So darn easy. I typically make this with chicken which has to marinate the majority of the day, so I rarely make it. I'm recommending it to all my mom friends. Thanks for a keeper!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  No changes are needed at all!  I have been making it about every two weeks since i found this on here..  A great addition is to serve the yellow saffron rice on the side and you can add shredded cheddar to it.. YUM!  Thanks so much for sharing Rachel!

Delicious... not quite PF Changs but delish!!  That's why I'm giving it 4 stars - not 5.  I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could.  It's a little on the expensive side after buying Hoisin sauce and all the other ingredients but it's worth the effort.

This dish was just okay.  My hubby and I weren't wow'd by this.  It was healthy, but I'd probably won't bother making this again.

Great recipe! I love onions and at first thought that this would be too oniony. But it wasnt at all. The sauce is complex and very tasty and the water chestnuts added a nice crunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I used finely chopped chicken tenderloins and it was delicious! I went to three stores but could not find the Bibb lettuce. Disappointing as that is the best with wraps, but they were still good with green leafy lettuce. It smells fantastic while cooking!

Stupendous! Definitely double the "sauce" ... as is it isn't enough to season the 1 lb. of meat. I even added  a little extra of the things we love:  hoisin, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and sweet chili sauce (we love ours sweet).

I used the sauce (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste) suggested by other reviews and these turned out great.  I did use bibb lettuce which was a bit flimsy and made it a messy meal but my hubby & 3yr old loved them!

Delish!  As the hubby said, definitely memorable!  I used the sauce that a few people had mentioned (2 Tbsp soy sauce/1 tsp rice vinegar/1 Tbsp sesame oil and added 2 Tbsp chili-garlic sauce instead of "chili paste"...couldn't find that at the store. Oh, and I added about a tsp of fish sauce as well)  I didn't use hoisin sauce as I didn't have any on hand.  

I also added a bunch of veggies:  1 8 oz can water chestnuts, about 1 1/2 cups of mushrooms, 3/4 of a carrot (finely sliced), green onions, fresh ginger, 2 big shallots instead of an onion, and the garlic as recommended.  

I used a lb of ground turkey, browned it in about a Tbsp of sesame oil instead of "cooking oil."  I used a bit more sesame oil to stir-fry all the veggies.

Overall, awesome!!  I will say that the 2 Tbsp of chili-garlic sauce made it spicier...I'm a bit of a puss when it comes to spice.  Any more, and it would have been too much for me!!

Made this last night and loved it!  We used the dipping sauce recommended by the previous reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste), substituted ground turkey breast, fresh ground ginger, and bean sprouts instead of the water chestnuts.  1 T Sriracha added to the mix (in addition to the dipping sauce) was perfect, but we both really like some heat.  Delicious!

These were fabulous.  I LOVE hoisin sauce so a recipe can't go wrong with that in it!  These are best the second day.  I keep making larger portions each time, but my family seems to gobble up whatever amount I make!

Tasty, but the beef mixture seemed like it was missing something... I'll try a few different things.  Maybe sesame oil? Great jumping off point though!

Outstanding - big hit with family! Used Premium Boston Bib from Costco. Major fun participation food. Sloppy but who cares! Rarely cook during the week due to work, so made double batch - will be perfect leftover with jasmine rice or more wraps. Love it.

Really tasty and a nice change of pace.  My grocery did not have Hoisin sauce, so I substituted oyster sauce from the Asian food aisle with a generous squeeze of honey.  Worked just fine.  Served with buttered hot jasmine rice and a side of cold crisp freshjumbo radishes sprinkled with kosher salt from Whole Foods.  Thanks for recipe, will make again I am sure.

I haven't tried this recipe, but had had this before. To make it even healthier, use ground chicken instead of beef.  Also asian fish sauce (Not straight fish sauce from bottle) for dipping is great with it as well.  You can also pack mint, sliced cucumbers inside the lettuce wrap for even tastier treat.  Great food for weight loss!

These are awesome! Almost as good as the ones at PF Chang. I made a couple changes.. added extra toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar, added a chopped zucchini and a shredded carrot. Chopped toasted nuts or chow mein noodles are good on top. Since I made these, I have found 'Asian Dipping Sauce' recipe from this site, and I think that's exactly what this recipe is missing. I'll definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe to a T except substituted pork. I made the soy/vinegar based sauce another reviewer suggested and also made my own (1/4 cup of Hoisin sauce, 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1/3 cup of water). It was excellent and my husband now wants to eat this every week! Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe! The wraps were GREAT, a huge hit. I will definitely make these again! 
A couple changes I made: instead of ground beef I used ground pork, I didn't have pickled ginger so I used ground- it worked fine, although fresh would be really good. I cut the amount of sesame oil in half and it was still plenty, it has such a strong flavor.

I feel insane but I made this as is and it was so horrible.  My very non-picky husband couldn't even finish one wrap.  Maybe it is just our taste, but I noticed that many of the reviews contained alterations... It should be reviewed as it is listed.

This was great! My husband loved it. He hates water chestnuts so I substituted chopped, toasted cashews which were very good. I also omitted the pickled ginger which I could not find. This was a very simple wonderful recipe that I will make often.

I have made this with ground turkey and with ground beef; both work well. I wasn't sure whether to serve the sauce on the side or mix it with the meat, but found it easier to serve to my kids when I mixed them together. I found this to be a great, light dinner served with some rice and asian salad. Delicious!

This reminded us of an American spin on how an Asian Sloppy Joe might taste. We omitted the cooking and sesame oils to avoid unnecessary fat, forgot to add the pickled ginger, and added the optional Asian chile pepper sauce. Used romaine lettuce as the two types of lettuce leaves suggested by recipe submitter were not available. We had to personalize the seasonings to satisfy our tastes as it was odd tasting without adjustments, and Asian flavor was sadly MIA. Perhaps the Asian ingredients just don’t pair well with hamburger which is uncommon in real Asian dishes. The good news is that it brought back fond memories of my elementary school days when the sloppy Joe sauce would dribble down the kid’s chins onto their shirts and/or laps. Take Rachel’s advice to have plates and napkins ready to go as lettuce leaves elevate ‘sloppy’ to a new level.

Am-ASIAN! These were SO GOOD. I was very happy with the taste. These are not normally ingredients I stock in my kitchen, but I'm glad I didn't skip anything. The only thing I lessened was the onions and the garlic. 

No complaints - this recipe is TOP NOTCH!

I made the recipe and wanted to add the white noodley things (actually bean threads) for crunch and presentation.  Rather than mess with frying, I was able to "toast" them in the microwave.  The bean threads come in several bundles in a package.  I broke off half of one bundle and separated the threads as much as possible.  On a paper plate, microwave in 30 second intervals, tossing the threads after each interval, for a total of 3-4 minutes or until the threads are crunchy.  Easy, no-hassle way to get the desired crunch and pretty presentation!

Delicious! I did make some changes by following what another reviewer suggested. Using 1 tsp sesame oil, 2 tbs soy sauce, 2 tbs vinegar, 1 tbs chile sauce. The final product was on the strong side of flavor, but I would have preferred a sweet taste with it. I used the hoisin sauce as a dipping sauce, and it was much better. When I make this again, I will use the hoisin in it, but use only the 1 tbs of rice wine rather than what other people have suggested.

I made these for the first time and while they taste pretty good, I think they could use some more seasoning.  I doubled the vinegar, pepper sauce, hoisen sauce, and sesame oil and it helped.  I also added some garlic and onion powder. In the future, per others reviews I will try the peanuts, cilantro, mushrooms and some extra lime slices to squeeze on top of the wraps.

I love PF Chang's lettuce wraps, and this is an easy, delicious at-home alternative  I used ground chicken instead of hamburger and "browned" the chicken in peanut oil for more of an asian flavor.  I used minced fresh ginger, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I also used the serving sauce suggested by another reviewer (2 tsp sesame oil, 4 T soy sauce, 4 T rice vinegar, 2 T chile paste) and that definitely was the perfect addition to an already wonderful dish.  I served it to friends and they all loved it and asked for the recipe.

**I also added chopped cilantro. and served limes to sqeeze on the side.  yummo!

This is a 5 star recipe in our house. I double the recipe now since I've made it so much and we always want left overs. My husband and both daughters who are 4 and 18 months LOVE them. I usually add a little more Hoisin sauce and low sodium soy sauce to have little more sauce. If I have mushrooms, carrots or zuchini on hand I will chop in the food processor and add to have more veggies. Sometimes I toast sesame seeds and almonds to top it with for extra crunch! DELISH!!!

Great recipe - can't believe it took me so long to try this one.  I won't wait that long again!  I didn't have pickled ginger, so I just used fresh grated ginger.  The flavors meld together nicely.  The leftovers seemed to have even more flavor.  The next time I make this I will double the recipe and freeze half the meat mixture for another evening.  This was served with 'Glazed Carrots Asian Style' and 'Fried Rice with Ginger, Hoisin, and Sesame' both AR recipe.  Dinner was delicious!

I tried this recipe once before using leftover rotisserie chicken (that i cut up small).My husband and I both preferred the chicken over the beef and we LOVE beef.  I think a little cilantro would be a great addition.  I used romaine lettuce because I always have it on hand.  Added a little red bell pepper in with the onion.  Made 1.5 of sauce, vs doubling.  We still loved it but the chicken was surprisingly better.

Very delicious! I loved the contrasting textures and temperatures of the lettuce wrap and the meat/veggie mix. I added minced canned straw mushrooms, which were delicious in this recipe, while also adding a meaty texture to make it seem like you have double the meat. The sauce was delicious. I used regular minced ginger because I couldn't find any pickled ginger, though I do love pickled ginger. I didn't bother to buy Asian chili sauce, but I had some regular chili sauce and some leftover spring roll dipping sauce on hand that I added in. I would definitely make this again, even though it was a little bit messy at times.

I used this as a rough idea just to follow. All I had were Romain Hearts, so we used those. They worked perfectly. I lift out the water chestnuts. Added celery and cabbage, used a mixture of what I had on hand for the seasoning/spices. Turned out AMAZING! I will for sure be making them again.

The meat was a bit bland as written, I had to add a whole lot of junk & stuff to get it to delicious.  Added lots of garlic & onion powder, worcestershire, garlic & ginger paste, Siracha, sweet & sour and extra hoisin... THEN it was awesome!  Also did more toppings, sprouts, carrots, cilantro.  VERY GOOD!!!

AWESOME!!! Made as written except for omitting the ginger (grocery store didn't have it and I had no time to go to the Asian market) and adding in a can of bean sprouts just because I had them to use up. Hubby gave these 2 thumbs up, and I absolutely agree! Oh, I also made the dipping sauce that some of the reviewers suggested and that just put these over the top. Served this w/ 'Asian Coconut Rice' from here and it was a perfect match. Will definately make these again~YUM! thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this recipe! Word of advice though.. use iceberg lettuce instead of butter lettuce. Butter lettuce leaves aren't big enough to eat these without everything falling on your lap. Cut a whole head of iceberg lettuce in half and peel the leaves off. This is how similar lettuce wraps were served at a restaurant I went to.

Smells and tastes great.  I used fresh ginger instead of pickled and a fair amount of chili paste.  I also made the sauce that others have mentioned.  I'd like to try it with shredded chicken or ground turkey next time.

Great! I used ground turkey, no oil to brown it. I added a diced up red bell pepper and an 8oz can of bamboo shoots cut up (you can find it in the Asian section of your grocery store). Great flavor! The lettuce was breaking apart so we just threw some lettuce in a tortilla and ate it that way :O)

We LOVE this! We use ground turkey instead of beef & serve with a variety of sauces (both homemade & bottled) & serve as appetizer or as a nibbler during a cocktail party. We've used butter, romaine & iceberg lettuces's & we actually like any of them!

Yum! I substituted turkey to make this even healthier and it was an awesome, fresh dinner. Make just as written and did create a dipping sauce as one reviewer mentioned (1tsp sesame oil, 2T soy, 2T rice vinegar, 1T chile paste, sugar and i green onion slices). Really good spicy, as well. This recipe is definitely going to the rotation!

Not as fabulous as PF Chang's, but still yummy. I didn't use much oil so I feel like I could have added a tad to the meat mixture once I added everything else in. Definitely will make again though.

Thank you!!!!!
We just had this for dinner and my family gave it 2 thumbs up. I did a few very minor changes....
I used 1lb ground chicken breast, I did add 1 tsp of the chili paste and made the dipping sauce that one posted mentioned.  These are exactly like PF Changs!
Awesome, Thanks again.

I used ground chicken to make these more like PF Chang's. The overall sauce wasn't as dark or as thick as at PF Chang's, so for my personal preference next time I'm going to add more pickled ginger, more sesame oil, and probably more hoisin sauce. I decided the fried noodles were a luxury I could save for the restaurant and served ours with white rice and greenleaf lettuce to wrap. Although lettuce wraps can be tricky to manipulate (the sad state of the sorry lettuce I wind up with is what I'm thinking of here), this tastes good eaten with a fork and knife. Dipping sauce optional, but I REALLY like AR's "Sesame Dipping Sauce" recipe & recommend you make a tiny batch of that to serve alongside this meal. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! Of course I added my own spin on the recipe just like I do everything else. I added a bag of broccoli slaw to the beef mixture to have some extra veggies. I also added ponzu sauce and sweet thai chili sauce to the mix. I never measure my spices so I'm sure I added much more than the recipe called for. I also topped the mixture with crunchy chow mein noodles. It was perfect! Can't wait to make it again. I have a feeling this is going to become a regular craving. I might try it with cabbage leaves next time to do something different. Other meats might be good as well. This is definitely a recipe you can change to suit your taste.

This was amazing!  Totally cured the lettuce wrap craving, and the dipping sauce mentioned in one of the reviews is a must!  We used all of the ingredients except the chili sauce b/c I didn't have it.  So I put some red pepper flakes in the meat mix and a little ground red pepper in the dipping sauce. Was fabulous!

Good stuff! I added some pre shredded broccoli, carrots and cabbage to the mix and upped the wet ingredients to make more sauce.  I use the lite soy sauce to cut the salt and it was still a touch salty for my taste.  However, nobody else agreed with me, so maybe I'm crazy!!  Kids thought it was fun and hubby ate it with a fork after we ran out of lettuce :)

These were a great change from the same old dinners!  I get these sometimes at a Asian restaurant and mine turned out better!  I did add mushrooms and zucchini as well used spicy Italian sausage out of the casing instead of ground beef!

These were good - I felt that they needed more sauce. Made with a mixture of pork sausage and ground beef but would like to try with only pork or ground turkey.

Absolutely fantastic!  We loved the flavour and simplicity of this dish.  I used butter lettuce leaves for the wrapping; the filling consisted of 1 lb chicken (thinly sliced), 4 cloves of diced garlic, 1/2 onion diced, sliced cabbage (double amount as onion), 1/2 sliced yellow pepper, 2 handfuls of bean sprouts and 9 shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced.  Sauce was 3 T light soy sauce, 1/4 cup hoisin, 2 T sesame oil and 3 T sriracha for spiciness.  This portion was enough was two AWESOME sidedish meals (for 2 people).  I totally recommend this recipe!

This is really good - made it with pork once and once with beef and liked both - also added grated carrots like other reviewers had.  Found Pickled Ginger (and other tricky ingredients) at my super Target, but think regular ginger would work just fine too.  Will add this recipe to my regular rotation.

Soooo good. I used chicken instead of beef and it was delicious. I left out the ginger but left everything else the same. I loved the chile pepper sauce in it, it gave it a great zing. I will absolutely make this again. I served it with the vegatable lo mein and crab rangoon III (both from Allrecipes.com).

Four of us ate these last night and we were not impressed.  If these are like PF Changs they should go out of business. Total pain to eat . I used the right lettuce and made exactly like the recipe  said.

Excellent! I have been on the hunt for a recipe like PF Chang's and they all lack flavor, but THIS one is delicious! I used chicken instead of ground beef, and powdered ginger because I didn't have pickled, and left out the chile pepper because I'm not good with spicy. These didn't even need a dipping sauce on the side! I served with crushed peanuts and brown rice. Will make again!

I usually replace the meat with cubed eggplant, TVP, even tofu.  I add garlic chili sauce and tons of green onion. I also used the soy dipping sauce others have mentioned. I served this on top of crispy, fried rice noodles and veggie fried rice on the side!! yum yum!

This is definitely a 5-star recipe if you follow the suggestion of other reviews to add shredded carrots and the spicy sauce (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 Tbl soy sauce, 2 Tbl rice vinegar and 1 T chili paste).  These additions completes the dish.

Oh my goodness, what a treat this is!  I had everything on hand to make this except for the ginger and intact lettuce leaves. I had some ginger paste in a tube that I used to get that flavor.  I had to serve this as a salad on top of a platter of lettuce, and instead of cooking the green onions, I sprinkled them along with shredded carrot for color on top of the meat. It looked gorgeous and tasted even better. Surprisingly, my hubby went nuts over this and found it hard to leave any for our daughter who was at a Girl Scout meeting! Thanks for sharing this Rachel!

I had to sub oyster sauce for the hoisin...I'd mistaken the bottle in the fridge and it was all I had. These are good...I made some with chicken and some with the beef as per the recipe. It wasn't the best EVER and lettuce wraps are just so messy, but everyone ate them.  My husband put cashews on his and really like that!

This recipe was okay, but not a winner in my book.  I thought the hoisin overpowered everything else and without clear instructions the onions cooked down to a mush.  It needs some tweaking to mirror restaurant style lettuce wraps.

These were so good! I used leftover pork I made in the crockpot (just cook a pork roast in beef broth in a crock pot, also a recipe from this site) and it was delicious. Much cheaper than wraps we order at restaurants. I didn't have hoisin sauce so used Oyster sauce and it was so delicious. I really can't say enough good things about this, it definitely satisfied my craving for lettuce wraps. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Fabulous! Only change I made was used ground chicken breast to lower calories and fat. (WW 5 pts instead of 8).

I had lettuce wraps several times at a popular Asian restaurant but had never made them myself til I found this recipe. I must say that it was so yummy! I was a little taken back by the fact that it called for ground beef because I had only eaten the kind with chicken but I decided to follow the recipes advice snd used it anyway. I wad pleasantly surprised at how good it was but I think I will try chicken or pork as well. The only changes I made were omitting the water chesnuts and substituted ground Ginger for the pickled Ginger. When the meat was spiced and done, I turned off the fire and added half a package of rainbow salad (red/white cabbage, carrots and broccoli) to add some crunch. I served it with some white Jasmin rice to complete the meal. I must say that my husband was impressed and raved over it! We will have this again!

Mmm. These were great! The 2 tsp of pickled ginger goes a long way, so if you don't like ginger, use 1 tsp. I prefer more heat so I added a tbs of chili oil. I created a peanut dipping sauce with 1/3 c peanut butter, 1 garlic clove, 2 tbs lime juice, 2 tbs soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp cayenne, and 1/3 cup water blended. It worked great!

Very interesting dish. Great for a hot summer night. My family wasn't impressed but I don't think these are "man food". I liked them a lot and would definitely eat these again. Hubby would too but since they are too different for him he'd like me to only do these once a year. I used ginger paste and chile puree with garlic paste since it's what I had on hand. Used freeze dried chives instead of green onion. Simply delicious and so easy. I still have a tendency though to want to wrap this in a pita or flour tortilla. They're good but it just seems weird eating it without bread. I've made this several times now and it scales down easily. I take this to work for lunch and it keeps well for a couple of days of meals. I'm even getting used to the lettuce idea as a wrap instead of bread : )

I'm confuse about this recipe but do you mixed the sauce and the meat together? Or you have them separate?

Good recipe! When compared to Pei Wei or PF Chang lettuce wraps, it felt like it was missing something…probably the extra sauce. But they are still excellent! Minor modifications: I didn’t have pickled ginger so I just grated a little fresh ginger. I put a little cooked jasmine rice on the lettuce, topped that with the meat mixture, then finished it off with a sprinkling of chopped cashews…just to make it a more “complete” meal. I strongly encourage using the hot chile sauce or paste to kick it up a notch. This recipe is a great at-home version of a popular Asian restaurant favorite!
***Side note: I will probably try using a sturdier lettuce next time. Bibb tore and was a little on the small side.

The recipe made as stated was a bit flat tasting for me. Add that to bland/neutral tasting lettuce and it's flavor was left wanting. Definitely improved with a healthy drizzle of spicy peanut sauce, which is how I'll make it if I ever have ground chicken on hand again.

Wow!  I made just a few changes due to dietary needs and what I had in my fridge and they turned out awesome!

I used ground turkey breast to reduce the cholesterol and fat, and I added some chopped portabello mushrooms and omitted the oil and chili pepper (didn't miss it) but other than that followed the recipe.  I didn't see the need to cook the veggies separate from the meat so I added them in once the meat was mostly cooked.

Also, I made a sauce of soy sauce, chili pepper sauce and hoisin sauce (to taste) and they tasted so close to PF Changs that I'll never order them out again!

OMG!!!  These taste EXACTLY like P.F. Chang's chicken lettuce wraps!  I substituted 1 pound of ground chicken for the beef and also substituted 1/2 tsp of fresh minced ginger for the pickled kind (grocery store didn't have any).   No dipping sauce is necessary because the lettuce wraps are soooooo delicious.

Very good!!! I used ground chicken- & just browned it along with the oil,garlic, onion, & water chestnuts. Left out the green onions since I didn't have any. Combined all the sauce ingredients (including sesame oil) in a small bowl & then added to the chicken mixture. Heat through & you're done! Used iceberg leaves- dry & chill in the freezer for a few minutes to make 'em crisp! I always get honey chicken at Pei Wei, but now I can make these myself at home & it's easy! Now I see why so many order them at PW/PF Chang's. (P.S.- Used regular minced ginger in a jar)

Yum! I used ground chicken instead of the beef and powdered ginger instead of fresh (stronger flavor). The key is to making it in advance, as the flavors are KILLER the next day.

I love this recipe. While it may be messy, the taste surely isn't missed out on. Had to omit pickled  ginger due to not being able to find any, but nothing changed very much, taste-wise. I usually add a dash of cayenne powder for extra spice, and in the end wrap it all up in Boston Bibb lettuce leaves, like suggested. Great party food or for a light entree, will be making this again.

Never had P.F. Chang's, but heard a lot about them, so thought I'd give it a whirl!  Didn't have sesame oil, so just used 2 tsp. canola & added toasted sesame seeds.  Also subbed ground ginger.  Used 99% lean ground turkey & put in the food processor to finely grind (after cooked & cooled).  Also chopped onions, water chestnuts, & green onions in food processor to save time.  Added a little extra hoisin & soy (mostly bc I had a little extra meat).  Tasty by itself--can't wait till dinner in bibb lettuce!

So yummy!  Made for some friends- enjoyed by all.  Served with the Best Peanut Sauce and Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site.  Swapped out the Asian chili sauce for some Thai Garlic Chili Paste, and also used chopped chicken.  Definitely a keeper!

This was okay. I left out the ginger because I usually don't like it. It would be better with  ground chicken or pork. The beef overwhelms the hoisin flavors. Good idea though.

I've made this several times now and its alway's a hit.  The first time I made it just like the recipe calls for but found it to need more sauce and the ground meat tended to absorb lots.  After a bit of tweeking..I double the sauce and used chopped chicken breast.  The recipe never ceases to be gobbled up by everyone.  I also used crunchy noodles with them.  I'm a lover of Joey Tomatoe's Lettuce wraps and this satisfies my cravings.

These were so yummy Rachel and totally fun to eat.  I skipped on the chestnuts (not Charlie's favorite) and used Boston Bibb and Romaine.  I also made my own dipping sauce using most of the ingredients above but adding a few additional items.  I made a large pot of rice and we assembled these with a spoonful of rice, drizzled the dipping sauce over and ended with a spoonful of the meat mixture.  These were so much fun to eat.  Thanks for submitting.

Love this recipe as is.  Couldn't find Boston Bibb so used Romaine.  Fell apart so I made a salad and added meat on top.  Next time I will find a market with Bibb Lettuce.  Delicious dish.

This was a huge hit with the husband! I omitted the chile pepper sauce because I couldn't find it anywhere, but it definitly needs something for a kick, so maybe I would add red pepper flakes. Over all great, easy, and something good thing to liven up your week day meals!

These are just like the lettuce wraps you can find at restaurants. I like using about 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef.

So good - 2 of us ate all 4 servings in one sitting!  Used lean ground turkey instead of beef.  Didn't have hoisin, so used a mix of ketchup, soy and honey which worked just fine.  Was a fun dinner to prepare - one person preps, one does the skillet, and then you have fun making the wraps.

I've been on a meatless kick lately, so I substituted about 3 cups of finely chopped and sauteed button mushrooms for the ground beef. I also substituted about 1 teaspoon of ground ginger for the pickled ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for the chili sauce (they were already in my pantry). I thought this recipe had a lot of great flavor, and it's fun to eat, albeit a little messy.

This is my favorite recipe from this site! It is so good & you feel like your are eating something yummy even when you are doing a low carb diet. I have done this recipe with ground chicken & ground pork too and it's always good. We prefer iceberg lettuce over bibb/butter lettuce as it has more crunch to it. Also I have never found pickled ginger so I just substitute ground ginger.

As is 4 stars... with modifications- 10 stars! No need to ever brown beef in oil, but added 1 minced onion w/ a little garlic. Made sauce how others have (2 tbsp soy, 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp chili garlic sauce, 1-2 tsp sesame oil & 2 tbsp hoisin) MAKE SURE TO ADD THE HOISIN..holds the majority of the flavor. Added bamboo shoots & sauteed mushrooms, as well. With modifications it was phenomenal! I ate it w/o the lettuce! I now make bi-weekly!

I've made this recipe twice now and absolutely love it! The sauce for the meat mixture has wonderful flavor. I didn't do any onions since I don't care for them. I diced up a bunch of mushrooms (portabellas, but others would be good too) and sauteed them up instead of the onions at that stage before adding the beef and sauce. I used fresh ginger instead of pickled as well. The first time I didn't use water chestnuts but I did the 2nd time. They added a bit of crunch but didn't really do anything either way for me so I'll leave them out next time. I added shredded carrots and cucumber on top of the meat mixture in the wrap for freshness and crunch. Next time I will try some chopped toasted peanuts and a little bit of scallions (green part only) for more flavor and crunch. I also made the knockoff PF Chang sauce another reviewer mentioned - that is great! 

And finally, I HIGHLY recommend the butter/Boston/Bibb lettuce leaves. I couldn't find it the first time and used a romaine leaf. They were okay, but too crunchy with the rib of the lettuce. The butter lettuce was perfect and exactly the texture and taste I was craving. Thanks for submitting this recipe - it is now a go-to meal even with my meat and potatoes-loving husband!

The wraps were excellent but I used a little extra Hoisin Sauce to spice up the taste. The Butter Lettuce gives a nice sweet taste to offset the spicy aspects of the filling.

I followed reviewers' suggestions and used 1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste.

If I were to remake this:
- I would try using ground pork instead for a more authentic feel (traditionally, this dish is made with pork)
- I would use only 1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar as I felt the meat came out a little bit too sour for my taste

This still didn't quite as good as the way my dad would make it, but it was still good. I'll have to ask him for his recipe!

What a recipe! The flavor the meat gave off after allowing it to simmer in all the ingredients was really wonderful. I keep myself (and my kids) from snitching it out of the pan. I gave this four stars because one step change (not ingredient) would make this less greasy, as many reviewers have mentioned. Do drain the ground beef- it makes all the difference. Do not, however, sautee the onions in the beef pan without cleaning it out first. This will eliminate the extra grease. Another tip to save time: Once the onions are sauteeing, mix all the other ingredients that go in the pan in one bowl. Then just pour it in when the onions are ready.  We double wrapped our lettuce leaves because they were thin. Lastly, do let it cool down a bit before you wrap up the wraps. Leftovers are good cold! Thanks a million, Rachel.  Will be making this repeatedly.

im a big fan, really really good.  I just followed instructions rather than modify and it tasted great.  I also used romaine instead, which was fine.

This is a great recipe. I've made it as is, and I've made variations of it. It's great with Turkey Breast or Ground Pork. I always double the liquids..for extra sauce. For my Husband and Daughter I serve it over brown rice..but I like it with Bibb lettuce. Great, quick dinner!

I skipped the chile sauce because I was afraid it would be too spicy for me.  Without it, I think the dish was a little bland, so when I make this again, I will definitely use some of the chile sauce.

Love. Love. Love these. I tend to order lettuce wraps whenever we go to the Cheesecake Factory and these were just as good as theirs.  Never even thought of making my own lettuce wraps till I stumbled upon this recipe !  That's what I love about allrecipes.com.  Gives you the guts to try new things ! Thanks Rachel for the recipe !!!

Yumm-0!!!  Almost like being at Chef Chu's for dinner ... my guests are still talking about them.  Added a little cut zuccini to the mix with water chestnuts.  Served side dish of hoisin and chopped green onions, combining the best of all worlds.

my boyfriend and i loved this recipe! i used ground chicken to make it healthier, and i didn't have water chestnuts so i omitted those, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. i have never made any kind of asian food so i was nervous but they turned out perfect! thanks for sharing. next time i will be sure to add the water chesnuts, and probably add bean sprouts and carrots as someone suggested for more color and texture.

Very nice. Thank you for sharing this recipe Rachel.  I also used ground pork and ground chicken at other time too.  Ran out of pickled ginger so I use ginger powder too and that also turned out great too.

This was very good. I used ground chicken due to diet restrictions, and it was great.  I also made a small amount meatless for the vegetarian, using chopped fresh broccoli, bean sprouts, chopped snow pea pods, chopped carrots, chopped green pepper (a small amount), and chopped celery. Prepared it the same way by sauteing the vegies first, except the bean sprouts, which were added with the green onion just to heat them but keep crispness.

Phenomenal! This tastes very similar to a certain chain that we have eaten at. Very tasty. The first time I made it I couldn't find any hoisin sauce locally and it was good. Once I finally found the hoisin sauce and made it again...oh man, was it delish! My mouth waters just thinking of it. I made it exactly as is, no changes. Thank you for the recipe!!

Very easy & delicious recipe. I used ground turkey meat for a lighter version. I found this dish to be a little lacking in flavor, but just added a bit of extra soy sauce to make up for it.

I used pickled ginger for this recipe and it absolutely ruined it!!!!  I used a very small amount of ginger just because I didn't like the smell of it (I am wierd with smells) and it still was overwhelming.  However, I could imagine this dish WITHOUT THE GINGER and I do believe it would be delicious.  I will try again next week without the ginger and see what I think of it.  I also used chicken.

I LOVED this recipe! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used soy crumbles instead of beef and it was delicious! I followed the directions as they are written, just didn't use quite so much garlic. I also made the accompanying dressing (2 T soy sauce, 2 T rice vinegar, 2 tsp sesame oil, 1.5 tsps sugar, 1 tsp chili paste, and about a teaspoon of minced onion) and that really made the meal 5 stars. This recipe is going into my favorites folder! Thanks!

I made these last week because for weeks I've seen it in the "What's for dinner" Buzz  thread.   I used 90% lean ground beef.  I followed the recipe except i used crushed red pepper instead of the thai pepper paste because that was what i had.  DH loved them and wants them again.  DS ate them without lettuce and was happy.  I thought the taste was good, not great.  I also thought they were greasy.  Haven't decided if I will make them again.  Thank you Racel for the recipe.

I made this changing it a little based on what I had on hand.  I didn’t have pickled ginger so I used some ground ginger and I didn’t have water chestnuts, so I left those out.  Since we’d be missing out on the crunch the water chestnuts would have provided, I added some wonton strips for crunch.  Five stars for flavor, however they are very messy to eat.  Perhaps Hubs and I are just not accomplished lettuce wrap eaters, but we had a pretty tough time.  We probably would have done better with a knife and fork, but that would defeat the purpose, wouldn’t it?  From that standpoint, I probably won’t be making these again any time soon, but I’m glad I tried them.

Simple, delicious, perfectly balanced flavors.  I have been looking for a recipe like PF Changs -- this is very close!    If you like it hotter, just add more another dash or two of chile pepper sauce to match your personal preference.  We loved it, and I would not change a thing.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was soooo delicious!  I did not have ginger or chili pepper sauce, did not have in the grocery store that day. Will definitely make again with missing ingredients and add some peanuts for extra crunch. Hubby and my two toddlers loved it! Hubby was very impressed! Good thing I doubled recipe, we were able to eat two nights in a row. We placed on top of jasmine rice instead of lettuce!
Update: I have made these at least 5 more times since the first time. Romaine lettuce works perfect! You fill it and roll it like a taco! Super delicious!

very easy made as written except for the chile pepper sauce and used powdered ginger instead of the pickled, it was very good but I think I would like it better with chicken.  I needed a dipping sauce for mine but my hubby added cashews to his for some texture and it was yummy! I ended up just eating it without the lettuce, with little extra hoisin sauce delicious!

Tried these tonight and they were excellent. Didn't use the green onions or chile sauce because we didn't have them,  but they were still very yummy without it. Will definitely make again, quick and easy.

Really good! I didn't have hoisin sauce so I used teriyaki, and opted for fresh ginger instead of pickled, and used a sweet chili sauce.  It was delicious! I liked the extra crunch from the fresh ginger. Even used reduced sodium sauces and it was still phenomenal!

I made these last night and I loved them. My kids did not...It was just alien to them lol. I made mine useing chopped pork loin and added in some chopped cashews for more crunch then followed the rest of the recipe. Before wrapping I drizzled more Hoisen sauce. I also made the sauce other viewers suggested using shiracha pepper sauce...WOW!! I cant say I will make these again unless I can find a way to make it more appealing to my kids. But glad I made them.  Maybe next time I will make it up and throw in broccoli and snow peas and lose the lettuce...making them think its more like stir fry, which they love. The flavor of this and the sauce was wonderful.

Great recipe, but a little bland. I added bell peppers, matchstick carrots, and celery to it. I also put in an extra table spoon of hoisin sauce, a couple more teaspoons of rice vinegar, about a tablespoon of lime juice and a tad more ginger. It was perfect!

I love this recipe! I hate when people change the recipes and then rate the  that they made but I added matchstick carrots(note to self-buy pre- made cuz they are a pain). And although it was fun to stuff the mixture into the leaves at the end I just shredded the lettuce and threw it in with the rest. Next ime I will do the same and on of favorite with rice.I can play around with the heat top with hot chili oil or add red pepper flakes) but the kids and hubby are babies. Next time diced chicken? I'm excited to fiddle with it.

I had the pleasure of making this dish for my husband and I for dinner the other night. It was the first time I had ever had the Asian wraps and they were wonderful. I followed the directions to a tee and made the dipping sauce suggested and it went well with the wraps. We added Asian noodles to give it a twist. Served with a fresh fruit salad and wine. One of the best meals thus far. A must try!!!!

These were very delicious. The only thing I changed was that I only had Romaine lettuce to use for the wraps. It worked just fine.

Also, I let each person put their own amount of the chili sauce on each wrap by putting the bottle on the table with a small spoon. That way those who like it spicy can have it spicy and those who don't...well, they don't!

Great recipe. For those who can't find pickled ginger, it's also called sushi ginger in the asian aisles of the stores.

needs more crunch!  I added broccoli slaw, thinly sliced cucumber, chopped cliantro, green onions, and thinly sliced red pepper to my final lettuce wrap and it was excellent!  I liked the sauce in the recipe and opted to make mine with ground pork and it was great.  Also, I didn't add any chili paste as my kids don't like spicy, but they CHOWED DOWN on these as our friday night treat before dinner.  Great job!

great recipe - wanted a healthier alternative, so used ground turkey instead of beef.  didn't have green onions, so i subbed diced yellow onions.  i also had some fresh mushrooms on hand, so diced them up and threw them in there as well. didn't have pickled ginger either so used fresh ginger, about 1 tsp.  husband and i like a kick so added about 1 tbsp of Sriracha hot sauce - fantastic recipe and simple to make!  thanks for sharing!

My family and I thought this was incredible! I did not have pickled ginger so I omitted it. After making it I realized there was not enough sauce for our liking so I tripled the hoisin, soy sauce, and rice vinegar (didnt have rice wine vinegar & dont know if its the same or not) Sooo yummy!

Made as is except for substituting fresh ginger for the pickled. Very flavorful and delicious, will be using this recipe repeatedly in the future for dinners and to serve to guests.

Very, very good!  I would recommend cutting down on the amount of Sesame Oil and not that it was strong, the flavor was good but it left the mixture a little too oily. I also added bean sprouts and shredded carrot for extra veggies. Next time I will add even more, like sweet peppers.

Delicious! I used ground chicken breast instead of beef and it tasted great! *tip- if you shop at Publix, they have pickled ginger at the sushi counter.

My husband and I really loved these!  I did not have any green onions so I used white onion and I also didn't have any fresh ginger so I used about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  Even with the changes it was delicious!  Next time I'll be sure to have all the correct items to make it perfect!

I wanted to love this, but I guess we aren't huge fans of hoisin sauce. I'll stick to my chicken and prawn lettuce roll up recipe. Thanks for posting, always trying new recipes!

Absolutely delicious. Next time, I'll probably use thinly-sliced skirt steak instead of the ground beef (personal preference), and marinate it in the soy sauce mixture before cooking. The flavor was outstanding. I'll most definitely be making these again!

This recipe was INCREDIBLE!  LOVED it!  It is very versatile as well. I liked this recipe so much that had to write a review despite a few unavoidable ingredient alterations.  I Have never had pickled ginger but the regular worked just fine, Thai garlic paste instead of the Asian chile pepper sauce and regular sesame oil instead of dark. The ingredients are similar so I don't think it altered the taste drastically.  Everything else was exactly what the recipe called for and the flavors were awesome, nothing too overpowering, everything blended very well.  The water chestnuts added a nice little crunch as well!  This recipe is definitely a keeper! I have never been to PF Chang's so I cannot compare but who cares?!! This is an excellent asian dish to make at home without the expense of going out.  FINALLY I have found a recipe for my ground beef that is not swimming in cream of mushroom sauce!  I have to say I am not a real spicy food person so being able to adjust the spiciness was very helpful.  We served it on the boston bib lettuce and layered it with some white rice from my rice cooker.  I used 3# of ground beef and tripled the sauce recipe. We did NOT serve any sauce with it.  The meat is flavored so well I really felt it would distract from the taste. Even the rice did not dilute the taste. Excellent!

We LOVED these!  I am a huge fan of lettuce wraps but have always been hesitant to attempt them.  Not anymore! These were delicious, very easy, and make for a beautiful meal. I used ground turkey instead of beef and left out the optional pepper sauce and they turned out beautifully.  I can't wait to make them again!

LOVED this recipe.  Used all suggested ingredients, however i also added about a tsp of fresh ginger.  I used about 3 tbsp of chili sauce.  Like other users, I too used ground chicken instead of beef.  It had all the flavour and about half the fat.  I wouldn't do it any other way.  I made this recipe in the morning and re heated it for dinner.  It tasted just as great!  This is a must have recipe for those nights where time is of the essence.

Fantastic!!  I following the recipe totally.  I did cook the onions with the meat and then drained off all but about two table spoons of grease.  Also used 90% lean meat.    I used butter lettuce, organic,  next time will try a firmer lettuce.  My husband had the leftover for lunch the next day, sans lettuce, with cheddar slice melted on top.  Loved it

I used iceberg because I already had it available. It was do-able, not the best lettuce to use though. I thought the amount of soy sauce and hoisin sauce combo was too sweet. Didn't use rice wine vinegar, water chestnuts. Added sliced red pepper. Used grated fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger and fresh chopped Thai chili peppers instead of chili pepper sauce.

These were wonderful!  We were at PF Changs the following night and my husband refused to order the lettuce wraps because he said they couldn't possibly compare to the homemade ones.  I made only one change and that was to use ground turkey in place of the beef. Great to be able to make these at home!

These were really awesome!  We love to get them at P.F. Chang's, and while I don't think they were quite that good, they were close!  They were also really easy to make.  The grocery store was out of the recommended types of lettuce so we had to use iceberg and it was fine.

This was tremendously good, however, I did what other reviewers said about the sauce: Soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili paste and sesame oil - the hoisin was omitted as per other reviewers. I made two batches; vegetarian crumbles were used for one and the other was chicken. When I told my husband what we were eating he didn't seem too enthusiastic, however, once the sauce began cooking he said his mouth began watering. My 9yr old son and he went on and on about how wonderful the meal was. Between the three of us there were NO leftovers! My husband has requested this dish again and has asked that I make this when his folks come into town. Try it - you WON'T be disappointed. Thank you!!!

Really great!  We love lettuce wraps, and took this over to a friend's house for a get-together - it was a hit!  Definitely make the dipping sauce recommended by other reviewers, and make the Thai peanut sauce on this website too.

These are fabulous!  I used fresh ginger instead of pickled and ground pork instead of beef.  The last time we had them we only had iceberg lettuce so it ended up being "lettuce cups" but still tasted great!  We make this over and over!

Hands down this is one of the best recipes I've tried on Allrecipes. Easy to make, full of flavor and healthy dinner or appetizer. Used fresh ginger and added shredded carrots and increased the soy sauce to about 3Tbsp. Severed with crushed peanuts and sweet and sour dip. PF Changs watch out... Yummy. Thanks Ms. M

Waaaaaay too much ses. oil. It overpowered the recipe. With a few adjustments this may be OK, but there are so many more recipes that are GREAT, that I will not be making this again.

This is definitely a recipe to go into the regular rotation.  I used ground chicken instead of beef and made a double batch.  I didn't add the pepper sauce but used some freshly ground black pepper.  A little more rice vinegar or pickled ginger would give it that extra tang that I prefer.  I served it with a choice of lettuce leaves or steamed white rice.

These were great.  I used an asian marinade I found at The Fresh Market that had all the ingredients of the sauce.  I browned one lb of ground pork, onion and garlic and then just added the marinande to the pan with a little seame oil, heated through. Served with chopped scallion greens and crunchy fried rice noodles. YUMMY!

Definitely make the sauce as suggested by another reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste)...in my opinion, the sauce makes this a 5-star recipe!

These were delish! I accidentally made them a little too spicy for my kids, but they still ate them. I had candied ginger and used that instead of pickled. I also didn't have hoisin sauce so I googled a recipe for that and it turned out very good: 4 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp peanut butter, 1 Tbsp honey, 2 tsp rice or white vinegar, 1/4 tsp garlic, 2 tsp sesame oil, 1/8 tsp pepper,  and chinese hot sauce to taste. I just added the whole mixture bc I had a little more than a pound of beef. I will definitely make these again. (A little less spicy though!)

These were a huge hit for an Asian party that I had. The only thing I did different was to add some of the prepackaged Thai seasoning blend found in most grocery stores. It is usally found near the fresh herb section. It comes in packages that include chile paste, basil and garlic. The flavor was outstanding. I also made a peanut sauce found on another recipe site with it http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Vegetable-Summer-Rolls-105012 Everyone asked for the recipe. I can't wait to have them again!

Awesome! I used ground turkey breast and it was still fantastic. It was so simple to make, I'll definitely make this again. My husband doesn't like ginger so I omitted it and added 3 T of sweet chili sauce.

I wish I could give it 10 stars!! Great recipe, and it has become a family favorite. However, I did make a few changes. I added green onion, cilantro, sirachi chili sauce,  regular ginger verus the pickled stuff, cumin, shredded carrots, lemon grass, thai basil, sesame seeds, and a bit of oyster sauce. LOVE LOVE!!

Delicious! We used half the onion, substituted oyster sauce for hoisin and used iceberg lettuce in place of Boston or Bibb. We also made some Basmati rice and added that with the meat mixture to the lettuce leaves (iceberg leaves are much larger). Also added some toasted sesame seeds. YUM! My husband was not too crazy about trying this but after eating it said "oh yeah! We'll be making this again."

Very good! I used low sodium soy sauce, fresh ginger instead of pickled, omitted the green onions out of preference, and I actually used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I did have to add a little more soy sauce, as I found the hoisin sauce a little overpowering. We really enjoyed these, I will make again. Thank you!

The entire family gave this one a thumbs up and requested to have it again next week.  I made a couple of changes after reading the reviews and to add my own flair.  First, while heating up the cooking oil I added a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes in order to add a little spice to the meat while it was cooking.  Because an individual I was feeding is allergic to onion, I added a red pepper instead.  I also used fresh grated ginger and a tablespoon of sherry instead of rice vinegar which I like to do in making a lot of Asian dishes because the sherry adds a softer taste than vinegar.  To serve: I put out the lettuce leaves, a bowl full of cashews, a bowl full of shredded carrots, and a bowl full of thinly sliced cucumber so everyone could assemble their own.  Definitely fun, delicious, and different.  Only drawback: a little messy!

DH and I enjoyed this for dinner last night, but we both agreed that it would taste better with either ground chicken or pork. I used less onion and hoisin sauce, no water chestnuts or green onion, and 1 Tbs fresh ginger. I think shredded carrots would taste good in the wrap too. Will definitely make this again.

What can I say? These were, by far, some of the best homemade lettuce wraps I've had. I've made this for me and my wife over a half dozen times and each time it's a great meal. I've made this with ground pork, ground turkey, and ground sausage, with turkey being my favorite version. I have pickled ginger in the house, but have gone to using fresh minced ginger since it adds a much milder flavor. Otherwise, I rarely change this it's so good. I have used the deep fried rice vermicelli and they truly, add a wonderful aspect to the wrap. My toddler daughter could live off those if I let her (but I don't). I have used the meat mixture in steamed dumplings and that has turned out great. You just need to mince the water chestnuts and green onions more so you don't have these odd chunks in your dumplings.

I had a pound of ground pork sausage, so I used that instead of ground beef. It was delicious and I made the sauce that was mentioned by another reviewer. Wow! I loved the whole thing! I also left out the ginger because I don't care for it.

I have made this 3 times now.  This first time I made as the recipe states, the next two times I made with ground turkey.  So far we love the ground turkey.  I add a little more Soy and Hoisin sauce for our preferences.  I also add the pickled ginger as a topping on my wrap.  This is one of our favorite dishes to eat. We also LOVE the Avacado Taco recipe from this site.

I was so excited to find this recipe as its one of my favorite things to order when I go to PF Changs or Hoolihans. My husband wasn't sure he was going to like it but we both were very happy with the results. I did use ground turkey instead of the beef and it was great!

Delicious!!  Very similar to PF Changs lettuce wraps when made with chicken.  The following are the changes I made: I used 1 lb boneless chicken breast, cooked and chopped, I used 1 tsp of ground ginger instead of pickled ginger and double the sauce ingredients, except for the sesame oil.  I used 1T of Asian Chili Sauce.  Also added about 8 small mushrooms, chopped.  Will definitely make again!!!

Absolutely perfect recipe, as-is -- easy, uniquely fun, and a huge crowd pleaser. Following reviewers' advice, I used Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site (doubling the recipe). For side dishes, I cantaloupe slices plus bowls of rice and [store-bought] Chow Mein noodles worked well. Thanks, Caroline C and All Recipes!

This recipe is absolutely incredible!  I'm not big fan of ground pork, so contrary to a lot of other reviewers, I liked the flavor of the ground beef in this recipe.  This dish is excellent--I ate half of it in one sitting by myself!  It's a great meal for high protein diet.

Very good recipe. Nice flavors without any overkill. The are the best i have tried so far and my standards are pretty high. However, I did use ground turkey for mine and added a bit of chopped shrimp. I had a bit of the mixture left over so i used the rest to make pot stickers (folded in wanton wraps then steamed them) which turned out FABULOUS.

These were delicious!  We used ground pork, and I think if I'd used chicken, I would've liked them even more.  We followed the recipe exactly as written and these were great!  A lot like PF Chang's.  ****Second Attempt:  This time I used ground chicken and added cilantro and one chopped up mushroom...they were outstanding!  We are adding this to the rotation!

This recipe was really easy to make since I had most ingredients on hand to begin with. I made mine with veggie crumbles - yum! I'd never used hoisin sauce before, so I don't know if I just don't like the flavor or if I got a yucky brand, but I found myself trying to cover up the flavor a bit - not easy, since it's essentially the sauce's base. I added lots of sriracha, extra garlic, and a healthy amount of cashews too. Doubling the sauce is a must. Terrific recipe, easy to make, and impressive final product! Thanks for the recipe - it's cured my PF Changs craving :)  UPDATE: I made these a second time using homemade hoisin sauce, and it was even better. There are more complicated lettuce wrap recipes out there, but why bother? This one is simple, vegan-friendly, and well-liked by everyone who's tried them.

Good but not great.  I am somewhat of an amatuer when it comes to oriental dishes so it is quite possible that I got something wrong.  The amount of pre-prepared ingredients also makes me suspect that the overall quality of the dish is heavily dependent on the quality of the ingredients (if my hoisin sauce is bad the dish will be bad).  I can see that this recipe has a lot of potential as a strong base for other lettuce wrap recipes.

These wraps taste just like P.F. Changs! I doubled up on the lettuce, to make the wraps more sturdy and I used ground lean turkey instead of the beef, and they were just delicious!

Great recipe.  I like the crunchiness the waterchestnuts add.  It is a bit involved but very good.  For something less involved without sacrificing flavor, try Oriental Express Beef Lettuce Wraps on this site.  I serve this with Sri Racha chili sauce and white calrose rice on the side for filler.

This was an exceptional recipe. I love that the seasoning wasn't overpowering but was definitely there. It was Gluten Free Friendly which is also a plus. We fried up some rice noodles for crunch and chopped some cilantro for a little extra for "topping" as well. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe and plan on following it in the future as there is nothing to improve on. Kudos!

My family was impressed and they all asked for the recipe. My husband even said it tasted just like the version he gets at his favorite restaurant. This is going in my box.

I'm late in reviewing this as I've made it about 3 times. I love this  recipe and so does my sister in law and husband. I use iceberg lettuce by request of others but they do fall apart once in a while. 
I add a little extra hoisin sauce and I use ground chicken instead and use those crunchy noodles to put on top as well. Very tasty!!

OH MY GOSH, sooooooooooooo GOOD! Used butter lettuce, and topped with shredded carrots, and bean sprouts. Used plum sauce, and the Spicy Peanut Sauce from this site as dipping sauces. Very healthy and fun!

I made these to take to a get-together with friends.  It was easy and turned out perfect - everyone really liked them.  I used iceburg lettuce for crispness as others have suggested.  Instead of pickled ginger, I used fresh ginger.  Also, I added more of each liquid, because it seemed so dry.  I used ground turkey - everyone said they thought it was ground beef.  Even my husband liked them - and he is a very picky eater.  Will make again - SOON!

Like many of the reviewers, I used regular ginger instead of the way-overpriced pickled ginger.  Substituted celery for onion, carrots for water chestnuts.    Followed the recipe amount for liquids and it came out fine.  Will try next time with some other meat.

Excellent! I'm always flipping through the Manhattan take-out menus trying to find lettuce wraps, and I can never find them! I substituted ground turkey for the beef (on a health kick at the moment), added some water (the mixture started to get thick and stick to the pan after adding the hoisin), and added some Mirin (Japanese sweetened rice wine) to get a touch more sweetness. I may use less garlic next time. They turned out wonderfully! However, despite my efforts to make this meal healthy, all the sugar in that hoisin sauce CAN'T be good for you -

I thought this was great. I used Morningstar imitation burger crumbles as I am a vegetarian. I was also generous with all of the sauces, especially sesame oil and hoisen sauce and added toasted sesame seeds. To eat I provided matchstick carrots, sweet bell peppers, and pickled radish on Red leaf lettuce. I also served a peanut sauce and a fermented red chili paste as a spread/dip.

This was the best thing I've ever tasted! I substituted ground lean turkey instead of beef to make it a bit healthier. I added more hoisin also, after I added the meat (the recipe leaves out when to add the meat and should be edited.) My family thought these were better than P.F Chang's!! Also I used regular ginger root instead of pickled ginger because it's hard to find but when I did find it, it was a little expensive.

I really like this recipe.  I had a party with asian appetizers and this was one of the recipes I made.  We put asian coleslaw in the lettuce wraps also and it made it really delicious.  I did double the sauce recipe, used fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger and used a fairly heavy dose of the asian chili pepper sauce .  I will definently make the lettuce wraps again.

Absolutely amazing. This recipe has it all... great flavor, it's easy to make, and it's even fun to eat! I didn't change a single thing about the recipe. I did serve the wraps with a side of garlic chili sauce because my boyfriend likes things spicy. It's not PF Changs recipe, but my boyfriend said he liked these better (and their lettuce wraps are the reason we go to PF Changs). I will make these over and over again. I can't wait to try ground chicken or turkey. Thank you thank you! 2/25/09: I ran out of lettuce leaves, so I boiled a whole head of green cabbage for a few minutes to soften the leaves and wrapped those around the filling. Sort of like Asian cabbage rolls! Really good this way, too.

Newbies be warned - if you're trying to make something similar to those famous Chicken Wraps by P. F. Chang's, this is not the recipe to use. That being said, these were still very good. Like many others I also used chicken instead of beef, although I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and chopped them up small instead of using ground chicken. If you go this route, make sure you add a bit extra of the other ingredients if you'd like a saucier mix. It also doesn't hurt to add chopped mushrooms as you saute the onions. I personally could have lived without the sesame oil - I found out I don't like the flavor while taking little tastes as the meal was cooking.

This was okay. I wasn't wowed by the flavor despite all that went into this dish. I did use lean ground turkey, so maybe that was the reason. It was a fun and messy dish, though. I served with jasmine rice and asian green beans.

My wife wanted me to give it five stars, and I wanted four--we'd give it 4.5 if that were an option.  It was really good.  I used ground pork because it seemed more Asian, a bit more sesame oil, rouch chopped the chestnuts, and used 4 cloves of garlic.  Also, I just used powdered ginger instead of pickled and it worked out well.  (can't find the pickled kind). That's not to say you should do it my way, just that the base recipe is a great one, and go with it.  I may make them again tonight.

This is an awesome recipe! Thanks Rachel for the perfect lettuce wrap recipe that I've been searching for! I used low fat ground chicken in place of the beef. They were so full of flavor. My husband & I scarfed them!
Very much like PF Chang's version, but they tasted much healthier and lower in sodium. Just fabulous! 
I did make the Oriental Dipping Sauce also on this site to use as a condiment. It was a nice complement.

This recipe was very easy to make. I sort of had a hard time rounding up all of the ingredients at our super market, but once we got home it was made rather quickly. We used ground chicken instead of beef. The one thing I would say is that it needed some type of sauce. I think I am going to look up a peanut sauce to make to go along with it. But, my husband loved this recipe and we plan on making it again!

Great and simple recipe.  We made it vegetarian by using a frozen soy product that is a meat substitute and it worked great.  Otherwise, we followed the directions.  We will definitely add this to our favorite menus.  Thanks!

These are fabulous.    I used ground chicken rather than ground beef and substituted fresh ginger for pickled ginger.  
I added some julienne carrot for crunch and freshness and some crushed peanuts for texture and flavor.   I can't wait to make these for dear friends who always choose PF Changs when asked "Where do you wanna go for dinner?".

My family liked this - my teenager gobbled it up. I used ground chicken and made my own hoisin sauce (recipe found on Allrecipes), since my husband can’t have gluten that’s in regular soy sauce. I’ll make it again.

Turned out wonderfully. My hubby is a picky eater: dislikes most veggies. I chopped veggies finely in Cuisinart food processor and used turkey as the meat. He loved it- no left overs. Will make this again- try chicken or lean ground beef.

Use the picked ginger, It makes a world of difference. Even if you don't think you will like it. Allrecipes: homemade pickled ginger (gari).

Made it once and loved it so much I made it again! Traded the beef for ground turkey and the second time I added pretty much more of everything including diced bell peppers just to get more veggies into my day. This is definitely now in the regular rotation!

I made these for dinner and they have potential. There is nothing wrong with the ingredients, just the amounts. Made as is, the dish is extremely bland. I had to put additional soy sauce, Sriracha, and salt. I cook to taste so I can't say exactly how much more but there is a good deal more of each.

Terrific recipe :) entire family loved it!  I followed tips from first couple reviewers and I also made with ground pork vs beef.  I sautéed the meat with the sauces and it was the bomb.

I'm not a foodie, but I am Chinese American. All I can say is... WOW. Usually when I try "Asian" recipes off allrecipes, something tastes a little off, not quite right. This one, spot on. No crazy ingredients like OJ, really good flavor.

I used venison instead of beef (we don't buy beef), fresh ginger, and omitted the chili sauce (my Caucasian husband doesn't do spicy). Two thumbs up!

Used Ground pork  and regular fresh ginger rather than pickled, and shredded some carrots to serve on top of everything.   
Definitely make the sauce  as suggested by another reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste) and green onion slices- might want to double the ingredients.  

Optional  to  make extra sauce on the side: 1/4 c plum sauce, a tbsp OJ, 1/2 tsp cornstarch, 1 tbsp teriyaki sauce--boil for 1 minute and let cool. Spread a bit on the meat mixture when eating--tastes amazing.

Great go-to recipe for large groups!  This was a hit at our Friday night gathering.  I used ground turkey and fresh ginger, and I used romaine lettuce instead of Bibb lettuce cause I couldn't find any Bibb lettuce, and romaine is more nutritious than iceberg and sturdier.  I also left out the water chestnuts because I don't like them.  Also made the sauce on the side for people who wanted it.

Kids loved it!  I doubled the sauce and kept it separate from the meat so I could use the leftover meat for tacos tomorrow.  Even with doubled sauce, we ran out with 2 adults and 4 kids eating.  I added shredded carrots and chopped celery to the sauce since my can of chestnuts expired in 2012...yuck.

Here is what's missing. Fresh squeezed lime juice, red onion instead of white onion, and peanuts to top it off.  I made with ground chicken and these modifications. Simply perfect.

This is a fantastic recipe. I replace the green onions with baby bok choi finely chopped. You can blanch the bok choi first you don't have to. You can replace the hamburger with ground turkey or even tofu for a completely veggie wrap. The trick to doing the rice noodles is to boil them just until they are loose and then run them under cold water in a colander. My family likes these served alongside fried potstickers.

Couple tweaks just based on what was in the house - ground turkey instead of beef, fresh ginger, and what I thought was hoisin sauce in my pantry turned out to be teriyaki, so I used that and the dish was still very tasty. Put shredded carrots and green onions on top for a few extra veggies...Can't do spicy, so left out the chile sauce.

Delicious! I made a few changes/additions and the result was perfection. I used ground chicken and fresh ginger. Don't exclude the water chestnuts, they are integral to the dish! I also made crispy vermicelli which took this dish from a 4.5 stars to a 5/5. It's a quick add-on and really makes the recipes restaurant quality! Also, at the suggestion of another reviewer, I turned the leftovers into a salad, with hoisin sauce as the dressing -- amazing and not nearly as messy!!

Loved this! Took ideas from other posts: Added raw shredded carrots for crunch  and used soy crumble instead of beef just to be healthier.  Only trouble was wrapping w/ the lettuce, which broke easily. I would recommend laying ingredients on top of two lettuce leaves and then just folding taco style as you eat it.

These lettuce wraps are AMAZING. Nothing to change in this receipe other than adding a little more heat if you want, by putting an extra tbsp of chili paste. We make them all the time at home for supper, or a must to bring to a potlock! Everyone will love them! We prefer to use the romaine lettuce hearts when eating them, but any lettuce will do. Also can be served with rice!

Love this. recipe.  But MUST use Boston Bib lettuce.  I used a hot chili sauce and the pickled ginger is a must.  I decreased the sesame oil to 1 tsp and increased soya to 2 tablespoons.  This is so yummy!

I was nervous about this recipe but wow it really was very good. I used ground turkey since I don't eat beef and I didn't have any hoisin sauce so I used peanut sauce which had similar ingredients. This was so good. I also made the sauce recommended by others and didn't end up using it. My family didn't care for it. This recipe was good without anything else.

Sooooo good! My whole family loved it! I will be putting this into regular rotation. The only changes were from other reviews. I subbed ground pork for beef....next time I'll add peanuts and bean sprouts as others have suggested and maybe change the lettuce (I feel the butter head was too delicate) definitely a keeper!

I have to give this 5 stars!! For 2 reasons. 1- because although it seems a little intimidating at first glance, with all the different seasonings, it was actually very simple to make. 2 because I used chunks of pork in place of the ground beef :). What an amazing dish and so very pretty!! The flavor is amazing and I'll definitely make this pretty often. It was nice having it ready to eat while I was finishing up the main course. Everyone gathered around the plate and just nibbled and visited. Absolutely a hit!! Thank you!!

Tried this recipe after eating the wraps at PF Chang's for the second time - love these wraps! I made per the recipe except for subbing regular ginger root for the pickled ginger and I added about a cup of fine chopped mushrooms to cook down with the vegetables. I think I'll get the pickled ginger next time. I used iceberg lettuce for the wraps and I like the idea of making a salad of shredded lettuce then topping with the meat mixture and some sauce. I used ground turkey, but want to try ground pork also. Wonderful recipe! Thank you, Rachel!

We always order these for an appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants. The only thing I added was the fish sauce another reviewer recommended. Excellent recipe. Every bit as good if not better than any we have ever had at a restaurant.

This was very good.  I realized I was out of hoisin sauce after I started cooking - the meal tasted like it was missing something so it definitely needed it. It was simple with a little kick of heat.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I was unsure how much Chile paste so I went a little light.  Next time I will add more.  I didn't have green onions but I also added mushrooms.

After I tasted and adjusted seasonings, it was very good. I used ground turkey and had to add spicy Schezukian sauce, extra rice wine vinegar, and a little stir fry sauce to give it a better balance of sweet and spicy.

Too much hoisin sauce! I found it to be overpowering. I think chicken would work better than ground beef also. I wouldn't make this again without making some fundamental changes.

Instead of the ground beef, I used 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts; I used a pre-made Hawaiian marinade and grilled them.  I also had "cole slaw" mix (no dressing) to add to the wraps. This was a huge hit!  Also chopped up some cashews for added crunch. Something different and light!

Great recipe! A keeper. :) The water chestnuts gave a fantastic crunchy texture to the dish - so I highly recommend putting them! I just want to ask the creator - where was the shredded carrots and white topping in the recipe? I notice it was on the photo.

I really liked this recipe. It had a unique flavour and was easy to make - my kids really liked it too! I didn't have water chestnuts on hand so I used celery instead to give it a nice crunch. Even better reheated as a leftover after the flavours mingled together. Thanks for this great recipe!

I loved this recipe and followed it almost 100%.  The only differences I made were to use ground turkey and added a little more Hoisin.  My local market has butter lettuce in the "still alive" packaging so the leaves were perfect.  Eating is a little messy but very tasty and fun.  This can be as healthy or filling as you want so be creative.  I'm on a pretty strict diet and this was perfect for weekend lunch.  No need to switch up the sauce!

I love lettuce wraps especially those from the Cheesecake Factory. I just tried this recipe substituting chicken breast cut into small pieces. It was delicious. Next time I would also add crushed peanuts or chopped cashews as well. Thanks It was worth the time invested in the kitchen.

Delicious! I too grated some carrots and used them as a topping and added saracha sauce to the mixture and left it on the table for my hothead husband. I would just buy romaine lettuce, so you get a better lettuce to filling ratio, not to mention the butter lettuce leaves get tiny fast and costs $1-2 more a head. Thanks for the great recipe.

I always double the sauce and instead of meat, add diced firm tofu and cellophane noodles.  This is one of my standby vegan recipes even my hubby will eat.

I followed this recipe to the T.  It was delicious and so easy!  We ate it with white rice on the side, I'm sure you could use chicken or pork and it would taste nice as well.

Made this 8/30/12 - Used ground pork and sesame oil instead of regular oil.  Did not have or use hoisin.  Used fresh ginger instead of pickled.  Added some lime juice and extra soy.  Grated carrots to put on the lettuce.  It was great!  Oh---don't forget to make the dipping sauce with the sesame oil, soy sauce, chili sauce, rice wine vinegar and a little sugar.

Delish! My husband and I loved these. I had to add a little more soy sauce at the end, but possibly because I used the 'Low Sodium' version, so it needed more... well, sodium. :)

Can't go wrong for an appetizer or a main dish. Yum!

Always a crowd pleaser among the adults.  Very neat recipe that tastes as close to a restaurant as you could possibly hope to get at home.  There are some somewhat difficult to find ingredients, so do your shopping early!

Yum! I can't wait to make this again!  
I did sub the Hoisin sauce for Plum Duck sauce because I couldn't find a gluten free Hoisin, and also ground turkey for beef.   Since I'm not sure I've had Hoisin I can't say how much it changes the overall taste-   I just know it was delicious!

Also yummy over brown rice :)

Doubled the exact recipe minus the water chestnuts an chile sauce as I'm not a huge fan.  Also used a little powdered ginger rather than minced pickled ginger because it was what I had on hand.  Made it for a party and it was a hit!  In fact, I'm making it again today for another party we're going to, per their request.  Definitely adding to my family dinner repertoire as it's so easy and delicious!

Made with ground TURKEY and it was great.  Lots of flavor and even my super-picky kids asked for seconds.  I tweaked the recipe by browning the turkey w/no oil in a separate non-stick pan, but added the oil back in to cook the onions, etc.  I also did not use water chestnuts, so offered shredded carrots in a bowl.  Our toppings also included a bowl of crunchy chow mein noodles (which I think is why the kids were willing to try it).  Definitely adding this one to the "keeper" pile!

Very good!  We made the mistake of using a beef mix for hamburgers that is about 87% - and with the oil (which we used Dark Sesame) it was too greasy.  I also added matchstick carrots - about a cup.  Yum.

Delicious.  Made as directed, with two changes: put the water chestnuts out separately for those in the house that don't like them, and omitted the green onions.  This is a definite remake!  We plan to try it with turkey and/or TVP (as per another reviewer) as well.

I made this and added 1/3 bag coleslaw mix to the chicken mixture. Turned out yummy. Found the one option for sauce with vinegar,soy and chili too strong, so added some water to it. Think I'll try with hoisin next time

I've been wanting to try this recipe for a couple of weeks.  I tried it tonight.  My husband and mother-in-law thought it was delicious!  A very different way to use ground beef.  I may try ground turkey next time, and see how it goes.  I was fortunate enough to have most of the ingredients on hand.  Definitely worth it!

Made this for my family and followed the directions with the modifications on the sauce that some other members gave. Topped with rice noodles and shredded carrots (like the display picture, even though the recipe doesn't mention it). It was FANTASTIC! Also used ground turkey instead of beef and it worked perfectly. Will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed these but felt that there was something missing.  It could be because I only had fresh ginger.  I think maybe some shredded carrots would work nicely, and I will definitely increase the soy sauce a little and decrease the Hoisin sauce a little.  It was sweeter than we like.

I made this according to the recipe. After tasting it, something was missing so I added more vinegar and a sweet Asian chili sauce. So, just play around with your taste buds when making this wonderful wrap.

This recipe was AMAZING! I took the advice listed here with the sauce and the only thing I changed was to use Braggs liquid amino's instead of soy sauce (It's a soy sauce alternative high in amino acids). Also, I didn't have the crumbled beef so I used chicken breast and cubed it....WOW. it was delish and the sauce...YUM! The only thing I would do differently was really my fault. I served this as dinner and we were still hungry after. I'd double the recipe if your really hungry...

The only reason I'm rating this a 4 is because the beef in this recipe tasted too strong. The flavors of the ginger and hoisin were so amazing, but the beef was too strong and heavy. I will DEFINITELY make this over and over, but next time I'll use ground pork or minced chicken.

very good, I didn't have ground beef so substituted some diced browned chicken thighs, I also added some minced celery and grated carrot.  Very yummy, a recipe you can improvise with a bit.  I didn't change the seasoning at all and was very good!

Very tasty. Modified slightly. Couldn't find pickled ginger so omitted it, don't like water chestnuts, omitted it, and left out the pepper sauce. Ended up doubling the sauce mixture because it was not quite tasty enough for me. After doubling the sauce mixture it was delicious.

Fabulous. Made this Recipie exactly a. Is. Only added a bit more ginger and garlic and doubled the sauce ingredients (my family loves everything saucy). It was requested again the next day. Even kids cheered the next time I made it. Great flavor and easy Recipie!!

The taste was great. The kids liked it, although it was a bit of a messy choice for a busy mom. They are just too hard for the little ones to keep rolled up. I might try to modify this into a salad that they can eat with a fork. Who knows. I am a busy mom!

So so good! I follow this recipe "almost" exact except I use ground chicken instead of beef (Its just a bit lighter tasting), fresh ginger instead of pickled...about 1 tablespoon or so through the microplane. I make a peanut hoisin sauce to drizzle over the top. Heat over medium heat equal parts (or so, to taste) hoisin sauce, peanut butter and water. Amazing!

I give my 'slightly' revised version 5 stars- great recipe!   I used leftover chicken breast (1.5 cups diced) instead of beef.  Clarified onion first, then added the chicken to it.  Also- used fresh grated ginger (cooked right along with the onion), and some fresh finely grated carrot at the very end.  Also- added some crushed peanut and some crunchy noodles on top before rolling up the wrap.

I made this recipe exactly as written and the flavor was excellent. However, I must have bought the wrong kind of lettuce (for wrapping) because it was hard to fold up and fell apart easily making it difficult to eat.

This was fantastic! I did as other reviewers suggested and added extra sweet chile pepper sauce, and doubled the sauce for dipping at the end. I made this recipe twice in one week and probably would have made more had I not started running out of ingredients! Thanks!

AWESOME!!!! This is definitely a hit in our house!!! My kids LOVED it!! They immediately wanted seconds. Great and flavorful dish....a must try!!! Only thing I didn't add was the spinach because my kidz and husband aren't too big on it. I also didn't use all the pesto it asked for, I just did like 4 to 5 big spoonfuls of the pesto....pesto can be overbearing at times.

I've had these at Chinese restaurants and wanted to make some at home. These turned out even better than the restaurant! Absolutely terrific! I used a little less onion, a little less water chestnuts and had the chile pepper sauce on the side or as a topping.

These were awesome! After using the recommended amounts of soy sauce, sesame oil, and chili paste from other uses, it was definitely 5 stars! I added broccoli slaw on the top for a little crunch. Superb!

Awesome, delicious and popular recipe!  I substituted pickled ginger with fresh ginger and added more veggies: carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts and green peppers.

I made this as written except I used textured vegetable protein (TVP) in place of the ground meat for my vegetarian offspring and myself. This dish is PHENOMENAL!  I love asian lettuce wraps and order them at the Yardhouse every time I go. these were just as good but No Meat. I know an added bonus is the way I made has FAR less fat, cholesterol and calories. This is my new favorite food....

this is one of the easiest Asian recipe I have made.  I give it 5 stars for the flavor and ease in prepping and cooking.  Thanks to all that shared the sauce much better than the oyster sauce some recipe calls for.  I would make this again and it will be perfect for party gathering.  I also used turkey this time around.

I've had these at a local chain restaurant and they are AWESOME!!! I've made them but I use ground chicken instead of beef (same as the restaurant).  I would recomend these to anyone.  It is a great way to get veggies into young ones who aren't usually interested in eating them.

These were amazing! I used ground pork but you could easily use ground turkey or chicken. There is so much flavor you would never know. I did use more of the liquids than it called for cuz I like mine saucy. I also used fresh ginger but be careful cuz the ginger flavor is strong! The side sauce suggested by another reviewer (soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil) was a nice added burst of flavor. I will definetly make this again.

I made this last night for dinner.  It was really good - I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I was worried it would be too spicy so I left out the chili pepper sauce, but it was too bland - so next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will be sure to add the chili pepper sauce.

made with ground chicken instead- very tasty
also added fried rice sticks ( just add the fried rice stick to hot oil in small portions they will puff up almost instantly- remove from oil drain and add to lettuce filling

oh my gosh this was good!! I loved it! and having it in the lettuce to wrap up made it fun and added a contrast of textures. I wnet to the trouble of buying the pickled ginger and I think that really made this recipe! I had forgotten to by hoisin sauce but found a recipe for that so made it and added it too. My only change was that I had ground pork from our farmers' market in my freezer so used that instead. Delicious! and even better BOTH my teenagers loved this (and they have very different tastes!). What's more, I can easily make this gluten-free for my daughter by just using gluten-free soy sauce. 

thanks for a great recipe! I will be making this again. maybe weekly...

AMAZING!!  We have a huge supply of salmon and halibut.  I have replaced the ground beef with both salmon and halibut.  Both were excellent but the salmon was my family's favorite.

I made this dish tonight following the recipe as written, leaving out the chile pepper sauce that is optional.  I am SO glad I made a double batch because this was delicious.  Even my husband said, "You made this?"  I plan to use the leftovers to eat with shredded lettuce as I apparently am not very good at wrapping the meat in lettuce.  It was messy to eat.  I will definitely make this again.

I won't go into the changes I had to make just because I had to do with what I could buy in my area...but WOW...making these again tonight 2nd time in 3 days lol...the first night we just made "asian lettuce salad"  found that chilling the bibb lettuce helps to wrap them more easily 
  more than 5 stars for sure!

I cannot put in to words how delicious this was.  We followed the recipe exactly, except we added two extra garlic cloves, mushrooms and used a garlic chile sauce.  Served with white rice and made the sauce that others recommended.  We can't wait to make this again.

OMG, my family LOVED this. I followed the recipe to the letter including the chili pepper sauce about (1 tbls).  I doubled the recipe and served it with hot and sour soup and potstickers. It was a huge hit.

I would give this a 5 - I absolutely LOVED it!  My husband and son said 4 so I went with the majority.
I added in the chile pepper paste and they felt that it was way too spicy.  If you don't like spice - beware!  It packs a serious punch.
I will definitely make this again - thanks so much for a great recipe, Rachel!

My nearly-five-year-old and I just made this for dinner and I have to say between the two of us we nearly vacuumed it up! It took a supreme effort of will to save some for daddy :-). I didn't have quite everything on hand to make it exactly as written but even with my couple of substitutions it tasted enough like my favourite Chinese restaurant's version to satisfy my craving. I think the hoisin and the ginger are key; just about anything else can be fudged a bit as necessary. Can't wait to try it again with even more of the authentic ingredients! Btw my little one ended up tearing his lettuce up and eating it like a salad. Still tastes good and a bit less mess.

I really loved the flavor and texture.  My only slight issue was the instructions to brown the meat in oil.  My dish turned out a little oilier than I would have preferred.  I made a few minor changes, increased the chile pepper sauce and served it with the crisped rice noodles.  i might try ground pork next time, but will make it again.  Yum!

These wraps were delicous.  I used ground turkey for a healthier alternative.  It was so good I will be added to my regular meal schedule.  I didn't use anything chili pepper sauce because my daughter doesn't like spicy food.  If I was making for just me I would make it spicy.  I enjoyed it even though it was not as spicy as I would have liked it. I would encourage everyone to make these wraps.

Nice recipe...although I 'just about' doubled the hoisin and soy sauce. Go easy on the hoisin if you might like it less sweet. Also, I used a mix of ground beef and pork. Finally, I cooked some fine bean noodle to serve under the meat. Cut the noodle up a bit so it's easier to serve. You may also fry it to have a crispy texture. This helped add something extra!

Amazing- I followed the first comment about making a dipping sauce.. a must. Also I used fresh finely shredded ginger probably 1Tblsp or so maybe even 2. I love ginger in asian food. Also add freshly shredded carrots. It's a nice touch and adds something to your meal.

I LOVE THESE!!!!  I made them with a vegetarian chicken and matchstick carrots. The flavor of the sauce is awesome and that is why it deserves 5 stars no matter what "meat" you use. thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent!  Every body always loves this when I make it.  I don't use fresh ginger and I omit the pepper sauce and it is still wonderful!  Otherwise you don't need to change a thing.

I just made this for the first time and my 3 year old son, who is a pretty picky eater loved it.
Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was just OK to me. I followed the recipe exactly, but the seasoning just seemed kind of bland to me and the family wasn't impressed. I love onions, but even to me, the onion was overpowered, maybe because the rest seemed bland. I don't think I'll try this one again & will keep looking for a good lettuce wrap recipe.

Very good.  Didn't have the Asian chile pepper sauce or the pickled ginger, which are probably key ingredients.  I used about half (or less) of the hoisin, as I'd recently made another recipe that called for the same quantity and didn't care for it.  Added carrots, because I'd seen lettuce wraps with carrots, and carrots are good for you!

DELICIOUS!!
I've been craving lettuce wraps for weeks but didn't want to pay the $$ that restaurants charge. 
I followed the recipe loosely, adding a lot more ginger and spice and a bit more of everything else.
Better than PF Changs!

These are GREAT. I made them with chicken and added some diced mushrooms to the mixture. You could probably add any vegetables you wanted and they would still be good. Did shredded carrots on top, with a peanut sauce and a soy-based sauce like the one mentioned by another reviewer. These beat most restaurants and I will certainly make again!

These were delicious! I used chicken instead of beef and also added diced straw mushrooms, shoestring carrots and chopped almonds. Yum! I will definitely make these again especially since my 6 year old had 4 servings!!!

These were quite tasty. They reminded me a lot of a hamburger version of the chicken Asian lettuce wraps at P.F. Changs. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and 1 tsp. of minced ginger, I had in the freezer, instead of the pickled which I do not care for. I left of the optional chili sauce in the recipe. For the vinegar and oils I used what I already had to: vegetable oil, white vinegar, and olive oil. I can barely taste any difference in the varieties. I also started making it before I realized I didn't buy the water chestnuts, but I went through with the recipe anyway. I think it just left out a little crunch, but probably didn't change the flavor much if at all. The grocery store I shop at doesn't carry the lettuce suggested, so I bought iceburg lettuce and it worked fine. I chopped off the botton and got 8 nice sized lettuce pieces to use. That is what the restaurant uses where I first tried them at also anyway. Only downside is I liked it just made, but didn't care to eat the leftovers. Although, it was a nice dinner change the evening I made it.

I love this recipe! When we want lettuce wraps this is the only we turn to. I make it with diced chicken, I need to try it with ground beef still. I know it will be just as good, chicken is just what I have on hand when I make them.

Tasty and easy!  I subbed ground turkey and crumbled tempeh for the beef. I linked this to our GetAllergyWise blog for a dairy-free and egg-free meal idea.

This recipe was really great.  I used ground turkey instead of the beef, and fresh ginger instead of pickled. The dipping sauce from another review really zipped it up, too. We'll definitely be making this one again.

We really liked this. I made it vegan by cooking 1 cup of lentils in place of the beef. Then I saved the green onions and water chestnuts for a topping and added bean sprouts and shredded cabbage for topping options as well. Drizzle a little chili sauce and it makes an excellent meal. Keeps well as a leftover. Thanks for sharing.

Oh My! This is so good! I had to edit my review and let everyone know just how great these really are! I made this twice in the past 10 days and I am not a big meat eater. I was used to lettuce wraps made with chicken but these are just as good, if not better. They are so easy to put together and the flavors are wonderful! Sometimes I make these as appetizers and other times I double the recipe and along with stir fried veggies and fried rice it's a wonderful dinner. Thank you  Rachel for making me look so good!

Yum! I left out the pickled ginger and water chestnuts because I had none and it still seemed like a complete dish. Like other reviewers, I would like to try this with other kinds of ground meat like pork or turkey. I will definitely make this again.

One word. YUM!!! This one is a keeper. I've tried other lettuce wrap recipes and they were never really great. I confess I substituted ground turkey for the beef but I don't think that makes much difference in the delightful flavors found in this dish.

I changed this up just a bit--made this with ground chicken instead of the ground beef, fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger, used 1 tsp. sesame oil AND 1 tsp. of hot chili oil for a little extra kick.  Turned out great!  The sauce that is recommended by others was great.

I used lean steak rather than ground beef = healthier.  I also used honey rather than hoison sauce & fresh grated ginger.  These were so good!  UPDATE: Made with chicken this time and we actually liked it better!  The lighter flavor of the chicken really worked well with the lettuce.

Awesome! I loved this recipe. Here's what I changed: I used iceberg lettuce, used tilapia instead of ground beef (baked in oven, then chopped up real small added to veggies in the end just to heat up), then sprinkled with a little crushed peanuts. Next time I want to add shredded carrots and some of those fried vermicelli thingies and perhaps make some fried rice on the side. UPDATE still making this recipe and love it. I always quadruple it b/c we eat it as a meal.

These are absolutely delish! This becomes a pricey appetizer after purchasing all the ingredients, but it is worth it. We actually had this as a meal and had lots leftover. Would be great for a taligate too! I subbed turkey breast for the ground beef and it tasted amazing. This one is a keeper!

My boyfriend loves to cook Thai food, so we had most of the ingredients lying around the apartment. One day while he was at work, I decided to make this recipe to use up an extra head of lettuce--boy did I make a good decision! The only item I didn't have on hand was pickled ginger, but it's inexpensive and our jar has lasted quite a while--we now make this at least once a month, and it's great every time!  I decided to omit the water chestnuts, since I don't care for them and my boyfriend doesn't care either way. I like spice, so I add the chile pepper sauce, but usually not more than a teaspoon or two, else it's too hot for my man.

This is THE lettuce wrap recipe. I was even missing a few ingredients and it was incredible. I only had dried minced garlic so I let it reconstitute in the ground beef while it cooked, then added more to the sauce while it cooked. No hoisin sauce so I used the closest I could find - kung pao sauce which added the spice instead of the Asian pepper. The onions sauteed mildly in sesame oil on lower heat than usual so I didn't burn the sesame oil. It could have used the crunch of the water chestnuts but of course, none on hand. The pickled ginger was replaced by 1/2 tsp ground ginger. When all was cooked I just added the ground beef right into the sauce. Perfect! Just imagine when I get all the right ingredients :)

This is by far one of the best recipes I've tried! I made one out of ground pork and one of ground beef...I'll make it out of the ground pork next time, its great! I couldn't find the chili paste used Hot Chilli Sauce. They were spectacular and my mom and husband are both fans! Next time I'm gonna try grilling some steak, stripping them and tossing them in the sauce!

These were excellent! Healthy and tasty- exactly what I was looking for! I did substitute ground turkey for the beef and used fresh minced ginger instead of pickled. Hubby doesn't like water chesnuts, but I love them so I split it and just mixed them into mine. Thanks for sharing- this will become a regular in our house, I think! I served with egg drop soup II from this site.

Mmmm, so good and healthy too!  I use fresh ginger and omit the water chestnuts because I don't care for them. I cook the onions and garlic with the beef then drain the fat.  No need to do them separately.  Quick,  easy and so flavorful!

So yummy!!!  It got sloppy after a while, so I ended up making the leftovers into a salad instead of rolling the lettuce leaves up.

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I didnt think my family would care for it but i have prepared it twice in the last 2 weeks!!! Doubled the recipe both time and it was gone in 2 days.  Very easy leftovers.  My husband thinks it tastes like a very fine pastry (?).  I have no idea...as long as he likes it!!!!!

Great tasting easy recipe.  I took some other reviewers suggestions and used ground chicken and fresh ginger instead of pickled (about 1 tsp grated).  Also used about 2 T of the "optional" chili paste.  I would half the amount of green onion and water chestnuts next time.  Definitely works with the PF Chang style sauce that was recommended (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chili paste).  Very good, makes more than you think.

I've made these twice now and love them! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used fresh ginger instead of pickled and served with the PF Chiang-style asian dipping sauce per other reviewer's recommendation. They taste even better the next day. Oh, I also used iceberg lettuce b/c my store was out of butter or boston. Nice and crisp.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated. I didn't have pickled ginger so I used 1/4 t. dry ginger and I added minced red bell pepper, just because I like it. They were good, but lacked a little flavor. With a little extra garlic and onion powder they were really good. Also, the chile pepper sauce does wonders, just don't over do it! A tiny amount goes a long ways!!

This was amazing! My entire family loved it down to my picky 7 year old! The only differences I made were based on some reviews I had read. I used iceberg lettuce and it was great. I also used ground ginger due to I dont like pickled. You have to make the sauce to go with these and it is even better for lunch the next day!

I couldn't find the hoisin sauce at the store, so they didn't taste as they would have if I had all the ingredients. Without the hoisin sauce and the pepper sauce, it was just ok. Next time I'll make sure I have all the ingredients.

Absolutely delicious!  Try ground turkey for a healthier dish.  Used fresh ginger root instead of the pickled variety.  This will stay in our "favorite recipes" collection.

I'm so happy that I tried this Asian Lettuce Wraps! My familly really enjoyed it. I omitted minced pickled ginger and asian chile pepper sauce,but it still tasted so good.My kids loved that,too! My hubby liked to put some chile pepper sauce before wrapping it up in a lettuce leaf. We used Butter lettuce leaves and they were soft and easy to wrap the meat up.

I really enjoyed these. The pickled ginger flavor was a little too strong for me. I would cut that maybe in half. And a little less onion too. We never use the full amount of onion called for, otherwise it would be overpowering.

We really enjoyed this recipe. We used iceberg lettuce with chicken (shredded), and in place of regular soy we used Dale's sauce. Very good and easy!

This is a very yummy recipe. I liked the water chestnut crunch in the mixture. I ended up adding more hoisin sauce than called for because we like the flavor. I also used fresh ginger.

These were fantastic. Had another recipe that claimed to be PF Chang's and threw it out for this one. I used ground turkey and fresh ginger and couldn't even find the hoisin sauce at the grocery. (found it since and have it for next time). Used about 2 T fresh ginger and that was a bit strong. Love finding recipes that are full of flavor and smart food. Served with some egg drop soup and made a healthy satisfying meal.

This was FANTASTIC! I used fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger, and served on Romaine (more like boats than wraps).  My 11 year old daughter almost ate an entire head of romaine lettuce! We will definitely have this again!

Replaced ground beef with ground pork. The flavour of this dish was wonderful. Only hassle was in using Romaine lettuce (only one I could find other than Iceburg)- very difficult keeping the sauce mixture in the lettuce and not on the plate.  Kind of labour-intensive given the results.

This is awesome!  We fixed these wraps just as the recipe calls for except I added some cellophane noodles at the very end.  I did use the dipping sauce that another reviewer suggested.  My teenagers couldn't get enough.  Thanks for sharing!!

The flavor of this is wonderful! I do use ground pork in place of beef, as well as using fresh grated ginger. I have put the mixture in the lettuce leaves as recommended, but have also placed it in in rice wrappers, as well as serving it on a bed of rice noodles. Great recipe, simple too!

Excellent!  I found the pickled ginger in the sushi section of our grocery store in just the right amount.  I also personally don't like water chestnuts and used carrots chopped in my food processor instead.  My family loved it.

This recipe is a definite keeper, the best lettuce wraps i have made from scratch. i used ground turkey instead of beef, i added some boiled rice noodles at the end, and sliced carrots on top. i prefer the rice noodles crunchy but being on weight watchers i did away with the extra oil. very delicious........

Oh HEAVEN!  I honestly think I could have ate this whole dish.  My favorite Asian dish is Spicy Szechuan Beef at Big Bowl and this sauce tasted exactly like the sauce on that dish.  I'm thrilled to have found this and can't wait to add more and more to this base recipe to suit my current cravings.  YUMMY!

This is a very good recipe but it really needs at least double the ginger and hoisin sauce to get the full flavour.   Other wise, excellent.  I have made it a number of times to rave reviews.

Only gave it 4 because it just doesn't taste right with beef. Cut chicken breasts into strips and marinated in (CHEAT here) Lawry's Sesame Garlic for about 20 min.  Cook in wok for 3-4 minutes with a cover to retain  moisture but did not cook completely. Removed and covered for 5-10 minutes then chopped finely.  Followed rest of recipe and then added chicken to sauce.  I rarely follow recipes perfectly but other than chicken change everything was very good.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!  I made these just as written except for that I used regular romaine lettace for mine and used pork on beef. It seems a little off to use beef in lettuce wraps. JMO.  They came out really good.  I made the oriental sauce for dipping...I also use that sauce when I make my pork dumplings from this site. I will for sure make these again!

It's better than PF chang's lettuce wraps. I've tried this with ground turkey and it comes out just as awesome. I also add an extra 1/4 cup of hoisin sauce (KEY INGREDIENT!!!). And I don't add in ginger...

This was amazing!  I couldn't find pickled ginger so I added chopped ginger and I completely forgot about the asian chili sauce.  Still, with those changes, the dish was delicious.  My BF already wants to try it with chicken and pork.  I will be making this again!  :)

Made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them! I agree with another reviewer that it doesn't look very appetizing, but it tastes very good. I would chop everything up a little finer next time, including the cooked ground beef, to make it easier to roll/eat.

This was great! I added shredded carrot, which our family enjoyed. Must warn you, they are REALLY messy though! Thanks for sharing!

I took some liberties with this recipe (used zucchini instead of onion, for lack of an onion) and it worked out well. This could earn one more star if the filling didn't look so homogenous. Maybe next time I'll add a little red pepper or something, for something other than brown.

I was looking for something similar to P F Chang's lettuce wraps, but this sounded best of all the recipes I found.  While it's not like the restaurant wraps at all, it is SO good!  I actually PREFER these.  YUMMY.

Great! I LOVE this recipe!! I used iceberg lettuce and immersed it in ice water for about 30 min before serving to get them nice and crisp. No pickled ginger, so just used fresh. The only thing that would have been nice is a little more heat, but that's just me. I should tell you, there must be a lot of sodium in here because I can't stop drinking water tonight!  Well worth it though:) Great recipe...I'll definitely make this for company. ( I made the sauce suggested by RedRobyn except I added about 4 T Plum Sauce to it. DEElicious!)

We made this for a large group of people, and EVERYONE loved them! That, to me, shows how excellent a recipe it is...! Easy to do, too. Some people weren't used to eating things in lettuce ;) so we provided flour tortills, too. Everyone raved!

I loved this recipe! Instead of beef i cooked three chicken breasts and just chopped them up really good. I would definately double all the sauces except the hoisin and the sesame oil. Thats what I didn and it was perfect! And you can just use 2 heads of iceburg lettuce instead of that expensive stuff. Also, if you dont want to pay 7 dollars for pickled ginger, buy a stem of it for less than a dollar, peel off the skin and grate it on the littlest grater you have. works great!

Excellent. I used Ground TURKEY (make sure you chop it up really fine) and FRESH grated GINGER. LOTS of Chinese Sweet CHILI sauce (the one that looks like jello with peper flakes). Just like PF Changs - EXCELLENT! THANK YOU!

These were sooooooo good. I used ground turkey, family thought it was beef shhhhhh! Even ultra picky 6yo ate the meat =0 I served toppings of carrot sticks, green onion, crispy rice noodles, and served with a ginger dressing from this site. Paired these up with egg drop soup made a fantastic meal!!

This is delicious and easy to prepare - chop your ingredients in advance. Changes I made: 1. Substituted ground turkey 2. Added shredded carrots to the'sauce'mixture 3. added cilantro to the meat after cooking 4. Made with the "Oriental Dipping Sauce" on this site

This was a wonderful Asian treat. We followed the instructions as is and it came out great. We could not find the Bibb or Butterhead lettuce and used regular iceberg lettuce. We made the Asian dipping sauce on this site to have with this and it was wonderful.  Our family of four loves Asian food and we keep our eyes and palettes open for new stuff. This will definitely become a favorite at our house.

As is, this is great! I altered it the 2nd time to fit into my diet. I sliced chicken breast thin, cooked it on the stove top w/lid and cooking spray, sauce exactly as stated but added a handful of diced vietnamese basil and real ginger. I also add about 1/2 cup of water and let it simmer together for 20 min. We add warm rice to our lettuce leaves and then top with the chicken/sauce mix. MMmmmm and extremely healthy!(minus the sodium of course)

These were amazing! I didn't have any hoisin sauce or chili sauce so I diced some red and yellow pepper and red pepper flakes. I subbed ground chicken for ground beef and eyeballed the other measurements, but this was so good that I can't wait to make it again and enjoy the leftovers with tortillas. Thank you!

I used chicken and left out the ginger. I have picky 2 and 4 year olds, once I got them to try the wraps they ate every bit! My husband also thought they were very tasty and sugested that I add some peanuts next time. There will be a next time!!!!

We loved these.  I could find the bBibb or butter lettuce so I used a red leaf lettuce.  I did serve mine with shredded carrot, bean sprouts, and crunchy rice noodles.  The dipping sauce is great and I ended up just pouring some on each of my wraps as I made them up.

4.5/5.     Very tasty, and easy to do.  Subbed out pickled ginger for a nub of fresh ginger. put in a 1/2 cup of Hoisen instead of 1/4.   Added some grated Carrot as well.    Turned out wonderful!! I screwed up and mixed in the green onion with the white onion when cooking the sauce. I'll correct that next time, but it certainly didn't spoil anything. People were really impressed that you could make soemthing that is clearly restaurant quality at home!   Well done. Will make it again!

I love this recipe. It was so easy and it tasted just like PF Changs.The only thing is, PF Changs makes theirs with chicken so I used ground chicken instead of beef. The recipe also didnt call for the crunchy things in theirs or the carrots. Next time I will ad those two ingredients, but otherwise it was still fab just the way it was!!

Made this dish tonight and everyone loved it! I had a hard time finding some of the ingredients at the store but I'm glad I did and now I'll have them for the next time. Really quick and easy to make. It took me about 20 mins to put together. Oh I didn't add the pickled ginger but instead just added a dash of ground ginger.

Great recipe - I used butter lettuce and only used 3/4 lb of beef since I didn't want to make that much.  The hoisin sauce is the key - I was surprised at the taste and how delicious it was.  I'm definitely going to make this again.

Yummy! It's almost like an asian version of a sloppy joe! Next time, however, I'll make it with ground pork. To me, the beef flavor didn't go quite as well with the sweetness of the sauce. But very good - my husband and I ate it all!

Made this for some friends coming over. They were great, everyone loved them. They are a little messy, so be prepared for that. I used ground Turkey rather than beef and it was fabulous, no change in the taste/texture what so ever. Also omitted water chestnuts b/c we had someone over that didn't like them. I used frozen vegetables (onion, green, red and orange peppers) and fresh ginger and green onion. I had a hard time finding the pickled ginger. The fresh ginger worked extremely well. Will definately make these again.

No need to go to PF Changs anymore. This is so good. We used chicken thighs instead of ground beef. (I ground them in my kitchen aid.) Also added a little bit of ground pork (only because I had some left over from spring rolls.) Will absolutely be making this on a regular basis. So good!

Easy to modify to your own tastes.  Quick to whip up using ingrediants I had on hand.  I used ground pork instead of ground beef.  Ground turkey or chicken would work as well.  I didn't have chile pepper sauce so I added cayenne for a little kick.

You can add other toppings for your lettuce wraps.  For mine, I had julienned carrots and cucumbers, chopped peanuts, more hoisin sauce and some rice noodles tossed with a little peanut oil and rice wine vinegar.  I had all the toppings on a platter and everyone enjoyed making their own wraps.  It makes an appetizer that is full of lively, bright tastes without being heavy.

My 14 year old daughter and I made these tonight and they were fantastic!  I thought they were very authentic, and we even used a vegetarian ground meat substitute.  We omitted the ginger and the chili sauce, and we thought it was perfect.  I used Boston lettuce, and needed 2 small heads.  We ate half and will save the other half to use with the second lettuce tomorrow.

These were fantastic!  I used thai sweet chili sauce in the recipe and it was very good, slightly sweet and spicy but not overpowering.  They also got good reviews from everyone I served them to.  I will make them again.

All I can say is WOW!  These are just as good as the ones I love at PF Changs.  I had a few changes only because the store did not stock a few of the items or was out.  I can only imagine how out-of-this-world great this will be with everything in it.
Cooking hint:  while the meat is cooking, get the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, vinegar and chili in a mixing bowl and ready to add to the onion mixture at the right time since it is a lot to add to a hot pan quickly.  

Changes:  I used ground turkey as it was 9 pm when I shopped and the store was out of ground beef.  I omitted the pickled ginger and rice wine vinegar since the store did not stock these.  I did add ground ginger to taste since I love ginger and didn't want to miss that flavor.  I omitted the chile pepper sauce since I don't like spicy.  
Even with all of these omimssions, the flavor from the meat mixture was amazing.  My husband, when I passed a tasting spoon to him, said that he almost didn't want to swallow it because he wanted to savor the intense and complex flavor of it. 
I will absolutely make this again and again and will head out to a more diverse market to get all of the missing pieces.

I loved this dish, though, the thought of ground beef isn't very "asian" in my opinion, so I switched it out and chopped up some chicken. Turned out very nicely, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

This recipe was excellant. I followed the directions exactly.  I may try using ground chicken next time rather than beef to make it a bit more like the PF CHangs recipe.

A little bit of work but was very flavorful! I doubled sauce (which was perfect ratio after doubling) and reserved some finely sliced green onion tops for topping wraps before eating. I also topped with fresh bean sprouts. I am going to try this with ground chicken next time. Excellent low carb (watch out for the sugar in the hoisin sauce).

I've made this dish several times and we just love it. I always make it with ground turkey breast instead of beef and I omitted the chile pepper sauce because of the kids. It goes really well with brown basmati rice too.

These were really yummy!!  The only thing is I wish that there would have more sauce or a dipping sauce.  Doubling the sauce would have been perfect.  The taste was so good though, I had to give 5 stars!!

Great. I use regular vinegar and ginger powder. I also use ground pork instead of ground beef (many other recipes for lettuce wraps calls for pork). We add bean sprouts, too, and sometimes shredded carrots.

Can also make a nice Thai-style peanut dipping sauce for these (there are some recipes on this site).

My 14-yr old niece and her mom made this for my entire family at our summer vacation (14 of us ranging from 15m to 75). The overwhelming response was "amazing"! There wasn't one person who didn't love this recipe, including my own picky 15m old. I gave her just the meat mixture and rice and she shoved it down voraciously.

Most of my family used the bib lettuce to make the wraps, but a few of the guys ate it over white rice. I think using ground pork or even sliced chicken would be great and I plan to try that myself. Very versatile recipe!

I didn't have all the ingredients.  So for the sesame seed oil I used 2 TBSP of sesame seeds.  I didn't have hoisin sauce but I used 1 TBSP on Sriracha HOT Chili Sauce.  And I didn't have green onions or water cheasnuts so I just left them off.  I used regular vinegar instead of the rice wine.  And I added 2-3 TBSP of osyter sauce since I didn't have the main sauce and I thought it needed to be more liquid to coat the beef.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it (as you can see from our rating)!

Five star-worthy with these changes:

1) Made with ground chicken

2) Made a "special sauce" for dipping. Just mix all these ingredients together:

1/4 cup sugar, 
1/2 cup water, 
2 tablespoons soy sauce, 
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, 
2 tablespoons ketchup, 
1 tablespoon lemon juice, 
1/8 teaspoon sesame oil, 
2 teaspoons water, 
1-2 teaspoon garlic and red chili paste

We love lettuce wraps and this recipe is pretty good for making them yourself.  I do make some changes including adding chicken rather than tofu and regular onions rather than green.  Otherwise this was quite good.

These were great and enjoyed by my friends - used ground chicken instead of beef and ground ginger instead of pickled and found that iceberg lettuce worked great.  I finished the dish by sprinkling some shredded carrots and scallions on top.  The sauce is great and I loved that they weren't too oily as lots of times lettuce wraps in restaurants are way too greasy.  I put the dish together in about 15 minutes - super easy.  Thanks.

This was very different and special.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding an extra 3 oz chopped water chestnuts b/c I just love them.  Also, I used ground venison burger since I figured all those asian spices would drown out the gamey tast of the meat.  We had lots of leftover meat/sauce mixture, and ate it over rice or just by itself for leftovers.  It is really good!

This was okay.  The water chestnuts get too soggy if they are added too soon.

My wife and I loved this one. It tasted just like the wraps we get at Pei Wei. We added some hot sauce to our individual servings to spice them up as each of us liked.  Will definitely prepare this one again!!!!

A great quick dish and super easy to make.  One suggestion is to prepare all your ingredients first and have all your liquids out and ready because this dish cooks up fast!  Can’t wait to make it again :)

Delicious - I give 4.5 stars! I did not use the green onion (didn't have any on hand), and I wasn't sure how much chile sauce to use since I had never cooked with it before (next time I'll add more, I only used about 1 1/2 teaspoons). I did find it was a bit too oily, so next time I won't add as much sesame oil.  Thank you Rachel for this wonderful and easy recipe, allowing me to make one of my favorite dishes. I'll make it often!!

I also used regular ginger, I added a bit more chili sauce, and soy sauce to kick up the flavor a bit, and I reduced the hoisin sauce slightly (I am not sure by how much, I added it to taste. I really enjoyed these, as did my husband who normally can't stand onions.

I made this recipe as is and thought it tasted great.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add a *little* less oil, but that's just a minor thing.  I do agree with a previous reviewer though: definitely chop everything ahead of time before you start cooking--you will be glad you did.

This is a great recipe.  I have made these wraps before but I liked the ingredients better in this recipe.  If you're vegetarian you can substitute a good vegetarian ground beef product like Yves' Ground Round.  Will definitely make again soon!

FANTASTIC!!!  We loved the lettuce wraps at PF Changs, and I was thrilled to find a recipe that might substitute since we at there once and only once (we both woke up the next morning with such an MSG hangover we had to swear not to do that to our bodies again).  I can't remember exactly how they tasted to compare the two, but this recipe is WONDERFUL regardless of how it compares to a restaurant.  Good enough we're serving it for the Super Bowl this Sunday.  AND, they're super easy...great for making after you get off work and the family is waiting on you for dinner.  While I was cooking the filling, I though to myself that this isn't THAT much more work than throwing together a Hamburger Helper!  And sooo much better and better for you!

I'm not sure why the recipe calls to take the meat out of the skillet before cooking the onions and adding the rest of the ingredients. This can all be easily put together in one pot. I used ground turkey, added the onions a few minutes after the meat, and then the sauces and spices when the meat was browned. A quick, easy, fun dinner.

Mine turned out fine, not phenominal... Used iceberg lettuce which was not strong enough to hold the filling, so it was a very messy meal. Also, these ingrediants cooked very fast, I was really glad I had chopped everything prior to turning on the stove. Used a combintation of lean ground beef and ground turkey, which helped the fat content. I didn't realize the amount of sugar in hoisin sauce; I was hoping for a lower-carb meal, which this didn't turn out to be. I added chopped peanuts and bamboo shoots as suggested in a review.

My husband loved this recipe and ate 8 wraps in one sitting. 

I added some finely chopped bamboo shoots and pine nuts to give it more crunch. (and to use these items up from my pantry)

Also, I used a creamy peanut butter and sweet chili pepper sauce I made. This was the type of sauce my mother always used.

Delish!  I used ground turkey, fresh grated ginger, and I only had regular vinegar, but this was soooo good anyway!!  I also didn't have any chili pepper sauce...but I did have some jarred jalepeno so I used about a teaspoon of that.  REALLY, really good.  Thanks!

This was a hit with my family.  I used a little extra of each of the sauces, though.  It seemed like the ground beef I had did not want to absorb it.  I'm added this to my favortites!

So good! I would give it five stars, but I changed the recipe a bit. Chopped chicken makes it a bit healthier and the hubby doesn't like water chestnuts, so I left those out. Otherwise, tasty and a lot like the wraps you can get in a restaurant.

If you like PF changes lettuce wraps these taste just like them ... instead of the recommended lettuce i used fresh crisp ice berg like they do at pf changs.It was so good. I made it with the Oriental Dipping Sauce from this website, like other before have recommended, good recommendation. I also added a little bit more sesame oil. Instead of 1 tsp i did 1 tbl spoon. The leftovers were just as good.

This reminded me of my favorite restaurants lettuce wraps. Being a vegetarian family I used ½ lb. soy meat and 2 blocks of pre-made savory baked tofu. Very authentic taste and yummy. The family loved it.

We love this recipe!  We use ground chicken or ground turkey and add shredded carrot and fresh minced ginger.  These are also great in warmed soft flour tortillas for a more hearty main dish.

My family flipped over this Rachel! To make it healthier, I used boneless chicken thighs; only had regular ginger in the house and served it with the Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site. What a great recipe and thank you!!

Excellent -- I've made twice -- once with shrimp and once with chicken.  It was great both times.  Didn't have minced ginger.  Added garlic.  Four very picky kids loved it as well.

These were okay. I wanted to recreate the lettuce wraps from PF Changs or California Pizza Kitchen. I added shrimp, Shitake mushrooms, shredded carrot/broccoli, and fresh ginger. It was a little on the bland side and was a bit dry. (We did add a little more of the wet ingredients to make up for the additional ingredients.) After purchasing all of the ingredients, this was expensive, so I think we'll just go out for dinner at one of the restaurants instead of making these again. Oh, and be sure to use Bibb or romaine lettuce because iceberg breaks too easily and doesn't have any nutritional value. I thought it was a three star rating, but my husband was happier with it so I gave it a four.

Fantastic dish. I was looking for something new and interesting to do with ground venison - and this was SO GOOD! Very similar to what I've had in restaurants. I made a couple of adjustments based on other reviewers' suggestions (and because I didn't have the ingredients called for) - used minced fresh ginger instead of pickled, and regular sesame oil instead of dark. I added asian red chile sauce as well. I only had green leaf lettuce and I will definitely use Bibb or butter next time because it would work better as a wrap. Try with the Hot Peanut Sauce from this site.

haven't tried this recipe yet but on this site is a recipe for homemade pickled ginger ---which is very easy to make and thought you all might like to try making your own pickled ginger.

I made these lettuce wraps today and they were soooooo good!! Everyone should try them! I didn't use some ingredients, like the onions, and I substitued the ginger roots for ground ginger and everything turned out fine.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I exchanged ground pork for the beef and used fresh ginger since I had it on hand instead of the pickled.  I came out wonderful and I plan to make it many, many more times.  Even my 2 year old loved it!

these were great. To make them more like my favorite restaurant's, I used ground chicken instead of beef. Next time I'll use iceberg for more crunch.

Great!  We used Romaine leaves and I just trimmed the spine down enough that they rolled nicely without cracking.  We used sesame oil and also topped with Lo Mein (crunchy) noodles.  VERY TASTY!

This was an excellent recipe! It was quick, easy and very flavorful. I have enjoyed the lettuce wraps at Chili's and I think these were every bit as good. I used chicken instead of ground beef and added some matchstick carrots to add a little more crunch. I also served them with a peanut dipping sauce. My husband said it was the perfect combination of flavors and not overpowered by any one flavor. This will become a new "standard" in our household. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a fantastic asian lettuce wrap recipe!  *Very similar to P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps!!  
We make ours with ground turkey and add a little extra hoisin sauce and sesame oil.  It's a great staple at our house.

I just made these and my roommate walked over and said, "OMG those look JUST like P.F. Changs!"
Yummy (the only thing I'll say is make sure you add some asian hot sauce or crushed red pepper because they do need some bite).

Very tasty!  Recipe didn't mention the amount of chili paste to add although optional.  I added a Tbsp to mixture and left the bottle at the table for optional greater spicey flavor.  I also left some plum sauce on the table for conflicting flavor.  I also added twice as much garlic and no ginger/ginger root do to lack of.  I used organic butter lettuce and loved it.  I did notice the high sodium content, possibly due to the brand of soy sauce I used (kikkoman).

LOVED this dish! I was really surprised how great it was. It would have gotten five stars except I definitely found that I had to double the sauce for sufficient flavors. I can't imagine this dish with the sauce it called for. I used 1 lb of turkey meat for a healthier option, used fresh ginger, romaine lettuce and low-sodium soy sauce. I also stopped by a  local chinese restaurant and used the crunchy noodles. Delicious! Thank you!

These are PHENOMINAL!!!  Try with ground chicken.  I also added shredded carrots (not too keen on water chestnuts) for crunch, and made a peanut dipping sauce.

I changed it a little by adding carrots, red peppers, zucchini and some other sauces for more flavor.  But everyone at my house loves it. I served it with rice, and some crunch noodles.  I think that this recipes is awesome.  My 9 year is asking for it for her birthday dinner.

These were great.  Make them with lean ground beef, chicken or pork and they still taste wonderful.  Relatively easy to make, too.

This is an awesome recipe.  My husband doesn't like the lettuce thing, so I serve his over rice.  You can't lose with this.  Tastes just like PF Chang's lettuce wraps.

My husband and I love this recipe!  No, it's not the same as PF Chang's, but it's so yummy and flavorful.  After reading other people's reviews, we made some adjustments, cutting the oil, onion, and the ginger in half.  We made the oriental dipping sauce listed on this website as an extra.  My husband loved it so much, he used the left over sauce to season some handburgers the next day.  YUMMY!  Thanks for posting this recipe!  It's a new family favorite!

YUMMY!!!  I absolutely love this recipe.  I substituted the beef with ground chicken (just food processed raw chicken breasts and cooked in skillet) and added matchstick cut carrots.  If you like the lettuce wraps at Chili's, you'll love this too!  I also whipped up a peanut sauce to go along with this.  My husband keeps asking when I'm going to make this recipe!!

I had an abundance of butter lettuce in the garden, so I decided to give these a whirl.  I'm glad I did, as they were delicious!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and I substituted ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh ginger, but those were the only changes I made.  They were great tasting, they weren't as messy as other lettuce wraps I've made in the past, and best of all, they were healthy!  This is an excellent addition to my recipe box.  :)

Too much umami, imho, so I added a couple tablespoons of finely cut cilantro and fresh mint.  The instructions "assumed" one would combine the meat and the vegetable mixture, but never actually told you to.

The ONLY substitution I made was chicken for the beef. They were excellent. I used 4 chicken breasts and simply diced & sauted. 4 may have been 1 too many since the wraps didn't turn out to be as messy as other reviewers described - the mixture came out quite solid and managable. To add some fun, I serve a wasabi ginger sauce on the side (to spoon into the wrap) - that really did the trick! You can find it in the Asian section at your grocery store usually. I will DEFINITELY make these again!!

Wow, this was delicious!  Like other reviewers I did a chicken version (minced thighs with a knife), and also added pine nuts.  DELICIOUS!  I have made it twice in one week--once for my husband and I, once for company.  Thanks!

These were delicious!  I made them for an asian themed dinner group party and they were liked by all.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers to cut back on the onion, use more of the sauce mixture, and top them with the oriental dipping sauce from this site.  I also substituted chicken to make them lower fat.  They were light, but still substantial enough to be satisfying.  I definitely will make these again.

These wraps were really delicious! I made them w/chicken. When serving I added the sauce suggested by idianal, thanx for your suggestion, it was a nice flavor addition, & topped it off w/some toasted almonds. They were great! Everyone really liked them. I'll make this one again!

These were really good! I made them for company and everyone seemed to like it. I made them following the recipe but then added a little extra sauce because the meat looked a little dry. Great flavor!

This recipe was great, quick and easy!  The taste was not quite PF Changs, but close enough for a weeknight dinner.  I would definitely make this again and I did not change a thing!

These were delicious. We of course did not use beef, we used ground chicken. And I couldn't find the pickled ginger, so we omitted that. One thing that is unclear is when to add the meat back to the mix. So I just never removed it and cooked the onions with it, then added other ingredients. This was truly delicious. We love P.F. Changs lettuce wraps and this is as close as you'll get to them, I think.

This recipe is excellent.  I make it all the time--especially since I eat low fat foods.  I use extra lean ground beef (96% fat free) and omit the oil so the fat content is nowhere near the 20+ grams stated in the recipe's nutritional analysis.  It is also low carb for those who follow that diet.  It is diet food that doesn't taste like you are on a diet.

EXCELLENT!  I seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper, and garlic.  I also combined the beef with the sauce mixture and then made extra sauce to spoon on the wraps as we made them.  Can't wait to make this again.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe.  I increased the hoisin/ginger/soy/rice wine vinegar mix because the mixture seemed too dry, and it was just right that way.

I loved this recipe - have made it twice now.  One time as listed with ground beef and again with ground pork.  Only thing that is missing is WHEN to re-add the cooked meat to the onion mixture.  I agree with another reviewer - use iceberg lettuce; it is plentiful, inexpensive and offers a larger 'bowl' for the good stuff!

Seriously AMAZING! I fell in love with lettuce asian wraps at a restaurant and I was dying to make it at home. This was SOOOOOO much better than anything I've ever had. The ingredients used and sauces were perfect! I used iceberg lettuce instead - because it's so nice and crispy and if you cut off the core the leaves come out like bowl and you can stuff them alot. I made enough for 2 days but we INHALED them in one night! OH also, I used steak instead of the gound beef. (I broiled a marinated steak and then cut it into strips and before the veggies were ready I threw in the steak). Also replaced cooking Sherry for the rice wine and used alot of asian chili paste - YUMMO! thanks Rachel411! And you're right - they sure did drip - part pf the fun!

Great recipe.  I added a bit more hoisin sauce, as I wanted it more moist.  I took this to an outdoor evening picnic and it was perfect.  Everyone raved about the flavors.  One question - do you add the meat mixture back into the sauce at some point? (the recipe is unclear on this).  I added the meat back into the sauce at the end.  I will definitely be making this again.

I've made these twice and was very happy both times.  Used ground chicken instead of beef, though. The first time, I only had leaf lettuce and the second I used butter lettuce. Leaf lettuce held up much better. Although the butter lettuce was more tender, it was messier. I also added shredded carrots for color. Side dishes were homemade naan and homemade hummus. May make them using salmon one day. This recipe is a keeper.

My family liked this, but the whole dinner conversation was about how to make it taste better. Next time I'll season the beef (or pork). That was the biggest thing that I thought would make it better. I would also like more veggies - carrots, maybe zucchini and bamboo shoots.

One of my all time favorite Asian inspired dishes!  I use fresh ginger instead of pickled and omit the green onions due to personal preference.  I also add about a tablespoon of Sriracha for heat.  I serve the wraps with various toppings such as julienned carrots, crushed peanuts, crunchy chow mein noodles and cilantro.  Plus "Quick Egg Roll Dipping Sauce" from this site.  I have also made this into a salad by chopping the lettuce and tossing everything together to avoid a mess.

I made this dish for the first time. Not bad. We enjoyed it during the super-bowl. My son's girlfriend who doesn't eat any meat at all(me too) asked for the recipe.
What I used instead of ground beef was Gardein's version of crumbles.

You can just use naan, tortillas, or pita bread with this. Even if you don't have all the ingredients, it still tastes great.

Super easy to understand and make. I’ve made this several times and now that I already purchased most of the ingredients it’s fast to whip up in a pinch. Couldn’t find Bib lettuce so subbed romaine instead.

I left out the water chestnuts. I like them but the rest of the family does not. I've been thinking of substituting with chopped cashews. 
I will most definitely make this again. It is a family favorite!

We loved this!  Only change was using ground chicken instead of beef because we don’t eat red meat.  So flavorful.

I love lettuce wraps and was really looking forward to these.  I liked them, but something was missing.  They weren’t as flavorful as the recipe that I usually use.  I substituted ground pork for the beef, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This was a first for me and I will definitely make again.  Since I knew my day might be crazy, I prepped as much as possible the night before because between grating ginger, chopping and needing a lot of ingredients that are not in one place (pantry, spice drawer, frig) it took some time to do that and clean up.  OMG, this made pulling it together MUCH more manageable!!    Did not find them as messy as I expected based on other reviewer comments.  The suggestion to make all together as a salad, is a version we will likely try though.  I added some finely chopped red bell pepper as a garnish.  Might try chopped peanuts the next time, but I didn’t have any on hand.

My husband is actually the cook of the house. I showed him his recipe and on a whim we decided to go ahead and get the ingredients to try it. He was very skeptical at first, but he actually had to helpings. I personally was filled after the first helping. There’s only the two of us so the recipe itself actually made enough for us to each have two helpings.?

I made this today for the ladies of my cribbage group.  Doubled the recipe and it was almost gone, serving  6 of us generously.  I served the ginger, carrots, hot sauce and peanuts on the side.  BIG HIT.

I used ground bison (market was out of lean ground beef) & it was excellent! I cooked mushroom & asparagus with the bison. Added sprouts to put on top. There were no leftovers. I will be making again.

I really like these wraps, but two others in my family didn't.  Their reasoning was they don't like a lot of the ingredients, like ginger, soy, and sesame oil.  I liked these enough to make them again, but I guess I will be eating them alone.  :-(

We make this often.  Quick, tasty weeknight meal that usually leaves leftovers for lunch the next day.  I substitute ground turkey for the beef and usually add bamboo shoots and slivered carrots.

I will make it again, but amp up the spice a bit. The flavors according to the recipe came out bland. It barely tasted remotely Asian.  Probably use ground Pork instead.

I pre-cooked a small beef roast and chopped into the mixture. Loved it and prefer that over ground beef.

Yum!! Delicious as is and a dead-ringer to what I’ve had in restaurants. My only advise is not to skip any of these ingredients, as they represent a layering of flavors that makes a big difference in the taste experience.

We just finished eating this delicious dish!  The only substitutions I made were ground turkey instead of beef, and fresh ginger for pickled.  We put some bean sprouts on top for crunch.  It was quite messy so I think we will take another reviewers suggestion and serve it as a salad the next time. Thanks for a wonderful meal!

I used pork instead of beef. Substituted mushrooms for the water chestnuts. Used fresh ginger in place of the pickled ginger. Yummy! Would make again.

Very nice recipe even with gluten free soy sauce. Really yummy.
(one aside....I'd nix the ads the for "toe fungus medicine" that popped up on the recipe page...didn't really add to the "flavor" of things or my desire to try the recipe. I did anyway but...

Made this for a holiday party where i heard lots of people saying "i don't eat carbs", I don't eat gluten", I only eat Keto? So to say the least this went 1st and quick. I make 3lbs of meat & a whole head of lettuce and chips and EVERYONE was super impressed.  I have to admit I was super proud. Definitely a crowd pleaser  weather on a diet or NOT!

I've made it a handful of times, each a little bit different. Every time it needs a little more hoisin sauce than it calls for. Very forgiving and very tasty! Easy to hide a bunch of kale, cabbage, or other veggies in it too.

Trying to stick with a low carb, Keto-inspired diet and this is totally Keto friendly! The meat was a little bland for my taste if you stick to exact recipe which is why I did 4/5 stars, but I added a little more of the soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger and seasonings to taste and we loved it. Used Romaine lettuce which gave it a nice crunch. Next time may do an Asian style cauliflower rice to add to lettuce wraps or as a side. Also, I think chopped peanuts sautéed with the onions garlic etc would be another delicious add-on. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is spot on-delicious! The broth flavor is wonderful, better than restaurant versions. The only changes I made: substituted turkey for beef, added about 8 spears of diced broccoli with the onion. After tasting the final product, added ½ teaspoon Sriracha-it added a bit of heat without compromising the flavor

I use lean ground pork and added some frozen mixed veggies to the pan with the onions. Serve the wraps with rice. One of my favorite dinners to make, fast easy and fairly healthy!

Awesome! Didn't have Asian pepper sauce but used bourbon chicken sauce. Also used ground chicken. Would be great with any ground protein.

Yes, my family is a huge fan of this repipe.  I follow it minus the optional as my kids are young.  It smells amazing to cook, and is a refreshing summer dinner.

Super yummy and refreshing! I used fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger because I don't care for pickled ginger. (Works great) Also added fresh mung beans after I turned off stove to let heat cook a little and gives extra crunch. I recommend the added sauce that someone else mentioned. It did put it over the top. My whole family loved this. Will definitely make this again.

I made it more or less as directed - I did not have ginger, but I did have ginger juice so I added that in stead as well as some roasted sesame seeds. Like others I added fried wontons on top and instead of a wrap, I put it on a salad. Why make it in rotation, I'm not sure - I sauted the onions and garlic with the ground beef then drained out the excess fat. Then added in all the other ingredients with the green onions last. Then I had to walk the dog so it got to sit in the juices for another 15 mins and it was perfect. Thank you so much for a new fave!

I made this for dinner, hoping it would be like the appetizer at P F Changs.  I'm happy to say it came close!  I made it exactly as written minus the pickled ginger and the hot sauce (personal preference). Didn't have lettuce leaves so I tried it over brown rice , then tried it in a pita pocket - delicious. Will definitely make again!

Used our fresh Bibb lettuce from the garden. Added finely shredded green cabbage with the onions and water chestnuts and finely chopped peanut for serving for extra crunch. Would have rated it 5 stars but had to search for appropriate serving sauce to accompany the dish. But overall, this recipe is a keeper!

This was VERY good! Following the advice of other reviews, I did put 2 T of Rice vinegar, 2 T soy sauce, 1tsp sesame oil,  1tsp of roasted red chili paste and 1tsp of chili garlic sauce. I did not use the pickled ginger, but used fresh chopped ginger and also used 3 cloves chopped fresh garlic.
This one is a keeper!

I did add vegetables (chopped broccoli, peas, and carrots), but I don't think that would have much of an effect on the taste of the sauce, which was just alright in my opinion.

I brought home some leftover chicken lettuce wraps from my lunch and hubs ate it and said he loved it. So 8 made this version for him and it was even better then the PF Chang leftovers. The only thing I did different was 8 added some shredded carrots. Whether you do that or not,  this tecipe is PERFECT! Thanks tp who ever submitted this one!

This was a great recipe. I modified it by switching ground beef for ground chicken (seasoned with garlic  powder and white pepper) and I added about 8 oz. of chopped baby portabello mushrooms. I  also used low sodium soy sauce. I have a family member who is watching his intake of red meat for health reasons, hence the protein change. The mushrooms helped to bulk up the recipe in a more cost effective method to get additional servings.  Not sure what the nutrition impacts are, but I would assume more beneficial. I have made this modified recipe three times in the last three weeks.  My family loves it.

Like others, I used fresh ginger instead of pickled ginger.  My husband isn’t fond of onion, so we always cut onion by about 2/3 in any recipe.

Still one of my favorites!  Easiest way to make the drop and sugar roll process is to keep the dough super chilled.  I popped the bowl in the freezer between batches so scooping stayed consistently firm. I also roll in granulated sugar instead of confectioners sugar.  The granulated sugar makes a slightly crispier bite and is less cloyingly sweet than the confectioners.

Doubled for leftovers and made with chicken and turkey. Next time will use iceberg lettuce for more crunch. Will also add some OJ and some other veggies for more crunch. Will make again.

This was a great recipe but I too have my modifications albeit minor ones.  I substituted fresh ginger for pickled ginger and followed the others reviews by increasing the Rice Wine Vinegar and Soy Sauce.  In addition, I also increased the sesame oil to 1.5 tsps for a greater taste.  If you wanted a good healthy crunch topper, add shredded carrots and matchstick cucumbers like I do.  To dress it up even more, I sometimes add chopped peanuts to the mixture.  I neglected to take a picture because it all disappeared too fast.

YUM!! Stretch it into a party-sized dish by adding zucchini and riced cauliflower. We used romaine “boats” instead of other lettuces; also marinated beef.  We all felt wonderful and energized after this yummy meal!

It was pretty darn tasty. I don't think my pre-made Hoisin sauce was a good brand. Turned out too sweet. I used reduced sodium Soya sauce which was good as it was on the verge of being too salty. Next time I will use Tamarind instead.

This is an excellent recipe. I used chicken instead of beef and Powdered ginger instead of pickled ginger and I loved it.

This is the second time that I've made this and it turned out very good.  I actually had all the right ingredients.  The only thing that I added was shredded carrot which gave it a little more crunch and colour.  Last time I made it I didn't have the right kind of lettuce so it was difficult to wrap.  I find using bib lettuce is the best.

I have made this many times and it has become a family favorite. I don't know what the PF Chang version but this is pretty tasty when you don't have that expectation especially. 

I follow the recipe proportions as written. I substitute turkey or chicken ground meat for beef and both have come out great! I add thinly sliced carrots and cucumbers as well as a few pieces of spinach (raw) at the end once making the wraps. 

Another variation - we found that using lettuce was really messy and inefficient at getting all the good in the mouth so we now use Vietnamese rice paper (found at the Asian grocer) to make actual wraps. My kids love it this way - they can roll their own like a crepe and add as much meat or veggies as they want. It takes practice at home to get it so the wrap doesn't stick to itself like tape but it's worth it. I added a photo of the wraps if interested.

Well.  I anticipated very flavorful but it turned out less than what it smelled like. Not sure why bec I measured everything and I add all ingredients. Don’t  know , to me food doesn’t taste as much as it used to.  I may try it again but I think it needs more ginger and more sesame oil. Mmm.  Not sure. ....

Made it with chopped chicken thighs and it was great. I’m sure it is delicious with red meat but I try not to eat read meat. Reason for four stars and not five is because I made the meat change.

Great recipe, my daughter said it was better than PF Chang's!  I like that the sauce it thick and clings to the ground beef. I did top with cilantro which I think is a must.

I doubled this recipe for a family of 6. Paired it with jasmine coconut sticky rice topped with fresh mango...so good. Added matchstick carrots, shiitake mushrooms and fresh instead of pickled ginger. Topped with fine diced red pepper and green onion and peanut sauce from another recipe and oh so good. Even the 9 yr old loved it!

Excellent! made it first time for friends, did all my prep cutting up and assembling the sauce the night before, so actual  cooking was a breeze and fast. Substituted  Mirin  for the hoisin  sauce  to cut down carbs  a smidge  for the friend who is diabetic. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!  Followed recipe, without pickled ginger subbed with ground ginger.  First time I bought sesame oil,  why have I not tried this before, it adds a really nice flavour! 
This was a big hit, will definitely make again, just as written.

Today I will use the white part of bok choy, instead of the water chestnuts... but I've used the regular recipe for the past year about once a month.  Enjoy! it's good

It was so good! My 5-year old son devoured the lettuce wraps and asked me to make them every day. :) I didn't have any soy sauce, so I used amino acids. Definitely a keeper in this household

Very easy and delicious.  Read the most recent reviews but only took the recommendation of ground turkey instead of beef since that is what I had on hand,  I served with sliced radishes, cucumber and grated carrot.  Everyone liked a lot.  I will make another time with ground beef or a beef/pork combo.
My Bibb lettuce from the garden was the icing on the cake!

Made these for hubby and I and used red pepper flakes for a little extra heat. We both don't like water chestnuts so we forwent those. Loved it! Definitely will be making it again.

Definitely a winner!!!  We made the sauce very similar to others...added 1/2T of hoisin and additional 1t of chili paste, we like a little more spice. We used ground turkey...and because it’s so lean we added 1 T of grape seed oil to the mixture after adding the meat. It’s on my new Top 5 and simple to make. The video helped.

Excellent recipe, however it is very dependent on the brand of Hoisin sauce you use.  Like BBQ sauce, every one is different.  We used Asian Kitchen and loved it, then switched brands and were unimpressed.  We like ours with a touch of sweetness.   Anyway, if you don’t love your hoisin when you taste it out of the bottle, you won’t like a lot better in the dish.  Find one you love, and you’ll love this recipe!!

Great taste! I used Oyster Sauce instead of Hoison and it was still plenty sweet. I also made it with 3 lbs of ground chicken so added extra of each. Great dish with rice or by itself since I realized after we had already used our bib lettuce.

I made mine with ground chicken and added mushrooms, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  For my taste, the recipe was bland. I ended up adding more soy sauce, hoisin, sriracha, and salt. Great base recipe and now I know how to personalize it next time.

It was quite tasty but a little too salty. I’m wondering if it was the soya sauce and horizon combination.

I will be making this again.  It had great flavor and although I added a good dash of chili sauce and extra ginger, it was very tasty.  We only had a little leftover for tomorrows lunch but that's because it was so yummy!

I gave it three stars for the flavor but I tried to make a meal out of it.  It is just not enough for a full meal.  The dish needs to have other pairings with it and especially for a man.  My husband did not mind these but went to the frig to  try to find something else.  He is not a big eater either.  I probably would consider this for an appetizer only.

Family favorite! Hubby specially requested this dish to be added to our dinner repertoire! I followed the recipe exactly as written, but substituted the ground beef with lean ground turkey. The dish was still delicious, despite the protein substitution.

This is an easy weeknight dinner (once you get all the ingredients which can be used multiple times-- maybe 5-6 separate dinners)! I omitted the pickled ginger mainly because I was being lazy at the grocery store and had already circled aisle 5 many, many times and didn't want to try finding it. This recipe seemed like it would have tons of flavor anyway and it did! Didn't even notice the missing ingredient. Tips: chop the water chestnuts and onions finely. I also used 85%/15% ground beef and it was a bit too greasy so I definitely recommend leaner beef. Lastly, the grocery store didn't have the recommended lettuce so we used iceberg and it worked just fine. Boyfriend liked the recipe (minus the green onions) so we're going to try it again but next time with ground chicken or ground turkey.

These were amazing... I am definitely making this one again!  My husband didn't love it quite as much as I did (although he still liked it), but in my opinion the flavor and texture for this was just perfect.
I did use romaine lettuce since I prefer it, and also couldn't resist adding some mushrooms to the skillet.
After some initial browning, I put everything for the meat mixture in a slow cooker and cooked it for a short time (1 hr or so) on low so it would be ready and warm when everyone got home, which worked great!

Great recipe! I used ground turkey instead of beef, and since turkey is a little drier, I did about 1.5 times the liquid ingredients, which came out great! I substituted fresh ginger for pickled and Sriracha for the chile pepper paste because those were what I had. I also topped with crushed cashews which added a nice crunch. Loved this dish!

LOVED IT. 

Made it as is using ground beef, also made with chicken. Did a side by side comparison and the ground chicken was the hands down favorite (the ground beef was definitely NOT hated though!) If you're looking for a simple recipe with an Asian flare to take to a pot luck or for large gatherings, PICK THIS DISH and pair it with the Oriental Dipping sauce recipe,  serve it with some steamed white rice and you'll be the hit of the party!

This was really good. I took the advice of another and doubled the vinegar and soy. I also used fresh ginger. This is a winner.

Great base recipe.  I have made this recipe so many times.  Instead of ground beef I use ground turkey and I add a little minced garlic and ground pepper while I’m cooking the turkey.  I also add several more veggies mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and little corns it’s great and the family loves it.  Definitely recommend making the sauce gives it a little more of a kick and we also make some steamed rice on the side.  Enjoy!

It was very good.  I think I will use a bit less Hoisin sauce next time since it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I will be making this again though.

I had Chinese lettuce wraps growing up at home and in restaurants, though they always had arrowhead root (not arrowroot) and not water chestnuts. This was probably a better choice for the kids anyway, as water chestnuts are so mild. My daughter is an extremely picky eater, so I added mushrooms to please her. My son INHALED his wraps. I used 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef, and used iceberg lettuce because that's how I've always known it. :) I did have some non-traditional toppings on hand, such as peanuts, sriracha, and Kewpie mayo (Japanese). I also served with sticky white rice, so the kids could put it in the wraps with the meat as desired. Thanks for a good recipe.

I've never eaten lettuce wraps before, to compare the taste. But I have to say, this recipe was amazing! Even my picky husband really enjoyed them. I didn't have pickled ginger so I used a ginger paste. And instead of chili paste, I used sweet chili sauce, which I just eyeballed. We will definitely keep this recipe!

Awesome! I cannot believe my picky kids would eat this, but Next time I’ll need a double batch. I used apples for a health crunch (you may need a little extra soy, garlic or salt to mute the sweetness.) I also used more ground turkey than beef, for a lower calorie/ fat alternative. Big hit in our home.  :)

Love this recipe for a quick dinner on a busy day. I like to use either meatloaf mix or ground turkey, bother taste great. I use a teaspoon of Sambal as a substitue for the Asian chile pepper sauce.

Did a different take on these.  I made mushroom lettuce wraps instead, no meat. Button mushrooms, green onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, and sautéed. Used fresh butter lettuce for the wraps. Also added very little Panera Thia Chili Lime dressing. Came out great. A good take on a vegetarian lunch idea.

I really enjoyed this. It was easy to make and very flavorful. Here are my minor changes. I used 4 scallions and no other onion. I cooked the white parts with the meat and saved the green parts for the end. Hoisin sauce is a must for this. That's where most of the flavor comes from. I didn't cook the meat in oil because the meat has its own fat. I kept the fat rather than draining it, so didn't add the sesame oil either. I doubled the soy sauce and vinegar. Used ginger paste and skipped the chili sauce. The only thing I might try next time is drain the fat and use the sesame oil instead.

Added twice the hoisin sauce- was to dry without.  Absolutely delicious and both guests took the recipe home with them.  Served with Thai noodles, julienned carrots, bean sprouts and peanut sauce.

Delicious, easy, and filling recipe! I made a few minor modifications: I omitted the chestnuts and instead added chopped bell pepper and cashews. Not sure exactly what kind of lettuce I had... not the one recommended... but it still worked great! I also used lean ground pork meat since we like pork better, and used fresh grated ginger instead of pickled ginger. Added some grated carrots on top as well. Fantastic flavor. Highly recommend and will make again!

These were great!!!  Will definitely make again!!  Have recently adopted a Keto lifestyle--so I now make my own sugar free hoisin sauce and regular ginger adding a small amount of sugar free replacement for the pickled ginger and followed the recipe as closely as I could.  STILL is fantastic!!!

Turned out really yummy. I used ground pork. Also I added some finely chopped peanuts and some extra water chestnuts for more crunch. I used a good bit more than a dash of chili sauce- more like 3 tsp because we like the heat.

I will try this again but with a bit less chestnuts and also a little less hoisen sauce...I did add some extra sprinkles of soy sauce to tone it down. Spiciness was great, just enough bite. Lastly, next time I will use iceberg lettuce...it's sturdier. All in all an ok dish and fun to eat.

This was just so plain. Even with the extra dipping sauce, I was disappointed in this recipe. I didn't have the optional Asian chili sauce, so maybe that's just very necessary. I also had to use a head of iceberg lettuce. it didn't taste bad necessarily, just pretty tasteless, which is why I didn't give this recipe one star. I'll definitely use a different one next time and will probably use pork instead of ground beef as well.

Have made this recipe a couple of times and both me and my sons loved it. My sons don't eat meat so I substituted the ground beef for veggie ground round. I also added grated carrots and chopped portobello mushrooms  because I wanted to add a couple more vegetables . Delicious!

This is a great recipe!! I make it all the time and when my husband comes home from work he says the house smells great. I follow the recipe to a "T", only omitting the ginger (personal tastes) and chestnuts (use silvered almonds instead). LOVE this recipe. Thank you for sharing!!

I love this recipe!  I made a few changes.  I did not add water chestnuts because my husband does not like them.  I used baby romaine leaves and just used them as a tray basically.  I used regular ginger rather than pickled ginger and I used a white onion. And I used white vinegar because it’s all I had.  I have made this recipe a few times and will continue to make it.

Great recipe. I did a few garnishes for additional flavor: chopped mandarin oranges, crushed peanuts and a drizzle of Sriracha. Pure awesomeness

Awesome flavor. Real easy. I used romaine lettuce which maybe doesn't hold up as well as the Boston or butter.  But the filling was so good it would be nice over rice or noodles, which is what my son ended up doing.

Boston letttuce wraps are too bitter. Beef mix is bland and needed more hydration than what Hoisen gives.

I have made this following the recipe, basically eyeballing the measurements, and I have not had one person not ask for the recipe.  It's that good.  I do add more water chestnuts occasionally to give it more of a crunchy texture. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious. The pickled ginger is adds a nice undertone so I think it's definitely worth shopping for. One change was the use of iceberg lettuce. We'll use plum sauce as an add-on sauce next time. Definitely a repeater for our family.

I have tried several lettuce wrap recipes and I am keeping this one. I used ground chicken and fresh ginger because of preference but followed the recipe as written. I also added peanuts for a little crunch.

I am not a seasoned chef and just trying to find some meals that can easily be put together for the family. This was amazing!! Super easy and satisfied the palates of three young children and four picky adults. I used some leftovers on pasta the following night and it was delicious. You could easily do tacos with this as well with leftovers. Really great recipe and will definitely be using often.

I did not really love the hoisin sauce in this recipe.  Came out too sweet.  Had to add more vinegar and added some toasted sesame oil to counteract the sweetness.  I agreed with others that it was missing something.   Added fresh cilantro at the end which greatly improved the meat!  Also added fresh ginger in addition to the pickled.   Added about 6 chopped baby bellas with the white onions.    Added a dipping sauce and chopped cashews for topping when serving.  Everyone loved it and it did make for an impressive appetizer.

Delicious. MAke a double batch of the suggested sauce, which boosts this to a true five-star recipe. 

I used ground turkey in the 20 oz package and a healthy tsp of chile sauce.  Also, I used romaine lettuce, which worked really well.

I left out the chile, green onions, and ginger just because I don't really like those ingredients. I thought the meat turned out great with the sauce! Im not sure why some people were disappointed or did not like the taste of this but I think it tastes as it should but I'm also someone who is used to the taste of the ingredients for these wraps. I measured the ingredients as is and didn't feel it needed to be adjusted in any way.

Easy to make and delicious. I didn't have the  pickled ginger but still the taste was awesome.I drizzled siracha on top for extra heat before devouring it.  Love this recipe. Will do this again and again and again.

I made this like instructed in the recipe. It was really good! I would make again! We ate it on napa cabbage leaves. I served it with chilli paste and sweet chilli sauce on the side as well as shredded carrots.

This recipe was a big hit tonight. The only changes I made were: added some fresh bean sprouts to the mix and used romaine lettuce leaves because I had both of these on hand. Served with hosin sauce on the side and baked some frozen egg rolls for contrast. Will definitely make again!

This is really good.  I made it with Chicken which I minced by hand instead of ground beef. (personal pref)  My wife and I absolutely loved it (kids are picky).  Its such a fast and easy dish, this is going on my household regular rotation.

I made this exactly like the recipe said because I don't think the recipe should be reviewed unless you followed it exactly. It was very good, the only thing is next time I make this I won't be using ground beef. I would either use chicken or ground pork. Other than that, I really liked it.

Wasn't quite the same as what you would get at Pei Wei BUT I was able to make sure I knew what was in there ;) Next time I'm going to add a bit more ginger in for a bit of snap and some of the hot pepper oil.

We made this tonight and it was EXCELLENT! The only change I made was to use regular ginger and not pickled ginger and I used about 2 table spoons of it. Everyone loved it. Super easy to make, easy to clean up and we were able to serve it as a finger food in an outdoor setting. I definitely recommend it and will be making it again.

Followed the directions on these as noted and they were good but I would have liked a little more "kick". I couldn't find dark sesame oil so I just used regular sesame oil....maybe that made the difference(?). I'm not sure but I will definitely make again since it was fairly quick and easy and still tasty enough.

Very tasty. Couldn't find butter lettuce with leaves large enough so used large Iceberg lettuce. Not the best answer...way too crisp and fell apart. It was just for the two of us so it was fine to use our forks!

OMG this was soooo delicious!  I followed exactly plus followed suggestion to add matchstick carrots for crunch factor.  I had never used pickled ginger before and I found it easier to work with than fresh ginger.  Easy to chop, not stringy and more tolerable for those not keen on ginger.
I only wished I could find a lettuce bigger than my Bibb for easy of handling.  It  was kinda messy to eat with hands while watching tv.  Would be equally messy at a cocktail party.  All in all, I'll make it again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We've never had anything like it at a restaurant, so can't compare it to anything - we just thought it was excellent!  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, and romaine leaves for bibb lettuce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I might try another reviewer's suggestion of adding 2 Tbl sweet Thai chili sauce.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The hamburger seemed to overwhelm the Asian feel of the dish.  I added more chili paste to perk it up but it just missed on my expectations for a flavorful Asian wrap.

Delicious!  I didn't use the chile sauce as our family isn't big on spicy, and substituted ground ginger powder for pickled ginger so it wasn't as strong of a flavor.  I also used Iceberg lettuce, which was cool and crisp, but it was hard to separate the leaves, so next time will use the bibb or butter lettuce as suggested. Got rave reviews from husband and 10 year old.  Will definitely make again!

Couldn't find butter lettuce so used Bib, which broke apart too easily. Very tastey--husband liked also.

I used half garlic chili sauce and May Ploy for a little sweetness.  I sent the recipe to our  12 yr old grandson to make.

First...use ground Chicken or Pork rather than Beef; Second, you'll also need some flaked red pepper; Third...you MUST have some quick fried Mai Fun rice noodles to accompany the wraps; Fourth...some finely chopped water chestnuts.

I didn't add ingredients that stated optional since it was my first time. If I try it again I will try adding the extra as I felt the meal was lacking something. Good but not great.

I made  a few small tweaks to make this a vegan recipe but it was delicious! I omitted hoisin and made my own fresh chili paste and i  used fresh ginger and shredded carrots. Black rice instead of white and this recipe was delicious. A great starting point to make this recipe multiple ways. If I could give 4.5 stars I would.

We like ours tangy, so we increased the vinegar and pickled ginger.  Also, just browning the meat with a spatula didn't give the consistency of lettuce wrap filling.  After cooking, I cut it even finer to get more of a minced texture.

Great recipe. I add some grated carrots for a little color and texture. But not needed. Very good flavor. I also use butter lettuce. It seems to roll easier without cracking or breaking. Enjoy.

A favorite in my house! I usually use ground turkey instead of beef, cut the onion in half, add an extra tablespoon of soy sauce, and use about 2 teaspoons of sriracha. It's an easy, healthy, quick dinner.

Awesome flavor! I needed to double all the sauce ingredients except the green onion as it was a little too dry. Used ground turkey and it was fine.

This was a HUGE winner for my friends and family. It gotten eaten right up. Just simply delish -- just like at PF Changs only beef not chicken -- which was a nice change! I followed the recipe exactly.

Made this as written, FANTASTIC! 3 dined on this and they were  practically licking the plates.  We didn't make any of the sauce recommendations,  but we stock many Asian sauces and used what was on hand. I preferred the hoison  while others liked the sweet soy. Ultimately the choice is yours, it doesn't require any though. Ask me what we're having tomorrow? Go ahead, c'mon, go ahead.

I didn't make any changes because I like to taste it the way it was written before deciding if I think it needs something else.   We ate it open face on the lettuce leaves because we used this as a main dish rather than finger food.  The leaves aren't really big enough, in my opinion, to wrap a significant amount of the dish.  But I enjoyed it as a alternative Asian dish but still the flavor of stir fry.  My daughter, picky eater, didn't like the flavor of the Hoisin sauce,  but I'm not sure what leaving that out would do to the overall taste.  Maybe I'll try next time and see how that is.

It was easy to make and tasted delicious!  Bibb lettuce goes by several names just be sure that you get a head that will act as a cup.  Iceberg or romaine might be a better choice.  I will make it again the next time we have a homemade Chinese feast!

I made this with everything except the water chestnuts. I added thin carrot slices, and doubled the garlic (we love garlic). I served it with butter lettuce leaves and some siracha and sweet chili sauce to squirt on top of our wraps (we ate them like tacos).

They were a hit, next time I'm going to add some crunchy peanut butter and go for a Thai flavor.

I've made this numerous times now as my family loves it.  I think I could cook it every week and no one here would complain.   I can't find butter lettuce here, but Romaine works great too.  Spice level can obviously be easily upped if you like it hotter, but the recipe as written works fine for my family - a daughter who likes things hot and myself who wants them mild (the lettuce tempers the heat for me.)  We use ground turkey as we don't like beef and that works great for us (and lowers the fat). The only bad part is that there are  no leftovers because even if I make a bigger batch - it's all eaten! Yummy!

I made this dish w chicken instead of beef and added shredded carrots for a little crunch on top.  Turned out AWESOME!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Also, make the sauce that other reviewers are talking about.  It is a great companion.  I don't care if it tastes like PF Chang's lettuce wraps or not....a good dish is a good dish.

Very good, full of flavor.  Made no substitutions and  I  had to buy ingredients I do not usually have on hand,  but  it was worth it since I will  surely make these again.  The family loved them!

We do not eat red meat so I used ground turkey and it was fantastic.  Very similar to what we get at PF Chang's.  Now, if I can only find a recipe for the sauce they put on the lettuce wrap, I'd be all set.

I made this! But I used ground chicken.  I also added more veggies chopped for more texture.  I love bok choy and a few water chestnuts, chopped carrots etc!!! It is a definite crowd pleaser!!!

Awesome recipe! I used ground turkey instead of beef, fresh ginger (about 2T), and only used half of the turkey I made so the sauce ratio was perfect! Will be keeping this recipe in my rotation!

Really yummy recipe.   I did what the comments suggested and made the sauce on the side to add and topped with thinly cut carrots..  Super yummy ..would get a different lettuce next time it was small pieces and hard to wrap. Very messy

Awesome flavour! And making the PF chang sauce to drizzle on top of everything made it even better. We ate it as a salad since our attempt at doing wraps with young kids was a tad messy and harder to eat.

I saw the  sauce for lettuce mix wrap Panda brand at the asian market for $2.89. I followed the recipe on this website but I used the lettuce wrap ready made mix for the sauce Just added little bit of sesame oil, little sugar , a tablespoon of rice vinegar at the end to the chicken according to your taste or you can just skip it. It turned out really good . I topped the chicken with fried rice noodle( it will puff up on very hot oil quickly when ready) for some crunch and dash of Siracha (optional). It was delish.

I feel like it's a safe bet to make a recipe that has over 2,000 reviews and expect something great. Well that's I got! Super easy and quick! This is straight up fantastic. I did use fresh ginger since that's what I had.

I liked this recipe but wish I would have added more heat and less sweet from the Hoisin sauce. I'll keep making different versions of this type recipe untill I find one I really like.

I didn't do the pickled ginger  but did the rest. I'd say it has potential but just needs that over the top kick. 
I have made a knock off PF Chang recipe with chicken and a secret sauce and prefer that one.

My family enjoyed these lettuce wraps.  I did make it with 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork.  The only negative was how to roll up the meat filling with the lettuce.   Will have to work on that.  The sauce got a number of compliments.

Was wonderful and very easy. I suggest using the lettuce they tell you to use. Ice berg lettuce is too difficult because it's not mailable. My dad said it was "a party in his mouth." I also used bean sprouts in my recipe and a little more of the hoisin sauce (about a tablespoon more). I also used fresh ginger but I added just a little since it is so strong.

Easy enough to make, I omitted the chili paste as we're not into heat. Not much flavor, I'll try again and get some chili paste and some rice noodles for the top. Hoping that the chili paste will add some flavor without the heat.

Really tasty - everyone in my family loved it. Doubled it and had leftovers for a family of 5.  Next time I'll probably use ground turkey and toss in some bell peppers or other veggies.

At first, I was intimidated by all the ingredients, but sucked it up cause my family pressured me into it. Honestly it wasn't as hard as I thought! Totally yummy! Clearly not PF Changs, but cloy enough!

Awesome recipe... agreed with the alternative sauce: 2tsp sesame oil, 2T soy sauce, 2T rice vinegar (we use sushi seasoning), 1 T chile paste.  
Have tried using living butter lettuce instead of iceberg and while the butter lettuce is much more presentable and easier to roll it does have a more bitter taste than the plain old iceberg.  
We also use ground Turkey.

Love this recipe! I only changed 2 things: fresh ginger instead of pickled and oyster sauce instead of hoisin (I had those on-hand). Super yummy and easy to make.

This was very good. I used ground chicken instead of beef, but other than that I didn't change a thing. Hubby loved it! He ate leftovers  for 2 days afterward.  Made some spicy garlic eggplant  and white rice to go with with.  This will definitely go into my rotation.

Very easy and taste great, I did add green peppers and carrots to mine. A small tweak but a nice one.

This recipe was great! Next time I'm going to add some chopped snow peas and shredded carrot for crunch, maybe throw in some chopped peanuts, and then just before serving add some Thai basil, cilantro or even mint. Oh, and I made this with ground pork. It was great!

This is delicious! I was skeptical, because I've made lettuce wraps before with "Thai" -style sauce of fish sauce, lime, brown sugar, chilies, etc. and really love that, however... Husband, son and I devoured these. I made a few slight changes, though: used a leek instead of an onion, used fresh ginger instead of pickled, added a handful of shredded carrots and made 1.5 times the amount of sauce. Also served on shredded green cabbage because it's easier to eat this way (especially for my son, who has braces). I put out Sriracha and cilantro so we could garnish as desired. Will make this again and again!

Omitted the minced ginger & Asian chili since I didn't have it but substituted with a Thai garlic chili pepper sauce (2 tsp) and it worked awesome.  To me, the sauce was easier to find and would work well with other Asian dishes. I also put all ingredients in the crock pot and set on low for about 5 hours. It turned out perfect. We even used regular head of lettuce and it has fine. I cooked it with some rice as a side.

I made these using ground chicken rather than ground beef, as per feedback from other reviewers.   There was no Boston Bibb lettuce at the grocery store, so I opted for green leaf lettuce instead.  Unfortunately, the leaves didn't work as wraps (rookie mistake), so I ate my "filling" on a bed of lettuce instead.  And my husband, who loves his carbs, ate his on a bed of rice.  The flavour of this dish is fantastic!  My husband was still talking about how nice this dinner was the next day, which means this recipe has earned itself a permanent spot on our rotation.

*UPDATE*  I made this recipe again, this time with beef.  I am not sure which I prefer - beef or chicken.  Both are great.  This recipe is deceptively quick and easy; no need to be put off by the long list of ingredients.  A definite keeper.

Oh man, are these good! Made them almost exactly  per the recipe. I put in less sesame oil (1/2 tsp) because I'm not overly fond of it. This was so good I could eat it for several days in a row for supper. Some of us are it with the lettuce, one family member preferred a whole wheat tortilla& another put it on a bun. This would be great on rice as well. Made this again with a chicken I had baked. Deboned chicken , sautéed/warmed rest of the ingredients. Used radishes instead of the bunch of table onions. Added extra pickled onions & added cilantro. Yum!

This was excellent! I followed the recipe, except for pickled ginger which I did not have. Husband loved it, too, and suggested putting it in rice paper with noodles. Served it with the Korean Cucumber Salad from here. Definitely be making both of these dishes again!

These were yummy!  I made them as per the recipe except I used ground turkey, no chili sauce (didn't have any), and added a bit more hoisin sauce because of the lack of chili sauce. I also diced up raw carrots very small and sprinkled these on each serving.   Served with fried rice noodles, though these were not necessary, just a nice touch. Definitely will make these again.   Also served with sushi rolls and Cole slaw.

I made this without the ginger and I used romaine lettuce. For crunch I usually like diced cucumber , but I was out, so I chopped up some carrots and cauliflower and soaked it in soy sauce. If I had Teriyaki, I would have used that since it has more depth than soy but it was still good for texture.

I used ground chicken instead of beef.  I also added one cup of diced baby bella mushrooms. Cooking them to a golden brown seperately after chicken was done. The moisture of the mushrooms compensated for the drier chicken nicely.   I skipped both the garlic and the ginger.   Very forgiving recipe I eyeballed measurements and it turned out fantastic.  Coupled with super crisp Ice berg lettuce bowls and it was  a crowd pleaser.

Thought it was really yummy! Didn't have beef, so made it with ground turkey. Added some bamboo shoots and peas/carrots mix. I also made strips of sweet red peppers and avocado to put on top. Lots of veggies!

I used the sauce but to simplify the veggies I used a packaged coleslaw mix, just cook until warm so they were still crunchy, as someone else pointed out iceberg lettuce has good crunch but does not bend so easily so used romaine, the end is crisp and the other folds over easily, did not have water chestnuts so used chow mein noodles they worked out great . Will make this again the versatile  nature of it is sweet--any veggie and so called vessel, a little salty for my taste will try to figure out how to reduce that next time. Love spicy so added a tablespoon of sambal oleck that suited my taste.

We enjoyed these wraps!  Delicious!  The  lettuce I used was the Butter Lettuce and it was too flimsy so will try something different next time.

We liked this a lot. Didn't make any changes besides using fresh ginger instead of pickled. I need bigger Bibb lettuce next time as mine (living butter lettuce) was too small to wrap.

This is an awesome recipe. I did double the sauce. I also added shredded carrot on top before serving for color. I did not add cooking oil to the ground beef while browning it. There is no need-- and I used our own grass fed angus that is extremely lean-- my hubs declared they were better than PF Changs.

I made this with sausage because that's what I had on hand but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This was lick-the-bowl good and will definitely be a go-to appetizer for family and for company.

This recipe is amazing.  The only changes I would make, is to increase the amount of soy sauce and hot sauce in the recipe, as we had to add additional afterward.  Very healthy, full of flavor.  Loved it!

These were just like PF Chang's lettuce wrap appetizer but way better because I got to control the amount of salt and oil used to cook! Used ground turkey and fresh (not pickles) minced ginger. YUM!! Woah.

Really great and easy recipe. My 11 yo daughter made this for our family for dinner tonight. It was excellent. Only substitute used was using fresh ginger purée on hand instead of the pickled ginger. Parents enjoyed it on the patio with a nice white wine while the kids gobbled it up at the kitchen island. We doubled the recipe for 4 of us to enjoy as an entree. This will be a keeper for summer dinners.

Made these for dinner tonight and WOW!! It was so flavorful, so juicy and with the butter lettuce, it was just perfect. These wraps were amazing!! This was definitely a hit with the family so I will be adding this to my list of favorite dinner recipes. Once you have all of your ingredients in place this is a super quick dinner to make and EVERYONE will be going back for seconds and thirds.

This is my favorite Asian lettuce wrap recipes! I make it with chicken though, not ground beef. I use red wine instead of  red wine vinegar. And it turns out soooo good!! My family loves it! This has become one of my family's favorite dinners! Goes great on top of Butter lettuce or Boston lettuce.(Ice Berg lettuce kills it.) Goes really good with stir fried vegetables, or my egg rolls. The quality of your food (ingredients) makes a huge difference! I use organic foods only. Have tried with regular food (bought from low quality stores) and it doesn't turn out nearly as good. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Very tasty, but I would prefer it with chicken rather than ground beef.  My mother-in-law and I both thought these were very good, but we could not convince my husband.  I've tried Asian lettuce wraps a few times now but somehow substituting a piece of lettuce for a tortilla is beyond DH's comprehension.  I literally had to tell him, "pretend it's a burrito, only with lettuce."  I'll still slip this dish in every once in a while because I thought the seasoning was delicious.

Made this as the recipe described, except used fresh ginger. It was really tasty, but found it a little difficult to eat as a lettuce wrap. Ended up serving the mixture over rice, which was good except next time I'll double up on the sauce ingredients so it's not so dry.  Great flavor, and an excellent way to use ground beef when you want something different!

I had no beef so used pork which is more traditional in these wraps otherwise known as Rainbow Ice.  I lost my years-old recipe and after looking through various recipes on the 'net, decided to use this recipe. I actually think this recipe is better - it's very good, nice and moist.   However, one must 'paint' the lettuce leaf with a little Hoisin sauce before placing the filling in the leaf. Even though Hoisin is already part of the ingredients, it makes a difference.

Fairly simple, tasty, and healthy! A great party dish as it is self-serve.

I really loved the flavor and texture of this recipe. I did change one thing, and that is the use of turkey burger instead of beef burger. Great Recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to make it with ground chicken instead of beef because I am on Weight Watchers.  My husband is gluten intolerant so because I could not find a Hoisin Sauce that was gluten free I made it myself--- very easy.  We definitely will make again-- actually I am making tomorrow night.  Enjoy!!

This was amazing!  I added the vermicelli noodles, shredded carrots, and peanuts like other chefs did, and the crunch was delightful!  My hubby loved it as well, and pigged out.  LOL! =)

I've made this several times and it's always a hit!  With the meat and lettuce, I put out bowls of rice noodles and shredded carrots.  They add delicious texture.
Update:  I made them with ground pork and they were delicious.

This was pretty simple and easy, with good flavor. We used minced ginger instead of pickled and iceberg lettuce, other than that, followed recipe.

I don't care for ginger so it doesn't get it.  Also didn't have rice vinegar so used red wine vinegar.  Still fantastic with those changes.  Also most often use ground turkey or chicken, it's just as good as the pork.

This was wonderful.  The second time I made it I used ground turkey and added bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and mushrooms and it was even better.  Think about your favorite Chinese dish and go for it.

I made this with ground turkey breast as I'm trying to reduce the amount of red meat we eat.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was healthy, low-carb and delicious.  Next time I will add a few tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds or toasted almonds to add a little more crunch.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was fantastic! I didn't have water chestnuts so I used bamboo shoots like someone else suggested. Also didn't have picketed ginger so I used fresh. Other then that followed recipe to see T. We topped our wraps with bean sprouts a squeeze of fresh lime and a little fresh cilantro. I will definitely be making this again soon.

I would like it better mixed in with some fried rice.  I like lettuce, and have used them in place of taco shells.  I just did not care for them much.  My husband really liked them.

I tried this 2 ways, as written and grudgingly with soy crumbles. Honestly the vegetarian option was pretty good. I think the flavor was tasty, a classic Asian profile. For me, it was just too meaty. I think if it was cut in half with rice I would have liked it better. I think this would be a better appetizer than main course.

These are very tasty! I'm a big fan of the PF Changs wraps and thought I'd give these a try. I did sub ground chicken, and like other reviews used a bit more of the wet ingredients except for the sesame oil. I also doubled the water chestnuts, just because I really like them.  My guy thought they were better than Changs! Will make these again for sure. Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent!  Served in lettuce and fried in egg roll wrappers.  Go VERY light on hoisin sauce and sesame oil. Have used Vidalia onion in place of Chinese onion. Smaller amount. Seemed fine.  Served with my dumpling dipping sauce.

My whole family loved this recipe, 8 year old picky son gave it a big thumbs up. Most reviewers used chicken or turkey instead of ground beef- I think all would work just fine. I used 3 cloves of  garlic instead of 2 and threw it in with 2 teaspoons of fresh ginger after I sauted the onion and let those cook for about 30 seconds before adding the sauce. I did make a dipping, which many people recommended: 1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste and chopped green onion. Great Dinner!

Easy  to prepare and packs a lot of flavor!  I used ground turkey, and serve it with a teaspoon of sushi rice in the lettuce wraps.

I thought these were really good but my husband said they were boring.  I would definitely make them again!  I did add the sauce recommended by other reviewers. Also, I made these with ground pork instead of beef but either way would be yummy I think!

Delish, easy, and crowd pleasing! I used romaine lettuce, added a slice of lime to everyone's plates, and a bowl of carrot shavings to the table. The suggested chili sauce is a must: 1tsp sesame oil, 2T soy, 2T rice vinegar, 1T chile paste, sprinkled with chopped green onions (skipped sugar).

Since I'm a vegetarian, I used soy crumbles instead of ground beef.  All of the carnivores liked it, too!  I didn't have pickled ginger so I used ground ginger, and it was fine.  Used low salt condiments.

We liked it! I doubled the amount of sauce because it was a little dry, and put it on top of shredded lettuce to make what my hubby called an "Asian Taco Salad". Next time I make it, I will try it with rice, and maybe add some mushrooms and bean sprouts. It's a real good base for a lot of "add ins" because it's so good.

Really tasty and always popular for entertaining or dinner parties as an appetizer. I usually add extra hoisin sauce, use low sodium soy sauce and use ground turkey instead of beef and still tastes great and is a little bit healthier. I've substituted regular white wine vinegar when we were out of rice vinegar and it did not affect the taste,l negatively at all.

Use ground chicken instead of ground beef.  Lowers the fat and is similar to a popular restaurant chain who also uses chicken.  Also good in a tortilla- we tend to over stuff our lettuce and it splits.

I had to make a gluten free version so I substituted HV brand Korean BBQ sauce for the hoisin sauce and added about 2 tablespoons honey. Also substituted Braggs liquid aminos for the soy sauce. It was a huge hit.

Super delicious! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that this is not a recipe for beef....it does much better with ground pork, turkey or chicken. I added Chinese 5 spice and used fresh instead of pickled ginger. I was in lettuce wrap heaven.

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly. Used half pork and half ground beef.  It could have used a little more salt and I might decrease the ginger just a tad next time.  But that is just nit picking.  I will try turkey next time.  I am saving this recipe to make again.  What a nice change to our regular routine. Thanks for a great recipe.

My lettuce wraps tasted great. I followed the recipe but left out the chile pepper and pickled ginger. I sliced the onions (instead of chopping them) for flavor only and removed them just before serving.  I had to add more hoisin and soy sauce, and a little more garlic to add more flavor. Easiest way is to pour directly into the mixture and taste as you go along. You will know when you need more of something.

Go easy on the sesame oil though. I added only what was instructed and I could definitely taste the "oil".

This is one of our absolute favorite meals in our house! Even for my 2 and 4 year old. I've made it with ground beef, chicken, and turkey but turkey is by far our favorite! I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze the extra. I never in my wildest dreams imagined I could enjoy a meal without some serious carbs this much!

This is 5 stars with the following changes: sautéed up garlic and fresh ginger with some zucchini and peppers then added ground turkey. The sauce is made of 2 T rice wine vinegar, 2T fish sauce, 1T Sabah chili garlic sauce, 1 tsp tamarind sauce and 2 T hoisin. Added some cashews and fresh squeezed lime. Served in lettuce with sliced cucumber. So very very tasty. This is going to be a regular. I love dishes that every bite is " this is good".

My husband and I loved this! I love lettuce wraps and I couldn't believe I could make some this good in my own kitchen. I added a little more soy sauce and added some Asian peanut chili sauce to sweeten the flavor but we ate it all up.

Made these for dinner tonight. I made a few changes, like using ground pork instead of the ground beef. We didn't have the pickled ginger, so left that out. I also grated carrots and thinly sliced small cucumbers for toppings. They gave some extra color and healthy additions.  Doubled the recipe, to have leftovers for lunches. Next time, though, I won't double the sauces. A bit too much sauce and salty for my taste. I really like the water chestnuts as they gave a nice crisp crunch to the wrap. This was very easy to put together, especially on a busy weekday night! Thanks for sharing this recipe on Allrecipes.

These are fab. I used shredded carrots for guests to top it also I made the asian noodles, the clear ones i cell cellophane noodles, a swatch of these also on top, serve with chili sauce and my guests loved them. I didn't want to look for pickled ginger, so i peeled some down which I keep i freezer, combined sugar and vinegar and let the piece I was going to use marinate about an hour. It worked.

You need to modify it to love it. Most reviewers added to it, so I took notes & this is what I did:  I made the recipe exactly as written (except I didn't have any water chestnuts). My intention was to make one of the reviewer suggested dipping sauces. When I tasted the recipe, it was ok, but far from awesome, so I added the dipping sauce ingredients right to the recipe & let the sauce created thicken in the meat. SUCCESS!! Added to original recipe: 1 tsp sesame oil, 2 Tbsp soy, 2Tbsp rice vinegar, 1Tbsp chili garlic paste (label has a rooster & you can see the pepper seeds), 1/2 tsp sugar, 2 additional garlic cloves. As written, it's a 3 star recipe, but if you take time to read reviewer comments, you can improve most recipes.

I added a small bag of chopped mixed cabbage and carrots and it certainly fortified it. It does need a crunch so I think a fried noodle or wonton would be a nice addition. It took less than 30 minutes and everyone ate it so it's a keeper.

I've made this a few times but with ground turkey or pork instead of beef. A few other minor changes include adding a bit of fish sauce, sliced carrots, and sesame seeds to it. I usually don't add ginger but have used fresh ginger occasionally. Always comes out fantastic.

This recipe is ballin. The fresh taste of the lettuce perfectly contrasts the salty flavorful ground beef mix. Match made in heaven.

Very good and easy. For added freshness, crunch and natural sweetness, wrap in large leaves of green cabbage instead of lettuce and use pork instead of beef. Needed a little extra salt in my opinion to bring the flavors together, as well as more chili paste to kick it up a bit. Better the next day.

I made these many times because we love these! I adjusted recipe often by
-adding diced peppers to the onions
-using the ginger in a squeeze tube instead of fresh ginger (only bc I didn't have the fresh)
-adding only 1 tsp of hoisin because for us, it's really overpowering
-used only 1/2 onion, which was plenty
-no water chestnuts of my family
-and if you don't have the chile sauce you can adjust with something similar
Really, really liked this a lot! My kids who are 7 and 9 love it too!

Man oh man! Delicious!  I didn't have Bibb lettuce so I made Romaine Boats.  Also, I use chicken instead of beef.  Soooooo good! Really simple, just lots of chopping.  I'm going to make this for next girls out night and use the baby bibbs for appetizer size. I love this recipe!  Update: Made it with ground turkey....easy peasy and super yummy!

Definitely make the sauce as suggested by another reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste)
add shredded carrots to meat mixture, use chicken or turkey instead of beef.

This is now on my list of all time favorite meals!!  I made as written, however I omitted the ginger as I could not find in the store.  It was the best lettuce wrap we have had!!  My family requested this be made often....the filling was so good we wanted to lick the bowl!

A really great base recipe to "play" with. Like several other reviews, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. But I made a few too many tweaks to warrant a 5.

Definitely use ground turkey or chicken - I think beef is far too fatty for this recipe, plus they're healthier. Be sure to break up the meat into very small pieces while it's cooking. I used fresh grated ginger instead of the pickled.

Instead of adding the veggies to the cooked meat (except for some onion), I prepped them to be added to the lettuce "packages" before eating. I used sliced water chestnuts, finely sliced carrots, thinly sliced radish, sliced scallions, matchstick cucumbers and thinly sliced onion (all uncooked).

I spread a very thin amount of hoisin on each lettuce leaf before adding the meat to help it stick (I used a pastry brush), then added the veggies and rolled each one up. Absolutely delicious!

Used chicken instead of ground beef, ground ginger and made my own hoisin. I omitted the green onions and water chestnuts since I didn't have them and otherwise followed ingredients / directions. LOVED this with some white rice and stir fried veggies to accompany. DELICIOUS dinner!!

I've been making this while on my Daniel Fast so of course I've had to make changes to the recipe. I used garbanzo beans (3 cans)in place of the ground beef, one small yellow onion, about a Tbsp of minced garlic, about 4-5 Tbsp of soy sauce, one bunch of green onions, a Tbsp of Smucker's Natural Chunky Peanut butter, a dash of black pepper, and the waterchest nuts. I followed the directions for onions and then added the other ingredients. I added about 3 Tbsp of Szechuan Spicy Stir Fry Sauce at the end to give it a kick. Tastes great and has become a regular staple when I do my fast or am looking for a vegetarian night.

These are always a huge hit in my house! I recommend adding a little more sesame oil, it adds a more intense asian flavor!

Make this recipe often. I use ground chicken breast . I put one whole can of diced water chestnuts, whole can of bamboo shoots, and a whole can of sliced mushrooms  (all drained) and I double the sauce to cover the added veggies. I like to go heavy handed with the chili sauce bc we like spicy . Great recipe!

The sauce was perfectly balanced.  A bit sweet and earthy but not too sharp or salty, and perfected by the acid from the lime.  I made this with gardein beef chunks to make it vegetarian.  Subbed in fresh ginger.  Will make again.

I've never had Asian lettuce wraps before so I have nothing to go by, but these were excellent! I did use ground pork per recommendations, but it would be great with whatever meat you choose. Only had dried ginger so went with a few shakes of that. Made a double-batch of a sauce recommended by the second reviewer and others (soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, etc) and drizzled that over the meat mixture before rolling. Had some sweet chile sauce on the side for dipping, as well. Used iceberg lettuce (had on hand), and it was quite messy making a wrap. Will try one of the other recommended lettuces the next time. Thanks Rachel, excellent recipe!

Very very good! For the sauce I did:  1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T sriracha. I left out the water chestnuts and used ground ginger.

This was delicious! But, I prefer eating this in a whole wheat wrap with lettuce (and extra hot sauce) opposed to just eating the filling in a leaf of lettuce. I also put 2 cans of water chestnuts and julienned carrots for extra extra crunch. Mmmmm! This recipe is especially great to make ahead for a work week. I tried to make this recipe with ground turkey instead of beef and it wasn't even close to the same! I'm not going to lie, ill still eat it but I definitely won't be making it with turkey again.

This recipe is awesome! I've made it so often I've modified it and now include carrots, red cabbage and jasmine rice. I love it with chicken or steak versus the ground beef. I also recommend cutting the Hoisen sauce in half.

Great low carb recipe! I substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and add a little beef bouillon to fool the palate. I have substituted powdered ginger when I do not have pickled ginger. Too add crunch I substitute 1/4 -1/3 cup of peanuts for the water chestnuts. I don't add the chili sauce.

Dynamite! I didn't have ground beef, so used some thawed chicken breast strips, cut into pieces. I upped the ingredients a bit (a little extra chili sauce, ginger, etc.). I used the romaine lettuce wraps I found at WalMart--super convenient. I, too, added finely chopped peanuts, as had another reviewer. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Doubled this recipe for a gathering picnic in a park. Took in a warming container with the butter lettuce leaves and toppings on the side.  Everyone loved it.  I added the shredded carrots in at the end of cooking.  I used lean ground turkey. After browning the turkey, I pulsed it in a food processor to get it a little finer. Could be made ahead or in stages, like chopping or browning the day before for time and ease of preparation.  Thanks for this recipe.

I followed suggestions about additional soy sauce and rice wine vinegar.  I didn't use onion, but instead added carrots and served with bean sprouts.  Also, I used the soy granules instead of beef.  My butter lettuce was holey, so I chopped it up and served the 'meat' over the lettuce and topped with fresh, raw bean sprouts.

It was very tastey! I used ground turkey and used minced ginger instead of the pickled. I also used half of a red onion and used romaine lettuce in place of the butter. Very easy to make and the flavors are great!

My husband is Vietnamese and is very picky when it comes to me trying to do any authentic recipes he grew up on, but this!? He loved! It was requested to make a second time! So I did! The only thing I didn't add was pickled ginger, just used a little ginger paste because that's all I had! Magnificent! I had to double the recipe second time around to be sure there was plenty for left overs! I also used chili garlic sauce instead of just chili sauce, again, all I had! But it worked out great!

This was definitely a great recipe, also perfect way to use the plethora of lettuce, green onions & other veg I have growing in my garden. I made the sauce as per the original recipe but did substitute a few things based on what I had on hand - fresh ginger for pickled, & ground bison for beef. I also added maybe a half pound of ground pork to the meat, and had shredded carrots, bean sprouts and vermicelli to eat within the wraps. They turned out great and will definitely make again!

Super tasty! Followed this recipe exactly as described. I made this for a group of gals and there were no leftovers!!  Some had had lettuce wraps from famous chain restaurants and some hadn't had them at all before, everyone loved them. Had to make it again for my husband the following day!  Perfect again. Tasty and flavorful.

I've had this recipe (printed) for a couple of years and just made it. I'm sorry I waited so long because it was so good.  We used ground turkey but other than that we made the recipe as stated ( oops - we just used ginger not pickled ginger. We made our own sauce as others suggested and we wished we would have had those nice crispy noodles. Loved it and will make many times in the future. We served with fried rice. Yum!

The flavors of ginger and hoisin sauce were really strong almost overbearing for us.

I made the sauce for the reviews.  This was good the first time I made it.  Even better with it!  It added so much flavor.  I will definitely be making the sauce with it next time as well.

This spices in this recipe were perfect!  I used sambal oelek for the Asian chile pepper sauce and fresh ginger (since I didn't have any pickled on hand).

I tried this recipe and have to say it was very tasty.  If you like ginger I would recommend using fresh.  The sauce ingredients are good, but I adjusted it to my taste.  Very easy and simple, and healthy.  I like spicy, so if you do don't skimp on the hot stuff.  I used Siracha in the sauce and when it was done and in the lettuce wrap, I just drizzled lightly over the meat and ate it like a taco, instead wrapping.  This was so VERY good.  Will definitely be making again!

I have made this many times. We LOVE it! Please make it with ground turkey instead of hamburger. I made it with hamburger one time and it tasted like hamburger. When you make it with ground turkey it tastes identical to the restaurant. Oh, and I have never made it with water chestnuts because I have never had them when I make this recipe.

For our house, a little less hoisin sauce and maybe a touch more chili pepper sauce. Again for us, the hoisin made it a bit too sweet. We also used an additional bunch of green onions. Very tasty and a nice break from our usual "go-tos". I will be making this again. :D

I think it would have been a 5 star recipe if I followed it exactly and I rated it as such.  I didn't have the chili pepper sauce or the sesame oil or the pickled ginger, so I grated a large carrot, diced 2 stalks of celery, diced 1/2 medium red pepper and added 4 more minced cloves of garlic and 2 tablespoons more of the hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon more soy sauce and about 3/4 teaspoon of powdered ginger.  My version was a 5, in my opinion.  Thank you, Rachel, for the recipe!

My husband said this was one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I do make a couple of changes:  I use a whole boneless chicken breast that I rub with a touch of soy sauce and sesame oil and saute whole in a tsp or so of vegetable oil until barely cooked through.  I then chop into pea-size pieces once cool enough to handle.  I also add half a can of straw mushrooms (chopped), fresh ginger in place of the pickled, and a tablespoon or so of Mirin & a splash of tamari sauce.  I do increase the stir fry sauce amounts to account for the extra meat as the chicken weighed over a pound...  REALLY GOOD RECIPE!!!!

Made this last night...excellent.  Used ground chicken and added about 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon (each) extra soy sauce and hoisin sauce. (Ground chicken is dryer than ground beef)  I also used only about 4 oz. of the chopped water chestnuts; as that seemed like enough when I was adding it in. I don't think I would add any more than 4 oz. when making it again.  I added onion and garlic powder and some black pepper.  I chopped some cashews and grated a carrot for toppings and they made a very nice addition. I made some brown rice to go with (I was worried that my iceberg lettuce would not be a good substitute for the bibb lettuce)  We enjoyed it both as a lettuce wrap and with the rice.  I  served it with a  ginger salad, so it was an entrée and not an appetizer.  I was very impressed with the flavor and texture of this dish.  I will make it again and soon!

Great for advocare diet...Less sodium is probably required...Read the negative reviews and was a little hesistant. Turned out great! Heard it was not as good as PF Changs....I would say comparable being it was homemade....Did not use ginger and used turkey instead. Wife would have liked more spice, but I was cooking tonight and opted out. She said it was just as good without it. We will make it again.

I made this tonight for myself and my 4 kids. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Everything else I did was exactly as the recipe stated.  I may have purchased the wrong chili sauce because it was a little sweet as well as spicy.... so fortunately I had some packets of chili sauce from a local Chinese restaurant so I added 1 of those when I added the sesame oil.  It was perfect.  We really liked this a lot and the kids asked me to make it again! I will for sure...but I'll probably double the sauce next time because if I had 1 complaint it would be that it needed a bit more.

I love lettuce wraps and these are very good. I gave four stars because after making the recipe as shown above I felt the need modify the recipe.
Good recipe as is, but you may want to make additions according to your personal taste.

I had to buy a lot of these ingredients, but I'll be making this again for sure. Loved it as it is, but I also added some chopped up cooked vermicelli noodles while cooking the sauce. It didn't change the flavour, but made the meal go a little further. It was delicious and had lots of flavour.

I made this tonight using ground ELK instead of beef. It was fantastic! Probably one of the greatest things I've ever made at home. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except used fresh ginger instead of pickled, Sriracha as my asian chili sauce... and the elk, of course. I served it on butter lettuce and made the sauce suggested by other reviewers, which really made the recipe. This tasted like something we might order at our favorite thai restaurant. Amazing!!

Excellent recipe; I found what many reviewers found, that the flavor in the sauce needed a bit of a boost, so I added about 1 T of good fish sauce and it turned out wonderfully.

Amazing!  I added shredded carrots and served bean sprouts on the side.  I also served sweet chili dipping sauce.  I couldn't find pickled ginger, so I sliced up fresh ginger root and soaked it in vinegar for an hour.  Great meal!

This is easy and tasty.  **Update** Every time I make this, I get compliments, but I just can't get past a flavor that is off.  I finally realized that store bought hoisin sauce is really gross, and homemade is easy and much better tasting.  Make this with homemade hoisin sauce!!  It is a little more work for a much better flavor.

This was such an amazing recipes. I didn't have the majority of the ingredients available but it was worth spending the money on!  I didn't need to change a thing except I got red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. I couldn't tell the difference. One of my favorite recipes!

This was fantastic!  I did not have any sesame oil, but I did have fresh (frozen) ginger root, and I think that it made up the flavor difference.  I also used ground turkey, and it was lean and tasty!  I will make this a favorite!

Really good flavor if you use the pickled ginger et al. I really like using the Bibb Lettuce, though as it suggests, with ingredients, does get a little drippy. It's very tasty...and a definitely unusual "finger/hand food" for many of us simple 60 year old guys (too messy). I put it in a "Caseydilla", topped w/ some mozzarella to bind the  tortilla...did this for 98 yo Dad. Made it easier to eat and he said the flavor was really great. I used half pork and half lean ground chicken plus a dash of fish sauce. It has a little bite to the seasonings as well.

Yummy!   Served like a salad on a bed of romaine that I needed to use up.  Made my own hoisin sauce and crispy rice noodles, grated carrots. A lot of work and made a messy kitchen but everybody loved it!  Skipped pickled ginger

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and fresh chopped ginger for the pickled ginger and it was excellent. Also, I used the 'living' Boston lettuce for the first time and WOW......absolutely fresh and crisp leaves for the perfect lettuce wrap.

I loved this recipe and as usual I embellished it a tad. I added 2 TB of peanut butter and instead of putting all the ingredients in with the burger and onion I whisked it in a measuring cup and added it all at once at the end. I was out of honey so I added a TB of brown sugar. Im telling you.... we were saying "yum" on every bite. Its our new favorite. Thank you Rachel for your delicious inspiration.  All the best, Deb

I made a small change to this recipe.   I used minced ginger instead of pickled ginger because I already had the minced ginger in the fridge and pickled ginger was expensive for needing only 2 teaspoons.   The taste was fine with the regular ginger.    I couldn't find a large head of appropriate lettuce, but the medium sized Boston lettuce worked out pretty well.     Next time we are going to try with ground pork since we usually get Mu Shu Pork.

This is a great recipe for a variety of occasions, and can easily be made grain/gluten-free (we used gluten-free hoisin & raw coconut aminos for the soy sauce).  My kids loved it, and they're quite picky.  A number of tweaks have been proposed in these comments, and many seem worth trying out next time, but this is a great basis for a new regular dish that can be individualized over time.  Thanks!  Oh, P.S. - being grain-free they get devoured quickly...consider having a filling side, or make more than you think.

as is i think the dish is a little on the bland side.. the pickled ginger is a must.. added a bunch more chile pepper sauce.. used celery instead of chestnuts.. ground turkey instead of beef.. and probably added a little more soy.. the end result was fantastic.. ty for the start of a good recipe

Delicious.  I thought ground beef sounded kind of weird, so we used chicken.  We omitted the water chestnuts and added sesame seeds.  I was really disappointed I was out of ginger, but it tasted great without it.  Also, I made my own hoisin  sauce using a recipe I found online that was basically soy sauce, peanut butter, garlic, and sesame oil.  I couldn't find any of those white airy noodley things that I wanted for crunch, but it didn't matter, this was good enough on its own.  Also, I followed someone else's advice and did green onions instead of white.  I didn't cook them, just put them right on top with the carrots.  Even my five-year old ate this up.

Good by itself but would be much better to add toppings with crunch like noodles or carrot to contrast texture.

I used other reviewers suggestions on the sauce, and I substituted ground turkey for the beef.  I also add frozen edamame and chopped carrots to give it more crunch since I don't like water chesnuts.  I use Sriracha instead of chili paste and occasionally serve over brown rice if I don't have lettuce to make a wrap!

This is definitely better than PF Changs. Only thing I changed was adding a bit of chinese five spice. Delicious and easy!

This was AWESOME! It is so good that I would make it when we have guests over. It is easy, rather healthy and very flavorful. Next time, I will use ground chicken rather than ground beef.

It was a great meal. We were debating whether or not to wrap the lettuce in a rice wrapper to hold it together a little better, but overall it was pretty delicious. Not quite as good as a restaurant, but definitely good.

Not quite what I expected the 1st time. 2nd time I made it I used "seasoned" rice vinegar instead of regular and it was more like what you'd get in a restaurant.

Loved it but I made a few modifications.  I marinated the beef in some dark soy, light soy, oyster sauce and cornstarch.  After I browned the onions I tossed diced carrots and celery for extra vegetables.  Hope this helps.

I've only had lettuce wraps with chicken.  After making these, I think I will continue making them that way.  The recipe is not bad.  The sauce is great, but I think the ground beef makes it taste less Asian.

Really Good! I made exactly as directed, with the exception of adding a little extra soy sauce, found it to be very flavourful and moist! We used iceberg lettuce leaves for serving and also had some rice in the wraps, my husband absolutely loved it!

Very Good - I added quite a bit more hoisen sauce as the mixture seemed dry and lacking flavor.  I used iceberg lettuce because I couldn't find Boston Bibb, but iceberg wasn't a good choice because it didn't roll well.  I definitely will make again and just try doubling the sauce to make sure there is enough.

Fabulous Recipe!  Fixed exactly as recipe stated first time. Everyone loved it.  2nd time did not have all ingredients, used ground turkey, added broccoli cole slaw chopped, mushrooms chopped to minced. I chopped everything in food processor really cuts down on time. Soft veggies were minced and hard veggies watch to chop not mince. Thank you for the recipe.

This was so delicious! My husband asked me to make it again! I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, couldn't get the pickled ginger so I used a bit of fresh grated ginger and oops! didn't use the sesame oil.
After all of this, it was still wonderful!  The butter lettuce is soft and easy to fold with no cracking. The waterchestnuts added a nice crunch.
Next time I will buy 2 heads of butter lettuce and hopefully can find the pickled ginger. Yum, can't wait to make it again!   Charlotte

I liked this filling.  I upped the sesame oil as it needed more wetness.  My wraps completely fell apart.  I used boston bib lettuce but it was a flop (litterally).  Makes a lot of filling.

Used 1/2 TB olive oil in place of cooking oil.  Cut back on the onion a bit as 1 large onion seemed like a lot.  Had to use dried ginger as that is all I had on hand.  Left out the water chestnuts and green onion.  Used chili sauce for the Asian chile paste.  Placed in Romaine leaves and topped with a little shredded carrot.  Even with all the changes I had to make this was excellent.  We tried the PF Chang's sauce as others suggested.  Hubs like it but I thought it was just ok.  Will def make these again- so easy.

Very good!  I made them pretty much as stated but I didn't have any pickled ginger so I used regular minced ginger.  Also I didn't use the chili sauce.  Maybe next time I will make some kind of dipping sauce to go with them like other people have mentioned.  All in all it turned out well and was well received by my family!

This is by far my favorite recipe ever! I use lean ground turkey instead of beef & they are perfect every time! The sauce is the bees knees! Oh, I omit the ginger, only because our local store doesn't have it, but other than that & the meat swap, I don't change a thing! Make this one, you'll love it!

Loved it! So good and so simple! I'm fourteen and love to cook, so I made this for my family for dinner tonight and it was easy! We added two pre-made Harris Teeter sushi plates to eat with it and it was a perfect meal. This will definitely be made again.

This was fantastic!!!  I am trying to get healthier so I used ground chicken instead of beef and it was great! My teenage daughter had 3 of them. I used butter lettuce and it was pretty thin and soft. Next time I will use iceberg like PF Changs.

I made this recipe last night for a very picky eater and he loved it!  And so did I.  It was a very nice change of pace from the normal and it was so delicious and easy/quick to make.

Every once in a while I print off recipes...but a lot of the time I never use them.  I made this recipe tonight and it was sooooo good!  Even my 12-year-old loved it.  The pickled ginger was a little expensive, but since I love the recipe, I suppose I'll end up using it all.  I think I even like it better than our favorite chinese restaurant (could be because I made it myself and was so proud of it).  I even made some vegetarian for my daughter with Boca and she liked it.  You won't be sorry.

Wonderful!  I used ground turkey (I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef) and I had to use ground ginger because it was what I had on hand.  Other than these two minor tweaks, I followed the recipe as listed.  My husband and I loved it!  I will make this again and again.

Fabulous!  I tried to make it even healthier by subbing the ground beef with a combo of ground turkey and some kind of soy crumble product resembling ground sausage.  Super tasty!

I used ground turkey and only about a quarter of the called for sesame seed oil as we are not huge fans but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I liked them a lot, my MR said he would have preferred with beef.  Not something I will make weekly but definitely something I will make again.

Oh my!!  These are wonderful!!!  I did as others suggested...2 Tbsp rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp chile sauce (adds a good kick).  Also, didn't have pickled ginger so used fresh ginger.  Also added some shredded carrots.  We will be having these again soon!

John and I really loved this recipe.  I made a few changes to it (taking out some stuff we didn't care for and substituting turkey for beef and low fat or low sodium options for health purposes) and it was still "a keeper," according to him.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a meal they can easily custom to their own desires and eat without any regrets.  I also made a sweet maple dill carrot recipe to go alongside it as a side dish and we were both full and happy.

This is a fabulous recipe! I used to use PF Changs copy cat recipe until I found this one. Love this one. I also serve it with a side of 1/2 cup sesame oil mixed with teriaki sauce topped with sesame seeds for diping.

I made this for a work potluck and it came out great.  I used turkey meat (1.5lbs) and doubled the sauce since the meat is usually a little dry.  I also doubled the dipping sauce.
Canned water chestnuts aren't crunchy so I used Jicama instead.  This fit well in the Boston Bibb leaves and my coworkers loved it!

We've tried this a few times now and love it...and I'm a pretty picky eater. It's much better if you use ground pork and add a little sriracha sauce for heat.

I smash up peanuts in place of the water chestnuts, add finely chopped carrots to get another vegetable into the mix, and I omit the sesame oil as I don't care for it. I keep meaning to try it with fresh cilantro but haven't yet.

These were fantastic.  I didn't have water chestnuts so I used canned palm hearts instead and they still tasted great.  Tried it with pork and water chestnuts too.  Will try it next with ground chicken.  I think the hoisin sauce does the trick.  Very versatile recipe.  I seem to prefer wrapping it in iceberg lettuce.  It gives it more crunch.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Rachel.

Delicious! I've never used Hoisin sauce before, but I'm glad I did! The flavor was awesome. I also added some smashed up peanuts, which was a nice touch. New favorite for my carb-free menu!

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I did not put in the Asian chili pepper sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. BTW: I learned that pickled ginger and sushi ginger are the same thing. I was able to find it at my local grocery store.

Delicious and simple. Love that you can add your own touches - we put shredded carrots and red peppers in the wraps and it added more crunch. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  Fast and easy...hubby loved it!  He's not too crazy about water chestnuts so I substituted with shredded carrots.  I didn't have pickled ginger so used 1 - 11/2 tsp of ground ginger.  Omitted the chili sauce and used a little more soy sauce (aloha).  Turned out soooo yummy!  Hoisin sauce can be a tad sweet so you can adjust to taste.  Love it!

These got rave reviews and now I understand why! They are phenomenal! I didn't have pickled ginger so I used fresh and that is the only thing I did different. I used 93/7 ground beef and used low sodium where I could. Used Boston Lettuce which were the perfect little cups for this divine meal. Yummy! I can't wait to make these again.

What a nice change of pace for dinner! I followed the recipe exactly but made with ground turkey since we don't eat beef.  I also made some jasmine rice and topped the lettuce cups with rice, meat mixture and shredded carrots.  I also followed one review and made the dipping sauce to accomodate the wraps.  So, so good! Can't wait for leftovers tonight! I'll be making this again for sure!

Great recipe. Perfect for veggie crumbles. Used tamari instead of soy sauce. Topped with some shredded carrots and cilantro. I didn't find that it needed any dipping sauce. Really yummy! Easy and fun.

Excellent recipe - made with extra lean ground turkey instead of beef. You must at least double the sauce to make it truly great.

Yum! Will make again. I moved from the city to the country so it's been years since I had PF Chang (boohoo), but I thought this was pretty tasty (although I couldn't get pickled ginger-that's an 1.5 hr drive, so I tried substituting w/ 1 tsp fresh ginger).

We've made this a few times and it's a hit with us, guests, and our kids (6.5 and 3). We add red and orange peppers, sometimes mushrooms, and use regular ginger instead of pickled.

Very easy to make and delicious.

Delicious and fresh-tasting - perfect for a hot summer day.  Next time I will add a little more garlic and hot sauce, to counter some of the sweetness, which was too much for my meat and potatoes hubby.  I served these with the Ginger Cabbage Salad on this site.  Perfect!

Very good.  I did not brown the ground beef in oil, as it already produces plenty of grease.   I did need to add a little bit to cook the onions & garlic.

I tried making these because my husband is addicted to the restaurants down the street. They use chicken. So this gets three stars because he says beef isn't as good. I will try this again with chicken, and I will also add the chili pepper sauce. Our kid wasn't into it either, so it can be spicy next time.
The only thing I didn't use from recipe was the ginger. I used fresh grated ginger instead.
Thanks. This is a keeper

YUM!  I loved these wraps.  I used ground chicken and fresh ginger because that is what I had on hand.  I omitted the water chestnuts; didnt' have any.  Will make again soon.  Thanks!

I would give this 5 stars, except I had to double the sauce to make this suit our tastes.  Once you double that, it's perfect!

Delicious!  This is a definite keeper that will be made again in our house.  I used ground chicken and fresh ginger instead of pickled (just about 1/2 tsp).  It was so good.  No leftovers here and my boys do not eat lettuce normally.

This is delicious.  We couldn't find the right lettuce, but what we found was good.  You just have to get the largest leaf lettuce you can find.  We will cook this again!

Now that I have the specialty ingredients for this dish, I will be making it regularly! I made it with lean ground turkey and my husband couldn't even tell because the hoisin sauce makes it look like beef! Even omitting the onion and using onion powder and using powdered ginger instead of pickled didn't diminish the tastiness of this recipe. Yum!

I made this using chicken breasts that I ground. This was delicious! As good as any "rolling lettuce chicken" dish I have had in Chinese restaurants! I followed the directions as written, and added 2 tbls sriracha sauce to the stir fry. When serving, my husband and I used both hoisin and sriracha as a condiment, YUM!

Great recipe! Easy to make too. I didn't have pickled ginger, and just used powdered, but I thought it still tasted great! Next time I think I'll double the recipe and freeze some. Could use this recipe for a main dish or appetizer. Yummy!

Fantastic! I substituted shredded chicken for the ground beef and reserved the green part of the scallions to add as garnish. An instant favorite.

Two thumbs up from my picky kids & they liked it so much they took it to lunch the following day!  I used a half lb. ground turkey and half lb. ground pork mix, which kept the meat moist & flavorful.  I also minced fresh ginger and let it cook with the onions, and used low sodium Asian sauces.  Very easy to prepare & ready in a flash, this recipe will definetely go into our weeknight rotation.

These were delicious!  I made them for my 15 year old and his friends and they kept saying over and over again how good they were.  I used fresh ginger instead of pickled and omitted the onions.  I also doubled the recipe to make sure we had enough. I will definitely be making them again.

I never had a lettuce wrap so I have no comparison point but the meat mixture was bland tom me. I didnt use chili sauce bc I thought it would make it too spicy Not bad but not great. I was hoping it would be a little more saucy but it was a little dry. Not sure if I woud try it again

Yummy dish!  I substituted ground chicken for the beef and added some extra soy sauce.  Also used fresh ginger instead of pickled.  It was a hit!  I served it with Thai Cucumber salad as a side and it worked out to be the perfect compliment, we used it as a topper on the wraps.

This is so good!  I use chicken instead of beef...and it really closely resembles the lettuce wraps at one of the popular asian restaurants out there!  I use fresh ginger and also use 2T of the chile pepper sauce.  I skip the water chestnuts all together.   I've made this 4 times now, and it is a hit everytime.  I serve mine with spring rolls and fortune cookies.  My kids love it!

I changed the recipe a little, so I'm only giving it 4 stars.  It was very good and both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I could not find bibb or Boston lettuce and frankly, head lettuce just doesn't work.  It tore something awful, so that part didn't really work out.  We ended up serving the mixture over Udon noodles that I made.  I used ground chicken, added some seasoning salt (along with the other seasonings the recipe called for) and added shredded carrots, too.  I think it made a nice version, and cheaper one, too, of Noodles and Company.  I will make this again, and next time will add snow peas to the mix.

I love lettuce wraps but tried to make it healthier, so I used ground turkey, none of the oils, sautéd the onions peppers and garlic in the little fat from the turkey,put a few shakes of worchester,soy,hoisin sauce and chile pepper sauce. Put a spoonful on top of a bed of baby spinach and topped w shaved carrots and bean sprouts. So good!!

this turned out great! I changed a few things though. I used fresh ginger instead of pickled, I made the sauce that other reviewers suggested.  I also omitted water chestnuts and used shredded carrots, bean sprouts and chopped cilantro to top it off.  They were incredible.  I will definitely make these again.

Excellent light meal. We use whatever kind of lettuce we have on hand. Much less filling than tortilla wraps without giving up flavor.

My brother and I made these for a group of about 60 young girls for a Sweet Sixteen birthday party. They were a BIG hit. All the girls loved them. We have been asked to make them again for an appetizer-type dinner coming up soon. Can't wait!

Made this tonight and it was the bomb. Whole family liked it. Kicked in a little Sriracha chili sauce for some good spice and left out the ginger.. Will make it again next week. This is a good appetizer or dinner.

I had some sweet chili sauce so I added to it and it turned out very yummy. It reminded me of an Asian version of American BBQ cups.

Delicious! Used turkey instead of beef to make healthier. Didn't have rice wine vinegar; used cider vinegar. Also added 1/2 c of diced red pepper. Will definitely make again!

Pretty yummy!  I had to modify the recipe a bit as we did not have hoisin sauce or chile pepper sauce, but it worked out ok.  I looked up the ingredients in hoisin and used a little salt, extra garlic, a teaspoon of sugar and red pepper flakes.  I am looking forward to making this recipe with all the ingredients!!

Sooooo good. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. I didn't have some of the ingredients like the ginger but I made due and it was so good. I froze the rest of the filling and it kept well.

Our grocery store was out of ground chicken so I used lean ground beef instead and it still tasted great.  The bibb lettuce was a bit too flimsy to hold much so I think I will try iceberg next time.  Both my husband and I loved it!

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting the ground beef for the ground chicken breast.  It turned out really well and we all loved it, even the kids.  Based on my experience with Asian cooking/food, I think it would be best to add sesame oil at the end when you turn the heat off or you lose the fragrance/flavor of the sesame oil.  And you only need 1 teaspoon and that would cut the calorie down as well.

I made this for my husband to bring to his office for lunch.  He was very pleased and said it was just as good as the Asian restaurants we go to.  I did make the side sauce that a reviewer had mentioned.  It gave it a nice extra flavor.  I added fresh shredded carrots on top as a garnish for color.

Great recipe! we made a healthier version by using Ground Turkey instead of Beef and we needed to add a little salt - but otherwise its great. Perfect blend of Hot & Sweet. Will definitely make these again!

We made this with ground turkey and it was great! A lot of times when you make chinese food at home it looks better than it tastes...this was the exception to the rule.

More like three and a half stars.  I made the sauce recommended by other readers.  I did not have chili paste, so that could have been the problem.  I did use half pork and half soy crumbles, with water chestnuts, onion and green onion.  So minus the sauce, we pretty much just ate the meat in lettuce.  Still good but not the point of this recipe.

the second time i made this i quadrupled the pickled ginger, along with adding fresh AND powdered ginger. i felt the flavor got lost in the myriad the first time. i also threw in half a red bell pepper and a zucchini, diced, with the onions in the beginning. this added a new aspect of flavor and made the dish more filling. it's great for parties, set out the bowl of meat with a bowl of grated carrots and another of bean sprouts, spread the fan of lettuce leaves around and let everybody build their own while you listen to the compliments :)

I used fresh ginger instead of pickled, a red onion instead white, and about a tablespoon of Sri Racha for heat. AMAZING! I put this over fresh spinach and white rice instead of in the wraps and I've been kicking around the idea of putting it into rice paper wrappers!

Me and my BF loooved these. He was the one who said that the lettuce wraps at PF Changs are awesome so we I saw the reivews for this I saved it- I've never had lettuce wraps before but I am sure glad I did ;) I used icebrug lettuce because I couldn't find the suggested kinds but I could find all the other ingredients. I didnt have the wine vingar so I used white wine.  I used Asian Helper Chicken Fried Rice- with out the chicken for a side, theses make a great dinner!

Found this recipe when looking for something to do with ground beef that was not a Tex-Mex or meatball/loaf dish.  I didn't follow this recipe too closely, but did use it as a guideline with things that I had on hand.

Make this quite often, it's delicious. The sesame oil makes it! There's no reason to cook the meat and onion in separate steps, though. Cook the meat ( I use ground turkey) onion and garlic; drain and add the rest of the ingredients. Easy and fast.

Excellent!  Made these last night for dinner.  It is quick and easy to make and has lots of flavor.  We added a couple teaspoons of Siracha for some heat.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

These were really good! I'm glad I decided to make them inside of going to a restuarant. I doubled all the sauces like someone suggested, on the review since, I used turkey.

Never had Asian lettuce wraps until I ate at PF Changs. Tried this recipe and now I dont have to go to PF Changs. Made it for my family for the 1st time. They loved it.

This is better than I could've imagined!! Has all the Asian flavors I was looking for.  The only thing I changed was using less only 1/3 of an onion and ground turkey as opposed to the beef.  Have made it for a number of people and they don't want the meal to end!

I only made a few changes and the wraps were amazing! Instead of ground beef, I used ground chicken and instead of 2 tsp minced pickled ginger, I used 2 tsp fresh minced ginger. I served it with two sauces, peanut sauce and the sauce listed below in the other reviews. My significant other, who used to work at PF Changs, said it tasted better than their wraps. We will definitely keep this recipe!

Used venison, but you could use anything; ground chicken, turkey, pork, beef, or tofu based. Really yummy, doesn't work so well for wrapping with iceburg lettuce, you definately want Bibb or butter lettuce. Iceberg is too crisp, but wow, the filling is so tasty you won't care if you have to eat it with a fork.

This was a quick and healthy meal.  The meat was seasoned well and it was fun (although a little messy) to eat.  The meat had a fair amount of sauce (which could be my fault because I don't like to measure things), but we just spooned it on to our lettuce wrap and ate away.  Very tasty!

I used ground pork and did not include the pickled ginger or water chestnuts.  I added a handful of bean sprouts for more crunch.  The flavor was absolutely delicious.  This is a quick and inexpensive dish!

Really tasty and easy to make!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of ground beef, as I've had lettuce wraps made with chicken at restaurants and enjoyed them.  I've made the recipe twice now, and it's been a big hit both times.  Enjoy!

This was very good!  I thought the amount of hoisin was too much, so next time I will cut that in half.  I added an add'l 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce and another 1 tsp sesame oil and may add a little brown sugar next time because my husband didn't think they were as sweet as the restaurant lettuce wraps, which he likes.  Otherwise a very good base recipe with some minor tweaking.

Extremely good!  Used ground chicken instead of beef.  Added some rice noodles & carrots for extra crunch and next time will add mushrooms too.  Made lettuce wrap sauce as previously suggested by other reviewers (2T rice vinegar, 2T soy sauce, 1 T chili paste & 1t sesame oil).  Served with Miso soup recipe from here as well.  Mmmmm!

Oh My Goodness!  What a nice treat to be able to have restaurant tasting Asian food in my own home!!!!  My husband wanted to make these for me with some store bought Miso soup.  The only thing he did different was: minced a boneless/skinless chicken breast into very small pieces and saute in oil/sesame oil in the wok.  Also, he used fresh ginger rather than the pickled.  Lastly, he did use the chili sauce.  I have to say, that was the best part of it.  It gives the sweet heat (these are not too spicy, don't worry) that really takes these wraps over the edge!  I topped mine with the crunchy rice noodles...YYYYUUUUMMMMYYY!!!

I am so happy to have found this recipe!  I tried potstickers a couple months back and they were so labor intensive I haven't made them since.  This is SIMPLE!  I used ground white turkey.  I also used onion powder rather than chopped onion (no green onions either) and ginger powder for the pickled ginger.  Added some drops of sirachi.    Iceberg doesn't work that great but its all my store had.  Turned out so flavorful - I have a feeling this will be a regular in our house!

Great recipe.  I used lentils instead of meat because I didn't have ground meat at home.  I used oyster sauce instead of hoisin sauce, and it turns out too salty.  Next time, I will use hoisin sauce or oyster sauce with less soy sauce and adding some suger.

Very good ~ I did follow redrobyn's suggestions & also did not have the sesame oil which I know would have made it better.  Will make again!

These were great!  I used ground chicken instead of beef and powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I also didn't have any chili sauce.  I took these to a party and they were a huge hit!  Even the skeptical loved them.

Holy deliciousness!  I used ground chicken and accidentally added a little too much chili pepper sauce, but they were still awesome.  Next time I will add some finely chopped mushrooms for added texture, but this recipe is awesome as is.  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous.  I tested out the recipe on my husband last night- it's now going on the menu for our party.  I made it as written except used cooking spray instead of oil; and used EXtra lean beef.   I'm thinking about eating the leftovers for breakfast right now.....

This recipe was amazing!  It tasted like the lettuce wraps you get at PF Changs.  Instead of ground beef we ground up boca burgers for a healthier meal.  We couldn't notice much difference.

I've tried this with both ground turkey and ground beef. I prefer the beef, although the turkey wasn't bad.  There is a lot of chopping and preparing so if you have a friend to help you, it goes really fast and is a lot more fun.

Wow! My family gobbled these down so quickly I was lucky to get a couple wraps myself. We used bbq sauce since we did not have hoisin, and regular ginger instead of pickled. Even our Chinese exchange student gave it 5 stars.

Oh my, this was just like restaurant versions! I did have to make a few changes. I did the sauce instructions + another half. The sauce wasn't enough otherwise.  I added extra garlic in the form of one clove right after the recipe was fully cooked - I really like garlic flavor, and asian chili pepper sauce is a must for authentic restaurant taste. I think I did about a half tablespoon? It wasn't too spicy. So add more or less to your tastes.  I also used ground chicken. Perfect. I'd love to try this with shrimp, too.

Like this a lot.  I thought I had sesame oil but did not so I think it would be better if I had done it right.  The sauce was thick.  It was a great new way to use ground beef!

Even my 5 and 2 year old like this! I leave out the pickled ginger, double the sauce, and add shredded carrot and zucchini. Sometimes I use ground turkey breast. It's a huge hit in our house. We love it!

This was AMAZING! Instead of ground beef I used ground chicken and it was SO GOOD!  I also used regular iceberg lettuce instead of Bib.  I was cooking many things with this and cooked it a bit too long so it wasn't as 'saucy'...next time I will cook it a minute or two less. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just a busy cook! My entire family LOVED this and asked for seconds. This is also tasty served over rice.

I topped the wraps with a squeeze of lime, shredded carrots and chopped roasted peanuts, and used fresh ginger instead of pickled. Very good dinner, and easy.  This recipe would be good with pork or chicken, too.

Very tasty dish!  I used Romaine lettuce leaves which were a little awkward for wrapping and i missed the pickled ginger.  Also, I didn't have any rice wine vinegar so I just used some white vinegar instead.  It probably wasn't excatly as the recipe but tasted super.  The chili sauce added a nice zing

Very good! This recipe just like what I've had in restaurants. The only things I will make sure to do next time is watch the chili sauce. I used 1 tbsp Sriracha chili sauce for half a recipe and I was on fire. I love hot, but I'll start with a tsp next time and go from there. Also, buy the right lettuce. I stuck with iceberg since I had it on hand and it was hard to keep together, let alone get a whole leaf peeled off. While assembling, I spread a bit of hoisin on the lettuce (plum sauce would work too), then the meat mix (used veggie crumbles), and topped it off with angel hair noodles and julienned carrots. I will definitely make this again.

I thought these were a wonderful appetizer.  I used bibb lettuce & that was the perfect size.  I ended up making the recipe a day ahead & only had to warm it up for my guests.  Yum!

This was GREAT!  My picky 9 year old that doesn't eat meat and no salads actually had two lettuce leaves and even said if there were any left overs he was eating them the next day. I added a bit more of hoisin sauce and sesame oil for more taste. I served them with crispy noodles and made a dipping sause with the same ingredients along with a bit sugar.  I will be making this more often for sure and I think next time I'm trying it with ground turkey.

The recipe was a huge hit with friends that we had over for dinner and used turkey instead of ground beef.  This is a recipe that my husband and I make on a regular basis now, so easy and so tasty!!!

This is a keeper! Simple, quick and delicious. Made mine with pork, omitted the ginger and added 2 more tbsp of rice vinegar to make it more mouthwatering. Will make again!

Very good recipe.  My boyfriend made this last week and they were great.  We did not have a head of lettuce on-hand so he used green cabbage instead, which was a little more difficult to work with, but still tasty!  :)

I make this all the time using ground chicken and iceberg lettuce. I also add more hoisin, about 1/2 c. Sometimes I make it without the water chestnuts and it's just as good. Tastes exactly like PF Chang's!

We really liked these wraps!  I used veggie *meat* instead of ground beef and it was great. My son had no idea he was eating a vegetarian meal.  I also added 1 tsp. Asian chile sauce and that gave it just the right amount of heat for us.

I thought they were quite good. I liked the fact that they were wrapped in lettuce, it's a nice healthy alternative to having tortillas.

Fabulous!  My 7 yr old loved them.  I added mushrooms, shredded cabbage and carrots just because I had them on hand.  It's a great way to sneak in veggies.  This was so easy and quick to make.

Used ground turkey and fresh ginger. Made a dipping sauce to go with it.  Sprinkled ramen noodles and peanuts for an extra crunch!

Made this after having it at a very popular asian restaurant... couldn't tell the difference. One thing I changed was instead of ground beef I substituted half ground beef and half ground pork which I am told is a little more traditional in this dish.

This recipe is very close to what I was looking for. I added one Thai chili with the garlic and fresh cilantro and mint at the end with the green onion. As I prepare it the recipe gets 5 stars. Yummy!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I followed it exactly and was pleasantly surprised.  I was skeptical about the ground beef, but don't like to modify a recipe before I try it the way it is written.  My only question is the type of chili sauce they used.  Many reviewers mentioned the final product being sweet.  I noticed several different types of chili sauce at the store and went with the more traditional version, which is not sweet.  Since I used a spicier type chili sauce, mine was pretty hot.  I will half the amount next time so that my son can eat it too.  Mine was definitely too spicy for his taste, but I loved it.

My boyfriend found this recipe and made it for me, and it was sooo good! Much much better than restaurant food! Then we made me together tonight and it is one of my fav's for sure! I used fresh ginger and less sesame oil. The water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch. Definitely recommended!

I omitted the green onions and pickled ginger because I didn't have any and I doubled the sauce. They were excellent! Even my husband who scoffed at the idea of having lettuce wraps for dinner loved them.

Made a huge vat of this for a Mothers Day celebration.  LOOOOOVED IT.  Was very easy to do, and was well received.  My Mom has gluten allergies, so it was great to bring something that didn't have to go on a bun.  Did adjust some things because of kids at party, less onion, green onion and hot chili paste.  Kids even ate it that way.  Kept the meat filling in a crock pot, and people kept hitting it all day.  My new favorite taker to a party!  I also used a mixture of ground chicken, pork and beef, and really liked the texture.  Thank you for this recipe! :-)

I took Pima's advice from a few years ago and made the two dipping side sauces. First, the one a lot of people have already posted - 2Tbs Soy, 2Tbs Rice Wine Vinegar, 1Tbs Chile Sauce and 1tsp sesame oil. The Second, my favorite,  1/4 cup Plum sauce, 1Tbs O.J., 1/2tsp cornstarch and 1tsp Teryiaki sauce- put all 4 ingredients into sauce pan and bring to a boil for one minute. These are always a hit whenever I serve them, I prefer to use fresh ginger and ground chicken.

Love these with ground pork instead of ground beef, as suggested by other reviewers.  I may also try them with ground chicken sometime as well, since that is what is often used at the popular Chinese chains.

These were really good! I didn't have lettuce, so I used cabbage leaves. A bit tough, but still really good. Slightly sweet, but has a tiny kick due to the chili sauce. Very filling, too. I loved the tiny pieces of pickled ginger - Added a unique crunch. And its not like I have many excuses to use pickled ginger other than sushi. This is a keeper :)

I have to say we have ordered this dish for years as I never thought to look for a recipe on line. This dish is quick and easy which works in my household. My kids loved this dish (my kids never eat ground beef!!). It is now a family favorite.

This recipes was very good and easy to make. My grocery store didn't have boston bibb lettuce but romaine worked just as well and it was very crunchy.

Love this! I have tried it with beef and turkey and I honestly like it better with turkey. The sauce is excellent!

This was really really good.  And it couldn't be easier to prepare.  I used romaine lettuce leaves, and that worked great.

This recipe was very good, but I had one small problem.  I could not find Bibb or Butter lettuce at any of the stores in our area and so I bought Leaf Lettuce instead.  The Leaf Lettuce did not work at all.  How dissappointing. The meat had a very good flavor though and my daughters and I thought we might try it in some egg rolls.

This is excellent.I've made it exactly as presented and I've made it with some changes. I've used fresh ginger and even ground ginger when it was all I had on hand. I have added celery and mushrooms and cabbage. I mixed in brown rice one time when I needed to double the recipe and didn't have more meat. I have used chicken and soy in place of the beef. Even my very picky, health conscious(spelling?) brother-in-law loved it! It is one of out staples now.

Had a surprise celebration this weekend for my wife, who totally Loves PF's chicken wraps. I took a reviewer's advise, doubling up on the liquid (minus the sesame oil) and this plate Rocked! Totally recommend. But you will need a spicy sauce to compliment the plate. :0)

DH says these taste 10x better than the chinese restaurant.  Very delicious!!  I did use ground chicken and topped with chopped nuts and the sauce recommended by another reviewer.  I did not use pickled ginger and did not miss it.  I don't know how much different this would have tasted with it though.  This dish should be doubled for a main dish or if you want left overs.

Oh my gosh!!!  This is amazing!  I had friends over for a casual dinner and made wraps from a PF Changs recipe with chicken, and the wraps with hamburger from this recipe.  I thought for sure the PF Changs chicken would be the one to go first. NO!  I actually had left over of the chicken and not one drop left of the hamburger!  I did make the PF special sauce to use on both recipes. It felt like a lot of preparation, but so worth it!

I'd had lettuce wraps at a Chinese restaurant the day before, and so was inspired to make my own.  Maybe that's why I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 - they weren't quite as good as the ones I'd just had.  But overall, very tasty and not too complicated to make.  I substituted ground chicken for the beef, bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts, and used real ginger root, peeled and cut into slivers.  These were flavorful if a bit messy to eat, and just as good - if not better - the next day.

This recipe was awesome.  I added some sugar(2tsp)and dijion mustard to the dressing someone suggests and added some rice noodles(La Choy)for crunch, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could give these 4.5 stars!! I followed the recipe exactly, only subbing the ground beef for ground chicken and the pickled ginger for 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger. I also used about 2 tbsp. of Sriracha chili sauce. Served with crunchy rice noodles and shredded carrots. Turned out great and came together very quickly! Excellent week night meal. *UPDATE* Since these can be quite messy, I've started turning them into salads. Lay down a bed of torn lettuce leaves, pile on the meat mixture and top with shredded carrots, cucumber and chopped peanuts. Much easier!

Awesome, my husband loves this recipe.  I use ground turkey and ground ginger but other than that I follow the recipe.  We have it frequently just served over a bed of lettuce more like a salad.

I really enjoyed these wraps. They are fresh and hearty and have a nice sweet flavor. I served them at a party and they were eaten up in a jiffy! I will make these again and again. 
(I made these with both butter lettuce and romaine lettuce, and if it's in your budget spring for the butter lettuce, it makes such a difference!)

I am giving these a four only because I have eaten these at a restaurant before and these will probably take much experimenting before mine taste as good as those (if I can EVER match the restaurant ones). However, my family loves these and we have made them several times. My husband has never had the restaurant version, and so he has no comparison. He requested these again after I had made them the first time. He took leftovers to work for lunch and kept talking about them again the second day when he came home from work. Can't wait until I find the exact taste from the restaurant. I will share if I do. Also, I have made these with both ground beef and the second and third time with ground pork because that is what I had on hand. Both ways were equally good to us. UPDATE: Just made these again (for like the 50th time or something like that), and these were the best ones I have ever made. Only thing I know I did different was to add a can of sprouts just because I had them and thought I would try it. Also, made the vegetarian version for my daughter using shrimp. They both tasted awesome. Used ground turkey in our non-veg version. Not sure if it was the sweet chili sauce or a different Hoison sauce brand. I did also add one drop of my ginger essential oil! They smelled awesome after the drop of oil too! (Caution: You have to be careful, you cannot just use any old essential oil! Some have harmful fillers. It has to be one that specifically lists the supplement facts.)

I've made this twice.  I'd recommend giving the meat ample time to mix with all the flavors, and not letting the beef form into large chunks.  Smaller chunks absorb all the flavors better.  
My husband said that he normally isn't a huge fan of PF Chang's lettuce wraps (crazy-huh)--but he said these were wonderful/better than PF Changs.

This dish comes together fast and hits the spot if you are looking for a change of pace during the week. I use a pound of ground pork, omit the vegetable oil, forget the ginger and use sweet red chili sauce to bring the flavors together.

We all liked this especially using the oriental dipping sauce. I did not add the pickled ginger (price) or the water chestnuts (don't care for those) even so this was a nice tasty change.

Very messy/drippy, but we didn't care because it tastes SO good!
Only thing about this recipe is I couldn't figure out when to combine the meat with other ingredients.  Minor really, I stirred it in during the last step, just after the onions wilt...
It probably tastes great regardless of what you do.

This recipe was awesome!  I had a hard time locating some of the items at the store the first time I made this, but it was well worth the hunt.  I never could find dark sesame oil, so I substituted a sesame garlic sauce and it still tasted great.  I also used Morning Star Meatless Crumbles instead of beef, and no one would have ever known the difference.  Thank you for the recipe!  It has become a staple in our house.  :)

Very Good!!! I was looking for something similar to the Pei Wei's Lettuce Wrap recipe- - and this was it.  I did't have the hoisin sauce, so I found a recipe to make it - luckily I had all the ingredients.  I think the hoisin sauce is a big part in this recipe.  I will be making these Lettuce Wraps Alot!!!!

Made this almost as written but with ground turkey. Left out the chile paste and the cooking oil (didn't see a reason for it, or maybe turkey just doesn't need it). I just put it over a bunch of lettuce like a salad and it was good. I think next time I'll use more ginger, but that's because I really love ginger.

These turned out great, but with a little tweaking, but it was a great place to start.  Mine needed a little more sauce (I added more hoisin and soy sauce), I used pork instead and added julienned carrots.  I sure loved eating the leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband and I went to PF Changs for the first time and tried lettuce wraps. After that I had to find a recipe. These are just as good as PF Changs! I did leave out the pepper sauce and I could not find pickled ginger. However, they were still awesome! This recipe is a keeper!

This was good, but not really as exotic as I expected....more like an asian taco. I think maybe better quality ingredients would have helped (my hoisin sauce wasn't great).  Maybe increasing the flavor-adding ingredients would help.  Make sure you have large, sturdy lettuce.  Mine was on the smaller side and split easily.  My family liked it, and I would make it again.

Very tasty indeed! and very easy to adapt! Changes made (because of what I had/or not on hand) were to use ground pork, ground ginger, omit water chestnuts, omit hoisin, add chopped mushroom, add beansprouts, and red pepper.  Also, I didn't set the meat aside, rather added sauce and veggies to it while cooking - just a little easier!

I altered this a bit. I used onion powder instead of onion (husband doesn't like the texture) and a little ground ginger instead of pickled. I left out the chili pepper sauce, water chestnuts, and green onions, but I tossed in some minced carrot. Also we used Romaine instead of Bibb. My family loved it, and thought it tasted alot like a sweet bbq.  It was pretty good, and everyone loved eating "lettuce tacos."

Didn't have the lettuce for the wrapper . . . so stuffed and pinched won ton wrappers instead  . . . boiled them the first time I tried them, and fried them the second . . . great stuffing mix no matter how it's wrapped.

Both my husband and I thought these turned out great! I would have given this 5 stars, except that I tweaked the recipe bit... 1) I used ground pork, 2) I didn't have Hoisin sauce, so I used Oyster sauce, 3) I used minced fresh ginger rather than pickled ginger, 4) I added 1/2 tsp white pepper, and 5) I chopped up a few sprigs of fresh cilantro and added it at the end of cooking.  The lettuce wraps were DELICIOUS!  Although there are only two of us, there were no leftovers from this recipe!

These were ok. I liked them, but I'm having a hard time convincing myself and my boyfriend that we need to eat the leftovers. I used Romaine lettuce as a lettuce boat. I also sprinkled some chow mein noodles on top which made it taste pretty good. Overall, its a good recipe, just wasn't my favorite. And being served like it is, we were both SOOO hungry about an hour later. These are for sure not filling as is. Rice or something is needed either in the filling or on the side.

Yum.  No other word to describe these tasty wraps.  I made with ground pork and it had such authentic taste.  I served this recipe to me and my 3 sisters for a "sisters day out" and it was well received and could have served us twice over.  This most certainly could even be a meal in-and-of-itself.  Thank you for sharing!

This was great! I used it for Cook Club and everybody loved it.  I couldn't find the minced pickled ginger at the grocery store so I sub'd 'crystallized ginger'. I also omitted Asian chile pepper sauce - couldn't find that either. Still great. I had to use iceberg lettuce - and that was ok.

Very very tasty.  I was told that I added too much chili sauce but they kept coming back for seconds anyway !!  Since it was so many ingredients that I don't normally use I made a double batch so that we will have leftovers for lunch.  Great Recipe, why bother going to P.F. Changs when you have this.

Really tasty and healthy! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cooked and finely diced. I had to omit the water chestnuts, since I didn't have any on hand and used a little shredded cabbage instead. Made more dipping sauce, added dried red pepper flakes to the chicken mix for some kick and used Romaine lettuce leaves. They are stronger and hold up much better then bibb or butter lettuce. Pretty comparable to PF's!

This recipe was great.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the veggie soy meat substitute.  Very nice.  Personally I thought that one large onion was a bit much in combined with the green onions.  If you totally love onions leave it as is, otherwise add about half an onion or so because I found the onions to be slightly overwhelming.  Good dish nonetheless.

Pretty good--I used pork instead of beef and I may try chicken next time.  It really depends on the Hoisen sauce, though.  I didn't really like the brand I got the first time, better the second.

This was absolutely wonderful. I used ground pork but kept true to the rest of the recipe. My 2 year old couldn't get enough of it and loved making "burritos" w/ the lettuce. We will definitely have it again!

I used ground turkey, fresh ginger, carrots, and peanuts.  I didn't have sesame oil, and it was excellent w/o it.  I can't wait to make this again!  I also liked the previous reviewers receipe for a dipping sauce - a must!

Great recipe.  I added a few more ingredients, and subtracted others (added: cilantro, lime, mushrooms, fresh ginger, dried basil, and La Choy rice noodels).  I also used ground turkey instead of beef or chicken to make it healthier.  I didn't have the fish oil, but used Sesame Oil instead.  I can't wait until my family taste it and gives me their opinion(s).  This one will stay on my menu.

Ten stars from my family and I. I used extra lean ground chicken breast instead of the beef for a healthier low fat wrap. I didnt have any ginger on hand, but will add next time. I also added shredded carrot and very thin sliced red peppers to the mix. Used iceberg lettuce and had no problems, might try bibb lettuce,too. So very flavorful and delicious. We all scarfed them up watching the super bowl last night. Will make again soon!

The recipe is Excellent. I used 1 tsp of ground ginger instead of pickled ginger. I also fried some bean threads and added instead of the water chestnuts. The taste is very very close to PF Changs.

This is a very good recipe.  My husband loved it.  Next time I wouldn't put as much hoisin sauce and I'd add a teaspoon of asian chili sauce.  I would also increase the amount of green onions.

Lot of prep- do not use too much ginger or chile paste as it will be too hot.  Use iceburg lettuce

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and felt that the meat was not dry, but I think that a little sauce on top of the meat would have been a nice extra.  I served it with white rice that we also put that into the lettuce.  Very Yummy!  Will definitely make this again.

This is indeed an easy prep meal - I used fresh (versus pickled) ginger, and a few dashes of tabasco sauce instead of the chile pepper sauce. Made enough for 6 with the size leaf I had. I'll make again.

I wanted to follow this recipe exactly, even though it meant buying a lot of the ingredients and we LOVED it. The flavor of the meat was outstanding and this recipe is a welcome change from the ordinary. I used Bibb lettuce leaves and they held up very well as a wrap. I didn't have enough lettuce leaves, but no matter, we ate the meat with a fork, it was so good!

This was a great recipe!  I read the reviews and used ground pork instead of ground beef, 1 tsp. of ground ginger (I couldn't find minced pickled ginger), and iceberg lettuce instead of Bibb or butter.

This was pretty good.  Something different.  I think it would make a good appetizer more than a meal.  I could not find butter lettuce, so I used Romaine.  I think it would have been better with the Butter lettuce.  I also used fresh ginger and regular vinegar because that is all I had.  If I make again, I will be sure to have all the ingrediants.

I just couldn't get the sauce quite right since I had a little bit more meat than called for and also added shitake mushrooms.  But the dish was good overall.

I followed the directions exactly in order to review the recipe and not my take on it.  My husband and I agreed that, while the flavors were great, the texture of the ground beef was a little unsettling.  This may be due in part to my comparison of this dish to bulgogi, or Korean BBQ, which uses similarly flavored slices of beef and is the original lettuce wrap.

This is without a doubt the best recipe i have made on this site, pf chang's eat your heart out.  I did as directed except i did not have any ginger this was worth every ingrediant in it.  I was in fat hog heaven eating them.  It made a lot too wow i should have cut it in half but i plan to eat it all.  I dont know why people said it was dry mine was so not dry.  I used gound beef chicken and pork mixture and cooked that with onions at one time drained, then put everything else in the pan stirred to coat and them put in a bowl to set.  Perfect!!  i also made the oriental dipping sauce that a couple people mentioned just in case it was dry but it wasnt that sauce was the bomb too.  I dont think words will do this recipe justice Thank you thank you thank for a wonderful dinner.

I used Morningstar Farms soy chicken strips instead of ground beef, which I diced up really small. This was delicious! I used the sauce recommended in the other reviews which was very good.

These were pretty good but a little sweet next time I would increase soy and decrease hoisin.  Also, i might try them with shredded chicken.  I served them with "Oriental Dipping Sauce" from this site and it went perfectly.  As well as fried rice. Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again with a few changes.

Killer! My store didn't have ground chicken so I just cubed some chicken tenderloins. Also threw in some celery and chopped red cabbage to clean out fridge. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the chili paste--the bit of spice was perfect. To the member wondered about the hoisin; I'm going to try again with the sauce on the side to scale back the calories and be even more WW friendly.

I made this with ground chicken, and it was awesome!!!! a definite keeper.  I made it up one night for a light dinner and then kept the leftovers for quick, light lunches through out the week.  It sure beat the deli meat sandwich.  My husband loved it too.  Craved it the evening I made it and wanted to eat the rest, I said no,, because I wanted it for lunches. :)  Next time I guess I know to make double.

This is very close to the restaraunt flavor. I changed the beef to ground chicken, dark sesame oil to light (that's all I could find), and no pickled ginger (also couldn't find), so used a teaspoon of ground ginger. They were delicious.

I made this with shrimp, and it was excellent. I chopped the shrimp before sauteeing, but next time I'll sautee them whole and then chop them to a finer texture in the food processor, because the bigger pieces kept falling out of the wraps. I'll also add some soy sauce to the shrimp. I thought this would taste oniony, but it didn't at all. The ginger and hoisin really stand out, and the water chestnuts give it a great crunchy texture. I didn't have enough hoisin, so I added some sweet and sour sauce and ponzu sauce. I can't wait to make this again.

This is a very tasty, light meal.  I used lean ground turkey. its so good i end up eating half the mixture by myself!  i did not add ginger the second time, but it was just as tasty as the first time i made this with the ginger.  i'm glad to have found this.

Made these exactly like the recipe...whole family loved them! Even the pickled ginger, which took some time to find!  I don't know if it's like PF Chang's or not, because we don't eat there, but these are wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Used a mixture of pork & chicken.  Made a week ahead & stored in freezer until the day of the party and then reheated it on the stove.  Worked very well.

Very good recipe.  I did alter as I did not have all the things on hand and thought it needed a little more flavor.  I used ground chiken and added some garlic and regular ginger, honey, cornstarch and a little honey teriyaki sauce.  Rave reviews.  Thanks!

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was soooo delicious! It took me a long time to prepare so maybe I'll get a food processor? There was no butter/bibb lettuce at the two grocery stores I went to so I bought red leaf lettuce - worked great! It was a little sweet for my taste, so I plan on using less seafood (hoisin) sauce next time. Can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful.  I only made enough for myself so I cut back a great deal. I didn't have any pickled ginger but I did sprinkle in some ground ginger while I was cooking. I also added some crushed red pepper for a little zing.  This is a great basic recipe. I love to tweak recipes to my tastes and this is a great one to do that.

Very good!  Instead of ground beef, I used boneless skinless chicken breast, and chopped it up in the food processor.  I also doubled the sauce, because it needed more.  Definitely something that I will make again!

These were great!  Tasted very similar to the ones I love at Chilis.  A few substitutions - I used fresh ginger, as I couldn't find the pickled kind, Romaine letuce and chopped boneless skinless chicken breast.  Yummy!

I've made this twice already and it is  soooo good!  It has become one of my husband's favorites.  I double the recipe for the sauce as suggested by others.  I used ground chicken and I couldn't find pickled ginger so I used ground ginger instead and it came out great.  I used the Hot Peanut Sauce from this site to go on top along with some shredded carrots.  It's a definite keeper and will be in our dinner rotation from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Good flavor. A friend made this for me and hers was much better. I'm sure it depends on your brand of hoisin sauce. Good recipe.

I made this using Yves' Ground Round (a tofu based meat substitute that is surprisingly meaty) and like other reviewers, upped the sauce quotient a bit and used fresh ginger, not pickled. Maybe because grating it is such a lovely, aromatic experience! I also added about 1.5 cups of rinsed bean sprouts for some extra crunch. We serve these with edamame on the side. A great, healthy, vegetarian meal. Wrapped small and secured with a toothpick, these would be great appies as well!

Very satisfying! We used romaine lettuce, and I don't have pickled ginger, so I used 1 T of fresh chopped ginger. Also added 1 shredded carrot at the end. Didn't have any green onions, so I bet it will be better next time when I do! I could not find *dark* sesame oil, so I used regular. Added some cayenne pepper for extra spice.

Needs some more seasoning of some sort, but definitely worth a first try and to add/vary it each time you make it.

These had a wonderful flavor and aroma.  However, I have never had these so my basis for comparison is non-existant.  Is the lettuce supposed to fall apart?  Is it supposed to be served hot or room temp?  Great taste just really messy.

This was really tasty.  Personally, I thought the Hoisan sauce was a little prevalent, I would reduce that a bit next time.  Also, the use of dark sesame oil makes a big difference in taste, it pays to search that out.  I used Romaine hearts cause I think butter lettuce is too wimpy for this dish.

Very good!  Found it initially a little bland, so I added extra soy sauce and chili sauce.  This actually tasted even better the next day, so I guess the flavors needed to meld.

I've never had PF Chang's lettuce wraps so I can't compare. I do know, however, that these were really really good. I ended up using more soy, vinegar and garlic, and I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground instead. Delicious, and not at all messy either. Thanks so much!

I think it is great!  I used ground chicken, olive oil, butter, red chili flakes and fresh ginger.  It is a recipe that you can tweak to your tastes.  Try it at least once!!

Good. I agree with one reviewer who said it's not PF Chang's but it was a close second. It needed a bit of something to make it a five star. Some more spice of some kind I think. But definately worth the effort. Thanks!

Great recipe. I used chicken in place of the ground beef and it turned out wonderfully. Everyone loved it! I used a bit more ginger and it gave it a nice "kick". Will for sure be making this again soon.  Thanks for sharing

I used ground pork and fresh grated ginger.  This was really yummy and a nice light dinner.  We didn't use any extra sauce.  We thought they were saucy enough.

I thought this was tasty last night, but as I'm eating the leftovers I'm finding that its even better the next day.  These were not absolutely to-die-for, but they are quite tasty and VERY easy to prepare.  I topped mine with cilantro, which I think is a must.

OUTSTANDING!  While it may look like there are a lot of ingredients, it really was very easy and quick to put together!  Hard to say if they are just as good as PF Chang's, because it's been a while, but certainly wonderful recipe!!!  Will make agaig!  Was great on a bed of white rice the next day as leftovers!

Very much like P.F. Changs if you substitute minced chicken for the beef.  I also used fresh ginger instead of pickled.  My husband has since requested these a ridiculous number of times.

This was positively fabulous....I did make a few changes;  
1) I used a mixture of pork/beef 2) Couldn't find pickled ginger so I used grated some fresh ginger; 3) These are really messy, so to make the wraps more "hand friendly", I prepared the wrap as the recipe indicated (use iceberg lettuce!).  THEN, I wrapped the whole thing in a soft tortilla.. Viola :-)

This is such a great adn easy recipe that is sure to impress. I serve it with iceberg lettuce and a few cilantro leaves on top.  Peanut sauce goes well with the wraps--but I made a cilatro-black bean sauce for some friends of mine who are allergic to peanuts.

This recipe was totally delicious.  The original recipe was for 4 servings, so I just doubled the ingredients to make more sauce.  I took the advice of another user and added peanut butter and it was great.  The next time I will add chopped peanuts to give it a nice crunch.  The crispy rice noodles was a nice addition as well and made a nice presentation.

Super yummy! Especially good with the Oriental Dipping sauce on this site that another reviewer mentioned below. I used ground veal which gave the dish a really nice texture, a little softer and lighter than straight beef. This is so simple and easy to make, but also tasty and unusual that it is the perfect entertaining dish.

Very good recipe but leave out the onions (the green ones can stay).  Easy to do and cheap once you have all of the spices/sauces on hand.  I will be making it again.

Very good - though I substituted chicken breast for the ground beef. The tast was almost identical to the asian chicken wrap appetizer from California Pizza Kitchen.

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe. It was unclear to me, however, as to how long to cook the onions before adding the other ingredients. Also, it did not say to, but I added the meat back into the mixture before serving which made sense. I agree that the chile sauce is a must... Add a minimum amount to the mixture but offer it on the side for those who want more heat.

I like this recipe as a basic.  The last time I made it I added one-half cup of peanut butter to the actual mixture.  It gave it more of a Thai taste; everyone loved it. Also, when I serve it, I always have peanuts on the side for each person to spoon onto their wrap to add some texture and crunch (if you don't feel bold enough to add the pb to the mix, this is a nice addition to the original recipe).  The chile pepper sauce is a must, which I also serve on the side so each person can spice it to their liking.

Fun idea, but it didn't have much flavor.  I didn't have the chile pepper sauce.  I agree that a peanut sauce would be good with it.
