Very tasty!  I prepared mine a little differently of course, I can't help myself.  I sliced my onions thin rather than chopping or dicing.  I used a 5 pepper spice blend rather than cayenne.  I laid the filets on top of some pre-cooked bacon I had leftover from breakfast.

For the ingrediants, I added the oil, garlic, onions, salt and pepper to a small microwaveable container.  I mixed these items together and cooked on high for 2 minutes, stirring half way through.

I laid the bacon in the casserole dish, the filets on top, then covered with the oil/onion/garlic mix.  I refridgerated for only an hour, then added an appropriate amount of 5 spice blend and covered with foil.  I baked for the recommended 30 minutes.

It was excellent, my husband loved it and so did I!  I'll definately serve this or any variation of it again!

This is my new favorite recipe for Tilapia.
I did modify the recipe to suit my taste buds.
I didn't marinade this at all.
I used my roasted garlic and spread two cloves on each piece of fish, added black pepper and salt.  
Drizzled olive oil and chili oil (Chinese grocer carry this) on fish. The last thing I added was Pappy's Rub on top of the onions (like a canjun spice mix).
I used my mandolin slicer to thinly slice the onions.
Baked for 30 minutes and broiled another 10 minutes.
The onions taste more like onions rings when they are broiled and get crunchy.  We ate 6 pieces between the two of us.  DEEEEVine.

This was great.  I marinated it only about 4 hours and baked it, serving it atop wilted spinach. I used less onion and added some basil.  Next time I fix it I will add a little less olive oil (there was a LOT in the dish after cooking).  I haven't had much luck fixing fish, although I order it frequently when dining out; now this will become a regular at our house!

I loved this recipe, however, I made a few minor changes.  I minced my garlic and diced my onions very finely.  Then I put them in a small bowl (custard cup) and added olive oil and then microwaved it for a minute.  The poured that the fish and left it in the fridge for 24 hours.  I baked it for 25 minuted regular and then added fresh parmesean cheese for the last 5 minutes.  My 3yr old and 2 yr old eat this better than chicken and usually eat more than one piece each.  This is a regular on our menu.

This was the first time I have ever had Tilapia.  I didn't use as much onion as the recipe called forand I doubled the amount of garlic...and it turned out great.

I added a little fresh lemon juice,and some fresh tyme. I only got to marinate it for an hour. So next time i will definitley marinate longer and add salt and pepper. The kids actually liked it! And my husband loved it! I will be making this more often now that I found a simple recipe.

This dish was quite bland when I made it according to the directions.  I made it another night as we had lots of tilapia from a trip to Costco.  I salted BOTH sides of the fish and added Italian seasoning before laying it on the aluminum foil which I brushed with olive oil.  I would also recommend tenting the fish with a layer of foil to keep it from drying out.  I also went heavier with the garlic - 3 times the amount and gave it a few sprays with "I can't believe it's not Butter."  It was quite tasty that way.

Very good, basic recipe!  I added fresh lemon juice and basil.  Very adaptable to use with fish other than tilapia.  I use this frequently!

Time didn't allow for overnight marinating, so I added a tiny dash of onion and garlic powder and this really turned out great! I'll make this again and again.

I was short of time so only marinated fish for one hour -- it was excellent.  Can't wait to serve this to friends.

I had never made Tilapia before this and this recipe was a hit.  I had to make a second pan, my kids and husband loved it.  The first pan I let marinate all night, but of course the second went straight to the oven, we couldn't tell a difference.  Will probably skip marinating next time.

This recipe was a big hit.  We don't really like onions with our fish, so we left them out.  Also, to avoid the overnight portion of this recipe, we skipped the marinade.  Instead, we rubbed minced garlic on both sides of the fish and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.  Then we sliced thin pats of butter (about 2-3 tablespoons worth) and laid them over the tilapia before baking.  Very easy and came out great.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a little bit too much onion for my taste, but wasn't bad. I don't think I would marinate this for more than an hour and then bake.

I make this often, we love it! I rarely marinate longer than a few minutes and it still comes out tasty. I used chopped garlic and sprinkle it all over the fish. I disagree with one review- this does NOT need salt. My husband is on a low sodium diet and this is one of the few recipes I love that is no salt.

Did not have time to marinate overnight. I used fillet of sole because that is what we like. Put them on a meat platter, sprinkled with garlic powder, Old Bay, and cayenne pepper. Drizzled olive oil over the fillets, put slices of onion on top. Covered with saran wrap and refrigerated for 1 1/2 hrs. It was too hot to use the oven so I turned the grill on outside, med-low. Used a large piece of heavy duty foil and transferred the fish and oil onto to foil, sealed tightly. Cooked on preheated grill for 10 minutes. Great recipe.

I LOVE this dish!  I had never made tilapia before and this was so easy, moist, and delicious.  I usually don't have time to marinate over night, so I saute the onions and garlic in the oil and some butter for a few minutes then add to the fish and bake. Its perfection!

I was totally surprised by my "meat-and-potatoes" boyfriend's reaction to this recipe--he loved it!!  He even asks for it on a regular basis!  I didn't get to marinate it for more than an hour, but that was just fine.  I also seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before baking.  A definite keeper!

I couldn't believe how flavorful the fish came out.  I only did the garlic and olive oil and served the fish plain with grilled vegetables.  It was a great, light meal.

I won't make this again - it was a disappointment.  Where's the salt?  Where's the pepper?  Where's the flavor?  Fish tastes best when it is fresh; ideally, it should be used the same day it is purchased.  Marinating the tilapia did nothing to add to the dish's flavor; it just made the fish another day older.

Pretty good.  I've never had tilapia before and chose this recipe.  I think I will try tilapia again, but with a different recipe.  This was a good place to start though.  Very simple.  Onions didn't get cooked enough, so we just scraped them off and didn't eat them.  Was very tender and easy to eat.  My 2 year old loved it!

Letting the fish sit overnight with the onion made it too stong.  The onion was overwhelming.

Didn't marinade, just baked it covered in minced garlic, olive oil, a variety of crushed peppers, and topped with diced onion. Awesome!

I made this with cod instead of tilapia and added a little more garlic than called for because I love it.  I think this is a great recipe.  I know others have said it was bland, but I didn't feel that way.  It has a light and simple flavor, and is simply delicious!

You really gotta like garlic and onion more than fish to like this recipe, I didn't get the bland thing most talked about, all I tasted was garlic & onion.  The Broiled Tilipia Parmesan from Phoebe on this site is much better than this recipe, I gave it three stars because my hubby liked it, but I will stick to the other recipe from now on!

My husband and I have been making our tilapia like this forever.  It is the best.  Another great way to do it is in a tightly wrapped foil packet on the grill, and we frequently replace or add to the onions with other veggies (green beans, zucchini, etc). Salt makes it even better.

This was my first time baking with fish, and having Tilapia.  My roommate and I both loved the recipe.  We didn't have any onion, added a little extra garlic, some basil, and black pepper instead of cayenne pepper.  It turned out great!

Awesome.  I didn't marinade because I don't think fish needs to be marinaded.  I put the olive oil with melted butter in a baking dish, rubbed the fish on both sides in butter/oil, put lemon juice over all and then sprinkled both side with garlic powder and roasted onion granules and baked as directed.  - turned out great!

I'm loathe to write a poor review, but we didn't care for this very much.  Admittedly, it was my first attempt to cook or eat tilapia, and the fish was frozen, so maybe that's to blame, but this was really garlicy, even for a girl who loves garlic.

I really liked this recipe, my husband hates fish and he was asking if we could have it again tommorrow! I did add my own touch to it though, I only used 1/4 of an onion and i added paprika, a pinch of tyme with some cajun spices I found this gave it a good kick and some wonderfull flavours!

I made this recipe in the kitchen and it didn't turn out very well. The vegetables, particularly the onions, were undercooked even though I actually cooked it 5 minutes longer than specified because my wife likes fish well done. As a leftover I scraped the remaining onions off of the fish and cooked them for about 10 minutes in a little olive oil which made them better, but even so it was not a very good dish.

I could not believe something so easy to prepare turned out to be so delicious. It was very well received, and I'll definitely be making this often.  I did add a little sea salt.

I put my spin on this one! I sauteed olive oil,garlic,celery,green pepper and onions. Removed everything but the oil. Placed four Tilapia fillets in the pan and seared both sides. Placed the veggies back into pan and added jar of salsa and 1 1/2 c water. Let it simmer about 20 minutes.Last five minutes I added some blended cheese. It was delicious served over rice! with a side salad!

Very tasty yet simple way to cook tilapia.  Yum!  I've also sprinkled a bit of parmesean cheese before baking, which is also very good.

I liked the basic recipe. A bit too much onion(maybe I should have chopped it finer?). I cooked it in foil parcels in the oven - delicious!

I made this dish the other day and really wasn't too impressed.  I thought it had way too much garlic and onion (which I normally love),  and it was missing something......maybe salt?  My husband on the other hand loved it and thought it was the best fish I ever made!  After he was finished eating it, he did comment that when I made it again, cut back on the onion a little bit!

Very good!  My husband gave rave reviews.  Will definitely make again.  Being from the South, I added a little more seasoning...just to give a kick.  The fish cooked to perfection.

Quick and easy to prepare.  Read the directions carefully though...towards the bottom of the recipe it says to "refrigerate 8 hours or more"...so much for having it right then and there!  Delicious!  I have served this more than once in my house.

I didn't have time to marinate and had to substitute an ingredient or two, but even then, it was great!  This was the first time I baked fish and it was perfect.  I further complimented it with a glass of Chardonnay.  Thanks!

Very good--I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used a bit of regular chili powder and regular pepper; it worked wonderfully! I might try adjusting with some other spices just for fun. this one is a keeper!

I really liked this fish. I think maybe I would season it a little more next time. I am cajun and it was a tiny bit bland..I did add some Slap Ya mama cajun seasoning but i probably needed more of that and pepper and cayenne.  I served it over parmesan cheese fries and added some parmesan over the fish at serving also.  I would make this again!  I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer and I am guessing it is from the onions covering the top of the fish.

Loved it! Was very flaky and tender. I chopped the onion along with the garlic and sprinkled it over the filets. I used garlic pepper salt. Also, only marinated for about an hour. Came out great. Will make again many times.

Good stuff. Marinated from morning instead of overnight. Husband and I equally enjoyed. Added grated parmesan cheese on top. Served with homemade potato fries and a salad.

GREAT recipe.. and I don't even usually like fish, but this was delicious! My husband even said this was maybe the best fish he's ever had!! I did add basil as another reviewer mentioned and topped with Parmesan cheese for the last five minutes. I can't wait to try this recipe again! Oh, and I was only able to marinate for about 8 hours, but still tasted great!

Guess what? I didn't have time to marinate, but thought I'd go for it anyway.  This was delicious, even without the marinating.  The cayenne peppper added a wonderful slight zing.

Followed recipe pretty much like it said.  I used regular pepper.  I did grill it on my indoor 'george foreman' look alike grill.  It turned out good.  Definitely needed some salt though.

The recipe was an ease to make.  I ALWAYS, season my foods before cooking or marinating so it didn't come out blan to me at all.  The Cayenne pepper was a little overpowering though and will therefore use less of that next time.

VERY easy to make. It is a little watery, but it could be because I didn't dry the fish off with a paper towel. The flavor is  mild, next time I may add more minced garlic. Quick and easy recipe though!

This is very good and my first experience with Tilapia.  Since it is a Mediterranean fish, the garlic and olive oil honors the dish.  I did not marinate due to late night dinner and it was still very good.  I used minced garlic and dehydrated minced onion which made little crunchy yummies.  I also sprinkled on some paprika because I like the way it makes baked/broiled fish taste/look.  Will add this to my fish recipe repertoire.  (WW=5pt.)

Yuck!  That's about all I can say, and I'm a big fish lover.  Too much onion (& I used half the recipe calls for) and way overpowering taste.  Won't be keeping this one.

I found that the prescribed amount of garlic was too much.  The recipe is certainly quick and easy, but I felt that the combination of seasonings did not do justice to this wonderful fish.

This dish was so easy and had quite a bit of flavor. First I washed the Tilapia then I coated it with Garlic like it says then I poured the 3 Tsp's of olive oil over the the fish making sure it was all coated nicely with the oil. Then I cut up my vidalia onion into chunks like the picture showed sprinkled it with some course sea salt and placed it in the refrigerator for 5 hours to marinate. I left off the black pepper and the cayenne pepper and it still had great flavor.  Comments from my dinner guests were "this tastes great!" "it is so nice and moist" "I can't believe you did not cover it and it did not burn...". The fish was cooked as said however, I did not transfer from the marinade dish I used the same dish that the fish was marinading in not sure if that made a difference and I also used EVOO olive oil from Chile. Easy and Delicious!

My first time making this. My family and I enjoyed it so much. Even my picky 9 year old son. We put the tilapia on the grill with the tin foil for apx. 18 minutes. It was cooked to perfection. I will definitely make this again.

Made as the recipe is written. Fish was edible but needed a lot more spice (according to my family's taste) since Tilapia is a much milder fish.

This really didn't hit it with us and I am surprised because I thought the taste would be stronger considering the lengthy marinade time.  It was rather bland.  Sorry Stephen.

Really great recipe, though I didn't have too much time to marinate and think it would have come out even better if it was left overnight as the recipe suggests. For the onion, I sliced it into thin ringlets, dipped them in the remaining marinade, and coated them with breadcrumbs before laying them over the fish... came out nice and crispy and complimented the fish wonderfully!   Thanks for this simple, quick recipe!

I greatly enjoyed this, despite marinating for only 8 hours or so.  I used basa (Vietnamese Catfish) instead of tilapia; being a mild white fish, it works well, too.  I don't know why some reviews recommend dumping more spice on; I think it would overwhelm the flavor of the fish.

I was not a fan of this at all - DH liked it better than I did, but not by much.  If you like to taste the fish that you're eating, then this is not the dish for you.  We found that the flavour of the onions and garlic completely overpowered the flavour of the fish.  Needless to say, this one will be removed from my recipe box.

It was really good. Even my brother ate one, which is loco. I marinated it overnight like the recipe said, but I cut the onions into rings so I could take them off after the fish baked. I loved the cayenne.

I love tilapia and I love easy!!  This dish was perfect and simple - a wonderful vehicle for creativity - I could see tossing some capers in this, a butter/white wine sauce, cilantro, or salsa as someone suggested, mushrooms, zucchini - I personally would use less onion (1/2?) and oil (2T?) and add some salt, but this recipe is absolutely going into regular rotation at my house.  Thanks to Letty Ann for the great idea!!

I am not usually a fish person, but this was great.  I didn't even have the cayenne pepper, I can't imagine how good it would have been with it.  I served this with couscous, it was a hit with the family.

First time ever making fish -- this was so easy and good!  Only marinated 1 hour and reduced the amount of onion, and it still was a bit too much onion for us.  Also added some tomato as someone else recommended which was a great addition.  Fish was cooked perfectly which was a huge plus for a first-timer.  Will make again with less onion and more tomoato.  Thank you!

We are big fans of tilapia (and Costco sells it for a great price) so we enjoy trying different ways to eat it.  I, too, added tomatoes to my fish while it baked.  They soaked up the garlic olive oil marinade as well.  A very good and healthy meal.

This recipe was excellent!  My roommate thought she had wondered into the wrong house.  We were both pleasently suprised.  I did alter the recipe a little.  I added tomotoes when I baked it.  I am going to make it again when my parents come to visit.  (they don't think I can cook ;o)

One of the things which is a factor in the quality of the meal is how it goes over with our kids.  Our six year old ate the fish up and asked for seconds, so this is a hit in our house!
It was very simple and most definitely a "company" meal.  
We grilled it in foil and found it hard to determine the doneness, so we will bake it next time or use a basket on the grill.
We're always looking for good, quick fish recipes.  THANK YOU!

Fantastic!! I have an awful time cooking fish. My family loved it. Even my fish hating son. I added a little bit of chili powder for an extra kick.

This recipe was very good.  I marinated the fish in my 13 x 9 baking pan overnight so the next day all I had to do was put it in the oven.  Nice make ahead dish.  The fish was very tender and flavorful.  I have made this a few times now and will continue to make this often.

I am one that don't really like seafood or too much garlic. I decided to try making 1 of the filets with this recipe. I didn't see it said to let it set overnight until midway through. I didn't have time to do that so I just prepared without letting it sit all night. I was really surprised how good this was. It didn't have an overbearing garlic taste. We grilled it over foil. Even my daughter loved it! I gave it a 4 star only because of having to let it set overnight. I seem to find a lot of recipes like this lately, when I'm searching for last minute dinner choices.

Don't know what I did wrong - but it was very bland - more onion taste than anything else.  And my whole refrigerator smells like onions & garlic after its overnight marinade.

I just like most people did tweek  this just a bit, I had  Flounder instead of tilapia. I also did not marinate it. I  used olive oil,  fresh garlic cloves sliced,  scallions,mini heirloom tomatoes and cayenne pepper, I  broiled it for 5 min and baked  at 400°  for about 10 min.  it came out soooo  delicious!

This was a good recipe, but it needed a bit of reworking. I added more garlic, plus basil and parsley. I only had an hour before I baked it, so I had to make the ingredients in stacked format: fish, oil, salt, pepper, parsley, basil, garlic, fish, oil, etc., I then wrapped it in plastic wrap for an hour and placed in the refrigerator. After an hour, placed a tin foil tent in a cake pan and put the fish side by side in the tin foil tent, in the pan. I baked the fish in it for 30 minutes at 350. The tent out of tin foil allows steam to build up and decreases the chances of the fish drying. I also cut red and yellow sweet peppers and onions and put over the top of the fish before securing the tent top. Tilapia can be a bit fishy, especially for young eaters. My young niece Maddie would love this recipe and she hates tilapia! You may need to decrease the garlic for young eaters, but my husband said it was the best tilapia he's ever had. : )

I used cod loins instead and it came out very tender and moist.  I used frozen cod, put in the marinade the night before, ready for a quick dinner the next night!  I followed the advice of another poster and covered it with foil for 30 minutes, then broiled for five.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very good! I served it over fresh spinach (per another posters suggestion) spooning some of the sauce over the top and garnished it with tomato wedges and lemon slices. The only reason I gave it a four is that it was bland which is one of my husband's big complaints about fish.  next time I will try some different ways to add flavor, perhaps add some fresh dill.  I will definitely make it again.

I'm not a fish eater, the texture just doesn't phase me, but this dish was pretty good. It's the first time i ever cleaned my plate when eating fish. My husband took the left overs with him to work, and all his co-workers tried a piece and LOVED IT! in fact, i'm cooking it again for them tonight.

The fish was great baked just in olive oil and garlic, but it needed something else with it.  Maybe a little less garlic and a little salt and some fine seasoned bread crumbs.  They were great paired with a buttery rice pilaf and steamed asparagus.

Pretty good basic recipe.  As is, it was rather bland for my taste.  I ended up adding garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Will make again, but with more seasonings.

Needs SALT!!  Very bland recipe as written, even with the strong flavors of the chopped onion and garlic.  We added salt at the table, and it saved the meal.

Not for me!!! Marinated but all the flavors were outside the fish so way too garlicky and the fish tasted bland. If you like tilapia I recommend Broiled Tilapia Parmesan(on this site) awesome!

This was terrific!  I substituted garlic powder for the crushed garlic, omitted the onion, used cajun seasoning for the cayenne pepper, and didn't allow it to marinate at all... just popped it in the oven and voila!  30 minutes later we had a fantastic fish dinner!  Yum!!

My husband, our 2 teenagers and I all liked this recipe. I substituted 1/2 tsp. onion powder for the chopped onion, added a little salt, and only marinated for one hour.  I added a bit of thyme before I sealed in foil.  It's a keeper - thanks!

Not bad.  I added sundried tomatoes.  I think next time I would saute the onions in olive oil before I added them on the fish.  They were a little undercooked.

SO GOOD! I added a little salt to the marinade. I wrapped each fillet in foil and badked. I also added sliced tomatoes and fresh thyme right before putting in the oven. Served with basmati rice and sauteed baby bok choy. This one's a keeper!

Very good - baked this in the oven.  It needed a little more salt or something to give it more flavor, but it worked nicely with the Tilapia.

I had never had tilapia before. Very good recipe of nicely marinated fish. I added some Italian seasoning when marinating the fish. Served with lemon wedges, this fish dish is going to be our keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  Next time we will probably use less onions.  This was our first time with tilapia - I think this is a good recipe for first timers...it will be fun to tweak next time.

I was expecting more flavor from this recipe, but was slightly disappointed, I found it to be a little bit bland. The fish itself came out very moist, which was great.

This was edible and that the best I ca say for it.  The fish was bland and not tasty in any way.  It's the first of many recipes for tilapia that I have felt this way about. Sorry, but this will not be made again.

I rubbed in minced garlic and sprayed the fish and pan  with butter flavoured cooking spray. After that I seasoned the fish with salt and Cayenne pepper. I placed the fish on the pan with thinly sliced onion rings on top. Then I drizzled the olive oil on top of everything. I didn't marinate it. MI will make it again because it was fast and easy.

This recipe is magnificent.  Easily prepared and finished in no time.  I made a few adjustments.  I nuked thinly chopped onion, garlics and olive oil in the microwave for 70 seconds.  I sparsely seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, garlic pepper, garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  I applied the nuked garlic/olive oil/garlic mixture to the fish on top.  I grilled for 15 minutes and it came out juicy, flavorful and overall perfect!.  I served with grilled asparagus, mini corn on the cob, broccoli florets, and fried sweet plantains.  I highly recommend!

This recipe was simple to make. However, when it was finished cooking, it was not aesthetically pleasing. I used a lot of garlic on these filets, and they did benefit from it. They were bland. The onions did not cook in a satisfactory way, either. My dining partner said the flavor profile was good, but it was a little too basic.

This was bland. I may use it again, next time adding lemon juice, and using butter instead of olive oil, and Italian seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper.

This was good... but when you double the recipe...it ends up being VERY garlicky.  I think if I make it again, I would not use quite as much garlic, especially if doubling the recipe.

For such a basic recipe this was awfully good. My whole family (except daughter who doesn't like fish) loved it and asked me to make it again. I think next time just for my family preference we will add more garlic. thanks for a quick healthy recipe!

Nice New Easy way to make this fish!! My husband loved it. I just had to add chili powder and garlic salt or it might have been too bland. I only marinated it for 8 hours but it was still full of flavor.
