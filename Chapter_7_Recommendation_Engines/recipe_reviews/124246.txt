This was so good. I cooked this for one hour turning halfway through.  Next time I will use a little more seasoning, but it was still very good - even the next day.

This chicken turned out excellent. Crispy and tasty on the outside, moist on the inside. I did add a touch of garlic to the seasonings for personal taste. This is a good dish to make when it is the only thing you are cooking on the grill, because the lid needs to stay shut for the most part. I'm glad I tried this. My husband and I both thought it was perfect. Thanks!

Instead of using the buttermilk mix, I used Bisquick Heart Healthy mix.  It was great!

This was good, but I think I could have had the same results using the oven. Was surprised how golden it looked. I guess it would keep your from heating up your kitchen in the summer!

So easy and so good!  My family loved it!  Even my picky 7 year old.  Just remember to turn the chicken halfway through cooking, and check your cooking times.  Mine did not need the full time as in the recipe.  It was tender and juicy and full of flavor.  This recipe is going into my recipe book.  Its a keeper!  Thanks!

In fairness, I think I need to try this one again. I also used Bisquick, but I think it could have used more spices. I wasn't sure what "seasoned salt" was, but after researching, I made my own. Next time I will go heavier on the spices. Also, I have a gas grill - so perhaps something was lost vs. charcoal.

Good - probably could  use a bit of onion and garlic powder. would also season the chicken before dredging in addition to seasoned flour. Didn't grill  just did in oven at 425 for about 30 minutes.

It tasted bland to me. I put cranberry sauce with mine, and for my husband, BBQ sauce. I'd make this again but with a cream sauce of some sort.

Very good.  I would add a little more seasoning, but it is so easy that any adjustments are easy.
