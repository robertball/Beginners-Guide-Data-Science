Awesome, entire family loved it!  The only thing I did different was adding only 1/2 cup splenda instead of 1 cup sugar to the water.  Plus - I don't think you need quite as much butter, I only used 3 tbsps while broiling.

This tastes just like lobster.  My whole family loves this recipe.  I've made it at least 4 times, and I've had the best results when the cooked fish has time to chill and dry out in the fridge before broiling.  I've used mostly frozen cod from Sam's Club.  I'd like to try it with monkfish to see how that tastes.

I decided to give this recipe a try in an attempt to serve fish that isn't battered and fried to my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and the results were great.  I have four kids and they loved this recipe! The 3-year-old had three helpings! I agree with other reviews that it has a lobster-like consistency and flavor.  Husband has already requested I make this again and often!  Thanks for the great recipe and a nice change of pace from the same old fish.

Oh my gosh!!  This is a fantastic recipe if you love lobster, but it's beyond your pay grade.  You need to adjust for the thickness of your fillets (boil/broil times), but this is dang close!!  The sugar in the boiling mixture adds the sweetness, and the texture of the cod is tender and delicious!  I broiled the fish with less butter and ate it with no extra butter, and it was still DELICIOUS!!   How good would it be with extra buttah???  Will make again and again and again!!

This was a great recipe! I used Market Day frozen cod, poached it using Splenda instead of sugar and cut the amount of butter in half. I also chilled the cod before broiling it. Best of all, the house didn't smell fishy after dinner!

I cannot believe how easy this was and how good it was!  My husband loved it.  Even the two picky teenage girls thought it was great.  I would not change a thing.  Using the frozen filets was a great idea  to help keep them together.  I would only suggest to use a large deep skilett instead of a sauce pan so the filets don't bump together so much and fall apart.  I've given the recipe out a lot since trying it.

Just fabulous! I made this with a turnip gratin, and my husband was just over the moon! References to this tasting like lobster are totally true! I'm a non-sugar person, so I swap out for splenda, and it still tastes wonderful! Thanks for a keeper!

I made this dish with red snapper fillets. I spread the butter on the fish after boiling it then I sprinkled garlic powder, clubhouse italiano seasoning and parmesan cheese. I also used clubhouse roasted pepper and garlic seaoning on some of the fillets. My husband loved it he also said it tasted like lobster.It was easy and I will make it again and agian.

Very easy to do and taste great.  House does not smell like fish when you are done cooking.  Gave it a 5 for kids, not real sure because our kids won't touch fish.

This was very good. I did use frozen cod. I also thought this tasted similar to lobster, especially when dipping in melted butter. Yummy! Will definately be making this easy dish again.

It's amazing that cod can be made to taste sweet like lobster! This is definately a recipe for those who are leary of eating fish. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and it turned out great. The only thing I will do differently next time is be more carefull of the boiling time. My cod fillets weren't that thick and I boiled for 5 minutes, but they were starting to fall apart. They stayed together well during the remaining 8 minute broiling time though, and ended up looking beautiful and tasting amazingly like lobster.

The only reason why I'm giving this only four stars is the boil/broil times I think are way off.  i did not bring my water to a complete boil and cooked for 2 mins and then broiled for like 3 mins and my fish was like rubber.  I will make this again as the flarvors are good...does taste like lobster.  Next time I will bring my water to a boil then let temp come way down and soak my fish (not cook) to absorb the flavors then broil until fish flakes with the butter.

Like some others I was a little afraid to try this recipe.  I was wrong to wait so long.  Made it EXACTLY as written & we loved it. I think if you are reviewing a recipe you should follow it as written.  If you change it & then give it a poor rating it's rating your own recipe not someone else's.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow!! That was surprisingly good! 
I had used a pre-frozen cod, I think it was a little freezer burned. Next time I will buy fresh and freeze it before boiling.
The funny thing was, I read the one review about it tasting like lobster but didn't put much credo in it.
I didn't say anything to the hubby about that or about the recipe.
The first comment out of my husbands mouth "kinda strange to have a fish that tastes like lobster".
But that is strange in a VERY good way! And while the house may not stink like fish the broiling sure smoked up my house, but I will definately make this again. It was well worth it!

Excellent recipe. Couple recommendations. Put your fish in the pan, measure in enough water to cover, and then adjust the amount of sugar and salt proportionately. And watch the broiler carefully to avoid overdone fish. Excellent recipe. Thank you! We sprinkled two of our filets with cajun seasoning and they were the BEST!

I know this was rated highly, but it was so bland. Maybe if some garlic or something like that was added, but it was very boring.

Very good, tasty & simple to do.  I even boiled the cod in the morning, then refrigerated it till dinner. Then it only took a few minutes in the broiler. For health reasons, we're trying to eat more fish, but up till now only liked it battered & deep fried. This was great!  Needs no changes. It's a keeper.  Thanks much.....

This was excellent!  It tasted like lobster!  I boiled it for about 10-15 minutes and had it under the broiler for about 5.  Very good!

Yes, because you sweeten the codfish with the sugar poach, it does taste very similar to lobster.  A very good substitute.  Make sure you use very thick codfish and not the little skinny frozen filets.  I tried both and the thinner cod was extremely overcooked, but the thick cod can withstand both cooking processes.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Had to try this out of pure curiosity... and now I'm hooked!  The family went head over heels for it... and they agreed it really tastes like lobster!!  I used 2 lbs of cod and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  The first time I made it I did use cod and it was fantastic.  The second time I used Swai (much cheaper farm-raised catfish).  I did use Old Bay seasoning instead of paprika - that added to the "shellfish" flavor - kind of a cross between lobster and crab. My husband thought that was better!  I do think it doesn't need as much butter as is listed, and I might also try it with the splenda or half the sugar and see how that works. I will use this often with whatever fish I can find on sale - thanks!

Fabulous! I made it exactly as directed, even though I was apprehensive about the sugar/butter amount. And, boy, am I glad I did. Superb!

after having made this a couple times (and having enjoyed it), I decided to make faux-lobster club sandwiches with it!  I added a little shrimp for texture and color, seasoned with a few shakes of old bay and dill weed and then lightly coated with mayo.  Served on white...(and i mean like wonderbread white:-)...w/ bacon, lettuce and tomato.  pretty darn good!

this was okay,but not great.The mistake I made was using fresh cod,which I thought would be even better.It just wound up tasting sugary and buttery-no wonder kids love it.Sorry.

I make "poor man's lobster" all the time.  It is wonderful. I tried the variation in this recipe and DID NOT like the sugar...I prefer to squeeze a little lemon in the water instead of using the sugar.  But brushing with butter and serving with a side of butter is a must.  Feel free to blacken, garlic, cajun...any spice you like.

Just to clear something up: "torsk" is simply the Norwegian word for cod. It has nothing to do with whether it's prepared with paprika and butter, it's just a word.  Having said that, I have made torsk many different ways and this method was a winner.  I had a little problem with the fillets coming apart in the water, so next time I have to boil more gently, but the taste was still very good.  I would make it this way again.

Thank you for giving me a new idea for preparing cod.  However, I expected some sort of transformation of the fish, based on all the glowing reviews and comparisons to lobster.  It's like lobster in that you dip it in butter, but that's where the similarity ends.  Next time I'll just butter poach the fish for rich, sweet, lobster-y flavor.

While the recipe sounded a bit bizarre, I gave it a try and we were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was.  It does have that wonderful taste of lobster.  I used Splenda instead of sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  My husband asked for more....unfortunately there was no more since I was leery and didn't cook that much fish in case we didn't like it.  I will make this one again and again.

This was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly. But the fish turned out rubbery and the melted butter was bland. If we make this again, I will definitely add my own additional spices to the melted butter. As to the rubber texture, I'll have to ask someone who knows cooking better than I do. I could be worth another try though.

I found cod on sale and wanted to try something different.  This dish would make Paula Deen proud, there is so much butter and sugar involved that I could have made a batch of cookies instead...who knew fish could be so unhealthy?  The end result was, as previous reviewers stated, kind of close to that of lobster (albeit a lobster who'd just had a sugar bath!).  I don't think I'll make this again, but I am very glad I tried it as my curiosity is totally sated :)

This was very Yummy! My fish was only part frozen. So I melted the butter in a cast iron skillet. Added a small amount of the water and sugar, fish and spices and then finished under the broiler. Very Good I will be making this again.

This was so good.  I tried it for the first time when some company we were having brought some cod. Everyone raved and thought it tasted just like lobster. We will make this many more times to come!

Here is a little trivia: Torsk is a Danish (Nordic) word that simply means COD and doesn't tell anything about how the fish is cooked. 
I haven't come across this recipe in Denmark - wonder how it got its name?

This recipe freaked me out...but I loved it!  I couldn't get over the fact that I had to boil the fish in  sugar water first...I don't think all the butter called for in the recipe is necessary...I only used 6 Tbspns to brush over the cod fillets I used.  It really did taste like lobster!  Me and my husband loved...but the kids didn't think it was anything special - but then again they don't like lobster.  This recipe is for lobster lovers only!  Mmm...

As advertised - easy and tastes (kind of) like lobster. However, I'd say this could easily work with less butter. I used only the 6 tablespoons it calls for as basting liquid - putting about 3/4 of it on prior to broiling, and the rest after broiling before serving, and I thought it was still too much. No need to add extra butter tableside. Best parts of the recipe are that it's prepared from frozen and it loses its fishy taste in the sweet boiling liquid and the buttery broil, to appease picky eaters who don't like fish.

This turned out amazing! My husband cooked the cod and served it to me. I asked what is it and he said guess. I said lobster? NOPE! Cod! It was great. I've made it twice since then. Like with any fish, careful not to overcook or it'll be dry and tough.

This was not good at all. I sprinkled it with Ritz cracker crumbs, lemon juice, salt and pepper and it still tasted like wallpaper paste. Like 99% of all other fish, the only way to eat this is batter dipped and deep fried with lots of Old Bay and tartar sauce.

This was pretty good but it didn't taste much like lobster. It tasted like whitefish cooked in butter. ??? I cooked 3 filets in a skillet at a low boil (my filets stayed togther well) & scaled the recipe down to 4. I also decreased teh sugar some, maybe that's why didn't have much "lobster" flavor. I sprinkled the filets w/ garlic powder before broiling & lemon juice after. We enjoyed it & will make it again but I won't expect it to taste like lobster. ;o)

wonderful.  Just an FYI for the picky, it's taste and texture are more like that of lobster tail than claw.  My picky husband doesn't like the tail, only the claw.

This was very tasty! Every person in my family..my dh, my 2 yo, and my 4yo--(me too!) ate it up! My kids are notoriously picky and they gobbled up fish! Wow! I didn't change a single thing--didn't need to! My dh a huge seafood lover enjoyed the fact that it tasted so similar to lobster. Thanks for the yummy and EASY fish recipe! Will be making it again and again and again....

This was okay, but I doubt I would make it again. I followed the recipe, using fresh fish instead of frozen. Even though I boiled and broiled my fish for less time than the recipe states, it was overdone. It did taste like lobster, but not nearly as good. My fish also fell apart while boiling, so it was in bite-sized pieces when broiling and for serving. I don't know if this is supposed to happen or not.

My kids and I didn't care for this at all, but none of us like lobster (which other reviewers compared the taste of this to).  It was kind of sweet -- yuck.  However, I gave it four *s because my husband who likes lobster thought this was pretty good. So if you like lobster you may like this...if not, don't bother.

This was a treat! DH Sounded like a broken record with "This is really Good!" As close as you can get to lobster, and a lot cheaper!! AND SUPER EASY! I'll be keeping a bag of Cod in the freezer from now on. It will be a great dish for unexpected company.

Very good and easy! Nice change to "more fish" as it similar to lobster - can't wait to try it in lobster rolls.

This did not work for me, but I should have known better than to boil fish in a sauce pan. It fell completely apart, and was better suited for making fish cakes. That said, the flavor was delicate and sweet, like lobster. It might work better to poach the fillets in a wide skillet instead.

Great recipe. It does taste very similar to lobster. You don't even need to broil the fish. Instead of broiling, I melted 2-3 tbs of butter in the pan over medium-low heat and cooked the cod on both sides until it was slightly golden brown, adding paprika to one side. I also used Splenda instead of sugar in the water mix.

This REALLY tastes like Lobster!! I was looking for a simple recipe. My cod wasn't thick enough and fell apart before the end of the boiling phase. I found out that my BF doesn't like Lobster, so he hated this. It tasted bland and a bit too sweet for me. It IS a gluten-free and cheap alternative to lobster, but my family labeled it a "dud." If I ever made it again, I would lessen the amount of sugar used, although that might make it taste less like lobster. I won't be making this again!

It's easier not to overcook the fish this way. It tasted pretty good. My husband and I agreed that we didn't need that much butter for dipping, so you might want to use less.

Got my kids to eat fish and they could help me make the meal!  The only change was I bought the pre-made butter with dill sauce.  I also made spinach couscous and put the fish on top.

The flavor was great, but I had 8 nice filets to use- and after they boiled for 2 minutes they fell into chunks and pieces- disappointing! next time i will just add a little bit of sugar to the butter and broil until done. You only need 1/2 cup of butter- that was more than enough for my 8 filets. The flavor paired with cod was really excellent that's why it was so disappointing that the fish fell apart.

This is a quick, easy recipe. The result is an attractive, mild but pretty good fish. Does taste a bit like lobster, especially with the melted butter served alongside...although I wouldn't say it is absolutely necessary to make the dish. I think it could have used a sprinkling of salt along with the paprika. Overall, a tasty, easy, and different way to prepare affordable frozen cod.

Thank you for not only a delicious, but quick and easy recipe. After dinner my step-son pronounced it "the best", and my husband said I would have to make it again and have his mother over for dinner. She loves lobster, and the poaching process puts that sweet/salty ocean taste in the fish. I will be making this again!

Awesome! Just like other reviewers, I agree, this tastes very similar to lobster and the texture is divine! We were all fighting over it! Yum! One thing though, it calls for way more butter than we needed. I used just one stick and still had some left over.

Terrific way to prepare frozen fish!  Recommend halving butter and adding more flavorful spice(s), in addition to paprika.

My kids loved this fish. I followed the first step exactly, but I did not broil.  I put it in a grill basket on the grill for 2-3 minutes each side. Don't forget to rebrush it with butter before serving.

Amazing with cod!  My 2 year old asked for 3rds!  But I tried the same recipe with whitefish and it was a disaster.   Use only cod for best results!  I'll be using this recipe all the time!  Only 1/2 cup of butter is really needed for the broiling.

This was very good and I will definitely make it again.  Make sure you use thick fillets because the thinner fillets will fall apart.  I used about 1/2 C sugar and only 1/2 C butter and it was more than enough.  Thanks for the great recipe

Very good. We also make a simpler version of this...just boil the cod fillets in plain water, drain on paper towels (fillets do fall apart but still taste great) and serve with plenty of melted margarine (the healthier kind). I think the margarine works just fine, and I really don't want to detract from the healthy part of the meal by dipping it in butter.

Um...hmmm.  What to say about this dish.  My feelings are kind of all over the place.  First, I should point out that if you use fresh filets, they WILL fall apart during the boiling process.  But that's okay.  I simply drained the water off, dumped the pieces onto a double layer of paper towels, let them drain, and then transferred them to a foil covered pan.  I brushed the pieces with melted butter and generously sprinkled paprika over the pile before broiling (I only broiled for 5 min. or so).  It was actually rather pretty (kind of like lump crab meat or something).    The flavor of this fish is...well, kind of like kettle corn.  Sweet, salty, and buttery.  So of course it tastes "good"...but it's kind of a strange flavor for fish.  And certainly not very healthy (the ingredients are pretty similar to what goes into a doughnut, if you think about it).  BUT I will probably make this one again because my husband loved it.

Just had this for dinner! And it does taste like lobster. Very good. The only problem I had was my cod broke into pieces getting it out of the water. I'll work on that. Will make this many more times. thanks

This was very good and a good lobster substitute. The sugar adds just a touch of sweetness that fish doesn't have but lobster does. The one suggestion I have is to be careful not to broil the fish too long. Actually, my fillets were done after the poaching, so the broiling was only needed to add the butter flavor and the color. I rubbed the paprika on with my finger and it even had the color of lobster around the edges! Next time I will be more careful with the broiling and then I will change my rating to 5 instead of 4.

"Torsk" means "Cod" in Danish (Swedish and Norweigan too) and this is a very typical way of making it with a bit of sugar.  I thought it was just ok.  Didn't taste of much, but nor was I willing to make the butter sauce.  I just did the rest of the recipe as was instructed.

I really wanted this to taste like lobster, like most of the comments said, but it did not. It was, however, good buttered cod. The sugar water poach did give the fish a "different" taste than what I am used to, but it was pleasant, not too sweet, but not like lobster. If you like fish, give this recipe a try, but if you are looking for a lobster taste, stick with the real thing. :)

I did not read the reviews b/4 I tried this, but my son, husband and I all thought it tasted like lobster!  I did not use nearly as much butter and next time I will reduce the sugar to 3/4.  Thanks for a super easy cod loin recipe.

I am one of the few who did not care for this. My fish were waaaay too sweet for my tastes and it did NOT taste like lobster. Most other reviewers rave about this, but not me. Thanks anyway.

Tasted like lobster. Cooked as directions stated. Used Alaskan cod filets, but I didn't use all the butter... it didn't need to be dipped in it. It was very deliscious.

My family loves this recipe.  It's so super easy.  I use about half chicken broth and half water to give it more flavor.  I also use about half the sugar simply because I don't think it needs that much, tastes great without the full amount.  My kids are 6 and 8 and they just devour this.

A very interesting way of preparing Cod.  Lobsteresque in taste but it needed some flavor.  Next time I will add garlic powder, lemon and more salt before broiling and cut the butter in half.

I can't believe that such a simple recipe could produce a dish so similar to a lobster taste.   Tonight was my first time making this dish, I need to adjust my cooking times slightly next time to cook it a little less.   I would make for company.

Wow, phenomenal recipe! My swedish husband recommended trying this and it was delicious. It was also ridiculously easy. I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh cod filets instead of frozen.  Definitely saving this one. This recipe would appeal to people who are not overly crazy about fish. Oh yeah, we also thought it tasted like lobster!

Super fast and easy but this did have a sweet taste which seemed weird. Fish shouldn't be sweet. My mouth was puzzled. My hubs never said a word and he is usually the pickier diner. I used cod that was still frozen despite "thawing" in the refrigerator all day. Even though I only boiled it for barely over 3 minutes, it took a long time to get frozen fish to a boil, and then it started falling apart when I removed it and attempted to pat it dry for the last step. It was a decent dish, but we simply aren't fond of fish that hasn't been breaded in cornmeal and fried. I was trying to prepare healthy meals for us, but we both voted we'd prefer fried fish and would rather not have it at all unless it's fried. It's just a texture thing I suppose. The recipe itself was fine but neither of us compared it to lobster even "mock lobster". My husband loves lobster but this didn't make the cut for a cheap substitute even when served with the melted butter and lemon. I topped mine with plenty of squeezy lemon juice.

loved this recipe for it ease & great flavor, not much of a lobster taste unless you make a garlic butter side sauce, not fishy tasting at all. Mine never really browned much buts that's fine I didn't want it over cooked. (Tip) open a window because the smoke set off my smoke detector lol.

great recipe. very easy to make and tastes great. I always purchase cod in bulk when its on sale and this is my new go-to cod recipe. I added a little bit of garlic to the boil to give it a little something and served it with red curry brown rice.

This does taste just like lobster! followed directions except for the paprika - I used a" honey aleppo pepper" spice blend in it's place, it came out phenomenal...definitely a keeper! I think it would have been good with the paprika also.

Maybe my mistake was in using a fresh cod filet, but the boiling made it fall apart and the broiling just made it tough.  Won't be doing this one again.

This was wonderful! Made this recipe exactly how it was written. I used frozen cod loins from Sam's. I have made this twice and both times I patted the fish dry with paper towels after boiling and then put it in the fridge while I made the side dishes. One or two of the fillets broke up a little bit while boiling but I just kinda stuck it back together on the baking pan and it was fine.

We had fresh fish; reduced boiling time to 2 minutes and broiling time to 3-4 depending upon thickness.

It was good, but not quite to the 'lobster level' others encountered.  ;-)

Make sure you use the paper towels as recommended- you don't want it to be wet when you broil it.
We served it like lobster, with garlic butter.  Wonderful!

So delicious!  I love the slightly sweet taste infused in the fish.  Considering you are only boiling the fish in this sugar water, I don't know why you would use splenda.

Try this twice. Both times I use frozen cod loins instead of fillets. First time followed as written we really liked it but it was missing something. The second time I add garlic, salt, pepper, and dill to the butter .  I also followed tip from previous review to refrigerate after boiling.  I also flipped the loins over half way through broiling . It was wonderful , no leftovers.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I did not enjoy this... The fish came out very rubbery and bland.  I took heed to previous reviews, and tried to jazz it up with lemon pepper and garlic powder... It was still fairly lackluster, though.

I really enjoyed this!  I had fresh fish, so it took no time at all to cook.  I would probably add a little more salt next time, but that's likely just my taste buds. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and great tasting. I use fresh cod from the butcher for this, so I double the amount of fish because it shrinks in the boiling process. My husband goes nuts for this recipe with a side of rice pilaf. It has become a staple in our menu.

Yum! The verdict was that it didn't really taste like lobster but was absolutely delish anyhow. Even my picky son loved it. Great texture, too.

These were really good and did taste like lobster!  My only problem is that the recipe does not state how thick her filets are.  Mine were really pretty thin.  I boiled them for 2 minutes and then broiled them for just a couple more until they started sizzling and I think they were slightly overdone.  I'll know better next time but some better instructions would be good.  If I hadn't re-read the recipe I would have missed that the 8-10 minutes in the broiler was PER inch.  Mine were so thin that worked out to like a minute and a half. If I'd waited for golden brown they would have been crispy rubber.

I used hake because it was very fresh at Whole Foods, even though I thought suspected it wouldn't really be that great because it's not cod. Well, everyone agreed that this recipe made hake unbelievably lobster-like, which is what I was shooting for for a Valentine's Day dinner. I actually planned a meal around a fantastic chardonnay that needed lobster or scallops, but they were out of my price range. This recipe did my wine justice. Thank you for sharing this!

I could never cook fish. Always over-cooked it.
After trying this recipe, I went exactly by the instructions.  My husband tasted it and said"Now you can cook fish!  This is perfect...
It does taste a bit like lobster with the same texture.
It was the best fish I have ever attempted to make.

Not terribly flavorful and definitely did NOT taste like lobster, but not a bad meal. I don't think I'll make it again though. Its jut not worth the extra steps for some broiled cod.

My whole family loved this. I used Old Bay Seasoning in place of the paprika. I was shocked when both my 3 and 5 yr. olds asked for seconds. For them, I just poured some melted butter on the fish. We didn't need nearly as much as the recipe called for. This recipe was such a wonderful find.

YUM!  I made this last night and it was really good.  And it really tastes like lobster.  I only used about 5TBS of butter for 4 (4-6oz) fillets.  Instead of dipping in butter, I drizzled melted butter before serving.  I would definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used fresh cod right from the ocean. I followed the recipe and it turned out beautiful. Because the cod was so fresh, the filets didn't stay together but it didn't matter. I didn't think that it tasted like lobster, but it was definitely delicious and different.

I personally thought this recipe was great; my husband was a little bit on the fence because he would have preferred more flavor. However, he's not a huge fish-eater, whereas I can appreciate a dish where the flavor of the fish is allowed to shine. I could see where someone might find it a tad bland (I prepared it exactly as written except for using two fillets versus six). The texture was definitely tough using frozen fillets; I'm not sure if this was due to the preparation method or due to our particular fillets. I won't hesitate to make this again, but I might go a little more heavy on the paprika and sprinkle salt on the fillets as they cool after broiling to bring out more flavor. Thanks for sharing!

It was good.  Really tasted like Lobster tail broiled with butter.  I did broil it a bit to long, so don't make that mistake.

Super easy - broiled them in the toaster oven and they came out perfect.  Did not need as much butter as the recipe called for.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Since I am the only one in the house that will eat fish, I scaled it down to one piece and I didn't use very much butter. I also used splenda and it worked fine. It definitely reminded me of lobster...I will make again!

I recently made this recipe since I had some Alaskan cod filets and wasn't sure what to do with them.  I was surprised at how good this was - seemed rather simple and I wasn't expecting much but it was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again!

took a while for the water mixture to boil. i think this is why my cod turned out overcooked.  otherwise, the flavor was very lobster-like in my opinion!

Neither my husband nor I care much for cod even though we love many other kinds of fish and seafood.  I bought some frozen Pacific cod filets recently in hope that it was different from Atlantic cod but was disappointed to find out online that it is similar.  Since I had it, I went in search of a recipe that would overcome our objections.  When I found this one, I just had to make it since it was supposed to taste like lobster.  We were surprised to discover that cod prepared this way really does resemble lobster.  I loved it, hence the five stars, but true to form, he was still hung up on the fact that it was cod.  Too bad.  I am going to prepare this again and again anyway because cod is a healthy fish and this is a great recipe.  For his sake, I said I wouldn't cook it too often.   As for how the recipe works to make cod taste like lobster, I assume it is how the sugar and the two kinds of preparation work together.  I just hope the sugar doesn't affect the healthy aspect of the fish too much.  I followed the recipe, using the lesser time range for the boiling and broiling.  Next time I will try reducing the time just a bit since I think the fish got a bit overcooked and my husband thinks that was a drawback.  I think I made two mistakes: I didn't bring the sugar water and cod to a boil fast enough and the fillets I had may have been just under an inch thick (I eyeballed them  and thought they were about an inch).  Thanks to DHERDEBU for posting this wonderful recipe!

This taste excellent! The only thing to warn other home chefs is that the butter may smoke under the broiler heat. Turn on a fan, open a window, then proceed with the recipe.

Exceptional recipe. Thanks DHERDEBU. The texture and definitely lobster taste are there, and I’m not a fan of lobster.  I have followed the direction exactly. I have grilled and broiled it with the same great result, just stay more toward the 3 min that the 5 (to be on the safe side) still it has to be cooked again. Now I will try it with less sugar or agave nectar and way less butter. I have paired up with fresh grilled veggies and a fresh coleslaw. I will take and upload a photo next time I do it. Definitely this will be a dish that I will keep on repeating.

Ugh.  I was so excited to try this recipe and I was so disapointed.  The cod turned out rubbery and dried out on the top- very strange.

We eat this EVERY week ever since we discovered it.  Both my husband and my two year old devour it as it if they may never see food again.

I often omit the sugar and no one notices.  If I do use something to sweeten it, I use agave nectar.

Update.  We still eat this often!  My children are now 18m and 4.  I use butter substitutes and omit the sugar with no noticeable difference.  We love it!

My review is a 4 star but my husband gives it 5.  He loved that the fish had a slight consistency and taste of lobster but I thought that it was a little too tough.  I will def make again and try it with thicker pieces of fish.

Wow! So few ingredients to make a delicious  meal.  I was surprised at how the sugar/salt poaching gave cod a delicate sweet flavor...I did reduce the sugar to a half a cup.  It truly did have the texture and flavor of lobster.  What a great find.

I agree with the other reviewers that the butter and sugar can be cut down without changing the taste of the fish. I have a sweet tooth, but found it much too sweet for my likely; it also had an artificial sweetness to it that did not agree with me. Overall I thought it was okay, but gave it a 4 because it was quick and easy to prepare.

This was excellent - the sugar water makes the fish sweet, and dipped in the butter, it really does taste like lobster.  Definitely a keeper!  And easy, too.

Just made this and I loved it!  I used Splenda instead of sugar for boiling.  I then used Pam Butter spray and 1 small pat of butter on 3 fillets when broiling.  when browned I sprayed the pieces with 'I Can't Believe it's not Butter' fat free spray.  I really enjoyed it and could taste the resemblance to lobster.  I'm sure using melted butter would make it taste even better, but watching my fats.  It was still very, very good. I just used the fat free spray while eating instead of dunking it in melted butter.   I will make this again!

This was ok.  In my opinion it was very bland and didn't taste a thing like lobster.  I think this would be better with a little lemon.  It definitely needs something.

This really did taste like lobster tail. I was impressed. Had a hard time keeping the fish from falling to pieces in the boiling water, so when it was laid out on the cookie sheet, it looked a mess, but I actually think it made it extra good because there were more crispy edges. Hubby doesn't eat fish and liked it too, but said it was rich.

We did not care for this recipe at all.
It was too watery and why would you soak it in sugar? It gave a very noticible sweet taste.  Woudn't make it again, Prefer nutted baked or deep fried.

Very good--tastes subtle and doesn't cover the mild flavor of the cod.  Will definitely make this again!

I thought this was good.  Very quick and easy.  My husband doesn't like fish unless its fried and he really liked this.  We thought it had a very slight resemblance to lobster, as other reviewers had stated.  Will make again, but with much less butter next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! Be careful not to over-cook, as the ends of the fish get quite chewy.

This was absolutely delicious! It came out a lot better than I was expecting. I served it with a onion rice pilaf and veggies which complimented it very well. Even my husband, who isn't a very big fish eater, thought this was great. I agreed with some of the other reviewers that it had a lobster taste.. My husband didn't quite think so but again, still thought it was great!

I used orange roughy instead of cod.  It was very easy and I think that it would work well with just about any white fish.  I plan to use this method of cooking fish again.

This is a great tasting way to cook fish, especially if you don't like a really strong fishy taste!!!  I cooked it for my boyfriend and even though it turned rubbery (our broiler heats too hot) it was still great!!  it is almost fool-proof!

For me this just tasted like fish with sugar. Many years ago there was a recipe that made the rounds for using monkfish and some seasonings and caraway seeds which was excellent. Unfortunately I lost it and haven’t been able to find anything like it in the years since. At least I was only feeding myself and not anybody else

Really enjoyed this! The only thing I did was take the suggestion  of putting it in the fridge after boiling. Made it with a side of brown rice and mascarpone cauliflower mashers. The flavors I used just melded well together with this recipe.

Delicious. 
Next time I will do as another suggested by heating up the water first to a boil, turn down, add fish. Mine cooked too fast bringing it to a boil. 
The flavor was fantastic but I was also sold on the minimal ingredients, minimal dishes & minimal time. Huge plus.

I used thawed, frozen cod.  I was a little worried about boiling first, but when my meal was completed it was delicious!  Tasted very much like lobster.  Since I only had unsalted butter, I added a little garlic salt to the butter.  It is, like lobster, fairly rich and we found we couldn't finish all of it!  I'll make this again whenever we have cod!

This does have the texture of lobster tail and it has a taste similar to it as well. I assume it's from the first step of boiling in salt and sugar water. ( I did this in the morning to make dinner more quickly) I then dried and chilled it until dinnertime.  My husband LOVED it! And he usually likes fried fish:) So, I would make this again, but probably not all the time as I think it's probably not as healthy as plain broiled cod with pepper and lime juice. I did use a little less butter than called for and it was plenty-(I used a half stick) we even had some leftover. (we also added garlic to the butter)

A solid 4 stars. I added a little bit of lemon zest, but made it by the recipe other than that (scaled down to two). Great taste, good texture.

This recipe was soaked in butter and sugar, so maybe not any healthier, but it was deliciously different.  It had a unique flavor and firm texture that we all liked, including my picky 6 year old.  I used a lot less butter, probably only 2-3 tablespoons, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

I was actually a little skeptical about cod tasting like lobster ... So of course I had to try it for myself.  The recipe was simple and quick.  The taste was amazing.  I have to say that it was pretty darn close to lobster.  I prepared the cod as posted with no alterations and it was perfect.  I cannot see myself making fish any other way.

Made almost as per the recipe.  Couple reviews said it was bland so I added onion powder to the melted butter and the poaching water.  Absolutely delicious.  Just be careful not to poach for too long.

This was just okay. I cooked it as the recipe directed and ended up with the fish falling apart after the boiling.  Some other reviews state that this tastes like lobster. I didn't get that vibe, instead I think it tasted like egg.

Wonderful taste - very similar to lobster.  I did reduce the butter, and added just a touch of garlic blend seasoning, with smoked paprika.  Great alternative to deep fried battered cod.

My husband said it was the BEST fish he ever ate,  we like to vacation near the ocean so we have eaten a lot of fish, he says it is even better than lobster. I found this very easy to prepare, my fish pieces were quite thick and I found broiling them for 5 minutes was perfect.

It's true - it tastes just like lobster! I found the fish very flavorful, and didn't need to add anything else to it at all. The first time I made it (with cod), we didn't even use melted butter - we were enjoying the fish on its own so much we didn't even think of adding anything else. The second time I made it, I used frozen swai fillets instead of cod, and it also turned out great and lobster-like. I'm excited to use this recipe whenever I want to cook white fish with what I've already got in the house.

Used fresh cod. dropped filets into hot water mixture for only about 1 min. Broiled with butter and added garlic. Adjusted broiling time to the thickness of filets.

The best fish I ever had! It didn't really remind me of lobster, but did remind me of scallops. I cut the sugar in half, and used a lot less butter - just brushed a little on the torsk before broiling it. There's only so much butter you can put on the fish. Don't thaw the fish or you'll overcook it. I've never been good at cooking fish, but this was truly amazing - and easy. Cheap too. I'm going to try substituting frozen salmon in this recipe.

Kudos to the author of the recipe - it really does taste somewhat like lobster! I appreciated not having to defrost the fish to make this recipe. Especially on a weeknight. On the first go-around: (1) I halved the butter and sugar amount (2) used homemade chicken broth (3) did not use foil. Next time, I will most likely cut down the butter and sugar by 1/3 or 1/4 to make it a bit healthier. Cooking it in the broth made it taste extra flavorful. And I think not using the foil resulted in a slightly drier fish.

This was good - the family liked it. However, I won't bother with it again. I live in Nova Scotia, where fish is a staple food and lobster is abundant. My observations are (1) This tastes nothing like lobster, and (2) There are many far more delicious, straightforward ways to prepare fish.

I used cod loins and followed the directions without alterations. The fish's texture was lovely and firm, and I appreciated how the sugar/salt subtly amped up the flavor of the fish itself. However, it wasn't enough flavor, and the fish was really bland. I would make this again, but I'll double the salt and add some whole aromatics to the simmering liquid with the fish - maybe some garlic, shallot, and I bet dill and/or tarragon would be nice. I also found that I used about half the  butter than the recipe called for, but I think it's because I used loins rather than fillets.

Nice way to use frozen cod.  Served it with mashed potatoes and the whole family loved it, even the young kids.  After seeing reviews about it being bland, I added some extra salt to the melted butter before brushing it on.  And I really slathered those fillets up, did not hold back.  The broil time was less than indicated for me, so I'd suggest checking it after the first 4 minutes.  Mine was done in about 6.  I also suggest brushing a bit more butter on as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Really tasty and, yes, slightly reminiscent of broiled lobster.  Adding this to my rotation.

We loved this - we used cod fillets that were a little on the thin side.  I did not boil them, I just brought them up to simmer till they were opaque and then took them out. After patting them dry I gave them a little shmear of garlic paste, then drizzled with butter and sprinkled with seafood seasoning.  Broiling was shorter because they were thin, and they turned out awesome!  Delicious!  The family loved it, thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times now, always with just one cod loin since I'm the only one in my family that will eat fish.  When you scale to 1 serving, don't worry too much about the sugar water proportions.  You will need the water to cover the fish, so just put in enough to cover then eyeball the sugar to get the ratio about the same as the recipe calls for.  This is super easy to make for one person, it goes very quickly so I'm not slaving over 2 meals.  It does NOT taste like lobster, but it does taste like very un-fishy, buttery, delicious fish.  Before I serve, I usually flake the fish apart in the dish I broiled it in to pick up all the delicious browned butter from the pan.  Really good, thanks for the recipe.  I never would have come up with this one on my own!

I just made this and it was so, so easy and delicious. After broiling I added a little Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning for kick and fresh dill. It did taste a little like lobster. Really neat! I can't wait to make this again.

This was fast, easy to make and tasty.  Started with frozen fish.  Followed the recipe just as directed but reduced the amount of butter to 7 T (which was plenty to baste on and also use at the table).  Poached/boiled for 3 min and broiled for 8 (which was nearly too long). I have to say that it didn't taste like lobster to us although I hoped it would.  The fish had a slightly sweet taste to it, which was nice.  I'll make it again and I think I might try an herb butter next time.

My family just loved this! My 14 year old daughter had 3 helpings! I'm on my hcg diet ( www.discoverhcg.net) and I have to eat lots of fatty foods on the first two days and this was perfect and delicious! Tastes just like lobster. Be sure to not overcook or it will dry out, even with all that butter.

LOVE this recipe!!!  And it tasted just like lobster to me.  My kids said it tasted like crab, but I don't think they have ever tried lobster before.  The whole family loved it!!  I needed to use up a frozen bag of cod that I had in my freezer and now I can't wait to go back to the store to buy more frozen cod!!  Only problem....(my fault) was I overcooked a little bit...I broiled it for 8 minutes, opened my oven and it was beginning to smoke!  I think I had the temp too high.  Next time I'll turn the broiler down a bit and check it before 8 min.  It still turned out great though....didn't seem to have too much effect on the fish except for a little on the dry side.  This recipe is definately a keeper in my house!!

I don't know what I did wrong with this, but I just didn't care for it.  I was only cooking for 2, so I reduced the water, sugar and salt accordingly, but I had to add quite a bit of extra water because the fillets were so thick.  I reduced the boiling time a little.  The fillets were falling apart when I transferred them to the baking sheet, and broiling them for 10 minutes, even topped with butter, seemed to dry them out completely.  I know some people have compared it to lobster, but I sure couldn't taste it.  Maybe by using so much water, I diluted the sugar/salt mixture to the point where it was useless?

I had high hopes for this dish, and followed it exactly (despite reservations).  I should have followed my instincts!  The fish was so dry and overcooked, it was nearly inedible.  My kids refused to eat it, and they love all kinds of fish cooked nearly every way.  I will give it another try (I really want the same fish all the 5 star reviewers ate!), but will drastically reduce cooking time, both in the water AND out.

My family requests this dish on a regular basis.  It is a refreshing change from breaded and/or fried fish.  

As many other reviewers have suggested, I also decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup, the salt to 1.5 Tbsp, and the butter to 4 Tbsp.

Thank you for posting this delicious recipe for all of us to enjoy :0)

This recipe is amazing! Everyone had seconds and asked for the recipe. I skipped the paprika because I didn't have any and it tasted great!

Very good flavor and easy to make. I only used about half the butter, and it still seemed like too much. My fillets were only about a half inch thick at the thickest part, so maybe that had something to do with it. It was still very delicious. My husband really liked it too.

I made it using sunfish fillets and it was delicious. I only needed 1/2 the butter and since sunfish fillets are so small I broiled them fore 3-4 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

I need to make more next time! I made it slightly healthier by using less sugar (and I think I can even go down more next time) and didn't use nearly as much butter as it said to. I also added pepper and parsley before I broiled it.

Made this for the 1st time for Good Friday supper...WOW. My partner and I both loved it. I used fresh filets, but, also found they fell apart. Next time I will try cod loins and just poach them. Will DEFINITELY make this often. Thank you for the recipe!!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit.  After his first bite, my husband exclaimed, "This tastes just like lobster!"  My 6 yr. old who likes fish went back for seconds and my 4 yr. old who does not like fish, actually ate some.  I added a little bit of onion powder on top while broiling, but other than that, as written.  Delicious and a definite keeper!  Thanks!

It is hard to get my family to eat fish on a regular basis.  This recipe solves all that.  I made it exactly as directed and the only complaint I got was that I hadn't made enough!  I'm a fast learner so next time I'll double the recipe!

good. i didn't add enough paprika, so was a little lacking in flavor, might try some more spices next time--basics like garlic, etc.

My family liked the recipe, but without the chive butter I made it seemed overdone. I think I will try again - and cut down on the time the fish is in the water solution.

The fish filets totally fell apart and there was no way to get these to broil as an actual filet.   I threw the fish away and could not imagine what would have happened if I actually broiled it.  Will never make this again.

I didn't experience the lobster taste.  Also, too much butter - I halfed it and it was still too buttery and I love butter!

Sorry to go against the consensus, but I did not like this at all...  I made it this afternoon to have something firm for a fish pot pie type thing, and I'm really glad I got to chop it up and mix it with other things...  This was dry and pretty tasteless.  Did not remind me of lobster in any way except the firmness of the fish.  I won't be making this again.  It's too bad, because I love cod.  There are much better recipes out there for it.

Amazing!  This recipe is so easy, and it really does taste like lobster.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used frozen cod fillets from BJ's.  My kids ate fish and liked it for the first time.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I used perch because it was half the price of cod. After boiling, it fell apart into small pieces. But it was very tasty - even my daughter who dislikes fish said it was good! We didn't need that much butter to dip in - next time I'll use about half as much.

Easy preparation & tasty.  I had never heard of preparing fish this way, and even though reviews were good, it took we quite a while to try the recipe.  Glad I did...
Thanks, Dee.

This was good.  A bit of lobster texture, but the taste was delicious.  I used 1/2 Splenda for cooking & 1/2 sugar, but it was still a bit sweet for me.  I'll cut down further on the sugar/Splenda next time.

Good stuff!  I did panic and only use 1/2 cup of sugar.  I can't imagine it would need more than that.  Deserves repeat business in my book!

Just some FYI. Torsk is actually a fish from the North Atlantic. Yet, this recipe is DELICIOUS!  The first time I made this, I had 3 phone calls for the recipe. Thank You!!

I had really high hopes for this as I read all the reviews.  Being from Florida, I love lobster but this fell short.  It was an okay way to cook fish, but wasn't very similar to lobster other than the butter (I do love butter!)Sorry

It was OK, it was a bit more work than I wanted and it didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked.

Wow!  We loved this!  I had high hopes for this recipe, and ws not disappointed.  My husband and I both thought it had a "lobster-like" taste.  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the post Dee!

The flavor on this was great, and it was quick and easy!  The only problem I had was the fish seemed a little dry to me...I will try this again though.  Tasty!

Excellent recipe - easy, quick, and very tasty. One to keep as a standard way to cook cod.

This was great tasting fish, but a little time consuming. My husband and I enjoyed it, but none of my kids liked it.

I thought this had a small similarity to lobster but my boyfriend did not think so.  We both liked this and will make again.
