This recipe is wonderful but the proportions for the shopping list are completely off. I don't know why the shopping list says 6 limes when the recipe calls for 1 or 230 cardamom pods when the recipe only calls for 2 tabelspoons.... now I have to figure out what to do with all of these leftover cardamom pods and limes...

This recipe has been a bigger adventure than I anticipated. As I type my hands are covered in yellow as if a highlighter exploded all over them from cutting up tumeric root. I had never done that before. Nor had I toasted anise or cinnamon or even seen cardamom pods. Which is why I love this recipe.
One thing that confused me was the toasted coconut. I realized mine was sweetened, so I went back to the store where my only other option was a whole coconut. My boyfriend had to hatchet it open for me, and I'm sure there's a better way to shred and toast it than what I did. It looked a bit like an episode of Lucy.
I had a tough time getting the curry paste to become a paste. My blender's motor was struggling, so I ended up adding almost a cup of water. Plus is ended up a little gritty, so make sure to blend better than I did.
But overall this was a fun thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. I delivered some to friends and they raved about it. I'm so glad I tried it! Thanks Azalina!

I made this about a month and a half ago and it turned out really good. I did have to make some adjustments but overall the recipes turned out yummy. It does take a long time to prep so, if you are making this dish prep everything first which makes the cooking process easier.

This great gathering of spices really add together to make one of the best curries I've ever had. Stunningly good aroma and taste. Thank you for sharing a wonderful outlet for fresh mint. Instead of a blender, I used a small kitchen bullet processor and had to add almost a cup of water to handle the coconut and spices. A full size blender probably wouldn't  need extra though.

Very authentic and rewarding to make. Enjoy each step!! I added a bit more coconut milk to soften the spiciness. Really yummy with white rice or naan! Enjoy!

I couldnâ€™t find star anise anywhere so that was left out, and I used twice the chicken and coconut milk because I was feeding a large family of hungry people. This recipe takes a long time and a lot of work and it rewards your tastebuds with delicious bangs of flavors and spices!

Really has amazing flavor! I followed everything as is except I used unsweetened flaked coconut instead of fresh, a white onion instead of shallots, and coconut oil instead of peanut. I also emitted the fennel seed because I am not a fan. Prep and cooking time definitely follows as stated. If I would make again I would substitute the coconut oil for ghee and take out the coconut entirely. My food processor and blender couldn't puree the coconut fine enough and I ended up having a semi-chunky/chewy curry due to the coconut. Fresh coconut may process better. Due to the flaked coconut and other dry ingredients I also had to add 2-3 cups of water to the blender. I actually used the chili water in addition to tap water. I was iffy about adding the lime and mint at the end because the curry had such great flavor, but the addition of both ingredients really brings out other flavor notes. In terms of veggies, I might also consider adding potatoes or peas next time. Will make again when I have the time!
