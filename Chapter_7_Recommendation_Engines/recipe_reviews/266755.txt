This is my recipe. 

As far as baking the brownies, I've always used a metal pan, so am not sure how the directions should be modified for a glass pan (although the other commenter had no trouble). I'll add to the baking instructions and say that you should bake them until the edges begin to brown and the center seems pale. I take them out when they seem not fully cooked in the center. They set up while cooling. This is the way to be sure they are soft and delicious. Please try them again, taking them out of the oven at the point where the edges are done but the center seems to not be quite done.

It's good, and my coworkers agree, but there's no way that this is a brownie. It's a slab cookie or cookie bar, depending on where you grew up. The only change I made was to use mini chips in the base, and striped white chocolate/dark chocolate chips on top to be more decorative.

I tried to make these following the recipe exactly.  I think there may be an error in the ingredients - 2 Tablespoons of vanilla is an awful lot for this kind of recipe - but that is what I used.  I wonder if it is meant to be 2 teaspoons.  I also tried to cook the bars in my 9x13 inch glass dish at 325 degrees for just 22 minutes, as directed, but it was still rather wet at 22 minutes.  I ended up baking it for 37 minutes to get a light golden brown.  I took the bars out of the oven at that point to try to avoid over-baking.  Not sure I succeeded.  My bars seem rather crumbly and are sticking to the dish.  The bars taste okay, but are not the texture I was hoping for based on the pictures.  The finished bars are much closer to an oatmeal cookie than a chocolate chip cookie.

This recipe gets bonus points for how easy it is to throw together.  I had to cook it a total of 28 minutes for it to be done (and my oven runs hot).  And they turned out pretty good.  I'm not sure I love the oatmeal texture - they are a little too "oatie", but they're not bad.  I would probably make them again just because of how easy this recipe is.  (PS - I used parchment paper, let them cool in the pan and then pulled them out by the paper - super easy to cut and nothing stuck to the pan.)

4.5 stars.  I made these as written except used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats due to what I had on hand.  The next time I plan to add chopped nuts.  I like that they were quick using ingredients that I usually keep on hand.

I made the recipe exactly as shows... I sprayed the dish (glass) with cooking spray and baked in convection oven for 22 mins at 350 degrees.  No sticking, cooked perfectly.  Tastes fantastic!

This one’s a keeper.  You don’t even taste the oatmeal since it’s quite chewy.  I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips. 1/2 with the dough and 1/2 as topping. I think 2 cups is a bit too much.

4.5  I just made these today and, so far so good!  I couldn't wait and tried them while still warm!  I cooked them in a glass pan and probably added 3-5 more minutes.  They seemed soft in the middle which is fine, but I don't like the idea of not cooking the eggs not cooking completely.  Most of these are part of a Father's Day gift and to use as a dipper with chocolate fondue.  Also, I really wish I had remembered to buy milk chocolate chips and had to make do with semi-sweet chips.  I also, in part of the batter, added different types of chips (mini, dark chocolate, and sea salt caramel.)  Great recipe :)

These were good, a nice change from the same-ol cookie/bar, and relatively simple to make.  A hit with the family to boot.
