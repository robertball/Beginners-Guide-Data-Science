I prepared this for supper last night and my husband and I loved it, it is a definite keeper. I enjoy trying new recipes that contain winter vegies and I couldn't have been more pleased with this. The flavors of the rub meld so wonderfully together and had a nice little bite to it. I will definitely be making this one for the extended family.

This tasted really good, but I cut the root vegetables too large and they remained firm after I roasted them. I made the following changes: I marinated the lamb leg for 4 hours before roasting, I poured the excess marinade into the root vegetables and mixed them until they were all coated. I left the lamb in a bit longer with the oven off, it was medium done and more rare on the bottom. Next time I would try putting the leg on its own baking dish half-way through and covering the vegetables with a lid so that they would soften. I would also cut the vegetables into smaller pieces.

We are military family and live in Germany and could not get a leg of lamb, so I substituted a 4lb Ribeye Roast.  Allowed the roast to marinate while I boiled the vegetables for 20 minutes, added an extra sweet potato, (no yams or white potatoes in the house at the moment).  Only put in 2 parsnips but added 2 cups of brussel sprouts to give it color.  Also added an onion when boiling to add flavor and topped off with some mushrooms as I was putting it into the oven.  Everyone thought it was fabulous.

made this yesterday and it was the best lamb I've ever eaten. the roast was sooo tender. I mixed the leftover rub into the veggies in the roaster since I was afraid there wouldnt be enough flavour on them. I made several small changes to the recipe; I used .5 tsp of cayenne pepper rather than the red pepper flakes (.33 would have been plenty), I used dry rosemary since I couldnt get any fresh, I cut the veggies into cubes rather than wedges, I reduced the heat from 400 after 20 minutes to 350 and stirred every 25 minutes or so, and I let it sit for 10 minutes at the end. I was delighted with the outcome! I'll definately be cooking this again! Deliciousness!

This was great, real easy and by mistake I poured the marinade over the root vegetables and mixed that up then placed the 5 lb boneless lamb leg which also had been rubbed with the marinade and placed it all in the oven to bake for 135minutes for medium lamb, smelled great and tasted great.  I also used some golden beets as one of the root vegetables.

This turned out absolutely perfect. We had a fairly small roast, so I was glad I didn't wait the full 90 minutes, but went by the meat thermometer. Plus, I had drizzled the extra rub on the veggies before putting it all in the oven and it was sooo good. None leftover, I'm afraid. Next time we'll have to get a bigger roast!

This was so good! Based on the instructions exactly as written, I should probably lower my rating a bit, but the marinade was so amazing that I will definitely look forward to preparing this again. I used a 4 pound leg of lamb and cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and then only 45 minutes at 325 to get my roast to an internal temperature of 130 degrees. However, the root vegetables took much longer even though I was careful to cut them small. After removing and tenting the roast, I cranked up the temperature on the oven to 375 degrees for an additional hour to finish the vegetables. My only other slight change was adding a chopped onion to the vegetables and also pouring my remaining marinade over them during baking. It all turned out delicious.

This was a great recipe that I will definitely look to make again.  It is also versatile in terms of what root vegetables you use and I was able to use nearly all of the winter veggies in my farm sharm for the week (butternut squash, potates, turnips, beets, and kale).

The veggies did not really work well for us. They lacked flavor; although the lamb was very nice.

I used a lamb roast instead of a leg of lamb. Cooked the 3 lb roast on bed of carrots, beets, and onion quarters. 400 degrees for 75 minutes yielded a well-done roast. Will reduce the cooking time for a rarer roast next time. Made mashed potatoes on the side and an incredible gravy from the pan drippings. The gravy was somewhat sweet from the beet and carrot juices.

We are huge lamb eaters in our house and this is by far one of my favorite dishes. My recommendation is to err on the side of cooking for a shorter period of time as we have over cooked the lamb a few times.

I used this recipe for rack of lamb, adding the lamb to the oven halfway through at the 25 minutes mark, and it was fantastic. I did not lower the temperature, cooking at 450 F the entire time.  I had plenty of sauce left over after putting it on the lamb so I mixed the sauce with the root vegetables prior to cooking. I will definitely be making this sauce again.  My boyfriend actually doesn't like lamb or cooked vegetables. Even this recipe could not overcome his aversion to lamb but he did eat the vegetables and told me the outside of the lamb tasted so good until it tasted like lamb. It's a start.

This was great. I didn't have turnips, but had parsnips so used them and they were wonderful. My family used to raise sheep so was able to enjoy many times and this was very close to how my mom made. I did use a crockpot as wanted to try that way and turned out very good. I had enough left overs for 3 meals (my roast was 3.2 #'s) and the rest went to a family of five and my friend made up some rise to go with it and they also loved it. Will be using again. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! The marinade was enough to add to the vegetables in the bottom of the pan. I used potatoes , chopped onions,carrots, and a sliced fennel bulb. I added a half bottle of Greek olives from Trader Joes( all I had left). I also added some fresh thyme to the pan with the marinade. My family and friends loved it and took doggie bags home.
