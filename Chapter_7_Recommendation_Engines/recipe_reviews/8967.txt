This was really good. I tweaked it just a bit. Instead of sprinkling the seasoning on the chicken, I mixed it in with some olive oil in a bowl, then brushed it on both sided of the chicken before cooking. Came out wonderful. My picky kids ate it up and asked for seconds!

The clasic Hungarian dish uses much more paprica (a quarter cup if you believe it) as well as garlic, and tomato paste. This is not quite the same as a gulash, but it's too weak for my taste.

This is a great heart healthy recipe, i added a little extra seasoning such as, more papriks and some garlic powder.  It turned out very yummy, very low in salt and fat. Good for anyone tring to watch both because of heart problems.

I had to triple the paprika and use four cloves of real garlic (not powder!) to make it taste seasoned.

Delicious! I added some salt and 2 cloves of garlic on top of the powder to give it some more flavour, and it turned out absolutely great.

quite bland. This is just chicken with a little dry spice.

Depending on the Hungarian or Austrian region, chicken paprikas is made with a sauce containing tomato or sour cream and also onions.

I mixed the spices with olive oil and rubbed it on the chicken, which seemed to work a little better, also added more paprika.

I used more Paprika as some of the review suggested.  However, I think I overdid it.  Next time I will use a little less.  I also used a few tablespoons of Olive oil.

The paprika chicken was outstanding. I added chili powder to give it a kick. Highly recommend.

This is definitely a keeper. I tried it for dietary reasons. Moist and flavorful. Ten minutes in I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth. I only made 2 breasts and used a square baking dish. Served with steamed broccoli. Brought calories in under 250 calories!!

Made this for dinner and everyone loved it! I did twist the recipe to a marinade instead of sprinkling the Paprika. I also added real garlic. But this was very good and would make it again

So delicious, I think I died and went to heaven!

I only made one chicken breast, so I baked at 350Â° for 30 minutes. Added seasoning 20 minutes in, just sprinkled each one separately and eyeballed the amounts (lots of paprika and garlic). Awesome!
