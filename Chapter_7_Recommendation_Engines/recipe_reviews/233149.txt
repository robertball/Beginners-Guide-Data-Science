I had some leftover Velveeta and I was intrigued by this. However - I knew I had to change a few of the instructions - I heated the butter and cheese in a pan and melted them together. I then added the powdered milk - because if you don't do this - the little milk powder granules will not dissolve. If you want it with a little more chocolate flavor - I would throw in a handful of milk chocolate chips at this point. I already had the rest of the ingredients in my stand mixer - and just added the hot melted cheese mixture by using a metal measuring cup until it was all in my mixer. You know - if you think about Velveeta being in this - I guess you can sense the texture etc....when you taste it - but it was oddly addictive and before I put it in a pan - I was putting a dollop on a strawberry - and it was pretty good. I lined a glass pan with parchment paper - put the fudge in - then (since it was only lukewarm at this point) - put some clingwrap directly on the fudge and smoothed it out with my hand. This isn't a candy store worthy type of candy - but it was sort of fun to fix - although I would never fix it without heating some of the ingredients - as I detailed above. It is strange yummy and oddly addictive - I'm not sure what others would think of it if you gave it to them to try and didn't tell them what the "secret" ingredient was. Go ahead and try this once - just for fun - don't expect 5-star truffles and you won't regret it?!?!?!?!?
