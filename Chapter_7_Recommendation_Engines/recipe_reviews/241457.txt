Excellent! Thanks ScoGold for sharing. What an original and healthy recipe! I put some feta goat cheese and ate it with red quinoa (Kaniwa). Tempeh in curry taste so great with the kale! WOAW! I am always looking for new tempeh recipes to try.... This is one of my best!

This was yummy but I had to add about 1/2 cup vegetable broth to get the kale to be the right consistency.
