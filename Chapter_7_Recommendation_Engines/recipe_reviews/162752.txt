I had spaghetti sauce and meatballs leftovers, so decided to make a meatball sub.  I heated up the meatballs and sauce, put on a lightly oven toasted hoagie roll, (brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder), added mozzarella cheese to the top, and melted it in the microwave.  It is very quick and easy.  With leftover meatballs, I think it only took about 5 mins!

This was a great easy sandwich. I used about 1 cup of sauce and just spread it on the bottom of the bread and then topped with homemade meatballs fresh from the oven and cheese. Fast, easy, and delicious. This was a great quick meal.

This was a great addition to my recipie box. My husband and kids loved the taste. And I loved how easy it is! Sometimes I'll add 1/2 tsp of Liquid Smoke to change the taste a bit.

Used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. One of our family's new favorites.

Just as advertised, quick and easy. Worked perfect for a Daytona 500 Party.
