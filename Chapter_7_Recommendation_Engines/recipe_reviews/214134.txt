Even tho no one in my family really likes canned peas, I was intrigued by this recipe.  I used white wine vinegar, chives, basil and parsley.  Sooo good!

Taste testing the dressing - I thought that it had a tad too much vinegar (and thought that next time I should cut the vinegar by half) but once drizzled over the Tomatoes and Cheese -- It was Delicious! No need to alter the recipe.

I used frozen petite pois instead and garlic mayo as I do not use buttermilk much. I only had white balsamic viniger and it worked really well.  For my herb I used corriander and flat leave parsley.Very nice,will make again as it was so easy and a nice change for a tomato/avacado salad. Thanks for sharing this  receipe!!

This was good and very interesting. The dressing complemented the veggies very well. I used frozen peas, goat milk, and parsley, and I omitted the cheese. I tossed everything with salad greens. I think mint and/or basil would be great herbs to use.
