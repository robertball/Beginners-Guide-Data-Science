Well first let me say that I was really looking forward to making this recipe. I couldn't wait till morning so I could make it for breakfast.  I love the taste of swiss cheese and swiss cheese french toast sounded delicious.

Well the bad news. I followed the directions exactly and what I ended up with was a crusty burnt tasting french toast.

But all is not at a loss. The problem is that swiss cheese placed on a buttered skillet basically burns even at medium to low heat.  What I am going to do from now on is cook the french toast first with the egg, milk and chive mixture and melt the swiss cheese on top. Basically the same but without the cheese burning. I think this should work. and still be cheesy french toast.

I made changes. Sorry, I didn't have tomato or chutney. Used 1/3 of the swiss cheese in the milk/egg/chive mixture. When I flipped them I sprinkled some cheese over the top. When done I added chopped deli ham, more chives, green onions & more cheese. This was fantastic! I served these with Zucchini and onion pancakes (submitted by Carol). Yummy

These were really very good but after reading the other reviews I opted to not put the cheese in the egg mixture - besides it would be hard to evenly distribute the cheese. I would suggest using 1 T butter and 1 T oil (I used grade seed oil) instead of all butter. I cooked one side on medium heat, flipped them over topped with the shredded cheese and when the bottom was done I flipped them over again to toast the cheese. I didn't have tomato chutney so I made up a tomato / green onion / white onion and chives. Really a nice meal.

This was tasty, but a little on the greasy side.  We used a mini baguette and served them bite-sized.
