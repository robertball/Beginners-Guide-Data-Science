This turned out a little too "dark chocolate" for me.  I learned quickly if the mixture is not timed carefully and it boils in the microwave, you will end up with a grainy texture.  I remade it with milk chocolate chips and walnuts, it was wonderful.  I sprayed the pan with oil, lined it with foil, coated that in butter and then poured in the mixture.  When cooled, I pulled the foil right out, put it on the cutting board and used the pizza cutter to make perfect squares.  I took the so-so first batch to work and kept the 2nd for myself.  :)

I just had to update my review.  I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and just want to share a couple of my favorite variations.  I half the completed mixture prior to adding the nuts, then in half the batch I add coconut either 1/2 cup to 1 cup (the more you put in, the more it tastes like an almond joy), and the other half I'll put half the nuts and a handful of chopped candied cherries.  So good!

This is such an easy and great tasting fudge recipe. To make it easier, I lined the 8X8 dish with aluminum foil. That way, when the fugde has hardened, you can lift it straight up out of the baking dish, and makes for easier cutting. Also, be sure to press melted chocolate down in dish. My fudge came out with some air bubbles. Still tasted awesome though.

Great, easy fudge recipe.  To prevent a grainy texture, pre-melt the butter, then add the chips and milk, stir, then microwave for 30 second intervals and keep stirring.  Takes 3 minutes to make, max!!!

This fudge was very easy to prepare and tasted very creamy and good.  I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chips and 2 cups of milk chocolate chips and the fudge was still pretty dark.  Next time I will use all milk chocolate chips or maybe even try 2 cups of milk chocolate and l cup of white chocolate.  It certainly is a keeper.

Wow, this is SO much better than it has any right to be! Is it exactly the same as classic double-boiler-and-candy-thermometer fudge? Not quite, but it's delicious and foolproof...and you can go from the idea of fudge to a tray cooling in your fridge in 10 minutes flat. 2 important tips:

1. Use salted butter. That pinch of salt is essential to the flavor balance.

2. The fudge will only be as good as the chocolate you use. Pay the extra buck for Ghirardelli instead of Nestle and the result will be VASTLY superior.

Loved this fudge. I used 1C. bittersweet, 2C. semisweet and an extra TBS of real sweet cream butter. So easy! It tastes like those "Ice Cube" candies that Moritz makes. I don't like the "old fashion" style of fudge that is too sweet and not chocolaty enough. Try crushing pepperment candy canes  sprinkled on top for a fancy finish, tasty too!

It certainly is an easy fudge recipe, and it's very tasty, just not "fudge-like" enough for me.  It really just tasted like eating chocolate chips from the bag.  To me it just doesn't have the consistency that fudge should.  Thanks for sharing though!  It's good for a simple quick chocolate fix! :D

A sweet and simple recipe.  In lieu of warming the ingredients in the microwave, I melted them together in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  After pouring the fudge batter into an 8 x 8 glass baking dish, I sprinkled crushed walnuts on top (rather than mixing the nuts into the batter) and gently pressed down to adhere to the batter.  I melted additional semi sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler and drizzled the melted chocolate over the crushed walnuts to affix them to the fudge.  I think next time I will add a teaspoon of double strength vanilla extract or perhaps peppermint or orange extract for modification.

This is by far the creamiest, easiest and best tasting fudge recipe I've made.  Perfect for those desperate chocolate fixes we all need sometimes.

I have a very similar recipe I have always used for this called 4 minute fudge. I love it.
I bet money that the people who said it never set up didn't use SWEETENED condensed milk. I bet they used only condensed milk, I have seen it happen before. The sweetened condensed milk is very thick. I am almost positive that is why they had problems. It won't set with out the right kind!

I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips and it still produced more of a dark chocolate taste, which is fine with me, but is something to be aware of if you're looking for more of a milk chocolate flavor.  I added a cup of coconut and half a cup of chopped almonds.  The end result tastes like an Almond Joy candy bar and is absolutely delicious, especially chilled.

This was SO easy!! Because it is so rich, you can cut it into such small pieces for gift boxes at Christmas. All of my friends and co-workers are getting some for the Holiday and it only cost me about $5!

I made this twice with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet based on another review....and my own taste. It is so easy & very good! We made it for Christmas, so we put Christmas sprinkles on top. It looks great! This is now my recipe for fudge!

Isn't fudge suppose to be very firm?  It doesn't  say how long it needs to be in the fridge to firm up.  Mine was in for several hours and it was still soft when I cut it into squares.  I didn't dare try seperating them at that point so I put them in the freezer for several more hours.  I was able to seperate them but they were still soft enough that they lost their square shape using the edge of a metal spatula to take them out of the pan.  The taste isn't spectacular either.  I was very disappointed in this recipe.  Will continue looking.

This is the fudge I have been looking for. I love the dark chocolate flavor of it. I made a few small adjustments, melted the butter first then added the milk and chocolate and then added about 3 heaping tablespoons full of creamy peanut butter while the chocolate was melting. I chose to do it in a pot on the stove. Tastes amazing!

Followed the recipe exactly and all of the people I had over had 2-3 pieces (they were small) but it just wasnt my grandmas fudge. It was very good just not what I wanted. It was done in about 2 hours for those of you wanting to know how long it takes after putting it in the fridge.

Wow, talk about an easy recipe!  I have always gone through much trouble to make my fudge so I was very leary about this recipe.  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  Boy am I glad I did!  It is super easy and very tasty.  Definately creamy with no sugar grit whatsoever.  I am not a fan of dark chocolate so thanks to the reviews I changed it up a bit too.  I used 4 cups milk chocolate chips and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I doubled the recipe as offered by the author of this recipe and also lined my pan with foil saturated with butter.  Its a keeper!  Thank you so much for providing such a fantastic fudge recipe.  The fact that it is super easy to make is a super bonus but I would make it again if it took me all afternoon!  :)

This is SO much simpler than having to cook it and watch a candy thermometer and then pour this dangerously hot molten goo into a pan without splashing any on yourself!   I agree with lightening it up with some milk chocolate.  I put some cream cheese into it to cut the chocolate taste a bit.  I never thought I would say it, but the taste of chocolate is a bit too intense - not enough to stop me from making another batch!!!!

I make fudge every year for Christmas, I made this fudge for the first time last year. I received more compliments for it than any other fudge I've ever made. The recipe is very adjustable. One variation I use is to make one batch with semi sweet and one with white chocolate. I spread the semi sweet into a pan, then spoon the white chocolate on top and run a knive through the pan to create swirls. You have to microwave the batches one right after the other and be careful not to swirl the fudge too much or the two batches will blend together. I will make this fudge every year.

Made it as written the first time and as others had noted was just a bit to much chocolate.  The second time I used half milk chocolate, half semisweet  and it was awesome.  Then I made what my family now calls  "the worlds best maple nut fudge".  I used white chcolate chips and added 3 tsp of maple flavoring (Mapeline) at the end.  It is softer setting than the chocolate but still can be cut.  I might decrease the amount of butter a little bit the next time. The addition of the chopped walnuts takes it over the top. Its as good as the maple fudge that I purchase at our local candy store, where everything is homemade.  Now I am looking for peanut butter chips to make PB fudge.  Thanks Dana for posting this recipe!

This is very similar to my favorite fudge recipe except mine calls for a teaspoon of vanilla to be stirred in at the very end.  During the holidays I like to use peppermint extract in place of the vanilla, and sometimes omit the nuts.

Delicious and SO easy!  I used a mix of both milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips, and the fudge came out neither too sweet or too dark.  Yum!

I am really disappointed in the reviews on this one.  It IS easy I will give you that, but this tastes NOTHING like REAL fudge.  It set up like fudge, but the texture in your mouth is more like a frosting and it just tastes like super sweet melted chocolate.  In a pinch it works, by looking like fudge, but the taste is just NOT even close to fudge, make the real stuff people!

I've always been afraid of making fudge, It seemed intimiating to me, but this fudge was sooo easy that I am going to put it on my Christmas candy list from now on. It tasted great too! Wonderfully rich and creamy...everything that fudge should be. I made one batch with pecans, and one with almonds (small, whole, salted) and coconut flakes (lots of them). It was great and tasted a lot like almond joy. I did line the pans with parchment paper and then after filling, put a piece of parchment on top and pressed it down good in the pan. When It was cooled, I pulled out the fudge and cut it up. easy-peasy! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great easy recipe!! My only complaint is that with semi sweet chips, it tastes like...well semi sweet chips.  I think mixing some milk chocolate and semi sweet would make it taste "fudgier"  

TIP: for all of those who say it didn't set; it means  the chocolate melted too much...if you remove the mix just as the chips melt (but still holding their "chip" shape) and then mix it...it almost sets immediately.

This recipe is fantastic, and super easy. I've made it with milk, semi-sweet or a combination, with a mix of milk-chocolate and peanut butter baking chips, and chocolate with broken up toffee mixed in. I have 2 batches cooling now, made with mint-chocolate and with butterscotch chips. Lining the dish with plastic wrap makes for easy removal and storage. A loaf pan is just the right size for a half-batch.

I have made this recipe for years, and I just wanted to make one helpful comment.  Just make sure that you use a good quality brand name chocolate chip, as the cheaper store brands are just not as good.  I prefer Ghiradelli or Hersheys, but have used Toll House also.  If it is a bit too dark for some, just substitiute 1.5 c of semisweet and 1.5 c. of milk chocolate chips for the 3 c. of semisweet the recipe calls for.  Try out variations also, it is delicious!

This was fabulous! I can't believe how easy it was to make. We like our chocolate dark, so I did all semi-sweet, and it's wonderful. I might just have to head to the store for every flavor of chips to try it out with them all in the future.

this turned out beautifully! I actually used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips and doubled the recipe. This is going to be a huge hit today! Thank you for sharing

I read and re-read a bunch of easy fudge recipes that would give me that sweet, creamy, richness I love.....this one sounded right.....and boy was it!!!  Really lovely texture & taste!  I used 1 cup prem. white chocolate chips, 2 cups semisweet chips, I was not going to microwave it but at the last min. decided, well why not! lol, I melted the butter first, and only stopped it four times to check and give a gentle stir, I used 50% power, and it took 6 mins and then I used high for 20 seconds....I think I may need a new microwave, that or everyone is different.....  the walnuts give this fudge such a good balance too! next time I'll add a pinch of sea salt, or maybe sprinkle a teeny bit on top....it gives the chocolate that WOW I love.  and finally I know it came out great when my hubby "mr. picky" told me ," wow that fudge was perfect!"  I made it today and a quarter is gone already thanks to him ; )  great recipe! thanks so much & happy cooking!!

It wasn't bad for what it was, but it certainly didn't taste like actual fudge. It tasted a lot like melted chocolate chips, with a texture that was too dense, and almost too smooth in a non-fudge-like way, to be actual fudge. It's good, just don't expect it to taste to feel like fudge. It is also very rich...cut it into really small pieces to serve it. And if you leave it out of the fridge, it starts to loose its consistency and melt a little.

Perfectly smooth and creamy! I used 2 cups of semi-sweet 1 cup milk chocolate (both nestle), so that it wouldn't be too dark. It is wonderful! I also only microwaved 2 minutes and added 1 t. of vanilla after heating.

It is good, but not exactly what I think of as fudge. More like a chocolate bar. But hey just how wrong can you go with chocolate? The kids scarfed it. They didn't care if it was the traditional fudge or not.

This is by far THE EASIEST recipe I have ever used for fudge.  I have made this fudge many times, with many variations on the basic recipe.  Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, flavored, nuts, dried fruit, coconut...works like a charm nearly every time.  I will tell you two tips: one, butterscotch chips do not make very good fudge as they don't melt the same as chocolate does, and two, green mint chips mixed with chocolate chips comes out an odd greyish-green color (though it still tastes really good).  I have added 1-2 tsp of extract (orange and raspberry are two of my favorites, and peppermint is very good too) after the mixture's done in the microwave too.

My favorite is a mix of 2 cups milk chocolate, 1 cup Hershey's Special Dark, chopped walnuts and dried cherries, and a tsp. of vanilla extract.

This was very good.  Very rich, like a truffle.  I can't help thinking that I did something wrong, though, because my fudge never 'set.'  The consistency is  just like THICK frosting.  Anyone know what went wrong?  Maybe because I cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave since I didn't have a microwaveable bowl large enough, or that I used a metal baking dish to refrigerate it in and not a glass one?

This was easy.  I've made fudge once with a kit.  The only thing I changed was instead of using semisweet chocolate chips only, I used 2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips.  (hubby likes milk chocolate.)  I did not use walnuts but instead added 1 1/2 cups minature marshmallows.  I just had a call for the recipe from our friendly heating and cooling business that I shared some fudge with this morning.  yah!!  (ps.  I gave 4 stars as I do not eat sweets and haven't even tasted...)

You must try this!! I made the recipe exactly as written only I put it in a 9x13 pan. Then I immediately made a thrid batch with peanut butter chips then sirled it into the chocolate fudge. OH MY GOODNESS! so perfect! I imagine it would be better to make the two kinds of fudge at the same time. I'll do that next time.

Although this  was easy to make, it  was not  really  *fudge*. The  texture  was waxy despite my using *good* ingredients.  I used caramel chocolate flavored chips. My kids  liked it  though I prefer the  fluffy fudge texture.

I agree with the people who said that although this fudge is easy to make, it tastes nothing like fudge. Fudge had a wonderful texture & layers of flavor. This has the texture of dense frosting & a boring one-note flavor. I'd rather eat chocolate chips straight-up.

I really did not enjoy this recipe.  It doesn't really have the consistency of fudge, more like melted, softened chocolate chips squished into a pan.  I would not recommend this recipe, nor would I make it again.  The Fantasy Fudge is much better for an easy fudge recipe.

This recipe is so simple to make, yet tastes absolutely scrumptious!!!!  Took me 5 minutes to make.  I used semisweet chocolate chips and maybe 3/4 to 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  I also spread crushed candy canes on top of half of the fudge before refrigerating - tasted divine!

Easy and very yummy!  I used milk chocolate chips and added 1 tsp vanilla.  Mine only took 2 min in microwave.  Careful-if you put it too long, it will get 'grainy'.  After I cut mine, I put them in individual muffin cups; it makes it easier for people to grab them!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Giving 2 stars because it TASTED good, but was an awful mess to look at.  I ended up scrapping it and re-melting it all in a pot on the stove and added marshmallow creme to get a decent texture. Therefore was able to 'save' all the ingredients I wasted on this recipe.  I Followed the recipe exactly.

This was a terrific recipe! It was super easy to make and extremely delicious!           My friends and I used vanilla extract and instead of walnuts, we added pecans.  It set in about 1.5 hours and we all loved it!  Definitely recommend this recipe.  :-)

This is my go to recipe for fudge. I add nuts, dried cherries, dried and fresh blueberries, or any dried fruit or small fresh fruit. Be sure to keep it in the fridge if you add fresh fruit. I have also added.Kahlua, triple sec or rum. Rum is good with dried pineapple. Use any kind of chip and have fun with it.

This is a really good recipe.  To make it even better, we all know the round chocolate orange flavored oranges wrapped in orange foil.  They are always sold in my area at christmas.  Well add 1 1/2 Tbs. of pure orange extract to this recipe.  It taste just like the oranges.  You can add pure strawberry extract too.  Equally tasty.  I have added raspberry extract also.  Wonderfully good.

Instead of putting everything in a bowl and microwaving it, I put it on the stove and it turned out just the same if not better. For my second batch, I substituted the semi-sweet for peanut butter chips to make peanut butter fudge. It was perfect. Great recipe for the semi-sweet and peanut butter type of fudge.

Completely tasteless.  Don't waste your ingredients on this recipe.  The recipe worked exactly like it was supposed to - it wasn't grainy or anything, and it set beautifully.  It just tasted boring!!  That was a huge waste of 3 cups of chocolate chips.  :(

Super easy! The condensed milk gives it a slight caramel flavor. Stays firm and taste best when kept refrigerated..gets very soft when left out to snack on.

Let me start out by saying that I'm always a tough judge when it comes to fudge. We made this fudge for Christmas (with 2 cups milk chocolate, 1 cup semisweet) and we got rave reviews from all of our family members. Like another reviewer said, I still think it was a little too "dark", and more importantly to me, it was too hard. I prefer a softer fudge, so next time I might consider adding some whipping cream or more butter or something. That said, the hardest part of the recipe was cutting it after it was refrigerated.  Oh yeah, I don't know how big a piece of fudge these people are eating, but it can easily make 24 pieces of fudge. Maybe 32...if you want to cut that much.

You've got to be kidding me.  All these years I've avoided making fudge, remembering the hassle my mother went through.  Who knew it could be that easy. I did line the bottom of my glass dish with foil for easy removal and after making the first batch, I reduced the butter by half (two TBLS instead of the four it called for).  The possible variations of this are endless. Can't thank you enough for the recipe.

I loved that this recipe is so simple and almost impossible to mess up.  I tried making fudge years ago and had problems with it setting and have been hesitant ever since to try again.  This turned out perfect and no issues.  It is simple and quick.  I'm a chocoholic and generally prefer semi-sweet chocolate, but next time I think I would try this with some milk chocolate chips.  It tastes great, but is so super sweet and dark chocolaty that you can only have  a little teeny tiny bit.  The recipe is so easy and quick that I'll be trying again with a slightly different mix of chips.

In order to make this taste just like the expensive fudge bought @ country stores, sift 1/4 cup of icing sugar into the mix before pouring and voila! A tiny bit of gritty texture and people will think you bought it from a professional fudge shop. I have made this recipe for baking exchanges and it is a hit every time and oh so simple.

Heated the condensed milk and butter in the microwave for 2 mins first, then  just stirred in the choc chips.  They melted just fine. ...did it that way b/c I was afraid to accidentally overheat the chips and "cook" them, you know, where they get crusty and then unusable.  So, I didn't even microwave the chips.  The recipe was done in less than 5 minutes and my family literally thought I spent hours...  hee hee!  It was great!!

First layer....1 cup peanut butter chips, 2/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Second layer...1 cup milk chocolate chips, the remaining milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. This was the easiest fudge I ever made.

I love this recipe, is easy and fast. I have sometimes substituted the chocolate chips for white choc.chips and added 2 tsp peppermint extract and 3 crushed candy canes for a "candy cane" fudge. YUM!

Super Easy and tastes great!!!! For a pretty presentation place in a well greased 8 inch cake pan with a well greased glass, cup, or the sweet milk can in the center. Makes a pretty wreath. Melt some white chips in a zip lock bag, snip the corner and pipe over the wreath.

Really easy. I mean REALLY easy. I have made it multiple times with multiple different flavors. Added orange extract to the chocolate. Used peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, and white chocolate chips. Add-ins - peppermint with candy cane chunks, crushed oreos, almonds with almond extract, heath bits, and we did one where we poured half the mixture then a layer of roasted almonds, melted caramel, and the last layer of the fudge. Very good fudge. I always do one and a half packages of chips though. One package is not firm enough. Line your dish with aluminum foil and spray it. Pops out easy to cut. A friend begged me, asking what he could do to get more fudge he loved it so much.

Two stars because it taste good, but I followed this recipe exactly as written. It has been over 5 hrs. and I'm assuming it won't harden. It is not at all like the picture, turned out way too runny. Not at all the consistency of fudge. I won't try this again because I know I did it all correctly, was a complete FLOP!!

This is perfect!  I also used 1 cup semi-sweet and 2 cups milk chocolate chips and for fun added a splash of Grand Marnier and a splash of vanilla.  Perfect chocolate taste, nice and smooth, not grainy.  Everyone LOVES it!  Thank you for sharing!

The butter can be left out. This is how I did it: In a saucepan add sweetened milk and chocolate chips and melt them together on low heat. This way you can monitor the mixture more easily to prevent boiling or burning. When it's melted add 2 tsp of vanilla extract and the nuts.

So good and so easy!  I used milk chocolate chips and I melted all the ingredients in a non-stick pot on the stove.  It only took a few minutes to melt together.  This fudge is not grainy at all.  It is delicious and this was my first time making fudge.  I will make again and again!  Thanks for the recipe

that was so easy and delicious! i tweaked the recipe a little, to make it milk chocolate and PB. it was SO GOOD! i just split the condensed milk & butter into two different bowls, then added 1 1/2 c PB chips or milk chocolate chips to each. i microwaved 1 bowl at a time on high for 1 minute, stirred, and then poured. it turned out to be a nice layering of flavors. you do have to move fast, as it starts to harden quickly. i would heat 1 type, pour it, and then heat and pour the next flavor also, i lined the glass pan with parchment paper and lightly buttered it. this worked out great. bravo for easy & yummy!

Holy ****!!! My husband is a huge fan of fudge, but I have never cared for it. He insisted that I play around with recipes and flavors until I find what works for me. Not one to eat "straight chocolate" I used my other favorite: cinnamon. Half cinnamon chips, half dark chocolate chips... the walnuts provide a texture variant and a compliment to the cinnamon in a way that can only be described as decadent. Not only that, it came together in 5 minutes flat, perfect for my busy schedule, and without standing over a hot stove babysitting a thermometer. Thanks Dana!

VERY GOOD!   Just like what they sell on the boardwalk.  It has a smooth creamy rich dark chocolate taste.  Very easy to make.  I made it according to the recipe with no changes.   Next time I think I'll add minature marshmallows.  Thank you Dana for sharing!

Followed directions to the T, even used nice chocolate.  It has been in the fridge for about 5 hours now and I would assume is set by now.    This fudge is gummy and and tacky--tastes too much like chewy melted chocolate chips. I think adding peanut butter (as suggested in other comments) would have improved the taste and texture very much, perhaps replace part of the sweetened condensed milk.  Fudge fail.

I put this together quite quickly, it is  now in the fridge, so hope it sets up nicely. The flavor & texture seem OK. I was going to add some salt as I used unsalted butter, but I forgot-did add vanilla extract & chopped pecans.

Deliciously smooth...never quite set up like I'm used to, but tasted great enough to make up for that!  I used generic store brand chips (didn't even splurge for Nestle), and didn't have any trouble with taste or waxiness.  I used 2 c. milk chocolate chips with 2/3 of the butter and condensed milk called for, microwaved them together just until melted, then stirred in ~3/4 c. chopped walnuts and 1 tsp. almond extract.  Poured it in a foil-lined, greased 9x9.  Then microwaved together 1 c. white chocolate chips with 1/3 the butter and condensed milk called for until melted, and stirred in 1 drop red food coloring, 2 drops yellow food coloring, and 1/2 tsp orange extract.  Poured it on top of the milk chocolate layer, then marbled with a knife.  Everyone loved it!  Can't wait to try an Almond Joy version...

My favorite way to make fudge.  I usually omit the butter and it turns out fine.  I mix Hershey's chips and condensed milk and pour into pan.  Then I press the Andes mint chips into warm fudge.  Everyone raves about it & we call it meltaway fudge.  Great for Christmas!

This will be my go to fudge recipe from now on. It is soo simple to make and has great texture and flavor. Also amazing using 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips. Everyone who's tried this is amazed when I tell them the recipe. Try it, you won't be sorry.

Does it get any easier than this?  I made chocolate peanut butter fudge by using half milk chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. The fudge is pretty enough to give as a gift in a hand-painted gingerbread box, and delicious enough to treat myself!

The flavor of this is, simply, melted chocolate chips.  Nothing less and nothing more.  I prefer old fashioned fudge with a true fudge flavor and not just chocolate chips in a huge lump.

These were very easy to make and really good. They were definitely not as sweet as most fudge which is a good thing to me.  If you like really sweet fudge, substitute some or all of the semi sweet chocolate chips with milk chocolate. I only put the nuts in half of the fudge because my husband likes nuts in his while my daughter and I don't.  I made these on the stove instead of the microwave. I just melted the butter and then put the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in the pan on the stove on low heat to melt the chocolate chips. It works fine that way as long as you continually stir.

Fool-proof Recipe! 

I made these to give to someone else for their birthday. They loved them! People were asking for the recipe. It tastes delicious!

It was so easy! I microwaved for 3 minutes without stirring in between and put pecan pieces on top. I also made it without the butter and added a pinch of salt. They came out almost identical but I think I prefer with butter. But the two are so similar that I'm really not sure because I don't even think I can tell them apart. I put one in a 17x12(lined with greased wax paper in a metal pan) and one in an 8x8 greased glass. I lifted the wax paper off and the pieces are very thin but they cut beautifully! 

I tried to make old fashioned fudge first(with cocoa) and I ended up with ice-cream topping. I eventually want to master it but I didn't have time to mess around so I found this easy recipe and it worked like a charm but the real version would be a money-saver as well as a recipe that is easy to make with ingredients already on hand.

I must say, I really wasn't sure I wanted to waste 3 cups of choc chips after reading the bad reviews. So, I decided to use up all the 1/2  bags of choc chips old and new to clean the cupboard out. I followed the recipe to a tee even with the semi sweet chips.....walnuts too! Holy cow is all I can say! Easy is an understatement. Not sure how the bad reviews could be for this fudge because it was delicious! Loads of flavor and solid texture....completely wonderful! (It did take overnight in the fridge to solidify and you really should precut after an hour or two in the fridge)I even melted the butter with the chip and didn't get that grainy texture. Last week I tried another one with sugar, cream, cocoa powder and brought it to a certain temp over the stove......nasty compared to this recipe! This one is really fabulous. Thank you Dana!

After reading the reviews I used 2c semi sweet choc. chips and 1 cup milk choc. chips. First time I have ever made fudge, I think this recipe is a great basic recipe to start with! The flavor and texture turned out great.

This is my go to fudge recipe.  It turns out better for me than the stovetop versions. It doesn't get that grainy  texture that fudge sometimes gets.  I think the trick is to stir it a couple of times during cooking and don't overcook it.  As soon as its melted, pull it out.  I also line my pan with greased heavy duty foil (that's all I buy anymore), for easy cleanup. 
Everyone asks me to make my fudge every year, so I'd say the recipe is awesome!

I've used a similar recipe before and it's great.  The difference was to melt the chips over a double boiler so they don't burn.  But if combine everything first it should be fine at 50% power.  Last time I split it into 3 parts by using foil and made plain, walnut and stirred peanut butter swirls into the last one.

This worked out ok for a very quick, easy fudge but it's nothing like the cooked kind with marshmellow cream.  I was inspired by the picture with 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 chocolate so that's what I made.  It does cut beautifully when set.  I brought it to work and there are no complaints.  I'm just used to creamier, more fudgey fudge.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving this a 5 for a few reasons. 1: it's just plain awesome. 2: it cured my chocolate craving with only half a block because of how chocolatey mine turned out. 3: my daughter refuses to eat it, which means more for me, and it'll last longer! Horrah! Passed the recipe along to some friends who are excited about the easiness of the recipe.

Delicious! And so easy to make! I did it on the stovetop with a thick-bottomed pan and added a dash of vanilla and salt for flavor. 
Word to the wise, if you do use the stove, make sure you've got your butter and condensed milk warm before adding the chocolate. Hot chocolate hates cold things, and will seize on you in no time.

Wonderful! I made this fudge for Christmas and it was incredibly easy and delicious. The one change I made was melting the ingredients on the stove instead of microwaving so I had more control.

A very tasty recipe and very easy to make! I was afraid that I burnt the chocolate mixture in the microwave after only 4 minutes, and stirring every 1.5 minutes - but once I put it in the pan and let it refrigerate overnight, it set up to look and taste just like the fudge I knew growing up!

This was my first time making 'simple fudge'. I used 1 cup milk chocolate and 2 cups semi sweet. I'm glad I did because it was a little bitter. I poored the hot fudge into a baking dish lined with tin foil, which made it very easy to remove and cut. It looked very appealing and was the first dessert to go. For how simple it was to make I will definitely make again.

I found this recipe super easy!  I melted the chocolate chips, Sweetened condensed milk and butter down on the stove top using low heat with no problems, instead of the microwave.  I also used this recipe as a base for white chocolate fudge with rum and coconut.

I love this recipe and I've done it for years; however,  I don't use butter....I totally leave it out and it's the same.    So you can cut out a little more fat by doing that :)   Enjoy!

It was really great! I have never made fudge before and it turned out perfectly. I don't use a microwave, so i melted it all slowly in a pot which I was worried about, but it worked just the same.

This recipe literally took me five minutes to do. The fudge tastes awesome!  Like others, I used all milk chocolate chips and it was fantastic.  I made the fudge for my work Christmas party tomorrow, I'll be lucky if I still have any left before I make it over there! Haha! Thanks for the recipe. P.S. Shh!! Don't tell my mom, but this fudge tastes better than hers and is a lot less work! :)

OMG! Fantastic!  I've made 4 batches now and prefer the semi-sweet chips over the sweeter milk chocolate.  Today I added macadamia nuts and 2 T of raspberry jam.   YYYUUUUMMMMM

   Thanks.

Really fabulous and easy fudge!  I will never go back to making it the old way again. I made this the other day and the chocolate flavor was great and it had the perfect amount of chew.  Even 3 days later, the fudge was not dry, like what traditionally happens and the flavor was just like when I first made it.  This fudge is creamy and the chocolate was the predominant flavor (sometimes powdered sugar tends to be the predominant component/flavor - but not with these).  Just perfect!  Save this one and make it as gifts!

People were shocked when they learned I did this in the microwave!  This is by far the best fudge recipe I've ever used.  It only takes a few minutes, and tastes awesome.

Awesome!  Super easy...to make it fancy, I added coarse sea salt granules on the top.  The sweet and salty is amazing and looks gourmet!

This is the recipe I always use from my roommate. Turns out great every time. I've altered and used different stir-ins--- nuts, mashmellows, PB chips, butterschotch chips, mint chips. All are great. I always line the pan with foil and spray with a little pam to make it easy to remove.

This is a great, easy recipe - my daughter had fun helping with it! I made just a few changes/additions: 1) omitted the walnuts, 2) added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 3) added 1 tsp peppermint extract, 4) microwaved for 40 seconds then mixed a little, and then 50 seconds and mixed a little before scooping into the foil-lined pan.  According to my b/f, this was the best fudge by far. I've also had lots of requests for this recipe!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. This was by far the easiest recipe that I have ever made and it tasted like I had worked on it for hours. Perfect recipe just the way it is, but also found that you can substitute peanut butter as well, straight from the jar. Awesome!!

This recipe is AWESOME! I'd never made fudge before and was glad to find a recipe without marshmallow creme. I was skeptical of the microwave but it turned out perfect. I had to microwave for 6 minutes at 50% power, removing every two minutes to stir. The first day it tasted a little funky, but after two or three days the flavor mellowed out a tad and it was DELICIOUS. I also made a butterscotch fudge using the same recipe, subsituting butterscotch chips for chocolate, and 1/2 c almonds and 1/2 c pecans for the 1 c walnuts. It's a little too nutty, so I'd go a little easier on the nuts with butterscotch. I also used white chocolate chips, added 1 tsp of mint extract and crushed 12 peppermint candies to add to the mix. The flavor is wonderful, both the white chocolate and the mint are subtle, neither overwhelms the other. It could use more of the peppermint candies, though. Next up: trying peanut butter fudge using 3 c crunchy peanut butter (not chips) instead of chocolate chips. YUM!

Read some of the reviews and I used a pyrex glass dish, 3 cups of milk chocolate chip, mixed the condensed milk with the chips before microwaving and put on high for 3 minutes - took out stirred and it took a minute or so to fold in the butter well. Put back on half power for one more minute just to ensure the butter was mixed in well and poured into a wax papered pyrex dish. Came out very creamy and smooth not grainy like some reviews said. It actually began to set quicker than i thought and was ready in three hours to cut. I actually think it could have been a little sweeter and will experiment, but I've had many fudge disasters in the past and this recipe as is seems to be a quick easy fool proof way to make it.

I have been using this recipe for years and it seems to taste better each time! I vary the chips I use depending on the occasion. Try the Andes Candy baking chips for an awesome mint chocolate fudge.

I can't keep my hands out of the container! That's bad because this was supposed to go in my Christmas tins! :) This fudge was so simple and delicious. Other reviewers spoke of the fudge being a bit too dark for their tastes, so I adjusted the recipe to fit my family's sweeter tastes as well. I used 1 cup semisweet morsels, 1 cup milk chocolate morsels, and 1 cup premier white chocolate morsels (all from the Hershey's brand). Excellent recipe, thanks so much!

Wow!  This took me a total of 5 min to make (only about 2 min in the microwave).  The key is to micro at one-min intervals and to stir vigorously!  That way the ingredients won't separate.  I used mostly milk chocolate to make it a little more kid-friendly.

Perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. I used other rater's suggestion and used a piece of foil to help get the fudge out, and man, It was hard enough to stop my husband from dunking his finger in the fudge while it set in the fridge. Not gonna change a thing, and It is so additionally pretty to sprinkle powdered sugar on top.

This is an amazing recipe given the limited number of ingredients.  I made this with Hershey's semisweet and again with Nestle's semisweet morsels with different results.  The Hershey product yielded a firmer fudge which worked better for gift boxes.  The Nestle morsels produced a creamier fudge which was great for home use.  The ease of making this fudge is remarkable!!!!

This is so easy to make. My son and I have been making it together since he was 4 years old. Being a microwave recipe allows the kids to really participate. I agree with some of the other reviews that you milk chocolate instead of semi sweet. We love to use different chips to make different flavors. Our favorite thing to do since we like chocolate mint fudge is crush andes mints and after we pour the fudge into the pan we push the crushed andes mints on top then let keep completely cool before cutting! Love this recipe!!

I only used 2 cups of milk chocolate morsels & added a tbsp of butter. I mixed it very well on the stove top (on low) before pouring in the pan. After I poured it in the pan I added some white chocolate chunks I had cut up from a bar, let them melt a bit, then swirled. The texture was great, but still a little too sweet for me & with already subtracting a whole cup of morsels, I'm not sure what else could be done for that problem. Next time I may try adding nuts or marshmallows to offset the chocolate power.

Not only is this the easiest way to make fudge, but it is also the best tasting. Because of its simplicity you can add pretty much whatever you like to it. I used about 1.5 cups of chopped pecans. I also sprinkled about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips on top to give it a little extra flair. Yum!

Fantastic and easy recipe!  Delicious!  But do not deviate from chocolate chips - I once made with "chocolate chunks" and the recipe did not work out.  Assuming that the amount could be altered and the chunks would work, however.

This recipe was by far the easiest and tastes best.  My modifications were based on what I had on hand: 2 cups white chocolate chips; 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips; cooked on stovetop at low temp till melted; added 2 tsp vanilla; and 2 cups walnuts.  Also used foil lined 8x8.  Absolutely perfect.

Cannot believe how easy this was.  I used milk chocolate chips so my chips melted faster-- mixed once after the first minute and it was done after the second minute.  Per another reviewer's suggestion I put the extra choco chips in the freezer (only for about 5 minutes) and then mixed them into the fudge before putting it into a pan to set.  Since I skipped the walnuts, it made for a great texture.  Will use this again.

This is an OK recipe, if your in a hurry and want to make the easiest fudge ever. If you want a recipe thats actually better than OK, dont use this one.

if you use high quality chocolate chips, it makes the recipe infinitely better. this really does taste like traditional fudge--people will rave. It's so easy why not try it!? this was a big hit.

Fab, fab, fab!!!!!  Decided to perform a little experiment with this recipe and a recipe that called for the typical marshmallow cream.  This by far beat that recipe. The other recipe was very soft and sticky, and overbearingly sweet.  This one had the perfect consistency that you expect of smooth and creamy fudge.   Not overly sweet either. The best part was that it took 1/2 the time to make compared to the other recipe, and had better results. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and the only change a made was adding a 1/2 C of hazelnuts. Beats out some of the fanciest Chocolater fudge that I have had. Planning on making another batch tomorrow!

This was really good and easy.  I used two cups of milk chocolate chips and one cup of semi-sweet.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Perfect!

I also have made this recipe for years. The base is even more tasty when I add in about 1t vanilla extract at the end of cooking, before pouring into pan. I have used many "fillers" for this including nuts, chopped candied cherries and even mini marshmallows.  Thanks for reminding me how easy this is and to make some today!

I used one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, two cups of dark chocolate chips, added a dash of salt, and some vanilla extract (I can't resist tweaking). After taking it out of the microwave, I beat it and beat it, and it was the smoothest, creamiest, best fudge I've ever had. All my fudge-craving friends and family agreed... in between eating it all up!

I use buttered foil in a 9 x 13" pan, and after microwaving I stir in 1 cup of miniature marshmallows and 1 cup of salted peanuts.  Chill, then remove from foil and cut into squares.  Excellent every time!!

I used Milk Chololate Chips instead. This is a good, easy recipe. It's also easy to change around according to different tastes. Next time I'm going to try making a double layer with Peanut Butter. Also, I do agree about buying BRAND name for baking. Thanks for sharing.

This receipe was very good and impressed all my coworkers!  I doubled the recipe which was perfect for gift giving and used 2/3 milk chocolate chips to 1/3 semi-sweet chips.  When I tried the single recipe it turned out a little greasy, but next time I'll be sure to measure the butter more accurately.  Great recipe!

The recipe is great except you gotta use the milk chocolate chips( good quality) and NO off-brand sweetened condensed milk. Use quality ingredients only. It really makes a difference. It was really good when I made it with just walnuts but.....it was great when I skipped the walnuts and added half a bag of the butterfinger baking bits (butterfingers already smashed) and half a bag of Reese's baking chips! It's incredible!

I have tried so many different fudge recipes & this one by far is the easiest & best. My whole house LOVED it! I did add some Peanut Butter to half of it. After I poured it into my pan, I took a spoonful of PB & just mixed it right in the warm chocolate.

Great Fudge! The last time that I made fudge it was grainy and brittle. This recipe was perfect. I did use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips and I used a double broiler instead of a microwave. It turned out smooth and velvety. I also made a batch of peanut butter fudge with peanut butter chips. It turned out great also. They both were a big hit. I have found my recipe for fudge from now on.

I made this recipe with peanut butter chips as I didn't have enough chocolate on hand to do the whole recipe.  I thought it was okay - not like my go to fudge recipe - but I didn't have any marshmallow cream on hand.  I think that fudge is better with the marshmallow in it - it adds a lighter texture to the fudge - but this recipe is good if you want a dense, rich fudge and/or you don't have any marshmallow at the time.  I would make this again and try with the chocolate next time.  I used unsalted butter as that is what I keep on hand for baking.  I might try with salted butter next time to see if it changes the flavor much.  Overall - the easiest fudge recipe - so fast, the taste/texture - fine, but not what I am used to.

This fudge recipe is definitely the one for me.It was rich, creamy and just sweet enough.It was a little too dark so I  tried it with milk chocolate morsels, and it was fantastic. My cousin loved it and she doesn't even like fudge!This was a huge hit!

Couldn't believe how quick and easy this was to make!!! I used Reese's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  I put it in the microwave for 4 minutes stirring after 2 minutes and before pouring into greased (sprayed with lots of PAM)glass baking dish. Can't wait to try other chips. Thank you to the person that thought of this easy recipe!!

I love shortcut cooking or baking and this by far is a winner!

I love this fudge! It is so creamy and smooth. It is so easy to make. I love to cook. Your recipe is so easy to make since we could make it in the microwave. We gave it to a friend and she said she wanted the recipe because it was the best fudge ever. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, easy, easy to make & everyone loves it and thinks it's been made the old fashioned way!   I did follow some of the reviews - I melted the butter first, then added the choc chips & Eagle Brand; I also used all milk chocolate chips and used the Ghirardelli brand.   It has been fabulous every single time (and this is the 4th time I've made it in the last few weeks...great flavor and perfect texture!

We liked it OK.  I'm rating it for what it is and that is microwave quick fudge.  It does not taste like my Grandmother's fudge but it tastes great for what it is.  We used a mix of semisweet and dark chocolates.  When you make this fudge (and you should), please add some salt.  An 1/8 tsp of salt made all the difference in the world in flavor!!

Needed a quick fudge recipe for a holiday party and found this one. I used a mix of Ghirardelli bittersweet and milk chocolate chips, also a dash of vanilla and an eighth of a teaspoon of espresso powder. What an easy and yummy fudge.

Are you serious??? How many hours and hours of my life have I spent making fudge, soft ball method, taking temperature, ruining batches...this was sooo easy! Hooray! Made chocolate walnut and chocolate peanut butter in a matter of minutes. I used others' recommendations and used 2 cups milk + 1 cup semisweet. Really good!!! NOTE: If yours is runny or doesn't "set" - make sure you are using sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated milk!!! Huge difference between the two!

This is absolutely the best fudge ever!  I doubled the recipe as suggested and it turned out perfectly.  My 7 year old grandson wants me to make more for his 1st grade class.

So easy compared to other fudge recipes that require temperature themometers. I chose to use half semi sweet and have sweet morsels. I melted the margarine first. I microwaved for 4 1/2 minutes setting timer every 1 min 30 seconds to stir. Also I added a cup of mini marshmellows. This fudge came out awsome. My husband is very critical and he couldnt find anything wrong with it! As a matter of fact he wants me to make it again!

I found this recipe tasted more like the semisweet chocolate chips than fudge usually does. I use Ghirardelli chips, so it's good, but not the more complex fudgy taste I wanted.

I made this in four different variations, and they were all fantastic, but I improved upon them each time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and used semi-sweet chips. Initially, I was concerned about the consistency when I did the final stir, but it came out fine. My only issue was I noticed some butter separated from the mix and pooled/congealed in air pockets on the bottom. I reduced the butter by 1 T going forward.

The second chocolate batch I used 1/2 c of peanut butter chips to cut some of the bitterness (mom's request). I added nuts this time as well. Magnificent.

The first batch of peanut butter was strictly peanut butter chips, the milk and the reduced amount of butter. Turned out great, but not as peanut buttery as I would have liked. Made another batch a few weeks later - reduced the butter to 1T and added 3T of peanut butter. It was amazing!!

Unfortunately, this recipe now gives me a super easy way to get my chocolate/sugar fix that has both a long shelf life and easy portability. I'm in trouble :)

it was my first time ever making fudge. I always thought of it as a complicated desert. Made it for Christmas this year and got so many compliments from my family. My mother-in-law, who has been making fudge for years, was very impressed! I opted for nuts, and added peanut butter chips to develop more flavor! Thank you for such a simple and delish recipe!

Oh my...I just threw this together this morning for a family Christmas dinner tonight.  I have used the puffed marshmallow recipe for years and could never get the fudge smooth every time. I gave a piece of this fudge to my husband and he said "Why would you ever use another recipe, this is amazing."  Thank you for sharing this recipe...it is perfect and you can bet that I won't share this recipe with the family since it is so easy to make. :)

This was by far the easiest fudge recipe I've ever made.  I used 1 bag of semi-sweet and a half a bag of white chocolate, which tasted so good!  Was very creamy and just simply delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I loved this fudge. It was super easy, and went into my Christmas tins filled with other goodies to hand out to friends and family. I eliminated the nuts (because hubby doesn't care for them) but will definitely try it with for myself since I love them! :))

I thought this fudge was amazing. I used 1 cup semisweet and 2 cups milk choc. chips. I microwaved for 1 minute then stirred, 1 minute then stirred and then 30 seconds and it came out great! Lined the pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray. Let it cool for a few hours and then flipped it out and cut it up. DELISH!!

WOW! I hope I could of  given this recipe a 10*.  Every recipe I try, I make my husband taste first.  He is a critic about everything!!!!  He asked me where did I find this recipe?  I said on this web site, of course.  He said it's the best treat he's ever tasted.
Well I went out and bought ingredients for 3 more batches because I'm definitely doing this recipe again and again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing. You made my hubby happy  :)

Very yummy - we can't get semisweet chocolate in the UK, so I used 70% and some peppermint flavouring with red candy melts drizzled on the top. One small point (and sorry to be boring) but this isn't fudge; it's a solid sort of ganache. Delicious nonetheless.

True, this was very easy to make. And it did turn out alright, though that was mostly my fault. I have made a different fudge a few times before and I was so used to that recipe ... Well, let's just say the chocolate chips I used cooked much faster than I figured ...
Otherwise, this recipe was fine. Just really watch it when it's in the microwave ...

Very good and so much easier (and cheaper) than the other recipe we tried. Used one cup of butterscotch chips with two cups of chocolate chips and topped it with toffee chips, in place of nuts. Be aware that the toffee chips will soften if the fudge is not eaten soon, though.

Tasteless, grainy and it would not set.  Tried reboiling, but it did not work the second time either.  I would not even use this as a topping for ice cream as it is bland.

Excellent. I never made fudge because it didn't seem to turn out the way I wanted it. This is easy and if you follow the directions it turns out perfect. I cut up small milky ways and added to mine with nuts and some marshmallow fluff. I made it and received rave reviews, everyone loved it. Everyone keeps asking me for more fudge as they love it.  I also found sm. caramel balls where you buy the chips and used them in one batch and they worked well too.

easy and delicious! Dark chocolatey and creamy. I followed the recipe as written. My family and I love this fudge!    I did what others mentioned and lined the glass dish.  My trick: I use an oversized piece of buttered foil- it makes is super easy to remove from dish-you just lift it out after it sets. Cut it into pieces after removing it.

I didnt have 3 cups of semi sweet choo chips so I used 2 cups of semi and 1cup of milk choco. Im glad I did because it was almost too bitter still.I think next time I will do it backwards 2cups of milk choco and 1cup semi sweet. I think adding a little vanilla ad other flavorings it could be even better. A great starter recipe though!

So easy, and SO quick. It is wonderful, but I too prefer it with milk chocolate chips. I made a layered variation for my hub with 2.5c milk chocolate mixed with .5c semisweet. Then added a layer made with white chocolate chips, and followed that with a layer made with butterscotch chips. He is absolutely in love, and still asks where I buy it!

My first and only fudge recipe! Turned out fantastic. The only thing I would change is that the second time I made it I didn't grease the pan but I lined my pan with wax paper to make getting the fudge back out easier.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was so easy and it came out great. I added some marshmallow fluff, walnuts, and marshmallows. Iam not a very good  when it comes to making fudge but this recipe was great and will keep this one and will be making more. I had taken some to work and it vanished. I will  make it for the Holidays.  Thanks Lee

This is an awesome recipe.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  I microwaved for only 3 minutes, and stirred with the same spatula that I cleaned out the sweetened condensed milk can with.  Once I was done, I only had one bowl and utensil to clean!

My husband loves fudge, but I don't care for it so I have never tried to make it.  Now that I see how easy it is, I'll be making this for Christmas from now on!  His only complaint was that it was a bit too dense, and my only complaint was that it didn't set solid enough - the top was a little crumby/cracked.  Next time I'll try to whip more air into it in between microwaving and let it sit in a smaller diameter baking dish so that the fudge is taller.  Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to experiment with add-ins and different flavors.

Couldn't be any easier.  If you are a fan of dark chocolate and fudge, this might be more to your liking.  It's not what I would call traditional fudge because of its darker flavor.  One tip, be sure and pat the top with a paper towel if any liquid rises to the top.

By far one of the best fudge recipes that I have tried! I didn't use the walnuts, and doubled the recipe and put into a 13x9 dish, then I pressed mini marshmallows into half of the pan. So yummy! I would suggest that if you use mini marshmallows like I did to mix them into the fudge before pressing into the pan. Some of them were just falling off, but the ones that I really smushed in were absolutely lovely! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe to a "t" and found this fudge much, much too sweet. I am afraid it was just not to my or my guests' tastes. I made it for the first time for a dinner party and everyone found it so. Each had only one piece and no one finished a single piece. I also found that this fudge did not set up as firmly as fudge normally does and remained a bit too soft. I will try to melt it down again and add some unsweetened chocolate to it to see if I can save it as it is very smooth & creamy & it would be a shame to have to throw it all away.

Love it!  Different from my old fudge recipes - but how easy and how good!  I add a tablespoon or so of Kahlua to a batch with perhaps half semi sweet and half mocha chips, and that really adds to the flavor.  It is  easy to make lots  to give away, a plus. I tried the low fat condensed milk, and it didn't seem to matter.

Easiest thing to make. So delicious!  This was my first time making fudge... turned out perfect and everyone who has tried it, said it's fabulous.  I used only 1 cup of semisweet chips & 2 cups of milk chocolate chips. Perfect flavor.

Great fudge!  And the best part is its super easy!  It turned out really well doubling the recipe for a 13x9.  We added half milk choc. and half semi sweet.  While in the microwave I mixed about every 30 sec to a min. and it came out very smooth.  I dont know if it mattered to the outcome or not, but we added a couple dashes of salt and about a tsp. of vanilla.  It set up real well and was nice and creamy.  I will for sure use this recipe again!  Thanks!

Used all milk chocolate chips.  Good fudge, definitely a smoother finish than the grainier traditional fudge.  I prefer the graininess, but with others it was a big hit.  Made one batch with coconut on top, and a second batch with broken pieces of Andes Mint Crunch on top.

This turned out great. I'm so glad it worked better than that other recipe with 4 cups of sugar! While this one was delicious with NO sugar added.   *** I have very good advice for you all. Do not microwave. It changes the food molecules up. It can make you very ill. Instead of microwaving, you should boil it over warm stove fire. It will be the same, except it wont change anything to the food like microwaves will. Just a tip and its completely up to you.** Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This fudge was very bitter.  I think if you mixed milk chocolate chips with the semi sweet it would be more pleasant.  If you like dark chocolate you may like it.  I'm going to try aunt teens recipe next.  It looks good.

Absolutely WONDERFUL and terribly easy. Really, it shouldn't even be possible to make such great fudge. I've made it tree times in the past week. :) Fun to do with variations. Love it! Thank you for sharing!

I read a few reviews before making this that said it tastes a lot like dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate much, so I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 2 cups semi-sweet chips, and 3 cups of white chocolate chips. However, this makes it really sweet so you may not need to use all the sweetened condensed milk.

I really enjoyed this quick and simple recipe.  And as it turns out, it works with whatever chips you have on hand.  I had almost no chocolate chips, but did use white chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch and another one that wasn't labelled :)  other than I scorched it, they were smooth and tasty.  Definitely will line the pan with parchment next time.  Co-workers all appreciated the treat!

very easy and delicious! I used 2 cups of chips and 1 oz unsweetened chocolate to cut the sweetness. Added only 1 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla at end, the butter makes it nice and glossy. Used my warmed bench scraper to cut and it worked great (had read it somewhere)

Loved how easy this fudge was to make!  It tasted pretty good--not too sweet--and wasn't grainy at all since it didn't call for granulated sugar.  I cooked it on the stovetop instead of the microwave.

Very good! I had a package of peanut butter/chocolate chips that I used and then added a half package of semi sweet chocolate chips. I'm used to making it on the stove with lots more ingredients and a candy thermometer. Its a nice quick way if you need a fudge fix!

For the amount of work...none...and the results, I give this 5 stars!  Came out creamy and not too sweet.  I pressed pecans into a third of the batch, coconut into the next third and left the final section plain.  All tasted wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made 1/2 with peanut butter chips and half with milk chocolate... came out creamy and delicious and just like a reeses cup! Maybe my microwave is more powerful, but even on medium I didn't have to heat as long as the recipe stated.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly with the 16 serving size and added pecans.  Next time I will probaby increase the serving size so it can be bigger but the thin (I used a bigger pan) was like a Hershey chocolate bar so I was happy and I got great reviews in it. Thx for sharing this recipe

This was the best! It was so good and was so easy. I tried a few different recipes for peanut butter fudge and nothing compared to this recipe for the chocolate fudge. I did use the milk chocolate chips and it was wonderful!

This was really good and super easy. I added peppermint oil for a mint fudge and it was awesome! I also cut into little pieces and individually wrapped in plastic wrap and that kept it from drying out. Try this if you want something easy!

Followed the ingredients exactly but melted it all together over a double broiler instead of the microwave.  It's good but very, very chocolatey.  I like it but I tend to lean towards dark chocolate over milk.  If you're not a dark chocolate lover, you might want to replace at least half of the chocolate with milk chocolate chips.

This is the most incredibly easy fudge recipe ever!  I'm not personally crazy about dark chocolate (semi-sweet) fudge, so I think I'll try milk chocolate or peanut butter chips next time, but I don't think my taste preference is a basis for reduction in rating.  It's not the smoothest recipe, but given the ease in preparation, I still give it 5 stars.  Thank you for sharing this - it's a keeper!

This was an OK recipe.  I should have read all the reviews and bought Ghiradelli chocolate chips instead of Nestle, I guess...other than that, CUT DOWN ON BUTTER!  1/4 of a cup is way too much.  So much that when it cooled I had little pools of butter all over the top of my fudge.  I won't be making this recipe again because I prefer a more old-fashioned type of fudge, but it didn't taste bad!

This is delectably creamy and smooth! I made this for a church function. I did double the batch and made as written except for the addition of vanilla extract as other suggested. Also, please be sure to use salted butter.  I think the taste would be blah without that bit of salt in the butter. My Mom taught me a long time ago about adding a pinch of salt to sweet stuff to enhance the flavor. I don't know why it works.  I just knows that that pinch of salts makes sweet things taste better. I put it in a 15" baking sheet (small jelly roll pan). Sprayed the pan with cooking oil then lined it with aluminum foil.  Coated the aluminum foil with butter.  I did use a 2-to-1 ratio with the chips, twice as much milk chocolate as semi-sweet.  I also used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips but Baker semi-chocolate because I already had them on hand.  Start out with about 1 1/2 mins. in the microwave. Stir then another 1 1/2 mins.  Then carefully add additional 45 seconds to 1 minute times, stirring after each.  After the first 3 mins., start checking the true status of the "remaining" chips by squeezing one.  You'll be able to tell when those last few chips are soft enough to finish meling.  This will keep you from burning the chocolate.  I did my mixer to beat the melted chocoate for about 2 minutes.  Refrigerated overnight and then cut with a pizza cutter (what a great tip!) after removing from the pan and removing the aluminum foil.  I guess I have to agree with the comments that this d

I tried this first as written and really liked the results.  Tried a second time with milk choc. chips and went crazy over it.  I lined the 8x8 pan with foil, then sprayed with Pam. I also melted the chips in a double boiler instead of the microwave. Chilled before cutting. Came out perfectly! This has to be the best and easiest fudge.  Thanks!

The recipe was indeed simple and very easy to make. However, it was a tad too sweet for me. Next time, maybe I'll reduce the condensed milk. My fudge didn't quite set as well too. I'm not sure why.

this recipe turned out fantastic for me.  i will never go to the trouble of the risky will it set up boil and candy thermometer method again.  it was so quick and easy and my results with the following additions turned out a fudge with good consistency and taste.  i melted and mixed my ingredients on to the stovetop because i do not use the microwave.  i used semisweet chocolate chips, a cup of pecans, and a 7 ounce bag of coconut and put in a buttered foil lined 8x8 glass pan and refrigerated for a couple hours. this did not taste to me like waxy like melted chocolate chips as some others noted but maybe my additions prevented that from happening?  thanks for a super easy tasty recipe!

This recipe is so awesome and easy to make. I had a blast with it. I got creative with mine. I made one by adding crunchy PB and another with marshmallows which made it super creamy and added a mint glaze on the top. I also made one by adding raspberry jelly after. I love chocolate raspberry and it came out delicious. I also made one with white chocolate chips and put crushed oreos in it. The kids loved it. I put them in tins from the dollar store and am going to pass them out as gifts. Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

Excellent recipe for a fudge novice.  It is pretty much fool proof.  I have only tried to make fudge once before and it didn't turn out so it put me off until now, hooray! Really recommend trying this recipe first before trying anything more adventerous.

I thought this was a great recipe for fudge! It was so quick and easy to make.  I used 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips and I added a teaspoon of vanilla after the five minutes of boiling.  Very chocolatey and smooth.  I will be using this recipe over my recipe that used marshmallow cream.

After many unsuccesful attempts at making "real" fudge...the worst being completely unedible and the best turning out as hot fudge sauce...I discovered this completely foolproof recipe.  I make it on the stove on low heat and stir until the chips are melted, then remove from heat and add a tsp of vanilla and the nuts.  Put it in a pan lined with foil and pop in the fridge. My family loves it.  I also use 2 cups of semi sweet chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips for the best 'fudge' flavor. I can't wait to try with coconut and almonds, though.

Great recipe! Simple, easy, and quick. Creamy, smooth, and delicious. I made 3 batches to give away for Christmas this year. In all the batches I took other reviewers' advice and used 1 part milk chocolate to 2 parts semi-sweet. I also doubled all three batches. The first batch I made, I messed up and did the first bit of melting on high in the microwave. It didn't seem to hurt it too badly; I added the nuts to this batch and they turned out ok. I was hoping the texture of the nuts might disguise the screw-up a little and I think it did. The next batch was plain, melted correctly, and turned out pretty well. The third batch I made, I mixed in well about 1 slight tablespoon of peppermint extract after the melting was finished. I also crushed 4 candy canes, and mixed about a teaspoon of the most finely ground powder into the fudge itself, and sprinkled the rest on top. That batch turned out the best. I saved that one covered in the refrigerator and took it to a New Year's Eve party. All the batches I made set very well in the refrigerator, and held their shape and firmness well even after being taken out of the refrigerator. I used butter flavor brand name cooking spray to coat the containers they set in and it worked like a charm. The only thing I would suggest is to cut them into very small, as in put one in your mouth at a time, pieces because they do start to melt pretty quickly once you get them in your fingers and it's a gooey mess, and a tiny bit oily from the spray.

YUM-O! 1 cup milk chocolate and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate, didn't change anything else.  Delicious!  Loved the tip of greasing the pan, then putting the foil in and greasing again.  It helped keep the foil in place and not sliding everywhere.

No candy thermometers, no double-boilers — this fudge recipe is not only an easy, one-pot deal, it tastes like the stovetop stuff. I made a pan of semisweet chocolate chip-coconut stuff (used 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut in place of the nuts) and one pan of white chocolate-cranberry. The white chocolate-cranberry fudge didn't quite set properly and was a little gooey/chewy. I think this might have been because I used "real" white chocolate callets with a high percentage of cocoa butter. I think the extra sugar in chocolate chips helps the fudge to set to the proper consistency so I would stick to using chocolate chips in the recipe and not real chocolate chunks. If you do use real chocolate, consider cutting down the condensed milk a bit to help the fudge set.

Easy and foolproof!  For a quick fudge fix this is awesome!  That being said, Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate fudge recipe on this site is the best but you have to stir forever, this is so quick, effortless, and very creamy. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!  PS. Be careful not to overcook or it will turn grainy!  Update:  This is my go-to recipe when I need something quick.  I like a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of semi-sweet and chocolate chips.  This recipe can be a little tricky if you're using a cheap microwave - my good one broke down, and the small ones are just not as good.  I would check this more closely (stop and stir more often) if you're using a microwave that is less than stellar (or doesn't give you the option to cook at a lower temp) as I mentioned before, it is easy to turn grainy.  One last tip:  butterscotch chips are WAY too sweet, best not to try that version.

I took this fudge to a holiday get-together and got raves like I've never gotten before.

My variation, which tasted really deep and complex: for the three cups of chocolate, use two Hershey's Special Dark Espresso bars, broken up, plus enough semi-sweet chips to make one cup, plus one more cup of semi-sweet chips, plus a cup of milk chocolate chips. Immediately after pouring the fudge into the pan, pour about 1/2 cup of toasted chopped almonds on top, pressing down gently to get them embedded into the fudge.

The mocha taste is really divine!

Very simple recipe, which is why I chose it. I followed some of the earlier reviews and used 1 cup semi sweet with 2 cups of milk chocolate morsels. It came out so good, my husband asked if I'd make some to pass out for gifts this year! Any idea if this is any good if I freeze it in batches??

Excellent creamy holds-together-well fudge.  It got rave reviews at a family get together recently despite my accidently burning the bottom of the pot (I used my stovetop instead of the microwave)! I recommend putting some lucious white chocolate chips in right before pouring it to set. yummilicious

This is a very simple fudge to make but it is a very dark choc. and VERY sweet fudge. It didn't hold up well in the mid August heat and we soon had chocolate blobs.  I did try adding marshmallows and nuts (making it a rocky road fudge) and it was much better.  I guess I would give this recipe a 5 for easy but a 4 for flavor.  Will try a milk chocolate if I make again.

I gave this 4 stars for the ease and quickness of preparation. However, it just wasn't the "old fashioned" fudge I was hoping for. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the melted mixture, and dropped peanut butter chips on top. But like other reviewers, I ultimately ended up with a big lump of chocolate. Oh well, a big lump of chocolate isn't all bad. ;)

This fudge is delicious!  I have made it as the recipe is ... and have modified it to be 2 cups semisweet chips, 1 cup peanut butter chips and added in an extra cup of peanut chips before pouring (so they do not melt).  Any way you make it ... this is an awesome basic fudge recipe that is very simple to modify!  ENJOY!

It's a very good recipe, my only recommendation is to use a non-stick pan on very low heat, add one can of condensed milk per each bag of chips.  I add all the milk first then the chips, constantly stirring until completely smooth.   Remove from heat and add to your preferred dish.   I've also found the best chips are Guittard Chocolate Chips, if you can find them.  See's Candies actually uses Guittard Chocolate to make their chocolates, so if you like See's you'll love Guittard chips!

This is easy and delicious. I tried it both with and without nuts  and I loved it best with the nuts (I prefer pecans). I also altered it slightly, using 2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1 cup semi-sweet because I like darkchocolate, but in fudge I prefer light, but not too light. It turned out perfectly! This recipe takes the guesswork, soft ball/hard ball and thermometers out of fudge making; yet it tastes just as good as the old-fashioned way.

Melted the butter and condensed milk first to avoid the grainy texture. Divided it in half and used 1.5 cups of white chocolate chips and 1.5 cups semi sweet chocolate chips for a yummy marble fudge. Family loves it!!

Yes I will definitely make this recipe for years to come. It is cost and time efficient and it is kid friendly. I made it with my daughter and she loved it. Just a little tip, when you taste it - cause we all will ?? - don’t burn your mouth off! This recipe is great and I recommend it for  children accompanied by a parent from ages 5+.

I made the original recipe and found it to be worth the minimal effort it took to make it--very tasty.  I also altered it a bit to make several different flavors, aka White chips and broken candy cane made peppermint, and so forth.
This is an easy recipe all the way through clean-up and I'll be making it a lot.

So easy and really good! I made it on the stovetop. Melted the butter first, then added milk chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk. When it was all melted and a smooth texture, I added 1.5 tsp vanilla extract and chopped walnuts. Also made with almond extract and 1C sweetened coconut, and replaced 1C of the chips with Andes mints and sprinkled more chopped Andes mints on top. Put all 3 variations in gift boxes and gave away as presents!

Super easy and delicious. I melted the butter, chocolate, condensed milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla in a saucepan because I don't have a microwave. It firmed up beautifully in the fridge. 

Next time I'll try milk chocolate chips because the semi-sweet chips were  a bit too dark and rich. The photo that goes along with the recipe must be milk chocolate because of the light color?

Made this for Christmas this year. I doubled the batch and got 100 pieces of fudge out of it. I made this bc I was in a pinch for time and my usual fudge recipe requires stovetop cooking, precise temperatures using a candy thermometer, etc. To my amazement this was delicious!  Everyone raved over it and several wanted the recipe. It is SO simple and my grandmother said it was the creamiest fudge she'd ever had!  Definitely try this one!!!

Great recipe!  I doubled this and put into a 9x13 dish.  I used half milk chocolate and half semisweet chips as some other reviewers said all semisweet gave too much of a dark chocolate flavor which I hate.  It was perfect!  Make sure to line your dish with foil for easy removal, then flip out onto cutting board.  I will be making this often!

This was so easy to make. We made two batches for Christmas. One time we followed the recipe as directed. The second time we used one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and two cups of dark chocolate, 80%. Both were terrific.

I just can't believe how simple this recipe was to make. This fudge tastes so good and people are amazed that it was made in a microwave. I took the advice from one of the reviews about melting the butter first before adding the other ingredients. I think it really prevented the fudge from turning out grainy. I omitted the walnuts because my family doesn't care for them.

My first time making fudge! Really versatile recipe, which earns it 5 stars to me. I followed the recipe, but used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips because I am just not at all a fan of semi-sweet or dark chocolate - absolutely personal preference. I received rave reviews that it wasn't too sweet, which made it easier to eat several pieces! :) it was so easy to make, I'm kicking myself for not making it sooner. I think I will try another reviewer's suggestion of 3/4 milk chocolate and 1/4 white chocolate. I do agree with another reviewer that the tasty end product does hold on to the "original"Gave this as a well-received holiday gift with Boardwalk Quality Maple Walnut Fudge and Oreo Fudge. Yummy!!

Making fudge doesn't get any easier! Three ingredients, and no more than ten minutes to make!  After reading the reviews, I decided to use  half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips. I made it for our Christmas party, and I was asked for the recipe. My daughter took the rest of it into work and everyone there loved it. We will certainly use this from now on!

Thank God for this recipe! I had to make it the morning my daughter had to take it into school! Had it made in less then 10 minutes, sat in the fridge a short while and it was ready to go! Saved! I didn't have enough semi-sweet chips, so I added 1 cup white chocolate chips. I left out the nuts because so many ppl don't like nuts or have an allergy. It came out smooth, creamy and delicious! I made a second batch for use, addding nuts cause fudge isn't fudge in our house without nuts. My next batch will be 2 layers, bottom layer choocolate and top layer peanut butter.

I made the recipe exactly as instructed using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. It was so simple and took a total of 5 minutes to make. The texture was different than any other fudge I've had,  more chewy than creamy, but tasty. Be sure to line the pan with wax paper for easy cut and clean up.

This was my first attempt at making fudge, and this recipe made it totally easy!  I always heard how difficult it was to get the right texture for fudge, but this recipe must be foolproof because it came out just like every great candy store fudge I've had.  The only thing I changed is I didn't use the microwave, I used a metal bowl over a pot of boiling water because I doubled the recipe and didn't think that much chocolate would melt evenly in the microwave.

I used 2 cups milk chocolate to 1 cup semi sweet as suggested by other reviewers. Heated chocolate according to recipe - no longer & it melted perfectly. I used sweetened condensed milk as stated and reinforced by reviewers rather than plain condensed milk. Fudge turned out great! Very easy to make, very tasty.

I have made this several times now.  The only thing I have changed is adding a teaspoon of vanilla.  To those who are having trouble with this setting up, make sure you use real butter or stick margarine.  You cannot use tub margarines or it will not set, they are too soft.  I have also added several things depending on what I want in it.  My usual addition is 1 cup of coconut and a half of cup of slivered almonds because my husband loves Almond Joys.  Have fun with this recipe and play with your additions.    To those having trouble with crystallizing, you are leaving it in the microwave too long without stirring.  If you have a 1200W microwave like I do you only need a total of 2 minutes in the micro.  Take it out and stir very well halfway through (at the one minute mark) pop it back in and finish the last minute.  It is critical that you stir it up while microwaving or it WILL crystallize every time.  Make sure you stir it very well again when you take it out.  Add your additives like coconut and nuts or dried fruits AFTER you take it out of the microwave.  So easy even a five year old can make it!

Soooo easy and absolutely fabulous! I made this using mint chocolate chips because why not, and it was a hit. Also, I don't own a microwave, so I just melted everything in a saucepan and stirred it frequently--worked fine, maybe better than a microwave since I could keep an eye on it. Took like 5 minutes. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Nice simple fudge recipe! My first batch was still a little grainy when it was all melted so I added a bit of heavy cream and it became nice a smooth!  A good substitute for old fashioned fudge

It tasted more like pudding than regular fudge but it was tasty, next time I would hear it over a stove top, but I only warmed it in microwave for barely any time though so not to burn it.

I just made it using milk chocolate chips. My husband doesn't like dark chocolate, and I was also afraid the dark chocolate would be too dark chocolaty.

 I didn't use the microwave method.  I wanted to melt some marshmallows to incorporate in it (2 cups of mini marshmallows), so i made it on the stove.  I melted the butter, stirred in the marshmallows until they were melted, stirred in the sweetened condensed milk and then stirred in the chocolate until it was melted. It just took a couple of minutes. I greased a pan and then sprinkled sweetened coconut in the bottom and then poured the fudge mixture in the pan. 

It looks great,tastes fabulous!! Such a creamy texture.

I love this fudge!!!!! The only thing I changed was that I lined a 8x8 pan with parchment paper and after it was all in the pan, I slammed it down to remove air bubbles. Thank you!

As written, it's actually pretty good and super simple. But it wasn't great and I kept wondering what was missing. Then it hit me - vanilla extract! This simple addition totally transforms this to a great fudge!

This was great!  At the suggestion of other reviewers I used mostly milk chocolate chips--2.5 c milk and 0.5 c semi-sweet seems to be the magic combination for me.  I also made it on the stove over a double boiler to prevent burning.

Super easy recipe -- had my 3 year old nephew helping (he was so proud of his fudge!).  Everyone that has tried it has loved it.  We've tried a variety of different flavored chips.  It may not be a "traditional" fudge, but I've had no complaints! :)

I made this for a Christmas treat exchange. I thought it was really good. Very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used 4 cups of semi-sweet and 2 cups milk chocolate chips. Keep it in the refridgerator, it tastes best cold!

Instead of doing this in the microwave I used the stovetop by first melting the butter in the condensed milk then adding the chips and stirring constantly until it was all melted together...absolutely amazing.

Seen this on Facebook thought I would give it an easy try 
It did just taste like a chocolate bar I added some nuts on one side but again just tasted like the chocolate out of the bag

I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and this was the EASIEST and BEST fudge I've ever made!  So simple, and not sickeningly-sweet like most fudge!

Thanks for sharing!  We love this!

this recipe was great I added peacans instead of walnuts and I used all semisweet chocolate chips, it was a dark rich fudge and very creamy but if you want a more mild dark chocolate fudge I would use 1 and a 1/2 cups milk chocolate and 1 and 1/2 semisweet, loved the recipe super easy it a keeper.

I joined solely to write this review; I felt I had to.  This fudge is miraculous.  It is too simple to believe, and the results are spectacular.  The fudge is perfect, even the next day, even straight from the refrigerator.  It is refreshingly not cloyingly sweet.  It is perfect, and it is so easy even a child can literally do it.  Wow!

Fudge too soft.It looks really good but we put the fudge in the fridge overnight and when we took it out this morning it was wet, soft and looked that just melted chocolate. It hadn't harden at all.

I know the purists would say that this is not real fudge, but it the next best thing to really good fudge ( and admit it there is some really rotten fudge out there! 
I also did 2 cups milk chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet chips (ghirardelli) this seemed to work for our tastes.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla at the end just before pouring in in the lined (release foil) pan.   Smooth and delicious. Quick, easy, hard to mess up- now that a good recipe!

Too easy!! I have tried for years to make decent fudge using various popular recipes, to no avail. This fudge is what I have been looking for.  I agreed with some who said it was a little too bitter as written. I tweaked mine - made it with 3 cups milk chocolate chips. It is now a family favorite.

Honestly the best fudge recipe I have ever used. However, it is very rich so I usually use 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate and 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate.

I wasn't too impressed with this.  It turned out the way it should have,but I just didn't care for the texture or taste.  Maybe its because I used ghiradelli semi sweet chips.  If I use this recipe again I think I'll use hershey's milk chocolate chips.

Fantastic!  Semi-sweet chips or milk chocolate chips make it taste very different. Both excellent. I line the pan with foul and spray it. It lifts out easily after then I use my pizza cutter to easily make into squares. Wish I knew fudge was this easy years ago!

best, easiest fudge ever! made this for the holiday and it beat out my mom's long passed-down marshmallow creams recipe. this fudge does taste darker than other fudge, but it's good that way. I added a half tsp or so of peppermint extract which made it extra tasty. I microwaved 2 minutes at a time, stirring in between until everything was melted and combined. then I poured (plopped) it in an 8x8 pan lined with aluminum foil and refrigerated. it was set after 2-3 hours. it's kind of hard to cut when it's cold, but the consistency turned out great. very pleased...easiest fudge ever! very addictive and dangerous. :)

This fudge is SO easy and SO delicious! I made it 1 part semi-sweet to 2 parts milk chocolate chips and added the walnuts in 1 batch. AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe and basically used 1 bag semi sweet chocolate chips and 2 bags milk chocolate per 9x13 pan. I will be making this again and again.

This was a great and easy treat. Just be sure that if you make this you don't microwave it for longer than five minutes because the chocolate chips will cook and stick to the bottom. I really liked that it was such an easy and quick recipe. My family loved it!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dessert platter and everyone loved it! I used milk chocolate chips and stirred in 1 cup of coconut and topped each small piece with an almond. I made a second batch using Reese's peanut butter chips and it was divine!

This was amazing the first time I made it. But I am planning on making another batch, but I'm not eating it right away. How long does it stay fresh and where do I store it?

Made this today for an awards banquet. I used 2 cups of semi-sweet and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips (both  Ghirardelli brand. I microwaved according to directions. The batter melted well and the texture was smooth, but I was worried about hardness. The end product seemed a little soft. I sprinkled top with candy crunchies before cooling. After cooling for 2 hours in fridge I began cutting into 1 inch cubes Still seemed a little soft. I placed cubes in candy-sized paper cups and served on a tray. They disappeared over the course of the banquet, so apparently the fudge was a success.

I tried this recipes and we love it!!!!! Our second batch I used peanut butter in place of butter 1/4 cup and it was awesome both recipes are great with just a bit of a different flavor. I heated the peanut butter with the chocolate and c-milk. Enjoy

This recipe was AMAZING! My whole family loved it, including my daddy,  who hates fudge. I followed one reviewers advice and melted the butter first thing, and the fudge was creamy and rich, not grainy at all. Thanks Dana for this recipe!

I was very impressed with this fudge!  I used salted butter and about 1 cup of semisweet and 2 cups of milk chocolate chips, and it was great.  Helpful hint:  This is great served cold, but not very good at room temperature.  Some of the negative reviews on this site say that it tasted like frosting, and I agree that this is the case when at room temperature.  However, when it was fresh out of the fridge (or even after 45 minutes of being left on the counter), it was wonderful!  I should also note that it wasn't as "fudge-like" as expected as some reviewers noted, but it was wonderful nonetheless.

This was my first time making fudge. I had an idea of the great fudge my Grandmother used to make. This recipe got me about half way there. I used 2 cups white chocolate chips, 2 cups milk chocolate chips. I didn't know that the fudge needs to be "dried" after it comes out of the fridge in the morning. I suggest letting it air out another 8 hours on the counter before cutting into it if you want clean cuts/perfect squares. It had the consistency of my Grandmother's fudge but I think it does need some semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it taste more fudgey/less frosting taste.

Delicious! My family can't keep their hands off.
I read some of the other reviews and only microwaved for a maximum of 3min stopping every 30sec to stir, and added a splash of vanilla. Almond slivers make a good topping to add just before cooling, or stir in during the microwaving.

this was less like fudge and more like a soft, delicious chocolate bar ( i used milk chocolate). Going to try a more traditional recipe.  Thanks for posting.

OMG the best fudge ever. Yes, I do  believe its best with 1 bag semi-sweet and 1 bag milk chocolate chips. Also, melting the butter first makes your fudge more silky and not gritty. I only put about on 1/2 cup of Marshmallows, and no nuts. My 8yr old Grandson who is super picky absolutely loves this recipe.

Easy and delicious! This is the first fudge I've made that actually has that "fudgey texture" you would get from a chocolate or candy store.  It is so easy to make too!  I used an even mix of milk chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips, otherwise I think it would taste too semi-sweet. If you like dark chocolate though, then stick with semi-sweet.  I'd like to try using just milk chocolate next time.

I am not a huge fan of this recipe.  I used Ghiridelli (sp) chocolate chips and even with that the flavor/texture was lacking for me.  I mean it was not horrible, it set up really nicely but I like more of a melt-in-your-mouth type of fudge and this was much stiffer than that.

Fabulous and super-easy. I used 2 c (1 bag) semisweet and 1 c milk chocolate chips; I skipped the nuts. It kept beautifully (at room temperature in an airtight tin), and was a huge hit at work. Thanks!

We love this recipe! I prefer to use milk chocolate chips. Definitely use non-stick foil to line the pan and it pulls off easily and you can cut with a pizza cutter or sharp knife.

Made this recipe with 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate, 1 cup white chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips as well as a cup of almonds. It came out great and allowed me to use the chips I had leftover from other recipes.

So easy! I did not have a microwave so I used a double boiler method. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and lined a pan with foil for easy removal and cutting once set. My husband and kids love it! My son even wants to give some as a gift this year to the ex in laws. Fantastic!

Fantastic, and so easy! I only needed to microwave mine for 3 minutes, stirring once.  I did melt the butter a little first, and added a splash of vanilla.  Everyone LOVED it.  I put aluminum foil down in the pan first, and then just lifted the whole thing out after it was set, and cut them into squares.

I've been making this simple recipes for years, with great reviews. The semi-sweet is too dark for me, so I do a 1/2 & 1/2 with milk chocolate and it comes out great.  My favorite variation, however, uses white chocolate chips w/a little orange zest added at the beginning, and craisens & almonds stirred in at the end.  It's festive, beautiful, and O so good!

With this reciepe; I cooked in a double boiler; melted butter first, added 1/2 bag cut into small pieces of Large CampFire Mashmellows (melted them), then added the chocolate chips and stirred till all melted then poured into the dish covered with wax paper. When I did the same thing a second time, before pouring the mixture into the dish I stirred in crushed up candy canes.

I am not good at candy making, but this was so easy it turned out great even for me.  I used white chocolate chips added about a tsp. of maple flavoring and voila maple fudge.  This is only limited by your imagination.

This is a great fudge for how easy it is. 5 minutes and you're done! It's definitely not the best, creamiest fudge I've ever had but it's yummy and a crowd pleaser. Also, I think it's better with milk chocolate chips, personally. :)

This is a GREAT fudge if you have kids. It's fast and easy. Even though I use a double broiler it still goes much quicker the the fuge I make for friends or family which is much more traditional and time consuming. I have a family of eight so I make loads of treats homemade to save money (and because I LOVE it). This is a good little treat. The only variation I made was to use semi sweet and PURE chocolate chips.... But that's because I like depth instead of sweet (as you would get with milk chocolate) plus the pure pulls a lot of that bitter semi sweet flavor out. But, I would imagen you could do with MANY flavor combinations. Today I stirred in grams and marshmallows and made it into s'more fudge....easy stuff. Thanks!

Super easy!  Remember to remove chips from microwave BEFORE they are fully melted, as they will continue to melt when stirred.  Otherwise, the mixture will curdle.

very good (and easy) recipe. first time making fudge and it came out perfect! boyfriend and coworkers were super happy. i used 2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1 cup semi-sweet chips and melted everything in a pot on the stove, stirring constantly. set it for 4-5 hours and it was awesome!!! not as thick as i'm used to, but wonderfully easy

For a quick fudge, I think this is great.  I would add that the time for my ingredients to melt was only about two minutes.  I just watched for "shiney" chips which signifies that they are melting and then removed and stirred until the butter was completely melted into the mixture and everything was smooth.

I will definitely keep this recipe!  Thanks, Dana!

TOTAL SUCCESS! I am a first time furge maker and I was amazed at how easy this was to make and how silky it turned out. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and it tastes devine.

I used ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and it came out good but something was not quite right and it didn't have the consistency of fudge. I may have not allowed it to set long enough. I didn't know how long was long enough.

This was very good fudge and easy to make but (of course there is a but) I think next time I will substitute baking chocolate as it does melt even easier than chips. Chips are made to hold their shape so they take longer to melt.

Easy, fast and disappears in a flash. What more could you want from fudge? I have made these in a number of different flavors and substituted Reese's baking bits or coconut for the nuts. They're always great!

The name on this could easily be changed to 'easy fudge.'  This is truly foolproof.  I got these 6 oz. little chocolate men in a post-christmas sale for 3/$1.  I used one chocolate man and 1 bag chocolate chips (roughly equaled the right amount of chocolate) and it turned out fantastic.  So easy (and so good) that I subbed mint chocolate chips in another batch and white chocolate and butterscotch chips in another.  No matter what combo I tried, as long as I used 3 cups or 1 1/2 normal sized bags of chocolate chips, it turned out supurb!

Very Simple, Very Easy!  Also, with the simple modifications to they type of chips, flavor variations and additives (nuts, chunk chocolate, fruit) you can go crazy with this stuff!  Try the basic recipe but add a little course sea salt to the top before it sets up.

This fudge was delicious, and so easy to make. I had some leftover Andes Creme De Menthe baking chips, so I used one cup of those and 2 cups of regular chocolate chips. I really was not expecting the fudge to be as good as it is considering how few ingredients there are.

Thank you SOOOO much for this recipe!  We haven't made fudge in years because my kids can't have the dyes found in marshmallow creme.  Yay!  Loved it!  (I made it with 1/3 white chocolate chips to sweeten it up)

Turned out great.  I used a high quality bittersweet chocolate and a homemade condensed milk recipe from allrecipes.  I used this as a fudge topping on a shortbread cookie.  I only needed half the recipe, so the other half was put in a 5x5" pan for fudge.

I wish I could give this more stars. This is the most forgiving recipe for fudge I've found.  I've added milk chocolate, semi sweet and white chocolate chips and all of them have turned out every time. I can't begin to tell you how many times over the holiday I've made this and given it out to neighbors and friends. A BIG thank you! One MUST for me, was to add foil in the bottom of the pan. So much easier to get the fudge out!

Made this fudge, really not for me.  Too dark and bitter tasting.  My fudge was chewing.  This recipe was not for me.

Awesome very easy to make recipe. I put them in the fridge and when they were in there about 30 minutes kind of hard but still soft enough to cut I made the cuts in the fudge and it made it easier to remove when they were fully harden.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and even doubled the recipe as the author says in a 9 x 13 glass dish. It never set appropriately and when I cut into it, it oozed liquid. I knew a quick, easy, microwave recipe would be too good to be true!

I made this recipe exactly as stated; it was so easy and it turned out great.  I love how rich and smooth it is.  I did omit the nuts and sprinkled a little kosher sea salt on top.  To die for!

Oh wow! This fudge is incredible!! I took another reviewer's recommendation and microwaved the butter first, as well as using milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also doubled the recipe. Mine set up very firm - in fact, I need a sharper knife to cut it! It even passed my kids' test, so I know it's good.

This is the easiest, most delicious chocolate fudge ever!  There's no chance of being "grainy" like the fudge I used to make.  A real winner.

I used 16 oz dark chocolate , no butter and 1 oz unsweet  bakers chocolate and cashews...rich and elegant,...I wonder if the butter would have made it even better!  Also, I lined my pan with greased foil making it easy to flip it out of the pan onto a cutting board.  Peel off the foil and cut with perfection using a rocking pizza cutting blade.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! Honestly though, I melt my chips and milk on the stove because I'm afraid of burning it in the microwave. Just thought I would share my favorite variation. My family likes to use white chocolate chips instead. Then add mint extract, green food coloring, and top with crushed candy canes. Makes a great Christmas gift!

What a great recipe! I have made this recipe and variations for a few people (walnut and peppermint). My favorite so far has been peppermint (add 3 tsp peppermint extract). With smashed candy canes, it's so festive.  Although microwave was easier, double boiler made it much smoother. This is my new favorite holiday goodie to make!

I was skeptical. I'm not now! It's excellent and very easy. It's not a truffle, but it's smooth and outstanding! 

Of course I had to change something tho... I substituted one cup of the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips. It added a nice sweet and saltiness to the fudge that everyone really enjoyed. It literally disappeared from the plate.

I am notorious for ruining fudge.  Well, I was skeptical about this easy recipe.  BUT...yay! I followed it exactly and it worked just fine.  I was a little worried when I took the mixture out of the microwave at 3:00.  I could see the liquid pooling inside, but after I gently mixed it, it blended great!  It was easy to pour into the foil lined baking dish and I didn't burn my fingers on the big pot like I always do!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very delicious and easy fudge recipe.  I prefer milk chocolate chips so substituted 2 cups of milk chocolate chips + 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  Pressed chopped walnuts onto top before chilling.  Beautiful presentation for my gift boxes and delicious!

I made this for my very picky 5 year old girl on thanksgiving and she loved it!!! I doubled the batch and she ate a lot of it though it took a week and a half to finish it. I made no changes and won't be making any changes when i make it again on christmas because it was great. Thank you for the great recipe!

It tastes more like hardened ganache rather than fudge. It's just too dark...even if using half milk chocolate morsels. Carnation recipe is better...

I used one cup of butterscotch morsels and 2 cups of milk chocolate morsels and added the walnuts! My mother in law bragged and bragged on how this must have taken me forever at the stove to make. I just smiled and said no 4 minutes in the microwave!! She still doesn't believe me!! LOL

Recipe was easy, set up well... but the fudge that results is way too dense.  It's basically just chocolate... reformed into a glass pan.  I wouldn't make it again.

This is awsome fudge... I have been trying to find this for about 20 years. The only reason I have never tried this recipe is because my mother always told me that I wouldnt like it because of the sweetened condensed milk. She never cared for it. I LOVE IT!!!! Im so glad for the other reviews. Thats what made me try it. Allrecipes is the bomb!!!! Thank you Dana

I tried this recipe with Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips. I did not like how it came out at all! But friends and family who tried it LOVED IT! This fudge isn't the traditional hard fudge I was expecting, but I sure did get a lot of praise! :/

The fudge itself had a good flavor. I even used peanut butter chips and made peanut butter fudge. But the consistency was a little thick. I would have liked it to be softer. My husband loved it, couldn't get enough.

Amazing!!!  I love it!!! Definately use at least SOME milk chocolate chips in it though, otherwise it's rather dark and little too much to handle. i find myself making it over and over because it's just sooooo easy a tasty! it's an easy holiday gift too.

The was so good and super easy to make! I used milk instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips as other reviewers had suggested. Made it for my fiance for Valentine's Day and he loved it!! He said it was just like his Granny's. I will be making this again!

Great recipe! I made this with half choc chips and half peanut butter chips, with some peanut butter chips pressed into the top after I poured it. It was so creamy and yummy. Everyone at work kept going back for more! I cooked mine on the lowest heat in a pan on the stove. I am not good at avoiding burning stuff in the microwave. BEST FUDGE EVER.

This recipe was fantastic, and so easy! You can also make different types of fudge by using different chips--I used some mint chips in a batch and made mint fudge, as well as a regular batch. This was a huge hit with my family!

I loved this easy recipe.  The last few times I made fudge, it was granular.  I used to be able to make perfect fudge, but I guess having kids has stolen some of my abilities!  This fudge totally redeemed me when I took it to my parents' house for Christmas.  My dad kept complimenting me on it and I finally had to come clean with the simple recipe!

Wasn't my favorite ever fudge, but very good, rich, fool proof and easy to clean up. So easy and so good. I use pecans instead and use high quality semi-sweet chocolate chips.

This fudge will probably be my new recipe... I make it every year using the original kraft fantasy fudge recipe but I wanted to try something new... The fudge is pretty rich and I think it's key to use 3 cups rather than just a 12 oz. bag of chips because I suspect only using 1 bag of chips is what ruined my butterscotch fudge. It never set-up...but my peanut butter, semi sweet & semi sweet with walnuts turned out fine and everyone seems to enjoy it.

I don't know what went wrong. I followed the directions exactly but it wouldn't set. I chilled it for hours. Is there a knack to this that I am missing? The flavor was excellent, though.

This came out great. Very tasty. I used milk chocolate chips since I'm not a fan of dark chocolate and it was good. It only took me 2 minutes in the microwave at full power, pulling it out at 30 sec, back in for a minute, and then for another 30.

Chocolatey flavor and easy to make.  I made several batches; mint chips on top, cherries mixed in, toffee crumbles on top, and a peanut butter swirled in.

Perfection! I have never made fudge and don't cook very often. The fudge came out delicious and was so easy to make. . . and cheap! Thank you! Will definitely use this again. Oh! It does help to warm-up the butter before mixing together. And to mix the ingredients a bit before heating and continue mixing while it heats!

Super easy - could make it while supervising my 2 1/2 year old daughter's Christmas crafting. I subbed 2 cups of milk chocolate chips for the semisweet that were asked for, added a touch of vanilla, and omitted the nuts. So creamy. I know some people prefer a grainier fudge - but I've always liked smooth fudge and this was it. Will be a standard fudge recipe in this house. It's rare that we make anything like this, and I'm wishing that I'd seen the recipe and tried it out before buying all my other baking stuff for gifts. I would have just given people tins of fudge. Will definitely do that next year!

Super easy and super yummy!  I just made chocolate and peanut butter fudge for my staff at work this year for Christmas.  It makeds a nice little gift.  I wrapped the fudge in pretty boxes and tied snowflake ornaments to a ribbon.  They loved it!  I will make again for sure :)  Use the wax paper and pizza cutter to make the perfect squares as others suggested!

really quick and delicious! i followed the recipe exactly and turned out just like the picture. i dislike dark chocolate and therefore am in love with milk chocolate but did NOT find  that the semi sweet produced an intense chocolate flavour at all.. i used presidents choice decadent chocolate chunks

I used all milk chocolate chips to make my son happy, and it turned out beautifully.  Creamy, not sandy like some of the others I have made.  Very easy to do.  A good recipe for a child to make, I would think. I wonder if a pinch of salt would add something to the flavor ?

YUM!  This recipe was so incredibly simple and turned out just fantastic!  I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet...my first attempt at making fudge and I must say, it was a success!

Used 2 c milk chocolate chips (Guittard brand) and 1 cup semi-sweet (off brand), and real butter. Really yummy, really easy. Made less thick by pouring into 9x13 pan, into greased wax paper.

I chose the milk chocolate over semisweet, this is so good and so easy.  I want to get creative and make many variations.  This fudge is good on its own but has endless possibilities.

This is a very simple recipe and very easy to remember! I didn't add nuts to mine, and I only used about 2 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate. It wasn't too sweet or too bitter. Delightful!

Here's the thing:  this tasted great and was easy, but the fudge melted really, really quickly and made a crazy mess all over the kids.  Plus, I was looking for a fudge with a bit more grain, if that makes any sense.  This was pretty much a soft candy bar.

Easy to make, but I'd suggest adding a little more butter and much less Chocolate. Mine came out a little too chocolately, and not "fudgey" enough, but thats probably due to an error on my half.

Definitely delicious! I added a tiny bit of milk and some sea salt to give it an extra dimension of flavor and texture and it was simply fabulous. I also mixed it with a hand held mixer after taking it out of the microwave, it gives it an extra smooth, creamy finish. Delicious and sooo easy! Update: Another DELICIOUS variation; buy some dulce de leche or make it yourself and swirl it into some of this fudge. Holy yum. It's incredible. Try it!!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. The only thing I would change - I'd reduce the butter to two or three tablespoons because mine came out a little greasy. I also changed the ratios of chips - I used one cup milk, one cup white, and one cup dark chocolate chips. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I'm going to try making a cookies and cream version of this tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the easiest fudge I have ever made! It only took about a minute and 30 seconds to melt the chips on the microwave. I used Pam baking spray to grease the glass baking dish. Took a couple of hours in the refrigerator for the fudge to set-up and harden. It is DELICIOUS!!! Great gift for giving to friends.

I made a couple of batches after taking the advice from others and it is as close to "boardwalk fudge" as I have found! I used Milk Chocolate chips instead and YUMMY!! Will try other variations with my next batches.

This is such a great recipe - so easy and delicious.  Since I only had one bag of chocolate chips on hand, I used that with 3/4 of the can of condensed milk and 3 T of butter as opposed to 4.  It came out really well and was so good.  You can try this also with the swirly mint/chocolate chips from Nestle.  It gives it a minty flavor or you can always add mint extract.  Either way, this recipe is so versatile and always comes out perfectly!

super easy, super fast!  And it's quite tasty too. not the best tasting fudge out there, but when you are in a hurry it's good enough.  My brother in law requests this fudge all the time, so it's gotta be at least better than just okay :o)  Line your pan with aluminum foil and pull out easy and cut up even easier.  Good luck!!

I'm only a student, but I love to cook and bake, especially bake. I made this fudge for the first time for our class Christmas party and they were DELICIOUS!! My friend couldn't get her fingers out of the box. They melt easily, so it's good to keep them out but put them into the fridge when they start to soften too much. I will definitely make this again, it was delicious!

This is truely the most simple and delicious fudge I have made.  I made several batches with variations.  Mint chips with crushed candy canes on top, Milk choc. chips with walnuts, Semi sweet with coconut.  I can't wait to try peanut butter. My husband used to make fudge ages ago at one of those small candy stores, and he gave it two thumbs up.

After years of watching my mother and aunt slaving over a hot stove and stirring until their arms fell off I can't believe that I can now make fudge just as good with little effort.  I did use 2 cups milk chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I'm not giving this secret away!

This is great fudge! I loved that it was super easy and made creamy fudge every time! I used 2 cups milk chocolate and 1 cup semi sweet. Made this 4 times in 2 weeks. I also crushed up some candy canes put them on the bottom of the pan poured fudge over it and when it set it was very good.

omg, really good.  i love the smooth and creamy texture.  i also opted to make it on the stove, i dont trust microwaves.  i skipped the double boiler and just melted the butter and milk together over medium heat, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and then turned the heat to low and melted the chips in.  when the mixture is almost melted, turn off the heat and add walnuts.  soooo good!!!

This is the best tasting and easiest fudge I have ever made!  Every other recipe I've tried comes out grainy or doesn't thicken(and had to be used as ice cream topping.)I've made my 2nd batch today and it's awesome.

This is basic fudge.  It isn't the creamiest I've ever had, but it was easy too make, and cut up.  I did it plain, but next time I will be adding almonds,coconut, and marshmallows.

This didn't come out like fudge to me at all, tastes like a block of chocolate to me. I maybe had it in the microwave too long because the second time I took it out to stir it, the mixture seemed to be separating. When I put it in the glass pan, it was hard to get it smooth on top. After the fudge set, it looked crackly on top. Even though other fudge recipes may take longer, I would try them over this.

I can't believe how easy this was! My only mistake was to make a second batch in the same dish as I made the first...the second batch seized and I had to throw out...my own fault. I will make again, over and over. Simply perfection!

Way too easy! Making quality fudge used to be a big production with jars of marshallow creme, sugar, coaco powder, and lot of time spent feveriously stirring trying to prevent it all from burning. In under 4 minutes in the microwave I was able to produce fudge with a smooth texture and a rich taste I used milk chocolate chips). Since all you are doing is melting chips, I would suggest setting the power level on your microwave to medium and stirring every minute or so, until melted and smooth.

I cannot believe how easy this was!  It only took about five minutes, and everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  Make sure to keep the pieces separate once you've sliced them or they'll stick back together.  For a Christmas variation I used white chocolate chips, a (small) splash of peppermint extract, and crushed candy cane on top.  The white chocolate takes a bit more effort/time to melt, but it's worth it.

Delicious...Almost Effortless...Quick
Made mine to suit my personal taste...With 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate with some marshmallows and nuts thrown in at the very end.  Added both vanilla and salt.  Used plastic wrap sprayed with a small amount of PAM to line the pan.

5 stars for easiness, 5 for appearance and 4 for taste.  Not the creamiest fudge but it is very tasty and couldn't be simpler to prepare.  Happy Holidays and thanks for the recipe.

I had never made fudge before and had no desire to until I found this recipe. I did NOT change one thing. They were delicious - even better than snicker balls. It was so easy that I stood by while my 8 year old read and completed the recipe. Very friendly and tastes like I spent hours on it. MAKE this recipe!!!

I make this fudge every year and people love it...I get request for it, if they only knew how easy it is...this is the sweet equivalent to the Knorr's spinach dip.  what makes it so good is that everything can be added and it tastes awesome.  I have tried more "serious Fudge" recipes and I think this one taste the same or just as good.  Also baking parchment paper is also good if you don't have foil.

This is yummy fudge.  I made it with fat free sweetened condensed milk and milk chocolate chips.  Not the best fudge I've ever tasted, but definitely very good for the amount of effort.  I would assume it would be even better with the fattened milk.

I've been making this recipe for the past 35 yrs., ever since my mom got a Borden Goodies pamphlet way back in '73. Only difference is now using the microwave. However, I still prefer the double boiler method. My microwave likes to burn chocolate. Ok.......it's me and microwaves don't get along. I even blow-up hot dogs!
This is a super easy recipe and the result is always fantastic! Sure beats standing over a hot stove stirring constantly, or waiting for your concoction to reach the proper temp.
I just love tose recipes that are super easy and super yummy.

Wonderful! I added a layer of carnation carmel for a soft center and another of chopped walnuts-could't keep the kids fingers out of the pan! Smooth and creamy,it is not rock hard nor to soft-this is going in my recipe box for sure!

Easy, fast, and was a hit for the holidays. With one batch, I added 1 cup mini marshmallows at the very end (and tried not to mix too much to prevent them from melting), and topped with 1/4 cup mini marshmallows.  In another batch, I added 1/2  cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup marshmallows.  This is a great basic recipe to add various other goodies.  I love how easy and fast it was to make.  My whole family loved it!

Pretty good, but make sure you serve it chilled, or it gets very soft.
This is tasty, but it's not the exact same texture or taste as fudge from candy shops.

This is by far the simplest, and best tasting fudge recipe I've ever made.  And believe me I have made so many from here.  There is no messing up.  If the sweetened condensed milk is what is making you hesitant about this recipe, just try it.  I absolutely don't like sweetened condensed milk, but in this recipe it is perfect.

It really is THE BEST of the microwave fudge.  I like the creamy texture of this one versus the powdered sugar variety of the other microwave fudge.  I did the 2 cups milk chocolate with 1 cup semi-sweet chip version ... THANK YOU!

This is awesome! I made two batches, one with nuts, and one with peanut butter added. Both are great, but I am in love with the peanut butter version. I did it on the stove because I didn't have a big enough microwave safe bowl.

This is a great condensed milk fudge recipe. I think the addition of the butter makes for a tastier fudge than witout it. I made this with peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips. It was wonderful.

Really yummy, really easy... Only change I'll make is to grease the pan with butter next time- the fudge tastes better without the Crisco flavor! :)

This turned out great- I added 6 crushed peppermint candycanes on the top, and pressed them in lightly right after I poured it into the pan. The peppermint flavor  goes really well with the semisweet chocolate. Great for holiday gift giving.

This was an "ok" recipe if you want to make fudge but don't have the time or the ingredients that are in most other fudge recipes.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't my favorite, either.

Have to agree that this is the easiest recipe for fudge I have ever done, but it just doesn't taste like regular fudge.  It is more like a big chocolate candy bar.  Good in a pinch, but there is just something missing from making it real fudge.

This was great! Super quick and easy, comes together in a flash, and not long to "set." Still, I wouldn't call this fudge, per se, but a close equivalent. Something more along the lines of a candybar. It's just chocolatey goodness. I have made it thrice so far. Once a combo of milk choc. and butterscotch chips (my brother LOVED it), the next time reg. choc. chips with nuts, that was pretty good, and finally, just peanut butter chips, which was not very good at all. This was very disappointing, because pb fudge is my absolute fave. I would say this works better with chocolate. I would also say it's SO not healthy! But worth it, somehow. :)

This fudge is absolutely amazing.  I also tried this recipe by dividing the ingredients in two and using reese peanut butter chips for one half and milk chocolate chips for the other half.  It was delicious and better than any other fudge i have made!

This fudge tasted great, yet the texture didn't come out as I had expected. It was kind of grainy, and more like a brownie. In fact, I was hesitant to put it in the fridge because the mixture didn't look very smooth. It doesn't look like the picture I saw of it and I was a bit dissapointed. But my family liked the taste and I guess that's all that really matters. I will keep trying to perfect this recipe.

This recipe is awesome!!!!  Super easy and delicious, if not for the cooling period, would also be incredibly quick to make and take!!  Many variations could be used by simply adding extratcts or extras after melting.  I decorated the top with Christmas sprinkles and it looked very festive!! Thanks for this recipe which has now become a staple of my holiday baking!!

I LOVE this recipe. It doubles wonderfully. I doubled it and put it in a long jelly roll pan. I also altered it a bit. I used 4 1/2 cups of semi sweet morsels and 1 1/2 cup Ghiradeli unsweetened baking squares. This made for a truly silky rich fudge and not overly sweet. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

I am sorry, but I didn't care for this recipe. I was afraid the semi-sweet taste would be overwhelming so I added 2 cups of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of semi-sweet. It was still too much. I also added about a cup of coconut and that was a good thing. Maybe if I would have used only milk chocolate chips it would have been better. The texture was fine though and it was super easy. My only complaint was the semi-sweet taste. My husband took the entire batch to work and they devoured it. It was a hit at his job.

It could be the chocolate chips that I used that failed to cause the fudge to set properly. Making it was easy enough, but even after chilling in the fridge for more than a day, the fudge was not firm enough to keep its shape when cut. Taste was yummy though. Maybe I will try again with a different brand of chocolate chips. Thank you for posting.

My boyfriend thought I had bought a tin of fudge from (gourmet chocolate shop in my area)! He was so surprised and thrilled when I told him I had made it myself. (lol)Very rich and yummy fudge that was so easy to put together. I did melt/mix everything on the stove rather than the microwave - but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This was so easy and so good--no waiting for sugar to melt in a saucepan.  It melts in your mouth too.  I want to play around with it next time to see if I can get a peppermint ribbon running through it because then it will be very, very similar to the chocolate mint pieces that Crate and Barrel would sell in tins at Christmastime.  Thank you for the recipe.

I'm giving this 4 because pretty much everything chocolate is good! This just tasted like melted & formed chips to me. If that's what you are looking for, this is it! Me, personally, I like a different texture for my fudge. Very easy. I used 2 c. milk chocolate chips & 1 c. semi-sweet. They still were pretty dark, as another reviewer said.

Quick and easy recipe. I like to use dark chocolate chips with 1/4tsp of either peppermint or raspberry extracts. It's always a hit and so fast to make it's my go to for bake sales and holiday gifts for friends and family.

Made 2 separate batches; the 1st using the exact recipe and the 2nd using the exact recipe ingredients, but adding 1 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1 cup of chopped salted peanuts. I microwaved in 1 minute increments, then stirring extremely well. This method took more time and effort; however, the results were very creamy and no chocolate breakdown.

Great texture and taste!  I used Gharadelli 60% Bittersweet Chocolate chips and it was rich without being grossly sweet.  Halved the recipe and added a peanut butter layer on top.  Delightful!

Good, but too dark chocolate for me. But I feel like it would make a fabulous frosting on a chocolate cake or on brownies! Mine came out pretty stiff right off, so if anyone has any tips on how to make it a little more spreadable for a cake I'd love to hear them.

I didn't have enough walnuts for the recipe, but still wanted to break up the chocolate a little bit, so I used a cup of sunflower seeds instead. Super yummy, and added bonus: my little cousin who has a nut allergy was able to have some too!

I make a recipe like this every Christmas. Except I melt it on the stove in a heavy saucepan under medium heat until it’s melted. This prevents scorching or burning.

Tasted great! Heres how I did mine: double boil it as the microwave seemed to over cook often. I used 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate and 1/2 cup caramel chips. Added walnuts and stirred, put in the pan then sprinkled with kosher salt.

I make this recipe every year. It is so versatile - sometimes I add Ande's Mint chips, peanut butter chips, or crushed candy canes. You can actually add just about anything you want. It's such an easy and delicious fudge.

A lot of people complained about this being rubbery or tasting like chocolate chips not fudge. I 100% believe that the quality of chocolate you use will determine the outcome. If you used cheap chips containing wax or lots of ingredients then yes it’s not going to be any good. 
I used 3 ingredient real chocolate from tollhouse and real chocolate chunks from Trader Joe’s, both semi sweet. USE REAL CHOCOLATE. 
Beautiful texture and taste! 

I would recommend melting the butter first, I ran into this being an issue in the microwave,  using a double boiler method instead of microwaves would probably fix a lot of this as microwaves are not an even heat. 
Otherwise fantastic recipe!

Very easy, in fact it couldn't be easier.  I remember my mother making fudge with powdered coco, water, sugar, and a whole lot of stirring!  It was delicious!  This fudge is so good!  It's just like my mother made only a whole lot easier!  Yum!

It's not bad for a very easy and quick recipe. I did add a little cold coffee and 1 tsp of vanilla so it doesn't taste like just melted chocolate chips. I also used the old pyrex blow over hot water in a sauce pan to avoid accidentally burning the chocolate.

Remember to grease the pan! Yikes.....I forgot, dumped everything in and had to take it out to grease the pan! Anyway, it is very easy to make. I did add a few marshmallows (Rocky Road). Based on other reviews about it being just chocolate-y I added 2 T vanilla extract. That seemed to help. Next batch I make I will add peppermint extract instead. Thank you for a simple, quick recipe. Remember to grease the pan! LOL

I added 1/4 cup hazelnuts, 1/4 cup walnuts, 1 cup marshmallows, and 1/2 cup  heath crumbles. Best fudge I've ever hard! I will use more nuts next time and not stir the marshmallows in as much next time.

Followed the recipe exactly. Took 3 minutes in the microwave but this is not fudge. The consistency is smooth not fudgey, tastes like chocolate chips. I feel like I wasted 3 cups of good chips for this attempt. Will never waiver from a true fudge recipe again.

I’ve been making this fudge for my family for about 30 years! It turns out perfectly every single time and everyone loves it! I use real butter, never margarine. The only change I make is to add a teaspoon or so of vanilla when I am beating it. Be sure to very thoroughly beat it by hand until it becomes uniformly smooth and very glossy. It’s so easy to make and delicious that I’Ive not made old-fashioned fudge since I was given this recipe!

This fudge was a breeze to make! We have dairy allergies in our house, so to make it dairy free I simply used coconut sweetened condensed milk and Earth Balance butter. Now, it didn't set hard. It set, but it remained soft enough where it wouldn't splinter if I cut it and it would get melty if you handled it too long. I don't know if this is because I'm making it dairy free, or if it's the recipe, or what, but if you make this dairy free, I'd make sure it was served right out of the fridge or somehow kept cool. Just to keep it firmer.

This is a great recipe. Easy peasy. Also lends itself well to different types of chips. I’ve done this with different flavored chips and it’s great. I will sometimes half the recipe and use semi sweet chips and sea salt caramel chips (by Hershey) and then mix the two for a marble effect. This had been a crowd favorite. Then when done, I’ll press the remaining sea salt caramel chips into the top. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Wish this had been a stovetop recipe. microwaved it for 2 minutes in my normally super weak microwave  and my chocolate was ruined, just turned into an overcooked mess. Mind you this is a microwave that normally take a minute and a half to melt cheese. But that's just how microwaves are, unpredictable (and sometimes chocolate ruining) machines when it comes to cooking stuff.

It tasted okay, but had an oily butter sheen and the edges had bits of solid butter. Perhaps I should have put it in the microwave longer - I believe I did 4 minutes

It tastes decent and is a good texture, but it's just a bit too strong for my liking. Tastes like dark chocolate instead of the usual milk chocolate fudge taste, so a little overwhelming. Will definitely use milk chocolate next time instead of the semi-sweet chocolate.

I used milk chocolate chips and added a half bag of coconut.  It tasted just like an almond joy candy bar.

Easy, BUT BUT BUT this was way too dark chocolate-ey and tasted exactly like semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also, it was very hard and honestly felt like I was eating chocolate chip squares. Next time, try just 2 cups of chocolate chips.

Was very good. I took it to my daughter who loves mint. I added a bit of peppermint extract and crushed some peppermint over the top. I hate baking and this was perfect for me to make.

This recipe was so easy and so good. Everyone was so impressed and commented on how smooth it was (not at all grainy). I decided to make it on the stovetop with low heat. I made 2 versions. The first I used about 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup Andes mint chocolate baking chips. I sprinkled a few on the top because the green was pretty. The other batch I did a full chocolate recipe and put in in the fridge to start to set. Then I made another batch but used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. I then poured on top of the chocolate. Delicious!

I made a couple batches of fudge for Christmas. I recommend using mini chips. Thankfully I found some Eagle brand caramel flavored sweetened condensed milk. The semi-sweet chocolate and caramel tasted great together. Stir often!

Ridiculously easy and a huge holiday hit! Variations after reading other reviews: prepared on stove top; melted butter first, then stirred in milk, then added chocolate chips; did a 1:1 of peanut butterc: semisweet and did another batch of milk chocolate : semisweet + added crushed candy canes to the mixture while stirring and sprinkled more on top. Soooo yummy!

The flavor of this fudge is great. It's easy and fast to make. My kids actually did it.  However the texture wasn't what I like in fudge. It was smooth, but too dense and kind of greasy. Plus it sweat at room temperature which seemed weird.  I'm looking for another recipe, but will let the kids use this one again I think.

Easy to make, but too much like dark chocolate. After tasting it I read reviews with the exact same complaint. Will try milk chocolate next time and maybe a cup of white chocolate

pretty good but a little sweet to be fudge. I would use fewer chocolate chips than the recipe said. Overall still a great recipe for beginners.

It makes a wonderful batch of fudge regardless of the type of chips you use to make it. It's now my basic recipe to which I can build upon with. 

For my first batch I made it with sea salted caramel chips and ran out so used 1/3 of a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.

This is wonderful. Thank you!

I made it exactly like the recipe but I will definitely change the recipe for the future. Overall if was okay, but the chocolate taste was way too strong and just tasted like regular chips from the bag, and ended up a little grainy. I'll probably use a mixture of chips next time, and melt it for a little less time.

Very easy to make but the let down for me was the texture aka it didn't go hard (it was quite sticky) and it was kind of bland too. If I were to try it again I would add in some cocoa or experiment with other flavors.

It was very delicious, but a little to rich and to much chocolate so I added a few drops of mint extract to give it a little other flavor so that all you tasted wasn’t just the chocolate.

This recipe was so good. I would totally recommend double boiling all the ingredients instead of microwaving them. Even though it took a little longer, there was no chance of burning it and it came out so silky. Will definitely make again!

Oh my GOODNESS! Superb! Whoever composed this recipe: genius! Full proof fudge! With only three ingredients? I hadn’t added nuts. Nothing could be simpler and it is super delicious! I used TollHouse semi sweet chocolate chips and it was super good. I may try (another review suggested) Ghirardelli chocolate. I’m about to make 1/2 batch and may add peanut butter!

I understand that some people just “enjoy “ making fudge the old fashioned way and that’s great. I’ve always been a fudge person and this fudge is great!! I used 2 cups of Ghiradelli chips and one cup of Reese’s peanut butter-chips. Wow. Nuke it for 2 minutes and stir real well.  One more minute and it was done. Lined my pan with plastic wrap and boom it came right out. I think it’s perfect fudge.

I made this fudge for a baking contest in my foods class for a cupcake wars. We took the fudge and put it in the center of the cupcake. And we won first place.
I think the fudge really made it good. 
Hands down the best  fudge

I made a change with the semisweet chocolate chips by only adding half of them then replacing the other half with peppermint chips instead. other than that it was great!

I made it following the recipe the first time but using mini dark chips and loved it! The next batch after it was out I mixed in crushed Candy canes and a batch with walnuts. Hands down the candy cane was the winner with my family though they ate all of it and have asked me to make this once a week it’s so easy i will make it more than just Christmas now

It was great and super easy. Came out exactly as I would expect fudge to. Not grainy, very smooth... it was maybe a smidge stiffer than most fudge I've had, but that could be the dark chocolate chips.
I used 2 cups of semi-sweet chips and 1 cup of dark chocolate chips, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Took like 10 minutes to make and came out delicious... what more could you want from a recipe?

Used 2 cups milk chocolate chips, 1 cup semi-sweet. Added all to a saucepan and melted down over low heat on my stove. Added 1 t vanilla at end of melting time. Did not add nuts. Poured into foil lined (no stick foil) 8 X 8 inch pan. Was very good and easy. Won 2nd place at my work for holiday dessert.

Made this with my grandson for him to gift his dad and our neighbors. Great recipe for a kid and for busy time of year. We followed the directions exactly as it was first time.
We used a pan wide strip of greased parchment paper with 'ears' in the glass pan, easy to loosen ends and lift out the whole cake for cutting. Packaged in little tin cookie boxes made a great gift.

it tastes good but came out way too sticky and kept melting. I couldn't get it out of the pan. I made another batch without the butter and added some vanilla extract. it was much, much better.

I have made this several times now - yum! We use all kinds of chips (mint, peanut butter, white chocolate, dark chocolate...) and various add-ins (nuts, crushed candy canes...). It always turns out positively delicious!!! It takes less time to melt in our microwave than the recipe calls for (more like 2-3 min) so keep an eye on it and as soon as everything melts stop - you don't need it to boil or anything. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy and delicious- I always read reviews before I try a recipe and took the advice of some- I used two cups of milk chocolate and one cup of bittersweet chips- melted the butter first, then added the ingredients. I added a 1/8 tsp orange extract and then the walnuts- YUMMMMMMM.  Will do this always for my fudge fix and experiment with flavors. Oh and I did this recipe on the stove top on medium- keep stirring - done in as little as 4 minutes.

I made 2 batches of this in  1 day... it was super easy!
The first batch, was your plain jane chocolate, no nuts. It was delicious, but like other's have said, I'll probably start mixing up different types of chocolate chips to make it fudgey-ier tasting.

The second batch, I mixed 1/2 peppermint chips & 1/2 semi-sweet chips, and got a delicious fudge that tasted similar to a thin mint cookie. I have a feeling that will be one heck of a hit this holiday season. 

One last recommendation -- microwave it in 30s to 1m intervals, stirring in between each one. the first one I microwaved in 90s intervals, and by the end, it was a little "grainy" (but still tasted delicious).  It took no more than 3 minutes of microwaving for mine to be ready to pour. It was also hardened enough to be cut after just a few hours in the fridge. If you're doing a day-off holiday dessert --- this is a perfect one!!

No fail fudge. I’ve been making this for several years. It never disappoints. I actually melt everything in a sauce pan. I find it easier that constantly stirring it in and out of the microwave. I typically use 1/2 milk and 1/2 semisweet chocolate. I always add a splash of vanilla at the end. Line with foil for easy cutting. Love this recipe.

This isn’t fudge it’s frosting. I have made many different fudge recipes and they all turned out great. I made this one perfectly but it tasted just like frosting.

This is perfect fast fudge. No, it’s not ‘old fashioned’ fudge, but who has the time? Not me. It turns out creamy, glossy, and lovely. I like to stir in a cup of peanut butter chips at the last moment before putting it in the pan. I frequently use half milk chocolate chips if there will be mostly kids eating it.

So simple and took no time at all. It turned out silky, set up like it should and just has that, "I stood over the stove and stirred this for an hour" flavor. Will not disappoint. I used a combination of milk chocolate and semi-sweet because that is all I had and it didn't seem to harm the recipe.

Incredible!  Definitely tastes like it took much longer to make then it took.  I followed the directions and I stirred it at one minute increments for a total of three minutes and it turned out perfectly.  Hardest part was getting it out of the pan after it set up I will try a silicone pan next time.  I am sure I will make this recipe over and over for years to come.

It was absolutely delicious! Made it for Thanksgiving and it was very easy to make. The only thing was, it turned out to be a little grainy. I cooked the chocolate chips for the time it says and if I would've gone longer it would've started to burn. So the end result was a little gritty.

I love this fudge recipe. Although, I suggest using parchment paper instead of aluminum foil. It's just easier. This recipe is so easy to add nuts, caramel, candys, and so much more! So easy and yummy.

No self-respecting True Southern woman should make this recipe if you are used to real fudge.  This tastes just like the chocolate morsels you use to make it.  I will never make this again and I will never try to cheat on real fudge.  
So disappointed in this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was amazing. Rich and delicious. A big hit. Would lend itself well to flavors. I will do this at Christmas and add mint, and I have a big bag of toasted coconut that I'll add to my next batch. Might try this with milk chocolate chips as well. Maybe white chocolate too.

Don't microwave it. It dries the chocolate chips out. Put everything in a pot and cook on low until melted.

Those that say it taste like eating chocolate  chips well you are silly so I decided to bump up the flavor a bit. first I took the advice about melting the butter first. I used 1 cup of semi sweet and 2 cups of milk ghirardelli chocolate, when I make it again I will use semi sweet ghirardelli  chocolate, I also added about a loose cup of peanut butter and the same of that marshmallow fluff stuff a splash of a good vanilla. someone also mentioned using salted butter is a must, well I never have salted butter in my house so I did use unsalted I agree some salt normally is good to balance out the chocolate so may be next time ill use a pinch but I felt mine came out just fine with unsalted. I only buttered the pan and it came out ok but this time I will use some parchment just to make life a bit easier, over all my house hold inhaled this I cant remember what old fashioned fudge tasted like to compare it to this and dont feel the need to do so what ever this is it was great. I know I did not follow your recipe to the letter but thanks so much for posting I would never had made this with out your suggestion and all the advice that followed.

Best fudge recipe. So easy and so delicious. You can get creative with adding nuts and different flavours of chocolate chips (e.g. Peppermint, maple etc.!)

It was very easy to make and turned out delicious. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet after reading the reviews because I prefer a lighter chocolate

Update-made it again and this time doubled the recipe. Still melted butter in pan, added milk and then chips. This time I used Nestle mini semi sweet chocolate chips. Melted and mixed beautifully on the stove on medium- low. Had to constantly stir the mixture. This time added caramel bits and chopped pecans to make "turtle fudge". Poured and pressed into a 9 x13 pan lined with foil. Fudge was very smooth with no graininess. Waiting for it to cool and set.... can't wait!!!

I made this using 2 c semisweet chocolate chips, 1 c heath milk chocolate pieces, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, 3T butter (because that was all I had). Once cooled a bit, I put a little sea salt on the top. Everyone loved this!

I halved the recipe, just to try it.  I didn't measure accurately so it never got hard--too much butter. But it's delicious and my son, daughter in law and granddaughter loved it.

This recipe is PERFECT!!!!  it literally takes only one minute in the microwave to make. It comes out tasting like the fudgy by in the mall. I need it to make some fudge for a sweet sale at my son school. We mixed marshmallows into the fudge and cut it into thick slices to sell. People went crazy over this!!   This is my only fudge recipe!

I made this recipe and it turned out great! It tastes very yummy and it is super easy to make.  :)

I'm surprised some people are saying theirs didn't set up correctly, because mine did have the correct fudge texture. Although, the only microwave safe dish I had accidentally got broken, so I cooked mine on the stove.

Also, I put vanilla extract in mine. I also added nuts to the inside of it and sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts on top.

Next time I make it I am going to try using Andes Mint Chocolates instead of chocolate chips to see if that will get it a nice minty flavor for a nice change.

I let it set up in the fridge for 3 hours but found it impossible to cut once I was ready to serve it.  I had to use a spoon just to rake it off of the foil that I lined the pan with.  It was a mess to try to eat!  It was smooth and had a decent taste although not equivocal to real candy fudge.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I melted the butter before adding the remaining ingredients and also was careful not to let the combined mixture boil during heating.  It was fine for a quick dessert but next time I'll opt for my family fudge recipe instead.

I followed the recipe and got a hard, dry blob. It was not sweet or creamy. It didn't taste like fudge. Only taste was semi sweet chocolate. I could have saved the effort and eaten the morsels straight out of the bag.  I plan to coarsely grate this mess and use for baking chocolate chips because I hate wasting food and $$.

I love this recipe!! Made it with my kindergarteners at school. It was so easy and turned out great! I also used milk chocolate because of other reviews. But I made a batch with peanut butter and milk chocolate mixed together and that was my favorite.  Again, because of other reviews, I melted the butter first. In the past when I have melted chocolate chips in the microwave I've had problems with it so I thought this might help them to melt better.  Good tip. I had no problems with it setting up, having the texture of a chocolate bar or it tasting  like I was just eating a chocolate chip from the bag. The kids all loved it and so did the many adults who tried it. We all said this will be our new fudge recipe.

The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. Change it to 1tbsp as it didn't set as easily as it should have. It was harder to cut because it was so soft

This is my favorite fudge recipe because it's so easy.
I added white chocolate chips for decoration at Christmas.
The very best way to use this recipe, IMHO is using the dark chocolate chips by Nestle.  It turned out so scrumptious I almost ate the entire batch by myself!
This is an "old school" recipe, one my mother used way back (in the '60's); just goes to show how good and easy to prepare it is, it's still being used today.

It didn't taste quite like fudge. It was a little too soft. I think I'll try a true 'candy' method next time.

Yes, it is quick and easy. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near the consistency of real fudge. It's like eating a block of chocolate chips with walnuts.

I used this recipe with my classroom. We five batches altogether and each one turned out very well! We added peppermint, crime de menthe, and rum extract to three of the batches. The oils work the best for flavoring. We even melted white chocolate chips with red or green food coloring to decorate the tops. When stirring look for the chocolate mixture to get shiney...that helps to know you are getting near done. Our batches took 4 minutes in the microwave. The kids got rave reviews from the parents and teachers who received the fudge as gifts!

This is my go-to easy fudge recipe when I want to bring something homemade and don't have much time. The best part about it is the flexibility. You can make all sorts of combinations and flavors by getting different chips. The only challenge is to not ever let the chips boil or you might get a grainy fudge. Having room temperature butter or chopping cold butter into chunks will help everything come together at the same time. I check and stir every  minute. When the last of the chips are no longer visible, you are ready to pour into a buttered dish. (No veg. oil spray for taste reasons.) In my most recent batch, I got Andes mint candy chips (2 cups in bag) and added a cup of semi-sweet chips to make a mint chocolate fudge. I kept a couple tablespoons of the Andes chips out to top the fudge so people would know it was mint. I like to use a milk chocolate chip, and the better the chip quality, the better your fudge will be. I have swirled this with a microwave peanut butter fudge, and it makes a nice-looking, yummy fudge. Another tip: Add the walnuts by sprinkling them on top and slightly mashing down after you spread the fudge in the pan. You can have two kinds of fudge in one pan and make the walnut-haters happy!

I used half semi sweet and half bittersweet bakers chocolate which I cut into smaller chunks. I placed everything on a saucepan and melted on low. Definitely line pan with parchment. The quality of the fudge will definitely depend on what type of chocolate used.. So make sure it's a good one. This is a creamy melt in your mouth fudge opposed to a grainy sugary one.

This was the easiest and most quick setting fudge I have ever made. I flunked the batch and used half milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips. It was setting before I could get it in the pans. It taste so creamy and rich at the same time. I used my stove because I don't have a microwave. Put the saucepan on medium heat, melted butter first then added sweetened condensed milk then chocolate chips. Poured it into lined 9x11 glass pans and put in the fridge. It will go great on my Christmas candy plate giveaways. Thank you for this awesome and fast fudge recipe. Do you have a peanut butter fudge recipe that is this easy?

This recipe is so good and ridiculously easy.  My husband accidentally purchased caramel condensed milk which made it taste kind similar to coffee.  VERY GOOD!   We made it again today and used peanut butter chips and chocolate condensed milk.  Did not know they made the flavored milk....mix it up and have fun!

definitely easy enough, but definitely not real fudge either. I put orange extract in and topped it with coarse sea salt. it's a good recipe for a quick fix but nothing special.

This turned out great. I didn't have any nuts, so I stirred in some extra chocolate chips right before I spread it in the pan. My family loved it.

Fantastic & easy recipe....thank you! So much easier and creamier than fudge made with marshmallow. I made it on the stove top over low heat since my microwave broke, and I used 1 & 1/2 cups milk chocolate morsels and 1 & 1/2 cups peanut butter morsels. I will be sure to make this again with different flavors!

This was so fast and easy, but more importantly  everyone loved it! Heeding the advice of other reviewers, I used half Nestle Semisweet chips and half Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe and added walnuts to one dish and mini-marshmallows to the other. Both were a huge hit and the whole process took less than 10 minutes!

Be careful not to melt it too long or it can seize. If it does seize add a tablespoon of heavy cream, mix well, and heat for 30 seconds. I use parchment paper to line the pan. Nice to add nuts or miniature marshmallows. Also good topped with a layer of peanut butter.

Great flavor, but rather soft. It REQUIRES refrigeration. If left out of the fridge, it will become difficult to eat without a spoon.

yummy and very easy recipe. I microwaved the butter + milk only for 1:30m, then stirred in the chocolate. It's warm enough to melt the chocolate without overcooking it. I've also made several variations:
chocolate mint swirl, family fav (swirl: white chocolate + mint flavouring & food colouring);
choc +peanut butter swirl;
white choc, white choc-mint (aka candy cane, with red food dye swirled in).
thanks for sharing :) cheers

Instead of using the microwave, I melted the butter and then chocolate in a double boiler, and added the sweet and condensed milk when the chocolate was melted. The butter to chocolate ratio is off, and the fudge turned out grainy. If I were to use this recipe again, I'd use more butter

Yum! That's all I can say! This recipe is so easy but still results in a delicious, creamy, and decadent fudge. When you are cutting it, make sure to use a disposable plastic knife and even spray the knife if needed because it is very sticky. My friend and I made this for a lemonade stand/bake sale we did and couldn't stop eating it! Enjoy!

Hubs asked for fudge, so I made this for him pretty quickly.  He wanted peanut butter added, so I added about a quarter of a cup of crunchy pb, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm happy it was quick; he is happy he got fudge.  The toddler liked her taste too.  All around winner in our house.  :o)

I am a big fudge fanatic. If you want fast and easy this is it.  If you prefer a truer fudge taste and texture, keep looking.  Old fashioned prep will yield a better flavor.

Awesome! Just be sure to be careful when microwaving your chocolate or it'll end up cooked! I like to use 1 cup each of semisweet, white, and peanut butter chips and sprinkle some crushed oreos on top!

If any recipe ever qualified as a "No fail" recipe, this is it! SO EASY to make and SO DELICIOUS to eat!
I ended up making three kinds of fudge by buying three different types of chips: milk, white, and peanut butter. I layered all three for mine, but they were also delicious separately!

My husband has made this a couple times. An easy way to avoid over-cooking the chocolate is to stir every minute, paying careful attention to get the corners.

I also like to rub the pan down with a thin layer of coconut oil before adding the fudge for flavor as well as easy cleaning later.

I made this strictly on impulse.  Consequently, I only had 1 bag of chocolate chips (2 cups), so I substituted white chocolate chips for the remaining cup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes AMAZING!!  I'm giving it 4 stars on ease & taste alone!

Pinch of salt
1/4 tsp of Vanilla Extract
1/4 cup of sweetened almoand milk to add flavor

Very simple to make, and very creamy and rich.  One little 1x1 inch square was enough to satisfy any chocolate craving!  I tried using the regular sweetened condensed milk, the way the recipe is written - and it was perfect.  I followed the suggestion of another cook who said they melted butter first, and it was great.  It is thick, so you have to spread it in the pan a bit.  

I also tried a second batch and tried the new caramel version of Eagle brand sweetened, condensed milk.  I liked it, but wow - was it rich.  I still preferred the batch made with  regular sweetened, condensed milk, best.

I really enjoyed making this simple dessert.  At first I actually had a few problems.  My first batch I totally burnt the chocolate.  For my re-try batch I used a simple, bowl on bowl double boiler to melt together my butter and the chips.  Not as fudgy as I though it would be but it was still good.

Good for quick fudge - obviously the marshmallow creme one is better, but this is tasty.  Cut it cold, but eat at room temperature or it tastes like a block of chocolate chips.  At room temp it does melt in your mouth.

It's a good recipe, though I only microwave for 1 minute and let the heat of my bowl help the chocolate melt, also good if you do half milk chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips.

If you like dark chocolate, this recipe is perfect, not too dark and not too sweet, just right.  I made it exactly as posted. Will definitely make it again.   I took the advice from someone else about making sure it didn't boil so it didn't turn grainy.  I wasn't sure of the strength of the microwave I was using so I melted it at 40% power instead of 50%, just in case.   Turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing.

This turned out great. I ended up making it when a traditional fudge recipe failed on me and I was stuck with limited ingredients and limited time. This recipe saved my skin. It was so easy and, though it's not exactly the same as traditional fudge, it's very good! So easy that I don't know if I'll ever try that original fudge recipe again...

If you want to make a chocolate chip bar then use this recipe but if you want "fudge" don't use this recipe. This recipe didn't have the consistency or taste of fudge it legit just tastes semi sweet chocolate chips.

It took around 3 min to fully melt so it wasn't grainy as some comments I read. Its smooth and setting up. It has a good creamy flavour so far. I don't like a crystalized fudge so this should be OK.  I also mixed one milk chocolate bag of choc chips with a unsweetened one and its just right. Reminds us of a chocolate bar so small pieces will do :-) thanks!

I did 2 cups butter scotch and 1 cup semi sweet chocolate, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and cooked in a sauce pan instead of microwave to prevent it from burning and getting grainy....and it was wonderful!! Set perfectly, great consistency.

Yummy! Though mine was a bit hard to cut into slices. I put wax paper into the pan before pouring the fudge into it so it wouldn't get stuck in the pan. Seemed to work. I either didn't wait long enough before cutting it or mine were too thin.

This was the best and easiest fudge I've ever eaten and had many compliments. I used milk chocolate chips, and added chopped macadamia nuts that were amazing. Instead of spreading in a pan though, I spooned into a silicone sheet of 1" round candy molds. All I had to do was wait for them to cool then turn over and pop them out. Easy as could be. This will be a family favorite!

Very easy to make and very tasty. I didn't use the microwave. I used a double boiler and first melted the butter. Then I added the condensed milk and let it heat through. Then the choc chips. They melted quickly, easily and smoothly. Did peanut butter chips for pb fudge and it too was fabulous.

This was a very good fudge for how quick and easy it was. The trick is to melt the butter before heating the rest of the ingredients, and letting it sit at room temperature overnight to achieve the creamy consistency. I did this after chilling for a few hours in the fridge.

I made this as instructed without the nuts.  I agree with other commenters that using all semi-sweet chocolate makes for a very dark chocolate fudge.  I also agree with other comments that the consistency is different than traditional fudge.  This fudge is more soft-form.  It tastes good,and will get eaten, but I think I will try a different fudge recipe next time.

Made this because my daughters are coming home for Christmas with chocolate cravings. After 2 hours in fridge still soft. So I scooped out balls with ice cream scoop roller in crushed pecans and cashews ,froze for an hour . Then using tooth pick to dip into white almond bark.

Easy, easy easy!  Me and my girls made this recipe.  Like others I foil lined the pan greased with butter.  Instead of mixing the walnuts into the fudge we used it as a topping since one of the girls don't like nuts.

Turned out perfect my first time at making fudge.  I would like it to be just a little sweeter otherwise it would be a 5 Star.  I lined the pan with parchment paper which saved on clean up.  Adding the nuts to another batch we're making next.

After reading the reviews, I made it as directed with the multiple suggestions of using half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate Ghiradelli chips. The sweetness was good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was incredibly fast. You just dump everything in a bowl and microwave it (only took me 1:30 plus an additional 0:30). It will fix the craving for fudge, but I wouldn't rely on this recipe for impressing anyone. It really does just taste like softened chocolate chips. If it weren't lightning fast and easy to make, I would've only given it 3 stars but there is something to be said about a recipe that says fast and easy- and is. So if you just want a quick sweet that resembles fudge somewhat, this is your best pick. If you want something that tastes like how fudge does in your mind, you will need to find a recipe that does not say "fast and easy".

I love this recipe. It is exactly like my great grandmother's fudge. I candied whole almonds which added an extra layer of sweetness. I also use milk chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet and used a double boiler instead of the microwave which helped decrease the chance the butter/chocolate would burn. And I used 3 tbsp of butter  to make it creamier.

I personally don't like this recipe, it's a little too rich for me. However my dad loves it. This is the only thing he asks for as a Christmas present and usually half of it is gone before the day is over. I don't microwave it, though. Instead I do everything on the stove.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago, and have since made probably a dozen batches of it every year for Christmas gifts (along with jams) for neighbors, friends, the postal carrier, the UPS drivers, etc. I've made it with all kinds of chips; PB and chocolate mixed, white chocolate, butterscotch, dark chocolate. I've also added in all kinds of stuff instead of nuts, like crushed candy canes, toffee chips, crushed sandwich cookies, etc. I've never had any batch fail.

The timing is way off. The first time I made it, it turned out grainy and nasty. The chocolate had seized. I remade it. That time, and every time since,  I microwaved it for 1 minute, stirred, microwaved 30 seconds more, stirred and then microwaved for 30 seconds more. It was totally done.  I love this fudge. It's SO easy and tastes great.

A very easy recipe! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet and mixed in about 4 oz. of marshmallow fluff. And I did it over low heat on the stove top rather than in the microwave - easier to control the heat. It turned out fantastic!

I made it on the stovetop with double boiler and it was thick to pour. Regardless, the flavor is too dark and just tastes like chocolate chips.

I made this with my 3yo last year.  It's easy enough for a three year old to (help) make.  Instead of walnuts, we put a layer of marshmallow in the middle.  But the "fudge" just tastes like slightly sweeter chocolate chips, and is as hard as a Hershey bar.

This was a big hit with my girlfriend and the nurses I made it for who took care of me. I made 1 small change - I placed mini peanut butter cups in the bottom of the pan, spooned in the mixture, leveled it out and then added more mini peanut butter cups on top. I let set over night in the fridge and cut up in to big and small bites the next morning.

I made this recipe! It was super easy and super good! In fact, when I took it to work to share with my colleagues, I put a warning label "VERY RICH!" on it. In spite of the warning, the fudge didn't last the day! The only thing I did differently is that I melted everything in a pot; it came out just fine. This is a great recipe!

I have made this fudge for several years, I have several variants of it.  Use the Creme de Mint chips instead of the chocolate chips for a wonderful Mint fudge, Stir in a cup of marshmallows with the nuts for a Rocky Road Fudge, add orange extract instead of  vanilla for a wonderful orange chocolate

Really easy recipe!  I loved that all of the ingredients were ones I normally keep in stock. 

 I opted to  put the ingredients in a saucepan on medium-low heat. The trick with this technique is to constantly stir the mixture, so that the chips don't clump together or stick to the sides of the pan. 

The aluminum foil tip seems like a good idea. However, I chose to stick with the grease method for this first batch.

This will make a perfect holiday treat.

I have been making this recipe for years now.  I make it following the exact directions and it always comes out scrumptious!  I make several batches to share with our neighbors at Christmas and a neighbor just asked me to bring some over for a "finger food" party!  Will always use this recipe for "my fudge".??

It was my first time making fudge and I tried this recipe. It was delicious and easy to make. Taste like the candy store fudge. Thank you for the recipe.

I have made this twice and both times it came out excellent. It was easy to make but at the same time decadent, creamy and delicious. Tip: make sure to cut into small pieces as you don't want it to be too overbearing.

Based on comments, and wanting rich dark fudge,  I used half bittersweet & half semisweet of the best chocolate I could buy at the local gourmet grocers.  Then I changed up the technique & I will say it made for the finest fudge,  yum!
I used a double boiler method,  and melted just the chocolate slowly,  then I added in the condensed milk.  This is not easy - you really got to stir that milk into the chocolate.  I resisted the urge to increase the heat on the water. 
Then I sliced off 3 tablespoons of butter from right out the fridge,  and stirred that in - which isn't easy. Then I did it again.  By then the fudge was well mixed & real glossy & I didn't use the rest of the butter.  I added the nuts,  forgot the cherries I had intended,  and spread it into a 12 x 9 pan.  Sprinkled with some Celtic  sea salt.  So delish.

I make this recipe for all of my friends and they adore it. Sometimes I swirl in peanut butter or add an extract before microwaving it to give extra flavor! I've used every type of chip imaginable for it(white, cherry filled, caramel filled, butterscotch and mixed half bittersweet and dark chocolate)! It's also really good with some sea salt sprinkled on before putting it in the freezer to set!

So easy,  I let my 4yo take the lead. It is very rich and silky. We added toffee chips to the top of half the tray for a little texture.

We had some relatives visiting us in Bermuda and they were looking for fudge to have a "little sweet" in the evening after dinner. We could not find any in any of the stores. I found this recipe and it was so quick and easy I was able to whip up a batch and present it to them within a couple of hours. It is delicious and open to many variations. Maybe a new Christmas idea for me.

So easy!! I used milk chocolate chips instead and also lined the pan with foil so cutting and clean up are easier. I make variations by using different flavors of chips or just adding marshmallows. Family favorite!

I made this recipe for Christmas.  It was really creamy and rich.  So simple and delicious.  I did switch it up and made it over the stovetop using a heat proof bowl over a simmering pot off water.  It seemed really gritty, and I thought I had ruined it.   Not so at all.   Added it to my favorites and will make this every Christmas.  Not one piece was left!

I read the reviews before I made it,so I decided to use 2/3 milk chocolate morsels and 1/3 semi-sweet morsels to give it that rich fudgy flavor. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture as well because I love vanilla. It set really well, not like some of the other reviewers claimed.  I greased foil inside of the pan to make clean-up easier. Yummy!

My kids and I made this fudge today. One side had peppermint chips and the other side had m&ms.  We absolutely loved how it came out. It was our first time making fudge, and so easy as well. Thank you for the tip on spraying the pan then using foil with butter so it was easy to get out.

This is ridiculously easy and even more ridiculously good!! I just kept to the recipe, as written, except omitted nuts because my kid is allergic. Took maybe 10 minutes total to make this, including prepping the pan.  Premelted the butter in the microwave for about 40 seconds and the rest of the cooking time was less than two minutes.  Something this good should really not be this easy!!  Thank you, Dana!

This fudge  is really easy and pretty good! I used 1 cup vanilla chips to 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe and put it into a buttered foil lined jelly roll pan/Cookie sheet.  I placed pan into the freezer for an hour or so and then cut it into small pieces with a pizza wheel cutter.  Worked great!!

Ok, so I guess it's probably not bad for people who've never made the marshmallow creme fudge before. But if you've ever made that, this can't compare. It doesn't even come close. :-( We're taking it because I'm out of time (the main reason I didn't cook the other stuff) but I'm pretty disappointed. My fault I guess.

I made this recipe last year as Christmas gifts for all the girls at work.  I made every variation I found through the reviews.  Nobody said too much so I thought it was a failure until this year.  Everyone was asking me if I was going to make "that" fudge again.  When I said no they all started telling me I had to, it was so good especially the white fudge.  So I'm making the white fudge and I put red, green and white sprinkles on top so it looks very festive.  The white chips melt very easily so it takes no time at all.  I do mine on the stove so I can keep a closer eye on it because as soon as the chips are melted I pour it the pan.  Easy, fast and a great dish to bring to parties, neighbor gifts, and of course for home too.  Thanks for this recipe....finally something I can make and almost fullproof!

Instead of using the microwave I used a double boiler.  Melted butter, added in sweetest condensed milk, and then the chocolate.  I cooked it on low until it was thoroughly melted and mixed.  I doubled the recipe.  Made one pan w/ nuts over the top and one pan with mini chocolate chips over the top.  Of course, put in greased pans and refrigerated until ready.  They look fabulous and taste fabulous too.  Next time I'll try w/ milk chocolate and a little more sweetened condensed milk.

I have made this for a few years this way now and it is the easiest fudge I have ever made. I haven't had any issues with it setting up or being grainy. I have had many, many compliments on it and am asked to make it yearly. For best results, I recommend keeping it refrigerated. I use 2 cups semi-sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. It's easy and people think you spent hours on it. My 90 year old mother-in-law loves it and she used to always do it the old fashioned way with cooking, candy thermometer, etc. She can't believe I made it in the microwave. I also use the foil lined tip for easy removal.

I agree with the review "it's just not fudge-like." It is so easy to make, but not that creamy, melting-sugar-in-your-mouth feeling of fudge. It tastes more like eating chocolate. I won't be making it again.

People loved this, from little kids up to adults.  I made one batch with semi-sweet and one batch with Ghiradelli dark chips, and I personally like the darker one better as it's not quite as sweet. But both are rich and chocolatey and smoothly delicious. My husband and son like to steal pieces from the freezer. This is now the family fudge recipe for the future.  I like the idea of changing out the flavors and will try this after the holidays.

I make this fudge every year for Christmas and it's always a hit. Super easy! I make it with milk chocolate chips so it's not as bitter as dark chocolate.

Finally a recipe on the run. Having watched my mother stir her fudge for hours  this felt like cheating. But I added a good glug of brandy to it when stirring and this was an adult  dessert pleaser.  But do use good dark Belgian chocolate to be a complete adult hit. Or it's too sweet.

This recipe makes a nice fudge that you can really play with.Try half peanut butter chips half chocolate chips. I have repeated this recipe a dozan times with different add-mixtures, a hit every time.

I made this as just a quick dessert and it turned out well but it was to bitter for my liking. I wasn't sure how to fix it at first but I ended up adding powder sugar on the top and it balanced them out. I think next time I'll use 2 cups of the chips instead of 3.

Just made this fudge - I used half dark chocolate and half milk and it tastes delicious! Had to knock off one star though because it's just far too sticky for my liking.

We made this and it was a hit.  My daughter decided that she wanted to try to make it into cookies and cream.  We used white chips and Oreo cookies...rich but good.  We also tried it with peanut butter chips.  If you do that take out 2Tbsp butter.

Super easy for a first-time fudger!  I can imagine that this would be a fun recipe to add some extras to - some walnuts, or some crushed up Andes bars, or swirled with some white chocolate fudge....

This is the best fudge I've ever eaten! It's quick and easy to make, and it is definitely thick enough. I have made this fudge, given it to all of my friends and a couple of my neighbors. They kept going for more! :D

The only thing wrong with this recipe is that before you put it in the fridge, it is smothered in oil from the butter and you have to dab most of it off. I would suggest using a lot less butter. Otherwise, I will definitely keep this recipe! :)

This was my first time making fudge. This is my husband's favorite treat. He had been asking his mom for fudge and she was always putting it on hold. I decided to make it as a gift for my husband. It was so easy to make and delicious! He loved it and better yet, I beat my MIL ;) lol

It was really good, but it was not like real like old fashion fudge.
It was very easy to make, and a very cheap sweet. everyone liked it and I think I'll make it again.

SUPER EASY and DELICIOUS! I'm glad I read the reviews before making it since I'm not too big the "dark chocolate".  I used 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate and 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips and followed the recepie, turned out great!  Not too dark or too sweet,  very creamy. I will definitely be making this again.

I used pecans instead of walnuts,added vanilla and almond extracts and sprinkled Guerande salt crystals on 1/3 of top.
Instead of 3 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips,I used 2 cups of Hershey's Special Dark and a small box (4oz.) of Bakers German sweet chocolate.The substitutions worked out great, the fudge is awesome!
I give only 4 stars because this is my first fudge,I do not have a standard to measure it against.It may very well be a 5 star recipe!
Thank you!

Made my holiday gifts quick and easy by making everyone fudge from this recipe. I made chocolate, peanut butter and white chocolate all with this recipe. I did find that by melting the butter first the recipe worked "better".

Super easy and very creamy. I took other's advice and made mostly with milk chocolate chips and some semi sweet, that made the difference as they were very chocolaty. 
Perfect for Gift giving!

I went along with every direction except I left out the walnuts. This recipe tastes good and is super easy to make, BUT it honestly just taste like a bunch of chocolate chips melted together. Technically speaking, that's what's it is, and you can tell in the results of the taste. It doesn't have that FUDGE  taste in it that makes fudge taste so good.

Didn't set up for me.  I've made the sweetened condenced milk fudge for years but lost my recipe.  I don't think I added milk & butter until chips were melted & out of microwave.

This was really good, easy to make fudge. I can't believe how easy it was.  I left out the nuts and added orange extract to get orange fudge.

I'd give this 4 for taste and 5+ for simplicity!  It tasted a whole lot "fudgier" than I thought it would, although like many others have mentioned - it's not identical to the original (and much more difficult) fudge.  But it's hard to complain when it's this easy and still tastes awesome!  Also - with all semi-sweet chips, it's really dark.  Mix in milk chocolate if you want it to have a less intense flavor.  When I make this now, I use 2 cups milk chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It is so easy and the fudge turned out perfect. I mixed milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips instead and I doubled the recipe. Everyone raved over it and said it was the best they've ever had. I agree. I will never make it any other way. As a matter of fact I'm making more right now. Lol I did follow the recipe exactly though. I used a glass bowl, etc. wish I could find a brownie this easy and good!

So easy! I've never made fudge before and wanted to try it this year. So glad I came across this recipe.  It's so easy and am now making a peanut butter version with peanut butter chips.  The taste is excellent too!

Great recipe, very versatile.  I recommend swirling in some marshmallow fluff before allow the fudge to set.  Why?  Because chocolate loves marshmallows!  Trust me on this one.

WOW! Great recipe! Super easy and so many flavors you can make...  First time making this was a success. I used 2 bags Hershey's chocolate mint chips and milk chocolate chips for a double batch, added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract. Surprisingly smooth, creamy and worth hiding all for myself. Next flavor...chocolate raspberry!

I've loved fudge forever and I made it yesterday with my daughter and it turned out GREAT. I've tried once before but the fudge was gritty and it never hardened in the fridge like it's supposed to. Thanks for the easiest & best fudge recipe.

Great, simple recipe. Endless variations - try mini marshmallows, dried fruit and nuts, toffee or pretzel bits. I make mine in an 8 inch square glass baking dish coated with cooking spray. After it sets, run a knife along the edges, then invert onto the counter. Cutting from the bottom ensures perfect, neat cuts.

I didn't have a microwaveable bowl so made it over the stove on low with a nonstick pan. I doubled it and used 3 c milk chocolate chips, 2 c Reese's peanut butter chips and 1 c semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of all semi-sweet. PURE HEAVEN.

So disappointed!  It was super easy and I had high hopes but as a saw another reviewer said... it tastes like melted chocolate chips, not at all like the fudge I wanted it to be.  Won't make this again.

If this was any easier, it would already be made!  I prepared it on the stove top so I could watch for the grainy element other reviewers talked about.  Let the butter melt first on low, low, low; then put in the chips and condensed milk.  Stir in the nuts at the last minute and quickly get it into the greased dish.  Done in under 5 minutes!!

Delicious! It was my first time making fudge, and it was delicious. But it was a bit too dark for me, and too rich. Aside from that, I would recommend this recipe to any first- time fudge makers

Perfect!  Very creamy!  This fudge does not have the grainy, sugary texture like others I have attempted. This is definitely a keeper to be made again.

I used to make a similar simple fudge recipe for years.  Makes a nice gift for a chocoholic.  The only difference was I did not use nuts and I amped the flavor up by adding a little all natural almond extract...not too much, just a 1/2 tsp.  you can add a bit of vanilla with it.  I will say that I found the consistency to be a bit better if I melted the chocolate and butter together first, then stirred in the extracts and condensed milk after the chocolate was melted and removed from the heat immediately after everything is incorporated.

Took the advise on some of the reviews.  for instance, 2 C semi sweet and 1 C white chocolate, increased amount of walnuts, and melted butter and milk before adding other ingredients.  It was a hit !

Super easy just dont over microwave the chocolate or it gets gritty. I also changed up the recipie for subsequent batches by using 1/2 peanut butter chips or 1/2 milk chocolate chips, depending on the crowd you are trying to please.

Really like this recipe, but I can't stand walnuts so on my second try I added pecans and liked it so much better. I try not to microwave foods since it changes the cellular structure of everything and isn't healthy, so I used my homemade double boiler (large pot with boiling water and a metal bowl inside of that), and it worked just fine!

I made this with my 6 year old nephew as a treat for the family, and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and tasted good. I heated the milk and butter first in the microwave, and then added the chocolate chips after (I've had bad experiences with seized chocolate!). It worked out fine, and the kids added sprinkles, mini marshmallows and m&m's on top of the fudge before it cooled. One tip, though - I lined the pan with greased foil, that way when the fudge cooled I just lifted the foil out and wrapped it around the fudge to store. Thanks for the recipe.

I made 2 batches, one with old chocolate & just expired sweetened condensed milk and one with newly purchased chocolate & sweetened condensed milk. Both batches came out delicious. I was kind of surprised that the older products worked so well. They had a firmer texture while I stirred so, I thought it was a fail. But, thank goodness I followed it through. YUM!

The only thing easier than making this is boiling water.  Super easy and delicious.  I did a trail run at home and then made a triple batch for my wife's Women's Club luncheon.  None came back home.

I don't really know fudge so others may be right, this may not be a real "fudge" fudge (I have no idea) but I LOVE this recipe.  The first time I made it was just to use up some leftover chocolate melts (not chocolate chips - mint chocolate melting wafers).  I wasn't too invested in the results, if it hadn't turned out I wouldn't have lost much.  But holy cow, my family and friends INHALED this fudge, and I really enjoyed the 1 piece that I got myself, lol.  The texture is fantastic.  I just made another batch using white chocolate chips, and I added a few drops of key lime flavoring to make key lime and white chocolate fudge.  It's amazing,I'll be doing it again in the future - the possibilities are endless.

Super easy to make. However, it tasted more like a fudge brownie than fudge. Chocolate was overwhelming. I think using less chocolate is probably better. Not like the prize winning style fudge at farmers markets you will find.

I agree with a previous review that states this is more like eating chocolate than fudge. It's good, but its softer and doesn't have the right density and texture of actual fudge.

This recipe is so easy and the fudge is definitely delicious.  I used 1.5C milk chocolate and 1.5C semisweet chocolate chips as some reviewers recommended and the result is good.  However, I personally like less sweet better so maybe next I'll follow the recipe by using all semi-sweet chips.

I loved how easy this recipe is, although I used I double boiler to melt everything in because I don't like using a microwave for chocolate. I changed this slightly by adding 1/8 tsp salt, 2 Tbs bourbon and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Just checked, and tasted, it after a night of setting and it is pretty good. I get that it's a fudge. For anyone who thinks this is too dark, use milk chocolate chips, or a combination of both.

This was my very first time making homemade fudge, and it turned out a bit better than I expected. The only changes I made were that I combined the ingredients over the stovetop instead of in the microwave and I added vanilla extract to a half batch of regular fudge with walnuts, and the other half I used peppermint extract. It turned out a bit grainy, but I read in the reviews that melting the butter first helps to get rid of a grainy texture, so I'll try that next time. I do plan on making this again.

Thanks for this recipe. Quick, easy and tasty. 
I used milk chocolate chips and  also added 1 tsp instant coffee granules right before mixing and pouring into the cooling dish. Tasted awesome. I will make this over and over.

Okay... So I just used up all my characters on this long, detailed review, and I clicked submit, and it didn't do anything. It didn't post on the site, I didn't get any notifications... So I'm guessing I just lost it :( This is definitely a crowd pleaser. People who say they don't like peanuts decide they like it when they timidly try the peanut butter fudge, everyone asks for the recipe, that kind of thing. I love sweet stuff, so the chocolate fudge I made (using semisweet chips in a half peanut butter-half chocolate batch) was a bit bland. Good, but not worth the calories. The peanut butter though... Man, that was goooooooood! Recently though, I made an insanely delicious batch of chocolate fudge. I was confused for a while but now I have a conclusion! The time that the chocolate fudge wasn't so great was when I did a half and half batch. Maybe I put more sweetened condensed milk into the peanut butter fudge than chocolate??? Well, I also have some tips: #1: If the fudge comes out kind of grainy, you might not have set the power level to medium. If you catch yourself cooking the fudge on high, take it out of the microwave, mix it up until it's smooth, set the power level on medium, and keep on cooking! #2: I would suggest a half and half recipe, because peanut butter and chocolate taste amazing together!!!! Also, the sweetness of the peanut butter fudge balances out the semi-sweet chocolate fudge.. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh - and I don't put walnuts in it :)

My family absolutely loved this fudge. It was creamy and rich with a dark chocolatey flavor. It was easy to make, although I had to stir a few extra times so it would not burn. I loved the simplicity of just a few ingredients also. We will be making this one again.

Awesome fudge. This was my first time making it for the holidays. Very easy to make and tastes great. I added walnuts to half of it and left other side plain.

This is a great base recipe with multiple ways to alter the flavor, so far everyone's favorite is adding in a candy bar to the melting process. 
LOVE this recipe. my son had to make fudge for his high school science class. We tried two recipes; this one and another with a lot of ingredients and took a long time. This recipe won hands down, all the kids loved it and so did the teacher. 
Thanks!

I think this is the easiest and best recipe I've tried yet.  My old one was the one with the marshmallow crème, and it's good but too grainy for my taste.  This recipe reminds me of the fudge my former bosses made at the candy shop where I worked during high school, and it was wonderful!  I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet dark (Ghirardelli) chips in mine, and added a teaspoon of vanilla and chopped walnuts just before the final stir.  Next time I'll use two cups of milk chocolate and one cup of semi-sweet dark and add some orange flavoring, and maybe a pinch of salt.  Love this recipe!

Gloriously smooth and easy to make. Followed the recipe as written. I think I probably didn't nuke it as long in the microwave as one review warned against letting it boil. Started with 1min then nuked in 30 sec increments (stirring each time) until all the chips were melted. I lined the dish with buttered foil for easy removal as suggested. This would be so easy to alter with using different flavored chips. This is replacing my old fudge recipe for sure.

This was so super easy to make. I've never made fudge before so I read through a lot of the bad reviews to be aware and the only thing I added was about 2 tbsp of AP flour during the cooking process.  I cooked everything in a saucepan at med-low heat, instead of microwave, so I could monitor it better.  I melted the butter, added the chocolate and when halfway melted, I added the milk. I can't have nuts so didn't add them. I continually stirred with a silicone spatula to make sure I could get all the corners (about 10 minutes total) until it was almost like a frosting consistency.  I added a tbsp of flour, mixed well, then added another to help absorb the butter and give it a little bit more "thickness". I would suggest to anyone that adding a flour is by eye to help the butter dissolve and not sit on top of the chocolate. I used a glass dish that I lined with wax paper (but sprayed with Pam just in case) because I didn't want a "tin" taste.  About 2 hours in the fridge and I flipped it over and cut with a pizza cutter into small squares.  I only left it out during a party then stored in the fridge again.  It kept it's perfect flavor and consistency for a week (we ate it all by then) and now have friends that are paying me to make some for them.  Great recipe but for those cooking fudge for the first time, go with the saucepan.

Love this recipe.  I prefer to mix semi-sweet chocolate chips and semi-sweet baker's chocolate - the consistancy seems better.  Also find it much easier to cut and clean when I line the glass dish with wax paper.

Wonderfully yummy and easy. I used wax paper that I greased in the pan as otherwise too difficult to take the fudge out and cut it.

Love, love, love this recipe!!  Fabulous--my mom, aunts, and grandma have been making fudge longer than I have been alive.  Between all of them, they have over 200 years of experience between them.  I AM NOT A BAKER, but I got RAVE, RAVE, RAVE reviews using this fudge recipe.  They all thought I finally mastered the art, and I did--just not the way they thought ;)  *lol*  

Also used the same ratios to make Maple Nut Fudge (white chocolate morsels instead of semisweet chocolate) and maple flavoring (2-3 tsp.)  Thank you for this fun and easy recipe!!!!

I feel bad giving this recipe such a low rating because it's so easy and I know what kind of work goes into making real fudge. This fudge tasted good the first day but after that it was just gummy. I put it out for company and no one ate it. I will probably bite the bullet and learn to make fudge the hard way.

I make both "real" candy thermometer fudge and this. The family prefers this made with Toll House chips and topped with a few crystals of sea salt (press in before cooling). The salt cuts the sweetness and they won't stop eating it!

So good, but not really what I would call "fudge" I however like the Idea of taking pieces rolling them into balls and coating them in chocolate and nuts or in powdered sugar and making a basket of homemade candies.

Just an update. This Fudge was a HIT. I have to now make more because everyone loved it so much. I also added a half cup, not 1/4 a cup butter. Does get soft at room temp for too long. Better served right out of fridge. I don't care if it's not snob "real" fudge. This stuff is GREAT!!!

I have to say that I felt a little guilty adding this fudge to my "Family and Friends Christmas Treat Boxes."  I am the type of person that loves complicated and somewhat finicky recipes; because, I like the challenge!  So that's where I feel guilty about this fudge...a few ingredients, mix it all up, put it in the microwave and PRESTO!  It's that simple and it tastes great.  Of course, it's not the true taste and texture of traditional old-fashioned fudge; but, it is a fantastic, creamy-textured fudge that I will make and serve time and time again.  Plus, it frees-up my time in the kitchen for those finicky cookie recipes.

Only time I have ever made fudge and this was so easy and turned out amazing. I think I will stick to this recipe and try using different flavor chips (peanut butter fudge, butterscotch, etc)

Great, easy recipe.  I've always used a marshmallow fluff in my fudge on the stove, this is similar result with half the work.  Double batch in a 9X13 is perfect.  I like to do white chocolate chips and crushed up oreo cookies in mine!  Yum!

Way too creamy, followed the recipe to a T. I think its because there was too much condensed milk.

Excellent fudge recipe.  I can't work with the fudge recipes that require the candy thermometer or a soft balls or any of that.  Too much like a chemistry experiment.  I just want good fudge!  And this is it.  Skip the nuts & it rocks.  Make it every year at the holidays.

I can't give this 5 stars because it is not my grandma's fudge. HOWEVER! This is great. I didn't have a full 3 cups of chocolate chips but I had chocolate bars. So I used 1 cup semi-sweet 1 cup milk chocolate and 2 Hershey's chocolate bars. I didn't microwave it, I used a double boiler method. Also I added some marshmallow whip, maybe about 1/4 cup? I just eyeballed it. I'm always eyeballing stuff. I also added a dash of vanilla. Fantastic flavor! Perfect texture.

They say that if it's too good to be true, it itsn't.  However, this fudge is incredibly easy AND incredibly delicious.  The texture and taste were perfect.

I love fudge and had never made it before, so I decided to yry this b/c it's so easy.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used 1 c. semi-sweet chips and 2 c. milk choc. chips.  i lined the baking dish with foil and then sprayed it with cooking spray.  Came out beautifully and was sooo good!  This is a keeper, and I plan on making it every Christmas!  :)

The consistency was very nice, but just tasted like a Hersey's  chocolate bar- NOT what I think of when I think of fudge. Quite disappointed.

The recipe tastes SO good... but as soon as I take the fudge out of the fridge it softens. Not sure what I could've done differently. I used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. Also used the double-boiler method to melt the chocolate. Like I said, the taste is incredible, I just wish it would harden a little more. The fudge turns out completely smooth, not grainy at all like some recipes.

This recipe it tasty and super easy.  It works with any combination of 3 cups of chips.  My favorite is 1.5 cups peanut butter chips and 1.5 cups white chocolate chips.  It makes a perfect peanut butter fudge!

Super-easy! My husband, the fudge-connoisseur apparently, was skeptical when I told him about this recipe. He said he only likes "really good" fudge. Well, this exceeded both of our expectations! I used 1/2 semi-sweet, 1/2 milk chocolate chips, and I did use Ghirardelli chips. I nuked it for exactly 3 minutes, stirred well, and poured it into a parchment paper-lined loaf pan, cooling it in the fridge for about 3 hours. Next time I will try some crushed peppermint sticks on top. My 2 1/2-year old son also loved this... Highly recommend!

I just made this recipe and this looks delicious! I didn't have any microwavable bowls that were large enough so i made it on the stovetop and it thickened up perfectly! It is setting so nicely and what i ate off the spoon it tastes wonderful! I can't wait to experiment with add ins and other flavors! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Great recipe ... but be very careful to just barely melt the chips or they get overcooked and oil starts to separate out. I had a terrible time when I used cold butter out of the fridge, the chips were overcooked by the time the butter melted and then mixing it too much just kept producing oil ... warm butter and gentle folding works best.

So far this recipe has been a hit! I feel it could use something more but for now everyone has said the fudge is great! However I did cook on stove rather then microwave!!!

VERY EASY! A little bit sweeter than I thought it would be, but next time I will try it with the walnuts to balance out the taste. Overall very good. :)

This is definitely more of a "dark chocolate" flavor and my KIDS AND friends rave about it! If you want a milder chocolate flavor you can always use milk chocolate chips. I also use a heavy pan on the stove instead of the microwave because it's easier for me to not over cook the chocolate that way. ENJOY!!!

This was my first attempt at fudge and it is incredible.  I used milk chocolate chips and unsalted butter.  I also used a double boiler instead of the microwave.

This is awesome. It is extremely easy. It tastes great. And it is very easy to modify, you can change the chocolate chips (dark, White, Peanut butter, etc.), Add any kind of nuts that you like, I have used mints, the possibilities are nearly endless.

Very simple, delicious recipe. Is probably going to make me gain weight, thanks a LOT. :) i used milk chocolate also instead of semisweet. Im thinking of putting marshmallows, white chocolate or caramel in the mix next time.

My fudge never set. Being that there is virtually no cooking in this recipe, I don't see how this could have been an error on my part, but I guess it's possible. It has been sitting in my fridge for almost 24 hours and still is the consistency of thick brownie batter.

I have made this three times now. I made it with 4 unsweetened chocolate squares for a more Dark Chocolate taste. Also if you use a nonstick pan, there is no need to grease pan. Very Good

This recipe for fudge is the easiest I've ever made! I made some around christmas time, and we made the semi-sweet, once we used milk chocolate chips, and even white chocolate chips with peppermint. For that, we crushed some candy canes in a bowl until they were tiny and almost powder, and all the fudge tasted great! :)

This fudge is ridiculous...in a good way!  I couldn't believe how easy, quick, and delicious it was.  My kids and I made this for all their teachers and our neighbors for Valentine's Day.  I doubled the batch and didn't have a bowl big enough to put all the inbredients in the microwave so I used a nonstick pan on the stovetop and it was super quick and easy.  I can't wait to try all the variations that others have suggested.

I LOVE this recipe. So decadent and foolproof.  I haven't had much luck with making fudge via stove top before so was holding my breath to see if the fudge would set and it did.  I love all the vesatile ways people have revised the recipe as well.  I too supsituted one cup of the semi chips for white.  Next time I will experiment with cocunut oil to give it an even silkier texture.  What's also great is this can be whipped up quickly for holidays, etc. and no one would be the wiser and would be a big hit.  My husband and I can't stop going back for more and he's not a huge fan of fudge.

Loved this recipe.  I did go with other suggestions and substituted the semi-sweet chips for milk chocolate.  I do all three cups of milk chocolate and it is so yummy.  I'm not a dark chocolate lover though so it fits my taste buds much better.  I've tried adding peanut butter chips, but I haven't found a good ratio yet.  As of now I'll be sticking with the all milk chocolate chips.

I made it with a combination of milk and dark chocolate. Very easy and very tasty! It was a big hit with my little girl. Next I'll try it with white and maybe a bit of mixed peel.

This was the easiest and creamiest fudge I have ever made...I almost felt guilty that it took so little time and effort to do it! It helped to add to my holiday baking when I spend hours slaving over cookies and I was able to adorn my "gift of cookie plates"with this creamy fudge!! Bravo!!!

This was easy, and that was the goal for me this time around. I made a couple batches for neighbor's holiday gifts. The downfalls: it was super sweet and not as "rich" as other fudge I've made and was hard to get out of the pan even though it was well greased.  I added some dried cranberries and walnuts to one of my batches and it was super tasty!

I added a tsp of vanilla and once I poured it into the 8x8 dish, I set the dish in a bath of ice to stop the heat from over cooking the fudge.

I love super dark chocolate and not too sweet. I started with Ghiradelli double cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips. Substituted the sweetened condensed milk with straight Coconut milk.  It came out a little sticky, but sooooo rich and creamy.

For fudge that isn't too sweet add 1 cup of unsweetened chocolate and 2 cups of semisweet.  This is a super easy recipe and would use again!

I have never had any luck making any kind of candy or fudge. Last year I bought the creme stuff and choc. chips,etc., but never made it. When I saw your fudge recipe I thought , there might be a chance I could do that one. Well I did and it is perfect! I don't like fudge but my dad does and he was very happy! (Well actually I like this fudge!) So thanks so much!!

I recently made this for a Christmas party and everyone there loved it. I personally thought it was a bit rich, as I drank two glasses of water when I ate one piece. But overall, it was a party pleaser.

I think this was perfect.  I did 1 cup semi sweet and 2 cups milk chocolate.  It was so easy and yummy.  I think, though, that I would use all milk chocolate since I am a milk chocolate lover but what I made was really good too.  I will definitely be making more.  The darker version (1 cup semi sweet and 2 cups milk) would be awesome as a truffle.

Amazing fudge recipe!! I used it for a fund raising festival at my children's school and people where coming back for seconds. I used pecans...didn't have any walnuts on hand and I added some Skor bits. They were incredible!! I was embarrassed by how easy they were to make. This is a keeper for sure!! ENJOY:)

I didn't have any semi-sweet chips so I used all milk chocolate. It was a bit to sweet but after a dusting of cocoa powder, it was perfect.  The texture is good, I will be making this recipe again, with all different types of chips. I hope it works as well

By far the BEST and EASIEST fudge recipe around! I literally made and passed out 20 batches of this stuff at Christmas time. Every batch different - some made w/ peanut butter chips, caramel chips, butterscotch, etc... But mostly I LOVED the ones made with MILK chocolate chips. I added everything from walnuts, pecans, almonds, coconut, marshmallows, peanuts, crushed candy canes, crushed ANDES mints, M&Ms and on and on... Somehow in such a short time I have become famous for my fudge in my small town... haha - (I wish I could take credit for it) I literally get asked a few times a week when Im making it again, and Im certainly always happy to pass the recipe along!
**update** now that it's been a decade since I first tried making this amazing fudge, I feel like I've perfected it to fit my liking - and it's a huge hit year after year! For the basic chocolate fudge I ONLY use milk chocolate chips and it just makes such an awesome creamy taste. Even though the microwave is on medium (mine is on 60%) I still open it up and give it a stir every 15 to 20 seconds and it's always super creamy and never grainy. The best is to add mini marshmallows and walnuts and pass out delicious rocky road during the holidays!!

The easiest fudge recipe ever!  And it's so yummy.  I took some to a family party and it was gone in minutes.  The kids kept coming back asking for more and no one believed me when I told them how easy it is to make.  I made peanut butter fudge with 1 package (2cups) of peanut butter chips and 1 cup chocolate chips, it was to die for!

I have been using this recipe for years. I'm not a dark chocolate lover so I use milk chocolate instead. I also use either cinnamon, mint, butterscotch, or peanutbutter chips to change the flavor. I do half milk chocolate and half flavored. It's by far the easiest and creamiest recipe I have ever used!

I just made a batch today and we all (hubby and 2 kids) liked it. Unfortunately I couldn't get all the lumps out of the mixture (used a double boiler, we don't have a microwave oven) and the resulting fudge was slightly lumpy. It was still yummy though!

I'll do up a double batch soon, perhaps with some fruit extract added, to give away to neighbours and relatives as Christmas presents. We've run out of gift ideas over the years and prefer to give them some wholesome (or as good as it gets), homemade foodstuff to bless their households.

Thank you for this recipe! I know I could never make fudge the old fashioned way and this is As Good As It Can Get d:)

Tasted like chocolate chips not like fudge.  If I try this again I will use different chocolate.  It did turn out smooth, nice texture.

This was my first time making fudge. So simple!!! This is great if you need to make a desert in a snap. I added chopped pecans because that is what I had in the frezzer. I also accidently poured my batter into a 9x13 pan instead of 8x8...no biggie, they are still fantastic! The only thing kind of silly about this recipe is that it takes about a bag and a half of chocolate chips. I am glad I had a random half bag of choc. chips on hand. But that is just me and the recipe still rocks!

Thanks to you, I ended up having to make this three times in one week!  EVERYBODY loved it!  We are peanut butter fans in my house so we drizzled some on top after it was in the pan.  Ran a knife through to swirl it - oh baby!  This recipe is VERY simple to make. I make it after dinner, do the dishes, and we are ready for dessert!

Yummy!  I made this for Christmas and EVERYBODY loved it!  Even my Grandma raved!  I was a little skeptical because people were saying it tasted like a candybar, but I didn't think so at all.  I too used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate.  I will definitely keep this recipe and use it for special occasions!

very simple recipe. If you're just starting out making fudge for the first time, I recommend this. Especially if you lack a candy themometer because then it's easier to succeed. Then you can work your way up to the more complex versions.
I found this fudge to be smooth and soft but still retained that semi-sweet chocolate chip flavor. I prefer my fudge to be a little more solid and to have that rock hard look. But that's just me. 
Still, decent enough. Great for beginners!

So easy and delicious. Great with chopped walnuts in it. I used 1 c of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 c of milk chocolate. Next time it will be 1 part Skor chips in place of the milk chocolate chips.

I used two parts semi-sweet chips and one part creme de menthe chips.  I also sprinkled peppermint crumbs on top prior to cooling.  Although the texture was chewy, like a tootsie roll, the flavor was great!

This easily earns 5 stars for being so easy to make and for only needing 3 ingredients, however the flavor is only worth 3 stars. Not bad but not great either.

So easy and so good. I followed the recipe exactly, once with nuts and once without. Both times the fudge turned out perfectly. I intend on using part unsweetened choc. next time.

My husband likes me to make fudge for Christmas.  I usually make the marshmallow creme kind, but this year I tried this recipe.  It was so easy!  It is very good and I think next year this is what I will make to give to friends, family, etc.

It was okay.  I made it with 1 cup marshmallows and 1 cup pecans, and this wasn't enough filling.  Needs more additions to make it  a "very good" recipe.

Made this and gave it to friends for Christmas!  It got rave reviews!  One woman asked for the recipe, because she said she has tried many recipes that always come out grainy, and she wanted to know how I got it so smooth!  She couldn't believe it when I told her how EASY this recipe is!  Easy and delicious...what more could you ask for in a recipe?

I have made fudge once before, so I am not a pro. But this turned out great. I added peanut butter chips to mine. Thanks! I'm giving as gifts to extended family.

We loved this recipe.  Made many different variations, every one turned out great.  

Faves were butterscotch, and a variation w/ cinnamon chips and dark chocolate.  (Used just a bit more than a half cup of cinnamon chips, and make up the rest w/ chocolate chips, to get three cups total.)  

Experiment -- you really can't go wrong unless you overcook it as another reviewer mentioned.  Even then, if it's grainy, it's still a rather tasty recipe!

Incredibly easy, set up very well, and tastes great! If I had known fudge could be this easy, I would have been making it for years. Next time, I'm going to try it with butterscotch chips, for my husband.

I can't say thanks enough Dana.  I have thrown out every other fudge recipe I have.  It doesn't get any easier than this recipe.  I made chocolate and peanut butter, using the chips as you suggested.  Delicious and thanks again.

Easy recipe for anyone and everyone!  The chocolate and the walnut is alterable- I use different kind of chocolate/nuts for friends with different preferences- they all love it!

Very yummy!It's the first time I have made fudge and it has turned out wonderfully. I solved the 'stick-to- the-pan' problem simply by pouring the mixture in a silicone square cake pan.The fudge comes out of the pan in the twinkling of an eye! Thanks for sharing.

What an easy recipe! I loved it! I did not think it tated like a chocolate bar - maybe let it sit overnight after refrigerating, to eat it. The only thing I would do different is make it with milk chocolate chips. Thanks!
