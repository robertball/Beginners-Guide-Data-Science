Delicious need I say more. I also doubled the siracha sauce and used half a large carrot.

What a fresh, pretty and delicious dish!  It was simple to make and healthy too.  I used some cut up shrimp instead of crab which was awesome.  The rice paper wrappers are surprisingly tough and easy to work with.  I learned to remake my rolls as tight as possible so they don't crumble apart as you eat them.  I served mine with the "Best Peanut Sauce" recipe from this site and they were a hit with my family.  They're a perfect hot summertime, light evening meal.

These were good! I ended up doubling the Sriracha after tasting the crab mixture but that is the only change I made. You can actually get 6 rolls out of this recipe. Next time I will replace some of the carrot with bean sprouts for added texture. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Served this to friends one night. Easy enough where I taught the first roll and everyone then made there own.

This recipe was great, and surprisingly easy! The only recommendation I would make is to either chop the green onion or leave it out. When cut into matchsticks, it makes it imposible to cleanly bite off pieces of the spring rolls and kinda feels like youâ€™re eating grass.

We thought these were just okay... definitely fresh and tasty but you need to enjoy rice paper for sure. We dipped in chili garlic sauce. The avocado was the best part.
