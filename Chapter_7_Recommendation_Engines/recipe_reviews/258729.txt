Think this will be my go-to recipe for grilled potatoes.  Didn't have fresh herb so used dried (a tablespoon of each). Like another reviewer, I left the garlic in. I also didn't cook the potatoes for 8 minutes.  I let the salted water come to a boil and then turned the heat off til I was ready to grill.  Came out perfect.

The herb infused oil is to die for! I'm already thinking of other ways I could use this. I did replace some of the rosemary with oregano but only due to personal preference. Rosemary goes a long way with my husband and I. The only thing that didn't work perfectly for me with this was the boiling time. My wedges were thick but 8 minutes was too long. They got a little too soft and some started breaking away from the skin. You have to remember that they are going to continue to cook even after they are drained so I recommend pulling them off at 6 minutes. With that being said, this was an excellent recipe and one I will make often during summertime grilling!

I didn't have thyme so I put basil in ... The one that is freshly in a tube ... I left the crushed garlic in ...  Unfortunately I didn't have 2 hours to let it sit in the container lol ... I had the wedges in a stainless steel pan with holes @ the bottom... on the top shelf of the BBQ because my wedged were to  small they would've fell through lol .... plus I had lots ??
Everything turned out great ... It was really good ...my wedges was small soooo I just had it in  boiling water for couple minutes... ....  Next time I'll use bigger potatoes n do them right on the  grill  ??

Loved it! I cut the rosemary back to 1 T, it can be a little overpowering, but made this as written otherwise. I served this with grilled chicken thighs and a spinach salad.  Thanks for sharing.

These are the best potatoes ever!  I love crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Very easy to make...we had fresh rosemary and oregano so we used a spice grinder, then added dry thyme and.

I made half the recipe.  I also crushed and chopped the garlic and left it in.  Other than that, no changes.  (Oh yeah, dried thyme) Very very tasty.  Even my fussy hubby liked them.
