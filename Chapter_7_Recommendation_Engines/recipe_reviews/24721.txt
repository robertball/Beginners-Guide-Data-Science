I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband said "Mmmm good!" As for myself I thought it was just OK. For one thing the directions are confusing. How does an 8-count package of rolls produce 6 servings? There is really no indication of how to 'fill each roll and form into patties'. I ended up rolling them out a bit and using one roll piece on the bottom and the other on top producing four large 'patties'. Oh and if your filling is hot you may want to do your forming right on the cookie sheet or you'll have a time getting the prepared patty off of your work surface as the dough becomes very soft and sticky! I may use this filling again though. It was tasty in a wrap with some chicken the next day.

awesome dish! The filling is similar to a samosa filling I followed the recipe exactly except for adding garlic to the filling (because I add garlic to everything I can). I "formed the patties" by separating the crescent dough and rolling each one out a bit then adding the filling to the center and wrapping the rest of the dough around it pinching the open gaps together as I went. These baked up to a golden brown in 15 minutes in my oven and I served them with some coriander chutney on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great idea! Instead of the spices (which I didn't have) I sauteed some garlic and then added 2 tsp of garam masala spice mix. I also used two teaspoons of canned hot jalapenos instead of the chili peppers. I love samosas and these tasted almost like the ones I get from the restaurant and were much cheaper! I used Pillsbury reduced fat croissant dough.

Although the filling is very tasty I didn t like the crescent wrapping. The overwhelming buttery taste of the dough didn t seem to match. I used Pillbury brand which had 6 crescents. The package did say butter flavor but that s all the grocers had. My 6 year old loved them though. Will try it again with possibly puff pastry or other plain refrigerated dough.

Just tried this last night and was very pleased. I tweaked the spice amounts to my taste and used reduced fat crescent dough. They tasted just like samosas. I served them apple chutney.

These are great and so easy! I like to add a bit more spices and up the green peas to a cup but that's just personal preference.

Delicious. Almost like the samosas we get at the Indian restaurant. I used one jalepeno pepper instead of the 2 chile peppers and it was still plenty hot.

Not quite instant not quite patties but really good relatively quick and I decided they fit my diet. They're acceptably edible at room temperature didn't try them cold. Thenks for the ideas!

I made my own crescent rolls. The filling is super! My family wants these again very soon!
