Iâ€™d been looking at this recipe, and my son happened to say he wanted cabbage for dinner... ( like that happens...ever!) I chucked a cabbage and some other bits I could remember from the recipe into the cart, and legged it to the cashier, before he could change his mind.
I used a desert apple, red onion, lemon juice instead of vinegar, I had to use a smoked sausage from the deli as I couldn't find chicken sausages, this recipe was simple, quick to put together and I loved the uncomplicated flavour of it... my son decided he doesn't like black pepper so he pushed it around his plate but ate the sausages... you win some, you lose some.

This was delicious! I don't usually cook cabbage, so this was new for our family. I had a bag of cole slaw mix so just used that, which worked great. I prepared exactly as written except that I tossed the cabbage mixture right in the jelly roll pan and put the sausage in the oven at the same time as the cabbage. Nice way to get a few more veggies in our diet!

I did make a few alterations. I use a Honey Crisp apple (b/c it wasn't stated which kind to use) I  also used Onion Soup mix & Adobe seasoning. I just mixed everything on the baking sheet covered it with foil and put it in the oven for 20 minutes then cooked it for an extra 10 minutes uncovered just to make sure the sausages were cooked. Even my picky eater gave it a thumbs up.

This was a healthy and tasty dish.  It was a pain to shred the cabbage so I ended up chopping half of it. I used 2 apples, and cut up the Italian chicken sausage into bite size pieces. I also used 1 1/2 tsp. Of Adobo in place of the salt/pepper.  I had to cook the chicken sausage for 25 minutes so the next time I will simply add it at the beginning of the cook time.  I served this with toasted Italian bread and my husband enjoyed it. It left us both very full...will definitely make this dish again!
