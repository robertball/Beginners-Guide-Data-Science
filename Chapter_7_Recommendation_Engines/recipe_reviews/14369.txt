Oh, man, I will never make another potato salad!!  The dressing was delicious.  I like mine a little "wetter" though so I'll probably double the dressing recipe next time.  But the flavors are awesome and it smells so good after sitting all night.  Not difficult to make at all.  I used red-skinned potatoes and black olives right out of the can.  It looked great and tasted so flavorful and refreshing on our 4th of July picnic.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to agree with the last rating - it was GREAT!!  I doubled the recipe and it was all gone by the end of the day.  The flavors were bright and can not compare to anyother potato salad I have ever made.  I used fresh dill!

Fresh, Fresh, Fresh!  I am not a fan of mayonaise based potatoe salads, so that limits my options!  This recipe fit the bill!  It was still creamy (so fans of mayo will approve), but light and extremely fresh tasting.  A super summer dish.  I made it just as directed, except without the celery, and it was divine!

I'm not sure what to say about this recipe.  I liked it better before I added the yogurt/honey/mustard mixture.  The taste after adding the yogurt mixture didn't really do that much for me.  It did taste FRESH and LIGHT and I did like the use of yogurt instead of mayo but ... I guess the dill and olives combination just didn't knock my socks off.

I was really torn on how to rate this recipe.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  If you really LOVE dill then you'll love this recipe.  I was more excited about the 'Honey Mustard' dressing, but it was drowned out by the dill flavor.  If I try it again, I'll cut back on the dill just a little.

I loved this salad.  Oddly enough, I didn't have any olives, so I used virgin olive oil in the dressing.  I also substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and thyme for the dill.  It was nice and creamy (I used partially drained yogurt, which was thicker).  Thanks for the recipe Christine.

I could serve this WITHOUT the yogurt dressing, perhaps doubling the vinegar, oil, salt, pepper and dill...it was that good.  Unlike some other reviewers, we did not find the dill overpowering, but then we do love dill .  Couple things I will do differently in the future.  I will use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and  thick greek yogurt to keep the dressing from becoming too runny.  It was a nice change from a traditional mayo-based potato salad and pretty healthy for you.  It was a good side dish to marinated and grilled  New York strip steaks and homemade french fried onion rings...peach shortcakes completed the meal.

This was really quite good.  I'll make it again, but maybe with less dill, or maybe a different herb that will compliment the really yummy honey-mustard dressing.  Thank you for submitting this low-fat, no mayo recipe.  My husband and I both enjoyed it!

I was so glad to find this recipe...I have had one very similar to this at one of my favorite restaurants and I get cravings for it.  This was so close to that and will become a staple in our household for family gatherings and we have them on a regular basis.  This was perfect also for my hubby who cannot eat the traditional one due to egg allergies!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!!!

My family didn't care for this recipe.  It's more of a Greek twist w/out the cheese.  I would say that you should use small potatos or better yet, peel and dice your potatos first.

This is truly a family favorite ; have made multiple times and shared with friends. Neither of my adult children like mayo so using plain yogurt is a plus. The tang of the yogurt is nice and we really enjoy the Mediterranean flavor profile. I substituted cucumber for the celery ( my son's preference ) and did not use the honey mustard as my husband doesn't like mustard. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as the olives provided enough saltiness.  A really nice change up from the usual summer potato salad

I made this salad twice. The first time my changes were leaving out celery,  using olive oil, adding hard boiled egg, and  replacing plain yogurt with greek yogurt .  My husband really liked this version.  I read other reviews and decided to  try the  salad with only the vinegar, oil, dill, etc. on it and leaving off the second dressing, I preferred it this way.  I think the yogurt, mustard, and etc. drowned out the oil and vinegar.  In the future I will skip adding the  yogurt, mustard, and honey.  I really  like the flavor the olives add to the salad.  I really think with this salad it can be made either way.  My husband preferred sticking to the recipe and I preferred leaving out the second dressing.  Either version is tasty and a great twist on potato salad.
