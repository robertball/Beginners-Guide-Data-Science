Very easy recipe.  Great tasting.  Elegant looking.  My cooking club members loved it - came in a second place winner.  I had never cooled and separated lasagna noodles before (per the box instructions) - it works really well.  I swapped out a cup of ricotta for a cup of mascarpone cheese - decadent.  I also used twice as much nutmeg for more flavor.

We all thought this was very good.  Left off the nutmeg (didn't have any) and used cottage instead of ricotta cheese.  My DD is actually requesting it again!!

Delicious! I wasn't sure about adding ranch to the cheese and sauce but the flavor wasn't overpowering. I did not stand the rolls up; instead I laid them down flat with the seam on the bottom. I will make this again but I'll use my own cheese filling recipe and just add the racnch to that and to the sauce. Yum!

This was a very good recipe.  I forgot to put in the spices and it still turned out great, and tastes better as a leftover.

This tasted ok but the noodles really dried out on the top edge of the pasta.  The kids thought it was "fun" but when it came down to it didn't eat it very well because of the funny, hard to eat shape.  I think I'll make it again...BUT...in "normal" lasagna form.
