I tried this simply because I had been given a number of cucumbers and had some bananas I needed to use. I seeded and peeled the cucumber.  This has a great banana flavor with just a touch of cucumber and is not overly sweet. The lemon is not a strong flavor in this as written.  I used the juice of one good-sized lemon, which was close to the 1/2 cup in the recipe.

Easy to make! Good taste, but next time I will add a few mint leaves for extra flavor!

This is a great use of leftover fruit! I always freeze my bananas before they go bad for smoothies, so I had them frozen already, and had some cucumbers from our family’s garden. One thing I would recommend is peeling the skin of the cucumber beforehand! I didn’t think of it until it was too late. That is the only funky thing in my ice cream. But it’s a great flavor. I added some milk and butter to make it creamier and more like ice cream. It taste great and it’s fun to have healthy ice cream! Super easy!

I used orange juice instead of lemon juice. I blended one banana and one cuke and 3 ice cubes along with the sugar and drank as a smoothie.   I usually neglect to use my cukes and have too many ripening bananas so this was a healty way to use them.

We really enjoyed this sorbet.  It was very refreshing and you felt like you were having a cool summer treat while getting the good nutrients of the cucumber and banana.  My kids under 10 were not big fans but teenagers through adults loved it!
