I made this recently, and it was very good.  I did change the crust because the only low carb cookies I could find were peanut butter.  I made my crust with ground almonds, unsweetened coconut, cocoa powder, splenda and butter.  My only problem was that the chocolate didn't swirl very well, so the top didn't look very good.  I fixed it by melting some more chocolate with cream and glazing the top.  Then I sprinkled on some more coconut.  It was excellent.  Very rich.

The filling is really good...excellent and no hint of "sugar-free" taste.  This is like a real NY cheesecake.

This is so good. You would never know this what not the full carb deal. I have had this several times, and it is tasty and beautiful. The cookies can be found at Trader Joe's.

This recipe got so many great reviews that I'm tempted to wonder if I did something wrong.. but I followed the directions EXACTLY and this cheesecake was a total disaster. I didn't overbeat the whites but the texture was extremely "meringue-y," not creamy or smooth at all. It also tasted strongly of egg, and there was a MAJOR diet-sweetener aftertaste. The only good thing about it was the crust; I used 1/2 cup cinnamon almonds as the nuts in the crust and it was good. I won't make this again, sorry.

great base for endless changes and improvements.  I added a little vanilla extract and left out the chocolate swirl. added an extra egg and a pinch of salt.  topped with sugar free hotfudge, sugar free carmel and crushed nuts for a wonderful turtle cheesecake.  will try many variations on this. cooked up light. also for crust.  I used crushed almonds and a few grahm crackers, it was perfect.  plus i did cook in a waterbath so it would not crack.

This is probably the best low carb dessert I've had. I'm not sure that it's quite as good as some regular cheesecakes that I've had, but it certainly will satisfy a sweet tooth if you're on a low carb diet.  I went to Trader Joes, as suggested, but couldn't find the chocolate cookies. They did have an almond chip biscotti (0 carbs) which seemed to work just as well.  It was pretty easy to make.  I did have a little trouble getting it to swirl.  Definitely let this one chill overnight.  It seemed to taste better the next day.

I wanted a low-carb cheesecake, and chose this recipe because of the reviewers listed on the front page. Some said that there was no hint of a "sugar-free" taste, which I totally have to disagree with. I used Splenda for the recipe, and it still had a very strong, bitter after taste. My husband and I were craving cheesecake (we're both low-carbers), but neither of us could finish our first piece the next day. I put the rest in the freezer to pass along because I hate to waste the whole thing, but we won't be eating it. I guess it is worth mentioning the plain filling did taste better without the chocolate. Maybe it's the real sugar in the dark chocolate that makes the artificially sweetened cheesecake taste so bad?

I made this cheesecake for my boyfriend's birthday because he is a low-carb freak!  He loved it & so did all his friends who aren't into low-carb.  He must have eaten 1/2 the cake himself!  I had trouble with the chocolate slivers but it was fine without.  I couldn't find low-carb flour but it's only 2Tbsp.  I liked it too and I'm not a low-carb fan normally!

i made changes to it, because the low carb option wasn't necessary. make sure to cool the chocolate well after melting it or it will curdle the eggs. the higher the cocoa percentage of chocloate you use the richer flavour it will have...it is a fantastic cheesecake!! if low carb isn't important to you there are many ways to cut corners in this recipe but still maintain its amazing flavour!!  email me if you want to know more!!

Wow! Pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend, who is on a low-carb diet, loved it!  I found it is easy to swirl the chocolate if you spoon it over the cheesecake in a zigzag pattern.  While doing so dip the spoon halfway into the cheese batter.  Then take a knife and run a zigzag in the opposite direction.

I liked this recipe very much and ate up the whole cheesecake within the week.  It kept me feeling full for a long time and my blood sugar stable.  The hubby did not care for it that much.

We changed the flavor of this cheesecale and did not use any cookies in the crust, just extra nuts but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We flavored the cheesecake with lemon extract, and stirred a small amount of seedless, no sugar added raspberry jam into a 1/2 cup of batter and swirled it through the lemon batter. This is an excellent cheese cake and I will be making it for several occaisions.

This is my favorite cheesecake!  I made it yesterday, but used pecans, 1/3 C Splenda and 1/3 C butter (instead of cookies) for the crust.  I added 4 eggs (instead of 3) and used zero-carb vanilla whey protein powder (from GNC) instead of baking flour. I also placed my baking pan in a pan of water while I baked it.  I cooked it for 60 minutes.   When it cooled down, I made a low carb frosting with 1/3 C heavy cream (whipped until stiff),  4 oz cream cheese, 1/2 C Splenda and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Then I topped with a grated mixture of 2 oz unsweetened chocolate (melted), 2 Tbsp coconut oil and 2 Tbsp Splenda which I placed in the refrigerator until hard.  This cheesecake was moist, delicious and flavorful.  This is my new go-to cheesecake recipe (which has saved me on my low-carb diet)!!

I didn't do the extra topping on the top. My cheesecake is hard and dry. At 50 minutes and it was overdone.

It was easy and so delicious.   I was delightfully surprised and would highly recommend it.   I did not include the nuts/chocolate on top because I didn't think it needed it.

This cheesecake is an excellent "healthy" version of a very unhealthy original. I made this cake the first time trying to cut more calories by using FF cream cheese....BIG mistake. It ended up tasting nothing like cheesecake. Even my boyfriend who loves every creation I come up with didn't like it. The second time I made it I used 2 regular cream cheeses and 1 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Came out awesome! I also used sugar free pecan shortbread and macadamia nuts for the crust, put those in the food processor for a little bit until they were small crumbs. I also added cinnamon to the crust which gave a really nice flavor. Overall great recipe!
