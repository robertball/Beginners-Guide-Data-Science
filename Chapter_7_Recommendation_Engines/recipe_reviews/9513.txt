The recipe is fine BUT some very important steps have been missed which is why some of you have had troubles.  Temperature is VERY important and is why some have not had the brittle harden for them.  You need to use a candy thermometer and bring the mixture up to 300 degrees.  Then, REMOVE from heat and add 1 tbsp of butter and then the baking soda.  The butter should help it not over react and bubble over but you do want the bubbles because this is what makes the brittle, well, brittle! ;O) Also, warm up the pan that you will put the brittle into, this will also help it to spread.  Hope this helps everyone because this is a good recipe!

Once I added the baking soda and salt the mixture foamed up and almost out of the pan.  Then after putting it in the pan it NEVER hardened!  It was chewy and stuck together.  I guess I must have done something wrong, but I'm not sure what that was since I followed the directions.

This is exactly what I was expecting with Peanut Brittle..  Although it is extremely chewy once it warms up in your mouth.  Anyone know if there is any check I can do that would make it less chewy but keep the same taste?  This was very easy to make too!  Loved it.

I don't know what i did wrong but this recipe did not work for me twice.  The directions are not clear as to how long it needs to cook.  Does it need to boil the whole time?  please be more specific.  I'm not a novice but I felt like one.  It is nothing but GOO.

This is great!! To anyone that is making this the first time...it really takes a long while to get the mix to the perfect boil! Take your time and they are no fail!! I added 1 teaspoon molasses only because that is what my gramdma always did! It is great!!!

The recipe failed to mention that the syrup and peanuts should be removed from heat before adding salt and baking soda.  My brittle came out too airy and I think this would have helped.  Also, the brittle did not spread - at all.  Did I cook it too long?  Sorry but I think I am going to try another recipe to see if it turns out better.

This is the best peanut brittle I've ever tasted!!!  I had to make it a few times to perfect it, but once you get the rhythm down, it's amazing.  If cooked too long, it will burn the second the baking soda gets poured in so be careful.

This recipe is wonderful.  The candy was thin, cripsy and perfect.  The only draw back was that it was only sweet. I always imagined brittle to be more on the salty sweet side.  If your looking for that effect, I suggest you use salted peanuts or add more salt.  Other than that, it really is a wonderful recipe.  4 stars for me

This was a good brittle recipe but I think I will go back to my one that is just sugar, peanuts, water and salt.  I think that one has a nicer "texture".

This recipe has been passed down through 3 generations in my hubby's family. I'm now passing it to the fourth. We use same ingredients list but instructions are different. We bring the liquids/sugar to a boil on high heat in a cast iron 10" skillet then turn to medium heat, boil it to the thread stage then add nuts. Leave the temp. the same and cook until fragrant and nuts are a toasted color. Turn off heat, add the butter, salt and soda, stirring well. Pour on buttered sheet with sides. Cool, twist sheet to pop it up, turn over and break into pieces. Easy and delicious! Always gets raves. I"ve made 10 batches this year. We gift it. I made a first batch today with golden syrup instead of corn syrup for a food allergy. It set up perfectly! Edit*12-9-10. I forgot to mention that I have used up to 2 cups of nuts at times, and also used raw almonds, pecans or hazelnuts in place of the peanuts. All worked fine. Love the pecans or almonds batches. The hazelnut one was just ok, and I love hazelnuts. Just not in this. I've just bought raw cashews to try, too.

This recipe was delicious, HOWEVER, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you heat the mixture to the "soft ball stage" using a candy thermometer BEFORE adding the nuts or it isn't going to harden properly! And either use butter before adding the baking soda or make sure your pan is plenty big because it does bubble a lot when you first add the soda. Also. Let it spread in the pan on its own, don't try and spread it even :) hope you enjoy!!!

I found this recipe several years ago, and have been using it ever since. It isn't Christmas without it. It does take a little time, but it is well worth it. The finished product is a crispy foam that is delicious. I do add 1 t of vanilla when I add the baking soda, but other than that, the recipe is perfect. I have made cashew brittle with this recipe, they were already roasted so I just waited for the syrup to be very close to the right brown and added them at the end. If you work fast, you can spread the brittle once it is on the cookie sheet, for a minute or two it will continue to foam. Just remember that it is napalm at that point, and treat it as such. Even after it is too cool to spread, you can get a burn that feels like it will never quit. This recipe is the one sweet recipe that I get requests for at Christmas. Off to the kitchen now to make some for New Years!

I didn't make this one. I just want to give some advice. In order to get this to the proper consistency, you need to heat the sugar, water, and corn syrup to 300 degrees. It will take a while to get there. If using raw peanuts, make sure you add them earlier. If you don't, they'll still be raw. When I make brittle, I add the raw peanuts at around 225 degrees. Make sure you have everything ready to go, once you reach 300 degrees that is when you should add the salt and baking soda. Stir quickly, and then spread it out.

I've always been scared to make peanut brittle b/c I remember watching my grandmother make it and burning her forefinger, middle finger and ring finger when she spilled it on her hand one time.  I am MANY years older now, and I have a child of my own, so I had to suck it up and learn how to make this on my own b/c my grandmother has passed, thanks for the recipe, it was easy, and I will be able to teach my daughter now thanks to you :)  BTW, it tastes just like I remembered :)

Turned out great. Did change things a bit though. I halved the recipe because I didnt want a ton of candy, also added a little vanilla and butter along with the baking soda. Using the hard crack test worked great as my candy thermometer fell apart the last time I made candy.

This is some fine peanut brittle. I used raw unsalted peanuts as one member suggested to keep from burning the peanuts and it worked fine. I also made two (2) batches one ,I put red food color and the other I put green food color and it was a big Christmas hit.

I made this recipe for the first time last year, and my family liked it so much, they asked me to make extra this year.  You MUST make sure you heat to the temperature the recipe says--and the only other thing I noticed is I didn't even have enough to fill one cookie sheet.

I should have read the reviews prior to making.  It's been 2 hours and it is still nowhere near hard.  I'm going to have to put it in the freezer or let it air out for days. I'm assuming that since I put the baking soda in that I can't liquefy it on the stove and cook it again.  It's almost like caramels but doesn't hold the shape.

I love this recipe.  It does take a few attempts to prefect it though.  You need a candy thermometer. The temp must be at 300 degrees for it to set as a hard candy.  If you don't get it to the right temp you end up with chewy candy.  I also added a little bit of Vanilla extract when I heated the corn syrup, sugar and water.  I found I didn't need to spray my cookie sheets.  The brittle, when it is cool enough comes right up ready for cracking.  Lets use some common sense people, start with a large enough pot.  We have a chemical reaction occurring, with approximately 3 cups of ingredients and the only way it would boil over the pot is if you are using a sauce pan.  Smarten up!

fairly simple recipe.  I didn't have a candy thermometer and was pleased that the recipe stated what the appropriate appearance was.  I did the old cold water test when the nuts turned brown and was mid way between soft and hard ball stage.  It was simple to finish at that point, though I did not need two cookie sheets, one was plenty.

I make it every year at Christmas and everyone loves it!!!  I make it as directed and heat 285 or above and it comes out nice and brittle.  The butter makes it too greasy and chewy.

I agree with previous messages, the recipe did not firm up. After a few tries, I believe the secret is to make sure you boil out all the water and then the brittle will firm up correctly.

So far so good.  It's not all the way cooled yet, but I followed the tips of another reader and I think that helped. Let it get up to 300 degrees F and then put in the salt, baking soda and IT butter.

Did not make two cookie sheets full and get hard too quick.  Maybe a little butter will help. Otherwise pretty good peanut brittle!

Even though I followed Cookin4Six's advice, the brittle did not... brittle. It remained soft & chewy. The reason I'm still rating this recipe 3 stars is because it did taste good, it was just peanut toffee, not peanut brittle.

I've used a very similar recipe, but this is a "fix it" for those of us who end up with chewy brittle.  I've made peanut brittle for probably forty years and even recently ended up with brittle that just wasn't crunchy (yes, I used a candy thermometer).  Not wanting to waste it, I put probably a cup at a time of the finished brittle into a microwaveable bowl and nuked it on high for approximately 40 seconds.  I then (using a hot pad) poured it back onto the cookie sheet and spread it with the back of a spoon, because the thinner, the better.  When it cooled, it hardened and was just as tasty and successful as it should have been the first time.  Just remember, that bowl from the microwave will be extremely hot!

I always make this in a double batch. have made it many times now. it's my favourite by far.  I use dry roasted nuts for a different flavour and I do add butter to relax the foaming reaction with the baking soda (my pot isnt big enough otherwise!) I also like to add some vanilla or almond extraxt when I remove it from heat upon reaching 300 degrees.  Yes, it changes the flavour and I like it but that twist isn't for everyone.  try it the way she's written it first before altering it unless you're an experienced candy maker (definitely get to 300 degrees for it to get brittle). this recipe is wonderful as is.

It was amazing, it tasted just like the store bought kind. I cooked the corn syrup mixture until it reached the crack stage.

my family absolutely loved this recipe after I added the butter and baking soda as explained by another reviewer. I actually made a double recipe and after about 20 minutes of it setting up and cooling off, I realized I should have made a quadruple recipe! They ate it so quickly I ended up making more the next day.
