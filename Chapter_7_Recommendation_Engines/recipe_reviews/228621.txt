I loved the idea of this with the canned fruit but the flavors just didn't do it for us. Too much smoke and not enough spice.

SUMMER IS COMING. Peaches jalapenos what isn't to love? I was incredibly excited to make this bad boy BBQ sauce and I was not disappointed! This is a new favourite and I will DEFINITELY make it again. I used seven drops of smoke flavored liquid and that was plenty! Next time I will probably double the peaches and the jalapenos just to see what happens. Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious, I used it to marinate chicken and then grill it. We saved a bit for dipping sauce as well. 

I didn't brown the garlic, I just added garlic right out of the jar, and I didn't use liquid smoke because we didn't have any, and it was still awesome.
