this was an easy recipe to make. for those who want a short-cut, replace the 'flour+water+milk' and beef bouillon cube with 1 can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup + 1 can water. works out the same.

My Husband flipped over this recipe. I did use the entire can of evaporated milk, subbed granulated garlic for the garlic salt, used Better than Boullion instead of the cube, added cayenne pepper, left out the extra salt and served over rice. He ate it all... I had ice cream for dinner. Thanks, HardCore-Mama... hubby was in hog heaven!

This was a very easy recipe with nice flavor.  Living in Savannah, shrimp and grits is a staple, but even though my husband is a native and I've been here 5 years I had yet to find a recipe I wanted to try.  This was it!  My husband loved it and I would not hesitate serving to guests.  Definitely better served over grits than rice. I used fresh garlic and half and half as that was what was on hand.  Turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

I was really happy to find this recipe, but I had a few other things on hand I thought I'd throw into it:    - equal parts fresh garlic and ginger (one clove)tossed in along with the onion.  - quarter cup of white wine  - added paprika for some colour  - chopped half a tomato and added it in (i did this after tasting and found it lacking in a bit of sweetness, it turned out to be a great touch as it really complimented the sauce)  -stirred in freshly chopped parsley at the end.    Overall tasted great, I think next time I'll try giving it some heat with a chopped hot pepper and another dimension by adding fresh cilantro.     My philosophy is always go with the fresh natural ingredients so I'd always go for a clove or two of garlic rather than the garlic salt or powder.

All I can say is OH MY GOSH!! This dish was amazing.  Even my boy child (7) loved it.  I served it over grits and that is the only right thing to serve it over.  It is very filling too.

The only reason it has a 4 star rating is because the fat content!!!!  Otherwise.. it is soooo good.  My husband likes it with grits instead of rice.  Don't change a thing.  You don't need to.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I did however make some changes due to not having ingredients recipe called for. I used 3/4 C beef broth, 3/4 C 2% milk inplace of the evaporated milk and the water and beef bouilon cube. I also used 1 T garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I served this over polenta and had spinich. I also had rice for the not so brave ;) Mt entire family enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again!

Great dish however rather than using garlic salt, I used garlic powder and salted to taste.  Alot less salty.  I also prefer the shrimp gravy mixture tossed with cooked pasta.  Much more tasty!!!

This was fabulous!  I used 2 cloves of garlic in place of part of the garlic salt, just because I grow garlic, and have lots of it!  Also added some scallops.
My husband loved it also!

A very simple recipe with lots of flavor. I too added garlic and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt that made the taste more intense. I will do this recipe again. Thanks for the good recipe.

One teaspoon of salt (not one tablespoon!) was more than sufficient - I would perhaps use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon of salt in the future.  I made with chicken soup base instead of beef and added chopped garlic.  Good served over rice.

For some reason when I follow the recipe it comes out kinda salty, but I just water down a bit and serve over rice with peas and it's good.

Can't say we cared for this dish very much. We found it bland and greasy. Pretty much a waste of good shrimp.

I love this dish!!! I tried it out tonight, and my daughter wanted seconds; and she's only 2yrs old. I followed all instructions except for using a whole bouillon. I used a half a cube because I seasoned the season prior to adding it to the gravy. I will definitely make this again.

This was really, really good, especially on a cold day! I added the whole can of milk and some extra water to stretch the gravy a bit, and since I didn't have chives, I added a couple of shakes of Parisien Bonnes Herbes from Penzeys and a couple of shakes of Old Bay Seasoning, like I saw in a similar recipe. I didn't use garlic salt after reading some reviews, and used the powder instead with just a couple of pinches of Kosher salt. I served mine over Jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth in my rice cooker. I will definitely make this again!

I gave this recipe a spice up by adding a dash of cajun spice and a splash of tabasco sauce. My husband went nuts over it!! next time i will use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt as it was a little bit too salty for me. all in all a great yummy dinner! thankyou.

This was awesome!  I didn't have any evap. milk so I dissolved the beef bullion in 1 cup of regular milk.  Used fresh garlic as the other's suggested and it was salty enough with the bacon. We had over rice but want to try over grits, a southern favorite.  I also added cajun seasoning to add a kick to the gravy.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe, probably not a family staple, but something new and interesting to eat.  I didn't have beef bouillon, so I added a little chicken bouillon instead.  I also doubled the amount of flour, water and evaporated milk.  It was just right, any less would have been skimpy.  We had rice and biscuits with it, as I didn't know which would be better.  I think the biscuits were my favorite.  My son loved it and wants it for breakfast tomorrow.

I really like the flavor of this gravy...I think next time I may use pork chops instead of shrimp, and have it over some biscuits. The gravy tastes geared more towards pork or chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great. My daughter is Lactose intolerant so I couldn't use the evaporated milk, so we used Lactaid instead. All we had to do was omit the water and double the measurement for the evaporated milk. It worked great. Thanks for the wonderful dinner ideas.

Totally AWESOME...added the garlic and the parsley. Also wanted a bit more of the gravy so used the whole can of evaporated milk and a bit more flour. Put in the shredded carrots and peas and served over rice....next time I think I will add fresh mushrooms....Simply easy recipe on a busy day from work...the kids gobbled it right down & asked to make it again soon

Way to salty! If I were to make this again I would use only 1 tsp. of Garlic salt not a tablespoon. Or salt to taste. Otherwise it would have been a great recipe.

For those worried about fat or calories this recipe is super easy to lighten up...I substituted 4 TBSP(1/4 c) Kirkland real bacon bits for the bacon and used a whole can of evaporated skim milk...otherwise made the the recipe as written (oops, also added a can of mushrooms)and it was delish! Even my picky, shrimp leary children loved it! Wrote it in my recipe calculator and it was really low in fat, cals and high in protein...win-win. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

Excellent quick recipe for a busy night!  I used beef broth and garlic powder instead to make more of a sauce for the grits I paired it with and added a couple of dashes of creole seosoning and tabasco to boost the spice.  Thx!

Delicious, versatile recips. I doubled the sauce and followed other suggestions by adding peas, shredded carrots, and crushed red pepper flakes. We have lots of fresh basil growing, so I chopped in 3 tablespoons' worth. Used a soy mixture (with ginger, lemon, and honey) in place of the salt (unfortunately making it a little grey-ish), turning this into something like an asian-influenced etoufee.

We served this over egg noodles.  Nice and easy meal.  Next time I might throw in some shredded carrots and peas to add some veggies to this meal.

My husband and I thought this was good.  I used about 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of garlic salt, based on other reviewers saying it's too salty.  My husband actually thought it wasn't salty enough, but I think that's because I didn't salt the rice enough.  He also said it needed spice, so maybe next time I'll add a little cayenne.  I used a baked ham steak that I cubed and cooked.  It didn't leave any fat in the pan, so I added about 1 TB each of butter and olive oil after I removed the ham.  That sort of 'deglazed' the pan and got the ham flavor in the mix.  I would have liked more gravy - maybe next time I'll increase the gravy ingredients.  With the modifications I mentioned for next time, hopefully this will turn into a 5 star meal.

It was great just the way the recipe stated.  I did make one small change... I know the bacon grease makes a big difference flavor wise but I have a very hard time knowing I'm feeding my family all of the bad fat that is in it...so I left a bit of the grease, scooped out most of it and replaced it with butter.  It was delicious!

I recognized right away that this recipe, as written, was going to be way too salty.  I made two small changes. I changed the tablespoon of garlic salt to garlic powder and because the gravy was too thick for my taste, I added a couple extra tablespoons of evaporated milk. My husband and I both preferred it over grits. It's a keeper and maybe next time I'll try to spice it up a bit with a little cayenne!

This has been on my list to try for a while.  Finally made it and I absolutely love it!!!  I made some cheddar grits and served if over that but I should have just made grits as the cheddar was not needed.  Excellent.

I am a pescatarian so instead of bacon grease I   seasoned olive oil and used vegetarian chicken bouillon. It turned out great over rice and shrimp! My fiance even put it over his steak and loved it!

This was a big hit in our house!  I went with another posters advice and used cream of chicken soup and water instead of the flour / evaporated milk / bullion combination.  Also added some dry chicken gravy mixture and creole seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a very easy recipe.  It is quick to make.  However, it is very salty!  The tablespoon of salt on top of the bouillon was too much to take.  I threw it away after 2 bites.  This would be a good recipe if only a teaspoon of salt.  You can always add salt later if needed.

WOW! Loved it. The family calls it Heart Attack shrimp because of cooking the onions/garlic in bacon grease but there were no left overs (lol)! I did add a lot of extra liquid, almost the whole can of milk plus some water. I wanted more of a gravy and thought it was to thick. I just kept adding as I cooked until it was the consistence I thought it should be. I also used fresh garlic, as others suggested, and added salt to taste. We had over rice and it was a big hit. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a tsp. of garlic powder and about a tsp. of salt per other reviews about this being too salty, and that seemed to work fine.  This has good flavor and is relatively easy to make.  I thinned the sauce just a little after I saw how thick it was.  We served it over penne and enjoyed it.  I would like to try it over grits.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  It was delicious.  I served one serving over 1/2 cup of rice, and it was the perfect portion.  We've tried many shrimp recipes, mostly shrimp and grits, and all are too rich and filling.  This one was perfect and my husband said it was his favorite of them all.  Definitely a keeper.  I think I'll try it with baby shrimp next time. . .

Incredible recipe, but like everyone else said, it's a little salty. Four stars, but next time I'm positive it will be a five star dish if I cut out the salt where possible. If country ham is used, you'll need some bacon grease or maybe shortening.
