Very good.  Followed the recipe the first time I made it and would like to have the chicken been more brown and the sauce less thick!  It was still tasty and moist, but next time will add some garlic, milk and will brown the chicken.

Our whole family loves this recipe.  If you don't mind that the chicken won't be as brown (it's covered in sauce anyway), try covering the baking dish for moister chicken, and you won't have the problem of a sauce that's too thick, either.  Absolutely delicious, and a nice creamy consistency to the sauce.

Very GOOD! I only had dried Rosemary and somewhere I read that you only use 1/3 of dried herbs called for in recipes if they call for fresh, but I ended up adding the whole Tbs anyways. But some of my dried rosemary was still hard after it was finished so I would definatly use fresh next time. Added a small amount of milk ad served the sauce over my baked potato also. We loved it.

This was a great recipe!!  I tweeked it some tho, I made it for 4, and added 4 cups uncooked rice with the soup mixture. Nestled the chicken in the rice bed, covered and baked for about 40-45 min till chicken was done.  Stir the rice before serving. It's a great way to have a flavored side dish with the chicken. My family really liked it

This is sure to become one of the recipes I make often -- it is easy and very tasty. I used the herb-flavored cream of chicken soup, which gave another nice layer of flavor to an already wonderful dish. Fresh rosemary is a must for this recipe.  Adding some milk to help thin the sauce a bit, as some other reviewers have suggested, is a good idea.

I loved this recipe and it was a big hit for dinner.  Even my finicky 7 yr old liked it!  I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1/2 a cup of white wine to the mixture before pouring over the chicken.  I also seared the chicken first before baking it but it really wasn't necessary.  A nice easy recipe that I'll use again.  Yet one more way to make chicken.

This is such a quick and easy dinner- and it's great for leftovers. I thin the sauce with a little milk and some chicken broth and also add rice to the dish.

Awesome!  Few suggestions...1) I lined the pan with foil for easy clean up.  2) I sprinkled some lemon juice in the pan and then in the sour cream/cream of chicken mixture!  3) I added some milk to make the mixture not so thick.  4)  I sliced one garlic clove into the mixture as well. It turned out great!  I used all white chicken strips and served it with steamed white rice.  All the extra sauce I used over the rice and placed the chicken on top!  One of the best meals I've had and made!!!

The flavor of this was ok, although I think it was a little bit too piney for my taste.

My 3 year old rarely eats chicken and he LOVED this! I made my own soup (chicken white sauce) and just made the thinner version since everyone said they cut it with milk. Turned out plenty saucy. Great over rice to soak up sauce.

I made this last night for several friends and everyone loved it!  I added a little garlic and served over angel hair pasta.  I had this again today for lunch and I think it was even better on day two!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I added some chicken broth, to thin.. garlic and pepper for extra flavor following comments of others.. It was not enough, the chicken was very bland and boring.. Also there is sooooo much sauce you could do 8 pieces of chicken.

So easy and the sauce is amazing! I used light sour cream and the consistency was still great. Definitely recommended for those of us who have no experience cooking but want to make something great!!

I always have my eyes peeled for quick and easy dinners for the busy weekdays, and this one surely delivers... rosemary is one of my favorites, and to me it makes all the difference. Although, it is quite rich and creamy so may not be for everyone unless you like richness!

I think it would have tasted better with some garlic in it. I used 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream to make it healthier.

This was very easy to make but really just tasted like another ho-hum soup and chicken recipe.  Not bad, but I won't make it again.

This tasted very good and my guests liked it, one asking for the recipe. To critique, the chicken has no color other then the sauce which is a creamy pale yellow. I think the next time I'll try lightly browning chicken first.

I also used 1 tbs of dried rosemary but I first sent it through my magic bullet blender to kind of ground up the dried herb.  It came out really good. I will most certainly make this dish again.

I made this for Sunday dinner and we all liked it.  It was easy, tasty, and the sauce went great over the baked potatoes. I took others' advice and added a pinch of dried garlic and about 1/4 cup of milk to the sauce, so it wouldn't be too thick.

Didn't care for this one. Think it was too much sour cream. I used dried Rosemary. I browned the chicken first otherwise it would have turned out really weird, way too much sauce also. Won't make it again.

I did not really care for this recipe for the following reasons.   This recipe turned out very salty and the sauce was too thick.   I used Campbell's condensed cream of chicken soup.   The regular variety of soup and not the "healty request" variety.   This is possibly why it was too salty as the sour cream would not add extra salt.  I would recommend using low sodium cream of chicken soup.    I also thought the sauce was too thick.   I would not make this again.

My husband loves rosemary, so I thought I'd give this a try.  We only had fat-free soup, and dried rosemary, so I doubled the amount of rosemary, added some garlic and herb flavoring, and the 1/4 c. of milk recommended by others - and it came out great.  It looked a little funny - I'd cooked it covered to keep the chicken moist, so next time I'll let it brown a bit at the end, but my husband ate two pieces and suggested that I give this recipe the highst rating possible, so I think he really liked it.  I'll definitely make this one again.  And it's SOOOO easy!

This turned out terrible! The chicken got dry and the sauce was too thick!

Not bad but the sauce was a little too think (although tasty).  I added extra rosemary and some potatoes and it turned out really well.  Next time, I'll throw in some wine to thin out the sauce.

The sauce was much too rich for my taste.  The chicken came out very tender but I don't think I'll be making this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit. It was really easy to make, but I think it definitely needs some salt. It was a bit bland, imo.

I had read reviews about the sauce being too thick so I added a little water too it before pouring it over the chicken. I also marinated the chicken the over night and added garlic powder and about a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce into the sauce to give it a tiny kick. My boyfriend loved it! He made sure to go up for seconds :)

The texture of the cream of chicken soup is odd and overall it was bland, but very easy to make.  You might want to add some garlic, but I doubt I'll make this again.

I enjoyed the chicken in the sauce.  My 5 year old daughter did not really like the sauce noted by the scraping of it off. My husband liked it.  The left overs did not get eaten.  I would make it again because it is easy and tasty.  I would make less next time though.

This chicken was pretty good. The guests I had for dinner loved it. I also added a half a cup of white wine into the mix, which added great flavor. The sauce was a perfect consistency, but there wasn't quit enough of it, so I will definitely make more next time.
