These were tasty and I would recommend using a clear glass because with my addition this drink looked great too.  I used 1 1/2 shots Captain Morgan, to only 2 shots pineapple juice.  Then I mixed and poured over ice.  I added the cup of lemon/lime soda, and poured that in the glass.  Finally, I added a dash of grenadine, which sinks to the bottom and comes up creating a sort of "sunset" look.  As a matter of fact, we're calling these "florida sunsets."  These had just the right amount of kick, but still went down smooth.

Great Punch.  Made it for my niece's bridal shower last weekend and the guests loved it.  I touched it up with a bit of cranberry juice for color and made an ice block of pineapple and cranberry juice for the bowl.  Fill the container for freezing with 1/2 of one juice and when frozen fill the rest of the bowl with the other juice.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, we just eyeballed the proportions.  We also added grenadine for color.  They were delicious!

Delish.  Used organic pineapple juice, the dash of grenadine is must add.

Made this on our family beach vacation, did not care for it at all. Three people tried it and not one taker!! I think it was just too sweet for our taste.

low alcohol, but the "fizz" from the carbonated soda is a nice change for a drink.

Pretty tasty! You can't taste the rum at all. The pineapple juice gives it a distinct after-flavor.
