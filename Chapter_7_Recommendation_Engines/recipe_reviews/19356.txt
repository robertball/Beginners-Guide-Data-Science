This sauce was amazing!  My friend raved over the smell when she came in my front door.  She said it smelled like "real sauce".  When she tasted it her exact words "It's just right.  Not to sweet and not to spicy".  I will definitely make this again.  My one suggestion would be to make sure you use the Italian Sausage, I don't think it would be as good with out the extra kick from the seasonings of the sausage.

This recipe is THE best!  I had a similar experience as the last person who commented...my boyfriend walked in the door and said he could smell the sauce from outside our home and that it smelled fanstastic.  I stayed completely true to the recipe except for a couple of things-which were only due to personal preference.  I used 1 lb of ground beef instead of sausage and added half of a chopped white onion while seasoning beef.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes that gave the sauce a small zing.  We LOVED it and both agreed this recipe will be a staple in our home.  Thank you so much for submitting this :-)

This was a very good sauce.  I used a whole pound of sausage, because I had a pound in the freezer that I wanted to use.  Great flavor.  I used fresh basil and oregano, but added those at the end.  I did add some dried in the beginning.  Also used 3 cloves fresh garlic, and some dried onion.  I used two larger cans of tomato sauce (14 oz?) instead of the smaller ones and one can was no-salt-added.  This sauce was still a little too salty for me, probably because of the evaporated liquid during the long simmer.  The long simmer is essential though (I did a little over an hour) to develop that great thick texture and great flavor.  Mine got a little too thick, so I added a splash of water at the end.  Served over whole-wheat spaghetti.

This sauce was surprisingly good! All I did was add some rosemary, doubled the garlic powder and added a pinch of brown sugar.
Served over thin spaghetti with garlic toast and a caesar salad. I will make this recipe again... we scarfed it down!
Thank you, Foxworth!

Everyone loves this recipe.  I use it exactly as shown, but use the italian diced tomatoes with spices.  I also use a crock pot and cook for 4 - 6 hours and it turns out absolutely fabulous!

Wow, this recipe is amazing.  I found it better than restaurant quality!  Only one thing I changed was using minced beef, instead of Italian sausage, and adding finely cut red onion.  Although the original yield probably serves about 4, I find that I can't help but eat about 1.5 servings so probably better to increase the amounts :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I rarely follow a recipe to a "Tee," but this time I did.  I don't think this could serve 6 people.  My family of 4 are not big eaters, but there was not enough for us 2 adults and 2 children.  I let it simmer for nearly 3 hours (having to turn it off from the "low" setting,) several times.  The sauce turned out rather thick.  The flavors were very good though. Because of the thickness we did have to add just regular jar sauce.  I did rate this following the recipe before adding the jar sauce.  Thanks for sharing and I will try again!!!

This was the first spaghetti sauce I had ever made and my last. It's so easy and it works well in pretty much any recipe that calls for spaghetti sauce. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was okay, but not the wonderful sause I was expecting.  The more I try to add to it to fix it, the worse it becomes.  I tried adding fresh basil, brown sugar, garlic powder, parsley....it just isn't very good.  Sorry.

Very good restaurant quality spaghetti sauce!  I used no salt added tomatoes and 32 oz of tomato sauce (4 8 oz cans) and did not add additional salt.  Served over spaghetti instead of mixing it in.  I simmered the sauce for a couple of hours and the recipe made 5 cups of sauce.  This is now my go to spaghetti sauce recipe!  I think next time I'll add in some mushrooms (just because we love them, it is perfect as is).

Delicious!  This was a huge hit with my family.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a whole pound of sausage since that was what the package was.

My family loved, loved, loved this recipe!!! I made a few changes I decide to go with 1 lb of sausage we are meat lovers. I also added liquid basil at the end instead of dried. Which was perfect! I let it simmer for an 1hr 30min. The cans of tomatoes were italian flavored. The tomato sauce was Newmans Own tomato and basil sauce. *Important* DO NOT ADD SALT! THIS RECIPE ENDS UP VERY SALTY ON ITS OWN. I think next time I cook this I will add sugar like others have mentioned they did. This recipe is going in our family box.

I followed this recipe to the tee and still found it to be too acidic for my taste. I'll try to add some vinegar next time to contrast the acidity

It was a bit watery and also acidity. Adding a tablespoon of sugar helped. I could add more sausage or ground beef..but overall, it was good. I probably just need more practice.
*********************
Above was my review last night however this morning, the sauce seemed a lot richer and better! Oh and no need to add salt. I may try with sweeter sausuage next time.

This is so delicious! I made a couple changes. I used sweet italian turkey sausage, 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano and added some dried crushed red pepper.  My husband loved it too. Will make over and over.

Not a bad sauce. It is very acidic if you follow the recipe exactly. I doubled the recipe to 12 servings, and followed it exactly except for one thing - I used roughly half the amount of tomato sauce. A total of 32 ounces and no more. This alleviates the acidity of the sauce significantly.

We made this spaghetti recipe today and it was absolutely delish! We did change a few things, we used a whole pound of sausage and a pound of ground turkey. I also added a 1/2 tsp of garlic salt. It made about 7 servings. Next time I'll probably add some mushrooms. I saw several people who said that it didn't make enough sauce. I didn't let mine simmer all day, (really only about 25 min or so) and it made a generous amount.  Enjoy!

I'm not a huge fan of Italian Sausage and felt that this tasted just like any other spaghetti that i've ever had.

Awesome recipe!  I followed it almost exactly, except that I used 1lb of mild italian sausage to which I added diced onions and sliced portabella mushrooms while browning.  To the sauce, I skipped the extra salt because of reviews that the sauce is already pretty salty, and added three cloves of fresh garlic and about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I simmered for about three hours.  It was so yummy.  Next time I will use a one to one ratio of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes - I like my sauce more chunky and this was just a little runny for me.

This recipe was good, my first time making my own spaghetti sauce.  Turned out way to salty and I took the suggestion of another rater and added a pinch of brown sugar, I would recommend adding a tablespoon instead and omitting the salt to taste.

We didn't have enough cans of the tomato sauce however we had tons of fresh tomatoes and tomato paste so we made it work. Also added sauteed onion and garlic, as well as fennel seed and rosemary. Tasty.

I made this for a friends suprise birthday party & it was a hit!!! Everyone was raving at how amazing it was. A few people including the birthday boy even asked for the recipe commenting that it was the best spaghetti they'd ever eaten & they'll never eat sauce from the jar again...I have to admit, this is the best spaghetti recipe I'd ever tasted too. This will definitely be a regular meal from now on!

Awesome sauce! I only had one can of tomato sauce, so I took another can of diced tomatoes and pureed them. I added a little bit of white sugar and crushed red pepper flakes. This might just become my go-to spaghetti sauce recipe. Thanks! :)

It was really tasty- a little runnier than I am used to.  I need to find  a way to thicken it up.  The flavor is very good!

Good, basic sauce using what I have on hand. I didn't have Ital. Seasoning, so I just substituted a little more of the basil, oregano, and some marjoram.

Excellent sauce! I don't know how to stray from an original recipe the first time out so this was to the letter. Definitely a "simmer all day" sauce but would have been good to go after about 90 minutes. Only change/add I would make would be to add some crushed red pepper for a little "kick."

Great recipe! I simmered the sauce for only 40 minutes and it still tasted great! I added rosemary and used 9oz of fettucine, too much sauce was leftover. Otherwise, great recipe!!

Whole family loved it! There was a little bit of leftovers but as soon as my older brother tried it, he devoured it. I did use 1 whole pound of the sausage, just because so did end up using one more can of tomato sauce. It was delicious!

I made this for my family and had nothing but raves.  I used reg. hamburger instead of the sausage and was told by all I had to make it again and again.  It beats the jars all to heck and its not a time consuming recipe to make.  I let it simmer all day and I nor the family could eat enough of it.  Even if there is no visual sauce on the spaghetti you put it in your mouth and the full taste of the sauce is there.  I can't say enough about this sauce.

Like others have mentioned, your house will smell wonderful as the sauce is stewing in the kitchen. To deal with the acidity, I added caramelised onions (at the start, for natural sweetness) and brown sugar (periodically, to neutralise the sourness), and that seemed to work well. Remember to serve with some grated parmesan cheese on the top! Will try with mushrooms and other vegetables in future. (Also, I omitted some of the herbs because they're awfully hard to find/expensive in Singapore, but I doubt that that would have radically changed anything.)

I stumbled on this receipe when I was looking for an alternative to SauceInAJar. I needed some tomato based pasta sauce to go over the chicken parm bundles, so I didn't add the spicy italian sausage, though I threw in some roasted red pepper flakes and a splash of EVOO to compensate. I also forgot to add the bay leaves - I think that they would have been the cherry on top to this recipe. My husband kept saying "this sauce is really good!" throughout the meal and I don't think I'll ever be "allowed" to buy premade sauce again. As another reviewer commented, it smells and tastes like "real" sauce. Thanks for sharing!

This is my new favorite spaghetti sauce recipe! It's hearty and delicious! I had to make two changes to the recipe based on what I had on hand. I used ground beef instead of the sausage and substituted 1 quart of canned tomatoes for 2 of the cans of tomato sauce and the can of diced tomatoes. I will be making this recipe again and again! Marvelous!

Spaghetti Italian Haiku: "Better than a 'jar', but didn't make quite enough. Needs some more sausage." The only changes that I made was using fresh garlic, basil and oregano, rather than dried, and I halved the recipe for 3 of us, serving the sauce over our spaghetti, rather than mixing all together, and there wasn't quite enough. Definitely smelled wonderful, but if I made it again, I'd increase the sausage, and if I let it simmer longer (to thicken), I'd consider a splash of red wine and possibly some sugar to cut the tomato acidity.

For me this was really salty. I didn't add any excess salt, but I simmered it for about 5 hours and it was so salty once it cooked down. I might try it again, and get no salt added tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.

Simple, tomatoey, thick and chunky. I used ground beef and seasoned it with some Italian seasoning and sage and made it as italian style sausage like as I could. I only had 3 cans of mexican tomato sauce so I used a can of crushed tomatoes for the 4th one. I let this simmer an hour and half and although it was fine, it just didn't measure up to our favorite recipe. We had a nice meal. I enjoyed fixing this new recipe, thanks for sharing it :)

Ummm HELLO...YUMMY!  According to my family, it's the best spaghetti I've ever made!  I didn't make any changes and let it simmer for a few hours to get the sauce nice and thick.  Not to mention it's very quick and easy to make :)

Very good!! I didn't have any IT sausage on hand so I mixed some IT sausage seasoning with some ground beef instead. I made this last week and stuck it in the freezer. Thawed it out and served over penne today. Very good and works well in the freezer.

First of all, if you don't want to bother with meatballs this is the sauce you'll want to make.  Delicious, with a capitol "D"!!  I used 5 links which I believe was closer to one pound of meat, removed the casings, chopped coarsely, then browned and drained. Rather than using garlic powder, I chose minced garlic and used approx. 1 tablespoon.  Omitted the salt and pepper, which I usually do away ways. Covered and simmered for several hours.  I didn't find the sauce was too thick, but would recommend adding either tomato sauce, tomato juice, or red wine if you find it that way. The longer it simmers the better, but could be ready in 1 hour if you are in a hurry.  Love it, thanks FOXSWORTH.

This was a good recipe! Easy and quick. It wouldn't feed six adults, though, not by a long shot! My only complaint was that it was a bit thick, might add a half cup or so of water to thin it out a bit. Cooked it for about an hour and a half, gr8 flavor!

I think this recipe is wonderful.  My hubby hates spaghetti and he ate 2 servings.  I doubled all of the spices and added in a tablespoon of chili powder.  I also added some fresh garlic and a half can of beer.  Will make again.  Thanks Foxworth!

Delish! I made some alterations based on other reviews. I sauteed some chopped onion in olive oil in the sauce pot because I'm an onion lover. I think it added some nice flavor to the sauce. I didn't add any salt as others as suggested, and used reduced sodium tomato sauce. I added some sugar toward the end because it still tasted slightly acidic. I also added some red pepper flakes to the sauce because I used sweet Italian sausage and wanted some kick to it -- which it def did! I let it simmer for 2 hours and it was so good!

Great sauce. The recipe was very good. I substituted ground beef for Italian sausage and added an onion. The sauce was missing something, but I can't recognize what it is.

I loved this sauce. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and slices of red bell pepper. I used mild Italian sausage links.

This recipe was excellent.  It had the perfect amount of seasoning, and the italian sausage was wonderful in it!  I have never made a home made sauce before, but this turned out better than i had anticipated!

I only made a few changes after I fried the sausage up completely as I had it draining and set to the side I put 2 tablespoons of butter in my skillet after the butter melted I added all the seasonings that are in the original recipe but I also added one pack of mushroom and onion dry soup mix then I added my sausage back to the skillet and added the spaghetti sauce after the noodles were done cooking I mixed everything together I put cheese on top of it and I baked it in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes covered with aluminum foil

Simmered it for 6 hrs and added 1/2tsp sugar to take edge off of a tartness.  Everyone said it was better than store bought.

Overall I thought it was good.  As the sauce simmers the flavors really start to come together.  If I had more time, I probably would have simmered it for a couple more hours on low.  First, simmer to reduce and thick with a lid slightly ajar.  Once it's to the right thickness and consistency, continue simmering with the lid on to retain the moisture.

Really lucked out.  Just picked this recipe a couple of years ago with looking for a spaghetti sauce recipe.  GREAT!  Note:  I have never been able to find the 6.5 ounce can of tomato sauce so I use three (3) 8 ounce cans.

I used 5 Italian sausages, 1/2 jar of tomato paste, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, chopped garlic cloves instead of powder, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, ground black pepper (no salt) and 1/2 package spaghetti.

I made this for my husband and roommate and they absolutely LOVED it!! We had a gentleman over giving us quotes for our backyard and he couldn't stop raving about how amazing the smell was from outside! The only extra seasoning I added was minced onion and I used a new Italian seasoned sausage made by Oscar Meyer. Absolutely delicious. I let it simmer for approximately 3 hours (the longer the better) due to my husband and our roommate raving about how good it was, I've already had friends asking for the recipe!! I will never go back to sauce in a jar!!

Delicious as is but for my family we use a full # of meat and generally I double the recipe and use 1# lean gr beef and 1# turkey Italian saus. Also, browned 1 med onion and fresh garlic with meat for dbld recipe. I also use 1-26.5 oz box POMI finely chopped tomatoes and 2-26oz boxes POMI strained tomatoes for dbld recipe. May need additional seasonings to taste as POMI a is all natural. (Salt/more Italian seasoning and I add rd pepper flakes)

I make this sauce all the time. I like my spaghetti sauce a little sweeter so I add some brown sugar (1tbl spoon). Sometimes I add ground beef. Everyone in the family loves it.

I really enjoyed this dish particularly because of the amazing taste and it's simplicity. It was a perfect balance of sweet and spice. The cons. Like I said, simplicity is fantastic. I myself, and this is just me, enjoy my sause chunky. Adding a mixed array of mushrooms, black olives, and chopped garlic.  Other than my particular interest in texture, I'd have to say this dish is amazing and will defiantly make this dish a norm in my house.

This is the first time I tried it, It's a really quick dish to whip up for dinner. I used chicken bits instead of Italian sausage since i didn't have any, and I added broccoli to stretch it. All in all, I was pretty satisfied!!

My family and I love this recipe! I used a pound of mild italian sausage and to cut down on the sodium I used 3 of the 6.5 cans of the no salt tomato sauce and 1 regular one, then continued with the rest of the ingredients. Simmer it up to 6-7 hrs. It turned out perfect. My 10yr old eats it all up every time. Thanks for the recipe!

We absolutely LOVED this recipe! I didn't have any sausage, so I just left it out. Added some red pepper flakes. To be honest, the batch that I froze and reheated was even better than the first time! THANKS for this GREAT RECIPE!!

I've made this several times and am about to make it this week again. I let it simmer for 8 hours and enjoy the wonderful aroma that this sauce creates. I usually use a pound of sausage because that's how they come in the store. I find that this taste better the longer it simmers. I use to let it simmer without a cover, but I lost too much liquid. Now I leave it covered and watch the heat to make sure it doesn't start boiling. I made it once with cheaper sausage and it wasn't as good--pick good sausage! Thank you so much!

Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe. My family loved this! The only change I made was to use fresh garlic and fresh onions. Simmering the sauce all afternoon thickened it and created an amazing flavor.

I LOVED this! I only altered it very slightly, but it was so simple and so YUMMY! And very aromatic. My boyfried told me that it could smell how delicious it was from all the way down the hall of our apartment complex. I added a few teaspoons of red wine and some onions, and some mushrooms, but that one was only because the BF likes them so much. WOuld have been great without, too. I used a little less then a pound of ground sausage, and found that I needed to add a couple more cans of tomato sauce to thin it out a bit. Then I just altered the spices to fit, and it was great!  A little tip.... cook your spaghetti for one minute less then you need to in the water, and then cook it for the last little bit in the sauce. Pulls in all of the wonderful flavors.

The first time I made this I rated it five stars, and declared it to be the best thing I had ever eaten in my life.  The second time I made it, I realized this was because I had accidentally made it with tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  it makes ALL the difference.  Just keep in mind that this will make the recipe higher calorie. 

i also took the sausage out of the casing before i browned it so it was like ground meat.  i also added much more sausage.  if you're cooking for 6, use 16 oz instead of 11.

Very good and very easy to make.  My whole family really liked this, so I will make it again.  I did use fresh garlic instead of powdered and didn't have bay leaves on hand so had to omit them, but the sauce was good just the same.

Very good and very easy. My daughter usually hates spaghetti, but she liked this one. The only thing I did differently was use ground beef rather than Italian sausage.

This is very good. I made the mistake of using only half the sauce but next time I'll know better. Also, I used "The Best Meatballs You'll Ever Have" and substituted the 1 tsp of Cajun Seasoning needed in this recipe for 1 tsp of "Creole Seasoning Blend."

Hearty, esay and quick recipe. Gave it 4 stars because the original sauce was a bit too acidic for my taste. I simply added 1 tbsp sugar and the problem was solved.

This is very similar to the spaghetti recipe I use. The only difference is I use 1 lb of ground beef along w/the Italian sausage, and I don't use bay leaves...and I add some sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato sauce....very good recipe!! Definately a keeper

I am a lazy cook, so I made a simplified version of this recipe and it was perfect for my family and our tastes (we like our food spicy). I used prepared spaghetti sauce (basil and garlic flavor), a can of petite stewed tomatoes in garlic and olive oil, about a tsp. red pepper flakes, and a package of spicy italian turkey sauage that had been browned and drained. Combine all ingredients, cook over low heat for about an hour and serve over vermicelli. The secret incredient is the spicy italian sausage-- it makes the sauce, in my opinion! Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure whether I should be *rating* this.  I didn't have any Italian sausage, and so tried to season regular sausage until it "smelled" like Italian.  I do think, however, using actual Italian could really "make" this recipe, possibly upping that score.  But it was still pretty good.  Unlike many pasta recipes, I thought the pasta to sauce ratio was good.  (Usually too much pasta.)  I cooked this about 4 hours, which worked well.  I would have liked for it to have a hair more kick, but I think that's where having used the right sausage would've helped.
