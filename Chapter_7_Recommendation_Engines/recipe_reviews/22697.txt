This was a hit at our family Christmas party last night.  The only problem with this one is that the topping doesn't stay on.  To fix this next time  I would mix the cream cheese mixture, cheddar cheese, broccoli and tomato together (reserving some broccoli and tomato), then spread it on the baked crescent rolls, then top it off with the reserved broccoli/tomato for a pretty topping.

This was really good and worked well as a potluck snack for work because it was cold.  I'd probably use more tomatoes next time (like one), but then I really like tomatoes!  There's a lot of extra spread leftover, too, so one and a half of cream cheese (I used neufachel to reduce the fat) and 3/4 cup mayo (again used lowfat) might work just as well.  And using the lowfat stuff worked great, too!

Yum, this was a big hit!  I served this at a get toghether today and everybody wanted to take a plate full of these snacks home.  You MUST cut the cream cheese/mayo mixture in half, though.  I used 3 packages of crescent rolls, slathered a thick layer of the dressing on, and still had way too much left over!!  It was very tasty though, I'll definately be making this again.  Thanks Kim.

Everyone at my Christmas party loved this recipe! I would, however, back off on the amount of dry dressing added to the cream cheese and mayo.  We found the dressing alittle overpowering.

Excellent recipe.  Everyone loves this.  I used several different kind of veggies
as toppings, not just broccoli.  Red peppers, green onions, carrots.

I took these to a church function and they were a big hit.  I thought they were really tasty but they took a long time to prepare.  I took the suggestion to use a food processor to chop the broccoli but I think next time I would chop it by hand to make it a little more attractive.  Cut the squares with a pizza cutter.

This is always popular at parties as it is a nice alternative to the desserts that are usually served. I alter the veggies depending on what I have on hand. My fave is broccoli and cauliflower. The cream cheese mixture makes A LOT. 

The perfect amount without having excess is: 1-1/2 packages cream cheese, 3/4 cup mayo, 6 tsp. Ranch mix.

Great appetizer, a great veggie pizza to bring to social functions.  I tried adding crumbled bacon to one that I prepared, and the crowd loved it...likened it to a BLT pizza.  Great recipe, I'm sure there are a million other things one could add to jazz it up even more!

I was a bit leary of this recipe - it just didn't sound good, but I was wrong.  My guests raved about this appetizer - I made a double batch and every single square was gone.

very tasty, it's like a veggie pizza with a cheese sauce.  I was able to use all the cheese sause by putting a heaping 1/3 cup on each rectangle.  To keep the vegetable toppings from falling off gentle press them into the cheese topping just enough to hold them on. I don't know how this makes 12 servings, when the recipe only uses 8 rectangles from 2 rolls (4 rectangles each roll)  the next time I make this I will use all lower calorie ingredients. This one is loaded with calories.

This is always a great hit. If you have a little more room in your budget, I highly recommend using Boursin cheese in place of the cream cheese and ranch dressing. I also add a variety of veggies to this recipe. Love it! Thanx!!

This is very good. I made this for a holiday party, and everyone loved it! I only used about 3/4 the package of dressing mix, which I thought was the perfect amount. My sister called, and asked for the recipe to bring to a potluck at work, but I forgot to mention that I cut the amount of dressing down. She called after the party, and said that it wasn't as good as when I made it because the dressing tasted too strong. Oops. My point of the story is add less dressing, taste it then decide if you want to add more.

I had this before and it got rave reviews.  However, I didn't have most of the ingredients on hand.  I used mushrooms and green onions and added regular ranch dressing to the cream cheese instead of the powder.  Still, it was loved by every person who tried it.  I'll definatly make it again and experiment with it.  Maybe, I'll try it with bacon for a BLT effect like another person suggested or Ceaser dressing with parmasan.  OHHHH, the possibilities.

This was really good! I have a really hard time getting my 4 small kids to eat their vegetables, but I made this and they gobbled it up! I made a few variations. Instead of Cheddar cheese I used Mozzarella. I only had 1 8oz tub of cream cheese, so I had to downsize the mayo and the ranch. But it still came out really good! I will make this again!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some crescent roll dough and I had everything on hand to make this one. It didn't disappoint! Basically this is a veggie pizza, but with a thinner, crispier crust. I took this to work and it vanished quickly. This could easily be  adapted to include other vegetables. Thanks for a very tasty recipe.

There are 4 on this site that are all similar.  3 of my friends and I had school functions to go to last week and we each tried one for our own school.  Every one of them told me the got rave reviews.  If you look at the "More Recipes Like This" link on the recipe page you can find the different recipes and chose one to your liking.

I received LOTS of compliments on this appetizer at a recent BBQ.  Here's how I adapted it:
8 oz of low fat cream cheese, and 4 oz of regular cream cheese and 1/2 cup of mayo.  I mixed with it just about 1/4 of a package of the ranch seasoning, and then added a few dashes of garlic powder. (Otherwise I'm sure it would have been too salty if I used the whole pkg.)  I chopped some broccoli and a quarter of a red pepper really finely, and mixed those in with the cheese/mayo mixture before spreading it onto of the cooked dough.  Then, I sprinkled some extra broccoli on top, along with the tomatoes and shredded cheese (I used Mexican flavored cuz that's what I had on hand) AND 4 slices (crumbled) of crispy bacon. I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thx!

I made these for a party, and they were a hit.  I changed it by adding some grated parmesan to the cream cheese/mayo, and some shredded carrots and a chopped yellow bell pepper to the other veggies.  I think next time, I'll add less of the ranch mix to the cream cheese/mayo; it's a bit too salty for my taste.  I'll probably add half the amount, but add some additional spices.  You could probably halve the amount of cream cheese and mayo; we have a ton of the spread left over (but it makes a good dip for pretzels).  I used Neufchatel and low-fat mayo, and you'd never know!  Don't make them too far in advance, as they'll get soggy.

I halved the recipe and it turned out fantastic. The whole family enjoyed it. I think crumbled bacon would be a great addition. After all, isn't everything better with bacon?

This is a great recipe that always goes over well.  The only changes that I made was adding some diced sweet peppers and red onion.  Also I've never added the dry dressing only because I haven't had any, but I will try it next time.. Very tasty!  Thank you!

This recipe tastes awesome!! First tried it at a church function and I was so happy to find it here!  I added green onions, carrots, and bellpeppers because I am a vegetable lover.  My six year old loved it with just cheese and tomatoes, though.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for Sunday dinner guests, and I wished I made more!  So easy to make, yet such an elegant starter, delicious with a glass of white wine.  Went fast, and I had many requests for the recipe, so I just referred all requests to "AllRecipes."  A wonderful appetizer which appeals those with sophisticated taste.

I made these for a Christmas appetizer and everyone loved them. Thought I would need to double recipe but single yielded tons of squares!
Some of the younger kids weren't thrilled about the raw brocolli. KAMY

I cut down on the mayo and the ranch a little, just going by taste. This was a huge hit.

4 stars for overall taste and for something a little different to bring to our picnic-and most people loved them! As for some reviewers concerns about the recipe making too much of the base/bottom dressing-don't fret! Bring along the extra in a bowl and some celery and carrot sticks and you have an instant appetizer/dip! It's certainly the right consistency as a veggie dip, or thin it out with some sour cream and use the leftover as a chip dip! One thing my daughter didn't care for was not the taste, but the texture. Indeed, once they set out a bit, the bottoms get a bit soggy. I will make this again, but I think instead of crescent rolls, I will try some crisped-up Naan bread or some other type of thinner/crispier base, or maybe some focaccia for a twist. I also agree with seeding the tomatoes-that worked-but next time I may just use some colored pepper strips and maybe some chopped green onion with the broccoli, since they aren't as "wet" as tomatoes.

I have made this base recipe a number of times and it is a great for summer parties. Frequently I will leave out (or reduce) the mayo because I don't care for it. This will be a little harder to spread but with the right knife, no problem. Add the ranch dressing mix to taste, or try taco seasoning and top with peppers, green onions and olives for a change. I prefer to take the baked crescent rolls out of the pan after cool, then add toppings. Press them in with your hand a little bit and cut. I add a few extra peppers, fresh parsley, or basil as an extra garnish. Always a hit!

BE VERY CAREFUL! This recipe can go all wrong really fast. I took the suggestion to only use 3/4 of the ranch package. That was even a bit too much for me. I should have only used half. Also, I combined the vegetables (I used red bell pepper, broccoli, tomato, and green onion) with the cream cheese/mayo mixture to keep it from falling all over the place. This was also a bad idea. It was just too much. finally, I cooked the Crescent for 12 mins as mentioned in the recipe, but this made it too hard. I should have only cooked it for 10 mins. 
I will try this out again with the suggestions I mentioned above and without being so overly ambitious, but I just wanted to put the warning out there for those who thought of the same things.

Really good! Made mine as just a whole sheet instead of squares, and with white cheddar and cherry tomatoes. Still great.

My mom always made this for me growing up. Hers was much simpler, though. She only used cream cheese, carrots, & broccoli for the topping with some garlic sprinkled on top. One of my favorite things to eat.

These are a great appetizer! I like to leave the tomatoes on the side so they don't make the crust soggy and I add carrots and black olives. Occasionally I've been able to find the crescent rolls in a sheet (instead of individual triangles) and that works great. I usually don't use a full packet of ranch because many people find that a bit too strong. I've also used a cup of sour cream in place of the mayo.

I make this a healthier treat with reduced-fat rolls, cream cheese and mayo and it still tastes great.
