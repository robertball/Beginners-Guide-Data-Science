Wow, wow, wow! This is one superb dish! I used sliced black olives instead of chopped and also seasoned the chicken breasts with some seasoning salt and black pepper. Used bottled lemon juice as I didn;t have fresh on hand. Also, flatten out your chicken breasts before frying. What an excellent meal. Cannot wait to make this again for friends. Probably one of my top five recipes from Allrecipes.

I was really impressed with the flavor of this recipe.  I only made two changes (due to a lack of ingredients on hand):  I left out the olives (don't like them anyway) and substituted chopped cashews for the pine nuts.  My husband thought it was too sweet and suggested that next time we use double the tomatoes and half the raisins.  I really like the sweetness of the raisins, though, so I guess it depends on how sweet you like your sauce.  I also cut the chicken into strips before I cooked it, just because the pieces I had were really large, and it came out just fine.  I will do this again, with some sort of compromise between the raisins and tomatoes so that my husband doesn't have a little pile of raisins on the side of his plate by the time dinner is over.  This would be a great dish to serve for a dinner party, and you could easily make the sauce in advance, even the night before, which is what I think I'll do next time.

This has great flavor. I would double the sauce next time. I call this a dry pasta vs. a saucy pasta. I would also decrease the pasta. My changes were-decrease raisins to 1/2 cup, do not drain the tomatoes and added 1/2 cup chicken broth. I did use chicken tenders. I did not think the olives gave it much flavor.

This was really,really good!  The only thing I would have changed is to use chicken cut into thin filets or strips instead of the breast half -  took too long and not as tender.  I also added about 1 cup of chopped fresh tomatoes.  Great recipe!

I've made this twice now and I LOVE IT. I pretty much followed the recipe except I did without the pepper and olives. As the other reviewers said, the sauce is a little dry to DON'T drain it. Maybe next time I'll try putting some white wine or something to give it a little extra sauce or chicken brother. Otherwise very good (try tossing the pasta with lemon juice)

This was AMAZING! Wish I could give it 10 stars! This dish is exploding with flavor! Wonderful sweet/hot taste. Only thing I did different is marinate (in italian dressing) and grill the chicken instead of pan frying. You will not be disappointed!

Great recipe, not to hard and very professional.  It tasted restaurant quality. Next time I will use six breasts and  bump up the sauce a little bit with the same amount of pasta, making it six servings. Or I might cook less pasta.

I was so skeptical before I started this recipe, that I'm still surprised that I made it! It was really good. I didn't make any significant changes except for switching chicken tenders for chicken breasts. I definetely recommend this recipe!

I liked it, my husband did not- he said raisins belong in desserts. I thought the sweet/spicy was a nice balance, though I would have appreciated more lemon in the chicken. I think next time I will marinate it in the lemon or add some lemon zest.

I wasn't too sure about the combination of tomatoes and raisins but this really was very good.   My only complaint was that their was very little liquid in the sauce to keep the chicken moist.  If I were to make this again, I would not drain the tomatoes and possibly add some additional liquid.

I really like how the chicken tastes - being soaked in lemon juice before being cooked. Makes me want to do this to all the chicken I make! But the raisin-tomato sauce is just alright. Kind of took away from the fantastic chicken taste a little...

Delicious! I was a little afraid of the lemon zest (I thought it would be too bitter) but it complemented the flavour perfectly. I didn't drain the tomatoes, cut the chicken in bite - sized chunks and cooked it that way and used spaghetti instead of angel hair pasta, because we like it better. Thanks for this interesting recipe!

My husband and I like this. I dont know if I did this right, but it was pretty spicy. Ive added 1/4 cayenne to other recipes, but I thought this was way spicy. I agree with other reviews- definitely need to add some chicken broth and do not drain the tomatoes. The idea and basis of this recipe was good though. Might make again.

This recipe is unique, with a great flavor base.  My husband loved the lemon zest & balsamic zing. I made the recipe just like it asked, I think next time I'll cook the chicken first, pull it out to rest while making the sauce.  One less pan & the lemon will flavor the tomato sauce more.

This is a really tasty recipe.  I really like it because it has a quite different flavor from a typical tomato sauce.  The cayenne pepper adds a real kick of spiciness and the raisins add a nice sweetness.  After reading reviews, I made a couple of modifications: (1) I reduced the raisins to 1/2 a cup which I think was right; (2) I decreased the amount of pasta by about 1/3; (3) I added a couple of fresh small heirloom tomatoes to the can of diced tomatoes and like other reviewers, I did not drain the diced tomatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it really did come out very tasty.  I like how different the sauce is from most other pasta sauces I've made.  I'll be using this one again, definitely.

A wonderful sweet and spicy recipe that is a nice departure from the usual tomato or cream sauces.  I doubled the amount of sauce as recommended by some reviewers and cut the chicken into bite-size cubes.  I also left the tomato juice in and cooked the sauce a bit longer than recommended to really let the flavors blend.  I didn't have any golden raisins on hand, so I used regular raisins and it came out great!  I recommend using sweet onion to blend with the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar and raisins.  This dish will definitely be a regular menu item from now on!

Terrific! Light and tasty, easy to make for dinner at home or for entertaining. If serving for company, be sure to have a veggie side dish or a light dessert. Can't wait to make it again. :-)

This was very full of flavor and was a big hit at my dinner party.  I didn't use olives and I didn't drain the tomatos per previous suggestions.  I also added crumbled bacon right before I served.  The bacon was wonderful with the pinenuts and was a nice balance to the sweetness.  Also served with the shredded brussels sprout recipe.

Delicious!  My husband and I really enjoyed this for dinner.  I changed the recipe around and used cashews instead of pine nuts and left out the olives (I don't like black olives)and parmesan cheese.  I didn't have real lemons so I used lemon juice (and so left out lemon zest, too).  The reason it's a 4 and not a 5 is: 1) I didn't follow the recipe completely and can't vouch for the exact way written above; and 2) the number of dirty pots and pans...I have a small kitchen and three things on the stove all at once is really tight!

This dish was great! I didn't have all the ingredients, so I left out cayenne pepper, olives, pine nuts, and balsamic vinegar, and this dish was still DELICIOUS! The chicken was awesome, but the sauce was absolutely superb. So sweet and so flavorful. The raisins were the best part. Thanks so much!

The sauce had an awkward flavor and was not saucy enough to cover the pasta (even after adding wine and water to thin it out!)

This was SO YUMMY and healthy and easy to make.  I took others' advice and did not drain the tomatoes.  I'm glad I didn't, the dish could have used a tad more juice.  Next time I might try to add a touch of white wine or just buy crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I also left out the olives and seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and pepper.  I will definitely make this again soon!  Would be a great meal to serve when guests are over for dinner.

It was a little sweet for me, but still tasty.  Agree with all the reviewers that the liquid from the tomatoes should not be drained.

I was not too crazy about this one.  LOTS of work and a disappointment.  I had to give it 4 stars because my husband LOVED it!  It was too spicy for my 5-year old, too.

Amazing! This dish was fantastic! I normally look for the gourmet recipes on here. I didn't see if this one was in the gourmet category, if it isn't, it should be. I excluded the olives, and added the juice from the tomatoes to the sauce as suggested by some of the other reviews. I also marinated the chicken first in Italian dressing, and used a basil infused fettucini noodle. It was superb! I will absolutely make this meal again, and next time I'll submit a photo. It looked beautiful.

This is a killer dish-- sure to impress a date.  take the  advice of others and increase the sauce amount ( double it). I agree with other remarks that the tomatoes probably shouldn't be drained-  still  a great dish though

The flavor combination of this dish is unbelievable... so unique and layered.... it was like eating something off of the Food Network shows! I found the sauce to need some liquid and added some pasta water but next time I will use crushed tomatoes with the liquid.  I can't wait to try this out on company!

I never would think raisins and tomatoes would work well together, along with the lemon, but it all works well.

Agree that the flavors were fantastic! Surprising combo. Only two changes I made - added an extra dash of balsamic vinegar and used pecans [or walnuts] instead of pine nuts [just not a fan of pine nuts - and yes - aware that pine nuts are not nuts!!]. Fun texture. Lemon zest key, too. A must do recipe!

So good!!!  I made this recipe as shown except I added the juice from the tomatoes, homemade chicken broth, decreased the pasta by 1/3 and omitted the olives because I didn't have them on hand.  Next time I may even try grilling the chicken.

I wanted to do something with chicken and raisins, and this recipe came up. This is such a great dish that you can change some things here and there and it will still turn out great. I didn't have golden raisins, so I used regular ones, and I only used about 1/2 the amount, and I used green olives instead of black.  I also didn't have any basil, bay leaves, or pine nuts, so I just left those out. It still turned out to be delicious. I thought it would just be alright--something I'd try once b/c I can't think of what to make for dinner, but this will become one of my go-to recipes.  My husband loved it. 

I think next time, I won't drain the tomatoes so much.  Also, I only used 2 large chicken breasts, and it was just the right amount of sauce; if you use 4 chicken breasts like the recipe calls for, you might want to make more sauce.

My family really enjoyed this dish!  My kids thought it was a little too spicy, so for their sakes I might decrease the cayenne just a tad.  I thought it was the perfect amount of heat.
I cut the chicken into strips and tossed with the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and some fresh basil before cooking.
Next time I will quadruple the olives.  We love olives and couldn't taste them.
I only cooked 1/2 lb of pasta which comfortably served 5 (2 adults and 3 kids).  Any more than that would have been too much.
This would also work well with Brown rice or quinoa if you are not a pasta fan.

This sounds like it would be an odd combination, but it was surprisingly good. Nice summer dish.

The flavor of this recipe was great.  Next time I tried cutting up the chicken but sliced is better. Try cutlets, they cook more evenly.  It was also good without the cheese.  I did save and use the tomato liquid and added it to the sauce.  You can simmer it down to thicken but I wanted all the sauce I could get to put on the pasta.  I agree with someone who said it was restaurant or better quality.  Used sliced instead of chopped olives and almonds instead of pine nuts. BTW angel hair cooks in only about 4 min. Thanks, Larry from Susie

We liked it but it was too dry. I did use regular instead of the golden raisins. They were on hand but that may have caused the problem.  I’ll try it again and post next time. We liked the flavors and nutritional value.

I just made this dish tonight and it was pretty  good! It was a bit on the dry side but that makes the flavors shine through and  you can really taste and enjoy the dish.  All the flavors taste amazing together.  I added 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes for more juice.  While chicken was cooking on pan I began to slice it up so it would cook faster and added salt and pepper and seasoning salt.   The lemon makes the chicken nice and moist.  Was a great dish over all!!!!
