Thank you Aunt Ro!!!  These are easy and wonderful, and the best thing is they stand up beautifully to adjustments if you don't happen to have everything or want to add something.  I live outside of the city in the mountains, so (especially with fuel costs skyrocketing) I can't just run to a store to pick up extra ingredients.  The first time I made these I made them exactly as written ... DELICIOUS! Everyone raved!  We invited some friends over for a cookout, and among them were people who had been here the first time I made these, and they asked if I would make them again.  This time, however, I used what I had in the cupboard for beans: black beans, pinto beans, red bean and Garbanzo beans.  I added some chopped garlic and used chopped saute's Brats instead of the burger, and threw in a chopped jalapeno for good measure.  MORE raves!!  I made a huge crockpot full, and even had people ask if they could take some home ... but no leftovers to speak of.  So feel confident with this recipe and make minor changes if need be - this is a keeper!!

We made this for a party and it was a big hit.  The only change we made was to add some pressed garlic.  Definitely will make this again.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes for picnics or a supper meal. Doesn't have to go in a slow cooker. If you don't have one, just either simmer on low on top of the stove or place in an oven at 250 temperature. Delicious.
Great served with green salad and cornbread.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it's always been a big hit. The only change I made was using more bacon. Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce was wonderful with this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!  Instead of butter beans I used red beans and added fresh jalepenos.  Everyone at our bbq loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

I had pulled 3 different baked beans recipes off this site to try for Labor Day.  My husband LOVED this recipe.  It was super flavorful and came out perfect.  I doubled the bacon and used Sweet Baby Ray's and it was by far the best I've had.

Removed butter beans, added extra baked beans. Also added the bacon while it was cooking in the crockpot, but I may use the oven next time. Great recipe, everyone loved it and I'll be making lots for the 4th! :)

I made these for a potluck and got rave reviews. One of my favorite features of Allrecipes is being able to read what others have tried and how it worked for them, which gives me the confidence to stray away from the recipe if I'm missing an ingredient, or if it has one I don't care for. In this case, I too used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, added a bit of mustard, and used kidney beans, garbanzos, great northern, canned limas, and I only had one can of baked beans. It was still delicious...it's really the sauce that makes it, so you can vary the beans any way you want. Prep was quick and easy - this will be my go-to potluck recipe from now on!

These were a hit! I opted not to put in the butter beans because when I opened the can, they did not look a bean I would want to eat. :) Everything else was the same and they were YUMMY!

I made these for a BBQ and everyone there raved.  I had to give the recipe to all there. I didn't have any butter beans so I used kidney beans. Can't see any difference. Will definitely make again.

Loved these beans.  DH usually will not eat them but he flipped over these!  He espically liked the butter beans.  I will make these again for a potluck or family gathering.  Because the recipe as stated makes a ton!  I cut the recipe in half, 2 servings for dinner, and 1 serving for lunch the next day.  Then I put 7 individual containers in the freezer.  So math from me would be about 20 servings for a whole recipe.

used a little less brown sugar and 4 strips of bacon since its so expensive lately. kept everything else the same and used a home made bbq sauce. i omitted the ground beef since this was a side dish to a bbq meal and i added about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic since we like it so much. good recipe i love the butter beans in this!

Made these on Christmas Eve for my wife's birthday/family get together and they were a hit. It say's it makes 6 servings but actually makes a LOT more. Also I made these in the oven instead of a slow cooker, I just baked them at 250 for for 3 hours. AMAZING will make again.

Very good recipe, I do think they are on the super sweet side but I think in the future when I make them again (I do plan on keeping this recipe) that I won't make them as sweet maybe even add a little heat too. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this recipe for our office holiday potluck this year and what a hit!!  I went to pick up my crock pot afterwards and there was not even one bean left in the pot!  Several people asked for the recipe.  Will definitely be making these again!

Awesome.  I made it exactly how the recipie called, only reducing the sugar by half.  I used a sweeter BBQ sauce and didn't want it overly sweet.  So, good.  This will be my recipie from now on.

Best baked beans I've ever had. I also didn't have butter breans so I subbed black bean in it's place. I also partially cooked the bacon about half way and I added it about half way in.

These beans are to die for !!! Made these for Labor day picnic and everybody loved them. I did not have butter beans on hand so I used red beans and followed the rest of the recipe as written. This will be my go to baked bean recipe from now on !!! Someone compared this to Calico beans, it is similar but much, much better ! Thank You for sharing Aunt Ro's great recipe!!!
Made this for the second time in a week. This time I used 1.5 pounds ground beef, fried it as directed with a large diced onion and added a little minced garlic, I fried the bacon first and left a little bacon fat in pan when I fried ground beef, onion and garlic. I used a 28 ounce can of Bushes Original Baked Beans plus a 15oz can, and used 2 cans pinto and 2 cans red beans. Because the BBQ sauce I used was sweet (Wegmans brown sugar BBQ sauce) I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I fried up a pound of bacon and added half pound of crumbled bacon to beans and saved other half to sprinkle on top of beans in crock pot. Like I said already in this review these beans are too die for good !!!

I must admit that I did tweak this recipe a bit!  But it was all yummy!  I traded out the ground beef for Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage, and I traded out the butter beans for white beans.  Because the baked beans I used already had brown sugar in them, I just sprinkled a little over the top when I was heating up the batch.  I probably went a little short on the catsup and bbq sauce.  But still, really, this is in the realm of this recipe!  I would really suggest that Italian sausage is a GREAT way to tweak this recipe!  In fact, this recipe just calls for tweaking however you like your beans!  We won't ever buy Honeybaked's baked beans again because they are too sweet for us.  This was really really good!  Thanks, Aunt Ro!

My Sister Deb made a roaster full of these beans for my Pig/Turtle/Chicken/Homemade Polish Sausage Party and they were the hit of the night! She told me about AllRecipes.com and I couldn't sign up fast enough. What an awesome site! Thank You, Sharon Louise

These were OUTSTANDING! I only used one can of the butterbeans. Someone else wrote that they didn't use them b/c they didn't like the way they looked. I said the same thing but make sure you DO use them cause they were very good. I took them to a mother's day cook out. . . Everyone was fighting over the last of the pot!!! No Joke! But they completely filled my crock pot so make sure you have enough people around to eat them! They definately won't go to waste. Great for Memorial Day!!! Easy too!!!

I thought these were really great. I followed the recipe, except added the bacon to the dish while cooking. Next time I don't think I would put them in the slow cooker, just mix them together the night before, then just bake in the oven. Will definitely make again. My husband also thought they were great.

Delicious!! Only change I made was I added a few chopped jalapenos. It gave it a nice sweet with a little spice.  I will most definitely be making this again!

This was good but a little too sweet for us. Next time I might reduce the brown sugar to 1/2c. or less.

These are amazing....and I don't even like beans! I have had compliments on these everywhere I take this dish. FYI, I hardly ever add bacon and I only use baked beans with pork.  This could be a "main dish" not just a side dish. Thanks for this recipe!

Amazing! I did change it up a bit...I added a can of kidney beans and 2 tbs. chili powder; sweet and a tad spicy. I was also short on time so I baked in oven for 1 hour at 350° instead of the crock pot. So delicious!

Everyone raved about these beans at my family picnic!  I only made a a few modifications.  I didn't have bacon, but I did use the ground hamburger and Bob Evans ground sweet sausage that I sauteed together in skillet with onions and minced garlic.  I thought it might be overly sweet with one cup of brown sugar, so I used half and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

Every time we've served this dish, people have raved about it! Since it makes so much, if we're having it as a weeknight side dish, we'll freeze half the finished recipe and then have a side ready to go a different night.

Easy to make and taste delicious.  Instead of the slow cooker,  we cooked these in our smoker while our pork dinner was cooking.

This is the best baked bean recipe, may family loves it with my potato salad! I served it at Easter and it was a big hit.I also used it at a family reunion. There had been a family recipe on my Dad's side for something like this but I could not find it. Everyone liked this one even better.

What a great recipe!  I totally didn't follow the recipe ingredients because I had a lot of various beans in the pantry and wanted to use them up.  I also had an coil of smoked sausage that needed a place to call home.  They all blended well together and the sauce as written was just fantastic.  My only negative comment would be that the serving size is way off.  I  cut the recipe in half ans still had 6 servings.

Basically, the traditional Calico Beans recipe. Tasty and always popular, and you can make it your own by adding chopped red and/or green peppers, using hot Italian sausage or breakfast sage sausage in place of the beef.

Very good!  My only complaint/warning is to be aware of what kind of bbq sauce you are using.  I used Stubbs and it made the beans very (unexpectedly) spicy, which the kids didn't like!

I wasn't impressed at first when i put everything in the crockpot and gave it a quick taste.  But after cooking the flavors together for 4 hours, it all came together.  Very good beans.  I'll be making these again.

This was just great!  I did not have time to make it in the crock pot, so I just simmered it on the stove for about an hour.  Also, I only used one can each of the beans and it still made a huge amount of food.  I only had 1/2 cup of bbq sauce left but you could still really taste it.  I'll probably use that same amount next time.  I didn't have bacon so I left that out and my husband said, without seeing this recipe, that it would be perfect if it only had bacon on it!  So I'll be sure to include that next time.

After reading other reviews about quantities, I halved the recipe for hubby and me, as he is not too fond of beans.  I had 2 Italian sausages cooked and left over, so chopped those fine and added in place of ground beef.  Also fried the onions with 2 cloves garlic.   I used pinto, mixed beans and canned pork and beans.  I think you could incorporate any type of similar beans (white, navy, red kindney, pinto, garbanzo etc.)  I cooked for 6 hours in slow cooker on low.  At first I thought it was too sweet, but hubby ate them without any complaint so far, so that's a good sign.  They are quite tasty!  The portions are a little misleading as we eat them as a side dish, so half of this recipe actually will do us for 4 meals... I've already frozen enough for 2 of us for a meal, as per another reviewer's suggestion.  Very simple to make and will try this with the ground beef too... It's such a simple recipe to be creative with.... thanks to Aunt Ro!

I use whatever canned beans I have on hand, and instead of canned baked beans with bacon, I fry up a few slices of bacon, crumble it, and add it to the top of the beans before baking.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really good and super easy.  Added garlic and sausage.  Used turkey instead of beef....pinto beans with jalapeno and kidney beans instead of butter.  Used amount of brown sugar listed.....way too sweet!!  Maybe 1/4 c next time.

I had this at a b-day part a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to make it for my family. I pre-made it today for dinner tomorrow (busy school night!). I'm going to throw in some all-beef hotdogs when I warm it and serve it with toasted-buttered hotdog buns. The only change I make is to use 28oz cans of baked beans and 2 big cans of kidney beans instead of the pinto and butter beans, because we just like those better. Fantastic recipe!

No changes and YES I will make it again.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were to be cooked in a slow-cooker.  Too hot to run the oven right now

I made this, but substituted chick peas for Lima beans. I only added half of the brown sugar, but it was still extremely sweet. Next time I make this (I’ll definitely make it again) I will omit the sugar and let the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce take care if that part. Everyone at my party LOVED this dish.

The only change I made was to add a pound of venison in addition to the ground beef. I wanted more meat to make it more of a main dish. It worked out well, and my husband liked it. I'm sure I will make it again.

Ever time I make these beans I receive many compliments and recipe requests.  Sometimes I substitute the pinto beans for whatever I have on hand - often black beans.  Thanks for the recipe!.

This was an absolutely superior dish. I brought it to a family potluck and it brought the house down. Everyone loved it. I made it exactly as was written. I didn't change a thing. Delicious! Thank you so much for making me look good!

Made as directed several times. Always a big hit at gatherings. Not your mainstream beans. Delish.

I cut back on sauce mixture to 2/3 c. Made it for a side for pork chops. Everyone loved it! Had 1/2 leftover  to taste myself. It's a keeper!

Made these several times exactly as directed and always end up with an empty dish.  These beans (almost a chili) are the best!!!

Absolutely splendid.  We've added other beans, such as garbanzo beans, black beans -- always a hit.  Have learned to cut the brown sugar way back, by at least a half.

Delicious and super easy! Made these as a side dish for a BBQ I was hosting and the Beans were a big hit! Had several people comment how good they were. I used very lean ground beef so there wouldn't be grease to deal with. Only "change" was that I cut back the sugar to 3/4 c. Will go with 1/2 c in the future, because my opinion is they could stand to be a bit less sweet. I'm sure the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce contributed to the sweetness. As a reference, I do love sweet slaw, cornbread, etc., just think it wouldn't take away from the recipe using a bit less sugar. I found butter beans at Whole Foods. I had no idea butter beans and lima beans were the same thing until I opened the can then Googled it to confirm my suspicion. Frankly, I can't discern much, if any, difference in taste between bean varieties, especially when cooked with so many other ingredients. For that reason, if you can find them, they are a nice addition as they provide an alternative  texture, color and size compared to the other beans, which makes for a good looking dish. Otherwise, I'm guessing most any bean will work.

Delicious.  To save some calories, I used brown sugar splenda.  To save some cleanup, I used real bacon pieces which I cooked along with the beans so the flavor would pull through.

I love BBQ baked beans, but I am the only one in my family of six. But when I made this recipe 5 out of 6 LOVED it! The only thing I changed was using dried onion instead of fresh and added a squeeze of mustard.
