This turned out great. I followed the measurements exactly, but used a 1.5 qt. casserole dish so I baked it 55-60 minutes. It was delicious. My hubby loved it and I loved how easy it was to make. I will definitely make it again. It's a keeper!

I too followed the recipe but added some leftover ham for a one dish meal.  I did leave out the thyme.
It's not a family favorite.  Substituted with a bit of 
rosemary which I added to the asparagus while
sauteing.  There are so many ways you can make this dish your own while adding different ingredients.  I think next time I just might try it has a Broccoli pie.  What a great way to put veggies in the chidren.

Great recipe, easily adaptable for type of meal and personal tastes.  I wanted a main entree that was all inclusive.  I made the recipe as presented with these additions:  Sauteed fresh, sliced mushrooms with asparagus.  Diced up some left over honey glazed ham and added to the batter.  Used a pinch of thyme and basil in the batter.  Prepared as written put in the oven.  20 minutes before taking out I topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and continued to bake until cheese started to crisp at the edges.  Because of the ham I used unsalted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe.  Put salt on the table for those who thought they needed it.  Will definately use Chef John's recipe again!

This was quick and easy to make and tasted great! I added sliced mushrooms and we really liked it that way. The thyme gives it great flavor but if you're not a fan of thyme, skip it or add basil instead.

The recipe states to cut the asparagus into 2inch pieces but the video states 1inch. One inch is better because it's easier to cut when dished up. The idea of sliced of mushrooms would add more flavor to this dish. The presentation is pretty and cuts easily out of the dish.

Nice, light texture and people at Easter church breakfast liked the hint of lemon.  Buy medium-sized asparagus and include the tops. Use finely grated zest of 1 lemon & scant 1/2 tsp. ground thyme per 8" x 8 " recipe.  Due to dairy allergy, made a non-dairy version by sub. unsweetened original almond milk for milk and olive oil for butter.

Tasted great but don't use whole wheat flour since it doesn't solidify as well (found out the hard way). Added some sauteed onions, feta and garlic powder as well, which fixed the bland flavour others mentioned.

I used frozen asparagus, which was a huge mistake. I let it thaw out, but perhaps I didn't dry it enough because it was saturated with water from thawing out. I ended up using them anyway, following the instructions here. The pie came out tasting bitter, like grass! It's my own fault for using frozen and not fresh, but I wanted to share my experience should someone else do the same thing!

This was my first attempt at a crustless pie, and my husband and I really liked it. Followed the recipe exactly and eating the leftovers for breakfast. A really good side dish for those who like asparagus.

I am a HUGE Chef John's Fan......I have yet to make one of his recipes that I was not delighted with!  I made this dish as a side for an Easter gathering and it was a hit.  My husband continues to snack on the leftovers and say's every time you have to make this again.  I did make a few adjustments mostly because I wanted to use some broccoli that I had before it went bad and while I was in the fridge, my fresh grated parmesan cheese was calling my name  I love cheese so we had asparagus, broccoli and fresh garlic with a bit of parmesan cheese pie and it was perfect.  I will try adding mushrooms in my next pie oh the opportunities are endless and of course I will pair with a great glass of wine!  Bon Appetite

This was an easy recipe. It just lacked flavor. Maybe using additives such as, sauted mushrooms would help.

Awesome! Skipped the lemon and added a smidgen of cayenne pepper, also added ham chunks and a layer of shredded cheese to make this a main course. Went over really well and I will definitely make this again. Can do just about anything with this dish, can't wait to experiment!

I liked this because I just love the taste of asparagus ... but that's all it tasted like was asparagus, really. No other flavors stood out. DH didn't care for it at all. I took it to a pot luck since it is to be served room temp, but it was tough to eat with a plastic fork. I might try the technique again with added spices and flavors to make it special (maybe feta, or goat cheese and bacon, or savory, sage, and parmesan.)

I sauteed an onion & a few cloves of garlic with butter till brown & then added the asparagus & left over shredded chicken. Added pepper, salt & herbs (not too much or it will be too overpowering). 

Love this dish as it is so easy to make, plus fuss free :-)

In my house spring means asparagus and mint! We hike every May in Point Pelee National Park to see the spring bird migration. The nearby town of Leamington has the first asparagus of the season for sale at farm stands. So I’m always looking for new ways to serve the bundles I bring home.This recipe calls for thyme. However, mint is peeking through the ground in my garden...and I think asparagus, mint and lemon are a heavenly combo! I served this as a side dish with smoked pork chops. It puffs up like a soufflé but has the texture of a smooth custard. It was delicious...and leftovers made a great breakfast!

This was a simple dish with a great presentation. Like other reviews I added items to jazz up the taste. Cayenne pepper
and pepper jack cheese on the top this time. But, will add sautéed onion, garlic, mushrooms and maybe grated cheese  next time. I think cooks can take this recipe and  “add or take away” ingredients to suit the taste they are looking for or to make it a hearty meal. Great recipe!

This was very quick and easy (and made with ingredients most people have on hand), and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I loved the lemon zest, although he didn't like that part as much.  I used 1/3 tsp of dried thyme because I didn't have any fresh.

I did not care for this recipe.  And it couldn't have begun to serve 8 - 4 of us would have polished it off if we'd liked it enough.  The pie came out dense and it stuck fast to the baking dish in spite of coating the entire thing with olive oil...

Very nice flavour.  The consistencey was similar to an Austrian pancake.   I loved the extra flavour which was brought out by adding a bit of sugar.  I Added Feta, green onions, and a little fresh chopped rosemary.  Mine didn't look so pretty but it tasted yummy.  Will make again!

I added jalapeños, ham and cheese. We enjoyed it and also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, the second time I made it.

I did add ham and baby portobello mushrooms other than that the recipe was followed to a tee. Had to cook 15 min longer since ham made more moisture. Family eat every last bite. I’ll definitely make again

Simple, easy to make and delicious.
The only trouble was that although I did butter the casserole dish the pie stuck onto to it so it was difficult to serve. Lining the dish with parchment paper might be better.

Nice, light dinner I paired with ham slices. Definitely cut the asparagus into 1/2” pieces for easier portions. Next time, I will add parmesan or feta cheese.

I made this recipe as directed.  This was an extremely simple recipe to put together.  I didn't have any problem mixing the ingredients to cook.  Once cooked it looked tasty.  My reason for rating it so low is because there is too much salt.  The salt made this pie inedible, it tasted as bad as a glass of salt water.  We could not eat it.  I was so mad that I had wasted the last of my asparagus on this pie.
I may try it again in a few months without all the salt.

The recipe was good but I added onion and parmesan cheese.  I also chopped the asparagus into 1 inch pieces.  If I make it again, I will decrease the fresh thyme and increase the lemon zest.

I made this recipe just as written and it was absolutely delicious!  The pie stuck to the dish a bit and I wonder if I cooked it a bit too long.  I am at high altitude and recipes that call for baking often turn out differently.  My husband and I really enjoyed the flavors and the fluffy texture.  Thanks Chef John!

This was pretty easy to put together. I followed recipe as written and I will make it again, but with a few changes. I will half the custard mixture, add bacon (why not?) and decrease the amount of lemon. I think I'd like to try this with broccoli too.

This was great just  the way  the recipe states. Maybe a little extra garlic would help,  but it was fine as is. This was not very filling, so barely 2servings as a main course.  VERY easy to make

What attracted me to this recipe was the fact Chef John served it at room temperature.  I was making Easter dinner for a crowd and needed recipes for dishes I could prep ahead of time.  This was simple to prepare and pretty good, but I think I'd like it better fresh out of the oven.

I made two of these for Easter Sunday and they were a BIG hit!  After reading several reviews, I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding chopped pre-cooked bacon, and sauteed mushrooms with the asparagus as directed.  That definitely added some nice flavor.  Also, I substituted garlic salt for regular salt in the batter mixture.  Then 20 min. before they were done baking, I sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on one, and shredded cheddar cheese on the other then finished baking.  Both were very good, and unfortunately, not much leftover!!

I am going to make it again!  Personally, I think it needs at least one more egg, but it is simple, turns out nice, tastes delicious.  A good vegetarian option for holidays.  I used flax milk instead of dairy milk and added a little shredded cheese.  Couldn't find fresh thyme, and I think it would have been better than the dried thyme I used.  I have tried it with dill and horseradish instead of thyme - very good; and if you want a "crust," just scatter a layer of cornflakes on the greased pan before you place the other ingredients.  Really excellent.

I added ham to make it more entree like. Skipped the lemon zest (didn't have one) and didn't miss it. Sprinkled with cheddar cheese when I took it out of the oven. OMG -- soooo good! It's a keeper!

I made this as a side dish for my Easter Sunday dinner.  It was easy and good.  I had learned how to make clafouti from Chef John's blog a few years ago.  Good video demonstration and easy to replicate at home.  This time I used a narrower, taller 2 qt baking dish, and left it in a little longer.  The low, wide Le Creuset baking dish works better I think.  (Mine was otherwise occupied when I made the asparagus clafouti, so I had to resort to another dish.)  This is a keeper.

We like asparagus. This was a nice change from roasted that I usually make. My husband thought it was ok; our friend really liked it. I added sauteed mushrooms, onion and a little garlic. Could not find lemon thyme, but I think it would definitely help with flavor. All and all...it was a nice vairation and looked great. I made in a 2 quart casserole dish which fit fine with the addition of mushrooms and onion.

This is a great basic recipe but can be changed to suit tastes.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese and it came out great.  Mushrooms and ham are also great addition ideas.  I also think it would be good with crumbled bacon.

I liked that this recipe was very easy to make but I have to admit that it tasted bland to me.  Yes the thyme and lemon added some flavor but it just tasted like it was missing something.  I tried sprinkling cheese on top but that still didn't help.  Maybe mushrooms or ham like previous reviewers had done would fix it.  Honestly, I'm not that impressed.

This was great. I made it into more of a meal by adding some thinly sliced ham and chopped green onion that I sauteed with the asparagus. I also sprinkled the top with shredded cheese half way through the baking and will probably add on top of the vegetables before pouring on the egg custard next time. I also added an extra egg because I had one to use. I do think it needs more spice and I will alter those next time. Good recipe for using up this and that in the fridge.

I always read the recipe carefully, watch video if available and read the reviews.  So, I knew what to expect.  Very asparagus in flavor of course but I usually roast the lightly in olive oil with S&P.  Tiny bit of time and lemon was not really enough.  So I went to my favorite flavor palette.  Instead of time I added a little garlic and a little thinly sliced onion.  Added the lemon zest, cut back

This was absolutely delicious but I found that the cooking time was WAY too long, I just happened to check it at 20 minutes and it was already done. I feel that cooking it longer would’ve made it dry. I also added a little shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and it really brought out the flavors. The lemon zest really made a difference too, it made the flavors pop! Definitely making again!

Really liked this. I may add a little extra flavor next time suck as bacon pieces and minced garlic maybe? Really great side dish when you’re looking for something different.

Creamy custard quiche-like without the crust.  Used just asparagus tops.  Superb!

I absolutely loved it but I made a mistake by trying to cook it in a cast iron pan so asparagus cooked too long but cook and learn right? Will definitely make it again!!

The only thing I added was fresh shredded Parmesan.  Once again, Chef John has knocked it our of the park! This was my first attempt at a dish like this and I was skeptical about the consistency of the end product but it was perfect. And the best part of this whole recipe is that it’s basically foolproof. I will definitely be making this repeatedly.

This is so delicious!. The lemon zest makes all the difference. I only made two-thirds of it in a smaller dish. (Thirty-five minutes.) Topped it with grated Swiss cheese for the last fifteen. Forgot the mushrooms so sauteed with garlic salt and threw them on top when serving. Of course hot sauce had to be added then too.

This pie. Was delicious!  I added an onion because I didn't  have any shallots but , it was still delicious!  I will make it again in a few weeks.   I don't  see any reason to change the recipe but if I  don't have any shallots I will just use another onion!

Super Simple.
 I did alter it some. Trade to make it a little more savory
Added Rosemary and Thyme along with a Hard Cheese not must so the crust was similar to Focaccia. 
Taste Great .. Looks Fancy and is super simple

I ONLY gave it 5 stars because I altered it! The first time I made it just as instructed and it was aweful! The second time I dropped the thyme and added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. It was SUPERB!!!! Even my kids loved it!!!! So now I HIGHLY recommend it as a nice side dish or vegetarian main dish!

Brought this to our Easter gathering and it was a big hit!  I did sprinkle some Parmesan over the top & might add a bit of cayenne & sautéed mushrooms next time.  It is very good and most people enjoyed it but it is a little bland for my taste.

Stayed true to the recipe and it was wonderful! I have a house of picky eaters, and this was gone in minutes! I paired this with roasted turkey with gravy, and steamed carrots which complimented nicely.  I'm going to try this with pan fried prosciutto, and sauteed shallots next time to make it more of a main dish for lunch. Will definitely make this again!

Cut asparagus into 1/2" pcs so it slices better.  Used half & half. and added freshly sliced mushrooms.  I omitted the sweetener, since it is a savory dish.   Good dish for side, breakfast or main.

I made it but added a few seasonings like garlic and onion powder and basil. added in sauteed mushrooms as well and topped with parmesan and mozzarella cheese to make it a more main dish. excellent hot and fresh. not so much reheated, but not bad.

I love anything with the combination of eggs and asparagus. This combo was good too but  something was a bit overpowering in it. I've  never used  thyme or lemon zest--not sure if it was one or both of them. Regardless, it was still very enjoyable!  Next time  I will take reviewers advice and skip the thyme, add mushrroms  and possibly feta and onions. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Followed the recipe except for the addition of Romano cheese. I thought it was just okay. My boyfriend took one bite and spit it out. Sorry 
On the up side , my dogs seemed to like it. They ate it up.

EASY GOOD   We loved this. I made exactly. I made with roasted  cherry tomatoes and pork . A little quiche -ish.
This would also be good as breakfast with tomatoes and 
BBQ sausage.

I would add some onions the next time but it turned out really good.

This was very easy to make.  I thought it had plenty of flavor.  I even used organic, non-gmo soy milk rather than milk.  I will make this often.

I really liked this pie. Which in reality is more like a soufflé. Super easy to make, and quite tasty. Could be a side dish or a entree with a salad on the side. Actually I had this for breakfast. Definitely recommend.

this was tasty and easy to make but I was surprised at how much it deflated when I took it out of the oven! Just didn't think it was visually appealing but the flavor was good enough!

This had great flavor, the lemon zest is a nice touch, otherwise might be bland. I added cooked turkey breast and during the last fifteen minutes of cooking added sharp cheddar cheese.

I'm sorry but the texture was a little mushy and reminded me of something I ate in childhood because it smelled like milk and eggs. I love Chef John's recipes but not this one.

I saw this recipe in the first edition of the All Recipes Magazine.  It really caught my eye, so I tried it tonight...and...well...meh...it was just okay.    Moving on.
