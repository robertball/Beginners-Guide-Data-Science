Really enjoyed this for lunch today along with some cheese, crackers, and fresh fruit.  I don't think I would make it with anything BUT fresh corn; that crunchiness really is part of what I think makes this salad taste so good.  The lime-basil dressing is the perfect complement to these veggies, and that occasional pop of jalapeño wakes you up.  Very nice salad cookbookangie.

It is waiting in the fridge for supper tomorrow... but without the 'party-ing' time, the hubs rates it thumbs up!   I used fresh corn on the cob, cut off from leftovers tonight (3 ears worth)and Sweet 100 tomatoes which are a little larger than cherry tomatoes.... can't wait!  -- PS, it was a delicious hit!  Keep well for a couple of days, I recommend trying it if you are considering it!

Very nice and fresh!  The only change is I used a small, finely chopped Thai bird chili instead of jalapeno, as I live in Thailand and they are everywhere for free.  :)

Really good. We had this on a day that was 37 outside. Very refreshing. Will make it again FOR SURE! Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow. I did not have time to refrigerate before eating. Would have been even better colder (my fault).

Made this tonight and was delighted.  I used fresh corn and added a little more of the dressing, very light and refreshing.

Dressing is super easy, and the vegetables are quick to assemble .  Makes a perfect summer side dish with all those fresh-from-the-garden ingredients.  And it's very pretty, too, with all the reds and yellows and greens.   Delicious.

I made this last night even though I was skeptical because it seemed so simple.  I have lots of the ingredients from our garden and so I gave it a try.  It was amazingly delicious, so much so that it was devoured by a family that doesn't even like cucumber.  We will have this as a side with any Mexican entry.  Very delicious!

This is deelish!  I used tomatoes, cukes, and basil from my garden, and fresh corn cut off the cob.  I didn't change anything except I didn't have a jalapeno, which I think would have been great, but this was great without it.  Everyone that tried it loved it and I'll definitely make this again.

Our garden yielded an abundance of cherry tomatoes, and I was looking for a tasty way to incorporate them in a potluck meal. This was it! This recipe is so fresh and delicious, and I got many compliments. I followed the recipe but with more cherry tomatoes, and I also served it with a thing of feta cheese so people could add that. I must say that the feta made it perfect! Next time, I think I will try adding black beans as well. Thanks for sharing—delicious way to use up my cherry tomatoes.

My family raved about it!!! I made it ahead of time to marinate a bit. Only addition was 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic. Very light, fresh salad. Perfect for the summer!

Needed a good recipe to use up some garden veggies. Didn't have shallots or jalapeno, but I DID add a banana pepper. DELISH!!! Wasn't sure I was going to like this, but I'm so glad I tried it. Amazing!

I will definitely make this again! The only change I made was to the jalapeños.  I can't take quite that much heat . . . so I substituted 3 TB canned fire-roasted Hatch's green chilis.  Loved it!  I even think my healthy-wary hubby will like it too.

I should have rated this a long time ago. It has become one of my go-to recipes for picnics and potlucks. The flavors are fresh and just a little surprising. My husband has eaten a batch all by himself. I don't usually add the jalapeños, but that's just my family not liking too much heat.

Good and refreshing.  I was going to give it three stars but added one because it was quick to assemble.  A similar recipe is Heather's Cilantro, Black Bean and Corn Salsa, which I like better because it has more of a zing and it can be eaten plain, like a salad!
