I use sour cream in lieu of the milk, add shredded cheddar to the potato mixture along with onion, green pepper, real bacon bits and I season with garlic powder and a little black pepper. Fattening, but soooo yummy!

I made these for Easter, but modified the ingredients.  After scooping  out the potato pulp, I added sour cream and fresh chives.  Then I topped them with parmesan cheese.  I let them cool, covered them, and refrigerated them overnight.  After I pulled the ham out of the oven, I popped these in and everything was ready at the same time.  A great make-ahead dish that results in a rather elegant and crowd-pleasing holiday dish.

substitute heavy cream for the liquid, mix in about a cup of the shredded cheese with the potatoe mixture and add a little celery salt in the mix too! also when you scoop out the potatoe, put a dish towel in your hand and you can hold the potatoe better, saving it from breaking.

My kids and husband loved this recipe.  I made a couple of minor changes to the original recipe.  I decreased milk by 1/2 cup and added 1/4 sour cream and mixed shredded cheese into the mashed potato mixture as well as some bacon bits.  Filled each potato skin with the mixture and topped it off with some more shredded cheese on top of each potato.  My kids are very picky eaters and they both asked if we could have these again!

Update: I have started making a huge batch of these and freezing them in plastic ziplocks. Whenever my 3yo wants a 'baked potato', I take one out and microwave it for 2-3 minutes. Original review: Very classic, kid-friendly! I added more butter than called for, and also sour cream. I also halved the recipe (there are only 4 of us). Great way to stretch a potato! Thanks for the yummy post!

EXCELLENT!  This is just like what you get at a fancy restaurant.  It was so easy to make.  I did, however, skip the cheese and add fresh chives.   I prepared these potatoes ahead of time and popped them in the oven for the second bake, 15 minutes before we were ready to eat.  Thank you Sally Oh for such an EXCELLENT recipe!

These are good. A lot better than a plan old baked potato. I didn't think they were dry at all like others mentioned. A little heavy on the cheese for me. I baked them in the microwave and then in the oven for the last 15 minutes. Garnished them with paprika.

Quite good, and needs only minor adjustments to taste, to make it perfect!

I used nutritional yeast instead of cheese, and rice milk rather than dairy.  Also, I used turnips instead of potatoes, which cuts down on the carbs and infuses a unique touch.  It's easy to adjust servings to suit a crowed, which allows me to serve this whenever we host holiday functions.

1/4 c milk wasn't nearly enough -- I had to double it.  I thought the recipe turned out very bland -- I'll use it again, but next time I'll add pepper and perhaps paprika and garlic powder.  Also, trying to put all that cheese on top didn't really work -- the grated cheese just all fell off.  Maybe mixing most of the cheese into the stuffing would work better?

I was somewhat disappointed.  Most of the twice-baked potatoes I've had were better.  As is, the recipe turned out too dry.  I did use 2% cheddar cheese and that may have made a bit of a difference.  Next time, I will modify this recipe a lot - looking for a way to make the mashed potato portion tastier and less dry.  I prefer to avoid the extra calories and fat of cream cheese, but as others have suggested, I may try that.  I may also add sour cream and/or cream instead of milk.  Mixing bacon bits and cheddar cheese with the potato pulp may spice the taste up and add to the moisture content too.  I will also be looking to add spices to the pulp too, as others have suggested.  As is, this is a very average or below average recipe - but with modifications, it might be terrific.

I was somewhat disappointed.  Most of the twice-baked potatoes I've had were better.  As is, the recipe turned out too dry.  I did use 2% cheddar cheese and that may have made a bit of a difference.  Next time, I will modify this recipe a lot - looking for a way to make the mashed potato portion tastier and less dry.  I prefer to avoid the extra calories and fat of cream cheese, but as others have suggested, I may try that.  I may also add sour cream and/or cream instead of milk.  Mixing bacon bits and cheddar cheese with the potato pulp may spice the taste up and add to the moisture content too.  I will also be looking to add spices to the pulp too, as others have suggested.  As is, this is a very average or below average recipe - but with modifications, it might be terrific.

These were good and simple.  I started them off in the microwave and did the second bake in the oven. (too hot to run oven all that time).  I'll doctor them up more next time.

These were great!  I used sour cream instead of milk also.  I microwaved the potatoes to save on time, so they were a little dry.  I'll add a little milk next time in addition to the sour cream.  Really yummy, my very picky toddlers liked them, too!

I loved the recipe.  Being a working mom with three kids, I needed it to be quicker so I cook my potatoes in the microwave.  I do put them in the oven for a few minutes after I've completed the recipe.  It saves so much time!

Totally had the wrong sized potatoes.  Half the size of what is called for.  Made some minor adjustments but they came out really good.  Oiled and salted the skins.   Omitted the sour cream and just milk and butter.   Dashes is really S&P with a bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt.   Hubby absolutely loved it.  I want bacon next time for mine.  May wrap the taters in bacon for the first bake.  Hmmmm

These were yummy, although I forgot to add milk. I did add some ranch dressing mix, which would have been great if I had added the milk! LOL!  I did have trouble scooping out the potato without tearing the skins to pieces. Still tasted pretty good. I'll have to try this recipe again and see if I can get it right.

These were pretty good. I made too many and we ended up having them with dinner twice. They lasted well overnight and heated up in the microwave fine. A little dry, but baked potatoes always tend to be.

These were pretty good. I made too many and we ended up having them with dinner twice. They lasted well overnight and heated up in the microwave fine. A little dry, but baked potatoes always tend to be.

I have always wanted a twice baked potatoe that had things in it that I like...this is it. I did make mine with a small amount of heavy cream  and used chedder and mozerella cheese for the top. Whole family loved it. Hardest part of whole thing is getting the potato out of the shell without breaking the shell!

They were great, everyone loved them, even my son and he won't eat anything.  They were time consuming.

My daughter loved helping make these and loved eating them. They do take some time but are well worth it. We have added bacon bits and tried them once with sour cream, butter, and chives.
