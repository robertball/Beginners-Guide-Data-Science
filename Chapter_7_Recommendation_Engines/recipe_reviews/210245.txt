Way too watery.  Next time I will try only 1 cup of chicken broth.  Taste was good enough to try again.

I was looking for an easy peanut African dish and this was perfect.  The only change I made was I used chicken instead of pork (since I didn't have pork but I did have chicken).  I added this recipe to my favorites list since I will definitely be making it again.

Excellent!  I only had 1/2 cup of green pepper to use, and had trouble browning the tenderloin in the saucepan with all the vegetables in it, but it came out fabulous!  I did strain out the pork and vegetables from the sauce after 15 minutes of simmering, and continued to simmer the sauce by itself for about another 15 minutes to thicken it up...a good decision.  Served it over linguine noodles and it was excellent.  Well done!

Delicious! My hubby is on a health food kick but said that this dish was definitely worth the high calories. I have never cooked meat with peanut butter before but had tasted it years before in Holland. We just loved the taste. I did not have chunky peanut butter so just added some chopped peanuts to the mix. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this recipe and my husband loved it.  It was very filling.  I don't like whole nuts in my food, so I used creamy peanut butter.  I also didn't have teh cummin, but I still think it had depth and was delicious.  There was plenty left over, but we were happy.  It was wonderful a few days later for lunch :)

My hubby & I both loved this! I didn't use as much chicken broth, and I added some Thai red curry paste to make it spicier--it was delish! Will make this again...
