First off - the cook time on this is WAY off - try  15 minutes at 350 degrees or 10 minutes max at 425.  I used mayonnaise and a squirt of lemon with a bit of garlic salt, instead of Miracle Whip.  For the bread crumbs, I used Panko crumbs.  The crumb base didn't crisp up like I had hoped because of the cooking temperature of 350.   The flavor was pretty good and this could easily be a stellar recipe with a few changes.   I served this with broccoli and couscous.
