This was great,  light, fluffy.  I used GF 1:1 baking flour by Bob's Red Mill. as the GF flour.  It has xanthan  gum already in it.

For the record, I hate cornbread. My review is strictly based on appearance and my husband's feedback. For whatever reason I honestly expected this to turn out dense as dense can be. Wrong! This was fluffier than any boxed cornbread I have ever made. It looked gorgeous! Hubs gave a big thumbs up but in the end said it was a tad too sweet for his liking. Take that for what it is worth. I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup next time but that is the only change I will make.

I am gluten and dairy free and I substituted the milk with almond milk and had meant to sub coconut oil with the butter but forgot it all together. I also didn't have xanthan gum so I simmered 2 parts water with 1 part flaxseed meal for 5 minutes until it turned into slime. Whip 1 tsp of this slime into the milk and then you're on your way with the rest of the ingredients! My girls fought over this cornbread even though they don't eat dairy/gluten free!

Very good recipe! Be sure to check if your gluten free flour already has xanthum gum added to it. I used honey as the sweetener. Same amount as the sugar and added an additional 1 Tbslp. Gluten free flour. The corn bread was perfect and everyone enjoyed it!!!

My first attempt was a fifty fifty win/fail. It tasted great but looked rough and was pretty dense. (I didn’t exactly follow the recipe). My second attempt is perfect! Looks beautiful! Tastes wonderful! Crumbles like regular cornbread and I couldn’t tell any difference in the texture of regular cornbread. My latest favorite recipe! I used Pillsbury GF all purpose flour blend which already contains xanthan gum.

It turned out great but all I taste is the xanthum gum. Is there anything you can to it make it taste a lil sweeter and not taste that

Amazing!  I am new to the GF world and this recipe made my day. I made some cinnamon and honey butter to accompany it and it made this bread a 6 star. My family made a quick job of this cornbread. Couldn't tell it was GF --just as the title says. My flour already had xanthan gum in it as well.

It is really good for sure, but for us, it needs to be a little sweeter and it breaks apart a little too easily.  I used coconut milk instead of dairy milk since we're also dairy free and it was good!  I'll keep tweaking to see if I can get it to stay together a little better, but in the meantime, its a really good gluten free cornbread!

this recipe came out fairly dense... not too sweet... but man, it was UGLY.  I thought it would level itself out some... but the pan was really more to keep it from falling through the rack... this stuff looked like it fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down....  it did, however, taste okay.  if I ever make this recipe again, i'll just throw it on a baking sheet and have a "loaf" of cornbread.

I've made a lot of cornbread and gluten-free cornbread, and sometimes even my wheat-eating family can't tell the difference between the two, when it's a good recipe for GF.  That being said, I'm not sure why this came out so rubbery and dense, but it did.  Not the texture result I've had with other recipes.  But if you want a cornbread that is less sweet, this may suit you.

I made this recipe using GF corn meal, corn flour, and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and in place of butter, I used sunflower oil.  It came out nice.  I think I would prefer to use this on top of my chili, and bake it.  It is a little dense, but again, this is a good recipe.  Thanks!

Simple, easy ingredients, which is harder to find when baking gluten-free. I will make it again!
