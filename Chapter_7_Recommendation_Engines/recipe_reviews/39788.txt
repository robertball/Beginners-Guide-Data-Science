Sauce took a really long time to thicken, it wasn't until the next day's leftovers that the flavours really came together and stood out.  It was great then, though!

I found this recipe to be quite tasty!  The sauce really surprised me: the spices and wine create a mulled-wine tasting base, which the mango and honey sweeten and the pepper kicks up with some spice.  The mixture of flavors (along with the cilantro) make each bit a little bit different, in a good way.  I would recommend going a little lighter on the cilantro and skip the olives, but that's just my taste.  I also made it with chicken (stir fried w/ a few pieces of mango and honey, added the chicken to the sauce just before serving) and found that to make a nice addition.

This pasta recipe is wonderful.  The flavor from the mango mixed with the pepper is so unique and delicious. I use a regular red pepper as opposed to a chile pepper to give it a little less spice, but it tastes excellent either way. I highly recommend this dish for any occasion.

It was kinda yucky.  We ate it, though.  Just had no interest in pulling the leftovers out.  I didn't like the taste of tomato and mango together.

Yum!! That was a unique and really tasty dish. I would use diced tomatoes next time instead of whole ones, and maybe only half a pepper (it made my hubby cry!). I also left off the cilantro and olives, because I'm not a fan of either one. Overall, a great and really simple, delicious dinner.

I used a chipolte pepper, marsala wine, and kalamata olives for this and LOVED the smokey, sweet, salty result.
