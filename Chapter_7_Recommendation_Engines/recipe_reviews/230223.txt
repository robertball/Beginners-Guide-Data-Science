This is a family favorite, made each Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The original recipe was handed down by my great grandmother.

This was a huge hit! I was nervous because I'd never eaten figgy pudding, let alone made it, but it turned out great. I didn't make any sauce to go with it, but drizzled cream over it instead. (Maybe that's weird? I don't know. We liked it.) My husband and two young kids both loved it, including the one who won't eat figs. The only part I wasn't sure about was the orange peel strips. It seemed strange to leave them in there. But again, I'd never had it before, so I don't know.
