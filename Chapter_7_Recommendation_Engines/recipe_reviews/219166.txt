I made this for the boys before I went to work last night. I did not try this myself but based on the message I got at my break--they absolutely loved it. To be honest, there were no leftovers for me! They thought the crust was the best part. Note to self: double the crust ingredients next time.

Oh boy!  I finally found the  best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only 12 oz. of macaroni, to make it more cheesy.  It was a perfect ratio.  I used 2% milk, and it worked great - creamy and satisfying. I  don't know which I liked better, the crust or the filling, they were both delicious.  You have to try this recipe!  Thanks, Chef John!

Lordy, all anyone wanted was the crust.  New rule, take what's UNDER the crust, too.  This was the closest to my mom's, and all kidding aside, a terrific success.

My family really loved this dish.  The only changes I made was 1/8 cayenne (because of kid), made only 12 oz. of macaroni and used black pepper.  I didn't have panko crumbs so I made my own crumbs with leftover bread.  To be honest, I can live without the topping so I'll leave it out next time.  This will be my go-to mac and cheese recipe for now!  UPDATE:  This time I left out the thyme and worcestershire.  I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder to the roux. I used 10 oz. of macaroni.  I didn't add the breadcrumb topping.  I covered the dish with foil and baked it at 375° for 30 minutes, then uncovered and baked for 15 minutes more.  Nice and creamy and so delicious.  But I'll have to leave out the cayenne next time due to picky kid (although I love the kick of the cayenne).  How anyone can say this macaroni and cheese is bland is beyond me.  Perhaps you used cheap cheese which tends to be oily and doesn't have the best flavor and texture.  And BTW, if your dish turns out grainy, you probably didn't take the bechemel off the burner and SLOWLY (1/4 cup at a time) add cheese to it while mixing gently.  Dumping all the cheese at once to simmering bechemel that is still on the burner will result in a grainy texture.

Very good.  I am thinking that the people who commented that they were overpowered by the taste of thyme must have used ground thyme instead of dried thyme leaves.  1/4 tsp. of dried thyme leaves is not enough to overpower anything.

The best mac and cheese I have made in a long time. My family all stated the same. I followed the recipe with the exception of a couple of changes. After reading the reviews, I cut the pasta by a couple of oz and that worked out perfectly. I used fresh thyme, backed the ceyenne down to 1/8 teaspoon (my dad can't have spicey), and was out of dijon so I used about a 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard. We loved that it was baked but still creamy! Definitely reminds everyone of grandma's mac and cheese. I will use this recipe from this point. Thanks for sharing!

Tweaker alert. I used the basic recipe but changed the seasonings due to my "NON-Gourmet" children who will never eat Thyme flavored anything. The sauce recipe works fantastic & I was quite proud of myself for pulling this off. You should not leave the stove during the sauce whisking portion. The reviews talked a lot about sauce vs. pasta amounts. My men like sauce. I used a 16 oz large elbow macaroni package. I "sort of" doubled the sauce. It was perfect. I am writing this up because I use other people's suggestions all the time. Hope this helps someone! I used: 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1 T. Chili Powder (think chili), 1/4 + teaspoon of Red Chili Flakes, 5 cups of 2% milk, 1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce, 3 tsp. Kosher Salt, 5 good handfuls of already grated Cheddar/Jack Mix (Costco), 1 good squirt of Dijon. Followed the sequence of directions, but changed the seasoning & amounts. For the crust - I discovered I DID NOT have the Panko Break Crumbs I thought I had. I used 2 T. Butter with 1/2 cup Italian Bread Crumbs + 1/4 c. Crunchy Onions (think green bean casserole), mixed well, sprinkled on top & baked in a 10 X 15 - greased. Wonderful - my men ate 1/2 of the tray last night & I am sure the rest will be gone today! Thanks Chef John for the basic recipe!

Update: I still do what I wrote in my original "tweak" of this recipe, but if this is for an adult buffet, I have added jarred Jalapeno slices at the very last stage of putting it in the pan. It gets rave reviews!

EXCELLENT!  EXCELLENT! I don't review much recipes, and this is one worth to review!  Please read! :)  

I wanted to use the 16 oz. of elbow macaroni, but also wanted it cheesy as well.  So I "almost" doubled the wet ingredients (for the sauce).  I found this to be a PERFECT RATIO for the 16 oz. macaroni.  I used 3/4 cup butter, about 3/4 cup flour , 5 cups cheese total (I use half sharp cheddar grated myself and half regular cheddar) (reserving 1.5 cups of cheese for the top) and 5 cups of milk.  I adjust the seasonings as accordingly as well!  

**I never add the nutmeg.  I'm a bit scared putting nutmeg in this dish, even if it's just a pinch! LOL  

**Instead of the dijon mustard I use the mustard powder, and only use half the amount it states (only because I don't know how much of a mustard flavor it will pick up)

**I up the panko bread crumbs to 1 cup, and the melted butter to 2 TBs.  The crust from that is amazing.  

**I'm not a big fan of too much thyme, so I used italian seasonings instead.  

**  The cayenne pepper is great in this, but I usually half it if kids are eating it in case they're fussy.  I have also sprinkled on crushed red pepper flakes instead.  

**I do not use ALL sharp cheddar cheese.  I use half sharp (freshly grated myself), and half regular cheddar!!! 

**DO add the worsherchire sauce!

This is soooooo good!  I will never want to try another type of mac n' cheese recipe ever.  Thank you for reading! :)
** I included a photo and it's photo #2.

Tried this recipe because I was starting to think my tried and true mac&cheese was a little bland.  I was skeptical of the thyme so only filled the 1/4 tsp about 2/3 full.  Followed everything else to a T.  The thyme flavor was so overpowering, the dish was inedible.

I have tried this recipe and it was good. For those who thought it was a little dry, I have found over the years that mixing hot pasta with hot sauce only ends up with a very dry pasta after baking in the oven. So to fix this I always cool my pasta on the counter before I add it to any sauce.  It stops the pasta from absorbing too much of the sauce and ending up dry. You can always make additional sauce, but that means extra calories. So I just cool the pasta while I am making the cheese sauce. I made a very small dish with the thyme but did not put it in the main recipe. Glad I did, the addition of thyme was terrible in my opinion.

Delicious! Very easy and kid-friendly. Use a little less pasta if you like your mac and cheese very saucy -- this wasn't overly saucy, but had great flavor. It's easy to make changes according to your likes.

I've tried a few mac and cheese recipes on this site and this is by far my favorite.  It was easy to make.  I read the reviews first, and learned that if I want a creamier mac and cheese to reduce the noodles, so I used 12oz instead of 16oz, which I think worked out perfectly.  That's the only change I made.  It had a nice combo of flavors, none being overpowering.  I was slightly nervous that the cayenne pepper would be a little too spicy for my mom who hates anything spicy, but I didn't tell her that any pepper was in there and she didn't complain. :)

My family and I loved this! However, I tasted while cooking and intensified the seasonings, probably close to doubling the thyme, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Also, for those who might not have the suggested cheese on-hand (like me), I used half gruyere and half colby jack and it worked out fine. I didn't like it when cooks rated a recipe high and then changed it, but it seems everyone does it and the "here's what I dids" are helpful.

I love this dish. I love this dish so much that when I make it, I force myself to cut the recipe down so that I don't end up eating a pound of mac & cheese in two days. The first time I made it, I followed the measurements exact and while amazing, I thought it could be improved. The second time, I doubled the spices and added some parsley, basil, and oregano  and IT ROCKED! Like other reviewers suggest, I double the breadcrumbs for the topping. If I ever meet Chef John, I'm going to do a back flip just to show my appreciation for this recipe.

The texture of the crust was amazing and the mac and cheese was creamy just how I like it. I think using only sharp cheddar made it a little too sharp for me. Next time I might substitute a cup or so of mild cheddar. But will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've been looking for a good mac and cheese recipe for a long time, and watched the accompanying video. I followed his advice and used 1 cup smoked gouda cheese to replace 1 cup of the shredded cheddar. I also added 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. Wow! It is wonderful! My family ate it up. I have a new favorite! I also only used 12 oz. of macaroni, to make the finished product a little looser. Watch the video!! It has some great tips in it.

Run, don't walk, to your local grocery and find the "cheese remnants" bin, purchase several that sound interesting....gruyere is a good one with white cheddar. Then go home and go to foodwishes.com and watch the tutorial by Chef John on this recipe.  He makes it so easy!  This is an excellent recipe-our whole family of 5 loves it!

This was very good and the topping really added a punch to it. However, next time, I think I will omit the thyme. Even though it was only 1/4 tsp, I could still taste it and I don't think this dish needed it. I prefer thyme in my poultry dishes, not my mac-n-cheese.

YUM!!! I made this 3x in 2 days. The first time I left the thyme out on purpose, due to other reviews.  But then I accidentally left the nutmeg out. It was still fantastic!  The next day I made it for my boyfriend and his two teenage sons. They like spicy so I increased the cayenne pepper, but then accidentally left out the Dijon. It was still awesome!  But I wanted them to have it with the Dijon so I made it again. I just got the confirmation - they love it!!  This recipe is very forgiving.  I've tried many others and nobody liked any of them. Until now. This is the best!  (I will add that I made it two days ago but didn't bake it. They put it in fridge and then baked it tonight.  So it does do well with premaking).

This was really great, I doubled the recipe since it said it only served 6. I brought this to a wing-night party and everybody loved it. The nutmeg gives it an interesting flavor from left field that's really quite satisfying. I also doubled the topping and used about 125% of the cheese required. Excellent! BTW - doubling the recipe (2x boxes of elbows) yielded 2 very full 9x11's.

I am sorry but this was not good at all.  Followed the recipe exactly, it came out too dry and too bland.  Will not try this Mac and Cheese again.

This was disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, but it was really spicy hot and the dried thyme didn't seem to go with the cheese or the spicy hot.  There should be a WARNING.  I'm new to cooking and I thought the ingredients would all blend and add a subtle flavor.  Live and learn.  I will fear thyme and cayanne pepper from now on. Going back to the simple Velveeta recipe.

4.5 stars.  I did everything to the tee except I used pipettes instead of elbow macaroni.  I found the flavor all there and there was a nice kick, but I wish it were a little creamier.  I'm going to redo this recipe with  less pasta next time.

This is the best mac n cheese recipe I've found so far --it actually has minutes listed on cooking the roux; I'm surprised recipes don't typically have that.  I mean, mac n cheese *only* depends on 2 things-- good roux and excellent cheese.  

I used freshly grated, New York extra sharp cheddar and it was superb.

Thanks, Chef John!!

We didn't like the taste of this very much.  I used the whole lb. of macaroni and mild cheddar but stuck to recipe...don't know what is was specifically but won't make again.  The crust was tasty but didn't like the filling.

I made this as a covered dish I took to visit friends from out-of-town who were visiting a campground near my home. I had ingredients to make my "own" version but wanted to make something a little more impressive, and this sure did the trick! I don't like spicy stuff so I eliminated the cayenne pepper and had to make my own breadcrumbs (baked 3 big slices of italian bread in the oven then crumbled them up in a Ziploc baggie) for the crumbly top. The thyme and pinch of nutmeg as well as the Dijon mustard was so subtle but really made the dish a gourmet version of what I usually make. Also used small shells since I was out of elbow mac and didn't have time to go to the store; still came out GREAT! Thanks, John. This is my new go-to Mac-n-Cheese recipe from now on. Bravo!

Wow! Absolutely wonderful.  Very time intensive for a mac and cheese recipe but the results were great.  MUCH better straight out of the oven than the next day though (although that is true with all mac and cheese I think).  I could have skipped the bread crumbs and still liked it.

Didn’t have any bread crumbs on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Texture was grainy and there was hardly any cheese flavor.  The thyme and mustered were so over powering we just dumped it out.  I will not be making this one again.

Made this for a barbecue and got rave reviews on it.  It was relatively easy for a more intense mac and cheese.  Used fresh thyme from my garden.  (Update: I made this a second time with fat free milk.  Tasted just as delicious.)

In the video, he put the panko on top of the cheese at the end, in the written version, it says to put remaining cheese on top of panko, I'm going with video version.

I dare say this is on par, if not better, than my mother's recipe that I have been using for decades. My husband tried to say mine was just as good, but I think he's being polite. Definitely worth making. (Oh, I cooked less macaroni as others have noted).

Great recipe. Its important to watch.the video in addition to reading the recipe since the chef gives you modification options.  For example I made 50% more sauce and follows the video where we layer the panko after the cheese at the end and not as per the written recipe. Also I didn't have thyme so I used sage and I doubled the panko as I wanted it extra crunchy. It was a big hit with my 5 year old!

I think this serves as a good base recipe, but I made several adjustments. Firstly I only used 12 oz of pasta. I omitted the cayenne, white pepper and nutmeg. The seasonings I used were a pinch of thyme, 1 T of chili powder, 1 T of garlic powder, dash of oregeno, 1 1/2 t of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and 1 t of red pepper flakes. I also used 4 c of milk, 1/2 c butter, and 4 c of cheese. With the breadcrumbs at the end, I used 1 c of breadcrumbs and 3 T of butter. I also added 2 pieces of crumbled bacon to the mix at the end before baking. The finished product came out well, but I think if I had not added the extra milk, cheese, and butter it would have been very dry. I may even add a little more next time. Hope this helps!

Haven't made this yet, but thought I'd share the video link which Allrecipes was highlighting one day and that's how I found the recipe. I'm an experienced cook but did learn a few tidbits from watching.   http://allrecipes.com/video/314/tjs-mac-cheese/detail.aspx  Am rating 5 stars as I can tell I'll love it as it's similar to mine, but with the added crust.

Amazing! This is my first swing at Mac and cheese and I think I started in the right place. It was soooo yummy. Only thing I would change is a bit more cheese in the sauce instead if on top, and not as much bread crumb topping.

I made this as written, even going out and buying whole nutmeg. This turned out creamy and quite tasty, everyone liked it. Used just the sharp cheddar as Chef John suggested, but next time I might try out some different cheeses, just for fun. Thanks Chef for an another winner!

So tasty! I swapped out 2 cups of cooked pasta with 2 cooks of cooked cauliflower.  It turned out creamy, cheesy and less guilty. The crust is perfect!  Excellent recipe. Will make again for sure!

This was awful.  If it weren't for that single pinch of nutmeg, I wouldn't be able to taste it at all (and maybe it's because it's still in my kitchen, and I can simply smell it).  Even my pastaholic teenage daughter didn't like it. I only used 12oz of pasta because I wasn't paying attention at the size when I purchased it, and it was still dry. I had to peel the cheddar topping off because it was a solid, dried clump.  I don't cook bad meals, and this was an embarrassment.  At least I was able to say it wasn't my recipe.

We really enjoyed this. The little bit of heat from the pepper was a nice touch. I made a half recipe and followed the chef's advice to use less pasta (6 oz)since we wanted it a little creamier. I ended up with enough for 5 1C ramekins so as a side I'd say there'd be more like 10 servings as written. I used 1% milk and forgot to melt butter so I sprayed the panko with olive oil for the topping and that worked fine. fyi- with those changes I est. 1/2 the calories and 2/3 the fat listed per serving as a side. We baked them off on the grill over indirect heat while grilling steaks and broccoli.

This mac and cheese was so good and so creamy!!  A big hit - even my kids liked it and generally they don't eat my homemade mac - they prefer the powder and box variety!  I did do more sauce as others recommended - so good!!

I just made this Macaroni and Cheese and it was awesome....I had the kids and hubby rate it and I got the thumbs up. This will be my new Mac and Cheese recipe. I used 4 cups of macaroni and it was perfect for the amount of sauce. I did not have thyme but used a pinch of lemon pepper. YUMMY!

We are mac & cheese connoisseurs at our house, and this was very good but did not top our favorite.  My husband instantly noted that 'although good, the usual is better.'  I lessened the thyme because I'm not a huge fan of it without other herbs used together.  Also lessened the amount of pasta as we like a creamier mac & chz.  Either we mis-measured or the cayenne does give it a slight kick.  I think the crust would have been better had we skipped the cheese on top, which baked up to a crispy waffle-cut type layer; DH and I would have preferred just the crumb topping.

The BEST mac 'n cheese recipe out there - and I've tried many!  As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted sage for the thyme, doubled the breadcrumbs, and added a cup of shredded gruyere.  My husband and father-in-law both say this is the best mac 'n cheese they're ever had!

This is a great recipe. I like my mac and cheese with a lot of sauce, so I make about 1/2 cup more than the recipe calls for. I also don't add the breadcrumbs because I didn't grow up eating it that way. This is a great dish to make for potlucks and parties. I sometimes double it for a big crowd, and everyone raves about it. It's hard to go wrong with this one.

One of our favorite dishes... Try adding bacon crumble on top of the panko and shredded cheese... adds a great smokey taste. My sister is a chef and when I made her a dish, she claimed its the best mac and cheese she's ever had. Thanks Chef John

It was not very flavorful. I used mostly sharp cheddar and a little bit of mild cheddar, and also a little bit of Colby cheese. Also, I would suggest mixing the panko and the topping cheese, together. I put the suggested amount of cheese in it and almost all of it absorbed into the macaroni noodles. But, with a little bit of tweaking, this recipe, could be very good! Also, try seasoning the panko, this would help!

Very Good, Doubled as I was feeding a crowd, added 8 oz smoked gouda, and used Kraft three cheddar shred combo (vermont, sharp, and white).   Yummy

I just used a bit of Italian seasonings in place of thyme, no cayenne pepper b/c I didn't have any. Used a blend of cheeses. Used powdered mustard b/c I didn't have dijon. It was REALLY good.

Note to self: Don't need the bread crumbs next time.

My teenage son decided to make homemade macaroni and cheese, googled it and found this recipe.  I typically don't eat mac however, since my son made it, I had to give it a try.  It is absolutely delicious, I had a hard time walking away from it.  He followed the recipe to a t, it does not need any tweeking!!  Thanks for putting this online for all to enjoy!

I just made this for dinner.  It was delicious.  The only change I made was to use Italian flavour bread crumbs since that was all I had. My husband who has NEVER liked home made mac and cheese LOVED this.  Thanks Chef John for this wonderful recipe.

Honestly, I do not get the high ratings for this Mac and Cheese.  The only thing I changed was using about 12 oz macaroni noodles as other reviews suggested.  The bottom line is that this dish was dry, bland and tasteless.  I have tried some other recipes that are much creamier and tastier - definitely would not make this again.

This is so good!  I haven't made this in a very long time and it came out perfect.  I didn't have any thyme, but that's the only change I made.  Perfection!   My neighbor said it was the best she's ever had and that I should open a restaurant.

Chef John I give you 5 stars for this one.  The only ingredient I changed was to american cheese (more kid friendly)and I left out the salt because there was enough in the cheese.  My kids could not get enough of it and it reheats very good.   Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Updated review:  I have used this recipe for several years now and its the most requested by my kids and their friends.  So easy to make and just so darn good.

I will tell you this is the BEST mac and cheese i have ever had! my husband and kids are so picky with this kind of thing and they had a third helping. the only modification i made was decreasing the pasta by about 2 oz as someone suggested to have a creamier sauce-i will be making this one again for sure-i have allready given it to two people to try!

It wasn't terrible, but it was really bland. I followed the recipe exactly. I did like the consistency and texture, and the crust, but next time it will get some healthy hits of garlic and onion powder, black pepper and cayenne.  Since it may just be that my family likes very seasoned food, I am still giving this 5-stars, but if your family likes flavor, prepare to add a bunch!

Mac and Cheese is my ultimate fave comfort food, and this recipe hit the spot! The panko breadcrumbs are a secret I'm glad I learned. Thanks, Chef John! My only variance from the recipe was using a touch of ground mustard in place of Dijon, as I had none on hand. I added approx. 1/2 tsp. of the powdered mustard to the roux right before the addition of milk. 

This will be my go-to mac and cheese recipe from now on! The reviewer who found the thyme overpowering must have a hyper-sensitive palette, because I found the seasonings to be perfect.

This is about the best macaroni and cheese recipe I have ever tried! I, along with Chef John, prefer my macaroni and cheese a little less creamy, so this recipe was perfect! My family must have agreed because there was nothing left! I love the cayenne pepper..a little spice is always nice! It does have a kick, so if you don't like spicy, I recommend leaving it out. Otherwise, I will make this again and again exactly as is!

Yum! Only had ground thyme, not dried, so I used Italian seasoning instead. Also used dry mustard as I didn't have dijon- but otherwise followed the recipe to a T and it was fantastic! Would definitely make again.

Made this again tonight for dinner and it is as always spot on. Did not take anything away, but bumped up the cayenne because we love mac and cheese with Texas Pete anyways so it was a nice smoky yum flavor! chef John continues to make my family fat and happy with his awesome recipes!!

I was running out of lunch food and looking for a mac 'n cheese recipe with ingredients I had on hand.  This was excellent!  I didn't have any Panko bread crumbs or even saltines to put on top so didn't even make the topping.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so had to use a mixture of Colby and Swiss.  I didn't have white pepper so used black pepper instead.  It was still good!  I am excited to try it next time with all the correct ingredients and I think the topping will make it even better!

This was just okay to us. It seemed dry, and not very creamy or cheesy. Felt like I should have put a can of cheddar cheese condensed soup in it. We actually didn't even finish it, and several days later after no one ate any more of it, I threw it out. I was disappointed, as I expected it to be better since all of the other "Chef John" recipes we have tried have been awesome!! I only gave it two stars because I will not be making this again, but it was still edible.

I made this recipe as written.  First, let me say that the topping is so unbelievably good.  I suggest doubling it.  As written, this macaroni and cheese is a tad too spicy for my kids, so they wouldn't eat it.  My husband and I enjoyed it, though I also thought the spice could come down a bit.

I made the recipe exactly as described. It was ok, nothing special. Rather flat tasting. The cheese sauce did taste quite good on it's own but once it was mixed in with the macaroni and baked, the flavor got lost.

Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE fan of Chef John.  This being said, I'm disappointed with this recipe.  It tastes too strange; the kids won't touch it.  My suggestion - leave out the thyme, worcestershire sauce mustard, and cayenne... then maybe you'll have something that the whole family will enjoy.

I am a Mac and cheese lover and this had too much going on.  Thyme and cayenne was very overpowering.  The recipe was very easy to follow and the topping was fantastic!  Next time I will be leaving out the thyme for sure.

Very good recipe.  I made the version with less macaroni and increased the crumbles on top a bit.  We used American, Velveta and Cheddar cheeses in the sauce.  Instead of cheddar cheese on top with the crumbles, I used Parmesan cheese mixed in with the crumble mixture prior to applying it to the mac and cheese.  It was great!

this was my first go for making mac & cheese from scratch.. cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us.. had to use a blend of soy milk and coconut milk in place of the regular (lactose intolerant).. omitted the thyme all together (got scared off bc of the reviews).. forgot the mustard.. DOH! .. i used a mild cheddar and really feel that the sharp is necessary.. sprinkled a blend of parm/romano/asiago and jack cheese for the topping in addition to the crumb topping.. would really like to try this again with a sharper cheddar and maybe a smidgen of thyme and definitely add the mustard to be able to adequately rate this recipe.. either way it still came out tasty.. ty for the recipe

I'm on the hunt for a great recipe for mac and cheese and so far this is the best of all I've tried.  The family loved it.  I used less noodles (per the video suggestion) because I wanted it creamier and not so thick.  Will make again...thank you!

Hooray for no processed cheese! I used mild and medium cheddar, but I did wish I had sharp on hand. I left out the nutmeg, since I don't like it in anything, except a dash in pumpkin pie. I used vegetarian Worcestershire sauce, cut down the cayenne a tad, used a little black pepper and Italian bread crumbs instead of panko (omitted the butter in that, just sprayed the top with oil). Next time I will use a little less salt and make more sauce. It does soak in when you bake it. I also think it would benefit from some sauteed onion. Love the additions of white pepper and thyme. I used a heaping 1/4 tsp of thyme and it was perfect! Yum!

I need to tweak this before I can give it 5 stars.  It was a bit too spicy, and my cheese sauce separated a bit when I added the Dijon mustard.  Still, it was rich and creamy and very tasty, and pretty easy to put together.

Made this for my boyfriend on Saturday night. It was easy and wonderful. I only used about 1/3 of the box of macaroni because we like it creamy. I used sharp cheddar. It was great, thanks Chef John. I love his videos/recipes. Too good.

This is a great recipe! I used 12 oz of elbow noodles and it was a perfect consistency. Next time I will omit the thyme because it was a little over powering but other than that it was delicious!

Well, the sauce was so bad that I  started again... without the nutmeg, worcestershire sauce, mustard, or thyme. Minus all that and it was delicious. And I made my own bread crumbs by drying some bread in the oven and chopping it in a food processor. Oh, that was a bit too much salt too. I don't like my food bland... promise. I'm usually quite adventurous... but that spice blend tasted akin to dirt. I did like paprika in it too.

It was a little dry for me (I like lots of cheese) and I had to bump up the seasonings.  I really like how the sauce was made, so I will keep this in my rotation.

I enjoyed the cheese sauce, but found that I needed a little more sauce or less pasta. I may reduce the amount of pasta per the video next time.

This was quite yummy, and easy to make! But.... the bread crumbs didn't brown on the top, and I did use the Panko and baked at the correct amount of time. But, hey, maybe that's just me! The spices were also a bit much for me, it gave more of a spicy aftertaste, which I didn't enjoy. I suggest you use less spices, maybe even cut one out (Cayenne) if you don't like spicy like me.

This is a really tasty recipe, coming from someone who really hates boxed mac 'n cheese. Next time I will use less pasta though, cuase with a whole 16 oz box there is not much cheese to the mac. Chef John's video showing how to make it does explain this up front, if you want a creamier, cheesier (and fattier) outcome then just use less pasta (by as much as half). I think I'll try 12oz next time. Also, definitely use the panko bread crumbs rather than just any kind, there is a big difference.

I followed this recipe exactly, but I didn't care much for it. Nothing really stood out, and the mustard gave it a funky taste.

Creaminess was nice, but was somehow still weird in  texture.  It tasted more like unflavored, boxed mac & cheese!  I omitted the topping and did some ritz crackers.  I also omitted the thyme & Cayenne, but I'm pretty sure those 2 spices wouldn't have saved the dinner!

Another awesome dish by Chef John! I left out the cayenne per my family's tastes, and didn't quite have enough real cheese, so added some cheese food, ie Velveeta (I know, the horror of it all), and it turned out wonderful! The panko bread crumbs are SO good - definitely worth looking for them. Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought the thyme tasted good - there's not much in there, but it adds a light extra layer of flavor.

It was the first time I had homemade mac n cheese, and I was really good. I made 2 batches, one with a lot of sauce and one with a lot of pasta. I was a fan of the creamier one. Also, I put Bacon in it and it added a little more flavor. Ill make again

I made mine with brown rice elbow pasta and half sharp cheddar/half gruyere cheese. I also saved more of my cheese for the top to have a thicker crust. This is a darn good, SUPER easy recipe!

The BeastsOfCooking believe that "Chef John's Macaroni and Cheese" was simply tasteful. The spice quotient seemed a bit high and if The Beasts make this again, which most likely will happen, they will tone down on the cayenne as well as the thyme.  Otherwise, the crust was delectable, and they found the sauce to be exquisite.

My household LOVES mac n chz and occasionally I'll experiment. I followed this recipe to the 'T'. My family gave it a 'thumbs' up, BUT they prefer my regular recipe.
The only thing I'd change about this recipe is the 'thyme'.. I wouldnt add it because I can taste a faint hint of it -NO THANKS
Aside from the thyme... it was an ok dish

This was a great recipe for Mac n cheese. I would definitely make it again. I might try to throw in some kind of meat to make it more grown up. Perhaps some crumbled bacon. It did have a little kick which was nice.

Excellent! I’ve made this multiple times. It’s always a crowd favorite. The biggest hit is when I add extra sauce and crumble bacon bits throughout the pasta, before adding the bread crumbs. My family always requests extra crust too, so now I double that.

This rating is based on my tastes.  I asked for an honest opinion from my family (always insist they tell the truth lest they have me make it again!) and was told by my husband and adult son that they really liked it.  I used sharp cheddar and Gruyere for the cheese which was great, but the thyme just wasn't a good taste for me.  I reduced the amount of macaroni to 12 ounces as others recommended. Everything else was as written.  I think that without the dried leaf thyme (not powdered) I would have liked it more.

This has an unusual blend of flavors that makes for a great macaroni and cheese dish.  I like the cheese sauce so much that I've used ti to make sauces for vegetables and as a base for soups.

I made it 3 days in advance and froze it till I needed it.  Defrosted the  casserole dish and baked as normal.  The kids LOVED it.  I will be making it again.  I forgot to add the Dijon mustard, cut back on red pepper and nutmeg.

I made this mac and cheese for a church holiday dinner...it sounded relatively easy and the ingredients were easily accessible.  It was a huge hit....every bite was gone - my husband didn't even get to try it.  I really like the thyme in the recipe - it gives the dish a comforting smell and taste.  I'll be making it again for Christmas!

My husband and I really liked this recipe for Mac and Cheese. The spices, and dijon mustard seemed to add a little kick to the sauce  but wasn't overbearing.  
I pretty much followed the recipe but  only used 8oz of macaroni (half a box). I think using a full 16 oz would have cut down on the flavor and made it too dry. I combined sharp cheddar, gouda and Mexican mix cheese and  mixed in some steamed broccoli so we would have some veggies.  Yummy!

I had to come back and review this recipe! Our family really enjoyed this for Thanksgiving. I have 3 kids and this got their approval.. they don't like any of the "fancy" mac & cheeses (they'd prefer kraft, come on!) but this is now their fave. They had leftovers for lunch today and already asked when I can make it again.

I DID make a few changes. I unfortunately left out most of the seasonings, I only used salt, pepper and garlic powder. I didn't have the rest on hand. I would've liked the additional seasonings, but I actually think the lack of them is another reason my kids loved it so much.

I double the sauce for the 1lb of pasta! I love cheesy and not dry mac & cheese. This definitely had extra sauce but it wasn't too much, and I would think the normal recipe wouldn't have enough! It was perfect with double sauce. I also used 2c extra sharp, 2c sharp & 2c monterey jack cheese. I really liked that combo but would think playing around with the cheeses would be great!

Highly recommend! Oh and doubling the sauce made almost 2 full 9x13 pans of this.

I quintupled this recipe the first time I made it and it disappeared. The person I made it for raved about it as the best meal they'd ever eaten. My pickiest child asked me to make sure to make it again after the first bite. I didn't change a thing.

Super flavorful! Swapped white pepper for black, added bacon and one diced chipotle, and went for a ½ sharp cheddar/ ½ pepper jack cheese mix. Perfect!

This is literally the best Mac and cheese I’ve ever had.  I used a pound of Trotolle pasta because they were out of large Macaroni.  It was awesome will use again.  No changes other then that to recipe!  I was skeptical because I thought some of the ingredients were weird but just made it all the better.

this recipe was amazing! I did make a lot of edits, for example; I replaced the thyme with oregano and the white pepper with black pepper. I also excluded the Dijon mustard. it was all great, but I forgot to cover it when it was baking. next time I make it I will remember to cover my baking pan.

I made it exactly as directed.  It was heavenly perfection!  For a bit of variety next time, I may add chopped sweet yellow onions and or/ chopped stewed tomatoes.  But, this recipe needs no alteration.  This recipe is simply incredible as-is!

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe and used 12 ounces of elbow macaroni and whole milk.   Made it with just Tillamook Farmstyle Shredded Sharp Cheddar.   Absolutely wonderful.

I did see a comment about not liking the thyme and I wondered if someone used ground thyme instead of dried.

First, this is for Prime38, you asked if you should add more milk since you thought yours was dry and the answer is no, just add less pasta next time. As for my review, I loved it! I used 16 ounces of elbow macaroni and it was very creamy, not dry at all. I left out all the herbs only adding salt and pepper and a dash of freshly grated nutmeg. I am a purist when it comes to my mac and cheese. To me, it needs no adornment with mustard, herbs or cayenne pepper. But that is simply personal preference. Mac and cheese is a comfort food for me, so keeping it basic is my favorite way to enjoy it. The buttered panko crumbs on top are fantastic! It gives a little crunch and a great flavor. Even though I don't add all the extras, this dish is very tasty and wholly satisfying to my tastebuds and my soul.

This makes a full 9x13 pan. It tastes ok, but it was really dry. I think if I made this again I would make the same amount of sauce but use half the macaroni. I like my mac and cheese saucy.

I added a chopped up onion.  It was very rich and cheesy - you don't need huge servings of it. Very tasty, though!

I made this for dinner tonight. Modifications made: 12oz of pasta rather than 16oz. 1/8 tsp cayenne as we aren't much into spicey food. also omitted the thyme as we aren't fans of it. every thing else was as written.

My family and I thought it was bland. I was underwhelmed by it. May try it again and add some of my own spices.

I can say it was creamy with the 12oz of pasta. I think the 16 would have been too dry.

As others said, the topping was the best part.

Best mac & cheese recipe ever! I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I especially like that he uses a full 16oz box of elbows. This is one of my Winter go-to meals. And Chef John's video is entertaining as well as an excellent guide. Feel like he's right there in my kitchen with me! Thanks, Chef!

Probably the best mac and cheese I’ve ever ate.  I used 2 cups of smoked cheddar cheese and 1 cup of parmesan mixed together, and about 14 oz of macaroni, which came out to a great taste and consistency with the cheese sauce clinging to the noodles and not runny at all.  I’m definitely bringing this to my next holiday party.

I have been wanting to make Chef John's Mac & Cheese for quite a while but my hubby always said that he had never had a  homemade Mac & Cheese that he ever liked. Today, I decided to make the Mac & Cheese to the letter of Chef John  anyway because I have never had a recipe of his that let me down.  We have always loved any recipe I have made of his so I followed the recipe exactly!  I read some reviews after I made it.  Some people said that they thought that the thyme was so over powering!  Well, to be honest, in this dish, all of the spices melded together without ANY ONE of them being detectable!  The cayenne, thyme, pepper, worcestershire sauce, nutmeg, salt, dijon mustard....they all melded to be one delicious, scrumptious sauce along with the sharp white cheddar that I used!    The panko crumbs with the melted, unsalted butter (I only used unsalted butter in this recipe) made a very tasty and a little crunchy topping, but I would not want to double it as some reviewers said.   The Mac & Cheese alone is also delicious!  So, in the end, this is on my favorites of recipes just like all of the rest of Chef John's recipes that I have made!  My hubby had three helpings, albeit small ones due to the butter, cheese, etc. and said that this is THE BEST homemade macaroni and cheese that he has ever had!  Thanks once again, Chef John!!!

No matter what I do, this always turns out dry. I know it’s not the recipe, it’s me. Next time I may leave off the topping and not bake. That seems to be the only way I can keep it creamy.

An excellent dish, gets that perfect cheesy flavor with 1 cup Parmigiano Reggiano and 2 cups White Cheddar for the sauce mix. Remember to use whole dried thyme leaves as opposed to ground or you'll get a really off flavor. I find toasting the breadcrumbs slightly in a pan with the butter beforehand makes them even more crunchy without being burnt, giving it a lovely golden top coat.

Needs a few small tweaks IMO, but great

I baked for half that time

Added 8 pieces of bacon and green onions and mixed it in there

Remove the pan from the heat source for about 30 seconds and then add the cheese, just turning it off was not good enough

Also added 2 cups of the cheese here to get a cheesier sauce

Excited to experiment with some different types of cheese

DON'T use preshredded cheese, get a block and shred it, so much better

Also I would probably add more cheese, I like really cheesy!

OMGEEEEEE! !! This is almost EXACTLY how my mom makes it...Hands down there is absolutely no comparison at all to store bought mac & cheese (which are more like chemical experiments). The only difference: The only spices she used was nutmeg,  white & course black pepper, dry mustard and the worcestshire sauce! Sometimes we add with cheddar cheese blend (3-kind style) is parmesan cheese or swiss cheese! But hey! Cheese is cheese, right? (Except processed kind!) Gosh this is GREAT!! And you know what? This cheese sauce is great over sliced potatoes to make homemade au gratin potatoes with same cheesy crusty tp! If I don't have panko bread crumbs I've actually substituted ritz buttery rounds or cheese its, hand crushed (not finely crushed)! It's still Delish! Thanks Chef John...and I didn't know Thomas Jefferson invented it! Man after my own heart!!!

I really like this recipe. I did make some changes because I bought the ingredients before I saw this recipe. I happened to have a bit of pepper jack cheese that is a bit spicy so I used that for the kick as I didn't have anything else to add for that. I also didn't have mustard seed so I used dijon mustard. The foundational ingredients stayed the same, really. I also use wide egg noodles because I like that better than macaroni noodles. It's how my grandmother made mac and cheese! :) Very great recipe that I will keep as my go to for mac and cheese!

Loved it, delicious! Only thing I did different is add some diced smoked and fried ham to it! May try using some smoked cheese next time to change it up but for a perfect mac n cheese this is my go to now.

My wife and I love Mac and Cheese, but recognize that the stuff in a box, while delicious, does not represent real Macaroni and Cheese. I wanted to make the real thing, and my mother and grandmother were not able to provide a recipe on such short notice.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and we loved it. I may halve the mustard next time, because the scent of it was fairly strong (and the wife doesn't care for mustard), but I was very happy and we both agree that this one goes into the recipe box.

I made it for a family gathering and EVERYONE from age 3-73 loved it!  I made the recipe as is except did not include white pepper as I didn't have any so substituted a bit of black pepper instead.  I will definitely make this again!

Followed recipe, easy to make. Loved by my cheese loving family. Second time I made it, I doubled the panko quantity because everyone wanted more of the "crunchies".

I didn't change a thing (except by accident left the mustard out). This was excellent. Topping is just great. Thank you for video which dismantled some stress about making the cheese sauce. Of course, my picky son liked Kraft better lol.

Great flavor and the crunchy topping is exactly what I was hoping for, however, it was DRY. I will definitely use this recipe again but I will either double the sauce or decrease my macaroni by a cup or cup and a half. Flavor gets 5 stars, texture gets 2 stars.

The only change I made was using whole wheat macaroni. Mine turned out gritty- I suspect it was the flour. Probably won't try it again although the crispys on top was very good.

Absolutely 5 stars all the way.  While this recipe hardly needs another review I just had to make one anyway.  Delicious, creamy, cheesy, oh so tasty.  We served it to 45 folks who all raved about it.  We served it with thin pork chops which were pan fried first , then tucked into the casserole on a slant before it went into the oven.  The best mac n cheese.  Thanks, Chef John.

It was delicious!  I omitted the thyme, not a fan.  Very much like my mom's, perfect for a cold, snowy day.  The ultimate comfort food.....

Very Creamy and comforting. I preferred the more sauce option and followed reviews to use 12 oz of pasta versus 16... Worked great...

Pure bliss!  I'm not a big fan of mac n' cheese but in a pinch I decided to make this for our little and the nanny as I had nothing in the house for them for dinner.  I reduced the spices given I was making it for a toddler, and used 2 cups of milk and 1 of cream to amp up the creaminess (of the few times I've eaten Mac n cheese I always feel like it's dry so I wanted to make sure this wasn't), it was just perfect! And on the recommendation of another reviewer I added the crispy onion straws to the panko & butter topping....and crushed up some bacon I just happened to have (I know, heart attack on a plate) but oh man was it good!  I made it ahead of time so that all the nanny had to do was put it in the oven, so the noodles and sauce hada chance to set before it cooked.  Then just before putting it in the oven, the cheese & topping were added.  They of course had it hot right out of the oven and loved it. My husband and I got home a little later so it was warm, not hot, but it was still unreal! This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  If you aren't concerned with upping the calorie count substitute 1/2 of the milk with evaporated milk.

I used all cheddar. DeCecco Cavatappi no. 87 pasta instead of elbows. They are similar but have a more corkscrew shape and hold together quite well. Outstanding. Thanks Chef John don't know what I'd do without your recipes and videos.

I have been making this mac and cheese for awhile and as other reviewers do, I cut down the pasta little bit. The brand of pasta, I usually buy comes in 14,5 oz box. So that's what I use. I keep everything  else the same.
Couple of time, I used half the amount of pasta and half chopped cauliflower that I boiled  right with the pasta. It was very good this way too. And I achieved a lower carb version for me,  and more veggies in the children's tummy.. ;-)

my husband loved it. he said it was the perfect balance. i liked it, it was a little bland for me but i had to substitute a lot of ingredients. Colby jack cheese, and crushed rice krispies for bread crumbs istead, no Dijon, no white pepper, and no cayenne pepper. 

but i loved the texture, next time i will make sure to have a better stocked kitchen!

Loved the little nip of cayenne and white pepper along with the subtle taste of  Worcestershire sauce.  I changed up the cheese by using 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1 cup Boar's Head Hickory smoked Gruyere and 1 cup of Kraft Italian mix of Parmesan, Romano & Asiago cheeses.  EXCELLENT!!

Just the right balance to make a great and tasty sauce.  I added bacon and served cherry tomatoes on the side.  It was awesome.

The sauce was not cheesy, gritty, and bland. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly other than reducing some of the TOPPING cheese (not sauce cheese). Might try it again.

my family said this recipe is better than my last one ...i have to agree, my new goto...we ate it so fast all in one sitting! i like that this doesn't use any processed cheese so it is healthier if you get good ingredients. all of the spices make it taste so good, very creamy. Mac and cheese can get bland but this had amazing flavor. i used 12 oz. of macaroni like everyone suggested not 16 oz. so it was creamier/cheesier, and made sure to buy dried thyme leaves as the recipe says, not ground thyme, that could be too strong? also  i sprinkled cheese first then the breadcrumbs on top like in the video (maybe the recipe had a typo). very tasty!

I made this for Easter as usually the host is so busy.  I turned around and looked where I had the food set up and it was almost gone.  It was a big hit.  I made it again today for my Husband and I and I added ham and diced tomatoes and probably about 4 cups of cheese.  I also used two cups of 2 percent milk and 2 cups of half and half.  Made it much creamier.  Made a few adjustments to the recipe and this is a Fantastic Mac and Cheese recipe.  The next time I make it for the family I will probably make it the same way today minus the ham and diced tomatoes you know how kiddos can be.  They just like the Mac and Cheese.  Delicious.....

This is the best recipe for mac & cheese I have ever tried. I made double portion and gave it free to some regular customers, 100% positive feedback. The negative reviews on here must be from people who are unable to follow a recipe correctly. Try it, follow the video and recipe carefully and you'll  be glad you did.

Made this tonight and it was WONDERFUL!  We had guests over for dinner, I've never seen food disappear so fast.  I went with the saucier version that he talks about in the video, and made it with Sharp Cheddar, Mozzarella, smoked Gouda, and a bit of Asiago.  Thank you Chef John!  Love, Love, Love this recipe!

I love Chef John's recipes--this is the only one that I think deserves less than a five-star rating. Perhaps I did something wrong! It just didn't strike me as a delicious dish. Mine turned out a little bland...

This REALLY was an amazing Mac & Cheese dish. Everyone loved it. I took Chef John's suggestion, and split the difference and used about 12 oz, I like mine a little cheesier so I thought 16 oz would be too much.  The best part was the Panko crumb top. It was great.  This is now my "go to" mac and cheese.

It was very easy and delicious! I think it would do without the thyme as it was fairly strong (in my opinion). It wasn't too cheesy. It was just right :)

This is a great tasting, easy recipe for mac and cheese. I made this on Christmas day when I was having friends over and a lot of last minute cleaning. I simply made it and put it in the crockpot for the baking portion and it was ready to go with the ham in about 4 hours. I just sprinkled on some breadcrumbs and cheese to make it "pretty." I go between this recipe and another recipe from this site to keep my macaroni loving husband happy. Thanks for a quick, easy and delicious recipe.

Great recipe!  I used half smoked Gouda, half sharp cheddar, and added parmegano reggiano. Turned out awesome.Yes, its a little expensive for mac and cheese, but if you want cheap mac and cheese then use velveeta or kraft box mac and cheese. 
Second, if you think it was too dry and not creamy enough, use less pasta. In the video he mentions that it'll be more dry if you use 16 ounces of pasta. I used 8 and it was almost too creamy. Thanks Chef John! Your stuff is always great.

This is pretty close to perfect and I am a very fussy old lady.  Thanks Chef John.  I used a bit of extra cheese too that I had in the fridge and I didn't want to lose it.

This is by far THE BEST macaroni and cheese recipe that I have ever found. I used 12 oz of elbow macaroni and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The spices made the dish and my vegetarian daughter LOVES this mac and cheese.  I have made it 3 times in a week and a half and this last time I doubled the batch to meet my daughter's demand :)  Even when the dish is reheated, there is enough cheese sauce to keep the macaroni moist and not dry.  Thank you, Chef John!

Really great! I had to take out the cayenne and white pepper because my family doesn't like that much spice. But the sauce was great and I will definitely use this recipe again.

I am extremely sensitive to spice and even a little spice makes me not like something. However, this was amazing!! Everyone loved it! I made extra extra crust and received so many compliments. It had just the right about of kick but the crust really made this recipe. I do not like watery Mac and cheese. This was not watery at all. Absolutely love it and recommend!

Mmmmmm. This is truly comfort food. The flavor was superb!  I like my macaroni and cheese very moist and so I used only 8 oz. of pasta, and I found it perfect that way, creamy and not at all runny. The crunchy topping added a delicious balance to the texture of this very satisfying dish. I'm always very pleased with Chef John's recipes.

Despite my skepticism about adding nutmeg and thyme, this recipes tops the mac and cheese that I was raised on (don't tell Mom)--one of my top favs from her kitchen! Creamy, cheesy, rich, but not too rich, with a crust topping that takes it right over the edge. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but turned on the broiler at 20 minutes to quicken the browning. Absolutely incredible. I won't be missing the gym this week, or next.

Although I did make alterations this is a great recipe. I didn't add the thyme because some people said it was overwhelming. I added one beaten egg in with the last cup of milk and although taboo I added the packet from Kraft macaroni and cheese to add extra cheese flavor. The only other change I used Ritz crackers in place of the panko crumbs. Sorry for the changes but it was a great base.

followed to a T, but I found it had too much thyme - will probably just leave it out next time. Wish I had read reviews or trusted my instinct about the thyme - it just isn't the flavour we want for mac and cheese, but it was very creamy and  had a great topping.

Best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. I didn't put the extra cheese and breadcrumbs on top because I forgot to save some of the cheese and didn't want to put just breadcrumbs. My whole family loved it so I will make it this way always. Thanks Chef John.

Lovely mac and cheese. I felt a bit unsure about using the 5 year old Balderson Cheddar I had in the fridge on such a humble comfort food but it was to die for. If you found the recipe bland you should probably use better, snappier cheese. I made a bit more topping than the recipe calls for and did not regret it.

For the first time in my life I used white pepper and Dijon mustard in a recipe and I have to say they both were great add-ins!  I think next time I will use about 14 oz. of macaroni or increase the liquid component a bit...I like it a little bit more creamy.  I am going to use white pepper in more of my pasta dishes.

Excellent recipe, similar to an old one i used to make but Chef Johns is smoother, mine would come out a bit more chewy. So far, Chef John has been my primary source of recipes off of this site and not even intentionally, i look up chicken parmigiana, it a recipe by the Chef, homestyle mac, Chef John, excellent recipe, excellent chef!

I decided I was going to use 12 ounces of macaroni with this dish and then decided to halve it, so I used 6 ounces.  I used a combination of mild cheddar, muenster and colby jack cheeses.  I made the full amount of panko topping and it fit in 5 small ramekins and everyone got their own topping....it turned out superb!  I cooked them until the top was golden and crisp about 13 minutes.  I am not a fan of the thyme in here.  I like thyme.  I like it a lot actually but I don't particularly care for it in my mac and cheese but it was worth a shot!

I prepared this dish exactly as written and although the flavor was good, we found it to be very dry. We like our Mac N Cheese to be cheesy and creamy. I now make it with the original measurements for the sauce but only 1/2 the amount of pasta and it's perfect for us.

I was surprised at how much the butter dominated and, yet, how flat it tasted overall. Still, a good sauce to start with.

This was fantastic! I made the recipe almost exactly as is, except I cut it down to 4 servings. I used a tad less cayenne just because there were kids eating it, but the amount I used (about half of 1/8tsp) gave it a good kick. The only other difference was I used half sharp cheddar, and half triple cheddar blend. I divided it up into 4 little individual ramekins and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper! Stayed creamy and not dry after baking, except the delicious crusty top. The flavors were spot on. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We served it with a garden salad, honey rosemary carrots, and yep, fried chicken!

I have made this twice now; the first time was good, the second was out of this world.  I adjusted the pasta to only 12 oz so it was creamier and doubled the topping.  I also made sure the pasta had cooled before I added the cheese sauce.  This ensures that the pasta doesn't absorb too much liquid and dry out.  Be sure to add the cheese a little at a time in step 4, so it stays smooth.  Fantastic!

After inhaling two bowls (oops!) I figured I'd review this recipe. It is AMAZING. Hubs and 2 yr old LOVED it. Mixed things up a bit and used margarine (I know.. I know, but I ran out of butter), whole wheat flour, whole wheat pasta but you CANNOT tell the difference other than the roux will be a bit flecked. I added 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire, ditched the salt altogether and used ground thyme instead of dried. I also only used 2 1/2-3/4 cups of cheese (Armstrong Old Cheddar and a bit of mozz mix) and it was plenty cheesy for our tastes but I can see why people would love the full amount! The crust was excellent and I took other reviewers' suggestions and added another 1/4 cup of panko and it was perfection. Thanks Chef J!

Delicious!  I watched the video first, then followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have enough sharp cheddar so used some colby jack too.  No white pepper so used black.  And I'm not a huge fan of Thyme so I just used a pinch.  Turned out so beautiful I should have taken a picture but was more interested in just eating it.  It is literally TOO good; I couldn't stop eating it and now I'm stuffed.  Hubby loved it too.  Last week I tried a mac and cheese recipe that was on the cover a food network magazine.  It was awful (raw onion?  I should have known) Chef John now outranks Alton Brown in our house.

Due to my fear of lack of flavor, I added a few dashes of onion and garlic powder, and parmesan cheese (1/4 cup). The family and I loved it! The cayenne gives a really nice flavor without being spicy.

Made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it. A few slight changes: Cayenne reduced to 1/8 tsp was plenty for the kids and I left out the topping, just sprinkled some remaining cheese over the top and crisped up nicely under the broiler. My husband said that he would pay money for mac and cheese like this and he can't wait to get his hands on the leftovers. He also suggested this would be a great cheese sauce over vegetables such as broccoli and/or cauliflower. I thought it was a cinch to make, I simplified some of the roux directions and dumped all the spices in together just before the milk, then added the milk all at once. Cane out smooth and creamy.  Easy and delicious, this will be in my regular rotation.

This was PERFECT!! I only changed two things. I didn't have elbow macaroni so I used penne (which I think turned out better anyway!) and for the second tray I used mini bow-ties which were way too small for the heavy "sauce." I also left out the cayenne because of my little kids, but I'll be making a second tray with cayenne for the adults next time!

I don't think you realize how incredible this is!  The crust was the star of the show.  I had mine all made, then found that the only breadcrumbs I had were the Italian seasoned kind.  That ended up being what was most talked about.  I am hesitant to try Panko next time for fear of disappointing the family.   I made this for Easter....and was promptly informed it would be added to the Thanksgiving menu.  I have *never* gone wrong with anything from Chef John!

After trying 6 other recipes, I have found a keeper.  This has become a staple in our home.  I sometimes play around with different cheeses (smoked gouda or chipotle cheddar) but always go back to sharp cheddar.  I omit the Dijon mustard (left a strange aftertaste), reduce the pasta to 12oz and double the planko topping.  Everyone loves it.

Very, very good. I used less Thyme but will just leave it out next time.  Since I like a lot of sauce I will use less pasta. Love the yellow color & the taste the mustard adds. A classic but not boring Mac N Cheese. Love Chef John!

First time I made this I didn't have enough macaroni but followed all the other ingredients the same. it was phenomenal! since then I've tried the recipe as written and it was too dry. Even tried it with 2/3 the macaroni and it was still too dry and bland. now I say HALF the macaroni to get a 5 stay recipe.

I think this could be good with some changes. It was just way too spicy for my family. The spice totally covered up the cheese flavor. I usually love Chef John's recipe but this one disappointed me. Sorry.

Really good recipe.  Do NOT omit the salt. The key is to use a variety of cheeses.  I used sharp white cheddar and smoked Gouda.  This dish tastes even better after it has gotten cold and then reheated. I also stuffed a few hamburgers with it and grilled. Excellent surprise when you bite into the burger.  Perfect comfort food!

I was so looking forward to trying this recipe and I finally did tonight but it was a disappointment. I don't know exactly what it was but after reviewing some other reports I think maybe perhaps it was the thyme? There is something in there I didn't like. Maybe the Dijon mustard?? We all have different tastes and I would never criticize anyone who liked it but I didn't.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time, I made it exactly as the recipe stated, using the full amount of thyme, which was WAY too overpowering.  The second time, I doctored it a little bit and I used 1 lb of Velveeta instead of cheddar and doubled the topping.  I cut the thyme in half and it was still too overpowering.  Next time, I won't use it at all. The cayenne pepper is a nice touch, but my hubby found it a bit too spicy, so I'll probably cut that in half next time.  Overall, good potential but requires some fine-tuning.

This was good but not quite the to-die-for that I was hoping for. It is more on the creamy side than the cheesy side (even though I did use sharp cheddar). I will try a different recipe next time. I am not after a boxed-style mac and cheese, just something a little more cheesy. I followed the recipe as written.

I am a huge fan of Chef John.  But this was just ok to me.  Did not like the thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard in it.   My husband said he wanted to taste more cheddar cheese.  I think mustard and Worcestershire sauce overpowered it so he could not taste cheese.   I am sorry but this is not a keeper.

Love this recipe - made it many times.  I just tried mixing it up as part of a beer themed menu for superbowl - wow, a totally different flavor!  Replace 1 cup of milk with 1 cup of amber beer and add some bacon.  Whoa!

To the people who hated the thyme flavor, either cut out or use powdered thyme.  I've noticed with dried thyme the flavor is much more prominent.  Delicious any way I've served it and always had folks coming back for more!

I don't usually take the time to rate the recipes I use, most often because I modify them and feel it would be unfair. I HAD to take a moment to do so today. I was looking for a recipe I could "upcycle"  without a ton of alterations, but also make normally and enjoy. Jackpot!! To upcycle I used high end ingredients (fresh pasta, 1c. Shredded kerrygold aged cheddar with Irish whiskey, 2 c. Organic aged cheddar from wegman's (I forget the brand) and organic milk from the local farm). I always use local, organic butter. The only "alteration" I made was that I used 2 1/2 tsp of truffle infused olive oil instead of butter in the crust (the substitution equivalent). To die for, to say the least. My husband raved and raved. Thank you, Chef John. Whether a normal meal, side dish, or a special treat, this is my go-to recipe from now on.

This was great. I too used 12 oz of macaroni. 16 oz would be too much I think for the ratio of sauce. The spices were spot on. I did not put the cheese on top of the panko. Not my thing. The crunchy panko was just right. I put the extra chees underneath. You must whisk the sauce fairly constantly though.

Delicious made as is! I watched the video and used 12oz of pasta (about 1.5 cups, dry). Next time I will try with 8oz for a creamier mac n cheese. Also, while I did turn off and remove the roux mix from the burner to add in the cheese, my sauce came out a little grainy--after baking for 20 minutes it was barely noticeable. From reading other reviews, it seems to have been due to the cheeses I used (four cheese mexican blend and sharp cheddar--both already shredded) or I added too much cheese in to the sauce (started with adding 1 full cup and then by the 1/2 cup). Another review says the cheese should be added in slowly, 1/4 cup at a time. I will try this recipe again, adding the cheese in smaller increments and maybe even shredding the cheeses myself.

This was incredible!  Thanks, Chef John.  Made just a couple of minor changes.  Used 2 cups cheese and 3 1/2 cups milk.  Sauce was the perfect consistency.  Added Kellog's Corn Flakes crumbs instead of Panko.  Also, I added leftover Thanksgiving day ham (2 cups) to make it a full meal.  I'd cut back on the salt a bit if adding the ham. This is a winner....

Yum!  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 italian blend cheeses, and I also added a little velveeta because I live in KY and it seems to be a rule in the south!  I also pre-measured my spices and mixed them together and just added them at once to the sauce. This helped on my prep and cleanup time and it does not affect the overall flavor at the end!  Very good recipe will definitely make again!

This is my go to recipe for Mac and cheese but I have thought I would like it even more if it were creamier. Having read the reviews I now realize that in effort to stretch the ingredient. To increase the quantity, I increased the amount of pasta thinking it would not compromise the outcome. So now I know not to do that, but what can I do to make the dish a creamier consistency?

This is very good! I was looking for a mac and cheese recipe that didn't call for processed cheese, and I've enjoyed Chef John's recipes previously. I'll make it again, though I'll play with the spices a little as not quite perfect blend yet for my taste buds.  However, I will halve the recipe as this makes more than 6 servings! I bet the leftovers will be yummy though.

First of all Chef John, I would like to thank you for teaching me how to make a roux! I now use this as my base for thickening all kinds of sauces, very useful indeed.
My family voted your macaroni and cheese as one of the top dishes of the week. It was tied with the baked teriyaki chicken from Ms. Collins (also on this site). Your dish was very delicious and easy to make. I gave it four stars as I had to subtract one because I did make some alterations. I did not use thyme, because no one in my family likes it. Instead I seasoned it with garlic and some red chili flakes. I didn't have elbow macaroni and substituted with bowties (though I think that makes little difference). Also I did not have panko bread crumbs, so I made my own with a day old loaf of french bread (I also think this makes little difference to the original recipe). I added some chopped ham because my husband loves the combination of ham and cheese. Oh and I couldn't get sharp cheddar cheese and used mild instead. All in all, it came out yummy! Side dishes were green beans with bacon and a scarlet runner bean salad. I will be putting this in my recipe box to be used again!

This is a good mac and cheese dish. Next time I  will not add any Thyme. I did not use the ground thyme but the leaves and I could definitely taste it throughout the dish. It was kind of strong. My kids and husband thought the same thing.

LOVE CHEF JOHN! 

BUT...the sauce needs to be doubled OR as John suggested use 1/2 amount of pasta...

VERY VERY DRY... but could be great with a few modifications...

I haven't tried many mac and cheese recipes because after we tried this one, it became our go-to. The only modification I make is to reduce the cayenne by half: while the adults like it full strength, it's a bit much for our little one. I make a full batch and portion it into 3 single-serving lasagna baking dishes: I cook one and put the other two in the freezer. It freezes well, which seems important for this recipe because it is about a 1.5 hour time commitment, at least for this beginning cook.

This is a very good recipe. Watching the video was very helpful in that Chef John goes over your options. I chose fewer noodles for a creamier mac and cheese experience. Ten ounces of noodles were perfect for my family. If you use whole nutmeg, and you should, use half of what you think you might need. I used what I thought was a pinch, and it was strong in nutmeg. Happily, we all like nutmeg here. If you think you have panko and don't, as happened to me, saltines make a decent substitute, just don't pulverize them.

I altered this to increase the sauce while still using 1 lb of pasta.  It was great!  Only 4 of us home and I think the whole thing will be gone.

Amazing taste... spices were spot on.  But I agree with the other reviews... we should have used less pasta in order to get a creamier sauce.  Pro tip:  Add little pieces of bacon (real bacon... not bacon bits) when mixing the cheese sauce and the pasta! Bacon goes well with anything!

um. YuMMMM. I made it with 1/3 cheddar and 2/3 sharp white cheddar, but could also add gruyere or whatever kind of cheese on hand. Also works better with using less pasta like 12oz so there's more sauce

I like to add a few handfuls of chopped kale when I boil the noodles OR I add thawed spinach before stiring in the cheese.  It adds an extra layer of flavor and more color.

This recipe is well worth 5 stars. Although I am not a professional cook, I do cook for function on a weekly basis. This dish is and has always been a HUGE! I really think that it's important to state that like all recipes I chose I almost always alter it to my individual tastes. I have never made it with the thyme and I have found that the Worcestershire and mustard can make or break it on flavor.The recipe uses a basic rue, and I have never had an issue with it not being the perfect creamy. This recipe is fabulous to play with and I highly suggest trying before writing it off all together! One experiment I did I used the Worcestershire mustard and some Cajun seasoning, it was beyond amazing! In short LOL love this recipe and for those who had issues try experimenting along with watching your heat during the rue sauce do not add to much cheese(this is what is making it grainy) and you should be good to go!!!

We loved this macaroni and cheese!  It's creamy and cheesy and the herbs give it wonderful flavor.  I used 16 oz of macaroni but took the advice of some others and doubled the cheese sauce.  We do love it extra creamy but next time I will only up the cheese sauce by half; that is plenty extra. Since my sweetheart ate two bowls before I could get it to the oven, I'm going to cook a bit more macaroni (probably about 6-8 oz more) and use the rest of the sauce so I have a full pan to bake.  Oh - I left off the panko bread crumbs this time and simply liberally sprinkled the top with paprika.  Great recipe and I will make it again and again.  Thank you, Chef John.

I just made this recipe & had to alter a couple things - not because I wanted to, but just going with things I had on hand.  I am currently not living in the US so getting some ingredients at the local store isn't always something I can do.  Instead of panko crumbs or bread crumbs of any sort, I ground up Bugles (how I can get those & not breadcrumbs is a mystery to me!!).  It turned out excellent!!  It was just the right amount of ooey, gooey cheesy-ness plus tangy from the cayenne pepper and Dijon mustard (had to substitute Spicy Brown mustard).  Will make again and again and again!!  Thanks!!

I halved the recipe and cut the macaroni back to 4 ounces which made it very cheesy and yummy.  I had reservations about the seasonings in the sauce, but it is a nice combination of flavors with the cheese.  I would never have thought to put thyme in mac and cheese, but it really works.  I used the three cheeses that Chef John states in the video (Cheddar, Gouda, and Gruyère) and I really enjoyed this dish.  And the Panko topping is also a winner. Thanks, Chef John!!!

Very good but not quite the classic mac and cheese that I was expecting. I didn't the thyme was too strong. Overall excellent flavor, not sure what I would change to get the classic dish I was looking for.

Very nice, loved the crispy crunch of the top that the Panko gave it. 
I added a little parmigiano reggiano that I microplaned over the top to give it a nice crunch. 

next time I might add a bit of bacon. 
Everything goes better with bacon.

Holy cow!! Thomas Jefferson knew how to rock some macc & cheese! This stuff is addictive. I used Keebler Club crackers instead of the Panko but otherwise followed Chef John's awesome direction.

This recipe is the closest to my aunt's legendary recipe (that she refuses to share) that I have found yet. Followed it to the letter, used 3 parts (F&E) sharp cheddar to 1 part Kerrygold Reserve cheddar. My wife is super-sensitive to thyme, and she didn't detect it. I agree that it must be the difference of using dried versus ground (I used dried as specified). This is my go-to baked mac-n-cheese now. Awesome!

We have tried several mac and cheese recipes from this site and this one is the best.  It is a perfect texture, smooth and creamy.  Everything you want in cheese sauce.

I made this for a crowd and it was a hit!  I've since cut it down to use as a side for dinner as well.  Rather than make the crust, I skipped the baking and put it in to homemade bread bowls.  It was awesome!

This was amazing!  I am rating this on his suggestions in his video (which is VERY helpful in making a good roux).  Chef John used a combination of cheddar, gouda and gruyere.  I also was a little heavy handed with the cheese. DO NOT use the bagged shredded cheese!  Take the time and shred your own.  The bagged cheese has a coating to keep it from sticking together and it will change the consistency AND taste of your dish. I did increase the topping a little as I like a crunchy top.  The baking time was perfect.  Thanks, Chef John.  This is the 2nd recipe of yours that I have LOVED.  I'm on the hunt for my 3rd!

Everyone loved this, even my picky daughter.  I used plain cheddar, not sharp, to make it appealing to kids.  I 1.5 times the pasta and cheese sauce, but doubled the topping as everyone likes the crunchy top, and stuck it in a 9 x 12 casserole dish.  Yummy!

So delicious!!! I don't really like thyme and didn't have worcestirshire sauce, so made a few changes based on other reviews.

After making the roux, I added 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp white pepper.  Then I added the milk cold (which i got nervous about last minute), but turned out fine.  I grated some nutmeg and then added the salt and dijon mustard as directed (cut down a little on the salt). I actually added the mustard before the cheese by accident, but it was fine.  

I think the key is the cheese.  I had an excellent sharp cheddar and a dutch gouda recommended by the person at the cheese counter.  Did about 2 parts cheddar, 1 part gouda, freshly grated.  I used the entire 16 ounce package and baked it in a 9.5 x 14.5 pyrex casserole dish (I don't know what the real measurements are.. just used a tape measure.  in any case, it was kinda large).  Turned out amazing.  Really great ratio of cheese to pasta.  Very gourmet restaurant quality, and the wide dish means that a lot of the pieces had the panko crust and even the pasta was slightly crispy.  I accidentally skipped sprinkling the cheese before the panko, but turned out fine.  

My first time making mac and cheese from scratch and I have always wanted to try it.  This was a great one!

This has a lot going for it, so 5 stars. It was not my very favorite because I missed the flavor of garlic in this dish. I do think I prefer a teaspoon of dried ground mustard powder to a teaspoon of Dijon also. But this is definitely a top contender with just a few flavor tweaks based on personal preference :) Thanks for sharing!

I have made homemade macaroni and cheese plenty of times but there always seemed to be something missing.  I was even told by someone that the old box version was better.  Well I made this last Saturday for a family get together and everyone said it was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever made!  And yes, I am one of those people that hate reading reviews only to find out they really didn't make the recipe but their version of it (which is great and helpful too, but I like knowing what people think of the original :)) BUT, I did leave something out, the nutmeg.  My mother HATES nutmeg so I wouldn't put it in.  I used a combination of sharp cheddar and gruyere cheeses as Chef John did in the video.  I didn't use the gouda as he did in the video. Anyway I did everything else the same even down to the topping and it was REALLY good!  Thanks Chef John, I love your video's, they make me want to cook!

I've made this several times and my family LOVES it. We use 12 oz macaroni (can't find 16 oz packages anymore but we like it more saucy anyway), double the topping, and bake it in a 9x13 pan so the crumbs cover a larger surface area.

Omg...I think I might die.  This is so yummy!  Like others have suggested, I made extra sauce to go with all that pasta and doubled up on the spices.  Sautéed diced onions, frozen peas and prosciutto and mixed that in with the pasta for that extra something.  Also, ended up using brown rice pasta from trader joes for a gluten-free/low carb alternative.  The flavors were awesome though.  We didn't even notice that it was rice pasta.

I loved it! A little complicated, but overall very very good. I only changed two small things, I didn't have Dijon mustard and substituted it for a little dry mustard added with the nutmeg, and I didn't have macaroni noodles and substituted it with shells. I think I added too much cheese to the crust, so I won't do that next time, but it was great that night and it was great as leftovers for the rest of the week. Definitely a keeper! Thank you Chef John, your videos crack me up.

Chef John, this recipe rocks!!! I did decrease to 12oz. of macaroni and glad I did, hubby loved it!! I did a little less than 1/4tsp. of thyme because I did not want to overpower the taste as others have stated, but boy this was soo good. I used skim milk because it was what I had and those panko crumbs are a must!!!

I don't know if I can make this again cause I can't stay out of it!!! Breakfast, lunch and dinner! lol I don't think the spices were at all overwhelming...I wonder if the people that mentioned that measured right?  I did use the whole 16 ounces of pasta and I used the cavatappi pasta, so fun!  I did use mild cheddar cause that was all I had and regular pepper...never owned white pepper in my life.  Didn't have Panko so used regular bread crumbs...so yummy!!!!!  Thanks Chef John!

The best ever Mac-N-Cheese! I only used 12 oz of pasta, increased the Panko breadcrumbs to 2/3 cup with more butter and added 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese (the real McCoy stuff) with 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese to top the breadcrumbs with. I had to bake it for 30 minutes in order for the cheese to melt on top, perhaps because I live at an altitude of 6000 feet. Thanks Chef John! Everyone loved this.

I have been searching for a good mac and cheese recipe since I left the States and can't find Velveeta cheese where I am now living.  This recipe was too cumbersome and time comsuming to make, and it did not taste very cheesy like mac and cheese made with Velveeta.

I followed they recipe to the "T", it turned out beautiful and very creamy but, I did not care for the taste all.  If I make it again I will definitely leave out the thyme and probably the nutmeg.  I am rating it a three as it was a fairly easy recipe to make and except for the taste turned out OK.

This recipe is great as is but even better as a jumping off point for more creative mac and cheese endeavors. As long as you stick with around 3 cups of cheese, you can play around with as many varieties as you like. I've been known to add in a cup or 2 of fontina, muenster, or spicy buffalo cheddar... it always comes out great! 

For those who like their mac and cheese on the gooey side (and who doesn't?), try making this recipe with a box of whole wheat barilla (whatever shape you like), which is less than 16 ounces.

I have been looking for a mac and cheese recipe for SO long and this one is exactly what I was looking for!! I make it with less macaroni noodles because I love it to be really creamy and saucy. I like to put it on a long flat dish with extra toppings as that always seems to be everyone's favorite part. The recipe is also good without the crispy topping with some extra cheese on top if you are a cheeseaholic like myself! Thank you for your great recipe's Chef John!!!

Everyone in my family loved this! The things I did differently were I did not add the nutmeg and I used a can of evaporated fat free milk with regular skim milk to make the 3 cups. I also doubled the panko crumbs as others suggested and had just  the right amount of crumb topping. Delicious!

Awesome Mac and Cheese, I am in highschool and am prone to mistakes, so i accidently put in 1/2 tablespoons cayenne pepper instead of 1/2 teaspoon.  My mother loved and so did I! She says it is the only mac and cheese has actually liked and the exrta cayenne pepper really added a kick.

Yummy!  I used 14 oz of pasta, and an extra cup of milk and cheese.  Also added ham.   The mustard was a little strong for my taste, but over all a very creamy recipe.

Very good! I didn't have thyme, and I doubled the crust. It was delicious. I think my younger kids might like it without the cayenne next time.

The only changes I made was increasing the sauce and topping a bit, and used whole wheat macaroni and reduced fat cheddar.  Very rich and creamy, absolutely delicious! Thought I had made plenty to pack for lunches, but we had no leftovers as we couldn't stop eating!  Can't imagine a better mac n' cheese recipe.  Thanks for posting!

This was definitely the best topping i've ever had!  I liked the flavour of the sauce but will make changes next time.  First i'll used less macaroni next time as I like it creamy and it wasn't.  And I'll probably leave out the thyme next time.  It was a bit overpowering and just didn't seem like the right taste to me.  Otherwise it was great!

I can't say this is the best mac and cheese I've ever had, but it tasted pretty good. Lot's said it was not creamy, so I used an extra cup of milk and adjusted the flour. The sauce thickened up a lot when I baked it, so I am glad I made extra. It probably would have tasted better if I'd not mixed cheeses. Next time I will just use sharp cheddar cheese.

I was too scared to add the dijon and nutmeg, but I also think I under cooked the butter/flour mixture because my end product tasted like flour.  I will try again, making sure to cook the butter/flour mixture for the recommended amount of time.  Seems like a promising recipe.

This mac and cheese is fabulous!  I always like Chef John's recipes and this is no different.  I substituted some of the cheddar cheese for pepper jack.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  It turned out crispy on the top and sides with a nice melted, cheesy center.  Thanks Chef John!

so good! my boyfriend and his dad both got seconds. made recipe with two tweaks suggested by reviewers: 12 oz pasta and omitted the thyme. perfect ratio of sauce to pasta and the tiny amount of Worcestershire sauce, nutmeg and mustard gives the recipe some depth. perfect!

I made this for my teenage boys and did a half recipe because it was such a huge portion and then it was gone on the same day.  They complained I didn’t make enough. If you want to make the full two pans you can always freeze one. Highly recommend.  No alterations were made to the recipe.

I made this for “the children” at our Christmas dinner. Well, all the adults gobbled it up! Very flexible and easy. I used shredded cheddar, smoked Gouda, and VELVEETA! I didn’t have planko crumbs in the house, so I crushed some breadcrumbs. Delicious!

We have never cooked Mac-N-Cheese from scratch.  This was our first, second, and third try leading up to holiday dinner.  Everyone liked the final creation.  The only had two minor differences in ours.  We removed the Cayenne since it seemed to overwhelm the flavor for us.  We also used a total of two pounds of cheese for 16 oz of elbows.  This is so we had a nice think layer on top.  All in we really like the recipe.

My husband and I loved this! It has a little bit of a bite, which is really nice and adds interest to the dish. I used 8 oz of macaroni and cooked in a small casserole dish since there are just two. I had some of the creamy sauce left over and used it on toast the next morning. Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly. It was okay and a nice macaroni recipe.....but that was all, there was no wow factor in it for me or my family, so somewhat disappointed about that as that was what I was hoping for.

I followed another reviewers idea to use the entire 16 oz box of pasta and double most everything else for the sauce. The macaroni was cheesy and delicious.  Everyone raved about the topping also! Thanks

I love the rich flavors and the herbiness from the thyme. It's not rich and stringy gooey, which is fine by me. The sauce is just right to make this indulgent and a family fave.

This was great. I used three different cheeses instead of all sharp cheese. That was the only change. Used as a side for Thanksgiving dinner upon request of a family member.  Never made before. Everyone liked it.

You can never go wrong with Chef John.  By far, my favorite go to for reliable recipes.  I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  It tasted good but I fell victim to it being too dry.  I’ll probably the idea of a little less macaroni or something.

I've made this recipe, to a T, countless times (in fact, I've got it baking  to take to Thanksgiving as I type this,) and it comes out perfect every time. Thank you, Chef John! You've provided a wonderful, go-to mac and cheese recipe that wins every time! (Oh, the only change I've ever made is to occasionally add chopped jalapenos to the cheese sauce, but only when I'm feeling spicy ;)

Made this last night with a few tweaks due to my spice cupboard not having everything I thought I did. Oops. Added some garlic and onion powder in place of the cayenne and the nutmeg. Also, made it completely gluten free because I have celiac. It was wonderful. My son is very skeptical of macaroni and cheese anymore and he went back for seconds. My daughter loved it too. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was too dry for me. I was trying something different from my tried and true recipe by Martha Stewart and it was a disappointment. For example, MS recipe calls for 5 cups of milk while this one has just 3. I did like the Panko crust and will be using that for my Mac and cheese next time.

Delicious as is! We added a little less pasta to make it more creamy, as others suggested. Next time I may add garlic powder for a little more flavor, but really this recipe is great as it stands.

This makes a lot - filled a 9" x 13" casserole.  I cooked one pound of pasta and made about 1/3 more sauce - otherwise followed the recipe.  Flavor was good, would have preferred more sauce so would recommend increasing those ingredients.  We didn't love the bread crumbs and cheese topping - I'd leave that off next time.  Overall it was okay, not my favorite but I'll keep looking.

So good! Doubled the recipe; baked and served half for tonight’s dinner; mixed and refrigerated half for a potluck on Tuesday. I was very patient about cooking the sauce to avoid breaking it, and hope that gentle baking will allow it to be as delicious for that get-together! My only substitution was 1 Tbs dry mustard for the prepared mustard, and left out the cayenne. Another winning recipe, Chef John!

I love the flavor of this, a little zingier than regular cheese sauce.  I made a mistake of adding all the cheese instead of just 2.25 cups & it got gummy.  That's the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars because I see from other reviews that they cut down the pasta to make it creamier.  I will definitely try that next time.

We love this recipe! I grew up in Lancaster County so I'm used to bland mac & cheese. The little bit of kick is refreshing. It works with all kinds of cheese as well. I've used gouda before and swiss last night.

Doubled the crust and used Italian breadcrumbs instead, and added an extra 1 1/2 cups of cheese (Monterey Jack) to the cheddar sauce. Turned out perfect!

Great recipe for good ol comfort food! Easy to make and delicious! Only made a couple changes - a little extra cheese and switched out a cup of cheddar for a cup of Monterey Jack cheese with jalapenos. Gave it a nice little zing. Like everyone else said, the crust was really good.

I made with 16oz of GF elbows and GF flour and was pleased with the cheesiness. If I made it again, I’d use a different cheese and more salt.

I left out a few of the spices due to family preferences; but the recipe was Delish and I plan on making it again. I might try extra sharp cheese next time, or maybe even adding another cheese. 

My entire family enjoyed it.! This one is a keeper!

I liked the herb combination in the bechamel... but the flavors didn't come through after baking. Also came out very dry. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients. BUT I divide the mixture into two smaller casserole bowls... might just be that I baked it too long. next time I will add more of the herbs  and shorten the baking time

I love a good Mac’n’cheese, and this one was at the top of my list. The only substitutions I made were the cheese types and the topping.  I had some leftover American, sharp cheddar, and Colby so used all three to make 3 cups.  And I had some potato chip crumbs, so used those as the topper.   Easily,  one the best Mac’n’cheese I’ve ever had.

Not as quick to prep as the recipe indicates but it was tasty. If I make it again, this dish will be relegated to weekends and holidays. That said, the toddler loved it and my roommate who claims to not like Mac and Chesse ate two bowls of this. I would experiment next time with different cheeses being mixed in. Also, I didn't have white pepper so I used regular, it didn't seem to make a difference.

I used 12 ounces of macaroni, and followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was just OK. Neither creamy nor cheesy. Almost had a bitter taste to it. Not sure what I did wrong.

I increased the cream sauce amounts a bit and made the whole 16 ounces of macaroni.  Used sharp cheddar and gruyere.  Also increased amount of panko topping, cuz it's just so crunchy and good. Delicious!   And I had enough to freeze some for another time.

I made this tonight and it was absolutely the best baked Mac and cheese that I’ve ever had. The only thing I changed is that I used 1 cup of cheddar cheese and 1 cup of Parmesan cheese  in the mixture. I will definitely make this dish over and over again.

AMAZING! My first mac and cheese! I had left over shredded chicken breastsmoke cooked in Frank's Red Hot.  Mixed that in the cooked pasta. Got to play with the cheeses, I used a spicy habanero pepper Jack! Also, I added 1/4tsp. Cayenne pepper! Delicious! Gonna definitely make this again! Didn't mean to doctor it up but thank you!

My go to mac and cheese recipe, always a favourite with my crew, even my picky 11 year old son. I've added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper once or twice and it added a bit too much kick to it, but it still got eaten, chased down by a big glass of milk :-)

I personally did not enjoy this dish. I am not a big spice person, and would remove the cayan peppers, thyme, and the whit peppers. I left out the mustard because of personal preference. Make sure to see how much of each spice, do not do more than asked, and I would make this again just without the spices.

delicious! My family is picky when it comes to a recipe that rivals my MIL's but this is pretty darn close. Everyone loved it! I may have used a bit of extra cheese ;), but other than that, I used all ingredients listed and it was great!

It was incredible. The only mistake I made was using cork screw pasta. Should have stuck with the elbows. Dried it out a tad.  But it was easier to follow than I expected. And using what is basically a roux base is genius.

Great variation from store bought high sodium products. Added bacon bits to topping before baking. I made half the recipe with no problem then baked as needed in small stoneware dish.

My Mother shared this one with me as she got rave reviews after making it for family- gave it a shot for a cook-off & I was not disappointed! This doesn’t seem like it would be as creamy & cheesy as it is with just a few cups of cheddar... but it is!! The reason it fell short (and didn’t place) it didn’t have enough flavor. I feel like it needs more salt, as the small portion was not sufficient enough to flavor much, even with the other spices. And I also feel adding some more soft & flavorful cheeses would make it SO much more creamy & distinct. I will probably use more of a variety next time. And, for the next round, I’ll also up the Pandora crust/topping a bit more- it really made the dish & I am impressed with how it has fared for leftovers/reheating! This dish is meant to be consumed immediately- it looses consistency & flavor rapidly the longer it sits. So for reheating- add a Tbsp. of milk, dash of salt & a sprinkle of extra shredded cheese to get that melts, gooey consistency again! I am looking forward to making it again with a few little tweaks!

I chose this recipe because of its rating and was horribly let down. I had all the correct ingredients and followed the recipe to a T. The sauce was grainy and it doesn't need the cayenne pepper, imho. 
But I saw another reviewer say that to not make it grainy, you have to stir in the cheese 1/4 c. at a time. I'll try that next time, along with leaving out the cayenne.

Tried out this recipe just last week trying to get a more interesting dish and my family  LOVED IT!  Made it again the following week due to "crowd pleasing requests" and I traded 1/2 cup milk for 4 oz of cream cheese and doubled recipe for entire box of macaroni.  Whatta  Hit!   Thanks for your guidance on "sprucing up" my dish!

After reading other reviews, I decided to double the sauce for 1 lb. of macaroni. It was very soupy when I added all of it to the 9x13 casserole, but after a night in the fridge, all but the sauce clinging to the pasta had been absorbed.  I didn't actually cook it until 2 days later. by then, more sauce had been absorbed, and when heated, it was still less saucy than a box of Kraft, but a whole lot more flavorful. I was a little concerned about the spices, but it wasn't too spicy for tender palates at all. I really enjoyed it and want to make it again. Thanks, Chef John!

I did make changes, but I'm still giving it 5 stars since it's so adaptable, and so good! I've made this twice so far, one of those times was with a teenager, who said it was the best macaroni and cheese she's ever had.
We changed some of the spices but none of the cooking directions which do work well. I halved the recipe both times I made it. Exchanged one of the pepper spices for Herbs de Provence, omitted the last butter addition, Worchestshire sauce, thyme, and exchanged the Panko crumbs, for my favorite sandwich bread, which I toasted and crushed into crumbs. Most importantly, we added fresh cilantro at the end. This herb was added while we added the cooled cheese sauce to the shells and, after topping the shells and cheese with a coating of shaved Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago (from Trader Joe's), included the cilantro again in the topping of crushed toasted bread (see picture). One more thing: I think the suggested serving size is way off.  I found that halving the recipe easily serves 6 as generously-sized side portions.  Other than this I love checking out Chef John's recipes and highly recommend this!

I made this just as the recipe states. It was very dry and my family did not like the flavor. Maybe it’s just our personal preferences.

Great recipe!  My family thinks 16oz of pasta was a big much; we like it saucier.  Going to try 13oz next time!  Thanks!

I have made this several times and love it. My partner doesn't care for the spices, but I think they are fantastic. I think about 12 ounces of pasta to the sauce is a perfect ratio of sauce to pasta.

After following the recipe exactly the sauce tasted a little flat to me. I added a good handful of grated pecorino romano cheese and it was perfect.

My son and I made this for a family get-together and everyone loved it! We used Cabots Extra Sharp White Cheddar Cheese and a tsp of dry mustard (whisked into the milk mixture)  instead of Dijon. We also chose to leave out the Thyme as it just didn't sound like it was a good fit for us.  It turned out most excellent!!

It was just okay. with the flour, & Panko , made very starchy. I added twice as much Thyme, and used Chipotle pepper. It was still bland. maybe next time I'll try using less flour Panko and put bacon on top.

Great recipe!
I used Gouda and Natural sharp cheddar cheese, with spicy sausage mixed in.
It was a hit. My family and I loved it. I will definitely be making this Mac n Cheese dish again.

My comments need some 'splaining...

I made this dish last night to serve six. Everything went well, until I added the shredded cheddar cheese to the the sauce. The cheese didn't melt! It became a glop at the bottom of the sauce pan. My only though is, I was using a "cheese food" and not real 100% cheddar. I refired the sauce to see if I could get more melt, but, no. No improvement. So I sighed, spread the sauce well in the macaroni, then finished the casserole with the panko and melted butter topping. Into the oven at 400, then onto our dinner table.

It tasted blissful. Best Mac & Cheese I've ever done.

I made this as the recipe called except that I made 1 and 1/2 the amount. I took this to a pot luck and it was a hit! Such great comfort food! I enjoyed the tiny touch of heat from the cayenne. Made it more “ grown up”.

The 2 star is probably my fault because I didn’t follow recipe exactly but I followed all of the suggestions that suggested increasing cheese and milk to 5 cups each and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  MY Mac N Cheese came out dry and flavorless. The topping was very good but I was not impressed with the dish at all.  That said- my husband and son both liked it, but I couldn’t get my grandson to even touch it, he said it didn’t look anything like daycares...which is why I made homemade macncheese to begin with.   This was used as a side dish to salmon patties, which only grandson and husband liked...dinner was a flop.

Excellent basic recipe to start out with.  Tried it as directed the first time to understand the authors intentions.  Loved it!  The cayenne added a smooth and easy after-burn.

Suggestions to readers after trying it as intended...
Taste the cheese sauce before adding to the macaroni and tweak the spices there to your tasting.
The second time around, I changed up the cheeses to my liking.  1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part gouda, 1 part gorgonzola.
For creamier mac n' cheeses, just add extra cheese.

Wow! The best I've ever made! We like it creamy so I used a pound of macaroni and doubled the sauce. This is now my go-to mac n cheese recipe and I'll be playing around with it. Thanks!

Family loves this meal, I fry up and chop 10 strips of bacon and mix it in once the cheese sauce is consistent. Yields 2 meals for a family of 4  and a few lunches for us.

This was excellent. Only change I made was cut the pasta to 12 oz. Kept everything as written. People who are complaining of Thyme must have used powder instead of the dried leaves - use the leaves. Also, don't use pre-shredded cheese. Take the time to shred your own. Makes a huge difference.

I found it to be a little bland, even given the spices added. I also felt it could have had more sauce. However, I will most likely make it again with some adjustments.

This dish is delicious!  I didn't have any red peppers so I doubled the hot mustard ( may have been a little too much) and added about 2/2 c of brie because it needed to be used.  Don't think either really altered the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

I made this exactly by the recipe, to a tee, even set timers where time was specified, in addition to just going by look and feel/textures...  This dish would be more appropriately called by some other name, such as some kind of noodle and savory sauce.

Not too bad. We ate all of it.  But, It needed more sauce with more cheese. It was dry. I would also add more spices.

Ok, but I was not overwhelmed. I used 16 ounces of pasta as stated but I found it to be a bit dry. I wish I viewed Chef Johns video first which explains using less pasta for a creamier (wetter) dish. I subbed a ritz cracker crust otherwise I made as stated. I will continue my quest for the perfect Mac n cheese...this wasn’t it for me.

We really like the recipe, we did 12oz of noodles and thought it was perfect!  Will make it again.  We are not fans of the bread crumbs but did try it this time to keep the recipe original.  Going forward we will make it without the bread crumbs.

I couldnt wait and tasted the sauce before I put it on the noodles.  I think it tastes great and can't wait to take it out of the oven. It smells so good! Will surely make this again.

I made this with a twist.  Instead of using box pasta, we made our own macaroni.   We didn’t change anything on the Chef’s recipe.  Next time we make it we will be adding lobster.  Perfect flavor to go with the sweet meat of lobster.

Delicious, next time I’ll try to follow the recipe!The wife gets the night off each Thursday to relax, go out, whatever she wants.  So naturally, each Thursday afternoon as I’m headed to pickup the girls from school, I remember I’m making dinner and have nothing planned or prepped.  We get home and the girls suggest a box of mac and cheese... Chef John to the rescue!  I pull up the recipe, preheat the oven, and start a pot of water.  No elbow mac, but I have 8oz of Rotini (I guess I’ll try to half the recipe).

Excellent!!! I didn't really change it. I only added more cheese and butter/breadcrumbs. I also went with 8 oz. of macaroni. I put 3 cups of extra sharp cheddar in the sauce and a heaping half cup on top. I also used 2 Tb. of butter and a few more panko.  The spice and flavorings are spot on though! I just want extra, extra cheese!!! Amazing, thanks Chef John!

Great recipe! The addition of the thyme (along with the cayenne & nutmeg) is brilliant. I felt no need to add different cheeses as I often do to get a more complex flavor. The only change I made was to the milk - because I discovered less than 1 cup in the carton! So I added goat milk to level it up to 3 cups. It was delicious. Pretty sure this will be my go-to for pot-luck now!

My 15 yr old daughters favorite.  I prefer my mac and cheese a bit more creamy.  The spices are good, and I have to admit I was a little leary cause they aren't intuitive for a mac and cheese dish.

I doubled the sauce and topping, using 24 ounces of elbow macaroni. I read a ton of reviews but decided to follow the recipe exactly (except for using less pasta). I was concerned about the thyme and cayenne after some of the reviewers’ thoughts. The sauce did have a strong thyme taste (but still yummy) but in the final product the flavor was very mellow, as was the cayenne. It was delicious.

Overall good recipe, but way toooo dry. I've making homemade mac n cheese for over 20 years. This recipe would work if you use 12 oz of mac not 16 ox and a bit more cheese or add more milk and butter to the sauce.

First time ever making baked Macaroni and cheese this way. Used every ingredient that was on the recipe. Omg my Husband and two boys loved it. One of my boys is a picky eater and when he took the first bite his eyes were so wide all I could do was smile. Everyone was so happy. I will tweak it a little for next time. For example I will not add the white pepper for me it had a tinge of a little spicy in it not sure if it was the white pepper or not. All in All yes I will make it again and thinking for the holidays. Thank you  so much for sharing this recipe for others like myself to be able to make.

I followed the instructions with no modifications or additions, and I was underwhelmed with the results. I brought it to our neighborhood block party, and ended up coming home with an almost full pot. I used sharp cheddar for the cheese, and maybe it would have been more flavorful if I used a combination of other cheeses. Oh, well. I'll continue experimenting.

Very good, but it was not a saucy Mac & cheese, so next time I will do what others suggested and either use a 1/4 less noodles or make 1.5 the amount of sauce. I used large shell noodles based on a tip from this site that they hold the sauce better, and I doubled the panko & melted butter for the topping. I think the topping amount in the recipe would not be enough for us, anyway.

So good, with a little kick! It was a little more labor intensive than I thought, but totally worth it. I will definitely make it again!

Definitely felt this was a macaroni you could give guests....  the problem I had is 0 of my 6 begged to have leftovers or more and they LOVE macaroni and cheese.  One said the topping was to DIE FOR (which I doubled as suggested but only used half as indicated but 2 of my kids liked the extra I had to put on their plate)……..but as much as they order macaroni and cheese at 'every single restaurant' …….I can't keep a recipe on file that ONLY got an IT'S ALRIGHT...from the kids.  I used 12oz bag of macaroni and wouldn't change that and left out the cayenne.  I personally liked it and the way it looked, but it just didn't have enough flavor to make you close your eyes and scream for the next bite.

Tasty, tasty. The crust was a hit and the flavour perfection. I did make a bit extra sauce. Great comfort food that even my vegetarians ate and enjoyed.

Absolutely delicious.   I followed the recipe but decided to add 1 tsp of Cayenne as I was worried the dish may be bland.   Also, I   used 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of Gruyere.   It had a little bit of a bite from the Cayenne but was well tolerated by everyone including the kids!!  I will definitely make this again

I love macaroni and cheese; so I find this excellent. I didn't have thyme but oregano worked just as well. I added a bit of garlic as well.

Loved it. It doesn't necessarily reheat well but if you add a bit of milk to it before reheating in the microwave, then mix it in, it comes out pretty good. I followed the directions to the T other than the breadcrumbs and that's just because I didn't feel like doing them. Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

i skipped the bread crumbs, as I prefer my mac and cheese without crunch. This recipe was easy and delicious! I blended the pasta and sauce a little differently: while the pasta drained, I reused the pot to make the sauce. I dumped the pasta back into the pot to make stirring easy, the turned the mixture out into the casserole dish. || My only concern with the recipe is the exorbitant calorie count.  A little  Internet research indicated that the serving is 1 1/3 cups. By reducing my portion size, I was able to fit this dish into my meal plan.

Maybe my family are the only ones that don't like baked macaroni and cheese. The sauce seemed promising (although I wish I would have used all cheddar for a cheesier flavor), but after I baked it for a little less than 20 minutes, it was not creamy at all...almost seemed like the sauce had curdled in the oven. My family politely had one serving each. The rest of it went out to the chickens the next day. I might try it again sometime and just serve it without baking.

Only made it once and I will definitely make it again! The problem with this recipe is that I t's hard to stop eating it! Next time I may use just a little less flour when I make the sauce to make it a little less "solid". I didn't make the topping in order to cut calories and it was very good without it. The cayenne gives it a nice little kick.

Perfect!  Made this for a party and it was a big hit!  Only changes were that we used fusilli instead of elbow mac (I like the way the corkscrews hold onto the cheese) and I put the bread crumb mixture on top, instead of under the cheese, because I like the crunch.  Even my son, who doesn't like mac n cheese, had seconds.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made this recipe as written, except I used whatever shredded cheese I had on hand, rather than just cheddar and I used shells instead of elbow macaroni.  I felt that it was pretty good!  My husband enjoyed it as well.  I agree with someone else that the thyme was a strong flavor, but I don't think it was entirely a bad thing; it gave it a stronger savory flavor that way.  It did not reheat very well, though.  The leftovers turned out to be pretty dry.

The dryness could be that I accidentally over-reduced the sauce, so I'll call user error on that.  If I were to make it again, I'd keep a better eye on that and I think I'd add some protein to it, such as bacon.

READ THE REVIEWS FIRST. I followed the advice of some and used appr 12 Oz of macaroni instead of 16 and it turned out great. I also used a bit less cayenne cause I knew children would be eating it (I used a bit more than half of what the recipe calls for. It was enough to add flavor while keeping it non-spicy). Some commented that thyme is too overpowering - that was not my experience at all. Enjoy! And thanks to the author for the recipe!

Absolutely the best Mac ever! This is my go to recipe and I now make it regularly. You can use whatever mix of cheeses you like best or that is on hand.

This was the best mac n' cheese ever! I took it to a pot luck last night and everyone raved, even 'tho it got overheated in the oven. I doubled the crust topping on my 9 X 13 casserole dish! I did not change a thing, except I did not have  Dijon mustard, so I added 1/4 tsp of dry mustard instead.

Followed the recipe quite good. Did add additional spices to liven it up i.e., garlic powder, onion powder, two pinches of fresh crushed rosemary and finally extra cheese for a creamier consistency. Everyone loved it!

No changes made. Was a little bland for my taste-but the little ones loved it. Could be a little more cheddary.

So good and easy! I used what i had so i didnt have to go to the store, so no nutmeg or thyme and i used chili powder and black pepper but they were fine. So creamy and a little mill when reheating worked great!

Good recipe.  I doubled everything (except the pasta) plus I added shredded parmesan and asiago cheese on top.  Everyone loved it.  I found it a bit dry,  so next time I'll add a little more milk.   It was very helpful to read the comments about taking the roux off the heat and cooling it down before I added the cheese. It was very smooth.  I grated my own cheeses - a combination of sharp cheddar and colby/jack  -because I don't like the additives in already grated cheese.  I also added some dried garlic and onion powder,  as well as the cayenne.

Used all the same proportions of cheese to milk to butter to flour, but substituted types of cheese to what I had on hand (1 c. mozzerela + 2 cups peccornio hard cheese...I prefer "Mexican blend" for mac and cheese). I also used fusili instead of elbows. I should have taken it out of the water after just 5 minutes, not 7 minutes, to ensure al dente pasta after baking. I love the nutmeg...I always put nutmeg in my mac and cheese!

Very good. My preference next time I will only do the panko crumbs on top and not additional cheese. Might have been my cheese but it made kind of a hard crust.

This Mac and cheese was pretty good and didn’t require too much work! I halved the recipe, and the only changes I made was black pepper instead of white pepper and omitted the nutmeg (bc I didn’t have white pepper or nutmeg). My husband and 10 month old both liked it. The only reason I took off a star is, like other reviewers, I wish it had come out a bit more creamy - it was a little dry. Next time I will try using less pasta like others suggested.

Since this was the first time I tried this recipe, I followed  it exactly. The next time I will decrease the amount of pasta (as suggested by another reviewer) to make it creamier. I would also omit the cayenne (just a family preference).

ok so I made this without alot of the spices and such but the flavor was still good. My note to first time makers : DO NOT OVERCOOK YOUR SAUCE! If you overcook it or if the sauce is too hot when you put the cheese in it will/can curdle. So my sauce was chunky not smooth but I will be trying until I get it right!

Delicious. A little dry for my liking but still very very tasty. Followed the recipe using 16 oz pasta, but turned out little dry. Will definitely try again using less pasta next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Made almost as written (unusual for me!), but took  other reviewers' recommendations to use a bit less macaroni.  I also threw in a bit more cheese.  I also worried about the thyme/nutmeg, since I've never used them in my baked mac & cheese before, and I have a 15 year old who is very picky and thinks  frozen Stouffers is the height of mac & cheese, never to be topped by homemade.  She liked this, though - although that may have been because she had a friend over for dinner and would have been embarrassed to say she wasn't eating it in front of her!  I would make this again, even though it's basically what I've always done (but I usually use dry mustard rather than the Dijon.)

My new go-to mac-n-cheese recipe! The trend these days seems to overwhelm the dish with the "creaminess" factor. I was looking for a flavorful mac-n-cheese that is creamy but not overly so. Chef John gives a great explanation of that in the video and tell you how to adjust for your preference. Awesome! I used the whole pound of pasta. Perfect ratio for me. I didn't have any thyme so I just left it out. I used smoked cheddar on the top with the buttered panko crumbs. The cayenne, nutmeg, white pepper, Dijon, etc. all collude to give a subtle complexity to an American standard. Hit it out of the ballpark, Chef John! And thanks for your great video! I get it now.

I made Chef John's mac 'n cheese last night for a large gathering, which meets at our house for dinner every other week.  Instead of the usual compliments, the people started clapping!  One guy especially liked the crispy crust.  Needless to say, there were no leftovers.  When my wife arrived home from work she told me she wanted to have the leftover mac 'n cheese for dinner, and I as much as I hate to disappoint her, I had to tell her that the group ate the whole batch!  She said, "I was thinking about that mac 'n cheese all day!"  Well,  I had enough ingredients to make a half size  amount, which is in the oven as I write this.  I've made lots of versions of macaroni and cheese and this is by far the best!  Once again, thank you Chef John.

Very good recipe. I made the recipe as submitted. I used a grocery store brand of cheese. I think this recipe would benefit from the use of an artisan cheese. I will definitely make it again.

Do not change this recipe only double it. My family loves it and they always preferred Grandma's. Maybe this recipe will be the new family tradition....I am laying claim to it! lol

AMAZING, I made it 2 nights in a row and had it a third night for leftovers! Next time I bake it, will only do for 15 minutes because I felt like 20 dried it out too much. The second night I made it, I only baked it for 5 minutes because I love the taste of the sauce it sits in.

Overall it was pretty good, however I think the seasonings were a bit over powered. After reading other reviews it was most likely the thyme (something I haven't cooked with before) but i did see comments that different types of thyme can have different effects. I plan on trying it again but will most likely reduce the amount of seasonings.

Was not impressed with this one.  Read most of the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I used all the ingredients, but it was pretty bland and dry. Probably won't be making this one again.

I followed the recipe as is and it was a hit. My picky 5 yo had 3 helpings, when she normally doesn't finish the first. I may have added a bit too much dijon, though, the taste does overpower, I noticed it but no one else had any complaints.

It was great!  I used a 13X9 dish and had enough leftover for 2 more meals!  I made it as is, but also added some gooey Muenster cheese. And the top was exactly as Chef John described...beautifully cheesy with a bit

Absolutely loved this Mac and cheese. It came out creamy and cheesey  with a full lb. of elbows. I used 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of gruyere. So so good.

Excellent recipe and as it states, it's old-school just like I want it. I generally leave out the nutmeg and thyme because I never use either of those spices for anything else (those and those evil cloves).  With this recipe you can mix up the cheeses you use as well and get great results. Just make sure you use melty type cheeses or you might get a bit of a grainy texture.

I'm giving this only four stars because, while this is very good mac n cheese, my own recipe is better! :-)
It was good to try a recipe with a slightly different flavor profile than my own. As always, it's hard to go wrong with any recipe from Chef John. This one was no exception.

I always make Mac & Cheese from scratch but tend to "wing it"; this had almost everything I put in with the addition of thyme and since we usually add worcestershire sauce and mustard when we eat it, I realized this would be a winner.  And it was.  The ratio is perfect - thank you, Chef John!

I used dried thyme leaves and baked in 13x9x2 (3qt) casserole. I followed the recipe with the exceptions: Did not have nutmeg.  I doubled the topping (1cup panko, 2TBS melted butter).   I am eating the mac n cheese as I write this review.  The topping is fabulous!   I highly recommend doubling the topping. The flavor of the mac n cheese is spot on!  The reason I give 4 stars is I prefer a more creamy mac n cheese.  The recipe as written is delicious but too dry for my taste.  In fairness, the video does point this out, but, I didn't watch the video until after my 2nd helping.

I used Kirkland TexMex cheese instead of the cheddar and added 1/4 C of Tostitos Salsa con Queso in lieu of 1/2 C of milk in the white sauce (before cheese is added).  If you make it ahead don't add the cheese sauce until you are ready to put it in the oven,  otherwise the cheese will be absorbed into the pasta and make it very dry.

Delicious! I made it with bow-tie pasta because I didn't have elbow macaroni. And I substituted 1/2 cup of parmesan, because I like it.  Even my kids loved it & they are super picky eaters!

Fast, easy, and delicious! Pay attention to how the ingredients are coming together more than the times in the instructions. The flour and butter part was closer to 3 minutes and the sauce thickened in about 5.

The crust was wonderfully crispy and flavourful! The consistency under the crust was creamy and held together nicely. However, I found this recipe to taste rather bland. I would pump up the seasonings and cheese if I were to remake it.

Delicious taste - especially the topping!! I opted to make it with 16 oz. pasta. It was a nice light combination with the sauce. However, I am going to try making it with either 8 oz or 12 oz next time to really experience the flavor of the sauce!

I'm sure this is a lovely recipe . . . I say that because I mistakingly added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg rather than a "pinch".  Other than that it was good! I used a mix of sharp (old) Cheddar and Gouda . . . a nice blend. Will try again!

I made this and altered it a little. It did turn out okay, not great but okay. I will continue to try this recipe out until I've perfected it for my family. I used too many noodles the first time. I'd cut the noodles in half.

I've made this several times and it is very good the way that the recipe is written. I have also modified it a few times with different cheeses, my grandsons prefer it with 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 Colby Jack so it isn't quite as sharp. I also tend to add a bit more salt and mustard and a bit less thyme. Super creamy and works well with any pasta shape I have on hand.

Cooked the recipe as is and found it very bland and not very creamy either.

I was curious how the thyme, nutmeg and Worcestershire would influence the flavor -- positively! Gave it the distinct flavor I've been trying to find in a mac n' cheese recipe for ages. I also like that you can easily fluctuate the cheesiness with this recipe without ruining the balance.

This is a good Mac N Cheese.  Not the best but good.  It is dry but in the video he covers why that is and how to make it not so dry.  Do that and it is amazing!

Accidentally made this with a regular cheddar as opposed to the sharp it calls for. Bland as bland as bland could be. Texture was fine, nice crunch on top but amazing lack of flavor given the ingredients that went into it. Sharp cheddar is a must and I would say up all the spices by 2x.

This is a family favorite, that once made and learned is easy to fix. My son asks for it every Thanksgiving.  There are a few tweaks that have happened over the years. First time out, put in all the spices as directed and all I could taste is the thyme. Now, I leave that out entirely along with the nutmeg and cayenne. I add 1/4 tsp of black pepper. 
When I want to make an extra creamy batch, I up the butter/flour to 1/2 cup and the milk/cheese to 4 cups. Then double the crust toppings. Bake time is still the same.

This recipe is horrible.  Super bland with an overly crisp crust.  I made it for Thanksgiving Dinner and I regret it.  It was not cheesy enough, it had no flavor, the spices and mustard and etc. all added up to nothing.  I will not make this again.  Find something with actual flavor - a simple box mix still have more complex flavor than this recipe.  Save your time and effort.

Looks beautiful. Left out the thyme, based on other reviews. I think the sharp cheese was not a fit for my family. I enjoyed it but they were looking for a more mellow cheese experience, I guess. Next time I will select a cheese that is softer and more mild. But, overall a winner!

The flavor was really, really good. That much was agreed upon at Thanksgiving this year. But it was dryer than ideal- should have been more moist. Not sure where the good was. I followed the recipe exactly. I did cook longer because the crust was not browned AT ALL at the 20 min mark and still looked “raw”... that 10 mins could have contributed to the dryness... but then what about the white crumbs on top? Worth trying again to perfect!

I make this exactly as directed, no substitutes except black pepper for white (it's what I had on hand). This dish is loved by all, from the toddler to the dad. I just wish it was as good on the second day.

I make this using shells instead of macaroni noodles, and instead of bread crumbs I use Pepperidge Farms stuffing cubes soaked in melted butter. I use a shredded Havarti, Gouda, and white cheddar mixture instead of plain cheddar and my family loves this!

I took the recipe for Chef Jonh’s Macaroni and Cheese out of the oven.  Not only does it look beautiful, I must confess I tasted it  while I was making  the cheese sauce, it tastes as good as it looks!  The cheese sauce is extremely easy to make and it takes no time at all to bake which makes it an easy week time to create.

I’ve made a number of Chef John’s recipes and every time they turn out great!  Thank you Chef John!!

We made this mac & cheese yesterday  (October 24, 2017) according to Chef John's video/recipe.  This is the best we have ever made and will continue to utilize this recipe.  The only change we made was using 12 oz. macaroni instead of 1 lb. - which Chef John suggested for a "cheesier" casserole.  Can't say enough about this dish!  Definitely a keeper in our house.

I use this recipe for the sauce, and then pour that over whatever pasta I happen to have on hand. It's so good, and highly addictive.  I never have thyme or nutmeg on hand, so I've never included it, and I don't feel it is missing anything.

I had some different cheeses leftover from my daughter's engagement party, and since I don't eat cheese (plain) myself and didn't want to go to waste, I improvised!  I used blue stilton, mild gruyere, smoked pepper jack, and black pepper cheese (a cheddar I think).  this was my first time making homemade mac 'n cheese, so skipped the extra seasonings as I thought the cheese flavors would stand on their own.  and they did!  I followed Chef John's recommendation for the crunchy topping, left it in the oven about 25 minutes and it was delicious!

It could be that the results of this recipe vary widely because Chef John has presented three definately different alternatives to the recipe. One pound of macaroni yields a full 3-qt. casserole (10"x10" or 9"x13") . I made this with the 16 oz. mac, and thought it was a bit dry. Half the cayenne provided a pleasantly mild punch for my taste. I thought the small amounts of thyme, worcestershire and prepared mustard would be too mild in such a large casserole, but they all seemed to mesh into a savory goodness. I'll make this again with a higher proportion of sauce.  Two adults and three children ate half the casserole for lunch.  I'll be making a small batch of sauce to serve the leftovers.

Best Mac and Cheese I have ever made.  Followed recipe exactly except left off the crumb topping because no one I was cooking for likes it.  Next time I may add some pepper jack to spice it up a little more.  I made this during Hurricane Irma's raging winds and it was great comfort food!!!

I did what others suggested in that I used about 12 oz macaroni  which made it creamier and doubled the panko for extra crunch.  Everyone raved about it!  They said it was so flavorful and loved the crunch of the breadcrumbs on top.  Will make again for sure.

I made this exactly as written except I only had a 12oz package of pasta. The kids loved the crunchy topping and everyone enjoyed the entire dish. This will be my new goto Mac and cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe Chef John!

The sauce was nice and tasty and the butter added to panko made the top crisp up lovely

I made recipe as written minus Worcestershire which we were out of. The cayenne made this too spicy for my 2.5 year old. I would say if you are serving this to kids, go with a pinch of cayenne and no more than that. I've made it without the cayenne and found it bland and lacking something. The cayenne gave it a kick which is fine for adults but not most kids. I have three of them and I'll see if the 12 year old and the 15 year old will eat this...

Delicious! Use dry mustard instead and 1/2 of the cayenne and less noodles like the others suggested to make it creamier. Doubled the panko and butter too. It’s  definitely the best mac & cheese! Everyone loves it.

I loved it, I know for me a bit of thyme goes a long way so I cut that in half knowing I would not like it unless I did. It worked out great because I loved it. However I had my fussy grand kids over and they were not too fond of it. They are used to the boxed stuff. So the comments from them were it's too spicy, whats that crusty stuff on top and I don't like it was said just from looking at it. I made them try it, still no go. I used 12 oz or elbows I will make it again. If I make for the grandkids I won't use thyme or cayenne and I won't put on the crumbs (crusty stuff). I think then they will like it. But when it's for me or other adults I'll do like I did this time, just cutting the thyme a bit.

Amazing, wonderful, beautiful! I changed a couple of things for personal preferences - Used 12oz of macaroni. I'm not a fan of herbs so I omitted the thyme. Didn't have any Worcester sauce in so instead added 1/2 teaspoon of both garlic granules and onion powder. Doubled the cayenne & added white AND black pepper. The nutmeg gave it an extra dimension which we loved. I also added 3 American cheese slices with the cheddar at the end.
Made 50% more topping & added garlic granules to the panko. 
Simply sublime. Easily one of the best macaroni cheese recipes I've tasted. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks Chef John :)

I made this as written except I left out the thyme and I used large elbows.  It turned out dryer and thicker than what we like. The recipe doesn't specify and those are what I had. It also did not specify to rinse the pasta either so I didn't.  Next time I will use less pasta and add another sharper cheese to brighten it up as it was a little on the bland side. The tsp. of Dijon mustard and Worcestershire really didn't do the job. I'll add either yellow mustard or dry mustard to the sauce next time.

This was one of the few recipes that people didn't change it. Which is a huge compliment! I don't like mac n' cheese ( I know... but I wasn't raised with it and so never liked it). But I loved this! It had a very light flavor. Mild but tasty. I had to double the crust (just wasn't enough) and served it with kielbasa. Why? Why not!

My kids love this. I do make extra crumb topping and put it on top of the grated cheese to keep it from sinking in to the sauce, but other than that I'm pretty true to the recipe. Also, add fresh shrimp or scallops when combining the cheese sauce to the noodles before baking - super yum!

I never write reviews but this was what I have been searching for for my family and I had to share! I listened to the reviews and because of my kids cut back on all spices. I also changed from sharp to mild cheddar cheese. I only had skim milk on hand so I used it and my Panko was seasoned. My 9 year old son tasted it first.  He said it was "magical".  We all agreed.

This is one of the best mac and cheese recipes I have ever made. For some reason my in-laws and I have heard other people add chopped tomatoes to their recipe. I have made Chef John's (less thyme) with and without the tomatoes. It is excellent both ways. As an added bonus I have added real bacon bits in and on top ! One of my grandson's favorites.

I made extra cheese sauce (1.5 of the recipe with the spices doubled except for the cayenne and I Omitted the thyme) and the full 16 ounces of the elbow macaroni. I also doubled the Panco bread crumbs for the topping and used extra cheese slices for the middle and top layer. Several people want me to give them the recipe. It was delicious!

Excellent Mac&Cheese recipe.  Simple, easy and delicious.
First time I followed exact recipe.  Second time I left out the cayenne and used penne ( out of traditional elbow)  added 1/2
tsp. sweet paprika to the panko topping (for a little more appeal)  This recipe will probably become the family favourite.
Thank you CJ for another practical, delicious traditional recipe

Finally a creamy cheesy baked mac n cheese! I have tried many times to attemp this dish.... which should be simple, but always ends up dry.  I made exactly as directed, however I did reduce the macaroni to 8 oz. and added only 1/2 tsp of salt. Oh and I used a mixture of old cheddar, Monterey Jack and Gouda instead of all cheddar.
I watched the video where he says to reduce the amount of pasta based on how creamy you want it. It was perfect. My search for the perfect creamy baked mac n cheese is officially over.  Thanks Chef John

This is the taste I've been attempting to find since I was a kid!!! I had a macaroni and cheese in a hospital years ago that I could find or replicate the taste. Yes, I said hospital food. It was surprisingly good. These ingredients going in, in the order makes all the difference. I do not recommend any changes, I just personally didn't have macaroni and really didn't want to go to the store for just that, so I used some tri colored Penne I had and it was just as good.

Made the recipe as written.  I was worried my party guests would expect a mac n cheese with more variety of cheeses but they all loved it and said they were so glad that I stuck with an "old school" mac n cheese.  No leftovers so that tells me it was a hit!

I made this for 8 servings instead of 6. The only recommendation I would make is to make more sauce by maybe 1/3 just because it was a little dry and I like my mac and cheese creamier. Overall, really easy to make, really good!

My husband made this and we didn't like it. It reminded me of something served in my school cafeteria in the 80's. Flavorless, bland and provoked the "blue box blues" in me. I, too, thought we did something wrong due to all the high reviews for this dish. We made it exactly as written, will not make again.

I wasn't a huge fan of this pasta. I cook a lot, and have a passion for food... and this recipe could use a lot of tweaking. I followed it to the t and thought there was a strange taste in the sauce part of it. Also, I felt like it needs a lot more than just 1/4tsp of salt. I loved the bread crumb part, it was the best. The inside could've had 3.5 stars if there was more salt I think

Followed the recipe exactly; rave reviews. I do think it's more like eight servings rather than six which works fine for my husband who takes leftovers for lunch. Will definately make again and again.

Made it twice in a week... once for my wife and I and once (made-ahead/baked day-of) for an extended family potluck.  Both meals went over really well with rave reviews.
I added diced ham when mixing at the end before baking.

Based on what I had at home I did several substitutions:
I used regular pepper instead of white pepper.
I used Sour Cream & Water for one batch instead of milk (worked just fine - Worcestershire makes it a slight sour/tart flavor anyway).
I used Mozza/Cheddar mix based on the cheeses I had available.
Forgot mustard both times.
Accidentally put crumbs on top of cheese topping and worked great (instead of vice-versa in directions).

It was a very forgiving recipe - all my variety of alterations still tasted great both times.

OMG, this is the best mac and cheese that I've ever tasted. My son begs me to make it and it's gone by the next day. It's absolutely addictive! The cayenne adds a wonderful kick, which is a great touch, and the panko bread crumbs with the cheese on top adds a perfect crunchy topping. The only thing I change is: double the panko bread crumbs and I make sure all the ingredients are organic. Chef John-you are a food alchemy genius!

Have  made this twice already. I followed the recipe, and what I found the easy thing to do was to prep all of my ingredients  before I started cooking. I cook the pasta, drained it in the sink and while it was drained I started prepping the sauce. I placed the pasta into a 13 x 9  Glass dish. The only change I made was I added extra cheddar cheese on top before baking. This gave it a really nice crispy top crust.

I was just okay. I had to add more of the same spices, as it was very bland. In the recipes defense, I did quadruple the recipe.

Fabulous! Creamy mac and cheese, but with a bit of a spicy kick to it. The cayenne powder I would guess. I'm not much of a fan of spicy food, but the kick in this is wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and there's nothing I would change. Oh, I wrecked the first pot of pasta which was the only elbow pasta I had so I threw it out  and made it with Penne Rigate (?!) cuz it was in my cupboard. It  worked so well; I think I would use that again instead of elbow pasta. Thank you Chef John! I always like your recipes!

I have made this so many times, now!  It's absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, except, I cook the cheese sauce in a double boiler (fear of scalding milk).  I am currently making a double batch to take to a family get together. Every time I do this, it is always eaten until it's gone.

Texture is very good but it lacked either the creamy goodness I like in a mac 'n' cheese or a strong savory flavor I'd like if missing the creaminess.

Made this for my grandson's birthday party.  I don't have a lot of experience with making mac and cheese and this looked like a promising recipe!  As others recommended, I doubled the roux and other ingredients, used half evaporated milk and half whole milk, and decided to leave out the cayenne and thyme because of the number of little kids at the party.  I probably doubled the amount of Dijon mustard and Worcestshire and It had a great flavor, got a lot of positive comments.  It was a little drier than I had hoped even though I did add a little of the noodle water to the casserole dish.  I think next time I will cool the noodles first, then add a more generous amount of sauce.

So I have a cousin who used yo baby sit me when I was young loved mac n cheese and made it all the time. Once I was able to cook  we had "Mac offs" lol, I always made it from scratch. 

I made this twice the first time I followed the recipe and It was good. This time I added 1 tablespoon of greek yogurt with the butter and flour for the sauce base. Then I also added a little mozzarella cheese and........my secret a little bit of blue cheese, but I mean very little, I always add to taste, the second you think you taste the blue cheese stop, it is meant to give it a much richer flavor. I learned this from a 5 Star Chef.

So many Mac and Cheese recipes pile on cheese after cheese but forget to do what Chef John does here...create a great Béchamel sauce. This is the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had.  The amount of thyme used here really is quite small - if you foud it overpowering, you added too much. I never would have thought of adding it, it works!

Used extra cheese and about a half pound of macaroni. Creamy, cheesy, yummy. Used a little more white pepper by accident - not quite a quarter tsp rather than the eighth called for- so it was a bit spicier than we expected from mac&cheese, but we liked it. I think next time I'll  probably use "too much" pepper again??

This macaroni and cheese was a little too tangy and dry for my taste. I think next time I will omit the Dijon mustard, double the sauce and add some garlic and stewed tomatoes instead.

Always a little scary taking a dish I've never made to a party, but no need to be scared with this one.  It was a huge hit.  Got rave reviews.  My dish was practically licked clean when I left the party.  I took some suggestions and doubled the sauce and topping, omitted the thyme.  I also finely crumbled some tortilla chips in the bottom.  Also added the jalapenos.  Mmmmm!!!  So delicious.  I was planning to add sliced avocados on the top, but got busy visiting and forgot, haha.  But I think it would be a great addition.

Really , really delicious. It's got a whole different flavor and texture happening.  " YUMMY"
But way more time consuming than mac&cheese should ever be(for me anyway).
But definitely worth a try!

Liked it... added onion and garlic powder. Used some reduced fat and fat free cheese to cut the calories. Next time will probably cut the macaroni in half to make it creamier. Good base recipe and pretty easy.

This for me, was a good base recipe.  I cut recipe in half for hubby and myself and still had two good sized leftover portions.
Sorry, Chef John, but I changed the spices on this recipe for my liking.
1/2 tsp onion powder,
1/2 tsp garlic powder,
1/2  tsp salt,
1/2 tsp black pepper and
1/8 tsp worcestershire sauce

I also doubled up panko crumbs and melted butter mixture for top because I like a good crunch in every bite!

This is a good recipe but I prefer Mouse's Mac and Cheese because it's creamier. I combine the 2 by adding seasonings and technique from this recipe but 1/2 c. butter and 4 c. milk per the other recipe.

My 15-year-old daughter made this and it was amazing! It's a classic comfort food and this recipe was perfect. She's a new cook so she followed the recipe exactly and it didn't disappoint.

This dish is always a hit.  It takes a bit of time but worth it.   The secret is in the cheese sauce, I add a bit of smoked cheddar and it's fantastic.

This is a good, nicely flavored macaroni and cheese.  Chef John is a favorite and this is a solid recipe; the cayenne pepper provided a subtle bite and thyme is also subtle but nice.  My only negative is that the dish was less saucy than expected; when I next make, I will increase the amount of sauce.  Overall, another winner from Chef John.

Turned out really good! I used ritz cracker crumbs instead of Panko bread crumbs and it didn't seem to hurt anything. I only used a little thyme because I saw people didn't like it. I do like Mac n cheese where it just strings between your mouth, fork, and plate, but this did not do that. Still tasted great!

I typically use Martha Stewart Mac and Cheese 101 recipe but did not have all the fancy cheese on hand so I tried this.  It's very good but the 'fancy cheese' makes a better dish.

Followed the directions as written. Used sharp cheddar in the sauce and some mozzarella for the topping. Subbed Italiano spices for the thyme.

Sorry, this didn't hit the spot with my family.  Made the recipe to the letter.  The cayenne pepper to us was odd and didn't belong and we found the mac 'n cheese not very flavorful.

I followed the basic premises of the recipe. I had a party that I had about 12 different cheeses for, so I had to use them up LOL!
I did omit the thyme as I figured it would over-power the nuances of the cheese. I did add a pinch of garlic & onion powders...

Didn't change anything except used less of the cayenne and white pepper since I had to also please an 8 year old who is a mac and cheese snob...it didn't pass his "I just like plan ole mac and cheese" requirement, but the rest of the family loved it.  Next time I do want to try mixing up a few different cheeses and adding the peppers in..was thinking of putting in a sauteed jalepeno as well. But, as is, this recipe was really good..only reason I gave it 4 stars is it may not pass the taste test for someone used to old fashioned mac and cheese.

There is not much you can do to improve on this.  Use it and you cant go wrong.  I did use a little less Macaroni than the full 16 ounces because I like cheesy.  Here's one that can be safely handed down forever.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I make a few changes for my taste, but the instructions are easy to follow and it always comes out perfect!  My favorite addition is Truffle oil!  It gives this comfort food a gourmet touch that always has my guests raving!  TIP:  This tastes amazing right out of the gate, but when I make the sauce the day before, the flavors really settle in and that is my favorite way to eat it!

Very good!  Made without the cayenne due to spice-sensitive guests and I forgot the dijon but it came out very good and creamy!

I'll use this recipe as a nice base, but it needs more flavor. I'll add more cayenne,  some onion flakes and more cheese to the base for some added punch. I'll also make more sauce (double it). The top was dried out after needing 25 minutes to cook. I'd add foil to the top for 15 of those minutes.

May be the best I've tried.  Added diced fire roasted red peppers that added nice flavor and a bit of color. Yum.

This was good but I think it needed more cheese.  I made it exactly as written and thought it was really good but when I reheated it I added more cheese with it and it made it great.  So from now on I think I will add more cheese.

I made a double batch of this super creamy Mac 'n' Cheese dish. I really like that it is made almost as a one pot dish. (you still have to boil the macaroni) I made one single change and that was to sub ground mustard for the Dijon. This a beyond being a comfort food! It's just awesome!

I put extra cheese into mine because it was for Thanksgiving, and that's what you do. It was delicious before even putting it into the oven. I might just leave it right like that next time, when it's all gooey and yummy. The topping turned out weird. I think you really should mix the cheese and the panko breadcrumbs, because the cheese just sort of melted on top and then re-solidified. Otherwise very tasty!

Didnt like this as much as I thought we would.  I usually make "chuck's mac and cheese" from this website.  And after 25 people tasting this recipe in comparison, everyone liked chucks mac and cheese better.  Every single person.  I left out the thyme because i hate thyme, and the other spices and flavors were just weird.  The consistency of the sauce was also sort of thick and grainy.  I wouldn't make this again.  Make Chuck's mac and cheese if you like the old fashioned REAL  kind, or "Mouse's mac and cheese" from this website if you like the real creamy, velveeta kind.  Both are better recipes than this.

Delicious! I used Tex Mex shredded cheese instead and added cubed smoked ham. I can think of a few variations such as pancetta and a mix of italian cheeses for one. Possibilities are endless.

Loved this recipe. Tweaked it a little-halved the chili powder so it wouldn't be too spicy and added some xtra bread crumbs on the top before baking it. I thought the mac and cheese had a slight funny after taste, maybe the  worcestershire  sauce or the dijon mustard, maybe one of the spices? Either way, the recipe got rave reviews from everyone!

I've been looking for a really good Baked mac n cheese and this recipe is it!  It is worth all the extra effort to make the cheese sauce.  The cayenne and dijon mustard give the sauce a nice kick.  It makes a generous casserole and would be a great potluck dish.

I made this today but followed the suggestion of using less macaroni and doubling the Panko. The flavor was great and the crust was even better. However, I still did not find the dish to be as cheesy and I expected. It was slightly dry in my opinion whereas I thought it would be creamy and cheesy. I plan to try the dish again and this time I think I'll add more cheese mix or use even less macaroni

DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe, only changing a couple things based on reviews from others.  I only cooked 12 oz. of pasta and doubled the spices & the panko/butter topping.  It was great!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I opted for less pasta and put in broccoli.. it was really good. My husband loved the topping. I loved reading the reviews about the grainy texture of the cheese sauce (after I had already screwed up and made grainy sauce). Everything still tasted great.. will definitely be making this again!

Coming off the stove the roux and macaroni stirred together were tasty as I had anticipated, but the 20 minutes in the oven dried it out to the point the pasta had no taste other than the breadcrumb topping. If I choose. To try again someday, I'll skip the topping and serve it immediately after combining the sauce.

So easy to make! The Thyme was an interesting addition which  I didn't quite enjoy it at first, but it is growing on me.  By the way, this recipe says it makes six servings. I don't know how much you eat in a serving but for me a serving is the size of my fist and that makes it about 24 servings.  Be prepared to store some in the freezer if you don't have big eaters in your house.

I was skepticalabout adding dried thyme to a mac n cheese dish and the minute I added it I so wish I hadn't. I served this dish to my family ranting and raven about how good home made baked mac n cheese is and well everyone of us took 1  bite and spit it back out into the plate. Thyme was so over powering that thats all you taste. I will try this dish one more time but this time the dried thyme will not see the light of day.

The crust was amazing. I left out the thyme and white pepper and it came out a little bland. I'll have to try it with all the ingredients next time.

Update: Avoid the thyme. It is gross. It's okay to substitute the white pepper with black pepper.

I have made this several times. It is absolutely delicious. My favorite way to make it is to add some fresh mixed garlic with the Thyme and cayenne and to use Cabot Seriously Sharp  white cheddar. I also add 1 pound of chicken or sausage depending on my mood, what I have on hand.

Excellent. The only changes I made were that I used 1 cup each of three different cheeses, and put the finished dish under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end.  I've experimented using Swiss, Emmentaler, medium and old cheddar, Gruyere,  Monteray Jack, and Mont Amoré cheeses. Any combinations of these work well together. Do not use a marble cheddar, however, as it is too stringy when melted.

I'm surprised because I love everything Chef John does----this is only one of two that I'm not crazy about. I think part of problem is that I used 1lb of macaroni instead of 8 oz. ---that's my bad, not his. If you do that, I would double the sauce---it was way to dry. Again, my fault. But the sauce itself was not great...even with the cayenne and nutmeg, I'm not impressed. I probably might try again w/ some additions because I'm a huge Chef John fan and I'm sure it's a good foundation for a recipe. I'll let you know how it goes...

Macaroni and Cheese has always been one of my favorite dishes since childhood.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The pepper jack cheese added a little more flavor to it.  Wonderful addition to the recipe.

I used 13 oz of elbow macaroni hoping for a cheesier mac 'n cheese but found it was still a bit dry for our tastes.  That being said the quality of flavours outweighed it being slightly dry.  Next time I will cut back on the macaroni a bit more and use regular macaroni instead of high fiber -- I can't help but wonder if using the high fiber macaroni contributed to it being a bit dry.  I made the recipe exactly as written and would recommend it.

This isn't your typical macaroni and cheese because of the addition of  thyme, but it's very good.  There was just a little too much cayenne pepper  for me, but  that's just my personal taste.  Be careful with the nutmeg--you don't want too much.  Nice crunch to the topping.  Next time I may take other reviewers suggestions and decrease the pasta for  a more saucy dish.

Loved it! I reduced macaroni to 12 oz and it was the perfect amount. I was hesitant to put in the 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper because my mom doesn't like spicy. Next time, I'm going to put in the full amount as I couldn't taste it at all. A delicious dish and so easy to prepare. Thank you for the recipe!

Solid, solid mac n cheese recipe. Best tip I read to keep it creamy was to use room temperature/cool cooked pasta.It worked.I also cut down some of the cheese just to save some calories/fat. Solid recipe and great use of spices. (BTW, I lucked out on 8 oz. of gouda chipotle cheese for $1.99 at the store today, which made for a great flavor.)

Made this today and all of it was gone by the end of dinner.  I did not have any thyme so i didn't put that in but i added a little extra of the cayenne pepper.  Instead of the elbow noodles I used the extra wide egg noodles and cut up hot dogs in it. It was not bland at all, my new recipe for mac and cheese, thank you chef john

I made the recipe exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it. With the cayenne pepper in it, it had just a little bite to it which we loved! I will definitely make this again. It's not a difficult recipe to follow and I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for a party and it turned out get. The only modification I did was I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a 1/4 c of velveeta cheese. Adults and kids all loved.

Really authentic macaroni and cheese dish. Very easy to prepare. Next time I would use a little less cayene pepper.

I used mostly sharp cheddar, but it's us great with a little gouda and gruyere cheeses added in. Use 16 oz (4 cups) of pasta.   Broil for a few minutes at the end to make the topping crispy.

This is an excellent recipe, it's pretty much the way I make it, with a couple of changes.  I didnot use Thyme or Nutmeg. I used black and white pepper (occasionally I've added parsley and onion - because that.s the way my family likes it once in awhile) , I use shredded cheddar and other cheese mixes, I also hold aside sliced and/or cubed cheese.  Once the pasta and creamy cheese is mixed and ready for the pan - I layer with the sliced and/or cubed cheese.  I also use shells or rotini, they grab the cheese better.  Frequently my family asks that I use pepper jack for the between layers.  Don't limit your self with your cheese choices, cheddar isnt the only one out there.  Panko is a GREAT idea,,

Great recipe; made it twice. Suggestion: use 12 oz.  macaroni, and sharper cheese is better.

I made this for a potluck today, there were two other macaroni and cheese dishes also, everybody was asking who made this particular one :) I was so happy to share where I found it. Forgot to take a picture though.

Perfect! Used  a whole 16oz. box of elbow noodles; dash of hot sauce(didn't have cayenne), didn't use Thyme either. Everything else stayed as written, baked in a 9x13 baking dish, cheese sauce came excellent with a touch of 'spicy'! Love the consistency; exactly what we look for in our baked mac & cheese! Good idea to watch the  video. Thanks Thomas Jefferson AND Chef John! I'm serving it w/your meatloaf!!!

Very good crunchy crust and smooth texture below. I followed the recipe exactly except cut quantities in half. Still had four ample servings.

Definitely the best one I've made. I might need to play with the recipe a little though. The flavour of the sauce could have been cheesier.

I was looking for a new twist on mac and cheese, and this was it - dinner guests loved it! The nutmeg, Dijon, and Worcestershire gave it a really unique  and unexpected flavor. It did get a little dry after resting for about 30 minutes, so I recommend serving immediately, or increasing the quantity of the white sauce a little.  I was also liberal with the Worcestershire which only made it better.  This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you Chef John.

Oh so delicious! I think it's pretty hard to mess up homemade mac and cheese, but this definitely was a notch above the usual. I watched the video and he puts the cheese layer under the panko, but the recipe says to put it on top. I will definitely follow the video instructions every time. I'm not sure how the bread crumbs would have crisped if they were under cheese. I followed the recipe exactly and it feeds a TON of people. I would say it easily makes 12-15 servings if used as a side dish. The seasonings were perfect, just enough heat from the cayenne and the rest blends beautifully. I thought it was plenty cheesy with the full box of pasta. Also in the video he suggests using some Gouda cheese with it, will try that next time. Definitely a keeper!

i like a really creamy and saucy mac & cheese.  The only changes that I made was to add small pieces of ham and peppers.  My husband wants meat at almost all meals.  It was very good, the top crust was excellent.  will make again.

Very good recipe.  I was trying to find a recipe for Mission BBQ's mac and cheese recipe and decided to give this recipe a shot.  I'm glad I did.  My family, which includes two little girls who can be picky, all liked it.  Of course I added some strips of pre cooked pepper bacon on the top that added to the flavor because...well who doesn't like bacon!?!?  Definitely a do again meal.

I've been making mac & cheese from a box for 40 years so was looking for a good recipe for homemade. I must say I wasn't crazy about the thyme in this and the other seasonings weren't enough to even taste but it is a good basic recipe.

It was okay, maybe because it lacked the oomph that I was looking for.  Maybe extra extra higher quality sharp cheddar next time, as the basic recipe is great.  The best part was the crunch on top.  I will make again but this time use half cream, half milk and bump up the cheese to firm it up a bit.

I made this exactly as written.  It was good but I liked it more when it got cold.  I did as directed (dont' need to grease the pan, it won't stick) but it stuck really bad to the pan.  I had to scrape, soak overnight, scrape again, and scrub.

Such an awesome dish; easy to make, great texture, a long lasting taste. Just for a little bit of aroma, I placed some rosemary leaves on the surface to make the aroma long lasting as well. Next time I'll mix Swiss cheese and Cheddar together. Bon Appetit :)

Don't be mad but I did not use the thyme or nutmeg, way too scared of that with the kids eating it!  Other than that, everything was exactly the same but did double it (made a ton!).  Very flavorful but a tad dry for my taste, next time I will make less pasta.

I made this EXACTLY as written, and it was absolutely delicious and different from the all-the-same mac and cheese recipes we usually see. Even my 2 year old grandson scarfed it down! Next time I make it, I think I will cut down just a bit on the thyme (just as a personal preference). Don't hesitate to try this one.

I used 1 lb Barilla's elbows and 1 1/2 times recipe.  Perfect combo.  Fit perfectly in 13 x 9 pan.  Did not add worcestershire nor thyme.  Used spicy brown mustard, fresh nutmeg.  Would like to add fresh tomatoes next time.  Made this at work and was a bit hit!

Totally enjoyed this recipe. My macaroni had more flavor than ever before. My children loved it. In the future I will probably use a very small amount of thyme, if any at all.

I followed the recipe as is but felt like I should have either done more cheese sauce or less noodles. They seemed too dry but the flavor was good. I'll likely try a different recipe the next time I want mac and cheese.

I doubled the recipe because I was feeding a large crowd! It was a crowd pleaser! I would recommend using less noodles then the original recipe calls for due to it gets a little dry. I  highly recommend this dish as a main course or a side dish. 

To make it a full meal I used chicken to go along with it.

This was the best mac  and cheese recipe I have ever used!  I did not have nutmeg nor the white pepper, but it turned out delicious  anyway.  I put the catsup bottle on for my husband  and he did not need it!  He said it is definitely  a do again.  Thanks  Chef!

I didn't change anything but I left it in the oven too long which dried it out, my bad. So learn from me and just leave it in the oven long enough for the cheese to melt and the bread crumbs to slightly brown!

I used 12 oz of pasta. This was by far the best ratio of pasta to cheese sauce I have made. I didn't love the mustard but my family thought it was great! The crunchy top with the panko was amazing.

Triple Yum! With only minor changes, this is our new "go-to" m&c.  Totally beneficial to take the time to watch the video (thanks, nmccormack for the nudge to do so), which convinced me to use only 12 ounces of pasta. Sauteed finely diced red and green peppers and green onion tips & added to cheese sauce b4 pouring over pasta. Forgot to use mustard, but still really delish....will remember for next batch. This recipe has a nice kick, lots of flavor and is flexible to personal fave add-ins. Used sharp cheddar and grated Mexican blend. Will experiment with diff cheeses also. And maybe lightly sauteed baby spinach and ........

I've made this many times and it's always a hit with family and friends. I double the amount of cayenne, which tastes great but is still not overpowering. I've had many friends ask for the recipe, which I'm happy to give.

My husband and I love this recipe. I did add only 12 oz of pasta, which if you listen to the video- he discusses this. Also listen to his Lobster Mac N Cheese video, good tips given. The flavors were very good, I had to use spicy brown mustard. And I usually add more cheese and use a XXXX cheddar from a local cheese shop. Excellent,  the quality of your cheese will make a difference. Does not come out liquid like box cheeses; we prefer this.

Delicious!  I made the full sauce amount, but used slightly less pasta (maybe 3/4 of what was called for).  I used up some smoked Gouda for about 1/2 cup of the cheese, then the rest was cheddar.  Added some parmesan to the topping.  I think next time I will add a little finely minced onion but this was delicious as is.

My  husband loved this! Since it's just the two of us, I halved the recipe to 3 servings and just baked in a 6-cup pyrex dish and it turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe to a T, except I didn't have enough butter to moisten the panko with, so I just mixed the bread crumbs with the remaining cheese and it came out fine. (I used 1/3 shredded mozzarella and 2/3 sharp cheddar)

I do think this recipe is a gourmet version of a family classic that is catered to adult palettes. I think when our dinner table involves little kiddos I'd maybe adjust the spices down a lot and give my spicy-loving hubby a bottle of hot sauce.

The flavor in this was really good! The texture was a bit grainy - I think it could do with about half as much flour.

For lack of four and a half stars, here are five instead. I really liked this and so did my family. 

Anyway, I did not have any white pepper, so I used regular pepper. Also, I made this as double batch because I need to use up a block of white sharp cheddar. I sliced the block very thin instead of shredding it, and probably added just a smidge extra to not waste any cheese I had on hand. I also accidentally added the nutmeg to the thyme and cayenne spice mixture; ergo, I added all those spices at once instead of holding the nutmeg back with the salt. (I do not think that really affected the taste, however.

 I overcooked my noodles, but it still turned out nicely creamy and rather tasty.  A really ice combination of flavors, along with that perfect crust  make this recipe a keeper. 

Next time, I will just add a bit more salt.  

Thank you for posting this recipe.

Done searching for the perfect Mac N Cheese recipe. Used all ingredients listed....decreased pasta to 12 oz...Used  heaping cups of cheddar, sharp white cheddar and smoked gouda and used all cheese in the sauce.  I used I cup milk and 2 cups heavy cream.  We like spice so increased the white pepper to 1/2 tsp.  2 tbs of Worcestershire and 2 tbs dijon. Very creamy and delicious with just a bit of a kick.

Best recipe I have ever made! Pasta to sauce ratio is spot on so it does not get too dry and congealed when baked. I did add come chopped onion and garlic to the butter when making the sauce because well...I love onions and garlic. But I think it would be just as fantastic without. I also added a big ol' dollop of Cheese whiz and sprinkled with chopped jalapeno....again, for personal indulgences. :) My boyfriend and I ate half of it ourselves and probably could have eaten the whole thing! Not that we needed to. Will be saving this one for years to come!

I found the creaminess good (I did cool the macaroni at room temperature before combining it with the hot sauce) but I did not enjoy the taste of thyme.  I added the specified amount and it is amazing that such a small amount really changed the taste.  Might try the recipe again without the thyme, but a baked recipe I have used as my previous 'go to' that mixed the ingredients in the casserole without making the white sauce/cheese sauce first on the stove is just as good--and a lot less effort.

I added 1/2 pound of smoked gouda cheese and it was awesome.  There is a little spice to this because of the pepper.  If you are serving this to someone who doesn't like spices, you may want to reduce or eliminate the pepper.

It is very good for home-style macaroni and cheese.  I was just hoping for the sauce to be creamier.  I think perhaps it might need a bit more milk for the amount of cheese that was added.   The flavor it self was excellent.  The consistency needs minor tweaks.   I made the recipe was it was written.

Great flavor but too much pasta for the amount of sauce.  Would try it again with less pasta (1/2 box).

If you are looking for traditional mac and cheese, this recipe is NOT for you. It includes ingredients that give quite a bite to the flavor rather than emphasizing the cheese. Moreover, I believe the term "old school" used in the recipe's description is misleading. Perhaps a more fitting description would be "mac and cheese with a kick."

Served on Christmas Eve to RAVE REVIEWS.  Only wish I had followed the timing exactly as I had to let it sit for awhile to make other things and the sauce was soaked up more than I would have liked by the pasta.  Will definitely make again.  Everyone loved it.  Per other reviews I did double the Panko crust and also bought some southern style seasoned Panko since the store was out of plain Panko.  It worked.

OMG the flavor was absolutely delicious. I did 12 ounces of pasta and it was a bit dry. I will use less pasta next time. I didn't have enough cheese so I used velveeta for half of the amount. Was still superb. Thank you chef!!

Creamy inside, crispy crust! Perfect texture. 
Since I have a Mexican-addicted-to-chile palate, I added extra heat with jalapeño cheddar and I made the crust with gouda cheese (but will try it with the cheddar).

Currently scrapping the plate clean.

Very good recipe that was loved by my family.  I made the following changes;  
1.  I replaced cayenne pepper with Hungarian Smoked Paprika
2.  I doubled the crust 
3.  I used 4 cups of cheese with the extra going on top  
4.  I omitted the white pepper since I didn't have any
5.  I was very careful to stir the roux and sauce mix diligently until it thickened.  It took awhile, but it makes a huge difference.  Patience is involved.  
6.  I used the larger sized Macaroni vs. the typical elbow.  Much more comfort foodish imo.  

Give it a try, I think you'll like it!

This is perfect as written..you can eliminate the extra cheese on top (= extra calories). A dash of hot sauce instead of the cayenne is amazing...for a more complex flavor,  add in a pinch of Bell's Seasoning (a mix of herbs) instead of the thyme. The thyme is not too much for me. Taste the sauce before you put in with noodles and adjust salt level...salt level can vary considerably due to the kind of cheese you use, and how much you salted noodle water to begin with. I crush up Chiken and Biscuit  crackers with butter and sprinkle over the top...DO NOT put buttered panko or crumbs on and THEN the extra cheese- buttery yum-ness should be the last/top layer. YUM

THANK YOU CHEF JOHN...for another amazing recipe! Followed the recipe except substituted the caynne for paprika cause I don't have caynne and omitted the mustard since I don't have that either. Still turned out WAYYY better than the other Mac and cheese I made. My favorite Mac and cheese recipe. :)

Great recipe! I've made this several times and follow as written.  The only variations I've made is, at times,  if I haven't had a full 3 cups of sharp cheddar on hand, I've added gouda to make a full 3 cups of cheese.  This is stellar mac and cheese with a gourmet twist!

It was a favorite! There was none left at one party that I brought it too. I accidentally forgot the panko crumbs one time and will not do that again. It has a very interesting flavor, but I make it all the time now.

NOT FOR KIDS (or most adults). First off - I love Chef John's recipes - they are always classic and yummy. This was really unexpected. I was in a rush for dinner so I made it and didn't read the reviews ahead of time. Flavors are way too complex for mac and cheese - we tasted only thyme and mustard - strongly dominated the dish. The texture, topping, and overall method in the recipe is spot on - but the flavor...spot off. So unfortunate. I had to remake a quick mac and cheese for my kiddos.

Good, although Chuck's Macaroni on this site is better. Used 2 c. skim and 1 c. 2%, and used panko w/o butter for the crust. I'm sure it would have been divine if I had upped the fat quotient.

I've made lots and lots and lots of macaroni and cheese over the years, this is DEFINITELY the best batch I have ever made. Grown-up-now kids and hubby even noticed the change, and agreed it is the new favorite.
I did change a few things- only had ground thyme, so used a very scant 1/4 t. to it wouldn't knock us over. Hot sauce instead of cayenne -just because. Next time will cut the pasta back to 12 ounces because it made too much food for our group, and I prefer this dish on the soupy side.  Just fiddling with what is a very very good base recipe, tweaked to our taste and pantry. YUM!

This was delicious.  Not at all bland or over-thymed, and I made it as written (pasta as is - I thought it was plenty cheesy; maybe half a splash more worcestershire because I love the savory depth it adds, plus I used extra-sharp cheddar).  If you have a problem with texture, I'm sure it comes down to two things: adding the milk or using the right cheese.  First, if your bechamel is lumpy, try adding the milk more slowly  or in more stages, whisking completely until smooth.  Dumping in a lot of milk all at once is difficult to make smooth.  Second, if your mac & cheese is grainy, try shredding your cheese fresh from a block - don't use the pre-shredded stuff.  It's coated in starch to keep shreds from sticking, so that will mess up your texture.  Add the cheese slowly, too, like the milk.

I added shredded cheese on top with crushed ritz crackers.  The family liked that over panko bread crumbs. 
Second time: must have put too much mustard. Not good. Go light on the mustard!

Yum! I accidently dropped in 1 tablespoon of spicy brown mustard instead of the teaspoon of Dijon and it was still spectacular. I also made a little extra cheese sauce and extra topping. My husband had a bowl of it before it was topped and baked and he loved it that way too.  Will definitely make this again.

Made my own bread crumbs instead of using Panko crumbs but no other changes. Will make again but will likely use 12 oz of pasta as others have suggested. Very flavorful sauce with just the right amount of kick from the two kinds of pepper so I want to taste more sauce instead of noodles next time.

I made this tonight and although the flavor was good it was somewhat dry.  I agree with some of the other reviews to either use less pasta or double the sauce recipe.

Used this mac n chz recipe as a base for somewhat of a tuna casserole (I added tuna and veggies).   Otherwise made as directed, except couldnt find my cayenne so used a little habenero powder instead...oh and used italian seasoned breadcrumbs because I didnt have panko.  Ended up being pretty tasty. Will continue to use with the add ins...and would love to try just as written.

I made this following the advice of several others and doubled the sauce. It was good. I think I like more of a creamier consistency so I was expecting that. The crust was fantastic. I would make this again.

Excellent!  I make it exactly as it's written.  Thankful that I read the tip to make sure to use thyme leaves rather than ground thyme.  The crust is phenomenal.  My whole family loves this.

That sauce! Yum! I unfortunatly didnt have butter so I used soft margerine, worked great. I also subbed italian seasoning for the thyme ( personal preference) and 1 tsp mustard powder for the dijon. I added 1/4 tsp each garlic and onion powder. I cooled the noodles before mixing with the sauce as per another comment. So So Good! thanks for posting.
I made this all ahead of time and refridgerated until needed and then baked it little longer that the recipe states.

I almost followed this recipe exactly, but the reviews saying it was dry got the better of me.  I multiplied the sauce by 4/3rds, which gave me a nice round quart of milk and 2 full packages of cheddar.  I found the sauce to macaroni ratio to be perfect.  This conversion meant I had to us 1/3 tsp for most of the spices, which they don't make, so I just skimped on the 1/2 tsp.  The spices werer mild enough in the end, that I will increase all of them to a 1/2 tsp next time.  For those who felt it was a littl gritty, I'm afraid that's inevitable when you use aged cheddar - try using half cheddar and half Monterey Jack and your sauce will be smoother.  Pan size wasn't mentioned - I used a 13x9 (3 qrts) and it fit just right.  I found the pasta to be a little over-cooked, so next time I will skip the baking part.  I will probably leave the bread crumbs out - I didn't think they added much.  But for those who love bread crumbs and would like to skip the baking, just sprinkle the crumbs on top and broil the whole thing in the oven for a few minutes until the crumbs are crispy and toasted.

Very good. I did not have the nutmeg but did not miss it when it came time to eat. I was a bit hesitant about the mustard as I am not the biggest fan of its flavor but it was what sets this recipe above many others I have tried.

I used a mix of smoked Gouda and cheddar jack.  I get it about using more pasta, but wish I had gone with less for a more cheesy version, the 12 oz would have suited me better.  I also thought I knew better than the great Chef John and left out the salt....bad move!  Listen to the master!  Use the salt!

Finally a mac and cheese without lots of salt nor processed cheeses!
The flavor is amazing and true macaroni and cheese. 
I'm a diabetic so watching what I put into my body is very important to me. I loved the use of herbs and use mustards for salt. I don't  care for a bread topping but the use of Panko crumbs and butter is perfect. My husband is not crazy about "mac & cheese" but he loves this. Round it out with a salad or steamed broccoli and squeezed lemon is perfect.

This is a great recipe I've used many times, and it never fails to receive praise. Sometimes I increase the cheese, and I often add an extra layer of crushed Club crackers and another of crushed potato chips (in addition to the Panko bread crumbs, which are mandatory).

This has become my go-to mac/cheese recipe. It is almost perfect as written. However my boxes of macaroni *usually whole wheat - are 375 g (12 oz) so it makes it a little creamier. I usually double the recipe to get a very full 9x13 pan. I use a 2 year old sharp cheddar, and only add about 1/2 the salt, as I figure there is lots of salt in the cheese, and I use 1% milk because that is what we have on hand.  I also use a little dried parsley with the crumb topping just to add a little bit of colour. The family loves it!

Amazing. Followed to a T and it came out better then I thought it would. Make sure your thyme isn't ground but the leaf form instead so it won't be to strong. Oh actually I messed up and used medium cheddar instead of sharp but next time I'll use sharp. Don't know how I grabbed the wrong one

I added bacon and onions to this recipe to make it even better. I sautéed a whole onion then added it to the cheese sauce at the end, before mixing the cheese sauce with the macaroni. I also cooked bacon til it's crisp, pulled it into large bits by hand, and spread it between the layers of cheese and panko bread crumbs on top. This may be the best Mac and cheese I've ever had.

Well, Chef John is clearly the king of this site! Yet another fantastic recipe. I left out the cayenne, but put in 3 drops Tabasco. I also added cubed smoked ham. Great roux/cheese directions. Taking it off the heat before adding cheese is the solution to the grainy problem that can happen.

I made this almost exactly to the recipe with the only variation being the cheese. I added Asiago and Parmesan and used sharp cheddar. It turned out beautifully. Thick, creamy sauce and a nice crispy and flavorful crust on top. Will definitely make again.

Modifications: used 2 1/3 cups macaroni--maybe about 9 oz?--2 cups of shredded mild cheddar, 6 slices (4 oz) prepackaged American chz, 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs, 2 tb melted butter. Baked in 8x8 glass dish at 400 for 25 minutes. Outstanding. Maybe the best mac n chz I've ever had. Thanks to Chef John and other reviewers.

Very tasty but I would go slightly more creamy next time and add some vegetables such as cauliflower to give it some veggies.  But delicious as it is.

Great mac and cheese recipe. Like everyone else, I loved the topping. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except I didn't have panko breadcrumbs so I just used regular breadcrumbs. I also forgot the dijon mustard and it was still really good. My only criticism of the recipe is that it doesn't give the size of the casserole dish to use. I ended up using a 9x9 cake pan and it fit perfectly.

I enjoyed the different seasonings however, I felt it needed more sauce so it wasn't so dry in the end.

Really good. I added some diced chicken, broccoli, cauliflower and peas which blended in beautifully.  Increased the cheese sauce by 1/3 to compensate. Perfectly creamy and tasted great.

I liked it, my 7 year old did not.  This is definitely not like "blue box" and  has excellent flavor - the cayenne adds depth, not heat. I followed the recipe exactly and I think it could have baked a bit longer.  My other advice would be to let the dish rest and cool a bit before serving - the sauce texture improves significantly.

I liked this very much, as did my family. I did not have panko crumbs, as they are not available where we live but used a Corn Flake like cereal instead. It worked great! Will hopefully be making again soon. Also, I used more of a corkscrew style noodle, not sure of it's official name, but it worked great.

More like 3 stars for us but I think a better quality cheese would have made a difference.  I cut the noodles back to 12 oz as other suggested and it was still pretty dry.  Doubled the crust which was fine and cut the seasonings down a little bc I was afraid of them overpowering the dish.  I would try this again but be sure get really good cheese

Delicious.  However I think I might make more sauce for a bit soupier texture.  My family thought it was a bit dry.

I have made this at least 5 times over the last year, but didn't want to review until I had nailed down my suggestions. I love how easy this is--totally do-able on a weeknight. I use less milk (2c), skip the thyme (I hate thyme), use velveeta mixed with whatever other cheese we have (fontina and jarlsberg tonight), and reduce the salt. I also increase the mustard to 2tsp and use dijon. Not low calorie, but easy and family friendly.

This was very good. My only issue is that I'd first changed the serving size, and didn't realize that the directions applied to the original serving size (even though the warning was on the recipe). Hey, I have chemo brain + I was rushed to make it. Anywho, had I made this perfectly, it would have been amazing (the cheese wouldn't have been sticky and gooey). I would make this again, albeit correctly, and I recommend it.

Its pretty perfect Mac n cheese that is delicious and has balanced flavours. Unlike other recipes that have over killing amount of cheeses and butter dishes, this one is just simply perfect. It was a hit at my ThanksGiving Lunch. Thank you Chef John.

This is a very good recipe for mac and cheese.  The one I make is very similar the only difference is I do not use the cayenne or worstershire sauce or thyme.  Substitute those ingredients with powdered mustard, seasoning salt, pepper. a handful of finely chopped fresh onion and sour cream gives it great flavor and makes it creamier.  I have not tried the panko crumbs yet but I will make that my goal the next time prepare this dish .

it is dry and tasteless.  I even followed other reviewers advice to decrease the pasta and used only 14oz.  not that I love velveeta, but I am going to have to mix some in to give this some flavor and moisture.

2nd attempt not remembering that i already made this once.  again decreased the pasta to 12oz and kept the sauce proportions the same.  still came out the same.  dry and not terribly tasty.  sigh.  moving on.

This was ok. After all the rave reviews I expected it to me amazing. If I try it again I will do less pasta so its a little saucier. And it might need more salt or something.

I call this "grown up mac and cheese" or "mac and cheese with a kick".  My husband cannot eat a lot of creamy things especially at night and this was perfect.  One year I served it as a side for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Chef John always has a unique twist and in this case we loved it!  I would encourage everyone to give it a try.....  and you will probably make it again!

Great recipe! Predictable results, comes out great every time. I like a little more kick so I put closer to 3/8 tsp of cayenne and a generous squirt of Dijon. Love it!!

My family didn't like this at all. I think it was the nutmeg n lack of American cheese. Nutmeg is such a distinct flavor that I'm reluctant to use it

We LOVE chef John. We added seeded, sliced, fresh jalapenos and put bettered bread crumbs on top. I think a shallow dish would be okay, just bake for a shorter period of time. That way, everyone gets some bread crumbs.

Thyme DOES NOT belong in macaroni and cheese.  This one is a) too much work for mac and cheese b) too many ingredients for mac and cheese c) a waste of money and time.

I made the sauce the day before a big party and then did the rest the day of.  I think only using sharp cheddar makes the sauce sort of "grainy" so next time I'll experiment with smoother cheeses.  Still, everyone liked it.  I doubled the batch and it fit fine in an 9x13 deep baking dish.  I did, however, mix it together in a roasting pan just to be able to make sure half of it didn't end up on the counter while I was mixing.  Also, the 20 minutes is to long to bake; I think it took about 9 minutes to get golden on top.

Okay, I changed up the recipe by eliminating thyme, nutmeg and Worcestershire and still give it 5 stars simply because even without these additions, this is a delicious mac n cheese.  I had about half sharp Cheddar and half mild cheddar and to us, it was a great match.   Also used a little less than a 12 ounce size box noodles because we like a bit more sauce.  PS, it isn't everyday you get a call from DH telling you the mac n cheese was awesome at lunchtime.  Chef John, you're my kitchen hero.  Many thanks!!

Bland and pasty. Not much flavor. But I will give it credit for being rather tasty cold in an eating-it-just-cause-it's-there kind of way. I liked the crust idea but a 1/2 cup wasn't enough for my rather small dish. I may continue to use this recipe as a base, but I'll likely add garlic and/or some Parmesan/feta cheeses for extra flavor and some sort of cream for richness.

Creamy and rich! This is a great recipe to build upon, I think, by adding vegetables like broccoli or kale, which I will try the next time I make this. There will definitely be a next time. Yummy!

Loved it - kicks the old mac and cheese up a notch. This is the first recipe I have followed to a letter, and it was worth it. I watched the video of TJs Mac and Cheese as well. I've made it five or six times now and wouldn't change a thing. Leftovers don't last the day - they are all in there sneaking another bite...

Eh, I thought it'd be very good.  It was okay.  I didn't like the mustard flavor too much.  Although,if making this a main dish by adding polish sausage let's say, I think it'd be a good addition.  'Not too cheesy either.  I didn't add the thyme because I'm not a fan & even halving it, I thought might be a bad idea.  I halved the cayenne, but could've easily added the full amount.  It didn't have a hint of heat, even a hint, with 1/8t.  Oh, mine was plenty "sauce-y" as directed.  Adding less pasta would remind me of a thick soup.  :/  Oh, about the topping:  Not too wow-d by that either, but I did use regular, not panko, crumbs.  :?

This was really tasty, but just a bit sweet, I like a bit more savory. Also, if you have a child that doesn't tolerate spice well I would decrease the amount of cayenne pepper.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I love the combination of spices used that make it smell and taste so wonderful. It's a true comfort food, especially on a cold night. My fiance loved it and we will definitely be making this one again! I have been trying many different recipes to find a good baked mac and cheese, but have never come across anything very tasty, until now.

Omg! I used 5 year aged white cheddar. Used ALL of it in the sauce, and added extra with a bit of reg marble to the crust for color. Nothing left!! Looking forward to making this again.

This is my go to dish for casual dinner parties.  I have young kids and whenever we have other families over, this is what I serve.  People love it.  The only suggestion I have is to double the breadcrumb topping.

The first time I made this macaroni and cheese I was a little concerned about the spices, but it came out beautifully and tasted DELICIOUS! This recipe is a keeper! The spices enhance the flavor of the cheese and are not overpowering. Personally, I like to use a variety of cheddar cheeses and I use less noodles than the recipe calls for to make the macaroni extra cheesy!

A very good Mac and cheese!  Loved the spices in this. The thyme, and Dijon make it taste so grown up and the crunchy topping can't be beat!  Good recipe. Made exactly as written, but cut the recipe in half since there were only 2 of us eating it.

This stuff is luscious.  I made it as written except without the spices or worsterschire since I didn't have any on hand, and I doubled the sauce since someone mentioned it wasn't that saucy.  We love our mac n cheese saucy, and everyone thought it turned out perfect.  I'm sure the spices would have added some great flavor, so I'll try to include next time.  I took this to our Christmas Eve gathering and everyone said it was amazing.  I'm excited to try it with the spices, and then again with some other cheeses just to mix it up!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I definitely won't need to look elsewhere for a mac n cheese recipe again.

Best homemade Mac n cheese ever. I accidentally put in too much Dijon, like a tablespoon or more but it came out magnificent ! My nephew ate half the 9x13 pan.

Turned out great!  I doubled the crust, and only used a 12 oz package of pasta, and subbed soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce since that's what I had on hand. it was delicious.

Great recipe that I followed by the book to see how it would turn out.  Will make some change in the future:
Love the thyme, very subtle - I would add a pinch more to bring the flavor up.  Same with nutmeg and Worcestershire.  I don't salt excetp in sauces and to bring the flavor up but an added overall sprinkle on the leftovers after we had eaten really pepped the flavor up.  Could have also been that my grocery store extra sharp cheddar was pretty bland.   And, I will do this again using my mom's technique.  She didn't melt the cheese into the sauce, but instead once the pasta was sauced she would stir in cubes of cheddar.  That way they would  melt intact among the noodles and offer this burst of cheesy flavor!  YUM!

I followed the recipe, and I thought it came out dry and rather bland.  Maybe I should have taken other suggestions about doubling the sauce or cutting back on the amount of pasta. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Made this today for a family party and it was delicious.  I used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 pepper jack.  Best macaroni and cheese I've ever made.

I have been searching for an incredible macaroni and cheese recipe for awhile, to alternate with the one I typically make (which is close to perfect).  While Chef John's recipes for lasagna and chicken parmesan are 10 stars, this one is just meh.  Will continue the search.

This will be my new go to mac and cheese.  I didn't have any problems with the thyme, the cayenne, or the sauce/noodle ratio.  However, I will leave out the pepper next time because I am not a fan and if people want pepper, they can put it on their own serving.  

That was awesome!  Thank you!

No one in my family loved this. I appreciate the use of cayenne and thyme. Everything worked well together, but the final texture was just not creamy enough for me. Also, I think it needs a little more flavor.

Didn't hate it, but won't make it again. I can see myself using this as a base and tweaking it with a ton of gouda and more cheeses.

Also, I loved the au gratin.

Great recipe I've made twice.  Used different noodles each time and it turned out great.  I love the touch of cayenne, but otherwise it seemed a little bland to me, but this could have been the type of cheese I was using.  Also I did not like the cheese on top of the crumb topping because it prevented the bread crumbs from browning and crisping.  The second time I made it I just put bread crumbs on top and this was a little better.

Was looking for a tweak to my seemingly mundane Mac and Cheese and came across this...The only things I did different was add some chopped onion and double the topping mixture. I didn't have panko, so I used whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs instead. Also used multi-grain rotini because that is what I had. The family RAVED! A couple didn't even bother with catsup this time! I've never understood that, maybe mine was just that boring...haha...this is a keeper!! Thank you!

This is a fabulous recipe! The only thing I recommend is increasing the sauce and cheese. The only way this recipe could be better is to make is cheesier. The flavor is great!

Very good, we really liked the panko crumbs.  Still we would have liked a more cheesy sauce.  Next time we will try making double the sauce.

Delicious, lots of flavour, nice crust, and a nice kick of spice at the end.  I have a 3 year old so next time I'll take it a bit easier on the cayenne to make it less spicy for her.  Otherwise, yum!

Let me start by saying that I have never made mac & cheese before unless it came out of a Kraft box.  I don't eat the stuff, so I never really saw the need to try.  That said, my husband and two sons all love the stuff.  So, for Easter, I decided to try this recipe because it had such great reviews.  Easy enough to make (and I followed the recipe exactly as written) but all in all, the boys were not overly impressed.  They said it was ok but very bland.  I will try another one next time, but thanks to Chef John for an easy dish for my first try at mac & cheese.

I've always made cheese sauce using the butter/flour method but have never used the spices that are in this recipe before.  Made this dish with dinner ... FANTASTIC! The addition of the thyme and nutmeg add a depth to this dish that I've never experienced before. This is the recipe that I will be using from now on!

a little bland for me personally, perhaps with different cheeses? i'd like to try it with only sharp cheddar. i also found it didn't reheat very well.

made this for a family dinner...followed the instructions to a T, but following advice of other posters, I made 1 1/2 the amount of cheese sauce..after all of that, it still turned out on the dry side, plus the flavor was way to bland for all of us, even the grand kids didn't care for it..a lot of work and ingredients for a mediocre dish..won't make this again..

Loved it! Made about 1 1/2lbs of elbows and doubled the cheese sauce. I added about 1/2 tsp of dry mustard to the cheese sauce as well. I used skim milk and had no problem with a nice thick creamy sauce. Loved the panko crumbs....nice and crunchy. Thanks!

Big hit with the family.  Some Mac & Cheeses are just pasta and cheese but the spices in this recipe give it so much more depth.  This will be regular with us during Lent when we are not eating meat on Fridays!

This was a stellar recipe. The seasonings were certainly different than I was used to, but very nice.
I certainly made some errors while making this, though. First, I didn't actually have any AP flour, so I ground up some oats to replace it. The oats weren't quite good enough at thickening it, so I ended up having to add some instant (unflavored) potato to it (just enough to thicken it).
When I made the roux, I accidentally browned it too much. Strangely, it gave it a campfire flavor. I also used paprika instead of cayenne (which was probably part of the campfire flavor).
As I made it, it was a four star recipe, but I'd bet that if I had made it right, it would have been a five star.

This really is good ol' boy mac 'n cheese.  I followed the recipe so I could rate it as is (I don't measure herbs and spices, so I may have used a little more/less of each ingredient); however, I didn't have enough cheddar on hand, so I used about 4 ounces of Swiss cheese. The thyme adds a nice flavor.  Next time I use this recipe, I will decrease the pasta so the finished dish is more creamy, as many reviewers have suggested.  Other than that, this is a five-star keeper!

Great recipe!  I followed Chef John's suggestion for semi-cheesy mac and used 12 oz. of macaroni.  It is still INCREDIBLY cheezy, and I may go up to the 16 oz. next time.  I used old/sharp cheddar and gruyere, and it came out beautifully.  I can't wait to have more for lunch today!

This is the first time I've tried making homemade Mac and Cheese. I followed this recipe to a T and sadly, I was disappointed. I had a 500g box of macaroni and when I converted it to ounces it was 17 point something ounces so I took a chance and used the whole thing.  There was a lot of sauce when I poured it over the pasta, I was a little worried it would be soupy when it came out of the oven.  It was surprisingly dry.  I was amazed at how much it soaked into the pasta. The flavor was not very cheesy and I even made sure to buy sharp cheddar as it is not something I would typically have on hand. My first mistake was using the whole box of macaroni.  I think I would follow other reviewers suggestions of only using 12 oz of pasta and increase the amount of cheese if I was ever to make this again.  I was excited about the topping but I think it would be better if there was more sauce.  Also, I used ground thyme and I really didn't notice the taste at all. I think I will keep searching for a mac and cheese recipe.

Great recipe to build from, but I did a few things different.  I used rigatoni vs. elbow mac.  Instead of 3 cups of cheddar I did 2 chedder and 1 havarti to give it a little zing.  I also substituted the panko bread crumbs with crushed corn flakes and instead of going with more cheddar I topped it with fresh grated parmesan.  Turned out amazing!

I want to give it a 5 but I can't because I didn't have the cayenne, Worcestershire, white pepper, and thyme. That being said, I will buy those particular items and make it again. I also apparently poured too much pasta out of the box because my family said "more cheese!"  With that being said, I will make it exactly as the recipe states and will update my rating then.  :)    (PS - Chef John's video on mashed potatoes is the bomb)

Made this for my 2 boys (8 and 6).  The 8yo gave an immediate thumbs-up and didn't speak until he finished scarfing it all down -- "That was really good!"  My 6yo cleaned his bowl and declared, "That's what happens when I love it too much!"  Made the recipe as written except tripled the topping to cover the top of the casserole more completely and evenly.

Not bad. While I just love the creamy texture of Mouse's macaroni and cheese, this was decent nonetheless. Having said this, I don't think this will replace my loyalty to her. :) The fact that this makes a TON and is not that great reheated makes this a miss for me (I am only serving two people - my hubs and myself). When warmed in the microwave, my macaroni was SUPER dry (ick!). My second (minor) gripe is that this was a tad too custard-y for my liking. I prefer a saucy macaroni and this was quite the opposite. If you prefer a less creamy mac & cheese, this would be a superb recipe to add to your rotation. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for me. Thanks anyways, Chef John! :-)

Used a 5 year aged sharp cheddar from Wisconsin.  Was a little too overpowering for my taste but I am not much of a "sharp" cheese fan.  Panko and cheese topping was the best.  Going to try other recipes before I come back to this one.

I liked this but thought it had a little too much salt.  However, it is the best mac and cheese recipe I've tried to date.

Made this last night and it was a hit. We all liked it very much. I made another mac and cheese recipe once before from this site, but this will be my mac and cheese recipe from now on. No more boxed mac and cheese for us either. This recipe makes allot. Next time when I make it for just two of us, I will cut the recipe in half. Thank you Chef John.

amazing. make sure you make it in a proper casserole dish - as there was just enough of the topping to cover it. If you were putting it in a 9X13, double the topping.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it quite a few times and follow the recipe for the most part, but I do double the crust layer, everyone seems to love it along with the mac and cheese part!

I halved the recipe and found that to be plenty for 4 people. The taste was a little bland. In the future I would recommend using a little less flour. The cheese sauce was well blended but I didn't care for the pasty texture. Instead of using panko bread crumbs I substituted salt and pepper kettle chips. The crust turned out amazing!

This was delicious and very flavorful! Our changes: didn't add white pepper due to not having any, and we added in some bacon for kicks and giggles. Those were good modifications for us. Next time, I think I will forego melting cheese on the top and just add some more cheese into the sauce mixture.

This recipe was awesome!  I made this for our Thanksgiving meal, and it received rave reviews from adults and kids alike!  After Thanksgiving, I took leftovers, and added to ground beef for a yummy kid friendly dinner.

This recipe was different from my traditional layering of cheese and milk & egg sauce; BUT turned out good.  The ONLY thing i would adjust is that I used 14.5 ounces of pasta; next time I will use 8 - 10 ounces next time.  Although it didn't turn out dry, I just like my mac to be extra cheesier!

A huge hit with my guests. Made it exactly as described, with the sole exception that I added an onion, diced, as appears in most other mac'n'cheese recipes.

Used 12 oz of macaroni so it was creamier.  I also used dry mustard because I didn't have dijon.  Whole family loved it!  Everyone commented on how much they liked the little "zing" it had to it.

Very good mac n cheese.  I used whole wheat pasta and wished I would have used white.  I, like others, only used 13 oz pasta.  I also sprinkled the cheese before the panko.  I doubled the panko.

It came out great. I taste my sauce before I mix with my mac. It was too bland so I added a tsp and half of sea salt. My kids loved it! Husband want me to cook some more.

Excellent!  Be sure to watch the video...it helps you understand how you can alter this to your specific tastes. My alterations: I used a mix of Monterey Jack and Sharp Cheddar and put ALL 3 cups in the rue, then sprinkled just a little more MJ on top. I increased the Panko to 3/4 cup, and omitted the Thyme (I'm not a fan of thyme) and Cayenne (only b/c I knew toddlers would be eating it and I wasn't sure if it would be too much, so I just didn't use any at all, to be safe). I also like mine saucier, so I only used about 12-13 oz of the elbow mac.  It was a HUGE hit! Thanks Chef John!

Best when it's fresh--doesn't re-heat very well (it's only rich and creamy the first time...later it just becomes dry).  Still, an excellent recipe that feeds an army some good, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food.

Mac & Cheese with a little "twang"!  It was definitely good, but i think the cayenne pepper was a tad too spicy for my kids...i think next time i'll only use 1/8 tsp. instead of 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  
Otherwise, it was really good!!  :)

Even tried it with gluten free pasta and a little bacon...Amazing!!! My husband doubted that this could be a whole meal (this is coming from a man with a bottomless stomach) and he could barely finish the portion he took.  Will definitely make this again!

Substituted white pepper for black pepper and used extra panko/butter crumble for the top.  Delicious!  Made in a 9x13 pan.  Definitely a keeper for comfort food on a cold night (however it is not waist conscious!)

Wonderful!!!! Bangin', according to my husband. Kids ate it but 10 year old said it made her throat feel hot (nutmeg I'm guessing). But will make again and again and again.Used a variety of shredded cheese as I had several of different ones with only a bit left in them.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I followed it exactly, except I didn't have pank, so used cornflake crumbs and 1/2tsp dry mustard instead of the bottled stuff---still DELISH!  The spice ratio was perfect!  I do think it would be even better with the panko crust, but I definitely recommend that you try this-easy and amazing!  (The hubby, brother in law, and good friend all enjoyed it too!)

Great recipe. I added some chopped spinach and about 1/2 cup more cheese and it was awesome.  Careful not to add too much nutmeg - Not more than 1/8 tsp or it will overpower the dish.

It is ok and easy to make.  I thought it was fairly bland although I left out the cayenne because I don't like pepper.  It I make it again I will also reduce the white pepper.  I guess I was looking for something a little more creamy.

I followed the recipe exactly... except. I forgot the mustard. Best mac and cheese recipe ever. Even my 12 year old who would never eat anything but the boxed orange kind, ate about half a dish of this and said it was awesome.... kept coming back for more.  There is, as another reviewer noted, some breakthrough thyme flavoring, but it is not overwhelming. Thank you Chef John!

AMAZING. I used pure jalepeno havarti and  milk since both items were neary expiration, so the flavor is different. I only used 1 tablespoon butter and 1 T flour... i still had a cheesy creamy sauce the next day... the panko breadcrumbs is a MUST. I added leftover seasoned chicken breast and 1/2 cup broccoli florets in the mix- and had it for work every day. THANK YOU!!!

I made half of this recipe to go with our burgers the other night.  I used 6 oz. of macaroni hoping for a saucier mac and cheese, and I omitted the thyme and nutmeg as a personal preference.  For the cheese sauce, I didn't think a full 8 minutes of simmering was necessary and mine was nicely thickened in about 5 minutes.  I also increased the panko and used a total of 6 T. for my half recipe.  I baked it as instructed at 400 degees for about 20 minutes.  I left it on the middle oven rack and turned the broiler on just to give the panko a little more color.  Very good, although still not as saucy as I’d hoped.  But very good nonetheless, so I’ll be making this one again!  Thanks Chef John!

Tried this recipe for the first time 3 weeks ago (my first time making homemade Mac and Cheese). Have made it twice more since. I love it! I add a little more nutmeg than called for, as well as more Cayenne Pepper. Delish and highly recommended.

Made this for a party and it was a huge hit! Getting ready to make it to take to another get together today. Great flavor. Definitely a more "grown up" version of the dish with its little bit of spice. I actually liked it better before I baked it, it was super creamy, and I don't plan on baking it this time.

This may be my fault i missed a step and tried to put in some ing. a little late, the flavors may not have had enough time to comtogether. But this had very little flavor to begin with but left a spicy after taste. My husband who will eat anything didn't finish his.

I made this according to Chef John's recipe, except I reduced the mac ratio to 12 oz. (like most reviewers) to make my mac & cheese... a more cheesy version! 

Boy, it was so delicious and it even tasted better the next day when reheated in oven. Thanks so much Chef for this simple and wonderfully tasty recipe which is surely a keeper!

Crust issue: delicious fresh out of the oven, but texturally unappetizing when reheated.  Mushy.  So either make just what you'll eat or omit the topping.
I left out the thyme, dijon mustard, and sub'd 1 c. gruyere for 1 c. of the cheddar.  Absolutely my fave mac and cheese recipe!

I am no chef, and I make a much better mac n cheese...this recipe had no flavor at all. Used recipe exactly and I would make less roux and add 2 additional cups of sharp cheddar cheese and more salt to taste to make this more flavorful.  Loved the idea for dijon mustard and cayenne pepper--but other than that, will not use this recipe again.

We loved it. Omitted the thyme and cayenne.  Used cheese ends (sold at discount in deli) and added leftover baked ham. Super yummy.

just the right amount of cheese...not too wet and not too dry.  I'll be making this again real soon.
