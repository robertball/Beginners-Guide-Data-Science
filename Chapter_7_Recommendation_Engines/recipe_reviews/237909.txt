I made this recipe multiple times for 4 taste testers. The first time I made the recipe as written and cooked on high for 3 minutes. My second son ate it but it was a tad overcooked. Round 2 I added some vanilla and cooked on high for 2 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. A son 1 tried it and said it was weird, with chief complaints about texture. He kept saying it was eggy but when asked said it didn't taste like eggs. I made a couple more for my husband and 3rd son to get their opinion. My youngest son did not like it at all. He only had a couple bites. My husband agreed with my oldest that although it tasted ok it had texture issues and was unlike other in a mug treats I have made him... he wasn't a fan of this one. I think adjusting the egg and using the yolk only may help but adjustments are needed to make this 4 or 5 stars.

it's a good recipe! Although, I did happen to look through the comments and found that instead of using a whole egg, I should use only 1 egg white and add a dash of baking soda. So I did; but only cooked it for 90 seconds. And it tastes great! Afterwords, I ask tested a bit of chocolate syrup and it added to the flavor. I highly suggest adding these changes!

With changes, this is 4-5 stars. Use a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Skip the vanilla - it competes with the peanut butter for flavor, and is not necessary. Omit the egg and add a tablespoon of whole milk and a pinch (1/16th tsp) of baking powder. Use 1/4 cup of flour. Use a generous pinch of salt - too little salt and you won't taste the peanut butter as much. I also sprinkle some organic sugar on top before cooking, which adds a pleasant crunch to the top when it's done. Cooking time depends on your microwave power. At 1200 watts it's done in about 30-45 seconds. Err on the side of underdone.

It burnt inside the mug. It got so hot that it caught paper towels in the garbage can on fire when we tried to dump out the charred remains of this failed midnight snack. It also somehow boiled over in the microwave. I didn't even know cookies could do that!

Based on reviews and baking experience, I added a pinch of baking soda and a dash of vanilla extract and used only the egg white. I didn't taste the peanut butter at all and I used Skippy. So maybe add 1 1/4 tbsp. Of course I poured 1/2 the mixture in another mug because the recipe yields 2. If you microwave for about 1 minute and 20 seconds, you have a great mug muffin but never a cookie. So change it to Mug Muffin and you've got a hit!

It was so so spongy and did not at all taste like peanut butter. Overall, I think its a good concept, but it needs some tweaks to be edible.

This recipe is decent but definitely needs some adjustments.
I added a pinch of baking soda, 2 teaspoons vanilla instead of a tablespoon, 1 heaping spoon of brown sugar as opposed 1 regular tablespoon, and an additional teaspoon white sugar, and some brown sugar on top for a bit of crunch. 

I added a liberal amount of chocolate syrup on top after it was done cooking too.

I thought it should have baking powder in it and I was right it was hard as a brick. And barely had any peanut butter flavor.

Instead of microwaving, I doubled the recipe and cooked these in the oven as ordinary cookies. The texture is a bit chewy because of the egg ratio but they're surprisingly good for a microwave recipe

I did make a couple of changes with the recipe to give it a more cake like texture, I added a 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk. I found these adjustments made it quite nice and I would do it again.

For those of you having trouble with this particular recipe in terms of taste, consistency, over cooking, and the eggs bits floating around, here you go:

First off, don't put the salt. If you're using your average, run of the mill peanut butter, it has enough salt in it. Also, be sure to use UNSALTED butter.

For taste:

Add an extra half to one whole tablespoon of peanut butter for more of the peanut butter taste. Add an extra tablespoon or two of sugar for a sweeter taste. If you do use SALTED butter, put in two extra tablespoons of sugar. A dash of vanilla doesn't hurt either.

For consistency and the egg issue:

Make sure you used granulated sugar. The powdered sugar occasionally messes with the consistency of the cookie.

Don't use the whole egg. Separate the egg white from the yolk. ONLY USE THE YOLK. Make sure its mixed in together with the peanut butter mixture thoroughly. I suggest beating the yolk separately and then beating it into the mixture.

For over-cooking:

Don't cook it for 2-4 minutes. It will absolutely burn. Stick to 1 minute 30 seconds while occasionally putting a fork or toothpick through it to make sure its cooked.

Although I have made this recipe many times (and, personally, enjoyed the texture), I decided to change it up a bit so the texture is a little more cake-y. All I really did was only use half an egg and put it in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. It came out great! I also enjoy putting a bit of peanut butter on the finished product as well. :)

I made this twice, first time it came out hard as a rock.  Second time I made exactly as the recipe said except I added a tad more peanut butter and made it in a glass mug cooking it for only 90 seconds. It was very good. Not too sweet and the texture was more like a muffin.  I would make it again this way.

For something that's ready to eat in 5 minutes and takes away a sweet craving when you've nothing else in this isn't bad. I used all white sugar (as that's all I had) and crunchy peanut butter (which added a nice crunch) and cooked it for 2 minutes. Hit the spot :-)

This recipe comes out a-okay once you make a few tiny changes! I used about 1/4 teaspoon of both baking powder and vanilla, went a little generous on the peanut butter, and added a few more teaspoons of flour until I got a (semi) cookie-dough consistency. It's also a must to microwave at 30 second intervals for a minute. It's not exactly a "cookie", but I still think it's tasty!

I did not read the reviews and was glad that when I tried this that I wasn't the only one who had a tough, eggy mess... the only thing that saved me was that I had added 2tbsp of chocolate chips! might try it again with just the egg yolk. I microwaved it for 30 seconds at a time for 2 mins... might try 1 to 1.5 next time.

I made this tonight. Based on the reviews, I edited this recipe using 1 egg white, brown sugar, a dash of baking soda and cake flour. It was very good! Thanks for the idea!

Add a bit of vanilla and use only an egg yolk. We cooked it 30 seconds at a time for 1.5 minutes. May have only needed 1 min. The top doesn't look done but don't let it fool you. It is probably still done and yummy!!!
