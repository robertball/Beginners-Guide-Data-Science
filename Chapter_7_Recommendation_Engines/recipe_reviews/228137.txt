I only made one substitution, I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. I took the recipe submitter's advice and use Ruffles chips. Baking at 350*, my cookies were done at NINE minutes--once they cooled they were soft and chewy. I think these are good, my whole family seemed to like them. My family thought this cookie could use chocolate chips. I'll make these again but throw a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in.

Love the sweet and salty taste and the soft and crunchy texture. Skipped the nuts, but rolled some of the dough balls in crushed potato chips for texture. Very good cookie. Used Land O Lakes butter. Very nice results.

Great combination of sweet & salty. I have several Potato Chip Cookie recipes & this one is at the top. I didn't make any changes but sometimes I will add finely chopped pecans, sometimes not depending on my mood. They have the consistency of a shortbread cookie & are wonderful!

I didn't put in the nuts. My cookies came out very crumbly. I didn't sift the flour, which might have been the problem. Taste was good. Cookies a bit flat.

Cookies weâ€™re a little chewy, and very moist. A hit with the family.

Salty and sweet, deliciousness! I made one change, while still warm from the oven, rolled them in powdered sugar. Taste sort of like those Russian tea cake cookies and adds a bit more sweet to the cookie.

I made the mistake of making these with lightly salted potato chips.  These cookies were good but definitely needed saltier chips.  Otherwise, I think this is a very good recipe.  Will make again using regular chips.

Added a pinch of sea salt to the top of the cookie before baking, it was amazing! Tastes like a crunchy, salty shortbread cookie!
