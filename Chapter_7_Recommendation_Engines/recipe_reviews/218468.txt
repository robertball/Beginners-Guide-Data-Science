We absolutely loved this. I've got a bit of a summer cold, so I drank a good portion of this myself. It was simple, the ingredients were cheap and easy to obtain and it was delicious! This may just be our new summer drink--and the husband and I talked about making this an adult cocktail with a little vodka!

Very refreshing and so easy to make! Would be nice with a little vodka for an adult drink too! Will make throughout summer!
