Excellent Hot, 
Excellent Cold, Excellent, Excellent 3 Days Old!!!!  These rolls are without a doubt, by far, the best I have ever eaten - they just don't get any better than this!  Don't be fooled by the title of this recipe.  They don't taste like oatmeal at all; they are just soft and tender.  I love them with honey butter, salted butter, hot ham and cheese, jam, chicken salad, or just plain without anything on them at all.  The subtle sweetness of this soft, easy to work with dough serves as a fabulous base for cinnamon rolls too.  I highly recommended you try them - you won't be disappointed!

This recipe is really great, and I did everything exactly like the instructions say. 

HOWEVER, it is really important to cool your oatmeal to lukewarm before adding it to your proofed yeast. If you add something that is too hot to the yeast, it could kill some of the yeast resulting in rolls that won't rise!

In reading this recipe I thought 1 1/3 C of water for yeast seemed like a lot---checked out Original recipe from Taste  of Home Mag. and the amount is only 1/3 C.water for the yeast-may make a great difference  to the extra flour required to make a dough of the right consistency.

Not sure what the first reviewer was talking about - yes the dough for these rolls is a little sticky - but easily manageable! AND - they are DELICIOUS. Soft, but with a full texture - I get raves every single time I make them! They make great rolls - absolutely great! Thanks for the recipe.

I made these to go with beef stew last night and they were so good!  I made a little adjustment after reading the other reviews and I only put about 1 1/4 cups of water in with my oats and butter.  The dough was a bit sticky but I resisted the urge to add too much flour and the result was awesome!  They were (and the leftovers still are!) tender, soft and tasty!  I have been trying to get yeast rolls right and I  have found that not adding too much flour and baking just until golden yields the best results.  Overbaking and too much added flour makes them dry and hard and then yucky!  I will make these again!  They were a hit with the whole family!

I made this recipe in my bread maker as it is written (looks like the amount of water for the yeast has been corrected to only 1/3 cup) and it was FABULOUS!!!  I put the ingredients into the machine in this order:  oatmeal mix first, then the water (no yeast), flour, salt, sugars and yeast. Put the machine in 'dough cycle'. When ready, instead of rolls I made two small loaves: divided the dough in two, stretched it  to about 8x8 and rolled it jelly-roll style just like you form white bread loaves.  It came out perfect. Will upload pictures soon.

What a great recipe, easy to make and they come out soft and fluffy. I did add 1/2C more flour to recipe, as I live in a high altitude area. My family really enjoyed them.  Thanks!!

Excellent, soft, dinner roll. The oatmeal gives it extra flavor and a little extra texture. The dough is very soft as well as the roll. A sure hit with my son who was home visiting for the week.

Don't try to make this recipe as written. There is an error in the recipe. Just google Oatmeal dinner rolls recipe and the original (from the same person in Marble Rock, Iowa) will come up in Taste of Home magazine. As others have said, it takes 1 cup less water. To try to make it as written here will only lead to frustration.

I thought these were pretty good. They turned out nice and soft, and as another reviewer mentioned, they have more texture than regular rolls. Good for sandwiches. I did find the dough a bit tough to work with. I had to add 2 extra cups of flour to get it to be dough in the first place. Then after it rose, it was all sticky again! Nonetheless, a great dinner bun. We're eating them with nothing on them!

The amount of flour needed is greatly underestimated.  It is impossible to knead these rolls with as much as two additional cups of flour.  I am concerned that the amount of shortning, sugar and salt will not make a tasty roll!

Very nice rolls, and they bake up soft.  I used 1 3/4 of wheat flour, subbing for that amount of white flour, then proceeded with the recipe as written.  I used the bread machine for these and it worked very well.  I thought they were a very light, sweet roll that were good with soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love making rolls and looked with anticipation that this recipe would be a great one. However, I was disappointed. Rolls were light, but not fluffy. After writing my review, I noticed several reviewers used a bread machine. I beat all ingredients by hand using a wooden spoon and they blended well together. After eight minutes of kneading, dough was not smooth yet elastic. Dough did not double in size after one hour nor did it double in size after shaping dough into balls. Yeast was not old, but refrigerated. With the wonderful aroma coming from the batter as I mixed it, I expected rolls to have a great taste but that didn’t happen. Next time I make this recipe I will (probably) increase brown and white sugar a bit or exchange / add other ingredients to improve the taste of the rolls.

Ok my husband brought home a breadmaker last night, and today I decided to try this recipe. I have NEVER in my life used a bread maker so it was a little tricky for me because I wasn't sure if I needed to change the amount of flour I used. Turns out I need to reduce it by at least 1/2 - 1 cup. Other than the bread rising to much it came out really good. The flavor is great my daughter and I like it...now waiting for hubby to come home so he can try it.

MMM, delicious!! I subbed 2 cups of wheat flour for 2 cups of all purpose and it made them all the more delicious. A note about the time posted for this recipe: they will NOT be ready in an hour start to finish. They take about 3 hours, but about 2 of those are rise time. They're absolutely worth the time and effort though!

Dangerously delicious! Makes 18 HUGE rolls. I shortened the 2nd rising time, and they still turned out great! THey were very tender with a crisp golden crust. I did need about 1 cup extra flour, but whatever, they were amazing!!!

Quite delicious. Those of us who don't have 9 in round baking pans need to remember to keep the placement rather close. Also, as another reviewer stated, one should let the oatmeal cool down before processing, so that it doesn't kill the yeast.

I made these using all wheat flour because I was out of white. I had been looking for a recipe I could use to make hamburger buns. I halved the recipe and used my bread maker to make the dough. I didn't cook the oats first, I put in the order suggested by another reviewer, oats, butter, water, flour, sugars, salt and yeast. When the dough was ready I made it into 8 rolls. I flattened the rolls and baked them on a cookie sheet when they had risen. I put butter on the tops as soon as I took them out of the oven so they wouldn't be crunchy. The bottoms were still a little firm, this is no fault of the recipe and as dinner rolls would probably be preferable. Next time rather than  putting butter on them, they are so healthy otherwise, I am going to put them in a bag while they are still warm so the moisture will make them soft. I will repost if this works! We ate these with "Chris's Bay Area Burgers" and 'Spicy Baked Sweet Potato Fries" both from this site. We felt really good that we were eating healthier! I will be keeping this recipe.

Sorry, but this recipe is the only "dud" from my Thanksgiving dinner. I'm an experienced bread baker, too - but these things were bombs (not in the good sense)... they each weighed about a pound!

This recipe has potential. The flavor is okay(needs a little tweaking for my tastes), but the dough is messy.  I'm going to play around with the consistency and probably add some honey in place of sugar. Also when I put the "dough blobs" into the 9 inch round, they just all rose together into a big round flower design. Next time I will grease some muffin pans and try it that way. I used old fashioned oats and that added a nice texture to the crust of the rolls. I am very familiar with 'soft dough' and the light airy rolls it produces,however even with extra flour this was beyond soft and just full-blown sticky. I was really looking forward to these rolls as oatmeal is one of my favorites.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving dinner where I was a guest.  They were great!  I couldn't stop eating them!  I had never made bread at home or used yeast before, but it wasn't hard, if you have the time.  Next time I feel like making bread, I will make these.  Great recipe!

I just pulled these out of the oven and had to try one warm with butter! They are so good!! The only thing I changed was I added more flour, they are a little sticky once They rise, but when they're done, they are awesome! They have a nice texture and flavor and don't taste like oatmeal for those who were skeptical because they don't like oatmeal ;)

I have used this recipe for years, having seen it originally in "Taste of Home".  I was originally drawn to it because it is a smaller recipe.  Sometimes I just don't have time to make a huge batch of rolls and this fits the bill perfectly.  I usually add a little more flour than the recipe calls for, but they always turn out perfectly.  The oatmeal gives them the appearance of a wheat roll.  My family loves 'em!

This is an excellent dinner roll recipe that I have been making for years now and the whole family loves them.  The only change I've made is to use milk instead of water. I believe it makes the bread more dense.  Sesame seeds on top also makes it great.

This is a real winner.  However.......ain't NO way it will be ready in 1 hour!  There are 2 risings, and a 10 minute resting in between which brings the time up closer to 3 hours.  The texture and flavor are exceptional, just be aware that you need to allow extra time.

Super good! Nothing left over after 1 meal. Kids ate them for breakfast too! No adjustments for high altitude..we're at 4500ft above sea level. Easy enough to make.. did take all afternoon. Made about 25 rolls. My hubby does'nt like dense bread, this wasn't the most lightest roll but still tolerable. He liked that it was slightly sweet. Thanks! Will make many more times!

Ready in one hour - no way! I didn't read the directions before starting, my bad, I just glanced at the top.  It will take about 2 and a half hours all told.  I'm so unhappy now, though, since my rolls won't be ready until an hour after dinner.

These rolls are so soft and fluffy indeed. I cooked the oatmeal a bit longer than 1 minute, so that's why maybe I didn't need as much flour as some people said they needed. I used the exact amount. The dough is a lit bland. I added sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and scallions and some garlic powder in there and I love it. I just wish I had added a little more salt.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were fabulous. Two of my friends tried to hide them from everyone else but all 18 disappeared immediately. Made exactly per the recipe and wouldn't change anything. I am going to try to make it into a loaf of bread as we loved the flavor so much.

Great recipe! As suggested in the comments, I used my bread maker for this, and was inspired by another comment suggesting to make these into cinnamon rolls. But instead of the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon filling, I used a quick pumpkin custard I made with pumpkin puree, butter, an egg and sugar. My brother and sister-in-law, among others, adored these! Thank you :-)

I followed the recipe to a T, and the dough ended up very tough & dry. I added more water until the consistency of the dough was very sticky, prayed, and followed the rest of the recipe.  BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! Holy cow these are the absolute best rolls I've ever eaten in my LIFE. Thank you SO MUCH!

well, I printed out the recipe and it reads 1 1/3 cup of water, which I thought was alot. I noticed several other people commented on this too. Now the recipe reads only 1/3 cup. Big difference folks.It took soo much flour to get the dough to be workable. I have just finished making them into the 18 balls. I am hoping I did not spend all this time for a roll thats a rock. I will be upset if I have wasted my money and time on a misprint. I will see what I get when they are finished, but I'm not real hopeful at this point.

Excellent texture, color, and smell--just a little bland.  Easily doctored with some butter, though.  Next time I'll try doubling the brown sugar.  Thanks!

Made this last night with instant oatmeal - a big mistake! Lucky I made half a recipe & skip the extra water. Instead of 2 1/3 cup flour, I ended up using about 3 1/2 c flour, extra 1/2c instant oatmeal. To balance it out, I add 1/2tsp more yeast, 1/2t salt & 1 tsp sugar. But in the end, the rolls come out great! I'm going totry it gain with the right kind of oats next time!

Mmmm, we're eating them right out of the oven! The humidity in the air plays a role in how much flour you need so I had to add 5 1/2 cups. It was still a sticky dough so I left it in the standup mixer bowl to rise. After the first rise I poured it onto a well floured counter and kneaded in just enough extra flour to handle. I used as little flour on my hands as I could to roll the balls. The rolls came out remarkably light and fluffy. Oh, and I left out the white sugar as I didn't want these too sweet. I will definitely make these again.

I used my Kitchenaid mixer to knead this and had to add a LOT more flour (and still never cleared the sides of the bowl), even though I reduced the second water measurement to 1 c.  Though the flavor and texture of the insides were good, the tops and edges that were against the pan were tough.

This was my first time making buns, and it was beyond a 5 stars. My only change was using 1/2 the flour as whole wheat, and I probably needed about a cup more than stated. I made sure they were just slightly undercooked. The entire batch was gone by the next day, and my husband took some to work to show off how good of a cook his wife is!

My mother, sister and I have all made this many times with perfect results.  I originally saw the recipe in the magazine.  These rolls are perfect for a holiday meal.  A definite keeper in our family.

These were just ok.  They seemed very dense, and the flavor was different but we didn't care for it.  This is the first time I've had to throw leftover dinner rolls away because no one wanted to eat them.  Sorry but I don't think these are worth the effort.

I had to add about 2 more cups of flour to get the right texture.  I do not have a bread machine so I made them the conventional way.  They turned out beautifully.  Nice and light and flavorful.  Good recipe and I will use it again with the additional 2 cups if flour
