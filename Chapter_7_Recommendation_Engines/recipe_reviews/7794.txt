I used this recipe for my bosses birthday, I was so embarassed when everyone started eating it. The cake was dry and the flavor was awful. This is the worst recipe I have ever made. I will never use it again, nor would I ever recommend this recipe to someone.

Unfortunately this was not a good cake and I won't make it again.  There wasn't much flavor to the batter and the finished cake was exceptionally dry - not at all moist.  I think the cooking time was too long.  I took my cakes out 6 minutes early and the top of the cake was too brown and crunchy and the inside dry.

This was a terrible cake. It shouldn't even be called a cake. It was dry and it cracked. It tasted like dough.The ingredients alone is more valuable then this cake. If you are planning to bake a cake, don't kill yourself with this one. Believe me, after you bake this thing, you will never want to bake again. All this so called dessert does is waste your time, ingredients, and now you have a load of dirty dishes to do. DO NOT BAKE THIS CAKE!Don't torture yourself like this.

This is a VERY rich cake.  Everyone loved it!  I have been asked to make it again at least a dozen times.

This cake was terrible. It was a waste of my time and ingrediants. The cake was very dry and cracked can't ice it. It makes a good sweet bread though. This is what I get for not reading reviews first but I've learned my lesson. I think there might have been a typo maybe it should have been 2 cups of flour and not 4 cups of flour.

Great cake!  I found the batter to be way to dry so I added milk when mixing.  Turned out great!

This cake was easy to make, doesn't use exotic ingredients, is soft  and tastes splendid. You could top it with anything because although the inside is tender, it is somewhat crusty on top(good for frosting)I highly recommend it.

I lost a similar recipe in a divorce; he kept all my cookbooks.  The trick is beating the cake for about 2 minutes at each stage:  butter, butter/sugar/vanilla (I use cognac)/and each milk and flour addition.  Also, I used two eggs and four yokes instead of just yokes.  Also, this cake is incredibly versatile.  You can make a dozen or more cakes from it by adjusting the liquid and fruit ingredients.  For a light lemon butter cake, I used the juice and zest from one lemon.  And I am going to ice it with a more lemony butter cream icing.  But you can make dump cakes, coconut cakes, orange cakes, banana cakes, etc.  I've been looking for the recipe for years (from an old International cookbook).  I'm so glad I found it again!

Not a good recipe. It took forever to get my oven to 2880C to get this stuff to melt. The resulting cake was not enrich- able.

It was  really good but not as good as wedding cake. It was exceptional, one of the better cake recipes I have tried.  It is a little crumbly which makes it harder to frost but exceptionally moist and tasty, better than the store bought.

I thought this recipe worked great.  I did sub 4 whole eggs for the 6 egg yolks though.  I don't know what the problem is with the rest of the people saying it is dry.  Mine came out very moist and airy.

I made this cake for a special friend's birthday.  I didn't change a thing.  It sounded like it would be decadent and we were looking forward to it, especially since it's not cheap to make!  We were VERY DISAPPOINTED! It was so very dry - we threw it out! Maybe it was her gas oven or maybe it was the dark pans. If I try once more, I'll also check the cake after 30 minutes of baking.
