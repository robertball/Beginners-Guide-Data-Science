I have made this several times, as is and incorporating various suggestions, as it is a very kid-friendly recipe. Of all the iterations, we like best to add a package of taco seasoning to the meat mixture, along with the specified ingredients, and put a layer of refried beans on each tortilla as we layer. A really helpful recipe -

Very easy. I was skeptical while making it, but the texture was awesome- just soft enough to cut with only the edge of your fork. The meat mix was awesome: meaty, cheesy, and creamy (but NOT overpowered by the Velveeta) I could see the meat mix being even better with some tinkering (jalapenos, red peppers, etc.). I recommend this if you don't have more than an hour but you don't want to make a heavy, hearty meal.

I made this as directed and the family enjoyed it.  It is very easy weeknight meal that you can easily customize to your family's tastes.
