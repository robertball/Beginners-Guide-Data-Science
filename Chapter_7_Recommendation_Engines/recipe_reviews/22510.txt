Huge hit at our party.  We changed it to make 20 servings.  Used the Bush's baked beans with brown sugar and bacon, so we didn't double the brown sugar and bacon,just the beans.  Also added onion when making the bacon and 1 tsp dried mustard.

I made this recipe in a cast iron skillet. I used 3 strips of bacon, ¼ cup onion and ½ cup lightly packed brown sugar. I layered them in that order in the skillet and put over low heat. When all the sugar was melted I stirred the mixture and let it cook very slowly for a total of about 20 minutes. Then stir in the canned beans and 1 tsp. of dry mustard. The whole thing goes into the oven for 30 minutes. The onions weren't even detected by my onion hating daughter. Beware, this is very rich.

Definitely not low calorie, but this is a fabulous dish.  I added chopped onion and a heaping tsp. of dry mustard.  Everyone at the picnic raved about the flavor and I had several requests for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I know, I know. It's just baked beans and bacon, right? Wrong! It was DELICIOUS. The bacon sauteed in brown sugar and onions... it just worked so well and added more flavor than you could ever hope to get from a can. I made it for a party and it was a huge hit! I'm going to make this for myself quite often. Normally I'm not a baked bean person, but I couldn't get enough of these.

Wow! So easy and yet so good - ya gotta love it when a few simple ingredients come together for something so tasty! This definitely is a favorite at every BBQ meal and this recipe has a wonderful flavor probably due in part to bacon (which makes just about anything taste better)! Other than adding a bit of molasses (something my Grandma Helen taught me) I wouldn't change a thing. This is a great way to take a regular 'ol can of baked beans and turn them into something special without a lot of effort!

GREAT twist to baked beans.  Rachel Ray actually used this recipe (or one exactly like it) in one of her 30 min meal shows.  We actually tried it from watching the show and although I have tried a lot of oustanding baked bean recipes, this one is the easiest but still has that wow factor. Adding some onions in (add them with the brown sugar - don't mix in the beans) is also a good optional item.

This was very tasty and EASY! I doubled the recipe, but only used 12 oz. of bacon and about 4 tbsp. of brown sugar.  Used the "original" Bush's baked beans.  Turned out perfect! I would definitely not use any more sugar.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ and got many compliments! Very easy and quick to make. This will be my main baked beans recipe from now on. However, I did use only about half of the brown sugar the recipe called for when I tripled the recipe. It was perfect with only half of the sweetness. Also, I prefer my bacon to be a bit more on the cooked side so think I will try frying the bacon for a few minutes before I add the brown sugar next time. Num!

This is a keepr recipe! I use Bushes Original beans. The only thing I changed is that I do the bacon and brown sugar step in the oven. Then I pour the beans over that, stir and stick back in the oven. My in-laws loved it when I brought it for a bbq. My kids beg for me to make it again and again!!!

The first time I made these they were way TOO sweet. My husband said they were so sweet they made his teeth hurt. 
I made some adjustments. I did not add the brown sugar while cooking the bacon. Instead, I used two cans of baked beans (great value) and a pound of bacon, fried crispy and crumbled. I fine diced a small onion, sauteed it and mixed it with the baked beans, bacon and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp. dry mustard to the mixture. It was a hit and got lots of compliments from my college football tailgate crowd.

After reading the reviews, I only used 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  I'm glad that I did.  They were plenty sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  I also chopped an onion & sauteed it with the bacon and added a dollop of prepared yellow mustard to the beans before baking.  Oh & I used Bush's Baked Beans in the can to start with.

This recipe is nearly identical to a recipe handed down 3 generations in my family. The only difference is this recipe lacks 1 tsp. ground mustard stirred into the beans before the bacon is added. It is the easiest baked bean recipe I have found to date, and our favorite!!!

Every where I go people request that I make this.  I cook bacon with one sweet chopped onion until bacon is crispy.  Drain all fat and add to beans.  Then add brown sugar and mix.  I then add a little brown sugar to the top before baking.  Bake at least one hour for perfection!!!

These are really yummy!  I reduced the amount of sugar based on other reviews.  I doubled the beans and bacon for a larger crowd and probably only used 4-8 oz of brown sugar.

Well, I was a skeptic...I mean, how can such a simple recipe be so good?  But I made these (tripled the recipe) for a cookout and everyone absolutely raved about them.  People who didn't even like baked beans went back for seconds and thirds.  The funny thing is that when I tasted them, I thought they were just okay.  But at the end of the day I had a completely empty pot to take home.  I skipped the oven part and threw everything together in a crockpot, cooked it on low for 4-5 hours and had great results.

We had a ball game to go to and I was short on time.  This made for a great one-dish meal.  I used Bush's baked beans and added hot dogs.  Thank you m.a. barclay for sharing.

Way too sweet! I will however try it again and cut the sugar down a lot! Also, I'll cook the bacon and drain it first. It had a good 1/4 inch of grease on top which I drained before serving. 2 out of the 7 people I served it to loved it. Everyone else agreed it was way too sweet!

This is decadent. The bacon really added a great flavor. I added chopped onions to the bacon and brown sugar mix. I used Campbells Pork and Beans as the baked beans. YUM!

This is really good for such a simple recipe.  I did add one extra 28 oz. can of Bush's Baked Beans with brown sugar and bacon and 1 heaping tsp. dry mustard as suggested by other reviewers.  Outstanding results! I served this with Scott Hibbs Amazing Whiskey Grilled Ribs from this site, a green salad, and Lemon Glazed Cake, also from this site.  Fantastic meal!

Very good!  I doubled the beans (took advice from others and used the Bush's Baked Beans with brown sugar and bacon, added a large chopped sweet onion, and kept the brown sugar and bacon the same.  They were plenty sweet enough!  Excellent and very easy to make--a keeper!

Yummy.  Made these for the 4th and there weren't any leftovers.  Very easy.  I used 4 oz. of brown sugar per can instead of 8.  Will definitely make again.

Such a keeper recipe! This is one way to soothe a hungry man quickly and keep him coming back for more. My friend brought the ingredients on a 3-day camping trip and cooked it on the coals of our campfire. It was more popular than marinated steak and shrimp dishes we also made. I use unsulphured molasses or real maple syrup if I don't have enough brown sugar. And, here in Florida, it wouldn't be baked beans without Vidalia onion. This is a versatile, simple recipe that can easily be adjusted for individual tastes. I like that it can be frozen, cooked in a crock pot, frying pan, casserole dish, or campfire. It has minerals, protein, iron, and fiber as well (just don't tell the men it's good for them). Thanks, Barclay, for a job well done!

I made these beans just as the recipe called for and they were a hit!  I get asked to bring these beans to all family get-togethers now.  Excellent!

First of all let me say I made some pretty big changes so it may not be fair for me to rate this recipe, but it was the basis of what I did. I didn't have bacon so I used about 1/3 c. Hormel bacon bits (the kind in the bag), 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1 tsp. canola oil and stirred on the stove until the sugar melted. I then added 1/4 c. chopped onion, 1 tbs. yellow mustard and 1 16 oz. can of Bush's Baked Beans. I let this simmer for about 30 minutes and it was a huge improvement over the beans straight out of the can.

My family loved.  The first time I did the bacon I walked away for one minute and came back to black tar.  (Okay more like 5 minutes :0)  The second time I cooked the bacon just a little and then added the sugar (prefer our bacon a little more cooked)  I ended up cutting down on the sugar about 6 ounces (per reviews) and my family could not get enough.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent baked beans. I received many compliments on them. I doubled the recipe, but replaced the bacon with a 12 oz. package of turkey bacon. I also added a minced small yellow onion and 1 tsp. dried mustard.

Taste testing this, I decided to add some yellow mustard, a little salt not much, and a dash of black pepper. I also kept the bacon grease in this recipe. Talk about YUM!! My taste buds just needed that little extra kick! Thanks.

Almost too easy! My husband absolutely loved this. He works second shift so I make up meals ahead of time that he can easily reheat for his dinner. This dish freezes well and doesn't turn to mush when reheated.

This is so tasty and I haven't even baked it yet.  It is sweet though, so I'll use less sugar next time.  I also chopped an onion into the bacon mix and added 1 tsp ground mustard as other reviewers suggested.  I only used a little of the bacon grease/sugar mix left in the pan as I try to keep it a little healthier.  May try turkey bacon next time.

Really good and really easy.  The brown sugar carmelizes the bacon, which is a flavor that's hard to beat. I used the cast iron skillet method, which is even better because it only uses one pan.  It baked for about 30 minutes, intil thick.

The beans with the brown sugar was good but the bacon was so slimy. I followed the directions but I think maybe I should've cooked the bacon longer. Also, I baked the beans based on the recommended time but the middle was still not hot.

Very easy and very tasty.  These are the only beans I make now.  I changed the recipe to add 1 more 28 oz. can of beans and 1 small onion, finely chopped.  I also drain most of the liquid the beans come in.  Turns our really well this way.

Made these for my husband, I don't care for baked beans so I'm going on his review. He said that it really didn't taste any different from the regular canned beans just a little sweeter. We'll keep searching for the perfect recipe.

Definatly a keeper.  Who'd have thought you could turn that  from the can into such a delicious and satisfying dish?  Everyone who ate it raved about it.  Next time, I'm gonna try reducing the sugar a bit, and adding some bbq sauce.

Wow! Who knew ? I looked at the recipe and thought... I put brown sugar in  beans all the time,I then read that you cook the bacon with the brown sugar.This was the secret to this bean recipe.I did drain off the grease before I mixed with the beans and I too added one sweet onion and a tsp. dry mustard. This is better than the old family secret recipe,but it is very sweet. Thanks !

This was good! I changed just a few things though. I did add some onion and I like my bacon cooked well so I sauteed it all the way through before adding the sugar. And I didn't add quite as much sugar as the recipe calls for. I've made this recipe twice this weekend already!

I tried this recipe tonight for Memorial Day and it was only so-so for us.  I cut the brown sugar back to 6 oz. and it was still very sweet.  I also felt like it would have been better with a little mustard added.  I might try it again using pork and beans instead of baked beans and adding a touch of mustard.

This was sooo good and sooo easy. What a great way to make regular canned baked beans taste as if you had been cooking them all day long.

deserves 5 stars just because they're so darned easy and delicious. i took other users' advice and added the dry mustard as well as onions (that's how dear old mom  used to make 'em). the only thing i would caution against is doubling the sugar if you double the beans. i don't think it's necessary and wouldn't next time; very sweet. but i didn't get any complaints, either. and everyone loved all the bacon pieces.

I quadrupled the recipe to feed 20 at a family dinner and like a number of other people suggested, added powdered mustard and diced onion. It got great reviews from everybody who ate it but I felt it was far too sweet so I probably stick to the 8oz of brown sugar next time even while quadrupling everything else. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is amazing. Drain the grease off of the bacon(cut up before you cook it and I use a full pound) before sprinkling with the brown sugar. I also add a tablespoon of Coleman's dry mustard and 1/2 a sauteed vidalia onion. So good!

I used a can of baked beans that was already flavored with brown sugar and bacon.  I was hoping that this recipe would somehow enhance the flavor enough to entice my bean-adverse children.  Unfortunately, neither I nor my children found it worth the effort.  Tasted like the same old baked beans to us.  Maybe you have to be a baked bean lover to really appreciate this recipe.

We love these beans! I have made them twice now. The first time, I doubled the beans but not the bacon and sugar, it was perfect and our dinner guests raved. My hubby says these are the best beans he's ever had :-) This time I did the recipe exactly as written, am just waiting to take them out of the oven and am sure they will be delicious. We serve these with a nice ham and scallop potatoes, what could be more comforting?? :0)

Great recipe.  I made it for a crowd this past weekend. It was a big hit.  However, since I made 30 servings, it took about 3 hours to bake.  Also, I added the chopped onion and dry mustard powder.  I would also fry the bacon till crisp before adding the sugar to the top of the bacon.  This wasn't specified and the bacon needed to be more done.

This was a great recipe!!! I used a little less bacon then what it called for but they were the best I've ever had. Next time I will add onion just for an added kick. Thanks-this is a keeper.

The best Baked Bean recipe I have found yet! Simple , quick and easy to make, and above all the whole family from youngest to oldest enjoyed it. The only change I made was to add a half medium onion finely chopped on top of the brown sugar when I cook my bacon.

My husband and dad loved this recipe! I doubled it using (2) 28-oz. cans of Van Camp's Pork and Beans.  I sliced up 1 lb of raw bacon into pieces and chopped up one yellow onion. I put the bacon and onion in a pan and topped it with 16 oz brown sugar. I cooked all of it for about 10 min over medium heat. I then mixed the now semi-cooked bacon, onions,  and brown sugar with the beans in a casserole dish. I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Had such amazing flavor and was nice and thick, not too sweet at all--just right! Thank you!

Easy way to take canned bake beans to the next level.  I followed several reviewers suggestion and added onion with a bit less brown sugar.  The guys raved about it.  It was devoured with no leftovers!

Whenever we have a cookout I am asked to bring the baked beans. I feel guilty that I am bringing something so easy to make and always popular. 

I add chopped onion. If I don't have bacon, I add bacon bits. I also add molasses. It makes it darker and richer. 

I bake in the oven covered for about  30 min. at 300 degrees.  Then I take the cover off and bake about 1 hour or more on 250. I try to stir every 15 min. This helps it get thicker so when I get the consistency I want I  am done.

I made suggested changes of 1/2 cup of sugar and added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. We thought they were great.

What an amazing recipe for baked beans! I wasn't quite sure what to do with the bacon grease and I didn't want to have something that was going to be totally artery clogging so I added about a quarter cup to the beans after I candied the bacon. I used Bush's original recipe baked beans and even with the candied bacon and a little bit of extra barbecue sauce I didn't find this to be too terribly sweet as some have said, but I'm also the kind of person who puts sugar on my biscuits and gravy so my views may be a bit skewed ;)

Did 2-28 ounce cans of Great Value Beans and mixed with one tsp. of dry mustard.  Cut up 12 ounces of turkey bacon, one onion, 4 fat free hot dogs (happened to have them sitting there in a zip lock), topped with 4 ounces of brown sugar and fried that up and let it simmer and soak up all the juices for about 45 minutes.  Mixed it all together and put in the oven for one hour at 400.....DELICIOUS!!!!  OMG, it was so good!  I can't believe it.  This is a recipe for a main meal....not a side!
