The only thing I did different was use Powdered Sugar instead of white sugar.  It came out just like the whipped cream frosting I've had from bakeries.  I WILL suggest the following:  make sure you use butter and not margarine or spread.  Also, really beat it well.  It takes awhile for the evap milk to start setting.

This recipe was one that I decided to try because it seemed easy and I had all the ingredients in the house.
Along with what other raters have to say, I found it quite waxy tasting when in the bowl, but when I tried it spread thinly on a cupcake, it tasted fine. I probably wouldn't be making it again, as there's nothing extraordinary about it and it just wasn't what I was looking for.

I tried this because I had limited ingredients in the house.  It turned out very waxy tasting and I didn't even use it on my cake.

I had a similar recipe but had lost it. 
This was pretty good.  I think mine used all butter.  If I were to make this again, I would subsitute the shortening with butter, I didn't enjoy the flavor as much.

This frosting was to thin and did not have a great flavor.  I had to keep putting the cake back in the refrigerator so the frosting would be managable.

The texture of this frosting was questionable.  I didn't like the regular granulated sugar in it, because it made the frosting crunchy.  I wish I'd tried powdered sugar.  The frosting didn't really have much of a flavor, but it did have a waxy feel like one other comment stated.  For flavor, I added a small box of orange jello mix and a couple extra tablespoons of evaporated milk.  I did not understand why the butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla needed to be beaten/mixed for 8-10 minutes.  This is excessive.  It's not like I'm making a froth or whipping egg whites.

I needed a quick recipe to frost funfetti cupcakes and I didnt have 10x sugar, so I tried this...I used real butter, crisco, and imported vanilla and it tasted like eating lard...The only thing I could think of to make it have a taste was to pour near a whole package of jello raspberry jello in it...It did help, but I won't be making this again

Sorry to give a bad review, but no matter what I tried from other reviewers--powdered sugar, extra vanilla, butter instead of margarine--it still turned out tasting like straight shortening. Very pretty frosting, though.

My husband LOVES this frosting, I add a little more sugar and vanilla to give the flavor a boost.

Waxy texture, very little taste. May have been fine for writing, but when I tried to write with it the liquid separated out and came out the top of my piping bag, leaving a dry, waxy paste in the bag that took forever to clean out. Don't waste your time with this frosting.

made this with much concern and after tasting it decided that I would not make it again, but since I had no other options at the time and the cake was needed the next day I used it and GLAD i did... I used it to ice the cake as well as pipe decor on it... The taste only improves with time... My cake turned out great...will be using this OFTEN...

I have been making this recipe for years. I have found the longer you let it mix the easier the sugar blends into the icing. I mix it for 10-minutes and I have found that the sugar almost melts into the mixture. If it is gritty at all by the time I serve the cake it is fine. This icing is requested by friends and family ALL the time. It is exceptional on a dark chocolate cake. I have also added cocoa powder to the sugar/shortening mix and it makes an excellant chocolate icing.

I was looking for a recipe without regular milk as my friend is lactose intolerant.  This recipe is a go!

To be honest, I tried really hard to make this frosting work. I couldn't handle the greasy-ness of it and there wasn't any flavor or "fluff" to it. I used powdered sugar and still nothing. At least I can say I tried it!
