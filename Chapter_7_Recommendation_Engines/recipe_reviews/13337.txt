I have made this soup countless times since 2006 and it is great every time. the only adjustments I made were to season my meat with garlic & onion powder, salt and pepper and to add 3 cloves of crushed garlic. I also added mixed veggies because that's what I had and prefer.

I made this soup a couple of days ago, and we really liked it a lot.  It's even better after a day or two in the fridge.  The only things I did differently is added a clove of garlic while the hamburger and onion was cooking, I added an extra can of beef broth to make it more soupy because I was afraid that the macaroni would soak up all the broth, I added 3 shakes of worcestershire sauce, some black pepper, and then I didn't add the macaroni until the very end so it wouldn't get mushy or soak up all the broth.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good, satisfying and easy soup. I made it even easier by throwing everything (hamburger already cooked) into the crockpot and setting it on low for the day while I was at work. Smelled wonderful when I got home and opened the door! Changed up by adding a couple of chopped shallots (instead of onion)and (2) cloves garlic, only (1) can stewed tomatoes, added a small can of tomato sauce (would like to try a can of V8), frz. corn instead of peas, left the pasta out and added (2) sliced carrots. I simply changed this according to what I would enjoy most in the soup but I am sure this would be just as good if followed exactly how written! Thanks for the post!

This is a great recipe! I wasn't sure if the tomatoes were supposed to be drained or not. I drained them, and the soup turned out well.

I'll be making this again.

I've made this countless times and it's always a hit with my boys, and they are very picky!   I also add the dry macaroni when I add the broth.  One less pot to wash!  The epitomy of comfort food!

I love this soup!  In fact, I am eating a bowl right now.  I have made this multiple times - sometimes I used frozen mixed vegetables...this time, I used frozen corn.  I think it would taste good with whatever you have on hand.  I chop the stewed tomatoes so that there aren't big chunks in the soup.    My kids like this too!

This was extremely bland. I reduced the liquid and added thyme, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, a dash of red wine, garlic, celery salt, carrots, a few squeezes of lemon. I'd give it 4 or 4.5 stars with my changes. Family loved it, even picky 9-year-old.

This was good, but I made some changes. I used Italian soy crumbles in place of beef and veggie broth. I also added cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, and replaced garlic salt with no-salt herb and garlic seasoning. It was classic comfort food, especially when served with a dollop of sour cream and homemade whole wheat bread!

As most reviewers did, I made a few adjustments to this recipe to suit what I had on hand.  I was short on pasta and added a small amount of ditalini and compensated for the shortage by adding a can of beans.  Since many had said it needed more flavor, I added some Mrs. Dash seasoning and some Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I also threw in the remains of a bag of frozen green beans.  Overall it was a very satisfying soup.

For a low-carb dieter like myself, I omitted the macaroni but I felt it still needed more broth. Very good recipe though. Next time I would probably add different veggies like celery or corn and add a bit of spice such as red pepper flakes...

I am a novice in the kitchen, so this recipe looked easy enough for me.  I had no idea it would still be such a tasty meal!  My family is sure to let me know if they don't like something, but I had not one critical word with this dish.  It's a keeper...  loved it!!

I like the soup. I thought is was good; however, my family did not like. I will not be making it again. If you are in a soup eating family it would be excellent for you.

Took a lot of doctoring!  Jacob & Tim liked, though.  Used crushed tomatoes - still too tomatoey for Ryan.  Added thyme, tons of worcestershire, garlic salt, onion powder

This turned out pretty good!  It just needs more flavor.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato soup.  Used a crockpot.

Wonderful starter recipe!  I fiddled with it a bit, and was so, so happy with the results.  First, as the beef was browning, I gently covered the meat with black pepper and oregano and added a clove of crushed garlic.  When it was really sizzling, I added about 1/2 a cup of cabernet and a healthy splash of worchestershire to add a little complexity, turned the heat up and let the wine cook away completely.    Meantime, I chopped the onion, as well as two carrots and about 4 stalks of celery, and tossed all that into the tomatoes (didn't drain 'em) and beef broth sitting ready in the crock pot.  Full disclosure:  I did not use the peas, cause I didn't have any on hand.   I added a little more oregano, and 3 crushed garlic cloves.  I used a very light hand with the salt, since the flavors can change so much in cooking.  Better to add at the end!  I added the meat, set the crock pot to low, and let it cook all day.  About half an hour prior to service, I made the pasta separate, and added it in 15 minutes before serving.  Enjoyed it with a hot crusty loaf of bread, a spring green salad, and a glass of cabernet.  Wonderful, wonderful.

This is easy and yummy! I made a few adjustments.  I am not a fan of peas so I used a bag of frozen corn.  Instead of two cans of tomatoes I used two cans of tomatoes and green chilies to spice it up a little.  I topped the coup with shredded cheddar cheese.

Delicious soup. The amount of pepper and salt can greatly affect the overall taste of this dish- take care and taste often as you season it.

This was pretty good as far as hamburger soup goes.  If I make it again I will add more spices and liquid.  I liked how easy it was to make though.

I love this soup.  Noticed in the listed of ingredients that carrots are not mentioned but in the directions it tells you to add carrots - how many carrots?

Made this last night, it was a hit. I topped with parmesan cheese, used less broth for a thicker soup, and  used diced fire roasted tomatoes in place of stewed because that is what I had. This will be a meal we will have often :)

very easy to make. I used the slow cooker on low all day...added corn, 3 garlic cloves, carrots and celery. I also seasoned the meat with salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before placing it in the slow cooker (cooked). My husband had three bowls!

I made a few changes and my family loved this! We don't like stewed tomatoes so I added a can of condensed tomato soup instead. i also added corn instead of peas, and sauteed onions and lots of garlic with the meant. FANTASTIC!!!

We enjoyed making this soup, we added diced carrots, 1 potato, fresh minced garlic, red bell pepper and a red fresno pepper for a little heat, i sauteed all the veggies except the can corn and the tomatoes with the meat and then added 2 26oz cartons of beef stock, I also used creole season, seasoning salt and worchestshire to the meat mixture, we topped it with german gouda cheese(we are in Germany) and ate it with fresh baked german bread and butter and then i stirred in a little sour cream in my kids bowls bc they complained about the spice but it made it really yummy so next time i will be adding sour cream to my own as well. Oh instead of stewed tomatoes i used petite diced and no peas just a can of corn. This recipe is such a great simple base recipe that you can change things up and make it to your liking, thanks so much Laurie for posting it.

Quite good.  Used 5 cups of water and 3 tablespoons of boullion granules.  One can stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatos. Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, basil and oregano. Tossed the pasta in a little olive oil after cooking, and kept separate from soup. Pasta doesn't get over cooked that way.

I just posted this review under Hamburger Soup IV!  Oops!  This is the recipe that I made last week and LOVED!  I didn't have carrots so I didn't use them.  Finely chopped the onion and sauteed with beef.  Threw in frozen green beans and some chopped celery.  Used a big can of whole tomatoes, which I chopped up before I threw them in.  I used potatoes cut into small pieces and small pasta.  It tasted so much like the Chunky soup that I made small hamburger patties to use in it this week!!  I'm also going to use some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, because the more it resembles the Chunky Hamburger soup, the more my kids will eat!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This was really good and EASY! I did add a few things like previous reviews recommended though. I added frozen veggies, omitted the   macaroni, added diced potatoes, a few splashes of Worcestershire's, some Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper.  It came out awesome and perfect for the cold damp weather!!

Not too bad at all. I tripled the recipe for a church function. I had a little bit of frozen corn and added that as well as a very generous splash of worchestershire sauce - that was the magic touch. It needed a little something and that made it very good.

Fry beef & onion in large pot first with seasonings, like garlic powder, salt & pepper. Than add everything else. I used chopped whole carrots & celery, rather than a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  I used 1 to 1& a half cups uncooked barley instead of pasta & just threw it in the pot with all other ingredients. Pasta can sometimes go mushy if cooked too long. Barley really thickens everything up. I added more water, a beef bouillon cube & a can of tomatoe soup to thin it a bit. Was like a stew & very filling.
Cook 1-2 hours or more on med to low.

This is good. I made it more spicy.  TIP cook your macaroni to just  about tender...then keep them separate to add just what you need for serving.  Keeps them from getting mushy and absorbing the liquid, especially if you know you will have leftovers or freeze some.

Great soup.  I did have to make quite a few substitutions because it was snowy and I wasn't going out.  Instead of stewed tomato I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce, tsp of salt and pepper, 1 bay leaf and 4 cloves of garlic.  Didn't have the peas and carrots so added about 1/2 cup of corn  and 1 cup of green beans in addition to the carrots.

I read a lot of the reviews and no one wrote that 1 cup of macaroni would be too much!  The first bowl was good and then the macaroni started to swell and soaked up ALL of the juice.   :o(  I would only add 1/2 cup macaroni next time or I might try rice. I used 1 can stewed and 1 can diced tomato.  I added a bay leaf, some Mrs Dash, parsley, fresh carrots and frozen peas, celery and a heaping tablespoon of Better than Bouillon (Beef).

I thought this tasted good. I have a homemade hamburger soup I prefer to make. This was fine for ease, to avoid chopping a bunch of vegetables, but it is a little salty. I used lean beef, mixed up beef broth using beef base, and subbed one of the cans with tomato juice I had to use up. My mixed vegetables had corn and green beans, which was fine. I did one canned stewed tomatoes and one petite diced low sodium. Before adding any pasta, it looked really watery. So, I decided to just add the pasta, dry, to the soup. That made it less watery and acidic. It was between a thick soup and goulash, then, which I prefer. I got no less than 6 servings at 292 calories made as written here.

This recipe was fantastic. Changed peas & carrots to peas & corn. The only other thing I would do differently would be to add macaroni to each serving rather than add macaroni to the entire pot of soup as the macaroni absorbed a lot of the broth and became mushy.

This was very good.  I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I did not have onion, so I bumped up the onion powder.  I also did not have stewed tomatoes, so I substituted diced tomatoes.  I also had some fresh mushrooms and yellow bell pepper that I added.  I was also out of beef stock, so I substituted beef soup starter.  Lastly, I had frozen mixed vegetables, so I added those.  I took the advice of some others and browned the beef with garlic and seasoned the meat. I  also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and some parsley.  The soup turned out very good, I will definitely make this again!

This was great quick and easy.  I tweaked it with a bit of italian seasoning and onion powder and garlic.  Great to throw together on a weeknight and even better the next day.

This was so delicious.  I loved that it was hearty but didn't make you feel so full you were sick.  I wished I had a big loaf of crusty bread for it - I'll be sure to buy one nex time. Yumm!

Great base recipe! I only had 1 can of Italian style stewed tomatoes so I used that and a 15oz can of tomato sauce.  I added some garlic and 2 sliced up stalks of celery with the onions and meat and a bit of basil at the end.  I only had canned veggies so used them too, a can of peas and a can of corn.  Should call it Canned Soup LOL!  Mine came out more like a stew but it was absolutely wonderful with toasted garlic bread for sopping up the juice.  Thank you for putting up this recipe!

I have to say I'm surprised by the ratings.  I was excited to make it as it seemed like a very versitile soup and inexpensive.  I won't be making it again.  I managed to save it by adding some chili beans and a half a package of chili mix to it and the family ate it but....

This was a great soup for a cold, rainy day. I followed other suggestions of adding the pasta last, and I also added carrots instead of peas (just personal preference). For any other vegetable-lovers, I could see just about any vegetable working very well in this soup!

This was a great base. I didn't have any broth so I added some water and taco seasoning to get the liquid I wanted. I cooked the meat and onions first and then simmered with the pasta and frozen veggies til the pasta was cooked.

I was looking for something nice and easy to make for dinner, and also something I had all the ingredients for (haven't been able to make it to grocery store lately :)). This was perfect! The thing I love about soup is it's easy to tweak it to how you like it. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added some Worcestershire sauce and some italian seasoning. I used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes as well. I also added some extra macaroni, and just used frozen peas and carrots. Doing a taste test, I think it could use a little bit more seasoning, so I'll throw some more in. I think next time I'll also add some potatoes like others did. I think that would be a great addition. Overall, great recipe!

Pretty tasty. I used a bag of frozen veggies and a can of stewed tomatoes. I had no idea the stewed tomatoes would be so big. Next time I will get the diced tomatoes. I will definitely be making this again. A good hot soup for a cold Winter day. :)

Yummy!
I thing the recipe was good as a starter ~ but I did change some things like everyone else did.

Firstly, we don't eat beef much, so I never have it on hand.  I made it with ground chicken and used chicken broth instead of the beef broth.  I used 1/4 cup sliced baby carrots (next time I will leave them out as my family really doesn't care for cooked carrots).  I had 3 small ears of frozen corn that I nuked for a minute, then sliced the kernals in the soup.  I used 1 large jar of stewed tomatoes that I canned from the summer.  Didn't have the peas, so obviously that wasn't in there ~ and I used dried onion as my middle son will not eat cooked onions.  I also didn't have macaroni noodles, so I used medium shells.  I put a couple of shakes of Worchestershire sauce in and it was great!  I served garlic bread on the side (my version, hamburger buns, halved, butter spread on and some garlic salt w/ oregano). 

It was really good!

This is a fabulous recipe but I had to tweak it up a bit.  First of all, I simmered it for several hours but I made the mistake of simmering it with the noodles the whole time.  The problem with that, was the noodles became very soggy, so I will add them next time about 15 minutes or so before I serve the soup.  I also felt the soup was a bit bland with the seasonings, so I added more garlic salt and added some garlic powder and a little italian seasonings. My husband also added some red pepper flakes to his bowl as well.  We had this soup with some hard bread and it was an excellent meal!

Exactly what I was looking for... something different to do with ground beef.  I added a few cloves of crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt, mixed vegetables, 1 small can of tomato sauce and cumin.  Very delicious.  Thanks a bunch!

very good basic soup. I doubled the recipe and used a can of corn and a can of mixed veggies. I also cut up 2 cooked potatoes and added them. Did not add the macaroni this time. Served with corn bread was great!

My husband and I really liked this soup.  A few changes that I made were: add 1 pkg. of chopped frozen spinach and 1/2 pkg. of frozen green beans (both thawed), used a different shaped pasta (smaller), and added Worcestershire Sauce (few shakes).  I used all diced tomatoes with Italian Seasoning in them.  Real Good....and easy.

I loved this.  Make sure to add enough salt to bring out all of the flavours.

This was good.  Looked a little blah, so I added carrots, celery, and some herbs.  My very picky 11 year old loved it.

Good and hearty soup! I did what someone suggested and added a generous dash of Worchesterchire sauce to give the broth more flavor.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 cans of stewed.
