I used half the whipped topping, omitted the bananas, added grapes, and used pineapple chunks instead of crushed pineapple. It was delicious and just like the one my grandma used to make. Definitely a keeper for future family get togethers!!!

I served this with Easter dinner and everybody had seconds.  I used an 8 oz. container of Cool Whip instead of the 16 oz.  It was perfect consistency.  Also I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the oranges or not so I played it safe and drained them.

This was really yummy!  If you add a small box of orange jello mix, it gives it a tint of orange color and a good flavor!

Great Recipe, but had to omit some ingredients so husband could eat it. I used the mandarin oranges, pineapple, marshmallows, and added bananas to individual bowls. Since the banana turns it's color overnight. I also substituted sourcream instead of whipped topping. I really enjoyed having this with my meal for dinner, as well as husband. Easy & Fast to make. Will make recipe again.

I used the juice from the pineapple and oranges to coat the bananas before I put them in with the rest of the mixture, so the bananas wouldn't turn brown.  Left out the nuts (don't like them) and cherries and used low-fat cool whip.  Everyone loved it and it stayed good for several days in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

I first fell in love with ambrosia salad a couple years ago when my sister's mother-in-law made it. So i finally got this recipe for thanksgiving this year and LOVED it! I think the other reviewers are right though maybe less whipped topping.

Wonderful!  I used a 15-oz. can of mandarin oranges instead of 11 oz., and a 20-oz. can of pineapple *chunks* instead of 8 oz. crushed (reserving liquid) - would make those changes again.  I added 1/2 cup pineapple juice to the final salad.  Note that 1 cup of cherries is equal to a 10-oz. bottle (be sure and drain it).  I left out the whipped topping - just a personal preference.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was good. I think the recipe calls for way, way too much whipped topping. I used an 8 oz container of Cool Whip because I didn't realize the recipe called for a 16 oz container and I thought that was too much. So it would have been major overkill if I had actually used what the recipe called for. I think 4 oz would probably be enough.

I made this for a picnic and it was very good.  I think using half the whipped topping is a good idea.

Used walnuts instead of pecans, used 1/2 whipped topping and 1/2 sour cream, and added a can of fruit cocktail....excellent!!  Don't see ambrosia salad with bananas in it....this is yummy!

This was delicious. A long time ago at an office holiday party, someone brought this in and I've been looking for this. I had to do a search on the Internet with the ingredients I remembered because I didn't know what it was called.  I agree with the others though--I think 16 oz is too much whipped topping. I was about to fold it all in when I realized as I was putting it in that I already had so much (I had about 2/3 in--I think 8 oz would be perfect).  The bananas are a very nice touch--they go well with the cream.

Yummy! I used chunked pineapple, omitted the bananas and pecans added halved grapes and reduced the whipped topping to 8oz. I also added some of the fruit juice. The only thing I might do differently next time is reduce the amount of coconut so the texture isn't so overwhelming.

Delicious and a hit at the get-together! Easy to make too. I used all the ingredients but only used 8 oz of whip cream. Also, I cut the cherries in half. Recipe doesn't say to drain the juice from the can of oranges but I did anyway. I only refrigerated for about 2 hours.

This is a delicious fruit salad, but only after I made some changes.  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks, a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges, 1 banana helved lengthwise then sliced, 1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries (I'm not a fan of maraschno cherries) and 1 cup flaked coconut.  For the dressing, I used an electric mixer to whip together 2 cups low fat sour cream, 1/3 cup Splenda and 1 tsp vanilla (instead of Cool Whip and narshmallows).  I gently mised this all together and chilled the salad for about 3 hours before sering.  It was delicious!!  Next time, I will cut down on the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups or less.  I omitted the nuts this time for the sake of a guest who has a tree nut allergy. But, I'll add them if serving this to my family. Now I have a recipe for a very good fruit salad!

This doesn't have enough flavor for me.  I used less than 8 oz. of whipped topping, which was plenty.  I used the colored marshmellows, but they have an artificial fruity taste that I didn't care for.  Next time I make ambrosia, I will use the white marshmellows.  Also, a friend of mine gave me an ambrosia recipe years ago which called for a box of instant pistachio pudding, and I remember it was delicious.  This doesn't seem to compare.

I tasted this salad when i went to visit my sister in Conneticutt and loved it. So i made it again and everyone loved it. I did use only 8oz of whipped topping when the consistency was perfect.  And i put the bananas on the side for who ever want it some. But still taste great with it.  I totally recommend this recepi.

Great Dessert!  I altered it a little for my kids' taste.  Took out the coconut and used chunk pineapple rather than crushed.  I also added a bit of sour cream and used Sugar Free Cool Whip.  Delicious, healthy after dinner dessert!

This was okay. I don't think I like the marshmallows all that much. I didn't use coconut because I'm allergic. I also left out the pecan because my mom doesn't have teeth. I added extra cherries. My mom used to make a better version that was just fruit cocktail and whipped cream.

This is a wonderful taste, however my advice is to use name brand fruit cans like Delmonte or Dole. I made it once with generic cans of fruit and it was blah. Otherwise it's great. I also used a can of tropical fruits and that tasted better, a little more variety.

I made this salad yesterday and its fabulous! I did what another reviewer said about coating the bananas first in the juice from the pineapple. I did change a couple things. I used pineapple tidbits and grapes. I also didn't have mini marshmellows so I cut them into small pieces. Additionally, I used low fat store brand cool whip and from reviewers suggestion, I bought the 8oz container and didn't even use all of it.

Great recipe though I made some changes.  I drained the mandarin oranges (wasn't specified in recipe), used pineapple tidbits since I didn't have the crushed on hand, and used only 8 ounces (small container) of whipped topping.  This was really great and received many complements.  I think 16 ounces of whipped topping would have been too much.

There's two great things about ambrosia salad. One, you can make it out of what you have on hand (usually most people have the ingredients in their kitchen at any given time) and two, it's a reminder for most people of holiday's past.

I used one large banana (tossed with a little lemon juice to keep the banana pieces from browning), added a little sour cream and omitted the coconut. I also used multi-colored marshmallows.

This will go well with my turkey dinner tonight. So good and so easy.

This was a big hit at my niece's babyshower and in my daughter's class.  I made a few changes that really went over well.  I left out the bananas and used strawberry whipped topping and it was great!!!!

the coconut and didn't miss it.  Used extra pineapple.  Also used about 12 oz of cool whip instead of 16oz.  Some reviews recommended half, but I did not find this to be enough cool whip.

Very easy recipe!  Followed everything exactly as written. Reminded of my great-aunt's Ambrosia Salad from when I was growing up. This will be a staple at large dinners for our family.

I THOUGHT THERE WAS TOO-O-O MUCH COCONUT IN THIS RECIPE.  I PUT IN ONLY 1/2 CUP AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER. I ALSO CUT THE  AMOUNT OF MARSHMALLOWS IN HALF.  MUCH BETTER.  YOU COULD TASTE THE FLAVOR OF THE FRUIT MUCH CLEARER.

I added extra mandarin oranges and maraschino cherries, but otherwise no changes. This was an enormous hit for Thanksgiving. And so easy!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Mother too said it tasted "gourmet!" At first, I used ingredients from Winco and it was perfect. The second time, I used some walmart ingredients instead and it was a little too sweet!

This is very sweet, so don't give this to anyone that cannot tolerate sugar!

Followed directions except left out the pecans and reduced the cherries.  I used 2 cups of Dream Whip for the whipped topping.  I can’t imagine how the topping could be reduced without the recipe becoming dry.  It turned out pretty well, except it was a LOT of coconut.  The coconut make it kind of gritty.

I would give this 5 stars, my family loved it. I am not a fan of ambrosia salad, but this was good. I don’t like marshmallows, so I am biased. But I will make this again for my family. I did not add the bananas, but I did add green and red grapes.

I added a block of softened cream cheese and added some sugar or splenda to sweeten the cream cheese.  It gave it such a creamy flavor that stood up to the fruit.  I also omitted the marshmellows.

I made this for my family for thanksgiving but I wasn't able to try it because I'm incredibly allergic to pineapple. Is there something I can substitute for it that won't compromise the integrity or flavor

It was good. Very customizable recipe. I didn't like it as written. Would omit coconut next time.

I omitted coconut flakes, because my children don't like them. I only used 8 oz of cool whip and that was more than enough. It was a hit with my family.

This is my son's favorite fruit-type salad! I just don't care for bananas so I leave them out. I added pecans which I haven't added before to other ambrosias. This is a great recipe!
