This was excellent! My entire family loved! I goofed and bought boneless thighs. I used 5 boneless thighs and instead of boiling in water, I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 water. It came out great! One of those meals that warms you up on a cold night! Thank for the recipe!

This recipe was SOOO delicious. I made it on a snowy day, and it took a while to do but it was worth it. Everything mixed together nicely and the tastes complimented each other. Very very good. we had leftovers for about 4 days. I HIGHLY recommend this dish if you have some time.

My husband loved this dish, and rated it a 10!! It was a little on the hot side for me, but this dish really does need some heat. I couldn't find turkey kielbasa, so I used smoked turkey sausage (looked like kielbasa) instead. Otherwise, followed exact recipe. I will make again if my husband requests it.

Great love of your recipe from SC!

8x bone-in chicken thighs
4x cups chicken broth and the rest water (I did by eye, really)
1x onion (i freaking' minced instead of diced it)
2x chicken bullion cubes
1x turkey butterball sausage 14oz (big pack)
2x family size rice-aroni (whatever flavor, I got chicken flavor)
2x tablespoons of ground Cheyenne pepper
1x tablespoon garlic salt
2x tablespoon Italian seasoning
1x tablespoon onion salt
1x family size can of cream of mushroom (22oz)

put in chicken, 4 cans of chicken broth and the rest with water till chicken is covered. put bullion in and set to high till boiling. turn to low so it simmers till chicken is soft. ~50 mins. while chicken boiled I minced the onion and diced the sausage to set aside.

after 50 minutes. I took chicken out and filtered out any thick fat floating around the pot. hand pulled the chicken from the fat/bone while tossing chicken back in along with the sausage and onion. I put the rice, salts, and peppers and left the can of mushroom out for now. Stirred. Kept heat on low since it kept simmering..

Checked every 5 minutes to see if rice was soft. I added chicken broth as needed to make thickness what I wanted, added cream of mushroom once rice was soft. Turned off stove and served once it stopped simmering.

I served this alongside peas and collared greens. 
Awesome comfort food for cold days. I changed the recipe around for convenience and what we had in our store. Took me about 2.5 hrs to make. I gave 5/5!

Super easy and good! Followed recipe except with two minor changes:

-Pressure cooked the thighs instead of boiled to cut down on time- pressure cooked for 8 minutes, so the recipe was a fairly quick one. Poured in just 2 cups of water and 1 boullion. Added chicken stock from a carton to adjust stock afterward so there was 4.5 cups

-Added dried cayenne in addition to red pepper (cut up two whole, dried peppers)

Very good, quick, and tasty!

Loved this, rest of the family could have lived without the kielbasa.  Not too difficult but does take a little time.

Loved it! Making it for my large crew to nibble on all weekend, I doubled the batch. We left out the red pepper flakes since some of us don't care for much spice/heat. Husband says he'd like a little more kick so he's adding a dash of hot sauce to his individual serving.
We'll definitely have again this winter!

I love this dish! I substituted green pepper as I only had greena and red. I also used cut thick chicken breast into to chunks and added some butter to subtitute for the fat that the chicken thighs would have given the dish. I used a little Adobo seasoning and used two instead of three bouillon cubes, Other than that I kept everything else the same. It was super yummy and plenty for the fam and for lunch the next day.

This is so yummy and satisfying!  It is one of my fiance's favorites and mine too.  I love it because it truly is a one pot meal so clean up is a breeze.  
I added mushrooms, used boneless chilcken breasts cut into small cubes, and cream of celery soup.  (I only made this many changes because I was trying to use what I had on hand.)  It was amazing!  It is my newest staple dinner, and I love how you can easily add/change it and it is still so tasty!

Will definitely make this again. Changes - used 6 chicken legs, dehydrated peppers, smoked polish sausage, no red pepper or other hot stuff, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, added 1 cup  chicken broth and 2 more cups water and had to add more water as we reheated this.

Yummy! I will make this again! Would have been 5 stars but I adapted it somewhat: Use precooked chicken or turkey to save time (I used leftover turkey tenderloin). 1/2 lb. of smoked sausage was just right for us. I used 1 whole red pepper,  1 whole green pepper, and 8 oz. sliced mushrooms. Don't add these until the last 5 minutes. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used 1/8 t. of cayenne. Best of all, skip the can of soup! It's tasty without adding more sodium and processed ingredients.

Really good! The stock from the chicken was not enough- I had to add some water, maybe because I cooked too much off.. will certainly make again!!

All 5 family members gave two thumbs up--this NEVER happens. I used a couple of timesaver variations: 1. I subbed a grocery store rotisserie chicken then had the white meat for next day use--used that stock and partial container of broth. 2.  Subbed spicy andouille sausage and  sautéed w/pre-diced container of bell pepper/onion mix prior to adding liquids.  3. Did not add mushroom soup.  Served with fresh green beans and hush puppies.  Excellent!

We loved this!!  I had a rotisserie chicken I needed to use up.  So I just used 4 1/2 cups of water (added 3 tsp. bouillon) to make the broth.  I also sautéed the bell peppers and onion in a little butter, then added the chicken and kielbasa to it, then added it all toward the end of the rice cooking.  It had a nice kick and was delicious.  Definitely a keeper!  (It makes a ton!  More like 8-10 servings!)

This came out really great!  I had to substitute carrots and celery for the bell peppers and left out the bullion cubes but otherwise followed the recipe. It even tasted great before the soup was mixed in at the end, next time I may not add the soup. Don't leave out the red pepper flakes!
