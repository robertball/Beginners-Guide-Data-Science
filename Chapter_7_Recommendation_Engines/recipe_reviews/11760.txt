I don't think this recipe is intended to replace real gnocchi, it's meant to be a GREAT short cut alternative! Hence the 5 star rating.  If it was being compared to real gnocchi, I'd probably only give it a 4.  I really was expecting to hate this recipe because I HATE instant mashed potatoes.  You would never know there was anything instant with these gnocchi.  On a whim I decided to serve Good Friday dinner, I was a little strapped for time and served these to my Italian husband and mother in law.  My husband knew what was in them and said they were not as good as the real thing, but very very close!  I didn't tell my mother in law, she had second helpings and liked them!  I would use this again!  It takes some time to prepare, but it saved time from peeling the potatoes, boiling, ricing, letting them cool so you can add eggs, etc.  As others have mentioned add flour gradually.  Dough should be soft not stiff.  Too much flour makes tough gnocchi.

I grew up making gnocchi with my Italian grandmother and she would substitute instant potatoes sometimes. I never knew a good ratio though so I was so glad when I found this because with real potatoes is a lot of work when you have 2 year old twins. I will definitely be making this again. I didn't need as much flour as the recipe called for. It does get very sticky but that is how it should be. After you mix it all together into a dough, if you put it on a floured cookie sheet in the fridge for at least 15 minutes, it will make it a ton easier to work with. It will get stickier as it warms though. Also, if you roll them 1/2"  thick, they will be less dumpling like as some people stated. I found this recipe to be extremely good and will definitely be making them again!

Learn from my mistakes:  I didn't follow this recipe the first time, assuming the ratio of liquid to potato flakes on the box of instant potatoes was correct.. Big, big mistake.  Follow this recipe EXACTLY and the Gnocchi will turn out fabulously!  I did add some chopped spinach to the dough for color and a hint of flavor, and served it with a tomato-vodka-cream sauce.  My friends are still raving about it!!!!  Oh, let some people come early to help you roll and cut  the gnocchi pieces, it was a fun group task...

Wow!  Thank you so so much for this recipe.  We LOVE gnocchi, but had never considered making them at home (only restaurants and the occasional store bought).  I was looking for recipes that would freeze well and stumbled upon this one.  Excellent!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and seasoned with rosemary instead of pepper.  The rosemary flavor jumped out beautifully in the finished product.  I also added a bit of Romano cheese to the dough.  I couldn't taste it so it either needs more or should just be left out.  I want to emphasize that my husband is a food snob.  He has eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the U.S.  He never "LOVES" what I make.  It is always "okay" or "fine."  A constant critic of gnocchi in restaurants, he loved this one!  I could see trying to make it a little lighter in texture, fiddling with flavors, etc, but this is a great base recipe to work with.  Enjoy!

Wow!  Gnocchi DOES NOT get any easier then this recipe!  I don't like instant spuds like everyone else, but you can't taste them in this recipe.  I agree they needed a little kick so I added some finely minced fresh basil, and garlic salt to the dough.  I also used the fork "dent and pull" method to set the ridge pattern in them. People say you should make those little indentations with a fork so that the sauce has something to cling to.  It did work and there were little puddles of sauce hidden in all the wrinkles.  YUM-O!  I'm thrilled the other rater mentioned they freeze well too! Another perk!

Can I just say WOW.  I never knew fresh gnocchi could be this easy.  Granted, dough is always a pain to work with, but this was very simple and took no time at all.  I recommend being heavy handed with seasonings and adding seasoning salt, garlic powder, rosemary and Italian seasoning to the dough.  As suggested by others, I would add some Romano next time myself.  And I would double this recipe if feeding another person, seeing as I ate the whole batch myself no problem!  They were delicious with a bottled Alfredo sauce!  Bon appetit!

This is a very good recipe for what it is.  Nothing is ever going to compare to real made-from-scratch gnocchi, but these come pretty darm close.  I'm excited to try some of the flavor variations that others have mentioned.  Just two notes:  Keeping the size of each dumpling quite small (about the size of your thumbnail or a bit bigger) will produce a better result.  Also, I didn't need anything even close to 1 1/2 c. of flour.  I doubt I used even half of that.  So, add the flour very slowly--too much will result in dense, tough gnocchi.

after reading the stellar reviews i couldn't resist making this gnocchi recipe. overall i thought the taste was pretty good but my boyfriend loved them. cut the size of your gnocchi a little smaller because they puff up during the cooking process. this dish served well with the "tomato cream sauce for pasta" recipe also on this website. thanks sandy!

this recipe is very handy and lets you serve a dish of gnocchi in no time at all. Well, so they are not THE real thing (believe me, I know what I'm talking of, I'm Italian, my mum makes them starting from boiling potatoes an all). But this process is definitely quicker and not so messy!!!

So easy!!!! And just as good as the ones I just paid $14/plate for at a fancy italian restaurant. I will be making again and again. Even had a native born Italian try them and she loved them too.

I'm always trying new things so I decided to attempt this last night since my husband LOVES gnocchi & often orders it at Olive Garden. I trippled the batch & invited my mother in law over who had never tried it before. Now, keep in mind I've never made gnocchi a day in my life before last night. My husband always likes what I cook (not sure if I'm that good of a cook or if he's really just not picky lol) but last night he told me this was the best meal I'd ever made. My mother in law raved about it & told me it was restaurant quality. Granted, I did make my own garlic cream sauce w/ spinach & mushrooms to serve over it along w/ sliced chicken & spicy italian sausage but my husband told me that just the gnocchi & sauce together would have made a great meal, & that's impressive because he is definitely a meat eater. The only thing I really did differently to the gnocchi themselves, is I added italian seasoning, garlic & onion powder so they wouldn't be quite so bland if eaten alone & did put indentations in them w/ a fork to hold sauce and look more traditional. I also served them w/ bruschetta (usually you would use french bread but I had some homemade bread that needed to be used &worked wonderfully-just drizzl olive oil on bread, cover w/ diced garlic, tomatoes & onions & cover w/ mozzarella& bake @ 375 for appx 20 min & broil to brown) which complimented it wonderfully. So, thank you for this awesome recipe, it will definitely be making it into the rotation of dish options.

For quick gnocchi, this was absolutely incredible!  My husband and I discovered gnocchi shortly after we married at a little Italian hole-in-the-wall not far from where he was stationed.  We both LOVED it and have ordered it nearly every time we eat Italian!  This was my first attempt at making it homemade.  I agree with some others that it isn't quite as tender as in the restaurant, but I think I may have over-kneaded my dough too.  It's a bit of a mess to make but I had a happy hubby, so I'll come back to this one again and again!  Tip: after rolling out my "ropes," I snipped off gnocchi-size bits with my kitchen shears -- MUCH easier than a knife.  Also, lay your gnocchi separately on a floured tray or cutting board before you boil -- I heaped mine in a bowl and they stuck TERRIBLY!  I had to re-roll and re-cut them.  Thanks for a great dinner!

I tried using potato beads (LDS cannery kind) instead of flakes and they turned out pretty tasty. I cut my salt down to 3/4 tsp because it seemed like a lot, and they were fine, though next time I'll try the full tsp. The only other change I made was the amt of flour. I only needed 1 cup of flour to get a stiff dough. 1 1/2 cups would have made them way too dense. I had some left over hunts spaghetti sauce, so I made a simple roux/white sauce, dumped in the hunts and some italian seasoning, and it was a pretty tasty improvised creamy tomato sauce, and was the perfect compliment to the gnocchi.

I made this in a pinch because I couldn't find the whole wheat store-bought gnocchi I always get. I will never buy it again! I made as is, doing 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. Tasted exactly the same as the store-bought brand but waaaaaaaaay cheaper!

I found this recipe labor intensive for what it was.  Although we liked the gnocchi, I wouldn't make this recipe again.  First, you can only make a few at a time, so we did not really get to eat as a family. We have a local brand of frozen that are just as good or better.  Sorry!

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!! I loved this recipe, it was so easy its a crime! My only modification was in the amount of flour. Gnocchi is supposed to dissolve in your mouth you shouldn't have to chew it. I only used a 1/4 cup of flour and they turned out delicious.

This was really good, I used about 1/4 cup less flour then the recipe said and added some italian spices to the dough.  I also refrigerated the dough before working with it and froze the gnocchi before cooking it

SO GOOD!  My husband and daughter loved this- he said it was better than what we have previously bought in the stores!  Made some for my in-laws as a quick lunch when they were over and they loved it too!  (I tripled the recipe and used the half that I had frozen-  it was as good as the fresh!)  Used only 3 cups of flour; added one at a time and stirred in (remember, I tripled the recipe)  Also added Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  Make sure you flour everything (countertop, hands, knife and fork for teh dents)  will definitely make again.

This was so quick and easy. Instead of using water with the instant potato mix, I used chicken broth... and used the roasted garlic instant potato mix. It turned out super yummy!!! Totally saves a lot of time!! Thank you!!

Awesome, quick, easy recipe!  I have loved gnocchi since I was a little girl and used to go to a wonderful Italian Restaurant in the South Chicago suburbs and I've never tried making them myself!  This brought back memories!

My three year old enjoyed helping and it was very fast and simple.  I only used about a cup of flour, and tried different sizes, some with the fork marks and some without.  Overall I liked smaller gnocchi without the fork marks, but they were ALL fantastic!  Thank you, it's a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  I love gnocchi-I've only had from restaurants.  The thought of all the potato work scared me away from trying to make it at home so when I saw this recipe I thought I'd try it.  SOOOOO glad I did!  I only needed about half the four, I didn't use pepper and I added onion and garlic salt. My huband tried them first and said they were better than restaurant-I didn't believe him until I tried them myself-they ARE better!!! Delicious!!!

This was so good!  I've will never go back to old-fashioned, real potato gnocchi.  I made this recipe exactly, except I added 1/2 c. grated parmesan and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Because of that, I used slightly less flour than called for.  Also, I made it about 8 hours in advance, refrigerated it, then rolled and cut it just before boiling it.  I would completely recommend you try it!  Just as good as real potatoes and 100 times better than store bought.

I made this without the egg b/c my son is allergic to eggs. I used 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the egg. It turned out fine and my kids loved them!

I was very surprised with this recipe. I was raised on Italian food and very skeptical about this recipe.  Having some potato flakes on hand I thought I'd give them a try, I wasn't dissapointed.  Now these aren't as good as a ricotta cheese gnocchi, but all things considered I'd make these again since I normally have the simple ingredients on hand.

So good, and so easy! Be sure to roll the gnocchi thin. I added seasonings to the dough, and served the gnocchi w/ sage brown butter. The best thing you can possibly do with instant mashed potatoes :)

Made it with instant sweet potatoes to test out for a side for Thanksgiving.  They were very light!  I just did a browned butter sauce, but will use some gravy on them for Thanksgiving.  My 3 and 5 year olds ate them up!

I use leftover mashed potatoes and get a better texture to the Gnocchi, more like the real thing.

Excellent recipe. Second time making it.  I made a double batch since one batch is never enough.  I added fresh basil and garlic salt to the recipe.

These were great. I used 1 cup of flour, as suggested by others, and kept getting a little more flour on the board to roll them out. I put a couple TBS of dry crushed basil and some garlic powder in the egg mixture. Hubby and I ate the whole recipe. These were much better and more tender than store bought gnocchi. Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipe!!  BTW I am Italian and have tried to duplicate my aunt's homemade gnocchi many times, what a mess!! I will never try to make them from boiled potatoes again.

These are great!  I will never buy another store bought gnocch again!!!!  Just make sure you make a double batch because they go fast!  I followed the directions exactly escept I don't add salt to anything I make.  I also let the dough sit in the fridge for 15 minutes as another reviewer suggested.
I also roll each with my fork after I cut them!  YUMMY!

DELISH!  I have never made Gnocchi before and this recipe made it very simple! I used the 4 cheese instant potatoes and added some Italian seasoning to the dough to give some added flavor. I just served with a red sauce and this was GREAT!  Thanks!

This is EXCELLENT! I was reminiscing about eating gnocchi in Campo de Fiori in Rome on our vacation, and was inspried to make my own.  I was going to do a ricotta gnocchi, but I thought it may be too heavy/fattening.  I was so pleased to find this recipe.  It is awesome! You cannot tell there are instand mashed potatoes in the dough.  I added some chopped rosemary and garlic powder to the dough mixture.  They were so flavorful!  I made a sauce using diced tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, basil and Italian blend cheeses.  My husband and I loved it!  The only thing I would say is  to double or triple the quantity. I always like a little bit of leftovers to pack for my hubby's lunches...

This is an excellent gnocchi recipe. I dreaded making the traditional potato gnocchi-the boiling, peeling and putting the potatoes through the ricer is very labour intensive. This recipe gives you the same flavor with very little effort. I used my Kitchen Aid to mix and then knead the dough. No need to only put a few gnocchi in boiling water at a time. If you use all the flour as listed they will not stick or fall apart. Thanks for sharing!

I had never tried Gnocchi - though I had heard of it before.  Yesterday, my husband and I were having lunch at a fancy Italian restaurant and they had Gnocchi on the menu - for $17.50.  I wanted to try it, but I didn't want to spend that much money, so I came home and searched for a Gnocchi recipe.  I happened to have all the ingredients for this one on hand.  Though I am not a fan of instant potatoes - this didn't have that "instant" taste.  It was quick and easy to make - my 9-year old son rolled out the dough and cut it into bite-size pieces, while I did the cooking.  We loved it!  I had mine with some parmesan cheese - he ate his out of a bowl like he was eating chips.  I can't wait to try it out on my husband with marinara sauce.  Thank you!

Fantastic. I pinched off pieces and shaped them by hand --not pretty, but easy-- which worked beautifully. Drop them in 6 to 10 at a time just till floating and pull em out. I used Betty Crocker Roasted Garlic flakes and worked like a charm! Also, used slightly less flour than called for.

They turned out quite well, but the three star rating is because they were fairly bland.  I imagine the flavor is supposed to come from the sauce.  I will try them again and the next time will add a bit more spice.  More pepper, a bit more salt and maybe some garlic powder as well.

I have no basis for what real gnocchi tastes like, so this is just based on my taste and texture preference.  I thought these were easy to make, and i only ended up needing about 1 cup of flour to make a soft dough.  Used a fork dipped in flour to press on the tops and to give it a more authentic type of look.  Served with marinara sauce and Parmesean cheese.  They reminded me a lot of dumplings.  Would prefer these as part of a blend of sauce and meat, rather than just gnocchi and sauce.

Thanks for the simple recipe to add to the lineup. Mashed potato flakes are versatile & made this gnocchi recipe easy to manage. Next time I think I'd like to try to add some extra ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes or maybe a cheese center.

I made these tonight.  They are very very good.  I've been making gnocchi for many years, usually ricotta gnocchi, which are no fail, but this is a very close second.  Very light, not hard, but beware of the flour amount.  I used not even one cup, used the rest of that cup for flouring as I rolled and cut.  Great gnocchi is only good with a great sauce.The type of potato flakes I used are Betty Crocker's roasted garlic.  Very tasty.  I'm going to try other flavours.

I was terribly impressed by this recipe.  Based on other reviewers’ experience, I spiced them up quite a bit.    I threw in about 1T of garlic, and dumped way more Italian seasoning in than I intended (silly me, the lid fell off.) Still, though – it worked out!  I paired the gnocchi with this gorgonzola sauce recipe: allrecipes.com/Recipe/Gorgonzola-Sauce/Detail.aspx.  It was a PERFECT pair.  Honestly, I was shocked that it turned out well.  The texture of the gnocchi when I tried them fresh out of the boiling water left quite a bit to be desired.  But once they sat for a bit, and I covered them in the rich sauce, I was very pleasantly surprised.    Instead of cutting them into chunks, I just ripped off pieces from the dough ball, rolled them gently, and imprinted a fork around them.  This helped the sauce stick to them, and gave a more aunthentic…Gnocchiness!

I’ve made gnocchi before using peeled, boiled and mashed potatoes and this recipe is so much easier . The finished result is a fluffy pillow of potato-y goodness. I added ½ c garlic sautéed baby spinach (sliced supper thin, like confetti), 1/2 t. herbs de province and ¼ c parmesan roman blended cheese, all added before the introduction of the water, so that the heat could ‘active’ the flavors. I served them with grilled chicken, creamy mushroom sauce and finely shredded farmer’s cheese. Delicious!!

Very good.  I've never made gnocchi from scratch so I don't know how much quicker/easier this recipe is.  After cutting, I did "roll each piece down a fork" to get those sauce-holding grooves.  Fun recipe to make with kids.

This was good! I know the purpose is "quick" gnocchi but we always like to have the ridges in our gnocchi - it's worth the extra time. As per other reviewers, we didnt use all the flour, added italian seasons and used a herb potato flakes for extra flavour. Yummy! Will be coming back to this recipe with the above updates.

This was such an easy recipe. Made my first batch I doubled the recipe and added some parsley and garlic to give it some flavor and color. They came out so good I sauted them in butter and garlic added some fresh parsley and the juice of 2 lemons and some fresh parmesan cheese. Amazing!! I immediatly made 2 more double batches to share with friends. These are so awesome. Everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe Sandy

For being made with instant potatoes, these are great!  I added lots of fresh basil, thyme, and garlic.  As another poster mentioned, it was easier to work with refrigerated dough.  I served these with the Gorgonzola sauce from this website, and it was delicious.

My 5 year old is addicted to gnocchi after buying some frozen ones with sauce at a local grocery store. I decided to give these a try since it looked so easy to make. I followed the recipe but cut the salt in half and added more pepper. I made a huge batch since this only served 2 and I have big eaters in my family. I decided to roll them to their normal look. That was a sticky and tedious mess. I added salt to the boiling water and served them with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and spaghetti sauce then sprinkled shredded mozerella cheese to top. They were pretty good. Everyone liked them. Froze the rest for later consumption.

I tried the recipe yesterday, I didn't know what to expect, but I got to admit, it came out pretty well.  I did find the taste a bit bland, so I would suggest for those of you who want to try it, add some herbs to the dough.  Myself, I added some rosemary, great add, but I suggest you play around with it a little. I too didn't use all the flour in the recipe, but that's just a matter of taste. Definitely gonna make this again!

Update 07/06/11 Did not make again, not so appealing after all...

Sauce is needed for this to be successful but it's a great non-dairy pasta alternative.  I tossed a chunk of goat cheese in with the still hot gnocchi, tossed to coat, plated and drizzled with pesto.  If my gnocchi weren't all such random sizes and shapes it would have been quite elegant.

First, this gets 5 stars for not tasting like quick potato flakes! I was heavy-handed with spices: added Italian Seasonings, garlic powder, salt & pepper. Used a fork to tear them on the well floured surface - they didn't look perfect but held my "Easy Alfredo Sauce II" (from this site). This fed the two of us with some left over to freeze! Recommend using all the flour called for - just add about 1/4 cup at a time!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING - I love gnocchi and have never attempted to make it, until now.

It was fast and we all cleared our plates.  I only had flavored instant potatoes (cheddar and sour cream)and this added a great flavor.  I noticed that the smaller pieces had a better texture, so be careful to get uniform size.

This recipe was extremely quick & delicious.  I was skeptical of the concept but it turned out perfect.  I've since tried making this recipe using Betty Crocker Garlic & Cheddar instant potatoes (2 packets per box) with great success.  Each packet has exactly one cup of flakes so it works great with this recipe, and give the gnocchi an extra something, but not overbearing.  Be sure to cool the flakes thoroughly as it makes the dough a little easier to handle, and less sticky.  Also, add half the flour all at once, then gradually added the rest until you get a tough, but not too tough consistency (you may not use all of it, but it's good to have extra to keep your hands floured well while shaping/rolling.  I was able to roll out 4 decent sized breadstick shaped dough rolls, align side by side then cut using preforated knife, and shaped by pressing 2 fingers in the middle of each piece while gently rolling forward, then back and slightly pinching to form the final gnocchi (fork marks optional).  One cup of flakes was enough gnocchi for 2-3 people.  I boiled in large pot with some regular & garlic salt for about 4 minutes in 2 batches, then served with hot italian sausage and it was great.  You won't be disappointed.  The trickiest part is getting the dough to the right consistency, but this recipe cost so little to prepare, you can afford to mess up a batch or two until you master the dough.

This was FANTASTIC!  Very easy, very fast, and very very good.  I used the "Tomato-Cream Sauce for Pasta" (with spinach added) from this site.  Added cooked Italian sausage, dumped it all in a casserole and baked it.  It was just wonderful stuff!  And the leftovers were even better.

Yum.  I had to refridgerate mine for a few hours because I made them too far in advance, so I'm not sure if they would be fluffier if I hadn't done that, but they were good.  Paired with a delicious mushroom cream sauce with parm cheese.

This has to be one of the greatest recipes ever!  I've had genuine gnocchi in Italy, and these aren't far off.  If you want to make it a fun food for kids, it's easy to divide the dough and add some food coloring- they make a beautiful rainbow dish.

These tasted good, but what a lot of work and a big mess!  This was my first time making them, and I guess they just aren't worth the time for me.  I would rather have store bought tortellini.  I used garlic mashed potatoes, and I still thought they were pretty bland.  I ended up only cooking about 3/4 of the batch and the whole thing still took about an hour.

My grandmother literally came off the boat from Italy.  She is one of those grandmas, whose hands can perform magic in the kitchen.  If you are Italian, you know what I mean.  This recipe can fool them all!!!!  I used Roasted Garlic Instant Mashed Potatoes (Betty Crocker, I think).  And I made a Three Mushroom Cream Sauce with lots of freshly grated Romano Cheese on top.  What a crowd pleaser!!  Five stars are not enough!  Thank you.

This is my second review of this recipe, mostly of the technique. I just made this for the second time, but this time I used some leftover potatoes I'd made last night (Sally's Spinach Mashed potatoes from this site). I wasn't sure if it would work because of the added ingredients in the potatoes. I warmed the leftovers a little to loosen  them up, and following this recipe's proportions (adding the egg, and then the flour a little at a time once it neared the dough stage), it made awesome spinach gnocchi!  I made it early in case it didn't come out, but I will serve this for dinner tonight with an Alfredo sauce. The upshot is--this recipe is fantastic and forgiving. Don't be afraid to play around with it. Thanks again for sharing, Sandy.

Excellent. I used a Kitchen Aid mixer for this. I put 1 cup of flour,1/2 cup of parm cheese, some salt, pepper, a tad of onion powder, and cilantro flakes into the mixer bowl. I let these mix by themselves for a minute or two. I then boiled up a cup of water and added 1 cup of instant flakes to it. Mixed it really good and let it cool for a few minutes. I then dropped one egg into the mixer bowl, and then dropped the mashed potatoes into the mixer bowl. I let it mix on a low setting until it started to clump up and turn to a sticky dough. Take it out and then add and sprinkle as much flour to the dough ball as you need to get it to the desired consistency. I managed to get about 20 gnucchi pieces with this amount. I drop a small hand full into the boiling water, stir gently and let them boil for about 3 min. This makes them nice and firm but still easy to chew. I suppose if you let them boil for a shorter time they come out softer. Depends on what you prefer. I made a simple olive oil sauce with minced garlic, salt, pepper, and a small amount of hot pepper flakes and cooked them in the sauce for 2 min. Finally I topped with more parm. Came out perfect. I was cooking for two and we wish we made a little more. I would double the recipe and if the dough makes too much just freeze it for later.

This was great!  I love this quick gnocchi!  I followed the recipe as written except I used roasted garlic and parmesan mashed potato flakes.  This gnocchi went wonderfully with Italian sausage and spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I tried this recipe thinking it would be a great make ahead recipe. I am shocked at the positive reviews it has gotten. I am an avid cook and this is truly one of the worst recipes I've ever tried. It has absolutely no flavor and a horrible consistency.

I have never had gnocchi in a restaurant, so I can't speak to how authentic they are.  My first batch were very mushy, so I added more flour to get a much firmer dough, and was very pleased with the results.  Now I know what texture to aim for.  They came together quickly and were quite easy.  I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the dough and we ate them with a "chicken cacciatore" type of stew.  Recipe worked as given, all were eaten, and will definitely make again.  Plus I can use up my open box of instant potatoes!

Great recipe! I've actually never made 'real' gnocchi - only had the packaged stuff at this grocery store.  This made me realize that if this is not as good as the 'real' recipe, I really ought to make the 'real' gnocchi next! Great!

Worked out wonderfully. I was actually surprised at how much flour it took. A few of them got tough cause I think I cooked them too long.

In my water for the dough and then the boiling water, I added a generic Italian Spice" and Oregano and it made them great.

Like others, I didn't use as much flour.  I tripled the recipe and only needed 2 cups of flour, and probably could have gotten away with less.  But the recipe was easy and delicious!  Next time I will probably add some spices to the dough to give a little more flavor, but this tasted comparable to what I order at restaurants!

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and it turned out great. It was also the first time I've ever made Gnocchi so I'm not really sure how hard it is to make using real potatoes, but this way was super easy and fast. They tasted just like the ones we buy from the local restuarant! I made 2 batches one with a garlic cream sauce and the other with a marinara sauce. Great recipe I will be making these again soon.

Wow, I've never made gnocchi before, and frankly the idea is quite daunting. This recipe actually turned out to be super easy and turned out really well. Like other people said, not quite like actual gnocchi, but my husband loves it! The only thing is that the recipe calls for way too much flour in my opinion. I used about half of what they recommended, and that was already too much. I will definitely be using less when doing this next time, also I added garlic powder and it really was nice with the pepper. Definitely will use this again.

This was a "last minute" what can I cook other than hot dogs... hey I've got the stuff to try this out meal.  I had a single pack of Garlic Red Mashed potatoes and I was so happy that it was precisely 1 cup. It was my 1st time making Gnocchi and my DH's 1st time eating them. A easy recipe to make with little ingredients and little time and was a huge hit in my house. I will be cooking this again!

These were on my daily email from allrecipes today, never heard of them before and don't know how to pronoun them. WOW! I added some chopped fresh Rosemary as others suggested and some garlic salt. I made them earlier in the day and refrigerated them until dinner time.  It only took a couple of minutes to zap them in microwave, served them will hamburger patties smothers in onions and alfredo sauce, yummo!

This is a great recipe, and its so easy. I added Italian seasoning to the dough, and chilled the dough for only a few minutes before boiling.  I made this with the Amatriciana sauce from this site, and was delicious.  I will definitely use this one again.

Fearing that just making basic gnocchi may be a bit bland for my taste, I used garlic instant mashed potatoes instead of the recommended potato flakes and added, what I feared to be, too much rosemary. It turned out delicious! Even my roommate who was skeptical about this whole instant potato business loved it!

We've tried this several times and I've yet to find anyone who didn't like it. With the egg, it's chewy and great, but without it has a much gentler texture and still holds up just fine. Either way, it's perfect.

I added flour very carefully and sparingly, ending up with a very sticky and hard to work with dough (on purpose) the results was messy but incredibly tender and soft gnocchi, much better than I have ever bought! Perhaps next time I will add enough flour to make the dough less annoying, but the tenderness was worth it.

I have never made gnocchi before so maybe I disliked this recipe because of my inexperience in making them. I love them in restaurants so was disappointed. I found the dough to be too soft and sticky. I added more flour but then was afraid the gnocchi would become tough. I will probably keep to see if I can find a simpler way for me to get them to turn out.

now given that i'm not into being uber exact on anything cooking unless it's baking- i know mine turned dumpling-ish and i didn't have enough flour, but the end result regardless was really good. 
i didn't have to substitute anything or fuss with it. i DID add some frozen spinach and turned out just fine/good/ no mess ups.
served up with tomato sauce and sauteed veggies

I tried this but it came out just awful, maybe I was doing something wrong like adding not enough or too much flour but it was just a mess. I ended up making some frozen ravioli i had instead. I may try this again when i have some extra time. Thanks though.

OK, this was a great idea and with a little work it could probably be a VERY good short-cut-gnocchi. But don't expect to get it perfect the first time! 

The problem with boxed potatoes is that it's really difficult to judge how mushy the final gnocchi pieces are going to be, but you also don't want to over flour them. Unfortunately, mine came out a bit soft and didn't have that firm texture that "real" gnocchi have. 

That said, it still wasn't bad-- I served it with a VERY rich chantrelle mushroom sauce, which worked well with the softness of the gnocchi pieces.

I'll probably try this again and be more generous with the flour.

I had never tried gnocchi before, and my boyfriend requested it, so I thought this would be a good starter recipe. We both thought this recipe was great. I do use seasoned garlic salt with parsley for the salt, though, which might give it a little more flavor.

I was stuck with a big box of potato flakes from a visiting relative and had no idea what to do with them...and then I found this recipe!  Now I actually do buy potato flakes on purpose just to make gnocchi.  As good as all of the authentic italian restaurants I have gone to in south Philly.  It was SO easy to make and So tender, NOT CHEWY/HArD!  

This IS a time consuming recipe to make, but do keep in mind that using whole potatoes just takes even longer.  This recipe just cuts the time in half!

This was quite easy! I'm a gnocchi novice-I've never made any pasta at all and I still managed. I also used less flour-one cup and the half for rolling. The dough got to "good biscuit dough" consistency at the one cup mark, and that seemed about right. I also put in some Italian spices and garlic salt as per some reviews to give them more flavor-worked very well. Mine were cut too large and misshapen, creating "Franken-Gnocci" but the taste was fantastic. I don't care how ugly they are when they taste that good. Thanks, great recipe!

Quick and easy and very good. Couple with your favorite red sauce or even try mixing a premade pesto sauce with cream cheese to make a creamy pesto put some chicken sausage in there and pair it with a salad and you have one great meal. Freezes well when frozen on pan first then bagged. Recipes says its for two, but it's more like four.

For gnocchi I really liked this. The BF wasn't the greatest fan but that's of gnocchi in general. So easy and fast. Didn't need all the flour so add slowly. Served with marinara and pesto sauces. I could only find buter flakes so the gnocchi had a buttery taste. Probably make again.

This was really easy to make and tastes as if you put all the effort in. I added fresh snipped basil for extra pizazz, and used a rich rose sauce on it and it was delicious.

This is awesome!  I used to be married to an Italian and always made my own pastas.  I have now shared this recipe with several friends.  Making extra tonight and hoping I can freeze any leftovers......doubt there will be any though.  LOL!

Not as good as a restaurant.  I have tried many times to duplicate gnocchi from scratch and this is just as good but with way less time and work. The texture was even better after I froze them.  Anyways, I reccoment trying this because I think that it is just operator error that I can't make gnocchi.

This recipe was incredibly easy and yummy!  I used 1/2 cup of semolina flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour.  I served the gnocchi with a garlic mushroom sauce.  This is a keeper!

Comapring this recipe to mashed or riced potatoes, this recipe comes out smooth and easy to make. I give it a thumbs up and encourage everyone to try this delicious pasta dish, which by the way restaurants cannot seem to bother making, they say its too hard and alot of work?? I make it with a homemade meatless sauce and its so yummy! Thanks for the easier way to make this and also try semolina instead of white all purpose flour and its even better!!

I did not like this recipe! The problem may be that I've never had homemade gnocchi before, but they stuck to my teeth and made quite a mess preparing them. My husband, who loves gnocchi, didn't even finish his! Sorry!

This was delicious and came out great!  Just like my Mom used to make.  The whole family loved it and went back for seconds.  I served with the Spicy Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce recipe from this site.  It was so good and quick and easy.  Will be making this one over and over again.  Thanks!

My kids helped me make this wonderful dish - they had so much fun and they LOVED it! They actually cleaned their plates, which is a rarity in my house.  I have passed this recipe on to a couple of my friends to make for themselves.  It makes a great mass quantity recipe, too!

If this had been slightly lighter it would have been a 5 so my 4 stars is more like a 4.5 

I added extra cracked pepper and minced basil, and extra salt. following exactly they come out a bit heavy, but if you add a bit less flour and knead very quickly they come out fluffy.

overall i loved this recipe. better than store bought.

Very quick and convenient recipe. I hold back about 1/4 cup of flour per batch for dusting my rolling surface. It keeps the gnocchi from getting too floury and dense. What's also great is I can cut up any uncooked leftovers, put them on a parchment paper covered tray spaced so they don't touch, and freeze them for cooking another time. It makes the next time all that much faster. Cooks up beautifully from frozen.

Great shortcut recipe for gnocchi! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I just added flour as needed and have no idea how much I used (but probably less than 1.5 cups), and I incorporated some chopped fresh sage from my herb garden into the mix. Once cooked, I pan-fried them in some butter and more sage and they came out delicious!

This is great!  It's still a bit of work, as working with dough always is, but it's worth it for fresh gnocchi!  So delicious!  I made a double recipe for my husband and I and we froze half of it... the serving size is about perfect!

The recipe's good, but lacks technique. "Real" gnocchi are formed by placing your finger in the center of each piece and bringing it toward you as it curls over your finger. Make sure you have enough flour when you do this or it will stick to the working surface.

Made these for my daughter's birthday dinner - what a hit ! Lighter that the traditional gnocchi made with boiled potatoes. I made 5x the recipe so cut back on the flour by about 1 1/2 cups but used some of that to flour the board with. Ended up using about 6 3/4 cups. Now if can just find someone to roll them next time I feed 13 people (had leftovers).

Worked very well.  I added some basil and served it with a basil fontina sauce.  Like most of you, I was worried about the instant potatoes, but you honestly couldn't tell all in this version

Yum. I went to this super fancy vegan cafe in L.A. and they had fried gnocchi. They served it with this delicious ranch / tomato sauce. It was awesome super simple and cost a ridiculous amount. I thought, "I could make this!" I found this recipe, the ingredients cost next to nothing, and it was delicious! I suggest frying in vegetable oil.

I used "Italian garlic" seasoned potato flakes and added paprika, thyme, and a little seasoning salt for extra flavor.  They were easy and fun to make--so yummy and versatile!  I served them over pasta but they're also great with tomato sauce.

I only used 1 1/4 cup of flour as the dough seemed stiff enough at one cup and then I used the extra 1/4 cup for flouring the rolling surface.  I liked the consistency of the gnocchi but the taste was rather bland.  Thank goodness for sauce to make it more interesting! I will make again but might try adding some more spices to the dough.

Excellent! I will never buy gnocchi at the grocery store again. Made the recipe as written but the amount of flour was more than enough for adding to the dough AND dusting the surfaces the keep it from sticking. I didn't find the dough hard to work with, even warm. I added Italian seasoning to the dough. I doubled the recipe and froze most of it (after rolling/cutting but before cooking) to whip out when I don't feel like cooking dinner. Yum!

These are an ok substitute but if you are a real gnocchi fan I would go for the real thing.  Here's my theory as to why these don't make good gnocchi: when you make traditional gnocchi, you don't want to process the potatoes too much - don't mash them up, just add your egg and flour and then combine.  When you use instant mashed potatoes, they get too moist and you will need A LOT of flour to make the dough workable.  I will not make these again.

Excellent taste.  Only substitutions were for chicken broth instead of water.  Did not add salt.  The reviewer who said that the smaller was better was right on the money

Wow! I made this last night. I added itallian seasoning and garlic powder and served it in a vodka sauce. It was so easy and so quick, I could not beleive how close it was to the Gnocchi I get at Peppinos. Thank you so much. This is a keeper!

This is a decent gnocchi and it's pretty quick to make as well. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/8 tsp paprika to the mix to give it a bit more flavor. Whoever suggested making the "Four Cheese Sauce" with this is my new best friend - what a great sauce!

I just made this (never made gnocchi before) and I was impressed!!! It was so simple, and soooo delicious! I added some garlic powder and Italian Seasonings, and used only 1 cup of flour as someone else suggested. Also, topped it with some fresh parm/reggiano! Perfection in a bowl!!! (Scored some points w/ the BF, too) :P I served it with a sausage tomato sauce (Classico), and steamed broccoli. Success...I HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe!!

Yum! Was totally rawk'n. I haven't had real gnocchi though so I don't have anything to compare it to. I cooked mine in chicken stalk and put in sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic salt, and s&p. I'm going to save the chicken stalk now 'cause it'll be perfect for some chicken soup. :) I'll be freezin that goodness! I didn't change the recipe at all. Went ahead and made 2 batches but would definitly suggest that you eat it fresh.   What would you serve the gnocchi with though? I can see a side salad and maybe a piece of grilled chicken or somethin'?   Lemme know at lanez_2001@yahoo.com.

Pretty good.  More like 4 1/2 stars, if i could rate it that.  Used roasted garlic instant potatoes, and the flavor was really good.  I could not get the shape right at all, but that's my own fault and not the recipe.  A very messy dish, but in the end it was worth it.  Big thanks to reviewers who suggested the sage butter sauce.  I made that, and it was wonderful paired with the garlic flavor in the gnocchi.  Will make this again.

I cannot beliveeeeeeeeeeeeee I actually made GNOCCHI - from SCRATCH!!!!!!  This is AMAZING!!  My shapes were all over the place, and making the shapes was tricky.  I would make sure next time that my pieces are smaller.  When it was boiled, I thought it looked dreadful,  but when I tasted it (with a chessy sauce I made with the White Sauce base from this site) - it was simply delicious!!!!!  FAB recipe!!!!! Thank you - I feel like a bit of a pro chef now! :)

It took a while to make, i had to make double the batch to feed my family. It came out good, but not great. I put pink vodka sauce with it. My step-daughter on the other hand really enjoyed it and is asking when i'm going to make it again.

these really didn't work for me. They tasted ok but were more like dumplings and a lot less like store-bought gnocchi.

This was fairly easy to make. I used left over real mashed potatoes cup for cup instead of the potato flakes and ommited the water. It was a good way to use left-over mashed potatoes.

I've only had gnocchi a few times, so I don't know how mine compared but they were really good if a little bland. I followed one reviewers advice and after making the dough (No idea if I added enough flour or too little) I scooped it into a large plastic bag and cut the corner off. Then I just squeezed it out and cut with scissors dipped in flour. This was a two person job though. My only regret was using canned sauce because it took longer than I thought to do the gnocchi and we were hungry. Didn't like the sauce but the gnocchi were good. I plan to make these with spinach and cheese gnocchi and a sausage marinara sauce for a party next week.

These are delicious but the recipe needs WAAY more flour than it says. At least twice as much. Otherwise the dough is too sticky and impossible to roll.

This was wonderful.  I loved making this with the kids, it was tons of fun.  I didn't need all the flour.  i only used less than 1 cup.  made this with gnocchi with pesto sauce from this site.

This is a very good recipe for quick gnocchi.  The only problem I had was not adding enough flour (I read a lot of reviews about not needing as much) and I had a big mess when I tried to roll it out and cut it.  I had to mash it back in a ball, add more flour, and knead it some more.  I still give it a 5 because I'm the one who didn't follow the recipe and it tasted GREAT.  I made it with the sage-butter sauce from this site - sooo delicious.  I will definately be making this again.  Thanks!

I haven't had Gnocchi and I'm German so I don't know how my opinion will compare, but I like this dish.  I used a butter & herb flavored potatoes.  Be sure to make them small or it taste like a dumpling.

So good! I've made gnocchi from real potatoes and really couldn't tell the difference with these. I actually liked them better in a way because the texture was perfect. There were no little lumps of potato in them. My husband thought I made them from potatoes and my mother-in-law took leftovers home. Two other perks of this recipe: I wasn't exhausted at the end, and my kitchen wasn't such a mess, either. I served it with a jarred tomato and basil sauce. Will make again.

I used whole wheat flour, and added sausage. 
I've never had gnocchi until I made them today. So I don't know any better or worse for comparison. 
I'm thinking that next time I will fry them.

SO easy,So good!
I ended up using a little less flour, just enough so it's not sticky and you can roll it out!
My oldest son was in Italy recently and this was one of his favorite foods. I never made it because it was so labor intensive. He raved about my "homemade from scratch" gnocchi!! I'll never tell!!!! Thanks!!!

This was so much fun.  I love making fresh pasta and have never tried making gnocchi since I do not have a ricer. I figured since it was boxed potatoes if I messed up I would not have wasted too much time.  I think they came out perfect and I am not sure I would bother with real potatoes.

I've never had or made gnocchi before so I was unsure of what to expect...I used 2 cups of regular mashed potatoes as that is what I had...they had milk and butter in them, so I found I needed a little more flour.  Also added 3/4 tsp each garlic powder and thyme.  Very yummy.  I also found that these can be made in advance and then flash frozen before cooking.  When ready to use just drop frozen into rapidly boiling water. Will make again.

I was hesitant to try this recipe as I used to make homemade gnocchi with my Grandma on special holidays and other occasions. I had in my mind what gnocchi should taste like. These were sensational gnocchi, similar in taste and consistency to gnocchi made the old fashioned way with boiled potatoes. I have shared this recipe with other family and friends and they all give rave reviews. The dough is really nice to work with. Thanks for such a great and time saving recipe.

I have never had gnocchi before and I really wanted to try this recipe out. I don't know what "real" gnocchi is supposed to taste like but these turned out pretty well. I added a bit of garlic salt and Parmesan cheese to my mix. Next time I make them I will keep them smaller as mine were a bit too much to eat in one bite. I served them with a homemade alfredo sauce that I got a recipe for on this site and my husband LOVED it. Will make this again.

Very messy! The recipe turned out alright. It's nice for a quick little homemade pasta but the gnocchi's have no flavor so I would advice to add more of your own spicing.

The flavor of these was great, but as I was making them, I hoped my family didn't like them too much because it was a lot of work.  Some of the other reviewers said it was so quick and easy, and I suppose it is compared to the old fashioned way (where you start with dirty potatoes fresh from the fields) but still, all that kneading and slicing into each and every little piece...maybe I'm just lazy.  Unfortunately for me, my family really did like it.  By the way, I added 1/2 cup finely grated fresh parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon of finely chopped dried rosemary. Yum, but Barilla pasta is yummy too and it's all ready to throw into a pot of boiling water.  So, if it's gnocchi or nothing for you, go for it.

Nothing tastes as good as the REAL potato. My son was home from school and learned how to make this pasta in Italy. He said he cringed when he read your methods. The other option of putting bits of romano cheese in the middle of the gnocchi is important. He also used some a bit melted first for the dough. Rosemary is his flavor of choice added to the dough. Try it you may really like it! Bono! and Good Fortune

This recipe ROCKS!!!  I grew up eating gnocchi but making it is such an ordeal, I saved them for only special occasions.  I never would have thought of making them with instant potatoes!  I used less flour than the recipe calls for, and they came out light and fluffy and PERFECT!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Sandy!

Absolutely delicious yet very quick and easy!!  I find that the dough is usually a bit too soft and sticky to roll out long ropes easily (and adding more flour makes the gnocchi tough) so I usually pinch off small pieces of dough straight from the bowl.  works great!

This is a good recipe.  It is a basic recipe for gnocchi that may lack a ton of taste on its own, but it so versitile.  When I decide what sauce I want to use, i take some of the flavors from that and add it to the gnocchi (such as sage if I use the Sage Butter Sauce)

My family loved this recipe.  So much easier using the instant potatoes.  I made a pink cream sauce to go with it and it tasted great.  I also freezed for other meals.

Made this for the first time and followed the recipe, although quadrupled the batch due to my headcount. The kids were skeptical at first but wanted to help which sped things along. Adults and kids loved it!  Served with a creamy pesto, which was perfect. I highly recommend!

I made this yesterday and was pleased with the results.  I doubled the recipe so that I would have enough to freeze for another meal. I added the last cup of flour gradually, since I was concerned that the result would be too dry. The taste was very good.  I have made ricotta gnocchi in the past, and prefer the lighter texture and flavor of the ricotta. But this version made with potatoes was tasty, and easy.  I will definitely make it again.

so good. I think putting it in the fridge for 5 minutes after the dough process might make it a little easier to cut as mine were a little goofy shaped.  also I threw some garlic in the water when i boiled. definitely added some flavour!

I made these this morning, reminds me of perogies in texture, the only taste that your going to have is with whatever sauce or seasoning you use, I am still trying to figure out why one reviewer said they were labour intensive, they are not. The thing that took the longest was waiting for the potato to cool down before adding the egg, they are super easy to make , I used only about a cup of flour and the rest I used to flour the board as needed for rolling, I gave them a 4 because of the ease, They would not be a favorite dish of mine but  I would make them again if I needed a little something extra.

First time making this! Went through reviews and took note... I doubled the batch and froze the 2 nd one freezing them on a cookie sheet first. I agree that you don’t need as much flour and mix it in slowly. I added Italian seasoning, garlic sat and pepper.  They were super soft and delicious!!!  I used a hamburger/ tomato sauce and it takes great.  I will try a chicken/Alfredo sauce next time. Definitely recommend this as it is super easy to do and the results were fabulous!

This is very delicious. I am 100% Italian and I grew up eating homemade pastas. However, I was not as ambitious as my grandmother was so I usually bought my gnocchi frozen foods isle of my grocery store. I just recently decided to try my hand at homemade pasta making and I dove right in. I bought all sorts of pasta attachments for my Kitchenaid mixer and I became a homemade pasta making maniac. With all of the attachments that I have, I do not have one that makes gnocchi or cavatelli. I came across this recipe and decided to try it. I'm glad I did. It went together so very quickly. The hardest part was waiting for the instant potato and water mixture to cool. The rest was a breeze. They took about 8 minutes to start rising to the top of my boiling water but I think that it was because I cut them just a bit too big. But, boy, were they good....and filling! I served these with my grandmother's homemade tomato sauce and her homemade meatballs recipes. A little garlic bread on the side and MMM MMM good.

Wasn’t too thrilled on this one. The gnocchi itself was a bit bland. Also I’m not sure what I did but the dough was very difficult to work with. It was too soft and too dry at the same time. It was very hard to roll. Constantly felt it was going to fall apart while cutting. After it was done cooking the gnocchi itself was really soft. Too soft. Next time I’ll try making with actual potatoes instead of instant and try again.  See if that makes the difference because my friend made me some homemade last week and it was so good!

Absolutely delicious and a much faster and simpler way to enjoy homemade gnocchi! It’s extremely hard for me to find gluten free gnocchi in stores, so now I can make it myself without all the extra mess and fuss. (I subbed Trader Joe’s gluten free all purpose flour using the same measurements and it turned out spectacularly). Thank you for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making homemade gnocchi. I did use homemade mashed potatoes because i had leftovers in the fridge. Overall they were super easy to make and delicious! My Italian mother-in-law who makes everything from scratch was thoroughly impressed!

I've never made gnocchi the long way, but this was a *very* simple and straightforward recipe! I will change a few things next time: 1) Gradually adding the flour in rather than all at once - it was really hard to get a uniform dough consistency otherwise. // 2) Rolling the dough way thinner than what I  interpreted a breadstick to be; my gnocchi were almost doughnut-hole-sized (lol) // 3) Starting before I'm hungry - the recipe took closer to 1–1.5 hours than 15 minutes, for anyone who's about to try this for the first time. Really excited to tweak my approach and try it again!

Love this recipe!  I use it all the time in soups.  It can resemble a dumpling (depending on how much flour you add) and makes a wonderful substitute for noodles or pasta because it holds up so well when reheated (even after being frozen!) My leftover pastas always get gummy and fall apart.  I've never used it with sauce on top but I can definitely say that in soups and stews it's an awesome pasta substitute!

I made it exactly as the recipe was written. Put them in a homemade chicken soup in place of my usual homemade noodles.  Super quick and easy to make. I don't bother making special fork marks in them. Just roll em out in sticks, whack 'em in chunks, and throw them in. In soup I didn't bother to preboil them. I will make these again and again.

This was quick and easy. Not quite like real potato gnocchi but for the ease it was great. I used a package of dried potatoes with four cheese flavor. I think it may have been too strong. Maybe just garlic if I do this again. They weren't as chewy as I prefer. I only used one cup of flour, and I wonder if more would have been better.

They were a little bland and not as fluffy as I'd like them so next time I will change the shape and maybe replace salt with onion salt.  Definitely easier than using potatoes.

This has been our go-to recipe! It's extremely inexpensive and tastes incredible. I've been pairing it with a rose sauce and bacon.

Since there is no leavening at all in this recipe, the gnocchi came out so dense and heavy that I had to pull them out of the soup.

I come from an italian family that makes gnocchi from scratch, so adding boxed mashed potatoes to the recipe was kind of hard to take. I am pleasantly surprised with the results! I made it all in the food processor adding spinach as well. Then I finished working the dough slighly more on the table with extra flour. It turned great! My family loved it!

FANTASTIC. Simple. Followed the recipe precisely - I used a double steamer to keep them warm as I pulled them out of the pot in batches and threw a little olive oil in both pots to keep the pasta from sticking. DON'T follow the instant potato box. Stick to what is written here and you'll love the outcome. Made a nice meat marinara sauce with sliced sweet Italian sausage for them. Will be a keeper go-to recipe.

We have these alot, as I have never had any success making gnocchi from real potatoes, and I don't like store-bought. I had trouble the first few times with over-mixing the dough; I learned  through trial and error to mix the ingredients until just combined, then dump the whole mess onto a floured board and "squish" it together with my hands until it can be rolled and cut. Too much flour is the kiss of death for gnocchi-better 
to leave them just a tad sticky rather than add too much flour and turn them into gluey little bricks.

I eat tons of store bought gnocchi and the prices just went up dramatically so I wanted to give this a try.  A lot of reviews talked about the texture...some said they were too doughy and some said they were too tough.  I know to cook the gnocchi I buy you only need to allow them to float to get the dense chewy traditional texture but I actually prefer to boil them for a long time to get the fluffiest texture possible, most of the time.  I found this recipe to actually be too soft and mushy, which is not the same.  Also, many people commented on how bland these are but the ones I buy, all of them, are always really bland so I thought that was supposed to be the case so the gnocchi can be paired with pretty much any sauce flavor you like, kind of like couscous.  I make everything from pesto sauce to cooking them in chicken broth and then using the broth to make a sauce so the starch from the pasta helps thicken the mixture.  These were indeed very bland but that's how I like them.  If I could figure out how to get the texture right, I would make this recipe again.

I must preface this review by saying I have never had gnocchi nor made it before. This is my first attempt. I must say that I like the end product although the process was a little confusing for me. I think the dough won't look like a bread dough but it would still work after you place it on a well floured surface. I think mine ended up a little tough because I kept kneading it and adding flour to it, expecting it to look like a bread dough...

This was pretty easy to make but the texture wasn't as dense as I would've liked it.  Will try again and increase potato flake to flour ratio.

My family loved these.  I used Idahoan brand and they were just as good as fresh.  Even better for me because it took about 1/10th of the time I usually spend prepping fresh potatoes.  Idahoan brand already has salt in their product, though, so taste before adding more salt.

Having never had gnocchi before, I guess I can't really compare this to the "real" thing.  But I think it turned out really well, although a little soft for use in the chicken and gnocchi soup recipe on this site.  Maybe there was just too much chicken and other vegetables, but the gnocchis got a bit mushed.  Or maybe I didn't add enough flour to the mix, so they were too "mashed potatoey" to hold up.  Next time, I'll add more flour.  The flavor was great, maybe because I used a package of the garlic and cheddar instant potatoes.  I think I'll try the herbed version next time.

I will be using this recipe again! Easy to make, filling and cheap, it was a nice change and felt homemade. I used a Parmesan and Garlic flavored potato, and served it with a quick homemade meat sauce. All in all, it cost me under $5 to feed two people with large appetites. I'm very pleased, and thank you for sharing!!

I wasn't sure if I should try this or not because I have never used instant potatoes, but I'm glad I did.  I have made these for years but quite a bit larger. I also used Betty Crocker's roasted garlic and it had a great flavor. They are also very good with a beef and pork roast with the gravy over them. Would probably be good with chicken and gravy too.

I used a package of the Idahoan loaded baked to give it an added kick. The family loved it!

I, too, grew up eating my Italian grandmother's homemade gnocchi and I was shocked at how good these were!  I didn't put as much salt the first time I made it because it seemed like TOO much but it turns out it needed it... Really great recipe!!

These were really good!  They turned out a bit firmer than regular gnocchi, but I actually like them that way.  Also my fiance, who previously did not like gnocchi, really liked these and ate far more than his share.  Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I have young children who absolutely love it! I've started to play with the recipe a bit on occasion, adding ricotta and spinach, but it definately doesn't need the additions to be devoured by the whole family! Thanks!

These were quick and fabulous.  I will try adding herbs next time and using my KitchenAid.  I served them with traditional meat sauce. 2nd time I used flavored instant potatoes and it was much better, but reduce the salt.  I am still working out the flour ratio.

I made this recipe last night, and it was a big hit! I doubled the recipe, and found that I used more flour than the recipe called for because the dough was so sticky. My gnocchi came out like little dumplings, but I'm guessing I used too much flour since everyone else seems to be commenting that they used LESS flour. They were still delicious. Next time, I'll try to use less flour and I'll definitely triple or quadruple the recipe so I can freeze the extras. We had them with a marinara sauce this time. Can't wait to try them with a cream sauce!

A very simple and quick recipe. I was using the gnocchi in a cream sauce so I added a little fresh ground nutmeg to the flour to compliment the sweetness of the cream sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and loved it!  I found I had to add all the flour plus a bit more since my dough was very stick and took some time to form a decent ball.  I also found when cooked they gnocchi weren't fluffy they were more chewy.  I like them this way but some people say they should be light and airy not dense and chewy.  A little marinara sauce and they tasted great!

Very good, very easy. When I made these, it didn't take anywhere near 1.5 cups flour (I used maybe 1/2 c., but could have used a little more), so don't be afraid to try again and tweak it to get it just right.

Tastes great - I had to use significantly more flour than the recipe called for and the prep time was closer to 20 minutes but it all turned out tasty in the end.

Personally I think gnocchi is a boring food.  I enjoy spicy foods with lots of flavor.  We soaked ours in spaghetti sauce and that helped.  Great recipe, it was easy to make.

I haven't had too much "real" gnocchi, so I'm not the most qualified person to attest to how good this is, but I liked it! I made a quick vegetable tomato soup and floated them in it. They made a very delicious addition :)

Not bad but I could really taste the instant potatoes.  Next time I will try a different type of instant potato or go for the real thing.  It definitely needs something to give it a little more flavor.

i'm not sure what gnocchi is supposed to taste like - but should it taste more potato-ey?  I didn't think they were very potato-ey.  when cutting the pasta, don't pile all the cut pieces on one plate, they stick together!

These were really easy to make; the only bad thing was that they had a wee bit of an odd taste to them, I think from the instant potatoes we used (we used an organic brand, a conventional brand may have tasted better).  They were fine once they were covered with yummy sauces though and my three old liked them.  Something different than your every-day pasta, so thanks for the recipe!

Not sure why my gnocchi were a little bit falling apart when I boil them in water but taste and texture were good.  I cooked them in primavera sauce.  Neither my boyfriend or I had tried the real gnocchi so we had nothing to compare.  LOL  We both liked the dish though.  Thanks for the recipe!

In order for this to come close to being real Gnocchi shouldn't it have some egg or egg yoke in it?  Just like most pasta the egg helps it bind together. I've made Gnocchi before and it is a pain and a quick recipe is most welcome but I added egg to the mixture.

Very good. Based on other reviews, I used wheat flour, added chopped spinach and some garlic salt. I made the vodka tomato cream sauce from this site and it was very yummy. I will definitely make these gnocchi again.

This is weird. I won't make it again. I'd rather try real potatoes. It does taste fake and the dough wasn't tough, however, it was crumbly, hard to roll, a pain to make and the quantities all over the place because 1/2 cup instant potato which I had and 1/2 cup boiling water just made a crumb mix. It wouldn't hold together at all. The egg just made it, but I had to add extra water to make a stiff dough, but then I had to add flour to make this dish and add more water. As you can see, it didn't work out. Nice idea, but we threw the dough out.

This is an excellent recipe if you need to make a last minute meal.  Obviously its not going to be as good as with real potatoes but it is a huge time saver.  I have used this many times when I've been in a rush in the evening and want something filling.  Awesome idea.

Made it just exactly like the recipe stated. The taste was right on from what I've had when eating out...first time trying to make this at home. Turned out well! Next time I'll add a touch more salt. I did pull from the water right when they floated to the top..but still was sorta gummy..that's why I only gave 4 stars. Maybe I cooked too long or not enough..but I'll make this again. Even my 3yo boy loved it..Made w/ the tomato cream sauce for pasta found here.

This was not at all to my liking. I followed the recipe exactly, and all I came out with was a mess and bland food. Normally I'm a fan of bland food, but there was just something strange about this. Ending up being a waste of time and ingredients. It could just be that gnocchi is not for my family.

Perfect for a gnocchi novice.  Super easy and quick to make.  Definitely would serve 4 as a side.  I used these for the Gnocchi with Sage-Butter Sauce recipe from this site.   Not quite as tender as I've had in restaurants but still delish!

Don't be turned off by the instant potatoes! Although they could never pass as real mashed potatoes, this definitely qualifies as real gnocchi. Great base for adding seasonings that compliment your meal.

This recipie was excellent! My boyfriend and I made it, and while we were it looked odd...but after it boiled up they were SO very good.  I liked mine with a lot of cheddar cheese and just a little spagetti sauce.

I have never had gnocchi, never made it before, but I knew I wanted to make a Gnocchi and Chicken soup.   These turned out amazing. So extremely simple and delicious. I would have given it 5 stars but I think there is way to much flour. I used perhaps 3/4 a cup. And even though I am a gnocchi novice, I know a good dough. The end result was incredible. The best soup I have ever made.   I plan on teaching this way to many friends. thanks so much for posting.

I dislike instant mashed potatoes but love gnocchi.  Because of the significant decrease in time required to make this gnocchi it was worth a try even if it failed.  But...it didn't fail...it was quick and wonderful.  I serve it to the kids drizzled in olive oil, course salt and pepper and grated parmesan.  For the adults I make a gorgonzola sauce.  We love it and I will NEVER make gnocci from scratch again!!

Mine came out mushy.  I froze it according to instructions.  When I tried to boil it, it got mushy and began to fall apart.  It take so long to make that I was really disappointed.

I added a tablespoon of EVOO and a teaspoon of herbes de provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme, and savory) to the gnocchi.  I don't think there will be enough for dinner tonight because I just "taste-tested" most of them =)

I give this recipe 4 stars because the directions were simple and complete and easy to follow.  After I made the gnocchi, I wasn't sure how to serve it.  I had leftover pizza sauce and extra mozzarella cheese, so I tossed the gnocchi with pizza sauce and a little cheese.  I put it into a small, greased baking dish, covered it with mozzarella, and baked it in the oven for 40 minutes at 325 degrees.  I think it was pretty tasty, and my husband really liked it.  My 4 star rating is for the gnocchi, though--not my creation.

This is a pretty good alternative to the tedious process of using real potatoes. My family loved these in a butter sauce.

This was absolutely excellent.  Like other reviews I did not use all the flour in the recipe - I only used 1 cup.  I tend to err on the side of less flour in gnocchi - otherwise they get too doughy and dense.  I added a touch of garlic to mine and it was a nice hint of flavor.  This dish only took 15 minutes or so from start to finish - MUCH faster than other gnocchi and very similar in flavor.  Is it as good as tradional gnocchi? No.  Is it pretty darn close? Absolutely.

Fast, easy, tastes great! We have a family of four so I freeze half of the Gnocchi (first spaced out on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and then put them all in a freezer bag) to use later. What's easier than that?!

I have never had traditional gnocchi, so I have nothing to compare it against, but my family thought these were delish!!!
My 1yr old daughter DEVOURED them! 
I made a tomato sauce to lightly coat, it was perfect with a side salad for a light dinner.

Awesome! Easy! It's something I always have the ingredients for on hand. I had never made this before so I was quite nervous actually, but it was nothing to worry about because it really is "quick" and easy!

This was a quick recipe.  I used the round potato things (sorry not sure the name but got them from Costco) instead of flakes and they still turned out great.  Just not real sure how to shape them.  I had someone tell me to roll them off a fork or pressing a fork into them, but some of them just looked deformed.  This recipe just says cutting them but I wanted to have a little design.  Thanks, I'll make it again!

Wow -- I made this recipe tonight for supper with pesto and it was incredible. My whole family loved it.  I didn't change anything except that I triped the amounts so there would be lots and leftovers.  It took a bit of time but it was so worth it! Gnocchi is a favorite of ours and this is the best recipe I've tried. Thanks!

YUM!! I mixed this idea with 1/2 C whole wheat flour and 1C pureed spinach and OH BOY! My family went wild for it! Not having to bake the potatoes saved me so much time and effort and I didn't notice a difference. I got the vitamins in and they got their beloved "pasta" for dinner. loved it!

My family had gnocci at a local restaurant (Whitby, ON, Canada).  I had to try to make it.  My wife and kids loved it.  I followed other sugestions and did not make the gnocci to stiff.  I found that they floated rather quickly and boiled them for 7 minutes regardless.  This was a great recipe.

I hate pasta but I LOVE gnocchi!  What I don't like is the price of enough to feed the family, $18 per two packs at Costco so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I don't think I used even half the flour it called for but it was SO good!  It left me wondering if I've ever had the real "from spuds" thing! THANKS!!!!

I have never made gnocchi before. I am glad that I read al the reviews first. This worked out very well. I added fresh garlic, some italian seasonings. I drizzled it with fresh garlic and olive oil instead of sauce. It turned out delicious and I am keeping it in my recipe box. After rolling out the first rope, I felt it was a little too long to work with, so I would recommend dividing it into four balls and then rolling into ropes. I served it with sweet italian sausage and the french baguettes submitted by Judy Taubert. I ate so much, I should have exploded!

This was quite good and fairly easy, though time consuming.  I made 2 batches and froze them until I used them (just through them in the pot of boiling water from the freezer).  Served with sage butter sauce.  Very good!  I also added a little dried basil into the dough for looks and taste.

I'm sure they weren't that good because this was my first time making them.  But, they were so sticky I had to add a ton of flour, and leftovers of this stuff is horrid.  Not too terrible the first day but I tossed leftovers because they were so mushy.  :(  

I found the freshly made product too bland, I wish I had read the reviews and added some cheese and other spices to the mix before cooking.  Maybe that would have made a difference in taste, though it wouldn't have saved the leftovers.

This recipe was fantastic. I never made the real gnocchis, but this i founded tasted just as good with tomoato sauce. The dough was very sticky and I reccomend following the directions exactly or else your dough will stick to everything. I did not add all the flour and i suffered for that. So add all or even more flour until you really do have a stiff (non-sticking) dough.

I had a few friends over for dinner and decided to take a chance on this recipe.  I have always HATED, HATED, HATED instant potatoes, so I was unsure about this recipe.  It was AWESOME!  Even our friend's 18 month old picky eater, and my one year old loved it!  I know that people say that this doesn't replace the real thing, but I thought that it did.  I don't know if there is a difference to the brand of potato flakes, but the one that I got (a no-name brand) turned out perfect.  I will never make them from total scratch again.  To feed 5 people and a toddler I needed to double the recipe and I didn't have any leftovers.  Next time I am going to quadruple the recipe and then freeze it.  It also took me quite a while to do, so I suggest leaving LOTS of time.

Just got done with supper.  Husband loved them. Made a couple of changes. I'm restricting my sodium, so I replaced the salt and pepper with Ms. Dash Garlic and Herb. After they boiled, I pan-fried them in a skillet with unsalted butter and garlic powder.  The crispier they were, the better we liked them. A good basic recipe to expand on.

I've never made homemade gnocchi from scratch, but I have bought the storebought packages often.  This recipe beats the storebought hands down.  I found it very easy to make.  I turned the dough out on a silicon mat to roll out and cut the gnocchi, which made the cleanup a breeze.

This recipe was very easy to do! I did use about 1/2c less flour, but it tastes great and my 5 year old is begging for more!

I agree with the other reviewers. It's good for quick gnocchi, but nothing compares to scratch gnocchi. It is good though.

this was my first time with gnocchi. the dough was SO sticky and really hard to work with. the final product was really chewy and bland. i might give them another shot since i have all these potato flakes now.

I'm not sure that this recipe is really any quicker than making regular gnocchi--which is made only with boiled red potatoes and flour--no eggs--but it was actually pretty good--considering that I, like another poster--absolutely hate instant mashed potatoes.

I definitely prefer how these turned out over most store bought pre-made gnocchi which I generally find to be too granular tasting and full of semolina and other weird stuff.  
A pretty good variation on an old favorite.

I've never had gnocchi before so I don't know how authentic this was but it tasted good to me and my girls. I only used about a cup of flour that seemed like plenty. Think next time i will add some italian seasoning to the dough. Thanks for a totally new eating experience.

Tastes great and easy to make, but if you triple the recipe, it takes all afternoon to cut and shape.  Towards the end, I was so over it that I was making gnocchiballs...

wonderful flavor.  Not hard to make but time consuming if you make the ridges.  My kids loved it.  I served it with an alfredo sauce and the leftovers were eaten at work - I took it for lunch but my co-workers ate most of it.

I made these tonight for dinner and they were delicious. I ended up only needing about 1 cup of flour, plus some extra for the board. This made a nice light dumpling. I have made gnocchi the old fashioned way, boiling the potatoes, ricing them, and then preparing the dough. This was so much easier and quicker and with a very satisfying result. I served them with Mamma's Marinara Sauce from this site.

It was pretty easy to make.  It tasted kind of funny but I think it's because I used buttered potato flakes instead of plain.

Really quick and simple!  I used butter & herb flavored instant potato flakes which added an interesting taste to the gnocchi.  These are definitely better than store-bought gnocchi.  From now on I will make extra and freeze for later!

This really was easy to do.  I love gnocchi but I have never made it because I thought it would be too much work.  I was wrong!  I am going to make up a batch or two to keep in my freezer so I will have it on hand for a quick dinner.

My grandma use to make these all the time. I learned from her how to make them with "real" mash potatoes. Its a long process.  I have tried other recipes with instant potatoes. Nothing matches this recipe. Excellent. Thank you for sharing it.

I liked this Recipe. It was easy enough to do with a toddler hugging a leg. Instead of cooking them in boiling water I fried them which was different for family who ate up and asked for more. Thanks for sharing. ;)

This is a really good gnocchi recipe.  It's simple, no fuss, and cooks up fast.  I'm sure it can be flavored and served in many ways. I will definitely keep this one on hand, as I know I'll be making it again soon.

This recipe was simple and very quick to make. I made this for my friend on her birthday and she absolutely loved it. It wasn't the prettiest thing I've ever made, but the taste overrules the look. Thanks. I can't wait to make this again.

Came out great considering the time and effort this recipe saved. I used instant garlic mashed potatoes and topped them with a tomato cream sauce.  Very easy and very delicious!

VERY happy with this recipe. Can be prepared in minutes with basic ingredients. Now I can stop bugging my friend who lives in NYC for my favorite Italian vacuum-packed gnocchi!

Fun and tasty.  I had some left-over garlic mashed potatoes, and lost my other gnocchi recipe so this really fit the bill.  I probably made double the recipe as I figured I used about 3 cups of potatoes, and just kept working the flour in until the dough was easy to work with.  My family calls these "gut bombs," but they are good!

These turned out much better than I thought they would.  They were a little doughy and not very pretty, but I think I could have solved that by putting more flour in.

I made these with the Spicy vodka tomato cream sauce and I thought they were just delicious. I tasted gnocchi for the first time at a restaurant and was just dying to make it myself. I'm so pleased that I can now!

This tastes very ordinary with dried potato
flakes, if you can't be bothered to boil some nice fresh potatoes then maybe you should not bother with gnocchi.

Very easy.  The amount of flour did not give me a stiff dough - I had a hard time rolling it into a rope, so I ended up just cutting up the pieces and rolling them into little ball-type pieces.  Very nice recipe - not too dense, great with a tomato cream sauce.  THANKS - never buying frozen gnocchi again.
