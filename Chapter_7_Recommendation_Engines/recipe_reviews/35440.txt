Here's how I made this recipe not so time consuming and it still tasted wonderful. Instead of frying the corn tortillas, just put them in the microwave until they are warm and soft.  They roll up easy and save time and calories. EXCELLENT RECIPE.

My husband, who lived in Mexico for a couple of years and constantly craves good, authentic Mexican food, begs me to make this for him every week. Although the excellent rating speaks for itself, I just had to add our own additions to this fantastic recipe. First of all, we cook our meat in the slow cooker (usually chicken). Spray your crock pot with cooking spray, add your chicken breasts (can double and freeze left over meat), and then add your sauce on top. Now, my personal favorite added in the crock pot is a good BBQ sauce. Many popular Tex-Mex restaurants have their versions of “sweet-meat” enchiladas, but this tastes just as great in this recipe. My husband prefers just adding extra salsa verde from this recipe instead of the BBQ sauce. Cook your chicken for 3-4 hour on high or 6-8 hours on low. Remove chicken and shred with two forks. Return to crock pot and mix with juices. Use this meat with the recipe provided. We also doubled the sauce, reserving a portion for dipping in which I usually add more chilies for my husbands spicier taste. Also make sure to make your tortillas crispy enough because once you add all of the sauces, it can become mushy when cooking. We found that spooning the salsa into the tortillas is just as good as dipping and is so much easier and less messy. We also omitted the green onions and olives for personal preference. We just can't say how much we love this dish! Even my young kids ages 1, 4, and 7 love it! Thanks so much!!!

Unfortunately for others-based off their complaints/recommendations - I made this better for us!! This turned out awesome!! First, I used a can of green chiles but also chopped up a green bell pepper to make 1cup. I then added a GOOD dash of cumin, chili powder, more garlic and a couple drops of hot sauce to the mix. HMMMMM-that part alone was great!! Then, I used flour tortillas (skipped the oil part) and only dipped one side (the "interior") into the chili verde sauce.  I was only able to get 8 tortillas from the batch -which is more than enough. Finally, I used apprx 1/2c half & half instead of heavy cream. Bake for 25 min and placed on a bed of shredded lettuce...GREAT!!! Tastes almost like ones I order at a local mexican restaurant!! If your not afraid to play around with some spices -this is sure to turn out great for you too!! Thank you Lisa!!!

OH.  MY.  GOSH.  If I could give this recipe 100 stars, I would.  This is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted!  I live in California so have had my fair share of great, authentic Mexican cuisine but this by far surpasses any restaurant enchiladas I have ever had.  The only things I did differently were out of necessity due to what I had on hand.  I used a regular instead of Spanish onion, canned green chilies, and omitted the olives and tomatoes.  Everything else I did to a T and I would recommend this to anyone.  If you are going to make this, it is definitely worth the frying and dipping of the tortillas because I have found that is the key to outstanding enchiladas.  Plus, make sure everything is hot before you start assembling so you don't have to bake very long, because the longer they spend in the oven the more mushy the tortillas will be.  If you fry the tortillas, make sure all ingredients are hot, assemble quickly, and bake just until heated through, I guarantee your tortillas will not become mushy or soggy at all.  Oh, and do not be afraid of pouring the heavy cream on top.  I was scared but wanted to follow the recipe as closely as possible and I'm glad I did.  It looked like a lot of cream but it baked into the dish so perfectly.  I am going to be making this again and again and again.  My boyfriend ate literally half the pan it was so good and asked if I could make this once a week!  YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can’t remember the last time I put so little effort into a dish and was so rewarded.  This was just delicious.  I did make a number of changes to simplify this but preparing the recipe as is or with the shortcuts I took will make this equally delicious.  Rather than preparing the salsa from scratch I used my favorite commercial salsa verde (it contains a higher proportion of tomatillos and dang it, I can’t find it anymore!).  I used a prepared rotisserie chicken, which not only is super convenient, but it has so much more flavor than the typical poached chicken breasts.  When it came to filling the tortillas ((I used flour tortillas because I just don’t like corn tortillas), I warmed them briefly one at a time in a skillet with a little oil, then filled them with the chicken that I had mixed with some sour cream and some of the salsa till good and creamy.  And then the cheese of course!  I measured nothing – just filled and rolled, then poured over the salsa, then the cream, until it looked right.  I topped them with more cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking and served them with MORE cheese, chopped tomatoes, black olives, chopped green onion and sour cream. Beautiful.  And so delicious you can’t help eating more than you should.  Side dishes of Maria’s Mexican Rice and Rush Hour Refried Beans, both recipes also from this site, completed the meal.

AWESOME!  These are some of the best enchiladas I've made so far.  I took into consideration some of the reviewers comments about this being a "time consuming" dish.  I bought a pre cooked rotisserie chicken and used that rather than cooking my own and that alone probably cut the prep time in half.  I bought the 6 inch corn tortillas since that's all I could find. I also used some flour tortillas as well (which became a little soggy after a while, but were still good).  I went ahead and added the shredded chicken to the salsa verde and skipped the dipping part.  I filled the tortillas with the mixture and to what was left over, I added the cream and one can of red enchilada sauce, which made this dish outstanding!!  I cannot thank you enough Lisa for this terrific recipe.  I will certainly be using this one again.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe closely. I substituted flour tortillas for the corn, and I used non-stick spray to fry the tortillas, since they seemed to absorb the hot oil.  I also saved time by using 2-4oz cans of chopped green chiles.  They were to die for!  Then I made it again, and increased the chicken to 3 cups and used light cream instead of the heavy cream. They were fantastic again.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I have used this recipe so many times and it has become a definate family favorite!! We substitute fat free sour cream to cut on calories and just mix it with a little with of water to give it a similar consistency to the cup of heavy cream that is called for. It is an absolute delight and we will be enjoying this dish for years to come!

Wonderful!  I made a few changes because I didn't have the right ingredients.  I used flour tortillas, canned green chili peppers and a white onion.  I slashed calories by microwaving the tortillas and using (my favorite substitution)evaporated milk instead of cream.  I also added a tablespoon or so of chopped jalapeno peppers.  Next time I'll probably use more jalapenos for a little extra zip and I'll try evaporated skim milk.

Very good! I roasted some Anaheim chile peppers and jalapenos, and I substituted fat-free half & half for the cream. I also added a little extra cumin and an extra garlic clove to the sauce. I blended the sauce with the half&half. Instead of dipping each tortilla, I put some sauce on the bottom of the pan and a little in the chicken mixture. Then I layed the enchiladas in the pan and poured sauce over the top. I didn't use the olives. Garnished with scallions, sour cream, cilantro and cotija cheese.

This had a nice, subtle flavor.  I used 1/2 c jalapenos and 1/2 c green bell just because that's what I had.  The man wanted more spice to it, so next time I'll make it with the whole cup of chili peppers.  This sauce was tasty!  I suggest doubling it; there was not enough IMHO.  I used a mexican cheese blend, a rotisserie chicken to cut down on prep time and wheat tortillas.  I did not fry the tortillas and I simply put a heaping spoonful of sauce on the inside instead of dipping them.  I greased the baking dish with Pam and used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream.  I got 5 perfectly stuffed 8" enchiladas out of this.  Thank you!

Wow!  Was this ever great!  Thanks for the recipe, Lisa!  I also substituted 2-4 oz. cans green chiles for fresh and used fat free half n half instead of heavy cream and no one knew.  Next time I will layer like a lasagna instead of taking the time to roll the tortillas to save on prep time.  Also the chicken & 'cream' were not hot before going into the oven so it took 45 minutes to bake. I'll make sure all is hot when putting the dish together next time.  Mmmmm!

Edited to add: I have now made this with both corn and fresh flour tortillas.  If you want more of a casserole consistency, go with corn.  If you want more of an enchilada with the most divine sauce ever, go with the fresh flour ones.  If you can't tell, I greatly prefer the flour tortillas.

Unbelievable!  My husband said this is probably some of the best food he has ever eaten.  This will certainly become a staple at our house.  I do think you could use half and half instead of the cream to cut the fat down a little without changing the taste.  I used fresh anaheim chili peppers and some fresh jalapeno peppers the first time.  The second time I used canned green chilis and I think I actually prefered the canned green chilis version- for those who aren't sure which to use.

Loved this!  My husband and I could definitely taste a difference between those tortillas that we fried slightly in oil before stuffing and those that we did not.  The "toasted" ones were much tastier.

Oh my Yum!!  I filled mine w/chile verde and wound up w/9 enchi's.  Added 1 c salsa verde, 1 T diced jalapenos for some kick and about 1 T fresh cilantro to the sauce and ran it all thru my blender to smooth it out.  Used 1/2 c ff half n half (with fewer tortillas in the pan, it didn't really need all of it).  Skipped the green olives & tomatoes.  Oh -- and -- BEST EVER TORTILLA QUICK FIX!... Brush both sides lightly w/oil and toss on a cookie sheet (doesn't need to be in a single layer)...bake at 400 for 10 min's or so -- watch them and toss them around to get evenly done...then drain on the paper towels and go for it!  You HAVE to do them in oil in order for them to finish w/that enchilada consistency we love!  Garnish w/sour cream & avacados.  Way to go Lady Gwyn -- WE LOVED IT!  ( :

My dinner guests exclaimed that it was better than enchiladas from a restaurant! mission accomplished! I slow cooked the chicken with some salsa verda (la victorias) over night and added some jalapena salsa (same brand) to the mixure after shredding. I used the same salsa verde rather than make the one in this recipe to save some time. I used some other reviewer suggestions and used half and half instead of heavy cream and used half corn, half flour tortillas so I could try them both. Both were excellent, but the corn had a really nice flavor - and yes, I fried them and it was worth it. I fried up triangles of my left over tortillas and served them along side with a blended mixture of sour cream, half a bunch of cilantro and salt, and a dash of chipotle pepper. everyone loved this dish.

Oh goodness! these are outstanding! based on other reviews, I made one and a  half times as much sauce, I did not use salt-free broth so I left out the salt. I didn't dip the tortillas in the sauce,(but I did fry them in oil) just covered the bottom of the baking dish with the sauce (which I pureed in the processor)and poured the rest on the top with 3/4 cup half&half.  Scrumptious!! I garnished the top with sliced jalapenos along with the onions and used black olives. Everyone loved them..even my 7y.o. and the teens at the table. I served it with cornbread and for dessert...the margarita cake from this site....SO good! Much of this can be made ahead of time, just assemble and bake.

Just as good if not better than the dish at my fav Mexican restaurant! I've made this several times as the recipe reads - but I've also made it as a lower fat/calorie version and have had equal results. Using fat free and low fat cheeses, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the cream, low sodium/low fat chicken broth and I steamed the tortillas instead of frying them.  I love the verde sauce - it has just enough bite to it without being too spicy. Even my picky kids will eat this.  Thank You Lisa for a great recipe!!

This is an amazing recipe! I live in New Mexico & have access to the best green chiles, so I have tasted great suiza recipes before.  This one was a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious.

I am throwing away my old chicken enchilada recipe.  This was sooooo good!  I prepared it about 2 hours ahead of time up to where you would add the cream.  I added it along with the extra cheese and green onions just before I put it in the oven and it turned out great.  I'll be fighting my husband for the leftovers tomorrow.

This is by far my favorite enchilada recipe! Other than adding extra seasoning to taste, the only change I have made to this is dicing up tomatillos and letting them cook down in the sauce. Gives it just a little extra kick and makes the sauce heartier.

Amazing recipe! As someone who grew up on traditional enchiladas, I wanted to try something different. I have made this one now for my family for years, and we've never been disappointed. However, there are a couple of changes we made and stuck with the first time: we like to make twice the sauce, and use refried beans seasoned with chili or taco seasoning instead of beef or pork, use chopped chicken, and HORDES of cheese. I also don't fry the tortillas first just because I'm a lazy student, but we'll go with the calorie excuse.
The last time I made it, I tried something new by also using beef bouillon cubes instead of fresh chicken stock and while also covering the enchiladas in a canned red enchilada sauce, which made them very salty, but turned out absolutely incredible. 
However, you can't go wrong with the original recipe! Absolutely incredible, and never fails. I'm always talking about it and under constant demand to make it for my family and friends. 
Thanks for this amazing dish!

This was soooo delicious, though I made a few changes.  To spice up the sauce I used one can of chiles and one can of jalapenos.  After the sauce was done simmering I put it in the food processor to make the sauce more smooth.  I also added the olives to the chicken/cheese mixture.  It microwaves well the next day.

for the time it takes to make these it's not really worth it. it'd be easier and taste just as good to use canned green enchilada sauce.

Don't give this recipe * or ** stars after using canned chile peppers... my recommendation DO NOT use canned peppers for an authentic dish. Leave those for nachos.

The first time I made this recipe I'd only have given it four stars but didn't want to rate it until I tried it a second time and made some changes as other reviewers did.  I added a half teaspoon of cumin to the salsa verde.  Skipped the frying of the corn tortillas and just softened them using the microwave.  Used half-and-half and combined it with the remaining salsa verde before pouring over the enchiladas.  Enjoyed it very much!!  Thanks!

These would be great without all the green chilis.  The cup of green chilis makes it very spicy, but just hot spicy, not flavorful spicy.  Next time, I may put just a couple spoonfuls of chopped chilis.

I thought this was OK.  Actually, the only thing I didn't care for was the lack of spice.  With more of a kick, this would be a knock out.  I was sceptical about heavy cream, but it worked wonderfully.  I will make this again, but with more spice...

These are the best enchiladas I've ever made. However, defintely not a quick and easy dish to make. Worth the effort when you have the time.

OMG!  A phenomenal recipe.  I followed it to the "T" and found it to be incredible.  I have lived in Texas 25 years and love TexMex food.  I have ordered this dish in many restaurants.  NONE compare to what I just made in my kitchen!  I read the other reviews and agree with the following:  1.  Use CORN tortillas and prepare them as the recipe says.  Make sure they are fried enough to be a little crunchy. Once cooked, they were not soggy at all.  2.  Use the heavy cream as the recipe directs.  I, too, was a little worried about pouring it on top, but it was perfect.     Thank you for a wonderful dish.

Years ago I used to live in Mexico, and Enchiladas Suizas were among my favorite foods. I've craved them for so long, and was thrilled to find this recipe! I often do the same as other reviewers, and use a rotisserie chicken to save on prep. I've made these either with jalapeño or poblano chiles, depending on how much heat I want. I'd say use maybe 2.5 cups of chicken to fill them out a bit more, and I usually end up using 1.5-2 cups of the cream (hey, it comes in pints anyway--why waste it?!!). I also substitute oregano for the cumin; I'm not a fan of cumin, plus I think too many people just add a lot of cumin to dishes and call them Mexican. (Actually oregano is a more "authentic" spice, depending on the region!). Then I follow the rest of the recipe to the letter, and they turn out wonderfully. I might try adding queso fresco to the cheese topping some day, but so far these enchiladas are fantastic--they take me straight back to Guanajuato every time!!

Absolutely delicious!  And for those of us who can't eat a lot of spices, this recipe tastes great even without the dash of cumin.  
Use Fresh peppers (the green chile peppers refer to green Anaheim peppers for those of you like me who are always confused on exactly what peppers are being used in recipes...I googled it to make sure I was getting the right kind) are worth the time of dicing them up! (and they are really inexpensive!)...much better than canned!
**I also used a corn tortilla brand that boasts being "homemade"...they were very thick and fluffy and really made this recipe perfect.  Definitely splurge for the extra few calories and fry the tortillas first.  Also, next time I will PUREE the verde sauce after simmering to further appease my texture-picky 6 year old eater (who surprisingly LOVED this recipe despite the pieces of onion/peppers that weren't cooked into oblivion) for a nice smooth sauce.  Used Half and Half mixed with Sour cream to save some calories at the end instead of heavy cream.  Will ABSOLUTELY be making this again!  Thank you SO much for sharing!  You HAVE to try this recipe!

We really liked this we also did not fry the tortillas and we always double the sauce.  My family likes to put it on everything they eat till it is gone.  The little ones like it to because it has tons of flavor without the heat.

I followed the recipe as directed including frying the tortillas in oil before filling: it's fantastic. The corn tortillas held up great. The sauce was a nice change from typical enchilada sauces, though I think next time I'll warm up whatever picante salsa I have lying around and just use that. I spooned the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas and then added the cream as directed, but we had a problem with not all of the cream absorbing. Next time I will try drizzling with half-and-half (very rich with heavy cream) before the leftover sauce goes on top. Thanks very much for sharing, I'll look no further for a great enchilada recipe :)

These were awesome!!!! I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. I added a can of crushed tomatillos to the sauce as it was simmering (I found them at my local grocery store while browsing the Mexican food aisle). I skipped frying the tortillas because I thought it was unnecessary and just added more work and clean up to the process. I also bought a can of black beans and added a little into each enchilada as I was filling them; I wanted to add more fiber and protein. These were amazing, SO flavorful!!! I'm making them this Sunday for a church potluck and I know they'll be a hit!

This recipes is soooo good.  I didn't have any chicken broth so I used chicken "better than boullion" instead.  I also used a 7oz can of diced green chilis instead of fresh. I used a 4 cheese Mexican blend instead of the Monterey Jack/cheddar.  I used more cheese than called for because we like a lot of cheese.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my was it good.  I like it better than the enchiladas with red sauce that I make.  Will definitely make these again.  I bet my husband will make these with some pheasant that he has also.

These were incredible!  I made a few changes...took the advice of others & doubled the sauce.  Put some in bottom of dish and spooned some inside on top of chicken instead of dipping the tortillas.  Mixed the remainder with the heavy cream & poured on top.  Used sharp cheddar, mont. jack and jalapeno jack cheese (almost double the amount called for because we LOVE cheese).  Also added some hot diced green chiles and some jalapenos from a jar.  My family cant wait to have these again.  Thank you for a wonderful meal!!!!

These enchiladas are delicous!  A friend made them for me and I immediately requested the recipe.  They are labor intensive, but well worth it in the end.  A great dish to make for company.

This is a keeper for me. I customized the recipe slightly based on previous reviews. I used 1/2 green chiles and 1/2 poblanos and added a small amount of jalepenos to personal taste. I also increased the cumin to 3/4 tsp and the garlic to 2 cloves. I followed the suggestion of using less oil to fry the tortillas and added the salsa to the filling rather than dipping the tortillas. I also found,as some of the other reviewers, the need to make more salsa the next. Definitely worth trying at least once if you're looking for a good enchilada.

This is one of my favorite dishes, but I am often disappointed when I order it because the flavors are often too mild.  This recipe is great!  I used canned green chilis and omitted tomatos and olives.  The key was using just a very small amount of oil for each tortilla (less than a teaspoon).  These are great topped with sour cream.  Next time I may add some hot sauce or cayenne to the sauce to spice it up a bit.

A couple years ago someone brought these enchiladas to our house after I had a baby.  My husband LOVED them and I've been trying to find the recipe since.  These are wonderful!  And even more wonderful I was able to use some other reviews and make them less fattening.  I just warmed the tortillas in the microwave to soften them instead of frying them.  I also used evaporated milk instead of cream and they were wonderful.  I added a little chili powder, more cumin, and hot sauce to the green chili sauce but it could use some more flavor.  I'm not sure what.  I won't complain though because either way they were wonderful.  Just a mild flavor to them.

Really, really good - I made this exactly as written, but I didn't dip the torillas in the green sauce.  I just poured it all over the top.  It didn't make a difference and it was a whole lot less messy.  Really yummy, my teenage kids gobbled it up!

This was so good - no leftovers at all!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I followed the directions exactly, but there were a few problems.  First, there was not enough sauce for 12 tortillas.  The amount of cheese the recipe called for was not enough either.  That was easy to see as I was preparing the dish, so I corrected it by doubling the amount of cheese.  All in all, this is a great recipe.  I’ll probably add more cumin next time.  What is a “dash” anyway?  I figured it was about ¼ tsp.  Next time I’ll add a whole teaspoon.

Yummmmm!!  I couldn't wait to get out here to write a review - I'm still chewing my enchilada - I followed the recipe with these exceptions; I used a different chicken filling I had in the freezer which I had stewed, shredded and added to sauted tomatoes,green pepper,onions,marjorum,black pepper and cilantro. I was kind of leary when I poured the cream over the enchiladas, in fact I stopped at 3/4 C as another reviewer said it was too much cream.  I wish I hadn't because the cream baking together with the green chile sauce is what made this so delish.  I fried the first two tortillas and then tried softening some in the micro. Fry them, it's worth the extra calories.  The microwaved one's fell apart while rolling. Since we love cheese I topped with an additional 1/2 C. and I used a store bought Mexican blend.  I put chopped roma tomatoes on top along with the green onions, before baking. The olives after baking made a nice presentation.  I did have to bake them about 40 mins. because I let everything cool down and I made 6 large enchiladas instead of 12 small.  I will be making these again, soon!! No leftovers here.

These were great! Followed the recipe except cooked the shredded chicken in lime juice and chili powder before adding. This is a time consuming recipe, next time I make it, I'll make ahead and add the cream just before cooking. These taste like something you would order a a REAL mexican restaurant. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a homerun for my family!!  We love spicy food, so I made the salsa verde with serrano chiles and it was a hit!!  I would definately make this again, and again...and again!

I only made the salsa verde part of this recipe,
using 2x4oz. chopped green chiles,adding l/4 tsp. ground cumin,  some juice from a jar of jalapenos, and 3 fresh, whole roasted jalapenos ground in the food processor.  My husband and our neighbor *never* think anything is 'hot' enough, and our neighbor said "wow!"  My husband would never admit it, but I saw him wiping the sweat from his face :-)  The first time I served it was with 'Roberta Haferkamp's' recipe for fajitas.  The second day, I made another batch of salsa to cover enchiladas made with the leftover meat, which had excellent flavor.

Excellent and much easier than I thought it would be.  Like others, I did not fry the corn tortillas, just dipped them in the sauce and I substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  They still came out great with those calorie saving changes.  I may have used more cheese and chicken than called for- the recipe easily fed six of us with some left over.  I made corn and black bean salad from this site to serve with the enchiladas- a wonderful combination.

Fabulous flavor ... but the amount of sauce could easily be cut in half. All that sauce made the tortillas very mushy and unappealing.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!  Well worth the time and effort it takes to make it.  The only tip I'd give is that the cream called for is too much, about 1/4 is needed, in fact, last time I used just a touch of (skim!) milk in the bottom of the pan to prevent dryness and it was still wonderful.

First of all, this is the MOST DELICIOUS enchilada recipe EVER!  I’ve made this recipe many times as is.  The salsa verde is heavenly.  Today I made them again and I decided to experiment a little.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and taco seasoning to start.  Shredded the chicken with two forks which makes it super easy. I made a little extra salsa verde since I could probably just drink it for a meal.  Instead, I removed one cup and put it in a small sauce pan with two tablespoons of cream cheese.  Melted that and then put the shredded chicken in there to create a gooey madness.  I fried up the tortillas (corn and flour) with some non stick spray. Then scooped some of that gooey madness into a tortilla.  Sprinkled with Monterrey Jack cheese and rolled those

Delicious! I use flour tortillas, beef and omit the green olives and cherry tomatoes....and you have perfect enchiladas with this recipe. The cream is a big deal, don't skip it.

Added the chicken to the salsa verde for the last few minutes to blend together. Then I had one less scooping to do! Used half and half instead of cream because that's what I had - worked well. Husband really liked these. I thought the filling was good, but maybe could use a little extra something in the covering.

This recipe is so special. I was conservative with the cream poured on top but glad that I didn't leave it out.  I am lucky enough to have access to New Mexico green chiles, which made the dish even greater!   This recipe is a real keeper - The sauce alone will be great to use on dishes like smothered burritos or tucked into scrambled egg breakfast burritos and also spooned on top!

This is an excellent recipe. I used fresh jalepenos and anaheim peppers. It could have been a little bit spicier but you never know what your going to get with those peppers. Flavor was spot on and the cream is what puts this over the top. I used a large lasagna pan and spaced out the echiladas about a 1/2 inch apart so they stayed individual and didn't cook like a casserole. My husband said this is better than any restaurant. Highly recommend this recipe.

The best enchiladas I have ever made.  Sauce was great.  I followed the recipe as written mostly.  I diced up a green bell pepper and a large onion and cooked that in the butter first.  I added half of those to the chicken to give the chicken more flavor and the remaing half i used for the sauce.  I used fresh Anaheim peppers and one small jalapeño.  After it was done simmering I used a hand emulsion blender to thin it out.  This was a little more work than opening a can of sauce, but so worth it.

Excellente! didn't change a thing- followed recipe exactly.. amazing. as for frying them it didn't really give a good estimate as to how long to fry them.. I let the oil sit on medium heat(old electric stove) for a while then about 15 seconds or more each side. might help someone.. Oh, and try to make sure things are warmed up ahead of time- I didn't heat the heavy cream though first and it turned out great! Thanks!

Minus the olives, this is one of my 2 year old's favorite meals. I usually add a couple of diced tomatillos to the salsa verde mixture; also use what cheese I have on hand. I prefer flour tortillas, but the rest of the family likes the corn. Great recipe. Thanks!

I always know a recipe is a keeper when my husband requests it for dinner again! The first time I made this, I accidentally used jalapenos instead of green chiles, and it tasted good, so now I use a mixture of green chiles and jalapenos. Also, I did not have any Monterrey Jack so I used 4 oz cream cheese. I did not roll up the enchiladas and instead layered the tortillas, sauce, cream, cheese, etc. into a casserole, which made it much less time consuming! Very, very yummy recipe I'll be making many times in the future.

Absolutely Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as it was, and then added sliced jalepenos (jarred) on top with the green onions before baking.  It added that spicieness that my husband and I love!  Great recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This is soooo good that it deserves maximum stars. I followed others and fried corn tortillas in cooking spray, dipped in green sauce, rolled chicken & cheese inside. Added red enchilada sauce (1 C) to the verde mixture over the top. Oh, used fresh roasted green chilis, too. Skipped green onions but added cherry tomatoes and green olives, along with avocado. My entire family loved it so much we ate every bite in one evening (four adults). Absolutely delicious - thanks for recipe. This is a keeper!

Love this!  The Salsa Verde is out of this world!  I ended up having to make it as a casserole instead of enchiladas since I was out of corn tortillas.  I used tortilla chips and layered them with the chicken, salsa verde and cheese ending with a layer of cream and then the remaining cheese.  Can't say enough good things about the salsa verde!

This is the BEST thing I have ever made! My husband liked it!! And that is saying a lot because he doesn't like anything if I didn't come from a restaurant! Ladygwyn, I love you! lol! I made the salsa verde and poured it over 4 chicken breasts in the crockpot, cooked on high for 5ish hours. Removed chicken and shredded. Transfered remaining salsa to pot and boiled down with about 1tbsp of corn starch until it was thicker. I also more cumin then called for, used about 1/2 tsp. This was delish. Frying the tortillas made them nice and crunchy and not soggy at all. I only used about 1/2 cup crea that I mixed with 3/4 cup salsa verde. PERFECT recipe. Will definitely make again!!!!!!

Very good!  Next time, I will make extra sauce so that I can use it to cook the chicken in the crock pot as others have recommended.  I used some cayenne for a little more zip and used a little less cream.  These can be a little mushy so I might try cutting the cream a little more.  Served with shredded lettuce & sour cream.

I LOVED this recipe! The green sauce was outstanding and so easy to make. This is definitely NOT a low-fat meal but substituting half/half or milk would be too thin for the recipe and make it soupy. Frying the tortillas really brings out the flavor, but they have to be just right. The trick is to fry them in HOT oil quickly and when you think they are nearly too done, they will be perfect once they are stacked and have a couple of minutes to steam in the paper towels before rolling. Thank you so much for sharing this excellent recipe!

I made this only with a few alterations.  Used 1/2 cup of heavy cream instead of a whole cup, added two roasted fresh poblano peppers, and roasted bone-in chicken breasts in the oven with epazote and garlic salt.  Those were the only changes.  This recipe is fantastic!  Better than I've had in any restaurant.

Excellent recipe! Do yourself a favor and double the salsa verde. Add 1 T. garlic powder and 1 t. of cumin. Do not fry the tortillas in oil. Simply spray with olive oil or canola spray and heat in very hot cast iron skillet until wilted. Also, I used 16 oz. of cheese. 2 cups didnt even fill the 8 tortillas I used. I also used 4 cups of chicken, not two. We don't do skimpy around here! I added the heavy cream to the salsa verde at the very end and heated it slightly before pouring it all on the enchiladas. My husband said this is a 10 star recipe, it was incredibly easy and delicious, tasted very authentic. I make my own chicken broth and grow and roast my own chiles. Thanks a ton for the best enchiladas I have ever made!

Spectacular chicken enchiladas!  Made as directed, and the only thing we didn't care for was the green olives--the olives totally overpowered the mild flavors of the enchiladas.   When we went back for seconds, nobody had the olives.  When we make it again, and we will, there will be black olives instead.

Delicious! Frying the tortillas gives them nice crispy edges, so don't skip this step. I used a serrano chile and although my 8 yr old said it was spicy, he ate it all. I did strain out the onion and chile pieces before pouring over the enchiladas -- i would prefer to throw it all in a blender to get all that hotness mixed together. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks so much!

I had made the Roast Sticky Rotisserie Chicken and had left over chicken.  I made this using Pam sprayed tortillas cooked over high heat.  I then used only 2 t. oil to cook the onions and then added some chicken stock and then the flour and cooked the flour until golden.  I then added the rest of the chicken broth and spices.  I didn't have the chilies but I did have some green enchilada sauce so just added 1/2 a can of that.  I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream, and 2% cheese.  Very yummy and will definitely make again with the left over chicken we always seem to have.

I'm not giving this 5 stars because any recipe that ends up being another excuse to eat a lot of cheese and chicken without being called cheese and chicken (as if the guilt would go away!) doesn't deserve 5 stars.  Does this recipe taste good?  YES!  Do my kids it?  YES!  Was it hard to make?  Not really.  Was it company-worthy?  Probably.   Now, I need to find a recipe that combines lima beans, eggplant, brussel sprouts and cottage cheese in a tasty way, and I'll give that 50 stars!

This dish is AMAZING! If you dip the corn tortillas in oil, it gives them a more authentic flavor. My Dad grew up in Mexico and he loved this dish.  I will definitely be making this again!

Wow! Hubby said he was tempted to eat all 6 servings in one session. Thanks for the great tip on slow cooking the chicken in favorite BBQ sauce. Super yummy. Thanks also for the microwaving tip. Saved us some calories and time. I think I could get by just as well with half and half rather than heavy cream. But still, what a GREAT dish!!

I make these all the time, and I'm finally reviewing them! These are the best enchiladas, they are the only enchiladas I make. I've made them for guests, and they get rave reviews. One thing I do change slightly is I increase the amounts of the sauce just slightly. The amount of sauce the recipe calls for just does it. I prefer slightly more. Also a can of chicken broth is 2 cups, so it's convienient. Also I make 10 every time, I can't seem to get 12 from the amounts of everything else. Oh, and I add more cheese than whats called for.
Overall this is a really awesome recipe!

I would give this a 100 stars if I could! I used bottled salsa verde and it was still delicious.  Also, it is worth the effort and mess to fry your tortillas and dip them in the salsa...don't skip that step!  I seasoned my chicken with seasoning salt and lots of garlic (I don't like cumin).  For my tortillas I layered chicken, cheese, and green chilies (out of a can).  I also topped the whole dish with some Queso cheese dip (I think I used tostitos brand) in addition to the cream.

Finger licking good. Great for a party because you can prepare ahead and put them in the fridge and put cream and cheese on top just before cooking. I did not soak them in cream and I used sour cream instead of heavy cream.

This recipe was awesome!  There were a couple of things that I changed.  I added red pepper, green pepper, and onion stir fry to the enchiladas.  I also added a little bit more water to the gravy.  Also, instead of dipping the tortillas in the salsa verde (after frying them), I waited to pour the salsa verde over the  rolled enchiladas in the baking dish.  This made them a whole lot more moist.  I do recommend making more salsa verde for left overs.  The next day the enchiladas were a bit dry.  Overall, awesome recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!!  A bit time consuming, but well worth the effort.  I usually double the sauce.  Used low sodium chicken broth and added extra cumin.  I've fried the tortillas and have also made just heating them in the microwave.  Both have worked well.

This one is a keeper, very flavorful and easy to make. Make the salsa verde early enough to have it cool enough to handle when you dip the tortillas.

This was one of the best chicken enchilada recipes I have made.  They had very good flavor, but not spicy at all.  If you are looking for lots of zip and spice, this isn't the one for you.  Allow yourself plenty of prep time, but once they are ready for the oven, it goes quick.  Prepare the chicken a day ahead to save you time.

I couldn't for the life of me find corn tortillas, so I had to use the soft flour kind.  The end result, I thought, was rather soggy, although my boyfriend disagreed and went for seconds. In the future, if I make this again (and am again forced to use flour tortillas), I think that I will roll up the filling (without diping the tortilla in the salsa), brush the outside with olive oil, and bake these chimichanga-style and leave the salsa verde sauce on the side.  That way I won't have to worry about sogginess.

As for the flavour, I give it a 4 star rating because I marinated the chicken first.  If I hadn't, I think the taste would have been bland, and I would have had to give this dish a 3-star.

Delicious. The peppers I got were not spicy at all, so I added some store-bought salsa. Best enchiladas I've ever had, and I've never even made them before.

These enchiladas are excellent.  These were far superior to the ones we get at our favorite restaurant!  These are now a regular item in our house.  We made them vegetarian, using tempeh, but they would also be good with only cheese.  The only change I made was to add more raw onion in the filling of the enchilada, and use flour tortillas.

I loved these enchiladas. Great change from the red sauce ones. I used flour tortills, since the corn ones I found were way too small, plus I didn't want to take the time to fry them in all that oil.  But it still came out great.  My alterations follow. I didn't dip the flour tortilla in the salsa verde because I didn't want the bottom to get too too soggy, and I lightly buttered the casserole dish so it wouldn't stick. I also spread a little cream cheese on the tortilla, added the cheese (blend of 4 mexican cheeses, then the chicken, then rolled it.  It made the filling creamier.  I also boiled the chicken in salt water and added Adobo seasoning to the water as well.  I also added a little taco seasoning once the chicken was shredded, since it was kind of bland. I also used two cups of cheese for the top. I could eat them once a week!

I used flour tortillas as well, and there was way too much sauce!  I agree with the other comments as well, there was not enough seasoning and I even added extra.  Something about the heavy cream just didn't taste right. It was fun to make though... thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! To save time I used canned salsa verde and chopped up Louis Rich chicken strips. I served this dish with shredded lettuce, Spanish rice, guacamole, sour cream and the diced tomatoes & olives. It took 40 minutes tops from start to table.

This recipe is soooo good! The salsa verde is wonderful.  It is a pretty time consuming recipe, so to make it quick I double the recipe and use corn chips instead of tortillas.  I make it like a casserole and layer everything like lasagna. It's really pretty fast this way and it's easier to serve too.

Don’t skip the step where you lightly fry the corn tortillas. It keeps the enchiladas from turning to mush, and it only adds maybe 5 minutes to the process. I cheated and used canned chicken because I had a bunch in the pantry, and they STILL tasted amazing. If your enchiladas can survive canned chicken, you know they can survive just about anything!

Best enchiladas I've ever made and not too difficult. I was skeptical about the amount of heavy cream and putting all the green sauce over the enchiladas, but they weren't soupy at all! I followed the recipe as is and was very happy. Will be making again.

Followed recipe except I took a couple shortcuts.  Instead of making Salsa verde, I bought canned from the Mexican food aisle,  dribbled canned green chilies over the top at the end, and cooked the bonless, skinless chicken in the instapot with salsa.  I also browned the tortillas in a non stick pan instead of oil just to get a beautiful brown on them. The result was a fairly quick, fairly easy and utterly delicious dish that is a new favorite.

My first review on this site.      Wow, just wow. Made a few changes, used flour tortillas, did not pre cook them, omitted green chilies and olives, also used half n half milk verses the heavy cream, slow cooked the chicken for 4 hours on high in chicken broth with some Montreal steak seasoning, will definitely have too make this one again and again. I live in Tennessee and way too hard too find good Mexican food here, so this recipe is a blessing. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it to bring to my sisters house. Everyone raved about it, and since it's a family of cooks that was high praise! I made it basically the same except I made it gluten free by subbing gluten free flour for the flour. After reading reviews I doubled the sauce and used light sour cream instead of heavy cream, and half teaspoon of cumin instead of the dash. I also added two minced jalapenos with the onions.

I used a generous cup of pasilla chile peppers diced up seeds and all. Since I didn't want a chunky sauce, I blended the finished sauce before assembling the enchiladas. This gave the sauce a nice light green color. I had to add a little more water/broth to thin it out for dipping. A new family favorite!

Love this recipe! Frying the tortillas give them a cripsy and chewy texture instead of soggy. It's definitely worth the effort. Also - this meal is great with Lusty Lime Virgin, a N/A beverage recipe on allrecipes.com

Double the salsa verde, don't bother with dipping the tortillas or frying them, add corn and black beans to the filling. I prefer to use the "super soft" flour tortillas (personal taste preference). This is a super awesome, fail-proof recipe and is delicious every time. I've also used beef, pulled pork, or shrimp in place of the chicken and it's delicious. These freeze well, too.

this dish is amazing! I make gluten free tortillas instead and i use a 1/2 cup more broth because homemade tortillas absorb more liquid and I use canned chilies because its cheaper and easier. But this also makes great leftovers and i am not exaggerating when I say there is a lot of food from this dish.

This is the best enchilada recipe I have tried. I cut down on the prep time by following the advice of other reviewers and slow cooking the chicken in bottled salsa verde, and then added some of the ingredients in the recipe such as onions, cumin, jalepeno pepper, etc.  . I used 3 chicken breasts which was enough for 10-12 enchiladas. I also spooned dollops of sour cream on top vs. the heavy cream and it was great. I paired this with Mexican Rice III from this site which was also excellent. Next time I will make this for company.

This is a great recipe! I was looking for something to use up leftover chicken. I had to modify it slightly just because I'm one of those people who uses what I have on hand rather than making my shopping list from recipes. With flour tortillas and a can of jalapenos (what's the use of green chiles -- they have no heat to speak of) this was absolutely fantastic!

This was fantastic.  I have made this 3 times now, and it is great!  Like others, I wanted to cut the calories a bit, so I used evaporated milk instead of cream, and I fried the tortillas in cooking spray.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese (with some cumin) to mix with the chicken instead of shredded cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  I really recommend taking the time to made the sauce rather than just using a store-bought salsa verde.  There is a huge difference!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I took the advice of another reviewer and crock-pot cooked my chicken breast.  I used cumin, bay leaves, dried basil, coriander powder, 5 whole cloves of garlic and half a white onion and slow-cooked the chicken for 4 hours.  The aroma was fantastic.  The last hour, I added half a can of chile verde enchilada sauce and let it cook.  I fried my tortillas and I do believe it makes the dish taste more authentically Mexican, like my best friend in high school's grandma used to make, and keeps the tortillas from breaking when you roll.  I removed the chicken from the crock pot and then added the remaining can of sauce to cook while I shredded the chicken and assembled the rolls.  I skipped dipping the tortillas in sauce.  But I did take a hand blender and pureed in the crock the chicken drippings/chile verde sauce, cooked garlic and onions all together.  Poured on top of the rolls in a casserole dish, then added heavy whipping cream over top.  Baked at 400 deg (350 is too low) for 25 min.  It was really yummy.  All the flavors came together and the top layer of enchiladas were a little crispy but not too hard, due to the fact we fried already.  The sauce had much more depth because of the chicken drippings, garlic, onions and additional spices.

Super recipe we love it---I use Pam in the frying pan and it works good to cut out the fat-it warms them up enough to roll just fine.
The flavor is a great combination...make them quite often!

Wow!  These were absolutely delicious!  I even cheated and used canned chicken and cooked it with a sliced green pepper and they were still wonderful.  Something about that salsa verde sauce - oh my goodness!  I will most certainly make these again.  Made me feel like and authentic Mexican cook!  Definitely one of my favorite recipes!  Only changes I really made were the addition of the green pepper, canned chicken (2 large cans), and I used a chopped jalapeno pepper instead of the cup of green chile peppers.  Oh, and I also doubled the salsa verde sauce cause it was so good, I wanted more to pour over the enchiladas! =)

This is absolutely resturant quality recipe!  I had cooked up a big pork roast the night before for 10 hours low heat in the crock pot.  The next day I shredded it with forks, and added cold salsa verde ingredients to the pork in the morning to save time.  At dinner,  I made more salsa verde sauce for dipping the tortillas and to cover them lightly with it like the recipe says.   I wasn't going to fry the tortillas but after I did, I see that this is key to the great texture.  Aslo, I wouldn't not leave out the heavy cream this really added to the flavor.  It does look like it will be too much wet...but the cream settled perfectly on the bottom and made a great sauce while the top was more cheesey and harder texture. The garnishes were perfect, and combining spanich rice, and refried beans, and authentic chips ( don't settle for the brand name chips) it was like eating out...and saving a ton of money!  It'd be a great recipe to use for a night of margaritas with friends and family.  I am wondering how i can make this ahead and freeze it.   Probably make it all up...and then pour the salsa verde and cream over it just before it's put in the oven???

It was 'okay', to me, it didn't have a lot of flavor.  I think the heavy cream washed out the flavor and made it taste more on the bland side.

Sooooo DELICIOUS!  I used canned diced green chills since our grocery didn't have the fresh.  Absolutely LOVED THEM!!  I definitely think frying the corn tortillas was key, too, so I wouldn't skip that part.  Love the touch of olives, too!  YUM.

Delicious.  I made them exactly as stated, except I doubled the sauce.  My Mexican boyfriend said he was in food heaven.  I don't even like Enchiladas and I loved these.  I didn't think I would like the green olives on it, but I think they are a must for the flavor.

Wonderful. I was a little nervous to pour the cream on top of the enchiladas, but I am glad I did.  They came out great.  My husband and two out of three kids loved them.

This was an awesome recipe! I substituted pepperjack cheese but that was it - IT WAS AMAZING! My family is already asking when I'm going to make the next batch. If you are skeptical, don't be. You'll be glad to you took these for a spin!

Great flavor! I boiled the chicken, but next time I will use a slow cooker. I added more garlic and cumin than listed, and skipped the green olives. The salsa verde is delicious!

Mmm... addictive. Used slightly less cheese and cream to make it a little healthier and it turned out great! Didn't skip frying the tortillas, though - I feel the slightly crunchy tortillas really added to the dish. The only change I would make next time would be to add some spices to the chicken itself. Mm.... I already want more!

This is my favorite enchiladas recipe.  I never fry the tortillas though, and one time all I had was heavy whipping cream.  The heavy whipping cream was amazing in this dish and I now make it that way.

This was not spicy at all and I was looking for some bite. I will try hotter peppers next time. Also, I would recommend buying larger and thinker tortillas - mine fell apart and so I could only pour the sauce over the cold wrapped tortillas. Still good quality sauce but needs some work for me.

Made this last night for dinner to rave reviews.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of the chilies for added kick.  Very, very tasty!

This enchilada recipes was a HIT!!  My husband bought flour tortillas instead of corn (which I was not happy about), but it ended up be the better!  I will gladly use flour over corn every time I make this recipe.   I ended up making this dish again a few days later but used less cream before putting in the over.  Other than that, this is an AMAZING recipe that I would recommend to everyone!

Loved this! Just enough kick and full of flavor. I didn't have enough green chilis, so I used what I had and then some chopped bell pepper. I thought the garlic and cumin were just right. Made this with pork. I will probably never use red sauce for my enchiladas again! Thanks!

This was soooo good!  I have never made Enchilada's before and was pleasantly surprised how this came out.  I did omit a step and did not fry the tortilla's but warmed them in the microwave as another person has suggested.  Tasted wonderful!

The green chili sauce alone is a great recipe.  But this is very tasty, and all the leftovers got eaten in a non-leftover eating house!!  Great recipe!

WOW!!  I made these enchiladas for Mother's Day and my wife's first reaction was "Oh My Gosh!"  She said she found her new favorite food.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked the chicken in the crock pot with some of the green salsa.  I also served it black beans and spanish rice on the side with a squeeze of lime.  This is a definite keeper and we will be making this a lot more often.  Thank you!!

Tasty and fairly easy. Left out green chiles and added more onions and bell peppers for salsa verde sauce and used my immersion blender to make the sauce more uniform. Used a store bought rotisserie chicken and did half chicken and half sauteed veggie. Used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream like another reviewer suggested. Served with freshly made salsa and sour cream. Very good!

5 stars for taste, 4 overall just because we can't indulge too often due to calories and fat!  But sooo tasty.  I think the flavor wouldn't suffer if I used 1/2 and 1/2 so I will do that next time instead of heavy cream.  I just warmed the tortillas in the microwave to save time and that worked fine.

Had some green chilis from the gardend that I didn't know what to do with.  I am so glad I tried this recipe!   Yum!  These were so good....better than going out!  Boiled chicken in broth & used some leftover evaporated milk rather than cream.

okay at first I thought these were dry...then i figured out that i forgot to put the cream on..the flavors were really really good.  i will try with the cream on when we eat the leftovers.  Regardless..I will FOR SURE double the green chili sauce next time.  Also, I used a purple onion cus I thought that would give it nice flavor and it did.  I cooked two chicken breast in salsa.  I just put the frozen chicken  in a sauce pan with the lid on for about 30 min. I then but into chunks and then put in my food chopper...the chicken was not only full of flavor but light a fluffy. perfect for making enchiladas

These were just okay for our family. No one asked for seconds, my 10 year old son gave them a 3 out of 10 stars.  For the calories I won't make again I don't think.  Thanks for sharing!

Made these exactly as the recipe said and they did not come out at all.  The salsa was waaay to runny and they just came out as mush.  Will keep looking for an enchilada recipe.  The flavor was great though.  Will use the same flavor combination to make a casserole.

Tese were VERY time consuming and not worth the time. They were just alright.I would rather use the canned green chile sauce and make it caserole style.

AH-MAZ-ZING.  Made this exactly (almost), Just added half Jalepeno's for green chile's (we like it spicy).  Other than that, followed to a T.  Doubled salsa verde (AWESOME).  We loved it.  Made very well stuffed, 12 enchilada's.  Don't skip on any step, it's what makes this special (messy, but special). Served with Yellow rice, and a nice Chardonnay.  Good Stuff. Time consumming, but worth every step.  Enjoy!

Very, very good!  Have made twice, will make again definitely.  Cooked the chicken in crockpot with chicken broth, taco seasoning, hot sauce, and garlic before shredding, then put back in liquid in crock pot on warm after shredding until ready to use.  Used Ole Low Carb tortillas instead of corn, worked great.  The first time I made this I only had 1/2 c of green chiles and made up the difference with salsa, and I think I actually preferred it that way.  Also used half and half rather than heavy cream because that was all I had on hand.

Not bad but not great.  I followed the recipe exactly and I probably wouldn't make it again.

Great recipe!  I used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream to cut on some fat and it was still wonderful!  Also made delicious leftovers!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fabulous!!! We made this for a non-traditional Christmas dinner and had no leftovers! And I have had many requests since to make them again. I did saute 1 cup of onions, bell peppers and mushrooms to add to the chicken and cheese filling since my family eats more vegetables than meat-- but that is the only thing I changed! This recipe is a winner!

To die for! I love this dish and so does everyone I make it for! I slow cook the chicken in red enchilada sauce, use canned chilis to save time and spread sour cream over the top instead of heavy cream. I also drizzle some of the red enchilada sauce over the top. Try this recipe...it's worth the effort!

Unbelievable!  The homemade salsa verde is encredible!  For shredded chicken, I followed a common recipe of poaching the chicken breasts in boiling water for 20 minutes with a few onion slices and a couple of garlic cloves.  I also cooked the enchiladas in a cast-iron skillet (same one used for frying the tortillas).  I had to use flour tortillas instead of corn and I would suggest you brush the oil on instead of frying them in a pool of it- they'll just get too oily and soggy if you do.

I was looking for an enchilada recipe to serve for dinner for friends.  My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was I used canned green chiles.  I wasn't sure about adding the heavy cream, but it turned out so good.  I can't wait to see how our friends like them.  Definitely a five star recipe!

This recipe was incredible! I did make a few changes, but still kept close enough to the original recipe to rate it a perfect 5 stars!  I used pre-packaged enchilada-size tortillas made with corn flour and didn't fry them, in an attempt to cut some fat, and found them to be soft enough out of the package. I added a bit more spice to the salsa verde: a heavy dash of each of the following: cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, as well as a small dash of cayenne pepper. I also minced 3 cloves of garlic instead of the one called for in the recipe. Instead of the two types of cheese, I used a Mexican blend of shredded cheese and a half cup of 1/2 & 1/2 as opposed to the full cup of heavy cream. I was only able to get 10 enchiladas into my pan, and all ten disappeared in a flash. LOVED IT!!!!

3 years later - STILL SO SO GOOD! I make them at least once a month and every time they come out better than before!

I made this according to instructions, only added more cumin (cumin makes a chicken enchilada recipe, I think), and instead of frying the tortillas, I dipped them in a small saute pan of simmering half and half (which I substituted for the heavy cream). It came out beautifully. Outstanding recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, but used a white onion, canned green chiles, and black olives instead of green.  What a scary feeling pouring heavy cream over enchilads, but it was Super! I had a 7 oz generic and a 4 oz brand name of green chiles - there was a HUGE difference in taste and texture (taste was bitter and lots of stems and inedible skins in the generic).  Stick to the major brands!

Very time consuming but awesome.

I didn't have time to make the green chili from scratch (mainly because for optimum flavor you should let any green chili sit over night, try it with this recipe I am sure it will be even better) so I used some incredible green chili from our local grocers.  It is so creamy and not too cheesy, it was gone in a second. We didn't have green olives and used black olives instead...I won't even try green olives now because the black olives were so tasty and colorful.  This will be made again and again.

Yes, very good. Not spicy enough for my family - adding more cumin next time. Used flour tortillas, colby jack for cheddar and added a bit of bottled salsa verde to sauce.  It was a nice break from my regular standby.  Whole family enjoyed it.

I really loved the idea of dipping the fried tortillas in the salsa.  I used the jarred version and I would never skip the tortilla frying part.  It makes them really taste authentic.  If you don't have heavy cream use a condensed cream of chicken mushroom.  Delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was such a hit with me and my daughter. She's ten and had three for herself. I made this with mexican rice and mexican corn cake as side dishes. It was sooo good. It does take a bit longer than I prefer because of my big family and not enough time in the day but it was worth it.

These were good, but didn't have the "wow" factor I was looking for. I used whole wheat tortillas, which worked fine, & I added a chopped jalapeno to the salsa. Definately don't skip frying the tortillas, I think that enhances the flavor. Overall, ok, just not exactly what I was looking for. Thanks tho!!

My husband, who usually doesn't like creamy casserole-y dishes, asks for this one.  It's rich, takes a long time to prepare, but apparently it's worth it.  If you're going to use canned chilis instead of fresh, be careful you don't buy jalepenos.  The cans look exactly the same, but the flavor is oh-so-different.  Yikes.  I had to throw out a batch.

Finally an enchilada recipe my husband likes!! This was so, so good. The only changes I made was using flour tortillas instead of corn and no olives. Note that this is not a spicy dish, but an easy recipe to add your own flair to.

This recipe was a good starting point.  I added green peppers because I didn't have any chopped chile peppers.  I also had leftover shrimp and scallops, so I made two batches, one with chicken and one with the seafood.  I put them in two casseroles.  I found they were a bit dry, and I like my enchiladas juicy, so I mixed one can of Campbell's mexican cooking soup with a cup of half and half and poured it over top, then sprinkled with cheese.  They turned out great!!!

Very good. Very fattening but hey let's live a little. I used Nestle Table Cream for the heavy cream. It might have been too heavy. I also used a Mexican White Cheese with just a bit of Cheddar on the top. Mine turned out more of a casserole because I dipped the corn tortillas in the salsa verde instead of oil. They fell apart but it was still delish! I used the whole can of broth instead of 1 1/2 cups. Thanks for sharing!

This is a family favorite.  I have also made it for guests and everyone loves it.  I use flour tortillas instead of corn, but I keep everything else the same. Words can't describe how good this dish is. You will have to try it!

Excellent! I use the canned, diced, fire-roasted green chiles (2 4-oz. cans). I've made these without the chicken, and with veg. broth instead of chicken broth, and they are great, too! And also half-n-half, not heavy cream.

Just say "heavenly"!!! These were fabulous enchiladas....I used flour tortillas (no frying) and poured a small can of evaporated milk instead of heavy cream over the top....then a can of rotel tomatoes (drained) instead of the green onions, olives and cherry tomatoes. I finished it off w/ extra cheese!!! All of my kids ate every bite and we can't wait to have them again - soon!!!

Very Good!!  I used flour tortillas because I don't care for corn tortillas.  I also added some tomatillos and lime juice to the green chile mixture.

My husband and I loved these. Enchildadas are one of our favorite dishes and these hit the spot! I did not fry the tortillas, just dipped them in the sauce (which I doubled). Next time I may skip that even and just mix the sauce with the chicken as another user suggested. I used the cream but I really think that just pouring the extra sauce over the enchiladas would do the trick. I can't see where it added additional texture or flavor. Thanks for the recipe, these will definitely be on our favorites list!

If my husband doesn't like a dish I make he won't eat it and if there's leftovers I might as well throw them out. But this dish he LOVED!!! He loved it so much  he ate it for breakfast the next morning and again the following day.

Awesome recipe!!  Definately double the sauce and kick up the spice factor.  Don't be afraid to add at least 8 "dashes" of cumin in a doubled sauce recipe.  This recipe is now a favoite in my house.

This recipe is a complete hit at my house.  My husband loves it so much he asks me to make an extra pan that he can take to work!!  I did slightly change the recipe though.  I increased the salsa verde, about doubled it.  And I double the cheese too.  Instead of dipping the tortillas in the verde sauce, I mixed most of it in with the chicken.  I reserve enough of the sauce to spread on top with the cheese, olives and green onion.  I have also made this with turkey too.

This recipe was okay, I slow cooked the chicken beforehand in chicken broth which made it really 'shreddable' but it was very bland by itself without further spices from the recipe.  Ran out of salsa verde..You definetly need to double the recipe for that and the corn tortillas after being pan-fried tasted somewhat sweet...not too good.  Probably wont make this again.

This has quickly become one of my favorite enchilada recipes. I omit the olives,skip frying the tortillas, and also I add a little more broth to the sauce. I have made these both with and without the cream.  Either way they are very tasty.  My family LOVES them and they are now part of the dinner rotation.  Thanks Lisa!

Excellent recipe.  I made 1.5 times what the recipe called for in sauce, which was a good idea.  Didn't dip the tortillas in the sauce, just spooned it inside each one and then covered it with the sauce.  Finally, I used an Anaheim and a Poblano chile, and blended the sauce after simmering, which worked really well.

Excellent recipe. Have made this many times. Tweaked it a little to suit my taste. I substituted scallions in place of the Spanish onions. I've found the Spanish onions a little on the strong side. I like using rotisserie chicken breast meat, nice and moist. My local super market sells the whole birds. I shred the meat, and season with Goya Sazon. Very tasty.

WOW! I am truly shocked at how excellent these turned out. Enchiladas Suizas is one of my favorite mexican dishes, and I often order it when I'm out to eat. I was so nervous about this recipe because it seemed too simple to be good. But it was better than many of the Enchiladas Suizas I've had at mexican restaurants, and easily as good as some of the best I've had. I wasn't sure what kind of peppers to use, so I got advice from a chef that happened to be there and used half Anaheim and half Poblano peppers. The verde sauce turned out excellent with that mixture. A couple of things that I did differently in preparing the enchiladas are this: Instead of dipping the tortillas in the verde sauce, I just put a spoonful on top of the chicken and cheese. Dipping the tortillas is really a messy and unnecessary step in my opinion. Also, I was nervous about just pouring the heavy cream on top of the enchiladas plain, so instead I mixed the cream with the remaining verde sauce after I was done making all the enchiladas. It turned out really great that way. It may have been perfectly fine the other way, too, I was just scared to try! The only thing that could make this recipe better is by serving sliced avocados with the enchiladas! Thank you SO MUCH for a recipe that will definitely become a staple for us.

YUM! It needed some enchilada sauce on top, which is why I'm missing a star - but with it on top, under the cheese - 5 stars!

these were fantastic..the only slight change i made was to spread some salsa verde into the bottom of the pan, instead of dipping each tortilla into the salsa.

I give this 5+ stars - EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe almost exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing... I didn't have heavy cream in the house at the time, so substituted it with Half-and-half - it was close enough! It tasted very authentic and delicious. I will DEFINITELY make this again (and again, and again..) and highly recommend it.

i gave it 4 stars because i thought the sauce was a bit runny - maybe that was because i used too much cream? i used turkey instead of chicken, and did not fry the tortillas. tasted great, and even better the next day when i ate the leftovers!

The whole family loved this!  I marinated my chicken with garlic, olive oil, taco seasoning mix, chili powder, garlic salt and powder, and lime juice.  Baked in cover pan at 350 for 30 min.  I added a little water in the pan.  Let it cool and shred it.  The sauce and chicken can be made a head of time so putting it together will be quicker.  My kids loved it.

Very yummy.  I used my food processor to shred the chicken as well as grate the cheese.  I also used light sour cream instead of the heavy cream to lighten it up a bit.

I was not sure what chopped green chile peppers to use - canned, fresh, or roasted, jalapenos, Hatch Valley, Pasillas... so I came up with my own concoction by roasting fresh serranos (5), Hatch Valley chilies (8), and Pasillas (5) until charred and enclosing them in a paper bag for 15 minutes, peeling and chopping them.  I then continue with the recipe and layer instead of roll the enchiladas (quicker for me) and skip the frying part(save a bit on fat).  I use vegetable broth for my vegetarian daughter and make seperate dishes, so she can enjoy them without the chicken.  We all love these.  People always ask for the recipe when I take them to potlucks.  Well worth the time it takes.

Absolutely delicious!  I order this dish in a local Mexican restaurant all the time, so I decided to try this recipe.  It is a pretty close match.  I used mild canned chiles so that our kids would be able to eat it.  They loved it with a dollup of sour cream.  My husband said it tasted very authentic.  It does require some work, but well worth it.  I can't wait to have leftovers tonight!

I thought this was ok.  I don't think the recipe yielded enough sauce and I think the chicken should perhaps be marinated before hand.  I liked the addition of the cream and I threw the cherry tomatoes in the oven with the enchiladas to bake them.  Overall good recipe, probably won't make again.

WOW!  These are excellent!  I was turned on to them by my brother.  They are a LOT of work, but well worth the wait.  We didn't dip the tortillas, but did fry them, and they were great.  Allow yourself about 2 hours for this recipe, especially if you've got a 17-month-old running around.  I don't know how else to say that these are GREAT!

This is an awesome recipe!Ifollowed JMACKIE's advice and added more to the sauce,also i simmered the sause longer than the recipe called for and it cooked down quite a bit,actually it was just enough and I only coated the inside of the tortillaand i added a little more cheese,also I bought a rottiserie chicken that was on sale at the supermarket and that made it that much easier,I would definitly give this more than 5 stars!

I was looking for something different and I found it!  This was fantastic!  I substituted canned chilis and microwaved my tortillas instead.  It turned out great!  I can't wait to try it with Steak next time.

YUM.  I used canned green chilies, regular onion, and this was just yummy.  I used more cheese though (but that's just because my hubby and I are cheese lovers). I also added one more can of chilies to the sauce, and added a few dashes of red pepper sauce. I didn't put the olives & tomatoes on it either - we just didn't think they would compliment the dish.  We will make it again.

This recipe didn't 'read' that well, but I tried it because of all the super reviews.  Well, they were right -- it was sooooo fine!!!  My thanks to you fellow cooks who steered me in the right direction, as well as to Lisa for a superb contribution.  I used flour tortillas, since that's what I had on hand.  Worked great.  The only other change I made was to cut back on the cream as some recommended.  Since it was the tiniest bit dry around the edges, think I'll go with the full amount next time.  All in all, a delicious dish!!!

These are delicious!!  And enchiladas are not my favorite!  I substituted pork (I had some left over) and beef broth (ditto) and everyone loved them- kids and grown-ups. Can't wait to try the original version.  Thanks!!

Our family of seven enjoyed this recipe VERY much!  There was no chance for leftovers - even with a double recipe!  We did use olive oil instead of Canola oil and we chopped jalapeno peppers instead of using green chiles.  We only made these substitutions because of what we had available.

I made this and it’s Amazing! I didn’t use the red or green Bell Peppers, but I did add a a large mild Jalapeños. I freeze these sometimes for a quick Dinner and it’s simply delicious! I highly recommend this dish! I’m a Texas Girl and I think that qualifies me to give this recipe an “ Authentic” Seal of Approval!

It took me a little longer than suggested.  But the results were great.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I improvised and combined some Greek yogurt with milk to thin it out and only used half the suggested amount since I wasn't sure what the outcome would be.  It was actually quite good.  I liked this recipe!

Even the kids approved!  I added mushrooms and jalapeños the parents and kept the kids ones simple.  My tip is make the salsa verde in a large pan big enough to dip the tortilla shells.

Killer recipe! The most time consuming & tedious for me was paying attention to the fry-time of the corn tortillas so they wouldn't burn and could still fold them.  I did each side of each tortilla for 1min. I seasoned my chicken tenders & boiled them for approx. 10 min, resulting in juicy meat easily shred once cooled.  EXCELLENT RECIPE. No complaints here.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe. He is definitely  not a leftover fan & vary rarely goes back for seconds but for these he had 3 total along with cabbage/Pico de Gallo & Cilantro Lime Rice. First I warmed my Tortillas in a skillet on med/high & used an oil spritzer which works great. I downsized to a serving size of 6. I only added 1 cup of broth rather than 1 1/2 that was called for, I also used leftover Pork instead of Chicken & to the Verda mix I sprinkled in some dry Fajita mix to taste.  Everything else stayed the same & between the two of us there was only 1 1/2 enchiladas left. Guess that will be my lunch for tomorrow. :-)

I put a hand full of pepper jack cheese in it to give an extra kick.
Definitely going to make this again!

Great dish.  I didn't have any green chilies so I roasted some hatch chilies. The sauce was really thick sine I added too much flour.  We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again

The family really liked it.  I forgot to fry the tortillas, but I guess they were soft enough to roll well.  Next time I will chop my onions much much smaller, and maybe puree the sauce.

Great recipe! Love the freshness of the green peppers, I used poblanos. Next time I will purée half the sauce to add a bit more consistency and creaminess to it. Definitely keeping this one, I’ve made 5 times so far!

Best enchiladas ever!  As other reviewers said, don't be afraid of the cream. It makes the dish.  We had left over rotisserie chicken and just added some taco seasoning.

I've longed looked for a good enchilada recipe, and usually disappointed.  This is authentic, restaurant quality.  Previous recipes I made are a soggy mess.  The difference with this recipe is lightly frying the corn tortillas - they bake up nicely and are not soggy.  Also the cream really adds to the sauce.  It is delicious.

Tasted great. I used light cream and heavy cream. Next time I think I will just use light cream. Skipped the olives and tomatoes for the top. Didn’t even need them.

I got 4 thumbs up from my family of 4 they absolutely loved this recipe. I used Trader Joe's corn and wheat tortillas which added a little sweet touch to it. This is staying in my recipe book.

I only made one change. After making the verde, I put the sauce in the blender to make it smooth. Turned out perfect. I will be making it again.

My kids stopped eating several times just to tell me how good it was! Then went back for seconds! So delicious. A little time consuming and it helped that I got everything set out and ready, but it wasn't overly complicated. Made it right off the recipe and didn't need to change a thing, it was just so so good!

I have made this twice now.  It came out very well both times. I saved some calories by warming the tortillas in the microwave to make them pliable  and easy to fill and roll.
 this saved time, calories and mess. also, I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used less. my family loves it and I'll make it again and again.

Of all the Swiss Enchiladas I have prepared over the last 50 years or so this is by far one of my favorites, there is something about frying the tortillas lightly that makes them taste extra good, I sprinkle a small amount of Parmesan cheese on the inside of the tortilla, a trick a Mexican food truck vendor told me about years ago  in California and it's the only addition I made.

This recipe was delicious.  I did purchase the salsa verde  from the refrigerated section at the grocery store.  Since there are only two of us, I made three 8x8 pans.  One for dinner that night, one for the freezer and one went to a friend to enjoy.  My husband loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I used pork,and flour tortillas those were the only changes I made just because if preferred taste.
Before serving I put a dallop of sour cream on top of each enchilada with tomatoes and black olives.
This was a big success!!

Super easy, and very tasty.  I used ground turkey meat because I had some in the freezer, and 1/2 and 1/2 because I needed to use it up.  I also seasoned the meat a bit with onion and garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper, a little oregano.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  This one's definitely a keeper!

AMAZING! what I did to make this so much easier..
first I did not roll the shells, I layered them like a casserole. I boiled the chicken and used the broth adding chicken bullion. Pre packaged mexican cheese. 2 small cans of diced chilis (this added so much great flavor). I did not dip the first batch of shells  in the sauce .
I made sauce,  poured some down in the empty dish and smoothed it around, fried tortillas slightly and I honestly think this is a must even thought it is a huge process(fried tortillas have a different taste and consistency). Then I layered the first shells ,  and flipped the first shells around in the sauce that was already in the dish, meat, cheese, fry next batch, dip is sauce, layer on top, rest of the sauce plus heavy cream, then  1/2 of second pack of cheese on on top , green onion and bake 20 min. = restaurant style enchiladas to die for.
***Also the reason I even tried this recipe was because I was tired of throwing away tortilla shells that were broken in the package. So this is an excellent recipe for people like me who always have a lot of broken shells and can't use them for tacos, save'em and make this meal.

These were just okay. They were super mild and did not have a lot of flavor. I added more cumin, salt, and chili powder but it didn’t make a difference. If I were to make it again, I’d make sure my green chiles were spicier or just use a premade sauce.

Really good. I used Greek yogurt instead of cream because I didn't have cream, but I had yogurt. This is my first attempt at making enchiladas and my wife said "Lets have this again", so that's why this rates 5 stars.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe, because I never do, but I got raves from my guests.  No major changes except that I didn't cover with cream.  I used blanched, seeded jalapenos in the sauce.  I thought it would be too spicy, but it wasn't.  The leftovers were a bit soggy reheated the next day.

followed the recipe and result was good but a little bland.  a little chilula sauce made a world of difference. it may be due to using canned chilies?as my local grocery store didn’t have any fresh ones. i may also use pepperjack cheese instead of montery jack for some kick and also add some type of seasoning to the meat (i used chicken) after its been shredded.  it’s a solid recipe and one i’ll make again.

I made this tonight for dinner; my kids loved it! They are very similar to the way my family makes green enchiladas, but I've never added cream like that before-it was delicious! Unfortunately I was short on time so I used a can of salsa verde enchilada sauce, next time I'll make per the recipe. everything else was made as directed, I'll be making these again!

I love this dish. I've cooked it several times in the past few weeks. Always good. Easy to adjust for personal taste. I leave out the garlic and don't bother frying the tortillas. I also occasionally add extra peppers or rice.

This was a great recipe! I used 3/4 cup salsa verde vs. 1 cup green chiles to keep the heat down some for kids. No other changes and it was not a soggy mess at all. Frying the tortillas was a little work, but worth it! I would make this again no question!

I tried making this recipe but traditional salsa verde is made with tomatillos and only a couple of Serrano chiles not with green chiles alone. And my tia taught me to steam the corn tortillas for enchiladas just a bit so that they are pliable for rolling. I didn’t want the extra grease so I did not put them in hot oil at all. I’m going back to my tia’s recipe for these enchiladas.

I made it more or less as described, but found a way to assemble it more easily. I fried the corn tortillas but did not dip them in the salsa. I found that awkward the first time I made them. I poured some salsa into the bottom of the casserole dish, and put a spoonful of salsa on each tortilla before adding the chicken and cheese. They were much easier to handle being dry on the outside and pouring the salsa over them in the casserole got the outside of each enchilada. My girlfriend and I loved it and will make it again for sure.

Excellent creamy and cheesy eating!  I used previously roasted and frozen hatch green chilies, which were delicious but a pain to peel, which significantly increased the prep time. I also used flour tortillas because that was what I had on hand. I found them to be a bit too doughy and dense when cooked, so I would definitely use corn tortillas in the future. Still, a delicious recipe that I will be using again soon!

Really loved this yummy recipe. Even picky teenager gave a thumbs up. Made simpler by using roasted chicken & bottled salsa verde. Used flour tortilla and increased amounts of salsa & cheese. Will definitely put this recipe in the line up.

I wish there was a greater sauce-to-enchilada ratio, but that could be just something I did differently (like stuffed too many enchiladas and didn't increase the amount of sauce I made). The flavors were spot on! Just like restaurant style! I paired this with Mexican rice  II from Allrecipies and some shredded iceberg lettuce salad with homemade pico de gallo.  Best cinco de mayo feast ever!

Followed directions exactly. Made only one serving at a time. Absolutely delicious, cheesy and smooth. Next time I will make salsa verde spicier and use cornstarch instead of flour to make gluten free.  To reduce calories further, I will use low fat cream/milk to reduce calories. I will definitely make again and pass on the recipe.

The Sauce was flavorful and fragrant. Easy to make...I used fresh Fire Roasted Anaheim Chilies instead of canned ones. I Used a blend of Cheddar, Jack, Asadero, and Manchego Cheeses.

This recipe was surprisingly good! I thank previous reviewers for their substitution suggestions.  I followed the recipe except for changes as stated by some other reviewers: I didn’t fry my tortillas, I also used flour tortillas only because it was what I had on hand. I also substituted heavy cream for half and half. In the preparation, I didn’t dip the tortilla in the salsa verde. Rather, I put some of the salsa on the bottom of the baking dish, also on the bottom of the tortilla before I placed the chicken and cheese mixture, and then brushed some on top of the tortilla after it was placed in the  baking dish. This was a fabulous recipe! I will definitely make it again.

My husband told me this is the best thing I've ever made!  I also used a precooked rotisserie chicken which helped a lot as this recipe takes some time (but it's so worth it). I used flour tortillas (don't like corn) and fried them on a flat pan without oil, flipping constantly to get them a little crispy. I HIGHLY recommend the step of dipping the tortillas in the chili verde, but be ready to get messy! I poured just a little half and half over the enchiladas before baking and the enchiladas were incredibly creamy. Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this!

I made this recipe tonight with Quorn vegetarian chicken substitute rather than real chicken.  Unfortunately, I misread the ingredients and only had 4 oz. green chiles instead of a full cup.  But the recipe still came out so delicious! My picky kids even enjoyed it! I will definitely be making this again.

Every time I make this, it gets rave reviews and I've passed the recipe along to at least a dozen people. For ease, I use left over taco chicken I've made in the crockpot, but it's the only thing I do differently. Don't skip the heavy cream - it really makes a difference.

The family loved it.  I tried to make it exactly like the recipe called.  I had roasted chicken from Costco which made it easy.  When I had everything assembled, I went to grab the cream from the refrigerator and it was spoiled.  To late and to far to go for fresh cream.  I grabbed some sour cream and milk and make it the consistency of cream and poured it over the top, sprinkled on a little more cheese, and sprinkled a little chili powder on top of the sour cream.  It was delicious.  The family wants me to make it again.  Now I am in a quandary, do I make it like the original or stick with the sour cream.  I think I will use the cream and then we can decide which is better.

I made this last Saturday and we are still eating eat. I made a double batch. I used regular size flour tortillas and I warmed them in the microwave as to not cook them in oil...I’m sure it’s very good in oil but I don’t have time for all that cooking! I dipped both sides of the tortilla in the sauce and I’m glad I did because there’s so much flavor in the sauce. I followed the recipes and I also added some store bought medium salsa from Aldi for a little Kick. I highly suggest soaking the chicken breast in salt water over night and boiling it in the same water. After the chicken cools..them hand-shred the chicken (this took me about an hour cuz I used 4 large breasts). Awesome recipe!

This dish has become a family favorite!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.  My eldest son is away at college this year and he has demanded that this dish was made when he came home for the holidays.

This was a big hit with my wife and I! Just follow the recipe, and it turns out incredible! One thing to note: lightly fry the tortillas! Otherwise, they will be very difficult to fold.

Cheesy, creamy and delicious.  Probably not the healthiest recipe, but overall a hit in our small family.  I bought a rotiseree chicken from Costco and used it to make this dish and then a Chicken and Dumplings dish the next night, which made it a little easier.  I also removed the vegetables and anything jalapeno to better suit our tastes, and didn't lose any of the core recipe.  Buying a package of "Mexican Cheese" at the supermarket also saved me from having to buy and mix multiple cheeses to taste.

This is a great recipe - I've made it a couple of times now.  My variations are to add 6-7 parboiled then  gently processed tomatillos (makes about 2 cups), along with chopped cilantro to the sauce and an extra tbsp of flour for thickening.  I also use serrano peppers (2) as well, but I remove the seeds and oven roast them first.  My family does not do green olives, so I skip those.  I serve with with cilantro lime/lemon (whichever I have at the time) rice.  This one is becoming a family favorite  :)

These were very good!  I added fresh roasted poblano chilies (cut into strips)  to the insides with the chicken and cheese.  I did not add the cream on top but next time maybe i'll add a little to the green sauce.  I did not think it made a difference without it.

It was really yummy.  I wished it had more green chili flavor and more spice. It was better after I added a bunch of Trader Joe's Dragon Sauce on top.  Will make again.  My picky 6 and 4 year-olds didn't like it, but my 2-year-old did.

DELICIOUS!! First time I made this as-is (minus the salt, personal preference), but I didn't read the directions closely & mixed the whipping cream into the verde sauce. I used mild, canned green chiles. Even my 2 yr old had 2nd servings. Second time I made it, I put the chicken & all sauce ingredients except for the whipping cream into the crockpot. When I came home from work I added the cream to all the stuff in the crockpot, then made a casserole dish with corn tortilla chips out of it. Layered meat & sauce, cheese, chips, repeat. Baked. DELICIOUS!! I am also not a big fan of green chiles & was worried the flavor would be overpowering--it was not. It is very nicely balanced with the broth & cream & cheese.

OMG! To die for. I will admit, I did make a few changes. I did not fry the corn tortillas, I warmed them in the microwave as someone suggested, they rolled easily without the added fat. Also, when my verde sauce was simmering, I added about 2 tablespoons of low-fat half and half. I then omitted adding the heavy cream at the end. The flavor was amazing. I will say, the insides of my enchiladas may have been a bit dryer as a result, next time I will make more of the verde sauce and reserve some for topping when served. Lastly, I put my chicken in a slow cooker, added diced onion, salt, pepper, cumin, a dash of olive oil and about 1/4 c chicken broth, I let it cook about 4 hours. The chicken was full of flavor. I think if I just grilled the chicken or baked it, it would not have the same depth of flavor in the enchilada. Will totally make again and dream of it until I do!

I used  only half a cup of green chili's and also added a half cup of fresh banana peppers and jalapenos from the garden.  The sauce was amazing.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  My husband loves authentic Mexican food and he gave this a 10.  It is REALLY good.

I sometimes "cheat" and use store bought green enchilada sauce and just add the cream.  I never get anything but rave reviews.

I made my own tortillas and used canned fire roasted peppers (mild, so my daughter couldn't complain about spice!).  I used an immersion blender on the sauce (again, so my daughter couldn't complain about onions or peppers).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely a keeper.  And my daughter liked them too (phew!).

I thought this recipe didn't have much flavor. Next time I will follow the advice of another reviewer and add a can of enchilada sauce to the heavy cream to give it that little extra flavor.

I cheated - & changed slightly.  I subbed mozzarella for jack, added half cup cream of chicken soup & half cup Herdez salsa verde to the filling.  'Sprinkled some blackening seasoning on the chicken.  I mixed everything together.   I didn't make the salsa verde at all.  I dipped the microwave-warmed corn tortillas in it & poured the rest of the jar on top; half cup half & half then more cheese with the green onions.  Oiled & baked for 35 to 40.  'Could/should be a bit spicy, but that's an easy fix.

Very tasty! To save time, I used rotisserie chicken from the store as well as store bought salsa verde. Also used uncooked flour tortillas and heated on stove without any oil. Topped with lettuce and diced tomato. Will definitely make again!

I made this and another dish of enchiladas with red sauce and this won, hands down. I ended up making half chicken and half beef.  I did take one user's suggestion and used shredded rotisserie chicken to save time. I seasoned the chicken and beef with some chili powder, cumin, s&p, and hot sauce to add flavor.  I also only dipped one side of the tortillas and didn't fry them-- simply heated them prior to their dip. My husband and friends absolutely loved these!!  They were even good for leftovers the next day.

Excellent and easy. I used four flour tortillas and store-bought salsa because I had a lot on hand.  I added the salsa, some sour cream and green onions to the chicken. The cooking time I used was 15 min and then added more shredded cheese and scallions and back into the oven for 7 min. This will definitely be made again! NOTE: After having some, I realize the chicken became too 'creamed', almost like the consistency of tuna salad. I would prefer more chunks of chicken, so next time, I'll have to remember not to mix so much that it becomes like a creamed texture. UPDATE 7/23/18: This time I made the salsa verde, and it was excellent. I scaled this down to five servings, although I only used four flour tortillas, filling each with substantially more than specified. I used a small can of green chilies and added a few shakes of cayenne pepper. I just microwaved each tortilla for 10 seconds  and then spooned a few tblsp of the salsa verde over each before layering chicken chunks and cheeses.  The same bake times I used previously worked great. I have leftover salsa verde; may make a soup or find some use. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to double the salsa verde amount. I would definitely encourage you to double the salsa verde. Make the rest of the recipe EXACTLY as it says.

I used jarred salsa verde, and I don't put cheese on top of enchiladas, only in them (personal preference). I didn't have a lot of time (or ingredients), but I did have some slow-cooked chicken I needed to use. I am giving the 5 stars because I did everything else the same, and this was amazing!!

These were very good! My son said, "these don't taste like they normally do, they taste better!" (The "normal" recipe I use is NOT this one). We skipped the green olives, but topped them with some fresh chopped cilantro and served with sour cream on the side.

I changed this up a bit, making it more like Chilaquiles, layering the tortillas rather than rolling enchiladas.  Next time i will double the sauce as it was very very minimal and needed much more. Other than that, it's a good recipe.

I used the slow cooker pork carnitas recipe from this website and it was fantastic! I used flour tortillas, sprayed one side with Pam, heated them in a pan sprayed with Pam and they were great, not soggy at all. Will definitely make again!!

Really delicious recipe.  Only change I made was using a 7 oz can of green chilies in addition to a small diced jalapeno.  Also used closer to 3 cups of chicken and a tsp of cumin and some chili powder.  Will make this again and again.
This time fried flour tortillas using cooking spray.  Next time think I will use corn tortillas, as per recipe.  The flour tortillas were just too heavy with the cream.  I might also try half cream, half sour cream.  Maybe a little lime also.

This recipe was amazing! I have never been a fan of canned enchilada sauce and so I was excited to try this but simply delighted with the flavor! There were no leftovers, my family devoured it! I made it just as the recipe stated. For the shredded chicken I boiled 3 chicken breasts in water to cover and added 1 quartered onion, 1 stalk celery chopped, 1 carrot chopped, 3 cloves garlic crushed, salt and peppercorns and boiled for 20 minutes, then cooled and strained. I shredded the chicken and reserved the broth to use in the recipe in place of the chicken broth. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I couldn't find corn tortillas big enough, so I cooked raw Tortilla Land flour tortillas and let cool on a wire rack (to avoid them from steaming on a plate).  I also couldn't find fresh green chiles, so I used canned chiles and a few chopped fresh Serrano peppers (seeds removed to reduce spiciness).  We really liked it!  My husband said it would be bland without the serranos.  Also, I used half and half.  The tortilla didn't get soggy.  And who knew olives on enchiladas would be so amazing!  I think they made all the difference between being good and delicious.

Both my husband and I loved this recipe. For some reason, I have about 6 chicken enchilada recipes and I keep making new ones.  I did make a few changes, just for palate reasons and to cut down fat just a smidge. I only used one can of chiles rather than one cup. Additionally, I didn't fry the tortillas, I just warmed them in the oven. I also omitted the green olives and tomatoes on the top because I didn't think they were necessary.

I don't usually review recipes but this one deserves a standing ovation. I made it as directed, substituting plain canned moose stew meat (seasoned like a previous reviewer suggested w/cumin& chili powder, garlic, &~1/4 c bbq sauce), mozzarella for the jack cheese, and canned evaporated milk instead of the cream. It was delicious right out of the pan! My picky children& husband-who-can't-eat-without-sriracha/tabasco all ate it voluntarily& gave many compliments. I think frying the corn tortillas really improves the flavor& texture. Will be making this again soon! Thanks.

Everyone in my house loved these and I've never said that about any recipe!  The salsa verde was amazing and I will be making this recipe regularly.  You can also use ground meat in the filling if desired, and lowfat 1/2 and 1/2 worked fine instead of the heavy cream (although I'm sure the heavy cream was even yummier!)  Extra note:  I tried to use store bought salsa verde one time and it wasn't the same at all.  USE THE RECIPE - it makes the best salsa verde I've ever eaten. I always double or even triple the salsa verde ingredients because it's so yummy.

So so good.  Restaurant quality for sure.  I took other reviewers' advice on upping the cumin, doubling the sauce, adding some garlic powder, frying tortillas in cooking spray, adding some sauce to the bottom of the pan, adding some sauce in with the shredded chicken before rolling the enchiladas, more cheese and mixing the cream with the remaining sauce before pouring it over top.  All good recommendations.  Would the recipe be a 5 star without these recommendations...probably but thank you everyone for your input because it was delicious!! My only change this time was to add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce to make it thicker.   Next time I will not be hesitant to fry the tortillas a tad longer and I will try using half and half instead of cream.  So happy to have found this recipe.

This was soooo good! I deboned a rotisserie chicken, used a little more garlic than what the recipe calls for, and didn't use green olives. My husband and I loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Wow the best enchiladas I have ever eaten.  My kids even said this is their new favorite dish.  Tastes very authentic.  It is a bit of work but totally worth it.  We used unseasoned ground beef instead of chicken, just because we had it on hand.  I am sure just about any meat would be great.  I did put the verde sauce in my bullet to process a little.  Other then that we make as instructed.

Excellent. I add cilantro to the green sauce and also on the top along with the green onions. And I use about 5 cloves of garlic instead of one.

We made this using ground beef AND chicken.  I didn't think the ground beef would be very good with the sauce....but it was our family's favorite!  To make it less messy, I didn't dip the fried tortillas in the sauce but just spooned some inside and poured the remaining on top.  Delish!

This is the perfect recipe to use up some of that leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Very easy to make, a little messy when rolling the tortillas, but that is the fun part. My wife who hates anything green and onions loved it...Score!

Fantastic recipe!! I altered it a tad...I threw in the chicken in the verde sauce...and did 1/2 cup of cream with a can of mild enchilada red sauce.  Fantastic recipe!!

This is a big hit with my family. You can use different types of tortillas: spinach, whole wheat, etc. I like to use meat left over from another meal and reinvent it in a recipe like this one, but not spend all night making it. This is that recipe!

Excellent! I followed the recipe as written using pulled pork, except I didn't add the cream. It was easy, the salsa verde was perfect for my son who liked spicy but not too hot. To me, it was perfect. Thanks for this perfect enchilada recipe. Will definately make again using chicken.

Delicious recipe the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the time. Base on the reviews I doubled the sauce expecting it to yield 8 smothered enchiladas, instead I ended up with double the smothered enchiladas which was fine because they are so yummy they wont last long. I slow roasted and pulled a pork loin a couple days before and kept it in the fridge until I was ready to make this. I did fry my tortillas and I dipped both sides in sauce. The only down side it the time...it took me almost an hour and a half for prep and 20 minutes to cook. I did all of my chopping and grating with a food processor. I will mention this was my first time hand rolling enchiladas, my mexican grandmother always taught me to make enchilada casserole because it is quicker, since she was a mother of 8 kids I can see where she is coming from! If you have the time this recipe is great!

Plus 5 more if my DH has anything to say about it.  He was, seriously, almost licking his plate.  This is such a simple dinner.  I did cheat and used a store bought grilled chicken.  The sauce was out of this world good.  DH likes to go for mexican at least once a week and said this was the best EVER!  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

OMG these are the best enchiladas! Sadly none were left for seconds. I did feel it took a while and will look for shortcuts, but as is this is an amazing recipe. Could use a bit more spice.

This is quickly becoming a family favorite! I simply put a spoonful of sauce on the tortilla, then filling and wrap. Once they are all in the pan, I pour the extra sauce and eye ball the amount of cream. Great recipe!

The best enchiladas I've ever made!!  The verde sauce was amazing and very easy to make.  I did "fry" the tortillas based on reviews that said that is the key to great enchiladas although I may try the microwave trick next time.  The flavor was amazing and I will be making these again!

Our family raves about this recipe.  I couldn't find green chili's in a can so I used 1/2 lb of jalapenos and 1/2 lb serrano peppers (de-seeded)and used a food processor to dice them.* I also couldn't find shredded Monterey Jack cheese so I shredded a block myself and added a bit of flour to keep it from clumping when combining with the shredded cheddar.
*If cutting fresh hot peppers chokes you and burns your hands (maybe it's just me!) use kitchen gloves and a dust mask when cutting/dicing and seeding (works like a charm).

Absolutely delicious!!  I did take the recommendation to cook the chicken in the slow cooker with the verde salsa.  It cooked for a good 4 hours on high and 2 on low and was really easy to shred...I also didn't fry the tortillas, just dipped them in the hot verde salsa from the slow cooker...I also only used 1/2 of the heavy whipping cream.  Again delicious and I will be making this my go to dish for company!! :-)

Wonderful.  Made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but next time I will try canned chicken (as I have found it to be great in enchiladas).  Made it with flour tortillas, and just cheddar cheese.  I'm sure the different cheeses would only make it better.  Fabulous sauce, and the cherry tomatoes make it (granted I did use fresh from my garden)....

Fantastic sauce! Easy easy peasy to make! Made a short cut by buying 2 lbs ready made pork carnitas, shredded and cooked in sauce. Didn't bother rolling, layered the tortilla, sauce, meat & cheese. Baked as usual & turned out amazing! Thank you for the recipe!

I am Hispanic and just want to say that this is a spectacular recipe. Thank you for submitting it, Ladygwyn. I made mine using what I had on hand, i.e. ground turkey instead of chicken, as well as Crema Mexicana instead of cream. This will become a new family favorite!

This is fabulous!  It is a little time consuming but oh so worth it! No more enchiladas with red sauce for my family - this is the only enchilada recipe I'll use from now on. Hubby loved it! Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! Served with Mexican Rice II from this site. It was a perfect meal!

This was amazing good!  Who knew it could be so easy to make your own salsa verde?!  I didn't have any fresh green chile peppers but used 2 small cans of them and added half a green pepper minced fine.  I used a rotisserie chicken and loved the ease of it.  I totally forgot about the olives and tomatoes at the end but they were not missed in the slightest.  Yummy Hispanic comfort food!  Loved it and will make again repeatedly.

I love these!  I add more green onion and omit the green olives.  If my kids aren't eating with us that night I add more green chiles as well.  We also get a box of the Spanish rice to have as a side dish.  SOOO good, I love how the cream cooks to the enchiladas.  For how long (I don't usually cook with recipes) this recipe looked to me it was very EASY and quick, I use this a lot:)

This was delicious. It took a bit of work and the white sauce softened the pan of enchiladas into more of a casserole: I couldn't find where the rolled enchiladas were to scoop them out intact. But being one of the tastiest (Cinco De Mayo) recipes that night, presentation was easily excused. Next time, I want to bake two enchiladas in individual dishes each, so scooping the mass from the pan isn't an issue. It's a very very tasty recipe, as written.

This was a lovely and simple recipe, and so easily adaptable!  I used a bottled green salsa (I recommend either Trader's Joes store-brand, or Herdez Salsa verde) which saved a lot of time.  The prep went much faster than I expected and it turned our really nicely.  Dipping the tortilla's in the salsa added so much nice flavor too.  Just make sure to get plenty of cheese in case you have enough chicken for two dishes worth like I did.  Of course, I made mine fairly small.  Still, a lovely dish and makes even better left-overs!

WOW! What can I say? Oh so good. The Verde sauce was fantastic!I could have sat there and ate it all with a spoon. I cheated and picked up a rotisserie chicken from the Grocery store. A must make again many more times.

These are the best enchiladas I have ever eaten!  I like spice, so I made one small change.  I replaced the diced peppers with a small can diced habanero peppers.

I cooked it without the cream because I didn't have any. It was delicious without it! If you want to save yourself some calories and fat, I recommend trying it that way. Be sure to shred the chicken well or it won't last through all 12 tortillas. I only got 8 out of it and I think that is the reason. Good recipe!

This recipes was delicious.  Made it with Pork and Chicken. As enchiladas or as a casarole.  Before applying the heavy cream boil it was a small tablespoon of chicken bouillion (powder form) and then top.  Used a variety of cheeses to our like and it was still fantastic. Thanks for sharing!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Don't change a thing.  If you write a review and change every aspect of the recipe, then you in fact made something completely different and shouldn't be reviewing the recipe in the first place.

Very good!  I used our fire roasted green chilis (I buy a bushel each summer and freeze them) so it was very spicy.  I was a little afraid to over cook the shells, so some of them were not done... Next time I will cook them longer.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

OMG! This recipe was DELICIOUS!! The salsa verde blew me away. Fiesta for the taste buds! My husband couldn't resist grabbing seconds! The only changes I made was cooking the chicken in low-sodium chicken broth then shredded;reduced the cream, butter, salt and swapped out the canola oil for olive oil. Oh! You could never add to much cumin! Mmm... mmm...The leftovers are just as good! :D Saving this in my recipe book!

I was excited to make this for a large dinner party.  I followed the recipe closely, except for using canned green chiles.  In the end, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor.  It was nothing to write home about. I'll keep looking.

This was easy and very yummy.  It was my first time making it so it took me one house to set it up and put in the oven.  I used flour tortillas and fried them a bit with canola oil instead of corn. I used cilantro instead of the chile peppers since we dont really like them. I fried all of the herbs with the onion including the green onion. I used mozarella and cheddar mix. I made the changes just because it was what I had and some for preference. The result was really good. Everyone liked it so I will make again. THank you for sharing.

Great recipe. Made a few minor changes... Used two 4oz cans of diced fire roasted chiles, drained a little, in place of fresh. And substituted fat free half and half for heavy cream. Next time I might add some cilantro and other spices. Yum!

Yum!  This was very good.  I was concerned that it wouldn't turn out, but it totally did.  I used 2 cans of chopped green chilis and 2 cups of chicken broth for the sauce.  DP said he would have liked a little more spice, but we wanted the 1-year old to be able to eat this as well.  Otherwise, we could have added some hotter chilis.  I will probably increase green sauce by 1/2 next time, so there would be some extra for serving at the table.  After reading other reviews, I opted not to fry the tortillas in oil.  I did dip them in simmering heavy cream, and they did not fall apart at all.  I saved a step and calories!  I also don't think it's necessary to add the onions, tomatoes or olives at the end.  I don't think I will next time.  We enjoyed this one!

This was my first successful enchilada recipe after many failed attempts with other recipes! The sauce alone is worth making this recipe for! (I did cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp and it was salty enough for our tastes) Other than that I followed the recipe exactly except the first few tortillas I did not dip and then I changed my mind and decided to go with the recipe. The dipped tortillas were much much better. I also put a little of the salsa in each enchilada. I was worried about all the cream so I only used 3/4 cup but there was no problem with there being too much liquid and I'm sure the whole amount would have been just fine! These were perfect! I will definately be making them again and this recipe changed my husbands mind about enchiladas! Thank you for the great recipe!!

Not much to say other than these were AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD ALL MAKE THEM! I was worried about the sauce and thought I wasnt going to like it, but oh man the cream just made these go from good to absolutely perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, although I don't really see why you have to fry the tortillas, I think just microwaving them would save time, dishes, calories, and give you basically the same product. I also didn't use tomatoes, but Im sure that would have been a great addition. Mine took longer than specified to cook, but it was well worth it. My boyfriend ate 3(he's a small guy too) and then ate the leftovers for lunch the next day! Absolutely recommend these to everyone if you're willing to put in some effort for them!

Nice flavor, but found it to be quite mushy. I could not find the corn tortilla shells so used the flour ones, maybe that made the difference.

This recipe is delicious!  I followed the advice of some others and microwaved the corn tortillas to save calories and time and was not disappointed.  I also sprinkled a little fresh cilantro inside of the enchiladas as I was assembling them.  I would give this recipe more stars if I could!!!

I will be making this again! I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and mixed some canned green enchillada sauce in the chicken mixture. Also, I didnt dip the tortillas in the salsa verde, I just poured all of it over the top- saves a little time and a mess!

Extremely good! well worth the 45 minute prep time!  I like spice but there are others in my family that cannot.  This was a decent compromise (I cut the chiles in half - 1/2 cup).  You will like this. :)

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and I’m glad I did! It came out fabulous; I wouldn’t change a thing about it. I served it with the extra salsa verde, some salsa, sour cream, and shredded lettuce on the side, which added some nice pops of color. The enchiladas have a really great flavour and texture, and are very filling. 

I will *definitely* be making this again. Highly recommended!

This is amazing! From a true New Mexican, this is better than most of the well known restaurants in town!!! My hispanic husband said they were better than he has ever had. Next time I will cut the onions in half, a little too much for my liking.

We really enjoyed this recipe, although it is a bit of work.  I did not fry the tortillas (I don't like fried foods), but I did microwave the tortillas for at least 2 minutes (I doubled the recipe).  I also used poblano peppers (which I plan on roasting first next time).  Over all they were a hit and our guests asked if they could take home left overs.  They taseted authentic.  We had kids, so the spice was just enough for the kids, but I would add some jalapeno or serrano pepper if only adults (that like spice) are at the meal.

This recipe has now replaced my sister in laws recipe I had for enchiladas - it is SO good. Although I wouldn't really call them "zesty" (maybe that's because I used two cans of mild diced green chilies) they are full of flavor and taste like yummy enchiladas from Mexican restaurants.  Frying the corn tortillas kept them crunchy and prevented sogginess. Also, I only dipped the inside of the tortillas in the sauce and poured some in the bottom of the pan, then over them as the recipe calls for.  Like another reviewer said, don't be afraid of pouring the cream over them, it turns out awesome.  A little time consuming the first go, but well worth it.  YUM!

This turned out really great! Everyone loved it. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I used half & half and made a double batch so there would be leftovers for tomorrow! I made three baking dishes full and two got eaten by four people, I was glad I made extra or they would have been clamoring for more!

These were amazing. I just warmed up the tortillas in the Microwave to avoid extra calories. Then, when all was said and done I realized I forgot to add the heavy cream before putting into the oven. They still came out absolutely delicious! Next time I make them I will try adding the cream, but I think overall I would like to skip that part just to lower the calories. Great sauce! We topped ours with sour cream, green onions and the green olives as well. The Olives were a little over powering so I only used a few. Thanks alot for this great recipe!

Great recipe! First one I have found that both hubby and I can agree on.  I made it exactly as written except I seasoned the chicken with some groung cumin and garlic salt when cooking in the skillet.

Everything came together on this one and they were THE BEST chicken enchiladas I've ever made.  Seriously, chicken enchiladas should not have canned soup or cream cheese in them so thanks for posting exactly what I've been looking for!  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot seasoned with garlic, cumin & salt.  On step 3, I mixed the cream in with the extra salsa verde instead of pouring the cream over the top.  DELICIOUS!

This is a similar recipe to one that I have made for my family for over 20 years and it's a real family favorite! The only difference in the recipe is that mine calls for stewing the chicken; I always pressure cooked it instead so that I could use the leftover broth as part of the sauce broth. This makes it much more flavorful and it takes much less time to cook. I also sometimes add cooked pork(roast or steak) for a more hearty dish. My family never gets tired of this dish!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed other reviews and used flour tortillas instead of corn and I made sure that I made plenty of sauce. I plan to make it again and again, my son who is a picky eater, ate  some without picking anything off. Thank you for this recipe.

I've been making this one for a loooong time now. There's not much I do to adjust, only difference is that I mix the chicken and cheese together with about 1/2 cup chopped onion in a bowl prior to puttting it in the tortillas. Also, suuuuuuper messy, but awesome! :)

Okay, I don't know what version of this recipe I printed, but it obviously wasn't the same as the one that got 5 stars. My husband gave it a "no" on the "ever make a again" question. It was okay, but had a strange aftertaste to it. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using only 1 2oz can of chilies (all I had) and adding cilantro and chile powder to the chicken.  Sorry! Won't make again! Probably won't even eat the leftovers!

This meal was very good.  I have never had enchiladas like that before and WOW!!  What an excellent was to cook them.  I have cooked both ways with Heavy Cream and Evaporated Milk and they turn out the same!!  Make sure you do top with tomatoes, olives and green onions because that is what makes the meal great!!

"Enchiladas Suizas are one of my FAVorite dishes! I made these for a dinner party and they were deeeeelish!

These enchiladas were wonderful!  Frying the corn tortillas gives them an authentic mexican taste. I will try using just a small amount of oil next time though as someone suggested. I made half the amount of enchiladas (6) and used all of the sauce.  It still made a whole pan full. I also put some chopped cilantro inside the enchiladas because I love cilantro. I was worried about the cream, but not to worry, it turns out delicious!  Very good! Next time I will try to put some chile powder in the sauce for more kick! Thanks, Lisa!

This was awesome! My bunco group loved it! I did use store bought salsa verde, which was quite hot, but everyone asked for the recipe. A little time consuming, but totally worth the extra effort!

I thought it was great; hubby thought it was good; but, kids would only eat the chicken and cheese on the inside. It was very messy to make but that could also be the result of my inexperience working with tortillas.

I made these a week ago.  I grilled seasoned chicken breast on George Foreman grill.  Allowed to cool then cut in thin strips.  Used aneheim chili's from last summer garden (frozen/thawed).  Subbed half/half for heavy cream b/c that what I had on hand. I added the half and half to the salsa verde. Also used garlic jack cheese for the cheese listed.  Served with sliced green olives on the side.  I skipped the frying in oil and dipping in sauce part.  Put a little sauce in pan.  Rolled enchiladas placing in sauce causing the enchiladas to crack.  This was a good recipe all in all.  It lacked spice but that could be added.  Will make again.

These were pretty good!  If you were seriously pressed for time, you could purchase ready made salsa verde and precooked chicken.  This would cut down on your prep quite a bit.

This is a wonderful dish. Like others, I thought dipping the tortillas in salsa was a bit too messy, so I spooned some in each enchilada. The salsa was fast and easy. I would double the salsa next time. I used one banana pepper and one poblano pepper. Also, the produce store had no cherry tomatoes this day, so I diced some plum tomatoes. Pimento stuffed olives add a bit of color, too. This recipe has a permanent place in my files now!

This was good but not spicy enough to suit our tastes.  I didn't fry the tortillas (to reduce the fat) and they turned to mush.  Don't know if that's because I didn't fry them or just the kind of tortillas I had but that was kind of nasty.  May try again with some adjustments.

This was pretty darn good!!  I only changed a few things.  I marinated my chicken but I didn't care for the marinade I used (too much lime flavor) so I will try something different next time.  (I was the only one to notice this as it was subtle - family gobbled it up.)  I doubled the sauce and for my chiles, I seeded and diced 2 poblanos, 1 anahime and 1 jalepeno.  We like things a little spicy so I used shredded pepper jack cheese.  After I dipped and rolled each enchilada I stirred in half and half with the green sauce to taste.  Maybe 1 cup......probably a little less.  It was yummy!!!!!  Served with some kicked up black beans and whata ya know........it was put on the "make again" list!

YUMMY!! I crave these babies! Used a chuck roast that I had in the crock pot and WOW. This is one of my all time favorites from this site. Used black olives instead of green and used just a yellow onion. Try these once in your lifetime

Yum! This dish had a delicious authentic flavor. I added the can of Rotel and a full teaspoon of Cumin for the extra kick, and my husband brought home fresh tortillas for it. These Enchiladas are sure to become a staple in my house.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Very easy to make and delicious.  Great leftovers also. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it worked out fine. I added rotel tomatoes w/chilis as suggested and it also came out very tasty.

This was pretty good, however, a little bland. Need to add some jalpenos. I did add a can of Rotel tomatoesw/green chilis. That did kick it up a notch! I have a King Ranch casserole that favors this. We kind of like it a little better.

This is excellent.  I didn't have green chile's so left them out.  I lessen the salt to 1/2 tsp. (could be cut back even more).  Omitted the frying in oil step, Just continued the recipe from that point.  Had leftover chicken that had been marinated in italian dressing and grilled, so I used that.  I live down in the Houston area and this recipe is right up there with the great Mexican restaurants down here.  Thanks again for sharing such a great recipe!!

I am in absolute agreement with another reviewer that said stop reading the reviews, make this recipe and enjoy.  The ONLY changes I made were due to lack of time.  I bought a roasted chicken from Publix, shredded enough for the recipe and added ancho chile powder, cumin and salt to the shredded chicken.  I did not have time to fry the tortillas so I simply added the filling, rolled them and topped with the salsa verde.  Right before putting in the oven, I added the cream and topped with cheese.  This is a delicious recipe and I will make over and over again.  Thank you Lisa C!

mmmmmmm!  another 5 stars for lisa c. !!  this recipe is wonderful!  it tastes as good or better than the restaurant version!  it does take a little time, but well worth it.  i substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 but otherwise followed the recipe to the t!  next time i think i'll add some jalapenos for a little more spice, but thats just our preference!  Even my 2 year old, 4 year old and 8 year old liked it!  And they are all picky eaters!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This recipie is truly from scratch and it shows: no store bought taco seasoning or enchilada sauce. It may take a bit more time, but not a lot and it's worth it. The flavor is wonderful and deep frying the shells a bit adds a lot.

This was a good recipe, but I added a little more spices and salt and pepper.

WOW!! This was a delicious dish. I mistakely bought chopped jalapenos rather than chopped chiles, a bit hot but still delicious. Will definitely make again but with the chiles...

I loved this recipe!!!  A change from the regular red enchilada sauce recipe I tend to use. Is definitely a keeper.

Awesome!! We never have leftovers when I serve this. I don't use the tomatoes in it out of preference. Easy to make, wonderful to eat!!

I just made these for my family for dinner and they were a HIT!! I only added hot sauce to the salsa.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

This recipe was really great. I made it for a large dinner party and it got rave reviews and I received many requests for the recipe.
