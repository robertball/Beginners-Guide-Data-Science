Just average and just okay as written. Because I love my macaroni and cheese creamy I love it made with Velveeta.  You can't ask for a smoother, creamier sauce.  But a good macaroni and cheese can't just depend on the Velveeta.  So...this was off to a good start but I made a couple of observations.  First, the flour isn't necessary.  At all.  In fact, I found I needed more milk just to overcome the thickness the flour was responsible for.  Second, this needed some cheesiness, and in the sauce, not just sprinkled on top.  A good spoonful of King Arthur Flour's Vermont Cheddar Cheese Powder fixed that right up.  (Love that stuff) Finally, and subjective perhaps, but I'm just not a fan of crushed Ritz crackers on my mac and cheese.  I crushed up some good bakery croutons and used them for the topping instead. Once I monkeyed around with this it was to die for - creamy, smooth, full of cheesy flavor and a topping with a slight buttery crunch.  Five stars with the above-mentioned modifications, but rather mediocre as is.

This recipe was awesome! My son's father said this was his new favorite meal (paired with a Arkansas Green Beans & Aussie Chicken, ~both recipes off this site). And he is somewhat hard to please at times, so to say his favorite, means a lot. 
The crushed crackers was a nice add on that id never tried before.

My kids loved this! I increase the servings and used mini shells instead of elbows. Easy and super kid friendly. I also added some sea salt, pepper, and dried mustard to the flour to make the sauce. Creamy and delicious! Thanks!

Made this for my roommates. When they took their first bites it looked like they had seen God. The dining room became still and silent for the remainder of the meal. We ate like monks reading the holy scripture; with endless appetite, but slowly, with a reverence for what it was we had the honor to consume. Allrecipes said it would be good, and lo, It Was Good.

I tweaked this after reading the reviews. First off I made mine for 12 servings. I used three spoonfuls of flour, not overflowing spoonfuls either. I used 6 spoonfuls of butter, increased the milk by 1/4 of a cup, and finally increased the Velveeta by 4oz (or a 1/4). I then added hot sauce, ground mustard, pepper, and salt. (first time I made this) I added bacon and sharp cheddar cheese. Topped it off with crushed french onions (because I NEVER have Ritz). (Second time I made this) I included Jalapenos, mushrooms, onions, bacon, and diced ham. They both were amazing, but my husband prefers all the stuff in it. VERY VERY creamy and cheesy!!! I give it 4 stars because I tweaked it and felt it was better because I did :)

Didn't really need the extra cheese on top but is good either way .  I've been making this for years after trying all the "gourmet" and celebrity chef recipes who scoff at Velveeta.  Sorry, but this is the best mac and cheese recipe out there.  It is super easy and is true comfort food.

I like rubbing butter on the bottom of the pan and shake some parmesean cheese over it before I pour the mac mixture in.  Layering the chedder is good too!

I literally just put this in the oven to bake. I definitely didn't follow the recipe I tweaked it up with my own spin. I did not use 1/4 cup of flour I just maybe 2 tbsp. instead and it made it just thick enough. also as I was stirring in the velveeta I added ground mustard and pepper. After I added the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce I mixed in some shredded cheddar and jack cheese. I am making this for my boyfriend and he love spicy stuff. hopefully it turns out super yummy.

This is a good basic recipe.  I read the reviews and added more milk and less flour and it worked out perfect.  We also like a lot more flavor so I added salt and pepper and 2 pinches of cayenne pepper.  Trust me, you will never know except to add a bit more flavor.  I will for sure make this again.

Easy recipe with room to add your own twist! I added 3 hotdogs, sprinkled gold fish cheese cracker crumbs and Parmesan cheese as the topping before baking. Kids loved it!

Made this recipe tonight, as written, no changes.  It was easy to make,  everyone enjoyed it. Both of my teenagers went back for seconds. As a matter of fact, it's gone.   I thought it was okay.  For me, it could have been a bit more cheesier, maybe the flour was the issue.  not sure,  but felt like something was missing. I'll make it again, maybe add some sharp cheddar?

Perfect as is, if you like it thick, add the flour, if not don't.  I didn't, and it came out just the way I like it,  creamy. I also added a pinch of onion powder to the cheese mix.  I just broiled it to brown the crackers, but If you want it in the oven for longer  just over cook your noodles a little so they will harden in the oven.

This recipe is definitely a good starting base.  As others have said, it needs less flour, more milk and more Velveeta.  I love the suggestion of adding jalapenos!  I'll make this again, with the changes!

As others suggested, I cut the flour in half and increased the amount of milk. I also replaced the Ritz crackers with crushed croutons and Italian spiced bread crumbs.

Just made this at the request of my 10 year old for her birthday dinner. Delicious!  At her request added cubed ham which was a nice addition and made this side dish a main course. I doubled the recipe and now our family of four has enough for another meal and then some.

This was DELICIOUS!  My family absolutely loved it..barely any left overs and what was left, they asked for breakfast the next morning.  Like some others, I found the flour unnecessary.  I cut the butter in half and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk so it wouldn't get too thick when I baked it.  I also doubled the cheddar.

With a few modifications this was great.  As written it is way too much flour.  I had to add another cup of milk to get the sauce the right consistency.  In addition to the velveeta cheese, I added a small amount of Tellagio, shredded sharp cheddar and shredded Monterey Jack, 1 tbsp. of dijon mustard, and  1/2 cup of cooked bacon pieces.  I've also made it with tomatillo sauce instead of the mustard.   This is wonderful with the modifications.

I loved it with a few tweaks. Doubled recipe but used 1/2 of the flour in the original recipe and 5 cups of milk. Also added salt, pepper, paprika and ground mustard. About 1tbs of each except for the salt. Just sprinkled it on top. Also I put it back in the oven under the broiler to crust the top after baking. About 5 min. I used cracker and jalapeno fried onions topper. Cooked in a 9 x 13 casserole dish. Perfectly creamy. Amount of milk may seem excessive but trust me, if you like a creamy Mac and cheese you need it. I might use even more next time!

Yum!!!! My girls and hubby devoured this entire pan! I used freshly grated sharp cheddar and doubled the cheese by adding half a cup to the sauce and the second half cup on the top. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and ground mustard to the sauce as well. I broiled it for a minute or two when it was finished baking. This was a hit that we will have again for sure. :)

Next time will only use fourth cup of Velveeta cheese. I used Blanco flavor Velveeta and more milk.  Then used one and fourth cup of Mexican blend shredded cheese.  Used Panko for the bread topping.  Was very good

This recipe made a decent macaroni and cheese.  I incorporated some of the changes suggested by other reviewers.  I didn't use flour, I added 1/4 cup of milk, I also added 1 tsp of paprika and 1 tbsp of dry mustard.  I used dry breadcrumbs instead of Ritz crackers.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

The taste was good, but I made some pretty major additions.
I was really looking for it to be A LOT cheesier.

I made this a while ago and it is so creamy.  The only thing I did differently was to add some hot sauce when I was making the cheese sauce.  We like things a bit spicy so I added 10 drops of Franks Red Hot sauce.  It still wasn't really spicy but it gave it a bit of a kick.  The leftovers also freeze nicely.

This is a great recipe!  My family loved it we called dibs on the crunchy topping! I added more milk more cheese and a bit of cream, lessen the amount of flour. Added jalapeno chopped.  NUMMY!

I doubled the recipe and I am glad I did because it was a hit! I followed everyones advise and reduced the flour and used more milk. For the doubled recipe I used 6 tsps of butter, 1/4 flour, 2 1/2 cups of milk, 4 cups of pasta, 12 oz of velveeta packets, a little salt, pepper, seasoning salt and about 1 cup of shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup of shredded mexican blend cheese. I toped with crackers and baked 25 minutes on 350. Perfect!

Loved this recipe!  I guess maybe I'm one of those traditionalists who likes a basic but delicious Mac and cheese without a bunch of unnecessary ingredients.  I followed the instructions with the following deviations:. 1-i skipped the flour and am glad I did.  It was plenty thick without it.  2-I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk to get the creamy sauce I prefer.3-i added a handful of shredded sharp white cheddar cheese to the sauce mix.4-I used  1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs mixed with 2 tbsp of melted butter for the topping and it crisped up perfectly.  I will absolutely make this again.  In fact I can't wait to!

When I make this recipe I have to add the packet of dried cheese mix from kraft mac and cheese to give it flavor. I'm going to make it with no flour next time as others have suggested because it's just to sticky instead of creamy. Gave my arm a good workout though!

Best mac n cheese they've ever had...that was the consensus at my Thanksgiving table this year.  Only thing wrong with it was that it was gone in a snap.  Will double next time! Don't change a thing...it's perfect.

I'm rating this recipe as written but adding one thing easily makes it into a five star dish.  I add a can of Progresso cheese starter into the cheese sauce.  It adds extra flavor and it is so much creamier, especially when heating any leftovers up. I didn't add the crackers. I feel like crackers or bread crumbs tend to take away from the creaminess and can make it dry. We like just a sprinkle of shredded colby-jack or cheddar cheese on top and let it brown a bit.

This was terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly and it looked SO GOOD pouring it in to the dish to bake it in. Oh, how I wish I had not baked it.  Baking it dried it out, it was thick and disgusting, I had to cut it with my serving spatula. First time I have ever thrown away and entire meal. Made me sick to do so as I looked for recipes to make at home to save money. Only gave it one star because you can't give zero.

I only made this because I needed to use up some  Velveeta cheese and I have to say it was way too dry. I thought this as I was preparing and almost added more milk, but wanted to make it as the recipe called for.  For anyone else wanting to try this recipe, I would add another cup of milk and maybe some  real cheddar cheese to add more flavor. I did like the topping though.

I made a double recipe to fill a 9' x 13" pottery baking dish. I don't usually bother to bake my mac and cheese but made this for my father's 82nd birthday party and followed the recipe as written (except for doubling the recipe and baking it a little bit longer - 30 minutes). The crispy cracker crumbs on top were super yummy!

This was Just delicious...Very creamy and cheesy as well!  I would make this again!
I did do a bit more than 2 cups of pasta because the cheese sauce is very generous... and I added a bit more milk so it wasn’t so thick.  This is def a mac n cheese kids will love!

It was ok. But it needs some seasoning.  I made exactly like the recipe.  But ended up sprinkling salt and pepper.  Maybe some paprika would be good too.  The bacon bits would probably be a good addition.

The only change I made to the recipe was to increase measurements for a bigger batch.  Turned out fantastic.  Added bacon but was thinking kielbasa sausage would work well too.  Definitely plan to make again.

I used leek sautéed with Vietnamese spicy chili garlic sauce. Used Country Crock plant butter instead made with avocado oil, and it turned out fine. I had some Sargento reduced fat cheese sticks to use up. Didn’t like them straight out of the package but the cheddar ones were great on top, just that as a topping it was more curds in place than shredded evenness. Used extra sharp cheddar Velveeta in the bechemel. Would love to make this again. This is a fantastic recipe. The macaroni and cheese was gooey, but not too gooey, creamy but not too creamy, packed with flavor. Pro tip: remember to take your pan toasted cracker crumbs off heat and don’t taste them straight off the pan. Burned my tongue.

No changes! The first time you make a new recipe, do it the way they say to do! Then one can adjust to their taste preferences.

I made it according to recipe, and although it was cheesy and creamy, it tasted just like the Velveeta boxed Mac and cheese, not homemade.  Just alittle disappointed

Pretty good as is.  I'm giving 4 stars because I'd double the ritz cracker topping.  I also added more milk because the cheese sauce was thicker than I liked. Will make again.

Giving it 4 stars as written because I followed naples' review and whisked a large spoonful of white cheddar into the milk to amp up the sharpness.I used whole milk, no flour.  Finished with a cup of buttered fresh breadcrumbs.

*I added the shredded cheese(shredded Mexican-its what i had) to the Velveeta mix along with 1/4 cup of Alfredo sauce(leftover in my fridge).
*I added pink salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried oregano to cheese mix... about 1 tsp of each.
*after spraying the pan i sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the pan
*I used garlic bread crumbs instead of RITZ crackers

Made this for my family Thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe and put it all in a 9x13 pyrex baking dish no problem. I also used shells instead of elbow macaroni. Kids came to the adult table to ask for it back after we took it. Definitely something to make again.

I only added about half
 the flour  and I used another reviewer's recommendation of putting butter on the bottom of the pan that's sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. I added salt pepper onion powder and garlic powder. I use bread crumbs mixed with parsley for the topping. Delicious!

I had to triple the recipe for a potluck Boy Scout function. I overlooked the noodles. Blech -- too mushy. The taste was a little bit bland for me. I may try adding some of the suggested spices like dry mustard or perhaps Dijon mustard. I used crushed garlic flavored crackers on top. That really helped boost the flavor. I will likley make it again and experiment.

Delicious macaroni and cheese like you remember as a kid.  I added crumbled bacon for my teenagers- Yum!  I also topped mine with chopped cherry tomatoes and avocado for some extra flavor. Basic recipe can hold its own too.

Solid base recipe. I added medium cheddar in with the velveeta instead of on top, as well as 1/2 cup sour cream for a bit of a tangy flavor, salt and pureed garlic.  Instead of the cracker topping I cooked up half a pound of bacon, crumbled it and topped the mac off with it. Yum!!!

Turned out very well, and I know this sounds weird but I gave it only 4 stars because it was too cheesy. The velveeta was way too thick on the macaroni. It needs something to thin it down some.

Really good basic mac-n-cheese recipe. BUT....omit the flour otherwise sauce will be too thick when fully cooked and be dry, and double the milk. Also, I added a can of corn (with the juice) AND some diced ham. And because I like the flavor it adds I did a whole roll or crackers. Six crackers is pointless. Go big or go home! Yummy!

Added salt, pepper and smoked paprika.  Also before baking added real bacon bits to the top.

I have made this mac and cheese for years and it always gets compliments.  I have tweaked it to our preferences over the years.  I usually double the recipe, use half whole milk and half heavy cream, add salt, pepper, garlic, and cholula (or tabasco).  Mix cheeses together with pasta and then dump more cheese on top.  I leave out the crackers and have added bacon.  It is a great recipe to make your own-the velveeta adds creaminess and you can play around with different types of cheese.

This is an excellent classic baked mac n cheese dish. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing it needs is salt to taste. I just lightly salted my portion at the table and it was perfect. This is a real family pleaser and great for a pot-luck

This is the recipe my mom used all our lives, we topped it with either pulled apart bread chunks or cubed white bread, then drizzle with butter and top with paprika.

I made this recipe because my boyfriend specifically requested a Velveeta Mac and Cheese.  This is not my first pick for a Mac and Cheese but if you are a Velveeta fan this recipe will give you a great Velveeta Mac and Cheese.  I added the shredded cheddar cheese on top to my liking and did not take an exact measurement of the shredded cheese.  I also more than doubled the amount of Ritz cracker topping to my liking so that the cracker topping would cover the whole dish.

My husband LOVES this recipe. By far the best Mac and Cheese!
I used the Kraft 3-cheese cheddar and it was very flavorful.
