Good quick recipe. I used two whole eggs and three egg whites and these turned out well. Was able to just throw all of the ingredients in  my personal blender and pour directly from blender to pan. Didn't take lots of dishes which is a big plus

I cut the recipe in half and still had 4 large pancakes! The egg whites measured 1/2 cup. I used a 1/4 cup measure for each pancake. The batter is very thin and does end up making rather flat pancakes, but put strawberries and blueberries on top, and you have a delicious, no-sugar added, very filling, healthy breakfast!

I also cut the recipe in half and these turned out great! I cut up some strawberries and spread some plain yogurt over the pancakes and it was delicious! Will definitely make again.

My kids and I loved this recipe! At least until they found out there was cottage cheese in it. I was able to hide the prep from them for months! The only thing I changed was using three whole eggs instead of just the whites. I couldn't justify wasting the yolks or buying egg whites alone. Just don't over cook them and the flavor is just fine. They're obviously not as fluffy as traditional pancakes but at least these have plenty of nutrition for kids on a school day!

This is a great recipe!  I added 1\4 teaspoon of cinnamon and the pancakes turned out really good.  So good, my kids wanted seconds and thirds!

It was pretty good and easy to follow and make. I added a bit flax seed and cinnamon to the batter precooking. Then some PB&J as toppings. Great meal, thanks!

These were SO egg-y and didn't taste a thing like pancakes.

I made a 1/2 recipe and used 2 full eggs instead of egg whites.  Turned out great - my daughter ate them all and asked me to make again.

I've made these both ways egg whites or using only three whole eggs. They taste delicious and friends and family love them couldn't tell the difference. They stay with you and make you not hungry for quite some time!  Quick and easy I've been making them for years.

Tasted like pancakes which is amazing considering the calorie content and protein. Batter was very thin. After i made one small cake i added an extra handful of oats. It thickened up and was much closer to the consistency you would expect. Easy cleanup and prep, great taste, protein, low calories.  Win, win, win, win!
