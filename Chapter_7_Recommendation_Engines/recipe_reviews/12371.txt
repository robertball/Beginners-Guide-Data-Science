This is a regular at our house.  Everyone loves it.  I use ready-made crusts and Swiss instead of Jarlsberg, otherwise, I follow the recipe as written.  Hubby likes the leftovers for breakfast the next morning!  Thanks.

Very, very good Eleanor. Due to lack of time, I had to cheat with this recipe. I used Pillsbury pie crusts and frozen hash browns. I used fat free half and half, which I doubled, asiago cheese and more seasonings. Family loved it!

The filling is yummy but I must say I did not use the recipe's pie crust because I love emeril's savory pie crust recipe.And in doing so, the pie just had that WOW factor in my mouth.

Pretty good dish!  I did use ready made pie crust and subbed swiss cheese for the Jarlsberg.  I think it's best to let this dish set for about 15 minutes after coming out of the oven for the flavors to meld together (it seemed to me to taste better toward the end of the meal)

My whole family loved this pie. The only thing I would change is to add more cream. For some reason this was abit dry. But I will continue to make this.

If I had realized this was a double crust pie, I wouldn't have bothered with it.  Since I'd already picked up the ingredients, I made it but only with the bottom crust. The pie was very tasty, but between the pie crusts, the fried potatoes, ham and cheese, this probably has a weeks worth of fat in a single serving!  The pie disappeared quickly, but I won't make again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  For the crust I used 2/3 cup of butter instead of shortening, increased the garlic by two additional cloves and used extra sharp cheddar cheese in stead of Jarlsberg.  This crust is great to use for sweet as well as savory pies!

I love this recipe, I don't make my own crust for this though therefore making this a quick and easy dinner.  My family is not found of Swiss cheese therefor I substitute a sharp cheddar.

Tasty pie, but I would increase the eggs and cream next time - I would double them to four eggs and 2/3 cup of cream.  I would have liked it to taste more like a quiche.  I think the eggs and cream would have brought all of the other ingredients together more.  I gave the dish four stars because I still thought the tastes were great, and it's an excellent way to use left-over ham.  I used some herbed goat cheese in addition to the cheddar cheese because I didn't have enough cheddar cheese left from Christmas.  Nice blending of tastes.

4.5 stars here. I did use a pre-made crust,  swiss & cheddar cheeses, & leftover deli ham. I mixed the ham & onion mixture w/the potatoes & just layered that w/the cheeses.  It all came together very well. I let it sit for about 20 min before cutting. Sliced beautifully! Taste was very good & it wasn't dry in the least!

I agree that this is great for leftover ham. And I used a ready made pie crust, there is do doubt that I will make this again and again.

Holy cow!  This was so good!  I'm too lazy to make the crust from scratch so I just used pre-made ones.  I also used Swiss cheese instead b/c I had some on hand.  WOW!!!!  I've never written a review before but this was so good I just had to!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  I also agree that it gets better the longer it sits.  Warmed some leftovers up for lunch today and it was even better than fresh from the oven.

This was really good--my hubby & his buddy loved it when I served it to them.  I thought the filling was a little dry and next time I will probably add extra cream (or milk).  It had great flavor, though!  I substituted Swiss cheese for the Jarlsberg.  I also made my own pie crust recipe rather than using the one listed (I have a family favorite pie crust recipe that I always use).  I will definitely make this again.
