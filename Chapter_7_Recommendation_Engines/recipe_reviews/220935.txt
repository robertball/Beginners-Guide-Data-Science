The crumb on this cake is just as described by the author of it.  This is an especially perfect cake for those who don't like things really sweet.  This was made with oranges picked right off the tree.  We thought this was just perfect for our morning coffee.   Be sure to try it with Avon's Warm Orange Sauce.  You want to know the best part??  I didn't even have to make it!  Candice did!  How lucky is that??

This is a classic! I held true to the ingredients but changed method just a bit. I creamed the oil, sugar, and eggs then added the other ingredients leaving the flour for last. My 14 year old daughter actually made this. We decorated it with the traditional giglio from Florence. It was a hit at Easter, but we'll make it again for no special occasion-we liked it that much. Next time, we'll substitute the orange for lemon. Thank you for the recipe.

Made this just now. Came out pretty good. I baked it in a loaf pan so had to cook it for a longer period. About 45 minutes. My husband loved it!!

I made it exactly as instructed. The cake was pretty and tasty, but I wanted a bit more orange taste so glazed it with a simple orange glaze. May try putting more OJ in the batter next time.

I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband didn't like this at all.
