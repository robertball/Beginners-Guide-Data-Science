I made these last night. They were a big hit with my family. I used a yellow cake mix because it was what I had on hand. I added a little vanilla extract, two eggs, and a little oil. Delicious! Very easy to make, and a very quick clean up.

I added 1/3 cup of water as other suggested.  I also added dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, and oatmeal.  I have taken them to several parties and they have been a hit!  Be sure to not over cook them - I take them out just before they look done because they firm up as they cool.  However, the batch I left in the whole time were gone even though they were crispier.

These were great! I, too, used 4 tbsp of water. Used a Betty Crocker Dark Chocolate cake mix w/Hersey's choc syrup in the box. Didn't use choc chips because I didn't have any (and didn't need any) but used 1-1/2 cups of chopped pecans. Made the house smell so good I couldn't wait so cut and ate two while they were still warm. Just wish I had some ice cream to put on top. Absolutely marvelous and still moist 3 days later kept in Tupperware. The only reason they lasted so long is because I live alone, plan on wrapping a few for the freezer before I eat them all. Can't wait to try different flavor variations. Thanks so much for posting Penny.

Pretty Darn Good!  I used a chocolate cake mix, 4 Tbsp of water and baked for 25 min.  I also stirred in a 1/2 package of Skor Bits (toffee bits) into the batter, and sprinkled the other 1/2 package on top of the hot bars as soon as they came out of the oven.  My co-workers inhaled them.  Nice texture---sort of like if cake and brownies had a baby.
Will definitely make again--super easy, great taste.

I made this yesterday because it seemed easy and I already had everything I needed in the pantry.  I followed other suggestions and increased the water to 1/3 cup, and baked for only 22 minutes.  I used white cake mix with 1 cup of white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup craisins and some nuts.  The baking time was perfect so mine did not come out dry at all.  Will definitely make again because they are so easy and quick!

I made these last week because I needed something to take to an open house, and I wanted to make a bar cookie (therefore something quick)with ingredients I had on hand.  So here's my take....way too sweet!  Holy cow!  And a bit too oily.  But, very tasty!  I had a very similar recipe that my neighbor gave me three years ago, and that my daughters love to make.  It calls for the cake mix, a 1/2 cup of oil (instead of butter), NO ADDED SUGAR, 2 eggs (rather than 1), 2 TBS. water, and the chips and nuts.  You make regular drop cookies with this, and bake them for 8-10 minutes.  This is a fantastic recipe for young kids, and it is extremely versatile.  We usually make it with M&M's in place of the chips, and no nuts, but we have also used chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.  I now always keep cake mixes in the pantry for when the girls want to bake cookies (this is also a good project for them to do on play dates).  So, last night I had a yen to make these bar cookies again, but I used this older recipe, but with only about 1/3 cup of sofened butter instead of the oil, and only 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Delicious!  Perfect!  I would definitely recommend that you try this variation.

This is nice because you can throw just about anything you have in it. To get rid of odds and ends in my fridge, I mixed butterscotch chips, semisweet chips, and 70% bittersweet baking bar, ~1.25 cups in all, added pecans and a little extra water as suggested. Next time I'll make in several smaller pans because the edges and corners are the best, a little crispy.

I did not like this recipe at all!  The consistency was not that good, and the cookies came out out hard and not very tasty.  Nothing like real home made cookies from scratch!

Great recipe and so quick and easy to make.  I followed the suggestion of adding 1/3 c water and the dough was still really thick.  To make spreading it in the pan easier, I turned the wax bag from the cake mix inside out, put my hand into the bag and pressed the dough onto the cookie sheet.

These turned out dry and hard even after adding the extra water.  They tasted good, like a hard chocolet chip cookie.  I put a scoop of ice cream on top to soften them up a bit when I served it for dessert.

I followed the recipe to a tee and made no modifications...it turned out great! It was a big hit at my workplace. Very simple & delicious. Be sure not to over bake these bars as they do firm up after you take them out of the oven.

Oooohhhh!! I used yellow cake mix. I added about a 1/2 cup peanut butter to the brown sugar and butter while mixing. Also added a splash of vanilla extract and a splash of oil on top of 4 TBSP water. Baked for 23 minutes and it's perfect. Yummmm.... Thanks for the recipe.

Gave it 5 stars because I read the reviews first. It came out PERFECT with 1/4 c water and two eggs. Best darned cookie bar I ever made!  Making it again today. Hubby LOVES it too.

For this recipe, I used an all natural vanilla cake mix and  about 1 1/2 cups of Ghiradelli semisweet chips, and omitted the nuts. I also added and extra egg and vanilla based on other reviewers. I baked bars in a 12x8 disposable pan, so I cut the cooking time a bit. However, I ended up having to put them back in because they were a bit too undercooked. So, the cooking time is accurate even using a slightly smaller pan. Next time, I will cut the chips back due to the fact my cake mix was only 16oz, and not the typical 18.25 pkg. This is a delicious recipe and I would definitely make this again. I like it better than traditional cookies!

Since many said these bar cookies were too sweet, I opted to not add the brown sugar.  Why does this recipe need added sugar anyway?  There is already sugar in the cake mix.  I also added 1/3 cup water and baked it for 22 minutes as suggested by other reviewers.  Very good, fast recipe.

After reading the reviews on these I made them as written except for adding 1 tsp of vanilla and upping the water to 4tablespoons. These were delicious! Moist and chewy and baked perfectly after about 28 minutes in the oven! We will be making these again! Thank you!

Great recipe! I added the 1/3 cup water as suggested, as well as a tsp. of vanilla and 2 tbsp of oil.  I also used some candied walnuts I had in the cupboard. Baked only 22 minutes, but turned out chewy and yummy. Will definitely make this again!

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is one of my favorite.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I always know these will be a big hit at any party.  NOTE:  The picture is from someone who used a chocolate cake mix - not a white cake mix as specified in the recipe.

This recipe was easy, I added 3 Tbsp water and 1 tbsp oil, and no nuts. Tasted good, I also added melted chocolate chips on top...as if there wasn't enough chocolate already...delicious! Will try new variations of cake mix flavors with this recipe.

They looked perfect on the outside but were so under done they were inedible. I did get a taste of one of the edges and they probably would have been delicious if they had cooked through, thus the five star rating.

Great flavor, made the recipe exactly as listed, except for the nuts. Although the flavor was excellent and my kids, 9 and 6 liked it, if was very crumbly and messy. Needs a bit of a binding agent to hold it together, maybe another egg.

as written these are pretty decent - tastes similar to the traditional toll house cookie bars, really.  however, i think i prefer the toll house recipe...but this has potential. i think this recipe would be great with alterations - changing up the cake mix and add-ins to create new flavor combos.  i bet spice cake mix or a double chocolate mix with chips would be amazing.  i will keep this recipe to try again with new cake mix and filling, but probably wouldn't make them with the white cake mix again.

We loved this recipe! I doubled it. Used 2 chocolate cake mixes, added 2/3 cup water as suggested (since it was doubled) and pressed it into a greased 10x15 inch pan and a greased 9x9 pan. Fit perfectly! Topped it with Christmas m&ms and it was perfect for my cookie plates this year. Soft and chewy! Thanks!

We loved this recipe. I have the Pampered Chef large bar pan and this fits it perfectly. I have made this twice. Once with Dark Chocolate cake mix, adding chopped almonds and heath bar bits instead of the walnuts, and once using a regular chocolate cake mix, with 1tsp of mint extract added with the egg and water. I also omitted the walnuts that time. I used parchment paper with the mint batch and nothing stuck. The previous time, I brushed my stoneware with just a touch of oil, because chocolate chips can cause sticking. This is an awesome recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These are great! They're so quick and simple to make. I make some cakes using a mix, but this was the first time I used it for the bars. Based on previous reviews I did add the extra 2 TBSP water. I also added 1 tsp vanilla because I like vanilla!! Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I might try a chocolate cake mix. I think this recipe has potential for change!  Thanks Penny for posting this recipe -it's fun to try a recipe that is unique and so easy!

This recipe is 5 star as others stated. Used a yellow cake mix, made an adjustment as others suggested & did 1 more step. Same thing I do when making brownies. Added 1 Tablespoon of Karo Syrup (corn syrup)This step makes a a chewie cookie! Make sure it's just golden brown. Mine baked in 25 minutes. Dessert is best made the day before. Flavors blend & mellow.

I made these tonight for a bake sale. Just to say they are great would be a understatement.  For how quick, easy and inexpensive they are to make they are fabulous! I used 2 eggs, no water and a tsp of vanilla like the other comments suggested. I also sprinkled some rainbow chip sprinkles on the top to make them fun for kids.  I gave a end piece to my husband and he had no clue they were made with a cake mix.

Yum! So easy, my 6yo was able to do most of it. The only thing that I changed was I used two eggs instead of adding water, and used a yellow cake mix because that's what was in my cupboard.  Excellent cookies!

I love this recipe. I made it for the first time with lemon cake mix, didn't use any mix ins, and it was great. It was fine as is, but I could see how adding 1 more TBS of water might be good. So quick & easy, yet moist & rich.

What a lifesaver!  Needed something to bring the next day at school, was able to take what I had on hand and throw together quickly and it was great!  Did use the extra water, semi-sweet chips, peanuts and white cake mix.  Can't wait to try other combinations.

I'm constantly baking for my church's bake sales and coffee hours and I have little time to spare.  I used this great basic recipe to bake for our latest bake sale.  I figured I had some cake mixes on hand and it was quick and easy.  I decided against the choc-chip variety because I know there will be a ton of that at the bake sale.  My combination was: Spice Cake Mix instead of a white cake and instead of choc. chips- toffee bits.  So the end product is spice bars with toffee and walnuts- they are moist, yummy and will be great with coffee.  Thanks for a great basic recipe that I can change weekly!

pretty good! per other reviews i used 3 eggs and 3 tblsp water...i also used reduced sugar chocolate cake mix, splenda brown sugar, pecans and chocolate chips...the batter was VERY thick and wasn't sure if this would work...i did have to bake for the full 30 minutes because at 22 min it was still uncooked...it wasn't dry,it was very moist, however next time i think i will either use more butter or add some oil to make it less cake like..

Great recipe!  I used a chocolate cake mix with 3 eggs and no water for the best brownies ever.  Don't bake them too long! I also added chocolate chips to the batter before they were baked.

A good recipe however, even after using 4 T. H2O I felt the dough was too stiff. I added another stick of butter,and another egg, and then a few more T. of H2O. I baked them in a greased 10x15 pan. I also changed the add ins to 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of Heath chips. Cut them into 1 x 2 inch bars. These were the first cookies to disappear from a tray of Christmas cookies. I will make them again using different cake mixes and add ins.

This cake mix cookie bar is actually better than what I thought. It's really easy and convenient to make while it taste somewhat like a real chocolate brownie bar. Terrific!

Just out of the oven.... I used a Halloween cake mix I got on clearance and followed the suggested modifications. 1/3 c of water, two eggs instead of one, a splash of oil, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Mine took 32 minutes to bake to perfection. Not too well done at all! Will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe for the most part. The only things I did differently were that I did use 1/3 cup of water, as others suggested. I also used yellow cake mix instead of white. I baked for 25 minutes at 350. I was a little skeptical of how this might turn out, thinking it might taste just like cake mix. I was so wrong! These came out perfect, delicious and addictive. Wonderful!

I made this exactly as instructed. I probably would have made some of the recommended changes if I had the opportunity to read the reviews before starting them. But I didn't, and I'm glad. THey are totally perfect! Yummy, crispy outside, gooey inside. Couldn't have picked a better recipe to try. Just like someone else said - as if brownies and cookies had babies. :)  I tried chocolate cake mix with white chocolate chips and yellow cake mix with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Both are amazing!

Delicious! Like a chewy chocolate chip cookie. I followed other users' suggestions and used 2 eggs and 4 Tbsp of water and some vanilla exctract. I added a bag of toffee chips along with the semi sweet chips. Easy to make and tasty!!

Loved the idea, so adapted the recipe to work with a favorite brownie recipe. I used a Devil's food cake mix, added 1 teaspoon each vanilla, cinnamon, coffee extract,and sea salt. I used pecans instead of walnuts and eliminated the chocolate chips.Using the suggested 22 minute baking time from another post...they came out YUMMY!

I misread the recipe and it still came out great.  I added 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup and the batter was very stiff, but it was very good.  I will make this recipe again, this time won't have "3/4" in my head.  For the chips, I used one cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks and did use chopped walnuts.  I like the versatility of the recipe, you can add what you have on hand or like.

Awesome! I've never used cake mix to make anything but a cake. I changed the recipe as others suggested and they where perfect! Might be better than my step-mother's from scratch choco chip cookie version.

Not bad. I used a white cake and I found the bars to be pretty sweet. Next time I will try a chocolate cake mix and possibly lower the sugar like some of the other reviewers have suggested.

Made this with my 8 yr old and it was a hit!  I did it with yellow cake mix and let him pick what he wanted to add.  He chose milk choc. chips and white choc chips.  It was so yummy!  Can't wait to try all the different combos!    I did add 4 Tbsp of water.

An easy recipe to whip up for surprise events, but it seemed too sugary sweet. I used 1/3 cup water and omitted the nuts due to personal preference. I can see why others added the dried cranberries. Maybe the tartness from the cranberries would offset the sugar. I would make this again if in a pinch to put something together.

I followed other's reviews and added 5 T of water and 2 eggs.  I used chocolate cake mix and chocolate and peanut butter chips.  My family and guests loved them...this is a winner!

These were sooo good!!!I did make a couple of alterations though. I added 1/3 cup of water and 2 eggs. At first this looks like too much liquid by itself, but then when you mix the cake mix in you know why you need that much liquid. I also skipped the nuts and chocolate chips and just added butterscotch chips. The result was a super yummy, moist, cake like dessert!

Super yummy with minimal effort. I made a double batch with 1 white cake, 1 yellow cake and a large package of instant vanilla jello (since I was out of the super moist cake mixes).  I followed other's comments and increased the water and egg (for the double batch with the added jello I used 5 eggs and 5 Tbs water).  I also cooked in a glass pyrex, so I increased the cooking time to when a toothpick came out clean, ~45 minutes.

This recipe is excellent for a quick dessert or snack. It is rich and satisfies any sweet tooth or chocolate craving! I followed the advice and used two eggs and 3 T of water with great results. My bakeware is dark and very heavy so I lowered the oven temp to 325, which is what I always do when using these pans - and the recipe finished with a uniform, moist and chewy texture. I also line my pans with parchment and midway through the cooling time I remove the entire thing by lifting the ends of the parchment and allowing it to cool the rest of the way sitting on the parchment on a cooling rack. This prevents any sweating which allows a mild crust to form on the bottom and seems to help lock in the moisture. This might be why mine never get dry or crumbly. Each time I've made this recipe, I cut one row of cookies while they are still warm and don't cut the remainder until the following morning. The warm ones are to die for. In the morning, I cutthe rest that have completely cooled and take them to work to serve to my colleagues and customers and I ALWAYS have requests for the recipe. So be warned . . . if you take these out of the house, take along copies of the recipe - people LOVE these!

I made a few adjustments, but these turned out pretty nice.  Instead of the butter, I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  And as someone else suggested, I added no water, but three eggs instead.  I cut the semi-sweet chocolate chips in half and added 1 cup butterscotch chips, along with 1 cup chopped walnuts.  The consistency of the bars was great.  But I think next time, I would skip the brown sugar altogether.  They are very, very sweet.  Not sure if it was the sugar or the butterscotch chips, but it almost makes my teeth hurt to bite into one they are so sweet.  Still, I did like the fact that it tastes NOTHING like you used a box cake mix.  Which was my big concern.  Will try this one again, though the sugar will be omitted next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great basic recipe that I use all the time. I have two young kids and it's so easy to make and everyone always wants the recipe. I did take other reviewers advice and put 2 eggs and 3 T of water. I also change up the cake mix with a brownie cake mix sometimes but its definitely the best with the white cake mix. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great tasting and fast way to make a dessert. I used a while cake mix. After reading the reviews I decided to use two eggs instead of one. I also added ½ cups chocolate chip and ½ cup of butterscotch chips and 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I only baked it for 30 minutes. It was very much like a blond brownie and very very good.

I made two batches of these and they were both wonderful! I left out the nuts, because I hate them. One batch was dark chocolate cake mix/semi sweet chips. The other was yellow mix/semi sweet chips. They are all gone! I did use the others tips and increased the water to 1/3 cup, I baked for 30 minutes and they were perfect. I will be making these again. Cant wait to try it with other cake mixes.

Wow, this is a great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was add another 2 Tbsp. of water, used yellow cake mix instead of white, and only used 1C of chocolate chips.  2 cups would have been too much for me.  I don't know what others did that made it dry, but mine was moist and delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks OP

I do agree that this is an easy recipe to make, but 
I was not delighted with the finished product.  It became very dry after cooling and I feel was not worth the cost of the ingredients.  Sorry.

This is  my most used recipe. My favorite is yellow cake mix with white chips-soooo good. Chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips tastes like brownies. I use 4 to 5 tbl of water and I find that 22 min is the perfect bake time for a somewhat chewy bar. So good.

I also added 2 more T water.  I omitted the nuts, and used 1 cup peanut butter chips and 1 cup semisweet chips.  These are great!  The texture was good (soft and cakelike) and there's a crispy top.  I'll make this again.

These were great! I used a chocolate cake mix because I was having a chocolate craving but omitted the chocolate chips because I didn't have any. I used 4 Tbsp. water, as suggested by a previous reveiwer. I normally bake and cook from scratch but lately I've been pressed for time so I've tried mix-based recipes. I wasn't disappointed in the least with this one! The bars were moist and chewy and oh so chocolatey.

They were amazing, used yellow cake mix, followed other reviewers and added 1/3 cup water, 2 eggs and a splash of vanilla. Used white and semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked for 27 min. Everyone loved them!

Wow! Easy and SO good. I did follow the advice others posted and increased the water to 1/3 cup, but otherwise followed the instructions as written. This is a great recipe to play with the flavor combos. Tonight I used Devil's Food cake, Ghirardelli double chocolate chips and chopped pecans. My oven is pretty true-to-temperature, so 30 minutes was perfect. Again, wow! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We buy cake mixes when they are on sale. Then I always have the ingredients needed for these yummy bars at a moments notice for bake sales and such. We use 1/4 cup of water. I use 1/2 cup of chips mixed in and 1/2 cup poured on top before baking. We have used chocolate chips, toffee pieces, mini m&m's, and peanut butter chips. All are good!

I make around 20 dozen cookies every other week for Hospice. These are one of the most requested. I use yellow or white cake mix and they're so good. I've make them as bar cookies as well as regular cookies and they work either way. Need to try some of the other flavors.

I made this recipe twice, but with a few substitutions due to what I had on hand: I used 15.25 oz cake mix (pudding in the mix; a butter recipe yellow and a chocolate fudge ), instead of an 18 oz box; milk for water and 1.5 to 2 cups of assorted chopped up candy instead of the semi sweet chocolate chips and nuts. It turned out great! Though I didn't follow the original recipe, I still rated it five stars, as I think I would've had similar successful results.

This recipe is a great starting point but I did take the hints of others here and added an additional egg, 2 more tablespoons of water, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The bars did take a little longer to bake, however (about 40 minutes), but they were perfect.

I have made this so many ways and times we love it!  I do add more water 1/3 cup + 1 TBLSP.  I also have a grandson with an egg allergy (no whites) so I made this with 2 egg yokes instead they turned out fantastic. We couldn't tell the difference.  I do reduce the cooking time to 30 min.  I start checking them at 25 do not overcook these they will get hard.  Very easy quick dessert YUMMY!! thanks for sharing

NOTE:  they are thick to spread in pan

This was great! I made it for the fire department fundraiser, used caramel chips, chocolate chips, and walnuts. It took a little longer than 35 minutes to bake, but the bars were not hard like some reviewers found. I did increase the water two more tablespoons. It was quite sweet, probably due in part by the caramel chips, but yummy!

My son said these were the best. As others had commented, I chose to alter by using 2 eggs, 1/4 cup water, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and baked for only 18 minutes since my little oven cooks very fast. Also my cake mix that I just happened to have was 16.5 oz., I added the entire 12 oz bag of chocolate chips and it turned out very well.

Terrific soft chewy bars. I think I had success because I baked them at 325 on convection for 30 min until golden. After reading other reviews, I used yellow cake mix, 1/3 c. light brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1/4 c. water and 1 1/2 c mixture of white and dark choc chips.

I made this recipe last night and it was wonderful.  I used a gluten-free cake mix that was only 15 oz. (instead of the 18 oz. mix required by the recipe) and it came out great! I cooked it at my boyfriend's house, and he doesn't have an electric mixer.  Still - it turned out so good.  We ate it warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream.  I'll definitely be making this again because it was quick, easy and very tasty.

this is a wonderful recipe... instead of walnuts and choc chips as called   I put in 2oz of sliced almonds, 2/3 cup of coconut, and 2 cups of extra large choc chips.
I get lots of compliments on these bar cookies. Enjoy!

My 10yo made this recipe with me just watching from nearby.  Super easy, and soo sooo good.  

The only change is we did add just a touch more water to make it a little thinner. Definite winner.

So, my biggest mistake making these is that I took them out of the oven after 35 minutes and figured they looked done, so I didn't test them with a knife. Not wise for they were NOT done. After I let them cool I cut them and discovered that I should have left them in longer. The edges were salvagable, but I had to throw the middle away. Even after adding a healthy glug of vanilla these still had the "from a box" taste to me. I will make these again because they are so easy and I do think they have potential... Just next time I will make sure to test them before I turn the oven off!

I made these tonight and they were amazing!  I used a Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake mix and made it exactly as the recipe called for.  I only baked them for about 20-22 minutes in a convection oven.  (instead of 30-35 as called for)  
I didn't add the nuts being my husband doesn't care for nuts.  They were moist and hard to stop eating!!  I will definitely make them again!  I may try a different flavor cake mix next time also!  Thank you for this great and easy cookie recipe!

Fast, easy bar cookie.  I had a box of Christmas Holiday Confetti cake mix to use up.  Found this recipe to very good and I had all the ingredients on hand.  DH thought they were great and proceeded to eat most of them in 2 days.  You could make this recipe with any combination of cake mix and flavored chips.  I will be making this one again.

I used funfetti cake mix and the little pieces of funfetti made a nice addition to these bar cookies. Easy to mix, nice and chocolatey, was done right at 30 min. No fuss, this recipe is a keeper.

These are VERY good. I can cook and bake most anything.. but Chocolate chip cookies seem to always get the best of me. These were very easy to make and like I said, VERY good. I used Funfetti Cake Mix-which made them turn out very cute and festive looking.. I followed other comments and added the extra water because it looked WAY too dry. I didn't put in the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand. My husband, son, and neighbor loved them though, so that's all that matters. Only thing... they may need left in the oven a BIT longer than it says.. and make sure you wait til they cool to cut them. It's hard, I know.. but it DOES make all the difference.

Very easy and tasty. I used chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. I regret using so much butterscotch because it was too sweet for my taste. Otherwise, these are nice for a quick dessert.

These looked so good that I decided to make them.  Right away I realized that they would not be "chocolate" unless I used chocolate cake mix.  So I substituted (can anyone say otherwise?).  I went on following the instructions  The ratio of dry and wet ingredients left it unmixable (too dry).  So I read other reviews  and decided to add  another egg and more water.  When I got it to a typical brownie consistancy, I spread it in a pan.  My pan may have been slighly larger than what is in the recipe, but there was barely enough batter to cover it.  I would suggest a 10 x 10 pan.  Anyway, the brownies are good, but too many changes are needed to make the recipe work.

They're addictive! I followed the advice of others and altered: 1/4 cup water, 2 eggs, yellow cake mix, 1 cup choco chips, 1 cup butterscotch chips. Also, they're great chilled. A definite regular for dessert time!

I must have done something wrong. My bars were NOT chocolate, the receipe calls for white cake mix,..I followed the receipe and even checked back twice to see if the chips were melted BEFORE adding them.... was not chocolate...or brownie color at all like the picture!!! Mine looked like Chocolate chip-bar cookies and was too oily.  I used real butter and followed the receipe exactly..... :0(

This is really good and very easy.  I subsituted 1 cup of quick cooking oats for the nuts and my family loved it.  I will do as another reviewer suggested and subsitute different cake mixes and chips for some further variety.  Cherry chips, macadamia nuts and a white cake mix...YUM!

Super easy recipe with great results.  I used a Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and dark chocolate cips for a decadent New Years Eve dessert.  I cut them into smaller pieces so they were bot size and they were a huge hit.  I am going to try with different mixed and chips or nuts for different occasions.

Edible, but not good.  Would probably be better if made with white chocolate chips, cranberries, and oatmeal as other reviewers tried.  As is, doesn't taste much like a chocolate chip cookie.

I love this recipe for the simplicity (one bowl, one spoon, one measuring cup, and one pan), but these cookies are so yummy too! 
I have made them twice - once with a white cake mix and once with a yellow cake mix. Both were good - I actually preferred the yellow, it had more of a vanilla taste. People love these and have no idea how easy they are to make.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written, baked for 30 minutes, and they are so soft and so yummy. I'm enjoying one now with a glass of milk--perfect!

One of the best bar cookies I have made.  I did use as suggested, 1/4 cup of water and 2 eggs... cooked for 30 minutes and they came out perfect!

These are truly delicious. They came out even better than I expected. I had a yellow butter cake mix. I didn't add any nuts because I was unsure if who I was making them for had an allergy or not. I would definately make these again.

I used yellow cake mix instead of white, and added an extra 2-3 tablespoons of water (seemed too dry).  These came out great--better than the homemade bars I've tried.

I made the alterations recommended and these turned out great and were a rescue. I needed to make brownies for my sons class and thought I had a brownie mix but it was a chocolate cake mix. I used this and they turned out very brownie like. Thanks

These turned out great.  I used devil's food cake mix and brewed coffee instead of the water and they were great.  Next time, though, I'll add a bit of oil so the dough is a bit easier to handle.

This recipe was so easy--perfect for my preschooler and toddler to help make.  These were great when they first came out of the oven--soft and chewy.  After they cooled completley, they were a bit hard.  Maybe next time I'll lessen the cooking time more than I did.  Overall, a good wuick easy recipe.

These are incredibly easy and taste great right out of the oven.  They do dry out quickly, though.  They didn't taste as great the next day, but they may not last that long at some households.  I added butterscotch chips to mine.

Loved this bar cookie.  I used french vanilla cake mix
and pretty good but a little too sweet.  Next time I will
use a different cake mix.  Would adding a little oil make them moister??

This is a super recipe! I've made it half a dozen times in the past month, and my boys love it. I use yellow cake mix, pecans instead of walnuts (one of my sons is allergic), and peanut butter chips instead of the choc. chips (we're not big choc. fans), and I add more like 1/3 c. water, or the batter is too thick. The possibilities are endless. The last time I made it, I used white choc. chips and chopped hazelnuts. Delicious!

This was quick and easy.  The kids loved them!  the flavor definitely had a hint of a cake-like bar.  I sometimes just buy a cookie mix pouch and add 2 extra Tbsp oil to pkg directions and put in 8 x 8 pan also which is also good....

I also added the 4 tablespoons of water and they turned out great. They aren't too sweet and they cut nicely. Very easy to make, too. I will definitely make these again. They pack very well in school sack lunches.

Very good bar cookies, I used some of the other review suggestions and used 4T water, and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I took this along to a parent group we belong to and I had one comment that it was too sweet (I might cut down brown sugar) and several comments  that it tasted like pecan pie.  I thought it was GREAT!!! Thanks!

These cookies are easy to make, and I have yet to find someone who doesn't absolutely love them. I took some to work with me and everyone asked for the recipe. I used pecans instead of walnuts and used just one cup of the chocolate chips. My husband says they're the best cookies I've ever made. Thanks!

This recipe is wonderfully simple.  It bakes up just like chocolate chip bar cookies.

I used yellow cake mix and did increase the water like was suggeted and also added 2T oil.  Since my family doesn't really like walnuts or pecans, in addition to the chocolate chips,  I used chopped almonds (1/2 in batter and 1/2 on top) with a generous drizzle on the top of caramel ice cream topping.  Turned out like a salted caramel flavor!.  It was super easy!

These are so easy to make. I  use a french vanilla cake mix. I have added chocolate chips, oatmeal, peanut butter chips, M&Ms, raisins. Etc. you might want to cut back on the brown sugar cuz they’re already very very sweet ( depending on what you add)  another time  I replaced half the butter with peanut butter.

This was such a simple yet delicious recipe. I made it with a gluten free funfetti cake mix so I had to add a bit more water and I did not add chocolate chips or nuts but they still turned out yummy!

Perfect for a crowd of kids without fussing. I used 1/3 cup water and added mini-m&m's in a yellow cake mix. Baked for 25 minutes.

Because of other reviewers, I increased the water to 1/3 cup,  used 2 eggs and added 1/2 tsp of  vanilla. I used a yellow cake mix instead of white, like others, because it's what I had on hand. People asked for the recipe. It's one of those "last-minute, I need something quickly" recipes that I'll keep around.

I used orange cake mix, white chips and walnuts. I used 2 eggs and 4 tablespoons  of water as others suggested. They were delicious.   My daughter can’t eat chocolate so this was a good choice for her. She was able to enjoy them with everyone else.

This was so simple and good. Very versatile recipe that can be adapted to what ever you have on hand which is what I did. Used yellow cake mix and toffee chips because that's what was in the pantry. My boys are begging me to make them again.

I used butter pecan mix, 1/2 cup of *melted* butter (so that I wouldn't have to get my stand mixer out), one egg, 1 tsp vanilla, and just under 2 tbs of water. I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips, about half of a milk chocolate hazelnut lindt bar and a bunch of crushed pecans. Baked for 25 minutes. So easy and very tasty. Oh and pan was  slightly smaller than a 9 x 13 as I didn't want them to be too thin.

I used Splenda mix brown sugar and sugar free yellow cake mix. Low sugar version! Still delicious! Co-workers said it was they best they've tasted! (Oh, and I did add a little more water - it was just too thick to work with. I'll try the 1/3 cup next time)

The first time I made these they came out perfect. The second time they were as hard as rock. I followed the directions exactly BUT used a different cake mix brand. The dough was too stiff in the mixing process. Any advice?

I was quite surprised with this simple recipe. I had my doubts since I am a traditionalist when making cookies, but these turned out to taste great and had a very nice texture drop cookies rarely have.

I used 2 eggs and 1/3 cup water,  1/2 cup butter, 1 t vanilla, a spice cake mix and peanut butter chips. Next time I would  mix the chips into the batter, spread batter in the cake pan THEN sprinkle more chips on top. This is a "keeper" recipe for me!

This was a great recipe, I used a butter pecan cake mix, I did use 4 Tablespoons of water and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Came out very buttery and soft. I did put a thin layer of coconut pecan frosting on it. It was wonderful I will be making this again.

This  was exactly what I was looking for, something easy and quick. I used a yellow cake mix and after reading some of reviews I added  an extra egg, 2 tbls extra  water, and a tsp vanilla. I think next time I will use only 1 or 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I love chocolate but my cookies didn't look like the picture. Cut up you can only see melted chocolate chips.  Which I loved but my family thought  they were a bit to sweet but they ate them and enjoyed the treat.

Delicious and the grandkids loved them! I followed the recipe except added the vanilla as suggested by another review. I did bake them for 40 minutes as they were not done in 35, the middle was still too runny.

5stars gor Versatile & easy & yummy!
 These will set up / cont to cook once taken out so 25-30min max.   Next time (tomrw) I will try suggestions to increase water to 1/3c, add vanilla, & use 2 eggs.

I love this recipe!  It's easy, only takes a few ingredients, and only uses one bowl to mix it all up.  I often make it at our camp because you can stir it up by hand.

Made this tonight because I was craving something sweet. I added a mixture of dark and light brown sugar. 3 tbsp water and my cake mix 2 as only 8.5 ounces. Also added a little vanilla. Baked for 20 mins and these came put delicious! Especially the edges that are crispy. They were a hit with my family. They are already requesting more. Can't wait to try other variations.

As suggested by others, used a yellow cake mix, 2 eggs, 4 Tbl water, subbed pecans, butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.

I would've given this maybe a 2.5 star.  It tasted too much like cake mix to me.  I think the effort it took to make this, I would just rather make it from scratch.

It was unclear if I was supposed to add the oil, eggs and water that the cake mix called for. I  added another egg and some water.

I'm making the recipe with chocolate cake mix as we speak.  Used 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of water and 2 eggs after reading the reviews.  The dough is still quite stiff so next time I'll try the 1/3 cup of water.  Will be pushing the dough into the pan so the review that suggested using the cake mix box waxed type paper to press dough in, will be what I will try.  I'm leaving out chocolate chips except for a few chopped chocolate chunks that I used to make up for my scant cup of chopped walnuts.  I predict great success but won't know until I taste them at our weekly community supper. Decided on the chocolate cake mix because I'd rather have brownies if any are left over.

Made these a few weeks ago, pretty good, but, still a little cakey tasting.  Will probably just stick with making them the other way.

I've tried different cake mix and add-in combos, and they always come out well. My hubby likes when I make these. I add a couple more tablespoons of water if needed. I prefer "real" bar cookies or brownies, but these are easy and tasty.

AWESOME!!!! I made this spur of the moment with chocolate cake mix and 1/4 c water. Came out like a delicious brownie! Very good! I bet it is just as good with yellow mix.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was a hit! I increased the water to 4 T. as others indicated. I also baked it in two, 9" cake pans instead of a 9 x 13 for 25 minutes at 325 degrees (my pans are dark, so I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees). Then, I wrote "Happy Birthday" in frosting on the top. Very easy recipe!

Four stars because this is so easy and I needed something quick, that would travel well. I followed other reviewer's advice and added  and extra egg, vanilla and increased the water to 1/4 cup. Vanilla helped to improve the "cake mix" flavor that I don't usually like. Turns out like a chewy cookie.

As far as ease and speed or preparation, this gets five stars.  However, the taste just didn't quite cut it for me.  These are great if you are in a crunch for time and need to provide a quick dessert, but this will not win prizes for most memorable dessert.

I made this as written except I used a funfetti cake because that's what I had on hand and I used two eggs and 4t of water per reviews. This was very good and my entire family loved it. I would say it is best described as one reviewer said as a cross between a brownie and a cookie.
 The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it was VERY sweet. This is coming from a person who is a big sweets eater. It is very seldom that I have to stop eating something because of it being so rich and sweet but that was the case with these bars. I think next time I will try it without the brown sugar and see how it turns out. There will be a next time for sure as I plan on trying it with lots of other cake mix flavor/mix in combinations. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was looking for something quick to send with my daughter to a sleepover.  This was super easy and turned out excellent.  I did add 1/3 cup of water instead of the 2 tablespoons as suggested in other reviews because I was afraid it might be too dry.  It turned out perfect.  We will definitely make this again.

My friend's mother has a great recipe for chocolate chip bars that I couldn't find so I came on here to look. This isn't it because I remembered her recipe utilized oil and no additional sugar but this is fairly close. I made the modifications I could remember and used oil instead of butter (a little less than a half cup), chopped walnuts, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I baked for 20 minutes and they came out pretty darn close to my friend's mother's. With that said, I'm giving this 3 stars because a) other reviewers seem to also have their own version so this one can be that amazing and b) the additional sugar and bake time really confuse me. These bars are already very very sweet and at 20 minutes, mine came out perfectly cooked...I even thought about undercooking them next time to get them softer.

I made these last night as written and they turned out well. I baked for 35 minutes, but maybe should have taken them out at 30, as they are slightly crispy, especially the edge pieces. I used chocolate covered raisins, but am looking forward to making this again using different cake mixes and add-ins. I highly recommend this if you're baking with children - almost no mess; it's pretty much dump, mix and bake!

YUMMY!! Thank you so much. I had extra chips and this was perfect. Kids loved making them and everyone loved eating them. I actually had complaints that I didn't make enough. I did add the 1/3 cup of water and crushed walnuts. I also cooked for 30 minutes, they looked under cooked, but after they cooled they were perfect. Thank you

Made these for a few occasions...parties etc. and everyone loves them!  Taste like they are made from scratch and texture is just right, chewy and dense, with just a bit of crumble.  Used white cake mix and added butterscotch, semi sweet chocolate chips, and coconut to mix...baked in a dark pan.  Yums and so easy for moms with kids and hubbys who love a nice sweet now and then...and very economical esp if you buy the cake mixes on sale!

Great easy recipe! Tastes awesome! I used Pillsbury white cake mix with 2 eggs and 4 tbsp. of water as suggested in other reviews. I also used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of Reese's peanut butter chips. Very moist yummy cookie/cake bar. I was able to easily cut these into 1x1 inch squares.

Made in a bar pan from Target (Calphalon), and they were tasty.  You had lots of edges (which were the best part to us).  DH said they were like a chocolate chip cookie brownie.  Also, used 4 Tbsp. water and omitted the nuts (personal preference).  We like the mini-chips, too.  Giving it a 5 because it was SO easy for how good they taste :)

Pretty good.  I used a reduced sugar chocolate cake mix and added chocolate and butterscotch chips.  I omitted the brown sugar.  Also, I took other reviewers' suggestions and used two eggs and four tablespoons of water.  I was hoping for a fudgier consistency, but I would make these again.

These were kind of a disappointment, until I added the fudgy frosting.  I followed the recipe, it was underwhelming.  It might be better with a yellow cake mix, or even chocolate.  I might make these again with different cake mix and frosting.

I was low on time but needed a dessert for a party, and these turned out really well! I used butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, yellow cake mix, and the extra 2 tbsp of water that people recommended. Chewy and delicious. :)

Yummy recipe! I made this one because I was low on eggs, and it was soooo yummy! My kids loved them. I used a golden butter cake mix and added some chocolate chips and chopped pecans. I think I might try this one with a chocolate cake mix next time. :)

It was late and I was craving chocolate. All I had was cake mix, it was good! I wish I could have added chocolate chips. Used 1/3 c. water and baked for 21 minutes.

I thought these turned out great - plus they were very easy to make.  I used a yellow cake mix since I did not have a white one and did not use as many chocolate chips and nuts as called for (probably 1/3 c nuts and 3/4 bag of chocolate chips).  My husband liked them but said they were a little softer than he likes them, so I am sure I will be trying other recipes.
Last time I made them I added an extra egg, upped the water to 4 Tblsp.

I only had a cherry chip/white mix.  I put in white and chocolate chips.  I thought they were tasty, but they were very sweet with the cherry flavoring.  I didn't have any nuts either.

Blah... I have to say, these were the least favorite thing I've made from this site! I couldn't believe how they just totally fell apart. They also were, honestly, much too sweet even after reducing the chocolate by half!

This recipe is awesome! I made these this week to take to my bible study group. I used Duncan Hines Golden Vanilla cake mix and I used ground up pecans on top. Absolutely delicious! I did not bring a single piece home, and had to fight for my own taste!

Will definitely make again!

I'm rating these a 3 because everyone really liked them (my brother LOVED them) but I didn't care for them.  They were just too sweet for me and I love sweets.  If I make these again I don't think I'll add any extra sugar.

I make this with 1/4 cup water and 2 eggs.  Our favorite is low-sugar chocolate cake mix with choco-peanut butter morsels.  The batter is thick, but my family says they're the best brownies ever!

This recipe is GREAT!!!!  I just made these bars for the 2nd time.  The first time i used yellow cake mix and only had a large symphony bar on hand so i chopped that up and added it to the mix.  This time i used semi-sweet chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Also, i added 1/4 cup of water as suggested by others and two eggs.  They come out extremely moist and delicious!!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe...

I used yellow cake mix, 1/4 c of water (4 tbsp) and half white chocolate, half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Next time, I would use less chips - maybe 1.5 cups as the 2 cups called for in the recipe is a little overwhelming.  Also, I followed suggestions to bake this for about 22 minutes.  The bars were seriously underdone in the middle so next time I will probably bake it for about 30 minutes.  Other than that, this is a simple and delicious recipe!  Tastes like a cookie cake!

These turned out great. I used white cake mix and half milk chocolate chips. I only had a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk and it still turned out great. In appearance they reminded me off the Oat Fudge bar from Starbucks b/c I dropped the remaining batter in little spoonfuls so a lot more of the chocolate was showing. Very easy, will make again, great for when cake mixes are on sale! 
*Update - sorry! I rated the wrong recipe..."Can't Leave Alone Bars" from this site is what I made a rated...my apologies*

I like how versatile this recipe is... the first time, I made it as written except with yellow cake mix, 1/2 cup butterscotch and 1 cup semisweet chips.  The second time I used dark chocolate cake mix, the same butterscotch and semisweet mix, and applesauce in place of butter.  I actually liked the lower-fat version better.  Watch the cooking time though, 25 minutes is all you need, unless you want crunchy bars. :)  Oh, the first time I added 4 tbsp. water and I thought they were a little dry... 1/4 cup is perfect.

These were very easy to make, but mine were kind of like boring blondie brownies. I will probably try again with different combonations (I tried yellow cake mix with toffee pieces).

I used french vanilla pudding cake mix, a big handful of choc chips and one of mini baking m&m's and they were delicious!  I did not add extra water as noted below and baked for 31 min and they came out perfect.  Great recipe that I'm sure I will use again!

Great recipe.  Fast and easy, but the next time, I will add fewer chips and more nuts, maybe l 1/2 cups of each.  Also I will try it with raisins and nuts.

My family loved it.  They were moist and gone in 1 night.  I did add more water, but very happy with the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe many times with different cake mixes and different chips.  They do need 4 tablespoons water and you have to watch that you bake them just right or they get hard.  They are sure easy when you need something quick.

These were good.  I probably undercooked them a little(after reading reviews not to overcook).  I think they would be even better cooked a little longer.  I cooked them for about 25 minutes in a convection oven.  

I made two batches and used a yellow cake for one and a devil's food for the other.  Both turned out great.

Our church takes cookies to the rescue mission every month so it's nice to have new recipes to try.  This one was great because I already had all the ingredients at home.

Excellent recipe. It was so east to make. I used a chocolate cake mix and added dark chocolate pieces with raspberry creme (Hershey's). I added 4 tablespoons of water also.

I have made this several times and it always turns out wonderful.  I use yellow cake mix and add a little more water, though.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are good, but not awesome, I won't rush to make them again, but if I needed something for the bake sale and had cake mix on hand, I'd probably try again because of the convenience factor.

This was an okay recipe.  It has a different flavor, not bad, but not typical. It was very dense. It also made a TON of bars.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe. It had a very "from scratch" taste to it without all the hassle.  Next time I plan on trying it with a chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips for a yummy twist.

This was easy and good.  I added 4 tbs water and next time would only add 1 cup chocolate chips.
