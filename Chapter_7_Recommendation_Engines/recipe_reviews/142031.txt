Sometimes, we also add cilantro and green onions to the mixture before serving.

This is such a versatile recipe, you can add/modify/delete the ingredients but the premise is the same... I skipped the tomatoes as I was looking to make a salsa without them.  I used a dried, ancho chile pepper that I roasted a few minutes to soften, then ground it up (skipping the habanero as I didn't have one), I did not add the oil as you do not need it (IMO), served with homemade tortilla chips, awesome!

The recipe is easy to make and delicious. I would reduce the onion by half and double the peppers. I put everything through the food processor so it came out a lot thinner then pictured but it tastes amazing. Definitely a keeper.
