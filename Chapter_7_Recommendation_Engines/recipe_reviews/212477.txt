It has too much honey. We added 50% more butter and doubled the spice and real pumpkin and it had more of a buttery texture. 4 stars only with our modifications!

Delicious! I can't wait to serve this will rolls at Thanksgiving dinner! I do feel I should note this is SUPER sweet! If you're not into sweets or sweet butters, this will probably not be for you. It is just right for my family, though! It seems like a lot of honey, but the great amount of pumpkin pie spice evens it out. My family does not like a strong pumpkin flavor, so this had just the right amount of pumpkin that was not overpowering.

So easy and so delicious on a baked sweet potato. I let mine set for about 3 hours and it had great flavor. Can't wait to try this on a bagel in the morning!!

This was a good base recipe, but I ended up putting more like 1/2-3/4 of a cup of pumpkin and seriously upping the spices to get it to taste like anything other than straight honey butter (and it was still very solid after it cooled thoroughly in the fridge).  However, I got rave reviews after that, so I really appreciated being sent in the right direction!

When I saw the picture on the page for this recipe it appeared like piped whipped butter. I started by making a 1/2 recipe. The result was "pumpkin sweetened honey with some butter pieces in it." Then, I thought maybe it was supposed to be similar to apple butter or flavored honey? Either way, I didn't know how to use the concoction, so I attempted to fix it! In order to get a spreadable fluffy margarine or whipped butter like consistency the recipe would stay the same except the honey would have to be (1/4 cup or half) plus about 2 tsp extra approximately to get the desired sweetness. It will also have to be refridgerated in addition to harden. I am not sure how others did not have to adjust this and got a butter appearance & texture?

I used ICBINB spread, and all ingredients mixed together perfectly producing a light and fluffy texture.  I did think the pumpkin flavor was a little weak, so I added more pumpkin pie spice and canned pumpkin until it tasted right.  I chilled the butter a little bit and then piped it in different shapes onto a cookie sheet, froze them, and then transferred to a freezer bag.  This will make for a nice presentation on pancakes, corn bread, baked sweet potatoes (whatever) when I have out-of-town company visiting.

This was very very good!  I got a little nervous when mixing it because it looked curdled, but I kept mixing for some time and it finally came together and became smooth and yummy.  I used unsalted butter because I had a stick I needed to use up.  So I added a pinch of coarse sea salt at the end and it was perfect!  Has this on french toast.  Amazing

I made the mistake of not reading the directions and just adding everything together at once, which left me with a very unappetizing, clumpy mess. I redid it, whipping the butter and following the directions and it came out great!! To fix the first debacle I put it in the microwave so it would melt a little then whipped it. It was a little darker than the correct one but still tastes good!

It turned out very grainy and the honey kept seperating from the pumpkin and butter. The flavor was fine but it looked gross. It was nothing like the picture.

Tastes great but the texture is grainy.I added extra butter and pumpkin which helped. I think there's just too much honey.  Great flavor!

I liked this but there was way too much honey.  When I made it again, I just added to taste.

We stayed at a BnB that used a similar recipe for the English muffins in the morning.  We couldn't tell right away that it was a pumpkin taste, since it was so subtle, but that is what we liked about it. The owner of the inn told us it was pumpkin.  The texture is more like a flavored honey, rather than a whipped consistency, but that's exactly what we were looking for, so I'm glad that it didn't turn out the way the picture represents. :-)
