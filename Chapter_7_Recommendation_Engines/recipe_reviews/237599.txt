We loved in and thought it was great. I didn't have enough asparagus so I added fresh green beans and broccoli from our garden. I also used blue cheese, which is my favorite. The texture and the variety of taste is wonderful. The joining of mint and basil is the success of this dish. And just about anything will compliment this recipe. When we served this as leftovers we topped it with a sweet, Italian dressing that really set it off. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe as it is unlike the other reviewers. I love it just the way it is. Delicious. Only the food processing of herbs takes a little time.

Interesting flavors here. I didn't care for the cheese though. Without the cheese, for me, this is 5 stars. Add some hot peppers to give it a kick, you won't be sorry. Thank you for the recipe.

This was good.  I would probably make this without the pasta next time if I were to make it as a side dish again.  With the pasta, its more of a vegetarian meal.  You could also add chicken or shrimp to make it a main dish.  I think next time I will make more of a dressing to go with it - probably a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and maybe some minced garlic.  Tasty!

I made it as the directions stated and it was excellent! Will include it in my regular rotation if more vegetarian/plant-based meals.

Great, easy, light summer salad! It works nicely as a side dish and with the addition of chicken or other protein, itâ€™s a nice light supper.
