Didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown and added some extra brown sugar. I wasn't too big on the sauce after the ribs slow-cooked for a while, so I made a little of my own sauce to add to it, with some honey-bbq sauce, teriyaki, and brown sugar. After that, they came amazing. I had to cook them quite a bit longer in the slow-cooker, and on high, but they still came out really awesome. My family loved them. I give it 3 stars for giving me a good lead on what to do, and a perfect starting point. Also, I have the tendency to make every recipe into my own.

I wish I could be honest and say that this recipe was made exactly as shown... I had every intention of doing so - but my boyfriend is notorious for adding things while my back was turned (since he knows I freak out on him when I catch him).  He added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.  Well it was FANTASTIC!!! I couldnt wait until I made it again (with him NOT around to to tamper with the recipe)PROPERLY to rate, so it's a definite 5 and a suggestion to try it :) Thank you for the yummy recipe!

I rubbed a dry rub and refrigerated overnight, then followed directions as printed. They came out so tender and fall off the bones. Everyone loved them.
