One of my most favorite summer pies. We call this the Creamsicle Pie. I make my own crust out of cinnamon grahams. The orange zest is crucial. NOTE: You can use Splenda, lowfat cream cheese, SF pudding mix and FF whipped topping to cut back on the sugar/calories. There's really not a huge difference in taste.

Made this for Christmas dinner. Making it was effortless with the power mixer, and all three layers were delicious!

This is a great summer time recipe and so easy. My husband and I love it. Only change I'd make is add actual orange juice then juice from an orange... it will give a bit  stronger of an orange flavor.
