Ham and topping were very good but found it a little too sweet, I halved the apricot  preserves and used about a cup of the dijon mustard instead.  Also could have halved the recipe, it was a lot of topping.  But overall the was a very good recipe and everyone enjoyed it!!

This is very good! I have also used it on chicken. I haven't used the orange zest called for(no oranges). Still great. I 1/2'd the recipe.
