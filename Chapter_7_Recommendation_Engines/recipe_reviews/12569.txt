I loved this pie so much.  It's light, custardy and spicy.  Absolutely fantastic!  Very very easy to make.

My 93 year old mother-in-law grew up in rural Indiana. She lately started to talk about this pie, which I had never heard of. I used this recipe and she just loved it. Apparently it was very much like what she remembered eating 75+years ago. Thank you so much for posting this old recipe. It made her so happy!

This is not CHESS PIE.  Or maybe it is..  Chess custard pie.  This is the worst example of a chess pie i've ever seen.  It's just terrible.  It takes two pie crust to use all of the ingredients, and those need to be DEEP DISH.

This come out pretty good, but I did make some adjustments. It's very similar to my chess pie recipe and I knew that the 45 minutes wouldn't be enough time in the oven, so I lowered the oven to 300 and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours, the way my chess pie is done, and it came out beautifully. A 9" deep dish pie crust held it all nicely. For those who have had a problem with spilling the filling on the way to the oven; put the crust on a cookie sheet, set it on the oven rack and then pour the filling in, slide the rackin carefully. This prevents spills and catches any cook-over mess in the oven. This pie was very good, but I won't make it again. The taste is very, very close to a pumpkin pie - and I don't like pumpkin pie.

I have a version of this pie that has been handed down through our family, very similar, but ours is called Bob Andy pie. Very good recipe but it does almost take an hour to bake. And, no, it is not CHESS PIE by no means. One of my favorites!

This pie was OK.  Nothing to rave about.  Basically a custard pie,with a crunchy topwith a cinnamonish flavor.

Loved the pie, definitely reminds me of pecan pie without the pecans. Fits in a 9-inch pie crust, almost perfectly. I put the pie crust in another larger pan, while filling the crust and until the pie started to firm, otherwise it is hard to get it in the oven, without spilling. Thanks for the recipe, our family of 5, thought it was great!!

I had never made any kind of custard pie but was looking to try one. This pie is so different to anything i have ever had, it took much longer to cook than the directions given, the filling was liquid when put in the oven but then gets thicker and thicker until its a nice firm custard. I will definitly make it again, all my friends loved it because it was so different !

I liked this pie.  I had all the ingredients even though it was 3 days before grocery day.  Baked it 15 minutes longer than advised.  Great taste.  Took it to church social.  Really enjoyed it.

This recipe is somewhat similar to Transparent Pie, a popular pie in Northeastern KY. Delicious!

Pie did not cook in the recommended amount of time.  Took almost double the amount of time.  Pie was still runny.  I will not make this pie again.

I just had my first taste of this pie. Very good. Very easy to make. My pie shell held is all but I built-up the side. It also took a lot longer than expected, but I kept and eye on it and when a knife comes out clean it's ready to come out.  Do not cut until complete cooled.
