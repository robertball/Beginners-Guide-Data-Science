This was a pain to make, but they tasted wonderful!!! I followed the recipe and ingredients exactly except for scaling it down to 8 servings (per the scale by the recipe ingredients). The orange juice/chia seed mixture never did gel, and I let it sit for maybe 30 minutes. Perhaps it needed to be room temp? When I added the liquid, the dough never made a ball or stuck together, so I dumped it out and added just enough flour to make it hold together and allow cutting into 8 pieces. I figured the scones would be hard and not sweet enough, but they were perfect. Light and perfectly sweetened! I made an orange glaze to drizzle on top of some of the scones...a perfect complement to the gingerbread flavor! This is one of my favorite tasting scones now. I'm going to have to perfect my skill in making them. Let's hope I can duplicate what I did this time.

I live in a small town and don't have immediate access to coconut butter. Will it still taste the same if I use just dairy butter?
