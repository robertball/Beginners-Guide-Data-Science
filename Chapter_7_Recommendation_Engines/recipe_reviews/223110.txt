This is a fantastic recipe as is, but I made some modifications over time that I think makes it a lot better. Give it a try, it's easy.
1 - Replace 1 c water with 1 c dry white wine.
2 - No angel hair pasta at all. Instead, add 1/2 box linguine to the tomatoes etc. sauce and let it soak up the yummy sauce as it cooks. When the linguine is getting close to done, add the shrimp.
3 - Enjoy! Love this stuff. (New Years Resolution is to reduce the butter/olive oil in it and still keep the flavor.)

This tasted a lot like something you would get at a restaurant.  I made only a couple changes for our tastes - I reduced the olive oil and butter just a little and used sun dried tomatoes in olive oil (I drained them before using).  This is awesome with a piece of herbed cheese bread on the side.

We liked this.  I would have preferred that the sauce be a little thicker as the pasta just tended to swim in it.  Next time I will thicken up the sauce.  Thanks for posting.

Really enjoyed this. I found the recipe confusing. I wish the directions included the amounts so one didn’t have click back to the ingredients to to know how much of the ingredient is to be added. Also I added a bit of White Wine and some of the Beth used.

We really loved this. I scaled it back for two people and still had leftovers. I used a can of diced tomatoes because I didn’t have stewed. I added 8 oz of angel hair spaghetti to the sauce to cook. I had to add another cup of water to make enough liquid. The next time I will use two cans of tomatoes in the sauce and two cups of broth to soak the sun dried tomatoes.  At the end I threw in a handful of shredded cheese just because I had it. I believe it was Monterey Jack and Colby. Good stuff and easy to make.

Love love this recipe. I did reduce the chicken broth I added by 1/2 and added tomato paste as I do like a thicker sauce but everything else was awesome.

Made this tonight and the sauce is fabulous. The next time I make it I will do it meatless and with linguine noodles.

This dish was amazing.  I don't like heavy tomato sauces and I was happily surprised.  This dish is very light but filling.  The only change I made was using 2 cups of chicken broth (low sodium) instead of the water.  This is a keeper for sure

I don't know why more people haven't reviewed this recipe. I agree that you should replace 1 cup water with white wine and angel hair pasta will soak up the sauce. My husband said "This is better than any restaurant meal I have ever had." It is fanstastic.

This was absolutely amazing! I had sun-dried tomatoes in oil, so I used them, instead of the dry ones. My son brought me a lobster from Gloucester, Ma, fresh from the ocean, so we steamed and picked it and added at the last minute along with the shrimp.

This was terrific! I used diced fire roasted tomatoes in place of the stewed; we like spicy. A simple and quick dinner that everyone loved.

The ingredients were great but we reduced the volume of the liquids. It turned out well and was a big success with guests
