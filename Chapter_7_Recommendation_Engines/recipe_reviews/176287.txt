I'm the original poster of this recipe. Growing up on a pear farm, I looked forward to my mother making this every fall with fresh, ripe pears. Make sure the pears you use are VERY ripe. If not, boil them a bit before using in the pie. Delicious!

This pie was outstanding!  I would boil the pears for a bit prior to adding to the mix as they were a little crunchy next time.

This is one of the best pies I have ever tasted!  The sour cream really adds such a unique flavor to the fruit.  I only had 2 pears so I also used some G. Smith apples which worked fine.  The topping is to die for and stays in it's place instead of being loose and falling off. Excellent and I will use this recipe often.

This pie is amazing, i have a friend who makes it amd they add something special to the top, you boil, 1/2cup white sugar, 1/2cup brown sugar, 1/2cup butter, 1/2cup whipping cream, you heat the sauce a little and drizzle over the pie it is incredibly good.

I'm not a pear lover-- but my boyfriend is, so I made this pie for him. I followed the recipe's directions however, I used an extra pear. I also added more sugar and cinnamon to the streusal topping which I felt it needed. I suggest using an egg white wash ont he crust (I used a frozen pie crust) because the base was a bit soggy. Other than that, my boyfriend and neighbor (who had two pieces) absolutely loved it. Plus, it looks great too!

This pie is good. The only changes I made was that I added some cinnamon and salt into the crumb topping. Easy and yummy.

This pie is EASY and wonderful.  Fresh, mildly tart yet subtle and sophisticated... I really like the flavors and the texture.  I also like that nobody is going to expect this pie. Bring it out for a nice surprise on any special occasion, or no occasion whatsoever!

WOW!  Despite the reviews, I really did not believe something so simple could be so good -- it is fantastic!  As per some other reviewers, I added cinnamon to the topping.

I'm always on here and never rate. So that should tell you how good this pie is. I followed the recipe and added lemon juice to the pears and lemon zest to the filling. I arranged pears decoratively on top to make it pretty. The flavors are amazing!!!! I will be making this for future parties.

This was a great recipe to use my VERY ripe pears! It wasn't too sweet and was very creamy.  I did, however, have to use a sour cream substitute of 7/8 cup buttermilk with 3 tablespoons butter, which I did melt and then mix with the buttermilk. My husband thinks it was better with the buttermilk, but he also is not a fan of sour cream - and I am! I look forward to having enough sour cream to use the next time! Thank you for the recipe!

The flavor was good, but it was crunchy. My husband loved it anyway. I precooked the pears but not enough b/c they were still quite hard. It's my photo of the slice on the yellow and green plate. Next time I will precook the pears much longer.

Amazing! I can't believe I made this.  I would order this in a restaurant.  Followed the recipe  as is.  The oatmeal topping is a nice touch compared to just a flour butter sugar crumb topping.  I have printed multiple copies for future generations.

This is a good pear pie.  It is.  Even though there is sour cream in it, it isn't all that creamy - as in rich tasting.  It's still light with pear being the star.  The ripeness of the pears were the type that when you peel them, they're wet - not dripping, soft wet; but slippery.  I used one additional pear, 1/4" slices.  This pie has the sweetness level of the pears - so woo-hoo a low sugar dessert that's good!  Woo-hoo!  :D  I didn't make the crumble topping since planned to make the caramel drizzle listed in a review.  'Still a pretty pie though.  Mine too 15 - 20 minutes more.  I'm thinking with it being such a wet pie, the temp should be higher.  I thought about upping it, but didn't.  No big deal, but I will next time.  I'm thinking of peaches, instead of pears, with raspberry sauce next summer!  Mmmmm!  :)

I did not have a pie plate handy.  I used a 2 qt oblong casserole dish.  My pears were very ripe, so no par boil required.  I followed the instructions exactly with no alterations.  WOW.  Flavor is amazing!  I will be making this next Sunday to take for 'dinner on the grounds' at our church. Thank you Therapflu for such a fabulous recipe!

This pie is really good. I realized that I forgot the flour in the custard part and it still worked. I used a half a lemon on top if the pears while I put the crust together. I par baked the crust for about 10 minutes. I also used almond extract as well as vanilla. I made in a rectangular Pyrex pan. I used brown sugar in the topping instead of white. Yum yum.

This pie is awesome! My pears were on the verge of rotting so I was scared they were gong to be mealy/mushy after being cooked but they weren't (I left the slices fairly thick to further prevent this)! There are some awesome flavors going on in this pie.

This pie was sensational!  Most loved at my Thanksgiving dessert table.  I did add cinnamon to the sour cream mix and I put the oatmeal crumble I use for apple crisp on the top.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.  I always have all of these ingredients on hand , so it will go on my list if I ever need a quick dessert!

This is my first review on allrecipes :) This pear pie turned out really great. I also made the pie crust and just a tip, go with a traditional safe butter crust for this pie. The flavors are too delicate for it to be overwhelmed by any flavors in the pie crust (I used bacon grease and butter, next time I will only use butter). I would highly suggest you wait until the pears are VERY ripe as the original poster said...I didn't wait, and I should have. It just helps with the texture of the pie to be soft and easy to cut with a fork or spoon. Anyway, great flavors, the topping and sour cream custard add something very unique with the pears. The flavors go very well together. Will recommend, but with an all butter crust and when the pears are very ripe. Good thing I still have extra pears! I served it with plain homemade whipped cream :) Would be great with vanilla ice cream! (Oh and I replaced white sugar with brown in the topping and added some cinnamon!)

Wonderful recipe!  I made individual mini pies but followed the recipe and took the advice of boiling the pears first since they weren't that ripe...perfect!

This is a very good pie and very easy to make. I liked the taste quite a bit but I gave it four stars because it needed something-more spice, more cinnamon, something to give it a kick into amazing. Also the crumble topping was excellent.

My husband made this pie after the neighbor talked about a pear pie.  We didn't have sour cream so he used Greek plain yogurt instead.  It was great !  High complements to my husband and the provider of the receipt.
