These are so rich and yummy -- and very easy, actually. Have a friend whose staple dessert is pecan pie -- and now I see why, the basic filling is both easy and impressive. I used butter instead of margarine, of course. Not sure butter was soft enough to fold into cake mix, but it all turned out OK. I ended up adding about 8-10 minutes to the second round of baking to get a nice browning on the top. Only other change was that I used about 1.5 cups of pecans just because I had them and because it looked a little sparse with just a cup. Personal preference, really. Would have probably had more of that pecan pie gelatinous feel if without the extra nuts. Advise waiting until these are really cool before cutting. I tried to cut them into bars when they were warm and they're just too sticky. They cut fine once they cooled, though. Also advise cutting into SMALL pieces. These are very rich. My edges got kind of hard and chewy, too -- not sure you can avoid that really -- but I like those pieces best. Will definitely make these again.

Very easy to make, the only tough part is waiting for them to cool. You must wait until they are cool in order to cut into neat squares, if not they fall apart. I did add an additional 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips. Everyone loved them, even the ones that claim they don't like nuts. This is a keeper and feeds a large crowd since they are so rich a little goes a long way.

These are probably my most requested dessert. Be sure to bake them until the center will no longer move when you shake the pan. Let them cool completely or you will have a mess! They always turn out great and they are SO easy!

The taste is wonderful. I found the bottom layer of cake a bit hard to spread evenly, but not too bad..

Easy and tasty!  I brought it for Thanksgiving.  We had several pumpkin pies and apple pies.  Having the choice of a "bite" of pecan pie was a great hit after a huge meal, but wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it flavor! I got many raves. Brought it to our office potluck just before Christmas and there was nothing left after 20 minutes!

Fantastically delicious!  Was surprised how the two layers join together when baking the second time.  Would recommend cooling the bottom layer 5 minutes before pouring on top layer.  I poured mine the moment it came out of oven and it ripped into the bottom layer.
  Very good though!!!!!

This is the most delicious (and probably the least healthy) recipe on this website.  I've made this quite a few times now, and I'm getting better at it.  Bake the bottom layer for only 15 min, or until solid, just don't overcook it.  Oh, and don't be afraid that it's so tough to spread over the bottom of the pan; it's meant to be that way, and you haven't done anything wrong.
IMPORTANT:  These WILL come out gooey.  I ALWAYS cook them a day ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight BEFORE cutting them up.  You can also use just 1 cup of corn syrup without much difference to the recipe.  This way, you use exactly half of a bottle of Karo Dark Corn Syrup (8 oz = 1 cup).  But still, the full amount will give you the full experience of these bars :)

Mmmm.  I used butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow and I believe this made them even more d-lish!  Yes, the bottom crust was difficult to spread and pat into the pan but it did work.  I allowed mine to cool some before I put the filling on top.  The filling wasn't done in 35 minutes.  As every oven temp differs, mine took 45 minutes until the center no longer jiggled when I shook the pan.  I took the advice of others and allowed it to cool then I put them in the fridge over night to harden some so it can cut easier as they are gooey/creamy in the midddle (yummy). A very good peacan bar.  THX

These are good, very rich.  More like a blonde brownie with pecans on top rather than a pecan pie.  My daughter loves pecan pie and these were a big hit for here.  I put one Tablespoon of vanilla instead of 1 teaspoon and added my secret pecan pie ingredient...1 Tablespoon of bourbon!

Something is missing from this recipe. I have tried to make it twice now and the crust or whatever you pat in the pan and bake for 15-20 mins is pure glue, I followed it exactly using Imperial margarine with one egg and cake mix (minus the 2/3 cup reserved cake mix), It still didn't work!

These were so easy and so very good!! Make sure you coat the pan really well or they will stick!  after the pan cooled, I put it in the freezer to help firm up the bars a bit and they were great frozen too.

I have made this recipe several times in the past, and even traded pecans for raisins... makes it almost like one giant butter tart.  A great recipe!

One of the best 'bars' I've ever made. Similar to cream cheese bars but better! Easy, quick, moist, chewy, rich but not too sweet. A keeper! These bars will become a regular at holiday gatherings.

Very good.  They do, indeed, taste like pecan pie to me.  For whatever reason, I am not the biggest fan of sweet stuff, but I love pecan pie, and these are excellent and easy.  I used white cake mix bc I didn't have yellow, and I used 1 1/4 c of brown sugar with about 3 or 4 tbspoons of water to achieve one cup of dark corn syrup.  I did add a bit more brown sugar and water since this recipe called for a bit more than 1 c of corn syrup.   I was making other cookies at the time that called for a 375 oven, so I used that and just monitored very carefully.  The temp was just fine; was done in about 30 minutes.  I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it is important to make sure that the cookies are no longer jiggly before pulling out.  They are very gooey and rich but hold together well.  Very easy and very good.  I put them in the refrigerator prior to attempting to cut. My only complaint is that I used my pizza cutter to cut them and managed to break the pizza cutter in the process.  However, it was a cheap pizza cutter and I do have another, so very little damage was done.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a must have in all recipe boxes. Better than pie! What a wonderful and chewy taste in every morsel. I shared this recipe with a neighbor and this has now become her FAVORITE of all desserts.  My only substitute in this recipe was using Almonds rather than Pecans only because I had no pecans on hand.

These were great bars!  They tasted great and were hard to stay away from.  Only has one problem...turned out a little too "gooey" and didn't stay together very well.  Almost "too buttery" looking, but GREAT tasting!

Super easy.  Definitely recommend putting in 1.5-2 cups pecans on top.  Don't beat the first ingredients like I did the first time, instead stir together and mash into pan. Cooled 15 min between 2 steps and it was good.

Didn't have enough of the bottom layer to spread over the cookie sheet so i transplanted it to a smaller pan figuring I'd just bake it a little longer because it was thicker. The outer edges came out burt but the middle was fine. Maybe if I double the recipe and use a regular pan at the same time/temp it would have been better, not sure.... BUT I did manage to cut away the outer layer to sample a few bites and it TASTED really good....

I made these for Thanksgiving 2011 and my family absolutely loved them! These delicious and chewy bars are a great alternative to the traditional pecan pie.

Very good, followed the directions exactly and turned out great.  Made them for Thanksgiving instead of the Pecan Pie.  Definitely served more than a pie would have.

Made these bars for Thanksgiving, and they were a huge hit!  I think that they would be especially good with some vanilla ice cream on top.  My only issue was that the bars at the edges of the pan were a little bit too tough.  But all in all, a definite keeper!

A few tips: generously spray your hands with butter cooking spray and you can easily pat down the dough without it sticking to your hands. Also tried this with a rubber spatula, but just prefer to use my hands. Also, I can't find a cake mix in my grocery store anymore that's 18.25 oz. The largest I could find was 16.25 oz. Still measure out the 2/3 cup for the filling and use the remaining cake mix for the crust. It is a bit thinner. Delicious!

The recipe was awesome! I doubled the amount of nuts on top. I was a little confused about how much cake mix to use because the recipe says 1 box and then it also says 2/3 cup of cake mix. I used 1 box only and then reserved the 2/3 cup of cake mix.

Totally love this recipe! I've made it MANY times (for Thanksgiving AND Christmas) and it's ALWAYS a huge hit!! My Aunt (who is a MAJOR league accomplished baker) asked me for the recipe!!! There are some reviews stating that something with the crust is amiss.  My suggestion is to make it EXACTLY as it states - with butter!  This is NOT a "healthy" dessert, so if that's what you're looking for, you might want to skip this one and keep looking instead of making alterations and then giving it a bad review (not fair in my opinion).  Anyway.... :)  The only suggestion I have is to make sure that the crust is nice and golden and then wait five minutes after you take it out of the oven and then pour the other ingredients on. Other than that, a fantastic recipe! :)

Very easy to make...I wouldn't bake the cake part in the beginning quite as long because the bottom was a little tough, but overall very tasty recipe.  I will make this again.

Disappointing.  These taste okay but the texture is very cake-like, not like a bar at all.  The "crust" is very difficult to spread out and they turned out very sticky and gooey.  I won't make them again - other non-cake mix pecan pie bars are much better.

Awesome recipe!  I made for Thanksgiving, and everybody loved them.  I am not a fan of pecan pie - too sugary, too gooey, too rich - but the bars have the same flavor and are just right.  I used more like 3 cups of pecans - just coated the top until it looked thick and good.  Turned out really well, I'd recommend it - I can't imagine them with only 1 cup of pecans.

I would give this 50 STARS if I could.  I'm not even a big Pecan Pie fan but it's my husbands favorite and for his birthday I thought I'd give this a try (he hates cake). This recipe was simple enough so I thought I'd give it a try.  I made it exactly as written and it was DELICIOUS!  I froze it for about an hour after cooling it from the oven and it cut into bars fairly easily. If the pan makes it through the weekend I will be very suprised!!!

Can I just say Oh My GOODNESS! This was wonderful! I loved these and I am not a huge fan of pecan pie. I made these for Thanksgiving Dinner and I had to hide them so that we would have some left over after the Turkey!! Great!

I was very disappointed with this recipe... did not like the yellow cake mix taste. I'll stick with the regular pecan pie from now on.

I will absolutely make this again!  I used to have a very similar recipe but I lost it, so I was very excited to find this one.  I took these to a potluck and not only did they all get eaten, but I had several requests for the recipe!

Everyone loved these. It’s like a tasty dessert bar or a rich bar you can have with coffee in the morning. Easy to prepare. Do be sure to grease and flor the pan. Also it is hard to spread the bottom layer because it’s so sticky. I? stuck mine in the fridge for 5-10 minutes and it was easier to work with. These bars will be made again and again.

This recipe is just ok. The cake mix tast was a little overwhelming. Also, needs more pecans.

These taste delicious but I have made them four separate times and have had pretty inconsistent results. Sometimes I have to substitute maple syrup or sugar and water for the corn syrup if I am out, (1 c. sugar + 1/4 c. water = 1 c. corn syrup) and I'm not sure if that is the reason for the differences. They come out really dark brown, almost looking burnt but are still incredibly sticky and falling apart. I could leave them to bake longer than suggested but then I think they would burn. At any rate, they still taste good whether they are falling apart or holding together. Everyone loves them!

Great tasting bars. I ended up using about a cup and a half of pecans to cover the top better. These were very easy to make.

This was amazing. My father LOVED it and so did my brother, he wanted to bring an extra batch to work but...they ate them before he could bring them. I'm going to be making them for my family for many more occasions to come. The only thing I did different was to make home-made sugar syrup (i didn't have any dark corn syrup).
