Nice change!  I made my own honey mustard (about half and half) and less vinegar.  Will definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful side dish!  I really like the way that it could work with so many different main dishes and the next time that I go to a potluck dinner I am going to bring this.  It is VERY simple and quick to make.  If you are always in a hurry like me, then it is the side dish for you:)!!!  I did add one-two pieces of bacon that have bn. fried and then crushed up.  I guess that you could also add bacon bits to this right before you serve it versus the crumbled up bacon.

Very, very tasty, and quick, too.  I only used about a teaspoon of oil- it didn't need more than that.

I liked this quite a bit. As per other reviews, I cut back the vinegar and oil to 1 T each. This was a nice treatment for beans and I may try it with other veggies as well.

This was delicious, like my mom's recipe I couldn't find!  I made it for a potluck and it disappeared!  My poor husband didn't get any at all!  It is a keeper!  I will have to compare this to my mom's recipe.  I know my sister has it somewhere!

This recipe is super quick and easy! You should have everything already on-hand! I made it to accompany a Honey-baked Ham and everyone loved them!  People ate them all (with hands, like french fries) before the meal was even served!

Good- I used 1 lb. of green beans. I also used freeze dried chives.(heaping T.) We like our green beans kinda soft- so I cooked em longer. Also didn't do the ice water thing. Just tossed the other ing. in after cooking & draining. Maybe a little too much vinegar. This is a small serving size as well. Low carb & low cal!

This recipe was pretty good, but I think the ratio of oil and vinegar to honey mustard needs to be changed up a bit--the flavors of honey and mustard were really nice with the beans, but were a bit too subtle with all the oil and vinegar.  Next time I make this I will probably halve them.  All in all, a good, simple, different way to make green beans rather than just with bacon and onion.  I didn't have chives for this recipe, but instead just used ultra-thin slices of white onion that I tossed with the beans.  I then just microwaved them with the sauce and onion for about 1 minute which caramelized the sauce a little and that worked well.  I served this with steamed salmon--yummy combo.

I tried this recipe as it's written, but after tasting it I added another TBSP of classic yellow mustard and a little sweetener (about 1/2 tsp) to taste and it was delicious!

I'm not a green bean fan to begin with.  So I thought maybe adding a little something to them might help me like them better.  Wow, overpowering vinegar in this recipe.  The good news is, I didn't know I was eating green beans!!!  I won't be making this again.

A unique change for green beans, just not our taste.  I will try again using white wine instead of vinegar and add some garlic.

Tasty recipe and easy to make.  Great for a low-cal diet; the flavor reminds me of potato salad!

I liked this, but the rest of the family said they could leave it.  I like mustard and it shines thru in this dish.  Just ok.

Not my favorite recipe for green beans, but a nice change of pace nonetheless. I'll hang on to the recipe to add variety in the summer when I love to eat beans a lot.

I didn't really like it (I think it's because I don't like oil-based toppings very much) but my husband and kids gobbled it up.

I just wasn't that into this recipe. The beans and sauce didn't seem to blend together well.
