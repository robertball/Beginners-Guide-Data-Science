My kids made these as a Christmas Eve appetizer when they were younger. We cut each piece of dough into 5 pieces, and usually only need to use one pkg of crescent rolls that way. Less bread too. We like to dip them in honey mustard sauce.

I've been making these since 1985 - I have an old "Great Crescent Creations" booklet. These are never fail, and always gone way too fast!

I have been making the mummy dogs for 2 Halloweens now and wanted to try the little smokies this year. They were very tasty but harder to roll the dough around. Next time I will make these for Christmas as directed and leave the mummy dogs recipe for hot dogs.

Kids' favorite! Makes a lot for a home meal, though. I use 1 can crescents, half the sausages, and freeze the rest of the sausages for next time, although you could probably freeze these after baking as well. Lots of variety in the dips-bbq, honey mustard, etc., and can vary the filling--throw in a bit of cheese, jalapeno, or use mini hot dogs. Easy and fast, great for weeknight meal, and my daughter enjoys helping to make them. Great recipe!
