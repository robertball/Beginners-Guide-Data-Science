Ganache recipes can vary greatly in chocolate to cream ratios - this version falls somewhere in the middle and is great! To simplify the process, I chop the chips in my food processor until they resemble fine crumbs. Then I heat the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it just starts to bubble around the edges, pour the hot cream down the feed tube of the food processor, and give it a whirl... in seconds you have wonderful ganache. I should mention that chocolate chips contain stabilizers that allow the chips to keep their shape while warm, and those stabilizers don't melt down smoothly like chocolate does, so for a smoother finished product, I strain the warm ganache through a fine mesh strainer (this is not a necessary step, but will give more professional results). Use this ganache warm as a pourable glaze, let it cool to room temp (over night) and use like a standard frosting, or chill until firm and whip with a heavy stand mixer until it's lighter in color and spreadable. You can even use this ganache to make authentic chocolate truffles - just roll the chilled ganache (unwhipped) into balls and coat with cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or whatever. One more helpful hint: if you use this ganache to "frost" a cake, make sure the cake is brought to room temp before you try to cut it (using a hot knife). For added depth of flavor, try adding some liquor, vanilla, brewed coffee, or even coffee powder into the warm ganache mixture.

Good stuff.  I was looking for a chocolate filling to use in a layer cake and appreciated the tip that you could whip ganache to transform it into filling.  I found the ratio of chocolate to cream to be a bit high for a cake filling, so I added extra cream to yield a creamier texture.  The result was a truffle-like filling.  Delish!  It's been said before, but do buy the best bittersweet chocolate you can.  I used standard bittersweet baking squares and found I had to add a few tablespoons of powdered sugar to cut down on the bitterness.   This basic recipe lends itself to personalization, whereby you could play with different flavored extracts to customize a flavor.  But it's great as is!

This is the only recipe you need for ganache.  I have also decreased the amount of chocolate to 6oz to drizzle it over a bundt cake.  If you don't have bittersweet chocolate, chips work well too!

This is the recipe I use for all my ganache needs. Like the author says, it's very versatile. By changing the temperature (melting or cooling,) you can change the consistency of the ganache. I have mixed it with whipped cream for a quick mousse, used it to mask and glaze a cake, and even piped roses with it! If you use the best quality chocolate, it will make any event special.

This is a very simple recipe, but yields an incredibly delicious topping with many uses.  I made chocolate sheetcakes for our daughter's wedding, and used this as the frosting (no boring white cake for her!).  It was delicious and elegant. Be aware that ganache is meant to be less sweet than regular frosting; using milk chocolate does not result in a true ganache flavor. This is a recipe for true lovers of dark chocolate.

First time I've made ganache, and it was perfect. I used semisweet instead of bittersweet chocolate, simmered the (whipping) cream just a little longer (1 minute, with only tiny bubbles staying around the edges and watched like a hawk), poured over the chocolate and let it sit about 5 minutes, then slowly stirred until blended, to avoid bubbles. This can take a while. It was pouring consistency after about 15 minutes and held its shape well over the Double Chocolate Brownie bundt cake from this site. Beautiful sheen, tastes like hot fudge, in fact we reheated the leftovers in a microwave (carefully) and poured some over vanilla ice cream. The recipe makes quite a bit, I had at least 1-1/2 cups leftover. Solidified like fudge in the fridge. Will try it with white chocolate next time. Now in my recipe box!

Very Nice, This is a great recipe, easy, quick and is a big hit w/ all everytime. A little hint though, whatever you do make sure that it is completely cooled before frosting!

Great glaze. I put in a dollop of corn syrup to make it shiny. It gets hard in the fridge, so don't refrigerate if you are using it the same day. Tasty on ice cream too...REAL tasty.

This can't be this good - it was too easy to be this good! And I didn't even use a high quality chocolate, just Ghiradelli chocolate chips.  (In all honesty, I didn't want to waste expensive chocolate to frost the zucchini cupcakes I made in case I didn't like them...)  I made the ganache a couple of hours in advance of the cupcakes, stirring it every now and then.  By the time the cupcakes were baked and cooled the ganache was just the right consistency to spread.  Ganache is, of course, always chocolate and cream but I liked the ratio of cream to chocolate in this recipe.

Best ganache recipe on allrecipes, in my opinion.  Use best quality chocolate and chop it up with your chef's knife.  All that's necessary is to add the "hot" cream, and stir.  If you tweak the chocolate ratio and even add favorite liqueur, this will make decadent truffles.  I love a touch of amaretto.  I chill the ganache, roll quickly into balls and roll in deep bowl of cocoa powder.  Yum.

Perfect measurements!  I took another reviewer's advice and put the chocolate in my food processor to chop then poured the heated cream into the processor while it was running.  It was smooth and delicious with just the right consistency.

This simple recipe sure does deliver.  Follow the directions and make sure you DO babysit the heating cream.  If you don't keep stirring, it can burn.  Even doubled this recipe works well.  I dipped some cupcakes right away and put the rest of the ganache away to cool.  A few hours later, I whipped the part of the batch I refrigerated and it worked well as a frosting.  Could be used as a cake filling, too!  Delish!

don't use chips and then try to make truffles with this recipe- didn't set- ever.  My own mistake- didn't know chips have something in them to keep their shape- obviously that means it won't set.  I'll try this again with ghiradelli squares instead of chips.

This worked out very well. I used 12oz of Ghirardelli semi-sweet morsels and 8oz Toll House semi-sweet morsels to get to the 1 1/4lb and it was very tasty. I used it to cover a cake and used the remainder mixed with whipped cream to decorate the cake. Also added 1tblsp of corn syrup to add a bit of gloss to the ganache.

Great recipe, thank you for sharing! I had never made ganache before but with this recipe and the great tips from a few reviews I had no problem at all. I used white chocolate and put gel food coloring in it after all the chocolate was melted and it turned out beautifully.

I used this ganache as the 1st layer in a no-bake cheesecake with a graham cracker crust.  Perfect!  And very easy to make.  I can't believe something so decadent is this simple.

This was a delicious ganache! Great for people who love high quality frosting's and fillings not too sweet and very rich, but beware very expensive to make because of the fine chocolate. One fourth of a pound I spent alone twenty dollars!!! But still a very good ganache.

Very simple way to make an elegant glaze or coating. I used only white chocolate, a 7.5 oz bar from Aldi and 3/4 cup of heavy whipping cream.After the cooking process, I let it sit for a couple hours. Before I whipped it I poured a first coating on my little cakes to seal. I then refrigerated the cupcakes till hard. I then whipped the ganache and when the thickness I was looking for was achieved, I coated the cakes. It's delicate and rich tasting. This is great.

I used this ganache to ice cupcakes for a baby shower, and it was perfect. I iced with a thin layer of ganache, then whipped the remaining ganache into a mousse and piped a generous dollop on top of each one. Very delicious, and elegant. I'll never by overpriced cupcakes again!

I love this easy and quick ganache! I have spread it ontop of dense chocolate tortes and cakes and love the satiny shine it has. I also have spread it ontop of an icecream cake and sprinkled sprinkles on top!

Very good, very easy.  I used it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site.  Makes a pretty big batch, probably 1/3 batch would have been plenty for the Bundt style cake.

This has a wonderfully mild flavor. Not sickening sweet. I pored it over the beet bunt cake on this site. I didn't let it get firm enough, but tasted like a mild fudge sauce. Maybe adding a bit of powder sugar would help or making it ahead of time more.

Was very easy to make- I didn't particularly like the bitterness of it so I will try a different chocolate next time.  Also, I must have overwhipped it (used it for a filling) because it became very crumbly and dry in my cake. :(  Good recipe though- I'll try it again sometime.

Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for!  Also, I used about half fancy chocolate and half chocolate chips, and still, like I said...perfect!

Unfortunately, I didn't have as much success as the previous reviewers.  I only let the ganache cool to room temperature and my cake split into three pieces!  A complete disaster.  I will, however, try again and cool it in the refrigerator.  I think I will try milk chocolate as I found the bittersweet to be a bit heavy tasting.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOO EASY!!!!!  To be honest, I forgot to buy bittersweet chocolate at the store, so I had to use milk chocolate instead, and it still tasted GREAT on the cake I used it on!!!!!

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead and the ganache turned out beautiful! It went perfect with the Black Magic Cake. A huge success!!!

wow..I've never made Ganache before and this was so easy and came out great. I added a little sugar (2tbs or so) just to take the bite off the semi sweet chocolate. I cut it to 8 servings for a pie but it was still too much so I'll just have to make another sweet treat this week :)

This ganache is simple (as ganache is) and amazing. I made this last weekend to use on a cake it almost did not make it to the cake it was so good. I recommend using ghirardelli chocolate (pakage marked 70% coco). I found this a little cheaper then some other options and it was amazing. I also recomend making extra this recipe covered two 9" round cakes and put a nice layer between but would have been nice to have a little more on the cake.

I am a beginner with ganache and it came out fantastic. I tried it with milk chocolate to try and make a fluffy milk chocolate for the kids, and failed horribly I will keep looking for a recipe for milk chocolate the is fluffy like the whipped ganache.

I very much liked this ganache. The taste is terrific. It’s perfect for icing a cake. However, it was very loose. I was looking for something to make truffles. Truffles require a higher chocolate ratio than this. Excellent ganache, as long as you know what you’re using it for.

I made this with Hershey's milk chocolate bars( because I had a large surplus - my son won 34 candy bars in bingo) exactly as the directions say and it was amazing!! It was liquid 3 hours later but after refrigerating overnight, it made the most amazing frosting!  It's so great that the whole family likes to walk by and take spoonfuls!!  It's Amazing and I can't wait to make it again!!!!

This was my first time making ganache, and I'll definitely make it again because it was easy and delicious. I didn't have heavy cream, so I used a cup of evaporated milk, a half a cup of almond milk, and a half a cup of milk. Also, I substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips. Even so, the end result was just perfect! Once cool, this could have been used as a half-inch thick brownie topper, but I used a pretty thin layer to cover a cake.

Wonderful and easy recipe! I have never made ganache before but was very pleased with how this came out. I did not change the recipe but will be using this through the holidays with some of the variations mentioned in other reviews.

I didn't have enough heavy cream to double this, so I one & a halved it (used 3 cups heavy cream and 30oz. chocolate). I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet morsels, knowing that they might not melt as well as baking chocolate. I did have tiny lumps, so I put it through a sieve and it was fine. I let the cream come just to a boil and after it was mixed, I covered it and let it sit over night, to use as a filling and frosting for a chocolate lover's cake. The sad part is, it didn't thicken to the consistency of peanut butter, like I needed it to. Next time I'll use a recipe with a chocolate to cream ratio of 2:1.

Yum, yum, yum!!  My first time to make ganache and I'm hooked!  I cut the recipe in half to frost 24 cupcakes.  So good and doesn't taste too sweet.
