This is a very good dish. I left out the salt and added a bunch of hot peppers. At 15 minutes, the breading was browned but the Brussels sprouts were still almost raw. I turned down the heat and cooked for another 10 minutes. At this point they were crisp but cooked. Thank you for the recipe.

I really enjoyed these as a change from steaming. I didn't shake these in a bag, I oiled them and seasoned them in the baking pan. I used parchment paper to line the pan, and I baked them at 375 for twenty minutes. They were perfect! We will definitely be having these again!

First let me tell you, neither my daughter or myself like brussels sprouts.  My sister loves them, so for her I made these!  We all ate them and had seconds!   I kid you not!!  Wonderful and so easy!
