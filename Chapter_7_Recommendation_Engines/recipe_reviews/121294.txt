An outstanding, perfect recipe resulting in an outstanding, perfect bread. I made no changes nor will I in the future. The bread is incredibly moist, with just the right balance of sweetness and tartness. I also like that the bread is not overburdened with additional spices, so  the fresh flavor of the rhubarb shines. The topping is sugary, delicately cinnamony, crackly good! (Tip: I have used this topping on other breads as well, particularly good with banana bread) This recipe, this bread, is one of the best reasons I can think of to grow or buy rhubarb.

This is the first All Recipes recipe I have ever rated less than five stars. I'm giving it three stars only because it can be repaired, otherwise I would have given it one.  The only thing I intentionally meant to change was to coat my rhubarb additional flour since it was home canned and was very wet.  The following changes were necessary in order to come up with two decent loaves of bread: (1) an additional 2/3c. flour was added because the mix was too wet (likely one of the reasons the previous reviewers keep mentioning that the bread is so dense).  (2) There's no way anyone can get a loaf of quick bread to rise properly on 1/2.t of baking soda (try adding two teaspoons of baking soda and one of baking powder, this will give the bread a proper lift and it will be light and airy, not brick-like).  (3)  Watch the baking time, my loaves were about to be too done at forty minutes(yes, my oven temp. is accurate). The streusel topping gave the bread a nice subtle sweetness and crunch (try adding more cinnamon).  This recipe has plenty of potential, but not as written.

This is amazing bread - it changed my life for the better! Thanks you! In an attempt to lower calories and fat, I used 1/4 oil and 1/3 applesauce instead of the 1/2 cup oil and I used 1 Tbsp vinegar and 1 c skim milk instead of the buttermilk. The bread came out perfectly and I'll be making this again for sure.

Very good, I took a loaf to work and it was gone before lunch time. I didn't change the recipe, but I did do my usual quick-bread specialty: after greasing the loaf pans I dusted them generously with cinnamon sugar. It makes the crust delicious and goes very well with the streusel topping.

I have no doubt this is absolutely delicious as written, but I did deviate a bit.  I used half whole-wheat pastry flour, 2 full cups rhubarb, and a cup of finely chopped pecans.  I also added more vanilla (always do!) and did not use the streusel topping to cut down on sugar a bit.  They turned out to be extremely tender and flavorful with a very nice nutty flavor.  Very lovely and a total hit with my family.  They didn't last long!

I live in Alaska, and I have tons of rhubarb growing in my garden.  I found this recipe last night because I didn't want the rhubarb going to waste.  I made the recipe as is and it was delicious!  It was so moist and it has so much flavor.  It came out of the oven so beautiful!  Thank you for the recipe!  When I have visitors, I am going to send them home with this rhubarb streusel bread.

This is the best rhubarb bread recipe my family has ever tried!  Two days after baking my first batch I had to bake a second double batch because it got eaten so quickly.  We even tried it warm with vanilla bean ice cream and it was incredible!!

This is a super moist bread. The topping is soooo good, and I like the little crunch that you get with it. Will definitely make again! UPDATE: Yesterday I made this with half white half wheat flour and it turned out great!

Loved this bread, to make it a little healthier I substituted applesauce for the oil. Changed the texture slighty, but not the taste.

Good, but probably won't make again.  It is tart on the bottom and sweet on top because of settling.

We omitted the salt. We added 1 tsp baking powder. We thought this needed more Rhubarb. Next time we will try adding another cup or so of rhubarb. For the topping we used 1/4 cup sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar. I baked this in a 13 x 9 pan for 32 minutes . We liked it .

This recipe is fantastic.  I usually alter recipes but I made this exactly as written and I am glad that I did. It is extremely moist and flavorful.  I intend to try this with apples this winter when I run out of rhubarb.  As my friend put it "This is just an all around awesome dessert bread!"

This made fantastic mini muffins! Followed the recipe exactly (but a little more rhubarb and cinnamon IN the batter). I put the topping on the muffins and baked for 9-12 minutes. This made 12 mini muffins and a 3x6 mini loaf. I did not find this batter too wet, nor was it too dense.

Absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe as written.  I made no changes and it is perfect.  Batter was nice and thick, I used fresh rhubarb from the garden.  The loaves rose beautifully with the 1 tsp of baking soda the recipe called for and I baked for aprox 50 minutes (my oven tends to run a little hot).  Thanks for the delicious recipe~~

Absolutely delicious!!! I used half almond extract and half vanilla. I only have 1 loaf pan so I baked this  in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 mins at 350 as recommended by some reviewers. Also had to sub margarine for the butter in the streusel topping as I was out. Worked great. Will definitely make this again. I used thawed frozen rhubarb and didn't bother draining. I had no problems with the batter.

Very good! The streusel topping was perfect and the bread baked up beautifully. I used an egg substitute powder because I was making these to give to my parents who do not eat eggs and it still baked wonderfully. I might add a few spices to the bread next time. Thanks :)

This is very, very good! I made it in a 9x13 pan, baked in 35 minutes.  I halved the sugar and oil, added buttermilk to replace the oil. Used half baking powder and half baking soda, I don't like the taste of baking soda. Doubled the cinnamon in the topping. Made 18 squares.

This was great! I had two rhubarb haters gobble it up. I did use whole wheat flour and made some other changes to make it healthier. Of course it would've been even tastier had I left it alone.

Excellent! Sweet, but not too sweet. Moist with a crispy topping. I forgot to add the pecans, but I definitley will put them in next time.  The only change I made was to use 2 cups of rhubarb instead of what the recipe called for. I baked both loaves for 60 minutes.

Absolutely perfect recipe...crisp on the outside, moist and great texture on the inside.  We used two 9x5 pans and baked for 45 minutes.  Will make this over and over again. (Be sure to use FRESH rhubarb, NOT canned.)

Perfect!  I made it as instructions and wouldn't change  a thing.  I only had skim milk in so couldn't make buttermilk from that, so I used FF evaporated milk - works just fine.

Everyone loved this bread. Easy to make and so delicious.  Only change I made was to use brown and white sugar in the topping and added a little more butter to topping mixture.

I don't normally cook with rhubarb, so perhaps I just got a bad/especially bitter batch of rhubarb, but I followed the recipe exactly and the bread turn out really  bad. The bread was so sour/bitter and the streusel top was way too sweet. The favors where so different that they couldn't balance each other out. The bread itself was a fine consistency and perhaps if it was made with another fruit instead of rhubarb it would probably be way better.

This was such a moist and flavorful loaf, will definitely make again. I used one 9x5 loaf pan cause i don't have two 8x4 ones, so i preheated to oven to 325 instead and it took about 1 hour 20 minutes to bake. The crust was perfect, not too brown, and the cinnamon sugar on top was just the right crunch. Definitely a keeper!

Good flavor, good texture. I added about 1/4 cup Brown Sugar to the streusel topping. I wouldn't change a thing. This recipe is going into my Box. Even my picky 4 yr. old granddaughter liked it. Thanks Irene.

I would not hesitate to make this again. This recipe is just about perfect. I used 2 cups of diced fresh rhubarb, and thought it was the perfect amount. I used half brown and half white sugar in the streusel. I didn't have any nuts and it is delicious without them, but I'm sure would be good with also. A lovely way to showcase a seasonal vegetable like rhubarb.

This recipe was great!  I forgot to add the nuts into the bread mixture and ended up putting them just on top and it worked great.  I doubled the topping for an extra treat.  Thanks so much for this amazing way to use a little rhubarb!

Five stars for taste.  Unfortunately mine burnt a little on the edges before it was done in the middle.  I'll reduce the temperture a little next time.

YUM !  Its a very moist/wet bread, but I did use 2 cups of rhubarb.  Used 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 cup regular splenda. Added a touch of cinnamon and a little orange zest.   Awesome topping if it doesn't fall off while you turn bread out of pan.  Spots look undone but it's just the rhubarb. baked about 10 minutes longer than suggested.

Another great way to use rhubarb!  I especially liked the crunchy topping which doesn't fall off when the bread is sliced.  The only change I made was to increase the rhubarb to 2 cups.  I will make this again.

Loved this recipe!  I did put in 2 cups of rhubarb and baked in the 9x13 pan.  Also took the suggestions from others and added a 1/4 c. brown sugar to the topping.  Will definitely make this again!  Very moist and a wonderful treat.  Thank You!

The basic bread recipe was perfect.  Very moist and the topping is delicious.  I thought it couldve used more rubarb.   The next time I think Im going to try to add some drained strawberries.

Wow....what a disappointment. I am usually an "easy grader" (or maybe I'm just easily impressed) but this recipe is completely lackluster.  I followed it to the 'T' but results were blandly edible, at best. The consistency is not right and the flavor of rhubarb is almost non-existent.  I guess if you're trying to mask the flavor (although I don't know why you would) of the rhubarb, this is your recipe.  As for me, I won't be wasting anymore precious Rhubarb this way. So bummed - I wanted to love this.

I'm not a big bread eater and my husband doesn't like rhubarb cooked. We both loved it as well as everyone I've made it for and I've made it three times in the last week. I can't stop eating it. I actually add 2 cups of rhubarb. SOOO Good!

I will make this again. The tender cake with the crispy streusel coating was a perfect match. I put it into a 9 by 13 pan  to serve as a cake. I'm glad I did because it is almost too tender to be a bread. Changes I made to the batter: I used 1/2 teaspoon orange extract instead of vanilla, I used 2 cups of rhubarb instead of one and a half cups- I think two and a half cups would even be okay. Changes to the topping: I used a full teaspoon of cinnamon mixed with the half a cup of sugar, I used two tablespoons of cold butter, and one tablespoon flour. Mixed it all until crumbly. I would lightly toast the nuts before using. Made the mistake of using Pam for baking to spray my pan. It created a bit of a moist bottom. Next time I would grease the pan and then dust it with flour to see if that helps with the wet bottom. Even with the wet bottom, I got rave reviews for this recipe! I could not stop eating it until it was gone.

I have never cooked or baked with rhubarb before. I was feeling brave yesterday and gave it a try and I have eaten almost an entire loaf of this bread in 24 hours! It is amazing. I made one slight change...I doubled the streusel...I have a bit of a sweet tooth! Great recipe!!!

We didn't care for this. Texture and density were fine, just didn't seem to have much flavor otherwise.

Delicious! Love the contrast between the moist cake and crunchy streusel. The only change I made was to use 2 full cups of fresh rhubarb instead of 1 1/2.

This bread is very tasty.  My only complaint was that a portion of the topping cracked and fell off when I took the loaf out of the pan.  I left the nuts out because I did not have any, and it was still good.  Good use of the rhubarb from the garden!

Excellent bread! Very moist with a lot of rhubarb flavor and not too sweet. Will make this one again-many times! Thanks!

I made this loaf for my family and everyone one loved it.  My son was still telling people about it 3 days later... It is wonderful.  I used rhubarb that I had frozen and thawed and it turned out great!
