Well I made these last year for my kidlet's birthday. So cute. I used Twizzlers and not Fruit by the Foot® Green Apple Wave® chewy fruit snack.

This turned out pretty cute. I made my own buttercream icing so I should have let it harden a little more before I inserted the fruit by the foot and non-edible scrapbooking flowers! :o) That was my own mistake of course. I placed the flip flops cake on a baking sheet and surrounded it with crushed graham crackers to resemble sand.

This turned out really cute. We used fruit by the foot on the sides of the flip flop instead of candies. I wasn't thrilled with using the whipped canned frosting...will make my own next time.

Made this for my twin girls first birthday party - hawaiian theme. They each got their own flip flop with their name on it. Everybody loved them!
