Genious! What a great way to perk up regular 'ol store bought dressing! Who knew that just a couple of ingredients you have on hand could do so much for a bottle of dressing. I used Kraft light Italian dressing and while it's not Olive Garden, overall it was very good.

A great simple idea to enhance the flavour of store-bought italian dressing.  I should have thought of this myself long ago.

Not quite as good as Olive Garden, but on the right track.  I used Newman's Olive Oil and Vinegar dressing and added 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper and 1 Tbsp. parmesan cheese.  This made it a little better.  But it was adding an extra 1/4 cup white wine vinegar that give it that extra zip, much more like Olive Garden!

It was great!! I used Ken's Light Olive Oil Vinagrette.  I actually even poured a little more oil out of that.  It is great to marinate chicken with.

A nice way to dress up bottled dressing but for us, it was a little too sweet. I used Newman's dressing. Next time, I'll cut back on the sugar and maybe add a little fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

I made this last night for something different.  My husband couldn't get enough.  I enjoyed it.  It was very flavorful.  I personally thought it was a tad too sweet and next time I will cut down on the sugar.  I liked how easy it was to change up a dressing I already had.

Good on salad. Our guests seemed liked it. It wasn't special but it was decent.

Awesome. Used Newman's Olive Oil and Vinegar and took the advice of others and added 1/2 c. white wine vinegar.

Love this! I used store bought Italian dressing and added the garlic, basil, oregano, and sugar. Went awesomely with garden rotini, black olives, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes!

This was okay but not great, it's still missing something for me.  A step up from bottled dressing but not quite my favorite restaurant level.

Tastes just like OG! I used it successfully on a ham and cheese sandwich with fancy lettuce. Together with the salad and a chicken soup I made the other day I felt like I stepped into Panera Bread!
