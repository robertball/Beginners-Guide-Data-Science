Ummm.... creme de cacao is a CHOCOLATE flavored liqueur.. not coconut. When people ask for creme do cocoa, they are mispronouncing cacao. Creme de cacao is correct if you are looking for chocolate flavor.

I placed a chocolate kiss truffle at the bottom of the glass. It was delicious with a tasty treat at the end!

Creme de cacao is chocolate flavored but it is a little different from chocolate liqueur in that it is not as sweet or thick. I chose to go w/ chikeechiquita's suggestion of Godiva's white chocolate, although I used vanilla vodka. I froze my glass & then rimmed it w/ Magic Shell chocolate ice cream topping & I garnished w/ a banana chip...thanks for a nice drink Tara G!

Hi all, I didn't rate it, since this is my recipe, but in looking over it, I see there is a typo--it should read creme do cocoa, not cacao--completely different liquors with completely different tastes.  Sorry if anyone tried it and it was awful!  Although the cacao is coconut flavored, so maybe that would be a good drink as well!!!!

After reading that there was a typo, I though this recipe was misleading considering I did not like what it called for.

Delicious!  We also dipped the rim in Bailey's Irish Creme and then in chocolate sugar!
