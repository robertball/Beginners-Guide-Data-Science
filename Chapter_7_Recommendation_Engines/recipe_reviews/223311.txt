At first taste,  (made exactly as written) this dish was dry and bland.   I noticed the taste of the beer which gave it a very distinctive flavor.  It wasn't  what I was hoping for.
I served it to guests and eventhough they politely finished their plates, no one had seconds :-(
Needless to say, I have a TON of leftovers.  
I decided to take my leftovers and turn it into a  5 star (to our tastes) dish.
First off, I made another sauce. I sauteed a mixture of red and green peppers and onions. I had a bag of frozen.  Then, I added more garlic, tomato paste, a healthy Tbsp of gochujang , 1  1\2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes ,  1 Tbsp. Better than Bouillion,  the water , s&p, 2 Tbsp Pri Pri, and the paprika. 
It made A LOT of sauce so I  used half of it to mix with the original dish.  It was Great!  I went heavy on the spices so it would come through more prominently and it was perfect.  This was a total redo...
Eventhough our guests liked it much better after the changes, I  won't  be making it again.   My "changes" were more than just adding more salt or spice.  What I ened up having at the end was another recipe all together.   Sorry.
