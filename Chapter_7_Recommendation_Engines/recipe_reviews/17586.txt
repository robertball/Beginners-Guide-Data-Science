Excellent white frosting, tho' I did modify it a bit to suit my taste and needs.  What's most important about this recipe is the shortening to powdered sugar ratio, which is 1 cup of shortening to roughly 4 c. of powdered sugar, and in my view it's perfect.  Since I tinted my frosting and didn't need it to be pure white I was able to use pure vanilla rather than the clear imitation vanilla (which certainly has its place).  I also didn't add the butter flavoring, preferring just the vanilla flavor.  As I do with all frostings calling for shortening, I used hi-ratio shortening, which can be found in cake supply stores or ordered online.  As for the milk, don't add it all at once!  You may not need it all!  I dribbled it in, little by little, and probably used about half the amount called for.  This was perfect with "Aunt Bert's White Cake," also from this site, but would be suitable for just about any flavor cake.

I did not care for this recipe. The taste was straight shortening and powdered sugar, even with butter-flavored shortening and extra butter and vanilla extracts. I couldn't fathom why this was so highly-reviewed. However, after adding 1/2+ cup heavy whipping cream and continuing to whip it like crazy, the frosting was wonderful! I highly suggest this addition, unless you want to feel as if you're eating straight shortening and powdered sugar!

I have made this frosting recipe for years with excellent results.  Depending on the amount of humidity in the air and how exact I have been measuring the confectioners sugar, I adjust the amount of milk that I add accordingly.  I always start out slow and add it gradually.  Sometimes I need less than called for, sometimes more.  I typically use almond flavoring, however.

Great tasting frosting and perfectly white, but I had a major problem with it seperating on me often. I had to mix it a long time twice to get it on the cupcakes. Then I had to refrigerate them to keep the icing from seperating again. I followed the recipe exactly, but I may have done something wrong. Excellent flavor though, no doubt there. I will definitely give it another shot.

Best white frosting I have ever made. Easy to spread and very tasty. I use this for all wedding cakes unless called for fondant.

very tasty and hold up to piping.  Coloring is easy.  I have never been big on "butter" flavoring or imitation vanilla, but they are vital and make this frosting good tasting.  Cook's illustrated says imitation vanilla was indistinguishable when used in a recipe.  Go for it!

This frosting was the best! The flavor was excellent, the consistancy perfect. It was perfect for cake decorating. I did not have butter flavored extract so I used some butter flavored popcorn salt instead, and the flavor was so good.  This will the frosting I use whenever I make a cake now.  In fact, I just came back to print the recipe so I will not lose it.

This frosting was horrible.  Continually separated, did not taste that great, and was an overall bust.   My expectations were pretty high when I read the review beforehand, and I've made frostings that were excellent before, but this just did not crack up to par.

I think that I may have used almond extract instead of butter flavoring...but the frosting turned out perfect for our friend and cousin's 50th Birthday "wedding cake".

Turned out great for my cupcakes.  I used real vanilla since I didn't have the imitation stuff, but it still turned out pretty white.  Just be sure to add the milk a little at a time.  Confectioner's sugar doesn't take much liquid.

Great Frosting for wedding cakes.  I read all the other comments and for those who had trouble with seperation.  The higher the humidity in the air the more likely frosting will be to seperate.  Best prepared in lower humidity conditions.  Rainy days are the worst.

I must rate this one with only 1 star. I really enjoyed the buttery taste but I had the same problem as other reviewers. The frosting was to loose and separated. I think more detailed instructions are needed so that we know to add milk gradually since less is apparently needed. I may try adding some things to improve this. But I was disappointed.

I found that I had to use WAY more powdered sugar to get this to a desirable consistency! Other than that ok.

I was hesitant to try this recipe, especially after reading the reviews where it was stated the frosting separated.   I had no problems w/ the frosting.  For those w/ the problem, the only thing I can think of that would make the frosting separate is if you have someone living w/ you who has a habit of drinking milk straight from the jug.

I tried this recipe because it includes my preferred sugar to fat ratio for frosting. I use Adam's Best vanilla extract. We love this type of frosting as does everyone we serve it to.

This is a very sweet simple buttercream, although the previous reviewers are right about using butter instead of shortening (it tastes much better). I just can't get past that "raw" powdered sugar taste.

I found a way to remove that taste, from a recipe on the Taste of Home website. Add 1/4 cup powdered coffee creamer to the traditional 1 cup butter+4 cups powdered sugar+1 tsp vanilla +about 4 Tbsp milk buttercream recipe. I know other people who dislike that taste will love frostings made with dry nondairy creamer!

Very easy to make and great tasting frosting. I will definately be making this one again. I didn't have the clear vanilla, so I just used the the regular imitation vanilla. Thanks for sharing.
