This was pretty tasty, I ended up puting double the amount of mozerella in the cheese mixture (unintentionally), but it still came out good. I would suggest putting salt and garlic in it, it needed just a little more flavor.

I loved this recipe because it was cheap to make, made a good amount and worked well for a Meatless Meal. I did use cottage cheese in this recipe only because cottage cheese was easier on the grocery bill. I did also add just a little more cheese and one chopped sweet onion, a mess of fresh minced garlic and couple teaspoons homemade italian seasoning to the sauce. Not bad. I'd try to fill it out more with more vegetables next time (maybe some spinach and chopped red pepper). My boys did miss the meat (I did not, honestly......I thought it was much better without the meat) but they did like it without which means I can make this again.
