Excellent fries!
Even using cheap potatoes, I got crisp fries.
I used a deep fryer and added beer (lager) instead of water. For those wondering about dipping each fry seperatly...thin your batter just slightly (about a tbsp tops!) and put the batter in a medium-sized plastic container with a tight-fitting well-sealing lid. Add your cut potatoes, seal her up, then SHAKE for approx 1-2 mins to coat all the fries. This will evenly coat all the fries with batter and save you time in dipping them. When adding them to the hot oil, add them using tongs insead of your fingers...I took "tongs full" bunches and dropped them into the oil, let the batter set up ever so slightly, then seperated them by shaking the bunches until they came apart (about 1 min into frying). I'm impatient and while they didn't come out perfectly solo fries...the bunches were crisp and yummy too!
Try adding cajun spices or chipolte pepper instead of the paprika, it gives them a little kick!

Instead of frying, I BAKED these in the oven, which took about an hour or longer, but they came out nice and crispy on the outside.  I just used flour, seasoned salt, cayenne and basil, then added half water and half oil to make a batter.  I will make these again the same way! Yum!

LILSPINSTER's review was really helpful! I baked them the way she suggested (but for 45 minutes at 350 in my oven though... watch the fries after 30 minutes), and they turned out great. Great variation for those who don't like to deal with being splattered by oil or those who are watching their weight. They turned out scrumptious, by the way-- no more McDonald's for me!

WOW! These fries are literally the very best I have ever had in my life! Absolutely NO exaggeration! I was a little uneasy when I added water to the flour mixture, and I needed far more than 1/2 cup of water to make it liquid, so do not be worried if you end up with what looks like tartar sauce, because it ends up to be absolutely PERFECT!

These were delicious! My best friend's husband actually told me I would have to come live at their house so I could make them whenever he wanted them...lol...I made them with the Easy French Dip Sandwiches from this site and everyone loved them! They are a little time consuming, but worth it. I did do it slightly different though. I made the wet batter and then made a dry version of it and coated each fry in each. This made it so that the fries didn't stick to each other. I also used our Fry Daddy instead of a pan. *UPDATE* So these were tastey the way the recipe was written but I wanted a more tender fry so went on the search and found that if you par-fry them first and then batter them you have a crispy AND tender fry! You peel and cut your potatoes into fries and place into water and refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer (up to 2 days), get your oil ready and place fries into the oil shortly (until tender...not brown). Take the fries out and drain on paper bag or towel, allow to cool enough to handle and then dip into batter and fry again. YUM

My daughter asked for homemade french fries.  I wanted to try this but she insisted she liked plain fried potatoes better, so I did both.  Hers were soggy and bland.  These (i added a dash of cayenne and a dash of black pepper and didnt measure anything) were tasty and crispy.  I also put them on a cookie-cooling rack over a plate, and 2 hours later they were still yummy, whereas the others were nasty!  It does certainly take more time than buying the frozen ones . . . thats the whole point of making home made -- the flavor, the experience -- if you want convenience, buy convenience food . . . if you want yummy home-made fries, try these!

everyone really liked these fries, but they took a long time to make, 8-10 minutes per skillet-full and you can't put too many in to cook at one time or they end up stuck together.  I was at the stove for almost 2 hours to make enough for my family of 13.  I also discovered that it took more than double the amount of water the recipe called for and don't forget to pat the potatoes dry before dipping or the batter just slides right off.  I will make these again if I can figure out a way to speed up the process.

These were great!  I did add alot more seasoning to the batter because I could tell it needed more.  I added some garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and regular pepper to it.  These turned out so crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  It doesnt say how long or what temp to cook these at...so for an example I set my deep fryer to 350 degrees and fried them for 6-7 min.  My boyfriend loved these and said they was better than the bagged kind!

I just made this for dinner and we loved it.  I used the batter with 3 potatoes and two chicken breasts (for buffalo chicken sandwiches, I just coated the chicken with hot sauce after frying). Yummy.  So yummy my husband finished off mine when I wasn't looking.  Some people mention not being able to cook enough fries at the same time.  I would just use two pans to cook all the fries at once rather than finding a way to keep them crisp.

I just tried this recipe and WOW!!.  Both my boyfriend and I loved it.  I didn't have the paprika, but it didn't matter.  This is a very tasty way to make fries.  This is one recipe I shall keep.  I'd been trying to think up a way to make my homemade fries crispy.  Thank you Cassie for posting this recipe.

GREAT!!!!! Just finished making 5lbs of these fries and the first three batches didn't make it to the dinner table!! I did add a few extra seasonings, but basically follwed the recipe and the family LOVED them! ***I had to make a run halfway through cooking and notcied that the fries made AFTER the batter had sat for 30 minutes were much, much more crispier than those made immediately after it was mixed!*** Thanks for sharing!!

The trick with this and it is more time consuming:  batter the fries and lay on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper.  Put in freezer for 10-20 minutes.  the batter will stay stuck to the fries and the fries dont stick together as was a problem.   This is a great recipe though.  Would be worth it to make a big batch and keep them in the freezer.

These fries were awesome! I was in quite a hurry when I made them the first time, and didn't read the full recipe. So rather than creating a wet batter with the water, I used only the dry ingredients to coat the potatoes. I put the ingredients into a ziploc freezer bag, added the cut potatoes, and shook away! The only difference that I might recommend, would be to slightly blanch the fries in boiling water for about three minutes prior to coating and frying them. This technique cooked them ever so slightly before I fried them, allowing them to crisp much quicker on the outside and still be extremely tender on the inside. All in all, this will be how I make homemade french fries from now on!

This is a simple, easy way to make seasoned fries and my husband loved em.  I decided to try to bake them, as another suggested, and it worked out great.  I also just used seasoned salt instead of the individual salts.  I did a 50-50 mix of oil and water to add the the flour mix.  Sprayed 2 baking sheets with non-stick, coated the fries and lined them up in a single layer and baked in the oven at 415 for 25-30 min, flipping half way through.  I cut mine into shoestrings, so they may need longer to bake if they are thicker.  Simple, crispy, and easy!

Thse were just ok to me. The batter made nice texture, but I had to add a lot more seasoning before I really tasted anything. Maybe it's just me, and I like bolder flavors, or maybe I did something wrong. As for the batter and the technique, it's pretty good. To anyone wondering what these are like when they're finished: I would play around with the seasoning, but the batter is exactly like the beer batter they put on fish.

These were great... I let the fries sit in ice water for 30 minutes and dried. Then, mixed up flour/paprika/garlic and onion powder plus some chili powder - added water to get pankacke batter consistancy. Dropped in the fries and shook'em around like buffalo wings and used tongs to drop them in the oil for 2 minutes. Drained them and let them cool for a few seconds - then returned them to the oil for 5 more minutes. Came out perfectly crunchy and lots of flavor.

Family loved these fries. The water amount is sightly off. It took about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of water to achieve the correct consistency. I also thought there was way to much salt so I used 1 teaspoon onion salt, 1 teaspoon of Crazy Jane's salt and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder plus the suggested paprika. My daughter told me that my son really loved them and that he ate two plates of fries. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

OK, these are amazing. They really are. As I began eating them while I was still making them, I was thinking, "The creator of these is a genius!" The only changes I made were to use 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder instead of salt because most things are too salty for me. I still used the 1 tsp of salt & paprika. But they needed more salt so the recipe as written is probably perfect! I sprinkled more salt on while they were fresh out of the skillet & greasy. I used cast iron & peanut oil if it matters. And ate with ketchup.

The crispy outside of these fries tasted AMAZING! I doubled (maybe even trippled) the amount of paprika though because I have never been able to taste paprika very well. I also made sure to pat the potatoes dry before dipping them in the batter to make the batter stay on better when frying. And I used self-rising flour which made the fries "puff" up a lot. We liked the fluffy crunchy texture of using the self rising flour. The only way this recipe would be better would be if you added extra salt on them at the end of frying while their nice and hot. And it was SUPER easy to make. Love this recipe. I will be using this often thanks!

These fries are delicious. I did not deep-fry them, to avoid the calories, instead I baked them at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes, turning them over once. They all kind of stuck together but they tasted sooo good no one cared. Perfect by themselves, did not want for ketchup. Thanks for the recipe

I tried this, so good, make sure the batter isn't too watery or there will not be any on the fries, I realized it look quite long at medium heat, so I put it on a bit higher. They didn't even taste like fries, they tasted tastier, also the cold water trick is really good, it last for up to 2 days.

These were absolutely delicious! It can be a bit difficult to tell when they are done, but I quickly realized that the crispier the french fries were, the better they were! It took about 5-7 minutes for mine to be done the way my husband and I liked them. This is an excellent recipe that we will be using multiple times!

This was a good recipe.  Relatively easy to make and the result is a nice, crispy, home made fry.  I tried the batter both thick and thin (as called for in the recipe) and my husband and I liked the thin batter better.  Cooked these in the deep fryer at 375 for 9 minutes.  Very versatile base recipe that can be spiced to taste.  I could see using this on any type of vegetable to deep fry.  It's very popular in restaraunts these days to serve battered fried green beans, cauliflower, broccoli and even asparagus!  I think this would work well for all.  Thanks, Cassie!

Since I dont have russet potato in hand, I use frozen french fries instead and nevertheless it was awesome but I did add some more spices and more water to make the batter thinner. Sure will make again. Thanks.

I have made this a couple of times in the deep fryer. For those that have bigger families, I suggest a bigger deep fryer or 2 of them if you fry on a regular basis. I did 2 batches in the fryer for my family of 5, including 2 guys that are big eaters. I have even tried this substituting steak seasoning because it has black pepper and garlic and other stuff in it. It is spicy and yummy with ketchup or ranch dressing. This batter works great with fish, chicken or butterflied shrimps.

These taste wonderful, however, they are a bit messy to make and they need to be stuck into the deep fryer one at a time to avoid getting a giant clumb of frys.  Even when putting them in one at a time they still stuck together some.

My husband showed me this recipe and I was very skeptical about it. As he was adding ingrediants I was giving that look that "Are you serious?!". But I was pleasantly surprised, it was simply delicious! I only want my fries this way now! Dipped in ranch dressing stepped it up to a whole new level!

The best fries ever!!!!!!!!! I don't think I have ever had such crunchy yummy fries, only change was that I didn't have paprika and I left out the salt.  When they where done I topped them off with season salt. Dipped in Ken's Honey Mustard :)

We made this last night and MAN they are good. I used a deep fryer because I didn't want the spashes all over the place (plus my 7 month old was wandering around lol). I took my time putting the batter dipped fries in the fryer, but in the end, I just started throwing them all in there, and 'stirring' it with a spatula to help them from sticking together. It helped, and they ended up not sticking together at all. Great recipe!! Love it!

The first time I made these I skipped the water soaking step because it didn't seem necessary, and they turned out great.  Later when mom visited I handed her the recipe to make while I BBQed the main course.  She did soak in water and the batter didn't stick very well.  So skip the water and enjoy!

I don't mean to be a kill-joy but I agree with the person who said baking them was a disaster... the batter came off all the fries and all I ended up with was a baking sheet that needed a lot of soaking.  Maybe next time I'll put the fries on a rack or something and try it that way.  There is no way I would hand dip and individually place fries into a fryer unless I was only eatting them myself... I have 5 people in my family and I'd be starving before I got to eat anything.  Gotta be a better way...

Excellent! I made this pretty much as directed, though I didn't have onion salt, so I substituted seasoned salt. It was easy and very tasty! I have a narrow frying pot and they did tend to clump together, even putting them in one at a time, but it didn't matter; they still cooked well. Didn't have any left to try them in the microwave! This one's a keeper!

These did not work out at all. The "batter" was so thick with just the water called for, so I added some more until it could be drizzled from a spoon, like said in the directions. Problem? The batter wouldn't stick to the potatoes at all! It all came off, and I ended up with greasy soggy potato sticks, and a bunch of oil.

My experience with homemade fries up to this point had been unexceptional to say the least! THESE are absolutely the best fries I have ever had. My husband said they were really great, too, and he usually has little to say--just eats! This is in my recipe box and I will make them for my daughter and granddaughter for their next visit. I'm still raving about these "fur-fur pots" (childhood nickname for French fries).

I just tried this recipe tonight and to be completely honesti wasnt impressed. I followed this down to the t and at the end a teaspoon of the spices wasnt enough for all the flour so the fries tasted like fried flour. also I found that it took quite long for the fries to get cooked let alone gold and crispy...all in all the end result was not worth the trouble BUT it was a good concept, I think with a little tweeking everyone  can find their own tasty way

Cut in rounds and this was SO good! Need to up the water to 1 and half times what it says. 4-5lbs is right for our family but takes around 2 + hours to fry. Second time, followed second reviewer's advice for baking and these are GREAT! The fried version is far and away better but the baked version is a good substitute. :)

Easy, fast recipe. Better alternative to frozen fries. Batter makes fries crispy and flavorful. Fried mine in a deep fryer with vegetable oil at 350 degrees until golden brown. Salted some more after fries were done. Had bits of light crunch, not too greasy and tasted like soft potato in the middle with crispy outer crunch.

These are absolutely FABULOUS!  I made them last night and we ate the entire amount at one sitting (oink, oink!).  I did substitute onion powder for the onion salt, and added 1 teaspoon Lawry's Seasoned Salt to the mix.  I also wound up using probably an additional cup of water to get the consistency just right.  I did drop them into the hot oil one at a time, but they still clumped, so I let them cook for a couple of minutes, then gently separated them with a long metal spoon.  I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars - they are that good!  They don't even need ketchup!   Thanks, Cassie!!

These were the best home made fries.  I made the mistake of putting in my deep fryer basket at first and they all stuck to the basket so then I moved to the pan and they came out perfect.  My husband said they were better than any restaurant fries.

Wonderful seasoned fries.  It was a little messy but the kids loved them.  I used some seasoned salt in place of onion salt because I didn't have any and I added onion powder too. I fried them in Canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  My daughter is still coming back for more.  All I could hear was "yummy"!  Thanks for a great recipe Cassie!  :)

Good if your pressed for time I suppose, but they are realy tough and I didnt even over cook them, some of them were under cooked to find out if I WAS over cooking and that was the result of the toughness..

They lacked on taste aswell. I even tried adding parmesan and cheddar cheese to spice up the next batch. I was disapointed with these and I am a big fry eater.

These were very yummy.  I doubled the seasoning and put 1/2 aside and mixed it with ranch dressing for dipping.  I stacked these on a plate and sprinkled cheese and green onions all over and zapped it in the microwave till cheese was melted.  Yum!

These were the best fries ever and really easy to prepare and cooked up fast too. I also used the batter to fry up some pickle slices and they were wonderful! I used garlic and onion powder and Tony
Chacheres for seasoning. These are awesome.

My super picky son finally agreed to try making french fries at home. I made the mistake of trying to bake these instead of frying (like a couple other reviewers suggested). Sadly, they adhered so badly to the pan that they could not be removed from nonstick pan and were rendered inedible. So, strike one with this recipe...maybe I should have greased the pan? HOWEVER, I did use the leftover batter (there's lots) on some sweet potatoes, and fried them. HEAVEN! Next time will try a)frying them, b)oiling the baking pan, and c)with green beans.

AMAZING!!! I added way more seasoning to the flour though, used garlic and onion powder not salt. Added seasoning salt and cayenne pepper also!! Had visitors and even my own mom didn't believe me I made them.. I had to prove by the mess in the kitchen ;) will be making these all the time now!

I tried the baked version like some other readers suggested but mine just turned into a big mess. I think these would work best with a deep fryer, and I would avoid using the batter in future baked fry recipes. Can't wait to try the fried version! Thanks

Other than taking AGES to cook all the fries I had planned to cook, they turned out nicely. Next time I will use Peanut Oil to cook them in as I have heard that is better than vegetable oil

My family and I loved these fries.  They were nice and crisy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I did have to add about twice as much water.  I also used fresh ground sea salt to the batter and a little on top as I took them out of the pan.  Yummy!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

DELICIOSO!!! Thank you so much for sharing - I made hamburgers tonight and didn't want frozen fries so I bought some potatoes and planned on just frying them and then sea-salt - Not after I found this quick and delicious recipe! It did take 10+ min per batch but that was totally worth it! Gracias!!

Wow, these were fantastic. I used this recipe for sweet potato fries. I made the batter a bit thinner than the recipe called for by adding about 1 more tbsp of water mixing up the batter and then put the whole cut up potato in and mixed them around. Then I took out one fry at a time with tongs and put it in the hot oil. It took a bit of time to cook them so they wouldn't stick together but it was worth it. I've been looking a long time for a sweet potato fry recipe that was crisp and these are. They aren't skinny fries but if you want crispy fries I don't know how to get them without frying them. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Next time I will use a regular potato.

I'm in a coma these are so good yet so simple. Have you been trying forever to make perfect crispy fries but they always turn out soft and oily? I did this with water and Beer and kept adding Beer until I liked the batter, added my fav spices and threw the fries in the batter to soak while I got the grill going. Dropped them in with tongs, some stuck some didn't and they are the best fries I have ever had in my life and my new regular - yum! Thanks Cassie

Really crispy and good. A bit flour-y and hard to keep from clumping together, especially with a deep fryer.

really liked this recipe a lot. husband liked it also. you don't need to add that much water to the mixture. the water from the potatoes makes it plenty runny. I might add a few other seasoning next time. really liked it.

Batter was extremely sticky and, for the most part, merely lined the bottom of my pan. Harldy any at at all stuck to the actual fries. Had to throw it out and bake some plain in the oven.

I added white and black pepper, used g and o powders instead of salts, and 2 t. seasoned salt instead of plain.  This will be great for cheese fries.

I did something really wrong here!  Believe it was my batter.  It was quite 'liquid' and instead of coating just puddled around them.  I baked them as suggested and they took over an hour at 350 and eveything stuck in the process.  No real flavor at all.  Again, I'll accept the error was mine but what I ended up with was frankly just awful.  :(

These came out really good, but I have one word of caution for those of you making this for the first time.  Make sure the batter is very thick.  I believe that having the consistency of the batter to be able to "drizzle" it like the recipe says is too thin. Mine was kind of like pancake batter, and that was still a little too thin because most of the batter dripped off the side of the fries while they were cooking.  Next time, I'll make sure it's nice and thick so some of the batter will remain on the fries.  Otherwise, very tasty!

These fried up beautifully.  Nice and crispy.  Looked like they could have come from a restaurant.   I used 1/2 the dry ingredients but did use a full 1/2 cup of water and it was perfect for the two potatoes I peeled.  I used onion and garlic powders because I thought with all that salt it would be a bit much, plus I only stock the powders.  But when all was said and done they did need a bit more than the one teaspoon salt I had added. So I seasoned the finished fries with season salt. Yum!

I added a tsp of bayou cajun seasoning and these were delicious! I also added just enough water to the flour mixture so that it resembled a thick paste. Then I drained the cut potatoes from the water and added all of them to the paste and mixed it up. The batter thinned out because of some of the remaining water on the potatoes but if it's not enough water then just add more a little at a time.  This was a lot faster than dipping them one at a time.  I used tongs to put them into the fryer.  Sometimes I got lazy and added the fries in clumps and just poked them apart once inside the oil (be careful!) and they still turned out great :)

These are very tasty fries. All of the kids loved them. I did too, but found them a little time consuming. Of course I have to make a ton of fries to feed my family! I will make again, but prob not on a regular basis due to time. The taste is awsome though! Thanks for sharing!

Good fries. Could have used a little more seasoning. And I could not find onion salt so I used onion flakes and it was very good.

My husband loved, and I thought they were okay (I am picky about fries). What I will try next time is to double the powdered seasoning, keep one wet with water, and keep the other dry. I will dip in wet, then in dry so the fries have more batter on them, and wont stick as bad.

Seemed way too salty for our tastes, even without the onion salt, and my husband is a salt-a-holic! I think if I were to make this again I'd definitely cut the salt content by half at the least. The fries were very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, however.

These are great!  It is a little messy but well worth it!  I seem to always make a mess anyway...  I used a frying pan and drained the fries on a rack over a sheet pan so they wouldn't get soggy.  My hubby never eats fries but ate most of these while I was still fixing dinner.  Thanks Cassie - you are a genius!

HOLY COW, these are great!  Even my "once in a great while" (meaning he will eat 1 or 2) french fry eating husband ate quite a few.  A little time consuming without a fry daddy, but WELL WORTH IT!!  Thanks so much Cassie, we enjoyed these!

I wasnt expecting much when I made this but I was surprised. It was really good. I wish I hade made more. Some advise, let ur fries cool all the way down before you eat. This  makes the fries softer and brings the flavor of the fries out.

Followed Llspinsters suggestion to make them in the oven (only because I didnt have enough oil to make them in my fryer) and they turned out AWESOME. Husband loved them and asked me to make them again ^.^

I started off at medium-high heat as the recipe suggested and found I was burning the batter before the fries were tender.  Turning it down to medium caused them to cook perfectly, they came out golden brown, crispy, and beautiful.

That said, the batter itself could use a flavor boost.  I swapped the Onion and Garlic salt to Onion and Garlic powder and increased the amounts to a tbsp. each, switched the paprika to smoked paprika in the same amount, used a tbsp. of sea salt and a teaspoon of white pepper.

I cut 2 russet potatoes (carefully) with the mandolin, no peeling first. I dumped these in cold water in a larger tupperware, covered w/lid, set aside while I used the flour dredge for homemade chicken tenders before using it on the potatoes. Drained and rinsed the potatoes a few times, then added the remaining egg and some water, and tossed away like it was shake and bake. Fried them up, and I was quite impressed with how tasty and quick my variation was.

Instead of breading the fries one by one, dump all your ingredients in a gallon sized ziplock bag, add the sliced potatoes, and shake. SOOOOO much easier, faster, and a lot less mess!!

OMG, these are fantastic. I couldn't believe that even when I reheated them the next day in the oven they tasted good and crispy. Kudos to Cassie who posted this. I added cayenne pepper to mine instead of the paprika (cause I didn't have any and I like things hot) the batter was pretty zippy and I was worried my hubby was gonna scold me again for making things to spicy but by the time they came out of the oil they were PERFECT! Just a little zip and when they came out of the oil I sprinkled them with just a TAD of sea salt. OH MY. Great recipe!

These were great!  I followed the directions, only changes I made was with the seasoning.  I used chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne, pepper, and salt.  These were great, outside was crispy while the inside was soft and tender!  Will be making these many times again.

I made potato wedges with this recipe. My husband said it was the best potato wedges. After several hours, they still stay crispy. I will double the garlic next time.

I found this to take way too long since you have to drop them in the grease one by one.  It took forever for me to cook these and I didn't like the batter so much. Perhaps it would have worked better if I had a Fry Daddy.

These were very tasty!! So much better than the normal, boring way I fry potatoes. A few changes I made: I always soak my cut up potatoes in cold water/sugar before frying them, it helps make them crispier. I also added "Red Robin" seasoning to my flour mix for extra flavor. I dried my potatoes and dipped them in the dry flour mix before turning it into batter. Once I dipped the potato into the batter, I let the excess batter drip off by laying them out on a wire tray with foil underneath. Then added them to the hot oil about two-three at a time.  They did not stick together and turned out so full of flavor! Will be making these again!

I recently tried some sweet potato french fries and they were excellent. I tried making them myself, but they always came out soggy. I decided to look for a 'seasoned' french fry recipe, and came upon this recipe. Easy to make, and they came out crispy and delicious. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

I do not have the patience Ms. Cassie had so I attempted small and thin fries. First batch I did exactly how she said. AWESOME! Second batch, ok, third batch...realizing although good, I put too much water as the batter is not sticking to the potato. Fourth and final batch I threw at least one small potato's worth. The batter ended up in clumps and the fries, batterless, were wilty. They all stuck together so I put them all on one plate to pick a part with a fork. Odd, but still really yummy. Best to take your time, however. I did not have onion salt so used onion powder. Ok, but felt I needed to salt a bit at the end. Wonderful if would have been fine with onion salt?? Thanks for curing my 10pm fry crave!!

I really can't rate this since I baked it.  This was a sticky mess and never crisped up because I didn't think to put oil on it or spray it with pam.  I won't make this one in the oven again.

Awesome recipe- absolutely devine!  I had already started making the batter when I realised I didn't have any Paprika - so I used curry powder instead- very scrummy!!  I love that the chips stay crunchy!  I used a chip cutter to get all my chips the same size, to allow for more even cooking time.  I did need more than the suggested 1/2 cup water though.

These were a big hit. My boys were craving "Mojo Potatoes," an item offered at Shakey's Pizza in California. Instead of cutting the potatoes like fries, I cut them in round slices. I pan fried them until golden brown, then finished them off in the oven.

I baked half of the fries at 425 for almost 30 mins for me, it was so crispy and delicious.  The other half I fried as called for in recipe. My family just love it! So easy to do. Thanks for a great recipe. It reminds me of the homemade fries my mom use make.

These are fantastic!  They are just as stated...crispy.  We rarely fry anything in our home, but every now and then we treat ourselves.  If you are looking for that special fry to accompany your hamburger or hotdog...this is the recipe you must try!  I hate to admit it, but these were so good and we had made so many (there is only three of us) that I forced my husband to throw them away so I would quit eating them!  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing.  :)

This recipe was delicious! The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was a little time consuming to put each fry in one at a time, but worth it.I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

I have been looking for a french fry recipe forever that actually crisps the fries and is not terribly greasy. Here we have another failure.  I have tried this recipe numerous times exactly as written.  The only thing I have changed is the temp of my oil.  At 375 degrees, they are somewhat edible.      My 3 daughters took one bite and that was all they could get down.  So I'll keep looking for a good recipe.

These where a hit at our dinner table with my kids and husband.  They where quite tedious to make, but, I guess worth it since they where goobled up.  I was thinking it might be too saltly so instead of the garlic salt & onion salt I used garlic powder and onion powder.  I used peanut oil, since that was what I had available--it worked just fine.

These were absolutely fabulous when only slightly modified for health and tasted like a mix between In-n-Out fries and baked lays.  I used only cheap Idaho potatoes (10 lbs for $.88!) and omitted the spices.  For the baking batter I used a flat square tupperware for the batter bowl, chopsticks for mixing/fishing the fries out, and modified the oil and water to 1/4 cup and 1 cup respectively.  So first I skinned the potatoes and put them into a bowl of cool water and only chopping the spuds when needed.  After chopping one potato I would separate the pieces with my hands by "rubbing the potato" to loosen up the cuts.  Then I dropped them into the tupper-ware of batter and mixed them around with my chopsticks to get a good coating.  Before fishing them out, I sprayed the foil covered cookie sheet with pam, set the toaster oven to 350 and cooked for about 15-25 minutes depending on how well you prefer them done.  There is no need to turn them and you can also get creative with the spices (cumin was tasty on mine).  Lastly you can choose to omit garlic and onion salt and sticking only with plain salt.  I'm sure if you use more oil than I stated it will taste even better but this was really delicious and much healthier by quartering the oil and thirding the salt. Definitely making these again.

Not impressed and what a waste of time.  Did 1/2 of my fries tonight this way, got smart and did the rest my normal way.  Took way more water than called for.  Took too much time.  My normal fries tasted way better.

This recipe is easy to make and you'll feel like a pro once you're done.  There's no perfect way of doing it, the fries will be crispy and yummy after they are fried.  I followed the recipe except I substitued the onion salt for seasoned salt. The  seasoned salt and paprika will give your fries a beautiful golden color so try to use at least one or the other.  Also, 3 potatoes makes about 5-6  servings and I would say to use more flour and water than the recipe suggests, you dont want to run out of batter half way through the process like me.  If you start running out of oil on the pan just add more oil.  If you want to eat them the next day I would suggest you pop in a convection/toaster  oven or place them back on a pan to heat up.

For everyone rating this recipe low because they baked instead of fried, read the directions!  The fries need to be fried!!!  If you baked them and had a horrible experience, don't knock the recipe.  You made them wrong.  I've been using this recipe for several years and I've had nothing but compliments on how good these fries are when made according to the recipe.

I added about 1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning and a dash of cayenne along with the spices listed. We loved them.  I'd been looking for a crispy, battered french fry recipe for a long time.  This is the best one I've tried. I'll definitely make these again.

Just got done making these fries.  They are fantastic.  Nice and crunchy just as good if not better than most resturant fries.  I fried them in my electric wok and used beer instead of water.  Be prepared to spend some time making them but it's worth it.  My kids loved them.  Might try to bake them next time.

And to think I almost gave up on homemade french fries.  These are not the best fries I have ever had, but they are easily the best fries that I have ever made at home.  This recipe is quick, simple, and a definite keeper!!!

I was snacking on these fries while cooking them, and they were really crispy and yummy. However, by the time I was finished they were no longer crispy, but rather limp and greasy. I won't make these again.

The reviews are right, these fries are crispy.  However, the texture for me was more like "battered" french fries.  We fried them and kept them in the oven because we were also deep frying halibut and from the reviews, it sounded like these were going to take a long time.  That was in our favor because they got even crispier at 200 degrees for 20-30 mintues.  They were not bad by any means, just wasn't the texture I was going for tonight.

These were ok.  I just think that they were a lot of work and not really that different from my oven fries.  Thanks for posting the recipe

I really liked the batter, but I boiled the cut french fries first just until they were tender, drained them, then battered and fried. The inside was tender and the outside nice and crisp. And since they are already halfed cooked the frying time is only a couple of minutes.

I've been looking for a way to make baked fries crunchy. This batter worked! I omitted garlic salt & paprika, I was going for method, not flavor. Used onion powder and kosher salt. I added about 1.5Tbs of Extra Light Olive Oil(doesn't have flavor) to the flour mix and added water until I liked the consistency (maybe 5Tbs water for 1/2cup flour).  I made sure the batter was just thick enough to barely coat the fry. I put half of them right on the baking sheet and half on a baking rack on the baking sheet. The rack method worked better, the ones directly on the sheet had a batter ring that smooshed out around each fry. I baked them at 350 degrees, in a convection oven, for 20 minutes & then checked them at 5 minute intervals. The outside was crispy, but didn't taste like batter, and the inside was soft but not gross.

These fries are quite tasty, but there is a fundamental flaw in the recipe.  Because you can only fry a few fries at a time, it takes a lot longer to make than the times posted at these measurements.  Probably doesn't matter if you have a deep fryer, but something to think about for home gamers.  If you're only looking for a couple of servings, use 25% of the suggested serving size, otherwise it will take you an hour or two to fry this many potatoes in a pan.

I have always deep fried my french fries when I cook them, but thought I'd give these baked fries a try. We loved them! I use different seasonings each time I make them, but have made them at least 4 times now. Thanks for the recipe

I didn't fry these, but baked for an hour at 350 on the bottom of the oven.  Bc I had them on the bottom, they really crisped up.  Mine were a bit gloppy, but they are still pretty good.  I don't have onion or garlic salt; just onion and garlic powder, so I added about a teaspoon more salt.  I also accidently dumped in a lot more paprika; but no matter, I love paprika.  I also added a bit of pepper.  Thanks for the recipe--we'll make again!

Holy Cow ... love it.  Used the beer idea instead of water and used a deep fryer (one fry at a time).  Added some crab pot boil seasoning.  Takes time but if you have the time ... these are awesome.  I also cut them a bit large without skins.

I baked them- and instead of making a batter, I tossed them in oil and then sprinkled with seasoning

Very good - instead of making julienne fries, I simply sliced the potatoes into rounds (I even left the skins on) and dipped them in the batter. My husband loved them!

Awesome if done correct!! We only used 1 lb potatoes (3) and 1/2 c flour, 1 t each garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and 1/2 t each salt, sea salt, pinch of cayenne pepper. Instead of the water we used beer and I needed about 1/2 - 3/4 c to make the batter. You must heat the oil to 350, for my gas stove that was just a lil above medium. I let it heat for 10 minutes. I fried 5-6 minutes each side and then drained each bunch on a new set of paper towels to absorb the most oil. Awesome. If you need to reheat do so in oven 350 for about 5 minutes. Just great!!

well we used the recipe basically to a T, but I put a little more water, but the results weren't as crunchy as we would of liked, they soaked up a lot of grease, even after put on paper towels.  The batter seemed to chewy.  But overall not to bad, just don't think will try this again

These tasted great and were definitely crispy, however the cook time is definitely inaccurate and you will need quite a bit more than the recommended amount of water. Count on 8-10 minutes of cook time per batch. We cut the recipe in half and needed to cook the potatoes in three batches which took us about half an hour.

Try microwaving the cut potatoes to just under done before coating and frying.  They hold the batter better, or you can coat with just seasoned flour

There is essentially no possible way to fit this many fries in a "large skillet" without them touching/clumping ( i used a 16 inch) unless it is the size of a manhole cover.  I used only ONE large potato (merely 1/4 of the potatoes called for in the "recipe" and still it was basically impossible.

The only thing I changed was using minced garlic mixed into the batter instead of powder, but all still went well. My fries look slightly different from the picture, but they're crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way I like them! I'll definitely use this recipe again in the future.

This recipe is a keeper. Mine turned out DELISSSSH. I used seasoning salt and garlic salt instead of onion salt bc that is what I have on hand and also had to add quite a bit more water. I did pat down the slices after cutting, but I did not need to soak them since I only used 2 potatoes and fried them quickly.

I  made these and followed the recipe to the t. They were extremely salty and I now don't know whether I'm gonna have a heart attack or fall asleep. I feel like they'd be much bbetter if baked iinstead of fried and much less salt. I'll try them modified next time.

Awesome fries! I added 1/2 Tbs of cayenne to mine and that was just the right amount of kick to it. Even my 3 year old approves. Others may want to add more salt or seasons to taste, but they were perfect for my family. Note: Do not dip your fingers into the mix with cayenne.

I don't really know what all the hype is about, unless I made these wrong. I followed the suggestions of the reviewers who BAKED theirs--350F for 45-1hr. The batter that I shook the fries in stay unevenly coated and tasted pasty. But the fries were cooked through so I guess that's good!

Yum.  I fry things rarely and only cook with white flour at holidays and special occasions, but we were grilling burgers and fries (real ones, not oven ones) sounded amazing.  I blame pregnancy.  I had my doubts, but these were delish.  I'm glad I'm eating mine now during the frying instead of with dinner, because between my three sons, the in-utero son #4, and my husband, these will go fast!  I used onion powder instead of salt b/c it seemed a lot of salt.  Next time I'll add pepper.  I also fried in coconut oil since we avoid all veg oils and heating olive oil destroys its beneficial properties.  Yum-o!  Thanks!

Followed this recipe as written except I didn't have onion salt, so I used Old Bay seasoning. I mixed batter ingredients in a large plastic bag, and added fries, sealed and shook. These fries are FANTASTIC! I made loads of these for our family movie night and everybody just loved them. Crispy and flavorful on the outside and tender on the inside. The perfect fry. Thanks bunches Cassie. This is now my go to french fry recipe.

Mmmm, these turned out very well! I also was worried that I would screw this up but they were very easy! I only made for 2 people so it didnt take too long, I cooked about 5 fries at a time because I only had a small pot. It would be hard to make these for a big family though.

This was really, really good. Fries came out perfectly crunchy.  I gave it four because seasoning was little bland.  After first batch, we added Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and that bumped it up to 5! Thank you for sharing!

I used the two-fry method with my home fryer. I cut the potatoes, then soak them in cold water not only to keep them from turning brown, but I read somewhere that it helps reduce the starch.  Then pat dry and deep fry to cook through.  Drain, let/pat dry, then place in this batter, gently stir, then re-fry (if batter becomes thick, thin with water to original recipe consistency).  Drop in the recommended one at a time.  They turn out golden with a great crisp and flavor.  I used garlic powder and onion powder, so I added salt after they came out of the fryer.  This will stay in my recipe box.

these fries are very good. I ended up having to add about a cup of water to make it thin enough for the fries. i added the fries to the mixing bowl and put a lid on it and gave them a good shake to coat them. will make again.

Was craving french fries, so first time making them on my own.  SO, So yummy. Followed recipe exact.  I dont have a deep fryer, fried them on stove top.  The bomb!!!  Can not go back to frozen fries.  Was 'sceptical' about the batter, but it is perfect!!!

I'm typically one who cuts corners.  After cutting the fries I also cut an onion into similar sized strips and let them soak in cool water for a few minutes.  After draining I left them in the bowl.  
Then I used whole wheat flour and sprinkled it on the wet fries then stirred them around until a paste was created, then sprinkled on some seasoning.  I put them into a hot skillet with vegetable oil and fried them.  I'm sure baking them would get good results as well.  
I didn't worry too much if some of them stuck together.  They were very good.

Thought this was great!! My husband enjoyed too, and he is a very picky eater. I changed things up though a bit. I substituted season salt ( a good amount) and added some chili powder. then instead of drying the potatoes and adding water to the mixture, i just grabbed the spuds from the water and did a "shake n bake" thing in a baking pan. I did mine all at the same time (don't do that) they all stuck together. Just added some more flour and season salt in between batches to keep the coating strong. Took me about 40min-1hr. for the complete process. Used a big pasta pot for the oil, put them in the oven to keep warm (at least 300 degrees) came out great. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I tried these last night and they were great, but baking them didn't work out well. The little I fried were wonderful. I didn't have all the ingredients so I did make some minor substitutions. I used Goya all purpose seasoning for the onion salt and hot sauce for the paprika. I'm going to try this again and coat them with spray oil I think.

I baked my fries, skin still on because that's where all the nutrients are, for 20 minutes in a 400F oven...this dries them out and cooks the middle a touch...don't over cook them...then I removed them from the oven and let them cool a bit before continuing with the frying process. If you let them cool, it stops the cooking process inside and yields a fluffy texture on the inside, and crunchy on the outside for your finished product.  Good recipe...

Wont make them again. The batter was nice. I might use it again if I was deep frying something else. Tried some onions in the batter and they were better than the fries. Just did not like potatoes. More a fritter than a french fry. Creative idea but not to my liking.

These were awesome!! I cut up 4 large potatoes, which is what we had, with a mandolin into julienne cut fries. Made the batter and was so thinking this would not work... the 1/2 cup water was way too little and I ended up adding more like a cup or cup and a 1/2 until it was thin enough to drizzle. I put that into a large bowl and just imersed as many fries as I could, coating them all really well. Then just picked up a fry, shook off the excess and plopped it into the hot oil. As soon as my boyfriend tasted one he wanted more. He ended up throwing more than one fry in at a time and they do clump up pretty bad, they are easier to seperate if they cook a bit first. But honestly, the clumped up fries were the best, lol.

My friend made these for the superbowl party last night.  They were amazing!  Even after the game was over, the fries kept their texture and were still delicious. I didn't even need ketchup because it was so flavorful.

I made these for lunch today and my husband and I did not care for them. I tasted one right after it came out of the skillet and it tasted good but the longer they sat on the plate, they got soggy. I won't be making these again.

I just tried this a few minutes ago and it was the best, yet obvious idea yet.  My fries looked, and taste amazing.  They are crisp, yet not greasy.  I didn't even have to flip them.  This is a 5 star recipe.

I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was to whip up. For my husband and I, we used one large russet. I might have added more water than stated in recipe, but these french fries were fantastic. Crispy, soft inside, just everything you look for in a great french fry. I used the left over  batter for onion rings. WOW, we loved them! This recipe goes into my cookbook!!!

This recipe was really good!! I have had trouble before getting that really crispy fry with out par cooking or frying and then doing it again but this batter did the trick. The first couple of pieces I put in I was a little nervous because they take a few minutes to brown but they turned out great. I used a large electric skillet so I could more closely monitor the heat and had mine turned on 400 degreees. Next time I think I will try doing them in the over. Healthier and because my ventilation is poor in our apartment it did make the house smell of oil for a day or so.

Amazing, love how I can bake them too and comes out crispy and tasty. You can make your own seasoning to add to the batter, either way comes out so wonderful. I bake them at 450 degrees for 15 -20 min. Just watch them occasionally.

I gave it 3 stars because of how time consuming it was to make these. I was at my stove for over and hour cooking them. They were good, and very crispy, but If I were to make them again I would definitely add more salt.

The batter has a good flavor, but a different texture than I expected. It was my first time making battered fried though. Usually I just buy the bagged season fries, but I was trying to see if I could make them instead. My husband asked if he was eating fish, ha! I tried the batter on fish for fun. It was pretty good.

Very nice-- a bit messy. As others have stated, more than 1/2 cup water is definitely required, but no biggie. I was surprised at the quick cook time-- 3 min at 325 degrees cast-iron pan fry. Rich, tasty flavor.

Great fries! These were the perfect accompainment to serve alongside buffalo chicken burgers (MELXCLOUD). As with any new recipe, I found it necessary to make a couple of changes (aka enhancements). First, it took at least 3/4 c. of liquid to achieve a slightly thin batter as described. As is, mine was too thick, almost pastelike. Second, since my fiance had opened a bottle of Budweiser Select (he needed something to drink while grilling up our burgers lol), I "snuck" some of it for the batter. :) Third, as another reviewer suggested, I too prepared my batter in a sealable storage container, added handfuls of fries and SHOOK LIKE CRAZY!!! I still had to separate each fry and drop into my fry daddy individually tho.... And finally, I chose to use my deep fryer instead of going with the messy, laborsome skillet route. I found that cooking each batch of fries (5 total) at 375 degrees for 7 minutes was spot on. NOTE: I believe it's necessary to salt your fries prior to serving, but that could just be me (I like salt!). If you do, be SURE to do so while they're piping hot! All in all, I really enjoyed these, but for the amount of effort involved, I think I'll just by the $2 bag of generic store brand ones when the craving strikes. If I had a large crew to feed / was looking to pinch pennies, I'd probably suck it up and make these (they take a considerable amount of patience to make...). My fiance wants me to make onion rings next time. Thanks for sharing, Cassie!

My boyfriend and I just made this recipe. The french fries turned out great. We actually took a tip from one of the other raters and used Coors Light instead of water. EXCELLENT. I will definitely make these again. Thanks so much.

I have never fried anything before. I think for the first try, these came out pretty good. I followed the recipe exact except for the water. I just kept putting water in until the consistency seemed right. The seasoning amount was plenty, though maybe a little too salty. I would suggest taking out either the onion salt or garlic salt and substituting one of the powders and adjusting the amount. Otherwise, not a bad recipe.

I had a craving for fries last night so I gave these a shot.  And yeah they were basically the bomb.  I baked them like some people suggested and they were some of the best fries I ever had.  No more store bought or going to McDonalds that's for sure.  I spied them up a bit as well, but over all,  these are good.  I can't wait to make these again for my family.  Thanks a lot.

made these one day for the kids as a quick snack, they are awesome!!! Restaurant quality, I haven't even ever tried a bag fry that compares. For me though I had to change the ratio of water to flour I end up needing a little over a cup of water just keep mixing until it gets a good consistency like a tempura and for the seasoning I just use seasoned salt to the batter but that's just preference nothing could ruin this batter it's excellent! Thank You for sharing!! :)

I personally love french fries but i try to eat healthier, so i spray both sides with cooking oil, and bake them for about 15 min at 450 till soft, then i put them in the broiler for a few minutes to make them crunchy.  It works well for me and i then dont have the guilt of deep frying my food!

LOVED this recipe. My husband and brother swear it's just like the fries at a local restaurant famous for its great french fries. I added extra garlic powder, a little sugar, some dried oregano and a bit of chili powder. Perfect, tasty, super crunchy fries I'm planning to make over and over. Thanks a lot:)

I made this just like it said except baked them instead of fried. Would have rated it a 1 but I didn't fry like recipe recommended. Batter was goopy and just tasted like freezer burned Orieda fries out of a bag. I'm sticking to my oven fries. If you want to try this, fry them!

Timely, but soooooo good! First time I thinned out the batter too much and had to season a little more after cooking, but my small dinner party DIDN'T LEAVE ONE FRY BEHIND!!! Did them again for boyfriend with thicker batter seasoned a little more and they were just as good!

Very tasty!! I sliced my potatoes so they were round. I also used beer instead of water. The batter didn't smell so great but my fries turned out very crispy. Not at all soggy. I cooked in a skillet until brown on both sides. I didn't use garlic or onion salt. Instead I used garlic and onion powder and added a little more salt and substituted black pepper for the paprika. I will definitely make again. Worth a try!

Very good!! So easy to make, esp. if you have a french fry cutter.  I usually don't like battered fries, they remind me of those crappy tasting things you usually get at ball games and stuff where they need to keep them hot, but these are really tasty and good.  If you want a coated french fry, this is the recipe.

These came out perfect - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. And even though it took about 30 minutes to make roughly 8 servings, the first batch was as crispy as the last.

Awesome!  While these fries did take some effort, I think the amount of effort is terribly over-hyped.  As a previous poster said, if you want it quick, you've got to deal with a lower quality.  All in all, these fries were not a lot of time or effort.  I have made homemade fries before but was always disappointed in the fact that it was impossible to get them crispy!  Or get them to show any character, for that matter.  This recipe was a dream come true.  For my tastes, the amount of seasoning was plenty, but I don't see any problem with changing it up to suit your tastes.  If your fries didn't turn out crispy and delicious, then, yes, you did something wrong.  One thing I did that was not in the recipe was that I let the raw fries soak in icewater for a good 10 minutes and I even thought about throwing some ice in the batter (many restaurants do this and it works).  I figured the ice soak would be plenty, though and after taking them out of the ice bath, I laid them out on a paper towel to soak up the water before throwing them in the batter.  I threw a couple at a time into the fryer and then after they had been in there about a minute, I used a metal fork to stir them up and separate them.  Worked great for me!  My husband just used catsup for dipping but I went with ranch.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again and again!!!  We both loved these restaurant-worthy fries!

3 stars for the fries as didn't care for the flavor of garlic/onion. HOWEVER!! The taste worked great for mushrooms! Crispiness was lacking even though I fried appr. 8 minutes.

These were really good.  It is more time consuming than regular fries but not too bad.  I used my large deep skillet and put about an in ch of oil in the bottom.  I dropped the fries in one at a time slowly and was able to get quite a few fries in the skillet at a time.  I did have to use a fork to break them up at times in the beginning.  I let them fry for about 30 seconds and then stirred them ever so often until they were done.  They had a nice thin coating of the batter when they were finished that was crisp and very tasty.  They were nice for a change from the regular old fries.  Great recipe.

Loved the batter of this recipe, as it did provide a very crispy french fry, but I hated the mess! LOL. That's probably my hubby's fault, as he was manning the deep fryer and is a VERY messy cook :) I can't wait to try this on other things, like onions or other veggies. Oh, and I used beer in place of the water, as we both love anything that is beer battered!

I loved this recipe and had decided to use it after reading the great review's.I noticed that some people had said it took to long to make alot for big familys and wanted to mention that you could pre pepare these by simple dipping them and setting the on a cookie sheet or oven liner pan (if you have a big freezer) once they have froze up some maybe 30 min you can put them in a zippy bag for another time or you could redip and freeze for extra extra crispy fries theis way it like getting the bags at the store.

By far the best fries I've ever made!  I considered all suggestions and this is what I did...all my 5 boys and hubby loved them!  Instead of water, I added coors light until batter drizzled off my spoon(only beer in fridge) and due to the lack of seasonings I had, I used 2 tsp of Greek seasoning, 1 tsp Johnny's season salt, 1 tsp regular salt.  I had the batter in a tupperware bowl and put cut fries in, covered bowl, and shook them until they were coated.  I fried them separately using tongs in Canola Oil until golden brown.  Laid them out on paper towels.  I used as many potatoes until batter was gone and that fed our family of 7 with leftovers.  Crispy, great flavor, not that greasy.  You can really have fun with different seasonings.  I'm sold and will not buy frozen fries again.  Thank you!

I didn't measure things, and opted for the oven method. Pretty good, though mine didn't turn out crispy. My husband and little boy both loved them.

This was one of the best tasting fries I've ever had, my husband agrees. It was a very simple recipe, easy to follow and came out perfect every time. The only thing I have to say about it is that since the potatoes are soaking in water the batter will continue to get thinner and thinner. To combat this I just added a little more of the dry ingredients every so often. This was the first time I've ever made them and I intended on using them as a side for dinner. They were so good that I just continued to make them and ended up eating them as dinner.

These were amazing! The only thing I added was cajun seasoning to the batter. My husband and I were skeptical that we could make french fries from home that actually tasted decent...these were restaurant worthy, actually better than most I have had when out to dinner or lunch! Fabulous recipe!

tried with sweet potato fries cut to width of fingers, fried plain for a minute then dipped in batter (1 cup flour, garlic salt, paprika & cayenne to taste mixed with enough water to make syrup-consistency batter - 1/2 cup water?)& fried again for about 3 minutes (until golden brown)- much better than plain sweet potato fries - haven't had luck getting crispy sweet potato fries until now - thanks for the awesome (but fattening) recipe! also tried freezing the left over cooked fries - will pull them out & bake them another night, should be great.

I LOVED these fries.  I made them with Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from this site and they were amazing.  The hubby loved them too!  I didn't find it to be that much work.  While the oil was heating up I coated the first fries, then it wasn't much work to drop the fries individually into the oil.  While that batch was cooking I coated the next batch, etc, etc.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was very hard to keep the cooked fries hot.  By the time all of the fries were cooked most of them were cold.
I did add seasoning salt to the batter and cajun spice rather than paprika.  Overall I really loved the flavor and crispness of these fries!

not sure what happened!  I followed the recipe exactly, and added the potatoes to my deep fryer once temp got to "fries".  They stuck to each other, despite my placing them single layer in the bottom of the basket!  They were a clumpy mess, however, the taste was pretty good!

I was making hamburgers for lunch for my 2 boys and a friend of theirs.  When I realized I didn't have frozen fries I pulled up this recipe and threw them together.  It probably took me 20 minutes.  (I only made half of the recipe).  The boys loved them!!!  My husband walked by and plucked one off the plate and raved about how awesome they were.  I didn't alter the recipe at all.  I think that if I were to make this recipe a habit I may have to consider the baked version instead of the fried version.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I didn't have onion salt, so I added extra salt and small dehydrated onions. WOW! Excellent choice. These fries were UNBELIEVABLE. I don't even care for fried foods, but couldn't get enough. I used the left over batter to make ONION RINGS and my  husband said they were the best he has ever had, and he is an onion ring conoisser! :) MAKE THESE FRIES!!

The first successful, delicious fries I have ever made!
I added a generous greek seasoning (prepackaged at the grocery in a yellow container)to these and it added a lot of flavor.  
Keep your fries thin and your oil hot.
Also made incredible onion rings!

These were pretty good.  I made them with seasoned salt instead of plain old salt and I think I would have preferred more salt in the batter (maybe another half teaspoon).  Although they were a bit messy to make, they were a nice change from regular old fries

I tried these first by baking them and they were horrible! They came out very mushy and the taste was very unpleasant. So I had some batter left over and thought I'd give them a try using my deep fryer, this way they turned out great!!! Very crispy and full of flavor. They are time consuming, but worth the effort from time to time, deep fried only though for me.

I would make sure to slice the potatoes thin, because with the thicker ones they take too long to cook all the way through. I used beer instead of water, nice touch. Needs more flavor, will add more pepper, red pepper or paprika to give it more kick.

I didn't like these. The coating was great but, since the recipe says to put the fries in one a time, the frying times were different and it's hard to keep track of the ones you put in first so I found that many of the fries where not totally cooked. All in all, not that great. To each his own I guess!

This was my first attempt at making my own fresh cut french fries and with this recipe they turned out perfectly, just the way I wanted them...crunchy and crispy on the outside and fluffy light on the inside!  I added some seasoned salt and used garlic and onion powder with a few dashes of white and cayenne pepper.  I replaced some of the water with beer, and I loved the flavor!  Can't wait to make them again!

Good just not great. I would recommend mixing up the flour/spices/water mixture in a bowl and then put it into a ziplock bag. As the other reviews make sure to put each potato in the oil 1 at a time or they will stick together..you will have a french fry pancake if not.

My hubby loved these.  I like the fact that it is versatile.  Sometimes we will add some Cajun spices.  Yum!

This was my second time making these fries and my family loves them!! I use Seasoned Salt instead of the seasonings and they taste great. I'm going to try them with a mix of Zucchini and sweet potatoes next time to sneak some vegetables into my kids.  :-)

I made these last night for my family - I had to cook them much longer than stated in the recipe, which was totally no biggie since I had anticipated that from the other reviews.  We thought they were OK, nothing to write home about.  However, we did agree that using the batter on onion rings would have been a far better choice than using it on the potatoes.  The *picky eater* (our 6 year old) did come back for seconds, so that is the reason for the 4 stars.  I would have given it 3, but like I said, if it is tried on onion rings I think that it would be ALL of a 5 star recipe and more!!!!

Yum!  Cooked on electric stovetop medium in frying pan with old vegetable oil. Thinned the batter.  Soaked potatoes in cold sugar water and gave a quick pat dry.  Super Yum!

Very good, not greasy, nice and crunchy, very nice taste. Good job, nice recipe, add some more spices to it if you like it more hot. If you like it more plain, then keep it as it is. Overall simple and very good recipe. Peace.

OH MY GAWD!  They are so addicting! really super easy too make also.  I used the same batter mix and dipped a chicken breast in it.  It's great for making buffalo wings too. After you have cooked the wings put them in a bowl and add your spicy sauce mixture.  Very versatile recipe!

These are great!  I have a daughter who thinks french fries are a food group and she just loved these.  I read the reviews before I proceeded and decided to cut my potates with a crinkle cutter and then pat them dry with paper towels.  I dipped them in the batter, placed them in the deep fryer and 7 minutes later they were done.  I did have to use more than 1/2 cup of water because the batter was just paste but otherwise there was no problem.

Pretty Good! Kids loved 'em.  The batter will thin towards the end as you add the potatoes that have some water residue on them, so make sure they're pretty dry.

Heidi and Alex arrived in Bend Oregon to see Noelle around 8:30 pm with potatos fresh from Boise Idaho! So we decided to look online for a french fry recipe. We found this recipe and decided it sounded delicious!! After buying the seasoning ingredients the next day at Fred Meyers, we began our french frying journey. Heidi began the excursion by peeling the potatos and cutting them into wonderful strips of fries! After a false start, Noelle and Alex (sifting queen) made the seasoning sauce, adding two more cups of water than stipulated. The frying process began, assembly style, and lasted for about an hour. By the time the last potato was fried, the original fries were cold, and no longer crispy. We attempted to put them in the microwave, only to find them soggy, and not crispy. The taste of our final product was not bad, but this is nothing to "write home" about. We constantly questioned whether we were doing it correctly. Overall, too much oil, too long of process, and the potatos were not cooked.

Not good at all.  The batter kept just falling off in the oil, so what I got were mushy fries with no crispiness to them at all.

This recipe is time consuming and messy, but very good.  I wouldn't make them regularly for just us three, but would make for a cookout with friends.  I had better luck keeping them crunchy draining them on a rack with a paper towel under the rack.

These were good, though mine were not very crispy.  I am a fairly inexperienced fryer, though, so that may be the problem.  I reheated the leftover ones with some shredded cheddar the next day, then I promptly inhaled them. ;)

Very good! My fiance loved them. However, they were a little messy while making them. I will indeed make them again. When I do, I will heat two pans of oil and make two batches at a time. They sat and got a little soggy as I was preparing other courses for the meal. Thanks for the recipe!!

This will give you crispy fries. You can spice it to your liking. I used garlic powder instead of salt. Cayenne pepper would be a nice addition if you like spicy fries.

Came out great.... did add some Cajun seasoning about 1 tsp. Made some grilled chicken and veggies ( green beans , carrots and corn). My boys ate it up along side some choices of dipping sauces like BBQ, ketchup and ranch.

OK so I tried this and the seasoning batter just slipped right off the potatoes as they cooked. Needless  to say mine look nothing like the pictures lol I' super bummed out about it. I'm letting them cook longer to at least get crunchy well-cooked fries.

Made as recipe suggested except added cayenne and seasoned salt,  as well as more water to batter.  They were amazing!  My husband was blown away!  Took some to my neighbors and they proclaimed me "The best French Fry maker in the Land!"

The garlic and onion taste was too overpowering. I’ll use less next time or just use different seasonings.

I wanted to make lunch for my entire family entirely by myself, and not my mom. I wanted to make Spaghetti and Fries, so I’ve used a recipe for fries that I used before, and they still turned out good! (P.S. For the spices of the fries, I only used Old Bay, cuz it’s a Maryland classic ;P)

These are delicious.  I used shortening instead of oil. (No, shortening no longer contains trans fats.)
Next time I am adding a little cayene to the batter, but they were good just as written.

These were really crunchy but needed a little more flavor. Next time I’ll try to add more spices and use half as much flour. I ended up with a lot of wasted floor. Overall, really good and is very similar to a beer battered taco coating!

My son and I loved these. My husband, not so much. He said the batter made the fries more like a "potato tempura". He likes naked french fries. The fries were very crisp and the flavor of the batter was great. No need to season afterward. I placed the fries on a cookie rack over a pan to catch dripping oil. Will need more than the 1/2 cup of water to get the batter to the right consistency. Like others have said, dry the potatoes well before you put them in the batter. Great recipe!

Made recipe as stated. It was just as crispy as tasty as the recipe stated it would be. I almost, that's ALMOST felt guilty about eating these. Next time, i'll play with the seasonings and experiment, but these were great as is.

What a great concept!  I didn't have flour so I substituted with pancake mix and added the seasonings to taste.  I soaked the potatoes for aesthetic purposes and then poured the batter on the fries after draining the water.  I let them sit in the batter and put a few fries in the oil at a time.  They did stick together a bit but not too much.  I broke them apart gently with a fork.  My daughters ate all of them without ketchup, which they never do with fries.  They always make fry sauce, but not with these!  I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely make these again!

I liked the tip about making a thinner batter in a plastic container with a lid for shaking and using tongs, that was helpful. I altered the spices using A1 dry rub seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, ground dry mustard, salt and pepper. I recommend pulling out a handful or two of potatoes and letting the water drain off for a couple minutes before battering them, and put them in one at a time with the tongs. They didn't even need ketchup, they were so good. I had enough cut potatoes for a large mixing bowl, rinsed them several times before proceeding further and still had a little batter left over.

These were an UTTER DISASTER! First, WAY too much paprika. I just sprinkled it over the batter. I used granulated garlic powder and onion powder without the salt, then added kosher salt, cayenne, black pepper and parsley.

I followed the video to the letter, but the fries stuck to the bottom of the fryer like glue. The end result was a hard, semi- gelatinous mess with under-cooked potatoes. I drained them, placed them on a sheet pan and baked them, then ate them as home fries. Next time, I will just cut fresh potatoes as shown, soak them in SALT water then just fry them, dry them, then immediately place in a paper sack with the seasoning I used mentioned above and shake. DONE. No mess.

Glad other people liked this recipe but my family did not like it. Potatoes were not meant to  be  breaded. The best way we've learned to make crispy fries is very simple. You par-cook the potatoes either in oil until they are about 3/4 done and remove them to drain the oil but are not browned. Alternatively, you can microwave the potato until it's about 3/4 cooked before cutting into fries. Then you put them into 350 degree oil until browned and crispy. Use seasoned salt or sea salt immediately after removing the fries from the oil before they drain the cooking oil completely. Works perfectly every time.

Wondeeeeeeeerful! Everybody loved it!! They really couldn't have enough! My father called it addictive. The only thing I recommend is to follow the recepie and put the potatos one by one. I tried (with my laziness) to put it all in the batter and the potatos started to release its water, so I had to add a little more flour and returned to the amazing batter from before! Thank you for introducing this greatness in my life haha 
God bless

Solid recipe!  I didn't use a sifter because i didn't have one and i kept the potato skins on because i personally really like them, we will definitely make again.. Not to mention i think this batter could work well with a lot of other things.

I made this exactly as the recipe read and my wife and kids couldn't get enough. I couldn't make them fast enough. They were even delicious reheated the next day which is unheard of with most French fries.

Excellent crispy fries. I did increases the amount of spices & the amount of water to a pancake batter consistency. I used the batter for chicken strips too. *****

I've made these a few times already and LOVE them . Excellent recipe -- and my husband thinks so too, which is all that matters anyway, amiright?? I followed the recipe as is, only I added a little salt on the fries just after they came out of the oil. Delish.

Great recipe but absolutely NOT 25 minutes.  I signed up just to comment and let others know this is quite a process. Im sure if I had a deep fryer it be less time-consuming. Other than that, pretty good!

Oh yes!! I LOVE a crispy fry and this recipe did the trick! I added enough water to make the batter the consistency of pancake batter. I put the fries in the oil one at a time as instructed. I still had to break them apart after they were frying for a few minutes. I probably cooked them longer than the recommended time, but I like my fries extra crispy. This is truly a keeper!!

I didn't have the garlic and onion salt so I used a minced clove of garlic and some seasoning salt.

I don't know if I used too much water but the oil was foaming at the top and the fries kept sticking to the bottom of the pan.

It seemed to take a long time and in the meantime I kept the fries in a foil packet inside the oven.

The fries were crispy but it was nothing to write home about.  It was slightly better than my usual batch but not as good as I hoped, according to all the descriptions and reviews.

Will be looking for another recipe.  Cheers.

Great recipe!  I had leftover batter, so I coated some onion rings and fried them after the potatoes. I think they were even better than the french fries. Seriously, try this with onions and you will be amazed.

Loved this! Really quick and easy to make. The fries came out so crispy and had a great crunch almost like a onion ring kinda crunch. Once I took them out of the oil I seasoned them right away with salt so it sticks to the fries, if you add it afterwards it won't stick . I will make this again for sure! So much cheaper then buying them already made.

I don't think I'll ever make french fries any other way ever again!  These were fabulous!  

Not to take away anything from the recipe, I believe it is phenomenal just as is, but here in the South, we like our food heavily seasoned and every home has a can of Tony's Creole Seasoning at the table.  So, based on personal preference only, I will probably add an additional tsp of Tony's and seasoned salt to the batter next time. I also used 1 cup of water in my batter and that worked out just right.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

The fries were crispy and great. Instead of paprika I used lemon pepper, salt, seasoned salt, and garlic salt. And they came out amazing I think I will continue to use the recipe forever.

I used an outdoor propane deep fryer with a big deep pot.  I used the method from another review - mixed the batter in a large tuperware container, then put in the uncooked fries. Then just shook it all of to coat the fries.  I also dropped in clumps of fries then mixed them around after about 10 seconds.  
The only thing I'd do different is use a big pan or tray with paper towels.  I used a bowel and the bottom fries ended up a bit greasy.

Indeed a different way of making chips. The garlic powder and cumin adds an extra twist. I used beer instead of water and very little salt. Will DEFINITELY make them again for a snack.
Used sweet chilli sauce for a dip instead of tomato sauce.

as per another reviewer--I used a deep fryer, added beer (lager) instead of water. For those wondering about dipping each fry separately...thin your batter just slightly @1 Tbsp & put the batter in a medium-sized plastic container with a tight-fitting, well-sealing lid. Add your cut potatoes, seal it up, & SHAKE for @1-2 minutes to coat all the fries. This will evenly coat all the fries w/batter & save  time in dipping them separately. When adding the fries to the hot oil... add them using tongs instead of your fingers... and in SMALL-MEDIUM batches.  I took the tongs "full bunches" & dropped them into the oil, let the batter set up ever so slightly, then separated them by shaking the bunches until they came apart @1 minute into frying. I'm also impatient & while they didn't come out perfectly "solo" fries...the bunches were crisp.!  *USED my deep fryer 375*F. for @ 9 minutes... a nice golden color. Also I ALWAYS use... onion powder & garlic powder... NEVER onion or garlic salt.

I was SO optimistic for these...

I peeled the potatoes, kept in water while my oil warmed and my coating was completed. I dipped my fries in the batter and set on the pan...
Batter cooked but fries remained raw. In total took almost an hour to be done

While mixing the seasonings, I thought the recipe looked way too salty, so I reduced the salt by 1/2.  Big mistake I guess, because they really didn't have any salty flavor at all.  The batter itself needed a LOT more water than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for.  Still, they were very good and my kids LOVED them.  Stayed crispy even the next day :) Tip:  Fry longer than you think to get the crispiness.  My first batch looked golden, I took them out and put them on a paper towel lined plate, and within minutes they were soggy.  My second batch I fried much longer, they were a really dark golden brown color, and this time they remained crispy!!

Will definitely make again.  I admit it took a bit more time to stand over stove and fry compared to the frozen bagged fries but 100% better and kids couldn't eat enough!  Thank you for recipe.

I selected this recipe because they looked good to me , they turned out exactly how they came out in the picture with a few minor changes . My tip to y'all is today has everything you do with the batter , one change I did was I added more flour because the batter seemed to watery , a tip I used is to use more flour rather then more water .

Surprisingly delicious and better than any other method I've used for homemade fries (which isn't often).

I'm from & live in Charleston, SC, so if you know much about this place, you know that we have some fantastic food here.  (Charleston is the #1 tourist destination in America and our wonderful food is one of the reasons.)  

That said, the contributor of this recipe is definitely on the right track.  As with any recipe, it needed tweaking according to our (or anyone's) personal tastes.  We don't generally use recipes.  I found this recipe when I was just looking to refresh my memory for some possible tips to make homemade fries better.  (And to use the potatoes on-hand to keep from wasting them.)   

The picture I attached was taken this morning--the day after making them and refrigerating the leftovers.  They reheat very well for french fries in the oven or a toaster oven.  I wouldn't recommend reheating in the microwave because they won't regain the crunchiness that way.

I have a good bit of leftovers.  Of course they won't be as crunchy, but they're so tasty that we'll probably chop them up a bit and cover with cheese, bacon, onion, butter, sour cream, gravy, or whatever else for a great version of a loaded baked potato with a twist! 

I didn't measure anything but here are a few of my "tweaks" that I either did or will do next time, having learned from this experience.  And there will definitely be a next time on these. 

1.  I don't use a lot of salt and I don't ca

I only used half a cup of flour and just enough water to make a thin paste. Fried up awesome and the flavor didn't even require catchup! Will definitely be making these instead of store-bought

This is the most monotonous way to make fries EVER!! I have to dip each fry into the batter individually, then into the oil but I have to keep them away from each other or they'll stick together. I have to play a game of keep away while it takes me 1 full hour to fry one potato worth of fries (3 or 4 at a time in the oil. )

The taste was decent, the time to cook was way off (over medium to medium low heat it took less than 4 minutes to cook). I had to use 1 1/3 cup of water to get the batter to the right consistency. toward the end, I had 12 fries left, I grew so impatient and seasoned the rest differently and threw them all in at once (no batter)  those tasted better than this recipe.

These fries came out really good thank you so much. One little thing if you add a splash of light beer to the batter it comes out good.  I didn't have onion salt so I added the beer I was drinking.  Thank you again!

The recipe was a good starting point for my boys. My youngest is Celiac ,so I substituted the flour with NAMASTE Gluten Free Waffle & Pancake mix, same amount, 1 cup sifted . I also substituted smoked paprika  instead of the  regular. Substituted Onion salt with onion powder. The boys loved it! When the better half gets home tonight, she will be amazed as well.
Thank you or sharing! RB

These fries were delicious! they made for some great chili cheese fries! Crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside, to reheat them the next day you can microwave if you don't mind them not being crispy but you can toast them in the oven if you like a crunchy fry

The french fries are really good!  I seasoned the batter with seasoned salt, garlic POWDER, onion POWDER and paprika and a touch of pepper - a little; not a like.

I added a little non dairy coffee creamer to the water when mixing.  Potatoes were crispy and delicious!  I made them two days ago and am making them again tomorrow!  You'll be pleased.

My sister put a little baking powder/soda in the liquid mix (I forget which) but hers were even crunchier.  I was happy with mine though and am not going to add them.

Needed 1.25 cups of water and I used olive oil instead because I don't like the idea of vegetable oil - they tasted amazing but the picture I posted may show that they didn't cook as perfectly as some other pictures.  I'm fine with that they were delicious and I will make the same way again.

Thank You for this! I made these tonight and they are fabulous. I like these much better than the frozen fries from the store. I didn't have garlic or onion salt so I used onion and garlic powder. I also added a tsp of pepper. I will definitely be making these again.

Made these tonight, turned out brilliantly. I read some reviews before making and doubled the water called for then decided to take user "pghcraig" advice and after coating the fries in the batter, I froze them on a cookie sheet for about 30 minutes then fried them with vegetable oil brought to 375 degrees for 12 minutes.  Put up a picture with my lettuce wrapped burger.  Perfect.  I was looking for crispy fries & this'll be my new goto recipe.

Did not use garlic salt; used the garlic powder, and used onion powder;  not the onion salt.

These were great!  I did change it a bit, by not measuring the seasonings, and I tossed the potato wedges in the seasoned flour mixture before adding water to make a batter so that it would adhere to the slices better.  I'll try this method for fish and chicken tenders some time as well.  Both my kids ate these, so winner winner in my book.

This is the first time I have made homemade fries and I really shouldn't have because these were DELICIOUS!  I added Tony Casheries to batter and seasoned a ton but the crisp and soft blend was perfection!  Took a long time to do in small batches but so good.

So good! You can even add other things to it to make it taste even more unique, like a little truffle oil on top, or minced fresh rosemary and cracked black pepper. yum! I am saving this one.

Made these and they were delish! Had some left over so I wrapped them up in foil and a couple days later I heated them up in the oven on a cookie sheet and they were as good as the first time.

The batter is bland, cakey, and adds a strange texture to what otherwise would be good fries.  Skip this one.

Will not be making this recipe again. Followed it exactly as written. It took a really long time for us to prepare and make the fries. I had to add more water to the flour to get it to the desirable texture. It was messy and the batter was a bit much. Not curious enough to try again.

Completely love these fries. I never breaded my french fries before until now. They turned out wonderful. I followed your recipe but I didnt have any onion powder or paprika so instead I took 2 tsps of cajun seasoning and added it to the mixture.  Wonderful! My family loves it!

Delicious!! if you have to make more than one batch it's a little time consuming though. Next time I'm going to try the oven like some user's have suggested so that I can get them all in at once. Great recipe!! So crispy and tasty.

Just used this for onion rings.  YUM!!  Cooked in about an inch of canola oil in a cast iron pan. Worked very well. Make sure the entire onion ring is covered or the part that is not covered will cook too fast and burn a bit.

I made these fries last night. I do agree that it does take quite some time to make a good portion. I think I may have had the heat too high for the oil, the kitchen got real smoky real quick. However, the turned out excellent! The larger ones were not completely cooked, next time I will cut smaller fries and lower the temperature on the oil.

These fries are soooo good!!!  Made as directed except I didn't soak them in water, just scrubbed, cut and battered them.  The batter stuck very well and they just pan-fried right up!!  They taste like crunchy mashed potatoes, and I mean that in the very best way!  Thanks for the recipe.  My son wants these fries from now on, no store-bought for him anymore!  I would suggest really letting the batter drip off before placing in the pan.  My first batch had TONS of batter that dripped off the fry but was still connected.  Still delicious, but they looked a bit scary.

The recipe can get a little messy, but it's worth the effort...it really does keep the fries crispy. Adjust the seasoning to your taste, but I thought this was a good starting point which is why I gave it 5 stars.

This was a good recipe...I took the advice of another reviewer and used beer in place of water...made a really nice batter with a good crunch...next time I will play with the seasonings to try and make it a little spicier

My 3 year old daughter is really picky about everything. She loved these french fries. I tweaked the seasonings to my liking, but in the end they came out great. Will make my french fries like this every time.

Took my first run at deep frying coated french fries and based my batter on this recipe. I was out of onion salt so I replaced it with Garlic granules (because my garlic salt is old and didn't want to fight a second ts from the jar), added a dash of Cayenne powder and 1/2 tsp Baking Powder. Even without the Onion Salt the batter tasted way too salty but after deep frying was relieved the salt tasted just about right. The baking powder made the coating just a bit fluffy but still crispy.

It is a good base but needs more flavor.  So I decided to hit them right after they came out of the oil.  Variety  First batch I showered them with garlic salt and pepper, second batch I dusted with chipotle chili pepper and garlic salt, then for kicks on the smaller final batch I hit them up with cinnamon and sugar.  All three were great combos

3.5 it was okay, not bad. There's def something wrong with the water measurement, I ended up using around 1 1/2 cup :/ The fries are crispy but not enough flavor,  will try it again next time.

My whole family loved these french fries.  Good flavor.  I used garlic powder and onion powder instead of salts to cut down on sodium.  Still had great flavor with all the seasonings.

I LOVE how crispy it makes my chips. I joined this site after using it as a guest for so long, just to be able to say I'm glad I found this recipe. To be fair, I used different seasonings, but every recipe I've tried before involved either egg, or milk, or both. I never would have thought to omit them. Thank you Cassie.

We usually make oven fries ^ enjoy them, but for special occasions or for an occasional splurge, want a *great* fry recipe, so we've been comparing french fry recipes from this site from time to time. First off, though we might fry something occasionally, I'm not sure how using a lot of oil to fry either homemade or precut fries is inexpensive. Secondly, IF I were ever going to use this batter again, I'd use just a pinch of baking powder. The fries from this recipe were really pretty decent fries, both when we used hotter temps and lower temps for frying, but not spectacular to us at all. At this point, my family has a strong preference for a modified version of 'French Fried Potatoes' from this site (we simply par-fry the fries for that recipe, and it's a major hit when I actually take the time to make those instead of oven fries). If I were making up fish and chips, I might work on modifying this recipe by baking the fries (mostly because of the cost of the oil and the calories - but also as a time-saver). In that case, battered fries might make sense to us IF I were using this batter for frying fish in a small amount of oil in a skillet and serving fish and chips with malt vinegar (in our family, that is  not likely though - unless we end up with a whole lot of fish since I prefer fish other ways most of the time). These fries were fun to try, but again, in summary, to date, my family actually prefers oven fries or those 'French Fried Potatoes' after par frying them.

Super easy and my wife loved them (making me look like a rock star). I try to add different seasoning in place of paprika for a new flavor everytime.

Awesome!! I just tried this recipe...a little skeptical because of the one review that said they were just "ok"...try them.  They are delicious and SO easy!  You will need more water then just 1/2 cup...I probably used closer to 1 cup, but I also used a white/whole wheat flour blend.  Either way the fries were a huge hit with my family...so crispy and delicious.  IF you want to add some more flavour add about a tsp of Tony Chachere's or some other "all salt" blend, but honestly it is really not needed.  I can't wait to make these again and "wow" everyone with my homemade fries!!

WOW I made these tonight with our hot dogs and everyone went NUTS for them! They went so fast that I couldn't even take a picture! The only thing I did different, since I was out of garlic salt and paprika, i used J&D's Bacon Salt, and it has both of those in it ... and MAN was it amazing! It made an awesome substitute and I highly recommend it for more than just these fries! :) Next time I'll get a photo!

I should give these fries a five, but I'm giving a 4 due to the amount of time they take to prepare. My family loved them. Nice and crispy and soft inside. I didn't have any paprika so I used some chili powder instead. Will make again, but will give myself plenty of time for them.

I was skeptical about battering the fries, but what she said made sense. And oh my goodness were they GOOD!! So easy, and I had a bought a bag of bulk potatoes and had a bunch left over that I wasn't sure what to do with. The kids stood there waiting for the fries to come out of the deep fryer! I couldn't cook them fast enough!

After adding more water to the mix these were great!  So much so, that I hardly got to have any for myself! =(

I cut my fries uniformly and ran them through the batter. Then when I went to fry them, the batter seemed to peel itself right off the fry. It resulted in unevenly coated fries. ;o( I don't know why this happened, and it definitely created the splotchy/uneven appearance of the outcome. The flavor was still there, and it paired nicely with  ranch dressing II on allrecipes.com. I'll try it again,  sometime in the future.

So good and crispy and crunchy...I used red potatoes instead of russet potatoes and it tastes so much better! I also used olive oil instead of regular oil...more purer and I feel less guilty eating these fries! I am so in love with these!

AWESOME!  My whole family loved these!  I followed the recipe directions to a tee and they came out very crisy.  I didn't have garlic and onion salt so I used garlic and onion powder instead and salted the fries when I took them out of the fryer.  I also substituted beer for the water.   I will definitely be making these again!

I actually made this recipe with organic sweet potatoes.  We had veggie burgers and sweet potato fries and these stole the show.  I did fry them because I was already changing the recipe up a bit and didn't want it to turn out to be a disaster but you can bet that next time, we'll be baking these!  They were delicious - I used 4 potatoes and it fed all seven of us (2 adults and our five children) with some left over!  One thing I would recommend is drying the potatoes VERY well if you are going to leave them soaking in water.  I gave ours a quick pat before putting them in the batter but by the end of the potatoes, my batter was a LOT runnier than it was at the beginning.  So just make sure you get ALL excess water off to avoid the same issue!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were seriously the best fries I have ever made at home.  My first batch was burnt instantly due to the fact that I had the oil heated on HIGH.  So I lowered the heat and tried again.  PERFECTION!

These tasted yummy but the look just wasn't right.  I cooked them in the oven as some other reviewers suggested but the batter didn't stick very well.  Next time I think I'll try my new deep fryer

These were sooo yummy! I didn't peel my fries and added 2 teaspoons of cajun seasoning instead of the paprika. I made sure to keep as much as the batter on these fries as possible when moving them to the oil. This batter reminds me of "Long John Silvers." Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very tasty!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was perfect for 4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into french fries.  It is a bit tedious to place each french fry in the oil but it's worth the end product.  Slightly seasoned, crispy french fries without all the expense of frozen ones.  Thank you Cassie for a great recipe and technique!

These fries are super flavorful and easy to make!  We like our fries with a lot of flavor, so I doubled the spice amounts to suit our tastes. I also used a wheat ale instead of water for the batter--yum!!  I don't do a lot of frying, so I undercooked the first couple of batches, until I realized that darker and crispier is better and worth the wait. That's no fault of the recipe, though...just my own inexperience with frying. Now that I know, will save this recipe and make again, for sure. My husband LOVED these, and he's a fry enthusiast. I know they're good when he drown them in ketchup!

YUMMY!!! It took me a little bit to finally get the recipe just right to my tasting. Luckily you can make one fry and tweak the batter, and so on until it tastes perfect. I added Tapatio hot sauce to the batter to give it a little zing. MMM!

This was a really good recipe that made great fries however after only a few fries we were full! That was a great thing for me but my husband thought it was too much so the next time I made them I just used the seasonings and no batter and they were still great! Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

It wasn't bad. It just wasn't outstanding. However my younger brother wouldn't agree with me, he strongly believed them to be very delicious. I suppose I wasn't satisfied with the seasoning--it wasn't very flavorful, just a somewhat crispy-like coating.

These are awesome!! First time I have ever made homemade fries and cannot wait to make them again!! I used my deep fryer instead of the messy stove top cooking and I also used Spike and Greek Seasoning instead of all the salts and black pepper and garlic powder. YUMMY!!

Yep, very good.  No modifications.  They do take awhile in the oil, though - longer than I had anticipated.   Didn't mind having them all stick together so didn't worry too much about putting them in individually.

These are amazing! I'm eating my first batch right now (dipped in ranch dressing)! I just eye-balled my measurements and definitely used way more than 1/2 a cup of liquid. I followed other reviews and used half water, half oil and then baked at 350. They are crispy on outside and soft on the inside! I will try a little thicker batter next time so I don't loose any to the pan. Will use over and over again

I wanted to try a french fry recipe that was good & my family liked.  I tried this one, it was alright.  Not a lot of seasoning (even though I added more than the recipe called for) & it was not as well received by my girls as I thought.   I'll try again, but will adjust the seasoning again.  A fair to good first try.

Very good! I baked. I soaked the uncooked fries in cold sugar water for 4 hours first (heat a small glass of water and stir in 1/3 c sugar, then add cold h20).  then drained the cut fries before cooking.  My seasoned mixture was equal amounts of oil, h20, paprika, 3 tbsp flour, salt, garlic powder, and basil. tossed in a plastic bag.  Baked for 50 minutes, tossed fries every 15 minutes, and added oil as needed.  very tasty!

Without a doubt the best french fries I have ever tasted. My husband was in potato heaven! I substituted Lawry's seasoning salt for the spices (family favorite) and they were sensational.

Very tasty recipe. I think I added to much water because the batter didn't stick that well. But other than that the taste was great. I also added cayenne.

Yummy! These fries are good. :) I deep fried them, and tweeked the recipe a bit. I didn't have garlic salt or onion salt, so I replaced it with a combination of onion poweder/ garlic power and salt. I also used less paprika and some regular pepper.

Great fries!  I followed the recipe but I used the twice fried method.  I dipped them in the batter, then fried them at 340 degrees until they were soft but not golden, removed them and let them drain and cool for about 10 minutes, then I fried them again at 375 until they were golden brown. Seasoned and crispy-perfect!

These fries are excellent.  My super picky hubby usually does not like homemade fries.  He has to have the frozen ones.  With these he really likes them.  I have made these twice and my advice is to use a deep pot instead of a skillet that way you won't get splashed with hot oil.  I ran out of paprika the second time around so I used chili powder instead of the other seasonings.  Turned out great and gave them a bit of a kick.

These were really good!  I added extra  salt and some ground red pepper to put some extra kick to them.  I made the batter thick and coated sweet potatoes (skins on).  The spicy outer coating giving way to the sweeter inside was just excellent!  Fried them at 375 for about 3-5 minutes.

Ohh, these sounded SO good but they just didn't work out well when I made them. I was prepared for a lot of work and a huge mess, but being a fry-worshipper I really didn't care. I followed the recipe (and the suggestions) and just ended up with a gloppy-battery mess. The batter wouldn't stay on the fries and made that whole dipping fiasco pretty pointless. They only stayed crispy if I cooked them until they were nearly burnt. I like my fries 'well done' but no one else was impressed. I'm tempted to try again but I'll probably just get a bag of Texas Crispers and call it a loss.

I used sweet potatoes instead of normal tomatoes and they were really good. I don't think I left the fries in the oil long enough because some weren't as crunchy as others. I would make it again though, very good!

These were really good.  Nice and crispy.  They did take quite a bit longer than the stated 25 minutes, but the end product was worth it.

I just put season salt into the mixture and deep fried them......they tasted great! Next time I will put them in a skillet since the batter stuck to the basket of the deep fryer.

These were *really* good and the kids absolutely gobbled them up.  The thicker fries I cut didn't turn out as well as the thinner ones, so next time I'll be sure to make them nice and skinny.  A keeper!

Easy to make, nice and crisp. Additional seasoning was added due to blandness. Do not recommend for leftovers.

I doubled the seasonings, using onion powder instead of onion salt, but it just lacked flavor for me. A lot of work too, for not such a grand result. If I do try this again, I will try beer instead of water, and add some cayenne and black pepper.

Took me 5 minutes to cut the fries using a frycutter. I cooked the taters in heated peanut oil; it took about 5 minutes at 350 degrees in my highsided cast iron skillet for each batch. After the first batch, I started over by using Pale Ale beer rather than water, 2 teaspoons each of garlic POWDER, black pepper, paprika, onion POWDER and Old Bay Blackened Seasoning, with a dash of ground red pepper and cayenne pepper for a yummy and beautiful batter! We salt our food at the table and dipped these in mayonnaise. This was an easy and fun recipe, but I prefer my spicy and flavorful batter. Thanks!

Home made fries are always better than any fast food place.  The batter on these give them a different twist.  They cook quickly.  I didn't use as much oil as called for, just a few inches in the pan will do the trick.  Using a large slotted spoon for removal is handy.  I mixed all the potatoes into the batter then picked them out one at a time to put into the oil, much faster than dipping each one seperately.  There were no left overs, so that means the family liked them.

There were the best homemade fries I have ever made. They were crispy and crunchy. The family just gobbled them up. I used one cup of water to make the batter moist enough to coat the fries. I also added a little salt when they came out. These are definitly a family keeper.

These were the best fries I have ever made!  Hubby got home late and his fries sat in a warm oven for a hour and a half and he thought they were GREAT!   Took very little time to make (only for the two of us) and they were fantastic! Making them again tonight to go with our bacon bleu cheese burgers...mmmmm, I'm hungry, just thinking about it.

Amazing fries. I'm cooking a second batch now. I combined all ingredients into a large bowl with a lid, tossed dry ingredients, then added cut potatoes. I used my veggie cutter and had them cut in 3 minutes.  Added fries into batter and add more flour as needed, I have added cayenne pepper to this next batch. Can't wait to try them. By far the best recipe for fries. Use a large skillet for the oil..that is the trick.

Just made these this afternoon, for the Super Bowl.  They were a huge hit!  Just one substitution...I replaced the water with beer.  A nice hoppy IPA worked well, but I'm going to try a porter next.

Adding more spices to these makes them very good. As mentioned by others, they take a little effort. A "4" not a "5".

I would recommend doubling the spices, but the batter itself is a great idea. I'm sure it'll be better next time! Thanks for the idea.

SO GOOD!  I just made these (the last batch is frying up as I type!) and they are perfect!  I fried each batch for a few mins (maybe 3-5) & then drained them on paper towels as I made the next batch -- then did each batch again for about 5 mins to make them super crispy!  I will have to keep them warm in the oven until my husband gets home for dinner....if they last that long!

I just made a small batch of these for my kids for dinner (I cut the recipe in half)! What a hit. They are quickly disappearing as I've had my fair share. Thank you for sharing this easy delicious recipe.

MMMM, OH MY! I added more spice to the batter. Then used my fry daddy. Each batch took about 5 minutes to cook. For dipping, I mixed ketchup and mayo together.

We liked them. They were great but too time consuming. I would also recomend adding some pepper and season salt to the batter.

These were fantastic.  My husband and I ate the whole plate (very full).  This is a keeper recipe. I used a electric fryer and it didn't get hot enough so I had to cook for a longer time.  They were still delicious.  I thought putting in one at a time would be a pain, but it went pretty fast.  Thanks for the great recipe. Your cookin friend Karen

Very good. Very crunchy. I was wondering if a beer batter would also work - and I saw another reviewer tried the same so I will also next time. I used my deep fryer and fried in bunches. I also did a batch of seasoned and one not. Both were dalish!  Thanks for the recipe.

Cassie this batter is AWESOME.  I didn't think that something so simply could taste so good!  I added a little more seasoning and deep fried veggies. This recipe will travel with me from here on out!

This was a good recipe.  I didn't use as much salt as recommended.  I didnt measure but used onion and garlic powders, paprika and like a pinch of salt b/c there is enough salt in the ketchup we use to dip the fries in.  This is great for those with high blood pressure bc you can get the flavor w/out all the sodium.  The fries didnt all stay crisp after they cooled but they still tasted good.

Why can't restaurants make fries this good?? It is a bit time consuming because you must watch them like a hawk. But so worth it. I drained them on cooling racks like someone else suggested. Put a cookie sheet underneath to catch the oil.

Wow these are amazing!!  They may not be the healthiest things but so delicious!  I would compare them to Burger King fries only way better!  All I had on hand was garlic powder (used about 1/4 tsp) and salt but we didn't miss the onion or paprika one bit!

Made these in the deep fryer and ended up with a clump of fries, but tasty fries at that!  They were crunchy and had a great flavor.  I did not have paprika on hand, so I used seasoning salt and also added about 1 cup of water instead of 1/2.  Will definitely make again!

Very good the whole family raved (even my picky one). Not as time consuming as some of the other reviews had mentioned. Only thing I was add some more spices. (mix it up a little bit you really can't go wrong w/ this recipe). Compliment to any burger night. I made them w/ "Gyro Style Chicken Souvlaki" sandwiches.

I did two trays of oven chips, these and a version of my own (as I got fed up of dipping)

Honestly they weren't so amazing to warrant spending so much time mucking about dipping/coating each fry with the batter. 

The Homemade ones were seasoned just by lightly drizzling with oil and then seasoning with whatever was to hand and they crisped up fine(Think I went with Salt, Pepper and Paprika but I can't remember). My own were just as tasty, if not more so. 

However I did bake them rather than fry and they cooked so much faster than I expected and I *ahem* burnt them! Therefore they could turn out dandy if someone were more dilligent and efficient.

Overall though, it's far too much effort for too little return methinks. Not to mention the horrid task of washing up afterwards! I'll stick with my lazyman's fries in future.

This is a great recipe. It's a bit time consuming with the "one at a time" thing but so worth it. I did add 1 tsp of pepper, and substituted cajun seasoning for paprika.  My family loved them, will make again!

I made this recipe for my 2 year old son and I couldn't believe how much he ate! He absolutely loved them. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I wasn't very fond of the seasoning combination. I will make it more to my own tastes next time but over all this is a wonderful base

I read a few reviews and agreed before hand that adding Cajun spice instead of paprika suited us. I also substituted seasoning salt for the regular salt since it is always the best seasoning for potatoes. Also, I found that the fries were best if they sat for about 10 minutes and not fresh out of the fryer. Other than that, darn good!

We loved them....we did it slightly different using garlic powder, seasoning salt, and cayenne for a slight kick. I only wish I had used more cayenne as we like our stuff kind of spicy.

Great recipe. We all enjoyed. I don't know what I did wrong but I had to had 1 1/2 c. of water to thin out. Second, I will double seasoning next time.

Great fries!  I just mix 4 tsp of Lawry's seasoning into the flour instead of the paprika, etc since it's basically the same ingredients.  These get eaten faster than I can fry them.

How can you improve upon fried potatoes?  By battering them, of course :)  I thought this was a simple yet pretty tasty recipe.  Definitely follow the directions of placing potatoes in the oil one by one, or you will have clumps o' fries (although that makes it pretty easy to turn them over!)  I used the restaurant Red Robin's seasoning, which had pretty much the ingredients listed here, making it that much simpler.

Very good. I used my deep fryer and placed them in one at a time and tried to space them apart as best as I could. If you shake the basket a little, they won't stick to each other. They came out nice and crispy in about 4 minutes.

This was great! I added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper worked out great! The thinner fries tasted better than the thicker ones!
Italian by Marriage, Country at heart!

This was an awesome recipe.  I have made french fries with a batter before and they were aweful.  This coating was not thick, it made them so crispy.  My fiancee LOVED them.  I just made them last night and he has told everyone about them.  The only change I made was to add parsley and chilli powder.  Would definatley recommend!!!

this was a nice change from the regular fries. I made these to go with the Coconut shrimp from this site.here is what i did; instead of water, i used some of the beer left from the coconut shrimp II and doubled the listed dry seasonings and i also added ground red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of sea salt. this is definitely a keeper. thanks for the post :D

DH figured it was his turn to review a recipe, as he LOVED these crunchy/tender fries.And so; We tweaked the seasonings slightly because we aren't salt people, but otherwise followed the recipe. (We also used Canola oil for frying which takes a little bit longer to heat in the pan).

For those who thought it was a tasty but messy ordeal to make this recipe; set up an assembly line of sorts. One bowl with the drained potatoes, one with seasoned flour, and one dish lined with paper towels, to drain the finished fries on as well as a strainer or whichever utensil you choose to scoop the hot fries out with. If you have enough space to set all these bowls right next to your stove, it's not nearly as messy.

Thanks so much for a great and easy recipe we will use many times over!

Just what I needed after a really bad day! I made them as directed and they were just as good as store bought or restaurant fries. Next time, I'll spice up the batter a little more but overall, a decadent treat after a long day.

These were delicious, the only reason I give them 4 stars is because they make an absolute mess in the kitchen!  Pretty good flavor, however, and the potatoes are nice and hot.  Great recipe! Thanks!

Seasoning was good, but just too greasy for my taste. I may have fried them too long, I don't know. I would suggest keeping the slices larger for more potato-per-bite and less of an oily taste. Will bake next time.

I only made a small batch in the effort to get my 2 year old to eat something but she wouldn't touch them.  But my husband ate all of them!  I tried a few and really liked them.  I think next time I'll make a huge batch and put them in the freezer so we have them on hand.  My husband commented that they are better than the store bought fries since they aren't as greasy.  Great recipe!

The oil I used wasn't hot enough and it ended up creating greasy, soggy fries. It was probably greasier than just plain potatoes since the batter soaked up a lot of the grease too. If I were to cook it again I would use a lot more seasoning and bake it instead of deep frying.

These fries are great. The taste and the texture are amazing. You can change the seasoning to your taste too!! The only downfall is they take a lot longer than regular fries to make.

These were so good but I had the same problem others did. This makes a lot of fries and there is no way to keep them all crispy until dinner is on the table. Right out of the oil, they are fantastic. I put them in a warm oven too but it didn't help at all. I even tried microwaving quick before serving and nothing but hotter potatoes. Maybe it would help to put under the broiler in a single layer before serving? I wish there were something you could do but short of serving right away while you're finishing the rest of the potatoes and eating dinner after your family, I don't see how they could stay crispy. Very good though.

I would give these 4 stars for the flavor. However, because you can only cook a few at a time, by the time you have enough for your servings, the fries are no longer crispy. I tried an earlier suggestion of putting them on a rack in a warm oven, but it didn't help. I won't be making these again. Thanks though.

I didn't have Russet potatoes (not something most Idaho-residing folks would be admitting to!), so I used the reds that I had on hand, and I cut them into half-moon shapes (cut the spuds in half lengthwise, and then into ½-inch pieces). I added about 1 tsp of seasoning salt to the batter. The first two pans' worth (one batch made five pans of fries for me) turned out so-so, the heat was too high and I had to lower it. The last three pans... YUMMY!

this recipe is good. I have never thought of using the batter as a technique to make it crunchy, now m glad i know bout it. But the only problem is since i dont get to cook them altogether, the first finish products become cool already n doesnt taste crunchy anymore. I'll just fry them all together to reheat for last!

I'll just add a few things. Yes, you do need a bit more water & if your using a fryer, rather than a pan, start with NEW OIL or the crispy texture can be hard to obtain. Otherwise a solid recipe.

I made these for my kids, they had great potential but needed a little more zip in the seasoning, we added essence of emeril, red pepper powder, salt, black pepper and garlic.

These taste GREAT but I have to downgrade the rating for the fact that my husband doesn't want to make them again because of the mess and the clumping factor (he's the deep fat fryer in the family).  If you use a fry daddy (even a big one), it is very difficult to keep the fries separated even adding them one at a time.  Perhaps using a skillet with a wider surface, as in the recipe, will help, but we prefer to deep fry in a fry daddy because it's so much easier to control the temperature.  Regardless, if you don't mind the trouble of cooking them, you, your family and your guests will really like them.

This is a great recipe!  My boyfriend usually salt-and-peppers everything to death, and he LOVED these fries and didn't add any additional seasoning to them when he tried them.

These were pretty good.  I thought they could use a bit more spicy flavor though. I had to use more water than called for.

Wonderful tasting recipe! Standing over the fries for 45 min was a little too long for everytime my kids want fries. Fantastic once in a while fries!

I tried making these last night.  I made two batches, and realized it really wasn't worth the effort required.  Maybe with more kick to them.....I'll stick to the frozen fries if I want batter dipped fries again.
