This recipe is very similar to Betty Crocker's only it is best to bring honey and molassis to a boil (stir continuously) and then let it cool to room temp. first otherwise, your molassis and honey don't blend properly making for a rock hard cookie (I know, I tried the recipe!!!) My mom and I made Betty Crocker's and it came out fine...... so remeber boil honey and molassis first!!!

They had too much of a molasses flavor and not the typical lebkuchen flavor.  I also baked them at 350 for 12 minutes - definitely not long enough.
