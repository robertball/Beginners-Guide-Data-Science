This is a great recipe! I wasn't so sure at first, but the next day it was even better. It is great with a little butter on each slice. Yum! I'll make this again.

This is delicious! Very moist, and even better the next day warm with butter on it. It is easy to make, does take a little time, as do all yeast breads, but worth it. I get a lot of requests for it, and for the recipe. Also, instead of the potato flakes and boiling water, if you have a cup of left over mashed potatoes, that works well too. Instead of mixing the mashed potato flakes with the water, I add the water with the wet ingredients, and the flakes with the dry. It works well that way.

Sorry, but a 5 star means make it for company and make it frequently for the family.  This recipe was just sweet bread with sugar on top.  Basic homemade buttermilk bread would be an equally good gift, and makes a great morning treat toasted with cinnamon suger.  If you want sweet, make a coffee CAKE.  If you want bread, make bread.  This is good, but not a show stopper.

I made the recipe as directed, but I had to mix the ingredients with a spatula during the first few minutes in the bread machine because the flour was just sitting on top, probably because of the potato mixture. I wasn't sure when to add the potato mixture, so I added it after the wet ingredients. I only had to let it rise 45 minutes in a warm oven. Wonderful texture and flavor, and not too sweet. It smelled so good while baking, that I couldn't wait for it to cool to have some, so I ate a piece warm with butter on it. Delicious! Tastes a lot like Hawaiian bread.
