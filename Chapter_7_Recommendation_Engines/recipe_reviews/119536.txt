Wonderful!  I added hot sauce to the melted butter and a dash of cayenne to the breading to give them a 'buffalo wing' flavor - yum!!!  Definitely a keeper.

The best baked chicken nuggets i have had in a while.  I marinated them in buttermilk for a few hours first and then followed the recipe exactly.  I made these as an appetiser for my daughters 4th birthday party and the adults and kids loved them!! Thanks-you for the recipe.

These are easy, delicious, and a hit with my picky kids!  We used melted  "Smart Balance" instead of butter, but other than that we changed nothing!  This recipe is my four year olds' favorite meal!

This was a quick easy and tasty meal.  I like the idea of making my own nuggets, that way I know what I'm getting :) I followed the recipe to a T. These had real good flavor and were moist and tender. Thanks for a good basic easy recipe.

Made these along with some other appetizers to bring to a friends house, and wasnt really interested in eating them myself.  After a couple compliments I tried them for myself and though they arent great I found myself back in the kitchen for more all night.  Good basic recipe, easy too!

These were great little nuggets. I didn't use the parmesean because my husband doesn't like it, but overall this was a great-tasting simple recipe!

I've never felt compelled to write a recipe review before. But these were fantastic!   I've recently become a full-blown enthusiast for wholesome, organic, healthy, slow-cooked food and as a mother, am steering my family that way. My 5-year-old son has been asking for chicken nuggets and I told him we would make it rather than buying them at McDonalds. This seemed like the easiest recipe and I had all the ingredients.  My 3-year-old and 5-year-old sons and I formed a little assembly line to measure and pour, then dip, dip and coat the chicken. Quick and fun. And the food: absolutely delicious.   The nuggets were tender and flavorful. My kids kept asking for more and they are your typical picky eaters. We served with a side of honey dijon and ranch dressings for dipping. They even had me peel and slice apples to match Mcdonalds' apple dippers - except I had them dip their apples in honey rather than caramel.   My husband raved about the food. We ate ours with brown ride and mixed vegetables. Then the kids made sure I packed some leftovers for their lunchbox. A smashing success. This will become a regular in our household. Thanks for posting!

My husband, dad, and I liked this change up to boring old chicken. However, mine was a little soggy on the bottom, could have been crisper for me (Probably something I did) I think this would be a flavorful coating for chicken parmigian.

Finally I know what to cook when my family asks for chicken nuggets. Whatâ€™s more these are healthier since they are not fried but baked. For an even lighter dish replace butter with a couple of beaten eggs. I have tried the same recipe with drumsticks. I have just increased baking time to 35-40 minutes. YUMMY!

these are yummy nuggets, although i think the seasoning is a little strong for the kiddos.  i served these at a kids party, and many of the kids were just picking at them.  the basil taste is very strong, however i think they're quite good.  i think i'd like to try them with panko crumbs next time.  thanks!

Very easy to make.  These are a healthier choice compared to the fried chicken nuggets.  They tasted great.  I used the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and added in some garlic powder.  Also I dipped the chicken in skim milk instead of the butter.  I didnt have the other spices so I used what I had and it turned out great.  I will be making these for years to come I am sure.

These are so, so good.  I've made them a few times. All my picky eaters eat them happily.   I always skip the thyme, as I think it would turn off my kids.  Sometimes I cut the chicken into tiny, popper-sized pieces, which my kids think is fun.  I've used much less butter than called for and they still come out wonderfully.  I've found that my family prefers them very crispy, so I crank up the oven heat for the last five minutes, which really crisps them up.  Next time I'll try the other reviewer's suggestion and dip them in skim milk instead of butter, which would seriously cut the calories.

Thanks for this simple, delicious recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I didn't have all of the supplies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I used crackers (crushed up) instead of bread crumbs.  I also used egg beaters instead of butter because I like how eggs help the coating stick to the chicken so well.  I also didn't have parmesan, so I just kept those out.  I think this was a pretty solid recipe that can have adjustments made to it and still turned out well.

Easy to make...adult and kid friendly, too!  I cut the amount of butter in half and added a little olive oil instead to save on calories and saturated fat.  These were a big hit!

I thought there was slightly too much paprika flavor, so I would halve that the next time I make it.  I also ran out of the butter and bread crumb mixture, so I would use more.  Overall though, it was good and I would make it again!  It looks super easy to adapt the flavors for other spices/herbs.

I didn't get a "crisp" coating, but I gave them a 4 for ease of prep and taste. I tend to stay away from chicken breast because it dries out so easily, but I had some on hand and this was a quick, easy way to use it. The nuggets were moist and my hubby thought they were good.

These were pretty good.  My kids love the idea of having chicken nuggets for dinner.  I think they would eat them no matter how they were prepared.  These had a different flavor with the herbs and parm cheese.  It was a nice change.

We thought these were pretty good.  I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I used seasoned bread crumbs so I didnt add the herbs.  The only problem I had was the coating not staying on the nuggets when we went to eat them.  All in all they were pretty yummy!

I have tried SO many baked nugget recipes over the years and none of them have been good enough to eat twice, so I didn't have high expectations here. I'm so glad I gave them a try! These are so, so good. Can't wait to make them again :)

I dipped these into NANCI RENN's 'Honey Mustard Sauce'.

These were great!  Some might find the thyme flavor is a little stronger than the other seasonings, but is easy to cut back to taste.  The recipe made quite a bit; enough for 4-5 people and no complaints or leftovers.

I made these in less than 15 minutes. They were soo good! I didn't have any parmesean cheese on hand, so I substituted with dry mashed potato flakes and they turned out wonderful. So much tastier and healthier than fried nuggets. Will make again.

Simply amazing. I will absolutely make these again. I used panko bread crumbs in place of ordinary ones. I was tempted to add some garlic, but decided to follow the recipe and am so glad I did. These were really good. To try and reduce fat I may substitute olive oil in place of the butter next time, but otherwise will leave as is.

This was my first time ever making chicken nuggets, and I was seeking something baked instead of fried. This totally worked. I used beaten eggs instead of butter, and they were a bit dry, but still had good taste. I also used italian seasoning instead of the individual seasonings, and I made my own breadcrumbs using the Toasted Breadcrumb recipe from this site. I think that the parmesan makes a big difference. My son (a big McDonald's chicken nugget lover) loved them, and that makes me happy. With sliced apples and barbecue sauce, it's the same but healthier!

I was trying to find a new way to serve chicken and this was great. Two breasts of chicken fed 2 adults and an infant. Be sure and try the ANCHO HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE on this site too. It goes perfectly with this dish!

MMMMmm! Tonight was the first time I've ever made baked chicken nuggets, and it will definitely not be the last. I made my own breadcrumbs, then made my son plain nuggets with salt only. Then I made mine with basil, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I didn't have parmesean or paprika and I still think they were amazing. When my son ate an entire chicken breasts worth of nuggets and asked if he could have more, I knew this recipe was a keeper. Thank you for a healthier alternative to the deep fried nuggets my son is so fond of. :)

These were good! We did half dipped in egg and half dipped in olive oil. The oil ones were better, more 'fried' after baking. The egg ones were fine...but I mashed them into the breadcrumb mix (thinking more coating the better) and they were dry. For dipping we used mustard, BBQ sauce, and ranch.

These were absolutely amazing.  I doubled the recipe for my son's 4th birthday party and they were a huge hit for both the adults and the kids.  Everyone said they were the best chicken nuggets they'd ever tasted.  Thanks for the recipe!

We have switched our family to a healthier eating lifestyle and my 9 year old was "dying" for some fast food chicken nuggets.  I found this recipe and liked the fact they are baked and not fried and my family ate them up!  Even my picky 9 year old had seconds!  I will definitely make this one again.

Amazingly good, I must say.  I used a baking sheet instead of a pan and it worked fine.  I also had a ton of leftover butter so I think 1/2 cup butter would be plenty.

Followed the recipe except reduced thyme to 1tsp.  Seemed too salty for my taste and was not crunchy at all, the coating was very mushy.  However, my husband sort of liked them.

These chicken nuggets turned out great. They had a wonderful complex flavor that wasn't overpowering but gave them that special something that set them apart from frozen processed chicken nuggets. My husband hates chicken nuggets, but took these as left overs to work the next day! More time consuming then dumping them out of the plastic bag, but well worth the time.

The taste was good; I'd say too heavy on the thyme and they weren't very crispy.  But the overall flavor is good; I'll probably try again and make a few adjustments.

VERY good recipe! My husband and daughter inhaled these!. I drained them on paper towels after cooking to get rid of some of the grease and then put them back in the oven for a couple of minutes to get a bit more crispy. Next time I may roll them in olive oil and then the bread crumbs to make them more healthy but other than that, it's a keeper!

I made this with boneless, skinless thighs and they were nice and tender. This is an easy and good recipe, but for my taste was too heavy on the herbs. I also used parmesan from the bag (the type that is more shredded than grated). The powder version in a shaker would have incorporated better, but I don't like the taste of it. If you want to use Parmesan, the best idea would be to get a block and grate (not shred) your own.

I like Italian, but I have to be in the mood for it. These were a bit too Italian for my taste.  I calmed them down a bit with some spray margarine, so they won't be wasted, but I think next time I'll leave out the thyme.

Soooo good I changed the recipe a little. I had no Paprika so I used a teaspoon of Cayanne, used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs and my parmesan cheese was not fresh. They still turned out great. Best Chicken Nuggets I've ever had, by far!

I think it was the bread crumbs that I didn't like, they were soggy.  I had it with the Honey Mustard Sauce recipe from this site and that's what saved the chicken.  Don't think I would've been able to get it down without it.  Sorry.
