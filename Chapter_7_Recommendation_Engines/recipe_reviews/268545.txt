It was really good.  We used it to stuff a turkey at Thanksgiving and everyone enjoyed it.   Adding the fresh celery and onion gave it a bit of texture that made it seem like it was made from scratch.  I'll definitely make it again!

I used bell peppers instead of celery.

It came out great. I used ground pork  and added some salt & pepper. It was flavored by the stove top stuffing mix. I will make it again.

This was a delicious and easy addition to our Thanksgiving dinner! I prepped the vegetables the day before and used one box of turkey mix and one of cornbread.
