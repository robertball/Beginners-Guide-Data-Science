My hubby is the cook in the family but is working long hours lately. So I've been given "dinner duty", having not cooked anything more than boxed Mac 'n Cheese, Instant Oatmeal and boiling water. This recipe was easy to follow, looked and smelled great and made 8 delicious Chimmies!  My hubby is from New Orleans and likes food with "character" and he was VERY satisfied as well as my 11 year old daughter! EXCELLENT!

This was an excellent dish and made easier when I prepared the ingredients ahead of time  for a large gathering.  I shredded the meat from a rotisserie chicken and made Mexican rice and beans from scratch earlier in the day, then assembled and baked the chimichangas  later.   So yummy!  You can adjust  the seasoning from mild to spicy.  A big hit with everyone  served with extra salsa, sour cream, cheese, cilantro and a salad.

I made this last night, it was good. I used regular white rice instead of the spanish rice since I dont like peppers. My family liked it, my dad liked alot without the tortilla. We did burritos instead and we thought it was still pretty good.

Everyone chowed down! In the future I’ll make more. I made my own Spanish rice, but other than that, I followed the recipe. However, they were fully baked in 12 minutes.

We loved this recipe!  I did use Rotel as some users did since I had it on hand.  I used a Mexican rice recipe on this site.   Delicious and crispy!    Just as good reheated!  Definitely a Keeper!

Used Taco Rice by Knorr not sure if that made any difference but this was very good.     Husband really enjoyed them.    Next time I may melt more cheese on top along with more salsa or salsa verde.

A real hit with the entire family...and fairly easy to boot.  Only change I made was to add a can of black bean to the chicken and rice mix.  Will definitely make it again.

I made it just like the recipe. I think I will add fajita chicken next time. But really good with the extra cheese, sour cream, tomato, onion, and lime on top

My picky husband loved it.  It made 5, but it easily could have been 6 or 8.  We each ate 1 and were a little too full.  I used a mexican cheese blend and spanish yellow rice and it was perfect.  It's in our regular rotation now!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe completely other than adding a little cayenne for a bit more kick. Topped with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. This is definitely being added to the rotation.

These are SO good made exactly as is (we’ve made them so many times now I just eyeball how much salsa, cheese, etc). We make them every time we go to Costco and can pick up a rotisserie chicken! So easy and perfect every time.

Simple and delicious recipe that you can customize with so many diferent ingredients. I added black beans for the first one and plan to add some diced tomatoes and sour cream on the next one. I think baking for 20 minutes at 425 is too long, probably better to check its doneness around 15 minutes.

This was a great recipe!  I was cooking for six, but it ended up making enough for two dinners for all six of us. I changed it up and made it with 2 cups of diced rotisserie chicken, one 15 oz can of drained black beans, one 8.5 oz Seeds of Change Spanish rice and quinoa packet, 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese and one 24 oz jar of Safeway medium garlic salsa. I didn’t add any spices because there was already spices in the rice and salsa. It made fourteen 4-5 inch chimichangas. Everyone loved the chimichangas!

I love this recipe! I went to the local Mexican restaurant and bought white cheese dip to top them with. I highly recommend that. I also made pico with tomato, cilantro, onion, lime juice, and green onion. Very delicious and easy to make!

These are so delicious! A very easy recipe, too! My husband loved these and they reheat nicely for leftovers. I think they might even do well frozen but I haven’t tried that just yet! All in all, a great recipe!

Used chicken breasts boiled in chicken stock and package of taco seasoning mix. Made as directed. Topped with additional cheese, salsa and sour cream. These were very tasty.

I used baked chicken strips and cut them up myself, but other than that, everything else was great!

Next time I would reserve some of the broth I cooked the chicken in and air to the rice, cheese & chicken mixture just for a bit more juiciness. I’m also curious about how it would taste with a different cheese blend.

Otherwise, it was delicious and very filling! 

I served it with the Corn, black bean & avocado salad recipe (black bean and corn II) by Candace.

Delish! I didn’t change a thing, although I boiled my own shredded chicken, which added a bit of extra zing (boneless chicken thighs, onion, garlic, cumin, dried chili). Topped with sour cream, cilantro, avo, and lime. Made four nice sized chimmies.

Simple and delicious. I used pork instead of hamburger (it's what I had) and it came out great. I broiled them for the last 2-3 minutes of baking to brown the tortillas nicely.

I made this and loved it.  I hesitate to order Chimi's in a restaurant as I try to stay away from fried food.  This is an amazing substitute.  I used chicken breast mixed with my own homemade taco seasoning.  I added plain rice, black beans and salsa.  It was great.  I forgot the cheese and next time I'll try adding that.

This was surprisingly simple and a people pleaser.  The other thing I like about this recipe, is that you can alter the ingredients in the burrito shell, making it versatile.   Spice it up, spice down....I look at this as a blueprint that is a basis for many different variations.  And it is easy.

Everybody in my family LOVED them.  Have made them twice now in a week.  Great the next day if you have leftovers.  Heated up a bit in the microwave and then fried in the frying pan to crisp them up.  Froze some of the leftover mixture since I did not have enough shells and the mixture was good to use again. EXCELLENT!

I made it exactly per the recipe. Except that I didn't have any parchment paper. I oiled a baking sheet and it worked fine. I slow cooked a boneless, skinless chicken breast in the crock pot on high for 3 hours. My wife and I devoured it. She said to definitely add this to my list of recipes.  I got a jar of jalapeno white queso, heated that up and poured it over the top. That gave it the kick it needed.  Otherwise, the filling was a little bland. With a side of refried beans and some tortilla chips. This dinner was a win. I'll definitely make this again, pretty much as is.

My husband loved these! I didn't have the recipe ingredients on hand so I used the following: 2 cups of cooked brown rice, 1 cup of medium salsa and 2 cans of Kirkland brand canned chicken (drained). This made 6 healthy sized chimichongas. Easy and quick, plus leftovers reheated well!

I made these exactly per the recipe. They were pretty good with the side yummies. The flavor of the Knorr rice wasn't my favorite, so I'll probably substitute a different Spanish rice next time. I used slow cooked shredded chicken breast. We loved how crispy the tortillas got with the little bit of oil.

When I make recipes for the first time I generally follow it and don't make many changes.  We liked it. A lot my son had it for leftovers as I made double since we had company. So yes we will make it again.

I made this tonight, but instead of chicken I used shredded pork from a pork roast that I had fixed. I also used chili verde salsa instead of the red. It was outstanding. I will make it again with chicken. I did not miss the fat from deep frying it.

I made it pretty much as the recipe showed. I used pepper Jack cheese. The crispy shell was as advertised. These were as good as going out and getting a deep fried chimi.

Loved this and definitely adding to our dinner rotation.  Husband and 3 boys liked it too. I used large soft taco shells and it made 10. My middle likes eating the mixture with Fritos too. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and it gets a big thumbs up.  One thing I did different the second time is about 5 minutes before they were done in the oven I took them out the threw some grated cheese on top, return to oven to melt the cheese.

Used 200 g chicken, 65 g salsa, 130 g cheese, 8" tortillas - made 7 wraps. Checked at 12 minutes and gave them another 5 min. Yum! My OH vastly preferred these over my last version, which may have been more authentic.

I added black beans and used a Jambalaya rice mix. It was awesome! My adult son loved it. He took the leftovers home and actually asked me how to reheat without a microwave!

These are pretty easy to make and are good, but not super-delicious. They come out with a nice crisp shell. I started with uncooked tortillas, which might have made them a little tastier. I also substituted cilantro for oregano because I was out. I also used Mexican blend cheese rather than jack cheese for the same reason. Not sure what difference that would have made. They are best with suggested dressings (sour cream, etc.).
