judyegray that does not deserve the rating you gave it. If you read the entire recipe you will notice that for vegetarians to use refried beans without lard. "Please" read the whole recipe before you cast judgement!
I loved it and am definitely not a vegetarian!

I made these exactly by the recipe for a small group of 14. Everyone seemed to like them, but no one raved over them. I appreciated the directions given for heating 3 corn tortillas in the microwave and then dipping them in the enchilada sauce before filling and rolling up. I've always had problems with corn tortillas breaking, but these rolled up perfectly.

Instead of using a microwave, I sautéed the onion and added 3 diced jalapeños. I used one can of refried beans and one can of refried black beans. I added the beans and cheese to the pan with the onions and jalapeños and heated until the cheese melted. After tasting the bean/cheese mixture, I wanted to spice it up a bit. So I added some chili powder, cumin, and hot taco sauce.

Great busy weeknight dinner.  I had extra from making slow cooker refried beans from this site and used them up on this.  I didn't microwave the beans and cheese together first, just poured a thin layer of enchilada sauce in the baking dish, added my rolled flour tortillas with bean/cheese filling, then poured more enchilada sauce and topped with cheese.  Loved that I could feed the vegetarian stepdaughter as well as others.

I added some extra onion and a whole package of cream cheese with the grated cheese because I like cheese and onions so much.  Also, I used two cans of medium red enchilada sauce since my batch made up into enough mix for a pan and a half of enchiladas. Added some sour cream on top after they cooled a bit, and ate with saltine crackers.  Very very good!  A new favorite here, and so easy to make that this will be a regular.  (If you want to bring an empty dish home from a pot luck, take it full of these.)  :)

These are great without meat or poultry and come quite close to that original texmex taste if you make your own enchilada sauce. What is missing is the sauce recipe otherwise i would have given it 5 stars.

Great base recipe. I prefer flour tortillas, and they work very well (you don't have to microwave them first, just set them on the counter while you're preparing the filling and pan). I double the amount of cheese - 2 cups go into the filling, and 2 cups go on top. For me this makes two 9"x12" pans, or 12 enchiladas total.

Could not be easier to throw together on a busy weekday night.  Easy to cut in half for a family of three.  It will become a standard in my kitchen.

Good recipe. Very easy to make. Not sure what happened but my tortillas were cracking when I rolled them up. Would make again. Perfect for children who are picky about their food.

These rank high for EASY of course you can add meat, but you don't have too.   For a fast family dinner these fit the bill.

My family liked this recipe. I added roasted red pepper and one roasted jalapeno. The next time I make it, I may use less beans and add corn or some other vegetable to add texture.

My family loved this. I sauteed the onion and then mixed the beans and cheese on the stove top rather than microwaving. I added some shredded chicken to half the enchiladas for the meat eaters. Otherwise made the recipe as written. It was fantastic to have a meal that made the vegetarians and meat-eaters in my family happy. I'm not sure if I'd say it's five stars in terms of taste, but it was very good and so easy that I know we will make it again and again - and that's a special kind of five stars. Thank you!

These are a favorite!  Quick, easy and inexpensive.  To boost the flavor use homemade refried beans, shred colby-jack cheese yourself and use a high quality enchilada sauce like Frontera.  I make these nearly every week.

Worked well for a Friday meal during lent.  Probably would add some more heat next time I make it which other reviewers have mentioned.

This is a huge hit every time I make it. I use a combination of refried BLACK beans and regular refried beans with mild chiles, flour tortillas, and green enchilada sauce. Easy and foolproof.

A good concept, but I found the canned enchilada sauce too bland for our taste. I will try it again with homemade sauce and I bet it will be terrific.

Made this  as the recipe specified, although I substituted flour tortillas for the corn (didn't have any corn tortillas on hand).  The flour tortillas change the consistency that some may not like, but I like them.  Super easy, and very good!  Even my husband, who is not crazy about "meatless" meals thought it was good.  Also liked the fact that it came together very quickly.  Will definitely make again.

We did corn instead of onion (purely out of not wanting to chop an onion since the kids were impatient!) and it was delish!

Everyone loved these enchiladas!  I added some cream cheese and extra Mexican shredded cheese.  The recipe produced a large amount of enchiladas so we had enough for four people plus!  A definite favorite.

Was great!  I made a couple of changes to give it a little more zip.  Try adding a small can of green chilies, use green onion, and El Pato sauce.  YUM!!!

Pretty good, and I liked that is an easy way to use up leftover refried beans from tacos. 
I'll be making this again.

This dish is easy to make.  I didn't dip the tortilla into the sauce beforehand.  I thought it would be too messy. I definitely  would make these again .

I made this with green enchilada sauce and the turned out great. I also sautéed the onions first for s bit. Easy meatless weekday dinner.
