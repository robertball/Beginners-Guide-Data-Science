First off, this salad is DELICIOUS. Honestly one of the best I've had in quite a while. The flavors go so well together - the peppery arugula, the sweet and tangy peaches and the grilled chicken. Yum.  The directions are a little confusing. In Step 2 you are making the dressing for the salad. Set this aside. You then take the remaining (plain) oil and use that to brush on the cut peaches and chicken before grilling.  That said, this really doesn't give much flavor to the chicken.  My recommendation is to just mix all the oil together into the dressing, then take a couple teaspoons of the dressing and brush THAT onto the peaches and chicken. I mean, you're mixing up dressing anyway, why not give the chicken a kick?  This makes 6 very small servings, especially once you toss the arugula with the dressing as it shrinks down some. In my opinion 4 chicken breasts is a lot for 8 cups of arugula.  Here are the proportions I recommend for 2 entree size portions: keep all the ingredients the same, except use 2 (4oz) chicken breasts. Given the adjustments I had to make, this is still a 5 star recipe, not only for it's ease, but for the impressive payoff! Thank you Trisha for sharing your recipe!

So I didn't make this as a salad. I was looking for a quick chicken dish that was yummy... I doubled the dressing, chopped the peach up and put it in the dressing. Poured the dressing over chicken tenders in a 9x13 pan. Baked the chicken till done - about 30 minutes at 375.  It was amazing. Served with rice and broccoli. Quick, easy, yummy dinner.

Husband and I liked it! My two daughters not so much but still ate it though.. We don't like arugula so we used spinach instead and sprinkled toasted walnuts righ before serving.

I used just the dressing portion of this recipe to make a tasty salad dressing.  I used red onion instead of shallots, and tossed the dressing with butter lettuce.  Then I topped the salad with fresh peach slices and chopped pecans.  Yummy!

Peaches and chicken were great.  I would have preferred a sweet dressing for the arugula.  The dressing was good, but not for this application imho.

Delicious! The dressing is sooo good! A nice summer meal. I cut the chicken breasts into large strips to bbq and they cooked a little quicker and were very moist. Served with corn on the cob - perfect!

I took the advice of others and brushed the dressing on the peaches and chicken before grilling. We served it with some focaccia bread. Excellent, super easy meal.  I used nectarines instead of peaches, which took a little knife work to cut around the seed in order to separate the halves.

Added a bit more balsamic vinegar to the dressing and salt and pepper to the chicken. This is a simple and delicious summer salad.

I did what some others suggested and brushed both peaches and chicken with the sauce. Wonderful flavor! A keeper!

Great recipe.  I made this as a light dinner for guests.  I too just brushed the dressing on the peaches - worked well.  I substituted pork tenderloin for the chicken as that's what I had on hand. I did double the amount of shallots but minced them fine as my family loves shallots, garlic etc   I will make again.

Great recipe. In the dressing I used a white apricot balsamic and it was great. Also added cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and toasted pecans. It was a big hit.

Loved this recipe, just as written! The only (slight) change for me was that I sauteed the peaches instead of grilled them. My husband loved it and anything that can get him to eat arugula is a winner in my book!

This is the perfect weekday summer dinner! I brushed the dressing on the peach halves and chicken before tossing the rest with the arugula. I also topped the salad with some goat cheese and crushed pecans. Stellar recipe!
