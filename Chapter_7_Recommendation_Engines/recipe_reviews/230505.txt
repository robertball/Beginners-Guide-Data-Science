So I shouldn't even really be reviewing this Becuase I was missing half the ingredients and had to totally fake it, but the faking turned out well...

Amazing!!!! It's so delicious it's dangerous. I didn't have any pine nuts so I used chopped roasted almonds instead. I will defiantly be making this again.

OMG, this is rediculously good with basically just 5 ingredients AND it doesn't even take long to make!  I made it almost exactly as written, used water instead of wine and parmesan instead of pecorino.
