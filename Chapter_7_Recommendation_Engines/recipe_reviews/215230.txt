Fixed this as written. The marinade smells delicious and I will use it for other meats, but this dish turned out just OK. I have to say that I did not fry the pork cubes in oil...I couldn't see adding the fat calories, so I sauteed them to brown them and added the onion. I won't fix it again, as it was nothing special and there are better ways to fix a pork loin.
