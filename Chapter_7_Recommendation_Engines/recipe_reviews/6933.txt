There were very good.  I decided for time reasons I would make muffins instead of a traditional loaf pan.  I got 12 slightly oversized muffins and 6 mini muffins.  I also reduced the oven temp to 325, as well as cooking time.  Larger muffins 35 minutes, smaller muffins 25 minutes.  I left out the dates (didn't have them).  I used organic crazins (dried cranberries) for the add-in.  I only used a handful of chopped nuts (daughter not fond of them).  The orange flavor is a great addition to this muffin.  I will definately make these again!

So yummy and easy to make!  Although I did make a few changes:  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of margarine.  Instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1 c white sugar + 1/2 c brown sugar.  I omitted the orange zest because I didn't have any and am glad I did because I wanted the pumpkin flavor really to shine.  For the cinnamon and cloves I just added an equal amount of Chinese 5 spice powder.  And for the walnuts and dates, I added an equal amount of raisins and fresh cranberries.  Mmm, this bread was so delicious!  I don't know if it has anything to do with elevation and where this recipe orginated, but my bread took any extra 12 minutes to bake.  I live outside Athens, GA which isn't below sea level or at a high elevation.  GREAT BREAD!

Excellent pumpkin bread!  I did change it a tad bit.  This fall I started using fresh sugar pumpkins for my recipes and found it better than canned.  So, I used freshly baked pumpkin instead of canned, used Splenda for the sugar, and increased the orange zest to 3 Tablespoons.  The orange accent is a perfect match for pumpkin recipes.  I will be preparing many mini-loaves of this bread for the freezer to enjoy through the winter months.  Thanks for the recipe Carol.

Out of the 5 or 6 pumpkin bread recipes I alternate between every year, this one is absolutely the best I've ever made.  I use butter instead of margarine.  I never use anything but butter.  I did add a little freshly grated nutmeg.  My grandmother told me years ago that you couldn't have pumpkin without nutmeg.  I"l be making this recipe one more time before Christmas, dividing half the recipe into mini loaves to put in gift baskets.  I hope everyone I give them to likes this bread as much as I do.

A very good recipe - and in answer to one of the reviewers, a 'tea bread' is a sweet bread served with tea. I took the advice of others and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. For personal preference I added pecans and raisins instead of walnuts and dates. And why 4 stars? - I got a pumpkin bread recipe years ago from a column in the Winnipeg Free Press, it is still the best ever.

I took someone else's idea and added Craisins instead of nuts, and I thought that it made the bread. I also had to cook mine longer than an hour - about 70-75 minutes. VERY GOOD with a very thin layer of melted cream cheese!!

Loved this bread's consistancy. Not as dense as some pumpkin bread recipes I've tried.  Used half the butter and added an individual container of unsweeeted apple sauce.  Used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Doubled spices but next time will not double cloves as was a bit too much.  Yummy!!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  My boyfriend and I made it for his birthday and it was gone within two days.  It was so moist and thick and wonderful and had a great zing.  The only changes I made to this recipe was substituting 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar, and we used frozen pumpkin puree (about 2 cups) instead of canned.

This recipe is really good.  I made some changes.  Ended up using whole wheat flour instead of regular.  And didn't use quite as much sugar - 3/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown.  Added just the orange juice (fresh squeezed) but not the zest.  Finally, I added 1/2 cup flaked coconut instead of the dates and walnuts.  Also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a touch of ginger.  Yummy!  Works well as muffins too.

While I love the combination of orange and pumpkin this bread was not moist enough for me.  The taste like I said is so good but its just too dense, nothing like the moist pumpkin breads I am used to.  If I was to make this again I would have to think of adding more liquid.  Glad I made it but would not make the recipe again as written.

I love this bread and find the balance of pumpkin, orange and spice to be perfect. I sub butter for margarine, and sometimes sub 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 wh. sugar. I split the recipe between two smaller loaf pans: one plain, one with pecans, no dates or raisins. Always delicious. Permanent addition to my collection!

mmmmm outstanding.  I made a quadruple batch, as I made this recipe to purposefully get rid of some leftover tangerines I had, and was planning on freezing most of them.  I changed the ingredients to fit what I had on hand, being such a large batch.  I only used a cup and half of sugar, and about 2 cups of brown sugar, which was significantly less sugar than the recipe calls for.  Even without most of the sugar, the bread was incredible.  Not sweet, but so flavorful.  My daughters loved them, a huge bonus.  We even eat them for dessert and spread some cream cheese frosting to make it more "dessert-y".  Oh sooooo good.

Very, very good!  We loved the bright taste of the orange zest.  It was a perfect blend with the pumpkin.  I added frozen cranberries instead of the dates and walnuts, and used butter instead of margarine.  The batter made 2 dozen regular sized muffins.  A real treat to make and eat on a rainy day!

After trying many pumpkin bread recipes, this one is the keeper.  Delicious, though I did not use the dates.  Maybe next time. Will make again and most likely double!

I made this loaf this afternoon and love the citrus flavor - a new spin on the traditional pumpkin bread.  My bread took quite a while to firm up.  I put foil over the top to prevent further browning.  Maybe it was just my oven, but it definitely took much longer than an hour.  Not quite as moist as I had hoped.  The final product is still tasty and definitely worth trying.

Very nice tea bread. I like my pumpkin bread a little spicier so I increased the cinnamon amt. to 1 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. each of ground ginger and ground nutmeg. I also used half white & half light brown sugar. Instead of dates I used orange-flavored dried cranberries and skipped the grated orange zest.  I was out of O.J. so I sustituted with 1/4 cup low fat milk. The bread took about 1 hr. 10 min. to bake. Served with whipped cream cheese. Will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these pretty much by the recipe - left out dates and nuts due to family preferences.  I will be having a brunch for a large crowd soon, so I made these in miniature muffin pans.  Recipe made 6 dozen mini muffins that were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I did combine 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/3 C sugar, a teaspoon of orange zest, and 1/4 C fresh orange juice. When muffins came out of the oven, I dipped the tops in this; it made a really nice glaze.  I will definitely be baking these again very soon and using them for that brunch!

To our taste buds this is one of the best sweet tea breads on Allrecipes because we never really cared for the oil based ones.   As is usual I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup  and the fruit and nuts can be varied to suit tastes without spoiling a wonderful bread.   Thanks for a great contribution to my files....bulging files!!!!!

This is a delicious fall treat.  Changes were made based on other reviews including using 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, increasing the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp and using nutmeg (1/2 tsp.) instead of cloves.  I also added 1/4 tsp of ginger.  When I took the loaf to a luncheon, everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.

Good, maybe a little less cloves would be better, it over powers the cinnamon.

Great recipe.  Very moist.  It had more of a citrus taste than a pumpkin taste, however, so if you're looking for a bread with a stronger pumpkin flavor, this may not be for you.  Regardless, this is a very flavorful, soft, moist bread recipe.

Great recipe!  I've made it a few times and it turns out perfect every time.  
I did a few things differently:
-Used dried cranberries instead of dates
-Used pecans instead of walnuts
-Added roasted pumpkin seeds - just for extra texture

The last time I made this recipe, I made muffins instead of loaves and it made about a dozen and a half muffins.

This was pretty good - very moist but a little too orangey for me...but that is a personal choice. I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and the juice of a navel orange, which was way more than a 1/4 cup, didn't measure for exactness. Might have helped it to be more like a traditional pumpkin bread should be. I did use fresh pumpkin, which is way better than canned! Omitted the nuts and did everything else the same. Took 65-70 minutes for the center to be completely done, but got dark fast, so put foil on the top for the last 15 minutes.

Really good. I left out walnuts & dates but put in cranberries.
