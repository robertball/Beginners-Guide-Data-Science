The problem with this recipe is that I didn't know it was a glaze, not a frosting.  So, as a glaze it is great, but a frosting it is not.  It is very thin if you follow this recipe.  It soaks in to the cake and pools at the sides of pan.  But, it makes a devil's food moist and yummy.

*READ THIS IT WILL HELP*
After fully cooking the frosting, put it in a mixer with a whip attachment. Whip on high until it starts to lose its shine. I also sugest using the frosting right awaywhen it is still a little warm. (It will become very stiff quickly) If it dose get stiff before it is used take a 1/4 of the frosting and nuker wave it for about 30 seconds. Then mix and use. I hope this helps.

There is no way that this recipe is written down correctly to make frosting.  It barley even makes a glaze more like chocolate milk that does not harden over but stay's a liquid.  The flavor is good but it in no way makes frosting or even a glaze

Way too thin.  I wonder if an ingredient wasn't left out, or perhaps it the white sugar should be substituted for confectioner's sugar?  Even so, I think it calls for far too much liquid.  It was really even too thin for a glaze.

Unfortunately this recipe makes something like chocolate soup, NOT frosting. And it makes a LOT of it.

You MUST whip this frosting with a mixer - there is no other way! I won't make it again.
