My masa didnâ€™t turn out using this recipe so I used another and used vegetable shortening and used the chicken from this recipe and it turned out great especially for a first time tamale maker

I used fresh organic corn masa from a small tortilla producer in Portland, Oregon. Since it was fresh it needed only a third of the broth. Great recipe!
