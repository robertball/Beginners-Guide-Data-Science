Excellent recipe! Very elegant on a dessert buffet. It take some time to make but is well worth it. The caramel sauce is the BEST!

I decided to use plastic cups instead of jars because of the large amount of  guests. I decided the jars measured  up to be about 2 small plastic cups.

This turned out so delicious. I used 8 oz mason jars and doubled the recipe to make 12 servings. The recipe looks more intimidating than it really is.
