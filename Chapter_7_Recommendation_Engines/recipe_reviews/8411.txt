The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a "T" and didn't like the crust.  The next time I made this recipe I changed the crust to a standard graham cracker crust:  one pack of graham crackers, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter.  I've used different fruits (blueberry, cherry & apples).  Also, I baked the cheesecake for one hour at 300 degrees (in a water bath).  After the cooking time, I let it sit in the oven for another hour.  People LOVED the cheesecake!

I made it with Blackberry pie filling and it was terrific.  Using the pan of water during the baking made for a moist cheesecake that didn't crack. Looked beautiful.  I dizzled a little bit of left over blackberry pie filling over the top of each piece before serving!

the crust was sort of crumbly to make and it would be easier to use a store boughten one and then make a quarter or so batch of the crust just to be used to sprinkle on top.

This cheescake was easy and it was a hit at Thanksgiving. Next time I might just do a plain grahm cracker crust though. The texture of the oats was a little strange.

Had to cook mine an extra 10 minutes & it must sit overnight. I did use a springform Pan which made removing a breeze. Liked this as a quick easy cheesecake recipe. Anna

Everyone liked this cheesecake, but I won't make it again.  I didn't like the crust (just not a cheescake crust!), and i thought the sour cream really dulled the sweetness of the cake.  I made a strawberry glaze for the top, which looked nice and added some flavor.

This was a really good cheesecake recipe, light ad creamy texture.  The crust was interesting, sort of like a what you would expect from the topping on apple crisp.  I will make this again but I think I would prefer it with cherries or another fruit.  The apple was good but would not have been my first pick.

This was amazing!! I made a couple of changes: instead of oats I used crushed vanilla cookies, 1/4 cup of white sugar, and 1/4cup of melted butter for crust. AND instead apples I used a can of cherries jubilee. Both changes were made because they were ingredients I had on hand. but my whole family couldnt get enough!!! Everyone was impressesed!!

This cheesecake was very light.  It was very simple to make, but tasted great!  I followed the other reviewers tip and used a graham cracker crust.  I also decided to use strawberry canned fruit instead of apple, because I thought strawberry would go better with the cheesecake.

My family and I loved this cheesecake!  Even non chessecake fans went back for seconds.  The next time I made it I did a little substituting instead of rolled oates I used crushed pecans and used blueberry filling in place of apple.  It was great eaither way!

This cheesecake is phenomenal!!! I substitute the rolled oats for a traditional graham crust with butter and pour the canned fruit on top of that.

I did not care for the crust.  If you make this, it took me 30 minutes longer in the oven to bake.  After which I let it cool for a couple of hours in the oven with door cracked.  Then I refrigerated over night in it's pan before removing in the morning.  I believe these steps are essential as 2x previously the cheesecake cracked or fell completely apart.    It is very moist but I have made MUCH better.  Probably will not bake again.

I love this recipe.  I am not a big cheesecake fan but this one is great.  In the crust instead of apple I have also used blueberry and strawberry and it was a huge hit.  This is what I have to bring to every family dinner!

This came out perfect - creamy and delicious.  The crust goes wonderfully with the apples.  This is a keeper.
