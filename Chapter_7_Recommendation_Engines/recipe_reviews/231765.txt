I'm the author of this recipe, and I wanted to point out that these are cake donuts, not yeast donuts. Therefore, they are a dense, heavier donut. They are not meant to to rise up a lot and have a light and airy texture like a yeast donut would. A tip for the thick batter is to use a pastry bag to pipe it into your donut pan. Use a muffin pan if you don't have a donut pan. 
Also, as all ovens vary, you may have to adjust the cooking time a bit for these, or any recipe you make. I hope you enjoy them!

This recipe worked great! I was looking for a baked donut recipe and though I didn't have pumpkin on hand I traded out the pumpkin for homemade, chunky apple sauce and it was so yummy! I also used a cinnamon and sugar coating in place of the glaze. They were soft and perfect! I made them for my sisters baby shower and everyone loved them!

I used this recipe to make doughnut holes with my Nostalgia Cake Pop Bakery. It worked perfectly! The only changes I made were increased the recipe size to serve 18 (didn't want to waste pumpkin puree), substituted the Pumpkin Spice (didn't have it) and altered the glaze. I used 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger. I'm sure it would have been great with plain Pumpkin Spice, I just didn't have it. With my 1 1/2 TBSP scoop leveled out, 8 min baking time, rolled them over and cooked for another 30 seconds, this recipe made about 3.5 dozen doughnut holes with the recipe at 18 servings (a whole 15oz can of pumpkin). For the glaze I did use a reduced amount of milk instead of water and added a couple TBSP of corn syrup. This helps the glaze harden.

added 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 tsp more pumpkin pie spice to the batter and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Made 14 regular sized donuts. baked at 350 for 13 minutes in a donut pan. made the same glaze but half of the recipe size and it covered 11 donuts. the donuts were good with or without the glaze. Note: if you have never used a donut recipe for baking, the dough is not 'pourable' it's thick and sticky and you have to plop it in the pan and shape it into the mold.

Made this recipe gluten free by substituting the 2 c flour with 1/2 cup each of the following: corn starch, tapicoa flour, rice flour, and sorghum flour.  Also added 2 teaspoons of xanthan gum.  Also, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Turned out delicious!  I didn't have a doughnut pan, so I spooned the batter into a gallon ziploc bag, cut off a corner, and piped it onto the pan in a donut shape.  Great flavor, and I love that I could make it GF and it was still yummy!

Yummy doughnut!! The only problem I had was that no matter how long I baked it for, they were still a little under cooked

These donuts are moist and flavorful.  Baking these donuts left the kitchen smelling wonderful.  I glazed the top and bottom, yummo!  I used an ice cream scoop to fill the donut pan and just open a hole in the middle of the dollop it was quick and easy and resulted in even donuts.

I've made these doughnuts several times and already loved them, but then I tried them with some homemade applesauce (instead of pumpkin) and wow!! Incredible!!! All the wonderful flavor of an apple fritter, but with homemade, soft, yummy goodness! Either way, I highly recommend!

These donuts are excellent.  I made a maple glaze instead of the one listed in the recipe by substituting maple syrup for of some of the water and vanilla extract.

I change the recipe around, make sugar free baked apple spice donuts.
I sub pumpkin for unsweetened  cup of apple sauce 1/4 cup brown sugar and  a 1/4 cup of sweet & low and half the amount milk.
** when baking sugar free recipe you have to use small amount of sugar in recipes.**
I used  a donut cutter to shape my donuts.
 Baked for 20 minutes at a 325 oven.

Excellent donuts, however, the glaze recipe was not good, nor did the donuts look anything like the picture with the glaze on them.  I do not recommend adding butter as it kept the glaze from sticking to the donut evenly, then after 24 hours the glaze completely soaked into the donuts making them mushy. I made them again & used my own tried & true glaze recipe that tastes delicious & the glaze stays where it's intended....on the outside of the donut.  Glaze recipe: Heat 1/4 c whole milk with 1 t vanilla extract until warm....slowly whisk in 2 c sifted confectioner's sugar. Remove glaze from heat & set over a bowl of warm water. Dip donuts into the glaze & place on draining rack for 5 min before serving.

I have been searching for a decent baked donut recipe. This recipe is wonderful! I make mine dairy-free. I substituted light vanilla almond milk for the milk and Earth Balance for the butter. I have made the original pumpkin version. I did add a little cinnamon to the glaze, but it would be good without the cinnamon, too. I have also played with this recipe. I've used homemade chunky applesauce, which is great. The latest was chocolate banana. I substituted banana for the pumpkin and added a 1/4 cup of Hershey's Dark Cocoa powder. For the glaze, I used the light vanilla almond milk instead of water, a half teaspoon of almond extract and a half teaspoon of vanilla (instead of a full teaspoon of vanilla), and 1/3 cup of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup Earth Balance buttery spread, and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Those are our family's favorite so far! Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

Amazing! Doughnuts are moist and flavorful. I used my own blend of spices since I don't have any pumpkin pie spice. I also loved how easy this was. I don't have a doughnut pan, so I did as another reviewer suggested and cut the corner out of a ziploc and piped the doughnuts onto the baking sheet. One thing to mention, these are a very soft doughnut, so it can be difficult to judge when they are done. I baked mine for about 15 minutes. The glaze is wonderful as well; with just the right amount for this batch of doughnuts--and I love that! I hate when you end up with tons of extra glaze and not enough product to put it on---but this was not the case with this recipe! Overall, I cannot wait to make again. Thanks so much for sharing, RainbowJewels!

These were great after being cooled out of the oven. After a few hours or even out of the fridge, they started to have a gummy taste and wasn't appetizing like a donut should be.

I recently found  this recipe on a blog site and they said it is a copycat of famous chain. I love trying copycat recipes at home to save so much money. These are easy to make and turned out better than expected. I  tried half the donuts with a chocolate hazelnut glaze which my husband likes better.

The donut recipe was fantastic. The taste and crumb of the cake was perfect. I was a little suspicious that the directions didn't have you cream the butter like a normal cake recipe, but it worker out well. I used different glazes/toppings, so can't comment on that part of the recipe.

The batter makes 12 donuts; not pumpkin spicy at all. I will adjust the recipe. Don't take the hot donuts and dip into icing as they break; I let them cool a  little bit and then I glazed them using a small spatula. If you want more glaze let that cool and then reglaze.

These are our favorite doughnuts.    I sometimes use applesauce in place of the pumpkin.  It is important to not wrap them in plastic wrap, or they get soggy.

Fantastic recipe. Very moist.I didn't have a donut pan, and so I baked them in muffin cups. It wasn't nearly as pretty, but they tasted just as good! They really are best while they're very warm and fresh.
The second, third, and fourth time I made these I used donut pans. They looked perfect! I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent flavor and not a heavy  donut. Didn't have donut tins so made them in mini muffin tins and turned out perfect! Love the glaze, not overly sweet, just right!

Just made these. Yummy and easy to put together. I used milk in the glaze and added some pumpkin spice and maple syrup. I put the batter in a pastry bag to fill the donut pan. I would like a bit more pumpkin flavor.

I really liked this doughnut, it is the the pumpkin spice doughnut my family has been searching for. I did make the doughnut using gluten free flour and used cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves since I did not have any pumpkin spice seasoning. I also thinned my icing with milk instead of water.Next time I won't wait as long to dip them in the icing.

I made the recipe as is and it came out delicious. I did it with the cinnamon sugar. They were a bit more of a cupcake consistency than donut, but being baked they were light and delicious.

I didn't have a doughnut pan so I had to use a muffin tin. They looked like muffins, and my little brother called them  "duffins". They were a little underdone in the middle because I forgot that the cooking time was for much thinner doughnuts. Other than that I though they were pretty good.

I used individual spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger) instead of a mix; increased the recipe to use up all the pumpkin, and made a maple glaze instead of vanilla. (Maple syrup, butter and powdered sugar).  They are really, really good.

I made a double batch of these donuts and used a baggie with the end cut off to pipe them into the donut pans. It was somewhat messy refilling the bag, but helped get them into the pans pretty well. They tasted very good, but were a little too "wet". I think it may have been all the butter in the glaze. Next time. I will try my usual powdered sugar and milk glaze or cinnamon and sugar. Still, very tasty!

These are great. I made them in my donut pan and had a little batter left over once filling up the 12 holes. I'm not crazy about a strong pumpkin taste so I used half a cup of pumpkin and half a cup of applesauce. These are great for breakfast with a coffee or as an afternoon snack for the kids. Even my husband approved!! They are more muffin then donut but I am still a fan :)

Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out amazing!! I was a little short on glaze so I made more by just halving the glaze recipe and it was a good amount for the last couple of donuts I had. Would totally recommend!

It turned out fairly well, but it was a bit too moist.  And, like another reviewer said, the pumpkin taste was not right.  I think it has to do with different brands of pumpkin pie spice.  I think I'm going to stick with putting my own spices in from now on.

Also , I baked them a lot longer.  With an altitude of 6300 feet, it seems all recipes get adjusted.  I used the "push it with my finger" test.  It took about 10 minutes longer.

Other than that, the donuts didn't last long..they "evaporated" rather quickly, lol

I hadn't tried anything made from pumpkin in years. (Yes, in the world of pumpkin spice, I stand alone.) I made this on a whim and they came out fine and were easy to make. After tasting one  I realized I hate the taste of pumpkin, and perhaps had forgotten in my avoidance of it since childhood.

Added just a bit more spice to get a more intense pumpkin spice flavor then used a plastic bag to pipe the dough into donut pan to bake!  Did some with glaze and some with cinnamon sugar.  Great easy no fuss fall treat.

I made these using white whole wheat flour, brought these to my son's soccer game, and they were a hit!!!  I skipped the glaze, and they still disappeared- several people asked for the recipe.  This one is a keeper for sure!  Thanks so much for posting!!!!

These were wonderful! I baked them in my mini-donut maker and then shook them in a bag of cinnamon sugar.  I had planned on making the glaze for half of them, but didn’t after tasting them this way.

The only change I made was to add morepumpkinpie spice. I love the texture and flavor of these. I haven’t had donuts in a while, and as fall came, I found myself yearning for an Apple Cider donut or any fall flavored donut. There’s a Krispy Kreme over in Anchorage, but I’m a New England girl, and that is just not an option. These were quick and tasty. They also allowed me to count the calories more easily. I will definitely make these again next fall.

I made these tonight replacing the pumpkin with applesauce bc it's all I had.  baked for almost 20 mins and the glaze stuck good after cooling the donuts briefly.  it's very hard to compare these to typical fried donuts bc of course fried is better.  these turned out great for a baked donut and I look forward to having it with coffee.  The glaze is a must to make it tasty! it could be a little bland without that addition

I wasn't going to rate because of my tweaks but was not allowed to comment or post pics without it!  (What's with that!)  Anyway, the 5 stars are for mine.  I topped some with cinnamon sugar and some with a simple cream cheese glaze, both were really good!  Thanks for the basic recipe.

These were Ok but not what I was expecting. The didn't have that cake doughnut texture that I was hoping for. Flavor was Ok, my kids are loving them and considering the pumpkin and amount of sugar/butter compared to other recipes I don't feel too guilty about them eating this treat (I handed them to them unglazed with just a bit of sugar and cinnamon on top).   These reminded me of a pumpkin cookie not so much a doughnut. I'll add this to my list of almost healthy snacks for the kids, but need to find a cake doughnut  recipe that has that classic texture. :)

These turned out perfectly! Not dry like some cake donuts end up tasting. I double dipped the tops of mine in the glaze. I also needed to bake mine in the oven for probably 5 minutes longer than it said. Super good though, bringing them to work tomorrow for my coworkers! Thanks for the recipe!!

Didn't have a donut pan. Used mini- and regular-sized muffin pans; cooked them for 13-14 minutes. (Lightly oiled the pans before each batch went into the oven.) Used the cinnamon-sugar coating afterwards--not the glaze. Tasted great; the whole family loved them!  (Of course, coat anything in sugar and it's a hit...) Perfect texture/consistency. Our only pseudo-complaint was that we couldn't taste the pumpkin. I used fresh, not canned.

Delicious! These doughnuts are super soft! My husband doesn't usually like cake doughnuts but he loved these. We added 1/2 tsp more of pumpkin pie spice and didn't add the butter to the glaze. The glaze had a nice crust to it when it dried, felt authentic ;o) I thought the batter was not sweet enough so the glaze is definitely needed. I will make these again and play around with the sugar types and levels to see if I can sweeten the batter a little. Because sometimes I just want a plain doughnut!

These Donuts tasted ok but were very sticky and didn't rise/bake properly (they were still underbaked even after adding 4 more minutes to baking time. The glaze tasted really good but stayed sticky and didn't dr. Donuts looked nothing like in the picture. Will not make them again.

Tasted good but without a donut pan, I couldn't get more than pancakes out of this.

The donuts are delicious, but watch the texture of the batter. I had to thin it out, and increase baking time to about 13 minutes.

Tasty and certainly easy to make but I'll not make them again.  They flattened out too much and after half an hour at 350, they still appeared not cooked enough.

They didn't rise much at all, and the texture was like rubber.  I would not use this recipe again!

These were not as good as I had hoped.  The pumpkin flavor does not come through well.  The glaze does not set up.  I was out of baking soda, so increased the baking powder, so maybe that changed the flavor enough.  I probably won't try them again.

One of the better donut recipes.  I made a couple changes, though.  Used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Also, didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead.  I deep fried mine, which required adding a little extra milk to get the right consistency to get them through the Ronco donut maker.  

I also followed another reviewer by adding maple syrup to icing, which was great.

Made these this morning for the first time. I like c & s instead of icing. I would suggest using a pastry brush to gently coat the donut with butter so less butter is used. otherwise I ended up with a wet donut. I made the switch after trying 2 donuts with the dipping method. brush was much better. I made the recipe as written for batter.

made this cause I bought a donut pan and wanted to use it. Turned out perfect! Though for the cinnamon sugar on top it took a lot more than 1/4 cup melted butter to coat a dozen of those babies. For thanksgiving I'm going to alter the recipe using pre cooked apple compote with cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice. :)

Yes it's great we all loved it.... I have not tried it with pumpkin yet because my husband isn't a pumpkin fan... So all my batches have been apple. Hoping to make the next batch a pumpkin donut.

This was my first ever attempt at making something from scratch! Needless to say I had no idea what I was doing. In the end they taste great! However, I didn't realize the recipe was for 12 donuts and I stuffed all the batter into six donuts. So the cook time was quite a bit longer. My boyfriend loves them so that's all that matters!

I really liked this recipe; I could really taste the pumpkin.  I followed the recipe as is and made no changes to the glaze.  I did wait until the donuts were almost completely cooled before putting on the glaze, however.  I like lots of glaze on my donuts.  In my oven they did need to bake a little longer.  After the first batch, I baked the second batch of donuts at 350 for 11 minutes and they were perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it as is and LOVE it! The donuts are not too sweet and the glaze just balances that out. This is going to be dangerous!

My Son Loved Loved loved these donuts and so did his friend! I did find it difficult to spoon the mixture into the donut pan, it was very time consuming, I should have read some of the other reviews first and uses a plastic bag with the end cut to make a tube and squeeze it into the pan.  I started to think that the batter was too thick and then when the recipe said that it made 24 donuts and I only got 12 I really thought I did something wrong I also cooked them about 5 extra minutes then the recipe called for and I still felt like the donuts were under cooked but they still taste good!  I had a lot of glaze left over but I think its because I let the kids to the glazing and I think they could have really dipped them a little more!!!

Great flavor.The texture isn't light & fluffy, which I didn't expect, but it also isn't the texture of a cake doughnut. It is very moist, dense, and heavy, just like a muffin. I made them as directed and they turned out ok but I will adjust the recipe next time to see if I can achieve a more doughnut-like texture. Also, I baked them at 325 for 15 minutes and they still were not done, so I adjusted the temperature up to 350 and baked them another 5 minutes.

We made these with the mini Babycakes donut maker. I increased the recipe to 18 servings in order to use a whole 15oz can of Pumpkin. They made about 30 mini donuts. My kids LOVED them and they are not fans of anything other than the expected.

FANTASTIC! So simple to make, moist and delicious. The recipe yields exactly 12 and the glaze is the perfect amount. My pic does not do these any justice (sorry, bad lighting, lol)...they are beautiful. I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good recipe. I made them in a mini muffin pan and they turned out perfect. The only change was that I increased the cooking time to 13 minutes. Delicious!
