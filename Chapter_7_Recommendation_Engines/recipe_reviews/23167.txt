I combined a few different suggestions from reviewers and this turned out FABULOUSLY!!!  I must say that I have only 3 other dishes in my "favorites" folder, so it takes a lot to get there.  I'm glad to say I added my 4th after making this!

I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added about 1/4 C of water.  I added 1 beef bouillon cube and plenty of bay leaf and thyme.  I used cooking sherry as my wine and also added 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  I browned the beef with the oil and garlic slightly before adding the other ingredients, set the temperature to medium, covered the skillet, and cooked for about 40 minutes.  The sauce cooked down and was thick and delicious.  I stirred in about 2 tbsp of butter after removing from heat. I served this over mashed potatoes.

THANK YOU for such a great recipe!

I've made this a few times now and my family loves it.I've changed the recipe a bit to suite our tastes.I brown the beef, then add just enough beef broth to cover and a tbsp of worchestershire sauce and simmer for 30-45 min.Then add in the garlic, tomato sauce, black pepper and an 8 oz can of mushrooms w/ liquid.I don't cook with alcohol so I leave out the wine.I let it simmer another 30 minutes and the meat comes out tender and the sauce has thickened.I've made this with sirloin and stew meat and haven't had any problems.I serve with mashed potatoes since my hubby and children prefer it that way...

We loved this recipe!!  I made a few slight modifications, I increased the wine to one cup (I used cabernet) and eliminated the mushrooms completely, as they aren't a favorite around here.  Also, I found the sauce to be incredibly runny, so I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it and it was perfect.  I added a splash of olive oil, and I used one cup of Ragu Seven Herb Tomato pasta sauce, and I think the chunks of tomato really added to this recipe!  It looked and tasted homemade, and my husband thought I slaved for hours in the kitchen making it!  I served it over buttered noodles, as suggested, and with some homemade bread and we drank the remaining cabernet.  This was wonderful and we will definitely have this again!!

I wanted a nice dinner after cleaning my carpets all day so I put this together in my slow cooker. I used sirloin tips, and huge chunks of mushroom. (Love them).
I also added chopped onions and very generous garlic. Two bay Leaf, and 1 T of brown sugar which was a great tip from previous reviews. I substituted  1/2C Brandy for the wine and used 3/4C beef broth with the tomato sauce, it was awesome. Whenever I cook stews or something similar to this in the slow cooker, too much liquid can be a problem. My secret is adding 1 good Tablespoon of Tapioca about an hour before it's done. Leave the cover off and let it thicken. It does not cloud the sauce and keeps it very smooth. It keeps it more of a sauce than a gravy.You can always put the lid back on to perfect the amount of thickening you want. I served it with Garden Harvest Rice pilaf and salad. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I added chopped onion and minced garlic to the beef while cooking.  Sauteed fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned.  No need to add additional liquid.  Used 17 oz. can of diced tomatoes and 2 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce, 2 bay leaves, 1 TB thyme and 3 TB beef base and simmered for an hour.  Thickened broth right at end and served over noodles.  One cup red wine added a unique flavor and wasnt too salty at all.  Very delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Based upon the many excellent reviews and suggestions, I made some significant changes to the recipe.

First, I fried lots of fresh mushrooms in butter and set them aside.  I used a Papain based meat tenderizer on the steak (I only used 12 pound) before cutting it up.  I browned the steak pieces in Canola oil, then added the garlic plus (as some had suggested) finely chopped onions.

Because several reviewers had suggested that the sauce was too thin, I did make an oilflour roux, but turned out I did not need it.

I used about 20 oz. canned diced tomatoes (again as a result of other reviewers' suggestions) and only about 12 cup wine.  I did use a small 6oz. can of tomato paste, but next time, I would only use half, as it had just a bit too strong a tomato flavour.

I also added Italian Seasoning and Oregano.

The buttered egg noodles are a MUST!!!

I served this dish with cooked fresh green beans. It was a great hit, and since I am cooking for only two people, half the dish was left over for another day.

The next day, I reheated it, added some water as it was a bit too thick and served it over Uncle Ben's Minute Rice:

I cooked the rice according to microwave instructions, except I deleted the salt, and added finely chopped onion, chopped red and green pepper and frozen "petite peas".  I think that this was even better than the first day!

This is a 5 star recipe.  I used paste to thicken and it worked perfectly.  Served with mashed potatoes.  This works really well in the crock pot outstanding!!!

This is one I've made several times now, and we always love it. You can brown the strips and then put it in the crockpot to finish. I've also added more wine, and then added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it slightly. That's great too. You can make more sauce by using tomato puree instead of sauce, and thicken it with some cornstarch too if you need to stretch this recipe further. Awesome and thank you for sharing!

Will defenitly make it again. I followed HENNY FRANKs review, and added my own twist. I put some flour in a large plastic container and shook the beefcubes in the closed bowl with McCormick steak seasoning about 1 TAB.  Sauted quickly in garlic and olive oil per recipe then put it in the crock pot.  Added about 2-3 Tab. of the seasoned flour in the crock pot and added 3/4 cup Marsala cooking wine with about 2 teas. of dried minced onion, 8 oz. chuncked fresh mushrooms, and a 12 oz. can of Delmonte diced tomotoes with basil, oregano, & garlic, 1/4 cup of water and and a couple of bayleaves.  Cooked in crock pot for 2 hours on med/low.  Of course served on buttered noodles.  The steak seasoning really added wonderful flavor! The beef was so tender, and the sauce was "coated the back of the spoon" perfect.  Excellent recipe. THANKS!

This was really great, though my review is based on alterations rather than the original.  I sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic and half a leek in about a tablespoon of butter.  Then added sirloin tips and browned them.  Added 4 chopped porcini mushrooms (fresh), 1 can of tomato sauce plus filled up the can 1/2 way with water and also poured that in.  I added two teaspoons of beef base, oregano, thyme, and a little garlic powder, as well as some salt and pepper.  I let it cook for at least 45 minutes in the sauce.  It was AMAZING!  My husband said it was one of the best things I've made.  We ate it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccolini.  It's definitely on the regular rotation now!

I made as written (added bellpepper as garnish) except I had one major substitution which is that I used venison tenderloin instead of the beef. To all of you hunters out there, this works very nice with venison too. The only change I will make next time is to use fresh mushrooms instead of the can.

This is a great base for a hearty meal. I am rating this as 5 stars with my changes. I dredged the meat in flour before browning and added a sliced onion and fresh mushrooms. Instead of water, I used beef stock and also added fresh thyme. I simmered this for an hour and a half. The beef was super tender and the savory gravy was awesome over bow tie pasta! This made a wonderful homecooked meal for my hardworking man to come home to! I will be making this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I actually cooked it on low for about 2 hours and the meat was so tender.  I added 1/2 onion to the mushrooms and garlic and sauteed in a pan after I browned the meat.  I also added 1 tablespoon brown sugar and alittle thyme and fresh parsley.  I didn't have any wine so I just used about 1 cup of beef broth.  After my dinner was done I added a few parm shavings for an awesome presentation....Thank you so much for the recipe
NOTE...also at the end of cooking time added about 2 Tablespoons of cream cheese and 1 tablespoon of butter,,,,

Other than conversion to beef broth/fresh mushrooms (baby bella) for canned suggested by others, stayed with the recipie as is.  Served over rice but mashed potato or egg noodles would be great too I'm sure.  We're a family of six and I made enough for 8 portions.  Gone...

This one made the rotation after one shot.  Delicious.

I made this for dinner with a couple of minor changes... I used fresh mushrooms that I pre-browned... I 2 tbsp tomato for the tomato sauce and added the paste before the other ingredients after the meat had browned... I also added onion and bay leaf.. This was super good yes I made changes but the basic concept is solid and delicious. I can imagine that it would be 5 star even without my changes..  Thanks GRANNYA for a keeper

We enjoyed this quite a bit. I opted to cook this in my crock pot. I used beef stew meat, fresh brown mushrooms that I quartered, and roughly chopped onions. I also added a packet of beefy onion soup mix, and since I didn't have any wine I just added some water.

I had a dish in mind and this was as close as I could come to finding a recipe for what I was after.  I added 1/2 cup chopped red onion with the sirloin.  I added 1 cup of beef broth and then also added 1 tsp. thyme.  After cooking for about an hour I thickened by mixing in a little water that had about 1-1/2 tsp. cornstartch mixed into it.  I prefer to thicken with cornstarch vs. flour beause it mixes in so smoothly.  Definitely use fresh mushrooms.  We served over mashed potatoes and the kids loved it.  Good hearty meal.

I added sauteed onions to the garlic and beef while it was browning and sprinkled with the salt and pepper. When I added the other ingredients, I also added a beef bouillon cube, 2 bay leaves, brown sugar, worcestershire sauce, italian seasoning mix, some extra oregano, and thyme. About half way into the cooking time I added a little corn starch. The sauce thickened perfectly and tasted great.

So wonderful! I am on the Weight Watchers diet plan and was happy to find out that this recipe is WW friendly. I cooked this in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low. It turned out wonderfully. I used a Cabernet wine. I sauteed fresh mushrooms with onions and garlic in the olive oil then placed them in the crock pot. I also browned the meat before putting it in the crock pot. I did follow the advice of others and added some tomato paste to thicken it up as well as 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar. Served over egg noodles. My husband had 4th's! This will be going into the regular rotation. Thanks so much!

Great tasting recipe!  I added an onion, sauteed it in the pan before putting in the garlic and the beef, as well as some onion and garlic powder to taste.  I will make it again!  Next time I may use chuck, it may be more tender.

This was delicious, and I will make it again.  I gave 4 stars only because I had to make a couple of alterations, nothing to do with flavor -- added a couple T of flour to thicken the sauce (perhaps tomato paste instead of tomato sauce would accomplish this?); and 1 T. of sugar cuts the acidity of the tomatoes.  Also, becuase I used a high quaility beef sirloin, I would brown the chunks  and add toward the end of the cooking time to keep them tender, they turned unneccessarily tough in 30 min of cooking.   Adding onions in a natural for this good recipe.

It was okay.  My 17 years old daughte thought it was a kind of bland.  Also it does take a little while to get the meat to get tender on the stove.  Next time I may try this in a slow cooker......

Hubby and I LOVED this...we will definitely be making again. This is our new way to do beef tips. I did change just a little I didn't use wine cause I don't use it to cook I just used beef broth. I made brown rice and green beans to go with it. It was devine!

Really good. Only made a couple of minor changes.  Chopped 1 onion (sauteed w/beef) and added a tbsp of brown sugar.  Also added a little flour to thicken the sauce. Husband also enjoyed it.
Update:  Sauteed 1 onion with fresh mushrooms; added garlic at end.  Per another review, added 2 bay leaves and thyme leaves...no brown sugar this time...will make like this from now on.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I ate it with garlic mashed potatoes, which I think made a good compliment. I only had 1/2 the amount of mushrooms, but it didn't seem to be a problem. I didn't expect though this to have such an Italian taste and the color was very red to. I didn't think it had a ton of flavor, though, and I ended up adding more garlic, onion powder, garlic salt, and dried parsley. That really helped.

Another success!!  My husband LOVED this recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce since the mushrooms had no liquid.  As always, I also added onion while browning the tips.  Served over wide egg noodles with "Italian Herb Bread 1" (found on ALLRECIPES) and fresh broccoli.  Yum!! Yum!!

It's lacking flavor, in spite of me adding garlic, onion powder and bouillon.  It tastes like beef smothered in tomato sauce and wine, and that's it.  No depth, very flat.  It's a fairly easy recipe to use as maybe a starting place with LOTS of additions and substitutions but the recipe as written is just too plain-jane. Sorry but this one was a flop.

We didn't care for this recipe.  The steak became tougher as it cooked longer. There was too much liquid.  We also didn't like the addition of tomato sauce and couldn't taste the wine.  Just personal preference.

After reading other reviews regarding a runny sauce, I only used 1/2 of the mushroom liquid.  Also, I cooked up a little over 2 lbs of cubed sirloin.  For the red wine I used a Cabernet Sauvignon.  Also, upon the suggestion in another review I added 2 beef bouillion cubes.  My sauce turned out perfect, not too thin or thick with a rich flavor!  I intended to use onions, but somehow I was out of them and instead used a generous amount of onion powder and a tad of garlic powder on the meat while browning.  I'm funny about having enough flavor on meat and this did the trick!  This was a TASTY dish!  We will definately fix this again.

I do not understand how someone can say they loved a recipe when they completely change it??  This recipe is great without any changes.  One lady left out the mushrooms!  Why even comment on a recipe that you totally change, just move on.

This is very good recipe. I served with a side of German Spatzle using the recipe of this website. I highly recommend it.  I added some onions when cooking the meat with the garlic. Now, I used fresh button mushrooms instead of canned ones.  Since my mushrooms were fresh, I removed the browned meat, cooked the mushrooms in the same pan until they became brown and fragrant and then added the wine. I let it simmer for a few minutes and then returned the meat to the pan with the mushrooms and proceeded to add the rest of the ingredients and followed the 30 minutes cooking time. Since Sirloin tips sometimes can be a bit rubbery I cubed them and pounded them a bit with my kitchen hammer the night before as a pre-prep step to see what happened. Honestly, it came out really soft and tasty. Will make this again.

I really love this recipe, however,  I do prefer the tips medium rare. To that end, I browned the meat, removed it from the skillet, simmered the remaining ingredients for 15 minutes, then put the meat back in for the remaining 15 minutes.  This was too long. Next time I will brown the tips, remove it, simmer the other ingredients for 20 minutes,  then add the tips to the sauce for 10 minutes.  Hopefully this will give me the "doneness" that I prefer. I did also add some onion powder and thyme to the sauce. I served it with garlic redskinned mashed potatoes and greenbeans. Delicious!!! Can't wait to make it again!

Wow, this was delicious.  I too used fresh mushrooms cut in quarters.  I also used 1 can diced tomatoes and only about 1/2 cup wine.  The key to getting this sauce less watery is to cook it down by simmering it with the lid off on medium heat for about 10-15 min.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

This recipe was just okay.  I was disappointed that I wasted a good cut of meat because no one really cared for it.   I think the tomato sauce is what killed it for our family.

Wow I used cheap chuck steak my husband bought and it was still amazing!! I used fresh mushrooms (a must) and substituted half the olive oil with butter at the beginning. Also instead of red wine I used grape juice with red wine vinegar. Thank you for this recipe - it is an instant classic at our home.

It was a DELICIOUS change! I made it exactly as the directions were stated, and I wouldn't change a thing! I served them over buttered noodles. Be careful not to cook it too long, or there won't be enough liquid to pour over the noodles!

I thought this was a good, quick meal.  The only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce since it cooked down while it simmered.  I also added tomato paste to thicken the sauce.

This is in answer to Jen Jen mostly, because she used the porcini mushrooms.  I found a great thing years ago at a spice house and ordered two small plastic bags full, it was not expensive. I made this, but my substitutions were mostly like Jen's and I used 1 tsp of "porcini powder" which I have had for a few years and its still good.  Its great to have on hand so wanted to share this with all the great cooks on this wonderful, easy and fun website. I am 87, have been  cooking for 70 years, from New Orleans, and you know how we love to cook, but this is the only recipe link that I find to be fun, fairly easy, no big nosy ads, and nice videos, plus the sharing of others changing things around. I got my porcini powder at The Spice House in Chicago.

We liked it, but it was tasting a bit bland.  So, I added some soy sauce, onion powder, Montreal Seasoning and a little Kitchen Bouquet.  Then, towards the end of the cooking time, added Tapioca to thicken up the sauce.  Served over egg noodles.  The meat was very tender.

I added 1/4 of heavy cream (for 2 servings) to make it similar to stroganoff and a little basil. It came out splendid and it was super easy!

This was GREAT!  Made this last night for hubby and I and he went back for seconds and thirds.  That doesn't usually happen on a new recipe.  The only change I did was add some thyme and used fresh mushrooms, since that's what I had.  Hubby has already asked when I'm making it again.

This was okay, nothing special, even with fresh mushrooms. Definitely would benefit from the addition of herbs.

This was so yummy! Like many people I often just need a jumping off point for a recipe, so I didn't stick to the letter of the recipe. If you don't have red wine on hand, may I suggest replacing it with 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar. Awsome!!

This is a very good easy and simple recipes.  You can fix in 30mins or less.  I did use fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. And made a small portion so the ingredients were less.  Although I did use about 1lb of mushrooms since I love mushrooms,

This is good as a base recipe.   I made a few changes based on other responses.  I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with rough chopped onion and garlic removed.  Then  browned meat  added the veggies back  1 cup of wine and the  tomato sauce, bay leaf, and dash of red pepper  in a brasing pan covered and cooked in the oven for 1 hour and half.

Made this for dinner last night. Giving it 4 stars simply because DH really enjoyed it, so I will be making it again. As others have stated, found this a little bland as it was cooking. I added worchestshire sauce, A-1 sauce, and 3 beef bullion cubes. This helped. Used beef broth in place of the wine. I used sirloin steak, but simmered it covered for about half an hour and then uncovered about 20 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken. The meat was very tender. It was a little salty, but I may have put too much on when I was seasoning the meat. I didn't really care for the tomato taste, may cut the tomato sauce in half the next time. Stirred in sauteed onions because we like onions and mushrooms with steak, which, of course, the kiddos picked out.

This is the kind of recipe that I love... meat, mushrooms, red wine, lots of great reviews. So I'm not sure what happened... I followed everything exactly, except using fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Half way into the cooking I tasted the sauce--bland and sour! I read through some reviews and added onion powder, bay leaf, fresh thyme, a beef bouillon cube, and a few Ts of brown sugar. MUCH better. Throw in an extra splash of wine a few minutes before cooking is finished and the it will taste significantly better. The meat however was incredibly tough. Meat that's cooked over a long period of time should be more of a stew meat (lots of connective tissues and such)... right? Sirloin is better cooked over grill/pan fried. The sauce (after major alterations) tasted wonderful. The meat? Find a more suitable cut. Kind of disappointed.

This recipe was tasty,  it would have been tastier had I not read reviews and made so many changes. I started off with just the ingredients listed in the recipe, and it smelled AWESOME! Then I started putting in things suggested by reviews like "lots of tyme", "Beef bullion", "Brown Sugar", and "wostershire sauce", NO THANKS. What I do think COMPLIMENTS the dish is; onion sauteed with garlic, extra wine, and some butter at the end. Adding too much changes the entire dish!

The sirloin tips ended up being tough in the 30 minutes and tasted bland. The sauce didn't taste right. Seemed like the red wine didn't belong or there needed to be herbs added to tame the red wine sourness. I added beef broth and a bit of tomato paste to save it but that didn't help much.  Probably would have been better to grill the sirloin and make the sauce seperately and also tweak the sauce, then add the meat just before serving.

Taste is robust and complex, despite the simplicity of the recipe!  The red wine adds a lot to this recipe - I used the full amount suggested.  I did make some modifications - for 1 lb of meat, I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar, 2 bay leaves, generous shake of thyme, oregano, fresh basil, fresh baby bella mushrooms vs. canned mushrooms, and 3 tomatoes + 6 oz can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  This produces a thick sauce if the recipe is cooked for 1 hour (I used stew meat, so it needed the extra time).  Otherwise, with 30 mins of cooking time, I would suggest using 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of tomato + paste.

Delicious!  I gave it 4 stars because it really needs more seasonings than indicated and I felt like I had to deviate a bit to ensure the dish was full-flavored.  I diced and sauteed 1 small onion with the meat.  I also used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them separately in olive oil and a bit of the red wine.  Because I used more beef than specified, I mixed all the "sauce stuff" (to which I also added 2 tbsp of brown sugar) into the sauteed mushrooms and poured it into the skillet with the beef and onions.. this made it a lot easier to work with.  Like others, I felt the sauce needed to be thickened.  I mixed about a 1/2 cup of water with some cornstarch and poured it slowly into the skillet the last 15 minutes of cooking.  This was soooooo good served over brown rice and with buscuits (gotta sop up that sauce!).

Best recipe I've found on here.  Loved it, but I did make a few changes.  I used fresh mushrooms (saute first) and added 1 diced tomato, italian seasoning, oregano and a handful of chopped onion. I added the onion with the garlic.  Wonderful! I served it over mashed potatoes. I highly suggest this.  My husband asked to have it added to the regular rotation, which is a huge compliment. I think it has only happened twice before.

This recipe is healthy and tastes great, but I changed it so much it's difficult to rate the original recipe. I increased the amounts of garlic to 3-4 cloves, tomato sauce to 1 cup, and red wine to 1 cup.  I added a can of tomatoes, a 1/3 can of tomato paste, used fresh shrooms and added  onion.  I also added oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, and bay leaves.  I sauteed the garlic, onion and shrooms, then added the spices, and then the beef.  Added the rest and then simmered for 1.5-2 hours.  The simmering time to reduce all the extra liquid is key to make a rich sauce!! Very tasty.

Simple, quick, tasty, and versatile.  I doubled the recipe with...used pre-cut stew meat, half butter, half olive oil and to thicken it up added a package of mushroom gravy mix.  Served over noodles with crescents & garlic sauteed asparagas... the boys did rock, paper, scissors over last portion.

Very good, I served it with rice. I didn't add the wine, and used fresh mushrooms. I also dredged the meat in flour, and I think that's what made my gravy nice and thick.

This was so easy and so good. I had 2.5 pounds of meat so I used more tomato sauce, wine, and garlic. I also added in a little chopped onion with the garlic and beef. I put a bay leaf and a little oregano in the sauce while it simmered and served it all over mashed potatoes. I'll probably make noodles for the leftovers.

Sorry, I just didn't care for this. Not enough flavor alone with these ingredients. I ended up adding a whole bunch of other stuff to this so that the family would eat it. When cooking this kind of meat it is good to cook in the crockpot all day so the meat will just melt in your mouth.

Sorry, not for me!  I was excited to try this after the great reviews, and followed the recipe exactly.  The meat soaked up none of the flavor, and it just tasted kind of weird.  My carnivore daughter wouldn't touch it after the first bite.  Might be okay for some, but not us.

I used sirloin, fresh mushrooms and onions. This was gross when I tasted it. The wine flavor was overwhelming and there was no salt at all.  I added a half a can of tomato paste, 2 boullion cubes and some salt.  MUCH BETTER, but still not SUPER. I doubt I will make it again.

This is such an awesome dinner! I covered my skillet and let it simmer for about 1 hour.The sauce was still watery,so I uncovered the skillet the last 20 minutes or so,and turned up the heat. The result was a delicious,fork tender topping for buttered noodles. I also used fresh mushrooms and compensated by adding alittle extra water,instead of the canned mushrooms with juice.My family LOVES this meal! :)

Great recipe that was liked by my husband and picky children.  I used others suggestions and added 1 beef bouillon cube, a bay leaf and thyme.  I also thickened the sauce with corn starch at the end and served over buttered noodles. Yum, will make this again!

This recipe was great!  Made it with garlic butter noodles.  Also went with a 17 oz. can of diced tomatoes and 2 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce, 2 bay leaves, 1 TB thyme and 3 TB beef base as suggested and I used Blueberry wine.  Tasted great, will make again.

This recipe was very good.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and just added a little beef broth to make up for the liquid in the canned mushrooms.  Turned out great.  Served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta or rice to make the meal low carb.

I tried this one out since I had all the ingredients on hand and found it to be much like making a quick stroganoff...I even tried putting a little dollop of sour cream on the side just to compare the differences.  It was good either way!  I also did add some onion and thickened my sauce with a roux....next time I'll use less tomato sauce and perhaps try adding in some beef bouillon for extra flavor.  Overall a simple meal served with buttered egg noodles and parmesan tossed zucchini.

Came in late last night after soccer practices and games, the computer was down so I couldn't access allrecipes to get my recipe and I just tried to remember the best that I could. After I mixed in the ingredients, the computer comes back up and wouldn't you know, I had combined two different recipes. I will be posting the same review for both because it worked great.
I used fresh mushrooms and one can of beef broth, added thyme. I think the sirloin maybe was a little dried out and next time I wouldn't brown as long as I did or even better I think I will make it with beef tenderloin. The sauce was great when combined with the other recipe (see reviews). Went great with Yellow Tail Shiraz Cab and I actually used a straight Shiraz instead of burgundy in the recipe (the other recipe). Sorry for the very confusing review -- It is just a very good recipe.

I was a bit disappointed in this. The sauce was too watery and the sirloin tips seemed overcooked.

I know there is always someone who doesnt like a recipe and for this one it is me. I personally didnt care for the sauce. No one liked it. I followed the directions and it still came out unediable. Sorry but this will  not be a keeper.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy to prepare, and my whole family - kids included - loved it.  The only thing I did different was to thicken the sauce a little at the end with cornstarch...it was very watery.  Excellent dish - I'm going to email it to my friends!

I made it almost exactly as stated, except I used fresh mushrooms and sirloin steak.  It was very good but lacked depth of flavor.   I don't know how you can take a recipe and change every single thing about it, and then rate it terrible.  Seriously?  This was a great recipe, just needed more salt or garlic.

Didn't change anything except I added green pepper. I was not impressed it just tasted like tomato sauce, no flavor what so ever. I thought with the garlic and wine it would be delicious, it wasn't . Will not be making this again

This turned out badly. Instead of beef I used chicken. Instead of mushrooms I used canned artichokes. Instead of garlic I used minced onions and added celery. Instead of tomato sauce I used ketchup with a dash of soy sauce. Instead of red wine I used sweet rose. What a terrible recipe.

This was a great sirloin tip recipe that was very easy. Only change I recommend is an extra 10min. on the final step. I do all the cooking at our house and will soon make this again.

I made this for a wedding reception.  Multiplied it by 17. Used fresh mushrooms   tomato sauce and diced canned tomatoes. Pinot noire is the darling of red wines.  Made a terrific entree.

Absolutely delicious! I used merlot and a bit more than the recipe called for, and tossed in two bouillon cubes to thicken it a bit. Only thing missing was some good crusty bread to sop up the gravy afterwards.

It was a little too rich with the tomato sauce. If I made it again, I’d cut back on that dramatically. Couldn’t taste the steak.

Great recipe. I did it in the crockpot, making adjustments on the amount of broth and water used - a little less. My husband loved this - that always counts for something!

We had to throw it away. Maybe it's because I used Shiraz red wine? Maybe? Will search for a different Sirloin Tip recipe.

I made it when we couldn't find my wife's sirloin tips recipe .
I must say this is similar but better . We also used the wine instead of all water. It was a huge hit . My two year old granddaughter put her first sentence together over this meal.When my son tried to take her spoon away from her to give her some water she said( no that's mine).There was not a morsel left 5 stars

Well, I followed the recipe,so I have only myself to blame.  The end result, and if I had just thought about it , is the same as putting ketchup on steak.

It was pretty good and my family liked it fine.  Not anything that great that I think I need to print the recipe out and save it.  I would make it again, but wouldn't think I would go out of my way to do so.

This is so simply and turns out quite satisfying.  I used fresh mushrooms.  This is one of those recipes that do not require a trip to the grocery store to gather ingredients.  Leftovers are great, too.

Made this tonight for dinner.  My husband and I both liked it.  I did modify slightly based upon some reviews.  I shook the beef cubes with flour and pepper before browning and I added extra mushrooms because we love them.  The sauce came out a bit too soupy for me.  It is a good base and I will make it again, but with more modifications -will try it with tomato paste and a little water to see if that binds the sauce better, will try adding onions and beef bouillon and maybe some cayenne pepper or hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

I used 16oz. of fresh mushrooms and 1/4c water, and added bay leaf and thyme, as another reviewer suggested.  Other than that, I made this as directed.  The sauce was great, but the beef was slightly bland.  Next time I'll try seasoning the beef before browning.

Easy and quick. As others suggested added:
coated beef w/flour, browned beef w/chopped onion & fresh mushrooms, added beef bouillon instead of salt, bay leaf, thyme & worcestershire sauce. Everyone enjoyed it!

Definitely use fresh mushrooms and add some sliced onion to the garlic. If more liquid is needed use beef broth. Very rich flavor goes well with noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes.

This recipe definitely has the potential  to be great but as written it's good.  It needs more flavour and would be so much better with fresh mushroom, herbs and onions. Thanks for sharing GRANNYA.

Enjoy this dish I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: 1/4 c water,  beef bouillon cube, 2 tbsp. brown sugar and bay leaf (3); I didn't have any mushrooms but it was good without, next time I'll add.

I cooked as indicated. Stroooong flavors all together. Next time, just half of tomatoe sauce. Too long cooking time. I have to cut it to a third of the time. The rest, is an ok recipe. I might cook it again w the suggested changes.

Everyone loved it! I used fresh mushrooms and doubled the recipe. There was enough liquid after the meat cooked up and didn't need to add any extra like I thought I would since I didn't used canned mushrooms. Good over mashed potatoes.

I put this in the slow cooker and it turned out great.  Instead of 16 oz of canned mushrooms, I used 16 oz fresh and 2 oz can with juice.  I would have went with just fresh but thought that something maybe lost with total exclusion.  Next time I will go with just fresh.  I don't think more wine is needed.  I like to cook with wine and this had enough flavor as written.

The beef was still on the tough side after the recommended cooking time, so I had to add a cup of beef broth and simmer it an extra hour.  This did result in tender beef tips, but the sauce was pretty sour because of the tomato sauce.  I will salvage the leftover beef tips and serve them in mushroom gravy.

Seems like a half-done recipe.  Really benefits from adding some thyme, and a bay leaf, and something to thicken the liquid, in my opinion (too soupy).  After dinner I actually just added what was left of the mashed potatoes and the next day it tasted really great, but next time I make it I would add a Tbsp or two of flour after cooking the meat and before adding the tomatoes and mushrooms to get a thicker sauce

I am giving this 4 stars because I did add a few things.  Italian seasonings and beef bullion.  In hindsight I should have done pepper too, but it was very good!

Me and my husband loved this!! and of course, I  change it around a little. I put a can of basil, garlic and onion tomatoes in with the steak b/c I had no tomato sauce. I totally forgot about the wine which was perfect without it. I also added fresh onions & mushrooms then... 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up - let it simmer until the meat was tender. I will definitley be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Sauce was tasty, a bit too salty for my taste. Sauce was also too thin. I let it reduce for quite a while and it just did not thicken much. I used a little corstarch mixed with a little extra wine to thicken and it was much better.

This was good. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (I hate canned mushrooms!). I tasted it while it was simmering and it was a little acidic and also a little bland so ended up adding some onion powder and a bay leaf for flavour and about a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the acidity. I'll make this again with these additions, but I'll use the slow cooker so the meat be more tender.

This is good, but there was far too much liquid.  I suggest only using 1  (8 oz) can of mushrooms w/liquid and no more than 3/4 cup of red wine. There is enough liquid to go over the noodles.

I used stew meat, 1/2 cup burgandy wine, and 1/4 cup sherry, fresh mushrooms (i mean really...canned? ewww) and added 1/4 cup water to replace canned mushroom liquid, as well as 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 bay leaf, 1 tsp thyme and about 1-2 tsps worstishire sauce (as well as tomato sauce and a little bit of salt)  First I browned the meat w/the olive oil and garlic, then I threw it all in the crock pot for almost 4 hours on high. Sauce was DELICIOUS! (but not thick at all, if doing crock pot, don't add water, and maybe throw in some cornstarch or flour) Meat was kind of dry, but I blame the stew meat. Served over mashed potatoes. Nice easy recipe

My husband and I both loved the flavor.  I did add 2 tbsp of brown sugar as one reviewer suggested, just to take the bite out of the wine/tomato sauce though. The meat was way over done but I'm not sure if it's because of the cut that I chose or the timing. I actually cooked it less than recommended because I was worried that it was over cooking.  Is that the reason my tips were tough/dry?  Is it that they're undercooked or does dryness seal the deal for it being overcooked?  Does anyone know?

This is one of our favorite meals. Only thing different I do is use fresh baby bella mushrooms and add rosemary or thyme. Or both. Really awesome paired with The Best Mashed Potatoes, which are also from this site. NOTE: You can use stew meat. You just have to simmer it a little longer.

This recipe was awesome!  I only added one small can of mushrooms (our personal preference).  I also used red wine vinegar as I didn't have any red wine.  I added a little bit of flour at the end to thicken the sauce.  It was a great meal that I will definitely make again.

This was really good. I used fresh mushrooms and diced onions seasoned with seasoned salt and pepper. Also used beef boullion(no water) and a can of red gold diced tomatoes with basil and oregano. I had 1 lb. of sirloin and 1 lb. of chuck steak, simmered for almost 2 hours and the meat was sooooo tender. I served it over rice with french style green beans on the side and crusty bread.I will definitely make this again!

I only gave it three stars because I won't be having it for supper. The recipe says it serves six and there is only enough for three and I need to feed four tonight. It tasted okay when I sampled it. Next time I make it I will double it. I made buttered noodles but mashed potatoes sound better.

While this was nothing special, it tasted good enough that most of us finished our portions. It did not have a distinctive flavor. Maybe if we use fresh mushrooms?

This was excellent!  I cut the canned mushrooms in half and then added some fresh sliced mushrooms instead.  Also, added a little thickening agent (corn starch) at the end so it thicked up more like a gravy.  It was a big hit!

I fixed this for my daughters lunch one day. It was excellent.
I did add a few slices of bell pepper, and sauteed with the onions.
 It will be made again soon.
We loved it!

I took the suggestions of others on this and added a little brown sugar and thyme, but didn't think it was all that great.  I probably needed to cook it a little longer, I let it simmer for 30 mins.  I can see where the crock pot might mix the flavors and soften tough meat better.  The flavor to me was iffy though. I will probably experiment a little more and maybe add onion next time.

This recipe was not a "got to have" one, but it was a nice variety to use up some meat we had in the freezer that needed to be used up.  I followed advice, such as adding a TBSP of minced garlic, 1/2 a can of milk (can is from the cream of mushroom soup), and I put some condenced beef broth and pepper.  My husband does not like onions, so I used some dried chopped onions to the mixture and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Came out pretty good.  This is a great recipe to use up meat that has been in the freezer too long.

Since I don't eat meat and wanted to try this recipe, I made a separate pan for myself with tofu. The tofu turned a strange shade of purple, but it was delicious! I used fresh mushrooms which made it even better. Then I used a Shiraz, which was the only "red" wine I had on hand (that I was willing to give up for cooking!). I will definitely make this again!

These were so good!  We didn't even put them on noodles, just ate them as the main course.  I'd recommend getting really tender/quality meat, because cooking it this long makes it a little tough.  Marinating for 4-5 hours would also help soften the meat if you got lower quality beef.

The sauce was wonderful, but the beef didn't absorb any of it.  I'm always looking for flavorful beef recipes and this one did not make the cut.

Absolutely, positively great.  I dusted the beef with flour, used baby bella mushrooms (no mushroom juice)and the sauce consistency was just perfect.  This is a recipe I will make again and again. Thanks.

This one is a winner, although it needs way more than 30 minutes for the meat to get tender and the sauce to thicken (even with addition of cornstartch). Next time I'll try an hour.

I thought this recipe was excellent!!  It had so much flavor and I didn't even add the wine.  I thought there was enough liquid from the mushrooms and sauce.  I just thickened it up with some cornstarch and served over egg noodles.  My fiance said it had sort of wine flavor to it even without the wine.

This one is definitely a keeper.  Added a small chopped onion as others have suggested.  Also, thickened at the end with a Tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a little cold water.  8 oz fresh mushrooms rather than the canned (would use the canned in a pinch).  Served over egg noodles - this was delicious.  Hubby insists this is much better (and less fat) than stroganoff.  Will be making this one again and again!

Very good!  The only things I did were add about 1 T. of flour to thicken gravy and also add 1-2 T. brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato sauce and wine (just a personal preference).  Too many mushrooms for my family's liking--I only added a 7 oz. jar, and they were still complaining, but that's just THEM!~ anyway, with the changes, it's a definite keeper.

I made this last night, and didn't change a thing, and served with Creamy Mashed Potatoes II. It was a huge hit! Even my 10 and 2 year old picky eaters loved it! I have already invited my in-laws over in two weeks for this meal!

This is definitely an easy recipe to make. Next time I will follow suggestions of others and add only 1/2 the tomato sauce (or just diced tomatoes instead). I also used cooking sherry and will only add 1/2 cup next time as it was a little saltier than I expected. Overall this recipe fits in well with my low-carb diet, no noodles for me, but it still tastes great!

Wonderful flavor and consistancy. The sauce was thin, however, for this recipe, it was quite fitting. It was a big hit! Maybe try using chicken instead? Definatley a must try! Absolutly wonderful!

Fabulous!  Dinner smelled wonderful as it cooked and tasted even better, and it was so simple to make!  I will definitely try it with onions and fresh mushrooms next time.  Be sure to let it simmer the full 30 minutes so the sauce can thicken.

Excellent recipe!  Like others, I thickened the sauce a bit, using a flour/oil roux.  Otherwise, we loved every bite.  Brought leftovers for lunch today, and someone commented "wow, it smells like REAL food in here."  I can think of no higher compliment!

I made this for my family and they loved it. I did follow a few of the suggested changes. I added 2 cubes of bouillon, spicy Mexican tomato sauce and fresh mushrooms.  Cooked on med low for about 40 min. Placed over rice. The only issue was there was not enough sauce. Next time I will make more sauce.

The 5-star rating is based on my changes: I substituted the red winds for beef broth and used a garlic based marinara sauce instead of can of tomato sauce! And I added about 3 more garlic cloves too! Let it simmer in crock pot on high for 5 hours! Super yummy :)

Excellent, simple recipe.  I doubled it. I also followed a couple of changes noted by others: I used fresh mushrooms, and some chopped onions. I added "Better than Boullion" beef stock goo; I used 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 of tomato paste; I added 1 tbsp. brown sugar; and I thickened the sauce (in my case, with arrowroot, as I couldn't find my cornstarch). One observation: TAKE YOUR TIME LETTING IT SIMMER!!! The sauce goes from strong, almost harsh, unbalanced wine/tomato flavors, to very smooth, rich, mellow, and balanced if you let it simmer very gently for at least 40 minutes. It is excellent served over mashed potatoes - the flavors blend beautifully. AND - it reheats like a champ!

I followed the suggestions by some of the reviewers - added some brown sugar, bay, thyme, and used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce,  fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and pork stock because I had some.  I browned the meat, deglazed the pan, then slow cooked it for 4 hours.  It was AMAZING!  Definitely going to make this again!

Nice recipe, I'd recommend cutting back on the liquid as the sauce was a bit watery, or you could add 1/2 cup of tomato sauce to accommodate it. I only cooked it for 20 minutes and the beef was cooked thoroughly,, so if you like it on the red side, cook it less than 20 minutes.

It was ok. My meat was pretty tough so didn't love it. Perhaps with a better cut of meat it would be better.

Made this according to the recipe the first time, (with the exception of using fresh mushrooms) and we found it to be good, but the flavor was somewhat lacking dimension. So the next time, I added some beef broth and about 1/2 tsp herbes de Provence and a bay leaf. This filled out the flavor profile considerably. Additionally, I made it in the Instant Pot. Browned 1” beef cubes lightly in a little butter using the sauté function, stirred in the garlic and fresh mushrooms for a couple of minutes, then added the wine, reducing it by half, probably 4-5 minutes. Added about 1/4 cup beef broth, tomato sauce, and bay leaf, put on the lid and set the manual function for 25 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally. It was full of deep, rich flavor, and the meat was fork-tender. Fast and easy, and only one pot to wash.

I only had a package of tips in the freezer so I found this recipe and made it. I didnt have any wine so I substituted red wine vinegar and added a couple of ounces of water to thin it
 The recipe came out great!

The directions don't say whether to cook with the top on or off. I read the various reviews, so I added the brown sugar; I don't drink wine so I bought the wrong kind hahaha otherwise the recipe was good, but next time I'll use mashed potatoes instead of ziti pasta.

DELIC!!! I try to stick as close as possible to recipe first time and it was fantastic. I used canned mushrooms but drained the water from them. My meat cooked much faster than the said time (used cast iron pot)

In addition to the original recipe, I added two bay leaves, a teaspoon of Better Than Bouillon Beef, two tsp of brown sugar, one tsp thyme.  Served over white rice and with broccoli.  Next time, may try using tomato paste to thicken it up because it’s quite liquidy.  Very very tasty recipe.  Would make this again in a heartbeat.  Easy and quick too.

This was really, really good. My hubby and Mom liked it very much. Nice rich flavor. I followed other reviewers advice and added a more wine toward the end, 2 tbsps of butter once it came off the heat and I used a can of beef broth instead of the bullion cube. Next time I'll add an onion. Served it on top of rice. Definitely worth making.

Using sirloin is tricky.  It is extremely hard to find good sirloin that has enough marbled fat to prevent it from bring tough.  Will try the recipe again but with out cooking the steak in the sauce and probably using a tenderloin tip.

This has become my new favorite dish.  I used fresh mushrooms and fire-roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I added 2 TBPS brown sugar like someone has suggested, and used 1/4 Cup beef broth instead of water.  Cooked it on low for almost an hour.  I served it over mushroom flavored egg noodles.  The most delicious dish ever!

I made this a couple of weeks ago. I used this recipe as my starting point. I added one chopped onion and instead of beef, I used bear stew meat. (If I didn't tell you it was bear, you would not have known.) It was very tender and delicious! I served it over wide egg noodles. My grandsons liked it so much they were fighting over the leftovers. Today I am making it again, this time with beef tenderloin and fresh mushrooms, and I'm adding a few ingredients that others have recommended, like Worcestershire sauce and Italian herbs and throwing everything in the crockpot. I like changing things up. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Made once and will make it again! Not your usual sirloin tips. We were used to having them with a creamy type of sauce, but these turn out more like Chinese spare ribs, so I don’t really recommend serving with noodles. Better with a veg and salad. Also, can tend toward dryness, so definitely use extra wine! Very delicious!

Did make 2 changes browned the meat then with just enough beef broth and tablespoon  of worcheshire  covered and simmered for 45 min.
Then added the rest o the ingredients.Used fresh mushrooms. We agreed sauce could be thicker.

I will definitely make it again.  I will make sure the meat is
tenderized in a pressure cooker or slow cooker however.
I may have rushed it.

This was a real keeper.  I sautéed fresh shitake mushrooms instead of using the canned ones.  I also added a sautéed sweet onion.  I will definitely be making this again.

Was more of a soup or stew, and did not come out as I had hoped. Out of a family of 5, myself and one of our kids enjoyed it, but not enough to make it again.

I omitted wine and used beef stock instead. I cut the recipe in half (cooking for 2) but used the entire can of tomato sauce rather than have it left over. Very good. Served with noodles.

I used whole button mushrooms. Also a little more pepper than I should have (by accident), but was actually a plus. Also, felt the sauce was a little thin so added some corn starch mixed with red wine. Dish came out perfectly and wife loved it.

This was delicious!!  Used fresh mushrooms (one pound), white wine, and 3/4 cup of chicken broth that I had on hand.  It came out amazing.  Served it over tiny ditalini  pasta and even though everyone was looking for leftovers, there were none!

We really like the recipe. I used our buffalo stew meat and took another reviewers advice and simmered it in beef stock for a hour or so and then followed the recipe other than adding onions.  I cooked it longer though because buffalo can be a bit tough because it’s so lean.

I used 16oz of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned ones and added half a can of beef stock to replace the missing liquid. Then I reduced the liquids down quite a bit to thicken the sauce. The first time I served it as a sauce over tater tots, and topped it with shredded mozzarella and sour cream. The flavors are simply outstanding. I will definitely make this again.

Yes, I did make changes.  I added some thyme, a cup of beef broth and a tablespoon of tomato paste, which I believe enriched the sauce.  Otherwise, the flavor was a little bland.  This recipe comes together very quickly but simmering longer will make the meat more tender.

I took several of the suggestions to add tomato paste. To me, this still came out very “tomatoey” and on the sweet side. So I added a tablespoon of Better Than Bouillon - Beef Base to the recipe and it really calmed the sweetness down more to my liking. This is a quick and easy meal that can be made in under 30 minutes from start to finish!

We loved it, but I definitely made some changes.   I added carrots and also added onions and some herbs like basil and oregano.  I have made this 3 times and am making it again today.  Very good meal!  Also, I cook it for hours so that the beef is fall apart tender.  Yummm!

I made this recipe as written and then as it was simmering I freaked out about the amount of tomato sauce. I spent about 45 minutes trying to tone it down.  it was an easy recipe and I might make it again, but only with maybe one eighth of the amount of the tomato sauce. my husband liked it but said as he got to the end of eating it the tomato sauce was overpowering.

This is a very good recipe that is easy to make.  I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned mushrooms and it worked well.  I also substituted beef broth for the red wine, and it also worked well.  My family loved it!

This really was not very good, the tomato sauce was to strong, none of us liked it much and I would not make it again.  I did add some fresh parsley just for a a little color, I used fresh mushrooms, they did taste good, best part of the dish.

This was excellent over egg noodles. I followed a suggestion to use a box of fresh mushrooms and 1/2 cup water instead of canned mushrooms. Also added a bay leaf and thyme. I didn’t have red wine so I used a teaspoon of red wine vinegar. I also added carrot slices to the meat with onions and garlic. My 3 teenage boys raved over it!

Good! Make sure to buy an actual red wine, not a red wine blend. I got a red wine blend that was kind of sweet. It was still good but would have been better with a full on Cabernet.

Yes I made only minor changes. I used fresh mushrooms instead. 1-28oz Can of diced tomatoes, + 2 -9.6oz/284mls of Tomato Sauce. 1.5Tbsp of Worchestshire sauce. 3 cloves garlic. 1 heaping tsp of Oregano,  1-lge onion,  & 1-cup of Cabernet-Merlot wine. I Sauteed the meat with onions & garlic in frypan & transferred to crockpot, added the other ingredients & cooked on low, for  approx 6.5hrs. I will be freezing this in individual portions for my future meals. Very tasty indeed. Don't forget to leave on some of the white fat on the mat as it adds even more flavor. Bone a Petite.

Totally tasteless is the only way I could describe it.  I added the garlic, and a good dose of salt and pepper, simmer cooked for 40 mins and served over egg noodles.  Way too blah.

Would not make again.

The recipe was a good one!  I used white zin instead of red wine and I used fresh portobello mushrooms. The meat wasn't as tender as I would've liked but I think it had more to do with the meat than the recipe.  My spouse liked it and I would make it again!

Made this tonight and boy was it yummy.  Per other reviews, I did the following:  browned meat, some onions and garlic and added beef bouillon (with a dash of worcestershire) to cover, and about 2 T of tomato sauce.  Covered and cooked for 30 minutes.   
Add mushrooms, and 1/2 cup of wine.  Cover again and cook an additional 30 minutes.  Mix about 1 T flour in to some beef bouillon and add to mixture to thicken.  Serve over noodles.

I used Menage a Trois wine I purchased at Costco.  I used it for 
2 recipes so far, and it gives it a fabulous flavor.

5 star recipe for sure! I used beef stew meat which is probably why I had to cook it for longer, about an hour and a half and it was so tender and delicious. For wine I used merlot and added beef stock; served over homemade mashed potatoes one day and rice the next.

I made this with stew beef as that's what I had, and cut back slightly on the wine. This came out great. Served it with mixed root veggies and potatoes. Will certainly make it again.

Much like a beef burgundy but easier.  I would recommend not adding salt if using canned mushrooms.  Already plenty of salt.  Someone used fresh mushrooms, I may do that in the future.  I did add 2 bay leaves, 1 Tbsp thyme (I think I'd cut in half next time)  and 3 Tbsp beef base with the liquids.  Would be really good over noodles.

Simple to make, good flavor.  I used fresh mushrooms sauteed in a Pam-sprayed pan with a good splash of  Worcestershire  Sauce added part way through.  Didn't need to brown the beef since I used rare roast beef left over from a Christmas rib roast.  Added a sprinkle of Thyme and two Bay Leaves as recommended in other reviews.  Covered the pot and simmered for 20 min at medium low heat.  Beef stayed tender!

I made this, but I didn't have mushrooms or tomato sauce on hand.  I went without the mushrooms and substituted the tomato sauce with vegetable juice cocktail.  It was really good that way, so I am looking forward to trying it with the mushrooms and tomato sauce.

This was delicious! I had some sirloin steaks we were given and wasn’t sure what to do with them as it’s generally a tougher cut of meat. I doubled the recipe, added 3 T brown sugar, 1 T of balsamic vinegar, oregano and thyme to taste, and also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

Used sirloin tip and large mushrooms cut in half.  Added Worcestershire and HP steak sauce. Thickened with a can of mushroom soup. Served over egg noodles. Made for Sunday supper and everyone liked it.  Made in slow cooker. Put large beef pieces in ziplock bag and coated with flour and spices before browning.

Good, but lacked something. Followed the recipe very closely, other than adding seasoned flour to meat before cooking (win), fresh mushrooms (win), pureeing tomatoes for sauce (lose), and adding bay leaves (neutral). It was OK. I think the tomatoes were wrong in it, maybe tomato paste and beef broth would have improved it overall. Will try again. Served with green beans and buttered noodles.

I made it with some of the revisions suggested by other reviewers--fresh mushrooms, a bullion cube, thyme and a bay leaf--and it was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

More like 3.5. Flavor was good however it was so soupy I had to add corn starch for the sauce to thicken. I cooked the beef for 30 minutes and the beef was very tough still. Next time I will make it in the crock pot

I will not make this recipe again.  Even though there's only eight ounces of tomato sauce in it, the flavor was too much like pasta meat sauce for us.  We like pasta meat sauce but I already make a killer meat sauce, and we were looking for something different.  Now I know -- NO tomatoes!   LOL!  Even a little becomes the dominant flavor.  What I will do is come up with something using beef stock, a roux, and red wine.  Possibly add just a bit of cream towards the end.  This recipe wasn't bad by any means; it just wasn't what I'd hoped for.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! The rich, savory sauce is delicious, and it is complimented tremendously by the meat and mushrooms. If you are not one who appreciates the strong taste of red wine present in a meal, then you might want to cut the wine measurement in half. I would definitely suggest serving this sauce over pasta or with a loaf of fresh bread. The richness of the sauce is and would be accentuated by the  flavor and texture of the pasta or bread. I look forward to making this again in the future!

Used fresh mushrooms and a splash of beef broth in place of the jar of mushrooms. Liked the sauce but the steak came out chewy and over-cooked. I may have seared it for too long. I will be trying it again.

Note: As much as I hate reviewers who leave an ingredient out and then complain about it, I'm doing it right now! :-P I made this even though I didn't have canned mushrooms on hand. It turned out well, but a little bland for my taste. The tips cooked up well and made a terrific sauce/thin gravy that worked well on arepas. I don't think the canned mushrooms would have helped the lack of seasoning, but perhaps the umami would have made it better. To be perfectly fair I will definitely make it again and will re-rate!

This was very good. The only change was I added onions. Used a lambrusco for the wine  and since the mushrooms were fresh instead of canned, I used a little beef broth for the liquid that would have been in the can.

There was none left. My husband went back for seconds

Made as recipe states.  WAY too much liquid so ended up throwing out much of it.  The flavor was good, but too much waste for me to even try again.  Think the liquid from the mushrooms was way too much.

Great recipe. totally got me by surprise. I used a beef skirt, Tomato paste mixed with some beef broth(I was short a few oz), someone suggested cooking sherry wine. My wife loved it. Although the meat was tender, I will give myself more time to make the meat more tender

Very flavorful! I added my own little twist by substituting the red wine for beef broth, using fresh mushrooms instead of canned, adding fresh spinach along with onion powder and celery salt. Tastes great over jasmine rice!

OMG DELICIOUS! Though I added a few ingredients based off of recommendations here, it still turned out extremely delicious! I bumped up red wine to 1.5 cups, added 1 tablespoon of oregano, thyme, italian seasoning, and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I would make the tomato sauce Ragu 7 spice tomato sauce and change it up to 14.5 ounces. I also added a chopped onion while browning, as well as 2 chopped carrots while adding the rest of the ingredients. It had a little bit of an acidic kick, but it was extremeeeeely good!

I really liked it! I made it as-is except I didn’t have any red wine. I used beef broth and a splash of balsamic vinegar for the acidity. Next time I will definitely add onion, maybe some carrots, and I’ll use half the mushrooms.

My husband and I made this tonight and we are very impressed!  We followed the recipe exactly as written but added a bit more red wine toward the end.  We served it over noodles.  We gobbled it right up and both of us are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!  We will definitely make this again...and again and again!

Good, but not great.  My crew asked me not to make it again.  They said it tasted a little "like chunks of meat cooked in tomato paste".  :(  Somehow they missed the delicacies of red wine and shiitake mushrooms... plus the delicious hint of Worcestershire.  Unfortunately,  I have to agree with their assessment; the overall taste wasn't much more than fancy tomato sauce with chunks of meat.

This was delicious! I let it simmer until the beef was  very tender which took about 2 hours... but it was well worth the wait.  I also added some sliced  onion and used fresh white mushrooms with some beef broth . Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this twice now. The first time exactly as written and would give it 4 Stars. I thought it was tasty, but didn’t thicken up as much as I would have liked and wasn’t quite as flavorful as I expected. The second time I changed it up based on other reviews and would give it 5 Stars.  I put the beef in a gallon bag with 1/2 cup of flour and cracked pepper and shook the beef to coat. Then I browned the beef with garlic as the recipe states in oil. After browning, I added fresh mushrooms with 1/2-3/4cup water and one beef boullion cube, 3/4cup red wine, 8 oz of tomato sauce, and a 1/2tsp of thyme. Simmered on low for 35-40 minutes and served over egg noodles. It was wonderful! It was thick and rich. My husband and sons ate every bite and have already requested that I make it again next week. Thank you for a rather quick, easy and tasty recipe!

Used sliced fresh mushrooms and cubed sirloin steak.  After simmering the meat was fairly tender. Was a hit. Don’t understand why someone would say the sauce was really strong...I guess if you don’t like wine sauce because otherwise it is not spicy or acidic or too tomato-ey.

This was really good! I made it according to the recipe, although I did have to use some New York Strip, and replaced red wine with white. It was still amazing, and the whole family enjoyed it too :)

I really wanted to like this, it looked and sounded so good. Unfortunately it was just kind of tough and flavorless, despite adding more spices/seasonings at the end. My son loves steak and he wouldn't eat it either.

Perfect as written. Do not add anything. Used 8 oz fresh mushrooms. Sauce was plenty thick.

Following other's advice I added a cup of chopped onions.  I only used 1/2 can of the tomato sauce as I didn't want a red sauce.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes. I did not use canned mushrooms but added a box of fresh, sliced the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I found using my Dutch oven really was much better than the stove top method as everything had cooked down well.  I served this over thin egg noodles and it was a real hit.

I will make this again   I would also use fresh mushrooms next time though. Otherwise I’d make it as it says. I did brown the meat first. I let most of the liquid dissolve and next time I will leave it a bit more soupy.

Really great! Comments about sauce being a little runny are def true. I thickened it up with pasta sauce and some extra tomatoes. Also added a bit of brown sugar to make it more savory!

I added butter and flour to thicken the liquid into a sauce. Perhaps it could have used a dash of Worcestershire sauce, as it lacked a meaty flavor.

I made it for Sunday dinner. I had it with stir-fried rice, peas and carrots, corn muffins, iced tea, (with a side of chocolate cake).  Didn't change a thing, but i did add a few sauteed onions. The guests loved it!!

This was only ok for me. Meat was very tough and I didn't cook as long as it suggested. I think the tomato sauce really gave it an odd taste, personally. Very bland.

Used 2 cans of fire roasted garlic. Chopped up a tri-tip I had in the freezer for the meat.  Followed the device of other reviewers and used fresh mushrooms and added garlic, Italian seasoning, basil, and beef cubes (3). The misses said it was a keeper. I agree.

This was great!! I used stew beef and made the changes and additions many, many of the others here have suggested. Fresh mushrooms, beef stock, bay leaf and onion all added a nice, cozy comfort to this hearty dish. Cook time was about 2 hours for me.  Served with rice, which soaked up most of the liquid. I think next time I will try the mashed potatoes!

I prefer to use fresh mushrooms over canned and my sauce is made with the drippings from cooking the meat. Serves well over both pasta or rice with a nice serving of vegetables of choice.

I've made this recipe twice.  It was  easy and yummy both times.

The first time I served it with rice.  This time I took the suggestion to use noodles.  Either works.  

I cook with what I have on hand.  So the mushrooms were dehydrated shiitake and the  garlic was powder the first time and canned chopped this time around.  

Great way to prepare sirloin beef tips!

Great basic recipe. I used fresh crimini mushrooms, added grated carrot and doubled the garlic. I switched the 1/4c of water for 1/3c beef stock. While simmering, I added 4Tbls of brown sugar and 2 Tbls of Worcestershire sauce. Finally, I served it over jasmati rice that I cooked with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. The sauce was loose, but serving it over rice room care of that.

This recipe was great! My husband & 85 year old mom who love flavor but nothing "hot" raved over it. I only had a pound of sirloin strips so I cut the ingredients by a third. Also I had just one 4 oz. can of mushrooms but lots of fresh; so I sliced them and added a bit of liquid. I had to wait a bit for the pasta to boil do it could have benefited from some extra liquid.

This is a great basic recipe you can add or change up ingredients a bit as other reviewers have suggested. I smashed the garlic so it would not burn during browning and used fresh mushrooms. The most fantastic thing I did was serve this over Chef John's Celery Root & Potato Puree from this All Recipes site.  It was plate licking good! Try it, you'll love it.

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this!!! My mom tried it and immediately took the recipe to make for my dad. I too added some previously suggested items. I added one beef bouillon cube and 1/4 cup of water while simmering. I also added some dried onion. I served it over brown rice and it was delicious!

I combined a few different suggestions.  My husband and I could hardly keep ourselves from seconds because we wanted another meal from this culinary effort. I used 1 15oz. can of Muir Glen organic diced tomatoes; Carnivore cabernet savignon; fresh mushrooms of course; and 1/2 teaspoon of  Minor's beef base instead of bullion. I did have to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and water.  This recipe is definitely  going into my  meal rotation!!! Served this up with Julia Child's Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

Made this pretty true to recipe. Used fresh mushrooms and added a little onion and a bay leaf and a 1/4 can of tomato paste. Served over buttered egg noodles. Husband had seconds! Will definitely make this again.

I altered the recipe by using cream of mushroom soup instead of tomato sauce. I also used jarred button mushrooms because I dislike mushrooms in a can. with 10 minutes of cook time left I added a packet of brown gravy. It thickened wonderfully and I served it over mashed potatoes.  I will be adding this to my collection!

I will make it again when I have time to cook the sirloin tips longer. It was a little tough but the taste was great. I made a couple of changes. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. I doubled the recipe so I used one can of spicy tomato sauce with green chiles and one regular tomato sauce (8 oz both) I cooked fresh mushrooms in the pan drippings before putting the meat back in. I also added about 1/4 cup light brown sugar and thickened it with cornstarch and water. The flavors were wonderful! We ate it with Jasmine rice seasoned with bouillon cubes.

Family love it!  Easy to make and delicious to boot . Added one bouillon cube , some onion powder and garlic powder. Just a pinch of powders to give it more flavor.  I will make this recipe again and again. Great weekday dinner. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great base recipe that we really liked. I did make a few changes - fresh mushrooms, used beef broth instead of wine (will use the wine next time, I only had 1 bottle of red that I wasn't ready to open yet) - added a little thyme (maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp) and a splash of Worcestershire. We served this one with brown rice. I love that this uses real food and is so simple to make - I will make this again and may adapt it for the slowcooker. Great for a weeknight meal, and would be nice enough for company.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is easy and elegant.  I rank the recipe an overall 4 for taste.  I drank the red wine and used a mixture of left over sherry and marsala.  It was tasty.

Yum! Great and easy recipe! The only thing I did different was add a whole chopped white onion to it while the meat was browning and used fresh baby portabello mushrooms. I was nervous with all the liquid at first but after simmering for 40 minutes it was the perfect gravy consistency! Yum! Served it over garlic brown rice and quinoa. Will make again!

This was yummy.  I used fresh mushrooms and added onion.  Then I threw in an envelope of dried beef onion soup mix and a half can of beef broth.  Served it over rice instead of noodles to reduce gluten.  Delish!!!

This was awesome! I added a bay leaf, thyme, and brown sugar like some of the suggestions said. And cooked it for 30- 40 minutes. I was nervous at first thinking it was going to be too saucy, but it turned out perfect!

This was delicious but I followed recommendations by others.  I used fresh mushrooms, added beef flavoring, thyme and bay leaf.  I cut the recipe in half because there are just two of us but I wish I would not have cut the sauce in half.  It was soooo gooood.  Served over mashed potatoes but I think noodles or rice would also be good.

This dish is delicious and so easy to make. I have made it twice. The first time I only had a little port wine and used that and the second time I had no wine but added beef broth instead. The wine adds a lot of flavor and was much better than just the broth. I also sauteed onions with the meat. My husband loved it. We had leftovers and the next day I added a can of diced tomatoes which gave it a whole new taste. I love that it is so easy. Great recipe.

It was really good. Only thing was there is no onion in the recipe and this may just be me, but onion is really good in something like this. I added 1/2 an onion. Otherwise, PERFECT!!!!

The sauce was great (I did use fresh mushrooms and eliminated the tomato sauce for dietary reasons), but I didn't find 30 minutes to be enough simmering time for this cut of beef. I don't cook with sirloin tips often, so I was looking for a quickish (less than a few hours) recipe that would serve up some nice beef. Even the kids liked this, but the meat itself was lacking.

yummy, I made this in my pressure cooker and it came out wonderfully.  I did omit the salt because the canned mushrooms have enough salt for my family.  Great recipe I will make this again!!

Wow!  This was good.  Our house smelled heavenly as it cooked.  We like to have plenty of sauce for noodles, so I actually doubled the tomato sauce and wine. It was an outstanding dish!

Give this TWO THUMBS way up.  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I omitted the red wine (didn't have any) and the salt and added 2 Tsp of China Lily soy sauce, 2 cans sliced mushrooms (no juice), 2-lb cubed beef (I love my red meat), 2 Tsp McCormicks Smokehouse Ground Black Pepper, 4 sliced celery stalks and 1 Green Pepper (mainly just because it was in the fridge and needed to be used).  Last ingredient I added was 1 x 10oz can of Campbell's Tomato with Basil and Oregano soup.  Wife says it's an instant family hit and to keep it handy as we'll be making it lots.  Bon apetit.

This was delicious!  I did add the thyme, bay leaf, and brown sugar suggested by another reviewer, and used sherry instead of the red wine because it was all I had on hand.  We at this over mashed potatoes with some steamed broccoli on the side - tasty and easy!

We followed all of the recommended additions. Our only change above they previously mentioned: we didin't have tomato sauce, so I used a 1/2 can of paste and 1/2 can of diced.  I also did add in some flour to thicken.  I'll add more flour next time, as it was still thin.  This recipe with changes is fantastic.

The sauce in the recipe is soooo good!  Yum!  The only reason, I gave it 4 stars only because I over cooked the meat.  So that's chef's error... I would try this again...

Really yummy. I followed the recipe with only slight variations..I cut the meat into small pieces/slices instead of cubing it and marinated it for about 4 hours in olive oil & vinegar. I added a little splash of worcestershire sauce and a tiny bit of sugar as it was  simmering, and used tomato paste & water instead of the tomato sauce. Oh, and I had accidentally picked up thin-sliced chuck steaks instead of sirloin and it turned out just fine. LOVED IT!!

Had good flavor. I used marsala wine in place of the red and served over egg noodles. the sirloin was tough so next time i may try using the crock pot so it cooks longer and maybe that would help make the meat tender.

Easy to make, but couldn't help but follow the tips of others.  I lightly dusted the meat in seasoned flour before browning.  I added some finely diced onion as well.  I cooked this in the crock pot for about 4.5 hours.  I also added an additional 8oz can of tomato sauce.  The gravy was a little thin so I made a simply butter based roux and added that to it.  Thickened it up quite nicely.  This is one that I will surely make again.

My boyfriend works 12 hour days, and when he got home tonight, he was so psyched that this was on the table! We both agree that we will make this over and over again.  I simmered everything for another 30 minutes so that the sauce reduced and thickened to perfection, and served with mashed potatoes.

I'm giving this four stars because it really needs more than a half hour of simmering to make it tender. The flavor was great, but I had to add water and more wine to make it more saucy. All the sauce had cooked away by the end of the half hour! Next time I think I will make this in the crockpot. I bet it would be delicious that way!

4 stars as the recipe shows.  I followed the advise of others, which brought it up to 5 stars.  I added some worchestershire, some beef bullion and Italian seasoning.  Then simmered an additional half hour to make it more tender.  I didn't have enough gravy for serving over rice, so I added a jar of beef gravy that I had in the cupboard.  It was amazingly fantastic!

I love this recipe. Made it a few times. Hubby loves it. Sometimes I add chopped onions to it or more tomato sauce or other things. But it's not necessary it turns out great if you just make it as is. Makes great lunch leftovers.

The sirolin was a little tough.  Would've preferred a more tender cut of meat.  We used 3-cheese pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce. We served over whole wheat noodles & could not taste the "grain", as the sauce was outstanding.

This was delicious!  My husband had me save the sauce to put on mashed potatoes.  I made a few changes.  I used meat tenderizer on the tips, because the first time I made this they were kind of tough.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  Will definitely make over and over.

Absolutely fantabulous! I did the basic recipe, with some of the suggestions like like some beef broth, fresh mushrooms and diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce.  I basically cooked to taste and I found that adding brown sugar was a must and a perfect add!!! 

Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I'm giving this five stars for taste and easiness. However, mine turned out way to thin. I used cooking sherry, omitted the salt,and 1/2 tbsp brown sugar. Next time I will use 8 oz. fresh mushrooms, no water, and tomato paste and put all in the crock pot.  I served with potatoes, can't really imagine it with noodles.  Would be great also with a loaf of French bread to soak up the extra sauce.

I used one can of mushrooms and a handful of rehydrated mushrooms, two cubes of garlic, one small sliced onion and one small tomato chunked.  I also used Red Truck red wine for the wine.  I also used beef chuck tender steak instead of sirloin.

This is a great basic recipe that will take all sorts of modifications and still come out delicious. I pretty much went with the basic ingredient list but added three beef bouillon cubes, tomato paste, and lots of paprika. Definitely a keeper.

Really good and quick.  I did step 1 and then dumped it in my slow cooker.  Great way to use a cheap cut of meat as it ended up tender and tasty.

We liked this recipe but I modified it, adding some butter to the olive oil,using 1 can of V8 juice and little tomatoe soup, little wine. I added 4 bay leaves and some thyme. 40 minutes in medium and it was tender. Serve over Valencia rice. UUMMM!

I loved this. I kinda changed it a little though. I used fresh mushrooms and no red wine because I didn't have any. I let it simmer for a long time (about an hour) and the meat was soooo tender. Delicious!! A great started recipe. I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

I cut the wine back to 1/2c and added 1/4c beef broth, 1 tsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp oregano and a bay leaf. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I served it over mashed redskin potatoes....yummy!

This was really good although, my husband and I agreed that it would taste better served with new potatoes than over pasta. That's just a personal choice though.

This was really good.  Used fresh mushrooms and a full cup of wine.  At the end I added 1/4 stick of butter to finish the sauce.  Yummy!

Deliciousness on a plate.  Used pasilla chili powder instead of plain chili powder because I like it better.  Used 8 oz baby portobellos raw, putting them in with the tomato sauce as directed.  Cooked it all only about 25 mins. as we got hungry smelling the terrific odors.  Reminds Barbara of Cheviot sauce.  Served it over No-Yolk wide noodles.  Yummers!

Excellent! My additions:1 chopped onion, sauteed with the garlic, 1 can chopped tomatoes (instead of tomato sauce), 1t. beef broth paste, sherry for the wine. Bay leaf too.
I salt and pepper floured the meat before browning and realized that the onion and garlic don't need nearly as much browning time as the meat. Tend to burn! After the 40 minutes, or so, simmering time, everything came together in a delicious blend of flavors and texture. Great with buttered noodles!

We loved this recipe and so easy to make. Like others though, I sauteed onions and garlic together, then added the floured meat pieces and mushrooms... the smell in the house was amazing. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and served over brown rice... very yummy but next time it's got to be over mashed potatoes. My husband loved it to.
Thanks for a wonderful, fast, easy recipe.

Very good. Made some changes. I cut up the sirloin, put salt/pepper, then added to the pan. After browning, I removed the meat juices, cleaned the pan, then sauteed garlic/onion/fresh mushrooms. I then added the meat, I only had plum tomaotes and white wine, but its all good. I added fresh basil and a little oregano. I put this on a low flame for 1 hour and served with rice. Tatsy. Kids loved it

I added garlic and 2 tsp shallots to the meat while browning.  I used sauteed fresh mushrooms and made up for the extra liquid by adding 1/4 more wine and a little more tomato sauce to thicken up the sauce.   By using what was left of my trip tip roast, the beef was already tender it was tender in less than 20 minutes.

This was great!  I used some of MOLNARJL's tips.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add more water.  My mixture was a little too reduced and started to taste scorched.  I made it with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband said he wants it with rice next time.  Was a big hit, and soooo tender.

This really helped to tenderize a 'not so tender' piece of steak. It would def. be good with noodles. I didn't change a thing with the recipe, except that cooking time, maybe because of the cut of steak I used, was def. longer than 30 minutes. Will make again.

Very good. I used fresh mushrooms and dredged the steak in flour before browning. It was perfect, a nice change from a creamy sauce. Thanks!

This was pretty good...I used a red zinfandel in this recipe and it was a little bit strong, but I added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and it toned down the wine flavor.  My boyfriend really liked it and wants us to make it again soon!

This was good.. but didn't impress me all that much... Just something easy that you can throw all together for an easy dinner. I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so used a mixture of tomato paste and water instead.

Excellent recipe.  It was a hit at a dinner party, served with a simple salad and hot bread.  I used fresh mushrooms instead and stewed it a bit longer to thicken the sauce.

Excellent! The whole family liked this. I did add onion with garlic when browning the beef. I also used fresh mushrooms and sherry due to lack of wine. Served over egg noodles and with steamed string beans. This was quick and easy, a good week night meal.

Very good recipe - The meat melted in our mouths -Definately something different - Noodles were a must
