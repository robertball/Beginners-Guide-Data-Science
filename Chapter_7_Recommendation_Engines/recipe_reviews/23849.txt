Just some slight modifications to a dish I've made about 100 times (my family is Hungarian).  I use probably 3x the paprika (no idea how much, I just keep dumping - it's nearly impossible to use too much) - make sure it's good Hungarian paprika (Szeged is common on most grocery shelves).  Instead of pepper flakes, I add some hot paprika (again, Szeged) but you can add too much hot so use sparingly.  I sear the chicken on both sides before adding chicken broth (vs water.)  I also add some red bell pepper to the onion in the beginning and add the paprika part way through the sauteeing because this helps bring out the paprika flavor as well.   I don't use garlic or bacon grease - just olive oil.  Someone else posted their recipe for spaetzle and said to cook for 20 minutes.  This will turn the spaetzle to mush.  Spaetzle should be taken out of the simmering water with a slotted spoon once it rises to the surface as spaetzle/dumplings need to have some firmness to them.

I made this last night for dinner with only a couple modifications. 
 I used 4 boneless skinless breasts. (Next time I'll use them with skin on - gives it more flavor) 
 Instead of water, I used 3 cans of chicken broth.
 I added 1 bay leaf, ginger powder and garlic powder.
 I completely omitted the tomatoes and when it came time to use the juice, I used one ladle of the soup to dissolve flour and mix w/ sour cream.
Although you can't have paprikash without spaetzel (egg dumpling)! Since there's no spaetzel recipe on this site, I'll post mine. 
Get a pot of salted water at a HIGH boil. 
Mix 1-1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. milk, 3 eggs. Drop spoonfuls into the boiling water and cook for 20 minutes, uncovered. Add to the paprikash. Yum!

As an expat living in Hungary for the past 3 years I can say that this is AUTHENTIC!  Delicious!  Make sure you  make this with Hungarian paprika as the paprika in North America is nowhere near as good or strong.

This is an excellent Chicken Paprikash recipe.  Very tasty.  I browned the chicken in the bacon drippings first to crisp the skin, then removed it and added the onions, garlic, etc.  Very tasty, with depth of flavor.  I will definitely make this again, and again.

This is a very good recipe, very tasty! The only thing i did differently is use boneless skinless chicken breast and cut them into cubes. I also substituted the water for chicken broth and added a little cayenne pepper. By using the bonless breast it only took about 30 mins to make, very quick and easy. I served it over white rice, even my picky eater 5 yr old loved it! Will definatly make again!

Great recipe. I brown the chicken first, though. It renders some of the fat out of the skin, adds flavor, and improves the texture.  Also, red pepper flakes can vary greatly in heat, so a teaspoon might make your dish way too hot. I'd start out with a 1/4 tsp or less. You can always add more. It came out very well for me, but I couldn't figure out why it seemed to lack the unique and very delicious flavor of the paprikash a Hungarian friend used to make for me. Eventually, I found out it was CARAWAY that provided that taste  - about a 1/2 tspn of seed, lightly toasted in a dry pan and gently bruised.  Just what it needed,

My husband loved the creamy flavor of this.  But the funny thing is, he hates sour cream.  So of course, when he was raving about the flavor, I just smiled and said "thanks honey".

I saw this recipe and couldn't wait to try it. I know there were other recipes here for the same dish, but the ingredients here were more to my liking.  I have never had chicken paprikash before, but after this I can promise you I will have it again.  This was AWESOME!

Out of this world!! The chicken just fell off the bone and what a sauce. My daughter even raved. She's a very fussy teen too. I didn't change the recipe but I did leave a piece of the bacon in the whole cooking time for added bacon flavor. Also gave it a little more salt at the end, but that's it. Gona save this one for sure. Thanks, Gail.

Pretty good and quite simple too. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces. Also, I cut out the bacon grease and just used olive oil... add chicken stock in place of the water any time you can, it greatly enhances the flavor of the dish. Other than those minor details, I followed this one to the letter. DO NOT skimp on the crushed red pepper... I used a good, healthy teaspoon full. The meal would have been terribly bland without it. We had this served over egg noodles, but rice would've worked well too. I will definitely be making this again!

This is an old family favorite! My family is Hungarian so I grew up eating this wonderful stew. My husband had never heard of it before meeting me, now he LOVES it! I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and skinless drumsticks. I also add a bit more flour and sour cream because I like the sauce to be creamier and thicker. I love mushrooms, so I usually add a small can with the tomatoes. Instead of making dumplings (which is the traditional way to serve this dish), I use wide egg noodles. The house smells so good while it's cooking and I can't wait to eat the leftovers the next day! LOVE IT!!!

Really good....I did not have bacon grease so I used olive oil.  I also added quite a bit more paprika...loved it.  I put it over a cut up baked potato instead of dumplings because I did not have any flour to make dumplings.

Excellent....fantastic.  I followed recipe exactly except used olive oil instead of bacon grease.  It was so good (especially the sauce) it led to a very intimate romantic evening with my wife. Her way of saying job well done.  Needless to say I will be cooking this again and again

This recipe is great! I've made it 6 or 8 times now, and wow, what a great sauce. EXCEPT, I change it up quite a bit: I add 2 chopped red bell peppers, 1/2 tsp black pepper, substitute sherry for water (a Hungarian aunt of mine insists on using sherry or wine- this part is key), omit flour, use chicken breasts, sub olive oil for bacon fat, double the garlic, and serve with egg noodles. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Yum! Simple and delicious. I used 2 cups of cooked, shredded/diced chicken and cut down the simmer time. The second time I made this, I added 2 large sliced carrots. My husband and daughter ate it both times with egg noodles and hardly talked until they were scraping the gravy out of the bottom of the bowl.

This instantly became one of my favorites.  It reminds me of the meals my grandmother use to make.  It is wonderful served over egg noodles.  It also works great using boneless chicken.

We enjoyed this so much.  I used the flour to coat the chicken and seared it in bacon drippings.  I used boneless thighs because that is what I had on hand.  It was delicious.  Definitely worth making,and I know this will be something we enjoy even more in cooler weather! We served it over yellow rice.

I have made this dish several times and really enjoy it.  The few changes I made....canola oil for the bacon grease and chicken stock instead of water.  Also, I've generally found that it cooks in 1/2 the time that the recipe says.

This was fantastic!  I'd never had anything Hungarian before though I have heard through a Hungarian friend of mine that there are many dishes that are delicious and unique.  Chicken Papkrikash was one of the dishes she'd mentioned.  So when I came across this recipe, I was utterly delighted.   It was every bit as good as she had stated.  I loved the thick tomato, sour cream and paprika flavor.  So rich and creamy!  And I absolutely loved the zing that the red pepper gave it.  Soo good!  I followed some of the directions the other reviewers gave and added chicken broth instead of water which I think gave it extra flavor then it would have had I used just water.  I also poured it over egg noodles.  Yummy!! :)  The only reason I'm giving this just four stars and not five is because my five year old thought it was a bit too spicy, (he doesn't even like pepper though) and my 2 year old took one bit and instantly stuck up her nose at it saying 'I no like it mommy...' (Sigh...she's soo picky -_-') Oh well, there loss hehe ;).  Too bad for them, I'm definately adding this recipe to my list of keepers!  Thanks so much!

I make this slightly different now, but this is close to what i do. I also add wine, no bacon grease, chicken stock no water. I cannot find hungarian paprika, so the red flakes really help. my friend in europe mixes sweet and regular and he says it's stellar. i use whole legs (so cheap) that i crack in half when i get home. I leave the skin on bones in- it doesn't take that long and you cannot beat the flavor. Then we remove the bones and skin afterwards. I also make speatzle to go on the side, but desperately need  a spaetzle maker because it gets very messy. I also add 1 cubanelle pepper at the onion stage, and i forgot the garlic the first time i made it (how i don't know - i put it in EVERYTHING) so i leave it out of this dish. We love it so much i don't mess around!

Being Hungarian means I get to cook and eat great food...this is the real deal folks!  The dumplings could be a little daunting but our go to recipe has always been one egg per serving beaten and 1/4 cup flour for every egg used...so 4 eggs + 1 cup flour for 4 servings.  Just drop as big or little spoonful as desired into boiling pot of water and when they all rise up to the surface give it an extra minute to cook and they are done! Enjoy! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I did make a couple of revisions....used chicken breasts cut into pieces instead of a whole chicken, chicken stock in place of water, and crushed tomatoes rather than diced.  The crushed tomatoes thicken the sauce nicely, and the flour is not needed.  This one's a keeper for me!  EDIT:  also forgot to add that I used 1 1/2 TBS sweet Hungarian paprika and 1 1/2 TBS smoked Spanish paprika.  The smoked paprika adds a wonderful flavor!

Hubby said it was missing something.  Maybe because I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  May have been more flavorful...

Really good recipe.  I made it according to directions except that I used 3 lbs of chicken thighs.  The sour cream really toned down the spiciness of the paprika/red pepper flakes.  This will be a repeat recipe at my house.

This is truly authentic! It's one of my favourite dishes that my Hungarian grandparents would make when I was little. I added a bay leaf near the end of the simmering phase; next time I'll add it at the beginning. Some sliced and sautéed mushrooms would definitely add more taste and depth to this dish. I usually serve it over homemade Hungarian dumplings called galushka, which is very similar to spaetzel otherwise over some store-bought egg noodles. Thank for bringing back the memories!

This recipe is very delicious and authentic tasting.  I sauteed the chicken first, removed it from the pan then sauteed the onion and returned the chicken to cook.  I substituted chicken broth for the water. I made extra and brought it to my neice who just had a baby, she loved it!!  A co-worker smelled the leftovers at work and begged for the recipe. This is a keeper!!!!!

Real Paprikash doesn't have tomatoes in it. We only use chicken, skin on, bone in, a lot of onions, salt pepper real Hungarian paprika a little garlic and real sour cream. You can mix the flout into the sour cream to thicken the gravy. No need for chicken broth you're using the whole chicken.

Authentic recipe.  I use olive oil or crisco instead of bacon grease and I use thighs and legs(the meat is tastier). I season the chicken generously with salt, black pepper and a little garlic powder before I brown it and then season with lots more paprika than called for and red  pepper flakes to taste before I add the water.  I never use the tomatoes just some water and flour and the sour cream and serve over spaetzle!  Just like my Hunky grandma used to make!

This was so yummy and my family loved it including young children.  I swapped out the red pepper flakes for 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and think this would be better with skinless chicken, either thighs or breasts.  Next time I make it I'll dice the chicken first and make it more like a stew than chicken with a sauce.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. 
For some reason it tasted to us like there was a flavor missing...not sure what. I made as directed, except that I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper and worcestershire sauce and a couple bay leaves while it was simmering. We ate this with long grain wild rice and a side of broccoli. Will be making again!

This was a very tasty dish.  I used chicken thighs but removed the skin.  I think next time I might try using chicken broth in place of water for a little added flavor.  Served with green salad, rice and warm bread.

I also used olive oil instead of bacon grease, doubled the paprika (which was smoked), and replaced diced tomatoes with a small can of tomato sauce. Just didn't have any diced tomatoes on hand. It turned out wonderful. A recipe that reminds in both taste and smell of what my mom used to make fifty years ago. Thank you.

I have never made or had Chicken Paprikash before, so maybe I just don't care for paprika too much.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 4 cubed chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken. I always have my husband rate new dishes on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best, and he gave this between a 2 and a 3.  Nothing stellar.  There is an Indian dish with similar ingredients, Chicken Makhani, that my husband gives a 5.  It uses several different spices and has no paprika, and it has tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, yogurt instead of sour cream, but its a stewed chicken dish much like this.  If we had never had the Chicken Makhani, we might have rated this one higher.

This was delicious.  Just the right amount of spice.  We used boneless skinless chicken breast halves which we cut into strips about 2" wide.  We reduced the cooking time down to 25 minutes.  We used chicken broth instead of the water and olive oil instead of the bacon grease.  We served it with homemade spaetzel (the recipe in the most helpful comments listed).  I will definitely make this again!

I found this to be way too spicy with not enough paprika taste.  No matter how much doctoring I did, I could not get the heat from the crushed pepper flakes less noticeable.  I think I will stick with my original recipe I've used for years.  Sorry.

Made exactly as written.  I can't put my finger on it.  It didn't taste bad.  It just wasn't what we were expecting.  Maybe I will try it again and FRY the chicken first to get a crispy coating and THEN continue the rest of the recipe.  Chicken was just not quite right...

I've made this many times now and my family and I love it. I usually change something in every recipe I try, and I thought the kids might not this recipe at first, but I don't think this one needs any tweeking, and the kids gobble it up every time.

yum yum.  One of the best recipes I've tried on this site. I used bone-in (but skinless) breasts, thighs and legs, which made it easy and low fat but also very flavorful.

I seared the chicken in olive oil(no bacon grease), pureed the diced tomatoes, used extra Paprika as recommended. I even hunted down some Szeged Hungarian Paprika because I had to taste the difference and it definitely has a better flavor.  This recipe was excellent!

I used olive oil instead of bacon grease, added in a chopped red pepper, used about a tbsp of red pepper flakes and 3tbsp of regular paprika, and 4tbsp of smoked (I couldn't find the real hungarian paprika in the area), and I used chicken broth in place of water. I also used this recipe for the dumplings http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/hungariannoodlesdumplings/r/nokedli.htm

Turned out really good.

In an effort to use up what I have in the freezer I used boneless chicken breasts (I know! I know! My sister lived in Hungary and would very much disapprove) and I used chicken stock in place of water to add some more flavor. I let it simmer for almost an hour and served it with Kaese Speatzel. Very Good!

PHENOMINAL!  Never had or made this dish before.  Had to make a Hungarian dish for a Geography Fair.  So easy to make, and So VERY yummy!  I used Hungarian Paprika...and it's true....the more you use...the better  it tastes.  I did use cubed chicken breast, only because this was for a buffet dinner with 75 people.  It was very good, but I'm sure using bone in chicken will be even better.

This is pretty close to my family's Hungarian recipe, so stars for that!  I just have to comment on the folks who have to change up the recipe so much by adding ingredients that don't belong.  I completely understand more or less of something to suit taste, but when you add things like say bay leaf, then it's no longer chicken paprika (spell it like it is, not phonetically).  If you don't like it, then fine, move on, it's not for you.  But, this doesn't make it a bad recipe.  Let's be real folks.

I had never had chicken paprikash before and was not disappointed with this recipe.  It's really good.  I followed the advice of some other reviews and substituted olive oil for the bacon grease, added 1 chopped red bell pepper (sauteed with the onion and garlic), used chicken breasts diced into cubes, substituted a cup chicken broth instead of water and omitted the tomatoes.  I also sprinkled just a little bit of cayenne in, and used a Hungarian paprika (brought back from Hungary by friends) that I think is Édesnemes (a noble sweet paprika).
Served over spätzle, it was delicious.  I can't wait to make it again!

This is yummy with the addition of bacon grease. But, we saute the chicken in shortening (I added the bacon grease for flavor.) We saute the chicken in the onion then add chicken stock and simmer.

Delicious! I chopped up two red bell peppers and sauteed them with the onions as well. I used bonless/skinless thigh meat and it was moist and very flavorfull. I have a feeling breast meat might become too dry. I also used chicken stock instead of water. Keep the liquid to a minimum (I got a bit carried away) if you don't want a runny sauce. Will make over and over again. So easy and yummy.

Very good recipe.  I used chicken stock instead of the water.  If you like it spicy, use the 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper.  I used just a couple shakes and could still taste the heat.  I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders.  Loved it!!

A really good recipe! I'm almost full-blooded Hungarian so I'm always wanting to eat anything that is of that origin. I loved the paprika in this dish and I actually added an additional tablespoon. I also used chicken broth instead of water, added 2 bay leaves to the mixture and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Next time I will make it with bone-in-skin-off chicken breasts and see if that deepens the flavor a bit. Good stuff!

You must try this! Very tasty, very simple. My changes were more technique than substance. I (like others) cut back on the pepper flakes (1/4 tsp) and Paprika (3 tsp) not knowing the strength of either.  I will surely invest in some good paprika and bump up the flakes. I added the toasted caraway suggested earlier, definitely a good thing; also did not drain the petite cut tomatoes. When the chicken was done, I removed it and put a pound of green beans in the sauce while the rice cooked.  Removed the beans when done.  I thicken sauces a little differently, brought sauce to a boil and added (good quality) potato flakes.  Took the sauce off heat and blended sour cream. Very yummmmm!

This dish was delicious and easy! The only thing I adjusted, was the crushed red pepper, which I only added about 1/2 tsp, since I was serving it to my kids.  I just bought drumsticks and thighs, and the meat was falling off the bones.  I served it with one of the reviewer's spaetzel recipe.  I can hardly wait to eat leftovers today!

Excellent. My bottle of paprika was empty- nasty surprise that was- and it was too late to get any from the store. However, it was wonderful without it. The kids devoured it, and maybe they wouldn't of if it had any color than white.  Thank you for sharing this.

Really great version of the original. I doubled the garlic, sour cream, and red pepper to add more flavor. I also used chicken breast and cut them into strips which reduced the cook time in 1/2! Will use again.

I was looking for a recipe that comes close to an authentic paprikash I had as a kid... sadly, this is not it.  It is a very good dish, and I will make it again (without the red pepper... it was too spicy!), it just wastn't what I was looking for.

This dice turned out WONDERFUL even without the authentic Hungarian Paprika!  I can't wait to try it with the real spices.  We served it over white rice and had enough left overs for lunch the next day.  I will definately make this one again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very delicious!  Too bad I made it on a fairly warm day...the spices made everyone sweat!  I used skinned chicken pieces to lower the fat content a little and it worked out fine.

Easy and tasty.  I used a vegetarian soy "chicken" product instead of chicken, which cuts way down on cooking time.  I also added about 6 sliced, fresh mushrooms to the garlic/onion/paprika mixture.  I served it over buttered and peppered wide egg noodles.  It was nice with a green vegetable and a glass of red wine.

Very close to my Hungarian Father in laws family recipe.  As another reviewer stated use more Paprika, and ONLY use Hungarian Paprika, it has more/better flavor.  Use sweet and hot (instead of red pepper) and add it partway through sauteing the onions to bring out the flavor even more.  And the one thing I can't stress enough is use bone-in chicken with the skin.  It improves the flavor tenfold.  You can always remove the skin and take it off the bone before serving.   I made it once with boneless skinless breasts, blech.

We really, really enjoyed this! I had to make a few changes which I consider minor - used olive oil instead of bacon grease, 2 T. sweet paprika, 1/2 tsp Spanish smoked paprika, chicken broth instead of water, full fat yogurt instead of sour cream. The smell in the house is still wonderful, Husband and (grown) son loved it - daughter (grown) wouldn't come to try it - her loss! I did saute the chicken pieces with the onion mix before adding the broth - I don't know if this made any difference in the flavor. I will definitely make this again - a recipe so easy and so delicious cannot be lost!

My Hungarian family makes this a little differently, for those who'd like to try:
- Use cooking oil instead of bacon grease
- Omit garlic, crushed red pepper & tomatoes (my grandma would be rolling in her grave!)
- Increase paprika to at least 4 tablespoons
Saute that chicken in onion & paprika mixture over low heat for at least 20-30 mins so that paprika really seeps into the chicken.  THEN add water. 
- Add at least one more cup of water so chicken is completely covered while bubbling away 
- Add 4 seeded & quartered green peppers into water covering chicken (trust me) 
- Add 2-3 bay leaves 
- Add at least 4 tablespoons dried basil (yes, really) 
- Add sour cream if sauce too thin. Should be about as thick as syrup.
Result:  a very pure flavor of chicken & paprika with hints of basil & bay leaf.  This dish takes lots of tweaking to master, so don't give up!  Enjoy!!

I tried this recipe and it makes a lot - enough for another dinner. Instead of cutting up a whole chicken, I used what I had - boneless, skinless chicken thighs. It didn't need such long cooking. The sauce was delicious, but in my opinion needed some help with herbs. I added dill and lovage. That's what I like about cooking, adapting recipes to wherever your tastes bring you.  This made a very good chicken paprikash.

This is delicious! Like some other readers, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into cubes and substituted chicken broth for the water.  I served over linguine, which was what I had in the cupboard. Great comfort food dish on a cold night!

I had never tasted this recipe before and I found it to be delicious.  The only thing I did  different was to add chicken broth instead of the water in the recipe.  It was very easy to make and we will have this again.

I didn't have time to cook the chicken for an hour, so I just cut the cooking time down by a bit. It still came out great! I served it with pasta tossed with a bit of olive oil and dill.

Fantastic. We are picky eaters and we LOVED it! I was trying to match a recipe to ingredients I had at home so I tried it on a whim based on that alone. Wonderfully surprising!

OMG!  This is a family favorite now.  I did not change much just the chicken broth for water and a little cayenne pepper to give it a little more spicy flavor.  Everybody raved about it!

This is a keeper I love it cant wait to make it again!

I did substitute mushrooms for the tomatoes and served over homemade egg noodles.  It was a hit and will be making again.  Can't stress enough how much difference hungarian paparika makes.  The color and flavor were fantastic.

I used chicken thighs and brown them first then sauted the onion.  I also added some extra salt.  It tasted much better the next day.

I grew up with my hungarian mom's more "traditional" paprikash (which had no tomatoes, and i believe even more paprika), but for my non-hungarian boyfriend i tried this recipe first... he LOVES it, and so do i.   We've made this several times, and because he prefers dark meat, we've adapted it to include only leg quarters. Also, i use 1 cup chicken broth in place of the water, and a bit more garlic, and use 1/4 tsp black pepper in place of the red pepper (we're both sissies when it comes to spicy food).

I've made this recipe (per my notes below) a dozen times since writing the earlier review in 2009. Last night, I took a little different approach and achieved the best results ever. I used bone-in chicken thighs (removed skin); salted & browned them; removed from the pan and added onion & a diced yellow bell pepper; when those were translucent, added the garlic for just a minute and pulled the pot off the burner and added a combo of Hungarian half-sharp and smoked Spanish paprika (to avoid burning the paprika). I then added 1 peeled, diced roma tomato before putting in chicken broth (which I still use in place of water), placing the chicken back in, and I popped the pot into a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. I finished the dish on the stove for a couple minutes after adding the sour cream (used cornstarch mixed into the sour cream instead of flour because I'm eating gluten free these days). I think reducing the amount of tomato really let the paprika shine through better. The addition of smoked paprika added a very nice layer of flavor. I'll be making it like this from now on!  I serve it with pappardelle pasta (Trader Joe's) or brown rice pasta; haven't yet tackled gluten free spaetzle. 
--------------------------------
This was a delicious recipe.  I followed it as written, the only departures being that I browned the chicken first and added the tomatoes about 1/2 way through the process.  As others have mentioned, bone-in chicken and Hungarian paprika are essential to achi

This is one of the best recipes I have ever used from this site.  I have made it several times and the only changes that I have made is to use olive oil instead of bacon grease, boneless chicken breasts, HUNGARIAN paprika, and I sometimes add diced green peppers if I have them.  Sometimes I make spaetzle but if I'm feeling lazy I serve with rice or egg noodles.  Delicious, thank you.

You need to have Hungarian Paprika.  I just ordered some online.  Without Hungarian Paprika you may as well not make it.

I made this recipe yesterday, I found it quick, easy and delicious!

I used fire roasted diced tomatoes (Muir Glen)  and an 8 oz container of sour cream. I also bought some good quality Hungarian paprika.   I had boneless chicken breasts so I used them instead of the whole chicken. 

I added a bit of garlic powder during the cooking time and a little more salt and pepper and served it over brown rice. I garnished the dish with finely chopped fresh parsely.

Wonderful recipe!

The husband and son LOVED it!

Sooooooo gooooooood. I've made this several times and each time I want to lick my plate clean. I can't believe how good this recipe is! I've made some changes based on other reviewer comments and I think I'm sticking with this from now on: olive oil instead of bacon grease, fresh Hungarian paprika instead of domestic stuff, I used 1&1/2 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken breast strips instead of other chicken cuts (this reduced the simmering time from 60 minutes to about 25 minutes), 1&1/2 chicken broth instead of water, and reduced fat sour cream instead of regular. I love this over brown rice and it's truly one of my favorite foods. Many, MANY thanks to Gail!

This is delicious and SOOOOOOOOO easy.  I made it 2x in one weekend!  Once for us and once for a sick friend.  YUM-O from everyone!  I cooked 3 slices of bacon chopped up with some chopped onion to get the whole thing started. I used smoked paprika because our store had no hungarian paprika (bummer!) but it was still delicious.  I followed the recipe from there using boneless, skinless breasts and 1 can of chicken broth in place of the water to cover.  Served it over egg noodles.  YUM!!  Like I said, this was VERY easy and so simple.  Good enough to put into the weeknight rotation!  Thanks!!

My family is Hungarian and has made paprikash for as long as I can remember. Also, for as long as I can remember, I never liked it. It always came off as bland. The last time my mother made it- she added some dashes of cayenne pepper to kick it up. It was much better after that and had much more flavor.

Thought I had chicken cutlets in the freezer, however, only found ground turkey. Decided to give it a try and it came out great minus the tomatoes and the addition of red bell peppers. Used chicken stock in lieu of water. The sauce was so delicious!

Very good-what a nice change for chicken.  Moderately spicy - I don't normally like chicken with tomatoes but this had a good flavor.

This recipe is the best one I've tried for chicken paprika.  The only change I made was to add 1 cup of chicken stock (or add a bit of bullion cube to the water) instead of plain water, and to add a diced red pepper when cooking the onion.... It's delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was basically the same as I've have in Hungary. I did use a premium grade Hungarian paprika (purchased bulk)  and I do think it makes a difference. I think it did need a bit more salt than called for so I added. I had lots of extra sauce that I plan to freeze and use for future meals. Add green peppers if you like- would be common in Hungary.

Dee-licious.  Did as another reviewer suggested and went crazy with the paprika (not measuring exactly/just dumping) and it only made it better.  Thank you for this recipe and please keep em coming.

I love this meal and use thighs in this recipe. I add a lot more paprika than the recipe, probably 4x more otherwise tastes too bland. I also add bay leaves, parsley and use corn starch for thickening. Enjoy.

Made this for my Hungarian Father and he Loved it!  He said it tasted like his mother's cooking!  I used a whole chicken,  cut up into sections then cooked in large pan with  4 strips of bacon until the skin fell off easily. Then removed from pan and cut chicken into pieces.  Used the juice in the pan to saute garlic and onions. Added chicken stock in place of water.  Used double the paprika too. 

To make dumplings:  4 eggs, 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt, 1\2 teaspoon salt  and 1 1\2 cups all purpose flour. Each dumpling is half a teaspoon dumped into simmering water. Once they all rise to the top, simmer for 10 minutes then scoop out.

Really really good. I'm not Hungarian, nor have I ever been to Hungary so I can't judge it's authenticity, but my wife and I and our guest ate it down with gusto. I seldom buy canned tomatoes, I used one large fresh one and mixed tomato paste with water for the slurry.

Turned out delicious.  I used a mix of 3tbsp paprika paste and 3tsp paprika powder.  Spicy but yummy.  No bacon grease just olive oil. No stock just water.  Simple easy and Super satisfying. Served it with gnocchi- recipe by Anna.

Love it!  I've made this dish a few times and turns out great every time. The only changes I make are, I use chicken breasts, but still use the bacon grease because it gives it that extra flavor, substitute chicken broth for water, add extra Paprika and it always comes out fabulous!   My husband loves it when I make this dish for our Saturday night date night!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy to prepare and very tasty over noodles.  This is the first time I have seen crushed red pepper flakes in this dish and I must say it added a nice zip without too much heat.

I made some health conscious substitutions. I used 2 lb of chicken breasts, but water is the ENEMY. It's makes chicken bland and dry. Using  a non-stick skillet at medium heat, I used only one tbs of bacon grease to brown onions and garlic. Mixed the dry seasonings together and seasoned the chicken. Browned one side of the chicken in the pan for EXACTLY 1 minute, sprinkling what seasoning fell off all in the pan.  Flip the chicken, cover and reduce to low for 10 minutes. EXACTLY. Remove the pan from heat (DO NOT OPEN IT) and let rest in there for 10 minutes. I promise its done, do not check. During that 10 minutes make your spaetzle, egg noodles, or whatever. Original method here:  (http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-moist-tender-chicken-breasts-every-time-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-36891) Remove the chicken to make the sauce and add it back later.  There will be more than enough chicken juice for the sauce left in the pan. For the sauce I used 0% fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It worked!! Turn the heat very low when adding it in and let it cook low and slow or risk curdling. A higher fat content (2%) will also help.

I've never had authentic chicken paprikash so I don't know if this is just how it's supposed to taste.  Not bad but not sure it'll become a regular in our dinner rotation.

Very good!  I omitted the hot pepper Flakes since I used the Hungarian paprika, I sprinkled that on the chicken tenders while they were browning.  I've only had this once before at a Hungarian event but it seems to me there were no hunts of tomatoes.  Served it over dried, cooked spatial that took about 13 minutes to cook.  Marilyn

Got back from Budapest loving the Hungarian food.  Looked for a recipe, tried this and loved it.  Could not master the dumplings as I am not much of a cook, tried frozen potato dumplings instead . Not as good as in Budapest but almost as good.

I've never had Chicken Paprikash before and this was amazing. Following the advice of a few reviewers I increased the Paprika to 5 tablespoons, which is a lot I know. I also doubled the red pepper flakes because I like spice and I added a chopped red bell pepper as well. I also used chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken because it's what I had on hand, it cooked in about 30 minutes. This is delicious. I will definitely make this again. Next time I think I won't add the spices until the onion is sautéed because it bound with the oil and didn't help the onion cook, and also prevented me from seeing when the onion was translucent.

This is amazing. I followed the recipe, also adding extra paprika, and 1 tsp of caraway, and chicken broth instead of water. I used bone-in thighs and a few drummies with the skin removed, browning them in some bacon drippings that I happened to have.

Great depth of flavor in the sauce.

This is the best recipe. I used real paprika I got in Budapest. It is the hot kind. All I had on hand for tomatoes was a can with garlic peppers and onion, "salsa style. " It turned out so tasty and delicious. Cutting up a whole chicken takes some work but it does result in better meat. I served it with rice but spaetzle would have been even better.

made to the recipe except used boneless chicken thighs and used a mixture of sweet Hungarian paprika and instead of red pepper flakes used spicy Hungarian paprika;  used heaping spoons instead of level spoons when measuring.   Hubby really happy.   Had to order both paprikas from Amazon, my grocery store only had Spanish paprika, and it does taste a lot different.   Wonderful aroma  when cooking.....  the neighbors were impressed!  LOL

I made this for my ailing Hungarian friend, he recovered quickly. I would like to think it was due to the bone broth and chicken bones in sed recipe. I substituted  crock pot slow cooking bone broth for water.  Not familiar with paprika so I blended smoked, organic and hot hungarian paprika with great results! Substituted thick large pasta for dumplings.  Will make again with left over turkey--love the creamy savory flavors.

Loved the paprikash, but the spaetzle recipe one person gave was wrong. It creates a soupy mix the texture of cream. Once I read other spaetzle recipes I added another cup of flour and wound up with a sticky loose dough that , still with some difficulty, I dropped into the water by teaspoonfuls. It made big, puffy lumps that tasted good, but were clumsy looking.

I've made this recipe a handful of times and it always turn out fantastic. but of course I changed a few things to make it even better. USE THE BACON GREASE. it makes everything better. Use bone in chicken as well, the flavor will be worth it. I start by browning the chicken skin on (season with salt pepper and paprika) on all sides, then removing the chicken from the pot after about 5 min each side. this helps seal in the moister. add the onion and brown that. I always add some small sliced portabella mushrooms as well when browning the onion, simply because I've never had a mushroom I didn't love.  return the chicken and cook as directed with all of the ingredients and simmer LOW LOW LOW and slow. I always add substantially more paprika and garlic. because I love paprika and garlic. also, use chiken broth and cut back on the salt. 

Now, after hour and a half, remove the chicken, set aside to cool a little, and remove the meat off of the bone, discard the bone and the skin (unless you like eating chicken skin) and return the meat to the broth. Don't shred the chicken, you still want some substantial pieces in the pot and most likely some will fall apart on their own. you don't want to have shredded chicken. let that simmer on low for about 20 mins so all of those fantastic flavors dance the sexy dance with the chicken, then add the sour cream mixture. warm the sour cream up a little too, don't put it in cold or it will curdle. pour that over you favorite carb (spatzle or du

Everyone liked them, even the ones who think you have to cook on a BBQ for it to "have flavor", to me smoke covers the flavor too much, but that's just me. I upped the cook temp to 320 due to time issues, and we're still fall off the bone good! Could have been a little sweater out of the oven, so I'm going to play with more brown sugar and maybe more marinating time!

Made this recipe last night and it was delicious!!  I couldn't find Hungarian paprika so used smoked paprika which gave it the most wonderful flavour. I also subbed chicken broth for water and thick plain yogurt for sour cream. My fiancé said it was one of the best things I've ever made and I must agree. Definitely a do-again....thank you for sharing the recipe!!

this was a very tasty dish.  i didn't cook a whole hour, maybe 45 mins.  the only issue i had, which i am sure is operator error, is i couldn't get the sour cream to mix in nicely.  it still tasted good, but nasty to look at. served over egg noodles. i probably used more paprika also.  thanks for the post SHAELYNUMBER10!

Great recipe!! After starting to add the sour cream, I think the amount the recipe calls for at the end may be too high. Luckily it's the last step so you can adjust to your tastes. I ended up only using about 4 tablespoons of sour cream.

This is so good. The only thing I did differently was first brown the chicken on both sides in the bacon fat.  Then I removed it from the skillet, and sauteed the onion and garlic. I served this recipe over noodles. Next time I'm going to try adding a little sherry.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I did take the advice of one of your readers and I browned the chicken parts first using olive oil.  Then I removed the chicken and sautéed some chopped red peppers and onion and garlic as well as the paprika. I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I will be making this often.

Substituted bacon grease for olive oil; Used chicken breast with skin and bone, but removed the skin before adding the final sauce. I added 3 chicken bouillion cubes to 2 cups of water. I probably could have used more paprika, but didn't want to overdo it. My husband loved the dish, but is not a fan of sour cream. He said the sour cream was a little too strong for his taste, so next time, I think I will add only half of a container of that. The dish was very tasty. For next time, I will also try using a slotted spoon to make the spaetzel, as a regular spoon produced pieces that were a little too big.

I just made this recipe and it's amazing! I'd only change one thing, I'd not add so much red pepper. I cut it down to 1/2 tsp. but that was till too much heat for me. Next time I'll go with 1/4 and this will be perfect for me. I think it overpowers the other flavors. Great recipe though!

It's not quite 4 but since there's no 3.5, I gave it 4. I guess I liked it enough but it's not quite what I expected. I had chicken paprikash last week at a local restaurant for the first time in my life and I quite liked it. It was creamy and the chicken was very tender as well. I didn't use the whole chicken but it was the sauce that I wasn't fantastically happy about. It was too sour...well more like tart...my hubby said. I thought it was the sour cream at first(I only had 16 oz tub so I tried to put "about" half of it in and I thought maybe it was actually a bit more than half and that made it sour. But I think it was the tomato. It was definitely not creamy like the one I had at the restaurant. Even though I liked it, I don't think I will be making it the same way again. I want to find a way to make it creamy and not as sour. Definitely I will not use tomato again of if I do, not as much.

I have made this recipe twice.  In the second rendition, I made it with authentic Hungarian spicy paprika. That addition pushed the recipe over the edge. :)  If you like spicy food, try it with spicy paprika.

This was very yummy, I used cut up chicken breasts and chicken broth instead of water as some others had suggested. Boyfriend had not ever had chicken paprikash but he really liked it and I will be making this again. I think I will do it with the chicken parts next time because I'm sure it would be even more flavorful that way. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was excellent. I loved the spice from the red pepper flakes. It added the perfect amount of heat. I served it over egg noodles tossed with butter, salt, and pepper. For the record, I used up some leftover shredded pork instead of the chicken, used olive oil instead of the bacon grease (didn't have it on hand), and finally, I skipped the flour since it didn't seem to need it. Looking forward to leftovers!

Love this recipe.  I've been using a variation of it I got from Epicurious (they do veal, I do beef), but this is pretty much bang on.  The only thing I'll do differently sometimes is use shallots in addition to onions.  Also, I make sure to use Hungarian sweet paprika, I use cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, I omit the water, I use about half the sour cream and I use a can of plain tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  I follow as directed, but once the onions are sauteed I'll pull them out and throw the beef in.  When I cook the beef, I will usually add some garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and regular paprika to season the beef.  We're having friends over this weekend and I'll be doing it again then.  Basically I'll be doubling the recipe for 5lbs of beef.  I guess my recipe isn't exactly the same, but it's close.  Maybe I'll post the one I use.  Anyhow, this looks delicious!

This is a great dish! Extremely tasty and very spicey. If you don't like it hot just use less red pepper. Other then that, wouldn't change a thing :) My husband found it here, now makes it at least once a month! Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This recipe was fantastic.  I've had this dish but never prepared it myself.  I also made the spaetzle recipe as I believe OhiomomI suggested and put it through a ricer into boiling water. I did substitute 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for part of the flour. Everyone loved this meal for sure!! :-)

Great tasting and very pretty to look at, but it seemed to make a lot more sauce than needed. If you're making it with dumplings, there's plenty of liquid to poach them in, rather than cooking them separately.

Very very good, made with the Spaetzle, and 12 boneless chicken legs, had it for 3 days. A good way to having to clean up once for three meals.

Absolutely amazing!  I made the spaetzle and wild rice.  It was better with the spaetzle.  Also used light sour cream to cut back on fat/calories.  Didn't miss any flavor!

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly using Hungarian paprika. I also made spaetzle (thanks Ohiomom) and strained it through a colander into boiling water. My family LOVES this. Thanks!

This was really good, altho the large chunks of chicken were a bit difficult with the spaetzle so I would recommend removing the chicken once cooked, shredding, then returning it to the pan before serving.  I followed ohiomom1's dumpling recipe, and really recommend it with this dish, as it's easy and compliments.  I changed minor ingredients based on what was in the cupboards, added a couple of bay leaves during the simmer, but for the most part followed the recipe.  Husband added a TON of red pepper to his dish, but I found the spice level adequate with the pepper flakes.  5 yo refused to eat it after a couple of bites, but he's picky.

Made this last night followed directions exactly.  The dish was just ok. Not really as much flavor as I'd hoped for. The sauce is nice the sour cream really makes it creamy. Must have missed something - won't make again

very good and easy to make! I have made this twice. The first time as written and the second, I halved the sour cream to cut down on calories. They were both great!

Cooked this for my Hungarian partner and he liked it. I think I added an extra tablespoon of paprika (he's a paprika fiend) and he said it had too much paprika (never thought I would hear him say that), so probably the 3 Tbsp is authentic.  Didn't use the bacon grease; instead, just used EVOO.  I also made OhioMom's spaetzle; never made dumplings before so they were ugly, but they did work well with the paprikash. Very easy recipe, and I love that it cooks all in one pan!

I'm vegetarian, so I substituted Quorn cutlets instead of the chicken and threw in some mushrooms. Also, used butter as suggested instead of the bacon fat.  The recipe came out perfect. I had a veggie paprikash soup and loved the sauce, so I had to try it with the veggie substitutes.  The cutlets don't need the full hour to cook and the mushrooms were thrown in at the end.

There are several spaetzle recipes this would be great with. I saw a Hungarian soup recipe in our local paper and it makes me curious for other Hungarian fare. This sounds delish and I will make it and update my rating! ;-)

This recipe came out great. I used fresh ground pepper ( the kind that has the four dif color peppercorns in it ) and a pinch of cayenne because i didnt have red pepper flakes. After the chicken was cooked through, I took it out and set it aside, then made the "Dumplings" recipe from this site, added a can of chicken broth to the pan and mixed it in then dropped the dumplings into it. Covered the pan and cooked them for 10 mins as the dumpling recipe says. While that was cooking i made the sour cream mixture. Once the dumplings were done i mixed the rest of the stuff back in, including the chicken, which i removed all the bones from. I also added another tablespoon of my sweet hungarian paprika, which was a mistake, i should of went with the suggested amount, a pinch of cayenne, and a little tiny bit of extra salt when i put the can of broth in. This turned out so good! My family members who make this put red wine or something in it. It was interesting to taste the traditional recipe.

Simply delicious.  I served over OHIOMOM1's recipe for spaetzel in these reviews - those were excellent!

This is so good.  I usually make it into a Mexican style dinner with beans and rice and make burritos out of it.  Really good.  I usually use olive oil instead of bacon grease cause I always have that on hand and it turns out just as good.

Pretty darn tasty.  The bacon grease yeilds a slight smokey flavor.  I cut up the chicken into bite-size pieces, so tenders or loins or breasts... doesn't matter, whatever is cheapest.  I think, while not as authentic, would be better over rice or with ready-made tortellini (popped in and cooked with for about 5 minutes).  I only used one can of chicken broth, not 3 as a review suggested, and I still found it way to soupy.  In a bowl I put a ladleful of the liquid with some cornstarch, whisked it up, and put it back in the pot.  I also think I may put green beans in at the last minute next time, as perhaps it could use some "green" in there somewhere.  Good stuff, not too spicy and quite flavorful, will make again.

Made as indicated, except possibly more garlic.  I went easy on the red peppers because I'm feeding a toddler.  I'm on my third bowl of this today, it was delicious!  The suggestion to have nice crusty bread is a good one.  I used penne pasta which worked great for holding onto the sauce.  Definitely a favorite, and easy to do.

This recipe should use chicken breast, boneless and skinless...I find that the bones are more of a bother, and the skin falls off. Bread dumplings are a nice side dish.
