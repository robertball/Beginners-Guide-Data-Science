We are not a gluten free family but I had some gluten-free flour left over from a family member's visit so I thought I would give this recipe a try.   It was really tasty and hubby would not have known it was gluten free.  I didn't drain the sausage grease as directed - I just reduced the amount of butter instead.  Thanks for a nice gluten free recipe.

I have Celiac disease and have to live a strict gluten free life. I came across this recipe and although it didn't have a ton of reviews, I gave it a shot. It was extremely easy and a crowd pleaser. I used GF bisquick to make easy drop biscuits and I made a delicious GF chicken fried steak.

I baked fries, topped with cheese curds & broiled until melted... then topped it with this AWESOME gravy.  I added chopped up portobella mushrooms to the cooked sausage meat before adding gf-flour.  Just make sure your sausage is gluten-free if that's what you're going for.

I'll give you a gluten free sausage recipe...
Brown sausage, add milk, spices and thicken with cornstarch (Mix with a little bit of cold water)... It is actually easier with cornstarch as cornstarch doesn't add flavor... And plus, with the use of cornstarch, it's always free of gluten and tasty... >_

My 24 and 16 yr old sons are my taste testers. They tell me if it tastes "fake" or like the non-GF recipe. This got the thumbs up from both. I used rice milk, vanilla flavored. One loved the extra sweetness, the other said I should use the unflavored next time. Just depends on your preference.

Alternatively you can just leave the sausage fat and omit the butter. I love butter, but would rather not waste the free fat that comes from the sausage. Other than that it was perfect.

We are a biscuits/gravy kind of family. I was reluctant to make gf sausage gravy since my daughter was diagnosed with celiac.  I made it tonight with gluten free flour & followed this recipe to the tee...still feeling reluctant about how  it was going to turnout I must say...this was absolutely....AMAZING!! LOVED IT! So happy to think we will be able to make this more often!  :) Now I just have to make the biscuits...another night! My gravy the last time turned out terrible because I used wayyy to much gf flour. You don't need very much flour for gravy like you would regular flour.  So I know now less is much better with gf flour!!! Thank you very much for this recipe!

I loved this! It was just like the kind you order at family style restaurants. Only problem was it took so long to make that everyone already ate breakfast by the time it was done and I was the only one that ate it !

This was amazing! My non-gf husband and daughter tore it up! The only changes I made were turkey sausage and I used GF bisquick. It took a little longer than expected but SO worth it! I also made biscuits with the GF bisquick.

My sister surprsed me with this recipe for an Easter breakfast.  It was so good, I did eat gravy with a spoon.  I put it on the GF biscuits she made and the egg casserole.  It was a successful surprise.

Because my son has Chron's Disease we are trying lots of different recipes without gluten, dairy & sausage. Substituted rice milk & non-dairy butter for dairy& chicken sausage for pork. It was tasty. Also, because we used rice  milk, it did not collagulate & is good reheated.

Delicious! Made it for a mixed crowd and no one suspected gluten free. I used a different gluten free flour blend and it worked fine. I was a little skeptical of making the gravy with the sausage in the pan because whisking is difficult with chunky stuff, but it worked fine. I will use less milk next time though. I don't think you really need that much. It looked good between 4-5 cups, but personal preference. Also not having a pepper grinder, I estimated 30 cranks to be roughly 2 teaspoons. Worked out well. Highly recommend. Will make again!

I cut this recipe in half... yummy.  But next time I'll probably leave the sausage fat & use less butter.

Good basic recipe. Here are a few things I found helpful: 10 TB flour = about 2/3 Cup (I thought that was an odd way to list an ingredient like flour, but whatever). As others have suggested, sub some of the sausage/bacon (whatever you're using) fat for the gratuitous amount of butter called for. 
I used King Arthur Flour's Measure for Measure flour for my thickening agent. Obviously 2% or whole milk will yield a bit nicer mouthfeel, but skim works fine.  4/5 stars for the weird butter amount, which I found unnecessary.

This was way too much flour and milk. I'll half them both next time. It lost a lot of the sausage flavor.

Turned out great. Used Bobs RedMill brown rice flour. Let cook on sausage crumbles extra long to help get rid of gritty texture.

Since going GF when I got my Celiac Diagnosis I thought I wasn't going to be able to have biscuits and gravy anymore. I am so glad I found this recipe - it was easy to make, delicious,  and am able to enjoy on of my favorite breakfast foods still!! My only critique is that it could have used a little more salt... but that is a a personal preference. I hope others enjoy it too.

I’ve made this many times and we love it! I actually just use regular flour as we aren’t gluten free and I only use 4 cups total of milk. I also add sage to taste as the sausage we use is unseasoned and we really like the flavor. 1-2 teaspoons sage depending on the day and the sage, and I use about 90 grinds of pepper rather than 60. All personal preferences but my family gobbles this and loves it! My MIL was from the south and she made this dish a lot for his family and for ours as well before she passed. It’s a favorite and my husband is happy with his I make it. He’s picky and since there is an emotional attachment to the dish I’m so happy that we can enjoy the food and remember his mom this way.

I've made this a dozen times. My wife is GF and we always make this when friends and family are over. Those who are not GF can't tell a difference and love it. We use Trader Joe's GF flour. The only slight change I do is not to discard the sausage grease and use less butter (about 1/2 cup).

I loved this gravy recipe. I accidentally bought italian sausage, so we used this and it turned out really great! I also didn't think the 6 cups of milk through, so we ended up using only 5 because our skillet wasn't quite big enough. It was still enough food and it intensified the flavor a bit, which was a good thing! :) excellent recipe!

This gravy is the perfect sausage gravy for buscuits and gravy!  I have tried different quicker versions with cornstarch and other Gf flour methods but it never turned out just right. This recipe takes a bit longer but is well worth the time spent!

I used measure-for-measure gf flour and used salted butter. It was just AMAZING and my daughter loves that she can enjoy a favorite food again (since discovering her allergy).

This recipe even pleased my mother-in-law! As a celiac family it's always daunting making a dish for our gluten loving relatives, but this was an absolute hit. In addition to the spices we also added garlic powder, adobo, and Mrs. Dash Italian Herb blend. Put over bisquick gf biscuits with an over easy egg on top!

This is something I make for special occasions or per request of granddaughter.  I use lean ground sausage, therefore, need to add butter after frying up the lean meat, then add the flour.  I also use gluten free flour for both biscuits and  gravy.  Often I use some dried onion while frying up the sausage meat too, and garlic powder as well as lots of pepper.  Then, something else I like to do, and there is no limit, is add spices!  Lots of  marvelous dried savory spices.  Rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley even.  And a heaping teaspoon of "better than bullion" chicken broth concentrate (low sodium) to the mix.  I use a can of evaporated milk, plus one can of water instead of regular milk.  The flavor is rich, and creamy and perfect spiced.  In the biscuit mix, I add butter also, (or butter flavor natural shortening) and a small pack of stevia to slightly sweeten the dough.  YUM!  Gluten Free and darn good.  These little tricks will please everyone.

No need to tell anyone that this is gluten free, it doesn't even change from the regular stuff. I followed one of the reviewer's by keeping the sausage grease and just omitted some of the butter. It worked perfectly. Thank you for the recipe.
