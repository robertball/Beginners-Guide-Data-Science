Wow!  Tasty,quick and easy.  No cilantro at home, so used italian parsley.  Make sure fish are very dry before going in the pan - extra moisture adds to the time to thicken the sauce and leads to leathery fish.  Well, as leathery as halibut cheeks can get.

This is an outstanding recipe!  I added a tsp of orange zest and an extra Tbs of fresh squeezed OJ and it was dynamite!  Served with black rice drizzled with sesame oil and snap peas, a new favorite.  Thanks!

Another winner in my opinion.  You do have to be nutty about the cooking time however. No more than 3 or 4 minutes if you want tender Halibut.

Really good.  I used tilapia instead as I can't get good, fresh halibut in FL.

Wow!  So good and so easy.  I was halfway through mixing up the sauce when I realized I was out of cilantro so I left it out and it was still great.  I didn't measure everything exactly so I know I was a little heavy on the ginger and garlic but we like it that way.  I also used tilapia instead of halibut, we love it but fresh halibut is just too expensive for an everyday meal.

Amazing. Unique combination of flavors. This is now one of our all-time favorite halibut recipes. I didn't have halibut cheeks so just used a regular filet. The first time I made it I used vegetable oil because I didn't have sesame oil. It was very good -- but the second time I used sesame oil and could taste a big difference. I wouldn't recommend substitutions with this recipe.

This dish was great. I used Talapia rather than Halibut. I made the sauce ahead and kept it in the freezer. Made for an great no fuss fish dish.

This recipe is fantastic!  This is the first time I have recommended a dish in years of allrecipe use - it is a must try!  We used Halibut steaks and cooked them in the pan without the red pepper flakes.  After we took out the fish, we added the chili flakes to the pan and reduced the sauce.  We ate the fish with the sauce and our kids were happy to go sauceless.  Our 1 and 3 year old gobbled up the fish (truly gobbled - our 1 year old had 3rds!)

Great! I made it as written (which is the only way to rate it) and my only suggestion is to make more!  I made a lot more (2 kids, 2 adults) to drizzle on our wild rice blend and steamed cauliflower and it was fantastic. My 3 yr old enjoyed helping make it too, since it gets put together in the bowl first. Thanks!

Nice recipe. It works on larger halibut as well. Watch the fish closely as it will cook quickly.

This is a great recipe! I used  salmon instead, and doubled the amount of ginger. It's great, but I won't add as much ginger next time.

Wowie! Delicious! Just the right blend of spices and flavors. Not too sweet, not too spicy. I rarely use fresh cilantro or ginger because they go bad (and waste money), so I used the jarred spice versions and still delicious. I boiled the sauce on the stove, added a pinch of cornstarch to thicken the sauce just a tiny bit, grilled halibut steaks and spooned the sauce over them. Couldn't believe "I" made this gourmet dish! Tasted beyond my skill level. Would be a great dish for "company" - will impress! Succulent!

This really is a great recipe. In terms of taste, I'd give it 4 stars out of 5, which in my book means something tastes really good. Overall though, I give this one a 5 out of 5 because it's quick, easy, and relatively cheap to make if you use a different type of fish other than halibut(I used flounder).  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was tasty. I used Bassa fish fillets and cut them into bite-sized pieces.  I spooned the fish/orange sauce over mashed potatoes.  Next time I think I'll make rice.

I didn't think it was possible to make something so awesome outside a restaurant. This was divine, and so very easy. My only mistake was using a cast iron skillet (things stuck to the pan despite its well used state and plenty of olive oil). Next time, I will use my stainless skillets. I served it with fingerling potatoes and roasted vegetables but honestly the author's suggestion of jasmine rice and asparagus would have topped what I did.

So easy, so good.  It really is just the sauce to add a lot of punchy flavor to any white fish.  We'll do it with rock fish, next.

Absolutely delicious! I had one pound of cheeks so I doubled the sauce. I recommend removing the fish from the pan after searing. Then you can add the sauce to the pan, deglaze and reduce, then add the fish back for the last couple of minutes to finish it. If you leave the fish in the pan during the reducing is going to be overcooked. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a great way to make the halibut cheeks we had in our freezer. The combination of the cilantro and the soy sauce and orange juice created such a fresh taste. Love this recipe! I didn't change anything but could have used more orange juice than called for and a little less ginger.

This recipe was so flavorful, quick, and easy. I made it mostly as written, but with coconut aminos instead of soy sauce and with halibut filets instead of cheeks.  I think this recipe would be great with any white fish.  I paired with ginger and garlic roasted cauliflower and braised purple cabbage. It made a beautiful plate.

Fantastic recipe, this one has become a weekly staple in our home. We get rave reviews whenever we serve it to guests. Works really well with salmon as well. You can marinate and then cook it in the oven also. Thumbs up !!

This sauce did not taste good at all. The orange didn't pair right with the ginger, sesame, cilantro and soy. I just couldn't palette it. Was so acidic.

We are lucky to have a local source of "cheeks". I have prepared them using many recipes. These are quick, healthy and so delish!  I added more cilantro!!!!

This is really delicious! Recommend doubling the sauce (or more) as it's really good over rice served with the fish. Awesome and easy!
