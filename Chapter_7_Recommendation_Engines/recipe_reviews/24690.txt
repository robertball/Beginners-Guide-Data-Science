This was fun and very easy!  Reminds me of a popular candy bar.  My boys LOVED them.  I'm giving this recipe a five because it was exactly what I was looking for, yummy and easy! Even better the next day!

Didn't think these would be tasty, but they are really good.  And the kids really loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe!
