This is a easy to prepair recipe, my family and friends just love it. A granddaughter who won't eat pumpkin liked it and told her mom to get the recipe.

This recipe is Amazing! I have made it several times and alsways it is a hit!! Be prepared to double the recipe because the first two will be gone before you can blink!!  Also (someimtes I substitute with a premade graham crust & is just fine...Great with a topping...I use 1 cup chopped pecans, 3/4 brown sugar, 6 tbs chilled butter cut in squares, mix well and spread evenly, refridge overnite!) This recipe is cheesecake Heaven for sure!!!

This recipe was great.  I made it for a company Thanksgiving BBQ and everyone who tried it loved it! Instead of laying the graham crackers flat, I ground them up and added some brown sugar. I accidentally added all 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar to the pie filling, so then I still had to go in and add the other 1/2 cup to the sour cream topping. It turned out great though. I think the next time I make it I will probably add regular whip cream on top of the sour cream topping!

I love this recipe.  I don't care for pumpkin pie, but i love cheesecake and decided to try this one out.  I chose to use 2 store bought pre-made graham cracker crusts and it was wonderful.

This turned out wonderful tasting. The only problem I had was getting the center done. I let it cook an extra 20 minutes, and yes, the oven had been preheated, but it still wasn't set. I added the last layer and baked that until it was set, but the center of the pan did not ever fully set.... The taste was extraordinary though. I would make it again.

This was wonderful and everyone enjoyed it more than a pumpkin pie !
I made the traditional graham cracker crust, but the filling is what makes this incredible : )

Don't be fooled by the sexy photo - this dessert came out so ugly I almost did not serve it to guests. Lining the pan with foil makes the sugar-butter on the "crust" (which left must to be desired) stick to it and the "crust" got ripped up trying to remove the bars. The foil just made a plain-old-mess. The flavor was "OK", at best, and wasn't worth the hassle of digging out the bars.

The crust in the recipe was not impressive. It stuck to the foil. I recommend that you use the regular graham cracker crust. The filling tasted great and was so easy to mix in my smoothie machine. I did have to bake it at least 15 extra minutes after adding the sour cream layer. I will be searching for a different recipe.

This was the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made. Very mild pumpkin flavor. I didn't follow recipe exactly, I used two pre-made graham cracker crumb pie pans. The sour cream topping gave it a nice "something extra". The entire family loved it.

This is a fantastically delicious cheesecake. A huge hit! Just a little comment for assured success. The cooking time has to be at least 1 1/4 hrs for the filling. We used a food processor as there is no way the mixture would have mixed properly in a deep blender. Also, we used a spring form pan for a great shape and natural vanilla in the topping which was another crowd pleaser. We also used already crushed graham crackers and crushed walnuts on top as a final garnish. We can't wait to make this cake again!

My husband loves this cheesecake. I substitute the graham cracker crust for ginger snaps. Just put the ginger snaps in the food processor. It's a perfect little kick to the recipe.

The flavor was great, but like another reviewer, I had issues getting the center to set.  I also thought the top layer was a bit thin.  If I were to make this again, I think I would cut the main recipe in half and make it pie sized.  I would probably keep the topping amounts the same though.

Turned out good! I had my 6 yr old son helping and distracting me so I put all the brown sugar in the filling (but still turned out good) All the kids and husband loved it. It took 1 1/2 hours to cook and seems to firm up in the fridge too. Will make it again, maybe with a little less help....

Yum, yum ... this is baking as we speak to celebrate my mom on Mother's Day this Sunday. So far, everything I've snitched while putting it together has tasted fab so I can't wait to try the finished result! Do take care when spreading the hot butter and sugar over the graham crackers, this is VERY hot and could result in a nasty burn!! (As it did for me!) I've put the second layer on and after 7 minutes it is still not set. I shall post a photo when it's complete.  Finished product is wonderful! If you're not a sour cream fan you won't like the top layer.

I love this recipe except i would have to agree with another review. I also could not get the center to cook right. I did it exactly the way it said but 30 minutes was not enough time for the cooking process. I will try this recipe again and will try cooking it for much longer.

This was a good base recipe. I used more as a guide then following it to the letter. I used pre-prepared graham cracker crust. It took alot longer to cook then the original recipe states. I sprinkled crushed pecans on the top and it was a hit.
