Delicious! Like every recipe, I made some changes to fit my family.  You can do pretty much whatever, but for ease, I'd use a can of pineapple tidbits - soooo much easier and just as tasty. It has just enough zing to it.

Good recipe.  I've put the jars into a cool, dark larder to allow the curry powder to mellow in flavour.  Nonetheless on initial tasting, there's a nice sweet/spicy flavour.  I also put in some sultanas to give it some contrasting colour.

I skipped the onions because of family allergies and substituted a can of crushed pineapple for the real deal.  Still great!  Loved it with chicken breasts.  Would be a fab sandwich addition too.

This chutney is very good. I have already made it twice and have plans to make it again. I mixed equal parts chutney with mayonnaise to dress a cole slaw, which was excellent! I have also used it a lot as a sandwich spread on chicken, turkey and tuna sandwiches.

This was absolutely delicious. The difficulty with cutting the mango made it a little longer to make, but next time I might try to find it precut or frozen.

absolutely perfect. it is sweet and spicy making your taste buds tingle.  I stick it in the refrigerator and it stays fresh.  The chutney goes great on chicken, adding flavor to the meal.

Loved the chutney recipe.  I served it with another recipe from Allrecipes, Tangy Grilled Pork Tenderloin and they were both a hit.

Loved this chutney!  I added a couple of handfuls of dried cranberries.  Just used a tiny pinch of crushed red pepper flakes as I don't like spicy chutney.  (I serve it with spicy dishes).  I froze the extras in small containers to keep and give to friends.  Had to leave the house for the simmering time so I put it in a crockpot on low for 1 hour.  Then I removed the lid and let the extra liquid reduce down for another 2-3 hours.  I think the entire dish can be make by putting it all in a crock pot (low) all day & removing the lid for the last third of cooking time.  Plus the kitchen will smell wonderful all day. Will try that and report back. :) ---

Excellent recipe! The only thing I would add would be some Scotch Bonnet Peppers. Not many, just enough to feel it! Try lightly drizzling this over crispy fried chicken!

Not what I expected. Turned out more bland than I expected but I think not enough fruit flavor. Will try to use fresher fruit and more of it.

I substituted Sultana raisins for 2 of the mangoes, because I only had one.  It turned out just fine.

I made some subtle changes, just a bit more ginger.  I absolutely love this chutney.  It is refreshing and goes well with salmon, chicken and lamb.  Easy to make and keeps well in the refrigerator.  Although, mine didn't have a chance to get spoiled. It was eaten quickly.  It makes a bunch so keep a quart and give another as a gift.

Made this to go with the ham at Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit. I used frozen mangos and estimated the amount. Turned out delicious!!!

left out the mangoes, and used red bell pepper instead for a little color.  also used 1 tbsp of yellow curry powder, with 1/2 tbsp of mild curry paste.  it was amazing.  the sweetness of the pineapple with the curry kick, and the ginger...oh my gosh it was so delicious.  we used this as a topping for slow-cooker Kalua pork.

Spectacular! Had to make a minor change; I didn't have curry powder, so used mild curry paste, which worked fine. This has just a hint of background heat and didn't overpower the grilled halibut. It's going on grilled pork loin tonight.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, I make many variety's of Chutney's and Jellies to sell in bake sales for charity. This was perfect, great colour  and texture. I used our home made blend of Curry Powder which made it a bit on the hot side But perfect for spicy food lovers. Today I am making another batch with just a teaspoonful of our home made curry powder ,it should be just about perfect again.
Love this recipie

Normally I steer away from too spicy but this is wonderful! a little zip without a big burn, the pineapple/mango gives the perfect sweetness I stuffed it inside a chicken burger and Oh My Goodness...yummy! Next, I'm trying shrimp.

I detest mango so I cut it out. That and the fact that I pre-prepped saved a lot of cook time. Still, it was amazing with Roti and grilled chicken.

I have made this several times.  I use a large package of frozen diced mangos.  Much quicker.  I use fresh pineapple, much more flavor than the canned stuff.  I toss in a couple handfuls of raisins for added color.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious, with just the right amount of heat. My fresh mango and pineapple were really sweet so I should have cut back on the sugar, but overall an excellent outcome. I will definitely make this again!

I made this two weeks ago. I'd never made chutney before. I brought it for my church dinner and they all demanded I make more to take home. It was easy and very delicious. Tasted amazing with baked chicken and coco bread. I forgot to take a picture. I am looking forward to making more this weekend.

Like others suggested I used canned crushed pineapple and a bit more sugar.  While result  tasted strongly of mango it was rather bland and uninteresting for us.  There is so much variety in curry powders that could make all the difference.
