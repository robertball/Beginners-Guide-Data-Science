Lovely, simple flavor. I omitted both the margarine (and if I had wanted the extra calories, I would have used butter for its superior taste) and sugar, which is unnecessary in properly prepared tomato recipes. Also cut the soda to a mere sprinkle. The result was perfection. I incorporated milk instead of cream for a lighter, fresher flavor. For those of you who have had problems with the cream curdling, try tempering the cream. After heating it, add a spoonful of the hot soup into it and stir it in. Add another couple of spoonfuls and stir. After adding about a cup of hot soup this way, whisk your cream mixture into the pot of hot soup. The soup should be at the barest simmer, not a rippin' boil. Possibilities for garnishes of your bowls of soup include julienne strips of fresh basil leaves, a tsp of freshly grated Parmesan or Asiago, or finely minced pepperoni.

This is a "great tomato flavor" soup.  But be careful ~ if the base is boiling when adding the cream, the cream can curdle.  Hint ~ heat the cream until hot, but not boiling before adding to tomatoes.

Best tomato soup recipe ever.
Notes: Don't add any more than the 1/4 tsp baking soda, ie don't guess! b/c you will totally kill the acidity of the soup and end up trying to compensate with vinegar.
Add whatever spices you personally like when you add the minced onion. This makes the soup recipe "yours" I like to add an italian spice mix with crushed red pepper and some balsamic vinegar at the very end. SO good.

Many thanks to Lee Ann for this awesome recipe!

Are there more than 5 stars?  This recipe is a "10" as far as I'm concerned.  My hubby and I have had the "world famous" tomato soup from the 4B's Restaurant in Montana and I believe this was actually better!  I'd been searching for a long time for this, since the restaurant won't give out their recipe anymore, and I thought for sure we were back in Montana when we ate this.  Thank you so much for a great recipe - I owe you one!

Excellet soup! At least, I thought so. My husband and father in law are Cuban, so anything sweet at the supper table is a no no with them. This soup is superb, however if you do NOT like a "sweet" soup, this isn't for you. Next time I make it just for them, I will obmit the sugar. I will try it myself just to see how it tastes without the sugar. Tomatoes can be sweet anyway. So if you would rather have a "tomato-y" type of soup rather than a sweet tasting one, leave out the soup. But otherwise, this is GREAT!

Wow!  This is the best tomato soup ever.  I have made it 5 times, and 2 times ate all of it by myself!  I agree with the others about running it through a blender briefly.  A little chunkyness is good tho.  I have eaten it without the cream, and it is still good, however I like it best with just a cup of half and half added.  Also, if you use tomato's with garlic and basil, reduce the chicken stock by half, and omit the cream, you have a great and easy marinara!

This soup is excellent.  My husband said it was the best soup I ever made and I've made many excellent soups.  The only change I made is I don't use margarine so I added real butter.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will LOVE it.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy!  I agree that some of the diced tomatoes should be pureed (I put about half the can into a blender) to make the soup a little thinner.  It's great for dipping grilled cheese!  Great texture.

I lead a hospitality team at church. We take care of our musicians, tech and production teams each weekend during our 4 services, and this was my weekend to cook. I had 40 people to feed, and since it was a nice Fall day, I thought I would do some comfort food.  I made this recipe and the grilled cheese recipe also from this website.  When I returned to help clean up, you would not believe the amazing comments that I received.  Actually, it was a bit overwhelming.  Everyone thought the soup and sandwiches were out of this world and received many requests for the recipe.  I heard that the one musician ate 3 bowls and then someone decided that it was even more fun to drink the soup from a Styrofoam cup.  Hey, whatever makes them happy, makes me happy.  Thank you so much for helping me to make the arts/tech/productions teams happy!  I will definitely make this for one of our Christmas rehearsals in December!

Excellent!  My husband actually said it was the best tomato soup he has ever had....I told him that was exactly what the recipe creator said :) I pureed most of the tomatoes, as one reviewer suggested, and left only about 1/4 of the tomatoes "whole".  I liked the creamy-ness, with just a bit of texture from the tomato.   A happy discovery - I made the base ahead of time, just so I would have less work to do at the end of the day.  This allowed the mixture to cool, eliminating the need to heat the cream so it wouldn't curdle.  I added the cream when we were ready to eat, and heated the entire thing at one time. Served with grilled swiss cheese and tuna sandwiches and marble rye.  It was a yummy dinner!

I used butter instead of margerine and added one whole minced clove of garlic. I sauteed the onion and garlic in the and seasoned with fresh ground black pepper and sea salt before adding the rest of the soup ingredients. I used fat free half-n-half and did not use the full amount of, I just added enough to give it a creamy mouth feel. Very good tomato soup. I made italian grilled cheese sandwiches to go with for a comforting, quick supper.

Easy and delicious recipe that should encourage anyone to stop buying those nasty condensed soups at the grocery store. A few comments: I found 2 cups of cream to be too much and I only ended up adding about half of that; it was plenty creamy. Also, I did not add the sugar. America is so over-sugared and I didn't miss a thing by leaving it out. It was sweet enough just from the tomatos. And do yourself a favor and use real butter - bugs won't even eat margarine ;) Although not necessary, I did buzz it with my stick blender so it wasn't quite so chunky. Someone else had commented about tempering the cream to avoid it curdling and that was an excellent tip.

Very good.  Doubled recipe and only used about 2 1/2 cups of cream.  Next time I will start out with half the sugar and baking soda.  Very sweet and not enough acidity for my taste.  I used san marzano tomatoes, which I hadn't used before, and I think they are sweeter than what I usually buy.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used a quart of my home canned whole tomatoes, and a half of a chopped onion.  I sauteed the onion in the butter until soft and then added the tomatoes juice and all.  I smashed the tomatoes with a spoon.  I only used a teaspoon of sugar and one cup of fat free half and half.  Two cups would have been too much.  I used my immersion blender to make it a smooth texture and added a can of tomato sauce.  I served it for lunch and hubby and I agreed it was better than the stuff in the can.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Normally, tomato soup is not my thing. But with it being requested by my fiance one near Halloween night, I sought out this recipe. . . It was the best variation to tomato soup I have ever had. It had a creamy factor that can not be explained without experience. I added a festive "eye ball" look to it I got out of a Martha Stewart magazine which basically consisted of Mozerella Balls with olive slices (As seen in my picture). This recipe is an entitee of itself and even if you don't like tomato soup, at least give it a try. . .

Absolutely delicious.  My husband declared it the best soup he has ever had, of any kind.  I made one small change to this recipe: I used diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic and I pureed it in a blender for smoother texture.  This will make a frequent appearance in my weekend lunch menu.

This recipe could be a 5* but it's WAY TOO SWEET, (IMO)! I had to add a lot of salt to make it edible. I will definitely make this again but omit the sugar altogether.

Butter rather than margarine, homemade tomato sauce, NO sugar and not sure if the baking soda made any difference.  (I'm convinced it wasn't necessary, but what the heck)  Not quite as tomato-y as I wanted, so I added some tomato juice to compensate. Also added some salt and pepper to taste. Not at all necessary to simmer this for an hour! I think 20 minutes or so was plenty.  Just heated the cream a bit in the microwave before adding to the soup which I had on low heat.  Garnished with a swirl of homemade basil pesto I had in the freezer.  EXcellent.

Totally Awesome! I have not made homemade tomato soup for 20 years and this was wonderful. We will be enjoying this often. It is so nice and creamy smooth. You have to incorporate the cooked tomato into the cream first whisking it by 1/2 cup at a time until you have about 1/2 of the tomato mixture mixed into the cream and then blend them both and you will not have curdling. Heat up just under the boiling point and enjoy. The soda cuts the sharp tomato taste. Make sure that you cook it for the entire hour as it really blends the flavors. I served it with hot fresh bread and it was an great lunch. Enjoy.

I liked this a lot but my husband just said it was ok.  Picky men...my kids weren't home to give me their opinion.  I agree with other posters - this only makes enough to feed 4 - not sure how much one would serve to get 11 servings out of this.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELISH!!! the only changes i made, and only because i had to being on a low carb diet, was to replace the sugar with a couple of Splenda 'pills', leave out the chicken stock and baking soda--i found it dosent need it, I used butter instead of margerine, added a bit of basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and i used my trusty potatoe masher on the canned tomatoes and it worked great! OH, IS THIS DELICOUS! this would make a great base for steak or sauteed meat and veggies!

This is an excellent tomato soup recipe. Since finding it (I choose to make this one after the reviews comparing it to the 4B's restaurant version, which is highly regarded), I have made it dozens of times, including it now being a standard on our annual ski trip. I always double the recipe and use the Italian herb diced tomatoes for some added flavor, blending up about 1.5 cans and leaving .5 can unblended for a little bit of chunk. I have tried it using half and half since I was thinking to lower the fat content but it's just not as good or as thick/creamy as I like so I stick to the whipping cream now. I've never bothered heating the cream beforehand tho--I just add it straight to the soup and have never had a problem. This is a keeper, no doubt about it!

This was the best tomato soup  I have ever had. It is definitely a keeper. I did cut the sugar down a tiny bit, microwaved the heavy cream and pureed the entire soup in the blender before serving. I also topped off the soup bowls with sharp cheddar cheese. DELICIOUS!

This is a great and easy soup.  I used a can of chicken broth and reduced it down in place of the already condensed broth.  Also threw in a chicken boullion cube.  For spices, parsley, thyme, garlic powder, tony's, salt and pepper. Used a little less sugar.  Timpered the cream with the soup before adding instead of heating it seperately.  Start with half the sugar then add the rest only if needed.  Quick, easy, and delicious.  Serve with grilled cheese.

Simple and delicious!  I've had people begging me to make this for them.  I use 1% milk instead of cream and it is still wonderful (and much better for you).  Thanks.

I usually follow recipes, but I found adding butter and sugar unnecessary.  Instead I added extra onion and salt and pepper.  It was quite delicious.

This recipe was great. I didn't have an hour to simmer so i left out the onions. I wanted to keep it somewhat healthy so i used skim milk instead of cream and added everything all at once. After it had cooked about 15 minutes i mixed 1 Tbsp corn starch with just enough cold water to let it mix, and put that in the soup which thickened it up and made it seem very creamy without the cream. Seasoned with Northern Italian seasoning from Costco and some salt. It was the best tomato soup i have ever had!

Great soup! I tried the soup both with cream and without cream... I don't know which one is better. I used only a 1/4c heavy cream. I also used 1/2 of a sweet onion, 1/2 of a yellow bell pepper, 1 minced fresh clove of garlic, and a handful of fresh chopped basil. One of the best tomato soups I have ever had.

There is no way this soup is 11 servings. I think it really should be 4 servings.

By the way, make sure the soup cools down before adding the cream to prevent curdling.  I made the mistake of adding the cream too early once and I ended up with chunkies in the soup.

This is a very tasty soup, but it was a little heavy on the cream for my taste.  I added some fresh basil and used an immersion blender on the tomato part before adding the cream.  Very tasty!

This was awesome! The best tomato soup I've ever had. I pureed the tomatoes in the blender before cooking, heated the cream in the microwave before adding to the soup and didn't have a fresh onion so used onion powder. I also had the grilled cheese sandwiches cooked in the oven from this site. Sharp cheddar cheese on fresh italian bread. So much easier than frying in the pan. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Delicious soup!  I did not have a large can of tomatoes so subbed one 14 oz. can of plain diced tomatoes and one with garlic & olive oil.  I also doubled the amount of onions and used the dehydrated type.  Also added 1 tsp. dried basil, 1/2 tsp. all-purpose herb seasoning, 2 Tab. dried parsley, and 1 tsp. salt.  Because of my cholesterol issues, I subbed fat-free half & half for the whipping cream.  Result was truly delicious!  Try this low-fat version; you are sure to love it.

After one bite, my husband claimed it was the best tomato soup he had ever had.  While I thought it was good, I didn't have the exact same feeling.  The sweetness left me feeling a bit confused, as I was wanting more of a thick, tomatoey soup.  I halved this recipe, and after 20 minutes, my tomato/chicken brothe had about halved itself.  That may have been the reason for the lack of thickness.

This is SO easy to make and it also makes a good snack or put in a cup to have as a hot drink.  I always puree it before I stir the hot milk in.  And add basil.

Really good - made some changes: Simmered tomatoes and broth (omitted onions) with margarine, sugar, baking soda, garlic, red chile flakes, basil, and salt and pepper for 20 mins.  Pureed in blender.  Returned to boil on the stove and added cheddar.  Right before serving mixed in fat free half and half.  Perfect with grilled cheese croutons!

I gave this 4 stars only because my family absolutely loved it.  I was only luke warm about it.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, but it was a bit too sweet for me.  I added salt after the fact and that seemed to help.

very good and easy to make, and smells awesome while its cooking.
only changed a few things to personalize it for me-
blend tomatoes, 1 small yellow onion, 4-8 cloves fresh garlic, then add chicken stock and sugar and blend until smooth.  add to cooking pot with the butter and 6-8 culantro leaves which really brings out the flavor of all the ingredients while adding a subtle hint of cilantro, but easier to remove at the end. the baking soda is not needed at all.
if cooking on the stove, simmer for at least an hour with the lid on, or if doing a double+ batch, use the crockpot on low for about 7-8 hours. add the cream at the end.

I found that this soup had very little tomato flavor. I had to add 2 more cans of tomatos (about 380z) I also used my immersion blender to make it a bit more creamy. Altogether this was a good recipe after some adjustments.

Delicious soup!  I have made it following the recipe exactly as well as by altering the amount of cream (less to make less fattening).  I have also replaced cream with half and half, and even milk to make a lower fat and calorie soup.  I also use italian diced tomatoes (tomatoes w/basil, garlic and oregano) for more flavor.

Super yummy! I used crushed tomatoes, and since I am a vegetarian, I used vegetable stock instead of chicken.  I omitted the sugar and used 1/2 cream and 1/2 half and half.  I heated the cream mixture in the microwave (in a Pyrex measuring cup,) tempered it before adding it to the soup and it was lovely.  MMMM.  So good.

I give it 5 stars with my improvements, 4 stars without. Here is what I did:  1. Added 4 cloves garlic, 4 leaves of fresh basil and a tbsp of fresh Italian parsley. Salt and pepper to taste.  2. Reduced amount of sugar to 1 tbsp and cream to 1 cup.  I didn't preheat the cream, I just added it right in at the end of the cooking time. It was SUPER tasty, and I loved the chunkiness of it. One of the reasons I rate this recipe so high is the ease of preparation. I will never make canned tomato soup again!

We cut the recipe in half which was just enough for two people and was fun to make since I got to use my immersion blender for less chunks. I wasn't that thrilled with the flavor and ended up adding some red pepper and Creole seasoning for body. We'll probably try it again with half and half for less calories.

I've lost count of how many times I've made this.  Like other reviewers I use butter instead of margarine and I use my stick blender to puree it a bit before adding the cream.  Sometimes I used fire roasted tomatoes for a slightly different taste.  And when I'm watching calories/fat I'll use fat-free half and half instead of cream.  Excellent recipe.  Has that flavor we all remember from our childhood's - only so much better!

Oh My! This is delicious. I added the cream cheese, red pepper and basil from my other favorite recipe on this site (spicy tomato soup with grilled brie toast) -- otherwise, followed the directions exactly! What a treat served with cheese toast is just marvelous!

Such simple ingredients, but such big taste!  Changes I made: I used a 14oz can of petite diced tomatoes and a 14oz can of crushed tomatoes as I like a smoother consistency.  I also used half-and-half rather than cream, but I only used about 3/4c.  And really, I think this is perfectly delicious without the cream.  I also used regular chicken broth rather than the condensed and it was fine.
Great soup for the colder months!

My husband is the tomato soup fan in our family, so for someone who doesn't like tomato soup I thought it was awesome.  I did make some small variations to the recipe which just gave it a little more flavor.  Instead of just using plain diced tomatos I use the diced tomatos that had basil, garlic and oregano in them.  I also used chives instead of onions.  I blended the soup like others suggested, leaving it a little chunky but not too much.  The only thing I think I will change next time is the amount of cream to be added.  I will probably reduce this by 1/2.  Very good!

I had to throw this out. It would have been good without the whipping cream. Once I added the cream it was light pink and lost it's flavor.

Excellent recipe whether you make it exactly as written or with your own touches. I like to use my home-made chicken broth plus a little thyme and basil. I'd suggest starting with 1 cup of cream, not 2, and add more to taste, depending how rich you like it. Or use half & half. Additionally, since I like my tomato soup smooth, I tried using an immersion blender, but it didn't do as good a job as the old-fashioned blender.

But these are just details, the posted recipe is great and thanks to Lee Ann for sharing.

This was a really easy way to make a great-tasting tomato soup.  Be aware that it yields 4 cups of soup, so it really doesn't serve 11 people (unless they each get about 1/3 cup of soup).

The only thing it lacked, in my opinion, was a little "kick," which I added with a bit of cayenne and fresh basil.

However, as far as the basic ingredients and cooking method go, this is a great recipe.  Thanks!

Great soup, but I used half and half, and added fresh minced basil from my garden, YUM.  Great with or without basil, depends on what flavor you are craving. I've made this for the third time!  :o)

Excellent soup; I can't believe I overlooked this keeper in my earlier searches!  I used diced tomatoes and part way through the cooking time, I pureed half the batch in my blender so that the soup would have a chunky blend.  I like my homemade tomato soup to have some character.  I added a good splash of cognac to make the flavor a tad more complex, but it's not necessary, just personal preference.

My husband, who "doesn't like tomato soup" loves this.  I've made it for our cooking co-op and another family who "doesn't like canned tomato soup" really likes it, too.  Planning to make it for the co-op again this month!

I have been looking for a tomato soup recipe that tastes like what you get in a restaurant and this is definately it! Like other reviewers I heated my cream in the microwave. I also pureed all the starting ingredients in a blender before putting it on the stove. Thanks for the recipe!

The best tomato soup I have ever had! Substituted whole milk for heavy cream, and added 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and italian seasoning. Before adding the milk to the cooked tomatoes, I put them in a blender to get rid of the chunks. Will be making this again!

Hmmm...Well I'm not sure what exactly happened but the day I made this it wasn't too bad. I thought it could have been a bit thicker but it had a nice flavor. The strange thing is, I had the leftovers the next day and it was absolutely disgusting. I don't exactly know what happened in that fridge overnight but something scientific certainly went on with this tomato cocktail. I'm at a loss. Yes, it was refrigerated promptly and in a sealed container in a perfectly working fridge. I guess from now on I will wait a day before I do reviews as I did with this because I guess you just never know. Sorry but it would have gotten a better rating on the first day.

This soup is excellent, and I usually don't like tomato soup.  I added a little too much cream, so mine was too rich, so I'll cut back next time.  Absolutely delicious.  I also added garlic and basil, since those are staples in my kitchen.

This soup came out better than I had even hoped!  I am not normally a "tomato" person, I was actually preparing this soup for someone in my family.  After tasting this wonderful, creamy soup though, I am now a tomato soup convert!  I did slightly puree the tomatoes though and also, I would recommend doubling this recipe because one batch will not be enough!

When I made this soup, I used half and half in place of the heavy cream. I also used 1 tablespoon of sugar. For extra tomato flavor I added a 64 ounce can of Campbells Tomato Juice.
The soup was so good that even the non-tomato lovers ate it.

This was a truly delicious soup for a cold, cold day. I first made it according to the recipe, but found I wanted to make some tweaks. I doubled the amount of tomatoes for a stronger flavor, and only used half he amount of cream, substituting half and half as another reviewer suggested. I also added one tablespoon of Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. The third time this week that I made this soup (we loved it that much), I added some left over pot roast and it was a welcome, meaty addition!

This was the easiest recipe!  I have made tons of soups and none have been this easy.  I was convinced it was too simple to taste good.  But after reading all of the good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It was amazing!  All I did was add a touch of basil.  I did put the soup in the blender before adding the cream.  Otherwise, I did everything as directed. My son who is 10 years old ate 3 bowls and my husband ate two.  I had one, but then the soup was gone!  I made it with grilled cheese sandwiches.  My son already asked if I could make it again this week.  :)

Made as is, not great. I attempted to fix it and we ate it but I would only make again with the following changes.  
1. Eliminate the heavy cream. Replace with 1/2 C light cream plus 1/2 C skim milk. Not only does it taste better but it eliminates 1500 calories from the recipe. (That is a lot of calories for soup.)
2. Eliminate the sugar. Doesn't need it. 
3. Skip the baking soda (I think this might have been the cause of the "odd taste" my family kept commenting about. (I think). 
4. Add fresh basil, parsley, ground pepper and salt.

A note to novice cooks: Do not add the cold cream/milk directly to the hot soup. Either temper the cream or heat the cream slightly in the microwave and then add. Adding cold cream to hot soup causes the milk to curdle.

Great recipe! Took multiple other suggestions 1. tempered the cream into the tomato soup to prevent curdling. 2. Subbed 1/2 of the cream for milk. 3. Added a splash of vinegar and a puttanesca (Red pepper flake) mix at the end. Served it along  with bean and cheese quesadillas.  Family loved it.  Absolute goodness!!! Thanks!

The flavors are great.  It's easy to make with ingredients found in the pantry and fridge.  My main issue with it was that it's kind of heavy.  After I added the cream I regretted it.  I think next time I'll use less cream or use milk.  Or maybe just omit the dairy altogether.  I also added salt and pepper to taste which finished it nicely.

I made this soup again using the Italian style tomatoes. So good! But this time I added all the cream called for in the recipe. I still think it's too much and will use less from now on. 1-10-2014 I love this soup with a few tweaks for personal taste. I used diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Oh, the flavor the spices gave to this soup was marvelous! I added only 1/2 the sugar called for because of personal preference and might could use even less. Since I cut the recipe in half, I simmered the tomatoes for only 30 minutes. At the end of that time, I used my immersion blender but did not blend the mixture smooth. I then heated the cream in the microwave and added it very slowly while whisking into the tomato mixture. The half recipe called for 1 cup cream, but I had only 3/4 cup which was plenty. I can't believe this will serve 8-12 people. I cut the recipe in half and could have eaten all of it!

Yum, Yum, Yum! My tomato hating husband thought this was good, and my 2 yr old owned his bowl of soup like a total boss! I used butter and only added 1 tsp of sugar.

This soup is so creamy you cannot taste the tomato in it. I should have known better than to just take the recipe as is. I added a 15oz can of tomato sauce after  realizing the soup was inedible. Anyways, the soup came out absolutely delicious after adding a can of tomato sauce. It was still very, very creamy... but it actually tasted like tomato.

This was delicious! I omitted the onions, only because a family member doesnt like them. I was afraid kids wouldnt like the texture of diced tomatoes but  I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the tomatoes were after simmering. I didnt change anything else and everyone at Thanksgiving loved it! I will definitely make again and add onions next time.

This soup was delicious!  With a few adjustments, it will be a family keeper.  I used oil instead of margarine & milk instead of cream.  I added some basil for extra flavor.  And some corn starch to thicken.

This definitely needs some more tomato. I had my boyfriend taste it before adding anything extra and he said it tasted like onion soup, not tomato. I then took about 3/4 of the soup and blended it for a few seconds so there were still a few chunks of tomato. It still wasn't tomato-y enough so I also added a small can of tomato sauce - much better. I also used milk instead of cream, partially to be healthier and partially because I didn't have any cream.
We like spicy stuff so I added a few drops of Chalula after serving it up. Yum!

I made this for a Soup Supper at church.  The only change I made was to use whole milk in place of the Whipping Cream and halved the amount.  People were coming back for seconds, and then thirds.  I got lots of excellent comments.

Fantastic! I made this soup for 40 people today and it came out perfect. I did use half stewed tomatoes and half diced, vegetarian broth and 2% milk. Everyone loved the soup. Thanks for sharing.

Just made this soup fo the first time. It was easy, and has a great tomato taste. I can't see how the recipe, as written, would serve 11, as I got only about 4 servings. But the flavor was great, so it would be worthwhile to double or triple the recipe for a crowd.

6 out of 7 in my family loved this. That's impressive as I have some picky eaters. I agree that another can or 2 of tomatoes would be great. Also, I pureed the the soup prior to complete heating as one of my picky eaters hates "chunks". Delicious.

We loved this creamy tomato soup!   As usual, I made a couple substitutions after reading the other reviews. I omitted the margarine and sugar. Added lots of dry basil, black pepper, about 4-6 cloves minced garlic and 5 tablespoons diced fresh yellow onion.  We tempered the whipping cream with spoonfuls of soup so it didn't curdle and eventually added all of the whipping cream/mixed in soup to the remaining soup.  I can't wait to try with milk or half and half for a healthier version.  Thanks for this wonderful tomato soup recipe!

Very good. Used fresh tomatoes, homemade turkey broth and 1 whole onion sauteed in the butter before adding everything. Also used whole milk instead of cream. Added 1.5 chicken soup cubes for added flavor. Wish I had more leftovers!

I highly recommend this soup.  I stumbled upon the recipe when I was responsible for feeding 300 people at a church function 2 years ago.  It was a huge success!  At home I use Rotel Tomatoes with Green Chile's and it's even better but it is spicy.  If you have any frozen tomatoes from your garden add them at then end (I process with an immersion blender) and you'll get a great fresh kick!  This is a keeper!

Good recipe.  I did not add more than 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream which I thought was more than enough.  I'm not sure if I would make it again.

This was so good and easy.  I dropped a bouilion cube in the tomatoes, while simmering.  Gave it an extra layer of flavor.  Also used milk but would like to use the cream next time.  Definitely will be making this again.

I made this for a large family celebration.  Because it was for company I used real butter and the heavy cream.  Fantastic.  Impressive.  Wonderful.  Many compliments.  However, for an "everyday" soup I will still use the butter, but try whole or even 2% milk.  I did simmer the soup on the stove for nearly an hour, transfer it to crock pot for a few hours and added the cream I had warmed in the microwave about 30 min. before serving.

If you are looking for a no frills tomato soup...this is it!  I've never made homemade tomato soup, and I'm not looking any further!  I used butter instead of margarine...and I have used 2% milk to cut down on the calories, with great results!  I do run this thru the blender before adding the milk/cream!

This is restaurant quality, definitely, but to cut the fat, I use 2% milk instead.  Is delicious all the same.  If I'm making this for company, though, I'll use 15% cream or half milk, half heavy cream.  Using only heavy cream would be best, of course, but I couldn't get the fat content out of my mind.  Just by substituting milk for the cream, this recipe as a whole cuts its calories of 1320.

What a soup - so easy and so good! I cut the 2 T. margarine to 2 tsp. olive oil and used 1 cup of cream and 1 of milk. I also added 2 t. oregano and 1 tsp. basil. Serve this with shredded cheese and your family will love it!

Honeyman said this was way better than Campbells.  I used milk and butter instead of Whipping cream and added some basil, italian seasoning, and oregano.  I also only cooked it for about 20 mins.

This was good soup.  I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  I also added salt, pepper, and a garlic clove.  Next time I will not add as much sugar.  It was very sweet.  I had to add more salt and pepper to cut down on the sweetness.  I will make this again.

Awesome soup.  So easy and exactly what I was looking for, great flavor.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic (because I always add garlic to tomatoes) and some salt and pepper.  Instead of the margarine I used a couple of tablespoons of Olive Oil.

Hint -- I heated the cream in a small pot, kept checking the temp, and when it was a little higher than body temperature I added and stirred in the tomato mix by big spoonfuls to finish bringing it up to temperature.  No curdling at all.

As as South Beach dieter I plan to make this a staple, so I hope get the same results again.  Thanks so much for this recipe, its a winner in my book.

Make sure the soup base is NOT HOT when you add your cream/half and half. Needs to be luke warm so that cream can mix well.  Soup will take on a curdling look if too hot when you add cream.  I LOVE this recipe.  Made it for two gatherings and all loved it too.

Amazing! Double the recipe because it does NOT serve 11.  It was the perfect soup for a cold night with grilled havarti and sharp cheddar cheese sandwiches.  (The next time I make this, I will double everything except the cream...not because it doesn't taste good, mind you...but because my thighs are in consideration...)

I love this recipe. I use my homemade canned tomatoes or the fire roasted canned and I only use 1-1/4 cup cream. I also use my wand blender to make it thick and creamy. Everyone raves about it!

This was easy and delicious.  I used crushed concentrated tomatoes and strained the seeds.   I would reduce sugar next time as it was a little sweet. I added salt and pepper to taste.  I served this with the baked cheese sandwiches that another had suggested.  It was a great combo.

Living in Montana means enjoying 4B's famous tomato soup, but at $7 a quart, I needed a cheaper "fix"!  This soup is UNBELIVEABLE! My kids cringe at the word "tomato" but they gobbled this down, and came back for seconds.  Wonderful with toasted cheese sandwhiches, or garlic bread.

I'm not a huge tomato soup fan, but my husband requested it so I used this recipe.  He LOVED it!  I liked that it was easy to make, but I'm still not all that fond of tomato soups.  But if you are a tomato soup fan, this was a good recipe and is worth trying.

Wow - what a delicious soup! I did make *minor* adjustments to make it more diet-friendly (low-sodium crushed tomatoes, Splenda, light margarine & fat-free whipping cream)and threw in a bay leaf. This was a big hit - definite keeper!

This is replacing my old Tomato soup recipe without a doubt.  This was great!  It had a good sweetness and flavor to it- not salty like many of the tomato soup recipes I've tried.  

It pairs well with basil and I might throw some in next time, but it was great as is.

I made this with toasted cheese sandwiches and it was soooo good.
My husband who usually eats canned tomato soup with water didn't want cream or anything in it. I told him it was homemade tomato soup.
I used evaporated milk instead of cream and threw in a bit of dried basil, salt, pepper, and shredded parmesan and cheddar cheese. My husband said it was the best soup he's ever had! Thanks for the recipe!

The soup had very good flavor but it was a bit too rich for my liking without something else substantial added. Next time I'll either use half and half and also add lobster meat. Overall a very good recipe.

This tomato soup is delicious!  To lower the fat, I substitute one cup of lowfat plain yogurt and combined it with one cup of the heavy whipping cream.  Also, I blended it in the blender before mixing the soup with the cream/yogurt.  The results were superb, and it tasted even better after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days.

*Great* recipe. My partner likes this soup because it's not as tangy as others. I do sub Splenda for the sugar, though. I also use non-fat half and half and I prefer crushed tomatoes for a smoother texture. My go-to tomato soup recipe. Made with Bev's grilled ham and cheese on Allrecipes.

Very easy.  Creamy, smooth and great all around.  I reduced the amount of cream called for.  While it is good, it was losing the tomato flavors I added it.  I found 2/3 of the cream to be a batter balance.  that is a personal preference.  Wonderful recipe.  The entire family liked it.  Unusual for 3 teenage girls.

I would half the sugar it’s a little to sweet.  I blended the tomatoes in the pot with a hand blender first. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was amazing! Definitely a keeper! Amazing soup that was so silky and impressive! Make some grilled cheese with this!!

I love, love, love it. A soup this good made from canned tomatoes is a definite keeper. The first time, I made it using only half the required cream. The second time, I doubled the recipe, substituted 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of the butter, and completely omitted the cream. This way, I can enjoy my own tomato soup several times in a week without feeling like I am eating loads of unhealthy fats. Also, the soup even without cream is still creamy, and the taste is zestier which I prefer. I blend it but keep a good amount of tomato chunks in. For anyone wondering, the sugar seems like a lot, but I really think it's necessary to balance out the acidity that diced tomatoes have (since citric acid is added to canned tomatoes in the first place). A good substitute is molasses if you want to cut refined sugar. Sounds weird, but I often use molasses in tomato based soups, using the same amount I would if I were to use white sugar.

I made this as directed but I couldn't taste the tomato at all. I added two small cans of tomato paste and liked it much more. I will make it again, but will plan to add three small cans of tomato paste next time.

I will do that thing I hate and talk about how I totally changed this recipe. Bear with me. I did assign a 2-star rating based on the original recipe. 

I cooked an entire onion in the butter and then added the other ingredients. I eliminated the sugar and only added 1/4 cup cream. It was delicious! I cannot fathom using 2 cups of cream here, and it is pretty sweet even without sugar, which is why I am giving the original recipe 2 stars.  No wonder it's listed as being the creamiest tomato soup the author has ever had: this recipe is basically just cream with a hint of tomato. Yuck. However! My modifications came out delicious and I recommend them :)

This was so much better than the much loved Campbell's tomato soup of my childhood, and very easy to make.  Everyone loved it!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it still tasted delicious.

I don't typically like tomato soup, but I really liked this! My husband loved it, too (and he likes tomato soup). It was a little sweet, but I like that. I also pureed it - I like that consistency MUCH better.

Only changes: substituted large can Cento crushed tomatoes ((because I wanted smoothie soup); 1 T sugar (not 2); sautéed grated onions in butter before adding other ingredients; frozen condensed turkey stock from my freezer (not canned); 2% milk (not heavy cream) to lighten it up.. also topped my bowl with shredded Italian cheeses & minced fresh basil. Neither necessary.

This is "just" tomato soup, but it is tomato soup at its best. The soup is simple to make in small or large quantities. The taste is a perfect blend of tomato and cream without the acidity that can come from tomatoes - especially canned tomatoes. We served Campbell's tomato soup at a youth retreat one year and had very few kids selecting that option. The next year, we served this soup and garnered raves from the teenagers. We ran out of the soup.

I’ve made this recipe two ways. As is I give it 4 stars. But prefer it this way: 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped onion, with 2 tablespoon spoons of flour and garlic, browned in olive oil in my Dutch oven. I use regular milk instead of cream. I was surprised when I followed the original recipe, my husband said that it didn’t taste as good as last time.

This soup turned out good to pair with grilled cheese.  I used diced petite tomatoes, only 1 Tbs. sugar, and about 1.5 cups of cream which seemed plenty.  I was a bit confused at first that they called it "condensed" chicken broth.  I just used plain old canned chicken broth but only the 10 oz it called for not the whole can.  The liquid condensed down to tomato mush after the hour then I added the cream after it cooled and also used my immersion blender to thicken a bit.

I really liked this recipe.    I added one 15oz. can of tomato sauce.   I did use the full 2 tbsps. of sugar and felt that the recipe needed it.   I added a tsp. of Italian seasoning.    I also cut the cream to 1/4 of a cup.  I hit the whole thing with my stick blender.  It was fantastic!

This soup was excellent.  I made it for my daughter and I when she was coming over for a visit and lunch.  I will never use canned again!  Next time I will leave out 1/2 the sugar.  I did also use butter rather than margarine.

This soup was surprisingly yummy! I never enjoyed tomato soup so much! I did make 5 convenient changes. I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. I omitted the sugar and onions(neither on hand) and instead added onion powder. I normally prefer cooking with real onions but I like my tomato soup super smooth. I also omitted the baking soda. And finally, I added only 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of 2 cups. I could not believe how delicious this soup was! I am making it again tonight! When I make it this way, it yields exactly 2 nice bowls full.

It was good, I doubled the batch, but used 1/2 cream and 1/2 nonfat milk
After it cools I will run it though a strainer, I don't care for the texture.

I make this all the time.  It is very good.  I've used cream,1/2 and 1/2 or milk.  Family likes 1/2 the best. Also, I saute the onions a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. Always use the exact amount of baking soda.  I use an immersion blender to get some of the chunks out.

Delicious. I did add the following: 1/2 tsp fresh grn blk pepper and garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dried dill and 2 extra tbs butter. By the way those who think they will have the same soup using milk instead of cream, you won't. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I had a few handfuls of cherry tomatoes from my garden and they were just enough for me to have a big bowlful of this tasty recipe!  I just put the soup mixture through the sieve to remove seeds and skins after cooking and before adding cream.

This tasted just like a tomato bisque I had at a resturant. Only changes I made were adding basil to the tomato mixture and using fat free half and half  instead of heavy cream. Yummy!

This was very tasty! I'm 8 months pregnant right now, and all I want are classic soups. I made a few custom changes: I don't do milk, so I used 1 c. almond milk and 1 c. lowfat Kefir instead of cream. I used butter instead of margarine, veggie broth instead of chicken, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced. And it was still really creamy and yummy!

I didn't have cream but replaced it with 3/4c milk with 2 tbs. of butter melted in it. I also poached an egg in it to add some protein and served it with a grilled cheese sandwich. It was delicious!

I didn't know what kind of tomatoes I had (label was missing) but they ended up being super spicy. I added some tomato paste, and some nutmeg. Forgot the baking soda, but it was fine. Even spicy, it tasted fantastic!!! :-)

This was really good...next time though I'm going to do what someone else suggested on here and use only one cup of half and half instead of two cups of heavy whipping cream...it was a little too creamy for me..even one cup heavy cream probably would have been fine..oh and I will not use so much butter..I have never made soup before so this was fun and easy and good

I like mine with more onion. Use whipping cream or half and half, I only used about 3/4 of what it calls for.......add to your liking.  Garnish with a bit of basil.

I just realized that I have never rated this and have made it many times already!  There's not much to say except that it's wonderful!  I think the outcome will really depend on the quality of tomatoes that you use, though.  So either a good quality canned, or even better, fresh!

I omitted the sugar, added fresh basil, one clove garlic, a dash of cayenne pepper and one shallot.  I also substituted milk instead of the cream.  Prior to adding the milk I pureed the tomato mix ... This soup was amazing and I will definitely make it again.

Really good tomato soup!  I used a little less sugar than called for and added a cup of half & half as per one suggestion earlier.  Turned out tasting great, but unfortunately my half & half did curdle after I added it to the soup.  I think the blame was with me; I heated it up in the microwave thinking that would do it, but alas, it still curdled once it hit the hot soup.  I'll still be using the recipe again, but this time I'll heat the half & half up in a pan - just to see if that makes the difference.

I love this soup.  I usually use crushed tomatoes - add garlic. black pepper and basil.  I never use cream - sometimes a cup of skim or 2% milk - sometimes neither.  It's still really good...

I have searched for the perfect tomato soup recipe and I will not have to search anymore! I didn't have a large can of tomatoes so I used a 15 oz can diced tomatoes and a 15 oz can pureed tomatoes. It turned out wonderful. Thank you Lee Ann!

This is some seriously good soup. Only thing I did differently was to use 1 1/2 cups 1% milk and 1/2 cup half and half, since that's all I had on hand. I think next time I would definitely puree one of the cans of tomatoes; it was just a little too chunky. I served it with shredded cheddar on top... yum!

This was wonderful. The only change was used 1/2 & 1/2 and added onion powder/garlic powder, pureed some of the tomato and left some chunky. Lovely with peanut butter sandwich. 

thanks, this is a keeper.

Awesome - I don't use the full fat cream and it still tastes great.

We had this with some grilled cheese and enjoyed it.  I would like to change a few things, like using seasoned tomatoes perhaps, just to give it a little extra somthing.

Fantastic. I followed the suggestions from other reviewers and reduced the cream to 1/2 cup and it was perfect. I also added some minced garlic and dried basil (didn't have fresh). I pureed the soup halfway through to make it a bit smoother. AWESOME and easy to make!!!!!!

Incredibly good soup, and very easy to make.  I used crushed tomatoes for a smoother texture, and added in fresh garden tomatoes as well.  Reduced cream to 1 cup, but will use half and half next time or reduce cream further.

I used only 1 cup of cream and I think that may have been reduced further to 1/2 cup. I also used fresh tomatoes from the garden and blended the mixture after simmering. Great recipe! Will use again!

This is our favorite tomato soup recipe! Ever since I found it, it is the only tomato soup that I make. It has replaced my mother-in-law's recipe that she got from her mother in law~ that she's been using for over 50 years. Now, she only makes this recipe. I like to cut back on the cream, (or use 1/2 & 1/2) and i use the immersion blender & mix up 1/2 of the tomato mix to have the chunky blend, great with grilled cheese sandwiches or crusty french bread. MMM, great one to try!!!!

This tomato soup was delicious!  It was very creamy and flavorful.  I enjoyed it with the diced tomato, but my kids aren't big tomato eaters, so I ran it through the blender and they really enjoyed it.

I followed the directions and it came out great.  Changed a couple things to add just a little bit more flavor.  Used Italian Diced tomatoes and added some crushed hot peppers (didn't add how much to put in for some people it could be to hot and others not enough, add to what you feel is right) to the mix and then let it simmer for an hour.  The peppers add a nice little kick to it.  After the hour I threw it all into a blender and added the cream the way the directions state. It came out nice and creamy.  My husband refuses to eat canned tomato soup.  Thanks for the wonderful Recipe!!!

I really love this receipe and have made it several times.  I usually have to adjust the flavor a little bit, as the sugar can sometimes seem overpowering.  However, a little cider vinegar will offset it nicely.  I usually add some black pepper and maybe a touch of cayenne if I want a little extra heat.  You can also add some dried basil and get a wonderful tomato basil soup.  I also usually puree about half the soup in my food processor so that I get a nice textural variety.

Very, very good! Thought I would have some left-over, but the whole pot was gobbled up. Made just as recipe stated. Definitely a keeper. Thank you dearly for sharing.

I love this recipe but i suggest upping the tomatos to 42 oz and get the petite diced ones for smaller bites.  It is also easier to just heat the cream up in the microwave.

I've never been a fan of tomato soup so seldom have any in the pantry. When grilled cheese and tomato soup was requested for dinner, I came to AllRecipes to see what I could find. I substituted a large can of crushed tomatoes for the diced and used 1 cup of evaporated milk instead of cream and it turned out delicious but was a tad sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half. The whole family loved it. I liked it so much that I had it for lunch the next two days. This recipe changed me from a tomato soup hater into a tomato soup lover!

This is incredible!  It was a little sweet the first time I made it so I put half the sugar in the second time and it was perfect!

This was SOOOO good.  I didn't have any cream so I used evaporated milk and I used a quart of my own home-canned tomatoes.  I just chopped them up in my food processor.  It was wonderful.  Thanks LeeAnn.

This is the best tomato soup- very similar to one we had at a restaraunt in Maine.  The first time I made it, I substituted crushed tomatoes to avoid the blender and it was perfect.  The second time, I used a different brand of tomatoes and it was a little sweet. Next time I will cut down on the sugar.

WOW.. this was a very simple, very wonderful soup.  It's simple in flavor too and isn't too spicy ...  I used what was in my pantry and used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 2 fresh tomatoes instead of the can of chopped.  Once everything was cooked, I put everything in the blender and creamed it.....  I sauteed a can of crabmeat in butter and served it on the side.  My husband raved and raved and raved!!! Perfect for a winter's day!

One of my best friends suggested adding canned crab meat into the soup. It made a delicious addition! Just make sure that you rinse the crab meat prior to putting it into the soup. I will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I pureed the tomatoes as suggested & added salt, pepper, 3/4 tsp dried basil & a little parsley while simmering.  I also added 1 cup cooked white rice and a dash of cayenne pepper after adding only 1 cup of the cream (2 c seemed like too much) and simmered a few minutes longer.  It turned out very good & went great with grilled ham & cheese.  Thanks for this recipe! I will use it again.
