I gave this recipe only 3 stars because the jury is still out.  It has an interesting flavor.  The only things that keep me from rating this higher is the recipe calls for vinegar but what kind? (I used red wine vinegar) and also I think it would taste better if the onions and tomatoes were also cooked and then chilled along with the eggplant.  I will give this recipe another try with a few changes to see how I like it.

Absolutely outstanding! I cooked the onions w/ eggplant & added ~ 1/2 tsp coriander. Used cashews instead of peanuts. My husband, who is not an eggplant lover couldn't get enough.

I thought I had red chili peppers at home, but didn't, so I substituted pickled jalapenos, and that worked well.  After slicing the eggplant, tomatoes, and onion (and sweating the eggplant by salting it and letting it sit for 30 minutes, then rinsing off the salt), I chopped them up into bite-sized pieces.  Needed more butter than the recipe called for, but instead I added olive oil ... also browned the onions per other reviewers' suggestion.  Used less olive oil in the end dish (because I had used some in cooking the eggplant & onion.)  I love balsamic vinegar, so I used that - it gave the dish an ugly brown color, but tasted good.  I will make this again - would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.

Wow, this has a beautiful nutty crunch to it from the peanuts & coconut, and lots of zing from the chilies and vinegar which actually work quite well together.  The only changes I made were to substitute olive oil for the butter, baby eggplant for the eggplant (I used 5) and dessicated (dried & finely chopped) coconut for the flaked coconut - same ingredients, just different form so I guess the taste is the same!  I wondered too, which vinegar to use, & went with white.  It's delicious!

Not completely sold on this. And according to the leftovers neither were my guests. I cut the eggplant into cubes and sauteed it with the onion, adding the tomato near the end. It is the consistency of the eggplant that is a turn off. This sounded like a pickled veggie dish so I used white vinegar and let it sit overnight, adding the peanuts and coconut just before serving.

Excellent!  I took the 'advice' from a reviewer here and changed the peanuts to cashews-good!
