If you rate this on ease and taste, it's definitely a 5.  That being said, I took the liberty of making some changes that I feel helped the rating (if I had not done these things, I'm not sure I would have given it a 5): I used small baby red potatoes chopped up instead of hashbrowns, substituted ground turkey sausage instead of ham, and added lots of chopped carrots and celery.  Oh my goodness, it was so tasty I have just finished my 3rd bowl today.  :) Thanks for this recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe. The only changes I made was to substitute the ham with turkey Kielbasa. I added carrots and cubed potatoes instead of shredded. Also I used can milk mixed with water.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was great... it was very tasty, and made enough for me to take into work for lunch for a couple days too. It was also so easy to just throw all the ingredients in the slow-cooker and not worry about it.  I did make several changes.. I used cream of potato instead of cream of mushroom (didn't have the cream of mushroom at home); less frozen corn (one cup), more hash browns (two cups); I only put in half of an onion, only because I'm not a huge fan of onions; no ham; lastly, I added chili powder because I wanted to add a little kick.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to make this recipe late in the day and decided to cook it on the stove instead of in the crockpot. It turned out great! Very tasty and flavorful. I followed others' suggestions of adding more potatoes, and I used seasoning blend instead of chopped onions. The extra potatoes may also have solved the problem others had of it being too thin.

Added a few spices as suggested by others, and replaced ham with store-bought meatballs that I'd browned with the onions before adding to crock pot. It was gobbled up immediately by entire extended family, some who returned for third and fourth helpings!

I enjoyed this recipe.  You taught me something!  I like the idea of adding frozen hashbrowns instead of peeling and cutting potatoes.  It is just as good and a whole lot less work.

This was great with a few changes.  I added a bay leaf and some garlic and skipped the dried parsely because I didn't have any.  I about doubled the amount of potatoes (I used diced southern style hash brown potatoes) because after it was done it was too thin, so I added more potatoes to thicken it up.  I also used turkey kielbasa instead of the ham and added dried basil and red pepper to taste.  It was great!

My boyfriend almost had a fit when he first tasted this. Then he looked at me, gave me a big hug and said he loved me. I think he liked it.  I love making this dish. It's so easy and relatively cheap. My kids (3 and 5) inhaled it and I keep craving it every day.  The only thing I did differently was used twice the amount of hash browns. It made the consistency perfect. Next time I'm making a triple batch!

YUM!  I added mushrooms and a little seasoned salt.  My family gobbled this up, and we are not soup/chowder people.

This is an OK recipe.  It is easy and quick to make but the consistency wasn't quite what I think of when I think of corn chowder.  Just wasn't thick enough.  Maybe next time I would throw in another can of creamy soup.

5 stars based on my changes. My husband loves this! He recently returned from a year long deployment to Afghanistan. The weather was turning cold here and I love to cook soup. He isn't the biggest fan of eating soup all the time and told me about this corn chowder he had eaten in Afghanistan. He talked about how much he enjoyed eating it out of a paper cup on the cold nights. I decided to search for the soup he spoke of. I came across this and decided I would attempt to make the soup he raved about. I had no idea what corn chowder tasted like or should even look like. I did make a few changes to this recipe. I did not use a slow cooker because it was late in the afternoon when I came across the recipe. I used 2 cans of cream style corn, 2 cans cream of mushroom, 2 cups frozen hash browns southern style diced potatoes, 8 oz package of John Morrell diced ham, 2 cups of milk, salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder to taste; I omitted the frozen corn, onion, and dried parsley. My husband said it tastes just like it tasted in Afghanistan.  He took left overs to work to share with his guys (who were also deployed to Afghanistan) and they all love it!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Delicious, like the soup at the restaurant Cosi but better. I added 1 pound of chicken breast and extra corn. Accidentally used cream of chicken and mushroom instead. Used 2 cups of fat free milk and half cup of cream (left over, didn't want to waste). Next time will use all fat free milk. This is very rich, did not add salt or pepper.

Tasty and easy. I left out celery because we don't like it. We added some cheddar cheese after it was dished out.

I love the ease, convenience and flavors of this soup.  It was easy to assemble in the slow cooker in the morning with ingredients I usually have on hand.  And when I got home 6 hours later, the soup was hot and ready for dinner.  The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup because that is the kind I had in the pantry.  Kids and husband both enjoyed this hearty soup on a cold night.

Amazing!! I gave this recipe to my sister in law and she's  given it now to her mother in law! We make it with precooked bacon. Oh and if you have a hot  slow cooker it won't take as long to cook.

I enjoyed this soup...more than anyone else in my family. Your really have to like corn. I substituted smoked turkey sausage for the ham. Added a little extra garlic. This reheated well for lunch throughout the week.

Oh my is this soup good! I couldn't stop tasting it as it was cooking! The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of minced garlic, perfect! This made a lot more than I thought (good thing, too) will be eating for lunches and freezing for later. Thanks!

I did make a few changes. Instead of hash browns I chopped up 1 cup of potatoes and used potato soup instead of mushroom. I added 3 tsps of  minced garlic too. Every thing else stayed the same.

This was a great slow cooker chowder.  The only change I  made was I used two cups of southern style hash brown potatoes instead of 1 cup of shredded  as that is what I had on hand and a can of condensed cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom.  The consistency was perfect for a chowder and the flavor great.  Love this recipe and will make it again.  I did not adjust the seasonings but I did saute the onions in the butter before adding to the crock pot.

Amazing chowder! I made this almost exactly as-is, just added 1 tsp of chili powder as another reviewer recommended and to alleviate the problem of curdling milk, I reduced my amount to 1 1/4 cups and mixed it with a can of cream of potato soup. Definitely worth 5 stars! Husband thinks it's worth 4 stars because he would have preferred chunks of real potatoes instead of hash browns (I used cubed ones). This will be great for those cold wintery Canadian nights! Thanks so much for posting Mary!

4-1/2 stars.  Good flavor - I've never had corn chowder before and it reminded me alot of ham & beans - except with corn.  Everyone enjoyed this recipe and we thank you for sharing it!

Great base recipe and so easy! changes I made, which made it 5-stars for simplicity and taste are: I increased the milk to 3 cups and the frozen corn to 2 cups. To the recipe i added 2 celery stalks, 2 carrots, and 4 med. red potatoes (partly cooked in the microwave, skin on), chopped into small pieces. Instead of parsley I used 1.5 tsp of oregano. Oh...and I added a few dashes of hot sauce and omitted the butter. Great recipe!!

Ugh. It's been my understanding for many years that milk in the Crock pot is a big no-no. Seeing the high rating this recipe received, however, I decided to give it a try. It seems that my understanding was correct: milk will separate! Imagine my surprise when I lifted the lid this evening and found a watery curdled mess--after only five hours on low, no less! I don't know what everyone else here did differently, but this is one recipe that did not appeal.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.   I did add some carrots and set a bowl full of bacon bits on the table for people to add.  It was well received at the soup luncheon.

So good and so easy. I did sub cream of potato soup for the cream of mushroom. I also used two cans of creamed  corn and three cups of hashbrowns. That seemed to thicken it up since some people said it was more like soup than chowder. Mine cooked in four hours. Any longer and I think it would have started to stick to the bottom of the slow cooker. Definately a simple soup.

This was just okay.  It was good -- but not good enough to make again.  A little more flavor might do it.

This became an instant family favorite. I did modify a bit based on what my family will eat and what I had on hand. I used bacon instead of ham, canned corn instead of frozen, and onion powder instead of a chopped onion (my husband doesn't like onion chunks in food).

I thought it was just OK but my husband loved it. it seemed as thought it needed something, it was a little bland. I took the advice from others and doubled the hashbrowns to 2 cups. I am really glad I did, I honestly could have used more. I used chicken breasts instead of ham. And only used 1/2 of an onion instead of a whole. We arent big onion eaters. I am also glad I did that. I think if I make again I will try a little garlic powder or vary with other ingredients to help flavor it a little more.

Pretty good!  I only changed 2 things, I added 3 cups of frozen hashbrowns and bacon instead of ham because that is what I had on hand.  Tastes extra good the next day.

This was good, it was better served with shredded cheese and green onion on top.  I skipped the ham and used 2 cubed russets instead of the hashbrowns.  Also I didn't have time to get the slow cooker going before I had to leave for work so I just threw it all in a pot on the stove top when I got home and it turned out just fine.  Just be sure to stir frequently or it will stick. Update, I made it again on the stove top and added 1 cup turkey kielbasa (I don't care for ham).  It's probably the best soup I've ever made. 2nd update: I doubled the recipe and tried to make this in the slow cooker and the milk curdled, the potatoes stuck to the sides and burnt.

This soup was easy and delicious. I changed a couple things. I mixed one cup of half and half with the milk, added approx. 1 cup more of the shredded potatoes, one can of regular corn and some celery. When the soup was close to being finished, I thicken it a little more by adding a mixture of 1/2 cup of milk and 1 T of corn starch. We really enjoyed the soup. Thanks for this recipe.

I've made this twice now - both times to rave reviews.  No substitutions the first time.  The 2nd time, I didn't have hash browns so I used O'Brien potatoes.  Came out great.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Tasted good - I added extra cup of hash browns for more substance. Not sure if I'd make this again - seems I could have gotten the same results by making on stove - no need to cook on low for 6 hours.

The consistency was way off to be a chowder... I ended up mashing up a white sweet potato and adding it to get the proper consistency... also more corn and another cup of hasbrown potatoes. Then it was good. Can't really give a recipe 5 star rating when you  have to modify so much!

Took this to an office potluck & gave out the recipe to several co-workers because it was so yummy!  I tripled the hash browns (3 cups) as suggested in some other comments, and when I make it at home, I'm going to go for 4 cups. Definitely a keeper & so easy to make.

WOW! Is all I can say. I love it the way it is and my own way. I didn't have cream of mushroom one day so I added cream of potato as well as a smoked ham that gave it that smokey flavor. I have also used canned milk to give it some sweetness. This is one that will stay in my recipe box! THANK YOU!

I was not crazy about this soup. I don't care for creamed corn, but I thought mixed together it would be Ok. It still tasted like the canned stuff. I added a cup of chicken broth to thin it a bit, and it helped a bit. If I make it again, I won't use creamed corn, just frozen corn and I will use southern hashbrowns instead of the shredded kind. The shredded kind almost dissolved in the soup.

I used whole milk and an extra handful of potatoes then ended up thinning it a bit with skim milk.  Made it in the crock pot on high for about 3.5 hrs.  Be sure to chop the onion fine since they were the rate limiting ingredient in getting this cooked. Used smoked chicken/apple sausage and put it in at the end to save the flavor of it. Delicious. Will use 2% milk next time.Thanks!

Very easy and fast to prepare.  After gathering all of the ingredients I realized I was out of corn so I substituted carrot, broccolli, cauliflower medley.  I also added an extra cup of potatoes to thicken.  I was surprised at how good this turned out....I was leary of the milk boiling and separating but the potatoes seem to help keep it creamy. I am looking forward to trying it with corn! LOL

I added chopped red potatoes instead of hashbrowns, and used 2 cans of cream of potatoe instead of cream of mushroom.  I also added carrots and halfed the amount of onion.  Added paprika, celery salt, and a little chili powder.  Also added some extra milk.  And I used turkey sausage instead of ham.  This turned out great, will make again for sure!

Pretty good. Flavor was real good, but chowder seemed too soupy and not quite thick enough.  Low cal though and quite tasty with lots of vitamins.

This was a very tasty soup.  The only changes I made were to add a small can of green chili and I used smoked sausage instead of ham.  This will be the last time I make a soup that contains milk in the crockpot.  By the time the soup was cooked the milk had separated.  I did use fat free milk thinking it would help.

I have made this recipe a hundred times!! My daughter begs for it and I usually have to double the ingredients for the 4 of us.  My only comment is that it really doesn't need 6 hours, 4 is plenty - at least in my slow cooker.  Love the ease of this recipe!

omg! this is the best corn chowder! followed the directions except for a few changes based on what i had... 4 ears fresh corn, cream of celery soup, canadian bacon and 3 potatoes cubed. i did keep it on high for two hours then low for another 3 to get the potatoes done and then i did add some water and flour to get it to the right thickness. yum! this will be a favorite that i make again! UPDATE: the second time i made this i had the mushroom soup, but only had bacon and a few thin slices of ham. did not have any parsley but did have fresh cilantro. it turned out awesome! what a great mix!

I preferred to double the recipe and use large chunks of fresh potatoes and, of course, needed to cook longer( on high for 8+ hours). The one thing I will change, next time... is the cr. of mushroom soup. I didn't like the woodsy flavor of the mushrooms with the sweet creamed-corn flavor (even though I do love mushrooms in just about everthing). I will use cr. of celery is all, instead. And, it needed some more seasoning other than just salt & pepper. I  choose to add (2 tsp)chicken boullion. Just some preferences... It's a delcious recipe for corn chowder and I  will use this recipe again. Just will change a little for our tastes.

I threw all of the ingredients, plus a can of cream of potato and a little extra milk, into the crock pot before I left for work this morning and came home to a great smell. The chowder was delicious. I will certainly make this again.

too much butter for my taste. Next time will add more milk/potatoes to lessen.

Oh. My. Goodness.  This was fantastic.  I had to make a couple changes based on what I had on hand, but I'm sure it would have rated 5 stars if I had been able to follow it exactly.  I used half & half instead of milk and smoked sausage instead of ham.  Thanks for such a decadent comfort food recipe!

I've made this many times and I always love it. Only difference when I make it is I use cheddar cheese soup, a couple cups of shredded pepperjack and sharp cheddar, and I stir in a little sour cream at the end. This is also good with chopped chicken breast or bacon bits.
If you double this, you can make this 
a weekly meal, rounded out with a tossed green and a nice hearty bread. You can make it a little kickier with a bit of Frank's. TIP: Here we have Grocery Outlet
which is a discount grocery store where you can stock up on cheap pantry items. Most of the ingredients for this soup I get on the cheap from there and this is an extremely cheap meal to make. This recipe is great for large families where you need to feed a bunch on a small budget.

Great soup. Easy to make.  I try to incorporate one or two vegetarian recipes each week.  I omitted the ham and it was still a big hit.  My soon to be brother in law went back for seconds!

This recipe was great! It was very tasty and super easy to throw together. I actually made it on the stove top because of time but it still turned out great. I have made it twice now. The first time wasn't quite as thick as I would have liked so I made a rue with 2tbls of flour then added everything and it was perfect! I took it to a church function and it got rave reviews. Thank you for the great soup!

This was a really great corn chowder but I did make some modifications.  Instead of ham I added two cans of chicken breast.  I also added a block of fat free cream cheese to give it a creamier texture.  For a little kick I added 1/8 tsp of red peppter.  It was perfect!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and I liked it. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating from me is because it is also a bit watery and had the tendency to separate in the crockpot.

Everybody loved this chowder. I took a tip from another reviewer and used turkey sausage instead of ham, which worked wonderfully. I also used diced potatoes instead of frozen hash browns. I did not ad any salt since the soup and creamed corn is salty enough for us.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of ham I used chicken breast cut into chunks. It turned out great and we will definitely make this one all winter long.

Even my son loved this chowder!  It was delicious.  We had it with biscuits.  What a great meal on a chilly night.  The only substitution I made was I used cream of onion because my son doesn't like mushrooms.

I make this soup ALL the time because my whole family DEVOURS it.  I have experimented with the recipe a little bit and found that I like it most when I make it this way:  use sausage instead of ham (I use link sausages, not ground sausage), use heavy whipped cream instead of most of the milk, and omit the onion (simply because I don't like them much).  Easy comfort food meal and it always gets raves!

Very good, but not 5-star worthy as written.  I added about 2 cups of the frozen hash browns and used a meaty ham bone, which gave this great flavor.  I also couldn't figure out why the 2 T. butter was needed, so instead I used it to saute the onion before adding it to the crockpot.

This is quite good! We don't eat red meat so I used turkey kielbasa instead of ham, and reduced-fat condensed soup. Definitely worth the effort. I did find the end result a bit runny (thus the four stars) but added a half a cup of instant mashed potatoes, which thickened it right up. I used cubed red potatoes instead of hash browns, though (had one, not the other), and I'm wondering now if the hash browns would have dissolved into the soup more, and done the same thing as the instant mashed potatoes. Will try it as written next time. Thanks!

I also changed this recipe around a little. I didn't want to use ham, so I substituted chicken and I found Jimmy Dean hash browns with bacon so I used that. I think that it would have been better with fresh potatoes, though.

I made this as written and we all loved it. Next time I make it though I think I will use some of the other people's ideas and put some seasoning salt and garlic in it as per our family's taste. It was a little thinner than I was thinking so I will probably add more potatoes as well but for a quick, easy and tasty recipe this was good.

I made a few alterations as suggested by other reviewers.  I used cubed red potatoes instead of shredded.  And I substituted some cut up farmers sausage for the ham, because that's what I had on hand.  Didn't have parsley so I used cilantro, I don't think it added much of anything to the flavour of the soup.

I thought this soup was very tasty!  Unfortunately at the 3 hour mark I checked and my potatoes were still hard and I panicked and turned the crock pot to high.  I think that was a mistake because the soup curdled a bit.  Won't make that mistake next time.  Will definitely make again, and experiment with other add ins.

This was delicious. I accidentally omitted the butter, and it was fine. I also left out the ham and replaced it with bacon and chicken. I used a whole bag of frozen corn and added some Lipton onion soup mix, red pepper flakes, and a Tsp of minced garlic. Delicious!

I made this for a wine party I had and everyone loved it!!! I did add Turkey kielbasa and instead of the hashbrowns I used new potatoes. I cooked it on the stove top for a couple hours on medium/low and turned out perfect! Even better the next day! Making it again this weekend :)

I made this last night and it was a huge hit.  I made a few changes to the receipe.  I used chicken instead of ham cubes and added bacon pieces to the finished product.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream on mushroom because I have some family members who don't like mushrooms.  Instead of a chopped onion I added a tsp of onion powder and a tsp of season salt.

Great Chowder!! I added a few things just to thicken it.  Doubled the shredded hash browns, and also added an extra can of creamed soup.  ( cream of chicken, because that is what I had on hand in the pantry)  also I added chopped carrots. YUMMY

My family loves this recipe for fall or winter days.  Super easy and super tasty.  I've made it exactly as written, but my family prefers fresh potatoes instead of frozen ones, so I just dice up a few potatoes and throw them in.  Delicious!

I used diced kielbasa and fat free half and half. It was still a little thin and bland, so I added some instant mashed potato flakes, chicken base and chives. Green onions would probably work well also, either in the soup or as a garnish on each serving. Hearty recipe for fall and winter.

This recipe was fabulous...but I admittedly made a lot of changes! I put 1 can of corn in the blender, with juice. (I couldn't find creamed corn at the grocery.) I added garlic and quite a bit of cayenne, a bay leaf and a pinch of basil. I added frozen mixed veggies in addition to a bag of frozen corn. I used unsweetened soy milk in place of milk and added about 3 tbsp of flour.  Came out amazing. I think without my additions it might not have been so delicious.

Thought this recipe was fantastic, but I did use a lot of the suggestions from other reviews (extra veggies, garlic, extra cream of mushroom to compensate for extra veggies) and chopped potatoes.  I thought the potatoes added a lot to the texture and I am glad I didn't opt for the frozen stuff.  Served it to our dinner guests and everyone went for seconds.

added the ingredients to the slow cooker the night before, left it outside on the (enclosed) porch (it's the middle of the winter), and turned it on to cook the next morning. used frozen, squared hash browns instead of shredded, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was simple and delicious!

Made this chowder for a soup pot-luck meal with extended family and everyone raved.  When they found out how easy it was everyone wanted the recipe.  The four star rating is based on the ease of the recipe and the response of all of the others who tried it.  I personally thought it was only average from a taste perspective, but considering the amount of effort it was a tasty return for the time invested.

This is an amazing chowder.  So easy and very impressive.  My slow cooker cooks hot so it was ready in 3 hours (cooking on low).  My friend even asked for the recipe after trying it.

So easy to make.  I used turkey sausage instead of ham, and I only had a little bit of milk left so I made up the difference with soy milk without any distortion of taste.  I had no problems with the milk separating...make sure you have your crockpot set on low.

This was actually quite tasty! I'd make one note, though-larger chunks of ham kind of got a little mushy and discolored after sitting in the crock pot for a while. Didn't affect the taste much, but I'll be using smaller diced ham next time. Very tasty considering how easy it is to make.

This wasn't bad.  My only wish was that it was thicker.  It's more soupy than chowdery.  Next time I will thicken and adjust some spices...but overall it was good!

This was pretty good though a little sweet, I guess from the corn. The only change I made was instead of the hash browns, I shredded a potato. I had to keep adding salt and pepper to counter act the sweetness.

This Chowder was very easy to make and turned out great. After reading some of the reviews I chose to use baby red potatoes instead of hash browns and bacon instead of ham.

This is good soup. Very easy in the slow cooker.  I didn't have frozen hashbrowns, so just threw some dehydrated shredded potatoes that come in a big can.  I did add a little cayenne pepper for just a little spice.  I did have to salt it a little to our taste.

This soup was so good. But, I did omitted the onions and ham since I didnt have any, and was worried it might not have enough flavor. But... it was great. It was runny and I like my chowders thicker. Other than that, it was so yummy. EDIT: I have made this soup numerous times now and I like to up the hash browns and cut back on the frozen corn. The hash browns thicken up the soup nicely. I also only add parsley as a garnish when time to serve.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup. I made a few changes: Added spicey sausage, omited the creamed corn, used cream of celery inplace of the cream of mushroom. It freezes well also.

This recipe is great!  I use any kind of leftover meat (ham, turkey sausage, even ground beef) to add flavor (and clean out the fridge).  I start it in the morning before work and by the time I get home dinner is done!

This is great!  Its so easy!  the only changes i make are that I add more hasbrowns and i use the small cubed ones intstead of shredded; I use canned corn instead of frozen, and near the end of cooking i mix some flour and water and then add it to the soup to thicken it up.  Its great! my family eats it up!

This needed a little more spice. My husband suggested andouille or kiebasa sausage to give it a little kick which would have made it a "5". 
Because of food allergies, I made several substitutions: original flavor low fat soy milk for milk, because I didn't have any hash-browns, I use 7 mini potatoes (diced), no onions (allergy), 2 Tb milled flax seed for margarine;

YUMMY TIMES 10!!!  I can't believe how easy this soup was.  I made it today for tomorrow night and the boys wanted to start in on it today.  This will be a regular for my household!  Everyone I know will be alerted to this recipe. I am thinking of ways to "tweak" this recipe to make clam chowder. THANKS TIMES 10!!!

This is an inexpensive meal for  your family.  It was pretty good but could be better.  I ended up adding a block of cream cheese and some red pepper flakes at the end.  It seemed like it was missing something and needed to be a bit more creamy for a chowder.

Very good. This was so easy that my husband made it. :-). We don't care for ham, so we skipped it. Next time, I would add more potatoes (we used the cubed hash browns instead of shredded)
