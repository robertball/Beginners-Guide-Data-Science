This is SO delicious! I decided not to rinse out the can with water as I didn't want to dilute the sauce. Otherwise I stayed true to the ingredients. I cooked the sauce in my instant pot to cut down on the cook time. I think it's best to use a microplane grater for the cheese because using any other style of grater and the cheese doesn't melt as smoothly.

I don't often write reviews.  I  had to!!  I was lucky enough to eat at Gino in its heyday.  Often and the meal always started with this magnificent dish.  Stick with the original recipe (not too heavy handed on the onions.  Its sweet enough.)  Any great dish has a very distinctive after taste and this is precisely that.  Now officially in my  go to meals and sauce recipes.  THANK YOU!!!!!

Very tasty, like all of Chef John's recipes!  Unfortunately, I did not have fresh basil.  Would've been much better with it, I'm sure.  Still, excellent sauce.  Served with italian sausage , salad, and bread.

This was very good. I blended 5 fresh, Roma tomatoes instead of canned. I forgot to add the water, so I added it after the simmering. The sauce was just enough to coat the rigatoni, so I'll double it next time. I really appreciated making my own sauce and not using a jar. My husband was tempted to have a third helping.

Made no changes, only doubled the recipe to feed the whole family. This is an absolutely delicious, rich sauce. One of the best I've ever tasted. Rave reviews, although this will be something to make on special occasions only since it's obviously not on the healthy side ;).

6-8 oz of rigatoni is the max amount of pasta for the sauce. 6 oz is better for 4 servings. Otherwise it’s perfect.

Made recipe per ingredient list and instructions but was 1/2 way short on parm cheese.  Recipe was ok but not even close to the best red sauces I've had.  When you add that much butter and cheese to anything it's going to be yummy.  If I make it again I'm going to add some hot peppers to give it some life.

This sauce was delicious. My husband (who usually hates "sauce") said it was fantastic.

I actually chopped up and cooked up some Aiello's (??) Italian Style chicken sausage that I added right at the very end to the sauce. I used a large pinch of the red pepper flakes.

I will definitely be making this again.

This is fantastic.  One of those meals I just couldn't stop eating.  No rigatoni so I subbed in penne (by weight).

Great by itself for 4 or a side dish for 8.

One reviewer suggested not adding the water. Its safe to add it as the 34-60 min of low heat cooking will thicken the sauce/all the water will evaporate.

Don't wait.  Try this ASAP!

This was absolutely fabulous! I simmered the sauce with a small piece of parmesan rind and used freshly grated to the pasta once it was plated. Perfection.

Delicious and easy to make!!! I used a little more garlic and a mixture of Parm and Romano. Would recommend a side of spinach and mushrooms cooked in olive oil and garlic :)

Absolutely love this sauce, it’s all I use now with all of my Italian dishes. Followed recipe exactly.  I do use the best fresh parmigiana cheese I can afford, it does make a difference.

I make this sauce (just Step 1) weekly. Add extra hot pepper flakes and very important to use La Bella San Marzano tomatoes. Altho not the intent, just the sauce is AMAZING! Thanks Chef John

Dear wonderful Chef John. I made this for dinner last night and did it exactly as you posted it in the recipe and video. The only change I made was to remove the amount of sauce I personally like from the pan and put it in another pan to dress my pasta because I prefer my pasta with less sauce (in comparison to most Americans) and it was absolutely delicious. I have made this before but I did not let it cook as long and that was the true "secret" for me. Wonderful as usual. Thanks.

Added Spicy Italian Sausage Meatballs and didn't clean out the can with the 1/2 cup of water.  It was delicious!!

I love this recipe for when I don't have the time to cook my go-to bolognese! It's relatively quicker and much more hands-off. In my opinion, it's nothing life changing, but it's a good recipe to have in my arsenal.

Delicious and oh so decadent.  Used dried basil as didn't have fresh and might cut butter to 2T next time but it is absolutely wonderful as is.

I left out the red pepper flakes and doubled everything else.  Delish!
