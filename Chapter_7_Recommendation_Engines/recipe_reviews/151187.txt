This was fantastic!  We had a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving, so we had tons of leftovers and were looking for what to do with them.  I doubled the recipe, added more garlic, fresh tomatoes, and a red pepper for color, also a bag of frozen mixed veggies and we added the turkey carcass and cooked it with the lid on.  Cooked it for an hour or so, then it was even better the next day.   Didn't need any salt or pepper.  The tomato juice and chicken stock are salty.  Wonderful soup, more like a stew!

Outstanding! Lots of flavors come together for a very satifying soup with just a little "zing". Family loved it.

I thought this was very good, mildly spicy,  and easy to make. I used turkey thigh (skin off) from our local German market, yellow pepper because that was what I had on hand, and Pace picante sauce, medium heat. It is  an excellent basic recipe which I will make again. Thank you, Ross B.

This was a very quick and easy soup to make.  I added an extra cup of turkey and about 1/4 cup of buffalo sauce marinade.  Before adding the buffalo sauce it just tasted like the vegetable juice, the buffalo sauce added a sweet zing to the soup.  I loved this soup and served it with focaccia bread - delicious!

This is by far my favorite turkey soup recipe.  I don't usually put the beans in just to save myself some calories but I have in the past and its good both ways.  I usually make a larger portion and also add jalapenos instead of bell peppers, tomato sauce instead of juice, and cilantro.  Goes well with shredded cheese and tortillas!!

Will make again as I have made it three times now. Used broth I had cooked the carcass of a smoked turkey in. About 2/3rds of the 2 cups. the rest turkey broth, regular left over turkey, left over corn from another meal and some tomatoes I had in the fridge.  Also added some cilantro. About the best yet.  Served it with corn chips

This was a very good base to start with. I didn't think that it was spicy enough. As written  it mostly just tasted like tomato juice. I added some sriracha, a dash of chili powder, an extra half clove of garlic and cilantro, and it turned out delicious.
