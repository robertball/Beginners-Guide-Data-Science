This was excellent! I added extra 2 tsp. cornstarch and 1/2 c. milk to make enough to fill pie. Another reviewer said it was very thick. So by using just a bit more cornstarch and extra milk it was perfect and cut really neat slices. Cornstarch is unique in the way that when you bring to a hard boil; than boil for 1 min longer the filling is perfect. If you overcook it, it will go back to thin!!!I made this for my coffee group and they gave it 10 stars!

I made the pie according to the directions, but did also increase the corn starch by 2 tsp. and the milk by 1/2 cup, as several cooks suggested. The quantity that resulted was the perfect amount for a 9" pie shell. The directions do not mention how long to stir, and for those of you who will make this pie in the future, you will be stirring constantly for at least 15 to 19 minutes, before the filling gets thick. It is important to stir constantly as the filling could burn. The flavor was a delicious chocolate flavor, and I topped the pie with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I hope you all will try this pie; you will not be disappointed.

I had not made a chocolate pie for years.  I do make instant chocolate pudding once in a while, but forget the instant stuff now!!  This recipe was smooth, firm and very choclate-y!  It thickens up quickly.  Keep stirring and watch the heat!  I think I'll mix up the dry ingredients, sugar, corn starch, flour, salt . . . to make it even quicker next time.  Measure the cornstarch and flour carefully because you wouldn't want it any thicker.

I made this pie several years ago and my guests have requested again this Christmas!  It is rich and chocolaty.  One reviewer said it didn't set, that's because she didn't cook it enough (a full boil is a boil that doesn't stop when stirred). Thanks for this great recipe.  This is the only choc. cream pie recipe I use!

Wow, this was amazing. My husband loves chocolate cream pie and the only kind I have ever made is the pudding-in-the-box kind. He said this was the best chocolate pie he has ever had. It turned out super rich and chocolatey and set up perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly and the results were wonderful. Great recipe!

This is my one and only Chocolate Cream Pie Recipe. Family and friends rave about this and describe it as "chocolate decadence". I double the ingredients to make a really thick, full pie. Make sure you boil for 1-2 minutes after boiling starts. It will thicken up nicely for you. Definitely Five Stars. You won't be disappointed!

This chocolate pie tasted heavenly!  I don't know what it is "different" about this recipe, compared to the old fashioned chocolate cream pie that I usually make, but this was more fudge-like.  I will definitely make it many more times!  I did not alter the recipe at all.

I will look no further for a chocolate cream pie recipe.  The chocolate flavor of this pie is phenomenal!  Fudgy and rich, and holds up very nicely.  I accidentally added too much milk the first time, so I was 'forced' to double the recipe.  The filling amount was perfect for 2 9-inch (Pillsbury) crusts.  This is what I will do from now on as it is too delicious to only make one!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was easy to make and set up nicely. It "turned out" which can sometimes be a problem with this kind of pie, so I was happy with that.

The flavor was quite good. I personally did not like it as much as my children. They raved and ate several slices. I found the texture to be a tad grainy and maybe a bit rich. But, I was definitely in the minority. 

I will probably make this again,  though I might use a different pie crust. The crust did not hold up so well the next day.

This was very good. I think next time i'll add just a bit more cornstarch (it stood up well, but i'd like it even a bit firmer,) and maybe some unsweetened cocoa powder.  I put it in an oreo pie crust which was a huge success!

Not bad!  It's very rich.  I only used 1 c. sugar because another reviewer mentioned that it was too sweet, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the eggs whites to make meringue and popped it in the oven for 10 minutes.  I was finished preparing the entire pie, including making and baking the crust and meringue in less than an hour.  What more can you ask for?!?  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was a little too sweet for me.  Not what I expected at all.  My family agreed it was just "okay".  I think it's just personal taste as we are used to the pudding and pie filling flavor which is more chocolatey, and less sweet and fudgy. That said, the filling does set up very nicely and allows you to cut beautiful firm slices that look nice on the plate without falling apart.  I used a stabilized whipped cream for the top and that worked perfectly - keeps for days without breaking down. One tip: when covering the filling with plastic wrap to let it cool without a "crust" forming on the top, spray the plastic wrap with a little Pam and then wipe with a paper towel.  Place the sprayed side down onto the filling pressing it right onto the filling.  That way, when removing it after it cools, none of the filling sticks to the plastic wrap.

Love this recipe!  Taste is outstanding, and it couldn't be easier to throw together.  I did as suggested previously and doubled the cornstarch and added an extra 1/2 cup milk so my pie would be fuller, and it set up and turned out great!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  The pudding part alone, I am thinking of using for other purposes......LOL

I made this with 2 cups of milk and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and it filled my 9.5 inch pie crust perfectly. I made it for mothers day for the family and everyone raved about it.

Good Golly Miss Molly!!  I have made a lot of chocolate pies in my day, but this takes the cake!!  My dear mother passed away in Sept., and I was feeling like I wanted to make something she used to make often, I went searching for her recipe and I could not find it..I kind of got "panicky" then I started my search here. Anyway, this is better than my mom's..it's hard to say that, but true. We always made ours with graham cracker crusts and whipped cream on top, that's the way my daddy liked it.  Well, I wish he was still around because he would of loved this. It's just simply the best chocolate pie I've ever tasted. And soooo simple to put together.  The old man agreed..he kept raving about it. So...please make this, you will not be disappointed. I'm going to make it for our "foodie" friends next week...I can hear them now!!

This was the pie of choice for our New Year's Day gettogether and it isn't going to make it to the party! I made this yesterday AM (New Year's Eve),  allowing a little more cornstarch and milk to make enough to fill a deep dish pie crust, topped it with meringue and there is one tiny slice left in the fridge.  Texture was creamy, chocolatey rich and as noted by another reviewer, it "presented" well as it didn't fall apart from the pie plate to the dessert plate! There's just something totally unappetizing about a pie that ends up as a glob on your plate. This is a lovely pie and one I'd be happy to serve at any occasion, or for no occasion at all!  Delicious. Thanks Nancy!!

Not bad but my mum's recipe is better! :P
Also--what in the heck--there is no explanation on how to make the meringue topping! I had to search on Allrecipes for one that explained that because I've never made a meringue pie topping before, just regular meringues! So if you got stuck like I did search on allrecipes for 
"Chocolate Meringue Pie" and read the instructions in the second half of the recipe about how to make the topping. Also be verrry careful when you are stirring the chocolate pie filling on high heat. I hate how recipes like these say "boil" because even though it may be at boiling temperatures, it's not water, and you won't see the bubbling on the surface. The mixture will be burning on the bottom if you do see bubbles somehow, so make sure to watch it carefully. As soon as it starts to feel "thick" and resists you stirring it, immediately turn down the heat or turn it off completely. The residual heat may be enough to finish cooking it, especially if you've added sufficient cornstarch. Also if you don't have semi sweet chocolate, you can make your own homemade by using 1 tablespoon of butter + 3 tablespoons cocoa powder for each 1 oz of semi sweet chocolate. Melt the butter first in a measuring cup then mix in the cocoa powder, then add this combo to the egg and sugar mixture on the stove. Work quickly or it will burn! My first try had a few little lumps in it, probably from too high heat.

Good luck in the kitchen!

Lives up to it's name... this is a thick, rich, chocolate "fudgy" pie. Absolutely delicious! only variations I made was using half & half in place of reg. milk (makes for a smoother, richer pie)... & also combined the flour & cornstarch together in a cup, added just enough water to make a thin paste, then added this to the liquid mixture of milk/eggs. This eliminated any lumps. I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe off of this site & it balanced out the sweetness of the filling really well.  Be forewarned: this is a thick, rich pie... but in my opinion, with the homemade pie crust,  it wasn't too sweet... and oh, so good when you're craving something chocolatey! This is definitely a keeper!
Edited to add: this is my "go to" recipe now for chocolate pie! I've made it dozens of times & have found that we like it best with a regular egg white meringue topping. I also use canned milk when out of half & half and it's just as good! (Carnation, NOT condensed) If you're in a hurry, skip the homemade crust & use the Pillsbury pie crusts that you simply roll out.

I made this twice since I had two crusts.  Once with sugar as listed and next with 1 cup of sugar....we enjoyed it better with sugar reduced.  I had too much trouble with the meringue so we ate it with nothing on top and it was great.

This pie is AWESOME!! Yes, that's right 2 exclamation marks worthy! I'm typing this as I sit with a post eating 1/4 of pie tummy ache. Did not change a thing. Perfect chocolatiness, texture, taste, help up nicely. Topped this fudgey goodness with the Meringue II recipe from this site The meringue didn't stick too well, but who cares the pie was excellent with or without the topping. I'm a very green chef and I find this hard to mess up. Cooked the chocolate custard for about 8 minutes and it was thick and left it a little longer just to be sure (even though I was aiming for 15 min as another reviewer suggested, but I don't think that was necessary).

Nice. This was very nice and tastefull for guest lunch today. I didnt have unsweetened chocolate (only regular chocolate), so I ommitted half a cup of sugar. I covered the pie with chocolate whipped cream. This was kind of perfect. I made it a couple of days ago, and it was just to intense and sweet for me with all the sugar and the sweetened chocolate. But with adjustments it was seriously kind of perfect.

I have made this pie several times.  My son requested it for his "birthday cake" this year.  I add a vanilla whipped cream (home made) topping and chocolate bar shavings.  I make two and freeze one as the kids like both versions.  It never lasts long in this house!  The directions are spot on, I have had no issues with eggs curdling and the sweetness level is just right.  Very rich and silky, totally indulgent.

This recipe is fabulous with some slight changes!!! I added a 1/2 cup milk and 2 tsp cornstarch. I used fat free milk and it was still very rich and smooth. I adjusted the recipe to 1 and 1/2 times in order to fill the pie crust. Everyone who has tasted this pie wants the recipe!!

This pie was easy and delicious! My husband loves chocolate and coconut so I added a layer of toasted coconut to the bottom of the pie crust prior to pouring in the chocolate filling. I topped the pie with whipped cream, shaved bitter chocolate, and more toasted coconut. It was a hit!

I am giving this recipe only two stars. The pie tasted fine, but it was not thick enough at serving time. I made it one day in advance and refrigerated it. It was too runny.   Next time, I will increase the amount of corn starch. This is a good recipe but needs to be thicker and firmer.

A five star recipe!!!
The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of sugar as I didn't use bitter sweet chocolate. 
The custard was thick, rich and really did taste like fudge.

Yum! Made it once following the recipe and once with our own substitutions. A graham cracker crust and marshmallow fluff topping make it s'more pie.

My late Mother-In-Law forgot to leave me this exact recipe for her lifelong famous chocolate pie.  I have been trying to duplicate it for years and this is IT!!!!  My husband thanks you from the bottom of his fully belly!!!!!!!!!  I did add the extra milk and extra corn starch.  I love a full pie and I put a meringue.

I was thrilled to make this pie for my husband whose favorite pie is Chocolate Cream.  I do not like Chocolate Cream Pie so this would not be tempting.  Well let me tell you.  This pie is AMAZINGLY wonderful.  It is now my favorite all time pie.  I will be making it often.

This pie is SO easy to make and truly a crowd pleaser!  I was worried about it setting since I used soy milk but it came out fine and perfectly fudgy!  I made the butter flaky pie crust from this site as well and topped it with fresh whipped cream.

Just made this pie because it sounded good.  It turned out better than I could have imagined.  I have made similar pies before with poor results, but not with this.  Did not follow the recipe exactly as I used the suggestions of other reviewers and used evaporated milk for a richer taste and texture and used 2 cups of it rather than 1 1/2 cups.  Also added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.
However, I did not have the problem of it not being thick enough, in fact mine was so thick I could hardly whisk it before it ever came to a hard boil, so I went on and removed it from the heat, stirred in the chocolate and vanilla and poured it into the pie shell.
There was plenty of filling for a deep dish 9 inch pie and it set up beautifully.  I will be preparing this again.

I'm giving this 5 stars, because I can just IMAGINE how awesome this will be NEXT time I make this recipe!  I too added 2 extra teaspoons of cornstarch and and extra 1/2 cup of milk.  The pudding was really enough to fill a 9" pie.  I did pile high whipped topping, but the pie did need more pudding.  Next time I am going to double the pudding mixture and use a deep dish pie pan.  Any extra pudding, I'll put into pudding cups or icecream cones.  DELICIOUS!

Loved it! Super easy to make, and it was a big success. I made one small variation by using one semi sweet chocolate square and one un-sweetened. It turned out with a ever so slight coffee taste, which everyone seemed to like. It filled my pie dish almost all the way and before I chilled it, i put raspberry filling over it. 4 hrs later... YUM!

This recipe is perfect! I got so many compliments at Thanksgiving- everyone thought I bought it at a bakery! You do need to be careful when stirring, it burns really easily. I used an oreo crust as someone else suggested- much better than a regular pie crust for this pie. And I put coolwhip and chocolate shavings on top- it doesn't taste right with meringue.

Where to begin?
This could not have been any easier or more delicious if Julia Child herself came back on wings and did it! Thanks for the recipe, it is fabulous!
The only change I made was a smidgen more cornstarch (1 tsp'ish).
This will be my go to recipe from now on.

UPDATE- Made it again about 2 hours later with sliced up banana on the bottom. Triple A!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make the changes several people had mentioned. I added  the x-tra 2 tsp of cornstarch and increased the milk by 1/2 cup. I topped it off with some homemade whipped cream and some shaved chocolate. It was amazing! and its very easy to make, the only thing is that you have to CONSTANTLY! keep stirring! I walked away from the stove for a minute and my chocolate filling almost burned. It takes about 13-15min for the pie filling to get thick. I timed it! LOL!

I have made this pie for several years and it is the first request from the family for the holidays.  I have had no trouble with following the recipe as written and it turns out wonderful every time, even living at 8,000 feet.  My grandmother used to make a chocolate pie from scratch and this rivals hers.  My father even says so and he is a die hard chocolate pie lover.  My family likes for me to make homemade whipped topping from heavy cream.  It goes very nicely with this pie.

This is the most amazing pie ever! It is so good and perfectly rich! It is the easiest pie to make and everyone who tasted it loved it. I added 3/4 tablespoon extra corn starch because I wanted it to be extra firm. I used a store bought pie crust and I had a little too much pudding left. (No complaints on that!)

Great pie! I doubled the cornstarch,omitted the flour then added an extra 1/2 cup of milk. I must be a bigger chocoholic than I thought because I found the filling to be a little bland with just two ounces of unsweetened chocolate so I added 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips. The leftover egg whites became a mile high meringue on top. It's taking everything in me not to devour another piece.

3 1/2 STARS! I have never made a chocolate cream pie. I had a craving (I'm pregnant) and chose this one due to the ratings. This was super fudgy which I should have expected due to the name! I think I would have liked a chocolate pie that was more traditional, less fudgy?! ALSO, I topped this with meringue II recipe, which was great, however, I put it in the oven for 10 - 12 min after my pie had cooled completely to brown meringue and I'm not sure that that was good for the pies consistancy. It was a bit runny after that. My husband really liked this pie. I liked it fine, but think it was not what I was hoping for. Too rich and fudgy - would have prefered a lighter tasting pie. UPDATE: I just threw 1/3 of this pie away after sitting in my fridge for a week. Husband might not have liked it as much as he said! :-( Daugther said it was TOO chocolaty!

this is the best pie and it is not as sweet as some cream pies. I have even made it with coconut milk to create the chocolate pudding part too and it was good.

i really did not care for this pie.  my favorite part was the shortbread cookie crust i used, which wasn't part of the recipe.  the chocolate flavor was off...odd even.  i can't puit my finger on it, but it was not good.  i put cool whip on top and that helped, but still, i would never make this again.  :(

edited 2016 Thanksgiving Day; After having made this for years, today I couldn't find my recipe card (you know, the one with all the recommendations from other AP chefs) . So I made this as written. It is so icky sweet, yep forgot to reduce sugar. Tasted chaulky, not sure how I fixed that (yes. I cooked it correctly). Not chocolatey enough, pretty sure I had previously added cocoa in the dry ingredients. Not enough to fill a pie crust. Wish  I'd re-read and followed the wonderful recommendations from the chefs  on this site because without it this pudding is just not that good...sorry.   Yummy... VERY rich and creamy! Not your average chocolate cream pie. Thanks for the recipe

Exactly what I was looking for in a chocolate cream pie.  I did follow the advice of others and added 2 tsp. cornstarch and 1/2 c. milk.  Consistency was great.  For the crust, I used "Pie Crust IV" on allrecipes, and it was a great compliment.  I made a whipped topping from 3/4 cup whipping cream and 1 Tbs sugar (I whipped slightly beyond normal whipped cream "stiff peaks" so that it was more sturdy and longer lasting in the fridge.

I pored the filling over a peanut butter cookie crust (I don;t like regular pie crust).  Everyone raved about it!  Nice and chocolaty.  I cooked it in the microwave, removing it every 30 sec to stir until it was thick and bubbly.

This pie is RICH. And wasn't a hit in this house. I tossed some of it it. THAT says a lot :/ The flavor is decadent and the pie is dense. It sure lives up to it's name. Next time I'm going to opt for a fluffier, creamier recipe.

Tasted great, but too runny. I will try more cornstarch the next time because it looked like soup on a crust. I also think that the recipe was a little vague and didn't give information like how thick should the mixture be before removing from fire which, for total beginners like me, is really important.

Finally a chocolate pie that doesn't taste like chocolate pudding.  We loved it!!!  Made it just as directed. The next time I will add some instant espresso just to see what it does to the flavor.  Should be good, I hope.  Thank you, Nancy, for sharing.

It wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  My pudding came out very very thick, almost too thick.  I'd give it 3 stars but my son absolutely loved this so I give it 4.

Wonderful!!! This knocked our socks off. I have made French Silk pies from this site before but this was more like a French silk than any of them. I made it exactly as printed... used whole milk. It was so decadent and rich. No, it doesn't quite "fill" a 9-inch pie crust, but there was plenty! The whipped cream took care of any remaining space in the pie shell. I will make this often!

Wow, I've made this pie a couple of times and I must say it is lovely!  I made an Oreo cookie crust and I made my own Cool Whip because I can't get either where I live.  Should I ever move back to the States I will still be making everything from scratch as it is soooo good!  Definitely a keeper.

SO GOOD!! My husband is a chocoholic and I love chocolate cream pie. This recipe was so easy and so much better then the pudding box mix! I did add an additional 1/2 cup milk, and 2tbsp cornstarch. It filled a deep 9" crust perfectly! I made this for Christmas and I'm making it again tonight for New Years Eve!

Simple, quick recipe for a delicious pie.  Living with a chocoholic I doubled the chocolate.  Too much chocolate for my tastes, but received rave reviews.  I did enjoy the smooth texture and the way the pie held together after slicing.  This is so easy it's almost fail safe, although I'm sure there are some out there who will manage to do so.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T. Very good and fudgy! Perfect consistency. Very easy to make too. I think whipped cream compliments better than meringue.

MMMM...this pie was wonderful! The filling was not too sweet, not too bitter, but just right. Instead of using unsweetened chocolate, I used 2 heaping tablespoons of fudge ice cream topping and I topped with mini marshmallows and broiled them. I also used with the Boiling Water Pie Crust.

This was super easy to make, but suggestion.....use more chocolate. I used 4 oz of chocolate, and I never use Baker's, its chalky and doesn't taste very good. I recommend Ghiradelli 72% Dark Chocolate, it gives the cream a super rich taste. This pie was gone before I made it through the dinner line!

I love chocolate. This pie is amazing! I always make it with the shortbread crust found on this sight and it is incredible! watch out when you take it to parties, I found it tends to melt if it gets too warm.

This is a nice chocolate pie. It's definitely very rich and creamy. I followed the filling portion of the recipe exactly and can see how the addition of more milk would've produced a fuller pie. I was still pleased with the results, though, and would make this again.

Really easy to make and it turns out very chocolatey and delicious. I made it once for Thanksgiving and it was immediately put into my "keeper" file. Various family members and friends love this too!

I grew up with my Nana's homemade chocolate cream pie, and this is the closest recipe I have found.  Worked perfectly.  So rich and smooth.  I used Ruth's Grandma's pie crust recipe from this site.  It stayed crisp and fresh the second day.  I will look no further for the perfect chocolate pie recipe.

I liked this pie but it is very sweet.  I think it needs more unsweetened chocolate.  I will make it again but will add maybe and ounce or two more chocolate.

Very easy, pretty good. Not quite as smooth as the blending of hot milk mixture into the egg yolks procedure, but all in all.... not bad.

This recipe was really good, I baked it for my family on Thanksgiving and they loved it! The only thing I did not like was texture, it was kind of like a pudding other than that it was really good.

Loveeeeee the taste of how my pie turned out!! I made it for thanksgiving so I haven't seen how well it cuts yet but it is definitely the best tasting chocolate pie filling I have ever had! Exactly what I was looking for!! I didn't want something too pudding-y, more fudge-y :) it's perfect! Made just how the recipe states.

I am a novice (and somewhat nervous) cook. My new husband is rather picky and is not a big chocolate fan, but I was in the mood for a chocolate cream pie. This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious. Even my husband really liked it and made a large piece disappear.  Everyone should try it!

This was honestly the best chocolate pie I have ever had--and I had the pleasure of making it. I too, would recommend the extra tsp of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of milk, because it ended up working out very well. Also, don't be worried if the mixture begins to clump up, when boiled. It is perfectly normal, just make sure you try to squash the larger ones. Thats really all I would recommend you doing apart from the general directions. I really loved this pie. Me and my sister secretly licked the entire pan clean after we poured it into the pie shell. :)

Followed exactly and it turned out perfect. Topped with regular cool whip but real whipped cream would be insanely good. Dangerous!

Perfectly easy and delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the milk to two cups and added to additional tablespoons of cornstarch.  What a chocolate flavor!  I topped my pie with meringue because I didn't have whipping cream or whipped topping in the house. This is going in my permanent recipe file.We recently had a group of men from our church over for lunch.  As they were eating this pie, I heard things like " the texture is absolutely  perfect", " so creamy", certainly not the usual man talk!  This is my permanent go to chocolate pie recipe!

Great recipe! I also took the advice of others and added 2 tsp more of cornstarch and an additional 1/2 cup of milk. I didn't have the chocolate squares so I used 3 tbs of cocoa and it turn out great. I used the egg whites for meringue to top the pie.

This is great. I did add an extra TBS of Flour and an extra TBS of Cornstarch. I also doubled the recipe because I made two pies. Wasn't quite enough though.

Th it's a great, simple, easy to make pudding recipe.  This pudding will definitely set firm.  I think it's best to increase the milk (liquid) to 2 1/2 cups...that way you get to cook it on the stovetop a little longer and will make it smoother.  Can also decrease the sugar 1 C only IF using semi-sweet or milk chocolate.  I use this recipe for all my cream pies that I need to do in a hurry.  My kids exclaim each time I make this pudding pie filling that it tastes the same as any of the pudding cups you can buy at the store.

This was wonderful!!  Warning: it is richer and stronger flavored than traditional chocolate pie.  We had this for Christmas dinner dessert.  Great flavor and not too complicated for this not so experienced cook.  I look forward to making it again for friends.

Perfect! First time making this kind of pie, and I used the "butter flaky pie crust" from this site. I used 2.5 oz of gherardelli dark chocolate chips instead of 1 oz unsweetened chocolate. Everyone said it was the best French silk pie ever!

This was my first cream pie! Everyone approved. It wasn't too sweet for me at all, and I would definitely make it again. 

I only made a few changes. I replaced the unsweetened chocolate with 3 tbsp of cocoa powder and 1 tbsp of butter. Melt the butter and then mix in the cocoa powder to avoid lumps.

I made a meringue topping by whisking 3 egg whites until foamy, then adding 6 tbsp of sugar. I continued beating until stiff peaks formed and then added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Lastly, I baked at 325 degrees for 15 minutes.

Turned out great!

Excellent and easy! This was my first pie ever and I decided to add 1/2 cup milk and 2 tsp of cornstarch
based upon other reviews and the fact that I had a deep dish pie crust. I let it chill for 3 hours and topped with cool whip. Very rich but the best chocolate pie I've ever eaten! Will definitely make again!

This is very easy to make.  It's VERY rich and fudgy.  It definitely needs to be served chilled, with whipped cream, or the richness will overwhelm the palate.  Anyone who found the filling of this was too runny must have done something wrong.  I made it exactly as directed and it was so thick it was setting before I even got it into the pie crust. 

This is not like a typical pudding pie.  The filling is much more dense, and the flavor and texture are similar to fudge (hence the name).  If you're looking for a lighter chocolate cream pie like you get from pudding, this is the wrong recipe.

I probably won't make this again, because it is too sweet for me, but it delivers on its promise.  It is what it says it is in the description: fudgy and rich tasting.

With a few changes this really delicious chocolate cream pie becomes out of this world wonderful. Like other reviewers, added an extra 1/2 cup milk and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. I also didn't have unsweetened chocolate so instead I used bittersweet chocolate chips and I doubled the amount of chocolate to 1/2 cup. I also added 1 Tbs cocoa powder to balance out the sweetness (and I just really like chocolate :) Also, at the same time I added the chocolate I added 1/4 cup peanut butter. Its enough to add just a hint of the peanut butter taste while bringing out the chocolate flavor and bringing all of the ingredients together. 
One last thing: I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie crust. This just made it all that much better. And you don't have to worry about soggy pie crust.

I rarely find any recipe of this type rich and fudgey enough, but this one very much is!  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the cornstarch and used 2c. of milk, and looove the resulting pudding/pie filling.  The filling recipe is also a fantastic base recipe, and I've successfully altered it to incorporate peanutbutter, beer, and many other things!

This is one of the best pies I have not only baked, but eaten in my entire life. So easy, and so delicious, I found it difficult not to eat this entire thing at once. Thankfully I have a hungry family.

The pie was good. I made my own crust and topped with fresh whipped cream. I did think it tasted like pudding in crust though.

This pie was very good and got rave reviews from all!  It was one of two pies I made for Pi Day (March 14th).  I used Hersheys Special Dark Baking Chocolate (which is dry so also added oil for the substitution per the back of the box) and the only thing I would do differently would be to mix up the dry chocolate with something wet/moist like the oil before adding it to the hot mixture as adding it dry made little tiny lumps - it didn't affect the flavor but even beating the mixture didn't remove them completely.  The lumps were not noticeable once I put the whipped cream on top, though!  I would definitely make this pie again.

This would have been good if there was a suggestion on how to top with a meringue. I followed the recipe, and decided to add a meringue on the top, added the whole pie to the oven to allow the meringue to brown and the filling went runny and never set at all afterwards.

Love chocolate cream pie but this one was really bad.  I followed the recipe exactly but the pie was much too sweet and pasty.  Not one I would make again.

This was awesome! I followed nrgizrbune41's advice, and added an extra 2 t cornstarch and 1/2 C milk, and it was perfect. I used 2 T chocolate chips (I think I might try 3 T next time). I also made sure to bring it to a hard boil (still bubbling even when mixed), and I was careful not to let it go longer than a minute to avoid it becoming too thin. I topped it with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. It was a big hit!

Everyone loved this! Even those who usually don't eat the chocolate went back for seconds! I made a graham cracker pie crust to go with it and then just had the whipped topping in a can to top it off!

I tried substituting Splenda for sugar when I made this, and just so you know, it DOES NOT WORK. I had to throw the pie out, the taste was so horrible. Other than that, I thought that the amount for my pie crust was just about right, and the texture was fairly nice. I may try to make this again with sugar someday, but I just wanted everyone to know that they should not try to do it with Splenda.

This pie was absolutely amazing.  I did increase cornstarch by 2 teaspoons and the milk by 1/2 cup as a few people suggested and it was perfect and super easy to make.  I will be making this again for sure.  I made my own whipped cream topping to put on top and garnished with some chocolate shavings and it looked like a professional had made it.

This was very good. My boyfriend really enjoyed it this is his favorite kind of pie so this was the first time I made it for him. He took half the pie to work and it was gone in 5 mins and everyone was asking for more. I did add the extra milk like suggested and it filled up a 9 inch deep dish pie shell just perfect and after it cooled topped with whip cream and chocolate shaving looked very professional.. thank you... this is a keeper..

This is a great chocolate cream pie!   The texture of the filling is very smooth and very chocolaty.  I used the shortbread pie crust recipe from this site and topped the pie with freshly whipped cream sprinkled with toasted coconut.  It was a great way to end a meal - I highly recommend it!

Excellent.  Made this pie for Christmas and everone loved it.  I doubled the ingredients for a 10" pie plate and I also followed nrgizrbune42's suggestion to add a little more cornstarch and milk.  I highly recommend using a pan with a thick bottom when cooking the mixture.  Came out perfect.

Very much like cool, liquified brownies in a pie crust. Really rich. Be sure to boil long enough for it to noticeably thicken. My personal tastes veer more toward French Silk, but if you like the Fudge Brownie as Pie idea, I would recommend it. Incidentally, I didn't have the unsweetened chocolate, so I substituted 2T oil and 6T cocoa.

Very chocolatey, I didn't give it five stars for the simple reason that there is not enough filling to really fill the pie. I would one and a half it and deal with the possibilities of leftovers. Tasted great!

This was a great texture. I made it for someone else so I did not taste the complete product, I did taste the mix b4 putting it in the pie crust and it was so chocolaty. I used the extra milk and cornstarch recomended by another user, Thanks. Also I did not have unsweetened chocolate so I used 6Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder + 2Tbs shortening. I would suggests if not going to fill pie with whip topping or meringue to double the recipe because it does not fill the crust.

This pie is super! The only modification I made was to add 2 T of strong coffee to the cream to bring out more chocolate flavor.  I brought it to a Christmas Eve party; and it was the first to go...a big hit, especially with homemade whipped cream! It is super-fudgy, and not a typical "pudding pie".  I was worried that it might not be enough filling for the pie, based on past reviews, but it seemed PLENTY thick enough, especially considering how rich it is...and if you know you're topping it with whipped cream/meringue, obviously you need to leave room/have a good ratio of filling/topping.

Very Delicious! And very simple to make! I would not recommend using a sweet pie crust because the chocolate is enough. Fudgy, not like a chocolate cream or pudding pie but that's great because I love chocolate! Thank you!

The best chocolate pie hands down! I made this using 2 whole eggs as I like to put whipped cream instead of meringue on top of my chocolate pies. My husband's family raved - and they are v. critical.

I was asked to make a chocolate cream pie for Thanksgiving but did not want to make an instant pudding one. Found this recipe and made it. It was ABSOLUTELY wonderful. The best chocolate pie I have had. Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving so I made it again for Christmas. This will surly be a traditional dessert for the holidays!!

This pie was a hit! It had so much taste, and was really fudgy, not light and fluffy like pudding. If you want a pudding pie, make that! If you want a slice of Heaven, MAKE THIS! I topped it with some home-made whipped cream whipped with a Tablespoon of vanilla instant pudding mix, Tablespoon of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla! Then I topped that with some semi-sweet chocolate shavings!  Everyone was completely amazed! I will DEFINITELY be making this pie again soon!!

This pie was delicious!  Filling is dense and fudgy.  Pudding mix doesn't stand a chance against this recipe.

I'm giving this a five because my little brother loved this SO MUCH. He ate four pieces for dessert, then in the morning he ate four pieces for breakfast!! *And there was only eight slices!! I topped it with lite whipped topping. I was suprized that it never got fully thickened. It reminded me of jello. But when flipped over and back, it remains in shape!! Thank you for such an EASY recipe!! I'll make it again, since it is "the best thing I've ever had.." says my brother. :]

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  It was a quick and easy to dessert to make (used a premade oreo crust) but I honestly think that instant chocolate pudding would have been just as good.  Topped with fresh whipped cream.  The fudge layer set nicely, and the recipe came out just fine - but I think I was looking for a differet taste. Thanks!

Nice flavor and very easy to make, but way too rich for my taste. Not the recipe for those seeking a light chocolate cream pie. I served with banana slices to combat the intensity of the chocolate flavor a bit.

Yes, this is a good chocolate pie.  However, I don't feel it's better than any other chocolate pies I've had.  You can make a chocolate pie that tastes just as good and is a lot, and I mean a lot, lower in fat and cholesterol.

I doubled the salt and used 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips for the chocolate, but otherwise followed the recipe. We loved it, though my husband, who likes light milk chocolate, said it might be a little too chocolatey without the whipped topping on top.

I've made this pie many, many times over the last 5-6 years, and it has always been a gigantic hit! I've found that you can substitute cashew milk for cows milk pretty well, just make your cornstarch measurements slightly heaping instead of exact. 

My favorite way to garnish the pie is either with sweetened meringue or with full fat whipped topping sprinkled with mini chocolate chips.

This is definitely thick, rich, and sweet! I followed the directions and it came out beautiful. I made meringue II from AR and put it on the warm pie and refrigerated it for desert the next evening. Our dinner guests were licking their plates. Thank you, Nancy!

Made for thanksgiving and was such a hit no one wanted pumpkin pie! Followed others suggestions about adding 2tsp cornstarch and 1/2c milk, Set up nicely. Cutting was clean and slice stood up on its own. Such a hit everyone wanted it for Christmas too!

I was in the middle of making this pie when I realized I didn't understand how much chocolate to add.  The recipe says 2 (1 ounce) squares.  Does this mean a total of 1 ounce of chocolate or a total of 2 ounces? I  couldn't figure out how to ask a question so I hope someone can make a comment so I will know for next time.  We haven't tasted it yet so not sure if I ruined it or not. I'll make a more accurate review after we taste it tonight.

This pie was excellent.  I didn't change a thing in the filling.  Has a rich, fudgy flavor.  Topped with whipped cream and decorated with candy eggs it was perfect for our Easter dinner.

Deliciously  simple to make. The only thing I did different was add chocolatr, butter and vanilla extract before removing from burner and allowed it to thicken with all ingredients.  A little over zealous to fix.it and wanted to speed the process along in my mind.  my family devoured it. Thanks for sharing!!

Pie was very good and easy to make - I would have preferred a little more chocolately flavor but all my guests (and especially my husband) loved it!

Out of this world. Doubled recipe to make sure we'd fill an oversized pie dish without skimping. We used a total of 6T cornstarch and 2 3/4 C sugar. So glad we didn't use any more sugar than that. Had made this once before without reducing sugar and regretted it. This time, I had no regrets. We filled the pie in a homemade graham cracker crust (doubled recipe). After pie had fully cooled over the course of many hours (~6 hrs) in the fridge, we made and added a layer of homemade whipped cream (doubled recipe) Literally the best pie we've ever eaten.

I made this exactly as listed and it turned out delicious. Very rich and creamy and not too soft. We added homemade whipped topping before serving. A Thanksgiving success!

This is a dead ringer for delicious and easy pie making.  I first made it as recommended as a chocolate pie.  I took it to an event and it disappeared in no time.  I wondered what it would taste like as a coconut cream pie, so I omitted the chocolate for 1 cup of coconut and 1/2 teaspoon of coconut flavoring.  I hate to throw egg whites away, so I made a merengue topped with a sprinkle of coconut.  The coconut pie was just as outstanding as the chocolate one.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow!  This pie reminds me of the fantasy fudge I make for the holidays. I used a powdered meringue for time on this pie. The meringue tasted like marshmallow cream. If you have a sweet tooth this is  for you.

I used 1 cup of sugar, added 2 extra tsp of cornstarch, and added 1/2 cup extra milk.  It was very good, and I received many compliments.  Plus, it was easy!  I will make this pie again.

Had high hopes for this, but it was just OK.  I have made much better chocolate pies.  My pie-loving husband was not wild about the flavor of the chocolate in this pie either.  I won't be making this again.

I think the recipe on its own would be good, but the suggestions for more filling and a thicker filling definitely worked out better for me. I used a deep dish pie and could've doubled the recipe without issue. The flavor was good and I added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon to the sugar and flour mix. I actually substituted bar chocolate with cocoa and butter with success. I'll use less sugar next time. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. Topped with sliced banana, whipped cream, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. A definite winner.

I made this exactly as written and, in my opinion, it tasted almost like instant pudding pie.  This took so much effort though.  My husband did say he liked it though, but I just didn't think it was anything special.  I think I'll try another recipe next time.

Super delish! The only change I made was to use my own pie crust. Made several pies for a gathering and this one was a big hit with the "chocolaholics".  It's very easy to make. Had no trouble with it not setting up. Definitely staying in the rotation.

I needed a quick base recipe for chocolate pie and this was it!  I substituted semi sweet chocolate chips in place of unsweetened and removed two tablespoons of sugar to account for the difference in the chocolate. I, like others, increased the cornstarch by 2 tsps and the milk by 1/2 cup. It was wonderful!!

With two oz of chocolate it was an awesome Chocolate Cream Pie.
With four oz of chocolate it was an awesome creamy Chocolate Pudding Pie!

I loved this recipe. I made this once just as the directions stated (very good) and then with the extra 2 TBSP of corn starch and 1/2 cup milk... I then added one extra piece of chocolate. (YUM) I am making the third and fourth today at my husbands request. I think this recipe was just added to family holiday staples!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2013 and I loved this recipe for fudgy chocolate pie! that is exactly what it is fudgy and good! this recipe will fill a regular 9 inch pie crust but, if you want it a little more full, which I did, then take the advice of other reviewers and add a 1/2 a cup more of milk and 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch that's what I did and it fills pie crust better if you want to fill a deep dish pie then double the recipe. I added the chocolate at the beginning to let it melt while filling was cooking and I had some scary moments, first I was stirring this filling with a spoon and the chocolate was not incorporating into the rest of the mixture it was melting but it was a mottled mess, thought it was ruined, at least it was visually, it looked bad!! so I got out my whisk and whisked it quickly as the mixture was thickening and when I did that everything smoothed out and blended just fine, I  would not use a spoon, use a wire whisk.

My first time ever making a chocolate cream pie. I don't think I have ever even eaten one before. My thirteen year old daughter kept begging me to make one, so after searching through a billion recipes we decided on this one. Boy are we glad we did. She loves it. No changes at all.

I've been craving chocolate cream pie something fierce this week, so I decided to give this recipe a go.  It was super easy to make, and it turned out great!  It's still cooling in the fridge right now, but I got impatient and had a slice already, and even slightly warm, it set up beautifully and tasted really rich and chocolatey.  I did take the suggestion to add 2 tsp of corn starch and another 1/2 cup milk, because my pie dish is very deep, and that seems to be a good amount of filling - enough to make a good balance with a whipped cream topping.  I also used the suggestion of spraying and wiping down my plastic wrap before covering the pie, and it made it much easier to peel away.  I will definitely be making this again next time I need to bring a dessert for something!

Absolutely love this pie!  I changed the serving size to 12 and follow the amounts to make a very full deep dish pie.  I have made this pie several times.  Recently I adapted it to make a coconut cream pie.  I cut the sugar in half, omitted the chocolate and added 1 cup shredded coconut.  It was wonderful too!
Thanks for posting Nancy!

I used semi-sweet chocolate as it was all I had in the house and it turned out fine - not toooo sweet.  As others had suggested, I also doubled the corn starch and added 1/2 c of milk.  Used the egg whites to whip up a quick meringue (and realized how much I miss the stand mixer I gave up in the divorce :-) and baked for 10 minutes in a 350 oven.  It was a delicious treat for our pre-Christmas festivities and my family loved it.  Will definitely be making again - soon!!

My teenage boys and their friends said that "this is the best  thing that ever came out of my kitchen". I used a chocolate chip cookie dough pie crust with real whipped cream using pure Vermont maple syrup. Using sugar substitute kept some of the calories out but, at this point it was not about calories. It was just a great pie for every once in awhile.

I really like this recipe! I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the unsweetened chocolate makes it very rich. I use milk chocolate instead and that makes it five stars. I also took the advice of some of the reviews and added 2 tsp of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of milk. Easy to throw together and always a favorite at parties! I top it with homemade whip cream and chocolate shavings. Delicious!

This pie was very rich and very tasty! I used Mom's Pie Crust from allrecipes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/moms-pie-crust/detail.aspx) and it worked perfectly.
The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I had to stand over a hot stove for half an hour in the summer so the filling would thicken.

I was disappointed in this pie!  I thought it would be more like the store bought Edwards Chocolate pie of years past (that is no longer available).  This one was not for me....Next time I will try the one with sweetened condensed milk.

My husband and I loved this recipe! It tasted very professional and this was the first pie I ever made and it was surprisingly very easy. I did add a little bit more milk and corn starch like some of the commenters suggested and it thickened a bit more. I used a store bought graham cracker crust and topped with cool whip. Going to make this for the family at Thanksgiving.

Excellent-everyone from Grandpa to my teenagers and my picky husband loved it. I did as many suggested and used 2 cups milk and 4 tbls cornstarch and it set very well. I also used the Sweetened Whipped Cream recipe from here for the topping-also excellent.

Thanks for a great recipe. I made it according to directions, I was a little worried that it might not set up, it didn`t get real thick in the sauce pan. I took a chance on it and was happy with the results and complimements I had.

Made this for my book club last night.  (We reviewed the book "The Help" and if you've read that book you know the significance of chocolate pie!)  Anyway, everyone loved the pie and wanted the recipe.  It was very rich and indeed fudgy.  It was easy to make and set up very well.  Remember to add all the ingredients except for chocolate, butter and vanilla BEFORE heating.   For some reason people think it needs to be heated before adding the eggs.  Mix all together and then heat.  It will turn out perfect.

made this exactly as the directions required but added 1/2 oz extra of unsweetened chocolate.  this is now my only recipe for chocolate cream pie.  rich, creamy, held up well and 4 people finished off this pie in one sitting.  wonderful.  fudgey and just the right amount of sweetness.

I used half semi sweet giradeli choc and rest unsweetend chocolate. This is my husband favorite pie in the world. So at 75 years of age you have a great review. He asked me to make it for company coming instead of my cheesecake?
Gota love that pie.

This turned out okay.  I think I've gotten so used to the chocolate pudding pie that this just didn't have exactly what I was looking for.  My dad, however, loved it.  It reminded him of how my grandma used to make chocolate pie.

Excellent recipe!  I reduced the sugar, I think you only need 3/4 cups.  (I had used 1 cup, and will reduce next time).  And I used lowfat milk, and also Green&Black's 85% chocolate. I think I'll also try adding some coffee in next time as well.  I put whipped cream on top, and sprinkled chocolate over it.

Yummy! Very easy to make, topped with cool whip after the pie cooled, used a pre-made shortbread crust. Huge hit! We'll probably be eating this for breakfast tomorrow!

I'm sorry to give this a bad review. because I was so excited to try this highly rated recipe.  I prepared it exactly as stated (using whole milk, and adding a whipped cream topping that I made from heavy cream, with shaved chocolate for garnish).  The flavor was good, but the overall result was disappointing.  I had announced that I was bringing a chocolate cream pie, and several people said (when it was being cut), "Where is the chocolate?" It's not the reaction I was hoping for!  I used 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream, in order to fill the pie plate to the proper height, but it overwhelmed the filling.  Not sure if I would make this again with double the amount of chocolate filling or not.  It was a lot of work (including stirring for 15 minutes), for not a lot of Wow.  Again, sorry.

This was hands down the best pie I've ever eaten/made.  It tastes a lot like the homemade pies that you get from diners, but even better.  I will never make instant pudding pie again!!!  My family LOVED it!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and EVERYONE (kids to adults) loved this pie!  I am always nervous trying new recipes, especially when I'm trying it out with new people, but this was PERFECT! :)  Mmmmmmm!!!!

I made this pie for a friend's birthday and it turned out pretty well.  I followed the recipe as stated and  topped it with most of a tub of Cool Whip and some chocolate shavings.

Take the title literally.  It's like eatting a slab of fudge.  Not what I'm looking for in a slice of pie at all.

Next time add 1/2 cup more white sugar and I used cocoa instead of unsweetened chocolate.  Use 5 Tbsps. instead of 6.

Rich and yummy! Set up nicely and was a hit last night.  After reading reviews, I revised the recipe for 12 and it filled the (Pillsbury) pie crust perfectly.  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings (use a veggie peeler to a dark chocolate candy bar) for the BEST chocolate custard pie!

Wow!  Great chocolate pie!  Chocolte pies are a "big deal" at my in-laws house at the holidays and I have been trying to find a recipe that was thick and fudgy like hers.  This one is definitely a hit.  It passed the test!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is the second year in a row that I made this chocolate cream pie for Thanksgiving.  It is definitely a favorite and I'm sure I'll be making it again next year!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I topped it with a traditional whipped cream topping made with confectionary sugar.

This made a GREAT chocolate pie!  I accidentally put one less chocolate square in it than it called for.  It was still amazing!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is such a hit with our extended family that I am required to bring two of them to Thanksgiving dinner every year! A few tweaks I've made:
1. Use Ghiradelli chocolate. The difference is noticeable!
2. Make a crust of either crushed 'Nilla wafers or Trefoils (sold only by Girl Scouts) mixed with softened butter. It really compliments the rich chocolate taste more than just a regular crust.
3. Use heavy whipping cream to top the pie instead of meringue. If you really want to get fancy, grate some chocolate or crush Thin Mint cookies (again, sold by Girl Scouts) on top of the homemade whipped cream topping. 

Unbelievably decadent which is why I only make it once a year! :)

The taste of this pie is great. It was a little too thick after a few hours in the fridge, I was looking for a lighter pudding-like chocolate cream but will keep this because its really delicious... Its not the pies fault that I was looking for something else

PERFECT as is!!!  But...here is a Christmas variation:  Instead of topping with whipped cream, why not try topping with a basic peppermint pie recipe. I'm going to give it a whirl for Christmas Eve. Christmas delight!!!!

I am not sure what all the fuss is over this pie. It was ok by itself, but I would recommended topping with whipped topping because it tasted much better afer I did that. Nonetheless, I doubt I will use this recipe again because I have better recipes for chocolate pie.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make. Thought my husband would hate it as he likes the lighter chocolate, but he raved about it and asked that I make it again.  Definitely a keeper.  Highly recommend.     Barbara
