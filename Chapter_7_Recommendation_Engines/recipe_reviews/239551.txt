These shrimp are amazing! I served them over rice for dinner and my family gobbled them all up.

I usually like food with heat such as Thai, Mexican, Cajun, and Hunan but my lips and tongue were on fire.  It's a good thing that I had sour cream on hand because my husband couldn't eat it without the sour cream to create a heat barrier.

Very good, I'm a college student so I often times have to alter recipes based on what i have, in this case the vinegar (had to make my own sambal) turned into a few pieces of lime pickle and made with tilapia instead of shrimp. Oh I also made a side of onion asparagus and mushrooms to go with and mixed in leftover sauce(:

Very delicious. However I only added 2.5 tablespoons of the sabal chili instead of 1 cup (that sounded crazy) and I pan fried them instead of grilling. Turned out great!
