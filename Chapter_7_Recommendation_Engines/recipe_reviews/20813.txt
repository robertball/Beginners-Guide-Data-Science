Shhhh, don't tell anyone!  I halved all of the ingredients, and I also skipped the preliminary steps of soaking the oats, etc.  I dumped everything into my bread machine---STUPENDOUS LOAF OF BREAD!!!  Slightly sweet, wonderful color, texture, and flavor.  A keeper.

I have been baking bread for a long time, and this is definitely at the top of my favorite list. I made it twice this weekend - first by hand, following the recipe (although i had to add 1/2 cup of additional water to the dough), then i tried it making with the bread machine on dough cycle and baking it in the oven. When i make it in the breadmachine in the future, i won't pre-cook the oatmel - it becomes a big "lump", and is hard for the machine to handle. Also, i reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp, substituted 1 cup of whole wheat for bread flour, and 1/4 cup of wheat gluten for bread flour. Very tasty bread - I didn't think it was dense. I would highly recommend it!

This is truly great oatmeal bread! I can't believe more people having reviewed it.  I like it because it has more oatmeal per loaf than other recipes (1 1/2 cups per loaf).  I also like it because it is sweetened with brown sugar instead of honey, which is cheaper and I always have some on hand.  The bread is chewy and a little sweet.  I have made it twice by hand.  The first time it was a little dense as other reviewers noted.  The second time I added a little more water to the water/oats mix (maybe 1/4 cup) and it turned out perfect.    Also, I substituted an equal amount of canola oil for the shortening.

This recipe is really good for the bread machine!  I did exactly what another reviewer suggested and just put half of everything (even the last bit of water and sugar) in the machine and it came out awesome.  Not too dense and not too light - perfectly moist and chewy.  This is one of those rare recipes where you don't have to add or change anything to make it great!

Hands down my favorite bread recipe to date. I halved this and used my kitchen aid for the kneading. At first it was a VERY tough dry dough so I added a touch of water, and figured it was going to turn out awful. But it rose perfectly both times and it's a perfect dense slightly-sweet bread. Great for toast and grilled sandwiches, and also a nice hearty tuna and veg sandwich. Nice light crumb. Just the kind of bread my family loves. Thanks for the great recipe!

Has a great hearty texture and weight. Reminds me of my moms oatmeal bread. Best eaten right out of the oven, but great toasted later too.

I've been making this wonderful moist bread for three years now.  It's healthy, a crowd pleaser, keeps well, and makes great toast.  The recipe has never let me down.  Give it a try.

I followed this recipe exactly.  This made 4.5 lbs of bread dough! I baked one 2.5 and one 2 lb loaf. It rose wonderfully and smelled so good baking. The bread has a good texture and crisp crust. Tasted fantastic!

This may be the best loaf I have ever made.  

Slightly sweet, just dense enough, with amazing flavor and texture.  I didn't use the brown sugar, I substituted white sugar and 2 tsp of molasses.

I halved, then placed all of the ingredients in my bread machine, using the Basic, two pound, medium crust setting.

I made this by hand and got a lovely not-too-dense loaf with a great flavor. I used instant yeast (Red Star Platinum) so my technique was different. I cooked the oatmeal as directed, but only let it cool 10 minutes or so, just cool enough to handle. I added half the flour, worked it a bit, then added the rest -- it wasn't quite dough yet, but I turned it out and worked it until it formed, then added enough extra water to make a good moist dough (oatmeal bread dough will be quite sticky until you've worked it enough, but it's important that the dough not be dry or you'll end up with a brick. A dough scraper is a great tool to have). I let it rise twice, then baked in dark pans at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. To make it fabulous, I rubbed the heck out of the top crust with a stick of butter as soon as I took it out of the oven.

Excellent!  I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 3.5 cups of bread flour.  Quick and easy....and very good.  This is definitely added to my favorites.

Thanks, CARRIZALES!!!  This is a wonderful bread.  It'll be in our regular rotation from now on.  To the people having problems with dense bread, perhaps too much flour is being kneaded in.  This dough should be sticky but a little springy when kneading is finished.

I made this and it's one of my favorites.  I used molasses instead of brown sugar and just poured boiling water on the oats instead of cooking it.

So Good! This is an awesome recipe! I’ve  made this several time and I’m never disappointed. This really is my “go to” bread recipe. The only things I change: I use butter instead of shortening and 2 cups of whole wheat flour plus the 4 1/2 cups of regular flour.

I've made this bread recipe multiple times, mostly starting it in the bread machine and baking it in the oven.  I think it's a bit more tender if baked in the oven, but definitely good either way.  I mostly follow the recipe and it always turns out fantastic.  When making this recipe in the machine, I half the recipe because my bread machine can't accommodate the full recipe.   I will mention for anyone going this route, don't forget to add a bit more water because you aren't  proofing the yeast as you would making it by hand. If you don't add it, no worries, the bread is slightly more dense, and great in the toaster with morning coffee or tea.

This is tasty and has a nice texture for a yeast bread with whole grains. Next time I will try at least half the sugar and maybe use honey instead of brown sugar; it is much sweeter than it needs to be. Also the loaf that rose and baked in a traditional loaf pan sunk in the middle; not sure if that was the baker's fault, climate, or something else, but it didn't come out aesthetically pleasing; not a deal breaker for me.

Yummy, hearty bread!  The only switch I made was butter for shortening, and I added a drizzle of molasses just for a little more color.  I really didn't feel like taking the time to cook the oats on the stovetop, but it was worth the effort.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it soooo many times. I always cook the oatmeal in milk, instead of water, and add a little more than called for. I don't wait for the mixture of oats, milk, and salt to bubble before I add the brown sugar and butter; I just wait until it's warm enough to dissolve the brown sugar and butter into the oats and then cook it until the oats soften. I then pour the warm oat mixture into a bowl with a 1/2 cup flour and mix until it's  cooled a little. Then I add a little honey and water to a measuring cup, and mix in the yeast. Once the yeast is dissolved, then I add that to oatmeal mixture (as long as it's not too hot still). Then I slowly add in more flour until it comes together; then turn out onto the counter,  and knead in the rest of the flour. I also use Rapid Rise Yeast so it doesn't take as long to rise. It's a delicious, moist, and hardy bread that goes great with soup. I've also made a half recipe into 12 rolls in a 9-inch cake pan. Crammed them in there, let them rise for 30 minutes; brushed the tops with and egg wash, and baked them for about 25 minutes at 375. Great recipe, thank you for sharing.

I halved all the ingredients and of course, 1 package of dry yeast   which I buy in a jar and keep refrigerated is 2 1/4 tsp. I used my Sunbeam Bread Machine on the dough cycle and then let dough rise another 30 minutes in the loaf pan that I baked in.
Fantastic recipe!! Where did you come up with the name?? I noticed that Torrejon is Spanish. Thanks.

I have made this several times and we love it.  I halve the recipe and use the bread machine on the dough setting.  I shape into an oblong loaf and let the dough rise for 40 minutes before baking.  It makes an excellent bread for sandwiches.

I baked this bread yesterday and it turned out great and very delicious.  I cut back on the flour though as I felt it was getting too dry so I cut it back to 4 cups and the bread turned out perfectly! Have to admit I was a bit afraid that this was going to turn out badly because the dough was beginning to get crumbly and thats when I decided not to use any more flour over the four cups.  I will deftnitely make this again and soon.

Nice and soft, so bf's happy.  He noticed it was a bit sweet, and it is.  I halved this to make in the bread machine (dough cycle) and then let it rise in a bread pan and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Turned out a huge, nice loaf.  I'm not convinced it's hearty like the submitter said but it's a nice, soft, and large loaf.  I do like the oatmeal in the bread.  thanks for the recipe!

If you like VERY dense breads you might like this one. I prefer a lighter bread and should have read the reviews prior to making it, and I might have looked for another recipe.  It is good toasted, however, and it is easy to use.  Thanks to cheapchick for her advice on using an egg wash and sprinkling toasted oatmeal (about 1/4 c.) on top of the bread.  It did look nice.

If you like a dense bread, as I do, this is excellent.  If you're looking for a light, fluffy bread, you need to select another recipe.  This has a somewhat chewy texture, and is good toasted or untoasted.  I might cut down a bit on the sugar next time, but it's good as is.  My dough did not require the full amount of flour stated in the recipe to make the dough not sticky.

I have been making bread for a long time and this is one of the worst. It is heavy and gummy. Definately would not make this again.

This was okay tasting, but was heavy. I may try it again.
