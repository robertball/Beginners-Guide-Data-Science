Delicious! A lovely drink to make for these cold winter evenings. I will add a cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon next time.

It was good but a little sour for me. Next time I think I will leave out the lemon juice.

I loved this.  Reminded of what my mom would make on cold winter mornings when I was a child.  I did add one tea bag to the pot as well as a cinnamon stick (instead of the ground cinnamon).  I added the lemon with the other ingredients as well.  It was fantastic!
*Update*  This is my go to fall drink.  The tea bag totally changes the taste and I still only use the cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon.  I have also used 2T of sugar in place of the honey and it is so delicious.

I made it with a cinnamon quill and 1 whole clove. It was nice, but not really my thing. Works best with pulp-less orange juice

The ground cinnamon wouldn't dissolve for me and the amount seems excessive. My result was sickly sweet. I will try again with a cinnamon stick instead.

Great hot drink for a cold night.  I really like recipes that I have all the ingredients on hand. Very good and the perfect amount for just 2 people with a little left over for tomorrow.  Made it just like the recipe is given.
