Tried this for the first time for company and it was a success.  So simple, classic and tasty.  The only changes I made to the recipe included adding a bit more pepper due to personal preferences and lowering the temperature to 350 degrees F for the last 30 - 40 minutes. Served this with Basmati rice and glazed carrots....Very tender and tasty and great for company....I forgot to mention I did make this for 4 people so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly.

This was delicious!  I made as is, except I made 2 hens, so doubled everything.  I also cooked about 10 minutes more than stated since I had 2 hens and it was perfect.  Thanks for a yummy and easy recipe!

This recipe was great! I cooked four birds instead of just two because we were having this for Christmas dinner with relatives. I cut some onions and carrots into chunks and threw them into the bottom of the pan before putting the birds in. Then I threw some fresh thyme and rosemary in. All of that helps the birds to keep moist and makes it very aromatic. I cooked at a lower temperature of 350 degrees for 3/4 of the cooking...I upped the temp to 400 for the last 20 or 30 minutes to brown the birds. The first 30 minutes I put foil over them, and then took it off for the basting portion of the cooking. 

I paired these birds with the "Moroccan Cous Cous" recipe which is on this site, and included a side of green beans to make a delicious and beautiful meal!

Hi, I tried this recipe the other night for supper, and I am always looking for new ways to "dress up" chicken,and this was highly recommended and I am so glad that I tried it, here is what I liked about it: it was simple but a bit elegant and the chicken was very moist and really tasty, it was a bit different then the normal ways you do up chicken and that is what i loved about it!
I think it is worth everyone trying it and i think you will be pleasantly Surprised with the results!! Thank you misty for posting this great recipe!!!

I just started cooking and made cornish hens for the first time last week.  The only thing I did differently was to use a Bruschetta Chicken spice rub on the hens during the initial roasting step then the orange glaze to baste. This recipe was such a huge success that my husband actually told me that after 10 years he couldn't talk smack about my cooking anymore! lol  =)
p.s. I also used the same orange glaze on some freshly caught red snapper and everyone loved it!

Made this for a special dinner during the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was to make the recipe for six people.  Made a beautiful presentation and a delicious, memorable meal.  Thanks Misty for sharing - it is a keeper and will be using it again and again!

Really simple sauce to make.  I did make a couple of changes to accommodate what I had in the house without having to make yet another trip to the grocery store.  I made 3 hens and if you double the recipe you should still have plenty of marinade.  I didn't have orange concentrate, but I do have oranges trees.  I squeezed oranges till I had the same amount of juice to equal the concentrate I substituted. I used honey that has oranges cloves in it.  After combining all the ingredients I found the sauce a bit thin.  I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to a little bit of milk and thickened the sauce perfectly.  No change of taste at all.  I used the rotisserie to cook the hens rather than bake in the oven.  The comments I got were"you made an outstanding meal".  And this was the best games hens I ever had.

A flavorful treat; the glaze gives a beautiful orange color to the final dish and an impressive presentation for a special dinner. I cooked at a lower temp as suggested by others.

I made this on Christmas. I doubled the recipe because I made 2 hens. The hens were beautifully golden, smelled great, and the meat juicy and tender. We didn't love the OJ flavor so I won't make them again.

Will definitely make this again. I doubled the sauce mixture since I wanted them to be well coated. The first time I made this it was too sweet for my taste so I cut back a bit on the honey since the orange juice concentrate was already sweet enough. Instead of using a brush to coat it, I used a small serving spoon to pour the mixture over the chicken. It was a bit bothersome that I had to keep taking out every ten minutes to coat it but it was well worth it.

This was the best orange chicken I have ever had! I over cooked it a bit but that didn't stop us all from having more, more, more! And can I just say, the aroma that filled the kitchen and even wafted up the steps to the third floor!?! Simply hypnotic! Thnx Misty!

Easy to make but requires a lot of attention. Stirring up the sauce and basting the hens. I'd definitely use frozen oj again in sauces.

I made it for an alternative to turkey for Thanksgiving and loved it! I lined the pan with aluminum foil for easier clean up and to retain juices. It is juicy, flavorful, and tender. Instead of regular ketchup, I actually used Whataburger Spicy ketchup for an extra kick and it is amazing! I will make this again!

The family really enjoyed these, even my picky eaters! I like that these hens are not only delicious, but they are beautiful as well. I basically followed the recipe almost exactly, but doubled the glaze recipe for three small hens. I also did not have frozen orange juice concentrate, so I juiced 4 fresh average-sized navel oranges from our tree and boiled the juice down to 1 cup in a saucepan. I then added the honey and ketchup to the thickened orange juice in the saucepan and proceeded exactly as the recipe indicated. With this technique, I was able to thicken the glaze into a syrupy consistency without any issues. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely incredible flavor and so easy to make!  I made these for far more than two people and, without exception, everyone loved it.  I also tried stuffing some with a bread dressing and others with a rice dressing.  No matter what I used, the taste of the hen was perfect and the stuffed birds took no longer to make than the unstuffed ones.  This is elegant looking, just the right amount of food for each person, with fast prep and cook times.  I can't say enough about how wonderful this recipe is!

These were simple, easy, called for only a few things that came together to produce a tasty result!  I also used a lower temp (350) for a bit longer and then a quick broil at the end.

I love orange and honey so I knew that this was going to be a hit with us. I roasted two hens but didn't change the amount of liquids and still had some leftover. The only change that I made was to stuff the cavity with half a lemon and half a onion, each, to add additional flavour to the meat. In the futureI will lift the skin and add some of the orange/honey mixture. Great recipe, thanks Misty.

I did not like the glaze it was too tangy. Too much work. I do not recommend this dish on a week night. Perhaps I missed a step or something but I was not happy with this one.

This is absolutely delicious! The sauce was enough to use on 2 hens which I used. Yummy! I would definitely make this again.
