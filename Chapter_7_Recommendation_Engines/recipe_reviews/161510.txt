This is a good recipe for the often forgotten parsnip.  I love 'em - they cook quickly and taste so sweet.

I prepare parnsips in a similar way but on the stove top.  I steam them lightly  and finish them n a frying pan with melted butter combined with honey or brown sugar.  Lightly coat and brown parsnips over medium low heat.  I particularly like this dish with a roast of beef.

In addition to the listed ingredients, I added a little salt, a little dark brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and the juice of half a lemon to help cut the sweetness, and I loved the way they turned out!

absolutely delicious! i added a small amt of nutmeg and cayenne for a kick. i was afraid of parsnips because i thought they were long versions of turnips. i was so wrong and had to go back for seconds.

This is my first experience cooking and eating parsnips.  I had to cook them much longer than the recipe stated in order for them to be very soft.  Perhaps if the dish had been covered, they would have cooked quicker.  Neither my husband nor I cared for this dish.

This is a simple, delicious way to prepare parsnips. I prepared them exactly as the recipe stated and was completely satisfied; the parsnips were delightfully sweet and perfectly cooked. I'm looking forward to serving this dish at Thanksgiving this year.

Steamed ahead of time to reduce cooking time on the stove.  Serve with drizzled honey and feta for a more elaborate taste.

Pretty good. Water and honey did not evaporate or really provide a glazing but very tasty. My addition was both nutmeg and cinnamon, just a little.

I am still in the middle of cooking this. Something must be off here. Too much water? Too short cooking time? As directed, the honey, water, butter mixture never coated the parsnips to begin with....Just became honey water. And so..after the initial 30 minute cooking time, the parsnips were nowhere near soft..I kept adding to the cooking time...I am now at over an hour and 30 minutes going on two hours. Looks like this sauce is reducing slowly and may coat..Probably will taste fine when done. After all,,boiling in buttered honey water will most definitely make most vegetables taste pretty good.....End result...OK,,after 2 hours+ cooking time (I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper..) this was indeed delicious..but I find the directions need some editing.

I made these as a side dish for my Christmas dinner and the recipe made exactly as listed was a hit! We love parsnips and are delighted to find a new way to prepare them!

This was just okay for me. Lacked flavor even with salt. Maybe with less water the glaze would have coated the vegetables better.

I love parsnips, so I may be biased, but the whole family loved this.  I did add a dash of cayenne to the honey/butter mixture and I tossed in a few carrots to add color.  I believe the next time I would start the vegetables, without the honey glaze, at 425F to caramelize them and add the glaze for the last  10 minutes at 375f.  Thanks, christne1786 we will have these again.
