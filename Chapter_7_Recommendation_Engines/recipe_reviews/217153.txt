I played with this recipe a bit to help it to fit into one pie crust. I cut the milk back by almost half and I used about a half pound of seasoned taco meat instead of a full pound. I did use salsa verde and red bell pepper instead of green. Cutting those ingredients back, I had no issue with an overfull crust. I served this with oven roasted home fries. My husband and I thought this was okay, my two boys loved it.

This makes a huge amount. More than will fit in a 9 inch deep dish pie crust.  I used half the meat, half the cheese and still had way too much for the largest pie pan I had which is 11 inches across & l 1/2 inches deep. There was a lot of the egg/milk mixture left over.  It makes a tasty quiche but halve the recipe & use a large pie dish.

My family loved this recipe.  I filled 2 nine inch deep dish pie crusts, and was worried that alot of it would go to waste, but it didn't.  There was only a couple of pieces left, and we ate them the next day as leftovers.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks!

This was so delicious!  My kids loved it too and so easy to make.  Instead of using pie crusts and to make it more gluten free, I tore up pieces of corn tortillas and placed on the bottom and up the sides.  It does make a lot of filling so I put mine in a 9x13 and baked at 325 for 40 minutes.  It didn't need a whole hour to bake.  My kids kept coming downstairs asking what smelled so good and couldn't wait to eat.  My guests loved it as well.  it is a keeper!

This was awesome. Instead of following the other reviewers' instructions, I decided to spread 2 pie crusts into my enchilada pan, and it was perfect for one big quiche. I also used a whole onion, because a half an onion is unheard of in my household :) My husband loved this so much, I am definitely gonna make it often. I am kind of an amateur cook, but am trying to do it more often, and this really boosted my cooking ego. My husband said he couldn't believe I made something that tasted this good. Thanks!!

This dish is so easy to make and super yummy! I agree with everyone who said it makes too much filling, so make 2 quiches or cut the recipe in half. I will be making this again real soon!!!

I agree with the other reviewer's this recipe makes too much filling.  In order to only make one quiche I used the five eggs and them eye balled it for the rest of the ingredients.  I only used about 1/2 a pound of hamburger meat and 3/4 cup of milk.  My children and I enjoyed the end result, but my DH was not impressed.

Make it G.F.!  I took corn tortillas and cut-to-fit a 7 X 11 glass pan. Brush both sides of tortillas with evo or in my case I used bacon fat (yes, not low cal), but great flavor.  Bake crust for 5-6 min.  In medium mixing bowl briefly whip eggs & milk(I used 4 eggs and 1/4 c. milk). Into beaten egg mixture, I added the prepared taco meat,  5 oz's. bottled salsa with queso(heated slightly so it could be stirred into the mixture), we like things hot--so I added 2 T. fire-roasted tomatoes. Pour this into crust and top with 1/4 c. shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese and place a sliver of jalapeno pepper above where each serving will be.  Out of the oven offer chilled toppings of diced tomato, shreds of lettuce & sour cream if desired...Yum!  I only baked it 14 min at 400.

I found this recipe when looking for something to do with a pie crust and left-over taco meat.  I sent it today with my husband to work and he and his co-workers devoured it.  He said it was "a big hit".  I followed other reviewers advise and scaled down the ingredients.  I used 3 eggs, 1 cup milk, kept the green pepper the same at 1/2 c., used 1/4 large onion, about 1.5 c. cooked taco meat, 2 handfuls shredded cheddar (didn't have mex cheese blend on hand), and 1/2 tomato chopped (instead of salsa which I also did not have).  I baked it in a deep 9" pie plate in my gas oven for 50 minutes.  It sure looked pretty and smelled great coming out of the oven.  If I wasn't trying to loose my extra holiday weight, I would have had a slice.

I made it gluten-free by making a layer of cooked brown rice mixed with a couple of eggs instead of a crust, and made it more healthy by adding more vegetables (onions, zucchini and extra peppers). I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the regular milk with 6 eggs, and because of the quantity of rice and extra veggies, I baked it in a 9x13 pan. Everyone loved it!

Very easy and tasty. I make a crustless version by spraying a 9x13 glass baking pan with canola spray and then sprinkling parmesan cheese on the bottom. (Freshly shredded, not the kind from a can!)

Vegetarian Version - replace the beef with a package of defrosted frozen spinach.  Otherwise the same.  It was delicious!

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this recipe. I needed a recipe for a crustless taco quiche because my BF likes to eat as low-carb as possible so I just followed this recipe, omitting the crust. I should have followed my instincts and reduced the amount of milk in this recipe. I baked this quiche for 45 minutes and it was not set in the center. I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. After cooling for 15 minutes I tried to slice the quiche but it was really not sliceable. I ended up scooping it out of the pan like a cobbler. The flavor was very good but I didn't care for the consistency of the end product. *IF* I should decide to make this again I would definitely split the meat and the egg mixture between two pie plates and maybe reduce the crazy amount of milk. My boyfriend liked the flavors a lot and the soft consistency didn't bother him at all.

There is no way the filling, as written, could fit into one pie crust.  I always make 2 quiches and freeze one.  Also, I have made this recipe with green pepper and without, and my family prefers it without the green pepper.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Excellent! I like my food spicy, so added a layer of jalapeños on top of the beef. Used a quiche pan and a little less milk, and it was still full to the bursting! But oh so very good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing!!  I left out the pie crust and didn't use all the cheese. I also used green salsa and red and yellow peppers. I made a pan of small muffin quiches and the rest fit in a 4 x 4 pan. It was delicious!!!!!!

This was awesome!  I thought it might be way too much liquid but it was prefect.  Used a bigger then 9 inch pie plate a deep glass pie pan.  This had a great flavor and wouldn't change a thing but I think next time I might add some mushrooms and a some olives.

it tasted good, but 45 min. at 400 browned it too dark, but didn't burn it, and it still wasn't done.  
maybe my oven cooks too hot.  next time i'll try 350 for 1 hr.

Used the casserole method because my pie crusts were in thousands of pieces.  Next time I'll use a can of chiles instead of the green pepper.  I'll also not add any extra salt.  Everyone liked this.

I used the handy change serving link and adjusted the recpie. I only had 1 pie crust and a lot of reviewers said there was way too mch filling. I cut the recipe in half to 4 servings and my crust was filled to the top. instead of using ground beef, I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans, added a packet of taco seasoning, a few tablespoons of water and heated it until the taco seasoning was mixed in. Turned out pretty good. My 6 year old loved it!
