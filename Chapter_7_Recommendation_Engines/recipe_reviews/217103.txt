Very easy--which I appreciated. To make it a little lighter, I only used a scant quarter cup of reduced-fat sour cream and a scant quarter cup of plain fat free yogurt. I only used a pinch of salt. To add a little more flavor, I did stir in a teaspoon each of onion/garlic powder. The french fried onions and bacon on the top was awesome. We ate every bit of this. GREAT with meatloaf.

The potatoes were really good.  I will mix the bacon and onions into the potatoes next and see how that turns out.

This makes up ahead of time really well.  I took it up to the point of baking, the day before Thanksgiving and I cooked and crumbled bacon and left in plastic baggie the day before as well.  Thanksgiving day pulled it out of refrigerator an hour before placing in oven, added about a 1/4 of milk and mixed, then cooked for 30 minutes at 325 then topped with additional cheddar, bacon and onion rings, cooked for another 5 minutes then turned off oven and let it sit there until time to put it on the table ( another 30 minutes ).  Rave reviews from everyone.

I doubled the recipe and it fit into a 9 X 13 casserole dish perfectly. I didn't quite have the full two cups of sour cream but really it was just fine with less. I didn't pre-melt the butter, just put a room temperature stick in and mashed with the potato masher. I put the garden fresh chives and crispy bacon in the potatoes and then topped with a bit more cheddar and the french fried onions the last five minutes of baking. (Just a tip, boil the potatoes in chicken broth for added extra flavor)

This meal was awesome. All my kids and husband ate this!!!! I did do a twist. I did not add any salt (because of butter already having it). We had left over mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving used those and made some new. I also had some ham that had pineapple in it. I put half potatoes down, Then sprinkled pepper, put ham and corn and cheese. Then put the other half of potatoes over top with just a little cheese. Finished off like recipe called. Not the most healthy, however when you have 3 of 4 kids that are boys, this was perfect.

This was fantastic - to make it not quite so unhealthy, I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  After his first bite, my boyfriend asked, "oh yum - does this have sour cream in it?" - you really can't tell the difference.  Definitely will make again and do the same thing.  I used the full amount of butter but a little less cheese.

Made this last night, it was very good. I took the advice of one review and added the garlic and onion powder seasoning. I recommend it. I suggest that you don't listen to the measures of the bacon and the french fried onions and just put the amount of your liking.

This was really good and so simple to make up ahead of time. You can get it ready and then refrigerate it and cook it just before you need it. Yummy.

Kids were eating this one before it was even finished. Very easy to make. I sprinkled cheese on top of the potato with the bacon and fried onions, was a huge success even with my picky daughter who doesn't like bacon or onions.

This recipe was very easy. However, I felt it was rather bland. I even used garlic salt instead of regular salt. I think next time I will try garlic powder. My husband wants more bacon next time (lol!)

This was wonderful!  I used half the amount of low fat sour cream and used light cream cheese instead of the other half of sour cream.  I also decreased the butter by about 2 tbsp.  French fried onions were a great topping as well.

Made this dish again today exactly by the recipe and it was wonderful.  I made it last week, substituting Greek yogurt per another reviewer's suggestion, and it was too dry. I did cover the potatoes both times during the heating process before adding the onion rings and bacon.

Made it for Christmas and everyone raved about how delicious it was! I only added butter, salt and cheddar inside and put the rest of cheese, bacon, and French onions on top. I rested foil on top so the French onions wouldn't burn. I let people add fresh minced chives and sour cream on top of their portions. Scrumptious!

I have made this recipe over and over again, I thought it was about time to post how much I love it.  It's a hit at Thanksgiving every year, and a great go-to recipe pretty much anytime you need mashed potatoes.  Of course I add some garlic, but otherwise pretty much just follow the recipe.  Everyone always loves it and we rarely have leftovers.

Trifecta!  This is all three: delicious, easy and can be made ahead!  I added a little minced garlic, doubled both the green onions and bacon which I stirred into the potato mixture.  Absolutely yummy. My new go to potatoes.

Wanted twice baked potatoes - but didn't want the hassle.  Found this recipe and glad I did - all the same flavors of twice baked but so much easier.  This was a hit in our house.   Sister says "I love these potatoes" every time I make them.  I also omit the fried onions.

Great reviews from the family. They were happily surprised to have bacon IN the potatoes. One person who didn't like sour cream had no problems eating this as there's no sour cream taste.

Tried this recipe the first time today and it's a big hit in this family! I put the bacon and chives in the mashed potatoes and sprinkled some bacon on the top! Absolutely Delicious...easy to make and will be great for Easter Dinner!

VERY good! My son prefers it without the bacon so next time I'll have to top it off 1/2 and 1/2.  SO simple.

I just made this a second time and realized I forgot to mention in my original review that I found the French fried onions unnecessary. I also used turkey bacon for the bacon bits!  I took it to a get together and everyone loved it!

This was a hit!  I used vegan versions of butter and sour cream but that is the only change I made and everyone loved it!

I omitted the fried onions due to my family's gluten allergy. Everyone enjoyed it. Next time I will try adding a gluten free substitute for some crunch on top.

My family loved this dish.  It tastes just like a loaded baked potato, but better.  You don't have to put out all those toppings.
