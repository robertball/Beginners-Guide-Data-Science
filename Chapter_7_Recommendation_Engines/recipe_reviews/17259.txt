A good recipe, however we made small 1" balls instead of the two balls the recipe called for.  Works great for a party appetizer when the recipe is doubled or tripled.

I made smaller balls also, and instead of pouring the sauce over the meatballs, once they were thoroughly cooked through, I poured the sauce, mixed with about 1/2 cup water, over them and simmered them for about 15 or 20 minutes.  The sauce cooked into them, and they turned out great.  I'll be making them for a party soon and probably just put them in a little warmer and serve with toothpicks-I like the cracker meal (I crushed up saltines).  A good change from the usual cocktail meatball.

No I made it as the recipe called for. We enjoyed them very much.
