Wonderful! Everyone loved it, even the mom who doesn't eat pork. I was very impressed with this dish. Next time I would add more cheese but that is just us!

This was a hit.  I made it for my husband and my in-laws and they all really liked it.  My mother-in-law is an excellent cook, by the way, so I take notice when she likes something.  I followed the recipe almost exactly...my cans of cream of mushroom soup were already seasoned with roasted garlic and so I just left out the garlic powder.  And I did drain the green beans...the recipe doesn't mention that part, which might be helpful for a new cook.  Like another reviewer, I had never boiled pork before and it worked great.  I used whole wheat rotini.  All the different textures and tastes were great.  Serving size above is listed as 5, I think it would serve at least 8.  We had lots of leftovers.  (My side dishes were honeyed carrots and kiwi fruit.) I froze some of the leftover casserole...we'll see how it does reheated.    Picky little kids who don't like their foods mixed and sauced, like mine, might enjoy ingredients from this recipe set aside and kept separate for them: pasta, cheese, green beans, small pork bites, rice krispies.  Then at least they are learning to eat the same foods the adults are.

I just made this for dinner tonight and have to say that I came back and added it to my recipe box! I normally make Caramel Apple Pork Chops whenever we have pork, but we were looking for something different this time. Since we were in a time crunch I had to make do with what I had on hand. My changes were:  - Used a "family size" can of cream of chicken soup (26oz) and omitted the mayo. - Added a can of corn in place of the green beans - Only had 4 pork chops on hand - Used egg noodles instead of rotini but upped the amount to 2 cups  The result was wonderfully bubbly, lightly crispy on top, and a little too salty for our tastes. I know pork is salty to begin with, but I think it was the cream of chicken that was the real culprit.  Next time I'll cut the pork into even smaller pieces and increase the noodles to at least 3 cups. Adding some diced potatoes would add another dimension and combat the saltiness.  I think this is a very versatile recipe that lets the user play with ingredients based on what's available. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe and really easy to make.  The 1st time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  The second time i made it, i used chicken and I topped it with stuffing mix b/c I didn't have any rice cereal.  It turned out just as good.  I also used fat free cheddar cheese and that worked out great too.  If you have any leftovers you might need to add some extra soup or even some milk.  It gets a little dry.

My family did not like this recipe at all, which is strange because they are quite adventurous when it comes to trying new things. The sauce made from the soup and mayo was too thick (if I ever made it again, which I have been requested NOT to do, I would add a little milk). The crunchy topping was interesting and a good idea, but I would cut back on the seasonings a bit as we found it to be too salty. Unfortunately, this recipe was a bust for us...we all ended up eating Cheerios for dinner instead.

Surprisingly yummy!  Reminded me of green bean casserole, only more main-dish-y.  And I'd never boiled pork before, but it was actually good n' tender that way!  I'll definitely make this again.

This dish was a different way to serve pork which is just what we were looking for.  I used fresh green beans that I had boiled and it turned out well. This recipe definitely makes more than 5 servings.

Not sure if my additions even count as the same recipe but it turned out great.

Don't you love it when you start a recipe only to find out that you don't have all of the ingredients?  Well, the package of pork chos only resulted in two chops.  I used a can of cubed chicken.  I cubed the booiled pork so that it would match the chicken.  I loved the pork pieces, my son loved the chicken.

The topping is a keeper and tastes a lot like Shake & Bake.  I will use it on a lot of casseroles.

Absolutely loved it.  I goofed and added regular salt and some salt free seasoning afterwards, but still good.  I substituted peas for beans and my hubby scarfed every bit of it down.  Definitely a must make again.

I made it with two slabs of pork roast and 'Alpine Spice' as the seasoned salt. I'm enjoying a meal I can have again for lunch at work.

It was good enough. Seems like it’s missing something and is a little bland for my family’s taste.

Great starter for using leftover pork loin. Used mushrooms instead of the green beans and cubed pork loin. Also one can of mushroom soup and one can of asparagus soup.  And I did add a lot of cheese, parmesan and mozzarella, but this recipe was the inspiration  for what turned out to be a great casserole.

This was good  but needs improving. I cooked it in chicken broth instead of water. The soup mix was overpowering and made the dish seem very bland. I also think added crunch topping would help as well. I will make again and make some changes, hopefully for the better

Tried this today. We couldn't find nor taste the pork hidden in all the excessive ingredients.  Very "throw together what you have" recipe.  Have 90% of it leftover.  No flavor at all.  Sorry, it sounded like it might be good - would not recommend wasting all those ingredients.
