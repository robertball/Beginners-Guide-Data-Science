What a refreshing treat for the whole family!  I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk, didn't use the sugar and used 1/2 the water.  Poured it into popsickle molds for my daughter.  Turned out to be a great snack without too much sugar.

This was pretty good. I didn't have molds so I used 3 oz. dixie cups with short popsicle sticks in them, and ripped off the paper when ready to eat. The pops were awkward to eat, so using a bowl underneath while eating it made it ok. A quarter recipe made 13 dixie cups.

I am not a cantaloupe fan, but my family thinks these are great. However, I can only imagine the recipe's originator must have ice pop molds that each are the size of a paint can, because I filled my 18 Tupperware molds and 35 of the 3 oz. paper cups before I ran out. Two quarts of water and four pounds of cantaloupe is a LOT.
