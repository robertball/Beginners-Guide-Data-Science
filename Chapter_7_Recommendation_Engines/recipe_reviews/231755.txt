Excellent recipe.  I would suggest the overnight marinating time.  Give the vinegar / lemon juice time to work it's magic on the flank steak. Slice thinly against the grain.  Perfect summertime meal.

This recipe was a-ma-zing! Marinated the steak for 2 days to let it soak up all the flavours. The cooking instructions made a medium rare steak. Meat was really tender and flavourful. Definitely a keeper!

I've tried many marinades, but this one is at the top of the list!! My company stuffed themselves miserably because the meat was so good and told me it was the best meal they've ever had. I added cumin, thyme and oregano as well and the flavor was absolutely delicious. I made a gravy with the marinade and it was all DUHHliciousness! Try it, you won't be sorry.

Was a hit with my friends!  I let it marinade for two days.  It was amazing.  Just prepped another steak, will let it marinade for the day then throw in the freezer for the next BBQ!  Thanks for the suggestion!

Fantastic recipe! We've made it twice now, makes a typically tough piece of meat tender, and full of flavor. It is a family favorite now. Cooked it on our Traeger.

This was so juicy and delicious! I marinated the meat for about 20 hours. My husband cooked iton the grill for about 8 min on each side because we had a thick steak (1.5 inch) and then put in a bowl covered with foil for about 15 min.Then cut it up into tiny pieces and made tacos! Best tacos ever.

Very good and easy.  Marinated the flank steak overnight, then came home from work and threw it on the grill.

My fiancé's family loves flank steak.  He had been using a simple recipe with Italian dressing for about 20 years and they thought it was the best.  I found this recipe about 3 months ago and everyone loves it.  Now we use it for all steaks.  No one ingredient stands out - they all blend very well.

My subs: 
Olive oil instead of vegetable oil
Braggs liquid aminos instead of soy sauce
Apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar 

(Subs made to accommodate my pantry, g/f needs)

This is one of my staples. Takes 10 minutes to prep, it marinates, and goes on the grill! Crowd pleaser every time! Even my toddler asks for more!

I marinated it over night and the next day until I grilled it on my Traeger grill per their instructions. It was great. There was no over powering single ingredient, which suits my wife when compared to other recipes. I cooked it 8 minutes on the first side on 6 minutes on the flip side. I let it rest about 3 minutes before slicing it very thin on the diagonal. The Teaget was set to 425 degrees.

The marinade left a very vinegar taste behind.  Will not make again.

This is what i usually use for all steak recipes as the reviews said marinate at least 24 hours or more any meat. this would be good for Chuck Roast also i'll have to try it but rinse it off first be for cooking.

Omg, this recipe was soo, SO good!  I actually "accidentally" let the meat marinate a day longer than I had planned, and I'm telling you, the flavor was absolutely, positively, a.m.a.z.i.n.g.! Juicy, tender, with tons of flavor. You just gotta try!  Over-marinate!!! Yes, yes, yes! 
One thing, I wish I could find ways to re-heat meat without losing any tenderness.

Cooked it tonight. Had a large group so I cooked 2 steaks. I've read similar recipes where people replace the Red Wine vinegar with  Balsamic vinegar. 12 of 13 of my guests preferred the Red Wine vinegar steak. Was able to marinate the steaks only six hours. Definitely begin the marination the night before if possible. At least 8 hours+. The meat was close but not quite there. It was still excellent though. Good luck!

we used it on a porterhouse steak...needs less time as it is a tender steak.  excellent flavor.
