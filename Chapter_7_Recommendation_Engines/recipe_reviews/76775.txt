Although i found the cooking time needed to reduce the sauce was longer than stated, it was WELL WORTH the time it took. It turned out absolutely sublime, the sauce was very piquant and flavourful. I threw some chopped cilantro on the top to serve, and some creamy mashed potato on the side and it was awesome, my husband, who is a big seafood lover, was very impressed. This one is a keeper, I will definately be making it again. Thank you Maria, for a truly awesome recipe!!

Didn't dare to use cinnamon and cloves and couldn't find malt vinegar. I used instead balsamic vinegar and it was really tasty.

easy to make, i used red and green peppers (to add nutritional value) and i put a pinch of smoked paprika -- which gave it a real seafood-y smell and taste. served with rice - perfect meal!

The sauce was wonderful -- it was great on rice, and I think it would be great on a bunch of different items.  The squid was also quite good -- I've never cooked squid myself, and I was a little nervous, but everything went very well.

My only problem is that the smell of squid stuck to EVERYTHING.  That's what I get for cooking in a studio apartment...  Seriously, it's been weeks, and I can still pick up a hint of squid sticking to the walls in my place. It's awful!

I added a tin of tomatos to make it a bit more sustantial (remember something similiar from long lost Elizabeth Davidson book). Get its a great find as a recipe. I always keep a couple of packs of frozen squid in the freezer. Also goes great with fries!

MMMMM, this was easy and good.  It did take more time than the recipe suggested (as noted by others).  It took much more than 10 minutes for the juice to reduce (at the point before you add the wine).  Still, it was just lots of simmering--not much to it.    Tangy and tender.

I believe this recipe is for cuttlefish rather than squid (judging by the "soupies" in the title as well), although it's tasty when made with squid too. It's well worth trying it with cuttlefish if it's available at your local fishmonger's/fish market.

The sauce was spicy but it was missing something. I added chicken bouillon for better taste. I won't make this again.
