Great mix of flavors.  I only used 1/2 of the soy sauce ... and it was great!

Yu-ummm!  This is a simple recipe with a lovely meld of gentle flavors.  I try to make the recipes as stated the first time, but I had fresh, rather than frozen spinach, which was fine, and used low-salt soy sauce.  I also baked ten minutes longer to let the cheese melt on top of the dish.  Will definitely go into my favorites dish.  Next time I'll add a bit more portabella and saute in olive oil, because I prefer it to vegetable.  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe.
