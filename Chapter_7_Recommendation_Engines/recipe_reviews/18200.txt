While listening to the Beatles' White Album's "Wild Honey Pie", I wondered if such a pie actually existed...
When looking for it, I eventually found this one. Since I love both chocolate and honey, I thought this pie deserved a try. I baked Angela's shortbread crust (recipe found on this website as well), stirred chestnut tree honey (very strong taste) in the whipped egg white, followed the recipe and finally tasted it. Even if it is uncommun, the mix between chocolate and honey is great. Despite that pure chestnut tree honey has a very strong taste, it was quite discrete in this pie, just a subtle after-taste. The only suggestion I would make is to rather use a tart shell than a pie shell.
For the record, I've never found any honey pie recipe, especially not a "wild honey pie".

I made this pie for my family and they LOVED it!  I doubled it and saved one.  It definitly needed the whipped topping but I will make this again.

Good Lord, this was so sweet, it made the teeth curl!! Of course the kids 11&9 loved it, but dang, this was so sweet it refused to set, so we kept it in the freezer, then hubby and I could only eat the crust. Gosh, this is freakin' too sweet, and I love sweets! Sorry but I won't make this again, I'll need a shot of insulin first!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful!
I am allergic to dairy protein, so I used soy sour cream. I also used dairy free dark chocolate. Even with these changes noone could tell and it got rave reviews! My very picky 6 year old loved it!

I like the taste of this pie, that is where the stars come from.  But the pie is too dense.  It need something to fluff it up a bit. I struggled melting the chocolate chips since I don't have a double boiler which could have been part of the problem.  Someone who is good a tweeking recipes needs to try this then let us all know what is missing.  I will keep working on it.

This was just okay.  The consistency was like pudding and the pie was thin.  My husband, who is the chocolate lover in the family, said it wasn't the worst pie he's ever eaten...I guess that was a compliment. :-)

This was good but I still prefer the Chocolate Supreme pie from this recipe sight. More work but worth the effort!

This wasn't bad, but it was overly sweet. I would probably cut the honey by half next time. It had a nice flavor. The consistency was a little soft. I might try to beat the egg whites stiff before adding the honey. Overall, not bad, but not great.
