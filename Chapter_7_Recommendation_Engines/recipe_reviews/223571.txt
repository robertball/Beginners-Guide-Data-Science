This is so good, easy and delicious.  If you don't have a serrano pepper use a jalapeno pepper.  Want it spicy - leave the seeds in, want it more mild, remove the seeds and ribs from the pepper.  Either way this is really good.

Turned out great and spicy! Husband says it could use more avacodo. I did add the juice of 1/2 a lime and about a 1/4 cup of onion.

This is a quick delicious addition to fajitas. My family enjoys things hot, so I actually used 2 small Serrano chiles fresh from our garden. This is great on tortilla chips as well.
