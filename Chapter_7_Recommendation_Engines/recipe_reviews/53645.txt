I make the dough to use with leftover mashed potatoes.  I then add onion, cheese, and either spinach or brocolli which I drain and squeeze very well to get the liquid out.  I roll the dough very thin and sprinkle with paprika before baking.  I cut circles and shape individual servings.  They reheat well in oven and I imagine they would freeze well.

This was OK, but the dough wasn't like a real knish that you'd get at a kosher deli.  i prefer a "doughier" dough and this was a little harder.

For the filling I used 7 potatoes, 2 medium onions, 4 tbs oil, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp minced garlic, and 2 eggs.  For the dough I only used 4 cups of flour.  I divided the dough into thirds and rolled it out with a rolling pin.  I sliced the rolled 1/3 portions with a pizza cutter in half the long way.  This resulted in 6 potato filled logs.  I sliced the logs into 1 1/4 inch pieces with dental floss and brushed them with an egg wash (1 beaten egg yolk + 1 tbs milk).  I baked them at 375F for 45 minutes.  Makes 60 small knishes.  I brought them to work and had one of the girls I work with (who is a self-proclaimed "expert knish eater") try one.  She said the filling was right but the crust was wrong.  She said it should be flaky, like a pie crust.  Next time I'll use a pastry crust recipe for the dough.  YUM!!

there was too much filling left over, it just didn't measure out right. also, the dough wasn't right. im looking for a recipe close to the knish i had when i lived in new york. the dough should be flaky,not hard.

I added a few more things (cheese, garlic, butter) to give it a more savory taste. The only problem I had with it was the crust...It's suppose to be flaky and softer, so next time I'm going to just change the crust altogether. But the filler is great!

Not sure what they are supposed to taste like but these were very good.  The crust was very crunchy.  I cut with a sharp knife, not a pizza cutter as that squashed my dough.
