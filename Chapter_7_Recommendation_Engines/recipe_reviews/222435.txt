one thing about the hot dogs, i always grill them slowly like the Origianl Texas Wieners did in Newburgh Ny. from the 1920's till they closed.The buns i put in a colander over steaming water with a lid. I feel the microwave damages the texture of the roll.
I always mince the onions very finely before cooking them in the sauce. Build a texas wiener, dog on the bun, smear of French' mustard, add sauce then the onions last. Voila!

I tried this recipe, and it missed the mark. Number 1: Needs more onion, and onion needs to be sauteed into a paste. I started with 1 whole large onion, diced into bits, sauteed with 1 cup water for 30 minutes. Chopped only 4 hot dogs, and added to mix. Cut water down to 3 cups total. Number 2; I also mixed 1 tablespoon yellow mustered into mix. Cut cinnamon down to a pinch. Less liquid, so I also reduced cornstarch to perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons, dissolved in an additional 1/2 cup cold water, and added just enough to thicken sauce. Thickened sauce should be tkick enough to cling to dog, yet thin enough to flow around dog into the bun, but not drip excessively. Remainder the same.

Being from ulster county ny this is just like the local hot dog place! I froze the leftovers, it looks a weird consistency when defrosted but once reheated it's perfect! The mustard and fresh mince onions make it perfect.

Very good and even better if it sits for day in the refrigerator.  If you don't like it spicy, scale back on the red pepper a bit.  We thought it was going to be too hot, but found the spiciness just right, once on a hot dog with a roll.

I'm sure one thinks, wow ground up hot dogs! Hmmm? Nobody asked me what the mush was in the sauce and everyone loved the sauce. Just the perfect amount of spiciness.

Yup, this is the Newburgh version. I oughta know, I was born there in 1952 ! I grew up on those dogs. 'Found them again in the eighties on Albany Av. in Kingston when I worked up there, then, the son of the original owner of the Newburgh Tx Wieners opened up 5 miles away in my own town after he closed the old place on Broadway around 2000 (?).  I made it a few mos. ago and handed a sample to my son and his eyes lit right up.   Here's a tip: those dogs go best with chocolate milk.  One little cardboard carton for two dogs, two if you're having three dogs. Don't laugh! Try it!   One more observation to share:  if you're looking for this sauce, and browsing other recipe's for it, look for the cinnamon. If it's not in there, you're done before you start.
Cheers...., Fred

Made sauce just as recipe called for but when serving it ....Steamed bun amd hot dog and then top with sweet coleslaw and top with a dusting of cayenne pepper! Just like they do at Dallas Hot Weiners on Broadway in Kingston NY! Another Ulster County original! Been missing those since I moved away but now enjoy them in L.A.!

Good looking sauce, it's very similar to one I came up with. I'd love to compare notes with you.

I grew up in Ulster County NY. We used to beg my mom to bring us to Dallas hot wieners for lunch. The best! And Unjack is right, you must pile them up your arm for the best taste!

I followed the recipe exactly using Hebrew National all beef hot dogs. All I could taste was the vinegar.

I made this recipe exactly as written...the first time. It is VERY good, and as close as I have found online to MY idea of a texas hot sauce. I've been tinkering with it ever since. 

At this point, I start with a base of 1 lb. ground beef with drippings, cut the hot dogs to two links, omit the red pepper flakes in favor of 1/4 c. diced cayenne, cut the chili powder to a tsp. and cut the cinnamon to a pinch. 

I still haven't zeroed in the perfect sauce. For what it's worth: I grew up on Wellsville, New York's Texas Hot but now tend to favor Tom Wahl's sauce up in Rochester.  

Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from Ulster County born and raised and have had this sauce many times. Seen it made and never saw anyone grind up a hot dog. The original sauce is the best there is.
