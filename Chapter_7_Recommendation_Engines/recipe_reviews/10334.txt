yum! I made mine into 1" balls and flattened them. Then I dipped half the cookie in the choclate/shortening mixture THEN rolled the edge of the cookie (with the chocolate on it) into crushed candy cane.. drooool. If you like mint chocolate then you will love the candy cane on it :) Thanks for a great cookie recipe!

i would like to have given 5 stars, but found we needed to add a splash of milk to dough to get logs to hold shape. No other problems, recipe was easy and delicious. My mother gives 5 stars, but she didn't bake them, just ate them. I will absolutely make these again, and especially for parties and events. A very good recipe!

These were tasty, but a bit dry.  Also...  I first tried making the dipping chocolate using butter for the "shortening" and it didn't turn out at all.... so shortening means shortening - when I used Crisco, they coated beautifully.

These turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with them breaking.  Maybe cut the baking time by a minute and they won't be so dry...aka the breaking.  Wonderful cookie!

This recipe is excellent.  I followed it exactly & did not let the bottoms get too brown.  They will truly melt in your mouth!  I did half dipped and the other half lightly drizzled with the chocolate. Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator to help the chocolate set up.

I made these for a wedding reception - what a hit! They were so easy to make and looked so nice on the cookie trays. And everyone raved about them. I'm making them again for 
Christmas cookie trays.

Amazing cookie! I forgot to add the mini chips into the first batch, but both with and without them, they're delicious.  The only problem I had with them is that more than half the batch broke while I was dipping them.  I waited until they cooled to take off cookie sheet as called for, but many broke.. maybe that's a positive thing because I had to eat all of those ones!

It's true!  I made this for a holiday cookie exhange and won both "best use of chocolate" and the grand daddy award for "best over all cookie".  It pleased both the adult and children judges.  I dipped the ends 3 different ways...assuring to garner the votes of the various judges. Ha!  I dipped some in just plain chocolate on both ends, some in chocolate with nuts and the remainder in chocolate then in red and white non pareil balls which made for a festive, eye catching cookie.  The recipe is good the way it is but it is a fairly soft dough because of the shortbread texture so be cautious.  The chocolate dip using shortening was perfect and melted nicely in the microwave. Be sure to try this recipe and make sure you have the red and white non pareils to top it off.  It's a winner!

I forgot to add the chocolate chips in the cookie dough, BUT, they turned out perfect! They were firm, and the contrast from the white shortbread dough and the chocolate ends with the nuts..made them look so nice.  After trying them I am glad I forgot to add the choc. chips, as I would have found them too chocolately.... Very nice cookie presentation for parties and cookie exchanges.

Easy, quick, and got devoured in an instant.  I'm glad I tried one of these BEFORE I left home, because I came back with an empty plate!  Tons of compliments.

very pretty and tasty. Not as nice as a traditional shortbread recipe and a wee bit drier but still good and will make again. Did not add the chocolate chips as would overpower the cookie. I did roll them out quite petite and found dipping the logs in chocolate at either end and then in crushed pecans was enough added sweetness.

Fantastic recipe!  I can't tell you what my husband said - suffice it to say he loved them.  I cooked them about 4 minutes longer until I saw the bottoms begin to brown a bit and let them cool sufficiently and had very little problem with breakage.  Thanks!

These are one of our family favorite cookies of all time!  These should be called by their proper name, however.  They are called "Jane Flanagan Cookies".

These cookies are awesome.  They are super easy and fast, yet present beautifully.  These will be on all my holiday menus, in gift trays, etc.  Actually, I screwed up the instructions (my error, not the author's) and they still came out sooo good.  My husband said "You can put them in the freezer, but they're not going to last very long!"  I think next time I make them, I will do so without mixing in the chips and make little saucers, then spread the chocolate on top and make a sandwich - basically a rip off of the Milano.  I love this cookie! Update: made the cookies again, minus the mini-chips in the dough.  Rolled into 1 in. balls then flattened into saucers.  After baking I dipped them in chocolate, then into chopped white chocolate.  They looked awesome and tasted really good, but everyone like the first batch (with choc. chips) better.  I'll make them both ways again.

Divine!  Shortbread is heaven on its own, but add chocolate---PARADISE.  I didn't even decorate the ends (drizzle or dip), and they were still great.  Instead of rolling them into "ropes", I patted/rolled the dough into a 2-inch wide rectangle, then cut it every half inch, making "matchsticks" instead of "ropes".  I will definitely make these again!

Substitute vegan margarine (Earth Balance is good) and vegan chocolate chips and these make some tasty vegan cookies.

I have been making these for a few years- always a hit.  Some tips- cookies are fragile.  Be sure to follow directions to cool completely  before removing from cookie sheets.  Chilll them before dipping into chocolate to prevent breakage.  I suggest using insulated cookie sheets to prevent the bottoms from getting too brown.  I make more chocolate dpping sauce than receipt calls for.

Delicious!  I made the logs.  I chopped up one cup of Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips for use in the dough and melted down another cup to dip the cookies in.  I dipped it in the chocolate long ways and then dipped the front in the chopped walnuts.  Not only do they taste amazing, they are gorgeous too.  Big hit with everyone.  Definitely a keeper.

Great cookies. Make sure you handle with care when dipping in chocolate because they break easily.

These are one of my favorite cookies to give at Christmas time.  They are so delicate and look so decorative vs. plain old round cookies.  Very yummy!!

Excellent cookies, very easy to make. Use high quality ingredients and you'll have amazing shortbread. I rolled mine in chopped almonds instead of walnuts and they were very good. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I decided no to make logs -- just regular shaped cookies and I only had regular sized chocolate chips so I just chopped them up a bit and they were fine. I skipped the whole dipping step. The entire family LOVED them. They melted in your mouth. This one will definately go in my recipe box!

I thought the cookies were just ok: abit bland and not tasting like any shortbread I had before. I would have given them 3 stars if it wasn't for the chocolate/nuts dipping. I dipped half of the batch in chopped pecans and the other half in caramel chips: good cookies but nothing out of this world.

First, let me say that the end result is very tasty.  I do not like overly sweet cookies, so these are perfect for me.  I had a horrible cooking day, though.  First, the dough was too delicate and sticky to roll into nice logs.  Added about 1/4 cup flour.  Too floury, so I added a little more sugar and another tsp. of vanilla.  The dough was finally manageable and tasty.  I still couldn't get pretty rolls out of them, so I made flattened rounds, about the size of vanilla wafers.  I got 49 cookies of that size out of my batch.  (Baked at 325 degrees for 10-11 minutes.  Texture was perfect.)

I half-dipped the cookies and tried to drizzle white chocolate on top.  I must have a bad case of Christmas nerves, because even that went wrong.  (I'm an artist and it HAD to be perfect.)  So, even though I was very frustrated at the end, the cookies themselves are attractive and very good.  I'll try making them again after the holidays.  I'm sure I'll do better next time.

I loved this recipe!  I made them rounds instead of logs Also, I omitted the chocolate chips in the cookies, but just dipped them instead  I used regular sugar instead of the confectioner's, too and it was fabulous!  Alot less crumbling!

Great cookies!  I made these twice this past week, and they are really quick and easy to prepare.  The second time around, I did not dip them in chocolate, as I knew the people for whom I was preparing them would be overwhelmed by all the chocolate :-) and they still turned out deliciously.  There is plenty of butter in the cookies; if you use a non-stick cookie sheet, you do NOT need to grease it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These were AMAZING!  Instead of dipping just the end of the log in chocolate, I just poured the frosting all over them :)  I brought these to a party and there wasn't one left at the end of the night! I will definately make these again.

Wow, these cookies were SOOOO easy and good!  Instead of dipping them, I melted high quality white chocolate and, using a fork, drizzled the chocolate over them.  These were not only delicious, but VERY BEAUTIFUL cookies.  A lovely addition to my cookie tins.

Look and taste very elegant/fancy, which makes them perfect for gifts or cookie trays.  Sometimes instead of nuts, I roll in sprinkles or other confections to match the current season.

My mother makes these and they're INCREDIBLE. Sometimes dipping it in the chocolate is a bit much chocolate, so you may want to just to drizzle chocolate and forget the nuts. I like them best a couple minutes out of the oven before they've completely cooled, but a cookie sheet isn't the best serving platter :)

Next time I think I would use less chocolate chips, or substitute
 the ones in the batter for pecans.  Overall, they were a HUGE hit, 
and I will for sure be making these again soon.

As the manager for the Newark Academy Softball team the girls ask me to bake cookies for them after the game. This year when I asked them if they'd like a different type of cookie they said no, they only wanted this one. Seventeen girls and coaches can't be wrong.

I made them cookie shaped, flat (1/3 in. thick) and round (a little more than 1 in across) instead of logs. And I used white chocolate instead of milk. In addition to mixing in chips, I placed the chip on top serving as a decoration.

This is by far the best cookie that I and anyone who's had one has ever tasted. Easy to make too.

I had to make a few changes based on what I had in the house. So I'm giving the recipe a five because I think if I could have followed it strictly, it definitely would've been a five-star cookie. With just one cup of chocolate chips handy, I decided to substitute a quarter cup of the flour for a quarter cup of baking cocoa and save the chips for melting and dipping the cookies after they were baked. I also didn't have walnuts so I chopped up a cup of almonds very fine. In spite of these alterations, the cookies are light, buttery and delicious!

This was an easy recipe. It turned out great and IS very crumbly so be careful to let them cool first. I don't really like thickness of these though. It's too much cookie that tastes bland with some chocolate on it. I will amend the recipe next time to copy, somewhat, the popular shortbread found in the store.

Very easy to make and tasty too.  For half of the cookies, I just dipped one end into the chocolate; for the other half of the cookies, I just left plain.  Tasty, either way.

These are very good, but also very hard to work with.  The dough seemed fine to mold, and shape, but when they were done, they fell apart so easily.  I might try them in another form instead of logs.

Excellent, excellent recipe. The cookies are buttery and crisp. I modified it a bit by adding 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and white and dark chocolate chips. My only concern is that the log shaped cookies spread a little more than I desired. This made dipping the cookies impossible, but they are just as good with a chocolate drizzle. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I've been trying to make a good shortbread cookie for my New Zealand guy and this wasn't it.  Dough had to be refrigerated every 9 cookies (so that they were "rollable").  I thought they were kind of bland.  This was definitely not my favorite shortbread cookie recipe.

Something apparently went awry.  My bars were so crumbly, I couldn't pick them up.  I tried to dip a portion of one and the weight of the chocolate tore it apart right over the double boiler.

I just got back from Maui and brought some chocolate coconut covered macadamia nuts.  Chopped these up and mixed them in instead of chocolate chips.  Dipped in melted milk chocolate and rolled in coconut!  I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar, upped the vanilla and threw in a pinch of salt.  They were to die for!  People at work told me they were the best cookies ever!

These are awesome! Instead of dipping them in chocolate though, I drizzle them with it! Yummy!

I was lazy (and running out of chocolate chips) so I altered this recipe a bit. :) I shaped the dough into small balls which I flattened with a glass dipped in icing sugar. I also did not dip the cookies in chocolate or sprinkle them with nuts. But the cookies, without being dipped or nutted, were still really good! I used regular-size semi-sweet chocolate chips and beat them up in the Magic Bullet for a bit, so there were yummy chocolate specs as well as chips all through the cookies! My daughter liked these, thank you so much for sharing.

Oh wow these were awesome...the cookie part is fantastic and melts in your mouth, and the chocolate and nuts (I used pecans) on the one end just make this cookie perfect. There's nothing that could make it better. They look SO pretty and they taste just incredible...a new cookie cookie staple at my place.

These may be my favorite cookies of all time; not too sweet and seem to melt in your mouth.  My variation: put in some almond extract in addition to vanilla and substituted the choco chips with ground almonds.  After cooled, I then topped with dulce de leche or chocolate and dipped in finely ground fresh coconut and/or almonds.  Exceptional base recipe with so many options.  THANK YOU!!!

Easy and delicious!  My boyfriend LOVES these...even without the chocolate topping!  The butter is the key.  Don't skimp and use butter flavored shortening (learn from my mistake as I was short butter when making a double batch so I split it), as you don't get the same 'shortbread' richness. I also find that I had to double the ingredients to make a decent batch.  I've tried a few other ingredients too.  I've made it with crushed Macademia nuts instead of mini chocolate chips in the cookie, and also for the topping when using chips in the cookie.  I've also used regular chips instead of mini and it works fine. Instead of dipping one end, I find it easier, and cleaner, to just dip the top of the cookie lenghtwise in the chocolate, and then dip it again in whatever topping. (Coconut works, and tastes great too!)  That way, you get the chocolate and topping in every bite!  That is, if you can manage to eat one of these in two bites!  Have fun trying.  I like this recipe because even if I don't have what the original recipe calls for, I always seem to have something in the cupboard that will work!

I made this for a cookie exchange a few weeks ago and they turned out great :)
make sure you follow the instructions and let them cool on the sheet.  If you get overly eager and try to take them off too early they will crumble. 
Only thing I changed was I used decors and sprinkles instead of nuts because we aren't big on walnuts :)

These cookies are SO good.  My husband just loved them.  For a variation, I may halve the chocolate chips next time and substitute them with finely chopped walnuts.  But this recipe is great as is.

This is truly a great-tasting cookie!  I love how it melts in the mouth and is so light!  The overall taste is heavenly.  I had problems with how fragile the logs were...they'd break when I'd dip them in the melted chocolate.  So, I'm wondering maybe if the melted chocolate was a thinner consistency, or if more powdered sugar were added to the dough...?  Going to make these adjustments on the next batch, and see if they can be tweaked to hold up better.  Thanks, Rhonda!  They sure are tasty!

These were delicious, easy, and pretty too.  I took them to a cookie exchange party, where there were several other shortbread type cookies and I think these were the best.

I'm thrilled to find an egg free cookie (my son is allergic) that looks and tastes as good as regular cookies.

These cookies turned out beautifully! The whole family ate 'em up and I finally had to put some of them in the freezer so we would have some for Christmas. The only thing I did differently was add extra shortening to make my chocolate dip. With one tablespoon it was still so thick I was afraid the cookies would break. They were equally delicious rolled in nuts, in chocolate or with nothing at all. Thanks Rhonda!

Nice recipe.  Will definitely use again.  I melted the left over chips and mixed a little vegetable oil in,  and drizzled it on top then threw some finely chopped pecans on top.  They look nice, but as another reviewer said- "when they say shortening, they mean shortening".  Still - I am happy with how they came out - yes a little dry, but they are shortbread, which has a different consistency than regular chocolate chip cookies.  I will be saving this recipe.

I really like these. They are easy to make. I like to mix up this recipe with other flavors of extract(usually 2 tsp.)and I like to mix in dark chocolate chips. Instad of making logs I just form them into balls.

Wow... wonderful cookies, and very easy to make. The cookies in this pic look  chocolate, but mine look more like a chocolate chip cookie log... perhaps they melted the chocolate chips in this photo? Make sure your butter is soft, and the dough will be very easy to work with...

Well, apparently I made these rather large, as I had to bake them for 20 minutes.  And they didnt' fall apart, except one when I was a tad enthusiastic with the chocolate.  But, they worked well enough so perhaps next time I'll roll out the dough then cut into pieces--that might work better for me.  Still, very nice cookies.  I love shortbread but am not a fan of chocolate so much--I think, however, they are a good addition to my cookie tins.  Hubs enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe.

They were good but I think they would be better with a little more sugar and less choclate chips.  I did not add the additional choclate drizzle on top and I still thought it was too much choclate

I have never made shortbread cookies so I read the reviews prior to making them. I decided to make them into balls and flatten them. Then I dipped the cookies in milk chocolate and sprinkled with crushed candy cane! I also did some dipped in milk chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate! What a great cookie to look at! I thought they were yummy but also couldn't get more than 2 dozen from the recipe.

These were relaly easy to make and tasted great.  I think next time I make them I will do as another reviewer suggested and make small round cookies and dip helf in the chocolate.  I found it really hard to dip both sides.  Also I used a nut topping instead of walnuts since I don't really like them.  These were the first of all my holiday cookies to disappear.

I'd give it more Stars if I could! These were by far the BEST Cookies I have ever made, and far better than store-bought!
Just make sure you really wait for them to cool completely before removing them from the Baking Sheet! Also, after dipping the ends in the Chocolate, I sprinkled the Nuts on top rather than rolling the Logs in them. 
There are so many other Variations of this I must try, there are so many Possibilities! 
Update: I made another batch last night, but I made them flat and dipped half in melted white Chocolate. Today I made them with dried Cranberries instead of Chocolate Chips and Orange Extract instead of the Vanilla. Then I also added a little Orange Extract in the melted Chocolate! Yum!

Wow did these ever take a while to get down, but oh so worth it.  I didn't know how thick to make the 2.5 inch "logs" and so there was some muddling around - finally realized I only had like 29 rolls, so had to go back and re-roll the logs!  Baking them was just fine - no problem - they were slightly brown and I let them cool and they were nice and crisp - no trouble with breakage at all.  The problem came with dipping - I'm not used to doing this and it took some commitment to get it just so.  I confess my first batch I just dipped one side.  The other problem was my walnut pieces were too big out of the bag - and when I went to pulse them in the food processor, they then became too small.  This time (tomorrow) I'm going to hit them with a mallet and try to get them just right!  To make a long story longer, hubby ate one cookie and promptly asked me to make a batch for his work!!!  He has NEVER asked me to do such a thing in all our years together (15).  Tomorrow I'm going to use half chocolate dipping ends and half peanut butter for dipping.  Yumillee!!!!

I was concerned reading reviews on breaking, texture, etc. I made them per recipe (included 2 tbls brown sugar) and they were FABULOUS! 10 minutes was perfect, I was able to use a spatula to move them immediately off the cookie sheet with no problems. These are my new favorite cookie!!

These were GREAT! I don't know why everyone has problems with them falling apart, my only suggestion would be to cook them until they are starting to brown ( just slightly) and let them COOL all the way before dipping.  I had cub scouts make these they were alot of fun!

I made these for my christmas cookie tins and was very pleased with the end result. Melt in your mouth kind of cookie with good texture. I also added skor baking chips along with the mini chocolate chips. Sooo rich!!  I omitted the nuts at the end and just left them with the plain chocolate dip.

Really yummy!  I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts because I had them on hand.  And I just microwaved the chocolate and shortening for dipping because I don't have a double boiler.  I definitely did not get 4 dozen cookies out of this recipe though, only 2 dozen.

Um, WOW!  This is the first shortbread recipe that I've made and it was not only easy but also a no fail recipe.  I didn't have chocolate chips on hand but had Ande's chocolate mint baking pieces.  I used those in the logs and melted chocolate bars for dipping half of the log.  I knew that shortening would have been the ideal ingrediant with the chocolate for dipping, but used butter because I didn't have shortening. It worked fine.  I know, not very prepared. :-)  I think that's a great idea with the crushed candy cane.  Thank you Rhonda for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Excellent!  I didn't dip the cookies in the extra chocolate because my husband wanted them to be plain, but we both found that they still had plenty of chocolate flavour.  Actually, he requested that I not put as many chocolate chips in next time, but I thought they were great as is.

I took these cookies to our Church social and they where a huge hit.  I added a 1/4 Brown Surgar to the mix and left out the nuts on the dipping end.

Not impressed at all with the flavor of this cookie.  I LOVE shortbread and have found that it is very difficult to find a good shortbread.  This wasn't it.  I will stick to my old recipe.  This just didn't have a GOOD shortbread flavor.

These cookies are delicious!  The walnut toppings are great, but if you are looking for something different, drizzle white chocolate over the semi-sweet for a very pretty treat.  Rhonda, thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of the best cookies I have ever tried. It has become my favorite. I didn't change a thing except to dip them in milk chocolate instead of semi.

These are amazing!  Melt in your mouth.  The cookie itself was incredibly easy to make; dipping in the chocolate and nuts was a little messy, but well worth the work and cleanup.  I brought 100 of these to work and they were gone in no time.  Now one of my favorites.

Wonderful!!  I love this recipe not only because it is good as is but you can vary the ingredents to get different tastes.  I tried toffee bits in place of the chocolate chips yum yum!  I think I must have made these way big though because I only got a little over 2 dozen from the amounts listed.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  Instead of dipping in the walnuts at the end, I drizzle white chocolate in streaks over the darker chocolate after it sets.  The white chocolate can be colored for different holidays.

I just made these tonight and it's AMAZING!! my dad who usually won't eat any cookie had one and went back for seconds and thirds!! I didn't add any choc chips into the mixture. I had some plain, some drizzled with chocolate, some half-coated with chocolate and coated with almond flakes - the combination is gorgeous! I melted the choc chips on HIGH in the microwave and then coated the cookies - it worked well even without shortening. I had to watch the baking time - don't let the bottoms get too brown!!

Recipe sounds great, but 1 question. Do you really cook in solid log or do you form dough into log, slice into cookies & then cook?

Thanks,

I expected great things based on the reviews.  These are good, but not great.  They make a great presentation, but their flavor is kind of dull.

I thought the recipe was ok.  It was a bit too chocolately for me and the cookie was kinda 
bland.  Wasn't bad though.  Maybe if you added real sugar instead of powdered
it would taste better????

Very good shortbread with a chocolate twist.  Fun for children to make logs and dip.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  Plus they look very impressive.  Be careful not to 
bake them too long, once they are too brown they completely lose their taste and 
consistency.

I have been baking for several years now.  I have tried many chocolate chip recipes.  This one is outrageous!.  It is similar to bakery butter cookies.  The flavor is wonderful, texture is light yet solid enough to hold chips.  Easy to prepare, and soooo very good.  Thank you Rhonda.. Sha1117.
