I was looking for a granola bar without any added sugar ( honey/corn syrup)when I came across this yummy recipe. 
Great as is. I will definitely make this again.

This is a must make staple if you're a raw vegan. Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out amazingly. My kids are the pickiest eaters and and they eat this up!!

I made these exactly as written, the water wasn't needed. I sprinkled a few coca nibs on the bars and dusted with coco powder as suggested by the submitter.  When I reviewed this the measurement for the almonds was missing so I referred back to the original recipe, it should read 1 cup. Thanks for the recipe.
