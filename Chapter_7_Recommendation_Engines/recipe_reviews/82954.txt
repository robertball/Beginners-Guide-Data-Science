Loved it.  I have made it twice and served it to guests. I changed it slighlty because I like things really spicy. I used a whole package of Chipotly flavored tace seasoning in my cornbread and used only the HOT enclilada sauce (no tomato sauce). I also added onion.     Betty QC, AZ

I used my own homemade cornbread and my own version of the Red Enchilada sauce, which is also from this site. I did add a couple spices (cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, coriander, pepper, chili powder) and I used all enchilada sauce. I did not add extra salt as there was enough to taste in the enchilada sauce. I used the amount called for in the recipe, cooked the meatballs until they were browned, then poured off the grease and then poured the enchilada sauce-cheese mixture over the top. I baked it for another ten minutes so I could soak up some of that sauce. We all liked this way more than I thought we would have, even my husband who balked at eating this for dinner. Super easy, even using my own homemade ingredients instead of shortcut foods. I'll make this again for sure. Really genius idea, Shelly!

These were excellent and a big hit at the superbowl party.  I followed other reviews and added about a half packet of taco seasoning to the meat and a half of a diced onion sauteed.  Baked in a 9x13 pan for the first 20 minutes to render off most the fat, than transfered them to a nice dish.  Topped with homemade enchilada sauce (no tomato sauce) sprinkled with the cheese and put back in the oven for another 5 min.  Served with toothpicks.  Will definately make these again.

As suggested, I added some chopped onions. Although we enjoyed this and thought it was very good, my initial thought was that it reminded me of meatloaf... I missed the additional note of adding taco seasoning to the cornbread mix; so next time I'll do that, or skip the tomato sauce and increase the amount of enchilada sauce. Otherwise, I'll definitely be making this again.

Really yummy. I served this as a main meal over steamed white rice, just added more enchilada sauce. I also couldnt find cornmeal in our supermarket, so i used 1 cup of crushed up savory corn chips.

Yum-yum! I made these as a meal also. Throw in a side of spanish rice and you're ready. Next time I make them I am planning to chop some onions finely to kick it up.

I used ground turkey vs ground beef.  These were quite good and simple to make.  A good spicey flavor, but not overly so.  I sprinkled chopped onion over the meatballs when they were nearly done and then sprinkled with grated cheese.  Served with guacamole and cole slaw. Will definitely make again.

We had these as meatball sandwiches.  They were very good.  I think, next time, I will omit the tomato sauce and use all enchilada sauce...and HOT, because we like things spicy.

These were good, I chopped up some onion and a jalapeno, sauteed and added to the meatballs. Also added a package of taco seasoning. Really good with a little shredded cheddar on top.

This is a great meal! It is simple, and easy to make gluten free. We use all ench. sauce rather than tomato sauce, add taco seasoning, and corn chex due to time constraints. What a great meal idea!! thanks for sharing!

UPDATE: I am not a leftover fan, but these tasted just as good if not better the next day! Yum! These were much better than I expected. My fiance gave these an A+ (which is AWESOME!!!). I was able to enjoy something I love (enchiladas) while appeasing my enchilada-hating fiance (he doesn't like saucy tortillas - aka enchiladas). This has been a busy weekend. It just zoomed by. Today was the only time I set aside for a home-cooked meal amongst all the chaos, but it still had to be something quick. This met my expectations exactly! And, contrary to most reviewers' suggestions to use all enchilada sauce or a different ratio of tomato / enchilada sauce, I thought the proportions as is were spot on. Out of necessity, I subbed cheddar-pepperjack cheese for Mexican cheese blend (my cornbread recipe called for pepperjack cheese, but my grocer only sold it as a blend, hence the decision to use that in my meatballs also). Oh, and I heeded Shellye's advive and added taco seasoning to my cornbread and am glad I did. Of course, if you pruchase pre-baked cornbread, you could add this directly to your meatball mixture.... It definitely steps these up a notch, IMHO. Served with Mexican rice and my homemade Mexican cornbread, this was an excellent meal. I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks Shelley! :-)

These were great, with a few additions. I added fresh garlic, ancho chili powder and cumin to the mix, and topped the finished meatballs with some chopped raw onion and cotija cheese.

I made without any changes.  It was for my dh, I do not eat meat.  He said it was a bit bland.  I would've added more seasoning (maybe some garlic, onion, etc), but wanted to try it as written as he tends to like simple things :-)  If he thought it was bland...well, I'd definitely spice it up if you are trying.  I served it over rice with onions and green peppers that I sauteed.  He doesnt like taco seasoning, so I didnt try adding any to the cornbread, but I bet that would add some flavor.

I used two other recipes from this site to make this recipe: "Golden Sweet Cornbread" (highly recommended!), and "Texas Enchilada Sauce." When I read the reviews, particularly those talking about the cornbread's sweetness coming through in the meatballs, I was concerned. But it was actually very nice: the sweetness is the perfect counterbalance to the sauce (which needed a little sugar to balance it out, but for use in this recipe, I'm glad I resisted the urge to add it). My only real complaint here is that the large amount of cornbread gives the meatballs a mushy texture. I would make them again, but definitely cut the cornbread back to between 1 cup and 1 1/2 cups.

Everyone loves these meatballs.  I don't add the taco seasoning but otherwise  follow the recipe exactly  Have fixed them for years every Christmas Eve.  I put them in a crock pot after they are cooked.  Add the sauce and cheese, serve with toothpicks.

Very salty! In the future i would use low sodium tomato sauce and add my own mexican seasonings. Between the cheese and the enchilada sauce I needed a gallon of water after.

Awesome!! My husband said they were the best meatball ever. Quite a compliment since he prides himself on the best meatball maker ever. Really loved the cornbread, gave it a really nice texture. I did add some sauted onion and peppers.

Yum!  We really liked these!  I missed the footnote on the bottom about adding some taco seasoning to the cornbread, I think next time I'll definitely do that.  But, these were good even without it.  I did use all enchilada sauce instead of half that and half tomato sauce.  I poured the sauce into a sauce pan and then added the meatballs once they were done baking and let it come to a simmer.  I served them over rice and sprinkled with cheese.  Very good!

This was GREAT!  I made the cornbread the night before (so I would cut down on the time) and left out the tomato sauce as others suggested (ended up using about 1 1/2 cans of enchilada sauce).  I added some dried, minced onion as well.   Oh, and definetly make sure you add the taco seasoning to the cornbread and the meat mixture.  I had a box of the hamburger helper cheesy enchilada mix (I'm not sure why I had this because I am not a fan of the boxed dinners) so I just made the rice part and it was a great compliment to the meatballs.  This was deemed a huge hit by the whole family.

Very good, as others suggested I, too, used all enchilada sauce (the Ten Minute Enchilada sauce from this site). I also added a diced small onion. Served this for dinner with black beans and rice and the remaining corn bread. Will definitely be making this again.

I totally loved this dish, I added a little chili power and garlic powered to the meat, I didn't have any trouble getting the meat balls to hold together I only added enough of the sauce so that they would hold together when it was done I put it in a bowl sprinkled the cheese on it and put it in the oven to melt the cheese.  I served with with mexican rice and a salad.  This dish was a total hit!

Good recipe, on the sweet side maybe because of the corn bread?  Sweet is a little different for a meatball in my opinion.  But I like this idea - maybe next time I'll use taco seasoning and make them more taco flavored.

I was looking for something new to make with ground beef and found this recipe; I'm glad I did. The meatballs were moist and delicious! I used premade cornbread from my grocery store to save some time and some other suggestions from previous reviewers.  I added 1 pkg. taco seasoning and finely chopped onions to the mix and only used enchilada sauce. I served mine for dinner with mexican rice and corn tortillas - the family loved them; told me this is a keeper and it is!

No one complained about these, but I thought they were just ok. A nice change of pace from regular meatballs. We had this for dinner w/ rice & cornbread muffins. I might make again when in a bind.

I was skeptical of this recipe but though it was a creative twist, so glad I tried it because it was great. I followed others suggestions and after the meatballs were cooked through simmered them in just enchilada sauce, no tomato sauce. I served this over cilantro and tomato rice. Delicious!

I loved this recipe for a tasty Tex-Mex alternative to traditional Italian meatballs. As others suggested I omitted the tomato sauce and used all enchilada sauce...half of the can in the meat mixture and the other half spooned over the cooked meatballs.  I omitted the salt, added 2 tablespoons taco seasoning, a minced jalapeno pepper and 1/2 of a small onion finely chopped. I substituted crushed tortilla chips for the crumbled cornbread, and it gave the meatballs a "tamale" taste (also a great way to use up the "crumbs" of chips at the bottom of the bag). Next time I may use the entire can of enchilada sauce to coat the cooked meatballs as adding it to the meat mixture made forming the meatballs a bit sticky and messy. Served with Spanish style rice and tossed salad. Muy bien!

Good recipe! I made the cornbread with 5 T of taco seasoning to kick it up a bit. I made up 2 trays of meatballs and still had meat left over so stuck it into muffin cups and made mini meatloaves - AWESOME! I think next time I will just do the mini meatloaf route because I hate shaping meatballs :)

Just OK.  The meatballs did not hold together very well, and it was a little bland.  Went well with chips and salsa.

These were excellent !!! I put in some Adobo seasoning and an egg and some cumin !! Terrific. I thought they would be too much enchilada flavored but they were nice and mild but flavorful !! Will make again often !! Cornbread was the secret !!

These were excellent and very easy. I added a package of taco seasoning to the meat mixture, for some extra flavor. Will make time and time again!Great party appetizer. I used spicy rotel tomato sauce. Take the time to bake your own cornbread. Second time I made them, i used store bought cornbread....way to moist, the meatballs did not cook right.

I liked it but I didn't love it. It was very easy to make. I found my meatballs fell apart some after baking. The only change I made was I used 1 1/2 cups cornbread but other than that followed directions exactly.

Very good. I used ground turkey, and they were very tasty. Our young children wouldn't like the enchilada sauce over top, so I made some without the extra sauce for them. We all liked them plain dipped in salsa. I too added onion and taco seasoning to the meat as well as an egg to bind the turkey together. I browned them in a non-stick skillet before putting them in the oven (for a bit of color). BTW, LOVE the cornbread in these. We ate the rest of the cornbread as a side at dinner. We'll be having these again. Big success! Thanks for the cool idea.

Made these with ground turkey, instead of beef and opted for smashed corn chips (as one reviewer suggested) instead of corn bread because its what I had on hand. Absolutely delicious recipe loved by young and old.

The cornbread makes these addictive. I generally doctor up the enchilada sauce or use something else. Enchilada sauce just seems so bland.

We love this recipe.  I don't change a thing except to leave out the salt.  Since I have a couple of younger ones I just use mild enchilada sauce and the kids gobble it up.  Definitely a keeper.

Super yummy!  I was looking for a "different" appetizer to bring to a Cinco De Mayo party and thought I'd try this out.  Great tip on the box of cornbread and I used all enchilada sauce as one reviewer suggested.  Instead of adding cumin and onions, I simply added a package of taco seasoning mix along with cilantro and it was delicious.  Some people may think it's too spicy or flavor intense, but those of us in LA love our spicy Mexican food!  The meatballs were very moist and really easy to make.  Thanks, Shelley!

My whole family loved these! I used gluten free cornbread for the crumbs, and served it over steamed rice, making a great gluten-free dinner! Sides were tortilla chips and a green salad.

The idea of this recipe was better than the taste.  The cornbread flavor got lost, and that was what attracted me to it initially.

I'm rating it as a 4 as written, and a 5 with my additions and tweaks. Great base recipe there is no doubt and love that I found a new use for leftover cornbread. I did add about a 1/4 cup of grated onion for that subtle flavor, eliminated the salt and also added 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning mix. I also decreased the amount of crumbs to 1 1/2 C. rather than 2 C. It seemed to be the perfect consistency.  It was the right amount of flavor that it seemed to lack. Rather than a Mexican blend of cheese, I used about 3/4 C of grated cojita cheese and mixed all the ingredients together, used my 1" cookie scoop to make uniform sized meatballs, baked for 22 minutes and then simmered in the enchilada sauce. Great as an appetizer or part of the dinner entree. I served with refried beans, Mexican Rice II from here, and fresh hot tortillas. Excellent!

Super easy and good!  It was even easier since I already had leftover corn bread made.  Used a medium enchilada sauce next time I think I will use hot!

Good recipe. I agree w/ some changes it is better. I decreased the amount of cornbread. I used some Taco seasoning to my meat mixture to kick it up a notch. I did not use tomato sauce. I only used more enchilada sauce. Next time I will put some chopped onions in it. I served over Spanish rice and a side of corn. Good dinner idea.

Delish meal when served on top of Spanish rice.   Followed recipe exactly, expect added meatballs to heated sauce after cooking vs pouring sauce on top

I love that people write reviews!!   I read through them and followed someones advice and used taco seasoning in the corn bread, so glad I did.  I made these the night before my party to save time.  I microwaved the meatballs for a few minutes then added them to the sauce to finish heating them up.  I transferred them to a crock pot to keep them warm through the party.  When I tasted the sauce it was a little too mild for me so I added what I had, buffalo wing sauce.  I used about 3/4 cup and it added a nice zing!  Everyone raved about them!  I'll definately be making these again!

I changed it up a bit-added jalapenos and chilis and used corn bread stuffing.  I also added an egg to make sure the meatballs stayed together.  Served it over rice and  beans.  Taste was really good though I couldn't seem to get the meatballs to firm up.  Not sure what I did wrong.  My husband enjoyed it and that was my goal.

Really tasty!  I used cornbread stuffing and added the taco seasoning to the stuffing crumbs.  Used only enchilada sauce so I omitted the additional salt.  Also minced an onion and added to the ground beef.  I used lean ground beef, not chuck. Served with Mexican rice and black beans.  I think any variation or customization of this recipe would work out well--its a great basic recipe!

Ymmm, I also skipped the tomato sauce and used 2 cans of enchilada sauce.  To make my gluten free cornbread, I don't use expensive mixes, I just use 2 cups of cornmeal and leave out the flour.  Comes out perfect everytime and it is much cheaper!  The taco seasoning is a nice touch in the cornbread; will be great with chili or stew.

What a great solution to craving enchiladas but not having any tortillas on hand.  So yummy!  Making them again tonight even though I now have tortillas.

I made these meatballs last year for a Cinco de Mayo party, and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe!  I made of box of Jiffy cornbread mix, and crumbled that.  Next time I might even try mixing in some corn, rice, or beans!

very different and quite tasty.  Serve over Spanish rice and use HOT enchilada sauce if you want a kick to off-set the sweet cornbread flavor.  We like these a lot :)

The reviews from family members were all over the place on these, so I'm settling on a 4 star rating.  They were easy enough to make and the flavor was pretty good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Shelley!

Like the other posters....I used this good idea as a base to tweak furhter. I had one corn muffin as letovers and used that....was = to 1/2 cup cornbread for the 1# of ground beef that I had on hand. I think 1/2 cup would be enough regardless of what I had on hand as 1/2 c of breadcrumbs is what I normally put in my regular meatballs to a pound of meat. I added 1 egg to the mix because again...that is what goes in my regular meatballs to hold them together. Since a lot of posters thought the meatballs were bland I used Adobo seasoning in place of the salt.

These were very good, but I could only award it 4 stars because I added my own seasoning to the sauce to give it more flavor.  The meatballs themselves were bland, so I would add additional seasoning to those the next time I make them--probably some cumin and red pepper flakes.  Chopped onions would also be a good addition to the meat mixture.  I added taco seasoning, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes to the sauce as well.  Will definitely make them again!

Very easy to make. I added taco spices; we like spicy food here in Denver. I used extra jar enchilada sauce in place of the extra tomato sauce for more mexican flavor. I also used a casserole dish instead of a cookie sheet, which worked out just fine. Very good.

I make these about twice a month because it is one of the few things that my picky eaters will eat.  I do not use the tomato sauce though.  I add half of the enchilada sauce to my hamburger meat and use a packet of taco seasoning as well.  Then I pour the rest of the enchilada sauce over the meatballs after they are done cooking and top with the rest of the shredded cheese.  I usually serve this over yellow rice.

Huge hit at our home, kids and husband loved them.  The only modification I made was that I omitted the tomato sauce and used 2 cans of enchilada sauce.  I'll try this as a mini meatloaf next to keep prep time lower.  Loved it!

Excellent! We all loved these, my sons especially.  I made my own cornbread and enchilada sauce and used 10oz of that rather than using any tomato sauce.  I also used a ground beef & ground pork mix - oh and i sauteed a half onion diced and mixed that in too.  We will definitely have these often!

You can not possible know how happy I am to find this recipe. My son is allergic to gluten and can not have regular meatballs. This recipe has corn meal instead of flour so he can eat rice noodles and meatballs.

I had barely finished baking these meatballs and my BF wouldn't stop eating them!  I used ground turkey instead of chuck and they were amazing.  The sauce needed some tweaking to suit our tastes being a bit heavy on the tomato flavor.

We really liked these.  The sauce added a nice kick.  I added some fresh chopped onions to the meatballs like others suggested.  I also added some taco seasoning to the sauce.

This recipe was delicious and very kid friendly.  My boys (ages 1 and 3) both loved it.   Next time I will add a little garlic and onion to the meatballs for a little extra flavor.

These weren't bad; they just weren't all that exciting.  I added some chopped onion and a tablespoon of minced garlic.  These don't compare to my favorite meatball recipe on this website, Cajun Appetizer Meatballs.  Those absolutely rock!

My family LOVED these! I did add 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning to the meat and then to the sauce. Served them with rice and even my super picky 3 year old gobbled them up!

These are so yummy.  I didn't have taco seasoning on hand, so I added about 1tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of cumin to the cornbread mixture before adding the meat.  I also topped with green onions and drizzled sour cream on them.

I found the carbs to be much higher than shown.  Also prefer to use 20 oz. of enchilada sauce and omit the tomato sauce.  I found an enchilada sauce made with chiles and no tomato.  The taco seasoning was a bit strong, thinking of making it again with 1/2 as much.  I put a package of Stove Top Corn Bread Stuffing in the food processor in place of the cornbread and used ground turkey.  I've made it as meatballs and as a meatloaf, it is excellent and its now a staple in my house.

I used cornbread stuffing mix because that was what I had in the house.  I think that next time I will use a "normal" cornbread mix.
     I enjoyed them greatly wrapped in a flour shell! This was a fabulously quick lunch as leftovers.  We made lots of meatballs and just wrapped them in the flour shells for lunches. 
     I bet they would be great with some enchilda sauce poured over the flour shells with cheese sprinkled on top and heated for a few minutes in the oven!

I loved using cornbread as a filler. Also, I've never had enchilada flavoring with meatballs so this was an enjoyable change. Instead of a half teaspoon of salt, I did a quarter teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of ground chipotle chile pepper. I also put a dash of the chile pepper in the pour-over sauce. Added just a bit of kick. The only possible downside is these cooled quickly. Just something to keep in mind when serving. I'd make these again and maybe jazz up the sauce a bit more.

I goofed & had 3 cups of crumbled cornbread so I upped the meat to 2 pounds. I baked some as the recipe stated, but tried some in my air fryer. Baking was absolutely the way to go for us. The air fryer seemed to cook some of the flavor out I it as well as made it dry. Still both were pretty good. Our family will definitely add this to the menu!

Very Good!  And a nice twist on the usual flavors for meatballs. I added the taco seasoning mix to the mixture and I feel that made the difference in making it even better.  I will most certainly make it again.

I didn't make any changes and I probably won't make it again.  It makes a lot - I made it for a potluck and about half was eaten.  It received good comments, but I had so much left over that my husband and I got tired of it.  I realize I could halve it, but the cornbread makes it kind of sweet and I prefer savory.  I  would consider making it again for a large crowd if I didn't have to bring home the leftovers.  :-)

Recipe was simple and delicious!  We served them on top of spanish rice with a bit of the sauce and cotija cheese.  Made them with a homemade cornbread and it was the perfect amount of moisture and body for the meatballs.  Great recipe!

I made some changes when I made this.  I used Martha White Mexican Style Cornbread. I had also read where others had put taco seasoning in the meat mixture. I did the same but used the whole packet of taco seasoning, when most just used a little. I also saluted a onion & added that to the meat mixture along with 2 minced garlic cloves. The last thing is after the meatballs were almost done I put them in a baking dish poured the tomato & enchilada sauce over them & added cheese on top & baked them for about 10 more minutes.  This was a good recipe that I would make again.

This dish sounded promising, but sadly didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I even followed the tip of making the cornbread and adding taco seasoning to the mix. It was just very bland tasting overall.

I made this with gluten free corn bread mix and it was way, way too sweet.  If I tried again I would make the corn bread from scratch with no sugar.  The sauce was not as spicy  as I usually enjoy and I would also change that part of the recipe.  I may try again with making the above changes as I like meat ball based meals very much.

IT WAS REALLY MOIST!  AND THE CORN BREAD MAKES IT TASTE SWEET.  WISH I WOULD HAVE ADDED A LITTLE BIT MORE SPICES-HOT ENCHILADA SAUCE, PEPPER FLAKES TO GIVE IT MORE OF A BOOST.  BUT NO COMPLAINTS EVERYONE LIKED IT.  THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING THIS AND USING MARINARA SAUCE ON TOP OF NOODLES.

The meatballs were incredible,  loved the addition of the taco seasoning in the cornbread mix for the crumbs, as suggested by another reviewer. We want to try them in soft tacos with taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce. Yum!

Simple and tasty! The cornbread sweetens it up and is my favorite part of the meatball.

I would advise adding a bit of dried oregano and some garlic to the beef mixture.

I made a few modifications: I didn't have crumbled cornbread so I instead used regular italian bread crumbs, I added fresh cilantro to the meatballs, I added onion to the meatballs, I added cotija cheese to the meatballs, and I made my own enchilada sauce (the 15 minute enchilada sauce recipe from this site). This was also very easy to make into a meal prep. Served with rice, sauteed peppers and onions, and freshly diced tomatoes. Turned out great!

I have made this twice. The first time I made it as written and we loved it. The second time I made it with all enchilada sauce which we like a little better only because we love very spicy food. It is 5 star either way.

We did it how the recipe said.  We used sweeter cornbread.  If you're going to make them, I would recommend not using sweet cornbread.....we used Famous Dave's mix, which I love the corn bread, but too sweet for this recipe

Great recipe! The sauce part looked kind of boring so I singed a little red onion and jalapeño in oil and homemade taco seasoning and then put it in a blender with cilantro and tomato sauce and then combined it with the enchilada sauce and rest of tomato sauce.  The meatballs were sooo good!

Would add taco seasoning to cornbread and maybe to chilli or cayenne pepper to the sauce to add a little more flavor. The recipe is very mild in flavor.

Pretty good. I think I'll spice it up a little, next time.  I made the balls about 2" and we put them in tortillas.

I made it as a casserole.  Too much corn bread.  Used it in tacos.  Not the greatest.  Should have stuck to the recipe and made meatballs.  Would use less corn meal.  Combo of tomato and enchilada sauce did not quite make a taste that I like or will repeat.  Will stick to just enchilada sauce by itself and less corn bread.  Idea was good.

Enchilada meatballs came out really good. I served the remaining cornbread, rice and retried beans with the meatballs.  I will be making it again.

This was pretty okay...I did take suggestions and added extra seasonings because canned enchlada sauce is not enough. I also toasted the crumbled cornbread before adding cumin, oregano, chili powder, cayenne, garlic and onion powder to the meat/sauce mixture and let it rest before baking the balls. I just poured the sauce over the balls, turning to coat for the last half of the baking time. Didn't add cheese because of preference. Thank you for a good alternative meal!

I used a large can of enchilada sauce and no tomato sauce.  Loved the flavor but the texture was somewhat mushy.  The next time I will toast the cornbread crumbs first.

I made this as a main dish. I had some cornbread already made that I needed to use and that’s what I did. I did not change the recipe and I made in the 1” size specified. I did not serve it as an appetizer however, I transferred it to a 9 x 13 pan after the meatballs were cooked and put the sauce and cheese on top. I served it with steamed white rice. My grandson 19 years old loved it so much he asked when we could have it again before he finished the first helping! Only change I may incorporate into it next time is to use the green enchilada sauce as I’m not into very much spice. It was still excellent and not too hot. My grandson 19 years old loved it so much he asked when we could have it again before he finished the first helping! Very meaty with outstanding favor, a wonderful hearty comfort food! Highly recommend this!

These were absolutely awful. Meatballs were mushy and bland as was the sauce. Ended up throwing it in the trash.

Taco seasoning does add to the result. I agree with another cook, in that the meatball consistency is rather soft, and is not  very tidy for toothpick/appetizer serving. As an entree with rice would be neater.

I made these meatballs and my family loved them. I didn't' have any cornbread so for breading  I used a bag of croutons that I ground up. Thanks!

I got 36 lmeatballs out of this recipe.  I used lean ground turkey (93/7 fat) and light Mexican cheese.  For the corn bread, I used a boxed mix with eggbeaters.  I added 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning (without chili powder) from AR and mixed thoroughly with the cornbread crumbs before adding the ground turkey.  I highly recommend making the meatball mixture a few hours before baking to allow the flavors to meld.  The meatballs without the sauce were pretty spicy but mild enchilada sauce tamed them down a bit.  We will definitely have again.  We enjoyed the flavors so much we will have in burger form as well.

Very, very good.  I used a homemade enchilada sauce recipe from this site and it made plenty so I didn't need to add the can of tomato sauce to it.  I also added some taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  These were delicious and it was a nice change of pace from marinara sauce to go with meatballs.

Be sure to use either home made cornbread WITHOUT sugar or a non-sweetened mix, not Jiffy, like Mexican cornbread mix.

I followed the advice of other reviews and added some adobo seasoning, and an egg to the meat. I used 20 oz ground turkey and 1 1/2 cups cornbread.  8 oz tomato sauce and 12 oz enchilada because that is what I had.

Good meatballs, but I chance some things. I add 1 can of Enchilade sauce, add one pack of taco seasoning. For the sauce didn't add any tomato sauce, just 1 can of Enchilada sauce and remaining cheese. Next time I am going to add 1 egg in the mixture meatballs were just falling very easly.

this was awesome! made some changes - subbed ground turkey, added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, and used all enchilada sauce (no tomato). cooked it in a baking dish and since i used turkey - there wasn't any grease, poured enchilada sauce on top and added cheese - popped it back in the oven for a couple minutes. served with a side of mexican rice and black beans :)
