I omitted the second meet and added a can of diced tomatoes. I also added lots of italian seasoning. Turned out good and was fast and easy (on the budget as well).

Good and easy- this dinner served 4 with lots of leftovers!
I used chicken instead of beef, added chopped onion and garlic, and used less cheese (just enough to make it stick together). 
Will def make again!

Very good. I cut it down to 5 servings as there is only two of us to feed. I used ground turkey and turkey sausage (to cut down on the fat) and also added about a tablespoon of italian seasoning (which I think is a must or it would be a bit bland). Next time I think I will add extra green pepper and onions and maybe some mushrooms as well.

I used 2 full pounds of ground beef, and 2 cups of cheddar on top because that's what I had. The cheddar was fine, but 2 cups wasn't really enough with this large casserole. Next time I'll add some more cheese, and maybe mix some different kinds in.

This was a nice adaption of baked ziti that I make sometimes.  Adding the cheese and pepperoni on top made it much more appetizing to my picky children!  I used deli provolone because it's what I had on hand.  They renamed this "Provolone and pepperoni pizza pasta".  Thank you for a fun dinner idea!

(If you want to make it a bit more spicy...)
This dish was a really good base recipe. My mom and I cooked it together and instead of the pepperoni, we used ground italian sausage and we browned it with the beef. We added 2 cloves of diced garlic, and sauteed it in a skillet with the onion and pepper.  We used pasta sauce instead of tomato and my mom added italian seasoning, oregano, and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper to give it a kick.  It really is a good dish, but had to tweak quite a bit.

Very good, and easy.  I added sausage to the recipe, which made it a little more time consuming, but it was worth it.

I rated this recipe 3 stars because it's great as a basic recipe but lacked a few more ingredients. Adding a chopped onion and spices while browning the meat went a long way. overall good recipe!

This was awesome!!!!  I substituted pepperoni with salami and used cheddar cheese and didn't use the bell peppers.  I layered the casserole.  I also used double the amount of spaghetti sauce and macaroni noodles instead of ziti.  It turned out delicious!  My family loved it.  Thanks!  :)

This was yummy! The pepperoni in this casserole is a little different, so a nice change. Makes a big casserole - great for left overs.  A big hit with my 17-month old - he had two (toddler-sized) servings!

This was OK.  I could tell by the ingredients that it wouldn't be spicy enough for us so I added some garlic, Italian seasoning, and a little brown sugar.

I loved cooking this delicious cacerole! I can't wait to eat it. It looks awesome. All the ingredients are familiar to me and liked by the family, so there is no way to go wrong with this recipe. I had everything I needed at home. I will just set up my table and enjoy my cacerole with some red wine.

I added my own little twist to it, instead of pepperoni I used italian sausage and added fresh mushrooms, sliced cherry tomatoes & garlic as well as the green peppers, my family enjoyed it but we all agreed it felt like it was missing something... perhaps some italian seasoning is the missing touch but it was good something I will make again in the future :)

Excellent starter, I substituted Italian pork sausage for the beef.  I used a combo or red and green peppers and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the tomatoes sauce with a tsp of oregano.  And lastly i added one large Italian squash cut in long shards.  Very tasty

Love this!  I used 1 lb lean ground beef, 30 oz of tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup cheese instead and was tempted to eat the whole pan by myself!  This will make for great leftovers tomorrow.

changed the pasta to ziti, that is what I had in the pantry.  One advantage, the sauce filled up the ziti.

I would make it again, my Dad loved it.

My family loved it and killed every single bit of it!! I made some alterations though. Instead of using fusilli I used rotini. Also instead of pepperoni I used Italian sweet sausage. I added a jalapeño for spice also shallots as well. Was to lazy to take a picture. Also I baked it. Cooked the pasta halfway piled all the ingredients and mixed it together and let the oven finish baking the pasta on top.

This recipe is delicious! I love it...I just omitted the cheese cause I am not a cheese fan and plus it's less calories. I added spices to the beef.

We used ground chicken instead of ground beef and used two cans Italian style chopped tomatoes along with 1 can tomato sauce.  I also added 1 small can sliced black olives to give it a little more flavor.  Since there are only two of us we had enough left overs for my lunch the next day and to share with an elderly relative that needs some variety in her food.  The peperoni and cheese on top are a real treat!  Will definitely make this again!

My family enjoyed this and was an easy meal to prepare ahead of time and then slip into the oven when ready.  I put in less tomato sauce - 28 oz - and browned Italian sweet sausage along with the ground beef instead of using pepperoni.

Awesome base recipe! As other reviewers have stated... used whole wheat pasta, added Italian seasoning, turkey + turkey sausage for the meat, chopped turkey pepperoni, a bell pepper, onions (cooked), spinach, and fire roasted tomatoes for a spicier flavor. Topped with some parmesan as we dished it out. we all loved it and it felt very healthy.

I wasn’t sure everything was going to fit in one casserole dish. I used hot deer sausage/hamburger some gave us. I added garlic and Italian seasoning. It turned out great.

Wonderful!  I made this a vegetarian dish by just taking away the meat and adding a soy crumble product. My meat-eating friends and family loved it. They just added a chicken parmesan to theirs.

I added black olives, and turkey sausage and several other spices I like to mines. Recipe is what you make it and leaves room to explore, and it turned out awesome!

This recipe is very bland. It has no taste. I had to add salt, pepper, garlic and Italian seasonings etc...etc. I did use ground turkey instead. I think if I ever make this again I would use pasta sauce and not plain tomato sauce.

I opted to use mild Italian sausage (2 lb. - could only find 1 or 2 lbs.) rather than the beef. I sautéed minced garlic, onion and one diced green pepper  (2 would have been way too much) then cooked the sausage with it. Once the sausage was done, I added 2 24 oz. jars of tomato basil sauce, some Italian seasoning and garlic salt to balance out the sweetness. I mixed the sauce/meat mixture with the pasta in the baking dish and topped with the cheese. It was nearly overflowing, more than likely due to the extra meat, so I set it atop a cookie sheet and threw it in the oven. It turned out great! I was super happy I used the sausage as it gave it more flavor. I made this to have lunch leftovers all week and it made tons!

Love this recipe! I substituted gluten free pasta and sautéed the onion, as another reviewer suggested. Definitely a good idea. This is an easy dish, good for kids and adults alike!

This came out FABULOUS!!! I omitted the pepperoni but added hot Italian Sausage with the casings removed and crumbled the sausage with the ground beef meat, I added fresh minced garlic and mushrooms, and seasoned the sauce with Italian Seasonings, onion powder, granulated red pepper instead of the pepper flakes, a can of tomato paste with two cans of stewed tomatoes cut in chunks.  I marinated the sauce for two hours and it was thick and VERY flavorful and well seasoned.  I made meatballs to go along with it, baked in the oven then marinated in the marinara sauce I made for the pasta.  When I pulled that baked cheesy goodness out of the oven and removed the foil right away, I KNEW it was gonna be a HIT!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH for a terrific meal idea!
