I WAS GOING TO SUBMIT THIS RECIPE IF NO ONE ELSE HAD!  THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC - LIKE THE ONE SERVED AT THE OLIVE GARDEN.  I ADD APPROXIMATELY 3-4 TBS OF SUGAR BECAUSE I DID FIND IT TO BE TOO TART.  AND BEST OF ALL, IT'S RELATIVELY LOW FAT.

This is excellent and really does have the same appeal as the Italian restaurants. Simple, tasty and quick.I also added 2 TBS. sugar. I did find by refrigerating it overnight it thickens up and the flavors really blend together. Yummy! Thanks for ending my search.

My husband took one bite and spent it back out. I didn't realize how strong this dressing is. I don't think any amount of added sugar could of helped this. I can't imagine any restaurant serving such a bad tasting dressing.

Wonderful!  My husband gave it 5 stars (and he's kind of picky about salad dressings)!  Before adding sugar as other reviewers suggested, I tasted it, and it was perfect just as written; for us, the corn syrup was just enough sweetener.  Definately will go into my permanant files!

Everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I did different was I didn't have white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar, I used garlic powder instead of actual garlic, I added 1 tsp of sugar, and I whisked it instead of using a blender. Great taste!

I really enjoyed this dressing. I served it in a tossed salad when company came over, and everyone raved about it. My grandfather even asked me for the recipe. I think that it would also be great on a pasta salad. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe, not too tart at all as is.  I used mayo with olive oil (by kraft), some white balsamic vinegar, and canola oil in place of veg. oil.  It turned out super.  Thanks a bunch

I held back a star just because without a little sugar, this is really tart.  After adding about 2 Tbsp., though, it was perfect.  My family loved it.

This was pretty....not good as written. I ended up adding 1/2 cup of sour cream to cut down on the tartness and make it something we would eat. This is not one I will be making again.

I didn't have all herbs on hand so used what I did have...added some dried Italian herb spice mixture....halved the salt as per other suggestions.  This is an excellent base for Italian dressing.  Delicious.  This makes the BEST Italian dressing I've ever tasted.  Thx for the recipe......so easy, very tasty.  I will never have to buy packaged mix again.  Totally loved it.  Was so happy to find it here.  A rare find.

It okay. My husband really liked it. For me, I had to add a few things to make it not so sour and tart. I will make it again for him but Ill probably just use my Kraft Catalina for me.

While I didn't find this dressing to be the same as the Italian restsurant version, it was delicious none the less! Made it just as written and felt no changes were necessary. It was a little tart, but we enjoyed that. I also thought it was a little on the thin side, but it ended up coating the salad beautifully. I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was wonderful - exactly what we were looking for.  Tossed it over my salad and shared it at a pot luck.  It was the only salad that was eaten entirely...  Did have a few ingredients so I substituted: honey for corn syrup, oregano for Italian spices and lime for lemon.  but kept everything else the same.

I followed the recipe exactly but used homemade mayo and organic corn syrup and olive oil, so it would be GMO free and healthier.  I didn't think the dressing tasted anything like Olive Garden's, but it was very tasty in its own right.  I did not find that it needed extra sugar.

Very good. Used fresh parsley in place of dried and didn't add sugar. I prefer the Creamy Italian Dressing I from this site, though and will probably make that next time.

I forgot to review this, and made it like last year for the first time!  I loved it...and make it often since!  It's sooo good that we eat it with raw veggies!  Found my daughter licking it.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This was pretty good. I used a simple syrup (1/2 sugar and 1/2 water boiled) instead of the corn syrup, and used red balsamic vinegar. Also, I didn't have any Romano cheese, so I used all Parmesan. The red vinegar gave it an unusual color, but it tasted very good.

Very, Very, good! I did change the white wine vinegar to white balsalmic vinegar, and I used 1 Tablespoon Simple Sugar Syrup instead of the corn syrup.  I didn't have any Romano cheese, so I just added a little extra Parmesan. For the seasoning, I used garlic powder, garlic salt, basil, oregano, and rosemary.  Turned out exactly how I wanted!

Tangy!  Added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut the sharpness but still....  Didn't remind me of Olive Garden at all but still pretty good.  I don't like to use bottled dressings so I will likely do this one again.

This was good. I did add a teaspoon of sugar, about 1 tsp of salt, and maybe 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I would like it a bit thicker, might add dry pectin next time.  Thanks for a great post!

Since I used Miracle Whip and blush balsamic vinegar, I didn't need to add any sugar.  The corn syrup gave the dressing a nice smooth, glossy appearance.  Don't know that this made me think of an Italian Restaurant, but it was yummy on a salad of mixed greens, tomato, salad peppers, and black olives.

This was good - not restaurant like but good just the same. I added some crushed red pepper to one version and I made a second batch and added some Franks Hot Sauce and served over a grilled chicken salad.

Basically good.  My adjustments were 1/2 basalmic vinegar 1/2 white wine vinegar, honey instead of corn syrup otherwise I followed the recipe.  Just the right amount of italian seasoning.

This recipe turned out great.  I didn't have any Romano cheese, but had all of the other ingredients on hand and it was still good.  This goes well on a salad with lentil soup and french bread

This dressing is okay.  I cant say that I find any similarity to any italian restaurant that I have ever been to.

We added 3 T of sugar after reading the reviews.  This was a little too much sugar for us.  It was a good dressing, but I wouldn't compare it to Olive Garden ... too much mayo.
