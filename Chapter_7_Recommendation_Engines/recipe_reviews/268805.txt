I made it with snow crabs. I followed the recipe but added a generous sprinkling of Old Bay seasoning. They were wonderful!
It should be noted that this recipe is probably for a 6 qt Instant Pot. I used 2 cups of water with my 8 qt Instant Pot

Excellent recipe - simple to follow.  I used frozen snow crab legs and cooked at high pressure for 5 minutes with quick release in a 6 quart pot and they were perfect. The weight of the crab legs I used was 1.6 pounds (not 2 pounds as the recipe recommends)...and that didnâ€™t make any difference.

King Crab is extremely expensive here so I went with Russian Red, 7 ounces = $10.00, King Crab is four times the price. Normally I wouldn't use a recipe with only one review for something so expensive but I trust this submitter's recipes and I wasn't disappointed! Other than using less crab I followed the recipe to the T.  Honestly, this tasted like it just came off of the boat! I'm so happy that I found this recipe and it will be my go to going forward. I served this with a simple Caesar salad and Spaetzle. I forgot to mention that I used a cleaver to cut these  into pieces that would fit into my 6 quart Instant Pot, start to finish, 14 minutes. Thanks Nicole, I throughly enjoyed this!

First time making crab legs in the Instapot. Took the 1-1/2 cups of water and added broth cubes. Salted and added garlic powder. Layed 4 portions in the pot, sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning. Sealed and set to PC for 5 min. Quick released and removed. Super delicious! We wanted more!
