I'm giving this five stars because I used real crabmeat; I live in Maryland and it's relatively reasonable.  Even if you're land-locked, you can buy canned crabmeat in the tuna aisle.  Friends don't let friends (or relatives) eat the fake stuff!!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! My mom has been the "quiche queen" in the family - until now! I may be able to give her a run for her money with this one! I made a few adjustments...We hate imitation crab, so I used canned. I only had half-n-half so I used that with 1 t. cornstarch added to it in place of the heavy cream. I also added garlic powder, a little Old Bay, and touch more hot sauce. Hubby had thirds and even picky 13-yr. old daughter left none on the plate. Served with a big salad. I will certainly make this again soon.

this is absolutely delicious the way it is, but I made changes another time to decrease the fat/calories and it was as good...used egg whites instead of eggs, thickened rice milk instead of heavy cream, and added 1 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning...

I'm not the hugest fan of imitation crab, however, living overseas it isn't always available so.... instead of substituting real crab which is expensive anyway - I made this quiche as written (not an everyday occurence I might add! HA!)  The only I did change which is standard for me is that I am unable to get a premade crust here and just can't seem to make a decent crust (I vow to learn someday) so.... I always just add 1/4 flour to any quiche recipe and *voila*...it makes a CRUSTLESS QUICHE!  Super simple and always fabulous! If I could have I would have substituted the crabmeat, but even without the real stuff my 5 year old son was requesting THIRDS! ***** I also sliced the imitation crab thinly so the whole texture of it didn't bother me as much***

Really loved this recipe [as did everyone else in my family]....I did modify it a bit though, I made my own pie crust [dont really understand why most people opt for store-bought, ready-made items over home-made it came out amazing] and I took the "to taste" with the hot sauce to heart and used more then three drops of a great habanero hot sause I have...Would definitely make this again, thanks for posting it...

Fabulous dish. Didn't realize how filling it can be. I made it for a mother's day brunch with a few changes. I also tripled the tabasco sauce per another reviewer's recommendation. Even so I still think it could have used more. I used 3/4 cup of cream as I thought 1 cup was a little too much too. And I substituted real crabmeat as opposed to artificial. It was a HIT even with the kids! This recipe is definitely a keeper and next time I'll toss in some veggies to lessen my guilt about the cream. All in all a great recipe! The leftovers made a great dinner.

Wonderful and easy recipe. Made a few modifications which is why I gave four stars and not five: used half and half, real crab meat and added 1/4 cup Bisquick pancake mix (omitting the pie crust...creating a crustless quiche). Also added frozen spinach to the crab to make this a one-dish meal with veggies. Also baked it @ 325 for about 45 minutes. Delicious!

I really loved this quiche. So did my daughter. My husband even ate it and doesn't like much seafood. I followed the recipe exactly (maybe a little extra tabasco), but found the cook time wasn't enough. I turned the oven on again with the quiche still in, until it began to raise (about 20 min give or take). I took it out and let is settle a bit. Then we ate it. If I cook this again I will add about 10-15 min to the initial cook time, then let it sit with the oven off for the full 30. Your oven and altitude may differ so keep that in mind. Over all this was great! Thanks

I must say that this was by far a very easy and extremely delicious recipe for crab quiche. I followed the instructions to a tee, however I did throw a twist in it of my own by adding shrimp to it as well. I just took a little less than half a pound and cut them up into bite size pieces and added them in as the instructions suggested I do with the crab, etc. It came out wonderful!

WOW!  This was sooo good and SUPER fast...great for a quick dinner!  I did make a couple changes...no pie crust (low carbs here), used swiss cheese, and 5 eggs, not 4...using heavy cream was yummy but WAY rich, so I would suggest using half and half or vitamin D milk instead!  My one year old LOVED it, so it is definitely a keeper!!

I have made this 4 times - I LOVE it!  My little additions are baby shrimp, Old Bay spice, and dill.  I also add my crab & shrimp to the pie shell and then pour in the liquid ingredients.

Excellent recipe.  Followed other's advice to bake for 43 minutes, then turn oven off and leave in for 20 more.  I used colby & monterey jack for the cheese and used swiss in place of the parmesean.  The texture was perfect, this is a keeper!!!

The first few times I made this, I used real (canned) crab and it was delish. Then I used the fake crab as called for and it had much more flavor. With the canned crab, no one even know there was crab in it until I told them...it was delicate. Both good, but different, so give it a try both ways.

I really loved this recipe!  I read almost all the reviews... as I usually do... and I followed the recipe to the tee.  Cooked perfectly and with so much flavor with the simple seasonings!  I keep thinking of what I might add next time.... probably nothing... It was really a class act as written!

Mmmmmm... this stuff is really good.  I doubled the recipe, planning on making one with crust, and one without.  I also added between 1/2 to 3/4 pound of little shrimp, doubled the green onions, and put in a sprinkling of garlic powder.  I followed the baking directions for the crust and filled it up, and then added about 1/4 cup of flour for the crustless quiche and found that I had enough for 2 more!!!  Bonus!  I baked all three at the same time as indicated (30 minutes on, 30 minutes off), and found that the 2 crustless came out perfect and delicious!  The one in the crust, however, was still very runny.  This very well could have been from baking all 3 at the same time?  Anyways, I put in the crusted quiche (by itself of course) for another ~15 minutes with the oven on, and ~20 minutes with the oven off (while devouring half of one of the low-carb crustless quiches) and then the middle seemed to be a bit soft, but done.  If I had to do it again, I would have left it in 20/20 minutes the second time.  Still - and EXCELLENT QUICHE!  Thanks for posting it for us!

Made this last night for dinner and it was delicious!!! We too found it necessary to add 10-15 minutes to the cooking time and we substituted Old Bay Seasoning for the salt. We also lightly brushed the pie crust with egg white when we pre-baked it and the quiche came out golden brown and flaky....not soggy at all. Very good recipe overall and will definitely make again.

I've made this several times, most notably last night for my father and brother.  Some of the filling bubbled over and my father scraped it off the cookie sheet and said if the quiche was as good as the spillage he couldn't wait to eat it.  He loved it and complained that I hadn't made two!  I used two green onions and real canned crab.  It was a hit.

After viewing all the comments I made a very few adjustments. I used the 2 pkgs. of "Chicken of the Sea" crab. I haven't been pleased with our crab here--being so far inland. This is a great product and gives you the delicate crab flavor and no fishy taste. I also used 1 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning, 6 dashes of hot sauce and three chopped green onions. Now, the clincher. I went out on a BIG limb and decided to go for a cup of Fat Free Half N Half instead of the cream. It was nice and creamy and tasted wonderful! My big lesson was not to be afraid of using it. I was a little nervous about that step. On Christmas Eve I made three different quiches--a Lorraine, Crab and Broccoli. I put them all in the oven for 45 minutes and then let them sit inside until we got back from church. Wonderful with fruit salad. I was very happy with this recipe and the technique of cooking. Thanks!

I just made this last night and it was great!  I used pepper-jack cheese instead of monterey jack with only 1 shake of Tabasco and it was perfect - not very spicy.  I used a 6-oz container of real crabmeat (found at the grocers seafood counter), and used the cream.  I also sprinkled a light coating of fresh-grated parmesan over the top before baking.  I used the Pillsbury crust that you unroll into your pieplate, put into a 10-inch pie plate, pushing the crust up all the sides.  It worked fine - there was not too much filling.  I liked prebaking the crust, and liked the idea of cooking for 25-30 minutes followed by the additional oven time with the oven off - it gave a great texture.  Next time I'm going to try it with a can of evaporated milk instead of the cream - with all the flavor from the crab, onion and cheese, I doubt it will diminish the flavor at all.  I'm going to use your oven technique with other quiches as well - thanks!!!  Oh, by the way, a similar technique (bake then leave in oven with temp turned off) is recommended in the 'cheesecake extraordinaire' cookbook for one of their lemon cheesecakes - it makes the CREAMIEST lemon cheesecake!!!  Thanks!

I made this tonight for the first time, adding 1/4 cup flour to make it crustless as another reviewer suggested. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream. My husband, who doesn't generally care for shellfish - and especially imitation anything - admitted it was good. My 4 1/2 year-old son called it "delightful". :) Thanks for a great recipe!

My wife said it was the best quiche she has ever had. I am giving it 5 stars because it was a great way to do an easy and cheap meal that still tasted great. Of course, using fresh crab meat (although the imitation meat probably holds in chunks better) and adding garlic and a few herbs and spices would add extra flavour, but it is simple, inexpensive and quick to whip up. Thanks for a nice recipe, I will make it again.

I would give it a two, husband said four, so I averaged them. This was just too wierd for me, but I can see where it was a "good" recipe. It just was no my thing, and grossed me out a bit. You'll just have to try it for yourselves...

OMG!!! This was so good! I made 2 and they were both gone in minutes. I used real crab and extra green onion. It wasn't baking for me as instructed so I baked for about 45 min., until knife inserted in center came out clean, and then removed it from the oven. Edited to add, I made this a 2nd time with the imitation crab and was suprised at how good it was. And even more to my suprise this was better the next day.

Excellent!  I also didn't put in the Tabasco (didn't have any) but it didn't suffer for it.  Full of flavor, tender and delicious.  Make sure you use a deep dish pie crust though -- it makes a lot.

OH MY...was that good stuff. I will say my hubsand and I enjoyed it very much we ate half of it on our own(the kids of cousre would have nothing to do with it...so if fixing this for you family go ahead and fix the lil' ones something else). The only thing I did a little different was I added more chesse and about 3 times what was called for on hot sauce and I served with a side salad. Thanks for this great "egg pie" as my kids call them.

My husband and I loved this!!! The flavor was fantastic and it tastes even better the next day. My only problem was that the crab was too watery (I had taken it out of the freezer) so it took a lot longer to bake. I think it took about an hour. But I will definitely make this again.

she's right! Quick, easy, had the ingredients at home already. I added some red onion, kale and mushrooms and therefore a couple of extra eggs, substituted Swiss cheese because I had it on hand and ended up with two quiches!! Very, tasty stuff.

Great recipe!  Made 2 double recipes, filled 3 10" deep dish pies perfectly.  Changes: used cheddar vs jack cheese and real crabmeat.  Baking time about 40-45 minutes prior to turning off oven.  I used bigger shells, which explains the longer baking time.  YUM!

This was very tasty--kids loved it and hubby said "I usually don't like quiche but this is really good." I didn't give 5 stars because these cooking directions did not work for me at all.  After baking 30 mins and letting sit in oven for 30mins more, it was still uncooked and runny in the middle but the edges were done. I had to cook it another 30 minutes or so, and turn up temp to 375 to finally get the middle to cook. End result-- overcooked around the edges and just right in the middle. I used whole milk instead of cream...not sure if that would have affected cooking time.

Great recipe! Forgot to buy green onions (whoops) So I used bacon for extra flavor. Um...Awsome!!!For those of you who need more flavor, crumble up about a 1/4 lb of cooked bacon, mix in before baking and disregard the added fat content. I couldn't finish my first piece (too rich!) but my hubby ate half the pie in one sitting!!

Very good, but I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2, Cheddar instead of Monterey Jack, a few more shakes of Tabasco and REAL CRAB. Since I was making another (spinach) quiche to go with this that did not call for baking the crust for 10 minutes first, I didn't do that.  Both crusts were delicious and flaky. Another keeper!!!

These were quite tasty. I used frozen mini tart shells and put them in the oven for 8 minutes first before filling them with the mixture. I chopped the crab meat very finely to get a less chunky consistency. Also, I added a few drops of louisiana hot sauce, minced jalapenos and around 1/2tspn cumin to the mixture to give it a nice spicy kick. I found the quiche to be rather plain without the spicier ingredients.

I had to change this one a bit, for what I had on hand.. used REAL crab, an "italian blend" cheese, 2% milk (I'm sure cream would be an awesome touch), Cholula pepper sauce, and added some garlic seasoning.  Plus, I've made many quiches over the years, and ALWAYS put the chunky ingredients in the crust, then pour the egg mixture over, so I did it that way.  It was super simple, and it turned out really yummy!  Will make again!

Very good flavor. I used 1 can of crab meat and also chopped up 5 large pre-cooked shrimp. I used half of an orange pepper also and 2 T of chopped scallion in place of the green onion.

I am giving it 4 b/c of the alterations.  I used canned crab and added, 1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, old bay, and parsley.  I substituted fresh chives from my garden for the green onions. Will definatley make this again, maybe tweak it a little more. Thanks for a great base recipe!!!

This is very tasty. I used real crab as I had so much I didn't know what to do with it all! I used half double cream and half whole milk for the 1 cup of heavy cream as double cream is too thick I think. I added more crab (anything to get through it...lol) but otherwise followed the recipe. I used frozen puff pastry as a base and it was really good.

My 9 year old loves seafood but hates "egg pie" (quiche). My 6 year old loves quiche but hates seafood. And my dear husband dislikes both....UNTIL!! I made this recipe with only two changes. I used pepper jack cheese instead of monterey and I took out the tobasco sauce and added old bay. My family took care of the rest. I will definitely make this again!! Thanks!

Very easy and tasty quiche.  I agree with reviewers who increased hot sauce and substituted Old Bay for the salt.  I also used Jumbo Lump Blue Crab meat, Pricey but Soooo worth it.

This is a great recipe. I used real crab from snow crab legs. I bought about 1 1/2 lbs., of course, when picked it is only about 11 ounces, which was perfect. I also added sliced baby portabella mushrooms and sauteed them along with the onion in a little butter and added to the crab/cream mixture. It was out of this world!

Quick and easy to put together. It was tough to make  without eating it since it was smelling so good while cooking. I cooked it for about 30-35min and then let it sit in the turned off oven for another 25min. It was a very nice Mother's Day Breakfast in Bed meal. I made it 2 weeks ago for a family event, and now have been ordered to make it tomorrow and next week, too!!

This was SOOOOOOOO good! My boyfriend and I loved it, we were even kind enought to share with his roomate. Although I did use a deep dish crust, if anyone tries this approach, I would recommend keeping the oven 'ON' for at least an extra 5-10 minutes, that way it cooks all the way through. Also, I used seasoning salt, SENSATIONAL!!!

I was planning on making this quiche to serve to guests... I sure am glad I made it first as I will not be serving to guests.  I found the imitation crab to be a bit overwhelming.  First, I recommend dicing or cutting into very small pieces.  I flaked as the recipe indicated, and the crab chunks were all you tasted.  As other reviewers indicated, this is pretty bland and I recommend adding additional spices and more green onion.  This isn't a terrible recipe, but I most likley wouldn't bother making again.

Awesome recipe!  It will be in frequent circulation.  I didn't like the smell of my crabmeat once I opened the can so I made a veggie quiche from this same recipe and it was FAB!  Also, I didn't have enough of any one kind of cheese so I used mostly swiss (slices, too lazy to shred) and some leftover grated mozzarella.  I sprinkled some leftover grated cheddar (from tacos the previous nite) on top and it looked and tasted great.  VERY easy, especially with a ready-made crust . . . and a very good recipe to get rid of "leftovers" with!!

this is a good recipe but a little too bland for my family's taste. Will try again but will a little more salt and pepper,and onions plus sharp cheddar cheese instead.

This is the best crab quich, bar none, and I've had some of the best in the finer restaurants.  I used the 'fake' crab and only a connosseiur would know the difference, and, it won't last long enough to be decided anyway.  Excellent!

This quiche was superb! A great hit w/ my luncheon group & family. I reduced the heavy cream by a small amount, as it overflowed when I poured it into the deep dish pie shell. It was still as creamy & flavorful as ever. I will definitely will be making this one again!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I gave it five stars on taste but probably a 2 for healthy recipes. I didn't add the tabasco sauce but I chose this recipe because it uses ingredients I usually have. It was excellent with the change too!

This recipe is FABULOUS! I make this often, as it has become a family favorite. I "gourmeted it up" by using a home-made pie crust and fresh crab (and once I used fresh lobster -OMG crazy good), with Gruyere cheese instead of Jack, and chives instead of green onion. Thank you so much for this great recipe! :)

DELICIOUS! So delicate, creamy, and rich but not TOO rich. Definitely use good quality crab meat for this recipe- it's the star of the dish and it deserves to have some fresh, real crabmeat in it.

I loved this recipe and it was soooo good! I made this with some left over imitation crab from a seafood salad. I pretty much increased the quantity of all the seasonings including the hot sauce. I also added about 2 tbl of Old Bay Seasoning, 1/4th of a white onion, Garlic Powder, 1/2 pkg of thawed frozen spinach (chopped). I didn't use a deep dish frozen pie, I used regular refrigerated pie crust and this was enough to actually make 2 quiche. I will definitely make this again - great way to impress friends for brunch or small gathering!

Using canned crab rather than imitation as a few reviewers suggested turned out to be excellent advice. It really did pack more of a punch and had better texture. This is an otherwise excellent recipe.

This was amazing. I've never tried quiche before and neither has my husband , but I had a can of crab and wanted to make something special for father's day. Mmmmm. I doubled the filling (to make 2 pies) and made it as written and then added cooked spinach, fried onions and to my husbands pie mushrooms. I didn't have deep dish crusts so the filling make soo much we had it as a big batch of scrambled eggs the next morning. We both had our left over pies for lunch 2 days later and it is just as good cold.

This was awesome......but I am on the Atkins diet...and altered it to omit the pie shell....use slivered toasted almonds on the bottom.....and heavy cream.  Also, added a bit of sherry..... even nice for company! MARIE

Yummy.  My 2 and 4 yr old enjoyed and hubby went back for 2nds.  Swapped whole milk for the heavy cream as previous reviewer suggested.  Also eliminated green onions as I'm do not like them.  We will make again!

Totally delicious.  I went a little heavier with the spices including "onion powder" which is great in loads of food.  But your method of cooking the crust was ***** excellent!

Great tasting and easy! I added Old Bay Seasoning, used real lump crab and extra green onions. Personally, I found the crab just a little overwhelming and thought it needed more eggs but my husband (who's from Maryland) LOVED it! Excellent recipe for beginning quiche makers!

I liked it, but I love crab.  Soooo, if you're not a huge fan of crab, you might overdose on it:)  Oh plus, I used the fake crab (the stick looking kind) and I'm willing to bed the "meatier" version probably mixes a LOT better.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is delicious, and so easy to prepare, that it's almost sinful!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  It is one of our favorites!  I keep ingredients on hand so anytime I need an easy-to-prepare recipe, this is one I can always count on. The cooking time is fine, if you use a convection oven, but takes a little longer in a conventional oven.

This recipe was excellent. I used fresh crab instead of imitation and it was gone in no time.

Always go for the "Dungeness" crab, even out of a can it made your recipe sparkle!

I made this quiche tonight and loved it!  I used two Chicken Of the Sea packets of crab, rather than imitation crab. Fantastic crab flavor. I didn't have a green onion on hand, so I was pretty heavy handed with the Tabasco (we love hot and spicey) and sprinkled a little garlic powder. We live at 4500', and had to add some cooking time. I'll try 35 minutes at 350F, then let it stand 35 minutes next time. t was fantastic!! Looking forward to many more quiches based on this recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh crab and added a little bit of Old Bay. YUM!!! I also doubled the recipe, made two 9 inch quiches and baked them both for 45 minutes and left them in the oven for 25 minutes.

I use this recipe whenever I make any kind of quiche, just substitute meats. I used jumbo lump crabmeat and Old Bay when I made this the first time and it was delicious. That is a great tip about leaving it in the oven while the oven is off.

Good recipe, but the cooking time was way off. I cooked at 350 for 40 minutes, let it sit for 20 minutes and then realized I would still have to put it in the oven for another 15 minutes.

I have used this recipe so many times for so many different occassions and I am thrilled at the outcome every time. Every one loves this dish - I have even made it for my children that attend my child care and they love it also. It is a nice enough dish to serve for special occassions and also for weekly family use.

I made this recipe for a family function and it was wonderful. I used canned lump crab and followed the suggestion to bake for 45 minutes and it turned out just great. I'll definitely make this one again.

This is quite good.  The cook time was off a bit.  Needs about another 15 to 20 minutes to get it right.  Some recipes you just have to try.  This is better than I thought it would be.

Doubled the recipe since I had a one pound can of lump crabmeat from Costco.  (Popped one in the freezer for another night's dinner!)  As other reviewers' have stated, you need to greatly increase the cooking time on this quiche or else you will have a soupy mess.  I baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, and let sit for 5 minutes.  It was perfect.    My husband loved it just as it was - - I splashed some Tabasco for added zing.  Serve this with a fresh salad for a quick 'company worthy' meal.

I used a pet ritz pie shell and pre-baked it.  Using another users suggestion I shredded a third of a block of sharp cheddar and shredded a block of Helluva Good Monterey Jack cheese.  I used a can of lump crabmeat and a can of premium red crabmeat and 7 drops of Franks Hot Sauce. I forgot to add the parmesan cheese but it didn't need it. I baked it for 45 minutes then left it in the turned off oven 30 more minutes.  It came out perfect and tasted delicious.
I gave half of the pie to a friend and he was going to just taste it and ate the whole half a pie in one sitting, it was that good.

Very good. I needed to bake it a little longer than stated in the recipe as I like my quiche "well done" and not runny. The taste was delicious. My husband does not usually like quiche but he loved this one.

absolutely delicious! I only used 1/2 cup cream, and also added cheddar cheese in addition to the monterrey jack. I reccomend the longer cook time (45 min @ 350, then 30 min w/ oven off) and add ALOT of hot sauce to give it more of a kick. but it was extremely easy and tasty!

This is one of the best quiches I've ever had. I made one substitution and used real crab meat for the imitation meat. It was FANTASTIC!!! I'm making is again tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!

I had my doubts (I'm not a 'crab' person), but my entire family loved this!  That includes my 10, 14 and 16 year old boys!  I didn't change much of anything...I just used real crab instead of imitation.  I can't count how many times my husband said how good it was!  Thanks for a change of pace!

I didn't care for this dish at all. I gave it 2 stars because the first few bites weren't too bad, but by the time you finished your slice, it was getting sickening. The combination of crab & eggs didn't go good together.

My mother and i loved this!  The only changes I made were to use 1 whole egg and the rest just whites for health reasons, and I added a little sherry to give it a "Newburgh" taste.  Delicious!!!

Jim, you are one LUCKY guy!! This is THE BEST quiche I've ever eaten.  I did add more Tabasco as suggested and cut back on the cream by just a little. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. OH MY Goodness! My wife ate 1/4 of the pie... I ate the rest.  I can understand why NOTHING is left.  THANK YOU JIMZGRL

Wonderful base recipe for quiche. I make my own pie crusts, so I didn't buy one from the store. And I don't like fake crab so I used real. Other than these minor changes, I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I like the instruction about cooking it and then turning off and letting it set up in the warm oven. I do this with cheesecakes and it works out great. My son who likes fish and salmon loaf/croquettes tried the quich but didn't like it, but my husband and I loved it. Thanks!

Made this for my little sister's baby shower and it was delicious! Since I was making 5 quiches, I realized that I needed to leave the weights in the pie shell for the entire 12 minutes of blind baking - otherwise, part of the side started to shrink down and the bottom began to puff up.  As others mentioned, I used canned crab - not a fan of the imitation.  I put 1/2 of crab/onion/cheese mixture in the baked shell, ladled in 1/2 of the eggs/milk and repeated.  Chef John talks about this in his video for Chef John's Quiche Lorraine and it makes a BIG difference.  If you just pour the egg/milk mixture over the filling (or with the filling), it will all sink to the bottom of the quiche  Ladling the eggs/milk ensures that you have filling in each bite.  Delicious!

An easy and delicious meal.  I did make a couple go changes.  Added 2 large mushrooms, chopped, and spinach (approx. 1/4 to 1/2 cup) .  I did cook it for 40 minutes before I tuned off the oven as my wife likes her quiche firm.  It was still creamy in texture and had great flavor.

Great recipe thanks for sharing!  I used back fin crab meat, because I don't care for imitation.  I also omitted the hot sauce and used Old Bay Seasoning to taste & sprinkled on top of the quiche before baking.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of diced mixed peppers (green, red, yellow & orange). And I made the pie crust from scratch. (this is because I showed my Hubby I could make one from scratch & now he only wants homemade :D)

Made this for my wife and I tonight and let's just say if we weren't trying to watch her sodium intake, there would not be any left! This was delicious. I used butter and milk in place of the heavy cream since we didn't have any. I also added a little Old Bay since I'm a Virginia boy and we love that. We can't wait to eat the rest!

I was excited when I realized I had all the ingredients to make this quiche.  Imagine my disappointment when I went to the cupboard to discover my teenage daughter had eaten my can of crab!!!  No worries, I made this quiche by the recipe, but added a bunch of chopped mushrooms intead of crab.  Mushroom and cheese quiche, wonderful!  This is such a light fluffy and tasty quiche, and the first I've ever made! Thank you!

I didn't have any hot sauce and it was still delicious!  While I followed the cooking time, it wasn't done at the end of the time that it sat in the cooling oven, so I turned the oven back on and cooked it for about 10 minutes and it came out perfectly!

I was going to make this for Mother's Day Brunch on Sunday but things didn't go as planned. Instead I made it for dinner last night and it was a hit with my Mom, stepdad and myself. We loved it. I did let it cook longer than the 30 minutes. I also added tomatoes and a bit more tobassco sauce. I probably could've added more. I was able to get 2 quiche's out of my mix. So we had left over's for breakfast this morning.

Very rich and tasty.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that the flavor of the crab didn't come through as stongly as I had anticipated.  Still, I'll make it again.

Fantastic recipe!! This is the best quiche recipe I have found in terms of consistency. I used 3 frozen Dungeness crabs. I added 1 t. of Old Bay.  I only had 3/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, so I also added 1/4 cup Gruyere cheese. I made the crust using bulk crust mix from Winco (hands down the best crust I have found or made). My picky 3 year old and my 14 month old both happily ate it. My hubby and I loved it, too.

I used real (albeit canned) crab, and half and half instead of cream. It was great! I doubled the recipe and made 2 quiches. Served for Easter brunch and they were a hit.

Simple recipe, easy to make, and my husband and 2-year-old LOVED it! I used swiss instead of Monterrey Jack, which gave it even better flavor! I also added chopped yellow bell peppers. Awesome!

This was a great recipe. I made it for an Easter brunch. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception, I used real crab meat. Everyone LOVED it. I had a bit of trouble with the quiche filling being too much for the depth of my pie crust. I even used a deep dish pie crust from the store. I would suggest placing the crust in a deep pie dish to avoid run over and then placing the quiche on a cookie sheet to prevent a messy oven. Otherwise, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I did tweak it some. I used 3 green onions, 8 dashes of Tabasco, 1/2 cup each of swiss, sharp cheddar and monteray jack cheeses, as well as the 1/4 cup parmesan (used the good kind you grate yourself). Also added one more egg and a touch of nutmeg and thyme. Also took others advise and cooked it longer, maybe another 15 minutes. It was a huge hit at a brunch I attended and was devoured in no time. Thanks for putting it out there.

This is a great side dish or buffet entree.  I added 1 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning, cut back on the salt and pepper, added chopped red onion and green chiles.  Really good!

This was really good. It seemed like too much milk, and I had to cook it for about 45 min until it wasn't runny. But the flavor was delidious.

I had never made a quiche before until I tried this one.  Super easy recipe and absolutely delicious!  The consistency was perfect, the imitation crabmeat worked fine in this dish, and the preparation was simple.  This one will definitely work into my standard dish rotation.

Great tasting, and VERY simple and fast to make when you use a frozen pie crust. I also went to town with the hot sauce, and substituted cajun seasoning for the salt. I used real canned crab. The texture was great, very light and fluffy but with good flavor.

This recipe turned out okay. I actually thought it was a bit bland (but definitely edible).  I even quadrupled the hot sauce amount and I still felt that way.  My husband said he liked it, but I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed after all the rave reviews. I served it for dinner and think it might be better as a breakfast/brunch dish instead.  I did use real crab meat in the can (Chicken of the Sea brand) instead of the imitation crab meat.  I didn't care for the texture of the crab.  It was practically pulverized.  I'm thinking next time I'll try the imitation crab flakes like the recipe calls for.  I'll give it one more try!

My first quiche ever and I used this reciped for Easter breakfast with all the family.  I used salad shrimp instead of crab and didn't have any heavy cream so sub'd milk and butter (common subsitution area). I cooked it FOREVER and it still came out a little wet but its probably my fault and not the recipe's.  Everyone still raved about it!!

It was great! The only difference is that I used mini muffin pan instead of one big one and didn’t add as much of heavy cream. For the dough part I bought Pillsbury biscuits and cut them up (1 can for 24 mini cup cakes). Great for any party!

Dish was runny, maybe bc I ran out of patience in letting it sit for that extra 20 minutes.  I may try it again with just milk to lower the fat content.

I thought this was pretty good.  I may substitute cheddar Cheese for the Monterey and add more green onions for more punch next time.  I loved the creamy texture and will definitely make this again.

I must admit this was the best quiche I have ever had the pleasure to make. I have made it three times without a change in the recipe and everyone loved it every time. I used imitation crab because of the expense. A real keeper! Thanx jimzgirl.

Really liked this one. I used low fat evaporated milk and low fat cheese and it still tasted great. My husband really liked it too. Will try it with real crab one of these days,I bet it is even better.

This was so good and so easy, I can't wait to make it again!  I used real crab (packaged... chicken of the sea).  Also, I couldn't find a deep dish pie crust.  It filled two regular shallow pie crusts nicely.

I got this recipe the first day that I started the daily recipe. It was a good time as I had some crabs left over from a seafood feast. Even my 11 year old who can be a fussy eater if I let him loved it. He even wanted it the next day. Thanks

This recipe is definitely worth the indulgence of heavy cream.  My quiche needed more cooking time than this recipe said. Delicious and simple!

I've had two cans of crabmeat in my pantry for at least two years, so when I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a try.  Figured my husband, who has never even had quiche, didn't like it, I could always say, I was just trying to save money.  My husband loved it and made me promise not to lose this one.  Thanks Terry

This was the first quiche I’ve ever made, and it was excellent!  A not of caution:  this recipe as written will fill TWO 9” pie shells, but it doesn’t tell you that.

I used canned lump crab meat and shredded it well.  I (and my Hubby) can say this was very tasty.  I had about a 1/4 cup of frozen chopped spinach left in my freezer, so I threw that in  for a little color.  Next time I'll put spinach and possibly some red chopped sweet peppers in for added color.  I made the recipe as stated, and it came out perfect!  I will make this again.

Very delicious, will definitely make again! I didn't have cream on hand so I used evaporated milk, and cheddar cheese. I also baked it 15 minutes longer since I had doubled the recipe and made 2. They came out great and my family loved it...the first one is gone and the second probably won't make it to morning. Thanks for a great recipe!

Used 5 eggs, 1/2 and1/2, 3 green onions, 2 6oz cans of crab, 1/2 c Monterey Jack cheese. This was too much for a small 9" crust so baked the rest in a casserole.  Was good!

Made this with half and half. Doubled the recipe and used lobster as well. Wow! The taste of it was outstanding! My husband loved it and my 8 year old surprised me by eating a whole piece as well. Hubby told me to never lose this recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I used Fontina cheese instead of Jack and I used a creole Hot Sauce I got in St Marteen.  My wife raved about how good it was.  Oh and I used cooked fresh Dungeness Crab from the local waters.

This recipe really isn't bad. I recommend adding 2 more green onions and about half a cup of chopped celery and I'm gonna try some jalapenos, as well. Otherwise, cook it until it looks done. The quiche in the photo is burnt. Don't let it get beyond a yellow-gold color. Remember, it's basically a big omelet in a pie shell.

Tried this for lunch today with the following modifications (sorry, but I wasn't going out to the grocery!):  I made my own crust (just easy to do), used evaporated milk instead of cream (a common substitution in my kitchen), and used shrimp (no crab).  But the combination of things worked very well.  Enjoyed by all.  Probably the only complaint was there wasn't enough (guess I should have made two).

This was wonderful. A few changes only. I added a lot more tabasco. Maybe about 10-12 shakes. Also added way more green onion. It also took a lot longer to bake. I did the max times as the recipe suggested but it was still soupy. I put it back in at 375 for another 15-20 minutes until it. Got brown. Great flavor. So easy.

I was looking for crab recipes (I was tired of making crab cakes) and decided to try this one. Well, my hubby and I go crabbing together so I had fresh crab to use and ours is frozen into 2 cup servings. I figured "what the heck, more crab = better quiche." It was DELICIOUS! I ended up calling it (jokingly) crab pie since the amount of crab in it overtook the whole thing. I am DEFINITELY making this again. Next time I'm going to add onions, mushrooms and asparagus and use both pie crusts.

Just made this quiche and it is wonderful!  I added Old Bay just cuz I add Old Bay to anything with seafood.  I can't believe how easy it was to make.  I used a package of shredded imitation crabmeat.  This is a keeper!

Modified as follows:  Homemade crust, real lump crab meat, light cream, mozzarella instead of montery jack, good gruyere instead of parmesan, and omitted green onion.  Was delicious.  Really delicious.

I have made this quiche several times. My family loves it! I was surprised because as a Maryland girl, eating fake crab is taboo. Why eat fake when you can get the real deal? Oddly enough, the fake crab is what the kids enjoyed. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I paid $15 for fresh crab at Central Market, put it into this quiche, and took it to a party.  It tasted very fishy, no one liked it.   Maybe if I had done something to the crab - I don't know.

I made this for my boyfriend last night. Followed all the instructions except added a bit more tabasco sauce. He loved it so much that I'm making it again tonight! Homemade hashbrowns are a great side for this!

I made this about two weeks ago, and I thought it was ok, but not fantastic.  The only change I made was I used imitation crab like it called for, but also added canned crab as well.  I didnt think it had much flavor, and was too egg-y.  Will not make again.

i can't eat the artificial crab meat since i saw how they made it, so i used 2 cans of real crab meat.  after reading the other reviews, i also added a little more tobasco sauce and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  it turned out really well, and i think next time i might try 1 can of crab and 1 can of salad shrimp.

Hmmm...I'm almost wondering if I did something wrong, because despite the great reviews this just wasn't that good to me or my family.  But I know I followed the recipe exactly.  Won't be trying this one again...not very flavorful at all.

This quiche is wonderful. Didn't have parmesan cheese so I used Pecorino Romano and needed to bake 45 min and not 30 min as the recipe calls for.  Will make it again and again.

My mom has been making this for years and I have always loved it. But one night I couldn’t get her on the phone or find my recipe, so I followed this one. And it is wonderful! I omitted the onion, just personal preference. I also added baby shrimp, and broccoli! Imitation crab gives it a subtle sweetness that canned crab doesn’t, so if you’ve never tried it with the imitation crab I highly recommend it! Defiantly a keeper and defiantly worth a try for everyone. My non seafood loving kids even like this! So win win.

For lower calories, I skipped the pie part and baked them in cup cake pans. Also added two more eggs and replaced the cream with whole milk. Also added in sauted squash. Only used parmesan cheese on top. Very delicious and I will make it again!

It was quick and easy and really good.  My only issue was I needed to cook a little longer than the recipe called for, but it turned out great and I'll be sure to make it again.  I did use real crab claw meat, which wasn't too expensive.

We really liked this! The only thing I would note is  that the canned white crab meat didn’t have enough flavor, so I would select a different crab product for this recipe.

This was truly a wonderful crab quiche recipe. I agree that the fresher the crab meat the better. I added three drops of hot sauce and could have added a touch more.

added dry mustard 1t
Takes longer to bake- 45+ min
Didn't have heavy cream, so I used Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2 and a quarter cup of sour cream. 
Creamy and delicious!

This is delicious.  I used fresh crab and shrimp and added red peppers and Old Bay seasoning.  It was a big hit and I'll be making it again.

LOVED this!! I used homemade oil pastry crust but other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was heavenly good. I’m definitely adding this to my repertoire of things I’ll make again!

A tasty dish. 
Wild caught crab (instead of imitation crab) and Swiss cheese (instead of Monterey Jack) on hand. 
Thanks for posting this recipe. Will definitely try again.

This turned out perfect.  I made a different one last year that has flour in it, and I didn't like the texture.  This recipe was a huge hit at Christmas brunch and a must do for next year

I followed the recipe and made no changes.  I extended the cooking time by another 20 minutes.  I used a deep dish pie plate.  My husband really liked it with additional hot sauce.  I thought it was tasteless.  With all of the different ingredients I expected some taste.  Mine was very bland.  It may be the Monterrey Jack cheese.  It was bland.  I may use Velveeta ,Swiss or cheddar the next time.

This was crazy easy & delish! The only thing I did different was used about 1/4 cup of yellow onion as I didn't have any green onions, & a couple extra splashes of hot sauce. As for cook time, the recommended time was perfect. I can only imagine that maybe not fully preheating or high altitude could affect the time. Will definitely make again!

I made this for my Mother's Day Tea....  Brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I did edit the recipe because I forgot to buy the Monterey Jack Cheese.  I had a round of Smoked Gouda that I had bought for another recipe.  As for the imitation crab..  it was delicious.  ... I definitely will make this again.... and I will remember to buy the right cheese.  Thanks

This is a fabulous recipe! I found it maybe three or so years ago, and have made it three times. Despite living in MD, I rarely buy crabmeat (usually go for the whole crab), so I don't get to make it that often.  I've made it twice for family brunch and I think once for Christmas. I'm actually making it again today (5/14/17) bc someone gave me 16oz of crabmeat from the market. I typically go w/the recipe as written (although I never use imitation crab), but this time I went with what I had on hand. I used cheddar cheese and added some bagged spinach I didn't want to go bad. I wanted to add dried red and green peppers, but couldn't find them.  I was generous with Old Bay.  I usually make it with the crust, but I'm eating keto/lowcarbhighfat, so I did w/o the crust. I did use 1/4 of pancake mix (as a review suggested) bc I'd never made it w/o the crust previously. I am baking it for 40 min and I will let it sit for another 15 or so.   it's in the oven now. Can't wait! Going to pair it with some broccoli tonight for a nice somewhat light Sunday dinner.  Edit:Wanted to add that this is definitely a recipe that can be appreciated as is, however, I do think you'll notice the difference btwn imitation crab and canned so spring for it.  I know people always comment on changes to recipes, but use what you have on hand. Use up your veggies,eggs,milk, whatever cheeses, and spice it to your/your family's tastes. which is what I'll be doing when I make it again this weekend (2019). The in

My husband just had colon surgery and needs to be on a low fiber diet. I made this quiche for him since it had everything in it that he could eat. We were both skeptical about the imitation crabmeat but it definitely worked. The crabmeat gave the quiche a somewhat sweet flavor. Definitely making again.

I was craving quiche for dinner and found this recipe. I've never made a quiche with crabmeat before but it sounded delicious. I ended up doubling the recipe to make 2 of them to feed my super hungry household and added spinach and an extra egg to each one. Unfortunately I was so preoccupied by my 7 month old daughter I forgot the heavy cream, but they still turned out great and both quiches were gone shortly after they came out of the oven. I would definitely make this again!

I was a little skeptical at first, so I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. It was phenomenal! I probably didn't need those extra seasonings, but it was great. It was a little runny at first, but I put it back in the oven for 15 minutes and turned off the oven and left it in for another 15 minutes. The next time I make it I'll do what another reviewer suggested and bake it for 45 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 20 minutes. Great recipe.

This was a super easy recipe and it was delicious!  I used fresh picked crab.  I only used one drop of tobacco because I can't handle super spicy food.  The quiche turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this dish for the first time on Christmas Eve. Turned out to be a great hit. I didn't change anything, stuck with the exact recipe but I did leave it in the oven about 10 mins longer. The top came out with a more brownish look. Easy to make. Taste great..

This was so good and so simple. I omitted the crust and added 1/4 C of flour to the egg mixture, as many other reviewers suggested. I also used real canned crab (2 cans) and added slightly sauteed spinach. I used my favorite real goat milk feta, that I broke into large chunks myself. I put the Montery Jack cheese over it, which added a nice brown crust on the top. I used one tsp of Old Bay seasoning and omitted the hot sauce, which was just the right spiciness for our family. 

Rave reviews. Will be making this again soon and often!

Very easy to make and tasty.  I did use real crab meat and added spinach, otherwise followed the recipe.  It was very popular with everyone-that is no easy feat!  I think it would make a good meal no matter what time of day.

If it wasn't for the cooking time, I would have rated this five stars. I had to bake it longer than what the directions said. Otherwise, it is very good. I would definitely make this again and maybe add shrimp.

Flavorful but not overly rich.  Relatively quick to assemble if you have the pastry made in advance (or purchased).  I forgot to pre-cook the crust, which never works out too well anyway as it tends to slide down the side of the glass pie pan, but cooking at 350 for 25 min and then upping the temp to 400 for 15 more minutes did the trick perfectly.

We loved it. I did use my own pie crust, real crab, and as some suggested, a bit more hot sauce. I had to cook it 10 minutes longer than the instructions say and then I left it in the oven 20 minutes with the oven off. Turned out great.

Made as written but used real crab.  For the crust - as another reviewer suggested I added 1/4 c of flour for a "crustless" quiche.   The quiche seemed a little salty to me, probably due to all the cheese?  Next time will reduce the salt to 1/4 t.

This was SO easy and tasty. I listened to some other reviews and doubled up on the hot sauce while adding some Old Bay. I also used fresh crab. PERFECT. I will definitely be making this again!

this is wonderful.  Very light.  I made it with real crab and used a gluten free pie crust.  I could not eat the crust.  But the quiche was great.

I made this with freshly caught stone crab meat. I followed the recipe exactly using organic ingredients.  It was a home run! Everyone loved it. I am making another right away.

I made the "Easy to Remember Pie Crust" it was delicious and my first ever not bought crust.  I used 2 Chicken by the Sea cans of crab meat, followed quiche directions exactly as written and everyone loved it.  This will be made again for sure.

I made this for brunch with my girlfriends, using the suggestion of a previous commenter to substitute egg whites (I used Egg Beaters) and thickened rice milk (I used Rice Dream brought to a slow boil with 1 tbsp of corn starch to thicken while stirring, stopping upon boil) and it was fantastic. My girlfriends ate every bit of it. With the substitutions each piece is less than 300 calories but still delicious. I also used this exact recipe but switched out 3 cups of spinach for the crab for a second quiche and it was completely gone as well. I will definitely make this for myself and friends again. Yum!

Added one pound of fresh crab meat. Just took longer to bake. But absolutely wonderful.

This recipe cooked perfectly and looked beautiful.   For me it was too rich and a little bland.   Did not care for the texture of the imitation crab.

Wow!  My family raved about this quiche.  Flavors are perfectly balanced and filling was creamy and cooked to perfection. I'll be making this again.

Make sure you prick bottom of the pie crust before pre-baking so it doesn't bubble. Had to bake 45 minutes, turned off oven and left in another half hour and it was perfect. However, to me this just tasted like fake crab & eggs. Followed exact recipe except that I had to use half & half, which didn't seem to matter. If I make it again I will use lump crab and maybe diced shrimp and add old bay seasoning.

I made this recipe on a raw cold February day.  We were drooling by the time it came out of the oven.  Good comfort food!
