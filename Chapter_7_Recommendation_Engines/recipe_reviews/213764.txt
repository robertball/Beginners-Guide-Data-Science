Used most of ingerdients as listed, couldn't find O'brien potata mix, so diced a couple of medium red potatoes and added a 12 oz.bag of frozem italian vegetables and enjoyed every bit of it.

Didn't include cream of celery soup as the family doesn't like celery. Next time I'll leave out the green beans as well. I ended up picking them out. Will also double the cream of mushroom to make up for leaving out the other soup. Otherwise a great recipe that we're adding to our regular rotation.

My mom used to make this recipe for me as a child growing up and I loved it.. however there are a few minor tweaks from this recipe.  First off I season my chops with garlic onion powder s & p.  Instead of sage we used a few dashes of liquid smoke or Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, I use 2 cans cream mushroom  and the sour cream (no cream of celery) and I also add spices to the sauce same as the chops.  I make the gravy up in the same pan I just browned the pork chops in add potatos and French style green beans.  Then I put it in a small baking dish and place in the oven at 350 degrees until the pork chops are at 165 degrees and its Delish :)

Just ok, gravy too thick.  Most likely won't make this anymore.

Tried this tonight. It was very good. only thing i did different was putting it over a bed of long grain wild rice. I really like that rice so it was great for me. It would probably be good on another type of rice as well.

Cooked some bacon and then browned the chops in the bacon grease. 

Put in crock pot with cut up potatoes and soups on low for 4 hours, added
green beans and just 1/4 cup of sour cream for another 30 minutes. 
Served with rice and salad, yum.
