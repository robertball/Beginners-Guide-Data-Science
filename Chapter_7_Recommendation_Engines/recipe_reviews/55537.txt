I think I totally screwed this up.  This recipe needs to be rewritten to state that 1/2c of sweetened condensed milk is needed instead of a can.  Because I put in a can not realizing that it called for 5oz can instead of a 12oz can.  So now I basically have roater pan full of mess.  I am glad I made this early instead of planning on taking this over to a friends house on New Years Eve.

I made this tonight and really liked it. I've tried a few other recipes, but they all turned out crunchy, and I like my caramel corn soft and gooey. This did the trick! Sweet and buttery and sticky.  Thanks :)

This is a good recipe. I am one of those crazy people though that does not use a microwave anymore, so microwave popcorn was out. I popped my own.  When I finished mixing it all up it didn't taste quite right. I realized it was missing a salty flavor form the prebuterd and salted microwave popcorn.  Solution, salt your caramel corn after you mix it up. Go easy and salt to taste. Then it is great.  A little sweet and salty. Yum

When I cook I don't follow the ingredients exactly. In this recipe I cooked the popcorn on the stove, and more than the recipe called for, then salted it. I added the caramel to small amounts of the popcorn until it was as gooey as we like it. I do not have a candy thermometer, so I tested it by putting the caramel in cold water. Cooking it as long as it says was too long. It got hard too fast and that made it very chewy. The second time I cooked it til it made a very soft ball. This was much better. This does make a very large batch and is hard to eat the second day. Unless you are making this for a large crowd, half the recipe. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Yum!

I have tried all sorts of recipes for caramel corn lately.  My mom made soft caramel corn when I was younger, but it requires golden syrup I cannot buy around here.  I really do not like crunchy caramel corn.  It reminds me of the boxed stuff.  No thanks!  This recipe was super easy and I was 100% pleased with the result.  Better yet, I don't have to bake it!  I did add some peanuts, though.  When this caramel corn cooled down, I put it in small zipper bags and stuck them in the freezer.  I can grab one for a snack, but I usually share it with the entire family.  We all love it!!

Everybody loved this, however I only had to heat my caramel to 205 degrees, also I added vanilla extract after removing it from the heat.

I made this using only half the amount called for of the caramel ingredients, and added 2 tsp vanilla when I added the condensed milk.  It came out perfect!  If I had added as much caramel as the recipe calls for, it would have been way too much.

This caramel corn was awesome. It was the messiest gooeyist popcorn in I've ever had but well worth the mess! I added a little cinnamon to the caramel sauce to give it some spice.The only drawback is it makes ALOT and it doesn't taste very good the next day. You have to eat it all right away. Plus it is on the messy side, but it's the perfect messy, gooey snack for a movie night in. Yum!

This was really good! I am 9 months pregnant and had a craving and looked this up. However, it was super rich and I ended up eating only a little bit, rolling the rest into popcorn balls and sharing it with my lamaze class! I would make a little less of the caramel next time...was a little too much for me!

LOL I can't stop smiling and giggling. If you are almost 10 months pregnant like me or otherwise hormonal and in search of something sweet, gooey and downright sinful than this is for you! I did make some minor changes based on what other people said about the flavor and things I just always add to my carmel corn but this was really really good! I think there are just a few too many food snobs on here.  First I added half a teaspoon of salt and used salted butter. At the end I removed the carmel from heat and added some vanilla and a little baking soda (expands the volme for equal coverage and adds a lot of the salty flavor people said this recipe lacks) I will be making this again but because it makes so much I'll save it for the holidays or for when we have overnight guests. This will take a while to eat. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This is the caramel corn of my childhood... soft and gooey!  I used an air popper & loved the suggestion to lightly salt the pop corn, it adds a great sweet and salty combo.  I was out of corn syrup & have been trying to use Agave Syrup in place of my sweetners lately anyways, so I decided to give it a go and it came out perfectly without affecting the flavor or texture.  I have a carnival birthday party coming up so I made and wrapped up a few popcorn balls to see how long the freshness lasts so I can plan for my upcoming event... will post results in a few days.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet!  This is probably my favorite recipe- ever.  It is so easy and I would guess pretty hard to mess up.  I usually make it exactly as it is written, but have changed it up as well.  If I don't have microwave popcorn, I use air popped.  I just add 1/2 t of sea salt to the caramel.  I don't measure a specific amount of popcorn.  I make a huge bowl and then can use as much popcorn as I want (based on how caramel-y I would like the batch to be.)  I have also halfed the recipe.  Sometimes I add 1t vanilla after the caramel is cooked (before pouring onto the popcorn.)  This recipe is addicting and everyone who has ever tried it- LOVES it.

This recipe for caramel corn was simple to make.  Other recipes I have used in the past do not taste as I imagine caramel corn does but this one hits it dead on.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Simple. Amazing. Not sure if we will have any left in an hour. I used regular popping corn instead of microwaved.

Great recipe! I was looking for a caramel corn recipe that didn't end up like the stuff in the box with the prize. This was more like the microwave caramel corn act II used to make with the caramel wafer you melt over the popcorn. I made 1/2 the recipe, and it was a lot! I only added a splash of vanilla at the end of cooking, and it tasted great! Thank you!

I have only given this recipe 4 stars because it calls for way too much caramel topping.  I cut the caramel in half and it was perfect.  I didn't have any corn syrup on hand so I used honey.  With these modifications, it would deserve 5 stars!

I made a HEALTHIER low fat/low cal version of this. I used fat free popcorn, SweetNLow brand brown sugar, light corn syrup, light butter, and fat free condensed milk. Turned our perfect. My boyfriend loved it and it made movie night even better!! It was really really chewy the next day and kindof hard to break apart but we ate it all up anyway :) def a keeper

I made this once and liked it, but it was a little too rich...so the next time I made it, I substituted in 1 1/4 cup of white sugar + 1 cup brown sugar and loved it!

I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I used the instructions from another recipe and brought the butter, sugar and syrup to a full boil  and then reduced heat to low for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Then remove from heat and add last three ingredients. Also, did not use microwave popcorn but instead about 1 1/2 cups unpopped kernels. This makes a large amount, two large bowls full. If you're air popping, it takes two batches.

I added the full can of condensed milk by accident, but it was completely divine!  We loved it!  I also used an air popper since I did not have any microwavable popcorn packets.  This is now my go to recipe!

I only took the temp to 250 as my candy thermometer called that 'soft ball' and I wanted soft chewy caramel corn.  Totally worth the time!!!  Oh, the three bags of microwave popcorn translates to 1 1/2 cups of 'Old School' popped popcorn.

My husband and I stumbled across this recipe about two years ago and it has become a huge favorite for us. We make a point to always have the ingredients on hand and I can bribe to do just about anything with the promise of this wonderful treat! Make sure to read the carefully- if you use too much sweetened condensed milk it won't turn out right. It's not an exact science- we eyeball from the can and sometimes use a little extra because we like the caramel pretty soft. We also don't use a thermometer- the first time or two use the water trick, after that we are able to just tell by how long it had cooked and how it looked. This is a very easy recipe- just follow it closely and enjoy!

I've made this a few times now and it's so yummy!  The only thing I add is a good tablespoon or two of vanilla(depends on how much I have on hand).  The vanilla really rounds it out!  This is so worth the effort and a bonus..NO baking!!

Loved the flavor! Very simple to make. A perfect soft caramel popcorn. I cooked the caramel to a soft ball stage. I added half of a 14 oz. can of  sweetened condensed milk. I used half of the caramel over 2 bags of popped popcorn. The ratio of popcorn to caramel was just right. I saved the other half of the caramel to rewarm and use this weekend.  MMM GOOD!

Review per my nine year old son: " Man, this stuff is goooooood! It's gone in two seconds!" I halved the recipe and poured it over one bag of microwave popcorn.  So easy and so good.  I don't use any baking soda because the microwave popcorn has plenty of butter and salt already added.  This is ooey gooey and oh so delicious.

This was absolutely fantastic! I think I ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner until it was gone. It does lose the softness, but a few seconds in the microwave takes care of that. I would definitely suggest spreading it out on wax paper or something before it hardens, or else it is impossible to pull some off. I will definitely make this again!

I totally messed up the directions and it still came out good!  I accidently put the condensed milk in at the same time as the other ingredients and so it just took a very long time for the caramel to get to the right temperature.  Delicious!

I have discovered that I don't like soft caramel corn.  It is so overly chewy and sticks to your teeth like none other.  It's a personal preference but I think I will stick to non-chewy caramel corn.

Fantastic! I wanted something I could make ahead and divide into individual portions for my son's kindergarten Christmas cookie exchange when we got a last-minute notification that the treats needed to be gluten-free (!). I didn't want anything that would turn into concrete. Here's what I did:
Cooked my popcorn in a popcorn maker - for this recipe I used two big batches of popcorn (1/2c kernels each batch) and still had some leftover caramel sauce! At the end I made an extra 1/4 cup kernels and used the rest of the sauce for us. :)
I cooked the caramel just to softball stage, which happened much more quickly than I expected on medium heat. I have a candy thermometer and it was just over 200F. I was a bit concerned because when I took it off the heat, there were obvious butter globules that hadn't incorporated. However when I stirred in the condensed milk (1/2 of a 300ml can) they incorporated beautifully. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla at this point. 
I separated the popcorn into 4 bowls and salted it lightly. I had used salted butter so I didn't want to overdo it. 
One at a time, I put a batch of popcorn in a large metal bowl and poured on caramel sauce until it looked right. Didn't want to be stingy! I used about 3 ladle scoops for each batch. Then, I spread it out thinly on wax paper on a cookie sheet. Each batch was perfect for a cookie sheet. Then I started with the next batch, etc. It didn't take very long at all. 
We ate "our" portion (the leftover sauce with popcorn ma

So yummy and easy. Just make sure you have a massive bowl, for how much this makes. I mixed small batches in smaller bowl then dumped into my really big bowl. 
IMPORTANT: 
- note 5 ounces is 150ml for Canadians, so 5 tbsps. 
-  if you make popcorn from scratch 2 cups of popcorn. 
Also adding some sea salt after goes really well with it.

I made this for the gaggle of nieces & nephews along with my kids and the ones I baby sit. About 12 children in all. I halved the recipe and used air popped popcorn. I Salted the popcorn but did not butter it at all. I tried to follow the recipe but ended up being a tad short on corn syrup but it still turned out very yummy. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a fourth of a tsp of baking soda at the very end of the caramel mixture. Otherwise I followed the recipe. this turned out very yummy and the kids ate the huge bowl that it made. I still think it might have been a tad too much caramel for my tastes but the kiddos all devoured it. I have had a very hard time in the past finding a good caramel popcorn recipe. This is now my go-to!

I really enjoyed this recipe too. I made a variation of this recipe that works very well too. Like W.E. the Cook, I make my popcorn outside of the microwave. For my family, we pop 1 cup of unpopped popcorn. Since I was low on corn syrup, I used honey. It turned out very tasty. I also did not realize the can was 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk. It was still a hit in my home.

This is a great recipe but don't cook so long. Just to soft ball stage. I made the popcorn in my air popper, and added about a teaspoon of salt. Soft and chewy, not crunchy.  Make sure you look at the ounces on your can of milk. Mine was 14 oz, so I had to use about 1/2 the can.

Flavor is bang on! My only problem was my bags of popcorn were 2.75oz not 3.5oz so I popped an extra bag just to use up the Caramel I had left. I wish I had thought of it sooner I would have just used it for dipping apples in. The softness of it makes it perfect for popcorn balls and that what I ended up doing with the remaining caramel corn. I would like the pieces of corn to be more individual then all glued together when eating it from bowl but all in all it was goood.
