Italian Chickn'pea Haiku: "Chickpea explosions! My mouth loves all the flavors! Just needs more veggies." In other words, wonderful dinner, and one in which chickpeas can certainly stand proudly in pasta's place. I cooked the chicken in 1" pieces, went a smidge less on the rosemary, added 1/2 med. onion to the garlic saute, and also tossed in a half-bag of frozen (thawed, drained) spinach, and Italian parsley for a bit more color. It definitely has a kick, but it all comes together quite nicely for a marvelous meal. Next go-around (yup, I will gladly make this again), I may, along w/ my inclusions from above, add some diced tomatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms as well, and go lighter on the cayenne & crushed red peppers.

Ok, i am not sure how I am the only one who is mentioning that yes this recipe is good but it is WAYYYY TOO SPICY!  I followed the recipe to a "t" and my 8, 6 & 4 year olds mouths were burning.  So were my husband and I's and we like spicy food.  My bottle says "crushed red pepper" and there are a lot of seeds mixed in with the flakes.  I am not sure if it is just my kind of red pepper, but WOW, this was almost not edible because of the heat. THe flavor was good though and I WILL make again as my kids love garbanzo beans, but I will omit the red pepper next time.

We really enjoyed this. My husband insisted on having his chicken over pasta, but I didn't think anything was necessary beyond the chickpeas. I only had two chicken breasts which I cut into pieces. I do question whether the sauce would be enough for four. I halved the cayenne pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. It still had plenty of kick. I will make this again, but I think I will cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces the next time. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I made this recipe for my one year old using all organic ingredients.  The only changes I made were to sub the can of tomato sause, italian seasonings and cayenne with about 3/4 of a jar of prepared pasta sauce (which already included seasonings).  It was fantastic!  Because it was for my one year old, I lightly chopped the chicken and chickpeas in the processor then added some cooked quinoa for added nutrition.  It tasted so good.  My baby loves it!

LOVED THIS!  Made this last night w/ 4 smallish blsl chicken breasts, and they were GREAT!  I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I left that out, that was the only change I made, and we thought it was delish!  My son liked the "chicken peas"  lol

This was easy and amazing. I am completely new to Italian food; never having liked the Olive Garden except for the soup and salad. After reading other reviews I did cut up my chicken, and rather than reduce the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, I simply added another can of tomato sauce. This did not dilute the flavor in my opinion, it all still tasted great and my kids didn't complain too much about the spice. Thanks for a great 'real Italian' recipe I will definitely make this again!
Oh and I added half a package of frozen spinach; it was great!

It was delicious! Both me and my husband loved this so it's going into the weekly rotation I think! I added a green bell pepper cut into bite size pieces and some dehydrated onion. I had 2 bone in chicken thighs so I used those. If you decide to use bone in chicken adjust the cooking times to get them done all the way through. I halved the recipe and there was more than enough for 2 people. Good stuff!

Thank you for a wonderful, traditional "jersey" recipe variation! The flavors are outstanding, and the dish certainly lends itself to the addition of more  Mediterranean veggies very easily. The red pepper spices here give  so much more than mere heat- they literally warm the olive, rosemary and tomato flavors of the dish to add both depth and to bring up the sunny character of true Italian coastal village food. Superb recipe, Kristin- Nana  must be very proud of you!

This is a very good dish that's easy to make.  The only change I made was to omit the cayenne, and for our tastes it was hot enough with just the red pepper flakes.  Oh, and I did use fresh rosemary, which I believe enhanced the rosemary flavor I love.  We had a little left over spaghetti (without sauce) that my husband served his over.  The dish has lots of flavor and is different from the usual chicken in tomato/spaghetti sauce.

This was great and smelled so good while cooking!  If you don't have chickpeas, I think this would be great over rice.  Made my Southern home smell Italian!  Thanks, Kristin.  Our family likes a little heat and this was just perfect.

This was good, but just a little too spicy for our taste.  Next time I would decrease the pepper and maybe add a little more Italian seasoning instead.

Love this recipe, but it was WAAAAY to spicy for my family.  I now leave out the cayenne pepper and use half the recommended amount of red pepper.  When we don't have any tomato sauce I use a can of diced tomatoes.  Still very good with this variation.

This was a very good recipe. I cut it in half as I only wanted to make 2 chicken breasts. I also cut down the cayenne pepper in half because I am a wimp when it comes to spicy. I kept the amount of tomato sauce and garbanzo beans the same though. The sauce kind of reminded me of pizza sauce. Very good flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good!  I changed it just slightly after reading some reviews: I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking it, went easy on the cayenne and red pepper flakes and served it over angel hair pasta.  I'll make this again and again!

This was very good ... I added a chopped onion, a handful of chopped mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes, Italian style.  I did cut the cayenne in half, like others suggested ... and next time I'll cut it in half again.  It was too spicy and the cayenne overpowered the rest of the flavors.  We actually LOVE spicy foods, but this didn't enhance the flavors ... it took over.  I will add a zucchini and a yellow squash next time and make it more of a complete meal.

I liked this one, and it was pretty easy to throw together too.  I used 3 chicken breasts, flattened them out (they were huuuge) and cut them in half for a total of 6 thin, smaller sized breats (which was a good portion size for me & also helped them cook through evenly).  I used only like 2 shakes of red peppers, after reading other reviews and worrying it might be too spicy for me.  It was just right, and I am not super tolerant of spicy stuff.  Other than that, made the recipe directly as stated and served it over whole wheat pasta with a side of sauteed zucchini & onions.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This was an odd one for 3 reasons:  First, the addition of chickpeas seemed "off" to me, but was actually delightful.  Second, there is no salt added at all and it is not missed.  Third, using both cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes seemed excessive, but then again, that turned out ok as well.  Be aware, however, that this one packs some heat!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which we prefer.  Also, this dish cries out for some plain pasta or rice on the side to soak up all of that rich, spicy sauce.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe exactly as directed only to discover that no one in the family likes rosemary. Loved the sauce and the chickpeas-I think that next time I'll have to leave out the rosemary or use another herb instead. Really easy recipe!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it had more of a tomato sauce, pasta sauce consistency and taste. Delicious! The next time instead of adding tomato sauce, I added diced Italian tomatos and no sugar. Threw in a handful of Kalamata olives (because I love them) and the dish was even better in my opinion.

maybe on the east coast garbanzo beans are more tender than they are here in CA.. or maybe that's why we only put them in our salads.. go fig.. i felt like they should have been cooked longer rather than just heated.. unlike most everyone i enjoyed the spiciness & the herb blend was totally on it.. i dont like my marina sauces sweet so instead i added seasoned salt.. seemed a lil on the dry side to me.. maybe i did something wrong b/c all the pics look pretty saucy to me

Tasty dish but if children are going to eat this dish reduce the spice by at least half. Super spicy!

I LOVED this meal. I would rate it 5 stars BUT the amount of spice is far too high. I'm a big fan of spicy but I cut the cayenne & red pepper flakes in half and it still had quite the kick. I would definitely recommend this and will be cooking again, just with about 1/2 the spice. I served with a small side of pasta but I found it held up great without it.

I loved it! So different, at least in our house. We aren't spicy people, tho, so I diced some fresh red pepper and threw it in, in lieu of cayenne and crushed red pepper flakes. I will make this again!

Mmm - this was tasty! My wife and I both loved it. 

I made a veganized version of the dish, using two packages of WestSoy seitan. Seitan is a wheat gluten-based veggie meat that has a taste and texture very similar to chickn in recipes. The only difference in preparation was that I didn't have to cook the seitan as long once I returned it to the pan, since there was no concern f undercooked meat.

This was very, very good, but like other reviewers said, it is spicy.  I like spicy, so I really enjoyed the dish, but if I was cooking for children, I would definitely cut back on the cayenne and red pepper. I added a chopped onion and pepper when sautéing the garlic, just to bulk it up a bit.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was very excited to try this recipe after so many positive reviews, but I have to say I was very disappointed.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and the rosemary was the ONLY spice I could taste. It was almost inedible.  If I were to make it again, and I won't, I would leave out the rosemary until the very end-and then add it to taste.

Good recipe, I tried it out this week and it turned out fabulously! I made a few changes- I don't like spice, so I didn't add the cayenne pepper or the crushed red pepper. I also added some chopped tomatoes and extra garlic. Delicious!

This was really good! I did not have the chickpeas so added garbanzo beans - still wonderful. Did cut back on the "heat" and only added 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper and eliminated the red pepper flakes.  Just a personal preference.  Will make again!

Excellent recipe!  Very flavourful and satisfying.
It was something my whole family loved and was perfect for my son who needs to eat gluten-free.

I added a red pepper, zucchini, can of diced tomatoes and stirred in a bag of spinach with the beans at the end, then served it with quinoa.
Will definitely be making this again.

Another family favorite.  Again, this recipe is easy and delicious.  The only thing I did different was instead of using tomato sauce, I used a can of diced and seasoned tomatoes.  You can generally find it with the tomato sauce and paste. But, it's definitely not necessary. It's great as is.

Good stuff, but previous reviewers are correct about the heat. Eliminate the cayenne and up the red pepper flakes to taste, probably in the range of 1/2 - 1 tsp. For a little more depth and complexity in the sauce, add 1 Tbsp. of balsamic vinegar during the cooking process.

Ok, I like spicy food.  Actually, I LOVE spicy food, but THIS WAS WAAAAY TOO SPICY!  I made the recipe exactly (added salt).  I liked the tomato/chicken/garbanzo combo but won't make this again.

Absolutely awesome recipe.  We're trying to cut down on our meat intake and amp up the veggies so I only used 2 chicken breasts (though they were on the big side) and cubed them then added mushrooms and spinach as well.  The ratio of ingredients was perfect that way and I couldn't have wanted more chicken!  This recipe is definitely a keeper with or without the tweaks!

I added a can of diced tomatoes and one chopped onion and it was delicious!!!  I did not add the pepper flakes as I was making it for my whole family and the children would have found it too spicy.  I will defintely put this in the dinner rotation!

My husband and I loved it! I had 20 mins to prepare the meal and plate it before he got home from work. I had zero time to defrost chicken, NO tomato sauce, No Italian seasoning--So I CHEATED and used the canned Chicken breast from Costco and about 5 fresh diced tomatoes. 

Sautéed smashed garlic and drained chicken in the olive oil w/ rosemary, and about 3 pinches of dry basil, to get an "Italian seasoning" taste . As the chicken browned, I diced 5 Organic Roma tomatoes, and threw them in with the cayenne, red pepper flakes, bay leaves(3) and subbed sugar with tomato bouillon because we aren't fond of sweet and lacked the saltiness of tomato sauce. 

Added the chick peas and stirred it all together with about 1/3 cup of water and allowed it to simmer with the cover on. Removed it from the heat and topped it all with 2 fresh chopped basil leaves, and chopped sun dried tomatoes.  

All the flavors infused so nicely together, I know an Italian grandmother somewhere would've slapped me for  my improvisation.  I used fresh tomatoes, dry and fresh basil, 2 extra Bay leaves, Sun Dried tomatoes and some tomato bouillon. But hey:

Prep: 5 mins 
Cook: 7-10 mins  
Plate: 5 mins
I had enough time to plate it and set the table. Served the dish with some wine and made it look like I slaved in the kitchen. =)

I've made this three times and my family and I absolutely love it!  No wonder it's a tradition!  I plan to make it again tomorrow, but this time I will use bone in, skin on chicken thighs.  My photo was too small to upload, so I'll try again with a new photo.  Thank you for an amazing addition to our collection of traditional recipes! ?

I cut down on the cayenne and red pepper flakes and it was still spicy enough (just right). I served this with a pumpkin risotto (oven baked; found recipe by searching online).

Great!  Made as it but used way more red pepper flakes, I like it spicy!!  Chicken was tender and very flavorful as I think I ended up simmering it longer than teh time stated in recipe.  Will make again as it was very easy as well.

Awesome idea! Way too tomato-tasting for me though. I actually added a mashed sweet potato and that helped. I only put in a dash of red pepper and that was plenty! Served with or without french bread. (sauce only served two people). 
Can top with parmesan and salt and pepper to taste. I also used fresh garlic, onion and celery--loved the celery crunch!

I don't know if I did something wrong but I just did NOT like this and either did my husband. The tomato flavor was just weird with the beans and tasted like it should be over pasta and not beans. I usually like recipes off this site that are rated well so I was surprised at this.

A truly savory dish with a touch of "heat" but not too much! Perfect even if you don't like chickpeas! Gluten-free too! Serve with couscous and a garden salad and you have a great meal.

Tip: Use a mortar and pestle to grind up rosemary and release the flavor. Try it with the crushed red pepper flakes as well.

Tip: Can add chickpeas when creating sauce, toss all in a casserole, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes as well. Good freezer dish as well.

The sauce is delicious! Just flavorful/spicy enough to make the back of my throat feel it..I cooked 3 chicken breasts--used a whole can of chick peas, and added 2 cups of frozen spinach....Think I'd chop the chicks into smaller pieces next time.

I wanted to really really love this, especially since it was so quick, easy and healthy.  It was just OK.  The rosemary seemed to overpower the dish.  I love rosemary, but this wasn't anything great.

I'll give it fast, I'll give it healthy, but it was not the best chicken I've made by far.  My husband wouldn't finish it, I didn't like it but our son did.  In fairness, I did not add the cayenne, just the pepper flakes for heat.  It would have been too hot to add that much cayenne.  I don't know how anyone could eat it then.

Loved it!!  I used fresh rosemary instead of dried (1/2 the quantity) and omitted the sugar.  It was spicy, but that is what made it great.  I also sauted onion and green peppers too.  Def make again!  Maybe more chick peas next time/!?!

I would suspect the heat came from the cayenne pepper not necessarily from the pepper flakes. I haven't made this recipe but I have one I make with shrimp that calls for the same amount of pepper flakes and it isn't too spicy. My kids don't like spice and can handle it.

I thought this was simple but yummy. I used two chicken breasts and cut them into chunks. I didn't have tomato sauce, but I did have a can of diced tomatoes, so I used that instead. I also added some dried chopped onion when I sautéed the garlic.   Super easy. I'll be making this again.

I was trying to use up a can of garbonzo beans.  It was fine and we ate it all, but I'm not in a hurry to make it again.  (It's a sign that we had garbonzo beans to be used up, we obviously are never in a hurry to use them.)

This meal was surprisingly good since I made it with items I had in the cupboard so I didn’t have to go to the store. Love the zip of the cayenne, but didn’t put in as much as recipe said. I used spaghetti sauce because that’s what I had and I added onions and garlic while sautéing the chicken. Thank u for a useful recipe.

Only change that I made was that I omitted the garlic due to diet restrictions.  It was good.  It was spicy, if that isn't your thing then omit the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.  It makes enough sauce that you can put it over pasta.  I will make again.

Tasted good but it's definitely not a filling main entree. You need a side or two to go along with it. I don't understand what the greens are in the picture. This doesn't call for any fresh herbs.

I made this tonight and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did change a few things because I wanted to use what I already had on hand and what worked for our particular tastes. I did not use the 2 tablespoons of olive oil just misted a non-stick pan with olive oil. I used less rosemary just a small sprinkle on each side. I also used one clove of garlic instead of three. Instead of tomato sauce, which I did not have in the house, I used Italian stewed tomatoes. I left the cayenne out entirely. I just can't tolerate super hot foods. I know this isn't a review of the exact recipe posted but with the changes I made to suit our preferences, it was delightful. I served it over egg noodles.

Delightful and easy recipe. Added about 3/4 of an onion finely chopped and a red bell pepper. I didn't have any bay leaves or red pepper flakes, so added a bit more Italian seasoning and a good dash of paprika to give the sauce a bit of depth in flavour . Also made a batch using quorn chicken pieces in place of real chicken for a friend and it went down a treat! Will definitely be making again.

At first I thought it a bit too sweet for me, even after omitting the sugar.   But when all came together it was really tasty!  I omitted hot pepper and added fresh spinach and a can of Italian tomatoes.  Sounds like I changed a lot but I used spices as directed and my changes shouldn't have drastically changed the flavor.   The chickpeas really made the dish I thought.    Served with linguine- my 8 year old loved it and husband thought it quite tasty and had seconds.     It bailed me out for dinner  when my pantry was pretty bare as most items were staples, so thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  It looks complicated at first, but it's really not.  I didn't add extra oil after browning the chicken; there's plenty of oil and juices still in the pan, so it's really not a problem.  I did serve it over pasta, just bc I thought it would be good with it, and it was.  I served with salad and Texas Toast, and it made for a large meal.  I love the flavors, and the addition of chickpeas is a bit unexpected but still lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I left out all of the cayenne pepper and used just the crushed red pepper flakes.  Served over rice.

I added half a chopped onion. Wonderful recipe.Tne amount of spice was just right for me I would call it medium heat. however I really like spicy foods so if you palate is not so good with heat then temper it down a little.

I loved this but the rest of my family thought it was "OK".  I like the flavors and the chickpeas and it was even better the next day for lunch.

My husband doesn't like chickpeas so I made a side of pasta instead. It was definitely spicy, but great!!

I love this recipe. My husband is not a fan of chickpeas so I make it whenever he has steak( I'm not a fan of). I add a box of frozen collards or mustard greens. The seasoning is perfect, and there is always plenty for leftovers. Even better the next day.

Really simple and yummy!  Per Solimar's review, I cut the cayenne and red pepper flakes by half, since my 92-year-old mother doesn't really even like a hint of spice.  It was perfect for me this way, but I knew it would still be too spicy for her so I blended some cream cheese into her portion (Wow - now THAT was tasty, but I try to keep the fat grams down for the rest of us!) I used basil, oregano, a little thyme and marjoram for my Italian seasonings.

Pretty good! I cut up the ckn first to bite size for a better/faster cooking time. I had a jar of Butternut Squash pasta sauce from Costco, so I used that instead of making my own sauce. I also took the advice of others and added my own veggies (broccoli and edamame beans). I also sprinkled parsley flakes in with the rosemary and just a pinch of crushed red pepper. Everything was cooked in one pot, which I love. I will make this again soon....just switch up the veggies and sauce and you have a whole different dinner!

We loved this recipe, I did cut back the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I doubled the garlic. 
The only thing I would say, we wished we had more sauce, next time I will add more tomato sauce, garlic, spices, chickpeas, etc.  I also think it might be good to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.    It smelled so good cooking! 
OVERALL, WONDERFUL!

This was really GREAT. I like Garbanzo's and in this dish they really work well. I did not use the cayenne because there is no way the kids would have eaten it with more heat than the crushed red pepper provided.  I used brown sugar instead of white only because I like the flavor it can ad.

This was really good and I'm making it again soon. I might try chicken thighs and a longer cooking time.

Thanks for a good recipe, it's a keeper.

DELICIOUS!

I halved the chicken (which I pulled into smaller chunks), doubled the rest of the ingredients (since that's where the flavor was), and omitted the cayenne (since reviews said it was too spicy). Served over rice.

This is definitely becoming a regular addition to my menu - simple, elegant, and so, so tasty.

Made this tonight, it was slightly on the spicy side, so I add more sugar to dull it down a bit. Also added, italian style diced tomatoes, and mushrooms and chopped up the chicken when I added it back into the sauce. Might make it again, but with black beans vice the chickpeas, my kids complained about them, but me and the husband didn't mind .

I thought this was a very easy and good recipe that I will make again.  I liked replacing the pasta with chickpeas - they are filling so you eat less, and also a healthier option than regular pasta.  I did not find it at all spicy as some people claimed, in fact, I think I would increase the cayenne pepper next time.  I made the sauce exactly as the recipe called, but I used pre-cubed chicken instead, and I cut the amount of chicken in half and replaced it with zucchini and broccoli.  Overall, mine turned out great!

Loved this recipe!  It was a bit too spicy for my husband, but I loved it.  So if you have kids that don't like hot, cut down on the cayenne pepper & add it to your own plate later.  I also added zucchini and fresh mushrooms.  What a perfect dish!

I just made this for dinner. It was great! I used chicken thighs and topped with goat cheese crumbles. Also, I didn't have any "Italian Seasoning" so I made my own. Didn't think it was too spicy.

Made this for two hungry teenage boys after their hockey game.  It was great!  Lots of protein and filling.  I pounded the chicken breasts a little before cooking to make them more tender and simmered an extra 10 minutes.  Also used half of the cayenne and no red pepper flakes.  Spice was perfect for us.

This was good and very easy to make. Didn't have chickpeas so I used cannelini beans. No Rosemary instead sprinkled the chicken with a summer savory blend of spices. My husband was surprised by the dish and thought it was very good. Served with roasted broccoli, brussel sprouts and green beans. He pourd the remaing sauce over the veggies. Overall will make it again.

Wow - this was incredibly unique and SO easy to make! I think fresh rosemary would be a good alternative. I made it a little more spicy to suit our tastes and my husband was stunned by the robust flavor!

These were terrific and addictive! Only thing I did differently was that I used canola oil 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of butter vs all butter. I only did this because I did not have enough butter in the house. Turned out fine. So soft and the perfect balance of molasses.
