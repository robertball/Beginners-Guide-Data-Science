I think this recipe would be better if I made my own alfredo sauce, or even just a simple white sauce with cheese.  There is plenty of time to do that while the vegetables are roasting.  The cheese on the top forms a thick layer that is almost like another noodle layer.  My family liked this dish, but not all of them went back for seconds, which is what they would do if they loved it.
