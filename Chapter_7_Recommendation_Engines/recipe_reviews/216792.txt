This was very good!  The lemon really lightens up the soup.  The only thing I did different was instead of discarding the veggies, I used a stick blender and just pureed them into the broth.  I might also try adding a bit of lemon zest next time to enhance the lemon flavor.  Nice change from my regular chicken soup, will definitely make again.

Thanks for this exquisite recipe!  I, as did one other reviewer, blended the vegetables into the soup for added flavor and nutrition.  I think that I will add in lemon zest as well next time too to enhance the very lemony flavor which I love.

Beautiful soup! Filling and delicious. I used my home-made chicken stock instead of the whole chicken, then added some chicken breasts, which I shredded. Also good without the extra chicken meat. Elegant and simple, like most things that impress.

I don't know if I did something wrong when adding the eggs, but it was blah! My husband refused to eat it.

Good starting point.  I wanted to recreate a soup that is served at a local restaurant.  This soup was a bit thinner, the egg flavor was less strong, and the lemon was more of a sour flavor - as opposed to a bright flavor (holla if you hear me!).  I like a strong chicken flavor, but did not want to mess with all the skimming so I used 2 lbs split, bone-in chicken breast and replaced the water with chicken stock.  Hubby hates veggies, so I removed them as the recipe suggests, but if I had my druthers, I'd chop them up, leave them in, and reduce the amount of chicken.  PS... be sure to FOLD the yolks into the egg whites (rather than beat in the mixer) or it will be frothy.  Despite the differences, the whole family enjoyed the soup.

Very good. I added extra lemon juice to my bowl. I also took the other's advice and added the veggies after sticking them in the blender, but I just added a few spoonfuls to my own bowl. Seems like maybe some herbs could be added. Not sure what to add but it is kind of a mild soup. Very good though, and I got seconds!

Lovely traditional recipe. If you are used to traditional Greek food it is perfect as written. I've been back in the US for a couple years and after tasting the broth I threw in one bullion cube.

This recipe is wonderful.  I made a few changes, but none that would really detract from the quality of the soup as written in the recipe.  I made a chicken pot pie and had many left over ingredients.  I used the celery, carrot, onion and the carcas of a rotisserie chicken to make the stock.  (I boiled the stock all day).  After I discarded all bones and vegetables, I added a handful of onions, peas, mushrooms, carrots and celery.  I added the pasta and followed the instructions to include the egg and lemon mixture.  This is a keeper.  It was warm and comforting while being tasty and rich at the same time.  Perfect.
