I'm always looking for different uses for avocado and sweet potatoes so this seemed like the perfect experiment. I didn't have the red onions so I substituted with a shallot, I don't think that made much of a difference but I will use the red onion next. I really liked the mixture of flavors and textures and would definitely make again. It's really such a simple mixture of ingredients, that sound like an unusual mixture but I really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for submitting.

This was different, and I thought it was good! I liked the sweetness of the potatoes w/ the flavors of the avocado mixture. I was worried how everything would work together, but it was nice, and a nice change from the usual. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this last night but highly nervous because the flavor combo seem crazy!  I was so fantastic!!!  My 14 year old daughter (soon picky) was so mad that I only made 1 sweet potato per person.   Next time, I am going to add blue chips and serve as a appetizer because it will be fantastic!  So simple I just loved it!

Surprisingly, this was good.  However, I'm only giving it four states because it kind of seemed like a waste of good avocados because the overall taste was mild, like a sweet potato with a creamy  butter on it.

I didn't believe it even after reading the reviews but this was good! I only had a half of an avocado but had store bought guacamole so mixed those two together. Really different and we like different in our house.

It was very good.  You need more than 2 avocados though. I would say an avocado per potato

This odd combination is scrumptious! I've made it several times now, the only change is the addition of Tony's Seasoning to the guacamole.

Trying to eat cleaner diet, no sugar, gmos etc, finding a sweet potato recipe with out brown sugar was sweet! I didn't have red onion, used sweet white onion, it didn't hurt a thing. my husband and I both loved it.plus adding avocado to anything is a plus. we will keep it on the recipe list
