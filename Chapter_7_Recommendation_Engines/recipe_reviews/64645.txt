My 2 year old daughter wouldn't even touch it.  No offense but i will NEVER use this recipe again.  And I would NEVER recommend this to others either.  Sorry.

This did not turn out well for me.  Perhaps I coated the chicken too heavily with the ketchen/mustart sauces and cereal?  I added cumin, oregano, and chili powder to the sauce and it tasted OK.  Maybe less mustard and more ketchup would help.  I coated some of the chicken with crushed cereal rather than not.  Regardless, it looked pretty unappealing the pan and tasted a few degrees south of 'okay'.  I plan to rinse the sauce & batter from the remaining chiken and recycle it into a salad.

We did not care for this recipe at all! We couldn't even eat it. Just the taste of the cocoa krispies on there was unpleasant.

My family views this recipe as an "experience"--it wasn't awful, and it was almost good. But, we decided that we wouldn't want to do it again.

No offense to the recipe holder, I appreciate the new yet odd recipe, cos some are amazing. This is just really really not right.

When I was young we used to make something like this, but with regular Rice Krispies - not chocolate cereal.  As I recall it was OK but not a favorite of mine.  My little sister always wanted it though.

I substitute breadcrumbs for Chocolate Cereal.

 350 in a preheated oven. 35-45 Min.

When it's done, pour a drizzle of dill pickle juice on each piece.

It's a Chicken Sandwich!

Nothing about this dish worked.  The ketchup-mustard blend didn't work well with chocolate covered rice krispies.  Just the wrong flavor combinations.
