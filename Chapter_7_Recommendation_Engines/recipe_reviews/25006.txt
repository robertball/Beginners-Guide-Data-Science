First of all I wish that when posting these recipes the information given is correct. When baking time is off, and ingredients aren't to the letter making a quality product is next to impossible. I baked this cake as instructed, and the result was terrible. 90 minutes is way too long for this cake to bake, and I do not know if it was a mistake but 3 and I love cinnamon, tablespoons of cinnamon is a bit much. And not only that but after baking for an hour the crust was hard, and the cake was dry. I wasted 20 dollars on ingredients, and was less than pleased. If I try it again I'll deffinitely make modifications.

This is a perfect base recipe for Sock It To Me Cake! I prefer from scratch, and I get so many requests for this cake. I've altered this recipe somewhat to make it a little richer for my own personal tastes, but I highly recommend this! Thanks for contributing.

This is basically a sour cream pound cake with a strip of nuts and spice in the center.  The flavor of the cake is very good, but it came out a bit dry.  Although 90 minutes is a good rule of thumb for a traditional pound cake, the oven temp for this one is a bit higher, so a shorter baking time may yield a moister cake.  It's definitely worth baking again.

This cake was incredibly moist and delicious. In the past I've used other recipes and always felt the cake was too dry. I did make variations to the recipe. 1. I only added 2 TBSP of cinnamon, I added another 1/2tsp of mexican real vanilla (delish!), I also added a little butter in the cinnamon, sugar, nut layer. It helped bind and saturate the layer. The biggest thing is that I only baked the cake for 65 minutes in the oven. 90 would have RUINED it.  So, I guess I should say that with the tips people gave and some of my own, it became the best Sock It To Me can I've ever EVER had. I would highly suggest the way I baked it.

This was the best from-scratch cake I have ever made. We all loved the smooth, light texture and the cinnamon/sugar/nuts filling. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 Tbsp. instead of 3, otherwise it would have been a bit too strong. Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

A very good cake. I curious if there was a typo on the cinnamon. It was a bit much for my taste. Next time I will use 3 tsp. instead of the 3 tbsp that it called for.

Great recipe! My cake turned out beautifully. The 90 minute baking time is WAY too long for this cake. Mine was completely baked in 45 minutes. I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and I used 12 ounces of sour cream. I also drizzled a glaze of milk and confectioner's sugar on the slightly warm cake. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this cake for a birthday girl at work, co-workers loved it.  It is not too sweet.  I did increase the nuts to 1 cup.  The birthday girl was trying keep it from disappearing so that she could take it home.

This was almost perfect.  My bundt pan was dark and the crust seemed to come out thick.  Other than that the cake was DELICIOUS!  And I only had to cook it for 60 minutes.

This cake is DELICIOUS!  I got compliments saying that it tasted like real bread because of the softness of the center.  It's a great recipe and really really good!

I was raised on the version of this cake that starts with a box of cake mix - I put this one over it in my cookbook!  This cake was moist and had a great flavor.  I only baked it for about 50 minutes to a clean toothpick.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe, just needs a little tweaking. Back oven temp down to 325, bake for 70(seventy) minutes, I like 1tbs cinnamon  to 1 1/2tbs, and I added and extra 1/2tsp of vanilla. It came out awesome, very popular.

I'm glad I read the reviews because it helped me change the process a bit.  I reduced cinnamon to 1 tbsp.  I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Baking time was complete at 55 minutes.  Definitely more like a pound cake instead of the box mix version which is more spongey.  This was very good with our modifications, and I would definitely make it again.

great alternative to a mix.
Been making this cake forty years,
My original recipe says to mix 2 T powdered sugar, 1 t cinnamon and 2 T nuts in the bottom of pan before pouring half the mixture in. then 2 T brown sugar 1 T cinnamon and 2 T nuts in middle layer. It is all about personal taste. I made this recipe just like my old one and it was excellent!

This cake is a it too heavy. I suggest usingthe Baker's German Chocolate cakerecipe as a base and omit the chocolate. As previous reviewers mentioned, you should probably use three teaspoons of cinnamon and not tablespoons. With the left over nut mixture, sprinkle on the top layer of batter before placing pan in oven.

I followed the recipe exactly except the baking time.  I only baked 1 hour but the cake is still very dry.  It has a good taste but it is just not a moist cake.  If I bake the cake again, I will only bake for 50 minutes.

I only had to bake this for an hour. Thank goodness I decided to check it then. Good flavor but I think even after an hour it was a little over done. Next time I think I'd alternate the cake layers and filling layers at least twice.

The cake is delicious but baking for 90 minutes at 350 degrees? I took it out at 70 minutes and I wish I'd checked it at 60 minutes at the latest because it's dry and has a hard crust. I'll definitely bake this again but shorten the baking time. Love that it's from scratch.

Once this cake cooled, it is so DRY!! 90 minutes is way TOO long to bake this cake!!! The "flavor" of this recipe is good, so we'll try it again, but we'll check it for "doneness" at intervals after the first 35 to 40 mins.

definately enjoyed making this cake although a bit to much cinnamon will only use 1tbsp instead of three add more nuts and decrease cooking time by 30 minutes.

This cake was ok the texture was not what i expected a little rubbery. Maybe i baked it 2 long I baked it for 1 hour on 325 i also made a few changes with the cinnamon based on the reviews.  Instead of vanilla extract i used 3/4 tbls rum extract a drop of vanilla extract & a drop of lemon extract. The cake flavor was great only if the texture was right this would have been a good cake.

Too long cooking time...50 minutes is good.  Cinnamon must be a typo...3 T is way to much even for a cinnamon lover.  Other than that, it is a good recipe and will use it again with adjustments.

Excellent recipe. As with other reviewers I found 70 minutes to be the time I needed for baking. Moist and crumb was nice. I used 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 T coffee for glaze. I made this for meals on wheels and after portioning added the glaze. Will repeat because I do not have cake mixes in my pantry.

I didn't make any changes per say, but I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions, and I made 2 layers of the filling rather than just the one! Will definitely make again!

This cake was very easy to make. I baked it in a tube pan. Cake was very tall and moist.  I read the other reviews so I only added 1 tablespoon on cinnamon and almost 1 cup of pecans.  I did add a little butter to my pecan/cinnamon/brown sugar mixture.  I baked it at 325 for 75 minutes like the reviews stated. It was absolutely PERFECT!

After reading the reviews and keeping in mind this is a basic sour cream pound cake with a layer of cinnamon, sugar, and pecans, I adjusted the recipe and cooking time just a little...used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 3.....made sour cream from buttermilk and butter for additional moisture.....decreased cooking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes.....and glazed while hot.  Beautiful cake, and beautiful texture.

Probably won't make again.  Baked for 60 minutes..  That's too long.  Recipe says bake 90 minutes.  Not too sweet.  3 tablespoons of cinnamon is totally off.  Dry and hard top crust.  Nooo!

Gluten Free Substitution.....
My husband and I are gluten free and so I changed it up to use the Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Baking Flour and I added enough Vanilla Almond Milk to make the batter a little more moist for pouring. I didn't cut it right after glazing it. It wasn't until I read some of the reviews here that I got worried about it being dry or hard that I cut into it. I tasted it, took a piece to my husband and waited for the outcome.....HE LOVED IT!! My husband is a sweets kinda guy! The only thing is that it came out moist like if I had used a banana. I asked him about that part and he said don't change my recipe next time! Keep it just like that. Now I don't know if it will make it in this house until Wednesday for me to take a church friend a slice, as she requested! *The other difference, was I took it out 2 mins earlier than the 90-minute time, but I doubt if much of a difference would have been made.*

This is a beautiful looking cake BUT after making two times and the 3rd I found a boxed mix recipe. Way too dense it needs more mositure. 
Adjustments required: Add a 3rd stick of butter, use sifted  CAKE flour, and MORE FLAVORING, that temp should be no more than 350 (I used 335) for 60 mins, test the center. 
Struessel should be about  2 tbps cinnamon AND 3 tbsp light brown  sugar, mash together with a fork  to blend. Then place in middle of cake batter,  top with nuts then add more struessel on top (use  pieces vs chopped) they are bigger. Lastly , the glaze ( a special glaze not with a lot of confectioners sugar)  I brushed on and then drizzled and will put pecans on top next time. The glaze will harden and secure the nuts.  I bake quite a bit and again the biggest problem was the density.

This is what I was looking for.  I just followed the recipe the way it was.  The only thing I just didn't add the pecans.  I did decreased the amount of cinnamon, but other than that I really love the recipe.  Thank you.
