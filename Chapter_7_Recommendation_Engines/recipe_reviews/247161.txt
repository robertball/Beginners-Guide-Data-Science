This was delicious.  I added 2 TBSP of fish oil, and lemon zest instead of lemongrass and it turned out great.

Despite adding chili oil, salt, and sesame oil this dish had very little flavor.

We loved this soup.  I added only 1 Tbs of Fish Sauce.  l like using this ingredient in Thai dishes. Lovely fresh flavor all around in this dish.    Enjoy!

Tasty and easy. I didnt have fish sauce so I used a splash of soy sauce and I added some shredded carrots
