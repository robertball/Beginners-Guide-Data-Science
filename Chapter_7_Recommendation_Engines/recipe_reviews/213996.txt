Excellent recipe!  Followed it to the letter and it is definetly double dip worthy.  Has a lot of health ingredients, too.

Yum.. I had this with some pita crisps, jicama and carrots.. tasty. I think I liked it with pita crisps the best. I left out the oil because I felt there was enough fat in the avocado.. was great

Pretty good recipe the edamame was hardly distinguishable. My onion may have been extra hot but to me that flavor was a bit too strong. I like the idea of adding an extra avacado and if I make this again I think that's just what I'll do.

OK..this is my first review and I'll be the first to review this.  Loved it!  Very healthy and tasty.  I experimented @ a family gathering and got great reviews.  My husband wanted to keep it all for himself and asked me to make it again.  Sister-in-law suggested an additional avocado...may try next time.

Okay, so I decided to try this out to step away from the normal guac and it turned out really well. I modded the recipe a little to work with what I had in my kitchen. I subbed a stalk of chives for the cilantro, a lime for a lemon and chicken stock for olive oil. I also decided to sweeten the onions up by saut√©ing them in the last drops of my olive oil. And I used two avocados that were medium sized. So the recipe may have been changed around a good bit but the heart of it was the same. The guac/dip/spread had a great nutty flavor while still allowing the richness of the avocado to play with the citrus and spices present.   And just to backup the validity of this seemingly odd recipe, two of my hispanic friends who have grown up with and enjoy authentic guacamole LOVED it. Make this the next time you're looking for a little change of pace!

I made this except for the cilantro because I was out of that, and it was delicious.  I look forward to making it again with the cilantro as that is a favorite of mine.  Thank you!

I thought this dip was amazing!  I removed the olive oil and added a little extra avocado. I also used have lemon and half lime juice for extra zest.  It was amazing.

Goes great with Pita Crackers (Townhouse product). I doubled the avocado as others had advised. My note is that this dip needs to accompany a lower salt type item so its' flavor won't be overshadowed.

This is so much better than guacamole.  I add more avocados, lime juice and the zest of the limes. I use at least 3 limes. This dip downs not discolor because of this. Also I use sweet potato taco chips.
