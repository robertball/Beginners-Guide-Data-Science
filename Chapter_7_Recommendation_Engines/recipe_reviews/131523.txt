This is a wonderful recipe and a crowd pleaser. Everyone commented on how festive it was.  I only subed one item, parsley for the beet leaves, it made the tree look a little more real and festive. I also did one using fruits and a cream cheese dip.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really fun to do!  I even added a styrofoam star at the top of the tree!  My family really enjoyed it and it makes a nice centerpiece on the table.

I loved this! People were afraid to eat it though, but my tree turned out exactly like this one! I added hummus dips at the bottom, and cocktail sauce as well. Don't forget the star on top!

I have done this for several years and everyone loves it.  I set mine up on a mirror and have little ice-skating figures on it.  I also use party picks instead of toothpicks.  They look like more decorations.

I used this idea for Easter...
 cut a Lamb out of the Styrofoam, instead and
used assorted cubed cheeses for the "wool"...black olives
for the eyes, pimentos for the mouth.
spread spinach, crackers and little jars of mustard as a base.
The family was in awe and I DID give you all the
credit (siting this recipe on ALLRECIPES.COM)
You are SO CLEVER & HAVE SUCH IMAGINATION, Mary!!!
You also sparked my own imagination to brew!
For THAT, I can't thank you enough!

Was a hit!  I used two small cones instead of one big one.  Better to use the bigger than small cones.

Fun to make. We added a cheese star on top!  Next year we'll do more with cookie cutter cheese cut outs. Actually wound up keeping the shrimp separate and used other yummy nibbles.
