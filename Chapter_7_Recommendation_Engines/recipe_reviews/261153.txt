Made dough exact to recipe. Dough came out really nice.   Only addition I made was one egg to filling mixture after watching a lot of other videos. Filling was very tasty. I used a little less ginger because my boyfriend is sensitive to the ginger flavor. Will definitely make again. It was a fun group activity to fill and pinch dumplings

A truly delicious recipe! Personally, I would add less sesame oil next time but that's my taste preference. Be patient making your wrappers because it is time consuming if you're a novice like me.

It took a couple of times for me to get it right. The whole boiling thing, it never worked for me. So I read other recipes that said to fry it first and throw in a couple of TBLS of water and that  was great. The flavor was really good though and I got rave reviews will make them again just a few changes

This recipe is the bomb.  We like our pot stickers crispy so we deep fried them. For the ginger because three tablespoons is a lot I peeled it and tossed it in my mini food processor.  Delish!!

Easy to make with the handy dumpling maker we found at the local Asian supermarket.  Very tasty but felt the filling needed a little salt and pepper and will make another batch!

I used ginger powder because didn’t have ginger. I also cooked the pork with all the ingredients (beside the cabbage) already mixed in. Delicious! Make sure you cover them immediately to keep the steam inside the pan.

I've made these twice now and my family loves them. Time consuming (took me 2 1/2 hours from start to finish) but any from scratch are going to be. I put just a little less ginger. The sauce I added one small squeeze of sriracha. Everyone kept talking about how good the flavors were together.  This recipe is a keeper

Turned out great (and with the added satisfaction of making at home)!  I read the "very finely minced fresh ginger" to mean the smallest I could possibly cut it - which took way too long and ended up practically grated. 3 tablespoons of that size was a little too much ginger in the end.  (I should've paid closer attention to the video.)  I also had a good bit of filling left over, but no big deal.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Chef John!

I made these for New Years (pork + cabbage).

This seems to be a recipe that requires a little bit of practice to master... The filling is easy enough to make, but I found my dough to be too soft and wet after it rested.  It's probably a bit like pie dough - practice makes perfect.  It needed a lot (and I mean a lot) of flour as I rolled the dough out.  It was super sticky stuff.

The directions could provide a bit more info on the size of "small scoop" to use in filling the dumplings.  What if you don't have a scoop?  What's the target amount? I have a couple of small scoops, so I wasn't sure which one to use.  I used my 1 tbs scoop, but ended up with quite a bit of filling left over, so I think I would go with the 1.5 tbs scoop next time.  The cooking instructions were spot on.  The hardest part was waiting for the pot stickers to cool down enough to actually eat them :-)  They do need the sauce, because without it, there doesn't seem to be enough saltiness.  They are delicious with the sauce, though.  

When I make these again, I'm going to use ground chicken in place of the pork.  I would also try substituting for the sesame oil -- holy cow that stuff is expensive.  I can't believe 1 tsp would impact the flavor that much.  I also think I'd add some brown sugar to the dipping sauce.  It's salty and sour, and could use just a little sweetness to balance that out.

I love this recipe! the homemade dough was easier than I thought, just make sure to roll them out very thin. They don't have to be perfectly round. I added 1egg yolks to filling after reading the reviews and the inside texture was perfect! Make sure to squeeze the air out of the pot stickers before cooking! Yum!

Excellent! I used pre-made potsticker wrappers. There was so much pork I used 3 packages and still had leftover pork. I used the leftovers in ma po tofu the next night. Yum!

This recipe is dead on to the pot stickers I love to eat at my favorite Chinese restaurant.  And I can make them at home!  Chef John's recipe and instructions were perfect and the potstickers came out beautifully.  Based on other reviews I went a little light on the sesame oil, but I don't think that was necessary.  I will say that I had a good 1/3 of the filling left over and ended up making a 1/2 receipe of the dough to use up the filling.  So, in all, I made 36 potstickers--each with a decent amount of filling.  I did make a mistake and made them the day ahead and put them on a silpat in the fridge overnight.  They got too sticky and if they touched one another, they were hard to separate and the beautiful shape was lost.  Not a good idea!  First, I would put them on a floured cloth and just put them in a container that doesn't touch the tops (no plastic wrap) or each other.  Also, I found that steaming them 3 minutes was a bit too long (maybe be my stove) and I burnt the first batch (though still tasted great!).  2 minutes worked for me.  I think I would like to bring these to a potluck in the future, maybe make them a little smaller for an appetizer.  Yum!!!

I think this recipe is a bit bland as is.  Ive made it several times and finally found a modification I really like.  I left out the cabbage, used 1 cup spring onion,  1/4 raw shrimp, and red pepper flakes.  Very tasty!

I made these today and it was the first time I have ever tried to make potstickers. If you dont have a good amount of experience cooking, I greatly encourage you to make sure to watch the video first. I tend to skip these but they do add a little something you may otherwise miss. I overcooked mine a little because of it.  The flavor was still awesome but they were a little difficult to chew. I will definitely make this again. Good job chef John!

Me and my fiance doubled this recipe because it doesn't say that it makes like 24 of them. We doubled the dough as well and yet there was a good portion extra filling, even though we filled them pretty full. Good recipe but we accidentally made like 48 because the yield wasn't given and there's too much filling.

This recipe is AMAZING! I used boneless pork chops about an inch thick and they came out so juicy and tender. The mushroom wine sauce is the greatest mushroom sauce I’ve ever made. Sooo much flavor! Definitely making this again!!

So delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, with one small change --- I cooked the ground pork first, on low heat until it was cooked but not browned.  Then I added all the other filling ingredients without cooking any further, and chilled that mixture.  I found that a small rolling pin was much easier to maneuver than the pie-sized one.  But I imagine a tortilla press or something like that would be very helpful.  Thanks, Chef John, for another wonderful recipe.

Delicious and fun! Recipe made approximately 23 dumplings. Kind of hard work to put together at first but you get the hang of it. Worth it to watch the “How To” video. Would definitely make these again! We paired them with a peanut butter vinaigrette dressed cabbage slaw. Used peanut butter powder instead of peanut butter.

Always can count on Chef John. Awesome as I expected them to be but I thought you might like a little tweak. One, the hardest part is probably making the dough. Much easier and just as tasty if you use won ton wrappers or similar...saves you half the time. Two, if you make the dough yourself, I would put them in the freezer for a bit to set up and then you can drop them right into some boiling water til they float. Then take them out and finish browning in a saute pan. Bon Apetit. Chef Cosmo

They were fun too make and came out very well.  Also I think I chopped the vegetables a little too fine.  also, needs a little more soy sauce and not as much ginger.  There was way too much filling, but i froze it, so the next batch will go faster. Will definitely make again.

way waaaaaaaay too much ginger--you can't taste the garlic, green onion or cabbage,  so scale it back to just ONE tablespoon

So... We are also doing KETO, so I was never going to make the wraps--I did meatballs.   I used a bag of store bought 16 oz shredded slaw mix and "drained" it with salt.  I'm mad at myself that I forgot to add the cabbage that I salted.  However, the ratio of seasoning of pork to the rest made an amazing meatball.  The meatballs of the filling (minus the cabbage) were awesome.   I did not find the sesame oil overpowering at all without the cabbage.  I ended up adding my salted cabbage to lo mein noodles with a bag of frozen trader Joe's stir fry vegetables.  Spaghetti and meatballs Asian style!!  Super delicious and all 4 of my kids ate it.  Win for me!

This was so easy and delicious! I made using Jimmy Dean "regular" sausage but ground pork from the meat department might even be better.  I will make it again for sure but, next time I will double the recipe!!! lol

I didn't make the whole thing, but the cooking method is the best I've found yet - absolutely perfect!  Didn't make the filling because I already had some, but I will next time - Chef  John is the best!

The filling was phenomenal and the pot stickers really did have that signature juxtaposition of crunchy and soft. Pair it with some hoisin sauce! :-)

I used ground turkey bc that’s what I had it this is amazing!! The shapes of mine were all sorts of sizes but I’ll get better each time. It’s lots of fun and the taste is indeed so much better than take out or store bought! Love this!! Thanks Chef John!!!

I would try to make my dough thinner next time.  Mostly to cut down on calories.

These are so delicious! They are very easy but time consuming. I imagine that it would be much easier to grate the ginger for those who don’t have the best knife skills, and it would take less time. These make great party snacks or hors d’oeuvres but as good as they taste when fresh, they are not as great when reheated so eat ‘em while they’re hot!

Delicious! I made this because it reminded me of the recipe my Chinese friend taught me for Shanghai dumplings. This was not too complicated and totally yummy.
