Very good, though us Brits make the dessert with slices of bread, buttered, cut in triangles and   set upright in the dish. This recipe works both ways and is very tasty. Add different dried fruits for variation. Comfort food at its best!

"Mixed Spice" is a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, ginger, etc. If you Google "English Mixed Spice", you will find several recipes.

This is much more like the bread pudding that my Mum made (back in the UK). In bread and butter pudding you butter slices of bread, layer them with fruit of choice, spice with nutmeg and cinnamon and cover the layers with an egg custard. Include brandy if you're feeling festive!

Made as per the recipe! Absolutely outstanding! I used raisins as my dried fruit and my orange zest came from a Mandarin. I may have added more of this than the recipe called for. Would definitely make this again!

What is the bread and butter pudding?! This was tasty. As to the mixed spices I threw in ginger, all spice,nutmeg, cinnamon and a shake of ground clove but I didn't measure I went by smell (holiday-ish)
