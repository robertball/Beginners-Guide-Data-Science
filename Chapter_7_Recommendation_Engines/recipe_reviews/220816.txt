I really wanted that strawberry flavor to shine--what I did was add one teaspoon of strawberry extract and add an additional teaspoon of confectioners' sugar to make up for the additional liquid. I also added a dash of salt because Grandma taught me to always do so when making homemade frosting. This was FANTASTIC. It turned out like bakery frosting and the family kept eating the frosting off the cake.........and leaving the cake!

Fabulous recipe.  I did use more strawberries (I like the flavor) and ended up not using 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar.  Overall divine!

This was a perfect find for me today! Me and the little guy made some cupcakes that we stuffed w/ Golden Oreos (we were playing, lol), and I was looking for a different type of frosting besides the usual chocolate or vanilla...then I stumbled upon Marianne's pic in the photo pages (Thanks, Marianne!), and I decided that this was it. It also worked out b/c I had some strawberries that were a little past their prime, so what better to do w/ them than make this... LOVED the fresh flavor, and so simple to make too! Thanks, Candice, for a wonderfully delicious frosting~YUM! :)

I had a lots of complements about this frosting. I did make the following changes. I added a little more strawberries (about 1 1/2cups instead of the 1 cup) and added 1/8tsp of almond extract, which brings out the strawberry flavor.

Variations on a theme. At the suggestion of Redneck Grandma, I made MY OWN recipe using oranges instead of strawberries. It is beyond fabulous! TY RNG!!! I knew this recipe could easily be interchanged with other BERRIES, i.e., raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. RNG says she's made this versatile recipe using oranges and loved it. Well, RNG... we love it too. This batch was made for my wonderful neighbor who faithfully mows my yard(and is a Beaver fan). He was delighted and ordered more for the Civil War game yet to come. It did take twice as many oranges, cut up; about 2 cups and a little longer to cook down. But, it was so worth it. I also added orange zest.

Made this frosting yesterday. The flavor was nice and the strawberry certainly came through well but the frosting was a little too sweet and the texture very grainy due to the seed remnants. A smoother creamier frosting would have been preferred.

Fab recipe. I beat the frosting for 4-5 minutes after all the ingredients had been added and it made a lovely fluffy buttercream. I also strained the strawberry pur√©e as I was serving the cupcakes to children and the buttercream was silky smooth. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This will be my go-to strawberry frosting for the future. It has a wonderful, fresh strawberry flavor. I've made strawberry frosting with jam or fresh berries in the past and it always weeps or runs. Reducing the strawberry puree is the key. Will be making again.

I made this recipe the first time when it was a Personal Recipe (06-18-11).  I've made it a couple of times since.  Oh my gosh - you don't need a cupcake for this frosting you just need a spoon! This frosting has incredible strawberry taste. I made 66 mini white cupcakes and I had enough frosting to frost them all. Thank you Candice for creating this recipe. If you like strawberries you will love this frosting. It is MOST definitely a keeper!

Everyone gave this awesome reviews so I'm sure it's something I did wrong. It came out watery. For the butter I used country crock in the tub. Does anyone know why it would be so runny?

Way too buttery. After I made it, I realized it was missing cream cheese. I wont be making this particular recipe again. I however will be making one that has one stick of butter and 8 oz of cream cheese in the frosting. This was basically strawberry flavored butter on the cake. This recipe is NOT a keeper for me.

First..I love this frosting!  That being said...I had a few issues when making it.  First, the recipe calls for 1 cup of strawberries...this doesn't yield enough liquid to reduce for the length of time suggested and still have enough to add the required 6tbs for recipe.  It works best to have once cup of strawberry puree to reduce..not one cup before you puree them.  I only reduced for 15 minutes because it was very thick and there was very little left..1 cup of puree should cure this problem..I ended up with 4tbs of puree. I felt the frosting was coming out to thick as I was mixing it..most likely due to how much I reduced the puree.  I followed the recipe using the 4tbs I had and then blended a few more strawberries and added 2tbs of the puree (not reduced)..this thinned out the frosting perfectly.  I liked it after I made, but I loved it the next day.  As one reviewer pointed out-it is better the next day.  This is the only strawberry frosting I will now use.  It has an intense and wonderful real strawberry taste.  Perfection!

This frosting is delicious!  It may take a little thought beforehand to prepare the strawberries, but it is SOOO worth that step.  My chopped up strawberries slightly overflowed the measuring cup before I carefully reduced it as recommended by the author.  Talk about a fresh yummy frosting!  Thank you so much, Candice!

Really good, but really sweet. I had to add about one more cup of confectioners sugar to get it to cupcake frosting consistency. 20 minutes is too long to cook the strawberries for. I only needed about 10. Overall, way better tasting and looking than all the other strawberry frostings I've tried. Update: I'm changing my 4 stars to 5. The frosting tasted so much better the next day. My friends said the fresh strawberry flavor was very prevalent, like fresh strawberry ice cream in frosting form. Will be my go to strawberry frosting from now on!

This frosting has a delicious fresh strawberry taste and a nice firm texture. The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon salt. I was able to generously pipe frosting on 24 cupcakes.

Absolutely the best strawberry frosting I've ever tasted. I don't know how much sugar I used, I just add it til it looks and tastes right for me. I did add a little salt because I use unsalted butter. Thanks for sharing, Candice!

OMG! this is the best most delicious strawberry frosting in the world! and so easy to make. I only added a pinch of salt and a little more vanilla extract because it was a little too sweet for my taste, it was so goood! I used it to fill a 10" 3 layer vanilla cake and a 8" 3 layer dark chocolate cake for my daughter's birthday. Everybody had to have more :) I totally recommend it. I'm making more today to decorate some 4th of July red velvet cupcakes :) yum!  Make sure you take out the seeds and it will be perfect! I have been making this recipe since 2012 and it is always perfect!  Just use 2 c sugar to begin and taste it and go from there adding sugar if needed and according to your taste. enjoy!

Finally a frosting with real strawberries!  Thank you Candice for such a delicious and easy frosting (even with the step of making the strawberry puree).  I did have to add a bit more sugar to make it thick enough to frost cupcakes.  But, it was the perfect topping to chocolate cupcakes!

I'm never buying those shelf frostings.  I made this with mango (I didn't have strawberries) and it turned out very yummy. 

I was confused about the amount of sugar...the lists of ingredients say 3 1/2 cup but the directions says otherwise.  I only used 2 1/2 (and will try less next time).

This was delicious! I made a variation using blueberries.  I reduced 1  cup fresh blueberries then followed the recipe exactly.  The yield was enough to generously frost the middles of 3 eight inch layers. Will definitely make again.  Thank you Candice :)

I "peeled" my strawberries to remove the seeds.  This reduced the gritty texture, but still left an amazing fresh strawberry flavor.  I used them on jello poke cupcakes (lemon cake, strawberry gelatin) to make strawberry lemonade cupcakes.  Thank you for the recipe, it is wonderful!

Delicious! One of the best frosting recipes I have ever used. I can't tell you how delicious this is! It is THAT good! I doubled the recipe and it frosted a 2 layer 9" cake with some left over. Only change I made was used both butter and crisco equally - just because that is what I had on hand. Time was spot on when it came to reducing the puree. Fabulous frosting! Thank you!

It is a really easy and good frosting recipe. Without a electric mixer, I hand-whipped butter at room temperature with a fork and a whisk. The thing is, add confectioners' sugar in small portions while whipping the butter. Mix in strawberry puree at the end because the puree may harden the frosting if it was stored in the refrigerator. Didn't even bother to simmer down the strawberry puree and the consistency turned out pretty good. In addition, if you don't like the texture of strawberry seeds, use cheesecloth to get smooth texture of your puree.

Amazing recipe. I just mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and added cool whip to make the rite texture. I added this frosting to a chocolate cake and every one I shared it with commented on how the cake was so good they didn't want to stop eating it. Not to brag but it was the best cake I've ever tasted! I think I might even enter a cake at my local county fair using this frosting...

Love this recipe, Candice but I have yet to make it with strawberries. I have tried it with strained raspberries (strained out some of the seeds), oranges, Saskatoon berries-all delicious. I also dislike the flavour of imitation strawberry, in all products and this is the perfect way to get a good flavour for frostings. I have adjusted the icing sugar and add it slowly to accomodate the level of liquid left in the fruit. I cannot decorate a cake to save my life, but with this recipe, who needs to? I can finally enjoy a pretty cake and eat it too. Let them eat Cake!!!!!

Wow an incredible strawberry taste and delicious frosting! I won't ever lose this recipe. I'm thinking maybe some other fruit may work too in the same way...with the cooking down puree principle.   Thank-you Candice.

I made this icing to frost my mother's vanilla birthday cake.  In the words of my father, "the cake was good...but the icing was spectacular".  6 of us nearly polished off a whole cake in one sitting because it was that tasty (we are typically not dessert people) and my mother and sister both wanted the recipe. I used 3/4 c of light butter and 1/4 c of shortening (because that is what I had).  I did have to use a little more icing sugar than called for to firm the icing (but I used closer to 1 and 1/2 c. of stawberries), but the flavour was amazing! The batch I made created enough icing to put a layer of frosting between two round cakes and enough to generously frost the cake--I even had enough frosting left to pipe some decoration on the cake.  Thank you for an amazing icing recipe!  I will be using this again and again.

I used Smart Balance and the frosting separated a little. I also used frozen strawberries and maybe that had to do with the separation. Other than that this frosting has the most delicious flavor!!! I frosted chocolate cupcakes with it and can hardly keep myself from eating the extra frosting!

Seemed too buttery to me. I was surprised to see the recipe called for a whole cup of butter.  That seemed like a lot compared to other butter cream recipes I've made. And in the end it tasted too buttery. I had to add some milk and more sugar to tone it down a bit.

I made it but did not like that butter was the predominant taste and made the frosting dense.  Great idea to use real strawberries, though. The next day I halved it (putting the other half in the freezer for another time), added more strawberry puree and confectioners sugar (less than 2 cups), and a bit of vanilla in a spoonful of water, then beat it a long time in the mixer. Much fluffier and better tasting!

My family really enjoyed this frosting on a vanilla cake. Thank you for sharing. I did make two changes. First, I put the strawberry pur√©e through a fine mesh strainer. That took care of the seeds. Secondly, we really like cream cheese in our frosting so I substituted 8oz of softened cream cheese for the butter. Yum!  I would recommend reducing the strawberries until super thick on a lower temp so it turns out thick and creamy. We will have this one again :o)

Loved the strawberry puree. I doubled the amount of puree so we had a really lovely strawberry flavor; and we nearly halved the sugar. Next we are going to use the puree for ice cream. What I really like is the color is from nature.

WOW!  This frosting is wonderful!!  We recently ate a cupcake at Georgetown Cupcake (it was $2.75 for one cupcake!!!) and I had to replicate because my son liked it so much.  This frosting is better than GC.  I made the strawberry cupcakes by the same chef and also amazing.  I love how the seeds add a mix of color to the frosting. I have a Breville Blender which is a fantastic blender and it really made the puree great.  The only thing I had to do was add some water to the strawberries as my blender wouldn't blend them just cut up but once I reduced the puree that got rid of the excess water.  YUM YUM! Thank you!!!!

This was a really great find for me. My husband keeps going into the fridge and randomly scooping spoonfuls of the leftovers out. He hates frosting. But yet, he keeps doing this. That tells you how good it is. I didn't have 1 cup of butter, so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. Didn't use as much sugar as is called for, but close - probably 1/2 cup shy. I strained the seeds out of the puree before adding it to the mix. Amazing how good this turned out!

AMAZING!  Worth the effort for sure!  I made it exactly as written (though I will reduce the time on boiling the strawberry puree .. I started with a full cup of puree, but ended with only 4 tablespoons of reduction!).  The taste, however, was fabulous.  I shared cupcakes with 12 different people, and every single one commented on the frosting being incredible!  So very happy!!

I strained the seeds and, as the cook's note mentions, let it reduce a bit longer.  Fantastic flavor.  This would be great in a cream cheese frosting, too, and I'll definitely try that sometime.  I don't care for artificial strawberry flavor, and now I never have to worry about that again.  I can't wait to make this with other fruits, too.  What a great idea!  Thank you, Candice!!

Oh, Candace, this frosting is really a treat!. For her birthday cake Hailie wanted "a vanilla cake with pink frosting and blue writing" so I decided rather than just making the frosting pink, I would make it delicious as well and this was the perfect answer. I can't wait to try it on a lemon cake - I think the combination will be wonderful. Thank you for perfecting this recipe and for sharing it.

I made the frosting as directed. The main problem was that it was too thin and too sweet for me. Several other reviews suggested reducing the butter, so I may try that next time. I definitely would not use more confectioners sugar. I would add more strawberries or some strawberry extract as well for preference.

Update: I made the frosting again with a couple of modifications. I allowed the puree to cool for hours. I also substituted 8 oz of cream cheese for one stick of butter. I added strawberry extract for personal preference, for frosting the lemon cake with lemon curd filling.

I used it as a filling in a Neapolitan cake for my husband's 30th Birthday and everybody loved it! really brought out the fresh strawberry flavour, will definitely be using this recipe again. I did reduce the puree for longer to make sure the flavour would shine through as I was using strawberries out of season and it worked. thank you.

Absolutely delicious! Surprised by the amazing strawberry taste! I pur√©ed 2 cups of strawberries and reduced for about 25-30mins so my pur√©e was super concentrated. DEF will use this recipe again :)

Easy, delicious and fresh tasting!  I made an entire batch and it frosted about 12 cupcakes.  I did use a large, round tip and piped them 'bakery style' so there was lots of frosting on each cupcake. These were for my 2 year old's birthday and she can be picky about textures so after reducing, I pushed the puree through a cheesecloth to remove the seeds.  Other than adding a pinch of salt no other changes.  I kind of like the idea of using half cream cheese and half butter... maybe next time!

I made this frosting today and read the review saying it was granie from the seeds.So after I blended the strawberries I put it through a strainer to remove all the seeds. This made for a creamy frosting and so good! I had leftover cake batter so I made cupcakes and infused the strawberry frosting in the middle and cream cheese frosting on the top,yummy.

Loved the flavor of this. When I made it, I added the strawberries straight from the pan while they were still hot. This made it very liquidy. I put it in the refrigerator for an hour and it turned out fine. Next time, I think I will try a different fruit.

I made a few alterations and it came out delicious!!!. I doubled the amount of strawberries, passed thru a fine mesh to remove seeds and added the powdered sugar in increments as described but ended up adding less than what recipe called for. At last minute I put in some mashed strawberries also.

I used this on a very dense white cake. It turned out very tasty. As I was frosting the cake I spied some rose syrup in my kitchen and though I'd add it to the leftover frosting (there was a lot leftover even after I reduced the recipe) and make a design. I also added some red food dye to really make the design stick out on top of the now pink cake. It made the frosting a little runny so I used some corn starch to thicken it up instead of more confectioner's sugar because I didn't want it to get too sweet. All together very good. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW  they are so good. I usually don‚Äôt like frosting but I can eat this with a spoon. I can taste the fresh strawberry.  I made half recipe to frosh 12 vanilla cupcakes.  This is so easy to make. I followed the exact recipe, no need to change anything, this is PERFECT. Thanks Candice for the recipe.

It has good potential but way to much butter as is.  Next time I will increase strawberry pur√©e to 1 1/2 C, cut the butter by half, add 2-3 more cups confectioners sugar and milk until I reach desired consistency.

Perfect! If you prefer, you can also substitute part of the butter with cream cheese. This was ok for decorating, but not perfect (and I don't know what I'm doing as far as cake decorating anyway), but I probably could've added more powdered sugar to fix it. Everyone's strawberries, puree and reduction will be slightly different as far as water content, so you'll have to use your own judgment at the end. Delicious!!!!!

I just made this frosting on yesterday, and I loooved it! I read somewhere on here that some people thought the frosting was too grainy. Originally I thought the same thing, but I put my cupcakes in the fridge overnight, and the next day they were delicious!

This frosting was the perfect compliment to the chocolate I made from scratch. The frosting was very fluffy and strawberry-licious!
I think two cups of confessioner's sugar would have been sweet enough.
A+ to the recipe maker for including only natural and easy to pronounce ingredients :-)

My son wanted strawberry frosting on chocolate cupcakes for his 5th birthday.  I didn't want something from a can, so Mr. Google led me to this recipe and I'm so glad he did!  I read all the reviews and suggestions.  Decided to strain the seeds (since I was making this for little kids) and continued pureeing strawberries until I ended up with a full cup of puree. I reduced it extra long making sure I'd have enough tablespoons at the end.  I then followed the recipe as written except I didn't do step #7.  I had enough frosting for the cupcakes and the sweetness was perfect, so I left out the extra half cup of confectioners sugar.  My friends and DH who aren't big fans of strawberry frosting loved this flavor...and my 5 year old said it was delicious!  Thank you!  Now...do you have an equally good recipe for a chocolate version? ;)

This recipe is amazing.  The strawberry flavor really shines through, and my 6-year old daughter said the color was 'just perfect' so it passed the 'perfect pink' test.  It's definitely worth the effort to make the strawberry reduction.  I let it simmer while I was making the cupcakes, so it really didn't take any extra time.  And I like that there were little flecks of seeds throughout the icing. It made it obvious that the icing was really made from strawberries.  I did add just a touch of milk to thin out the icing for piping, as it was quite thick. Could be that I cooked down the strawberries more than the original recipe called for.

I loved the taste of this frosting! It was buttery but with a potent strawberry flavor and turned out a light pink color. Everyone loved how it tasted. I only gave it 4 stars because the frosting deflated on the cupcake almost instantly and after only 40min. at room temperature they were just shapeless mounds of frosting...still tasted delicious but I wanted to use this recipe for a wedding and there is no chance the frosting will withstand outdoor heat.

I've used this recipe twice. The first time I made it I used strawberries and the second time I used blackberries. I LOVED both of them. This recipe worked great. The only change I made with the confectioner's sugar at the end of the recipe (when you start adding the reduction). I use a lot less sugar than what the recipe called for. I started off with just adding a 1/2 cup and then added more bit by bit as I added the fruit (just enough to keep the frosting from getting too liquid). 

My friends loved the cupcakes and thought that using real fruit made it that much better!

This was fabulous...especially on my chocolate pound cake.  Like others I did add a pinch of salt and some strawberry extract.  It was so good I actually saved the extra frosting, placed it in the freezer and ate it later on a spoon!!  Thank you for the recipe..this is THE one if you want a strawberry frosting that is real.

This recipe was awesome! You could definitely taste the strawberries, and it tasted super fresh.  I thought it was a tad sweet, so I added about 3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream at the end.  I beat it on high for about a minute, and it tasted perfect! Definitely a keeper :)

This makes a not overly sweet, very strawberry tasting frosting that is amazing!  I made a few changes when I made it.  I used 1 cup butter + 1/2 cup crisco (didn't have any more butter), about 2 tsp of vanilla sugar, and 2 pounds of sifted powdered sugar.  I reduced about 2 1/2 - 3 cups of frozen sliced strawberries (my own) more than half and ended up with about 1+ cups of puree that I made with an immersion blender.  I made a 13x9 cake that was a hot milk sponge cake on the bottom layer (it's not overly sweet and is light and moist, but still holds up to layering), the egg free nut free dairy free  chocolate cake somewhere on here for the top layer (it's the best chocolate cake you'll ever make, really!) and filled and frosted with this strawberry frosting to make it like a neopolitan cake.  Everyone loved it and it looked amazing once I drizzled it with melted chocolate and some sprinkles for fun.  This is the best strawberry frosting, hands down, because it's simple, uses basic ingredients, and actually tastes like strawberries!

Fantastic!  My daughter is obsessed with strawberries, so I knew this would be perfect for her 3rd birthday party.  I had no trouble at all with the texture, it was very creamy and light and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make this again!  It's natural and that's always a plus in my book ; )

Muy bien, but a little too buttery for our tastes. I also noticed several comments complaining about the seedy texture, but I didn't find that a problem. The seeds were barely noticeable, so unless serving to picky children there is no need to strain the reduction.

Needed to have added more powdered sugar than was listed in recipe. It was too runny and my second layer slid off because of it. A quick move to the fridge helped to keep it in place. Otherwise it was so delicious. I will make it again but add more powdered sugar.

This tasted great, and I loved using real strawberries; I followed others' recommendation to use 1 1/2 cups of berries, and not adding the final 1/2 cup of sugar.  But I could not make this frosting look good on cupcakes -- perhaps due to the modifications?  I tried two different decorating bag tips without success: the frosting looked like ground hamburger (or as my kid put it, brains) - nowhere close to the main picture accompanying the recipe.  I ended up applying it with a knife, but it still looked far from ideal, especially compared to the other frosting I made, a chocolate ganache.  This frosting was terrific between chocolate cake layers; I would likely make this again for that purpose.  But I definitely would not use it to frost the top of any cake or cupcake.

I like the idea of a fresh strawberry pur√©e cooked down for intense strawberry flavor. I followed others advice and did not measure the one cup of strawberries to start. I pur√©ed enough strawberries so that I could strain the seeds out and the result would be one cup of seedless strawberry pur√©e.  I cooked it down for 20 minutes and did not have enough tablespoons for the recipe, but used what I did have. In the future, I would increase the seedless pur√©e to 1 1/2 cups and cook that down at a lower heat for 20 minutes as I would have liked it even more intense. I would also whip it longer. I added a little cream to make it not so dense. Overall, it was pretty and tasted good.

I tried this recipe for cupcakes for school and its very good! The strawberry flavor is so real and satisfying,  you NEED to try it. My only suggestion is that after your done mixing everything it became quite runny, so I added about another 1\3 cup of sugar and it was the perfect consistency! I hope I was able to help! Great job Candace! Soooooooooo good!

Far too sweet for me but the strawberry flavour was really quite good! Maybe try with cream cheese instead of butter or in a meringue frosting somehow. Won't make this exact recipe again but will use the strawberry technique in other recipes. I also strained the strawberries once cooled to make the buttercream smoother.

I did exactly what the recipe said and adding heavy whipping cream makes it a little lighter. It was delicious!

I really loved the idea of this frosting, but it just didn't come together for me. I followed the suggestion of others and strained the reduced puree a bit to remove the majority of the seeds. Other than than, I followed the recipe exactly. What I was left with was frosting that was FAR too thin and FAR too sweet. I couldn't bring myself to add more icing sugar to it, as it was already almost inedibly sweet. So, to thicken my only option was to add cornstarch. The cornstarch did the trick, but the frosting was still muuuuuch too sweet for my tastes.

I've tried this with fresh strawberries as well as a frozen mixed berry combo I bought at Costco. They were both good but awfully sweet. I used about 1-1/2 cups of berries for a deeper flavor, hoping to let more berry flavor shine through instead of the sweet. I think next time I will reduce the sugar. Loved the idea of using berries! The color was absolutely awesome too!

Tasted great, but I do have to say that it was a little too sweet for me. And that's saying something! I have a major sweet tooth and this was a little past my limit. But it did have an excellent flavor. Another dislike was how runny it was. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very runny. I don't think I will be trying this again.

AMAZING!!! I was commissioned to make 8 dozen cupcakes for a tea luncheon at church. I was making a few different kinds of cupcakes and was looking for something fresh, and boy this was it! Everyone loved the frosting. I had some leftover which i just put in the fridge. My husband's cousin came over and was eating it by the spoonful. Tastes as good as ice cream!

Really tasty! This frosting had a great consistency and flavor. I did add in 1 tbsp of strawberry preserves from Trader Joe's to really make the strawberry flavor pop. I used it to Friday the one bowl chocolate cake recipe that I made for my daughter's 5th birthday. It was awesome and the amount for frosting two 9" cakes was perfect.

Oh yeah THIS IS THEE ONE! I could've just got a spoon and went to town! Lol! Minor things I did differently: one user said to strain the pur√©e to take the seeds out -check! Another user said to use 1/8 t of almond extract ( in addition to the vanilla) - check! Another user said 10 minutes is all you need to cook the pur√©e- check!  And I say to use one and a half sticks of butter and  a half a block of Crisco butter flavored shortening - double check! Throw in a pinch of salt and.......FABULOUS!!!!!!!

This frosting has incredible flavor!  I did not find it overly sweet at all, in fact it had a very faint (and perfect) tartness from the fresh berries!  My strawberry sauce was reduced by half at around the 10 minute mark, so please be sure to watch it closely.  I generously frosted 24 cupcakes and had a little bit left to spare.  Thanks so much for such a lovely recipe, Candice!

This was super easy AND delicious!!  I just let the strawberries reduce while I prepared and baked the cakes and by the time they were almost done the berry mixture was ready.  Tastes like a super sweet, fresh strawberry.  It was a simple, yet genius idea to reduce the juice off of the strawberries.  Could see it possibly breaking on someone, so definitely important to add it in the increments described (dry/wet/dry/wet/dry).

12 5 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/220816/real-strawberry-frosting/ ... Yummy, but thin so I added an 8oz block cream cheese = strawberry ice cream flavored frosting!  :)  'Still a little syrupy so folded in two cups whipped cream (1c before whipping).  Less strawberry flavor, of course, but it kept its shape well enough to frost cupcakes.  I don't know that there is a "problem" with this recipe, but maybe less butter would help the lack of firmness - & not add cream cheese or whipped cream.  BONUS:  http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/63277383/strawberry-dream-cake/ ... Celeste's! ... Note4Me:  Less sugar.  Subbing cream cheese for half butter is good.ME:1/2c butter,8oz creamcheese,1/2t vani,1#confec.1/8t salt,alittle less than half c puree. Like straw icecream a la frosting. Yum, but kind of srupy.A nonsugar thickener or just have to keep it refrigerated.  For nonsugar,maybe 2c berries pureed, add 1c confec.  Allow to "juice" fifteen minutestohalfanhour.Reheat & thicken w 1T cornstarch Cool.Cream together butter&cc.Add 2Turee&1/2tvan then alt equaling 1#sugar.

This is a very good frosting and very easy to work with.  I must of cooked my strawberries to long I did not have enough to add all the Tablespoons they said to add but I did start with a little over a cup of strawberries.  Since I was short on the strawberries I added 1/2 teaspoon strawberry extract.  It is a beautiful pink - I had enough to frost 27 cupcakes and a little left over.  I will make this again.

This recipe by itself is AMAZING!!! I am a fan of ALL NATURAL and Organic so, I've used it numerous times as my GO TO for Strawberry Frosting!!! 

*** After repeated attempts using Organic products and Real Butter, I notice the butter ratio being to high (that's a good thing!) and only used about 3/4 or, less of what the recipe called for so, add slowly! The last few times I've made it, I replaced half of the butter (1/2 c of each) with cream cheese and it was AMAZING!!! It still kept that fluffy texture and piped beautifully!!!

Great strawberry flavor!  I used this as cake filling and for decorating a strawberry cake.  Followed directions except for a couple changes. Used 20 oz. frozen strawberries thawed overnight in a strainer over a bowl. Squeezed out 1 1/4C of juice reduced down to 1/4C in the microwave using a 2C Pyrex sprayed with Pam for 8-10 mins.  Pureed what was left of the strawberries and then added the cooled reduced juice.  Used less vanilla (3/4 tsp) because I wanted the strawberry taste to really stand out and it did.  Got rave reviews from friends.

Great.  Used a lot less sugar because I got tired of sifting!  Also used frozen strawberries.  It took an entire bag of TJ's organic frozen strawberries.

I doubled for 36 high-top cupcakes. I used 1 cup sugar to each stick if butter, and had to whip in some heavy cream because it was pretty stiff. Wonderful texture and strong strawberry taste. Excellent recipe!!!!

This was worth all the work!  I have always preferred making things from scratch as opposed to buying premade. Now I have the perfect recipe for strawberry frosting that is as real as it gets, no jars of frosting.

Followed recipe exactly and ended up with a perfectly yummy strawberry buttercream recipe! I had to double it to frost 24 cupcakes butI I was generous on the frosting. This one is a keeper! Thank you!!

This is truly delicious frosting. Definitely worth the effort of reducing the strawberries. So glad I found this! I imagine this recipe would work well with other fruits as well.

This was good but it wasn't fantastic. I think it needs at least double the strawberries called for in the recipe to make the flavor come through more. It was a nice consistency frosting though. Not sure I'll make it again. I made the cake as well and I didn't like the freeze-dried aftertaste.

PERFECT!  I followed the recipe exactly but I was tempted to use strawberry flavoring for the vanilla extract.  I'm glad I didn't as it would have been too strong a flavor for me.  Made as written, this recipe is PERFECT.  It goes so well with the "REALLY real Strawberry Cupcakes" from this site which is another of Candice's prize recipes.  Thank you Candice for sharing your PERFECT recipe!  We really enjoyed it!

My strawberries burned... :( The second batch turned out pretty good, but I thought the strawberry flavor wasn't intense enough - and it was very, very sweet! Too sweet. I put the puree through a mesh strainer to get rid of any seeds.

I wanted to use up some old strawberries instead of throwing them out and had a white cake mix on hand. I only had margarine instead of butter, and I have no mixer of any kind, but adding more sugar and stirring my butt off made a wonderful frosting! I will try again using real butter, but love the strawberry flavor.

Wow! This is really good! I got so many compliments on this! :) Just the perfect thickness, and it tastes so fresh and amazing. I don't bother with cooking my strawberries, so if you are short on time, you don't have to; it's still delicious. :)

I really gambled on this recipe because I made it the day of my 1 year old's birthday party which had 40 guests. This was by far THE best cupcake I've ever tried let alone MADE! it was so yummy and creamy, I can't wait to make these during strawberry season! I wouldn't use frozen strawberries, fresh is key in this!

Its well worth the time and ingredients.  I added icing sugar until I was comfortable with the sweetness and may have cut back about 1/2 cup. Brought my mini cupcakes to work and my co-workers raved and everyone who was offered, accepted seconds.  ejb

This was amazing!  I was *so* tempted to add strawberry extract, but my husband deterred me by stating the obvious: why would you use artificial flavoring when you went to the trouble of making real strawberry syrup?  Too true.  In all I used a little over a cup of puree (measured after pureeing), stuck with vanilla extract, and paired this with a white chocolate cake. This was incredibly flavorful and beautiful on my cake.  One batch was just enough to smoothly frost an 9x13 cake with a modestly piped border along the outside.  I found my frosting was too thin to do any fancy decorating, but it didn't matter because the flavor was out of this world.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add a pinch of salt.  Fantastic recipe!!

Tried this recipe last night and it was fantastic! I didn't blend the strawberries or cook them though. I chopped them and blended for 2 seconds, I wanted real strawberry pieces in the frosting. It turned out great. I also love that you don't need milk or cream for this frosting because milk doesn't always agree with me.

This is an excellent recipe. I did use more strawberry. Also, I'm not sure what this is really supposed to yield. I made the frosting for 24 cupcakes and had A LOT left over. I will probably cut the recipe in half next time.

My husband requested strawberry cake with strawberry frosting for his birthday, so I tried this.  I used frozen strawberries with sugar as I needed 1/2 a container for the cake.  I did strain the puree, as I always do when I make puree.  Frosting was delicious, but the strawberry cake, frosting, and filling all together were a little sweet, even for our family of sweet toothes!  But I think this with Strawberry Cake Filling would be awesome on a devils food cake.  Will definitely do it again.

Super easy and yummy too!! Instead of strawberries, I used blueberries (which were on sale at the time, lol) and this frosting turned out beautifully!! I have never made my own frosting before and this was not only easy, but got rave reviews from the rest of the family!  I will definitely make this again!!  (Put on top of "Honey Cupcakes with strawberries" recipe by MICHELLE0011 substituting this frosting for the one in their recipe.)

This frosting was very good.  The only change I did was not add it in 2 tablespoons at a time.  As some reviewers said, it didn't look like enough.  I just added it all in at once and it was perfectly fine.  If you think it's not enough, don't even worry about it.  I also substituted the vanilla for almond extract.  I'll definitely make this again.  Everyone loved it.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I hate artificial strawberry flavor and wanted something without it... Thats how I landed on this recipe. One tip I've figured out is to make it a few days prior to using it, as the strawberries become even sweeter and more flavorful when they sit in the fridge all mixed up. Just dont forget if you do this, you will need to bring it out to room temperature before frosting with it.

As is, this frosting was WAY too runny.  I added an extra cup of confectioner's sugar, and when that didn't work I also added a pack of softened cream cheese.  That was what finally made the frosting pipable.  Tasted good, but can't give it 5 stars because I needed to modify it.

Puts artificially flavored strawberry frosting to shame! So fresh tasting! Good with chocolate or lemon cupcakes. Don‚Äôt miss cook‚Äôs note that the longer you reduce pur√©e the more intense the strawberry flavor will be. Definitely worth the extra time for that flavor punch!

This was super-fantastic!  I, too, used more strawberries than just the 1 C.  And I added 1/2 tsp of strawberry extract.  It made more than enough for a 2-layer 8‚Äù cake.  And it was delicious!

I picked this recipe as my 3 yr-old grandson wanted pink icing and I didn't want to use red food color. I loved the fresh strawberry flavor of this icing. I did start out with 2 cups chopped strawberries. After puree step I had 1 cup. I cooked the puree about 20 minutes, strained it in and sieve, and ended up with slightly over 1/2 cup puree. Although the recipe asked for about 6 Tb. puree, I ended up using almost all the puree. I only added 3 cups total confectioner's sugar.  It was really really good.

I was really hoping this would be full of strawberry flavor and i was sadly disappointed. Although the frosting was smooth, light and fluffy it lacked any flavor other than butter. I reduced the strawberries and allowed them to cool after straining the seeds out. I follwed the recipe exactly this time around. I do plan on giving it another go, next time increasing the amount of strawberries, and possibly adding some dried strawberries to really give it more flavor.

First time ever doing frosting, I added another 1/2cup of strawberry pure to make the strawberry flavor bolder, maybe next time I will go lighter on the sugar since it was too sweet for me, but that‚Äôs just a personal preference.

I made this and followed the instructions. I maybe had slightly more than 1 cup of strawberries to start, but otherwise didn't change a thing. I didn't strain the seeds out or anything. We loved it! We used it to top vanilla cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious. Followed recipe as is, no substitutions. Piped some in between layers and iced around the sides and top; the rest is setting up in the fridge for a bit so I can pipe on some flowers. Fluffy, not too sweet, and although it does have a few strawberry seeds in it, that, to me, just gives it authenticity. You can always strain them out as other reviewers have suggested. I have been cooking and cleaning all day, so I didn't bother!

Amazing and easy! I used frozen strawberries because I live somewhere where there's only hard strawberries. I blended them in the blender with a little water and followed recipe.  Make sure you end up with exactly 1/2 cup of strawberry puree. This frosting is slightly soft but the consistency is well enough. It really has a very strong strawberry taste which I love. It makes a big amount though, more than I needed.

Best frosting I've ever made. I did increase the amount of the strawberry puree because I wanted it to be REALLY strawberry. Also added a touch of almond extract which helped enhance the strawberry flavor. As for it being too sweet, something I've learned over the years is to add just a touch of salt to buttercream frostings to cut the sweetness and balance flavors. It turned out perfectly.

Ooooooh my gosh, this recipe was sooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!  There are some people who have been critical of this recipe and critical of the texture and the flavor, but I could not have asked for a better strawberry frosting recipe. It was so delectable and sweet and yummy and I even dreamt about it's amazingness last night.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!

I made the recipe for 65 cupcakes.  I made three different kinds including strawberries, blackberries, and lemon for a fairy birthday party!  Wow the frosting was a hit.  The parents told me they had three cupcakes so they could try all three frosting flavors!  The 8 year old like the lemon the best.  I like the strawberry the best!

For the Lemon Icing:
I did more of a citrus blend of 2/3 orange juice and 1/3 lemon juice.  I made sure there was pulp in the reduction and then strained it all out before it cooled.

For the Berry Icing:
I did reduce down until quite thick and then strained out the seeds.  I recommend straining the seeds, otherwise the texture is not so great!

Was worth the effort. I don‚Äôt care for the flavor of strawberry extract. This was REAL strawberry flavor. I did add a few drops of red food coloring to enhance the color. Kids and adults loved it. My granddaughter wanted chocolate cupcakes with strawberry icing. I served the left over sauce with ice cream ... and the cupcakes, of course!

I will definitely make this again (maybe strain the seeds next time - even though the little ones didn‚Äôt complain). Only made a half batch because I paired it with an orange -chocolate frosting for an alternating chocolate/vanilla confetti layer mini cake. STRAWBerry frosting between the layers and then both on the outside, opposite ends, blending around the center line halfway up the side. My 6 year old helped and it came out better than us novices could have hoped. Thanks for sharing it!

Excellent recipe.  Of course I made adaptations.  Took an extra 10 min to strain the seeds out.  The flavor is amazing.  Added a little HWC to make it smoother as well.

This tasted very fruity but it was hard to pick out strawberry as the flavor specifically. I added about 3/4 ounce of ground freeze dried strawberries and that really made the flavor more distinguished.

This recipe was way too sweet. I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and it still overpowered the strawberry taste. It wasn't terrible, good place to start, will make some changes next time.

Came out beautifully! I ended up doubling the recipe and used all of a 32oz bag of confectioners sugar, 8 tbps of the reduced strawberry pur√©e, added some almond extract. I thinned the frosting out with some whole milk and whipping cream. Key is to have ALL your ingredients room temperature and your buttercream will come out smooth! :) Beautiful pink color with absolutely no food coloring. Great recipe!!

I have to rate it a 4 because I did modify it a bit, but it's AMAZING!!! I'm so happy I found the recipe on a whim and decided to try it. I am not a huge fan of strawberry frosting, but I made lemon cupcakes and it went perfect with them. I used 1 2/3 cup sugar vs. the 2 1/2. It doesn't need any additional sugar in our opinions. I also didn't puree the fruit when it was done-I just used a potato masher in the pan while cooking the berries. :D

I adhered mostly to the recipe. The only thing I did differently, was that I added 1/4 cup blueberries to the strawberry puree. This frosting was delicious and went great with the strawberry cupcake recipe from Candace Nelson (https://www.marthastewart.com/258957/sprinkles-strawberry-cupcakes)

I wish I would have seen this recipe sooner! I got a recipe for strawberry cake and frosting. The cake came out good but the frosting for the recipe was awful! I did a quick google search and came upon this one. I almost didn‚Äôt make it since you have to reduce the pur√©e and I wanted to whip something up quick. I‚Äôm glad I decided to go ahead and make this one. It is so creamy and delicious! It melts in your mouth! I don‚Äôt like strawberry but this frosting is making me re-think it! I can‚Äôt wait until I take it to work tomorrow for my coworker‚Äôs birthday! This is now a go to for frosting. Now I just need to see if I can swap the butter out for coconut oil for my daughter who has a milk allergy.

This was really good. I didn‚Äôt measure my strawberries as well I should so ended up needing adding more butter to thicken it and let it beat on low for a good five minutes. Turned out light and fluffy and delicious! It‚Äôs definitely a sweet frosting. Could add cream cheese to tone it down.

This was delicious! I would definitely make it again. I made SCOTTOSMAN ‚ÄúSimple White Cake‚Äù with it and everyone loved it! The only changes I did was pur√©ed the whole container of strawberries and added a tablespoon of vanilla extract instead of a tsp. I also did not need the extra 1/2 cup of sugar because it was already sweet enough. Thank you for this simple recipe .

Figured it out.  We used too much pur√©e.  We sifted the sugar and we did not notice seeds in our pur√©e.  The flavor awesome, added a pinch of salt, used real butter, trying to rescue by slightly freezing our frosted but gorgeous cake even though it is not beautiful puffy like those cupcakes!

Loved the strawberry flavor! Reduced the pur√©e by more than half then strained it to get the seeds out. Used equal parts butter and cream cheese instead of all butter. Will definitely be making this again!

This makes an excellent frosting.  If you have a vitamix - the seeds are completely pureed, and the frosting is completely smooth.  I added a small amount (1 tsp?) of honey to the berries when I boiled them, and it made a very thick, pungent berry sauce.

All in all- an outstanding recipe.

I really wanted to like it but the strawberry didn't shine through and it was just sweet. Followed directions except I added about another cup of the strawberry puree. Used the same amount of sugar. If I had enough time I would definitely make a different icing. Would not use again.

This is a great strawberry recipe. It tastes like strawberry ice cream! It also has a beautiful pink color without any added dyes. I wish I had known about it when one of my daughters wanted pink everything. I think I used about 3 C sugar in all (not precisely measured, rather, to taste.) I am interested to try this again with half cream cheese instead of all butter.  Delicious!

DELICIOUS!!!  Following the advice of others, I used 1-1/2 cups of strawberries.  Instead of vanilla, I used 2 teaspoons of strawberry extract.   This not only looks gorgeous, it tastes as good as it looks.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I was looking for real strawberry flavor without too much fuss and this came out beautifully. I was cooking in winter so I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh and they worked very well. I also pushed the reduced pur√©e through a strainer to get out the seeds. Lovely color and flavor.

Yuck. I followed the recipe exactly, and like other negative reviewers said, it just tastes like butter. Next time I'll try half shortening half butter and see if that doesn't help.

WAY too much butter. Half the butter. Or use 1/4 cup - that's all I could taste. Frosting doesn't need that much butter.

I made this amazing icing. Although I went off the recipe with the 1 cup of strawberries and thank gosh I had more you should really do 2-3 pints. The recipe calls for multiple tablespoons of strawberry, well I was only able to make 1 1/2 tablespoon f strawberry pur√©e reduction. Other than that I would highly recommend this icing!

I made this yesterday to top chocolate cupcakes for my neighbor's birthday.  It is DELICIOUS!   I used 2 cups of fresh strawberries for a more intense flavor so I had to add a little more conf. sugar than the recipe calls for.  This is just the recipe I have been looking for for a long time!

After I made this recipe and tasted it, I was concerned it may be too sweet. I let it sit in the fridge overnight (as recommended by other reviewers here) and iced a butter golden cake with it for my sons birthday. It was actually AMAZING. Everyone loved it, and it wasn't too sweet with the golden cake. I will definitely use this recipe the next time I make strawberry icing. I did add a bit of salt to the icing since I used unsalted butter.

I made it exactly as-is, and it was excellent with a chocolate cake, for a 4-year-old's birthday party. Not the most sophisticated combo, but it's what he wanted and it worked.

For those complaining of not enough strawberry taste, or overwhelming butter taste, look at your ingredients. They matter so much!

I used tiny organic strawberries - not the big, tasteless ones from the supermarket. They were just past ripe - perfect for pureeing and using as a flavor. And the butter was fresh cabot butter.

I didn't add/change a thing,  (vanilla would have overpowered the berries), and it was perfect. It also didn't separate the way some people's did, even after sitting in the fridge for 24 hours. I wonder if they cooked their puree long enough? I was tempted to cut the time short because it cooked down so much, but if it's too liquid then of course it's going to affect the buttercream holding together.

One note: I used this for a standard double round (9 inches diameter), and it was JUST enough. I would probably increase it a bit next time, because I like to have extra in case something goes wrong.

I used this idea but deviated from the buttercream recipe. I made a traditional swiss buttercream.  It turned out excellently.  I have never been a fan of powdered sugar buttercreams but I've always wanted a stronger strawberry flavor than I get with  strawberry preserves.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a bit of strawberry extract. I bought really  good all natural frontier alcohol free.  I will certainly make this again.

Turned out perfectly. I am an amateur, so I had trouble with some of the directions, but that's because I'm clumsy in both a physical and mental manner- haha. The end result exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with the outcome. Thank you so much!!

Way too buttery, and not enough strawberry flavor. Since it's only butter, strawberry and sugar, it tastes like you buttered a cake. It needs something to cut the butter - milk, cream cheese. Something. Plus, the recipe called for regular butter (rather than unsalted) so the salt/sweet/tart balance of flavor was hard to get, even though I made modifications after I tasted the recipe and didn't like the taste.

I would definitely make this again! I used this on a 2 layer vanilla cake and its a perfect compliment.  The one thing I didn't like was the amount of time it takes to make, with the whole puree and reduction of the strawberries. I did love that it used fresh strawberries though!

I really loved this recipe! I tend to stay away from Strawberry flavoured stuff because I hate the artificial flavour-but there is nothing artificial about the flavour here! Delicious! Tip: You might need to add a bit of milk to thin it out if you are piping it with a piping bag. Will definitely make again. Used it on top of banana chocolate chip cupcakes & chocolate cupcakes: both were delicious!

Did not make any changes to the recipe. The frosting is so pretty and delicious. The only thing I would mention is that my strawberries reduced a lot, so I started with about 2 cups of berries to get the necessary amount of reduced puree. I made this with simple white cake from this website, because my kid wanted something plain. I personally would have done a lemon cake though--that would be fantastic. Next time!

The first time I made this icing was to decorate some cupcakes for my boyfriend's mother for mother's day.  I use this recipe whenever I want to impress someone!  I've used many different berries and combinations of them.  Now I skip the blender part and just muddle the berries after they've boiled down, the small chunks that marble the icing are a bit more rustic and so pretty.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I loved this frosting. I don't like the store bought because of all the processing and added ingredients. This frosting has a nice strawberry flavor and was easy to frost with.  I will definitely be using this again!

Way too buttery! Kinda of disappointed with this one. Not too sure what else could have been changed to make it taste more like actual frosting.

This is EXCELLENT!  I read other  reviews and made the following modifications:  1.  Someone complained of the graininess, so I strained the puree before boiling to remove most of the seeds; 2.  Used strawberry extract instead of vanilla and added 1 tsp of almond extract (as suggested by another user) which really does help the flavor pop - next time I'll use vanilla instead of strawberry - the puree is POWERFUL 3.  for the last addition of sugar, I tasted before adding and then just added enough to my taste for sweetness.   Some reviewers have complained about separation and runniness...I put that down to technique.  If the buttercream (and you MUST use real butter) is runny or separates, you've let the butter get too soft or too warm (or the puree wasn't COMPLETELY cooled (transfer it to a different container and give it a good hour or so to cool) - it happens sometimes with buttercreams.  This is definitely not the fault of the recipe.

Really good and sweet. Easy to mix. I didn't reduce the entire 20 minutes, maybe about 10 minutes, and it still turned out very good.

I made this for my daughter who doesnt like frosting much, but loves berries.  I think it will still be a bit too sweet, but I love it.  I also made a blueberry version and it is equally as good.   I will definitely make this again.

Made this frosting for my daughter's birthday cupcakes.  The taste was fantastic and the consistency held up well.  Creamy and rich without being overpowering.  A big hit with the 6 year old crowd.

Someone complained about the finished product being kind of grainy due to seeds and such in the strawberries, so I pureed them for a bit longer and poured the puree through a sieve before cooking it. That held back most of the seeds, but also most of the fiber, so I had to add sugar to get the stiffness I wanted for piping. The flavor is wonderful!! I'd definitely make this again.

Cut the recipe in half to fill macarons. I used heaping tablespoons of the strawberry reduction, but that was the only change I made. As many reviewers mentioned, it is better the next day, and even better the day after! This will be my go-to for strawberry frosting!

Made it with my carrot banana cupcakes. It made enough for 24 but there was a lot left over. They were done in about 20 mins. I used less icing sugar. After about 10 mins of light boiling there was only 5 TB of puree left so I added a total of 2 1/2 cups. They were delicious! Update: I made this again but doubled the recipe. I boiled the puree for about 10 mins again but it wasn't enough I don't think. It definitely needed to reduce longer! I could tell right away the frosting was too runny as I was making it but I didn't want to add more sugar so I just left it as is after adding just over 6 cups in total. There is tons left over after doing 32 cupcakes.

I took a chance and made these for a baby shower.  The recipe as written tastes like butter, but I added roughly 1/4 cup of reduced pur√©e that I ran through the blendtec to smooth out  the seeds.  I paired this strawberry frosting with lemon cupcakes...a total hit!  I got compliments all day long.

Delicious! Did not add the last bit of sugar because I was afraid it was going too be too sweet. Turned out perfect. I made an extra large batch of strawberry pur√©e and added in with plain white cake mix to make a scrumptious strawberry swirl cake. It was a big hit with my five year old daughter.

Excellent recipe, great flavour without being too strong or sweet. I used 1 1/2 cups of strawberries and I'm glad I did, I had just enough puree  after 10 minutes of reduction to make the frosting.

so good!  I added just a dash of strawberry extract, but other than that didn't change a thing.  It was flavorful and a great consistency.  I used this frosting on "Lemon Cupcakes" from Allrecipes and it frosted 12 cupcakes generously!

Guests stated this tasted better than most wedding cakes!  Used it as a layer between two round cakes and paired it with sliced strawberries.  Then i used the whipped cream frosting recipe for the outside of the whole cake.  Oh my word.  Wonderful.

This is a delicious strawberry frosting. It has a lovely strawberry flavor and beautiful color. I don't think that the pur√©e needs to cook for so long, just until syrupy. Make sure that you slice the strawberries before mesuring to get the right amount.

I just made this and I've got to say, i wish it tasted a bit more like strawberries, i feel like maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups of strawberries would have been perfect, i left out one cup of confectioners sugar because it was perfectly sweet without it! I would def make this again! It was amazing! Thank you for the recipe!

Way too greasy and too heavy, and Way too much work. And the strawberry flavor just wasn't there. I ended up adding some salt, just to get some flavor, I used a lot more strawberries (they were fresh and very tasty) and reduced them way down. It needs something to lighten it up and give it flavor. Not going to be making this one again

I made this to go on vanilla cupcakes, and I was certainly not disappointed! The taste of the strawberry isn't overwhelming, but at the same time isn't non-existent. I was piping the icing with a tip, so I added a bit of icing sugar (I think about 1/2 cup total?) to thicken it a bit. I'm definitely going to keep this in my cooking binder!

Its a good recipe but I made the mistake of  boiling  the strawberries for too long (only about 10 minutes) giving them a sour taste. I ended up adding about a fourth of teaspoon of vanilla extract to the icing to balance out the flavor.

I made mine with about half cup less of powdered sugar, a few drops lemon concentrate , and added just tiny amount of almond concentrate.  The flavor was strawberry without being too sweet with an undertone of lemon zing.

This is the best strawberry frosting I've ever made.  Granted it is the only strawberry frosting I've made, but I can't imagine anything out there better than this. I did amp up the strawberry flavor a bit by adding 1 TBS of freeze dried strawberry powder and that sent it over the top!

OMG good.  Big difference between fresh strawberry frosting and the fake canned stuff.  Made this on vanilla cupcakes for my mom on mother‚Äôs day.  Great strawberry flavor.

Tasted great, texture was a bit off. Will try again with some suggestions from other reviews, may also try as a cream cheese icing....

This frosting is amazing. The strawberry flavor really shines through. I was worried about the texture being gritty, so I ran the puree through a fine mesh strainer, then cheesecloth before I reduced it. It turned out perfect. Thanks, Candice!

Great recipe, but I did make some changes. I used it on an 8 inch cake, so I made a recipe and a half, and that was the perfect amount. I also altered the recipe itself. Instead of using the 1 1/2 cups of strawberries,  I used two cups of frozen strawberries and reduced them to the same amount and it was great. Also, I reduced the 1 1/2 cups of butter to 1 1/4 cups, and that worked great. Lastly, I reduced the 4 3/4 cups of confectioners sugar to 4 cups, and that gave it the perfect sweet yet tangy taste. I know this was confusing, but over reduce the butter and sugar and increase the amount of strawberries and it will be great!

I loved the recipe, especially because the sweetness level was perfect. I did think it was a bit too buttery for my taste so I folded in 1/4 cups of whipped cream and it was just perfect after!

I used raspberries in lieu of strawberries. The flavor was delightful but, as another reviewer stated, the seeds made it too grainy or crunchy. I will try this again but I will strain the seeds out before adding the fruit to the mixture.

I think I reduced my strawberry puree too much (cooked for 20 minutes instead of figuring out what reducing by half was), so I didn't add quite the entire amount of powdered sugar. No problem...it was still marvelous! I used Marianne's personal recipe for vanilla cupcakes and frosted them with this (http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62367457/sweet-vanilla-cupcakes/).  Since I used the large Wilton tip to swirl frost the cupcakes, it was only enough for 12. I'm sure if I had used a knife and spread the frosting on, it would have stretched to 18 servings. Definitely a frosting I will make again and again.

This was possibly the best frosting I've ever made.  I followed the directions with the exception of putting in a splash of lime juice. I was making the strawberry frosting to put on lime cupcakes.  I also reduced the strawberries a bit more than half to give it a more concentrated strawberry flavor.

I love this frosting! Absolutely the best. You can definitely taste the strawberries shining through, and the smell is just divine! I put my cupcakes in my car this morning to take to my son's school, and the air in my car was as dreamy as a walk through a strawberry shortcake garden on a summer day. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Sarah Jo!

My daughter wanted strawberry frosting for her birthday cake and I really don't like the taste of canned frosting.  So, off to Allrecipes I went and found this.... Delicious!  I made it exactly as directed.  Easy and very good!  Everyone though it was fantastic!  I am definitely going to be making it again.  The tweak I'm doing next time is use less powdered sugar and more strawberries.   I am a huge whipped cream frosting and not buttercream frosting fan, but this was great!  Homemade buttercream  is so much better than the crummy store made stuff!

the first time i made a BIG mistake. don't repeat my mistake. there is a BIG DIFFERENCE between BUTTER SPREAD (ie PLASTIC TUB BUTTER), MARGARINE, AND STICK BUTTER. the first time i accidentally used "smart and balance" which is BUTTER SPREAD, ie plastic tub butter; DO NOT USE BUTTER IN A PLASTIC TUB (ie country crock, i can't believe it's not butter, etc)- it is like 70% vegetable oil and 10% water, WHICH MEANS your frosting JUST WON'T HOLD. YOU HAVE TO USE STICK BUTTER. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.SECOND TIME: i used UNSALTED STICK BUTTER. added a pinch of salt, a pinch of almond extract, a little lemon juice, a little lemon zest, used 1 cup of confectioner sugar only, used double the strawberries and reduced it over heat, used half the butter, the other half i used whipped cream cheese and cool whip. refridgerate it overnight to thicken more. i am known to greatly reduce sugar and oil/ butter on recipes. message me here if u tried my version and let me know what u think! thx.

Why would anyone want to add strawberry extract to anything?! Thank goodness this recipe doesn't need it. It was full of strawberry flavor. We made it last night and followed the recipe to the letter. No additives are needed. No red food coloring, no nonsensical strawberry extract. Nothing. It's the perfect easy recipe. Many thanks for sharing Candice!

This recipe has killed every time I've made it.  Always a hit and always loved.  Ironically, I personally don't like strawberry, but the wife and the friends LOVE it!  Thanks!

I fully admit that I am not a fan of strawberry anything, but made this frosting per my daughter's request. It was a huge hit with the kids -even the non-dessert eaters. I even thought it was pretty good. Beats the heck out of artificially flavored frosting. Worth the few extra mins of prep time.

I want to start by saying that I don't like strawberries or buttercream frosting.  But my kids asked for vanilla cupcakes with strawberry frosting so I gave this a try.  The only change I made to the recipe was to strain the puree, as suggested in other reviews.  And WOW.  I mean, WOW.  This is a fabulous frosting.  Something about it is just marvelous.  It's not overly sweet (my strawberries were a bit tart, and I only added powdered sugar until I had a nice, firm frosting) and it has the perfect fresh berry taste.  I let it sit overnight and it really gets fabulous on day two.  Apparently, my aversion to strawberries is a texture issue, because I absolutely could not keep my spoon out of the bowl once this was made.  It paired perfectly with a light, fluffy vanilla cupcake and wasn't too sugar charged for the kids.  Amazing.  I'm definitely making this again.

i made this frosting to go with the real strawberry cupcakes linked to this recipe.  both were great.  the fresh strawberries i used this time were not entirely fabulous (i.e. not ruby-red and bursting with sweet strawberry flavor).  even so, the reduced strawberry puree was key.  i can only imagine the amazing flavor i will get when i remake these (and i WILL) with wonderful, ripe berries in season!  oh yum!!!

This is the BEST Strawberry frosting I have EVER tasted. I was able to reduce the strawberries while my cupcakes were baking, and the cakes cooled while I mixed the frosting. I put this on chocolate cupcakes for Valentine's Day, and it's a HIT! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe... might even use it for blueberries sometime!

Everyone loved this frosting.  I managed to miss getting the strawberries when shopping, so I substituted sugar free strawberry jam in place of puree, and it was wonderful!  And so much easier and quicker.

I love strawberries and I was really upset at the difficulty of finding frosting made with actual strawberries. This is my favorite frosting recipe so far. Excellent flavor and consistency. I don't mind the seed bits, but perhaps those who do can strain them out.

This is an amazing tasting, and texture icing. It is a subtle natural strawberry flavor with a soft, creamy workable texture. I used this icing on a green tea cupcake and it was amazing. Definitely recommend this icing for anything you see fit for it.

DELICIOUS. I can imagine it would be even better with real strawberries, but all we had on hand were frozen. This frosting was still amazing and one of my friends said she'll never accept strawberry frosting that isn't made from real strawberries again. I think that, since I served it over a dark chocolate cake, I would watch the amount of sugar. It was really really sweet and I think a more fruity flavor would better compliment some desserts. Overall it was perfect though and I'm excited to make it again!

I made this for one of my twins' first birthday cakes and everyone loved it.  I got a lot of compliments on the frosting.  I used it with yellow cake.  I followed the recipe as written, except at the end of step 6 when adding the last of the strawberry puree, I did not measure 2 tbsp but just added what remained in the saucepan.

This is a nice recipe. I used peaches instead of strawberries. The taste was nice BUT a little to sweet. Other than changing the fruit, I feel that I followed the recipe to the T. 
I will definitely use this recipe with other fruits but would like to know what I could do to make the consistency thicker.

oh so yummy!  I used 1/2 less of icing sugar because I don't want it too sweet.  It's absolutely awesome and has a very real strawberry taste.  I paired it with a vanilla cupcake and will try it with a lemon cupcake next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe!  After I cooked the strawberry pur√©e I strained out the seeds for a smoother icing. I think this would be a great way with any berry. Also did not use the last 1/2 cup of icing sugar.

I made this using strawberry jam instead of fresh strawberries...it was great!  It wasn't runny, it was how frosting should be.  It barely covered a 2 layer 9 inch cake though.  Also add a pinch of salt when you mix it, all frostings should have at least a pinch of salt otherwise it tastes like powdered sugar.
