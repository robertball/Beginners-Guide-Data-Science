I made this using tom sawyer blend.  I was very happy with the crust and I have tried many thin crust recipes over the past 25 years.  Only suggestions are:  maybe omit the xanthan if the blend you use already has it in there, and, I would love the weights used for the flours as blends are all different volume.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Gluten free brothers and sisters gather 'round. I believe we have a winner! This recipe is quite accurate and obviously well thought out. I used the submitter's flour mix and, even though I normally don't like millet flour, it really is good. Both texture and taste are impressive. I used the whisk attachment to aerate the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients with the paddle. I mixed everything as directed but after 4 minutes on high, I had a batter not a dough. So, keep your eye on that.  I used a wet rubber scraper to transfer it to the parchment paper. The baking pan size is also worth mentioning. I baked it on a 10" x 15" sheet and the dough didn't cook completely throughout because there was simply too much dough for the amount of space available. Next time, I will use a larger sheet in order to have a thinner crust. I also added a bit of oil on the parchment paper; both the bottom and top sheet. Thank you, Allen, for the recipe!!

I used a mix of garbanzo bean, potato, and sorghum flours. No xanthum gum or gelatin. No parchment paper; just pressed out on a pizza stone sprayed with Pam and baked for about 20 minutes; cooled, then added pizza toppings. Baked for another 20 minutes to melt cheeses. Excellent texture and flavor!

I made this tonight, and totally buggered it up because I didn't follow the instructions well - hello doughy middle. However, the result was so very tasty that my husband preferred the gluten free crust to the ordinary one I made as well! WOW! I will make this recipe often - but follow the instructions carefully next time!

This is amazing crust!! Great flavor and texture. I'm a baker who had to cut out gluten. I'm relearning to bake again. I'm putting this on the charcoal grill and making a pizza. Try it, you will love it too. Thank you to the person who made this recipe.

Best GF crust hands down!  Used Presidents Choice GF flour and it turned out amazing.  Thanks for sharing.
