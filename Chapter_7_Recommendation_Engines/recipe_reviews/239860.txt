So moist! I had to make a few changes unfortunately... I had planned on using flax seed but I grabbed the whole seed kind and didn't have a grinder on hand.. so I subbed in 1/2 cup extra of flour. So my version wasn't quite "better". But AMAZING taste/texture. I also drained the zucchini then threw in half of that liquid because I go to nervous it would be dry. Used a whole cup of chocolate chips because my husband refused to eat without

I thought this bread was delicious! More importantly, my picky daughter who doesn't like bread also thought so. The only thing I did different was use cinnamon applesauce instead of regular since that is what I had in the house already. Nice and moist and a lot less oil than other recipes I've used. I'll definitely be making it again.

Better Chocolate Chip Zucchini Bread Haiku: "I used one less egg. (The flax seed helped fill that in.) A few minor adds." Made my zucchini bread "mama-milk-friendly" by adding a TB of brewer's yeast and subbing 1/2 c of the flour for 1/2 c rolled oats. Some zucchini bread recipes say to put the grated zuc right in the batter, others say to drain the moisture. I went the draining route this time, and my bread was a little on the dry side, which was either due to that, or dropping one egg. Glad that I started my oven timer at 45 min. and checked at 50 min. b/c my bread was very much done at that point. Texture aside, the taste was incredible, and I plan on making this again, but maybe in muffin tins instead.
