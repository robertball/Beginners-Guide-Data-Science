Simple ingredients. Simple, delicious flavors. My kind of meal.  What's more, this was simple to prepare and required very few dishes.  I prepared this with the ingredients exactly as written, but enjoyed the cooking process by not measuring exactly, which also allowed me to use the ingredients in amounts to suit my own tastes and preferences.  This is a beautiful and delicious dish - big payoff for little effort - I had this served in minutes from start to finish.  I exercised self-discipline tonight and rather than serving it over rice I used "Miracle Rice."  (Described as "Shirataki rice, guilt free rice, zero calories, soy free, gluten free."  I can handle that)

What an oily, buttery, fattening MESS!  This was good, but good grief!  The main sauce ingredients were oil, butter and more oil!  I halved those ingredients and added some Chardonnay with a bit of corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  I also added the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I am soooo glad I did!  I can't imagine this otherwise!  Don't get me wrong, this was very good, but with a few alterations.

This was delicious -- I was looking for a "no carb" recipe for my husband.  I used just the "basil" only that comes in the squeeze tube which was all I had, and canned diced tomatoes, again all I had.  I added more spinach than called for, but the taste of this is fantastic!!

I've made this twice now and both times it has been a big hit! The only difference is I added thinly sliced onions and peppers. It has been such a big hit, can't wait to make it again!!

I love this recipe.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did make a couple changes.  I cut down on the fat (butter & oil) and added in white wine & lemon juice to make it more saucy.  I serve over pasta.  Have made this 3 times now.  Love it!

This is fabulous, thank you Valerie! I used much more spinach, and next time will definitely try others suggestions and add lemon and/or white wine (meant to do it this time but forgot!)  But even as it stands is really good...sop up the sauce with fresh rolls..yum, I wish there was some leftover I'd have it for breakfast! Update: have made this several times and often add about 1/2 cup of veggie broth to the butter and oil, and reduce it a bit, gives a bit more sauce and some extra flavour..oh yes and the wine!  Maybe this is varying too much from the original recipe but the end result is 5 stars!

I made this last night and it was amazing!!  I used all the ingredients mentioned, and the recipe was very true to its description.  Made it taste like restaurant quality and was so easy to make, with only a few ingredients.  One thing to note..my daughter and I do not, i repeat, do NOT eat tomatoes ever.  I decided to add some thinking that i would pick them out.  We ate the tomatoes too, as it had all the flavors of this dish.  I served this over pasta.   think it's the combination of the flavors that makes it perfect.  Definitely recommended, and will be making again.

This was excellent!  I loved all of the flavors.  I served it over penne pasta.  I used canned tomatoes and also added artichoke hearts.  Would be great with chicken, also.

It was awesome, even without the pesto because I didnt have any on hand. My husband loved it, and hes not a fan of spinach. I added a whole package of spinach..instead of the recommended amount, and it was superb. I kept picking at it while cooking!

Thank you for the amazing recipe. Tried it last night and we loved it. Used a whole bag of baby spinach, the entire jar of Classico basil pesto and 1 1/2 lb. medium shrimp then tossed with 1 lb. farfalle pasta. Delicious! Next time will add extra tomatoes too.

This was good, nothing amazing. I added 1/2 cup of white wine and a few splashes of lemon. It was an oily buttery mess though.

This was delicious! While sauteing the garlic, pesto and tomatoes I also added some white wine, (fresh basil and sage which are growing in my garden) and a very small amount of angel hair pasta. Once the pasta was al dente I added the shrimp then the fresh spinach and also added freshly grated pecorino romano cheese before serving. I did not use any butter and very little oil as I didn't think it needed it. I will definitely make this again.

Per the other reviews I only used a little butter & olive oil, just enough to coat the pan.  I also added some fresh lemon juice & white wine based on other reviews.  I also added a lot more pesto because we like it.  This dish was really good, and I'll make it again.  Might add some mushrooms next time instead of the spinach - while we love spinach, it just seemed to get "lost" in here.  Think I'd add mushrooms instead.

Really great. If you're not a huge garlic fan, don't add because the jar pesto has enough. I make this a lot and prefer to double the sauce , add white wine, a little half and half and a lot of spinach. I serve over pasta.

My family all agreed this is a five star recipe. I did cut down on the oil and butter to 1/4 cup and upped the shrimp to a 1 1/2 pounds. You really don't need to worry about measurements with this recipe, so less oil and butter would still work well. I read through the reviews and liked the idea of red bell peppers and mushrooms, so tossed them in with the tomatoes. The basil pesto gives a wonderful flavor especially if you're a garlic lover like me.  I added in more spinach, about 8oz. at the end until wilted. Served over a bed of noodles and made one wonderful meal of it.

Very good, we used canned diced tomatoes because thats what we had on hand. I would recommend using less olive oil and butter, and instead add some grated parmesan and white wine to balance the flavors with acid and salt. We also added chopped onion. Will be making again!

I made this dish on valentines day. I added white wine, little parsley and cut few red bell peppers heart shaped. Served over angel hair pasta. It was very good. I would make it again. My husband cleaned his plate and had seconds.

I used 1/4 stick a butter and no olive oil. Instead of olive oil, I made a packet of pesto & used the entire packet. IT WAS AMAZING. My hunny said it was restaurant quality & stuffed himself silly.

This recipe has good flavor, but I had to drain most of the oil and butter off. It was SO much! Wow - not heart healthy at all. I will cut back on those ingredients in the future. I may have put too much red pepper flakes in as well, but it was too spicy for me.

This was soooo good.  I was looking for something with both spinach and shrimp and came across this one.  Very good!  When I was assembling the ingredients I realized I didn't have  any tomatoes, fresh or canned.  So I had an aha moment and used salsa.  It was actually pretty good!  Served it over bow ties.  Yummy!

This was pretty good. I only used margarine, no oil. It would have been better without the red pepper flakes. I didn't have any rice so I served it over whole wheat couscous.

It was awesome. I did change several things I used lemon juice and white wine and cut the olive oil and butter in half. I will be making this again. However, next time I will add some cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. But great the way it was.

Wow!  This was exceptional!  I varied slightly by adding 1/2 cup of chablis and juice from one lemon.  I also thickened slightly with a little cornstarch and water and served it over farfelle pasta.  Definetely a keeper!

Great recipe. Even my husband who doesn't usually like spinach or cooked tomatoes loved it.  The second time I made it I added 1/2 cup white wine and the juice of 1 lemon and it was excellent!

Easier to prepare than I thought. I was short on some ingredients, ended up using rotel and used lemon flavored crisco vegi oil.  Served over noodles and the lemon flavor gave a nice contrast, the rotel didn't hurt for just a small touch of a bite, was actually quite pleased.

I consider myself to be a scampi snob & I loved this. I had to make some modifications based on what I had on hand. I cut the butter to 1/4 c, added 1T lemon juice & 1/4 c of pinot Grigio. I used frozen cooked shrimp which I thawed ahead of time & cherry tomatoes that I cut in half.  After sauteeing the garlic & spices, I added the shrimp, tomatoes & spinach all at once & cooked til heated through. Served over linguini & it was truly scrumptious. Update: I have to laugh as this was in my "favorites" & I didn't remember I had already made it. This time, I followed the recipe (no added wine or lemon juice) but I added 1/4 c. Chopped red onion & 4 oz sliced mushrooms at the beginning. It was truly delicious made this way! 5 stars again!

As written, I agree with other reviewers, there is too much oil and butter.  I cut way back on both of those (only used about 1/3-1/2 as much as called for) and it turned out perfectly that way.  Very simple, quick meal to make and had rave reviews.

I made this on New Year's Eve for my family.  It was delicious.  I used the recipe as a guideline which means I didn't measure anything out and substituted ingredients with what I had on hand.  This is what I did:   EVOO to cover my pan bottom; frozen chopped mustard greens with fresh plum tomatoes diced along with a squeeze of fresh red pepper paste, and half of a small jar of Delallo artichoke bruschetta; one half Meyer lemon juice; and 30 large raw peeled Tiger prawns topped with a sprinkle of dried crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook until the shrimp are pink/tender.   I served it all over Jasmine rice.  It was a hit.  Thanks so much for this recipe,  I love being able to use allrecipes as a custom recipe generator.  Happy New Year 2014!!

Red roses and this recipe and you'll be a hero to your wife. Easy to make and very delicious. I added an extra close or two of garlic to spice it up a bit! Otherwise, it's perfect over bow ties or linguine.

WOW.  Flavor, easy to make & feels like a "special" occasion meal. We did use the white wine instead of the olive oil as other suggested.  We also out of preference used 1/2 the butter. This will be made more often now.

SO GOOD. Served over pasta. Need to AT LEAST double the garlic. Used halved grape tomatoes, which were sweeter. Also added some chopped Italian parsley into the skillet with the spinach, and topped it off with a squeeze of lemon.

This was so easy to make and delicious.  Saved the recipe to use again and again.  Will make during the week day.  I used already peeled and deveined shrimp along with fresh spinach that was washed and ready to go. So putting the ingredients  together was a breeze.

This recipe is great.  I used it as a base but made changes.  I did not use pesto or tomatoes.  I used scallops and shrimp.  I also reduced the amount of butter and olive oil as suggested by others and added white wine.  The results were soooo good.  I'm looking forward to having leftovers today.

This was really good.  Like others, I amended it a bit...added a splash of chicken broth, a squeeze of lemon juice, only used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and butter...the base recipe is great and very forgiving. Putting this in permanent rotation, thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly , other than using canned tomatoes and using only enough shrimp for 2.  I just used about 1 tablespoon (or less) of butter and just enough olive oil to coat pan.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again soon.  Next time I will increase spinach, garlic and spices.  It is a great, easy recipe!

This was very simple to make and was delicious. I just used up all my Roma Tomatoes earlier today to make salsa, so I substituted roasted red pepper instead. Fantastic.

I made this according to the recipe.  This was an greasy mess, but tasted great.  I will make this again, but will likely cut the butter and oil to a smaller quantity.

This was an outstanding recipe!  I reduced the amount of butter and olive oil a tiny bit, and added a little dry white wine to make up for what I reduced.  I also topped it with fresh shredded Parmesan before serving.  We LOVED it!

I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 2 tbs. each of butter and olive oil.  I did add more pesto (approx. 4 tbs.) and didn't add any additional garlic.  With the pesto, there was plenty of garlic.  I used a whole bag of baby spinach, an additional tomato, and 2 lbs. of shrimp and there was plenty of sauce.  Served over brown rice it was delicious!  I think the suggestion of thickening the sauce with a bit of cornstarch and water would make it even more amazing.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this tonight for dinner.  Delicious.  I love it that people can leave reviews on these dishes--as long as there are only a minor change or two to the original recipe and if there are several people recommending the same change, I usually follow it.  I did cut back the butter and olive oil and added a bit of white wine and juice of 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon, and it was wonderful!  I had olive pesto in the cabinet and used that.  The tomatoe-y flavor of the pesto and the tomato really make the sauce good, as does the spinach.  Excellent recipe.

Minimal effort for fine Italian restaurant quality. I scaled this down to two servings (just for myself). This comes together VERY quickly.  After reading reviews, I further cut back by half on the oil and butter (~1 tblsp each). My small shrimp were frozen-cooked, so I thawed and cooked just until heated. I didn't want to open a jar of pesto sauce, so I just used dried basil. Nice bite from the red pepper flakes; used regular tomatoes. I also added a splash of white wine, and I found that it does need salt. I had as-is (no pasta), so that was a nice, low-carb treat! Definite keeper recipe!

Simple & amazing recipe !   Like several others, I also reduced the oil & butter, but added a splash of white wine & a squeeze of lemon juice to finish off.  Served over penne pasta was delicious !   Will definitely be making this one again :-)

This was so delicious!  I kept right with the recipe as I do the first time around as not to mess up the ratings of the true recipe.  I love the pesto flavor that came through.  Next time I will add a little more spinach since we are spinach fans and it really shrinks down. For those of you that think there was too much oil and butter, just pour the entire shrimp dish into a pan of linguine and it works perfectly.

I made a couple of changes. I did use less olive oil and butter. I did not have pesto and so did not use it in the recipe. I used Farfalle pasta instead of rice. 

I gave the recipe 5 stars because my version was very, very good, and I'm sure the pesto used in the original version would have made it excellent.

My husband also said it restaurant worthy. This definitely will appear in the menu often. 

Thank you!

I was surprised I like this so much. I halved the butter and oil and next time I'd do even less. It definitely needed orzo or some type of pasta to absorb the juice.  I want to avoid carbs so I drained the juice. I used a can of tomatoes instead of fresh and pre-cooked shrimp. This was super fast and really good!

As written, I'd give it 4 stars. It's too much fat.  I cut the fat in half, doubled the garlic, added 1/2 cup white wine after sautéing the shrimp, doubled the spinach and also threw in some artichokes.  With those changes,  it's closer to 5 stars. Yum!

I mixed 1/2 avacdo with lemon juice and white wine in a blender, added this "sauce".  It was a perfect creamy consistency.  Didn't use nearly the amount of oil and butter as called for. Served the dish over angel hair pasta.  I changed it so much that it's probably not fair to review it but I loved the end result.

According to others it was too oily, so I halved the butter and oil and did not add anymore when I added the shrimp. I also used cherry tomatoes and added parm and put it over noodles! Delicious!

Making this for the second time and I must say it is by far the best tasting shrimp dish I've ever made!!!!
Simple, quick, and absolutely delicious!!
I did however forego the "prepared basil pesto" and used fresh, chopped, dried basil from my garden, about 3 tablespoons, and added a little (1/4 cup) cooking wine, and a squish (1/3 of a lg lemon) of fresh lemon juice. - KO'

Very yummy. Would cut down on the butter, but other than that it was delicious.

The Jersey tomatoes are beautiful now and because of that I have made this a few times already.  I serve it over thin spaghetti when I have company but when it's just me I eat it as a low carb meal and skip the rice or pasta.  I even made it "cauliflower mashed potatoes" on the side once. If you low carb it you know what that is.  The flavors meld together really nicely. Terrific recipe.

This is the first review I've done, although I have used allrecipes.com forever. 
After reading a few reviews I decided to add Chardonnay (2/3 c) and corn starch (1 T). 
I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and used 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp. 
Easy, breezy dish that I will make again and again

I used a little less butter and more pesto. It was awesome! I especially liked soaking up the remaining sauce with bread at the end. Will definitely make again.

You have to make this and taste just how good it really is!
I made this for the first time a couple of years ago and make it a couple times a month now, every month.

Simply delicious...emphasis on the simple...I used thawed frozen just because of the cost. If you do that, just be sure to thaw and allow the excess liquid to drain or you will have a watery dish.

My family loves this recipe and I make it often. I like to serve it over linguine noodles. The only change I make is to leave out the olive oil; my pesto is oily and the 1/3 cup butter seems plenty. Also - a couple times I was in a pinch for tomatoes and substituted a can of drained petite-diced tomatoes. Tasted equally as wonderful! If you happen to have any leftovers, it reheats very well the next day, too! Yummy!!

Tried this dish last week and I wanted to make sure I rated it because it was so delicious!  I followed the directions to a "T".  I served the meal with some dinner rolls.  When my husband and I were done eating, there was no food leftover.  Will definitely make this dish again.  YUM!

Really easy and tasted good!  Next time I would add salt.  Maybe a 1/2 teaspoon or so.  I used cooked shrimp and reduced cooking time.  Turned out fine.  Less work.
