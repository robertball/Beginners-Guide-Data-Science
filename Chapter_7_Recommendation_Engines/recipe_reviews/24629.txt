Very easy.  I bit too much garlic for my taste.  Perhaps 3 is enough.  Also, I used the liquid from the beans to smooth out the spread instead of more lemon juice.   I also top with parsley and paprika.

Very good!  I am picky about my hummus, and this is finally one I LOVE.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce for kick, and some reserved bean juice.  But it was just adding to the perfection of the recipe!

OMG! Who would've thought a little can of garbanzo beans could transform into something so delicous! It doesn't get easier or much simpler than this! I cut the recipe in half and put everything into a mini food processor, used a little sesame oil as I didn't have any tahini and just back just a bit on garlic. I also added in the reserved bean liquid as needed along with just a splash of lemon juice vs. the whole amount. I served it topped with a bit of paprika and surrounded by homemade pita chips - YUM!

Very nice.  As I didn't have tahini, I sauted 2T sesame seeds along with the garlic in about 2T olive oil before adding. I doubled the crushed red pepper, and threw in some roasted red peppers at the end which added a nice color. I will definitely make this again.

As written, deserves 1 star because have to add much more liquid - triple! I used 1 can & added 6 Tblsp. liquid! For 2 cans, that's equivalent to 3/4 cup liquid - some of that should be water, or it'll be VERY lemony. (I personally don't like using the liquid from canned beans bec. it's slimy.) Halving the quantity of garlic would probably suit most people; add full amount if you want it to be very garlicky. For adherence to traditionally authentic ingreds., this gets 4 stars. 2 is between 1 & 4, so 2 stars is what I rate it. (The red pepper flakes aren't traditional, though are a nice change from mild paprika. If using garbanzos cooked from dry, then adding some of that cooking water to achieve smooth puree is probably a good idea, I think.)

I just made this and it was very good! For those of you who don't have tahini,  I didn't have any so I left that out and it still tastes like hummus to me.

Death by Garlic:
I strongly feel that the absolute max ratio of garlic cloves to (15oz) cans of garbanzos is 2:1.  So, maximum 2 large garlic cloves to 1 can of 15oz beans.  Even as a garlic lover, I only use 2 small or 1 large clove per can.  This had so much garlic bite that it almost made me nauseous.

Easy to prepare and a great taste!  I made a perfect batch on the first attempt.  The texture is perfect and the garlic is strong just how I love it.  Those who don't like a strong garlic taste can just reduce the cloves to taste.  Thank you for the recipe.  I have to thank my french classmate for pointing out this site.  Merci buckets Kelly!

Using canned beans, be sure to rub them together to remove the skins! Save the juice because the mixture gets very thick. It was too thick for the blender, better use the food processor.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The consistency was thick - as the recipe suggested it might be.  I added the remainder of the lemon juice that my lemon produced and some of the fluid from the can - as other reviewers suggested.  It all lent to a very flavorful hummus.  I am using this as a dip for broccoli and carrots to try and increase my protein intake while eating healthy foods, as well.  I foresee making this on a weekly basis - and I can add different things instead of the garlic (or in addition to) to change it up.  As is, this is an ideal hummus, in my mind.  Much better than anything purchased commercially!

This is how I always make hummus, just add a little more of everything until it tastes right.  It's a good base recipe to add to.  I also add salt and pepper and sometimes olive oil.  They have small cans of tehani (tahini) in the ethnic foods section at most grocery stores.

Ok. I like my hummus spicy and not too chunky. This came out dry and a bit flavorless (despite all the garlic!) . I'd add a bit of olive oil, or perhaps cook the garbanzo beans a bit...

I like this better than most commercially prepared hummus. I LOVE garlic and this has quite a zip with that much in it. Really good.

Fresh and flavorful - so much better than store bought hummus!  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in one day.  I especially like the garlic and lemon in this recipe.  I served it with cut up whole wheat pita triangles.

I had to alter this one a lot to make it taste good. too much lemon (i added another can of beans whiched helped), i couldn't get the right texture-beans were chunky, could have been my food processor or my fault. I also added double the red pepper flakes and fresh parsley for taste. turned out tasty in my pita pocket!

This hummus is so easy and tasty too!  I love green olives and garlic so I added olives stuffed with garlic and some of that juice to give a slightly different flavor.  Very easy to adapt to your taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I had trouble getting the right consistency. Using lemon juice as the only liquid makes the hummus too tart. I also thought this recipe was not as flavorful as other hummus I've tried.

a bit too plain but still amazingly delicious! add 1/4 tsp of cumin, cayenne pepper( optional) and black pepper ( forgot if was on the list already) but NO SALT! pour very gentle a drizzle of olive oil while ingredients are grinding in the food processor, and definitely need a bit more of tahini! ( coming from a lebanese family)

good recipe. I omitted the red pepper because it was for my daughter at college and she doesn't like it spicy. I kept the same amount of garlic but roasted it first. I also added a few drops of sesame oil. it came out really good.
