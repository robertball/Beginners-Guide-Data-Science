Great base recipe to start from, add whatever veggies tickle your fancy.  I added mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli and sun-dried tomoatoes along with the veggies listed in the recipe.  I also used skim mozzarella cheese to keep it light.  This is something you can whip up and throw in the oven. No muss, no fuss! With the leftovers, I cut into individual pieces and wrapped them separately to freeze them, then on busy mornings, just pop one in the microwave on high for 45 seconds and serve with a slice of whole grain toast for a very satisfying, healthy breakfast on the go!

Appealing in taste and looks. I added half mozerella and half cheddar cheese. I increased the recipe by 1/2 and baked the frittata in an iron skillet. Something I would eat for breakfast or any time. Yum!

We made this tonight and it went over very well!  We made a few alterations (mozzarella cheese w/ sun-dried tomatoes & basil) (an additional egg) (4 slices of bacon, crumbled).  The baking time and serving size estimate were accurate. The bread crumbs helped to beef it up.  My husband was very complimentary and we will definitely make it again!

This was breakfast yesterday morning. I used a large onion and two large red peppers instead of green and I upped the garlic. I did not have fresh parsley, I just subbed in dried. I made this in my cast iron skillet, just sauteeing the onion, green pepper and garlic in the skillet with a good amount more butter, then adding everything else and transferring it right to the oven. I got a really nice crust on the fritatta and it baked up beautifully. We loved it. Next time, I think I'll add potatoes and mushrooms.

This was excellent!  I made a few modifications to make it more in line with my family's tastes.  I eliminated the bread crumbs because we're not big on filler.  We're not big on green pepper so we swapped them for broccoli.  I pre-cooked the broccoli with the onions and garlic but I think next time I won't do that.  I also prefer basil to parsley so I swapped that out, too.  I didn't have any mozzarella so used cheddar but in the interest of health, I'll probably use skim mozzarella next time.  I doubled the recipe and sauteed and baked everything in my cast iron skillet.  No sticking problems whatsoever.  The colors of this were gorgeous and it was so simple and tasty, we'll definitely be making it again.  Thank you!

Don't wait until Christmas morning to make this. It's too easy and too good to wait that long. I have made oven omelets, or frittatas, fairly often and this was one of the better ones. I left out the Worcestershire because for me it seemed a strange addition and I did include the bread crumbs, tho' I was tempted not to. I used regular breadcrumbs, not seasoned.  I made no additions other than some coarsely chopped pepperoni slices which was, I might add, PERFECT for this!  This was delicious on its own, but it wouldn't suffer by adding other herb seasoning if you felt compelled to.  I personally liked the clean, fresh flavors which all came together to result in something really delicious.  The bread crumbs, which had aroused my curiosity, proved to be an integral part of the dish - the submitter added them for good reason. They give the omelet a sturdier, more substantive structure than omelets I've made with just the typical eggs/milk mixture.  In fact, I noticed there was no milk, water or cream in the recipe and wondered how that would work, but again, this just turned out to be a little "huskier" if you will.  I liked the difference the bread crumbs made.  Hubs and I cleaned this up heartily, with a little fresh fruit on the side.  It was a delicious, festive Sunday morning breakfast.

I've never tried making a Frittata before and I must say that this venture was extremly successful!

Loved the taste and texture, was fairly easy to prepare and above all, all the ingredients needed are present in almost all kitchens :)

Note: Made it as it was described, didn't change anything.

Fantastic recipe. Since I made this for dinner I decided to add in a cup of chopped pepperoni and it was delicious. I used dried parsely instead of fresh and used only about 1 1/2 teaspoons and it was perfect. Fabulous recipe - great flavor!

Terrific frittata.  I didn't have any peppers so I just used sweet vidalia onions, garlic and tomatoes.  I also added a little feta and used a sharp cheese mix.  I definitely suggest spraying the pie plate with non stick spray.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe as written.  The parsley taste was way too overpowering and it could have used more tomatoes.  The leftovers tasted a lot better (I ate them three days later).  I might use this as a basis for a recipe in the future, but I'm not going to cook it as written.

Wow!  I omitted the green pepper and tomatoes (didn't have any).  Instead I added about 1.5 cups of cooked chicken, a whole bag of fresh spinach (sauteed with the onion before mixing everything) and lots of fresh garlic.  Instead of mozzarella, I used mostly cheddar and jack mix with a 1/4 cup of parmesan.  I also used 7 eggs.  Sprayed a 9x13 glass baking dish with PAM and baked at 350 for 35ish minutes.  I just tasted it right out of the oven, and I had to give myself a pat on the back.  Go me.  :)

Super easy to make.  I took it to a brunch and won "best dish." I did make a couple of changes.  I sauteed in olive oil instead of butter (to be little more healthy) and I used canned diced tomatoes in garlic and olive oil (drained the liquid).  I also made it the night before.  When I baked it, it only took an extra 5 minutes.  Everything was wonderful!

AWESOME recipe! I added pre-cooked chicken from the roaster chicken you can get at the grocery store, about 1 cup, made the recipe a bit more filling and the meat made it right up by boyfriend's alley! We're planning on making this once a month!

Great base recipe! READ OTHER REVIEWERs notes for great tips. Used 6 eggs (instead of 5), added 1/2 tsp dried Thyme, used only 1 cup of cheese (1/2c mozzerella,1/2c cheddar), added 1/4c kale & 1/2c mushrooms (sauteed w/other veggies), and added 3/4c diced turkey ham. YUM! Dad loved it too!

Served Xmas morning - Every single person loved this - and easy to make!  Not at all dry or tasting like scrambled eggs, which has happened with other egg dishes that bake in the oven.

I omitted the bread crumbs so I can't comment on how they would change the recipe. But I can say that this frittata was fantastic -- I made it for my family for Christmas and the entire thing was devoured. Definitely don't cut back on the cheese, it's what makes the recipe.

I understand why some cooks get irritated with reviews that strayed from the original recipe. That being said, I too made some changes because of ingredients available and personal preference. I used six smallish eggs, 1/2 cp Italian seasoned breadcrumbs moistened with milk, 2 cps grated Swiss cheese. All other ingredients and amounts were kept as written. Results:  raves all round from my friends! I've decided that I prefer a frittata over a quiche. Thanks Marlene!

One of the best breakfast!  I baked it for 25 minutes and it's perfect.  I added spinach, not green pepper, because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I had never made or eaten frittata, but this dish was tasty and easy to prepare. I used egg beaters instead of eggs and made my soft bread crumbs out of whole grain bread. Everything else I followed exactly and it was delicious. The texture was great, not eggy like I expected. Will definitely make again!

This is a delicious, flavorful frittata.  I noticed some comments about the overpowering flavor of the parsley -- Be sure to use Italian (flat leaf) Parsley, as opposed to regular parsley that is typically used for garnish.

This was good, but I think next time I would leave out the breadcrumbs.  I added broccoli to the stir fried mixture as we like a veggie-rich frittata.  Very nice.

This was really good and so easy to make and is an excellent base recipe that is easily adjusted to suit your own tastes.  I made several additions to mine such as adding bacon, diced ham, substituted 1 cup of cheddar cheese for 1 cup of mozzarella and added a little freshly grated parmesan as I happened to have it on hand.  My husband thought it would be even better with some chopped jalapenos so next time I'll add some when cooking the veggies.

USED 12 EGGS...The default was for 6 servings, but after following all the other ingredients to to "T" I realised that I needed to put it in a 9x13 baking dish...so I added the rest of my dozen to the mix (without increasing the other ingredients at all).  I did put it in an UNGREASED baking dish for 30 min at 350, and oh my goodness it was soooo delicious!  I think you sooo much for this recipe :)  My family loved it!  Even took the leftovers out of the fridge and they ate it cold!  Thank you for sharing!

This is really delicious! I followed the recipe, but you can easily vary it by using different cheese and adding extra vegetables. I'm planning to make it again soon.

Added in a few more veggies and everyone liked this. A little heavy on the bread crumbs for our tastes, but really good in general.

This is my new base recipe! I make egg bakes, quiches, frittatas about once a week and this one is exceptional! I basically use the vegetables I have on hand and will follow this recipe using the eggs, worceshtshire sauce, bread crumb, and seasonings...that's what makes this dish! Just follow the quantities and bake times and it is so versatile.

I used 10 eggs, and used 1/2 Gouda & 1/2 mozzarella cheese.  It was delicious!  I also suggest using roma or grape tomatoes so there is less tomato juice.

Made a variety of these for a bridal shower brunch I hosted - so easy to make ahead of time, and everyone raved about them. Easy to adjust if you have a combination of picky eaters/special dietary needs.

VERY good!  I made it for Christmas breakfast  (6 people) - exactly as the recipes appears and it was a hit.  Next time I will make 2 of them though.... one just wasn't enough for 6 people.

Wow! This was excellent. I substituted the tomatoes and used brocolli and everyone loved it! I also baked it in the same pan as I had fried the onions & broc in.  Made for easy cleanup.

I thought this recipe was great and followed it exactly. I actually made it for christmas morning and my parents were impressed. Next time I will have to double the recipe because there was barely enough for four people!

YUUUHHHM! I read other reviews, and doctored as follows: replaced tomato w a can of drained Rotel, replaced parsley w a couple Tbsp cilantro, added a leftover diced portobello I had, a couple Tbsp of jarred diced jalapenos, and did half-and-half cheese, using Italian and Mexican shredded. Only had 4 eggs, and y'wouldn't know it. This was AWESOME, and received RAVE reviews from hubby. LOVE the worcestershire and bread crumbs addition!  THANK YOU for posting this! Perfect for any time, not just Christmas!!!

I made this for the first time on Christmas morning.  It was delicious!  I took longer to put together than the recipe said, but still easy.  I added red pepper instead of green, basil instead of parsley plus spinach, bacon and used 6 eggs.  It turned out great!

Delicious...  but unless you are willing to toss your pie pan, suggest strongly that you line the pan or spray it.

There was no way I was waiting for Christmas morning to try this.  We had it for supper with tomato mushroom soup and olive bread (both from this site).  I completely forgot the green pepper, and I could kick myself!  I was worried when I mixed the bread crumbs into the eggs -- the crumbs sucked up all the moisture.  I wondered how I was going to incorporate all the veggies and cheese.  I don't know how it worked, but it worked.  Very easy to prepare, and tasted great.  Using the breadcrumbs makes it not-eggy, nothing like an omelet.  P.S.  My boyfried, who hates spinach, saw me throw spinach in the cart at the grocery store.  He thought the parsely in this dish was spinach, and went on and on about how good it was.  Hmmm, I don't think I'll tell him it was parsley!

Great recipe - I served this at a brunch and everyone liked it.  I made it with blanched broccoli and several cheeses - mozzarella, cheddar, and swiss.  Added bread cubes instead of bread crumbs.  I doubled the recipe and baked it 45 minutes in a 9 x 13 pan.  Delicious!

Yum!  I made this for brunch on a very snowy day and it was delicious.  My husband, who I didn't realize doesn't like "quiche-y things," went back for seconds!  I did make a few changes.  I left out the bread crumbs, tomato (as that is one thing I do know my husband dislikes), and green pepper.  I used a small can of mushrooms, chopped up.  I think the green pepper would have been great in here, I'll have to make sure I have one the next time I make this.  I also lightly sprayed the plate with Pam.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I'm going to keep playing with it, adding different veggies and probably meat.

Easy recipes. I made a few changes using what I had. Instead of using mozzarella cheese, I used 1 cup of feta cheese,  1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese. I also used green onions instead of regular onions. It was delicious.

Easy recipe to use as a base.  Originally made 2 for Christmas morning but have also used it as an easy fix to entertain brunch guests, or as a quick after work dinner.  Add whatever veggies are on hand, and usually use a 4oz can of tomato sauce instead as we don't like the taste of tomato.

Really good....used 6 eggs about 1/2c skim milk, added chopped broccoli, red peppers, vidalia onion, and leftover home fries that were cooked with green peppers, part skim mozzarella, fresh basil since I had no parsley, and sliced tomatoes on top. Really yummy and colorful. Served hubby a hearty wedge served on whole wheat toast for dinner. Thanks!

I made this for Easter brunch, and it went over great. I added 1 sweet potato, cubed and steamed it in the microwave for 5 mins to get it cooked before adding to other veggies.I also sprinkled 1/3 cup of fresh basil on top before baking and once it was cooked I stuck it under the broiler with gouda and cheddar on top. Everyone loved it!
