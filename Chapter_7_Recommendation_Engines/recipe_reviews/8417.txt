SO GOOD!!! It needed tweaking for my 2 layer 9 inch cake. If you follow the directions it is VERY thick and hard for icing a cake but great for brownies. For the cake I used 3 Tbsp of milk and 2 tbsp cocoa for a single batch. Because it sets up so quickly I made 2 seperate double batches, one for the middle of the cake using the original thick recipe, frosted it, then made the second double batch tweaked for spreadability for the outside of the cake. It is glorious... and I don't even like chocolate!

This recipe was excellent - I added a few semi-sweet chocolate chips to tbe melted butter and sugar mixture while still warm, and it turned out rich, velvety and chocolatey! I kept the icing in the saucepan while spreading it on the cake, so that when it began to set somewhat, I would just warm it up on minimum heat with a bit more milk and I could continue to work with it. A total hit and a keeper of a recipe!

Outstanding!! I did add 1/2 cup of Chocolate cocolate chips to the butter & brown sugar mixture to make it a little more fudgy.  It got raves from my company.  I will use it frequently.

tasty.  sets pretty firm, very fudgy.  Firm enough to crack slightly when cutting my cake.  My only complaint was that it was too firm/dry to stick to the cake.  I'll try more milk next time.

This icing set extremely fast and it was a little difficult to ice a 2-8" round layer cake.  It also was more of a maple flavour due the the brown sugar content, but it was very good and I would make it again.

I covered some brownies with this chocolate icing.  Quick and easy; very sugary and sweet.  The kids loved it.  Next time I will add some chocolate morsels - it lack chocolate flavor.  In addition, if you wanted to do more than cover a batch of brownies, you will need to double the recipe.

It was perfect for a sheet cake. My bunch loved it. I did add 1 extra Tablespoon of cocoa on the recommendation of another user. Thanks.

This was a great recipe for icing. It did set up a little fast but if you put it back on the heat for a few seconds, it softens right back up. My dad loved this icing and that is like winning an Oscar. I put it on Carol's Marble Cake (a recipe on this site) and since it was chocolate I thought he wouldn't like it. He loved it. Thanks Chas!

This icing is awesome! I added more milk til it was glossy, then dipped my cupcakes on it while it was hot, and it dried smooth and glazed, very pretty!

Great icing!  I used the Black Magic cake recipe for cupcakes and topped them with this icing.  It was fantastic!  The icing does set quickly so I do think it is more appropriate for things like cupcakes or donuts....but I loved the taste and it was so easy!  I wouldn't change a thing!

This icing is truly delicious. It has a slight caramel flavor and a surprisingly strong chocolate flavor all at the same time. I used this to ice cream cheese brownies and they are so sweet and yummy. The icing does set up very quickly and at first I had a hard time getting the confectioners sugar to blend in well but I just added a little extra milk as recommended and it turned out beautifully. The icing is almost a fudgy consistency after it cools and if you like sweets as much as my family does, that is a good thing. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent! I did as a few of the others did and added 1/2 c semisweet choc chips to the butter and brown sugar mixture (after the sugar melts and you add the milk) and added an additional 1 T cocoa.  FYI, icing is best for brownies, cookies and SHEET cakes, as was stated by the submitter of the recipe, for layer cakes, frostings are better.  However if you are looking for a true icing that will wow the most sage chocolate fan...this one is IT!

I made a cake from scratch and then polked holes in the cake so the hot  icing would drip down into the still hot from the oven cake.  I then topped it with some tart cherries I mixed with sugar and cornstarch. It was absolutely awesome served warm.

Fantastic... the only change I would make is to double it.. I was just able to cover a sheet cake.. so if I used this for cupcakes as originally planned I would have run short.  Great flavor!!

Since the frosting looks glossy in the photos, I was expecting a creamy consistency. I was surprised when the icing hardened, but not disappointed, as it was absolutely yummy. Love the extra "flavour dimension" added by the brown sugar. I used a few drops of almond extract because I didn't have quite enough vanilla -- the flavour complemented my brownies perfectly.

Great for brownies, but hard to spread on cake. Melts in your mouth in a DELICIOUS way. Try 2 Tbs. of chocolate instead of 1 and a bit more milk to make it less thick. Very yummy!

This was good, but I made better. I did though put peanut butter (to taste) into the icing and I put it on brownies...good. Next time I will probably alter this recipe but for the most part it was that bad.

Excellent recipe for a rich dark chocolate icing! I only had coconut milk on hand but I think it only enhanced it!! Wonderful flavor! It did set fast so I added a little bit of coconut milk to thin it out so I could finish frosting as mentioned in the recipe!! 5 stars!!

Was very sweet. More of a frosting you would use on brownies. Did set very fast even adding the extra milk.

Not at all impressed with the texture or flavor and it wasn't nearly enough to frost a 2 layer cake.  Tastes too much like brown sugar and is too sweet and gritty.

I added an extra Tbs of cocoa for a really fudgey taste.  This worked perfectly to top a marshmallow and crushed grahm cracker mixture to make S'more Bars.  It has a very nice fudge like texture.

This was a great frosting! I did not have cocoa powder, so I used 1/2 oz. unsweetened chocolate, and melted it in with the butter/sugar mixture, along with 1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. I did not let it boil, b/c of the addition of the chocolate, but it turned out really yummy. Thanks!

This is fudge on a cake!! It's great!  I added the extra cocoa powder and the 1/2 cup choc chips like other reviewers.  It took 2 batches to ice an 8" layer cake.  Make one batch at a time and it will work.

Oh my god!!! This is the best Icing I have ever made.  I added more cocoa like the other reviews stated.  It melts in your mouth!  It wasn't thick enough to spread it on so I just poured it and it set up really fast.  I used it as icing for my brownies.  The family thought it was the best ever.  Thanks for such an easy recipie.  I will make this often for my cakes and brownies.

Best icing ever!  I added the 1/2c of chocolate chips to the butter and sugar that others suggested.  It's like having fudge on top of my cake!  I had to add a little milk to the icing a couple of times as it "set" in the bowl between using it and going back for more.  Each time I refreshed it with milk and it set on the cupcakes beautifully smooth again.

I used this icing simply because I had the ingredients. Based on other reviews, I used 5 tablespoons of milk and 2.5 tablespoons of cocoa. Off the spoon, it tastes great.  I took my cake from the oven, poked holes in it and simply poured the icing over my still hot cake. I did keep it on a double boiler when mixing in the icing sugar and cocoa. Hopefully it still firms up, since I did add extra milk.  Can't wait to try it!

i tried this recipe today. It was very easy to follow . But I would add more cocoa powder or melt chocolate chips in it next time. Tasted like a chocolate caramel.

Amazing!!! I followed a few tips from some of the reviews & added 1/2 C chocolate chips to the butter/brown sugar stage to make it more chocolatey & went with 3T milk & 2T cocoa. It was just enough to pour over my 9x13 pan of brownies, not too dry at all this way...my hubby is in heaven!

It would get 5 stars for taste but for usability it only get 3 stars. It was very difficult to spread on the sides of a layer cake.  Disappointed in the spreadability and found it frustrating!

Great recipe! While Melting the butter, sugar and adding the milk I added an extra T of milk. I also added an extra 1 1/2 T cocoa as well as substituting the vanilla with some Teaberry extract. Turned out great!! definitely going to make this again, thanks!

Great recipe!! I read a lot of the reviews. Added a bit more coco. Since I was icing cupcakes I made a double boiler and added about a TBSP of shortening. Once I like the consistency I dipped the cupcakes in.. What a GREAT turn out.. will be using this every time.

I discovered this icing recipe about a year and a half ago and have made it many times since then.  I play with the proportions and the ingredients sometimes using cocoa and sometimes using Giradelli Ground Chocolate, or using half and half instead of milk.  I love this recipe because the basic recipe has such a strong butterscotch taste, not caramel.  I believe it is better suited to a brownie or cookie than a cake because it does stiffen so quickly.  But that taste just rocks.

So...if you drop in a handful of semi-sweet choc chips and follow the rest o the recipe, you will have made fudge.  I kept the milk out and kept adding a splash, mixing furiously, add another splash, mix like hell... and another splash- ok now I have icing. But I was too chicken to ruin my gorgeous black forest cake so I only iced one half.  The rest of the icing went into a small container. Whatever clung to the spoon went into my belly! (With a sprinkle of kosher salt. it's a sickness...)

Perfect on the "Deep Dish Brownies" on this site.  Fudgy-like.  It firmed up fairly quickly, therefore made it easy to spread, and not drip off the brownies.  I actually found myself scooping up spoonfuls of it up, and eating it.  Sinfully good!

my husband has been talking about his aunts "hard chocolate frosting" forever.  well this is the closest we've ever come. I think it needs a lot more chocolate powder, at least double what the recipe calls for.

Kudos for the creativity...but this recipe falls short! I felt the texture was completely off and far too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and simply put...WAY to much work for a lack luster icing!!!

This icing was fantastic!  I had many people say it was the best they had ever tasted.  I added in 1/2 C. of semi-sweet chocolate chips like others had done. It had a great chocolate taste even though I had a few lumps of powder sugar.  I will mix if faster and add a little more milk next time.

This has a nice texture, but it is sooo sweet and brown sugary. Also, I absolutely think it lacks chocolate flavor - my guess is that it needs at least twice as much cocoa. Nice start, but needs lots of refinement. :)

DELICIOUS!  My nephew helped me put it together...before I could get to him, he had boiled the living daylights out of it.  It was practically fudge when we took it off the stove.  I added a bit of milk and restirred...perfect!

The consistency was nice, but the taste....  All I could taste was the brown sugar.  I couldn't even taste the chocolate.  Even my sweet toothed children didn't like it.

Like the taste, but it does set up VERY fast - next time I would follow the suggestion to make it in to batches, it was very difficult to work with.  I'd also cut back on the vanilla just a touch, but perhaps it didn't mix well in to it because it was already setting up.  Will try it again though.

Just found out you have to take a dessert somewhere in an hour.  No problem, pop a box mix in the oven and make this icing.  You'll get rave reviews!!!  It does set up VERY fast, but if you don't cool your cake all the way, you have a little more time.  I real keeper in my book!

One person said that it was too rich well it says "Rich chocolate fudge icing." So if you do not like sweet things then it is not for you. I REALLY LIKE THIS RECIPE.I put the icing on brownies! It is REALLY good.

OH MY Heaven in a bowl.  Got great reviews for my cupcakes this year.  Enough for 24 cupcakes, but the only this is it hardens fast, so you have to sprinkle sprinkles on each individual cake when done icing if you want to get them to stick.  I even licked the bowl after I was done.  Will be my ONLY icing recipe I will use.

The icing was very thick, even after i added an extra teaspoon of milk.  Definatly look like and has the consistancy of fudge. Taste was not as chocolatey as one would think. Not the best chocolate icing I've had, would reccomend looking for another recipe before trying this one.
3 out of 5 stars.

Good and easy to make. This recipe worked well for me. I did add more cocoa, 2 tbsp more, than the recipe asked for. It is excellent for brownies, it does set very quickly.

made again with the same results. I used it as brownie icing. It does have a mapley flavour from the brown sugar and it is fudgey, I really like it.

This a very good icing and easy to make.  I added 1 tbsp of cocoa and spread it over warm cake.  It was easy to spread and I put pecans on top.  My family loved it.  I will make it again.

Icing Too sweet. Sets too fast, you don't even have time to ice the sides before the icing starts to pull the cake apart. Will Never use this recipe again.

My confectioners' sugar didn't blend completely. There were clumps I couldn't see until the icing was on the cake. It didn't have much of a chocolate flavor and was more like a glaze. However the taste was not bad.

This icing is very delicious.  It is very sweet and is good to use to sweetening up any dessert dish.  I made it with a chocolate cake and am thinking about trying a different icing next time.  I would have to agree it would go great on a cookie maybe with some coffee (and I'm not even a coffee drinker).

This icing is just great and easy to make.  You do have to work quickly as it sets fast.  I used it on devils cupcakes with cream made from scratch and used a spatula to spread the icing on the cakes.  They were gone in a flash!

I followed suggestions that others made and this frosting turned out to be pretty good on éclairs.  I doubled the cocoa powder and changed the brown sugar to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2, and as I added the powdered sugar mixture I added enough milk to keep the consistency right.  It does stiffen up pretty fast, but that's perfect for éclairs because it keeps the frosting from running.

The icing was alright. Not my favorite. I would not add confectioners sugar in the future instead I should have added powdered sugar. It was full of the sugar that I tasted than the icing itself.

Absolutely wonderful. Took Triffens advice and added cayenne pepper to choclate it was about 1 tsp and it enhanced the chocolate. Doubled up on milk and confection powder added about 1 cup of brown sugar. Brought mixture to a slight boil and kept stirring poured onto cake and the plate beneath the cake caught remaining icing. Will make again always. Thank you guys!

Many of these comments are right on. There is not really enough icing to make a cake, it is not chocolaty enough, and it sets quickly.  I would not use it for a cake (though if you were fast enough, I think it would be good). I used it to ice some pumpkin cookies (it would also be good for iced doughnuts).  I made the following modifications. Instead of some of the milk I added creme de cocoa (liquor), cayenne pepper (the aztecs were geniuses with chocolate), some pepper (it played well with the pumpkin cookies, and honey instead of sugar (mmmm...honey).  It turned out well. Was relatively happy.

First the positives- the icing did taste good and was a nice compliment to the yellow cake I made. I did, however, give it a low rating for several reasons. First, the name is deceiving- it does have a hint of chocolate taste to it, but it's far closer to caramel. Additionally, the recipe needs to be instantly doubled to actually cover a cake (round or sheet). Finally, it is wildy difficult to ice a cake with- you have to have it nearly harden before you can even work with it. The consistency was close to that of a soup when I finished making it. Safe to say this is best used on brownies- skip it for a cake.

I really was not fond of this recipe at all.  I followed the recipe, but my icing did not taste chocolatey in any way.  It tasted more like a very sweet maple icing.

This icing reminded me of the chocolate icing you find on bakery doughnuts.  Yummy!  I actually used it to frost home made doughnuts so I made it in advance.  Reheating helped it spread easier.

This icing is WONDERFUL! All though I had to double the batch. One batch only covered half the cake. It does set up really quick too. I left in on the stove and heated it up when it started to set up. I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, it gave it a really chocolaty taste! Thank you for this recipe! :]

I made this for my chocolate cupcakes. I found it too sweet & brown sugary for my taste. Also, sets and gets a little harder than I would like.  I also made the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting, and we absolutely loved that! If I make this chocolate icing again, I will reduce the brown sugar by about 1/3 to 1/2.

Very good. Tastes great and is easy to make. Beware, it does cool very quickly so this isn't good for cookies of cupcakes, but rather it is perfect for something quick to ice, like cake.

Great icing! Quick to make up. Tastes wonderful on a simple white/yellow cake. Make sure to spread quickly, though. Once it starts to set, it hardens rapidly.

Very easy to make.  I agree with the other reviews that suggested you add more of the cocoa than what the recipe calls for.  It wasn't as "chocolatey" as I thought it would be.  I will make it again!

This icing is delicious. I think it tastes a lot like the icing on top of chocolate doughnuts. The only problem I have with it is that it is hard to spread, but adding extra milk helps.

I made this and followed all directions precisely... what a disaster! It sets up so quickly I didn’t have time to spread it on the cake, the texture was grainy and more like a glaze than a nice creamy frosting. The taste was so undesirable as well. Won’t be making this one again. I posted a picture so just go look at the lumpiest bunt cake one!

I ran out of Unsweetened Cocoa, so used about 3 Tblsp. of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup, in the can.  It did not come out very dark, and I think it needed more chocolate. :)

This tasted very delicious, however it is definitely more of a brownie type of icing.  Hardens massively fast!!!!

I've made boiled icing before, but without the brown sugar.  Very tasty, but extra milk is needed as other reviewers have indicated..  I was icing a sheet cake and you really need to work fast as the recipe states as the icing hardens very fast.

Tastes great! But this recipe left me a bit short to ice a double layer chocolate cake. If you’re doing that I’d recommend 1.5x this recipe.

The brown sugar gives it a different flavor than you would expect in a chocolate frosting.  Very good though.  The trick is to add another tablespoon or so of milk so it spreads more like a glaze and get it on your cake before it's cooled.  It has a beautiful shine to it.

Absolutely wonderful! On the advise of previous reviews, I used an extra T of milk and cocoa and tossed in a handful of dark chocolate chips. My daughter does not usually eat icing but she loved this on top of the cake she made. Thanks to the submitter and reviewers! I will never buy pre-made icing again. Ever.

After reading the reviews, I went ahead and used less brown sugar and more milk and it turned out magnificient!  It didn't even get hard like many others commented it did.  I'm not a huge white cake fan but I had a mix and used it so the icing made it wonderful!

It is worth mentioning that while you can use margarine, you cannot use butter flavored Crisco. This is a delicious Recipe. I used it on a Devil’s food sheet cake.  Chocolate overload.  Added a little more chocolate and a liiiiittle more milk.  Perfect.

I don't understand what this recipe is. I would hope that this recipe is meant to be a glaze versus an icing. Though chocolate chips can be added to make it smooth it won't make it an icing in the slightest. I'll agree that's it's tasty and (if not paying attention to detail) chocolaty. But to keep from miss leading the public.....this recipe is a glaze and not an icing.

Really good favor, using the brown sugar, never did that before with icing. Just warmed the butter and brown sugar to melt it, added a little more milk. That way it didn't set to fast. Added some mini chocolate chips because I had them on hand, added a nice touch. Will make again for sure. It's a keeper.

Although it was a very simple recipe, I didn't care for the taste of this icing, it was too maple and not at all chocolate flavor even though I added extra Belgium coco. The consistency was good however. I wouldn't make this again.

Tastes great. Very thick, but wonderful. If spread over a warm cake it spreads more easily, but sets as the cake cools. Love the idea of adding chocolate morsels! Will have to try that

Made it for my wife's birthday cake, and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe for each layer of the cake, and added a little more milk than the recipe called for because some reviews complained of difficulty spreading. It came out perfect! Will certainly use this again.

I chose this recipe to use for some brownies that I made for my Valentine's. It was super easy and quite good. Very sweet but you can gather that just by reading the ingredient list. Worked perfect for my needs. I will use it again. Thank you for sharing.

Very good but a little on the gritty side.  Needs an extra topping like decorating sugar or white chocolate.  Easy to make but definitely needed that extra 1/2 cup o` chocolate chips.  Milk chocolate is better than semi sweet for this.  I added a 1/2 tablespoon of milk right before spreading and that seemed to work.  Will try again to perfect recipe.

This is a good icing for cupcakes that need to be transported. (I made it for a school party). It sets to a very firm fudge like consistency. Not as messy as a typical frosting. The taste is a very sweet milk chocolate. (Maybe too sweet for some). I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder to mine to counter this a little.

This was a wonderful recipe. I made one change however, I used dark brown sugar, and 3 tbls of cocoa, much more chocolaty. Of course I had to add a little more milk. Hint, this should be just barely pourable when finished. Thanks for the great recipe. I used it on brownies, as well as a zuchinni chocolate  layer cake.

More like a fudge icing. Good but very sweet.

Easy, peasy. Quick and very tasty. Does have more of glaze like consistency and does set up quickly. Still, a very nice quick icing recipe.

I made this vegan, using vegan margarine and almond milk.  It was delicious.  I added 1 oz. semisweet chocolate to the butter and brown sugar, and used 3 tbs almond milk.  Perfect consistency for cupcakes.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I expect an icing to be pourable and although others said it set up quickly, I expected it to do that when I poured it over the cake.  It is not that consisitency at all and I will not be making this one again.

This icing is perfect to use with a pound cake... such as the marble pound cake found on this web site.  Perfect!

This recipe didn't at all taste like chocolate icing to me, I think it probably needs more cocoa and less brown sugar and butter. I probably won't make it again.

While this tastes great - it sets way too fast!  Will most likely go for another recipe next time or just buy the packaged stuff!
