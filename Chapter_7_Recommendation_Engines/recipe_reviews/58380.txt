This soup is awesome.  I'm not too crazy about oysters, so I used shrimp instead!!  Also, I sauteed the shrimp beforehand in butter and seaasonings.  I will be making this again soon!!

I was not all that impressed with this receipe.  Ther is no mention of rinsing the oysters to get rid of that grainy taste.  There are no seasonings mentioned, so if you don't add your own, than bland city.  I think the reciepe called for too much cream also, and the cream tastes very 'raw' or uncooked.  It seems it should be added sooner to give it time to blend with the veggies and oysters.  
I'm a huge oyster fan, and this just didn't do it for me.

This was very good, but I used a pint of oysters and the the water the oysters came in and added the water from the can of artichokes.  Adding these gives it more oyster and artichoke flavor.  I also added basil, bay leaf, salt, pepper and a little Cajun seasoning.  It was better after adding these seasonings.

This sounded strange, but because I had oysters and artichokes I tried it.  Everyone enjoyed it.
