This is such a wonderful recipe.  I made it at the last minute to bring to an impromptu Memorial Day get together and everyone kept complimenting me on it.  I used one pkg. of chocolate pudding and one pkg. of chocolate fudge pudding, and I also used an oreo ready crust to up the chocolate.  I added chocolate sprinkles to the top and it looked like chocolate silk pie from a restaurant.  I can't wait to use different variations of this recipe, thanks for the recipe Ready Crust!!

This recipe is great.  The pie turns out thick and creamy, just the way it looks.  It doesn't even have to set! TIP: MIX MILK AND WHIPPED TOPPING FIRST, THEN POUR IN THE PUDDING MIX OR YOUR PIE WILL BE LUMPY!

The pudding never set in the fridge.  Followed directions exactly as written.  Maybe the pudding should be prepared first as opposed to just mixing it in powdered form with other ingredients.  Not sure.  Anyway, I did manage to save it by putting it in the freezer for a few hours then serving immediately.  Won't try this one again though.
