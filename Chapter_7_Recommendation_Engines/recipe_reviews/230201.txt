I'm familiar with baked fruits for dessert, and am normally a HUGE advocator for butter, but the butter just sat inside the pear as it baked, and when I took it out, it splashed everywhere, and ran out all over the place when I cut it, mixing with the ice cream.  The amount of cinnamon was quite a lot compared to the small amount of pear flesh that was leftover after I was done scooping out the insides, and if I made this again, I would combine all the ingredients together (after melting the butter) and then just drizzle over the pears in the dish.  Maybe even cut whole pears up in slices beforehand to minimize the waste from digging through the top to get to the seeds in the center.  For people not used to eating fruit, this might be a way to get them to eat it, but it's definitely not healthy nor indulgent, and the ratio of butter/sugar/spice to fruit was just way, way off for me.  :(

This was ok, but nothing special. I used oil rather than margarine, but once I tasted the pears, I felt it didn't really need it - a spritz of oil spray would have done the trick. The maple syrup gives the pears a nice flavor, but combined with the brown sugar, it's awfully sweet.

Not being a big fan of pears I was a little skeptical that I would like these, but I did.  I added extra cinnamon, because I really like cinnamon and then I took the liquid that was produced while cooking and drizzled http over the pears.

Made this ages ago while a kiddo, could not remember exact details. I was thrilled to find this and bake up a fresh pear, tasted just as I remembered.  :) I cannot use cinnamon so opted out. Did mash up the pears to made it like a pearsauce, like applesauce so all of the flavors melded together, was Simply Wonderful.

I used home grown Asian pears. Recommend less butter and partially skinning the pears if they have even a slightly tough skin, it will reduce the bitterness

I love pears, but didn't have large ones, so I used smaller ones and cut them in half.  oh so yummy!  They were perfect,  and I ate mine before taking a picture,  so had to take another.   lol.

There are too many other good baked pear recipes. This one is not one of them. No wonder people change the recipe to their taste. The best thing about this recipe was the ice cream.
