We thought the bisque was delicious.  The only change I made was not to add any salt. When I make it again, I would use half the amount of onions and celery and sauté them in the butter before adding the flour.  In addition, to lighten up the recipe and get more of that lobster flavor, I would add half the amount of cream to the flour and compensate by using more lobster stock.  We enjoyed this very much.

Easy and delicious! I've made this twice now using Deb C suggestion of sautéing the onions, celery and carrots first. My husband and friend loved it and were fighting over seconds!

I Buy two whole lobsters and save the cooking water and reduce it to make the sauce. After preparing the meat put the shells back in the stock and simmer a while for a more favorful stock then drain via a colander  to remove the shells. Two lobsers of a pound more more is all the meat you need. I also add a tab of butter and use cream instead of half and half but both work well, I toss in the top greens from my celery to also add flavor and remove them before serving. Do not leave the Tamale in the lobster shells when making the stock or the stock will have a green hue. (harmless)
