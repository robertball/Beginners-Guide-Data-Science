I love this recipe!  It says to let it stand for 2 weeks but I added a little more lemon and just a bit of honey and let it stand for 6  weeks.  The flavor was INCREDIBLE!  I love the way it looks in my kitchen too.  I store it in a decorative bottle right on my counter!  Absolutely a keeper!

This isn't quite as flavorful as I hoped it would be, but it is still very good. I sprinkled it over some sliced cantaloupe for breakfast this morning. Delicious!

I make alot of flavored oils and vinegars, but this one didn't really do much for me.
