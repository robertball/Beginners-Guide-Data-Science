We love this recipe.  It's a staple during football season.  I tend to use velveeta, and I use canned diced tomatoes and chilies together.  It is perfect.  YUM!

Used velveeta, rotel with tomatoes and green chilis, and Chunky brand chili with no beans.  Got rave reviews!

I make this recipe with a block of low fat cream cheese instead of processed cheese. Comes out great and is a huge hit at my house!

Pretty much anytime I make chili cheese dip, which is fairly often, this is the way I make it! The only differences are that I use chili with beans (personal preference), and heat it in my mini slow cooker instead of a saucepan or fondue pot. Sometimes if I don't have the green chilis on hand I'll add in some salsa. This is soooo yummy and couldn't be simplier! :)

quicker version-use Cheez Whiz  then you dont have to spend time melting cheese just mix together and put in a microwave safe dish to heat.  This works great as left over or if you dont have alot to feed....after mixing together before heating just put what you want in a small bowl and heat- refrigerate leftovers.

I used cheddar cheese instead of American only because that was what I had on hand. HUGE hit with the boys. They inhaled it in less than a half hour. I threw all the ingredients for this into my little crockpot and let it go while we ran our errands this morning. Great way to use up an odd can of chili and a can of green chilies in my pantry and come up with a cheap dip for the boys.

Awesome!  My husband who doesn't like salsa (even cheese salsa) because it's too spicy, loved this recipe!  It also made a lot more than I expected.  Definitely enough for a party without doubling the recipe.

I've made a dip similar to this for years, except I had 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger, Hormel chili with beans, a small can of Campbells tomato juice, onion, green chilies, and occasionally will add some diced tomatoes. Velveeta makes this so cheesy and creamy. This dip is fantastic and is the first thing gone at potlucks.
