I have been making this dish for years and the key is to use a 9x13 baking dish instead of the pie plate. We sometimes use pizza cheese too instead of just the cheddar.

Great and easy, too!  I have made this quite a few times, and I have some adjustments that I now prefer to make each time.  I chop an entire onion and saute it first in 1/2 Tbl. butter, along with 1 tsp. minced garlic (the onions don't cook well enough for me otherwise, and garlic adds nice flavor), then add them to the mixture.  I lower the fat a bit by using only 2 cups of cheese (none really needs to be sprinkled on top) - another note - skim milk works well in this recipe.  Be sure and thaw (then drain) the broccoli well, or there will be too much liquid in the pie.  I also add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the mixture before pouring into the pie plate.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was very good, although I made a few modifications.  To
bump up the healthiness of the recipe, I skipped the cheese on the top (there
is plenty of cheese cooked in), and I used whole-wheat baking mix.  Also, there
is no need to grease the pie pan.  This recipe does not stick to the pan.  I would
suggest adding pepper or some other spice to the ingredients, since it's just a
tad bland.  Also, as a note, the broccoli does not have to be thawed completely
before you bake this.  Just put the frozen broccoli in the microwave on "thaw"
while you are stirring the batter, and it will be plenty thawed by the time you
are ready for it.  As a final note, you might want to try cooking this on the
stovetop, for a quicker cooking time.  Just put enough of the mixture in the
frying pan to cover the bottom, and cook kind of like a pancake.

Even my boyfriend, who's not a broccoli fan, enjoyed this dish. I used fresh broccoli and sauteed it first with the onion. I used skim milk and only one cup of cheddar to make the dish healthier.

Loved it!  I used a 9X13 so should have reduced the baking time-a tad scorched.  Will add some spices (pepper, garlic?)

This was really good! It is a great, simple recipe that my 7 and 3 year old LOVE! I did saute the onions in a little butter and added a little garlic, crushed red pepper, parsley and italian seasoning. Then added that mixture to the broccoli mixture- but besides that I followed the recipe. Thanks you for a great recipe!

My changes: first, I used a 9" square pan and cooking spray.  Since it's a fat-fest anyway, cook 4-6 slices of bacon until crispy and crumble. I used a full cup of coarsely chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic (there can never be too much garlic) - sauteed in bacon drippings until onions are opaque.  Add a hefty couple pinches of red pepper flakes.  I cut the cheddar in half and substituted Mexican Cotija because this recipe NEEDS salt.  Plus a couple generous pinches of coarse ground black pepper.

It took about 5 minutes longer to cook.  More Cotija went on top for browning.  Turned out flavorful and awesome.  Good for breakfast the next day!

This could be great, but needs a little work. Next time, I will sauté the onions first and add more seasoning. Also, I cooked it for 40 minutes and it was not enough. Next time, I might make it a bit smaller and add a bit less milk. Potatoes and sautéed mushrooms would have been a nice addition. This is a great base for many combinations. Can’t wait to try it again.

Turned out delish, but definitely would suggest a longer cooking time at a lower temp.  Probably 45 mins at 375 would do it.  I also omitted the third cup of cheese, sauteed the onions w/some garlic, and added some salt and pepper.  I will make this again.

This was delish. I also sauteed fresh broccoli with onions and garlic and tossed in a little spinach as well.  I seasoned it up with salt, cracked pepper and crushed red pepper.  I cooked it in a 9X13, which increased the crust capacity. I also substituted some of the cheese for cottage cheese and used less cheese.  Good stuff.
This pie would be a great breakfast dish also as it's somewhat quiche-like.

Better if you substitute mozzarella for the cheddar and add 1/2 cup romano cheese.  Tastes better then the cheddar.

Great recipe, but it took almost an hour to cook.  The only adjustment I had was ommitting some of the broccoli, because 20 oz. seemed like too much.  I will keep this recipe for the future.

This recipe was okay. Next time I will add more seasonings, more baking mix and per my husband bacon.  I would also add more broccoli since I made this recipe to use up some broccoli from the garden.

Whoever said this dish doesn't have to be greased prior apparently uses magic dishes.  I didn't grease and had to soak the glass dish.  This was good but I added salt and pepper to taste.  Be sure and really get the baking mix, milk, and eggs mixed well.  I must not have been paying attention and there was a tiny patch that looked just like scrambled egg.  I also used broccoli pieces that were a bit large; I'll be sure to use bite-sized pieces next time.  I was so surprised that my girls liked this; my youngest detests broccoli and said she loved it!  I will definitely be making it again; then I'll grease the dish.  ;)

Rather tasteless as written.  Used fresh broccoli and added mushrooms, shredded potatoes, garlic and seasonings.  Might benefit from a bruschetta topping.

It came out watery. The broccoli wasn't completely thawed, so that may be why.  My daughter gagged.  Since I made it for her, I guess it won't stay in the recipe box

I too added salt and pepper.  I also used fresh broccloi which I blanched and chopped the flowerets. I also baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I don't usually include so many changes when rating a recipe but upon reading the other comments... We really enjoyed the recipe with these changes.

This was only just okay. I think, overall, the problem was that even though I dried my broccoli as was suggested, the pie was overall too wet for me when it was done. Also, it was a bit bland, even with plenty of black pepper and some Worcestershire sauce--maybe it needed salt instead of Worcestershire? I don't know. I will only make it again if I find myself with way too much broccoli & cheese on my hands.

Gave this a 5 star review even though I just put it in the oven.  I will change it later, if I don't agree. Used this as a base recipe.  I sauteed the broc. with onions and butter AND added in cauliflower,  bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Tastes great out of the saute pan. Easy.  Smells great.  serving with grilled pork chops.

This tasted good! I did add potatoes, garlic and pepper to this recipe. I cooked the potatoes with the onions and garlic to soften them enough before adding with all other ingredients. The family loved it as well. I also omitted sprinkling cheese on top as there is plenty inside it. In the future I may add other ingredients as there are so may possibilities.

I added left over steak (cut into small pieces), mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, squash) in place of just the broccoli.  A great way to make a tasty dinner out of leftovers!

I made this recipe GLUTEN FREE by replacing the baking mix with 3/4 cup GF bread crumbs and my marathon running husband who needs carbs and hates anything GF loved it.  I sautéed the onion, some baby portabello mushrooms, and some garlic salt first and put it into the pan, then added the mixture of milk, egg, and breadcrumbs.  Mistake.  Not enough of the egg mixture to cover the pan, and when I mixed it IN the pan it messed up my nonstick mojo (I had buttered the 9x13 dish.)  Next time I will mix it all first as directed OR I will use little bread cubes with my favorite gluten free bread, then pour the thinner mixture that is missing the breadcrumbs over the cubes and let it soak overnight before cooking.  Last night I was in a must cook now and eat now situation.  My husband used tabasco sauce, I wish I would have spent a little more time adding spices, or the tomato on top as suggested.  I was grateful to find this recipe late last night and will make it again with many variations.

This was delicious!  Because we had a ton of fresh tomatoes from our garden, towards the end of baking I layered thin-sliced tomatoes on top and then some parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make it again with or without the tomato!

I needed to use up some fresh broccoli and this recipe was perfect for it.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used a 13x9 pan, added salt, pepper and some crushed red pepper.  Since we are suffering from fresh garden tomato overload, I also sliced tomato and laid it on the top before baking.  Definitely a winner in our house!

The recipe isn't bad, but I wish I would have thought to add salt and pepper before cooking. It really needed some salt. Also, I think I will try red onions next time, instead of a regular onion.

Loved this recipe!  Pardon the pun, but it was easy as pie to make!  While I did not do it this time, I could see how adding either ground beef or italian sausage would make a great dish too.

We liked this recipe. It was easy to make but I did follow the other suggestions and sauteed the onions with a little butter first. I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the egg mixture and only used 1 cup of cheese, which was plenty. I used fresh broccoli florets because I had them in the fridge and just cooked them a little in the microwave first. Will make again!

I will try adding pepper and garlic to this recipe the next time, just needed a little more spice.  Also, I used fresh Broccoli which was very good, but I will try the idea of suateing the onion and Broccoli.

This is a GREAT weekday meal! I add sea salt & fresh ground pepper. I used dehydrated minced onion & lowfat baking mix. It came out great! It was super easy and all 3 of my sons ate it up!
