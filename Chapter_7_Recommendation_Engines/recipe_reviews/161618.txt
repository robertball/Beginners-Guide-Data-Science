Browning is a liquid that comes in a small bottle. The most common brand that I am aware of is "Kitchen Bouquet". It is used to give a little extra flavour and a nice brown color to the rice.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was delish!!! I made a few changes. I used one 15 ounce of corn which was plenty. I also added a few stalks of skellion while the liquid was simmering, just a few minutes before adding the rice. Lastly, I used Jasmine rice which is so much more flavorful. A true winner!!!!!!

I didn't have browning sauce, so I just used a concentrated beef flavoring--a bullion type thing, and it worked well enough.  I also didn't use tomato sauce but tossed in a can of drained chopped tomatoes instead.  I'm not a huge fan of rice, so keep that in mind, but this wasn't too bad.  The flavors worked well and it goes well with chopped chicken to make it a full meal.  This does make a lot of rice, though--so make sure you like rice or have enough people to consume it if you make the full batch.  There is way more than 5 servings in this recipe!  All in all, not bad, and hubby seems to like it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe, and it makes a huge serving. It reminds me somewhat of Mexican red rice.

Loved the rice, added 2 more slices of bacon and left onion out.  Used jasmine rice and chicken stock.  Modified slightly- 1 cup rice, 2 cups chicken stock and 1 can f stock.  a big hit,  Very yummy!.

I loved it!  The rest of my family thought it had too much spice in it (pepper and thyme), but they like bland food.

Be forewarned, this will feed an army!  That's ok, I'm having it as left-overs for lunch today :)

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was delicious.

I make this to save money, never knew others did as well and did not know it was Bahamian.  I do it a tadge different each time, depending on what I have.  I usually use an entire large onion, whole green bell pepper, at least one 8 oz can of tomato sauce and sometimes another can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano.  I love tomatoes and the veggies, but not a huge fan of rice, so I use only 1 cup of rice.... and just drain the liquids and add enough water or stock OR water and a bouillon cube to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid.  And beans of any kind are good in this too.  I am sure it is okay to personalize this... most folks do, less they don't have cooking experience.  As is, this recipe is great.

I really like the flavors that came together, easy and cheap. I like making this with my fish meals.

Just finished making this and it's amazing! I didn't have pepper flakes or browning sauce and didn't wanna go to the store so I substituted pepper flakes for cayenne pepper and browning sauce for beef flavored bouillon.  It tasted really good. Will definitely make again but this time buy all the ingredients needed for it and review it again. Thanks! :-)

I found this very true to the rice dishes we've had in Jamaica.   In particular, this was almost identical to the rice served at Floyd's Pelican Bar (he used beans instead of corn, but rice was same).   The authentic taste is what I was after, but I do like it with a little more zip.   I will probably make again, but may add in some extra spicy peppers of some sort.   Thank you for a great recipe.
