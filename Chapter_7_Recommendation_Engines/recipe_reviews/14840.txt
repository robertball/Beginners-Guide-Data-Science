I made this for a party months ago, and everytime I get together with the people I made it for, they request this chicken!  It is different than any chicken recipe I have, and it really gets a lot of compliments. I have baked it in the oven too and it turns out great.

This is an amazing recipe!  While you prepare it you wouldn't believe it would turn out as good as it does.  Nice and spicey and well worth any effort it takes cooking it.  Definitely broil or grill it.

I used the advice of CARADMBGRL and made a version of cheesecake factory's thai chicken linguine. It was delicious. The whole family loved including my parents and my two year old. I dut down on the salsa and cayenne pepper a tad since my mom doesn't like spicy, but otherwise went by her instructions. I chopped up the chicken and sauteed it in a skillet on the stove with about a TBSP. of veg. oil. We julienned some carrots tossed those in with the chicken also. While the chicken was cooking I made the sauce but left out the salt as she had recommended. When my chicken was done I just added the sauce to the chicken and warmed it and added some bean sprouts. We cooked some spinach fettucine and tossed that with it and it was done. An easy thirty minute meal that was healthy and not your typical dish. We will definitely make this again.

I must say, when I mixed up this marinade, I had serious doubts. It was very chunky. I was afaid that I was consigning my chicken to the trash. I was wrong. It was excellent. The only request I have gotten, is that next time I should make the strips thinner. My 5 year old came back for more, not that she's picky, but she saw the marinade, too. This one will be on the menu again!

These are SOOOO good!  Made them for the first night of a vacation getaway for 3 families--everyone from age 6 to 60 loved them!  I would have had seconds but they disappeared too quickly!  I let marinate as long as possible--at least overnight.  Make sure your bamboo skewers soak at least a couple of hours in cold water so they won't burn on the grill.  This recipe is so good--quite an unusual bunch of ingredients, but somehow it all comes together to produce an awesomely unique flavor!

I love this recipe and so did everyone at my party. Mixing up the ingredients was kinda scary and gross it didn't look to good. My daughter was like I'm not eating that...but once everyone was raving about the chicken she tried it and loved it. Great recipe! Worth the effort! I grilled the skewers and came out great.

I have made this many times and it's always a hit.  I bake mine in the oven at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes (and therefore omit the green peppers).  I also reserve some of the peanut sauce prior to adding the chicken so that, after it's cooked, people can use it as a side dipping sauce if they'd like to.

Also, the most crucial step is letting the chicken marinade in the sauce overnight.  Otherwise the flavor doesn't turn out nearly as nice!

If you have ever had the Thai Chicken Linguini at California Pizza Kitchen or the Cheesecake Factory, you will love this idea. Instead of marinating and grilling the chicken, saute it in a skillet. Add veggies such as carrots, peppers, and broccoli if you like. Mix the sauce ingredients, ommitting the salt. When the chicken is cooked, add the sauce to the skillet and cook until hot. Don't leave the sauce in there too long or it will thicken too much. Serve over linguini. My boyfriend absolutely loves this and requests it all the time. Tastes just like the dish at our favorite restaurants. Enjoy!

Loved it!  I made the marinade without the salt and when I tasted it, it didnt seem to need the salt so I left it out.  I marinated chicken breasts and grilled them.  I added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and 1 1/2 cups of water to the marinade after removing the chicken and I boiled it down to the original consistency and I served this as a dipping sauce.  The chicken was wonderful with and without the sauce.  I will be making this often!

The preparation for this recipe was easy, and most of the marinade items were in my cupboard.
The stringing the chicken on the skewers was a little messy, but definitely worth the mess. 
I prepared the marinade and chicken 48 hours ahead of time and placed in gallon zip bag a for a camping trip, and WOW; rave reviews!!! Just the right amount of spice.

These were great!  Make sure you let them marinate a few hours, 1 day is best.  The chicken will pick up the wonderful flavors.  Also, I skipped the skewers and bell peppers and served the grilled chicken over rice.

These were ok.  Definitely cut the marinade ingredients in half if you're only using 3 chicken breasts.  It makes enough for at least 6 breasts.  Also, these stuck to the grill, so we rolled up some tin foil into logs and put each end of the skewers on them so they didn't touch the grill.  They were pretty salty too, so I recommend using low sodium soy sauce and not using any additional salt at all.

WOW! I have never grilled anything on a skewer before until today. I marinated the meat overnight and it gave it great flavor. At first I was a little frightened by the ingredients but trust me..it's awesome. My picky husband loves these and has asked me to make them again.

When my husband and I were first mixing the ingredients for this recipe, we debated whether or not to continue as it seemed like an odd combination of ingredients. I'm incredibly glad we decided to continue as the chicken skewers turned out to be delicious! I left out the cilantro as I did not have any on hand and used a white onion instead of green onion. The result was an incredibly wonderful marinade! One last note, I only used half of the mixture for a marinade and used the other half for a sauce which I poured over white rice and also used for dipping the skewers in. Thank you for the terrific recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Don't be afraid of the weird combo of ingredients...you won't believe how good the end product is!  I usually only make HALF the marinade and it is plenty (in the past I have felt bad about how much goes to "waste" when you chunk that big bag full of PB etc).  I do agree that the threading of the chicken is messy and slippery, but if you just cube the chicken instead and alternate chicken cubes and bell pepper cubes, it's not so much like fighting with a slippery eel!

I only had creamy pb - and used about 3/4 c based on other reviews.  It seemed to be PLENTY -- maybe just a bit too much.  Didn't have cilantro, which is a bummer cuz we love it -- but made the rest as written and it made for some mildly tasty, tender chicken skewers on the barbie.  We prefer something more flavorful...but since we didn't have the cilantro -- I'm guessing that may just be the key.  I might try again -- but only with less PB, add the cilantro and possibly some extra cayenne and garlic.

This is so good! I served it to about 55 guests over the weekend, and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. I let it marinade for about 24 hours. The only modifications I made were cutting the Cayenne in half and substituting the other half with Paprika (I was nervous that it might be too spicy),  cut back on the salt a little – it just seemed like too much and used the lower sodium soy sauce. This recipe is defiantly a keeper - don’t let the diverse list of ingredients keep you from trying it. It is so tender and delicious!!!

I was nervous about this, since the ingredients seem *so* odd, but made it based on the other reviews.  I'm so glad I did!!!  I made them for Memorial Day, and everyone LOVED them.  I followed the directions exactly, but I pureed the ingredients in the blender - turned out great.  I cut up about 9 chicken breasts to marinate, so I doubled the marinade.  This made a TON, so next time I wouldn't double it, even when using that much chicken.  Excellent, excellent recipe.

The combination of ingredients struck me as odd, and the finished product tasted odd to me. Did like the peppers and pineapple. Would have been better with a dipping sauce.  Won't make it again.   I prefer the chicken satay recipe.

I must say that I had my doubts when
I read all the ingredients in that marinade. My marinade came out very thick...almost like a paste. 

The taste, though, was amazing. I didn't bother putting them on the skewers since I was doing it for a party of 70 and didn't have enough time.
I did chop up green peppers and sprinkled them on top before broilling.
Excellent recipe and would definitely
serve again!

Really great tasting satay like chicken.  My brother told me it was one of his favorite things I make.  I use chicken tenders instead, no cutting!

My whole family devoured this dish.  While marinating, it is very scary looking but once it is cooked and on your plate the look is appealing.  But the taste is what is best of all and I only marinated for about 3 hours.  I can only imagine how good it will taste the next time when I let it sit for a couple more hours.  I also thought there was too much marinade, next time I will half the marinade.

"It's different..." is all my fiance could say. Not great. I followed the recipe exactly as written, so it wasn't any substitutions or changes I made.

I've made this recipe a few times, always with smooth peanut butter because that's what I had on hand.  This past time I made it with chunky peanut butter, but I think I prefer the smooth.  Also, for the first time I had an opportunity to grill it rather than broil, and strangely I prefered the chicken broiled in the over.  Go figure.  Great recipe overall, the sauce is delicious and I always save some on the side for dipping.  The only thing I alter is the amount of cilantro I use, I prefer just a small amount as it can be a strong herb.

SOOO GOOD!! My guests couldn't stop commenting how good this was.  Who would of thought with all the crazy ingredients.  I made the marinade the night before and marinated my chicken in it all night(really makes for moist chicken).  The only subs were vidalia onion for the green onion, and I had no cayenne pepper so I used paprika with a few red pep flakes.  I also used lite soy sauce..The regular soy would make it way too salty. I strung chicken on the skewers with the pepper, pineapple chunks, and vidalia onion and my oh my..they were soo good.  Don't pass this up.

LOVED this recipe! I am not fortunate enough to have a functioning broiler or grill in my small apartment, but the chicken still came out great on a stove-top grill pan! I let the chicken marinate overnight so the flavor could really soak in, and used the "hot" La Victoria salsa (what I had on hand). Came out SUPER delicious with a little kick. This will definitely be put in the "keeper" recipe stack!

I have made this a few times for different people and have always had to supply the recipe. I only make half of the recipe at a time. Like everyone says, it looks strange while making it but it has a killer flavor! Very Thai!

Obviously the eclectic list of ingredients was a bit intimidating at first, but once I started I couldn't wait to find out how they tasted.  I made 50 or so for an engagement party, and they were gone in an hour.  The sauce was incredible - a perfect amalgamation of spice and flavor.  Unbelievable props to whoever first created this marinade.

These were pretty good!  I marinated the green peppers with the chicken.  I found that mine had a very strong peanut butter taste.  I suppose you could revise the proportions of the marinade to fit your tastes.

I swear I have made this before! There must be a similar recipe lurking on this website. I definitely liked it before. Still like it! I don't like cilantro though so I left that bit out and only had smooth peanut butter. Baked in the oven. Yummy!

Do delicious! I was skeptical on making this since the ingredient combination was different than I'm used to. But since I had most of it on had I gave it a shot! I had no green onion so I used a white onion and no salsa so I used a can of Rotel. Marinated for 24 hours and grilled. My family devoured every piece and asked to make it again. Thank you for sharing!

Not a fan of this combination of ingredients.  The peanut butter gave it an odd flavor that I didn't really care for.

We loved this, and it got 2 thumbs up from my kids!  I varied it a little because I made it last minute, so I used what I had.  I left out the cayenne, but used hot salsa, and the kids didn't complain.  I didn't have cilantro, but had parsley and mint in my garden and it made a nice variant.  I broiled the skewers and left off the bell peppers and served over rice.  Thanks for the recipe, we will use it again!

This reminded me of Kona's chicken satays - which I love. I think next time we might use a tad less peanut butter, as that was a bit overpowering. Otherwise, great recipe and we'll make it again. I think this would make a great appetizer for parties. Thanks for sharing.

At first bite I thought this wasn't really any big deal. I have a chicken satay recipe I love to use from here, but the more we ate it, the more we loved it. You don't need a peanut dipping sauce since it's already on the chicken. The only change I made was creamy instead of chunky PB because thats what we use, and I added only a touch of cayenne because I didn't want it too spicy for the kids (probably could have added a bit more). Thanks so much for this yummy recipe, its a keeper for us!

Great recipe but also try it with chicken thighs which are finer grained and stay moister than breast.

Very mixed reviews in our house.  I did not like at all as the taste was not to my liking but my eldest son and husband enjoyed.  Youngest said it was just ok.  Not sure if I would make again.

These were a little too tangy for me.  Would have preferred more of a peanut taste. This could have been due to me using smooth rather than crunchy peanut butter.  I broiled the chicken and it was very tender.  With some tweaking, may do this recipe again.

This was really good.  I added pineapple, onions and zucchini to my skewers.  I also cut the chicken into chunks to make the threading easier.  There was much more marinate than needed, i might cut it in half next time.

This is one of the strangest recipes I've made. The chicken had a decent taste but it was dry. I grill a lot of chicken and have never had it be this dry before. It was worth a shot but won't make again. Just too weird.

This recipe was pretty good, albeit unusual. I used quartered chicken pieces instead of chicken breast and set the oven to 375. The peanut butter was a bit overpowering, and I think I'm going to tone it down with salsa garnish. Maybe 3/4 PB would work instead of 1 cup.

Fast and delicious! 

I only tweaked two things:  
- First, I decided to use an immersible blender on the marinade because the peanut butter was difficult to get mixed in.  I think that also helped the chicken to have an equal opportunity to pick up more of the spiciness from the salsa.  In order to bring back the crunch of peanuts, I crunched up some dry-roasted peanuts to top the chicken at the end. 
- Secondly, I left the chicken in the marinade for an entire day.

The results were terrific!

Ok, let me start off by saying if I could give this 10 stars I would. It’s absolutely delicious!!! Instead of skewers or chicken breasts, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. They were perfect for the delicious marinade because of all the nooks and crannies they have. I bbqued them, and it only took about 20 minutes. We enjoyed them with a strawberry and spinach salad. I will make this recipe again and again! Did I mention my 2 year old approved?!

Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!  I used red peppers, because that's all I had.  Also used two cloves of garlic, as I didn't have any minced.  Also, I saw the pineapple in the picture and that looked yummy, so into the marinade I threw a can of organic pineapple chunks (poured out the pineapple juice beforehand). I skipped the brown sugar entirely, as we don't add sugar to our food unless it's dessert on dessert night (Sunday) - and we didn't miss it one bit. Also, before grilling, I parbaked the skewers in the oven on 300 for 30 mins. Overall, very delicious! Thank you, again!

By far our favorite recipe out of many recipes on this site. BUT, don’t add the salt. It conflicts or distracts from the peanut butter taste. My boys LOVE this recipe and ask for it all the time. I cut the breasts into small 1” cubes and bake the cubes in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 in all that wonderful sauce. Give it a good mix before serving and voila!!! Don’t forget the Cilantro! I have a medium sized bowl of cilantro so everyone can put as much as they want on their chicken!!! Enjoy!

Family loved them! I didn't use cilantro and didn't miss it. Pretty easy. Important to marinade for as long as possible.

Really good!  I used smooth peanut butter and it turned out great.  I to was worried about the taste based on the look of the marinade. The chicken was very tender and had a great taste. I'll be making this again.

I am rating this from the dish I made with changes below. I read and followed the suggestion of another reviewer (re: Thai Chicken Linguini), because it is way less labor-intensive than the skewers. I chose this recipe to use up a jar of chunky coconut peanut butter that was nearing expiration. I had to microwave the PB for 40 seconds to soften it and make it easier to mix with the rest of the ingredients. Used what I had in the pantry and substituted 1 can diced tomatoes with green chile instead of salsa(did not have any). Omitted salt (used lite soy sauce) and green bell pepper (didn't have any). Followed the rest of the ingredients to make the sauce. I sauteed the thinly sliced chicken breast, julienned carrots and broccoli in a wok before adding the sauce. We love spicy hot, so I added some cayenne powder, chili powder, red pepper flakes, hot sauce, more black pepper... I found that it took a lot more than the usual amount of spices to get the heat level up. My husband came to the rescue by adding some habanero sauce that finally took the heat level to (only) 4/10. Served over jasmine rice. We would make this again, but I might use French cut (fresh) green beans next time instead of broccoli. I think the broccoli's texture does not go with the rest of the dish. And if I was using creamy peanut butter, I would sprinkle crushed roasted peanuts on top.

The sauce is so tasty, I thought it was going to be spicy but it was just right. I served it with black beans and rice. The chicken was so delicious. I cant wait to make it again!
