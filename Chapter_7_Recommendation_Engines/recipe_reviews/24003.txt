I took the above two suggestions - browned the chicken without breading in a tiny bit of butter and doubled all the remaining ingredients for extra sauce (including cornstarch to thicken) - then I used chicken broth instead of water and added about 1/4 cup plain white vinegar for tang.  Doubled the raisins and left them whole.  Tossed in a coarsely chopped onion when I returned the chicken to simmer.  One drop red and two drops yellow food coloring stirred in really brought out the color.  Served it over lightly buttered white rice with the orange slice atop the chicken and a maraschino cherry half in the center of the orange slice.  Presentation was GORGEOUS and the taste is unbelievable.  You never taste the bourbon!  But it really lends flavor.  We ate the whole thing which should have been enough for two meals.  This has got to be just about my favorite dish!  And you never miss the fat.  DE-LISH!!!!

Pretty good - lightly flavored chicken recipe.  I hope I don't offend the photographer but PLEASE take that picture off, it looks like raw chicken and I almost passed this one up because of that.

Thanks for this recipe.  I cooked it for my family this evening and they all loved (except my daughter who didn't like the texture of the chicken!).  I loved it and will cook it again.  I served the chicken with roasted baby potatoes (which had been tossed in olive oil, rock salt and a mixture of french herbs) and Savoy cabbage (which I shredded and cooked quickly in about 1/2 inch of water with a knob of butter) - Delicious.

Sorry, I found this recipe to be quite bland.  Did add onion, mushroom, even garlic! The sauce had too much cornstarch, perhaps that was the problem.  Maybe a simple reduction method would have been able to create a more disticntive taste.

Delicious, easy and quick to prepare.  I substituted chicken broth for the water.  Next time I'll double the sauce.  Thanks.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe!  I am going to try it without the flour next time though and just saute the chicken and then simmer it in the sauce.

Recipe as printed is very bland.  It can be improved by increasing the sugar. Substitute Chicken stock for water. Reduce cornstarch.

I'm not sure what I made here, but it was not very good.  I do like similarly-named restaurant recipes, but this chicken's bourbon smell was overwhelming and the finished sauce was pungent yet tasteless.

This recipe sounded great but was absolutely flavorless.  We expected more of an orange tang, but it was blah.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated but substituted dried cranberries for the raisins--that actually added the only bit of flavor.

i used the ingredients as a starter, but prepaired it in a slightly different manner.......  my husband and 2 year old really like the flavor.   definitely serve over rice and not noodles--but if you must serve over noodles like i did, fresh grated parmesan cheese sprinkled along with the chicken is surprisinly pleasing to the palate for any of you foodies out there like me : )

I added the vinegar as stated below but I did the mistake of using the oranges with the skin on it which gave the chicken a bitter taste. Next time I'll try it without the skin and see how that works out. Still pretty good!

Easy and delicious!  This recipe can be a crowd pleaser if you double it.  The orange added just the right touch!
