The chicken came out very good. The problem some had with the milk curdling, I just slowly added the milk a little at a time (tempering) worked out very well.  Would make this again

I liked this dish, and am very happy to see new IP recipes. I wasn't sure about using the cinnamon stick, but added it anyway. It actually added a nice and very subtle flavor that I appreciated. The chicken was super moist and did indeed fall off the bone, making it easy to shred. However, if I were to make this again, I think I'd opt to use boneless skinless chicken pieces, (probably thighs), instead of a whole chicken. Dealing with all the bones seemed unnecessary. I would think the chicken would be best served over something like rice, mashed potatoes, or perhaps even pasta. Thanks for sharing Kati!

This made tasty, tender, melt in your mouth chicken. However, the sauce was a little weird. The milk curdled badly, and most of it stuck to the sides of the instant pot. Also, the recipe states two lemons, zested, so that's all I did. I found myself wishing I had put the juice in also, as the lemon flavor was too subtle. All the lemon zest was mainly lost on the chicken skin, which I discarded. I didn't taste the cinnamon stick, which was fine. Overall, I liked it.
