If I could give this one 10 stars I would. I served this at a baby shower that I hosted along w/ a chocolate & butterscotch fondue & no one touched the others until the cheese was gone. We were scraping the pan for every last drop. I didn't have any milk so I ended up subbing heavy whipping cream, which turned out great. We ate it w/ french bread, broccoli & red bell peppers. I also agree that this would make an amazing pasta sauce or white pizza sauce. No one left my shower w/o this recipe. It was the biggest hit there!

This was so yummy!! I made it for a potluck the night before and refrigerated it over night, and warmed it back up in the crock pot before serving. Turned out great.

I'm only giving this four stars, because I took the advice of a couple of other reviews and added 1/2 a cup of wine (or thereabouts, who actually measures??). I also think good quality parmesan is a must, buy a brick and grate it yourself...the end result is a smooth, rich absolutely fabulous tasting fondue, great with veggies, bread and cooked potatoes: nobody spoke for the first few bites, just alot of moaning...then the compliments come rolling in...

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed this fondue.  It was simple, thick and creamy without have a strong overpowering flavor (like cheddar or swiss).  It was a huge hit, I served it with cut up french bread and veggies.  We enjoyed it so much that the four of us ate nearly half the batch in addition to the meat fondue pot.  :)  Thanks a ton for an easy, yummy recipe.

Everyone loved this Christmas day. I served it with crusty french bread. I also poured a little of this over some  boiled onions and my Dad (who's 88) really liked it and he's picky.

I loved this. The only adjustments I made were I added a dash of black pepper to it, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt & used it on pasta as some others suggested. Will make again!

Awesome and easy fondue -- I added a little more garlic salt though for an extra punch!  I served it with french bread and veggies....the bread went faster than the veggies!

Easy and delicious.  A little goes a long way as it's very rich.  Use a good quality Parmesan (Reggiano) or else it's just another white cheese fondue.

been making this for years - always good but I use garlic powder rather than salt as there is enough salt in the parmesan

I made this last night for a potluck at work today.  It was SO easy to make and everyone is raving about it today.  I will definitely make this again.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since that is what I had on hand and I also added a pinch of salt.  It makes a decent amount, good for a potluck/crowd.  I also suggest using a good parmesan - it definitely adds to the flavor.  Thank you!

People ask me for this recipe all the time.  It's quick and great!  I usually put it in a small crock pot and take it to pot lucks with 2 loaves of french bread, broccoli, cauliflour, green peppers, and whatever veggies I can lay my hands on.  Instead of the garlic salt, I usually saute up about 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding the milk and cream cheese.

Fabulous!!  I took the advice of other reviews and added white wine and swiss cheese.  Taste just like what you get at the pricey fondue resturants.

GREAT STUFF! It started as fondue for a party and ended up in lasagna the next day in place of ricotta cheese.

Wow, was this ever delicious!!!  I didn't change anything we loved it!  I halved the recipe for 10 people at a potluck and it fit perfectly in my mini crockpot and was the perfect amount for everyone since there was other food.  Served it with a cubed french baguette.  Next time I may try adding a bit of swiss cheese and maybe some dry white wine in place of some of the milk just to put a twist on it.  It certainly was excellent as is though and the consistency stayed smooth for 2-3 hours!!  Would also be good with a Granny Smith apple, and would probably be delicious over pasta!

As others suggested, replaced 1/2 cup milk with zinfandel; added some worcestershire; used bread, mushrooms, granny smith apples as dippers.  Apples were the best!

We tried this on Christmas Eve (in addition to our regular traditional fondues we have).  My nephews (ages 11-15) are not big fans of the regular Swiss-based cheese fondue but they loved this!  They even made it for New Year's Eve the next week.  We all really liked this....parents and kids included.  Super easy recipe!!

I thought it was alright.  I made it for just my fiance and myself so I cut the recipe in half.  It was enough to fill one of those crockpot little dippers.  We barely even put a dent in it and we ate a lot.  

It tasted a bit grainy to me.  We love cheese so we ate it and I'll attempt using the leftovers for a pasta dish tomorrow.

WOW!!! This is the deal breaker of all time. Do not plan on leftovers unless you are the only one eating it.  Easy, creamy, finger licking good.  There was none, not a smidge, not a drop, not a twinge, left--it was that good.  Used two cloves minced garlic, lightly sauted in olive oil before adding milk and cheeses--instead of garlic salt

Trying to make a huge quantity of this recipe, I ended up scaling the ingredients myself.  I think I should have followed allrecipes.com version of the scaling, as my fondue ended up too liquid, though taste-wise it was a hit.  I have made an alfredo sauce similar to this recipe many times to go with chicken and broccoli pasta. It rates high for taste and ease, but not for scaling... oh well.

This is more of an alfredo sauce than a fondue. I was dissappointed. I will stick to my swiss and guyere cheese fondue.

Easy and so good!  Made exactly as directed with 1% milk and 1/3 fat cream cheese but used shredded parmesan because that's what I had on hand.

If you are expecting a traditional savory cheese fondue you will be quite disappointed.  Even with the 1/2 cup of white wine, I kept thinking "this tastes like it should be on a bagel".  Next time I will double the parm and 1/2 the cream cheese- and keep the wine. Or I was thinking that it may make a nice dessert fondue- skipping the garlic salt but adding a tea spoon of sugar. Serving  it with in season berries and chocolate slivers with a cold Riesling to drink.

Was just okay for us. A little strong for our tastes and we love parmesan, I even bought a $12 piece of parmesan. I still enjoyed it with the toasted french bread the best!!

This fondue was ok, but not what I was expecting. I think the cream cheese was overwhelming even though I used the good Parmesan Reggiano and shredded it myself.

This tastes very good but doesn't look as good.  I made in a small crock pot since it had to be on an appetizer table for quite awhile. Taste is great!

Very good, but very mild. That was what we wanted since we had lots of kids - if it was all adults, I would have added a bit of garlic and italian seasoning to kick it up a bit. Mini roasted potatoes and tortellini were a hit to dip. Thickens up quite a bit in the fondue pot, keep stirring!

Delicious!  The parmesan taste is there, but not too overwhelming.  It was a hit with kids and adults alike.  I served it with these dippers: cooked potato cubes, blanched broccoli, sausages, bread, and mushrooms.

I added about a cup of dry white wine and about 8 ounces of shredded Swiss cheese.  It was amazing and everyone loved it!  It also does great in a slow cooker!  We might try serving the cheese fondue over noodles with grilled chicken and veggies next time!

Very easy recipe with inexpensive ingredients that are easily found at any grocery.  I used parmesan/romano grated cheese and shredded parmesan.  I did need about 1 extra cup of milk for my substitutions to get it to a consistency we could dip the bread in.  Smooth and creamy and didn't get stringy.  Tasted even better the next day so this could be made ahead of time and heated back up in a fondue or crock pot.

I would call it a decent pasta sauce but that is about it. I was timid when I looked at the ingredients but set my worries aside by positive review after review. I don't know how all of these people ate it. TOO rich.

This was so easy to make and was a huge hit the three times I've made it now!  I didn't have a drop left when my friends and family were through with it.  I didn't change a thing from the recipe - it was perfect just how it's written.  I loved it with a nice tart green apple, and my family gobbled up the bread.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!

I would definately make this again...When I was melting downing the cream cheese and milk, I was concerned
that it was going to be runny but once you added the parmesan it went to a thick mixture, very tasty...served with breads and blanched veggies.

Wow...soooo good. had it for V-Day dinner, with chocolate fondue...it was wonderful. I out it in a bread bowl, and added cooked bacon bits, and chives on the edge of the bowl for color, texture and flavor. I also added a little white wine when I was cooking it. I have been craving this for the last couple of days! Thank you

This one is a keeper.  It was quick and easy and very good.  I followed the directions exactly, but did halve the recipe, since I only needed to serve 3 people.  My husband said the taste reminded him of Alfredo sauce.
We served the fondue with French bread cubes, raw broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.

Made this for daughters and grandkids for "fondue night" - it was a hit!   Delicious and creamy - we also dipped blanched asperagus tips and broccoli in it.  Would have also been great with tender crisp cawliflower... the kids loved to eat their vegetables with this one!

Way too much Parmesan - that was the only flavor and we tired of it quickly. We have fondue every Friday and this will not be making a return appearance.

Does not taste like parm fondu, but cream cheese overload. We've tried other fondu recipes and had a lot of success, but just because this one is easy, does not mean it's good. It was like melted garlic heavy cheesecake.

This was a delicious and simple fondue! Everyone in my family loved--even my dad who doesn't care for parmesan cheese.

This was amazing, especially with half a cup of wine, but it was too thick. I don't know if I cooked it too long or just let it get too cold, but next time I make it I'm going to add 1/2 cup of milk to make it a better consistency.

This recipe is AMAZING! We had a fondue girls night, I made this and it was a huge hit!  I especially loved fresh baguette dipped in it.  It nicely complimented the oil fondue because you could then dip your cooked chicken & mushrooms & stuff into the cheese. Healthy? Not at all, Delicious? Definitely!

This would be good for a party as a dip, but it not a comparable to a real cheese fondue that you can call dinner. It is pleasing for the first couple of bites, but then becomes too creamy and bland. I recommend dipping some veggies or something with flavor.

This wasn't that great. Salty and tasted a lot more like cream cheese than anything. Good thing I scaled the recipe down (wish I had scaled it down even more though). Sorry, but we will be trying a different fondue recipe.

My kids really enjoyed this because the flavor wasn't too strong and it wasn't too salty. I used skim milk, one pkg of 1/3-fat cream cheese, and one pkg of regular cream cheese, and I also added about 2/3 cup of shredded swiss cheese with the parm and a little more garlic than called for. I thought it was a little bland, but it went very well with our variety of dippers. I will make it again, but I may use half beer and half milk next time to give it a little more flavor.

If you use skim milk, I would use only 3/4 cups milk.  Mine turned out a little runnier than I would have liked.  Delish!

FANTASTIC RECIPE!! I made it last night and everyone loved it. it was so simple to make and also much more economical since some of those "stinky cheeses" in typical fondues can be pricey. i served this with bread cubes, apples, pears, grape tomatoes, blanched broccoli and carrots. the bread went fast, but it was also great with the apples and pears. WILL MAKE AGAIN!

Excellent!  I put it in a mini crock pot and then took it off the heat to put on table.  Not a good idead.  Got too thick.  Next time keep in fondue pot or leave crock plugged in.

I made this fondue and another highly rated cheese fondue from this website. This one was gone completely and the other hardly touched at my last gathering. Its wonderful and easy and has tons of flavor without being overly strong and sharp like the other. This was my first time to make or eat cheese fondue and most of the people present were first timers too. Everyone raved about it. We dipped sourdough and whole wheat french breads and a variety of very lightly steamed veggies-brocc, cauli,baby carrots asparagus and new potatoes. We also did some fruit-grapes, pears, apples. I also made pigs in blankets with little smokies which I felt were a little tacky, but everyone LOVED them. Good party! :)

This is a FANTASTIC Dip. I always make the same dips and I wanted something different for a family get together. Everyone LOVED it! It was so easy to make and it is now a new family favorite. Everyone wanted the recipe! I read all the reviews and I used Parm/Romano Cheese and I added Swiss Cheese like someone had suggested. I made it in a pot on the stove and then poured it into a small crock pot. It was so creamy and delicious!!! Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe!

I would give this 10 stars if possible!  I made a quadruple batch for a fondue party bridal shower. The women loved the cheese more than the chocolate!  It wasn't smooth - but no one cared because it is so savory. I made it the day before, then reheated.  It was super thick, so I added one can of evaporated milk to help thin it down for dipping.  It thickened right back up after refrigerating.

Our family has been making this recipe for 43 year since my brother learned in in 4H cooking class. Our winter favorite, broth soup fondue and bread. I have not measured the ingredients for so long. I watch for sales on cream cheese and stock up.

5 stars is for the improved recipe! I followed the suggestion of one of the readers, and it is now incredible.  If you think the recipe is excellent the way it is, you would totally freak if you added 1/2 cup white wine (Sauvignon or Pinot Grigio), minced garlic (simmer in wine for a minute or so before adding other ingredients), and 1/2 pound swiss cheese, sliced, to the original recipe. I was eating this stuff for breakfast!! Leftover fondue stores in the refrigerator very well, and I put the leftover french bread cubes in a ziploc bag in the freezer, and took out only the amount I needed to thaw in microwave; it tasted perfect and remained fresh that way. I also used 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream or half and half and it was incredible. It tastes so much better with the wine and swiss cheese; try it!

This was a great fondue recipe! I followed it exactly and it turned out very tasty. My boyfriend could NOT get enough, was desperate to get the last few remaining drops. Used french bread and sliced apple to dip in it :)

This was delicious!  I used 1/2 cup wine in place of 1/2 cup of the milk and a blend of parmesan and asiago cheeses.  We weren't able to eat all of it the first night but it actually reheated perfectly the next day.  I am excited to incorporate this recipe into a pasta dish as well.

Fantastic! Thought it was best with broccoli, cubed bread, chunks of ham, and oven fried potatoes. I love this recipe because it doesn't clump up. It's just creamy, yummy goodness...

Fantastic recipe, received rave reviews and it makes a ton. Altered slightly only because I picked up the wrong cheese at the store - a mix of parmesan, asiago and romano. Also added a few slices of swiss. I will be passing this along and keeping for the next time I need a nice appetizer. I served with sourdough and brown bread bowls. Next time, I will chop up some chives for a pretty presentation.

This is delicious!  I served it at our family Christmas party and everyone loved it.  It is simple to make and not as costly as most fondue recipes.  We added a few tablespoons of wine and continued to do so when it would thicken up.  I am bringing this to a New Year's Eve party tonight!

Not like this recipe needs any more positive reviews...obviously it's fantastic.  I made it for a group of girls along with a chocolate fondue.  I gotta' say, for a group of major sweet tooths, we sure couldn't stay out of this chees fondue!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I just did it all in a crock pot so as not to dirty another pan, and it worked just fine. It went great on bread, vegetables, pretzels, and leftovers would be great as a pasta sauce.  Don't miss this one!

Ok, I needed something to bring to a potluck for work and I saw this recipe.  So easy and everyone reaved about it.  I actually put all of the ingredients in a small slow-cooker on low and 3 hours later it was delicious.  I served it with bread, but it was also tasty with vegetables.  I think it would be a wonderful pasta sauce as well.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

This was EXCELLENT!!  My friends and I made two types of Fondue in one evening, and this was definitely our favorite.  We made the recipe as-is; no substitutions.  It was even excellent the next day as a sandwich spread and veggie dip!

On a scale of one to ten this recipe was probably the best cheese fondue recipe I have ever made. It was easy to make with cheap ingredients (that most people have at home already). We did add a little more cream cheese to make it our desired thickness. Everyone loved it, and we ate the left overs days later! Enjoy!

I can't say enough about this delicious fondue! I found the recipe last year and have made it many times since. I will definitely be making this during every holiday at our house as everyone absolutely LOVES it. Aside from the bread, I also serve it with carrots and cherry tomatoes. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Pretty tasty but serves a lot!  It said serves 28 and I laughed a little to myself but really it serves a lot!  I made it for my girlfriend tonight for dinner and it was very easy and pretty good.  I added more garlic salt and served it with french bread and sliced steak that i cooked up really fast in oil and garlic.  I'll make it again, but cut it in half.

This was great. I thought this was a little too rich to be considered fondue, but it was still yummy. I served this with cubed bread and steamed vegtables (potatoes and broccoli). Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this fondue for a party...it was a hit.  I thought it was a tad salty, but I served it with french bread cubes and that sort of kicked the salty taste.  Great recipe.

A bit salty and bland in other taste departments. Will experiment with spices next time. Otherwise a good base fondue recipe. And it stores well.

GREAT recipe! I did 3 fondues and this was by far the favorite. Delicious with crusty, older wheat bread and green pepper chunks. I think it would also be quite tasty as a pasta sauce with vegetarian ravioli. Enjoy!

We really enjoyed it.  Followed recipe exactly.  Used skim milk - was worried that it might be runny, but once it came to a hard simmer it thickened up nicely.  Served with bread and veggies.  I offered pasta as a side dish and my daughter started dipping it in.  I'm serving the left overs with pasta tonight.

This is so good!  If you don't like a lot of saltiness, use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Then, after tasting, add regular salt to taste.  I like this as much as a chip dip, with kettle cooked chips as I do with the bread.  It's addicting!

This was okay - I liked that it was very creamy.  The cream cheese taste was pretty strong, so make sure you are okay with that.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce.

This fondue was fab. Even my children liked it. I didn't change anything and thought there was plenty of flavor and I garnished it with shredded parmesan . It stayed nice in a small crock pot We tried it on pasta the next day but we didn't care for it that way.

Very good ! I made this to introduce my hubby to fondue, he had never tried it before. It was a perfect starter, he wants to try some new recipes because this was so good. I have a mini crockpot, and I didn't realize that I had to unplug it after it was warmed up, I left it plugged in and it ruined the rest of the fondue because it was too hot (my fault, not the recipe). I served this with bread and apples, and some veggies.

Just ok. Really misses the texture and taste of adding dry white wine and flour, like traditional fondues. Taste of the cream cheese is overwhelming. But it is simple.

I loved this cheese fondue.  Only 2nd time we've had fondue and the first time we did one of the fancy cheese fondues and loved this much more.  The other was a pain in the neck to make and did not hold up well.  This one had great taste, inexpensive, held up and everyone loved it!

I made this fondue for my husband for Valentine's Day and he loved it!  As suggested, I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, which really added to the recipe.  It is simple to prepare and, of course, incredibly easy to eat!  We enjoyed it so much that we didn't even touch the chocolate fondue that I made for dessert!

Awesome fondue recipe!!  Everyone loved it.  It has nice cheese flavor and does not seperate after sitting for awhile.  I have had a hard time finding a fondue recipe I love and this is it.  We dipped french bread, steamed broc and calliflower, and grilled chicken.  This will be added to my favorite list for parties.... for all ages!!

I took this to a baby shower and everyone loved it.  I used evaporated milk, shredded parmigiano-reggiano, and added some minced garlic.  I used herbed focaccia bread for dipping.  One lady said that she has dreams about this and begged me to make it again.

A really easy fondue recipe that is widely accepted by all types of guests.  The easiest fondue I have ever made.  The only change I made was to use reduced fat cream cheese and I added 1/4 c wine.

not too impressed, especially after reading some of these reviews.  Extremely rich, but not much else going on flavor wise.  I tried adding more garlic, then basil and oregano, finally bacon bits, the bacon was good but the last thing this recipe needs is more fat.  It was better with veggies than bread.  It might make a decent pasta sauce, but it's not as good as alfredo.

This fondue is so easy to make & so delicious!  My family started having a fondue night last year...I made this & it was the hit of the night. This year, everyone requested I make it again & they all loved it!  I highly recommend this simple, tasty fondue.  Great w/ bread, chicken, etc.

This tasted really good.  I didn't have garlic salt, so I added minced garlic to taste and I mistakenly bought shredded parmesan. That's probably why it didn't look really smooth. Will make again. My picky 8 year old loved it.

This was fantastic; everyone complimented it.  I followed the recipe exactly, along with adding some shredded swiss cheese.  There was very little left, and I used that over pasta - very, very similar to an Alfredo sauce that I have a recipe for.

This was so delicious!  It was easily eaten between 3 people as the main dish, and could have eaten more.  Served it with red and yellow bell peppers, cubed rosemary bread and granny smith apples (my favorite choice)  Next time I plan to rub the pot with a fresh garlic clove first.

2009 was the 2nd time I made this fabulous Parmesan Fondue. I cut the recipe in half melt all ingrediants over the stove then place in a quart size crock pot and keep it warm. The last two years I have served this fondue with beer bread from Tastefully Simple and it's always the first to go. This fondue is easy to make and everyone raves about it.

Oh my gosh. To die for, really. I've never had such a wonderful cheese fondue. Between four people, we completely cleaned the fondue pot!! Absolutely excellent.

This recipe was very good. Although I found it a little bland as is. So I added more garlic, a little salt and pepper, and some onion powder. Delicious. I served it with bread chunks, mini turkey meatballs, and red pepper slices. MMMH!

This was pretty good.  It had a little too much of a cream cheese twang to it, but I think I'm going to tweak a little next time to make the Parmesan flavor stand out more.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this! I'm not much of a cook, but I receieved a fondue set for Christmas two years ago.. Looking through the fondue recipe, this one sounded nice and easy and tasty.. While I was cooking, my cousin walked up and said, "It smells really gross.. But I think its one of those things that'll taste delicious.." And sure enough, I believe he ate the most. I served the meal to two children and my mother.. They loved it. We used Garlic Bread instead of French Bread (shopping listed misinterpretation) and I also served strips of beef cooked in oil/garlic. They loved it!

This is delicious.  I liked the tang and it was creamy and went well with the French bread.  I can't wait to make again.  Thanks for the post.
