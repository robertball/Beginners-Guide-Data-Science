I normally try recipes with lots of reviews, so I was wary of this one since it only had a few, but I'm glad I took the risk and tried it!  Turned out delicious.  I did add bacon and red peppers, just because I had them on hand.  It took a bit longer to bake for me.  It didn't last long!

Wonderful egg bake! I needed an egg bake for a group of friends and I stressed over what to make. Substitutions were mild cheddar and a can of RO-TEL tomatoes and diced green chilies. I made this the night before and, after an additional stir of the egg mixture, I combine the two together and baked. I also half-cook the mushrooms in a pan with butter (then drained) so that I knew they would be cooked without being mushy. The Bisquick gives the egg bake a more firm consistency.

This is the  first time I have made a egg bake  Really. Sad to say I was not  impressed. One thing I should divulge I did not use sausage,  I used ham. Even though,  this just did not have much flavor. And with the ham it was way too salty. Plus, what was up with Oregano? I just did not like this very much.  I'm more a pancake breakfast/dinner kinda girl. Maybe I should stick with that.

Great and easy recipe. I added fresh sliced mushrooms, a package of Simply Potatoes shredded potatoes and a small can of green chiles. Awesome all in one dish meal. Definitely will make this again for brunch or dinner.

Not bad, but nothing special either.  I took this to work and it took a while to get eaten.  The bisquick mix makes it easier to mix, but made it a little weird texture wise.  It is, however, relatively easy and versatile--you can add a lot of different ingredients to this.  Thanks for the recipe.

Looked great and tasted fine. I think the oregano is what makes me give it three stars. Realized we're not fans of oregano. Otherwise it was great.

Always a crowd pleaser and makes great leftovers.. plenty of room for other additions like spinach for example. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner and can be made the night before and reheated the next day.

My wife said it was the best egg bake she ever had. My  grown daughters wanted to take home a piece for later. Tasty, filling, all fresh. Looks like we have our company egg bake recipe (except when the vegetarians are here).

Great recipe! Easy to make for a first timer... Adding some dried basil and cheddar made it amazing!
