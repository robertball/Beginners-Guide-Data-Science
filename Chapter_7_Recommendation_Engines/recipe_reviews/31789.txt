This is really good!  I added some button mushrooms, onion, and corn.  It made a very filling, wholesome dinner,  served with biscuits and fruit. This would be a great pot-luck type dish.

I halved the recipe and I cooked it for 1 hour uncovered then another 20 minutes covered with foil since it was getting crisp.  I used turkey kielbasa and also had sliced red onion and some mushrooms.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

I wasnt sure what to think of this recipe but decided to try it anyway. My family LOVED it. It was very simple. You can also spice it up by using a dash of cayenne or adding some hot peppers. You can really work with this recipe to make it your own.

I didn't like this dish at all. The potatoes had an odd texture, and the sauce wasn't very good either. I won't be making this again.

Simply great!  Surprisingly tasty given the simple ingredients.  I used 3 lbs. of smoked sausage, 4 lbs. of cubed potatoes, one can on tomato sauce and one can of ready diced tomatoes, and doubled the basil and garlic powder.  Baked in my P.C. stoneware bowl with lid on convection bake for 1 hour, 15 minutes.  Terrific and well received by both the kids and adults.

Very good recipe. Did add some fresh mushrooms and bell peppers to it. Also increased basil and garlic for more flavor. We like spice, so I also added some cayenne pepper. Delicious!!

Great quick and easy dinner.  Served it with a salad and some good crusty bread, very filling.  This one will most likely be made again on a cold winter night.  Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious!  Used white potatoes, added a red bell, an onion, and pineapple chunks.  Would've added mushrooms but the dish was already overflowing. doubled spices, and left out salt.  Cooked at 350 uncovered for an hour then 375 covered for 45 minutes.  Made a side of JP big dady biscuits and ate way too much for dinner.  Hubby ate to much too.  And we both can't wait to eat it for lunch!  Thank you!  I will make this for years to come.

It was OK, I won't be making it again.  I even used fresh basil from the garden and minced some fresh garlic instead of the dried spices.  Everyone like the kielbasa in it, but not the potatoes.

Thanks for the great recipe James! We really enjoyed a new way to cook kielbasa. We added a little onion and a little water and it was great. My 3 year old twins even liked it. What a bonus! We will use this recipe again.

Good recipe, James!  I took a previous reviewer's recommendation of adding pineapple to the dish and it made an interesting twist.  I wouldn't add any additional salt as there is plenty in the kielbasa and canned tomato sauce.  I halved this recipe and it made enough to serve 6 people.

This dish turned out far better than I expected. I baked this covered for an hour at 375, then uncovered for 20 minutes at 350 and it was perfect. I also added a couple of cans of pineapple chucks (drained), which added just a tiny bit of sweetness that accentuated the other flavors well. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I had the oven at 350 for the first hour. I took it out of the oven and stirred to blend the seasonings. I covered the top of the pan with foil and put it back in oven for 1 more hour at 325. Very good and easy.

I used marinara sauce which I guess was a mistake.  It did not taste very good.  It also burned from not having enough sauce.

I was looking for a new way to cook Kielbasa, and this was fantastic. My husband said it was so good, he wants it once a week!  Very easy to make and could easier be made larger to feed a hungry crowd.

Instead of peeled and cubed potatoes, I sliced them with my V-slicer. Overall a good dish and a nice change of pace for kielbasa.

Interesting mix of flavors...  Not something I would make a lot, but a good "once in a while dish".  Not bad, but I have other ways of cooking kielbasa that I prefer a little more.

This was really easy to make and tasted really good.  But I do agree that the cooking time as stated in the recipe was too long.  Next time I'll probably only cook for about an hour and half or so.

Very tasty.  Mine was a little bit salty, so I'll try it with turkey or low salt kielbasa next time.  My kids LOVED it - and that makes it worth making again!

I'm giving it 4 stars b/c of a few changes.  I pureed a can of tomatoes, instead of using sauce.  I also sliced the potatoes and put in convection oven at 400 w/ foil on top to help speed up the process.  It was done in 60 mins and tasty.  I was very happy about that.

This is a great recipe, and it gives you a lot of room to play around with it. I added a lot more to it, like fresh minced garlic (instead of garlic powder), carrots, chopped onion, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes. Put the sauce over it and covered it for 20 minutes at 350. Uncovered it for the rest of the time and put the oven to 375, which was about an hour and 40 minutes. Mine did take the suggested time of 2 hours, and the carrots and potatoes could've used a little more. This could've been due to the size of them (i cut mine into chunks). It was a great dish, and the whole family loved it! It was just so simple and homey, will definitly use again!!!

I tried this and I didn't like it at all. Too much tomatoe sauce and the veggies took forever to cook.

I really thought this sounded a little weird, but it was good! I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce, added a can of corn and some shredded cabbage. The potatoes retained their shape and weren't too mushy. Of course, I covered it the entire time and only cooked it for an hour and 10 minutes. Everything was perfectly cooked. Thanks for this recipe. Very easy and just a little different.

I used sweet potatoes cuz that's all I had on hand and Lil' Smokies cut in half and a jar of Arrabiatta Pasta Sauce...OMG so good!!! I did what someone suggested and covered the dish for the 1st hour of baking then uncovered and baked for an add'l 30 minutes. Definitely would make again!

It was nice to have a different recipe to try Kielbasa in. However, this was somewhat dissapointing. The sauce was the problem, it just didn't work in this dish. Doubt I will try again.

I have to agree with several others that the potatoes added nothing to this dish.  I would have much preferred this to be made with a pasta of some sort... egg noodles maybe?  Anyway, it was eaten but will not be a repeat for our family as written.
