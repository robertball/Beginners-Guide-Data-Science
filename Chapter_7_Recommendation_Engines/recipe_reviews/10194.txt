This recipe was SO EASY to make and they turned out perfect!  I made six different Christmas cookies and everyone commented about liking this cookie the best.  One close friend said, "I really liked the sandtarts the best" and I didn't even mention that I had included sandtarts in her mixture of home made cookies.  She recognized them immediately as being sandtarts.  I'm making another batch this week because the others are all gone.

Excellent recipe! This yielded 7 dozen cookies. Modifications that worked for us:
* Cooked at 325 for a full 10 minutes 
* Increased vanilla to 2 1/2 tsp
* Added cinnamon AND sugar on top after cooking

This recipe was way too rich for me, but the sugar and cinnamon on top was a nice flavor.
