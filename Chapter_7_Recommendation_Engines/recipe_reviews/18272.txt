I have made this dish for both my family and friends, and they all love it! My grandfather, a notoriously picky eater, thought it was delicious. It is quick to put together, and the french onion dip gives it a really nice flavor. A definite hit at my house!

I served this at Thanksgiving dinner because my father likes scalloped corn.  He (and everyone else) LOVED this dish.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I used low-fat onion dip.  Next time, I will reduce the butter by half.  It was a little rich and it looked very greasy while baking.

Fantastic! You can also use the prepared Vegetable dip ... whatever...just try this! Great for summer picnics or cook-outs with steaks or burgers!

Everyone liked it; I thought it was sorta dry and I prefer the scalloped corn recipe in Betty Crocker

First I made Corn Casserole I, which was great.  Then decided to try this recipe.  It wasn't bad, but the other was great.  I will not be making this again, but definitely recommend Corn Casserole I.

This was really good. I think the french onion dip is what makes it so good. I added a can of whole kernal corn to the  recipe just to add some texture.

I thought this was okay, but not outstanding.  I wasn't sure about whether the butter was to be melted or was to be cut in, so I melted it.  It worked out fine.

I added some frozen corn and made sure not to over bake it!
