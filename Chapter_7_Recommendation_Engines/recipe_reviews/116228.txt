This was sooooo awesome! I followed the recipe as written but used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated all day. Served over black beans and topped with homemade pico de gallo and homemade tortilla strips! It was the best dinner I had in a long time. The entire family loved it.

Delicious, I had everyone at work wanting to try this from the smell of heating it up. Then they all wanted the recipe!

Used this recipe and marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight. Grilled them today and they disappeared fast! Will definitely use this recipe again. It was fabulous!

Made this for my family yesterday.  My eldest son, who has traveled to Mexico, said "Mom, whatever is in this marinade is REAL Mexican!  It smells wonderful!"  Whereas I thought there would be enough left over for a small meal, it was devoured.  They couldn't get enough..."so tender, etc."

Chicken turned out very moist, but the dominant flavor was citrus-y and not spicy.  We were looking for more heat with a hint of citrus... Next time we make this, we might try pickled jalapeños or something to increase the heat level a bit.  It was still good, though!

Wonderful!! I grilled it on an indoor grill, and it turned out perfect. I plan on using the same marinate on shrimp and salmon...but they will be great, too. Thanks for posting this recipe...Pam

I made this recipe with a few modifications, and it ended up being so delicious! First, I scaled the recipe down by a lot, because I cook for two...not ten! I used two large chicken breasts and cut them into small pieces. I made the marinade with pineapple juice in lieu of the orange and finely diced two serrano peppers to add instead of jalepeño. The chicken was fast cooking, tender, and very tasty! We ate every bite in flour tortillas with cheese, lettuce, and my homemade pico del sol. We usually make our tacos with ground turkey, but I have been ordered to discontinue that and replace this recipe! Approved :) Thanks so much for the idea!

This was ok. I did spice it up a lot more after reading the reviews. The chicken was very moist and the taste was pretty good, I just felt like it was missing something.

This is one of my favorite ways to grill chicken.  The only change I make is to use 2 jalapenos as I like it a bit spicier.  I've tried it with both orange juice and concentrate and I definitely liked the concentrate better.

Delicious! Used fresh squeezed orange juice. Grating lime peel was a pain. Marinated overnight. It was perfect over rice.

Ok, so...I'm writing this review to say this is very adaptable (and so I remember what I did). I had to change a few items due to what I had on hand. I also scaled this half. Didn't have OJ so used some orange zest, orange extract and some juice from a can of tropical fruit. Used grn onion and omitted the honey. I did incorporate some chili powder, grnd coriander seed, 1/4C fresh cilantro, tsp of chipotle adobo sauce and 1/4C salsa verde. Woooo weeee! I marinated 3 bone-in chicken breasts (having loosened the skin) overnight and baked it off to shred and use in Enchiladas. Chicken was moist with a light citrus flavor, just a hint of heat but tons of flavor. I'm sure it's fine made per the recipe, I worked with what I had and added what I thought would kick it up a bit more. Thanks for the marinade idea!

I make this alot.  I don't change anything, it's perfect as is.  Every time I make it, I get compliments and my daughter always wants me to give her some to reheat for a sandwich for work.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you need to!!!

YUM!  I'm going to add another jalapeno or some red pepper flakes for more of a kick next time.  The spice is very subtle, and is perfect for people with a low tolerance for heat.

This was OK but didn't turn out that great for me.  Chicken wasn't as tender and juicy as I would have liked.  Flavor was good, though.

Throw in 1/4 to 1/2 cup gold tequila in the marinade and this recipe goes from amazing to explosive.

I just didn't care for this flavor combination.  I would have given it one star, but my 18 month old liked it so I gave it two.
