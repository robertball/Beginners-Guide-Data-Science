You know, these kind of DO taste like chocolate covered cherries! And even if you didn't think so, it doesn't matter because they're just that delicious no matter what you think they taste like.  These were just too deliciously sweet and pretty to serve in mere shot glasses so I thought they deserved an elegant glass (especially for a fancy, romantic dinner), and served them in crystal cordial glasses. Hmmmm, maybe they should be called Chocolate Covered Cherry Cordials?

This is really tasty! I put a maraschino cherry in each shot glass before serving. The recipe actually made 3 regular sized shot glasses full.

These are awesome! Had them (along with some other drinks) for "cocktail time" with my sister in law and these were our favorite! Yum!

I love the sweet drinks and this is a hit. I have to admit. I poured it all into a fancy glass and drank it as a cocktail. This would be great blended with some ice cream too.

YUMMY!  Didn't even taste like an alcoholic drink...and I substituted half and half for the heavy cream for less calories...

made these for hubby's birthday party, and they were a hit all around! I personally didn't like it, but several people couldn't believe how much they tasted like the name!

This was delicious!  I thought it tasted too good to be just a shot so I made it into a cocktail.  It does taste just like a chocolate covered cherry!  If you like these, try the Strawberry Shortcake Drink on this site...to die for!

nothing against the recipe; but it was too sweet.  i think it's the brand of amaretto i have.  it's not top shelf.  i think if i had had the better brand, the rating would be higher.  as is, they way i had it, i don't think i would make again, but you never know. ;-)  thanks anyway FoodieGeek!

These do taste like the real thing. I'm interested to try this with frangelico to see if results are similar.
