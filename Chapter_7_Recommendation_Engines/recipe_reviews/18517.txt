We have been making this salad for years in my family. Instead of cider vinegar we use seasoned rice vinegar and instead of vegatable oil we use peanut oil. Never put dressing in the fridge.  You must heat the dressing to a boil to make sure the sugar is dissolved. I always use at least 2-3packages of ramen noodles and slivered almonds. And to cook the crunchies I use 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Always add crunchies after you have mixed the dressing in.  I have used coleslaw salad instead of napa in a hurry and no one ever complains. However napa is the best.

I have just about had it with people changing the recipes and writing about it in the reviews/ratings. Just make it a new recipe and post it under a new name! 

This is a great salad! I have been making this salad for several years and always get rave reviews. I have had more requests for this recipe than I can count. I always use 1/4 cup of butter, melt it in a skillet and brown the almonds, sesame seeds and noodles. Increase the noodles to two packages, minus the seasoning package. The noodles are better if you break them up well, I put them in a plastic bag and break them with a rolling pin, just don't pulverize them. Use sliced almonds rather than silvered almonds. The dressing is much better if it is heated and boiled for the 1 minute, it dissolves the sugar. This salad is just not the same without the Napa cabbage. I cut the whole cabbage in half, cut each half three times lengthwise, then slice it across in about 1/2 inch slices. This works well for me. I must stress to let everything cool before mixing with the cabbage. Mix at the last minute before serving because the crunchies will get soggy, as stated in other reviews.

5-Stars just as written!  No doctoring up required. I did feel there was a tad more butter than necessary for the crunchies (but maybe that's just me). I can see where this would be an easy "make ahead" dish to transport to an event and assemble just before serving.  Adding this one to my "Favorites" List.  UPDATE:  I have found a way to "lighten" this salad without losing any of the flavors:  I spray the crunchies with butter spray before I bake them & use brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar.  Other than the oil, you have a Weight Watcher's friendly meal on your hands.  A regular in our house now.  My teenaged son loves it too and the dressing is GREAT on baked chicken!

Hearing people rate this recipe, but switching everything only makes it sound confusing to me. My husband made this for me and he FOLLOWED the RECIPE EXACTLY! WE BOTH LOVED IT! We were both pleasantly surprised how well the ingredients blended together. WE WILL MAKE AGAIN, JUST AS IS! ~Thanks.

Perfect potluck dish for traveling! Here's how: make the dressing at home,  let it cool and pour into a leakproof container, and seal the container in a ziplock bag. Gladlocks will leak! Toast the crunchies on the stovetop (in REAL butter, never the stuff in the tub!) and put crunchies in a container or quart-size ziplock bag. When you toast the nuts in real butter (not margarine), as the butter browns, the nuts become a little bit salty, and they offset the sweetness of the dressing. Do NOT use the seasoning packet; too much unhealthy sodium and MSG. Throw it away, it was only twenty cents and you're doing your body a favor. Nuts are heart- healthy; we prefer a mixture of pine nuts, sunflower seeds and sliced almonds because they look better and add texture. Use your nicest large bowl and tongs, and use the pre-shredded bag-o-cabbage to save time. When you arrive at your destination, put the cabbage in the bowl. As people line up to eat, add the dressing, a can of drained mandarin oranges, 1/2 cup of  dried cranberries (Craisins), and the crunchies. Stir well to coat everything, but don't add the dressing too early or it gets soggy. This salad does not do well as a leftover. Thanks for the post!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing on the first try, but I will next time. I am in the camp that says "you can't have too much butter" but 1/2 cup really IS too much. I think 1/4 would be plenty, since with 1/2 I had to spoon the ingredients out of the butter and drain on paper towels. The sweet dressing is a refreshing change of pace. I'd like to add a sliced up grilled chicken breast and make it a whole meal and will try with peanuts for my almond allergic sibling next time.

This salad is delicious!  The only 2 things I did different is cut the oil to only 1/2 cup instead of 3/4, and it did not change it a bit.  I also cut back on the butter to mix the ramen noodles, almonds and seseme with.  It tasted great to me.  Everyone who has ever been served this loves it.

This is an excellent salad!  I brought this to a potluck at work and the bowl was wiped clean!  I did make modifications, but I do that with almost all recipes.  I used pre-shredded cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage.  I doubled the recipe, and added shredded chicken and a can of manarin oranges.  I also reduced the vinegar by an 1/8 of a cup and replaced it with Mandarin orange juice that I drained off the oranges.  The crunchies were fantastic!  The only thing that I did differently is that when toasting the crunchies, I sprinked about 1 teaspoon of the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles over it and mixed well (I used the chicken flavor).  This added just a touch of saltiness to them, which matched perfectly with the sweet and sour dressing.  This was a hit!

Really good.  I used cabbage from my garden.  I didn't have almonds so I added extra sesame seeds.  I also used on 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the sugar.  The dressing was still REALLY sweet. It was tasty but it would be great with less sugar, too.

I made this salad for guests and got so many compliments.  None of it was left at the end of the meal.  My husband said that I can make it "any time".  I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar for a change and the dressing was even better.  This will definitely become one of my favorite recipes for guests and potlucks.

Oh my goodness! This is the BEST oriental salad I have EVER eaten!! I've had it for lunch every day for the last week and every time it's just as good as the last. I stored the crunchies in a separate baggie, put them on when I wanted some. Also kept the dressing in a bottle on the shelf. Keeps it fresh everytime you want some.

Great recipe. For those always complaining that people rate and make changes, I just have to disagree. Of course, if u change everything that's not right. I do, however, like ratings and comments of changes or tweaks that may make it more of a personal taste. So I'd like everyone to continue to voice their options even if they made changes or had to use what they had on hand. It helps me.

This salad was really good and easy to prepare.  Instead of trying to shread the napa cabbage (which was very difficult), I trimmed the ribs and then cut the cabbage into pieces with kitchen shears.  Much faster! Also, as I sampled the salad, I kept thinking it was missing something - it needed a kick.  So, I threw in a small amout of fresh cilantro leaves and Wow! That was exactly what it needed.  Every bit of the salad was devoured by my guests and I had about 8 who insisted I share the recipe with them.  Will definitely make again with the addition of the cilantro.

While very delicious just exactly as the recipe is written, I did find it too greasy for my tastes. 
I then tried the dressing with only 1/2 c extra virgin olive oil, and it was better and the taste did not change at all.
I will definitely make again and keep experimenting with the amount of oil in the dressing.

Did not really like. Break up ramen noodles before you open them. Expensive for what you end up with. Highin calories low in flavor.

Very tasty. Sweet and tangy. I used onion powder instead of green onion. This is a super crunchy salad. I skipped the saucepan step and put the butter in the baking dish and popped it in the oven to melt then I just stirred the crunchy bits in and baked them. I had trouble getting the dressing to mix, even with a whisk the oil kept separating. I waited the longest time for the crunchies to toast but they just weren't after about 8 minutes so I turned the broiler on and toasted them in a couple of minutes that way. Very good, Thanks!

I usually try to make a recipe the way it is written before I make adjustments.  But I didn't reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and the oil to 1/2 (only because I ran out of oil).  This was so delicious, my husband and I couldn't stop raving and I really wanted to lick my plate!  I served it with asian tuna cakes and can't wait to make it again!

Delicious!  I cut the butter by a tad and only used about 2T of sugar.  I can't imagine what this would be like with 1/2 c.  Too sweet in my opinion.  I also added about 1 tsp of sesame oil, chopped carrots and chopped cilantro.  Used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Left out the noodles because I didn't have them.  I sauteed chicken breast in butter, sliced it up and served it over this slaw like a salad.  Super summer dish!

One of my all-time favorite recipes!  We actually serve all three parts of this separately. That way people can have as much dressing/crunchies as they like, and since the cabbage & crunchies aren’t wet, they make good leftovers the next day. Just make sure to store your crunchies in an airtight container in a cupboard, not in the fridge.

Excellent Recipe.  I omit the butter and just toast the noodles, sesame seeds and almonds in the oven.  I have substituted agave or splenda for the sugar and both work well.  I also have shredded leftover chicken to make a complete meal.  Always yummy and a bit hit!

This salad was wonderful!  I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!  They all wanted the recipe.  I used light olive oil verses the vegetable oil and it was wonderful!!  Will make this one over and over again in the future!

Really tasty salad!  To cut the preparation time, I brown the crunchies over stove top and heat the dressing in the microwave.  I used walnut pieces instead of slivered almonds because that is what I had.  My husband loves tofu and sometime I will toss in some cubed tofu and it tastes great.  Thank you for the recipe.

A friend has a recipe almost identical to this that always receives rave reviews, so I gave this a shot and loved it! The only thing I did different is omit the soy sauce and include the noodle seasoning packet in with the dressing (I don't see that being called for in this recipe?)- I made it for a potluck at my daughter's preschool and it was a hit.

Love this salad. Didn't use nappa cabbage as it was $6 a head! First time I used regular cabbage that I just boiled to soften a bit and then dried and cut up. The second time I used the pre-cut coleslaw mix and that was good too. I am in LOVE with the dressing though!

People always ask for the recipe when I take this salad along.  I've used all kinds of cabbage for it, and it works fine (even though I have never shredded it), and a variety of oils and vinegars--I prefer rice vinegar over the cider called for.  I also halve the oil.

I love this salad. It's not necessary the healthiest salad, but it's so good and really filling. So, just because of the guilty factor I modify a bit. Reduce the oil to 1/2 cup for the dressing and 1/4 cup butter, which I am thinking that could reduce to bit more the next time. I cut up all the nappa and green onion and put it in the tappa wear. Then, just take as much as you eat on the plate + sprinkle crunchies +dressing. It get soggy quickly, so this works the best. I even add some canned mandarin oranges on the top. It add some colors and works out wonderfully. One more adjustment would be using rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. To me it gives better tanginess rather than extra sweetness from the vinegar. Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe.

Our family has always called this "Dead Man's Salad" because we always take it to funerals.   We also make it for most of our family holidays... and I always take it to work potlucks!!! It is always a rave and everyone asks for me to bring it again for the next function.  Easy, easy...

Someone gave this a 1 because they pulverized their own cabbage in a food processor and got a watery mush.  I think your own cooking might be a 1, but this recipe is a solid 5!

This recipe is tasty, but it is a little on the salty side.  Perhaps you could leave out the ramen noodle flavoring.  That might help.

this is a great alternative to the traditional tossed salad at mealtime.  I like to decrease the oil to 1/2 cup for my own preference.  Just served last night with veggie chik'n nuggets.  The kids ate it right up and thanked me for the delicious meal!!

"crunchies" are way too greasy and dressing is way too sweet.  Plus there is a step in here that is not necessary and just creates another pot to wash.  This recipe needs work!

This recipe was excellent.  I prepared it as directed and took to work for a pot luck, I had none left and gave the recipe to 4 co-workers.   I also left some at home for my family and they loved it too.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!!!

This recipe is a FAVORITE .. everyone likes it! I cook the dressing in a clear bowl in the microwave so easy .. just watch for it to boil . after a minute take it out.  Recently, I used splenda instead of sugar and it was wonderful tasting (couldn't tell the difference).. BUT .. the second time I did it, the contents exploded in the micro! I think the splenda boils at a faster speed so beware and watch it, I think 45 seconds is enough.

The salad was awesome but the dressing wasn't very exciting.  The Asian Ginger Dressing from this site would be fantastic on this salad.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  The crunchies took a while to brown, but it was well worth the wait.  You can't miss with this recipe for any family dinner or potluck party.

Absolutely awesome!  I made all the seperate parts the night before a party, then combined just before serving and it was great!  A little more work than some recipes I've received from friends, but it was well worth the extra work.  I'll make this again and again!

My mother-in-law makes a recipe like this. I knew what was in it so I looked it up on here. It is just excellent. I think I will take the advice of others and only put the dressing on what we're eating so leftovers don't get soggy. Also, I don't bake the "crunchies" either. I just toast them in a skillet with a little butter. Mmmmm. FAAAABULOUS!

Very good.  Instead of sesame seeds, I used sunflower seeds, which gave it a nice salty bite.

I've used this recipe for the past couple of years and its always a hit! One shortcut, though, is to just saute the ramen noodles, sesame (I subsitute sunflower) seeds in butter in a saucepan and skip the baking. Be sure to cool thoroughly before tossing with the lettuce.  It's different and great!

Even though it's really good, it could still be improved by reducing the amount of butter in the 'crunchies'.

This salad is absolutely delicious.  I looked for a healthier ramen noodle that did not contain hydrogenated fat - but could not locate this at a standard grocery.  Next time I'll visit Whole Foods.

I also dry roast the noodles and nuts and it becomes very nice and crunchy.  I add the noodles and dressing at the very end just before serving.  Always a winner.

Absolutely wonderful salad. The dressing is one of my favorite dressings I've ever had and the toasting of the noodles was great! I also added some clementines, some celery, and some lettuce (since I had those on hand). I will definitely serve it to more of my friends and family! Thanks for posting this!

OMG,delicious!!
As a new immegrant from Taiwan, I have tasted many "Asian food" created by creative americans and I have to say this one is definitely one of the best. Everything is balanced in a beautiful harmony: the crunchiness v.s. the tenderness, the nutty, buttery flavor v.s. the pungency of the herb and veg... And I love the rich and complex dressing, it really compliments the salad. Bravo!

This recipe is "THE BEST" My family of picky eaters love it. I did add mandarin oranges and some of the juice to the dressing, and shredded carrots, and very small head of red cabbage. This was so colorful. Next time I will add some fried chicken breasts cut up on top. This is a KEEPER I will make it often. Thanks for sharing!! :-)

Always a HUGE hit at potlucks. I really like using the napa cabbage because it looks more impressive... but I have used the cabbage mixture before too. I also add 1/2 packet or so of the flavor packet from the ramen noodles (chicken or oreintal flavor) to the crunchies while toasting in the skillet. I also skip the oven and just toast the crunchies to golden brown in the skillet... it saves time. The dressing in this recipe is also a little better than some of the other recipes... but it depends on how much time you have. Thanks for sharing!! YUM!

This is a great salad that can be prepared ahead of time and mixed just prior to serving. I have used the pre packaged shredded cole slaw mix and it is great. I also cool the crunchies on paper toweling, to prevent them from being too greasy. This is a salad that I never have any left over!

This was a new vegetable experiment I was trying out for my family and, apart from using a seasoned rice vinegar substitute for the white vinegar, I followed the exact recipe and it turned out to be a really delicious and fresh salad. It was a hit for the entire family. But next time, I'll cut back a bit on the sweetness and on the amount of oil.

So good!  I cut the oil and butter both in half and it turned out fine.  We loved the toasty flavor from the nuts and noodles.  It was great the next day after they had softened a bit, too.

I use Oriental flavor ramen noodles, and add a little of the flavoring packet into the crunchies mixture.  I also add some chicken (or in my case, vegetarian chicken), cooked with the remainder of the seasoning.  I usually cook the noodles/crunchies in a frying pan on the stove.  We like to add sliced water chestnuts for extra crunch (without fat!), and some cilantro to the salad.  A little sesame oil in the dressing is great, and canned mandarin oranges are also a fantastic addition to the salad!

I used my food processor to grate the Napa cabbage.  I ended up with watery pulp that is not usable.  Then I tried the slicing blade of the food processor and it wasn't much better.  I tried slicing by hand but that yielded large pieces of the white part that were not appetizing. IF I decide to make this again I will use regular cabbage.

Huge hit at potluck parties. I have taken it to about 10BBQs just this summer and have been asked for the recipe over and over. Snap tp make. Hint: I make extra crunchies and dressing for the next recipe. The dressing will keep about a week.

Omitted almonds (had none), but otherwise as directed. Everyone liked it. My serving had no ramen, only sesame, as I can't eat gluten. Even so, I give my plate 5 stars, too. Very simple, easy, and without the ramen, very quick, too. I didn't miss it.  I served with grilled Asian chicken and fried rice. Delicious, very light. Perfect meal.

Great!!!  It made too much dressing and too  much crunchies.  However, I will solve problem by adding extra cole slaw mix since 4 adults polished off the entire salad in about 10 minutes.

Wonderful salad!  I used rice vinegar because that's what I had and Pam instead of butter to cut down the fat.  I also reduced the oil in the dressing to 1/2 cup, but only used about 2/3 of the dressing in total.  It was yum and pretty healthy.

This was very good.  Took it to a potluck and it was the first dish gone.  I used only 3 TBS of butter to cook the crunchies and did not bake them.  I also cut down a bit on the sugar in the dressing and added a can of mandarin oranges to the salad just before tossing.  I will be making this again and adding some shredded chicken for a main meal.

As for all of you who tell me how you "changed" recipes I applaud you.  Many times I take everyones changes into account... and it turns out great!!!  As for this recipe I always add grated carrot for color.  My husband also loves the noodles so I must double it.  I've also used splenda for baking and even other types of healthier oils and it is always excellent!

This didnt go over well. I have made this in the past and remembered how good it was. I used two packages of ramen as suggested. I found this to be too much ramen. When I try this again. I will not use butter or put them in the oven. The changes I will make are to cut cabbage and make the dressing. When I'm ready to serve, I will add the ramen and almonds out of the package. They are crunchy enough without the butter. Pour on the dressing and add the package from ORIENTAL ramen seasoning and noodles and almonds. Mix well and serve. This is how I remember it and I believe it only needs one package of ramen.

Very nice change for a salad, great texture and taste.  This is a keeper for sure, I've served it many times and everyone loves it, never any left in the bowl.

Had to use regular cabbage but this was wonderful and despite the criticisms, was still tasty the next day if not quite as crunchy. Will make again!

This was a hit!  I took it to a potluck and I heard two people fighting over the last scrappings in the bowl!  I hope to try it with actual Napa cabbage next time.  The store I went to only had one little head left that looked pretty bad so I opted for the bagged coleslaw.  I used 2 packages of Ramen noodles with the recommended amount of butter and that worked out perfectly.  I cook with unsalted butter so I added salt, garlic and paprika to the crunchies when they came out of the oven, just to taste.  Like other cooks, I went with sliced almonds rather than slivered almonds-just a personal preference.  I also used organic sugar which tends to be less sweet than regular refined sugar, so I could see how it could be a bit too sweet as stated.  Otherwise fantastic recipe.

This is a Great salad, I have made it about 10 times now. I changed a few minor things. I use half the packet of ramen seasonings to jazz up the noodle almond mixture, I also prefer sliced almonds to the slivered. Lastly, I reduced the amount of suger in the dressing to half. Everyone loves this salad!

I substituted with Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, added 2 more Ramen packages. I used all the same measurements. It was good but not great.  I think it was too sweet for my taste for a salad.  I did enjoy making it. My hard to please husband said "it's good, I'm into it...but real sweet...the crunchies are good."  I would make bring it to a potluck. It's inexpensive and easy to make. Overall I will rate this salad the way I made it a 3 regarding my own taste.

the napa cabbage is so much better than the bag coleslaw stuff used in other recipes. I loved this - i use 1/2 the amount oil to cut back on fat- skipped the almonds- i cut it up- put in the green veggie bag =pack my dressing seperate and eat all week for lunch

Great recipe.  Served grilled raspberry chicken over it.  Had to substitute because did not have sesame seeds in stock.  Offset some of the veg oil with 2 TBL of sesame seed oil.  Could be easily converted to sugar free and still have great taste.

The idea is good and the finished product is almost there, but I would make a few changes.  Definitely go with olive oil, if not e.v.o.o., instead of the vegetable oil, as this gives the dressing a slightly bitter taste.  Try baking the crunchies with 1/4 c instead of 1/3 c butter; they were a little greasy with 1/3 c.  Other than that, it is a very good, refreshing salad!

This is "The Best".  My sister is asked to make this for every family function we have.  When she brings it to gatherings, she brings the dressing in a container and shakes it well before tossing the salad, then adds the crunchies.  I'm so glad she shared this recipe with me.

Just made this last night - it was great! I heeded some of the other users comments and reduced the amount of butter and oil (and used EVOO), made the crunchies in the skillet, and added mandarin oranges and orange-ginger glazed chicken chunks(made in wok).  I kept the dressing, salad and crunchies separate and put together only when about to eat.  But I would never substitute with the pre-packaged slaw mix - Napa cabbage is so much tastier!

My brother introduced this recipe to our annual Christmas dinner.  He made ONE change and it really makes a difference ... use the "Oriental" flavor ramen noodles.  Add the oriental seasoning packet to your dressing and WOW is it delicious!  My kids gave it rave reviews too!

I used broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage. It was excellent and the broccoli slaw is a little crunchier and much better for you than just the cabbage!

We ate this as a main course. My veggie shy kids ate it willingly. I made it twice and made some adjustments the second time. 

First of all I didn't put in the ramen seasoning packet. The first time I did, and after a few bites my kids and I agreed that it was too salty and left an unpleasant aftertaste, because of the msg. We didn't miss the flavor packet at all the second time. 

Secondly, I added two packets of ramen noodles, and 1/2 cup butter, and then I reserved some of the noodle mixture for sprinkling on top as the salad was served. I did this because the crunchy noodle mixture is my favorite part. 

I increased the rice vinegar and oil to 1/3 cup each, because the I didn't add the flavor packet it needed a little extra flavor. 

The last thing that I did different was add chicken. As another review said, this salad needs substance, and the chicken adds just the right touch.

This was good but maybe just little too sweet for us.  I also cooked the crunchies on the stove top.  I will make this again though and just use less sugar.  Some people complained that the next day it was soggy but I actually thought it was better the next day!  The crunchies weren't real crunchy by then but overall it was tastier.

We love this recipe and have had it multiple times and it is a delicious salad anytime of the year.  I also pan fry the noodles, sesame seeds, slivered almonds and add sunflower seeds.  We decided not pour to pour all the dressing over the entire salad, but take just what we need for each individual serving, as we usually have some leftovers for the next day and the cabbage does not wilt.   If I'm taking it to a potluck, then I pour over cabbage, as directed.

Don't forget to add the ramen spice packet to the dressing (why waste a good thing--I prefer the chicken flavor). You may also consider adding a little sesame oil and pepper to the dressing as well.  We love it.

Great Salad! I've been making this salad for years. I don't put the crunchies in the oven though, I just toast them in the pan and sprinkle on the salad, and I don't heat the dressing, but vigorously shake it. A few shortcuts that don't detract from the flavor! Great tasty salad!

This was sooo amazingly good!  Just made this and my family went crazy over it.  The ramen gets soggy kinda fast, so it might be a good idea to use it as a "topping" rather than stir it in.  We didn't hava any almonds so we just used two packs of ramen.  It came out just fabulous!!!!!!  YUM-YUM

This salad is delicious! I took it to a party and and it was big hit.   I used the packaged cole slaw mix which contains red and green cabbage and carrots.  It worked fine and made it easier.
   A suggestion:  put the dressing in a tightly closed jar and shake well before adding to salad.

Very good. I forgot to add the green onions, and used a combination of baby bok choy, green cabbage, and purple cabbage - was very attractive with the purple. Will plan to dial back on the sugar in the future.

Couldn't get enough of this!  Followed recipe as is except I used packaged fried rice noodles in place of the ramen noodles because that is what I had. Also added a can of drained mandarin oranges! Delicious!

This recipe is good as it is. If you want a lower calorie, healthy version try mixing boiled, chopped bean threads or rice noodles with the salad. Skip the ramen noodles and toast the sesame seeds and almonds under a broiler. I mix it all of the ingrediants together and then add the dressing as we eat it. It's still crunchy and tasty, but it is a lot healthier.

Grew up on this recipe...Mama always used to add a couple HEAPING tablespoons of Sriracha hot sauce to the dressing & we would shake it instead of boiling...can't say I would ever have it any other way! Try adding some hot sauce...it only improves!! We also love adding golden raisins, dried cranberries, bananas, mandarins & chicken as a sort of salad-bar option :)

Wonderful~went perfect with my General Tso's Chicken. I did add a little sesame oil to replace some of the olive oil and reduced the soy sauce just a bit to my taste. I also used cashews instead of almonds because that is what I had on hand. The napa cabbage was really good!

Really flavorful! I used a smidge less sugar and oil. Olive oil instead of veggie oil and rice vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. Also, I browned the crunchies on the stovetop- which worked perfectly. Super yummy.

This is delicious!  I was almost turned off by amount of sugar in the dressing, but a little goes a long way so it didnt end up being overly sweet.  Very delicious!

I added green and red bell pepper to this. There is no need to bake the noodles, sesame seed and almond mixture.  They crisp up fine enough in a wide pan with the butter.  I used rice vinegar, soy sauce, peanut oil and sugar, plus I added some powdered garlic and ginger for the dressing.  It's a keeper: worked as a great side dish with baked chicken.

this was a hit - I substituted balsamic vinagrette for the soy because of the soy allergies in the house, and it tasted very good.  I did miss the asian flavor that soy brings, but otherwise no complaints!

I didn’t know what to expect from this recipe… but I’m sure glad I tried it.. It was awesome!
Tips: *grate/shred the cabbage by hand not in a food processer.  The longer you have the cabbage setting the more water that will come out so the drain/squeeze the water off if you let it set for a long time.  
*DO NOT USE the seasoning package from the noodles! That’s a big mistake.
*Aftert i baked the crunchies for a while,I did broil them to ensure they were supper crunchy!

I didn’t have almonds so I used pecans, I also didn’t have green onion so I used yellow onion and it still turned out great, can’t wait to make it with the correct ingredients.  For me it wasn’t too sweet, oily, or water. It was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!!!

Very good...I would recommend adding a few drops of sesame oil and a tsp of ginger to the oil and vineger mix...I would also recommend using rice wine vineger.

One of the best salads I've ever had. Great taste, the crunchies are brilliant. I did a couple of things differently, but it still tasted great. I had half of a regular cabbage, so I used it and half of a napa cabbage. Also, I only had about 30ml of vinegar, so I used more soy sauce instead of it. And lastly, I put only half of the sugar into the sauce and I was very happy that I did - the salad would have been WAY too sweet if I had put all of it in. Overall, this recipe is a keeper.

I'm primarily rating the crunchy topping and veggies bc I changed the marinade/dressing quite a bit (as I had different oils/vinegars on hand and I wanted to avoid the sugar for dietary reasons. So, I omitted the sugar, added chili powder, used sesame oil in lieu of veggie oil and rice vinegar and lime in lieu of cider vinegar.The crunchy topping is a great topping to any salad, cooked collared beans, spinach, sprouts, etc..

Excellent recipe! I made it exactly as written except I used 2 packages of ramen noodles instead of one becuase I had a huge head of napa cabbage (which shredded beautifully in the food processor). It was a big hit at our Memorial Day cookout!

I've made this recipe for years but mine is a little different...3 containers: 1) 1 large head of napa cabbage and a bunch of green onions chopped. 2) 1 cup olive oil, I use 1/2 c. splenda and 1/2 c. sugar,1/2 c. white vinegar, 2 TBSP. soy sauce 1/4 tsp. pepper and the seasonings from the chicken ramen noodles. 3) 1 stick of butter, 1/2 c. sesame seeds (this is a lot so use to taste, 2 pkgs. ramen noodles and about 3 oz. slivered almonds.
Slice/shred step number 1 thinly and refrigerate overnight.
I don't cook step number 2. I just put it in a jar and shake for a day or so to combine flavors. I cook step 3 on the stove until slightly brown and remove to paper towels to drain. I then store in tupperware until ready to use. Keep the 3 separate and toss at serving time. This will be a family favorite for years to come. I'm sure you can figure out a lower calorie version...enjoy!

This was a wonderful salad!  I didn't expect it to be so good.  I've had it before somewhere, maybe at P.F. Chang's.  I made it as written, but only used 4 tbsp of butter, used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, and only used 1/4 cup sugar.  I concur with other reviewers; this would be a complete meal and would be even better with a grilled chicken breast added.

This was exactly what i've been looking for!  My mom had a recipe that we lost and this is just as good!  The dressing is really good ... not too oily and not too sweet!  I did however keep forgetting about the ramen noodles in the oven and kept burning them!  haha  so just be sure to check on it often!

This is my most requested recipe ever. I have served this many, many times at my sons school for a staff of 70. I buy bagged angel hair cabbage instead of the napa cabbage; take the green onions, crunchies, and dressing separately then mix together right before serving.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made this for a famil gathering and everyone loved it.  I made this exactly as written the first time - as I usually do - and could not think of anything to do to make it any better.  My husband liked it so much that it has become a regular in his lunch box now.  I just make sure to pack the salad and the dressing in separate containers.

Great Salad! I roasted the "crunchies" with 1T butter and 1t EVOO.  I wanted the crunchies a bit more salty so I sprayed with spray butter before putting them in the oven. I also subsituted peanut oil for vegitable oil and rice vinegar for cider vinegar. I let the dressing boil for 1 minute to disolve the sugar. Next time I might add mandarin oranges. Will make again!

I didn't have the sesame seeds and didn't miss them.  I have relatives fighting over the leftovers, when there are any.

Great recipe. I didn't have sesame seeds on hand so used 2tsp of sesame seed oil combined with the butter for the crunchies. It was excellent. For the dressing I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup to save some calories. It had great flavor and adhered very well to the cabbage. Nothing but compliments when I brought this to a party. Also, I highly recommend using double noodles (keeping butter/sesame oil/almonds the same) and crushing the ramen noodles in a plastic bag using a rolling pin. What a great recipe!

This is so incredibly addictive.  I wish it was better for you, but it is SO, SO good!  Thank you for the recipe. I did have to cook the crunchy bits longer than it said, but it was worth it for that beautiful golden brown color and buttery crunch:)

Awesome recipe, if you can't find napa cabbage you can get the mixed cabbage with carrots and that works great.

This was SO yummy, I basically ate the whole thing in 3 days.  One thing I did was increase the ramen noodle packages to 2 packages and added a tiny bit more butter to compensate for the extra noodles, and I liked having the extra crispies.  However I do have some left over after the cabbage is gone, so it's not totally necessary.  Everything else I did exactly like the recipe and it was wonderful and SO easy.  I've kept the dressing and crispies separately from the cabbage mixture, so when I've wanted this salad for lunch I've just tossed it together.  This is a definite repeat at my house!

Excellent salad - a little too much oil for me, but easily fixed and probably just my weirdness.  I did not have any sesame seeds, so I subbed a quarter teaspoon sesame oil on the crunchies and 2 tiny shakes in the dressing. A little goes a long way. My husband, who doesn't like raw cabbage, loved this, as did my 10 year old daughter.  Jury's out on the 3 year old though! lol

Hace made other versions of this, but this was great!  Cheated and used bag of cabbage/slaw mix and instead of dirtying up 2 dishes, I just sauted the butter and threw in the crunchies to toast in the frying pan, but watch them close and stir often.  Turned out great!  Thanks.

This was a great recipe to go along with a broccoli-beef stir fry. Next time I'll cut down a bit on the oil in the dressing - it separated a bit as it cooled, and the final salad was slightly too oily. Also, as it was my first time using napa cabbage, I made the mistake of trying to shred it in a food processor - just running a knife through to chop finely seems to work best! All in all a delicious blend of flavors, and quite easy to prepare.

This was absolutely delicious and great to take to a party!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce though because I was SO thirsty after I ate this.  I'm sure it was the sodium in the soy sauce.  Other than that, no changes.  This one is a keeper!

Yum-o!!!  I love this salad.  I do make some changes to suit our taste (omit the onions and sesame seeds and decrease the almonds, butter & oil in a desperate attempt to lower the fat in this recipe since I love it so much).

I use Cut up cooked chicken breasts, grapes, and instead of almonds, I use cashews. You make the sauce from 1 packet of ramen noodles. In this I chose rice vinegar. YUM everyone loves it!

I made this yesterday for the 4th of July.  I've had this kind of salad before, but had never made it myself.  This was much better than any I'd ever had!  I added a bag of shredded carrots and subbed sliced almonds for slivered, because I like them better.  I used the seasoning packet (Oriental Ramen)on the crunchies.  Delicious!!

Took this to a pot luck party and everyone raved over it, wanting to know who brought the salad. My dishes are NEVER the ones that people go nuts for so it was fun. Great recipe, easy to make (I used the bagged, shredded slaw).
Thanks!

When I make this salad I always sugar the almonds. Put them in a pan with a little sugar and heat til caramelized. Then cool on a plate and break up into pieces. Delicious!

This salad is awesome--it has quickly become a favorite!  Make sure not to mix in the dressing/crunchies until right before serving or it will get soggy!

This was the worst dish I ever had. My sister served this at a family gathering. What a mess this was. It was soggy, ugly and had a awful flavor. Do not make this dish!!!!

I love this recipe.  I think the butter could be cut in half though and still be just as tasty.  I have made this a couple of times with great results.  The last time I added avocado and chicken breast.  YUM!

i used rice wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar, used sesame oil in place of some of the butter in the "crunchies" section, used a package of pre-cut cabbage and carrot "cole slaw" mix (could have added another half package, i think),  and skipped the sesame seeds (forgot to buy them).  it was great, my family cleaned the bowl, just as others had predicted.  low kid rating, as ours are still super picky toddlers.

I've been making this for years! It's a favorite, however, I never used butter. I'm sure it's good, but kind  of unnecessary. The key is to wait until serving time to mix everything together, and you need a really big bowl!

It is a very good Asian Crunchy Salad but I made a few adjustments to suit my taste bud. I added the shredded carrots for the added color and better nutrition! I cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the soy sauce to 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons to suit my taste bud!

Made this recipe for a birthday celebration.  I made it as listed and received rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Mix it all together just before serving and its perfect. I don't think it needs any modification.  I really like the mildness and texture of the Napa Cabbage.  Thanks for making me look like a star and thanks for the great recipe.

I toast the crunchies in a skillet with butter instead of using the oven. I also use Oriental Ramen and sprinkle about half of the flavor pack into the dressing. I make it a main dish by mixing in some rotisserie chicken. This is absolutely my favorite salad ever.

A hit every single time. Bring the recipe with you because people will ask for it!  Tip: Stir the crunchies often and watch carefully. They can quickly go from perfect to burned because the almonds and sesame seeds cook differently than the ramen.

YUM1. This was just the recipe I was hoping for.  Followed recipe with a few small changes - Chopped the cabbage, Used 2 bags of ramen noodles, Browned the crunchies in the pan rather than oven.  Substituted a couple tablespoons of toasted sesame oil for some of the vegetable oil.  Next time I will try to lighten up by reducing some of the veg oil, although the dressing is really tasty as written.    Very flexible recipe.  Chicken or shrimp would be a great addition for a main dish meal.

I have been making  a similar salad for years but never thought of using Napa cabbage.  Thanks for the heads-up!  I have used green cabbage  or sometimes even romaine.  It all works.  Of course most of us make minor adjustments to recipes to suit our family tastes but no need to bore you with that.   This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband loved it.  I dry roasted the ramen noodles and almonds in a toaster oven at 350 for about 7 minutes until golden brown and used sunflower seeds instead of the sesame seeds. We made it a meal with rotisserie chicken. I definitely will make this again.

We love this salad.    When making just for the 2 of us, I don't mix  it up.   I just put some of the cabbage in individual salad bowls, top with almonds and ramen noodles the add dressing to each serving.   That way it does not get soggy.     The cabbage lasts for days in the fridge.

Delicious cabbage salad, with an Asian flair. Nice change from the regular Cole slaw. I only used half the green onions and about 2/3 the sugar called for, to suit my family's taste. Also, my oven was busy, so, I toasted the ramen, almonds and sesame seeds in a skillet, on the stove top, over medium-low heat until golden brown. That worked fine. Everybody enjoyed this salad very much !

Absolutely delicious!  Not only will I make it again, but over and over again!  Matter of fact, I think it would be nice to make a larger batch of "crunchies" and freeze them, as well as making a larger batch of dressing to keep in the fridge.  That way, the salad could be put together almost in a flash.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Everyone loved it!  Be sure to watch those crunchies in the oven!  lol

I made my crunchies and dressing earlier in the day and cut the cabbage and green onions fresh when ready, then combined.

I read the reviews and followed suit. I was trying to come up with a way to use up the 3/4 head of cabbage I had left. I added a couple stalks of celery to make up some of the difference. I reduced a lot of the topping, used about 4/5 package of ramen, only 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and 3 tbsp butter. As far as the dressing, I reduced the amount of oil a lot, only used 1/4 cup, Splenda equivalent of 1/4 cup of sugar, and almost 3 tbsp soy sauce as it was still way too sweet (probably bc I reduced the oil so much). I'll definitely do this recipe again! I followed someone else's advice and made the asian tuna patties I found on here along with the salad.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! Made it twice now. Once per original recipe and once with left over shredded turkey added and only 1/4c butter. Family likes it both ways. Will try adding some mandarin oranges next time. And those crunchies - yum! For some reason I haven’t mastered the dressing - maybe the Splenda I use instead of sugar - but it’s still delicious. Family used Trader Joe’s Spicy Peanut Dressing.

I used less oil, less (rice wine) vinegar, added a little sesame oil (didn’t have sesame seeds) and a little of the ramen seasoning to the dressing. I toasted the ramen and almonds in a dry pan on the stove with no butter at all (obviously trying minimize fat). They toasted nicely without any additional oil. Everything turned out perfectly. Oh, and I sprinkled some toasted sesame snacks on top when serving for some additional sesame flavor.

I made it exactly as stated. It was very good. Some thinly sliced green and red bell peppers would be amazing in this and give it some color. It's hard not to eat a lot of it. I will definitely be making it again. Thank you!

I make a big batch of this and take a portion to work each day, assembling right before I eat it. I sometimes add a cut up roasted piece of chicken. Delicious and filling.

I used rice vinegar instead of cider and sunflower seeds instead of almonds. Also added a touch of chili flakes to the dressing and carrots to the slaw. Very tasty, the dressing is much better than I expected.

This was a huge hit for our Father's Day BBQ!! We served it as a side dish to grilled steaks and corn on the cob.  I think adding cooked chicken to the salad would be a great summer meal.  We will be making this many more times in the future!  Thank you for the recipe!

The almonds and ramen were way too greasy. The butter flavor did not compliment the salad. I am going  to try another recipe that roast the nuts and ramen in a dry skillet. I will not make this recipe again.

A BIG Tupperware Fix n Mix bowl was just the right amount for six adults Sat evening!!  Everyone went back for third helpings plus along with a lovely pork tenderloin, sweet potatoes, jams and green beans with hazelnuts/lemon sauce.  The salad was delicious.  I used two pkgs of noodles and half the sugar called for.

I have made this recipe 5+ times for company since discovering it several months ago, and it's always a huge hit. Super easy to throw together, and the crunchy ramen noodles are the best part! Just the right amount of salty and sweet.

VERY good - be sure to only mix when ready to serve - we love extra crunchies on top too ! also great with some grilled chicken, can use 1/2 cabbage 1/2 romaine also for a little more of a "salad" than a slaw.

This is a great summer side for a BBQ. I make it a lot. Two tweaks that I like: add a dash of toasted sesame oil to the dressing and a squirt of mustard. The sesame oil adds a great Asian taste note, and the mustard helps emulsify the dressing so the oil doesn't separate, but doesn't really change the flavor much.

i did have to change it up, as thats just way too much sugar for this diabetic,  and i didnt have cider vinegar. i also added to it, but that seems to  people off, so i'll write that up as a new one, with credit to this. but it came out fantastic, i will certainly make it again! thanks for the inspiration! (i found this on youtube first, fyi)

I used Splenda instead of sugar, nixed the almonds (Hubby doesn't like them) and added finely chopped jalapeño and it turned out fantastic! Even better the next day!

I made it and ate leftovers for days...  Changes: I used red and green cabbage and shredded carrots as well as additional sesame flavor by using some sesame oil in the dressing. The rice vinegar was mango flavored which was very subtle, but good. Had some tender roast pork shoulder to top it off and make it a meal.

We mostly followed the recipe.  The exceptions were adding garlic, doubling the noodles (2 pkg worth) and decreasing the dressing amount (3/4 batch with half of recommended sugar used).  There was still a lot of dressing so we'll just make 1/2 the dressing recipe next time.  We'll also decrease the butter by 1/2 and toast the noodles for less time.

I have made ramen cabbage salads in the past and really love them.  I thought I would try this recipe since it got such high reviews, which quite frankly I don't understand.  I found the dressing to be entirely flavorless.  I made the recipe exactly as shown.  After I ate a few bites, I threw in some mandarin oranges and craisins to make it more appealing.  Even so, I have to say I won't be making this one again.

Delicious! I decreased the amount of oil and sugar in it, added a touch of sesame oil and rice vinegar, as well as using simple white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I also added in a dash of Ketjap manis, as well as the flavour package from the ramen into the dressing.  Instead of just almonds and sesame seeds in the crunchy bits, I included pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and cashews as well! It was a hit.

Have made this several times, always to rave reviews.  The last time some of the guests couldn't eat almonds so I substituted chopped dry roast peanuts and it was just as good.  It makes more than 6 servings - more like 10.

This is excellent. Next time, though, I'll reduce the oil and the butter as for me there's too much of those. I also threw in some cubed tofu (lightly sauteed and cooled).

Excellent dish - my mods - used canola instead of vegetable oil, went to 2 packs of ramen instead of one. Also used white vinegar instead of the cider vinegar. Dice some chicken and mix in to make it an entree rather than a side. I also mix the greens, crunchies, and dressing separately to my liking. This also makes for better leftovers rather than mixing all together and letting it sit.

Used sesame oil, rice vinegar. I'd like a little more sweet, so will add a bit more sugar next time.  Also, loved the toasted sesame and almond, but didn't think the ramen added much to the mix besides texture.

I love this salad but here are a few mods to make it easier and have more flavor: Instead of baking the crunchies, sauté them in a pan...that way you can continuously stir them without having to open the oven and lose heat. Also, we use 1-2 packets of the Ramen seasoning....usually chicken flavor but I'm sure beef would be good too. It's not exactly a "healthy" salad but it's delicious and a great treat for potlucks!

loved the crunchies!  Got a similar recipe from a friend- measurements slightly different- 2 bags cabbage, 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup oil, 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup cider vinegar.

Loved this recipe, I used Sesame Oil instead of veg oil, added carrots, radishes and cucumbers.  Also added Sunflower seeds to the crunchies.  Next time I will also add a can of mandarin oranges with a little bit of the juice.

Great salad.  I noted that it tasted better the next day after being refrigerated overnight. However,the cabbage was a bit softer and the crunchies less crunchie the next day. So maybe add the dressing to the cabbage and marinade overnight and add the crunchies just before serving.

I thought it was fabulous.  I added a little bit of the Laura Scudder's chunky peanut butter, maybe a tablespoon or two as well as a little cumin.  Gave it a little heat and depth.  This has sesame oil, the ramen spices, etc...  Made it better than other recipes I saw which were super basic.

Great salad. A real hit at my granddaughter's birthday party. I also used 2 packages of Ramen noodles and added about 6 chopped green onions. I did cheat on the dressing using Ken's Lite Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette. Lots of positive comments on this salad. Leave the pan mix separate till just before serving. It will cool and remain crunchy.

I thought this was tasty, but a little sweet. I found serving it alongside grilled chicken (using the asian ginger grill marinade from this site) worked very well. Whole family enjoyed it.  I did add shredded carrots, and part sesame oil/part vege oil, as someone else suggested.

Next time I'll add the seasoning packet instead of soy sauce. I personally did not like this, but gave it a 5 star since both my daughter and husband loved it!

I made this salad tonight for a quick meal for my husband and I...VERY GOOD!! I used the food processor to slice up the cabbage and this was ready in 15 minutes. I added 1/2 head of red cabbage, shredded and 1 medium red bell pepper, diced. Also added 1 cup of the preshredded "broccoli slaw" for the grocery store and tossed it all together. Excellent. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! Just made this for a potluck and got many requests for the recipe.  The only change I made was to use a pre-shredded cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage.  Would be tasty with chicken added too.

I have made this many times and it is awesome!! I add mandarin oranges because I love them and I also add part TOASTED Sesame oil with part vegetable oil. Toasted sesame oil is expensive but a little goes a long way and makes it taste great! Remember to get TOASTED sesame oil  and not just regular sesame oil. There is a big difference.

Hum, who knew ramen noodles could be in something so tasty!?!  This was a nice easy recipe that I can definitely see taking to outdoor events.  I used less oil (1/4 cup olive & 1/4 cup peanut)& only 1/2 cup sugar.  I used balsamic vinegar this time & might try rice wine vinegar the next time.  I love the crunch of this salad.

wow- this was really good.  i made some changes too -- to make it a little healthier, i lowered the oil in the dressing and added orange juice.  i also used a mix of nuts (they are for ice cream toppings - crushed peanuts, almonds, cashews and pecans) and cooked some chicken and threw that on the top too.  i bet this would work with a mix of cabbage, spinach and other greens.  i think you could throw some berries in there too.

I used a bag of tri colored already cut cole slaw and this salad was great!  My whole family loved it!  I have also made it without the sesame seeds and still loved it!

I didn't find it too salty at all.  What I did was poured the seasoning packet on the coleslaw and mixed it well.  This helps to macerate the coleslaw.

I toasted the almonds first, in a skillet over medium head until I could start to smell them.  Then I added twice the amount of sesame seed and a tablespoon of brown sugar until coated.  Remove the almonds just before you think they're perfect, because they'll continue cooking out of the skillet.  These puppies are H-O-T!

I also added just a teaspoon of fish sauce in to the oil dressing.  RR quote, "Just enough to make 'em go "hmmmm... what is that?""

When I served it, I completely forgot about adding the scallions.  Amazing, the entire thing was gone in a flash.  But next time, I'll remember the scallions.

I agree, this salad is wonderful, however, my husband and I have now adapted it to be healthier.  We took the origianl recipe and made some substitutions and now have this salad down to less than 200 calories a serving and very little fat.  It is so delicious and our changes made the taste even lighter so you can eat more if you want!

Really yummy salad.  I shredded the cabbage in my mini-food processor- not the easiest thing to do.  I wondered how other cooks prepare the cabbage?  A great summer lunch or dinner. Unique flavor.  A recipe to impress!!

We cannot get enough of this salad.  I normally double the amount of ramen and it is so good.  I get requests to make this everywhere I go.
