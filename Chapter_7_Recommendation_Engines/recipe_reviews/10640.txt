These cookies are a little crunchy on the edges, yet chewy.  A nice mix for us.  They are also nice because they are easy, use ingredients on hand, and don't have a lot of stuff in them (sometimes we need that around here for the kiddo!) My only "warning", and I use the term loosely, is that some people may find them too sweet.  It depends on your preference.  The caramel taste is subtle.  Again, good for us, maybe not what someone else is looking for.  Overall, we enjoyed them immensely.  I would recommend cutting the recipe in half and giving them a try!

I made a double batch of these a week or so before Christmas to go into my goodie boxes that I give every year.  They never lasted until I needed them.  Because they went so fast, I ended up making a triple batch right before Christmas so that I would have enought to go into my boxes.  These cookies are very easy and very declicious!!!  I will definitely make these numerous times.

Perfect and simple ice box cookie. It took 9 minutes in my oven to lightly crisp the edges leaving a chewy center. Thanks so much for sharing this gem.

I love these cookies. I would only change 2 things; I would add toffee bits and I would leave out the nutmeg -you can hardly taste it and it dodesn't need to be there.
