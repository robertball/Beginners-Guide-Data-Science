Amended this slightly- did not use the cottage cheese. Also put the apples in the middle with honey, raisins, and grated carrot.

Not a big fan of the Endive lettuce I guess. Too bitter.  I loved the dressing though.

WOW. Searching around for watercress recipes, this is new for me! Had no cottage cheese, dont like it much anyway. Doubled the garlic, ran it thru my press; used Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar because it is THE best! No walnut oil, but I DID have hazelnut oil! Fresh ground pepper, Pink Himalayan Sea Salt (very chunky). Love endive, but only had fresh redleaf lettuce and lacinto kale, so chopped it all up, delish. Used a Honeycrisp apple, they are so crispy. Watercress (at least this fresh pile I have here) is so incredibly bitter/peppery, I just love it! Detoxing or not, this salad was a refreshing change worthy of company, especially with a hot-summer rich meat, like Smoked Salmon or Babyback Ribs. This recipe is one of the best I have ever experienced on AR. Will take a photo next time! Thank you!

The Belgian endive combined with the apples and watercress was a good combination. However the salad dressing was a bit underwhelming. We all found the raw garlic taste overpowering, and we LOVE garlic. You really couldn't taste the flavor of the walnut oil or the vinegar at all, just garlic. It might be better if you saut√©ed the garlic before adding it to the dressing. If I make this again, I think that I would try this, or maybe make a different dressing entirely. I'm truly at a loss as how all the other reviewers loved this dressing so much.

Didn't expect that I would like the dressing all that much, boy was I wrong. A good flavor and texture it worked beautifully with the apples.
