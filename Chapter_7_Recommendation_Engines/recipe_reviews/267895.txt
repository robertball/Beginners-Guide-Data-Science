I only had white sweet potatoes and I used molasses instead of maple syrup because that is what I had on hand.  It was very good.  Some of my potatoes got "mashed" while others were chunky but that's my fault for not making them the same size.   I did saute for about 5 minutes when done to thicken it a bit but, otherwise it was very good and fast!  I will definitely be doing this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I loved it! The only thing I didn't have was maple syrup so I used pancake syrup.
