This is delicious! I made it last night and it turned out great; not a crumb left over! I did read the reviews ahead of time and knew to cook the potatoes a bit before adding them. I also added a bag of frozen peas and carrots and skipped the mushrooms. The other reviewers are correct that it makes WAY too much filling for the crust recipe provided, especially if you add extra vegetables. Do yourself a favor and double the dough so you can make two of these yummy pies! In preparation for a birthday party where I'm serving my son's favorite meals as appetizers, I actually made miniature pies in my muffin pans and ended up with six pies. They baked perfectly in the time and temperature for the regular pies and turned out great as cute little individual pies that popped right out onto the platter!

Oh, MAN!  Goooooood stuff!  I steamed the carrots and celery first, boiled the potatoes in the broth and then used it for the sauce so it was even thicker and I added some frozen peas and brushed the inside of the bottom crust and the outside of the top crust with beaten egg white to make sure they didn't get soggy.  This recipe is going on an index card and into my box, which is high praise.

Truely fantastic recipe! I agree that the filling is enough for almost two pies, so cut back on the broth and flour. I used the called for amounts of veggies, but added an extra cup of chicken and some peas and broccoli.

Here's what i did to solve the crunchy veggy problem: i boilied the raw chicken tenderlions in the chicken broth for about 10 min, then added the potatoes and carrots and cooked for another 5-7 min until they softened a bit. then i took the chicken out of the broth and used a large straining spoon to get the potatoes and carrots out, and poured the broth into the butter mixture and followed the recipe from there, adding 1/2 cup of whole milk at the end.

And to solve the soggy bottom crust problem, i found the PERFECT cure! I used Pilsbury crust and put it in the oven while preheating. About 3 min after it had heated to 400, i took it crust out of the oven and let it cool for just a few minutes. Then i brushed egg whites on it (and on the top crust). Not at all soggy on the bottom - PERFECT!!

The only other modification i would make to the recipe is to use one potato to cut back on the filling. Or, perhaps it's possible to freeze/refridgerate the leftover filling to use later with some buttermilk biscuits?? yummy!

Ps - although i have once added a teeny bit of rosemary, i don't recommend it. cooking the chicken in the broth and adding the whole milk added that slight extra bit of flavor that i will now never try to change! Enjoy! :)

Very good pot pie. My family loves it. I did use a Pillsbury crust to cut down on time. I also boiled the carrots, celery and potatoes in the broth for about 7 minutes. I was concerned that they wouldn't be cooked enough if I didn't boil them first. Also, I make a double batch each time so I can freeze the pot pie filling for another day. I just thaw it and put it in a crust and bake. This recipe is definitely a good one.

I followed this to a "T".  cut potatoes into 1/4" - 3/8" cubes.  They definitely were not done.  I recommend par-boiling them.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The 2nd time I made it I tried to skip making the crust and used a ready made pie crust. It wasn't nearly as good as this pie crust. Also I sauteed all the vegetables before adding them to the flour mixture so they weren't as crunchy in the final product. Excellent!

Wow!!  This pot pie is AWESOME!!  So easy and delicious!  I used a premade crust, added a little extra onion and used 3 cups water plus 3 chicken boullion cubes in place of the broth, but the flavor was still supurb!  I didn't have a pie tin, so I used a deep square baking dish and make mine "deep dish" style, which works pretty well and keeps the crust from overriding the flavor of the filling.  My guests, husband, and children all wolf this down -- its perfect!!

I thougt it was very good. I did cook the potatoes and carrots before I baked the pie. I just added them into the chicken broth and let them cook just until them started to soften. I left out the mushrooms because no one in my family likes them that good and I didn't have and celery but I think it still turned out very good. I did add some spices to the broth for flavor.  I will use this recipe again for sure!

This was very good, very easy for me to make.  Alas, I didn't read the reviews before tackling it, and my potatoes were hard. u.u;  Next time, I'll boil them.  I also had to add a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce, but it was very delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  My son raved about it and has been requesting it since I made it last week for the first time.  I used leftover roasted chicken that I flavored with garlic, onion, celery etc. and I also used the broth from that chicken.  The gravy for the pie was delicious and just the right thickness.  No gooey canned soup that tastes processed.  I cooked the veggies and potatoes in the broth for a bit to soften them.  Only one thing I will mention regarding the crust, after about 4 TBS of water, just add one at a time.  You will need more or less depending on the humidity in the air.

This was amazing! My husband who does not like chicken pot pie and tried to talk me out of making it, had 3 helpings.  Because other users mentioned it made a lot of filling, I used my deep dish pie pan and it worked great.  Also I cooked my pototoes and carrots with the onion in a little bit of safflower oil at the mention from several users that the potatoes weren't quite done. This is a wonderful recipe that my entire family enjoyed and will be made many more times.

I liked this recipe because of it's simplicity, but spiced it up a bit with fresh rosemary and a little lemon juice and grated provalone to the sauce. Also I added some garlic and yum yum!

this is SO good! I was so happy that I was able to make a dairy-free chicken pot pie! I substituted the butter for olive oil, and it turned out great. I also sauted the potato cubes in olive oil until they were almost soft, and they were crispy and brown on the outside. It's worth the extra effort, in my opinion! I left out the mushrooms (yuck) and also added garlic. I took other reviewers advice and put the filling into 2 pies... which I regretted. they were too skimpy, and I don't think it's way too much filling for 1 pie, like others said. Maybe that's personal preference, or maybe I used smaller potatoes, carrots, etc? don't know... but either way.. it's SO good and doesn't turn out runny or soggy. mmmm

This was the best Pot Pie i've ever had! I used Pillsbury Pie Crust and put egg whites on both the top and bottom and followed the directions of another reviewer and added 1/2 C milk to the broth. Cant wait to make this again!

Crust was great!  Overall a very good recipe.  I feel I need to point out that anytime a roux is involved it's full thickening potential is not realized until you have let it boil for a few minutes.  I allowed mine to boil while I simmered a half cup of heavy cream.  I added the cream to the soup.  I let this simmer a few minutes more, until it coated the back of my wooden spoon.  I think the cream did wonders for the pot pie.  I felt I was back in my Grandmother's Southern kitchen!  Delicious!

This was excellent!  I know how frustrating it is for people to tweak recipes and then rate them, but I did make a few "enhancements" because of what I had on hand...I had sweet potatoes instead of white, and in place of mushrooms I tossed in broccoli, right before adding everything to the pie crust.  I also added some chopped garlic, sage and thyme to the sauce.  I may add some frozen peas next time.  This did make a lot of filling -- I used about half to fill the crust and froze the rest for another chilly night.

This was absolutely delicious!! I followed the receipe very closely. Left out the mushroom and celery and put in peas instead. The flavor of the filling was the best! I used pre-made pie crusts which were good. The only problem I encountered was that the gravy seemed to dry out during baking. I'll try more broth in the gravy next time. And, I had more filling than my 9" deep dish pie crust would hold. But, that's not a bad thing!Next time i think I'll try individual pies so I can take them to work for lunch. This is definitely a keeper!!

first time making this... was sooooooo good! used premade pie crust - will make my own next time just to compare if it makes a difference with the outcome.  it was still good as pillsbury makes a great pie crust! left out mushrooms (for my son) but he may lose that battle next time it would have added a great flavor.  the sauce is so good.  we barely have any left over!  I used a small casserole oval shape dish and used up all the filling.  I could see where you would be able to make two pies out of this if you used pie pans.  To sum it up 5 big stars, will make again and again for sure!!

Love this chicken pot pie! Having said that, I have learned to parboil my celery, carrots and potatoes. No matter how small you chop them, they are still crunchy if you don't. Also, I usually use a store bought crust, just don't have the time/desire to make my own most of the time. Finally, to cut down a bit on fat, I will just use a top crust sometimes too. Just made one with some leftover turkey I had frozen and it was DELISH!

This is by far the best recipe I have tried so far on this site. Absolutely delicious, authentic, comforting, homemade goodness! I used puff pastry instead of making the crust but other than that, changed nothing. Try this, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for sharing!!

Good recipe, except make sure everything is cooked BEFORE you put it in the pie - other than that it's a good recipe.  I half-cooked my potatoes in the microwave but they didn't get cooked further, and the carrots stayed crunchy.  I sauteed the onions, two cloves garlic, and the celery together before mixing with the flour etc.

Furthermore I recommend blind-baking the bottom pastry crust before adding the filling to make sure it's cooked too.  (I used store-bought puff pastry).

Lastly I think the recipe will benefit from addition of herbs such as thyme and rosemary but I guess this is according to each person's taste.

YUM! My husband loved it, especially the crust.  I used "smart-balance" shortening in place of the lard (health preference) and took the advice of another reviewer to brush the top and bottom crusts w/beaten egg so that the crusts wouldn't be too soggy.  I also took the advice of other reviews and boiled the veggies & potatoes in the broth for a few minutes, which made it nice and thick.  And for an extra health boost, I replaced half the flour w/whole wheat in the crust (the other half was unbleached all purpose).  This was great for my family because I needed a pot pie recipe that did not use the cream based soups (son is lactose intolerant), or a premade pie crust (they usually contain bleach, which my family doesn't do either).  All in all, its definately a keeper, and extremely filling!

A favorite of mine!  I use my own pie crust recipe. Definitely boil the cubed potatoes for a few minutes to soften, so they're done when the rest of the pie is.  I sometimes substitute peas for the celery.  Overall a fantastic recipe.  Great comfort food.

LOVE THIS RECIPE BUT MADE ALOT OF CHANGES FOR THE ADDED FLAVOR THAT I AM USED TO:  Sauteed Chicken in Olive Oil, Garlic, Salt, Pepper, H'erb de Provence and then butter at the end for added flavor. Sauteed Veggies in butter, salt, pepper, Garlic for added flavor.  For the Sauce - I Melted the Butter, added minced onions until carmelized, added flour and stirred until cooked, added salt, pepper and slowly added chicken stock until thickened.  For the Crust: I substituted the Shortening for Butter and it came out so nice and flaky (Yum). I also Brushed the Top Crust with Egg Whites for it's lovely coloring on top. If you use a bottom crust first brush on egg whites and then bake for a few minutes first before adding filling so that it isn't soggy in the end.

Perfect for gifting a meal as well!

This is a great pot pie recipe. I'll be making it again for sure. My husband was very excited to hear this is what we were having for dinner last night, and sure enough, he loved it!! The only thing I changed was I omitted the mushrooms by personal preference. It worked out good because with the rest of the ingredients it was a VERY full pie! Delicious!!!!

This one is a keeper- a classic pot pie taste.  The crust recipe is delish.  Double the crust, because there will be just enough filling for two pies.  I added peas instead of mushrooms and boiled raw, cubed chicken breasts with the veggies (minus the peas) for about 15-20 mins like in Chicken Pot Pie IX.  Then used the liquid for the broth, and didn't even need any bouillon to boost the flavor.

Fantastic version of an old classic. Chicken Pot Pie is my wifes all time favorite comfort food. After eating this recipe, she has informed me that it has to be this one from now on. I also recommend simmering the pototoes and carrots in the sauce for about 10 minutes before pouring in the crust.

This recipe is a delicious dish to serve as comfort food. It is going in my favorite recipes. I made it for my family last night. I read the other reviews and precooked the vegetables as suggested. I also added peas and omitted the mushrooms. Instead of making one large pie, I used Rachel Ray's individual ceramic baking pans.  The filling and crust was enough to fill and top six bakers. My family loved it!

I made this to a t the first time how can you rate a recipe if you change it.2cnd time i did not have a 9inch pie plate so i used an 9x9inch pan added some oregano and some peas and threw in some cheddar cheese I had leftover about half a cup. this is wayyyyyyyy to much filling for one pie as others have said so make two pie crusts.My roommate tried this for the first time and said hes never moving out.Hes not used to homemade cooking so ive done spoiled him.A definate try if this is your first time.Alot of work but if followed will come out good.and the crust is the key make sure to use lard makes it so flaky and easy to work with.I use the pie crust recipe anytime i need one for a fruit pie.

EXCELLENT!! Crust was awesome using Crisco. I followed others advice & decreased chix & broth to 2cup. I sprinkled chix w/ Adobo seasoning before i sauteed. I also cooked veggies half way & added chopped leek & peas to the pan. I used small baby carrots. I didnt have a pie plate so i used a 13x9 glass pan. This recipe would be fine using the full 3c. of chix & broth if you use the large pan. I just made a layer of crust on the bottom & top. DELICIOUS!!

Really really good chicken pie. - which is one of my favorite feel good meals.  I use Grandma's secret pie crust recipe - off this site (because it's the only pie crust recipe I can make.  I followed this recipe to the "T" except I didn't add mushrooms.  It was really good!

Just for the filling - I keep cheating on the crust because I'm not much of a baker. I parboil the potatoes and carrots and saute the other veggies  separately with some garlic. Then I make the roux, add the stock with some milk or cream, and add the veggies and chicken back in with frozen peas and corn. Then, it becomes 5 stars.

This was delicious.  Only problem I had is that I used ready made pie crusts and you need to transfer these crusts to a regular pie dish (as opposed to the aluminum one it comes in) because there is too much filling for the ready made one.  Also, it was difficult to get out of the pan without falling apart...a little juicy.

Very good, as others have said there is too much filling.  I was really surprised how flavorfull it was.  I used Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust recipe, as a short cut, which was great.

YUM... I love that this recipe didn't use any "cream of soups"... I did purchase the pie crust because I stink at rolling out pie dough!  For the chicken I boiled 4 thighs along with celery, carrot, onion, bay leaf, garlic,  salt & pepper to make my own stock.  I strained it and used the cooked carrots; added "cooked" green beans and potatoes...  Super de duper!  :)  Message to self:  1/2 the roux ingredients, add potatoes and filling to roux, keep on low heat, add 1 tsp. rubbed sage, 1/4 tsp. thyme then add enough broth until desired thickness.  Freeze remaining stock when cooled.

I made this recipe yesterday for my husband and a couple of friends, and they raved about it.  It was the first chicken pot pie i've ever made (let alone from scratch).  And it was relatively simple and quick.  I followed some of the review suggestions by pre-cooking the potatoes, and it turned out perfect. 

Instead of cooking it in a pie plate, I used a large round casserole dish and made one large pot pie, and I had no troubles with having too much filling as some of the other reviewers had. It was awesome!

I have made pot pie with biscuit mix topping for many years but this was very first attempt to make one from scratch.  From the pie crust to the flavor of the gravy inside and to the fresh potatoes and carrots, this was by far the best pot pie I have had in ages. I am not a huge celery lover so I omitted the celery and added some peas.  Result was still outstanding!!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

My whole family loved it -- that says a lot!  I want to start by saying YES, make two crusts so as not to waste the extra filling you are bound to have.  Also, for the undercooked potato problem, after I sauteed the mushrooms I added a bit of olive oil to the pan and sauteed the potatoes for a few minutes to start the cooking process.  I did not have any fresh carrots or celery, so I used frozen veggies.  I just threw them in the skillet after I sauteed the potatoes and heated them with the mushrooms and potatoes before adding it all to the yummy gravy!  I added some of the stock from boiling the chicken to the gravy to thin it just a bit and simmered it with the veggies a few minutes before putting it in the crust!  The only REAL addition I made to the recipe was to throw in some fresh thyme and fresh cracked pepper.  I thought it needed just a little something. My other changes were made just because I really wanted the recipe and didn't have the fresh veggies on hand!  Great recipe and certainly a "keeper" in my hubby's book!

This recipe is absolutely incredible.  You are doing a disservice to yourself if you don't make the crust from scratch because it is so delicious and completely worth the effort.  I took the advice from others and halved the amount of filling and it still made more than enough.  I also baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes prior to filling it and brushed the top with an egg wash.  Also, you have to saute the vegetables (especially the potatoes) for about 5 or 6 minutes prior to putting them in the pie or else they won't be done.  Make sure you bake it on a cookie sheet or else you'll have a mess in the oven because it bubbles over.  It was the first time I'd ever made chicken pot pie from scratch and everyone was really impressed and wanted the recipe.

Made this last night for dinner on the spur of the moment and it was great. Of course, being spur of the moment, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I know, I know...you should follow a recipe as written the first time, then make changes. But I went ahead and made changes the first go round. First, I used a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust because that's what I had on hand. I also left out the mushrooms. And I cooked the veggies first before putting them into the pie. I chopped 1/2 cup of onion and sauteed that with the carrots, celery and potato (I only used one potato). I cooked the carrots and potato in a bit of butter and started those first, since they take longer to get soft. I cooked them about 10 minutes, then added the onion and celery and cooked another five minutes until everything was soft. I added in the chicken, which I'd sauteed in another skillet. I threw in a handful of frozen peas at the end. Then I made the roux as written with butter and flour, but left out the onions since I had put those in the veggie mix. I didn't have chicken broth on hand, but I had chicken bouillon, so I put in 1-1/2 large cubes of chicken bouillon in the three cups of water and added that to the roux. I didn't salt the gravy since I had already used the bouillon. I put in 1/4 tsp of ground thyme, 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning and 1/4 tsp of ground sage and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. I mixed that gravy into the chicken and veggies and poured everything into my deep dish pie plate

This was fantastic! My hubby had 3 helpings. I cooked 2 frozen Costco chicken breast in my crock pot with 5 cups water, 3 chicken bullions and 3 whole cloves of garlic. While it was cooking i steamed the potatoes and carrots and put in fridge. I think cooling the potatoes helped keep them from breaking up  when it was all mixed with the sauce. The sauce is amazing. I actually used the broth from the crockpot- I only used 2 cups of broth and then one cup of water- it is important to taste here to judge how salty you like it. I actually cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp since the broth was salty enough. I used pilsbery pie crust and precooked it for 5 minutes on 400 with a wash of egg. I also put an egg wash on the top crust which gave it a beautiful shiney finish.

I adore hearty, homemade meals, and this pot pie was just that! I chose to make little, individual pot pies, and I had so many left over ( I doubled the recipe) that I froze quite a few and passed them on to friends and family, who raved about them! I sauted the veggies until soft, and pre-cooked the potatoes before adding them. I used a different pastry recipe (a favorite out of my personal recipe collection) and it turned out thick and delicious with a flaky crust that was to die for! I crimped the edges of each crust and slashed the top to let steam escape.  They looked like perfect little pies, and they tasted that way too!! A definite favorite!

This is a great pot pie recipe.  I used leftover Easter turkey, sweet potatoes, peas, onions, mushrooms and rosemary - very good.  I also put it in a casserole and used puff pastry over the top - quick and yummy.  Thanks for the post!

This was a really good recipe!  I used shortening in the dough rather than lard (ew!)- and it really did turn out flaky.  I thought potatoes in the mixture would be weird, and it was a little bit, but I would make this again.  The first step I took for the filling was to saute the onions, carrot, celery and potatoes with the lid on and a sprig of rosemary (which I later removed) until they were soft.  I spooned the filling into 6 individual gratin dishes and covered them with the dough, letting it overlap the sides (instead of making a bottom crust).  I used a small heart cookie cutter to create the vent.  They turned out so cute!  Thanks!

very tasty!!  Im a fan of veggies and used a couple extra stalks of celery, an extra carrot and 2 large baking potatoes which made alot of filling (probably enough for 2 pies by the time I added the chicken).  Since ther ewas so much left, I made extra gravy (the butter, flour chicken broth mixture) added it to the left over filling and it made a creamy soup.  the soup is just as delicious!!  Unfortunately I didnt have time to make the pie crust, I bought a pie crust premade.  Next time I will be sure to make the pie crust mentioned in the recipe (and will add parsley like someone mentioned. seems like a good combination).  thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  I will not be buying Marie Callender's chicken pot pie 'cause now I can make it myself.  I followed the recipe except I used another pie crust that I have liked, but I am sure this crust recipe is as good as the filling.  I did add 2 tablespoons of cream to give it a bit of added "whiteness," and I added half box of frozen peas/carrots to the mix.  Overall, my husband loved this and so did I!! Thanks Wendy L.!

Great recipe! I've made it a few times and it's been a hit each time!
I am, however, guilty of making changes. I use refrigerated pie crust (I find it tastes just fine and such a time saver!). I saute the onion with the mushrooms, I add a few cloves of garlic and a sprinkle of dried thyme.  After the chicken broth/flour/butter come to a boil I add a 1/2 cup of heavy cream (at room temp), makes it extra creamy and rich! I also par boil the potatoes and carrots and add frozen peas.  When I am short on time I buy a roasted chicken from the grocery store and shred the meat to use in the pie, the chicken is so flavorful and juicy! 
I make individual servings and only put crust over the tops b/c my dishes are a bit shallow and a double crust would be to much for me and my family.

This is amazing...I used a Betty Crocker pie crust boxed mix...This worked well...It is important to cook the vegetables before placing in pie shell...I cooked them in the chicken broth.  These were the only changes I made...We really loved this.  Flavor is wonderful and contains much less sodium than pot pies available in the store.  Note...I have made a couple of times since writing the above review...I made the crust according to the directions with this recipe and it turned out really well.

I made this recipe and it was wonderful. I Did cook the veg. and others commented on.. I would also recommend this step.. 

  I also added some extra spice to the recipe.. I had never made home made crust.. This was also a plus.. Now I am hooked and I am going to make some beef pot pies.. 

I also cooked the bottom shell till it was lightly brown.. I made small dishes with the left over filling and pie crust.. These were the best.. Just a top crust.. Cooked them at work for 3 days in a row.. 
I would make the gravy  double next time I cook this.  But it is a 5 star recipe in opinion.

Thanks for sharing...

Fantastic. I used Kroger's premade pie crust to save on time and had to add some extra flour to the gravy to get it to thicken. Next time I think I will use steam in the bag frozen veggies to save time chopping.

I precooked the veggies first, added a dash of garlic powder and used refrigerated pie crust. It was hearty, meaty and divine. We couldn't finish it tonight, sure hope it reheats well. This a keeper everybody!

I have made this several times and it has turned out perfect each time.  I have made it with beef too.  I saute the cubed beef and then add it to my mixture using beef broth instead of chicken.  Then I let the mixture cook on the stove for about 15 minutes then pour into the pie crust and let it cook as directed.  It had turned out great that way too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good taste. However, the potatoes were not nearly cooked. I had to cover the entire pie and cook for an additional 20 minutes.

This gave me a good starting point. I made a lot of changes. No onions, or mushrooms. Used red potatoes, baby carrots and peas. I pre cooked everything. I also brushed the crust with egg whites. I also made enough filling and crust for 2 pies.

This was sooo good!  A slam dunk all the way around.  I used a store bought pie crust as I cant make one to save my life, and it made a huge deep dish pie with filling left over.  Next time I will make 2 smaller pies.  Also threw in a handful of frozen peas.  Perfect!  Hubby requested that I make it again...

This is a really good recipe.  My preference (for the potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and mushrooms) is to saute' them together in olive oil, then sprinkle the flour over the vegetables, slightly browning/cooking the flour and then whisk in the liquid to make the sauce.   I also added ground bay leaf (Penzey's) to the seasonings.  To cook the chicken, I use boneless, skinless, organic fed chicken, drizzled  with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and cook in a 350 degree oven until done.  After the chicken is cooled, shred the chicken in medium size pieces with two forks.   The flavor of the chicken is exquisite and no square chunks.  When putting the pie together, I never use a bottom crust.  Put the vegetables/sauce mixture in greased pan/Pyrex, add frozen green peas and chicken, top with crust...making a design or slits in crust to let steam escape.  Bake the left over pie crust as crackers and serve with.

I simply love recipes that are made from scratch.  There is nothing more rewarding than knowing every single ingredient that went into your dish.  I had left over chicken from the night before and was looking for a use for it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the addition of some thyme, sage, and rosemary.  Just tasting the roux, I knew this was going to be a tasty dish.  I cubed the potatoes and used the mandoline on a fine slice for the carrots, sauteed them with the herbs and added to the roux along with the chicken.  I didn't have any problems with the potatoes being uncooked nor the quantity of pie filling as others had experienced.  If you have the time, you should really follow the recipe for the pie crust.  It was very light and flaky. A very fine dish.  Thank you for this delicious, made from scratch, recipe.

I followed this recipe very closely and it came out fantastic! Like the others, I noticed that it did make a ton of filling, way more than one crust can fill. No worries though, it won't go to waste. Next time I may add some herbs and garlic, but it really is an exceptional recipe on its own. Also, the crust was very tasty and so easy - do yourself a favor and dont use a cardboard store-bought crust for this. Making your own crust is ridiculously simple.

This recipe was tasty, especially the crust.  I ended up using butter flavored shortening instead of lard, and the crust was still delicious.  I have also substituted turkey for chicken with excellent results.  Another change I made was that I substituteda cup of frozen peas and carrot for the fresh carrots and celery. 

The only complaint I have is that this recipe does made WAY too much filling for the pie.  However, before making this recipe I remember this complaint among other users, and used only 2 cups of broth and 2 cups of chicken with great results.

To save time I used refrigerated pie crusts. I added some minced garlic, dried dill and poultry seasoning because the sauce seemed bland. Also, the first time I made this the sauce was too thin and I had way more than I needed to fill the pie. The second time I cut the broth to 2 cups, which worked out better. I also let the pie rest for about 20 minutes after baking which makes it firmer and easier to serve. My family and friends really like this recipe.

Fantastic Recipe!  The only changes I made were to make the Best Ever Pie Crust from the Allrecipes site because I didn't have lard, added a little extra chicken boullion granules and salt to the gravy mixture.  I also boiled frozen chicken breasts to make the broth used in the recipe.  The crust was flaky and the filling was hearty and tasty!  Thank you for sharing!

Super recipe!! My husband loved it and would probably eat it every night if I would make it!  I did find the vegetables a little too crunchy and will par boil them for a few minutes in some of the chicken broth in the future. I also added about a cup of frozen peas to the recipe. I used premade pie crusts as well and it turned out just fine! Thanks for a super recipe.

Easy to make and delicious to eat.  My first attempt at a pot pie, and it was great.

This recipe is great! My first time making pot pie and it came out AWESOME! I personally love the crust for every bite, so i used a six pack of mini pie tins instead of making one large one. By doing this, I used all of my filling and did not have any left over like most of the reviews stated. I also doubled my pie crust ingredients, which i had enough left over for two more small pies. My chicken i cut into cubes and seasoned with garlic salt, basil & pepper and sauteed in butter in a frying pan. I also boiled my potatoes just enough so they were easy to cut into. Making the filling for the pie I followed directions but i let my carrots and celery cook for about 5 minutes before adding my chicken, just to avoid the chance of them to still be a little crunchy when i put them to bake. I added the potatoes last for about 3minutes just so they did not get soggy. I also added about 1-2 tsp of cornstarch- i like my filing a little thicker than what it was from the directions. I also used egg whites to glaze the top of each pie which made them a beautiful color on top. Cooking time was accurate about 30min, & I let them cool about 5-10. This is a perfect recipe for made-from-scratch chicken pot pie. I will definitely make this again in the future and have already bragged to my family members on  how beautiful and delicious it tasted! Newly Wed Wives this is PERFECT to show off for your Husband. Nothing says I love you more than hard work in the kitchen ;) making food from scratch!!

Awesome!  A recipe that doesn't rely on condensed soup to make the sauce.  I sauted the chicken breasts, de glazed the pan and then browned the veggies slightly in the same pan.  It adds yummy depth of flavor.  I made the roux in the same pan, perfect!

I made this a couple of months ago. It was out of this world! The only thing I did was to add more carrots and leave out the mushrooms because not all of us like mushrooms in my family. Next time I'm going to add some green beans, peas and maybe corn and stretch it to three small pies rather than one pie

Absolutely wonderful! I used my own pastry though but followed the rest of the recipe.  It made quiet alot of filling so I think I'll half the chicken and vegetables next time. Will definately be using this recipe again!

I made the pate brisee recipe that Martha Stewart uses (with butter - it's by far my fav) but used the recipe for the filling, and it turned out SO GOOD.  I've never been a fan of chicken pot pie, but my husband loves it, so one night, I thought I'd give this one a try.  I will never eat another chicken pot pie again unless I make it using this recipe!

Omigosh!!! Is all i can say about this recipe. Everything about it is perfect. I did read the other reviews before making it, so i did make a few changes. I cooked the potatoes before adding them in.I also used corn and peas in the place of mushrooms and celery. Added a little poultry seasoning. Amazing!?I agree with other reviewer, you will have left over filling. I just ate that by itself!! So good!

This makes the best pot pie I have ever had!  I use a frozen pie shell and a refrigerated crust for the top.   It is so flaky and tender and the filling is so good I think about it for days.  I have made this twice now and think that I would like to try it with beef.  Substituting the chicken stock with beef and the chicken with left over pot roast or stew meat.  I don't use celery in this recipe as I tend to pick up a sour flavor, but that's just me as I find that whenever I have celery that's been cooked.   And I LOVE the addition of the mushrooms!  Thank you for posting this recipe, it is the only one I will use.

This was *delicious*. I followed the recommendations from BAMBARBIE and L Sacher. I used a crust recipe from Joy of Cooking, which was actually very close to the one in this recipe, but didn't really roll out very well... maybe it needed more time to chill? Regardless, it ended up being very tasty & flaky. I pre-baked the crusts for a few minutes and brushed on egg whites to the insides of the base and both sides of the top. I omitted the mushrooms (my own preference), added a little bit more onion to the roux, steamed the carrots and celery, and boiled the potatoes in the broth for ~6 minutes. I also used bouillon cubes to make the broth. I agree, the filling this recipe makes could fill 2 pies... not a bad thing, though! I made a pie, 3 tiny pies in a muffin tin, and froze the rest of the filling. Quite a few modifications are necessary to improve the recipe... but a good base recipe nonetheless! Chicken pot pie at its finest.

Great recipe.  I used the Pillsbury crust.  I cooked my chicken breasts for about 10 minutes in a mixture of vegetable broth and chicken broth and then added the carrots and potatoes and cooked for an additional 5-7 minutes, like another reviewer suggested.  I then removed the chicken and veggies from the broth and then added it to the butter/flour mixture (added some water to bring it to 3 cups of fluid).  I omitted the celery.  I had enough filling for 2 pies. Yummy!

This was my first attempt at pie crusts in general, not to mention pot pie, and this recipe worked perfectly!  I added frozen peas and used rotisserie chicken, and I did have a fair amount of leftover filling that can be eaten as a stew.  Raves from my guests on the final result!

I loved this.  I never thought it would be so easy to get that comfort food feeling!!  MMMM!!  I pre-sauteed the veggies......did not use mushrooms.  I boiled the chicken to almost done....I pre-baked the crust for about 6 minutes, as with another review, I brushed on some egg whites, and I did the top of the crust too!  I loved this pot pie, I was weary at first, the filling did not smell as tasty as it REALLY was when it was all complete and baked in the pie!  TRY THIS!  It is delisious!

There must have been a step left out of this recipe.  The carrots and potatoes should have been pre-cooked, because when I pulled this pie out of the oven (after having it in there for 10 extra minutes) the potatoes and carrots were still completely raw.  I was SOOO disappointed because other than that, it was really tasty.

One of the best meals I've ever had. Wonderful comfort food. The only reason I gave it a 4 not a 5 was that I wish I would have listened to the reviews and pre-cooked the potatoes a little. I baked my pie for about 10 extra minutes as it didn't look done, and the potatoes and carrots were a little crunchy still.

I didn't use the "guts" of this recipe, just the recipe for the crust. I followed it exactly & it turned out horrible. I've made my own pie crusts before & they've turned out fine. Not sure what happened but it was ok rolling it out but when I tried transfering it it just crumbled everywhere. UGH!!! Tell me what I did wrong!!! :)

Very good recipe. I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and doubled the amount of the roux b/c I like my pot pies to be very creamy. It fit perfectly in a 9 1/2 " glass pie plate. Thanks for the great recipe!

The best chicken pot pie recipe EVER!  I make two pies, double the pie crust.  I make one for my family and then let the mixture cool before making the other pie.  Then I freeze it for later. Then I just set it out the night before to defrost. I recommend using this crust, its what makes the pie so delicious. My family, and company, request this dish more than any other.  I would give it 10 stars!!!!

Fantastic. I did not use a pie crush however. I topped it in a dish with Stove Top stuffing and baked till topping was crisp. Was exceptional. Wife and Daughter just loved it.

I love this recipe and so does my husband.  I do add some frozen peas and green beans to the mix and usually use pre-made Pilsbury pie shells to save time and it always turns out perfect.  I agree that there is always extra filling so you can cut back a little on the ingredients.  I also add a little fresh parsley, marjoram and thyme and simmer the potatos, celery and carrots in the sauce for bit prior to placing filling in the shell.  I use a deep-pie dish in order to use more filling and still have leftovers.  I did have to bake a little longer and adjust temperature.  I bake at 400 for the first 15 min. then turn down to 375 and bake for another 35 min. and the veggies come out perfectly tender.  I will make this over and over and probably try it with beef and maybe even baby shrimp and scallops.

Yum!!  I was concerned about the veggies not being done, so after adding them to the mushrooms (I used crimini) I let them cook for a few minutes.  I had no problems with them not being done after the cooking time.  I did have about a cup of extra filling.  Oh, and I used the refrigerated Pillsbury crusts to cut down on some time.  The pot pie tasted fantastic!

Awesome! I cooked this recipe for some family, it got rave reviews everyone loved it. I left out the mushrooms and added frozen peas and a bit more onion. I also cooked my raw veggies half-way. It was simple and turned out moist with a nice texture. I will definitely use it again. Thanks.

This was excellent.  The only thing I did differently was that I used my old standby crust recipe.  I was asked for the recipe and will definitely make again.

This made the most fantastic pot pie.  My only changes was adding 1 teaspoon of dried herbs and 1/2 cup of finely shredded cheddard cheese for a flavor boost. Prebake the bottom crust for about 8-10 minutes so it does not get soggy during baking.

Sooo delish!  I didn't have a pre-made pie crust and didn't want to go to the trouble to make a crust, so I topped the vegetable/sauce mixture with stuffing mix.  After baking the stuffing made a nice "crust".  I did pre-cook the vegetables until barely tender, they were just perfect when the "pie" came out of the oven.  Like previous reviewers, I added frozen peas.  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

I make this every time I have leftover turkey, and it turns out great!  I usually have enough extra crust to make a small pie, as well.

This recipe was great.  Even the picky ones liked it. The crust was light and flaky and the vegies were just right.  Thanks Wendy for a GREAT recipe.

I used pre-made pie crusts. I haven't cooked from scratch for a long time, but this recipe was easy to follow. It took some prep time, but it was well worth it, it was sooo delicious. I want to make it again. I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces next time.

Writing this for my fellow newish cookers. I've never made any kind of pie or pie crust. This was very very simple with the instructions given. I used butter instead of lard because I didn't know where to get it from and also boiled all vegetables in the filling for about 5 minutes and they were all tender. Added a little garlic and Tony's for my personal taste otherwise did everuthing as written. I made my crusts and cut all vegetables that morning so this only took about 15 minutes to get ready at dinner. Perfect golden crust! My baby and toddler ate it. Will make again!

Tried this recipe for dinner last night! My boyfriend loved it! No more frozen Marie Callender's Chicken Pot Pies for us! After reading a few reviews I threw the bottom crust in the oven while it was preheating then brushed it with egg whites. I left out the celery because I don't care for celery much. I cheated and used a bag of mixed frozen veggies (green peas, carrots, & green beans). I read a few reviews and cubed the chicken and threw it in the chicken broth to cook for 10 min. After that I added the bag of frozen veggies, thinly sliced mushrooms, and potatoes for 5-7 min. Then I followed the recipe for the butter, salt, pepper, onion, and flour. I poured the chicken broth in the butter mixture after and whisked it and then dumped everything in. Poured the filling into the bottom crust and covered it with the top crust and also put egg whites on that. The rest I followed the recipe to cook and let it cool for 10 min. It was awesome! Definitely something to try making when the weather gets colder. I also cheated and used the Pillsbury Pie Crust haha!

I had taken home all the veggie trays leftover from a work luncheon. I hate to see it go to waste so I made chicken pot pie. I've posted the pics from beginning to end. This was very satisfying. I didn't use lard though, instead using coconut butter since it will endure the high heat that lard does. Either one is fine.

I just made this today and had to return to write a review.  This is by far the best I have ever made.  I think the only thing I might do is add a few more tbsp of flour, as I like my filling very thick.  Otherwise it was perfect!!

I made the filling on the stove top and served it with biscuits. Other than that the only changes I made were to use about a third of the butter, chopped up the mushrooms and added garlic, thyme and extra broth to the sauce. There is no way that you need that much butter, it was so good with a reduced amount.

I just made this for supper tonight.  It was delicious.  My first try at chicken pot pie I might add.  I omitted the mushrooms as I did not have any cheated by using  the store bought Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts instead of making my own.  I used a 9-inch pie plate and ended up with enough left over filling for a second pie.  Looks like we will be having it again tomorrow night.  Thanks for sharing this!

For beginners/first time makers like me:  If you have no store-bought chicken broth on hand; since the instructions call for draining off the boiled broth, I just reserved all of that until I saw how much I needed to make the filling thick enough (which would be at least the 1 and 3/4 cup chicken broth called for).  To start, I just covered the chicken completely with water, sprinkled in a couple Tbsp of rotisserie chicken seasoning I had on hand. then reserved that liquid, after boiling.  This may be what the instructions intend in the first place, but since it doesn't say what to do with the broth drained off the chicken, that's what I used.  The only veggies I had were one can each of corn and green beans.  So that they wouldn't be cooked down to mush, I waited to add them in after the chicken got boiled.  Carrots would have given this more color.  You could use a can of Veg-All, which contains a colorful variety, but there's something about it that looks too store-bought to me, even when it tastes fine.  So I try to avoid that.  I used pre-made, refrigerated pie crusts and that worked well.  I probably put more slits in the crust than necessary, but I've seen too many boil out of the crust.  I think this would be nice with some water chestnuts added in, if you don't have celery.  I only had 1/4 c onions; to give it the amt of onion taste intended, I could have added a little onion powder I THINK.  Do pre-bake the bottom crust so that this won't turn out too mushy.  Tasty!

My family raved about this!  I used my own crust recipe but followed everything else and it was the best pot pie ever.  I also made a couple for the freezer -- works great, just have to cook for about 2 hours.

Fantastic recipe! Came out perfect the first time I tried it and my whole family loved it! It has now become our favorite "Chill chaser" recipe to use on those chilly evenings when you just have to have something to warm you up from the inside out :)

I turn to this recipe every time I get that chicken pot pie craving (which happens somewhat frequently). As noted by others, the recipe makes more filling than you can fit in one pie plate. I usually end up making mini pies in muffin cups with the leftovers. Also, the veggies will be crunchy if you don't cook them a bit before putting them in the crust. Other then that, I love the recipe and plan to use it many more times.

I am not a big pot pie fan, but my husband loves it. So, I made it for the family. I used ready made pie crust and did not add mushrooms, but instead added frozen peas and corn. It was a big hit with everyone! Next time I might make myself a veggie one with more veggies like brocoli!

My husband says that this dish deserves a 4 star rating and that's pretty good for him!  Now, I did use a store bought crust...only because I can't make a crust to save my life!  Also, I added mixed veggies and some different spices.  I NEVER cook without garlic.  We love it!  So I added some garlic and parsley.  Along with some onion powder because I happened to be out of onions.  I thought it was great!  I will definitely make this again.  I do think that I will add some soup base to give it more chicken flavor.  I like things that are very flavorful.  I may add some poultry seasoning next time as well.  Overall though...pretty great recipe!  Thanks!

What a GREAT recipe!  Thanks so much!  Since we keep Kosher in the house, I actually changed the recipe a bit to keep it kosher and keep it healthy at the same time.  I used Empire Kosher chicken, kosher chicken consumme, smart balance (parve) butter, and pre-frozen pie crusts made with vegetable oil instead of lard.  As recommended I also cooked the vegetables in the chicken consumme, and it came out perfect.    Thanks again!

Tried the pastry, but wished I'd used my own recipe,instead used tenderflake deep dish frozen crusts, sauteed the mushrooms in garlic butter, simmered chicken breasts in the stock for 10 min and diced potatoes and carrots for 5 min. Sauteed the onion and celery and continued on with this great recipe. Also put the piecrusts in oven while preheating for 5 min, then brushed with egg white; all of this from others great reviews.  I have made many chicken pot pies for my family who loves them and this one got the best praise, thank you swizzlesticks!

This was very delicious!  I took the advice of a few others and boiled the chicken in 1/2 of the stock that it calls for (10minutes) then i added the potatoes & carrots & boiled another 5min.  I made sure they were still firm but not raw.  I prepared everything else the same with the only other exception of the onion, I never keep onion in our house due to the fact that my hubby hates it so i sprinkled in a tiny bit of dried onion and that worked just as well.  I also followed the advise of a review on the egg white wash on the crust...turned out beautifully!  This is another that will be in our meal rotation menu :o)

Since I was short on time, I did not make the pie crust, I used store bought. As per other reviewers, I softened up the carrots and potatoes some so they would not come out too crunchy, and they ended up with just enough tooth to them. I did not have mushrooms, so I added corn to make up for it, and I used red potatoes instead of russets. I also added garlic powder and poultry seasoning, and I really enjoyed the additional flavor it gave! Overall, a good recipe I can use for a base! Very creamy, very hearty, very stick-to-your-ribs!

I didn't read the reviews about cooking the potatoes and veggies before adding to the pie either. A little on the crunchy side. Flavor is great though and I'll make it again--but will probably use peas instead of celery.

I made this for my family the other night and it turned out perfect! I alter a few veggie choices to suit everyone's likes. Other than that I kept the recipe the same. Even though I didn't have time to refrigerate the crust for the time alloted, it still turned out flaky and delicious.

I've made this multiple times since finding this recipe.  My family has loved it every time.  The recipe is great as is, but tonight I added about a teaspoon of Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic and that really enhanced the flavor.  Because this recipe makes a too much filling for a 9" pie pan, I pour it into a greased 9x13 and then roll the entire amount of dough into a rectangle for the top.

So Yummy!  I used a store bought crust that needed to be used up.  I added a lot more onion and more carrots.  I also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Way too much for 1 pie, will make 2 next time.  This recipie is going in my regular rotation.

This was my first homemade pot pie with homemade crust and It was so good! The husband loved it, the kids didnt like it that much (but they dont like anything I swear!). I also precooked the veggies like other reviews and added some extra seasoning like onion powder, garlic, and greek seasoning. I had to bake it for 15 extra mins cause i made 2 batches of crust and made the 1st pie crust a little to thick. But it was sooo good! Way better than store bought and wasnt hard to make at all!

This was excellent! I'm not a pro in the kitchen, so I used Pilsbury refrigerated pie crusts and I used a 12oz bag of mirepoix (2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots - available at Krogers) and only 1 and 1/2 russet potatoes. Made enough filling for two pies definitely!  Followed the modification of boiling the chicken (3 breasts) in chicken broth for 10 minutes, adding the mirepoix and boiled for 5-7 minutes longer, then removing the chicken and straining the broth to get the onions, celery and carrots out.  Additionally, allowed the pie crust the bake as the oven preheated, then brushed on egg whites and no soggy crust.  Definitely a keeper!

So good and easy!  My family loved this recipe.  I did not cook everything and then drain for fear of losing all the flavor, instead I cooked the veggies in the chicken broth and added to the same pot the remainder.

Delicious and easy to make.  We added veggies from the garden and made sure that the carrots and potatoes were soft before adding them in.  We also added seasonings from the garden to spice it up a bit.

I used Pillsbury Pie crusts to save on time. I boiled cubed boneless chicken breasts in 4 cups of chicken broth for 10 minutes. Added cubed potatoes for 5 minutes to parboil. I also added garlic to the onion, butter and flour mixture. Added peas, corn and fresh green beans at the end before baking. Also added 1/2 C. milk, and a few teaspoons of corn starch because I used extra chicken broth.  Also added a little bit of sage, thyme and parsley. I made one big pie. Brushed egg whites on bottom/top crusts to prevent sogging. Then made mini pies with the rest of the filling in muffin tins. Perfect!

My family loves chicken pot pie and I have tried many recipes ... but I have to admit this one comes the closest to perfection for us.  I've made this with different veggies and it's always a treat.

one word...FANTASTIC!  This was exactly the comfort Pot Pie recipe I was looking for.  Thank you sooo much for sharing!  The crust was great!  A dough trick I just learned is to cut the lard and flour together with a wisk.  What a time saver.  Also, work the dough as minimal as possible!  The only change I made to this recipe was...I didn't add potato because I had a turkey dinner the night before and had other left overs to add in.  So instead of potato, I used the corn on the cob kernels and cut up green beans. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly and was not dissapointed.  As per other reviews, this amount can easily be used for two pies...so double up on the dough!!

Made this tonight... this was easy.  made the dough this morning and put in fridge. Used some of the 1/2 C butter to saute celery and onion.  Added remaining butter and melted.  Followed the recipe from there.  Did use broccoli and carrots (did steam before adding to mixture in pie), and leftover corn. Mixed them in.   MISTAKE: added a bit of milk and will not do that next time.   Otherwise, this was very good... family loved it, will make again.  tasted just like our local bakery's frozen pot pie but better because I made it!  Next time I will add some cheddar cheese before putting on the top layer of dough...

I made this last night, but did use premade pie crusts.  It was delicious and my uncle was over for lunch today and said it was awesome!  Thanks for this recipe - it was quite easy to make.  I did use chicken breasts, fresh, cut them up and then added as instructed.  I perhaps used too much chicken broth as I wasn't sure what the consistency should have been so when we cut into it, a lot spilled out, but it was so tasty and good, I am not complaining.  I did however, precook my potatoes and carrots, highly recommend this as even with the precooking, the potatoes were still a bit firm at the end.  No biggie though.  Fantastic recipe - highly recommend!!

This turned out great and got rave reviews from the family. Definitely a keeper. I followed some of your guys' advice and cooked the veggies most of the way through before dumping them in the shells, and also baked the bottom crust a bit first to prevent sogginess later on. Thanks to your suggestions, I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks guys :)

Very good.  I used a premade pie crust.  Make sure veggies are chopped into little pieces so that they can cook thru in the 30 minutes listed in the directions and use egg wash on pie crust for a golden look.

Very good! I used my own pie crust, because I hate to try anything different when It's a no fail for me. No need in fixing anything if it's not broken, right. But I used this recipe as a base, and It was very yummy!

This was soooooo good.  I cooked the potatos and other veggies with the chicken for about 10 minutes to soften them, but other than that, I didn't change much.  Oh and I did it in a 9 x 13 pan since there was so much.

This is so so good.  I make individual pot pies.  I don't use a bottom crust and I use pre-made pie crust on the top, or I make mashed potatoes and use that instead of crust.  I use a large mug to cut the crust to the right size.  This is a favorite of friends and family.

I followed recommendations of reviewer L Sacher.  There was a lot of filling, so I used a Rectangle pyrex deep dish.  I used 2 boxes of Jiffy Crust mix.  I also added a can of Cream of Chicken soup instead of the milk.  It was GREAT!

I really liked this recipe. I especially appreciated cooking the veggies in the sauce beforehand-but fair warning, it makes a lot of sauce. I recommend using a cookie sheet underneath the tin to avoid overflow. The pie was PERFECT for a cold, snowy night.

I usually use frozen mixed veggies and skip the mushrooms and celery.  Comes out perfect every time!  A huge hit with the whole family, and a great use for leftover rotisserie chicken.

Outstanding dish!

Based on other reviews, I...
-- halved the filling
-- nuked the diced raw carrots and potatoes 2 minutes on high before adding to the 'gravy'
-- substituted English peas for mushrooms
-- brushed the raw bottom crust with egg white to ward off that soggy feeling

I also made the crust with Crisco instead of lard; but both crust and the pie worked very well together.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!

I put this in a deep square cassarole dish and it turned out awesome. I actually did the crust myself following the recipe - used Butter-flavor Crisco. Ended up using a lot more water though 8 instead of 6 tbsp to make it come together. I thought I measured well, but perhaps I had more flour, not sure. I put the water from parboiling the potatoes/carrots in the chicken pot and came up with 4 plus cups of broth and used most of it. The consistency was still really great. Also threw in a handful of frozen peas and corn at the end before baking. The hubby worships me now. :) Thanks.

Excellent.  The whole family loved it.  Cooked the veggies before putting them in the pie.  Used a frozen pie crust.  Fast and easy and  delicious.

Loved this as did my whole family.  I used the Pillsbury pie crust and did bake bottom shell for 5 min. prior to adding filling as suggested by others and came out perfect.  Will definitely make again and again.

Wow. Perfect recipe, incredibly good. Rave reviews! I used butter instead of lard for crust, was SO delicious. I added a little corn, omitted the mushrooms (they had gone bad in the fridge). I wish there was a higher rating...

We have made this pie twice and both times it was a hit. We didn't change a thing except add the spices that other reviewers have suggested.

I made more like a vol au vent than a pot pie because I pre-made individual tart shells (from a pie crust recipe), and then filled them with this cream sauce. I have to say this sauce is fabulous. I used homemade stock and once it thickened up, it was so flavorful and full-bodied; it was amazingly delicious. I didn't add vegetables because of the dish I was serving - just scented with rosemary and added cooked shredded chicken and spooned the filling in to the tart shells.

I loved this recipe.  I changed quite a bit.  I didn't have time to make a crust so instead I placed the filling in a 9x9 baker and put corn mix over top.  I also din't have mushrooms so I just added extra carrots and cellery.

ALTHOUGH IT WAS SOME WHAT DRY, THE FAM LOVED IT! EXCEPT THE CHICKEN BROTH, WHICH I ALSO MADE FROM SCRATCH, WAS ADDED TO TOO MUCH FLOUR! THE MIXTURE WAS TOO THICK AND LOST SOME OF IT'S TASTE TO THE FLOUR. BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS GOOD.

This was so yummy.  I have never made a crust before and it turned out so good.  I did add some garlic and fresh rosemary to the butter when it was cooking.  I ommited the mushrooms and added peas.  You can really add what veggies you like. For a quick dinner I am going to make the filling and serve it over biscuits.   This was just a good, basic home style meal.

This a big hit every time I make it.  My family requests it for dinner when they come.  Make sure you precook all of the ingredients before putting them into the crust.  I also cheat and use frozen or refrigerated dough.  I add dill to the sauce.  Comes out great.

I've never made a pot pie before and this turned out perfect! I converted the recipe to 12 servings. Mostly because I live in Africa and don't have a pie plate, but the extra helpings went fast! I used a pan close to a 9x13 (cake pan) and it worked great! I parboiled the carrots and potatoes before adding them to the mixture and I used half lard and half butter for the crust. I was going to brush the crust with egg whites, but was lazy. The crust was a little soggy on the bottom, but still wonderful. I used carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, and peas. It was fantastic and it'll be a regular meal for us. Thanks Wendy for the post!

Made this tonight and the Husband LOVED IT!  I took the advise of others and steamed the carrots and potatoes before adding to the meat mixture, I also used half crisco half butter in the crust.  This is now going to be a regular at our house.

This was really delicious.  The only changes I made was substituting peas for celery and cooking the carrots and potatoes before adding them to the sauce.  The crust was perfect and the filling was great also.  The perfect chicken pot pie.   This one is a keeper.   Thanks so much for the recipe!

Mmmmm... perfection! I used butter, instead of lard when making the crust. I omitted celery, since we don't care for it too much, and added a small pkg. of frozen peas to the filling; otherwise I followed the rest of this recipe exactly like it is. It came out perfect, perfect, PERFECT!

Wonderful comfort food!  I parboiled the potatos and carrots, and added 1/2 cup frozen peas.  I used my standard pie crust recipe since I didn't have lard in the house.  The pie came out very runny, but no one seemed to care, it was that good.  Next time I'll try a higher temperature, my oven may be on the cool side.

This was the best pot pie I've ever had.  My family ate every last bite!  So delish and pretty easy to make, even the crust!  Although I had to leave my dough out for about 20-30 minutes for it to get soft enough for me to roll out.  That's the only snag I hit.  This recipe is definitely going into my rotation.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was delicious! I did precook the veggies some before combining, as another suggested. I also chopped them pretty fine, which also helped. This is worth the effort !

I used frozen peas and carrots and leftover rotissary chicken.  I uped the crust by half (3 cups flour) I didnt measure the carrots and peas.  I found individual pot pie tins and it made 5 full pot pies.  They turned out perfect after 35 min of cooking!

Delicious comfort food.  Sauteed the mushrooms, celery, diced potatoes and onions.  Added these and a small package of mixed frozen veg to the chicken gravy.  Only change I made was to add poultry seasoning, and sage to the filling and rosemary to the pastry.  Will definitely make this again.  Lots of filling for two 9 inch pies.  Just double the pie crust recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was delicious!  I did cheat and bought a crust, but followed the rest of the recipe.  IMPORTANT:  COOK THE POTATOES FIRST!  Maybe boil them for a while.  I didn't...since the recipe didn't specify, I thought that maybe they would just cook up while baking.  They didn't...they were raw, and we had to pick them out.  We also used frozen carrots/peas/corn for the veggies...and they came out just fine.  The gravy was soooo simple to make, and was so delicious!  I will definitely make this again...and I will cook the poataoes first when I do!

In almost 45 years of cooking I don't think I have ever made a pot pie. Awesome recipe! Perfect sauce. I cheated and used premade crust but this deserves homemade next time. I also steamed the potatoes and other vegies ahead of time so I could use bigger chunks. This will be added to the rotation. I made extra filling so I used a 9 x 13 dish.

This is amazing and really quite easy.  I use a 9x9 square glass baking dish and everything fits perfectly.  I used one chicken bouillon cube in 3c of water, brought that to a boil and then added my diced veggies and cooked them for 7 min as others suggested.  I also used non-hydrogenated shortening instead of lard and the crust came out just fine.  With regard to thickening the sauce, melt the butter until it's bubbling and then stir in the flour mixture.  It'll thicken up FAST.  Stir in the broth somewhat gradually and then remove from heat when it's as thick as you like.  This is really a treat.  Hubby loved it too.  I will definitely be making it often and will likely experiment with doubling it and trying a 9x13...  Thank you for the recipe!

AMAZING!  I used refer pie crusts, but otherwise, I  followed the recipe for the filling/sauce.  I also used a bag of frozen veggies to cut time.  My picky girls cleaned their bowls, veggies and all!

I did not follow this recipe to a T, with the veggies. Instead I added peas, carrots, and green beans. I did however, make the crust as stated in the recipe, it was perfect. But, I felt that it did need more seasoning.

This recipe is easily changed!  I used Pillsbury roll out crusts instead of making my own.  I added peas instead of mushrooms and used canned potatoes and chicken since I was in a rush.  It does make too much for one pie filling.  I am going to use less broth next time.

I had to give the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because of the changes I made. I used refrigerated pie crust instead of scratch & it worked great. I used frozen veggie mix along with frozen O'Brien potatoes & it was so easy this way. I pre-cooked several chicken breasts & cut up in chunks to add to the other ingredients. Everybody loved this recipe & said it was much, much better than the frozen things you get in the store. I will definitely be making this again!

I had the best idea ever when I was making this, I switched out the potatoes for a little homemade gnocchi, it was fantastic, a new texture and a chance to introduce some more spices and flavors, it was awesome.

My daughter and I made this last night.Pressure cooked the chicken with some boullion cubes  and used pearl onions instead of mushrooms.  Also used ready made pie crust (just didn't have time to make the crust in the recipe)  It was wonderful and got rave reviews from all who ate it.

I made this last week and it was great. I did use a ready made pie crust but the filling was delicious. I am making the filling tonight and serving it over rice. I am sure it will just as big a hit as the pot pie was

This recipe was a really good starting point.  The pastry came out delicious, very flaky and was a great compliment to the filling.  I used a milk wash on the top to make it a golden colour.  I made a few changes, I wanted a creamier sauce so I added some half and half in place of some of the chicken broth.  I also added some different spices...dried dill weed, cajun seasoning, and lots of garlic powder.  I also added mushrooms to the pie, pan fried first so  my sauce didn't get soupy once the pie was cooked.  Lots of fresh ground pepper too!  Will definately make again with leftover chicken or turkey, this was worth the LOT of time it took to make.  I knew it would take lots of time, so I doubled the recipe and made 2, one to freeze and re-heat later on when I don't have time to cook.

If I could give this more than five stars I would.  It was exceptional. I will never buy a frozen chicken pot pie again. Thanks so much for sharing!

The inside was great but we did not like the crust at all.  I will use my normal recipe for the crust and use this inside recipe.  Thanks!!

Good recipe to cook ahead and freeze.  I used Pepperidge Farms pastry crust instead of making my own.  Also, substituted vegetables with what I had available, including some corn.

Well, I'm not sure where to begin?  The flavor for this pie was great except there was too much, to use a pie pan.  I used a round cake pan, since it was a little deeper, but it still turned out a bit dry and I didn't even use 3 cups of chicken, I used about 2???  I wish I would have read reviews B4 I made it, so I would have cooked the vegies a bit 1st B4 mixing them in with the sauce, since they were a bit undercooked (even though I ended up cooking this an extra 15 min's. I definently will try this again, except I will use some tips from other reviewers.  Regardless, thank you :)

This is Excellent. If you are craving Chicken Pot Pie, this is it. I have made it about 4 times already and will make it again. I cooked the potatoes and carrots first, otherwise they come out way undercooked. I substituted peas for mushrooms (and left out that portion of butter to cook the mushrooms.)  I do suggest scaling back a bit on the veggies and gravy unless you are making a large pot pie. Thank you for the recipe.

If you cut back on the potatoes, this is a perfect pot pie recipe. I also added a bit of broccoli. Loved it!

This was really great.  The crust was easy to make (I used butter) and the flavors were perfect.  Next time I will steam or saute the carrots, celery and potatoes before I put them in the pie as they were a bit underdone.

This was fantastic!  I read some reviews and took the advice to cook the potatoes in the broth beforehand.  The potatoes were completely cooked after baking.  And since I was using a frozen pie crust I made drop biscuits and just dolloped that on top for a crust.  This recipe made two 9" pies!

I can't believe it.  I made a delicious crust!!  And didn't have to hurt anyone!  What a deal.  I already had my own pot pie recipe for which I'd been using refrigerated pie crusts.  This was so easy and so good, I doubt I'll ever buy those again (unless I'm pressed for time).  For anyone who struggles to move a rolled out crust to the pie plate, use my mom's old trick....carefully lift from the counter with a spatula and fold in half as you go...keep lifting, fold in half again (don't press down!).  Now you have an easily manageable crust to move and unfold in the pie plate.

Great recipe.  I used a ready made pie crust and cut everything in half. After adding the chicken broth to the saucepan I added 1 thinly sliced potatoe and let simmer for about 8 minutes. I then added 1/2 bag frozen veggies and the chicken.  Turned out wonderful.

Great basic recipe. I change it up a little. First I season my chicken with basil, paprika, salt, and pepper before I cook it. Also I cook my potatoes, carrots, and celery for a few minutes to soften before baking. When cooking the mushrooms I add in some chopped onion as well. Lastly I add frozen peas. I make this often and we LOVE it. Great comfort meal!!

I made this tonight for my family and everyone LOVED it!  The only thing I changed was that I substituted peas for the mushrooms and I partially cooked the veggies before I put them in the gravy mixture.  I will definitely make this again!

I added garlic powder to the dough, but followed the recipe all the way with exception of that I didn't have 4 hours (much less overnight) for my dough, I put it in the freezer for an hour. Talk about sticky but it was my own darned fault (I didn't read the recipe all the way when I chose it) I also used 1 cup of butter instead of lard. SO, I had to form the dough to my pie pan and rolled the top part out between saran wrap, it worked for the most part. I had a little bit of filling left over but it helped ease my hubby's hunger till the pie was done. He LOVED it. I baked the pie for 30 minutes at 350 then another 30 minutes at 400. The bottom came out VERY nice!!! It was well done, not burnt nor undercooked. The top had a beautiful browness to it. I will be doing this recipe again but with enough time to let the dough sit in fridge for the right amount of time. I will also add garlic and thyme to the mixture for a little added flavor. I think that I will also make individual pies instead of one big one, too.

This pot pie was really good! I only gave it a 4 because I made some changes. I read the reviews and saw that it made too much filling so I halved the filling. I melted 1/2 cup butter, added flour, cooked a minute, added grated onion, salt and pepper, gradually added in 1 1/2 cups chicken stock cook and stirred until thickened...then I added a spoonful of sour cream, 10 oz semi thawed frozen mixed vegetables (if buy the box make sure you let them sit out so you can stir them in the mixture), shredded chicken, half cooked potatoes and I used biscuit topping, 2 cups bisquick, 1 cup milk and 2 eggs but it was really too much topping so will half that next time too. I will definitely make this again.

It tasted good, but the potatoes and carrots were still really hard. They should be pre-cooked. Also, there was enough filling for 2 pies.

This is perfect for winter days.  I used store bought pie crusts, and left out the mushrooms but added some frozen peas. Hubby even loved it, and he does not usually like chicken pot pie.

The best recipe I have found, and I have tried many.  For an option, I used only 2 3/4 cups broth with 1/4 cup cooking sherry.  This made for a very rich tasting sauce.  We like alot of sauce, so I left the potatoes out.

I love chicken pot pies and this one is yummy. I made a few changes for health or convenience sake and it worked beautifully. I used frozen pie crusts, reduced the butter in the sauce mixture by a few tablespoons and instead of cooking the mushrooms in yet more butter, I cooked them in some chicken stock. I advise you to pre-cook the potatoes (I did it with the chicken) and cut the carrots into small pieces or they won't soften up in 30 minutes. Add some more of your favorite veggies and enjoy!

i made the dough the day before and refrigerated it. i also chopped all my veggies the day before. i used beef instead of chix so i also used beef broth in place of the chix broth. i doubled the crust recipe to try my hand at a fruit pie before the holidays. i used an egg wash in the inner crust and baked for a couple minutes then i only used 2 c (instead of 3 c)of beef broth for the gravy. i sauteed all of my veggies w/ the raw beef in olive oil until beef was browned and veggies were crisp tender. i combined the 2 mixtures and filled my crust w/ it. i only had a little left over, not enough to make another pie. then i did a lattice top pie crust and finished that off w/ some more egg wash. i will make this again but i think i will just use my crrockpot to make beef stew and freeze leftovers to fill the crust w/ for next time to make an even easier make ahead and throw together meal. this was my first time making pie crust. thank you for the recipe.

The filling in this pie is absolutely perfect and delicious. We're not mushroom people, so I subbed some other vegetables. Do yourself a favor, though, and use a different pie crust recipe! This particular crust is super finicky and falls apart at nothing. I followed the crust recipe to a T and after I rolled the crust out, it would not come up in one piece. I ended up pressing it in pieces into the bottom of the pan. To get the top crust on, I rolled the dough out on a piece of floured wax paper, covered it with seran wrap, put it back in the fridge until I needed it, then flipped it on top. It still broke apart a little, but at least it was easier to repair.

This was wonderful. My 13 year old helped me and the crust was so flaky. It was easy. I even tried chunks of steak instead of chicken and beef broth instead of chicken broth and it turned out amazing as well. I always make two and freeze one to cook later. mmmm mmmmm a new staple in my house

This was excellent.  It truly deserves all five stars.  I took the advise of doubling the crust and making two pies.  There was plenty filling for each pie.  Just to make sure there was enough filling, I did add a can of peas (drained).  It was delicious.  This was the perfect way to sneak veggies into my kids dinner.  They had no idea they were eating mushrooms!  I will definately make this again and again.  The pie was filling enough by itself but I served with homemade dinner rolls and a green salad.

Great recipe that everyone loved. I doubled the crust and used a 9 x 13 dish.  Read the reviews and cooked the veggies first.  Since my kids don't care for mushrooms, I left them out.  But I would love to make one with mushrooms and one without next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

yummy!!!  we used peas instead of mushrooms, and it was fantastic!  i would have to say that the filling was about two times too much, but i just froze the remainder for later use!  this is a great, hearty dish!  perfect pot pie!  i did add a little more seasoning than just salt and pepper.  put in garlic powder, celery salt, and some dried parsley!

Absolutely fantastic!  We followed the recommendation of some reviewers and pre-cooked the potatoes.  We chopped up a clove of garlic and cooked it with the potatoes to give them that little extra zing! We omitted the mushrooms due to preference, and baked it into 12 mini-pies in a muffin tin; they turned out great!  We did have a bit of extra filling, but it's so delicious it could easily be a stand-alone stew (I bet it would be tasty with dumplings).

I used leftover baked chicken, carrots and potatoes, store-bought pie crust and it came out wonderful!  Family loved it!  Great way to use up leftovers.  You could also substitute beef and beef broth I would imagine.

This recipe is wonderful.  I substituted butter for lard in the crust, and then didn't put in celery (instead sauteed about 1/2 c. of onion in the butter) and then as I had no potatoes I used chopped up zucchini and squash.  A definite keeper :)

Very Good! Only change I made was to add some fresh thyme, peas and poultry seasoning. I baked it in a 9x13 Pyrex and topped it with pie crust. Delicious,easy, quick and simple. Will make again!

Great recipe with a few changes. I used the Crisco's pie shell recipe which always turns out. I par boiled the carrots and potatoes for eight minutes and added the onion and celery for another three minutes.  I added 1/4tsp of thyme and poultry seasoning with the salt which I halved (1/2 tsp) and pepper.  At the end I addded 1cup of frozen peas. There is enough filling to make two pies so I freeze half for another time. I cooked the bottom pie shell for five minutes at the required temperature before filling it. Thanks to all those suggestions it turned out great!

The perfect pot pie recipe! I used half whole wheat flour and half white for the crust and parboiled the potatoes.

Very tasty!  Because of time constraints, I used Marie Callender's frozen pie crust for the bottom crust.  I made the dough recipe from this one, but cut the ingredients in half.  Used Crisco instead of lard and put the dough in the freezer for about 2 hours.  I did get extra filling and just froze that for the next pie.

This was quite good. My daughter said it was better than the frozen ones that are avaliable. I wanted to use up some leftovers so I used turkey and turkey broth in this recipe. Instead of the mushrooms, carrots and potatoes I used 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables. I didn't pre-cook them but did add them to the warm sauce, they were just right after baking. I also added some poultry seasoning and sauted the onions and celery before adding them. I made this in individual pans (4.25") and it filled nine pans. I put several in the freezer and will see how they taste after being frozen.

A great pot pie!...I cheated and used a store bought crust.  I reduced the broth by about half a cup and cooked the veggies in the broth for about ten minutes.  I left out the celery and used frozen peas instead.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Very Good! I cheated and used pre-made pie crust due to my own time constraints, but it still turned out great. I used a deep dish pie plate and piled on the entire batch of filling, so the pie was heaping. I've always wanted to try making chicken pot pie and this is a really good and easy recipe. Thanks!!

Oh.. this is SO good!!! I really wanted a made-from-scratch chicken pie (although I admit I cheated with store-bought pie crust that come in a roll). The only thing I did different was added about a cup of frozen peas. This was down home delicious!

This was good with a few modifications. I cooked all veggies before putting them in the pie...it seemed to me that the cooking time wouldn't have been long enough to make them squishy enough (squishy-ness is a prerequisite for veggies in my house). I also added more onion, garlic and peas for flavor. All in all, this is an excellent fall supper. Will make again.

Seriously the best Chicken Pot Pie that I have ever tasted (My husband agreed). We omitted the mushrooms, but other than that followed the recipe. I will probably cook the potatoes for a little bit before I put them in next time, they were just a little on the firm side.

My husband normally turns his nose up to cassorole dishes but this one was a hit.  I did as others suggested and used only one potato.  Also used baby carrots (as that was all I had on hand).  Didn't have time to make the crust so I used one box of the jiffy cornbread  mix. Otherwise made as the recipe suggested. Very Yummy!  Will make over and over again.  Thanks for sharing.

Boiling the veggies beforehand is a must, but other than that this recipe is so yummy.  It does make too much filling, but that's what other pie crusts are for!  ;)

This recipe was great, just like it said, good old fashion pot pie.  I think the amount of ingredients would make a 10 inch pie, I had some left over.  The crust was delicious and very easy to make.  This will be my family regular.  Thanks Wendy!!!!!!!

Delicious!  Used mushrooms, onions, and potatoes and fried them up with the butter with lid on as someone else suggested.  I also only used 2 c. broth and then added 1/2 t. savory.  I put it in a 9x9 pan and then topped with a pastry crust (milk, homemade biscuit mix, and butter) on top.  YUMMY!

I tried this recipe with the store bought pie crusts. I cooked it in the oven for an additional 25 minutes on 325 to make sure all the veggies were cooked through. I was nervous when I finally took it out of the oven, but it was excellent. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This the best Pot Pie recipe I have ever found, and it will become a regular in my house! I added a chicken bullion cube to get more chicken flavor to the sauce, and you can use nearly any vegetable. Very versatile and yummy!

I am not a big pot pie fan but this was pretty good.  I omitted the mushrooms and celery and added peas and it still turned out good. I didnt read the recipe before hand and i didnt refrigerate the dough and it still tured out good.  My husband and children loved it but suggested adding a bit more spices for flavoring.  But otherwise its a keeper!

This is the first time I have made a chicken pot pie from scratch.  This recipe was quite successful.  The filling was moist and the chicken was tender(boiled it in chicken stock first).  I would definitely make this recipe again. Thanks.

this recipe is absolutely perfect! i had pre boiled the vegetables, so they came out not too crunchy yet there was still this bite when you bite into the pie. And i also marinated the chicken in some dried thyme, rosemary and mixed spice, it add that extra kick to the pie whick made my family love it! my mother even requested for extra helpings! but my pie base was a tad soggy so i would suggest you pre bake the base first. But despite that this is still loved by my family as its the first time i had got great reviews from my whole family for a dish!

I unfortunately did not read the reviews before I made this.  If I had, I definitely would have cooked the carrots, celery and potatoes before putting them in the pie because they were very crunchy.  I substituted Morton's nature's seasoning instead of salt and I added some thyme and peas.  We loved it even with the crunchiness.  I will make it again but like I said, cook the fresh veggies first!

This recipe was very tasty.  The only thing I didn't like was that is wasn't exactly easy to make (I'm still new to the whole cooking scene).  I will attempt it again, however I'll cut the ingredients for the filling in half and substitute peas for the celery.

The flavor and portion sizes were great!  My only suggestion would be to definitely cook the veggies first.  I tried cooking them a little as others had suggested, and they still came out crunchy.  Next time I'll try cooking all the veggies in chicken broth and then thickening everything with the flour and butter.  I used my Pampered Chef deep dish pie pan, and it was just right. The crust was excellent, and it wasn't any trouble to make--it's definitely worth it to make it by hand!  Great recipe overall.  Just needs some work with the directions--thanks for sharing!!

This was excellent! My first attempt at a pot pie and it was fine.

Maybe a deep dish pan would have been better though - it was *full*, so I wasn't able to put in any frozen peas but will next time.

The pastry turned out really well which was my biggest fear as I am  with pastry! But it came together fine and rolled out well and browned nicely without a wash.

I did parboil the veggies because I wanted creamy comfort food without any crunch.

I'm already wondering when I can have this again!

Comfort food!  Take the extra time to make the crust because it makes that much of a difference.

Followed others suggestions and made a modification of my own.  To get more protein in the recipe, I used bone broth and added chicken base soup starter (per directions for broth).  Everyone loved it and I got the protein I need!  Win win!

Tonight I made this with my grand kids. The girls  are 6 and 8. They enjoyed cutting the mushrooms and stirring the roux . And it was fun to see their amazement when the roux made the gravy. They both agreed that I could leave out the onions through. Great recipe! Family favorite!

The Chicken Pot Pie was really delicious.  After reading the reviews and seeing that the filling made a lot I made mine in a shallow casserole dish as opposed to a pie pan and it worked out perfectly.  Would definitely make again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I did take the advice of another cook and pre-baked the crust while the oven was heating and also brushed the crusts with beaten egg whites. Made the crust flaky and beautiful. I added more veggies too: in addition to carrot and celery, I added leeks, mushrooms, peas, corn, green beans, red potatoes and sweet potato. Made enough for 2 pot pies. Beautiful comfort food even for company!

I liked it. The dough is nice. the challenge is getting the right mix of spices for both the broth and the filling. I think that for the recipe to be full stars they should include an estimated amount of spices for flavor.

Pretty good! I pre-cooked the vegetables, as suggested. I managed to fit all of the filling in my deep dish pie plate, but some of the filling leaked out onto the bottom of my oven. :'( I'll be making it again, but with a cookie sheet underneath!

Made it to freeze and it set well. I used 2 prepared Marie Callander pie crusts for the bottom and made fresh crusts for on top of the pies.   Followed the advice of a previous reviewer and painted  egg white on bottom and top crusts. Added in sliced precooked baby potatoes and frozen peas with the other veggies, and made more “gravy” to fill both pies.

This was great!  Definitely making again.  I made a few changes.  I used a butter pastry crust and made it in a 9 inch square pan.  I used a free range, air chilled chicken rubbed with thyme, oregano, salt and pepper, pressure cooked (25 minutes/natural pressure release) on a stand over onion, garlic, carrots, celery,  and 3 cups of water.  This made a wonderful stock and tender flavorful chicken for this recipe.  I cooked the chicken the day before and refrigerated it overnight before I cut it up and cubed it.  This also let me easily remove the fat from the strained and chilled stock.  I boiled the potatoes (1/2 inch cube), celery and carrots in the stock for seven minutes and let that stand for about five to ten minutes while I made the butter, onion and flour roux.  Amounts of some of the ingredients: 4 cups of 3/4  inch cubed chicken, 3 cups of potato, 1 cup of carrot, 1 cup of celery and 1/2 cup of onion.  I may try 375 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes next time to let the flavors blend a little more.  Also I may try a corn starch slurry instead of the flour roux to thicken the sauce.  The lighter flavor/texture would probably go better with the pastry crust.
 One caution - I used a 2 inch deep pan and it was barely deep enough.  The top crust sat above the pan and the sauce came close to bubbling over.

I've made this many times and we love it on a cold snowy night.  Comfort food at it's best!  I usually omit the mushrooms and add peas before baking.  I sauté the onion/shallot in the butter, briefly, before adding the flour add stirring well for a minute or two to create a nice roux.. Next-chicken stock and other fresh veggies, cooking just until a low simmer.  Once I pour that into the pie crust, I add the precooked chicken (rotisserie chicken from Costco works great!) and the peas.  I then place the top crust and off to the oven it goes.

I made a bit of a bigger batch of meat  than originally called for, needless to say I didn’t have enough gravy for my comfort so I tried to fake that (eh) and I had to use a deep dish pan. Wonderful flavor and it would have been perfect had I taken the time to perfect the second batch of gravy. I know where I messed up so the next time will perfect !

So I absolutely love this recipe. The second time I made it, I used sweet potato and added sweet peas,(because come on, it is a pot pie). I also substituted whole wheat flour and it came out just as flaky and buttery!

Awesome. I only made enough dough for the bottom to cut down on carbs and used home made chicken stock. I also sauteed the veggies. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a great recipe!  I especially liked the thick gravy for the filling.  I did use premade Trader Joe's crusts, and substituted mixed vegetables for the mushrooms, potatoes, and carrots.  This is my new recipe for one of our favorite comfort foods.

I followed the directions to a "T".   I should have read the reviews prior to cooking this dish as the carrots, celery and potatoes were al dente.   Note to self:  cook your vegetables prior to mixing with gravy.    I used the leftovers from a whole chicken, unseasoned,  so we can taste the flavorful authentic  chicken instead.  The  gravy was easy breezy to make however I was a tad bit concerned using an entire stick of butter.   It's a comfort dish for sure!    This homemade dish is wonderful and I will make it again in the future.  Go ahead, give it a try!  You won't be disappointed.

The pie crust turned out and tastes just like I expected and reminded me of good quality frozen pies. Thumbs up. Can't go wrong.

Awesome!! I changed a few things after reading the reviews. I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth and I added one pack of chicken sazon to the chicken thighs when cooking them. I also used store bought pie crust. The filling was a bit runny so I will add another half cup of flour when sautéing everything. However the next day, the filling wasn't runny at all (even after it was heated). The pot pie tasted great the night I made it and the next day as leftovers. I was asked to make it again the following week. This time I am doubling the ingredients so that I can freeze half of it for a future dinner. This was awesome. Thanks.

I loved this recipe. Best chicken pot pie ever. I selected this recipe because all of the reviews were really good. It turned out perfectly. Everything went really well. I used pillsbury pie crust instead of making it myself. The crust turned out great. I would suggest using this crust.

The only 2 things I did differently was I had Pillsbury pie crusts in the freezer that I wanted to use up so I used that and I didn't have any mushrooms.  Other than that I followed it exactly using our leftover rotisserie chicken and loved it.  Probably the best I have made.  Next time I make it I will use the crust on the recipe.   It has a lot of butter in this recipe but I think that is what makes it so good...I noticed how people were cooking the potatoes first...I cut them into very small chunks and just mixed them up with the celery and carrots like the recipe said to and they cooked up fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I finely shredded the potato after reading reviews on cooking and it worked out pretty well, texture wise...  
Way, way, way too much filling.   It overflowed in my deep dish and I still scaled back my ingredients based on other reviews.   
Will make again, because I'm stubborned and want to get it right haha

I cooked the potatoes and veggies in the broth as someone else recommended. I also omitted the chicken since I didn't want to get any out of the freezer. My picky eaters loved it! My daughter (literally) sang its praises through the meal.

Oh my! An awesome dish. I fast-tracked the pastry dough by putting it in the freezer for 30 minutes or so and let it sit in the refer for an hour while I prepared the filling. It still turned out flaky and firm when baked and the bottom crust wasn't soggy.  I used my garden veggies including fingerling potatoes, young carrots, and shelled peas. I did boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes prior to adding it as suggested by many reviewers.

Wonderful as written, but have made it without mushrooms and with boughten crust and still rocks!  My son-in-law does not like chicken pot pie but loves this recipe!  Freezes well, with or without crust.  Often just use a top crust.  Still delicious.

I had been craving pot pie for ages and this was great. I followed others' recommendations and made two pies, and I had enough filling and dough left (after trimming the two 9 inch pies) to make four little cupcake pan pies. I didn't put potatoes in and just added a little more carrot and celery. If I had to make it again I would double the salt and pepper and maybe bake it a little longer since the veggies (despite being finely diced) were still rather crisp.

Super easy and fast especially if you use canned veggies which I did for the diced potatoes and carrots. I did sautée fresh mushrooms and onion though and threw in some frozen peas just to use them up. I fully cheated and also used a frozen ready made pie crust because I was in a hurry. Turned out great although I'll spice it up more next time and maybe add some herbs. The boys, who are all about simple food, loved it as is but for me it was a little too simple flavor wise. ??

My husband loves this recipe.  I do use a deep dish pie pan.  I sauté the onions, carrots and celery.  Makes them much more tasty.  Microwave the cut potatoes a few minutes.   You can add a little of your left over veggies, corn, peas, geese beans but about half a cup is enough.  Enjoy!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I didn't have fresh carrots so, I used the carrots from a bag of Stir Fry  veggies, also added the broccoli from the bag. I used a can of mushroom pieces, I had on hand. The potatoes I used were 4  small New Potatoes that I par boiled to make it easier to peel.  Once all the veggies were chopped, I added them to the sautéed Onions and flour and let them cook until tender. I didn't add any salt because I used chicken broth I had made before, from my freezer.  Instead of a pie pan, I decided to use individual aluminum 2 cup size "baked bean" pans. This recipe filled four.  The pie crust was the best I have ever made.

This was delicious!  I haven't eaten pot pies since I was a kid (shy away from high calories).  However, my husband raved about this recipe and it reminded me of my youth.  I did add more flour to thicken up the "gravy", but I had no problem filling a deep 9" pie.  I also added extra onion and some garlic salt while sautéing the veggies first.  I agree that the veggies needed to be cooked before assembling the pie.

This is pretty much the way I make my chicken pot pie too..just one short cut for working or busy mioms..use the meat from a rotissarie chicken dark & white and its REALLY GOOD AND FAST!  Using a roux is ALWAYS BETTER THEN A CAN OF SOUP AND IT DOES NOT TAKE LONG!  Great recipe thank u for sharing it!

This pie requires a deep dish pie plate to accommodate all the filling.
You will have extra filling if you use a regular one.

I really wish I had read the reviews. Yep, the potatoes were not done. But my kids did not complain. Next time,I will parboil the potatoes. If I make it again.

This is absolutely delicious!!  And easy to boot!  I did make a few changes to the recipe - replaced the mushrooms and celery for peas and carrots which I cooked slightly before adding.  I also par-boiled the potatos in the chicken broth as mentioned in previous reviews.  I also cooked the bottom crust for about 3; then after cooling for a few topped it with an egg white wash to keep it from getting soggy.  The results were amazing!!  This is definitely a keeper!!

My review is only for the filling- I lack the "knack" for a decent home made crust, so I use the roll out premade kind! This is the BEST filling I've found! Like others have said, precook your potatoes!  I made this again tonight, but didn't have celery or carrots.  6 oz frozen mixed veggies worked GREAT! Love this!  Thank you for posting!

So tasty but the potatoes didn't cook.  Must boil first.  I used shredded carrots so didn't need to boil them first.

Followed the recipe - used premade pie crust. Usually just throw in whatever veggies I have on hand. I microwave the potatoes first and then cut them to put in (just to save a pan). I make it with leftover chicken so I can skip that cooking step too. I add everything to the gravy and pour it in together. It is a lot of filling but fine for my deep dish pie pan. Everyone in my family loves it which is a tall order!

I liked this recipe.  I wondered if I got my sauce thick enough but I did find I had more filling than could fit in my pan.  I think it would be fun to get small dishes for individual pies.  A little more work but preferable to having the pie run out.  I used butter in my crust since I did not have lard on hand and it worked it out just fine, should have pre baked the crust and did the egg wash thing.  Omitted the mushrooms since they are not my favorite but it was a good recipe.

The Very Best Ever. I also used the Buttermilk pie crust recipe and the crust is to die for. I wouldnt change a thing about this recipe.

I gave it 4 only because I had trouble getting my kids to like it. My husband and I greatly enjoyed it though... I had to make some changes based on our dietary needs, so I used a gluten free crust, and corn starch to thicken instead of flour. But it worked pretty well, and cnverted to a gluten free recipe without too much trouble.

Well if it were me I'd give it 5 stars.  I quite enjoyed this dish.  My extremely picky husband did not even though he likes all the flavours in the dish separately.  My daughter wouldn't even look at it. BTW, I cooked it like a giant stew.  I just sort of dumped everything into one pot and cooked it up.  I allowed the potatoes to cook that way and it worked for the most part.  Saves a pot too!  Good recipe unfortunately I won't be able to make it again because the crew is too picky.  :(

Great recipe - the whole family loved it!!! It does make a lot of filling but I used a deep pie dish so was able to use it all at once, you could definitely make 2 smaller pies with it. I added some extra spices when cooking the chicken, added frozen peas and used my own pie crust recipe only because I had some frozen. I just unthawed before cooking. Will definitely make again

This one is very good.  It lends itself to 'tweeking' for individual preferences.  I liked the fact it didn't use a lot of heavy cream.  It helped to know that the veggies needed to be pre-cooked for a little bit of time before assembling.  Will make again and again.

Love this recipe - my hubby's favorite.  Does make a ton of filling but that makes a great stew the next day, (found the filling was even better as stew the day after!).  Great recipe all around.  Thanks for sharing.

Very Good! Used some leftover roasted chicken. I halved the recipe and it almost overflowed one pie crust (although I did added probably a full 1 1/2 cups of mushrooms and 2 tbsp of onion). Also, I used store-bought crust as I was short on time. Still came out amazing.

I make this when i have left over chicken from sunday dinner. i make the broth with whats left of a whole chicken (cheaper and tastier then bought broth). i make extra broth so i can make gravy to go on at the table if desired. Roasted potatos and carrots are good for extra flavor aswell. plus any extra frozen vegetables in freezer. i think next time nstead for cuttin dough recipe in two balls i will just use a bigger dish an omit the bottom crust.over all it was a great recipe.

This was one of the better pot pie recipes I have used. Everything came out great and I followed it to a T. The only exception was boiling the potatoes first, which I always do.

I gave this four stars because I ammended the recipe to some degree ( in that I sauteed the onions along with garlic and added some white wine and leftover cream to the sauce) but the four stars are mainly a result of the proportion error- this makes two pies worth of filling. Be sure to have two sets of crust handy should you keep the quantities listed. It should be said tho, it is a great meal!

Yummy!  A big hit with my husband and easy to make.  I did cheat this time and use a premade pie crust, due to lack of time, but next time I'll do homemade.  As others suggested, I halved the filling recipe, pre-cooked the potatoes in the broth, and brushed my bottom crust with egg to keep it from getting soggy.  I also sustituted frozen mixed veggies for the fresh carrots.  It turned out great!  I did have to cook it for 40 min. instead of 30, but that could just be my oven.

Delicious pot pie. I have not had the time/energy to make a crust with this, but I'm sure that makes it even better. I have baked this with refrigerated biscuits on top to save time and it came out very good. The last time I made the filling I doubled it and froze half of it.

As written, this recipe is a pretty bland.  I added a couple teaspoons each of rosemary, sage, and thyme.  I also added fresh, minced garlic.  I should have cooked the veggies and gravy on the stove for a little while before putting it in the oven.  The carrots and potatoes were still hard when the pot pie came out of the oven.  Also, it occurred to me as I was serving the pot pie that it would have been better to make individual pot pies, rather than one large one.  As soon as I took out the first slice, the filling oozed out of the remaining slices and filled the cavity.

Amazing!  This is a great recipe, the sauce in the pie turned out perfect!  I did use 2 cups of chicken broth rather than 3 and I think next time I will probably use maybe 1 and a 1/2 cups. For the potatos, just make sure you cube them up real small and it should cook through.  I cut all the veggies before I started making the filling, and after I added the broth to the butter/flour mixture I added all the veggies to help them cook through a little longer. I also baked the pie for about 40 minutes instead of 30.  All in all I would definetly recommend to anyone!

Very good! I used a premade pie crust that came in a two pack - I took the  2nd frozen crust out of the tin and let it thaw, once it was defrosted it made a perfect cover for my pot pie.

My family loved this !!!  I made a few changes. I used pre-made crust, omitted the mushrooms, celery & added 2 tblsp of chicken bouillon, a small bag of frozen mixed vegis(fresh is best, but frozen will do in a pinch) & used fresh oregano(fresh really makes a difference). This recipe is a keeper!!

I made this for dinner this evening and was very pleased!  I made individual pot pies since my son hates veggies...my daughter hates carrots and I my husband ....the more potatoes the better!  I made the crust earlier in the day so that it could chill.. I used a texas  muffin tin and tailored the filling to each person.....this was a delicious change of pace!  Not only is it my first crust, but my first pot pie from scratch!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!  we loved it!

Like some others, I modified the vegetables somewhat.  Omitting the celery and mushrooms, and substituting with tradtional peas and carrots made this a huge hit with my family.

Great! I, too, cooked the veggies until not quite tender in the chicken broth, then scooped the veggies out before adding the flour mixture. I made two pies, one with the handmade pie crust and one with a store bought pie crust. I couldn't taste that the handmade one was better, but then I'm not a very good pie crust maker! Also, i added peas. I, too, found there was too much of the filling. next time I will keep the amount of gravy mixture the same, but cut down on the veggies/chicken by about a quarter.

Excellent recipe!  I never make crusts, so I was afraid to try it, but it turned out great!  I took the suggestions of others and doubled the crust to have two pies. I froze the second pie and when we ate that one, it tasted just as good as the first night. I didn't measure, but I did add extra veggies as well as peas.  I also boiled the potatoes for a bit before adding and they turned out lovely. My hubby also loved.  It got his rarely given "It's a winner!" review!  Now, if we could only make a crust without lard, we would eat this every day!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, except I left out the mushrooms and used a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust instead of making my own.   The recipe lacked flavor and was very soupy.   I won't be making it again.

This is really delicious!  The filling is full of flavor and the crust is nice and flaky.  However, you MUST partially cook the vegetables before assembling the pie, and it's a good idea to cut the pieces small.  My pie baked for 40 minutes, I'd pre-cooked the vegetables, and there was still a bit of crunch to them.  Since some reviewers mentioned there's a lot of filling, I used a deep dish pie plate.  It was something of a struggle to get the dough to fit it but I managed.  I still had extra filling left.  Be prepared to spend a LOT of time making this, with chopping the vegetables, preparing the chicken and making and rolling the pie crust.  Therefore it's not something I would make regularly, but only when I had plenty of time to do it.  I didn't use mushrooms and used peas instead.  Really good cold weather dish--try it!

I used "Crust for veggie pot pie" off of this site instead of this crust" This was a great recipe with a few tweaks. 1) thoroughly! cook the carrots potatoes and celeryting in filling mixture. I place in microeave for 5 minutes and they were still really crunchy and that really ruined my pie but the flavor saved it so I ate it anyhow.  did not have chicken broth or bouillin so I used one packet of chicken flavoring from a packet of Ramen noodles. I also added some frozen peas and only used 1 potato. Next time I will add mor chicken and some milk to the gravy mixture it came out to thick which made it almost seem dry with the crust. But the flavor was great.

This recipie was really good, but I couldnt give it 5 stars because I adjusted a lot and went with a lot of the previous viewers suggestions.  Firstly, I didnt add all of the broth, but instead substituted 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and a cup of cream.  Also, like other suggested I boiled the potatoes first and and steamed the vegggies.  After everything was combined, I also stirred in a cup of chedder cheese.  Delicious!

Also excellent for ruffed grouse!  A 10x10 baking dish worked well and held all the ingredients perfectly.  After reading some reviews, I cooked the veggies in broth before adding to the baking dish.  Will definitely make this one again.

I made this last night for friends and it was incredible. I doubled the recipe and ended up with enough for 3-4 pies.  I did change a few things. I used ready-made crusts which saved me a lot of time in the end. I sauteed the mushrooms with a bag of frozen vegetables. I didn't use potatoes in the recipe either and I actually liked it better. The only recommendation I have is to not use the 2 teaspoons of salt.  It was a bit too much but it didn't ruin the flavor thankfully. This was so easy to make...it will be a staple in my house too!

yum. 
I enjoyed cooking this and eating both!
Soup was definitely thick enough.

Instead of just adding chicken, potato, carrot, celery, I cook them half-way and add to soup mixing. 
Also added sweetpeas ! 
CRUST was perfect everytime i cook.

Although, the soup wasn't as creamy as i would like to be.

This chicken pot pie, is the best I have ever had! My husband and kids all think its ahit. The crust is perfect. I added a bag of sweet corn, and it seems to give a completed taste for us, since I don't like celery or mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!

Great base recipe.  Needs a bit of seasoning.  I added about 1/2tsp of onion and garlic powders.  A dash of oregano and some more S&P.  I also added a splash of 2% milk to thin it a bit.

1/2 the recipe was just enough to make a full 9" pie.

I used Martha Stewart's pastry recipe for the crust....which is buttery and delicious.

I made the full recipe for the crust.  

I cut the recipie in half based on reports that there would be enough veggies etc for two pies.  Half of the recipe was more than enough.  I boiled the potatoes for 5 min before putting them with other ingredients.

I left out the mushrooms and onions.  I substituted peas.

It was delicious.  The reason I gave it three stars was because I changed some ingredients.  If I change the recipe,then I do not give the recipe 4 or 5 stars.

First, the crust is phenomenal.  I had to add season the filling considerably from what the recipe calls for though.  I added all the good stuff - parsley, garlic powder, more salt.  I prefer a pot pie with more big chunks of veggies, but this one has a nice, thick consistency & when modified, flavor.

This turned out really well! I didn't have time to make the crusts, so I used frozen. And I only had one, so instead I thinly sliced potatos and put those on top of the pie. It turned out really well. I added celery seed and dried thyme to the filling which gave it a little more flavor. I also didn't  use mushrooms, and used peas instead just by adding them to the filling. Next time I will cook the celery and carrot with the onion in the butter for a few minutes - my carrots were not all the way soft. Thank you for the recipe! delish!

YUM! This is a really good recipe for chicken pot pie. I used pre-made crusts and the filling was too much for one crust, so I had to make 2 individual pot pies. Which was okay with my husband. I also omitted the mushrooms and used peas instead. Everything else I followed exactly. Very good and Im sure I will be making this a lot, when it starts getting cold!

My husband said, "Add this to the yummy recipe list, I want to have this again!" and my 1 year old said, "Mmmmmmm!" :)  Very good, very easy to follow, I used 2 cans of Veg-All to make the veggie part a little quicker.  Not exactly home-made but still very delicious!  Even better as leftovers!

this is the very best chicken pot pie I have ever had. I made this the other day and my family flipped over. My son who hates everything had two servings.  The crust is light and flaky and the chicken was so tender.  It was wonderful!! The only extra ingredient that my family requested next time is PEAS!!! It was great!!

I took every ones ideas I used a premade pie crust and cooked the potatoes in the stock, I also sauteed the celery in a little butter. This turned out so good even my picky husband loved it and said to save the recipe.

Super-delicious!  I made the following modifiations & it turned out just right: Used frozen crusts, and made a deep dish pie.
Used the meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken. Omitted mushrooms and celery (for a fussy in-law).
Added a big handful of frozen peas. Cooked veggies first (except for the peas). Used Imagine Organic Free Range Chicken Broth, which always makes recipes taste way better than caned broth. This broth comes in a carton and can be found in the Wild Harvest/Whole Foods-type section of the supermarket.  Costs a bit more, but is well worth it. I can't wait to make this again in a couple of weeks!!!

Wooo Hooo!  The best Chicken pot pie ever and I am a chicken pot pie fanatic. I used the Pillsbury ready made pie crust in the red box. Wonderful and saves a whole bunch of time even though I am sure the home made crust would have been heaven.

This is very good, but it does make more than one pie so I just added extra vegetables and put some filling in the freezer for another meal.  I added some peas and zucchini and my family loved it!

Love this recipe! But I did make a few changes. I sauted the veggies with the cubed cooked chicken before adding to butter/flour mixture. I also did not use mushrooms or potaoes, but zuccini instead. And I only used 2 1/2 cups broth. The mixture was so yummy! I also used Pilsbury pie crusts. My husband loves chicken pot pie and he loved this! I will be making it again, beacause I found it went rather quickly! Thanks!

YUM! I used all organic ingredients (minus mushrooms). I roasted my chicken in my crockpot with lots of herbs, onions & celery the night before. The chicken was super tender. I took the advice of saute'ing my veggies prior. Makes lots of filling, but I made extra dough and put everything in a 13x9 baker. Thank you!

I modified it pretty heavily, but the rue used for the sauce was great!  Only used 1/4 cup of butter for it though.

This was the best pot pie that I'd ever had!  I didn't have any mushrooms but had some fresh frozen corn from our garden, so I tried that (and it was great).  My husband went for seconds and told me it's a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW! This is the best chicken pot pie recipe I have ever tried! I left out the mushrooms and added peas to it, and it was  still amazing. Everyone who has tried it either wants a copy of the recipe, or wants to know my secret!

the crust is the best part, and it's very easy to make.  i omitted the mushrooms and celery since i didn't have any on hand, and it was still very delicious.

It was OK.  I personally would eat it again but none of my family (wife or 2 kids) liked it very much. Not enough to request it again anyway. I can't say for sure why my 11 and 14 year old didn't like it. They wouldnt come out and say???  I just know they didnt care for it. It was a bit bland but that is easily remedied. But 3 against me. Sorry.

Delicious!  I used pre made crust, still turned out excellent.  I took others suggestions and steamed the veggies first, and added peas.  Excellent!!!

It was good. I like a little milk in the broth and poutlry seasoning.  I just used the filling part of the recipe not the crust.  I think next time I will add more flour so it is a little thicker.

This was my first try at making pot pie and I thought this was an excellent dish.  I highly recommend it.  I used fat free and sodium reduced chicken broth when I made it.
