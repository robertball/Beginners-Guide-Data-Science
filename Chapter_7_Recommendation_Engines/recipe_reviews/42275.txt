This was kind of a disaster. I was really tired and didn't really pay attention to the amount of liquid called for in the recipe. It really wasn't enough. I'll try this again with a half cup more or so of water, then re-review. I'm sure it's just a typo.

This is awesome! I don't know why it hasn't been rated yet, but I thought the combination of juicy raisins, sweet bananas and apple with the oatmeal was really yummy! And most importantly, my 3 yr old (fussy) daughter loved it too and gulped it down. I made some changes, only out of necessity - I used wheat germ instead of oat bran, I eliminated the OJ b/c I wanted to use milk for extra calcium, used gala apples, and a ripe banana. The banana was nice b/c it ended up mashed which gave the oatmeal a pudding-like consistancy, which was nice. I topped the oatmeal with chopped pecans and more milk - so delicious! And the banana I used was so sweet that I didn't even need to add any sugar. Thanks for this recipe!!

A good place to start if you want to get away from instant oatmeals and into a DIY no-sugar added oatmeal. It's a little tart for my taste. I would like to try this again with more cinnamon and walnuts.

i made this for my non-fussy 26 year old brother this morning and he looved it. i made it as it's written except for using wheat bran instead of oat bran. i added a bit of brown sugar at the end. he gobbled it up; i can only assume it was good!
