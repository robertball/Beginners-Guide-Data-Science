The caramel bottom was so hard you couldn't slice the pie. And the chocolate was way to rich. Everyone disliked this pie. Very disappointing.

I couldn't find Vanilla Cool whip so I used regular and it was fine. This pie was a huge hit. Very rich and delicious!

I wish I could send a picture, but it didn't last long enough!

This was absolutely fantastic, though I wasn't paying attention and didn't get vanilla flavored whipped topping, just used whipping cream instead I think it cut down on the sweetness so it was nice. Also couldn't find any caramels so used toffee syrup it was yummyummyummy so good that when the kids were sleeping my boyfriend and I ate the rest! Naughty!

We are having guests over for tea next week and will be serving this for dessert, thank you vry much for this recipe love it! Already have it memorized.

Whoa... very sweet.  If I make this again, I will cut back on the chocolate or add more cool whip to cut the sweetness.  Other than being to sweet, the caramel layer was very good.

This was ok, nothing spectacular. I used heavy cream in place of cool whip. The caramel and pecan mixture was good, but the chocolate mixture was just bland. I'm not a big fan of semi-sweet chocolate, so that could be influencing my review. My husband also thought it was just ok. Probably won't make again.

This pie was really good. Very rich though as other reviews stated. Simple enough to make. I let it sit over night... and I think this is definitely a pie to make the day of, chill, then serve... as it was very difficult to cut even with sitting out for a half hour. I added a hint of vanilla extract as I had regular cool whip. Will make this again!

WOW!!! You've got to try this.  It's like a fudge pie.  The flavors are incredible.  I used regular coolwhip and it was great.

This is too easy to be as good as it is!  I *thought* I had messed the whole thing up by accedently grabbing the regular Cool Whip instead of the French Vanilla when i made it. The pie turned out Very Rich, but not an over powering sweetness.  I would like to say that i shared it with other people but the pie was just too good to share with anyone but the hubby and he loved it too. A small servign with coffee or a hot Chocolate is heavenly!
