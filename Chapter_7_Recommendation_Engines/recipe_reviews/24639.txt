I must have done something wrong...we just didn't like this.  I did everything exactly as the recipe called for.  I might try again to see if it was my mistake or not.  Thanks anyway for the post.

This is a really great treat for parties or a snack for the football game.  Tastes great when made with fresh vidalia onions.

My whole family loved this recipe! I also took it to a swim club picnic and got two requests for the recipe.

These are excellent! I used a thicker style crust. They turned out rather like cheesy bread, but with sweet onions and swiss the flavor is out of this world! I used olive oil rather than butter, and couldn't help but add some garlic while softening the onion mixture. Excellent and simple finger food, thanks for the great recipe!

If you're looking for foccacia, this isn't it!  But it's quite yummy, and with the sweet onions, surprisingly mild.  My onion-hater went back for more!

What a simple recipe!  My family was cringing when I started cutting up two giant onions, but they only complained when it was gone!

I thought this was a really good appetizer.  I used chicken bouillon because I just prefer it to beef.  I didn't want to make a pizza crust so I used crescent dough for a crust and added some mozzarella also.  Thanks Angela!
