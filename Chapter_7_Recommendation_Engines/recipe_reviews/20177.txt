These really are great, tender pancakes. I have made them several times and I feel it is necessary to mention that fresh blueberries are best, and that there is no need to wait the hour until making them! I have found that sprinkling the berries on the pancake after it is on the griddle works best and avoids smashing them. You can also use vegetable oil instead of the melted butter; it makes no difference, especially if you butter them afterwards anyway!

Can you say "YUM"?  This is a top of the line blueberry pancake recipe.  It always comes out perfect--fluffy, yet not cake-like. It's very moist with the blueberries; not a dry pancake at all.  I even made it without the blueberries one time because we ran out, and it was delicious, too.  But the blueberries put it in first gear!  I've made it about a dozen times so far.  Yes, the other reviews are correct in that you don't have to wait an hour to cook it--you don't even have to wait at all. They taste the same either way.

This recipe is amazing.  I have made it several times for several people and
they all agree it is GREAT!  It is very easy to make and the brown sugar & butter 
topping is yummy.  All ages like it.  Only draw back is you have to remember to
start to make about an hour before you want to make them.  I left them one time 
for just fifteen minutes and they were still fine.

The pancakes didn't have much flavor. I definitely needed syrup to be able to eat them. I liked the texture of it though. Very easy to make, indeed. You must drain blueberries. Mine looked totally green pancakes.

terrific pancakes, well worth the hour wait.  I liked them with the butter and brown sugar.  My husband preferred syrup.  Also I used fresh blueberries.  Frozen is fine in the winter and if it colors the batter, so what.  It doesn't affect the taste.

My batch of pancakes turned out fabulous.  They were fluffy and had a good consistency.

I loved the recipe, but I added more sugar (about 2 tablespoons more) -- So I couldn't give it a complete 5.

These pancakes are very good. I used 1 pint of fresh blueberries, sprinkling some into the batter. I had 1 cup of buttermilk so I used that up and 1/2 T of butter for the griddle. The batter has a nice consistency, more on the thicker side. I left it to sit for a few minutes. While they were on the griddle I added a few more blueberries. The pancakes puffed up nice and light. When they were done I had about 6 medium size pancakes (I was making for two people). To finish off my pancakes, I spread on a little more butter, topped it off with the remainder of blueberries, and drizzled a little maple syrup over. Mmmm...these were awesome good. Fluffy and thick, moist, and delicous! (I think it helped using the buttermilk). Using fresh, not frozen, blueberries really took these pancakes over the top. You will notice a huge difference in freshness, taste, and quality. The blueberries were bursting with flavor, oozing with its' sweet purple juices when cutting into the pancakes with a fork. The pancake texture was just right. Other fresh fruit would substitute just as well such as bananas, peaches, apples, mixed berrie, etc. I don't think it's necessary to wait an hour before making the pancakes-they came out just fine. The only reason I can think the recipe calls for you to wait 1 hour is to allow the baking powder to activate in the batter-making a more thick, fluffy pancake. (you will see little bubbles perk up in the batter). I served these pancakes with maple flavored bacon.

I thought that this recipe was great!  You do have to plan ahead for the hour wait, but the fluffy raised texture of the pancakes is worth it. My 4-year old loved them plain eaten out-of-hand like a cookie.

Some reviews suggest that there is no need to wait an hour as stated in the recipe. I disagree -- I think the wait time is essential to making these pancakes just right.  If the wait time is a problem, mix up the batter the night before. It works great!! Just take it out of the frig in the morning, heat up your griddle and you are ready to go. This makes a thick pancake, but with exactly the right texture -- hearty and satisfying, but not heavy. I'm not a big pancake eater, but these are really terrific. I have substituted half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour, and it turned out fine. Today I also stirred in a couple of tablespoons of flax meal, to try to make it healthier. Delish! These pancakes are not very sweet on their own. You'll get the sweetness from your syrup. Add more sugar if you want sweet cakes. Do give these a try, especially if you want a quick hot breakfast that you can mix up the night before and cook quickly in the AM.

Wonderful blueberry flavor!  My only negative comment is that although they were still very light they did turn out a bit thick. I'll use a little more liquid next time...and there will definitely be a next time!

My fianc√© told me I shouldn't bother writing a review about these pancakes, as it already had over 500 near-perfect ratings. But I gotta give credit where credit is due! These pancakes were so ridiculously awesome that the two of us had to restrain ourselves from eating the whole batch. He usually hates pancakes, always complaining about how spongy and monotonous they are in restaurants. These pancakes had such a wonderful texture and bite to them, and it's a miracle how we were able to save four of 'em to freeze for an emergency breakfast in the future. Initially I wanted to wring his neck for choosing a recipe that required an hour's wait -- for pancakes?! -- but by the time I cleaned the kitchen, fried up a batch of applewood smoked bacon, and uncorked a bottle of bubbly to make mimosas, the wait was over! Rockin' pancakes, thanks Alison and Todd, wherever you are! :)

I was on Easter break and thought since I had the time I would make my 1 yr old a real pancake (instead of the frozen ones I stick in the microwave).  Absolutely delicious.  I will definately make these again...only complaint is the hour wait time...but worth it.  Thanks for the post.

I didn't wait an hour, but my pancakes still came out great! I followed the advice of sprinkling the blueberries after pouring the batter on the griddle, so my blueberries weren't smashed. These pancakes were so good that they didn't need any topping/syrup at all! (the people who added more sugar and toppings need to get their taste buds checked before they get diabetes.)

I decided to make this recipe last night, let the batter sit in the fridge overnight,
and cook them this morning.  My husband and I both agreed that these are
about the best pancakes we've ever eaten!  I think they'd even be great without
the blueberries--very light and fluffy!  I'd eaten half a large pancake before I
realized I'd forgotten to put any syrup on them!

Very good! I substituted bread flour for all-purpose, soymilk for milk, and fresh blueberries for frozen. I also omitted the butter and studded the pancakes with blueberries rather than folding them into the mixture. It was very thick, closer to sticky dough than batter, but they came out great! I would definitely make these again.

These pancakes were only okay. They were lacking flavor. Next time, I'm adding more salt and sugar, which should fix that problem.

This is an excellent recipe for blueberry pancakes!  I didn't sift (simply because I forgot) and used fresh blueberries. I agree with others that it would be easier to just drop them in on each pancake when it's in the pan. I also didn't let the batter sit for the hour, but maybe 20 mins. Light and fluffy, yum!  Thanks Alison for the submission!

Delish! My 4 year old helped. Very fast and easy recipe. Everybody loved them. They were fluffy and light. I followed one reviewer's advice and added the blueberries on the griddle. My son had fun with this part. I'll probably also add the blueberries to the batter next time. Also added a pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla extract. We topped it off with some sliced bananas and homemade applesauce along with the syrup. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Todd!

These were just ok. Maybe it was just me, but the batter was strange. The pancakes came out a little chewy, they didn't brown very well and they were too salty. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and I'm glad I did because I think they otherwise would have come out bland. They aren't the worst pancakes, but they aren't the best either.

These were off the charts!  I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen and used oil instead of butter.  I also did not let them sit an hour.  They were perfect.  My husband who doesn't ever eat any sweets for breakfast ate two!  I ended up having to make a second batch after the first was gobbled up with none left for me.

These came out great!  I was truly impressed that there was no uncooked dough around the blueberries, as I often have problems with that in my own recipes.  I let the batter sit only for 1/2 hour, but they were still wonderful.  When I have time, I will let it sit for an hour to see if there is a difference.

YUM! We used fresh blueberries and they were just as tasty.  I think you could substitute any mix (bananas, chocolate chips, etc) into this recipe and it would be delicious.

Fabulous pancakes!  I've used this recipe before, but got it out this morning for Father's Day brunch. So tender and fluffy!  We had fresh picked blueberries and blueberry syrup, and this was a huge hit.  I did double the sugar because the fresh berries were a little tart.  Thanks Todd, these were wonderful!

Delicious pancakes.  Mine turned out somewhere between a crepe and a pancake which is excellent because they are very moist.  I hate dry pancakes.  I found the recipe to also be very forgiving if you tend to burn stuff (Me? Never!).  Even after having them on a hot griddle until they were a dark golden brown they were still very moist.  Not sure why I always get a slight metallic aftertaste with my pancakes.  I think maybe I should use less baking powder?  My girlfriend suggested letting it sit longer.  Admittedly I was hungry and didn't wait the full hour.  Either way I know that's probably something I'm doing wrong and not the recipe.  I can't wait to make them for my girlfriend!  Thanks for sharing.

Good pancakes. Made as written, let sit for an hour. I used the butter & brown sugar topping suggested by others, which was very good. I still dipped each bit in real maple syrup though. I do like sweet pancakes, so   next time I'll add a bit more sugar to the batter. Great texture, cooked up very nicely.

These pancakes were great, even though I only let the batter sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes. I even made a blog post about them.

Being a busy morning, I didn't have time to let them sit for an hour before cooking them.  Guess what!?! They turned out GREAT anyway!  Will definitely be making these again!

We listened to some Bobby"Blue"Bland live in 2005 when we cooked up these pancakes that flapped our flapjacks!! Our customizations: We used whole wheat flour. We made a blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry compote and drained it before adding it to the batter. These flapjacks really rise up and fly! We guessed it was the baking powder. We added a few drops of vanilla extract to the batter. We poured what was left of the compote over the pancakes and then spooned some light whipped cream on top. These flapjacks put IHOP and Bob Evans to shame! Thank you for this great recipe!! Yeaaaah!!

Very good basic recipe!  I used fresh blueberries, but noted that a few more blueberries would have improved the recipe. I am not sure what waiting 1 hour does to the taste...any ideas?  Also, the recipe as written serves just 2 (abt 3-4 pancakes each) so for a family be sure to double the recipe.

This is a great recipe for blueberry pancakes. They come out moist from all the blueberries but still fluffy. I do agree with other reviewers that fresh blueberries would make for a much prettier pancake; I used frozen and while the pancakes were very tasty they were green.  I didn't have the time to wait for an hour but I waited 30 minutes and thought they came out perfectly fine; next time I'll be sure to plan ahead and see if it makes a difference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Yummy, fluffy, and easy to make! I am not a big blueberry pancake fan but using fresh is a must for that burst of sweetness. I agree with another reviewer that they are slightly bland without syrup but who eats pancakes without syrup, haha

Great recipe.  Easy, tasty, and I agree with the recipe poster:  Best with butter and brown sugar as opposed to maple syrup.  Will definitely be a summertime staple.  I made with fresh blueberries.

I have made these as stated with the blueberries and they were awesome. My kids just inhaled them. I am currently making them without the blueberries but with mashed banana and cinnamon. Yummy! These are fluffy pancakes that remind me of the ones you get at the pancake houses. My kids love them and so do I....So good

I even made the dry mix up ahead of time to take up with us camping

My husband LOVED these! I made his without the blueberries.  I have tried some other pancake recipes on this site, but he swears these are the best.  I mixed it up the night before and made them first thing in the morning. Saved a lot of time.

These pancakes did not have a lot of flavor.  If you really want to make good blueberry pancakes, I would stick with one of the recipes for buttermilk pancakes and drop in the blueberries while the pancakes are on the griddle.

I was looking forward to trying out a new pancake recipe, esp. with the good reviews, but unfortunately this one didn't work for me. When it was time to cook them, the batter was so thick that I couldn't spread it (so I ended up adding about 1/2 C of extra milk.) The texture was thick but dense (not fluffy) and had a very bland taste despite the blueberries. I also tasted the baking powder, which wasn't too pleasant. Even dousing them in maple syrup didn't help much. I'll stick to the other recipe I've been using, but I'm glad that other people enjoyed it, and thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I did a breakfast for dinner a few evenings ago and made a half recipe. This turned out 3 nice and fluffy pancakes. Along with a couple of fried eggs and sausage patties, these pancakes made me a happy man. This morning I whipped out some more batter (a half recipe) and turned it into a great Belgian waffle. To let the baking powder do it's job, I did let the batter sit for at least an hour both times. I like sweet so I also used a teaspoon of sugar for the pancakes and 2 teaspoons of sugar for the waffles.

Wow, these are good!  I made them as written expecting to not let it sit for an hour, but it ended up doing so anyway just because I was getting other things ready.  I used fresh blueberries and tried the butter and brown sugar topping.  Really liked that!  We tried syrup too, but that was a little too sweet for my taste.

Very good recipe!  I've never made blueberry pancakes from scratch and this was a good way to start.  I used fresh blueberries, probably a little more than 8 oz but my family is a blueberry-loving clan.  They were very good and fluffy, but something was missing.  I think next time I may add a touch of vanilla or cinnamon and see what I come up with.  But I will make them again!

These were not as great as I expected. (Of course this is only my opinion however I usually have great luck with all the 5 star recipes I try on this site) They were rather bland and too fluffy for my taste. I've been looking for a pancake recipe that is similar to the ones at a local cafe. They are more of a heavy, bread like consistency and porous so the syrup seeps through. Anyhow, my biggest complaint is that the pancakes turned out green. I later found out that to avoid this you need to coat the blueberries with flour especially if you are not using fresh. (Although I did) Hope this helps someone.

Delicious! Best pancakes I've had in awhile. I did make a couple changes; I used fresh blueberries, I upped the sugar by 2 additional tablespoons as recommended by another reviewer. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of white vinegar. Let the batter sit for 30 minutes. Both my husband and my toddler son loved them. Will definitely make again, maybe with different berries to mix things up.

Everyone loved these.  I mixed up the batter, showered, dressed and came back 30 minutes later.  I could see bubbles so the baking powder was doing its thing and I went ahead and cooked them.  They puffed up nicely so I'm not sure the batter needs a whole hour to rest.

The pancakes worked out well, the texture was good, the recipe was easy, they cooked well...But all in all, they were missing a little something.

These were delicious and will be a weekend staple in our home. The only problem I had was that my thawed frozen blueberries ended up turning my batter a strong violet color so my pancakes looked like something out of a cartoon, but were certainly interesting to look at.

Excellent!  I made these so much that I bought a big bucket of blueberries from Costco and made a bunch to freeze.  I like them better fresh though.  I personally like more berry taste, so I add 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  I also like adding in 1/2 tsp vanilla.  You could probably substitute other types of berries and it would be just as good!

I used fresh blueberries in this recipe and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  This is not an overly sweet pancake, but I still enjoyed it.  It made 10 pancakes using a 1/4 cup measure.

Good! This made excellent, super thick, fluffy pancakes. I doubled up on the recipe. One batch doesn't make much, because after it sits, the batter is very thick. I will make them again, but I will add a bit more sugar and maybe sub the milk for buttermilk - just because I'd love a bit more taste. But texture-wise, these are awesome! Thank you very much. :)

Good pancakes.  They are very light and fluffy.  I used spelt flour flour and fresh blueberries.  I also used vegetable oil and added a dose of vanilla.  The family enjoyed them very much.  I served with a homemade blueberry syrup, and a double recipe disappeared before the day was over.

We have these almost every sunday, they are fluffy and moist.   I did make a few changes. I added one cup of fresh blueberries, and half a mashed banana (into the milk egg mixture). I don't wait the hour,  cooked them all on a griddle set to 350-375.  Makes about 12-14 smaller pancakes

I was very excited to make this recipe based on the great reviews it has gotten.... but I was soooo disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and they were so bad that we had to put syrup on them to eat them (we rarely put syrup on pancakes or waffles in our house).  There was a strong metalic taste, probably from all the baking soda. After a couple of pancakes smothered with syrup, we decided to toss the rest and start over.  It was a great waste of my time this morning.

Excellent recipe! Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup low fat buttermilk, added 1 tsp. vanilla and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I didn't wait an hour either and I think these are the best pancakes we've ever had! Deee-licious! We gobbled them. They were very light, fluffy and just the right sweetness. Thanks Todd!

These pancakes were fantastic!  My kids are requesting them every couple of days!  The recipe worked well as is (except I halved the baking powder as some other people suggested), but I've made it several times since and have tried a few new things, including substituting oil for the butter, adding about 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, using 1/2 whole wheat flour, and pouring them right away instead of waiting an hour.  They are great every time--doesn't matter what changes I make.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm sorry to say but these were the most awful pancakes I've ever eaten.  They were rubbery and horribly disgusting.  I couldn't even finish the ones on my plate.  The only good thing about these were the tangy fresh blueberries I used.  I followed the advice of others and cut the baking powder in half while doubling the sugar.  And I also let the mixture sit, as the instructions said.  Still, no luck.  Don't waste your time on these.  Make the buttermilk pancakes on the site (even if you don't have buttermilk, you can still use regular milk and a squeeze of lemon juice as a substitute) and add blueberries.  It will be way better.

The only reason i tried this recipe was because i was out of Aunt Jemaima mix, these pancakes were indeed panCAKES, they looked like something you find on an episode of "The Flinstones" or "The Munsters" way way to thick, try adding water to get thinner pancakes, I eyeballed the batter before i cooked it and did not let it sit (hence even bigger panCAKES)u might want to cut down on he baking soda and add more sugar as other reviews have already stated

The texture and consistency of these pancakes were perfect.  The first time I made them, I missread the recipe.  We ate less than 1/2 the batch between 3 of us. Since then it's come out perfect.  I like to add a dash of cinnamon and teaspoon of vanilla to it. Because this is a relatively thick pancake, when you use berries make sure they are not just thawed, but at room temperature or they might leave the middle doughy.

Tried this recipe this morning...my family loved it!  I used buttermilk instead of milk, and added a whole cup of blueberries.  Served with butter and maple syrup--the real stuff, of course!
I sifted my dry ingredients together last night, and put my blueberries in a covered dish to thaw overnight in the fridge.  I let the batter rest long enough to make coffee, set the table, etc.  
Quick and Easy!!

Excellent pankcakes!  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla for flavor.  I don't how they came up with the servings though.  If this is the primary breakfast food you are serving, it will only feed about three people.  It will make around 10 small pancakes.

These blueberry pancakes were very tasty!  My husband isn't fond of blueberry pancakes, so I made half of the mixture with blueberries and the other half without.  We were both happy with the outcome!  I used fresh blueberries and I didn't wait an hour.  I doubled the recipe and we had plenty of leftovers, they are very dense and filling!  Thanks Alison for sharing!

We all enjoyed these pancakes and liked that I could work them into my Weight Watchers program--1/6 of a recipe is 3 points, so per/pancake depends on how big you make them. You can have a nice breakfast or light supper and not count too many points. We had them with lean ham.

These blueberry pancakes were light and delicious.  My daughter doesn't like blueberries so I took out some of the batter before I added the blueberries.  This is a keeper.

The pancakes were WAY too fluffy, and consequently, were doughy in the middle. The only thing I changed was reducing the baking powder to 1/2 Tbs.

I thought these were excellent. I used fresh blueberries and just poked them into the batter after pouring onto griddle. Next time I will be more careful to turn down the griddle after the first batch as the outsides were well done before the inside. I will also double the recipe as the batch is rather small. Thanks for the recipe Todd!

Delicious!  Made this for me and teenage son and we both enjoyed it very much!  I used blueberries that I had frozen a few weeks ago, no "problems" with the batter turning color.  I let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes while I cooked bacon and made coffee, etc.  The batter is thick so the pancakes are quite fluffy!  Very tasty indeed and will be making this one often!

We love it! Our new go to pancake recipe. We've only made them plain, without blueberries. They rise nice and fluffy. The only thing I've done differently is I added 1 Tbl of Butter instead of the 1/2 Tbl called for.

I was so disappointed by this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly then let the batter sit for one hour. The batter was so thick I could barely drop it into the skillet - I added about 1/4 cup of milk to thin out the rest, but it was still very thick and doughy. The outsides burned by the time the middle stopped being runny. Also, there was only enough batter to make about six pancakes, using 1/4 cup per pancake as the recipe notes, and those six I made were bland-tasting and dense. I don't understand why this recipe is so highly rated, but PLEASE find another recipe.

These were so good! I took the advice of others and used fresh blueberries, YUM! I did not wait the full hour, only about half and hour and they turned out so fluffy. Very easy to make. I can't wait to try these with other fresh fruit. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have no idea why people are saying this is a good recipe, unless I did something wrong, which wouldn't make sense. The pancakes were bitter, needed 10000 times more sugar, and just tasted like baking powder if you didn't have a bite with blueberry. Even drenching them in corn syrup didn't help. I realize this is one bad review out of loads of good ones, but I encourage you to find another recipe.

Truthfully, many recipes I try on this site can disapoint. This one is an absolute winner.  Did the dry ingredients the night before in a big bowl and had my grandson overnight who had begged for pancakes.  Added the milk, egg, butter and FRESH blueberries in the a.m. and it came together in a flash. I did let it proof for an hour.  The batter is thick, so I put three at a time on my stovetop grill and spread the batter out a little.  Kept the ones that were done in a low oven, heated the maple syrup and had fresh butter out to smear.  Honestly, these were simply wonderful and I will make them again and again.

Loved them. You don't have to wait an hour for the batter to sit, just make the batter and then warm up your griddle. This will only take half as long.

Very good pancakes, but were too thick and doughey. They were yummy, but you also do not need to set aside for an hour. They were good and I will make them, again, but I will add more milk to make them thinner.

Really great recipe! As other reviewers have said, you don't really need to let them sit for an hour in order for them to taste good. I left them sitting for about 5 minutes and they were delicious! I also added an extra teaspoon of sugar. So good!

Delicious and easy. Never going to buy pancake mix again. I used frozen blueberries because I had no fresh and it was still good. Also, I've made it and let it sit and also made it with no time to let it sit, and there seemed to be no difference either way. They came out great both times. I've also made then with whole wheat flour and they were good.

Excellent recipe.  Almost need to double it but is quite filling.  The pancakes are substantial and thick without being heavy.  I did change a few things:  I used 1 1/2 tsp brown sugar instead of white and 1 tbsp of butter (instead of 1/2).  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  My family gobbled these up!  Will definitely be making these pancakes again.

These are great! I accidentally put 1 1/2 tbsp. instead of tsp. of sugar and doubled the blueberries. I didn't add the butter to the batter, but they turned out great anyway. A very forgiving recipe. I recommend doubling the blueberries and using fresh instead of frozen. These were a great Valentine's Day treat for my boyfriend. He loved them :)

Pretty good pancakes.  The batter was thick, so next time I might add a little more liquid to make them thinner.  I had a hard time getting them done in the middle.

The blueberries stayed whole and would pop warm juice in your mouth, very good. I am not too fond of the batter but it is ok, just a little flaverless with some baking soda flaver. My husband loved the butter and brown sugar I liked butter and powdered sugar with whipped cream.

Very dense pancakes. We prefer lighter, fluffier. The actual pancakes had no flavor but were decent w/the blueberries & syrup.

Oh my, these are amazilicious! I usually make thin pancakes, crepe-like, and was never really into the thick kind. I had some blueberries that I had to use pronto so I looked on here and decided to give this one a try. I am so glad I did because these are so good and I can't wait to make some for friends and family and try to act humble while they shower me with compliments. Thank you for the great recipe :)

Absolutely delicious recipe!  I add about half a cup more frozen blueberries than the recipe calls for but that's only due to a personal preference and not anything negative on behalf of the original recipe.

Awesome pancakes - I use fresh blueberries too - and more than a 1/2 cup.  I also used almond milk out of necessity, but I don't think that alters the flavor at all.  I've made these several times - sometimes I don't wait the hour - sometimes I do - or sometimes an amount in between.  The longer you wait, the better the texture and fluff-factor.  I make easy blueberry sauce to go on top (1 cup blueberries, 3 T sugar and 1-1/2 T water - cook on medium flame, slightly mashing blueberries.  Cook 5 minutes and stir, then turn down to a very low heat and continue cooking about 8-10 minutes - about 4 light-eater servings)

Yum, great pancakes! I have a couple issues with the details of the recipe, though: 
1) Why the hour wait? It's unnecessary. I didn't wait for an hour and the pancakes were fine.
2) Yields 12 pancakes???? No way, unless you like your pancakes teeny tiny. I made about 5 regular pancakes with this (around 5 inches across). It was just enough for 2 adults.

Made these today - Fabulous! Only changes I made were add a little vanilla and extra blueberries when I poured them into the pan. Made a few extra to stick in the freezer for a quick breakfast!

These were okay.  I didn't have an hour to wait and so I didn't.  These were SO fat and weirdly lacking in taste.  Maybe some more sugar?  Maybe some vanilla?  Something seemed to be missing, even with the blueberries.  The kids enjoyed them tho, which is why I'm giving 4 stars, not 3.

I tried other pancake recipes from this site and this is the best so far (even without the blueberries), and I think part this is due to the amount of baking powder, and there being no baking soda.  These were very good as is, but excellent with the addition of 1/2 tsp vanilla and twice the amount of FRESH blueberries.  Also was just as good with half white and half whole wheat flour.Oh, and you don't need to wait the hour; 15 min is fine.  Thanks!

Very easy to make, but come out delicious!!  We let the batter sit only about 30 mins rather than a full hour, and they still were great.  We topped them with a cream cheese whipped cream and fresh strawberries- THAT made the 5 stars!!

These pancakes are easy to make and very delicious. I used semi sweet mini chocolate chips instead of blueberries. I can't wait to make them again.

I'm rewriting my review for this recipe. I have made this recipe several different ways as suggested by other reviewers and find that the original is still the best. It is well worth the 1 hour wait! Those that modify it, are missing out on the true taste. I usually make them for my kids and I, but this morning my husband finally tried them . He does NOT like pancakes, but he RAVED about these ones. He said that they were tender and moist. When he gives me the thumbs up, then I know we have a keeper of a recipe. The only change I highly recommend is to use FRESH BLUEBERRIES and not the frozen. You do notice a difference in taste and quality. They burst with flavour and they ooze nicely when you cut into the pancake. Definitely a keeper of a recipe (ORIGINAL ONLY)! Thanks for sharing your husband's recipe, Alison!

Served them to my bestfriend and she loved them.  I thought the mix could have been sweeter but the blueberries made the cakes very delicious.

This recipe was really great tasting, but they were thick, so the centers weren't fully cooked. I'll try again and hope that I get the 5 star result everyone else gets. I also used buttermilk because I didn't have milk.

These pancakes were awesome!  I agree that one doesn't have to wait the 1 hour to make them.  As a healthier option, I use part whole-wheat flour/part all-purpose flour, as well as Splenda in the place of sugar.  If you like your pancakes a bit sweeter, add more sweetener.  I used a total of 1/3 cup Splenda and they came out nice.

My son wanted aless sweet blueberry pancake and this was perfect! I actually goofed a little and mixed the butter in with the milk and eggs but it didn't seem to matter. Ok and I probably put in a cup and a half of blueberries :) They were yummy! He had them with syrup butI suggested vanilla yogurt for his next plateful and he liked that much better. I snuck a couple and they were moist and just perfect! Will definitely keep this as one of my favorite recipes!

Unfortunately I don't think you can make them immediately (instead of waiting an hour) as some reviewers have written.  We made them about 15 min after mixing, dropping the blueberries on top, and browning them as usual.  They didn't cook properly through, were very tough, and weren't fluffy at all.  They had a rather chewy texture and weren't flavourful - missing sugar or salt or something.  I don't know if I'd try them again even with the one hour wait.

I just finished eating these and they were so good! They were very fast and easy to make. I added wheat germ in place of some of the flour just to make them a little healthier, I also used fresh blueberries and sprinkled them on top, used oil instead of the melted butter and used the batter right away instead of waiting an hour. I'll also add that it made 7 big pancakes instead of 12. Perfect amount for the three of us.

I've been making flap jacks for years and this recipe is the best I've found on here in a while.  We have a blueberry orchard so we are always looking to add berries to whatever we make.  Thanks Todd, and got any more recipes?

These pancakes are the best!  I use it as both blueberry pancakes and regular pancakes.  I had some bananas left over so I diced them and added some toasted pecans. Yummy.

I wasn't a fan of this recipe. Pancakes were very thin and kept falling apart when I would flip them over. The overall taste was very disappointing.I will stick with Aunt Jemima Buttermilk complete and add my own blueberries.

We thought the flavor was kinda..... plain, bland . We had fresh blueberries and was really hoping for a wow with this recipe, but it just didn't do it for us. Maybe we should have added vanilla?. Blueberries are my favorite food.So i will keep looking for a wow recipe.Thanks.

I make pancakes every Sunday for my teenage sons and we all agreed this wasn't the greatest.  The flavor was a bit bland.  My favorite on this site is Old Fashioned Pancakes, we simply add blueberries if we want them.  It needs more fat and a litte more sugar.

Followed recipe accordingly, wonderful!  I forgot to do this step but if you beat the egg whites stiff then add you will have even fluffier cakes!

Really good! Didn't wait the hour, just added blueberries once I put the pancake batter in the pan and they had cooked for a couple seconds. Great recipe...

Thanks Tricia, this is just what I was looking for. Served these for breakfast in honor of Fourth of July with some blueberry syrup and they were DELICIOUS! I usually keep the leftovers for re-heating during the week in place of frozen storebought pancakes and waffles, but there was nothing left!

I thought these were great. My pancakes usually turn out thin and flat. These puffed up nicely. Only thing I'd do different next time is to give the batter one more stir before pouring out on the griddle. My blueberries sank to the bottom, so my first couple of pancakes had very few berries and my last couple had tons.

Great recipe, I used whole wheat flour, applesauce in place of the butter, Splenda for the sugar, a little cinnamon and fresh blueberries. I did these substitutes because of health issues. Delicious 8/15/10 Made these today using 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 1 tsp Splenda in place of white sugar and 1 Tblsp. unsweetend applesauce in place of melted butter and the rest of the ingredients listed. It made 10 pancakes so on Weight Watchers you can have 2 pancakes  for 3 points.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I have made them twice now and in between times bought Bisquick and made pancakes.....when my husband tried the bisquick ones(not knowing) said they were gross and what was the recipe! So we threw away the box! I am on weight watchers and on pancake is 2pts....YEAH! Also if you don't have time to let them sit for a hour...like me....they still taste great after 30min.

Pretty good recipe.  They were a bit bland, I will add more salt next time, increase to one teaspoon for the undoubled batter.  These were very fluffy pancakes, well suited for fresh blueberries.  Definitely one to work with for future pancake making...smile.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh this is too funny! I was just about to write in saying this was excellent but a little too sugary! I just reread the recipe and realized that I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of teaspoons! Not wonder! But we did love these, we did not put the batter aside and added cinnamon and vanilla. These were very good!

Todd is the man. These were restaurant quality. Really easy, no need to wait the hour suggested. I did add maybe a tablespoon more sugar to make them a little sweeter on their own but the rest I left as directed. My husband and I loved them. They made a great weekend breakfast with maple sausage and real, hot maple syrup. It was like being back in Maine again! Cannot say enough good about this recipe -- would be wonderful with chocolate chips, peaches, pretty much anything you can imagine being good in a pancake. I will never buy store-bought pancake mix again. Bravo Todd!

This is the first time I have publicly rated a recipe. I am a cook at a family camp and I decided to try this recipe out on our first day of camp. We fed 85 people. I actually added cooked wild rice to the recipe as well....it was a huge hit, people kept asking for more, seemed like I never got away from the griddle. We will definitely be using this one again! Great flavor and texture and cooks up nice and evenly, with no mushy centers!

I fully agree with the other posters, more sugar, less baking powder!

I added a little more milk and almost trippled the sugar, (splenda actually.) I also cut the recipe in half and did not let it sit. I used a frozen berry medly from Trader Joes, and crushed up some of the berries with a fork while they were in the batter because they were a little large. This left each pancake with bits of berry in each bite. Yum.

These were very good pancakes.  I halved the baking powder and added about twice the sugar.  I also did not let them set, but cooked them up right away.  This recipe made 3 large pancakes, perfect for a quick breakfast for myself.  Thanks!

I was not impressed.  I normally make the basic pancake recipe out of the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook.  Their pancakes are pretty similar only call for more sugar and oil.  The blueberries didn't make up the difference in flavor with this recipe.  The sweet syrup was the only thing to save this batch.

Used unsweetened almond milk (vanilla flavored) and it still tasted great!  I would add pure maple syrup to the mix next time as these were savory but not very sweet.

I made a few tweaks to this recipe. First, I felt like it needed more flavor so I added some vanilla extract (a teaspoon or so) and I also added a few dashes of cinnamon to the mix. The mix itself was way too dry so I had to add a couple more tablespoons of milk to make it wet enough. I didn't let the mix sit for an hour either, it's not necessary.

These were pretty good. I did have to add some extra milk to create the right consistency of the batter. It also made the pancakes a lot fluffier

I made these for my husband & 6 yr old son. They were awesome the morning we ate them but I doubled recipe so I cooked them all and froze the rest. We ate them this weekend and they were just as good. I am making them again today with blueberries & going to substitute bananas & walnuts as well and freeze them all again. I did use all fresh fruit, no frozen. Didn't wait the hour and they were just fine.

First I doubled the recipe & added one pint of fresh blueberries. After reading some of the reviews I went ahead and made the batter the night before since I was making them at work. Pancakes can out so light and fluffy. Excellent recipe- everyone who tried it loved it and passed the recipe on.

This recipe was delicious! But I had to add a few things.Fresh blueberries are best, I added about 2 tsps more sugar and 2 and a 1/4 teaspoons vanilla.You don't have to let it sit for an hour.o
But ultimately, this recipe was great and I will definitely make it again!

Delicious as written if you add butter and brown sugar.   I don't normally add syrup or brown sugar so second time used 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Third time used full cup of blueberries.   Perfect.

Fluffy, flavorful and cakey without being doughy or raw in the middle. I added a little vanilla to the milk/egg mixture. Otherwise followed the recipe. Now I want to know... who is this TODD and when can he fix me breakfast? ;)

These were very good, tasty pancakes! I took the advice of other reviewers and did not wait an hour to cook them...Next time I will try the butter and brown sugar...Is there a recipe for that? I would like to know how much butter, brown sugar...Do you cook it in a saucepan? Or just sprinkle the brown sugar on top of the butter on top of the pancakes? Also, being a blueberry lover, I think topping the pancakes with fresh blueberries would make them even more terrific!

I was really impressed at the low amount of sugar and fat compared to my previous recipes. I used whole wheat flour, coconut fat instead of butter, and because I ran out of baking powder I subbed lemon juice and baking soda. These were great plain without any syrup.

Delicious! I didn't wait an hour (I didn't wait at all) and they turned out perfect. I did increase the sugar a tiny bit. Next time I will double the recipe because with 4 hungry kids it barely made enough. In fact, my one son had a bowl of cereal once the pancakes were all gone.

Yes! Great pancakes! I always double it so we can freeze some. And I always add more blueberries! You can use buttermilk instead of milk and/or add a dash of vanilla for more flavor, if you need it. Give the batter at least 30 minutes so the flour can absorb the liquid - the secret to fluffiness. If you use frozen blueberries, don't let them thaw. Fresh or frozen, good idea to drop them on the pancakes right after you pour them onto the griddle.

A little bland and EXTREMELY thick. This recipe only made 4 pancakes because they were so thick. I like thick pancakes but it wasn't a batter, it was a dough. :(

Followed the recipe exactly as written which resulted in a thick batter. The first pancake that I made was thick and doughy so I added a little milk to the batter which helped a bit but they were still very disappointing.  Not sure how this recipe got good reviews!

Allison, thank you for posting this recipe. I have made it three times now. There is too much baking powder flavor in it. We found the flavor overpowered everything. Is it possible to make this without so much baking powder?

Excellent pancakes! I also add the blueberries to the tops of the pancakes once on the griddle (or I make a compote to dollop on top of the pancakes once on the table - yum!). But to add a bit more flavor, I also add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and sometimes a bit of cinnamon to the batter. I have made them where I've waited an hour and I've made them after sitting for only about ten minutes and honestly, I can't tell the difference, so I don't wait the hour anymore.

Good recipe.  I have made buttermilk blueberry pancakes so many times over the years I have the recipe imprinted on my brain.  The biggest difference in my recipe is to substitute fresh buttermilk for MOST of the regular milk, then actually INSERT the blueberrys in the batter as it's cooking on the griddle--before you turn them.  I also use a little more baking powder than soda, and add some melted butter to the batter.  Good flavor.  Be careful though, the blueberry's get pretty hot and can burn if the get chomped on immediately.

My 2 1/2 year old grandson helped me make these this morning, so they're definitely easy. We couldn't wait the whole hour, so only waited 20 minutes. They were fluffy and delicious. The only problem was my grandson who adores blueberries fresh would not eat them. Something about the texture when they are cooked, or who knows?? Kids! Anyway his mom and I loved them. I would strongly recommend using fresh blueberries, and you can double the amount to 1 cup without having too many berries.

Not sure what this is supposed to be. Thick, tough, no flavor except the blueberry.

This recipe is great!  Used other's ideas of making night before.  For those that found it flavourless, adding sugar &/or salt doesn't add flavour it adds health problems.  Try adding a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla or other extract.  We dropped a bit of liquid cinnamon extract in and wow!  Blueberry & cinnamon, mmmmm

Made these twice and NOT GOOD either time.  Very bland and not pancake like at all.  Keep looking or stick with what you already know before making these.

I was really excited about these pancakes based off of the reviews, but they did not live up to my expectations. They were a bit rubbery, not fluffy like many people said. Next time I may just go back to using pancake mix.

The batter was too thick to cook completely through on medium heat without burning. Next time I'll add more liquid. Flavor and texture was very good though.

These pancakes were delicious, cooked up perfectly with frozen blueberries added on top of the batter in the pan. Will definitely make again, much better than boxed mix.

It IS necessary to add the melted butter into the batter.
If you don't add the butter into the batter the pancake won't rise as much and it will be more tough and chewy.

You can use olive oil as a replacement for the melted butter and that's yummy!

I tried this recipe and after adding a tablespoon of sugar and a tad more milk it was AMAZING!!! I did use frozen organic mountain blueberries and washed them really well and they did just fine. I made these for my kids and they already are asking when can they get them again. I didn't wait the hour as listed and I found them to be just fine. Really fluffy and just a must have recipe in everyone's box! Thanks!

Awesome. I used vanilla almond milk, added cinnamon & did not let it sit for 1hr (no need). I also added the frozen berries on top of the pancakes just after I put them in the fry pan.

I used fresh blueberries (dropped in each one) and didn't have an hour to let the batter sit. They turned out good. I would definitely make these again.

The batter was more like dough than batter.  Then when I tried to cook it it didn't cook through and was gummy and thick.  I tried to thin the rest out and it still didn't work.  No bubbling like you see when you cook good pancakes.

These were good but perhaps a little too cakey for me. As beautiful as thick, fluffy pancakes look, the syrup just sort if disappears into them. I think I like a thinner pancake better.

Nice fluffy pancake with just the right amount of blueberries. I would say letting the mix sit an hour was a bit too much. I like my pancake mix to spread on its own when I pour onto griddle but after letting this sit for the whole hour I had to spread it out myself. I used fresh blueberries and that made the pancakes taste good, otherwise not really too much flavor in the pancake itself.

Great recipe!  I NEVER manage to make fluffy pancakes and these came out great!  I did wait the hour and it seems to make the batter much airy-er.  I would also recommend to put the blueberries on the pancake directly after pouring it, instead of mixing with the batter before, but they turned out great either way!  I ended up adding more blueberries.

Great recipe! I didn't wait the hour (more like 20 min.) to cook these as I had 3 hungry kids waiting for breakfast. I don't know if it made a difference. Did not change a thing, except used fresh blueberries and didn't stir them into batter, but placed on top of pancake while cooking. YUM. Will make again.

These are fantastic!  The first time i made them, i waited the full hour... the next time I was short on time so i just made them straight away.... to be honest, I didn't notice any difference, and neither did the family!  Sometimes i use fresh blueberries in there as well... and I add a little vanilla and cinnamon as well.  Sometimes i also mush a banana into the mixture for a nice banana flavor (the family doesn't seem to like the chunks of banana- i just use a masher to mix it all in nicely for flavor!)

Made a big batch of these pancakes to throw in the freezer for easy breakfasts. I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour, added a touch of vanilla extract, some cinnamon, and a bit more sugar. Used fresh blueberries. Easy peasy and yummy!

I was a little skeptical of having to let the recipe sit for an hour but it must have done the triick because these were the best pancakes i've made.  Fluffy and flavourful.  My 22 month old gobbled them up!  I added a touch of vanilla and cinammon to the mix before letting them sit. Perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe for blueberry pancakes! When I made them, I didn't have any sugar on hand, but I don't think leaving that little teaspoon out affected the taste very much... they were still very delicious! Also, there really is no need to wait one hour - you can make them as soon you prepare them!

Amazingly Good! These are the best blueberry pancakes I have ever tasted. I made them with dried wild blueberries which I rehydrated in the cup of milk the recipe calls for.

I thought these turned out great. Only changes I made was to make the batter(-berries) the night before so it was nice and thick. Added berries after pouring 1/4 batter into pan. I did add just a dash of cinnamon to the  frozen berries. Made a nice juice that I added a tsp of cornstarch to and thickened then added the rest of the unused berries. YUM

Deeelish!!! I do think they need a little more sugar, even though I added 2tbs. Will probably take it to 4tbs next time. My kids love blueberries and they loved these pancakes :)

me and my husband always get into a fight about the correct way to make pancakes. This morning, I had enough of his pancake communism. I made my own using this recipe and they were amazing. Even the hubby ate half of mine instead of his own mediocre ones. Thanks to this recipe, I am now the undisputed pancake champion.

These were allright... certainly nothing special or the best pancakes I've ever had. My hubs and I both felt these were too dense and bland tasting. After reading many of the reviews on here, I see that several people did a little "doctoring" by adding more sugar and in some cases, subbing buttermilk for the milk called for. I think both are a good idea. The blueberries are definitely star here and are what gives these pancakes their sweetness (the batter itself is pretty tasteless - so don't leave the blueberries out!). Unlike most everyone else, I allowed my batter to sit for a full hour as directed. I'm not sure if this affected the outcome or not, but I at least wanted to try Allison's recipe as is. After all, that's what makes Todd's pancakes famous. :) I DID add my blueberries to each pancake after drizzling the batter onto my griddle tho ( because my hubs does not like fruit). I'm glad to have given your husband's recipe a try, but I think I'll stick with my go-to pancake recipe from now on. Thanks anyways, Allison! :-)

Delicious!  Better than going out for breakfast.  I make the batter, and then get the kids ready and then cook.  So it never sits for an hour, but it is still light and fluffy.

I followed the recipe to a t.  My batter was super thick.  I triple checked to make sure I had the measurements correct.  It was so thick, that when I was ready to cook it, it was difficult to scoop onto griddle.  It wouldn't cook all of the way though.  I added 1/2 cup milk to second batch before cooking, and it was better, but not fantastic.  I'm disappointed I wasn't able to enjoy the same great pancakes everyone else raved about in other reviews.

Absolutely Delicious!! I did however, double the blueberries, add 1/2 tsp vanilla, used buttermilk, and increased the sugar to 1 tbsp, my husband and son both said that they were the best blueberry pancakes that they ever had!!

These were fantastic! I also did not let it sit for an hour, and they seem to turn out just perfect!  Also, i dropped my blueberries on the pancake after it was on my griddle, as to not squish them through out the batter when being folded!  My new favorite pancake recipe :)

These pancakes were the best I've made in a while - easy recipe, very fluffy and cooked evenly.  I was in a hurry to use the batter, so I didn't wait like the recipe says to!  I added a little more milk than called to to thin the batter a bit.  I also added blueberries and the batter was the perfect consistency for that.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful pancakes! I didn't wait an hour, but they were still terrific. Next time I will plan ahead and wait the hour, although I can't see how these can be better. They were the best pancakes I have ever made.

UGH! I can't afford to add another bill as a supporting member on this site, but I customized this recipe in a nifty way I wanted to share. Our son is allergic to eggs and I am constantly trying to work around this. This is the best recipe I've found where I can use 1/2 of a frozen banana in place of the egg and the pancake still turned out with a pancake-like texture. That has not been my experience with "egg replacer" products. The key to it is to use a food processor to 'almost' liquify the banana before adding the milk and continuing to process another few seconds (it ends up looking like a frozen yogurt), then follow the rest of the recipe as directed. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/8tsp of almond extracts to balance out the banana flavor which is otherwise pretty strong. Superb!

These were no doubt fluffy but like others said, they were bland. Definitely could use more blueberries and flavor. But its a good starter recipe. I always make according to the recipe the first time, but the next time I make these, I will make plenty of changes and have a different' recipe

These were really good. My dad is a diabetic and I appreciate the small amount of sugar. I used whole wheat pastry flour to make them more nutritious.

This is my favourite blueberry pancake recipe of all time! It's so easy to make even for a beginner like me and they taste great. The consistency of the pancakes are perfect. Thank you for sharing this with us.

I was craving blueberry pancakes today and was sorely disappointed by this recipe. I followed it exactly, even letting the batter sit for an hour, and what I got were dense, bland cakes that were difficult to cook through without burning. I think cutting some of the baking powder would help with the texture, but the taste was still too floury. I picked out the delicious blueberries. Would not recommend.

These are some seriously delicious and fluffy pancakes - this recipe is excellent! 
I doubled the sugar because I like it sweet. I also substituted canola oil for the butter. And you don't need to wait an hour before cooking them.

These were okay...but not exactly what I was looking for.  They were heavy and not light and fluffy like I had hoped.  Will probably try a different recipe next time.

I absolutely will never use another blueberry pancake recipe. These are so fluffy, tender, and all around yummy. I didn't even wait the hour because I have very impatient children and they turned out wonderfully. I even make these in large batches and freeze them for quick breakfasts in the mornings. Thank you so much.

as a blueberry fanatic i wasn't thrilled about this recipe..... the batter was very bland, which made me give it 1 star because of the fact that the batter is suppose to be the "biggest factor" of a pancake..... to tell you the truth I would rather buy a pre-made pancake mix...... :/

I didn't care for these pancakes. I followed the recipe exactly but they were in-edible. I even double checked that I did the recipe right and I did the whole wait an hour thing. Sorry, not sure what went wrong

Just made these pancakes and they are wonderful. I took the advice of other reviews and added more sugar (2.5 TBL) 1 cup blueberries, and tsp vanilla. Best I have ever eaten, even at the best restaurants. They came out perfect. The only reason I think the recipe calls for you to wait 1 hr is to give the frozen blueberries a chance to get soft. Remedy...use fresh or put frozen in micro for just a few to thaw. Works well. Make right away, that is what I did.

I had a lot of blueberries that I had to use up and I didn't have a box of pancake mix, so I used this recipe.  Let's just say that I will never purchase a box mix again!  I used King Arthur White Wheat Flour to up the nutrition.  I'll be making these again and often!

Very good recipe! I added a bit more milk, since the batter was dry, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla and  used 1 cup fresh blueberries. They were very flavorful and fluffy.

These were delicious. I used fresh blueberries, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because they are not a pancake you can eat alone; syrup or extra butter/sugar are needed as they are not very sweet.

Absolutely awesome!! After reading all the other comments I didn't bother to wait the full hour. I barely waited 2 minutes before cooking them, doesn't matter though, these were AWESOME!!! They DO NOT make enough for a family of 4 though, expect to have to at least double the recipe! If you have big eaters (or boys) you might want to triple it!

I have made this recipe several times since I've been in Korea. I can find all the ingredients in an ordinary Lotte Mart so it is pretty convenient for me. I agree that I can't tell much difference between waiting half an hour and waiting an hour. Also the last time, rather than folding them into the batter, I left out the frozen blueberries while the batter was sitting (to thaw) and then put them on top of the pancakes while they were on the griddle. as suggested by Alton Brown. I think they came out a lot better ^_^

These were good...my qualms: not sweet enough, they needed more sugar! Also, the recipe says it yields 12, but i barely got 5! If you plan on making these for more than 2 or 3 people, I would double the recipe.

Very fluffy pancakes, but not a whole lot of flavor.  Could use more sugar and/or vanilla.  I prefer buttermilk pancakes, but if you don't have buttermilk on hand, these are easy to make.  Also, don't mix the blueberries in or it will turn your cakes green like some have complained about.  After pouring mix on griddle, place blueberries on top - use more berries than recipe calls for!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. These pancakes were fluffy but they were bland..not enough sugar..i ended up throwing out the rest of them because no one wanted them..i was very disappointed after reading all of the great reviews.

Great pancakes!  Not heavy at all!  I added 2 tsp. vanilla and set mixture aside for 15 mins.  I dropped fresh bluberries onto pancakes while cooking and brushed them with melted smart balance butter after flipping. Great on a cold snowy day when school and work have been cancelled. Will make again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

The only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 tsp vanilla b/c I like that in my pancakes and I did not thaw the berries.  Also did not wait to cook and they were awesome.  My favorite blueberry pancake recipe.

I just made these as I had fresh blueberries on hand  REVIEWS  were so high in praise I HAD TO make them even though I wanted to use the recipe on the side of the Buttermilk container. Mere Male said they were good - had sprinkled with sugar & wanted them again. ONLY change - I waited ONLY 40 minutes. For me - Great fluffy batter A bit Over Hyped Very similar to recipe - GOOD OLD FASHIONED PANCAKES minus the berries. Should you make them? ABSOLUTELY YES

After reading all the great reviews I was expecting some fabulous blueberry pancakes with this recipe. But these weren't it. They were ok, but nothing special. I've had better.

Good recipe.  I added the blueberries after the batter was in the pan (just sprinkled them in frozen) and it worked great.

This makes a nice thick pancake, good for holding the blueberries.  The flavor of the pancake is a little lacking.

These pancakes are AMAZING!!! I leave out the blueberries and add chocolate chips to mine, and I never set it aside for an hour.  These are THE BEST pancakes I've ever had.  So fluffy, yet dense.  I don't even use syrup.  Thank you, Todd!

This is an awesome pancake recipe!  I've made this at least 5 times since I found the recipe.  I've only added blueberries once.  I usually triple the recipe and freeze some pancakes for easy breakfasts later in the week.  Yum!

Really good and easy to make. I made one pancake, tasted it and it was bland so I added more sugar and some vanilla extract and it tasted great! I also did not wait one hour to cook.

Very good pancake, I put a 1 cup regular flour and a 1/4 cup wheat flour in them, turned out great, nice and fluffy, didn't have time to wait the whole hour but at twenty minutes they were still delicious!

Excellent!  I made this with bananas instead of blueberries and didn't wait at all for the batter to rise - the pancakes were still fluffy.  What I especially like about this recipe is the texture of the pancakes - they were study and didn't fall apart when I flipped them.  They also turned a nice golden color.

I'll admit that I didn't wait at all before cooking- I had 5 hungry kids wanting to eat NOW!  I made fairly small pancakes, but only got 9.  I didn't think they were quite sweet enough, and I could really taste the baking powder.  They're nagging me to make more, so I think I'll increase the sugar to a tablespoon and see if that helps.

Wow, these were GREAT!  I didn't wait an hour before making these and they still turned out wonderful!  I used fresh blueberries and canola oil instead of butter.  I also added some wheat germs for extra nutrition.  I will make these again!!

Well worth the hour wait while the batter sits.  Incredibly light and fluffy!  However, this recipe doesn't make very many pancakes, so adjust accordingly.  I found this recipe only made 6 good size pancakes.  Thanks.

These pancakes were excellent!  Light, fluffy, and enjoyed by everyone.  The batter only sat for about 20 min, while I was doing other things and it turned out great.  As written, the recipe doesn't make alot so I did double it for the four of us and that was just the right amount.

Very good and what I liked was that it was easy to throw together quickly. I doubled the recipe in order to have leftovers. I put some blueberries in the batter and added additional ones while they were cooking on the griddle. I also added a little extra sugar, almond extract and a dash of apple pie spice. Very good!! Like other reviewers mentioned, no need to let the batter sit. Can be used right away.

These were good!  I used fresh blueberries and added a 1/2 cup extra to the batter.  I also made homemade strawberry syrup (the recipe for the syrup is on this site as well) and put whipped cream on top.  Yum!

Super pancakes, but... you'll need to at LEAST double the batch if you're cooking for more than 3 people (and aren't planning to serve a lot of other breakfast food). They turned out very moist and light, great texture and taste! We used fresh berries.

We loved this recipe!  I prefer my pancakes to not be super sweet, so this worked well for us.  I swapped splenda for sugar and it worked perfectly.  I used the remainder of my blueberries to to create a syrup, just cooked them down with a couple tablespoons of butter and honey..YUMM!

Rubber. That's what these were like but I suppose since I left out the blueberries (for a picky 9 year old), that could be why though I can NEVER see these being "fluffy" even with the blueberries.  This recipe should not be used for plain pancakes....I'll keep looking.

Great! Although I, like others, thought it could be a tad sweeter. Next time I will add more sugar. And there WILL be a next time. :)

I loved this recipe!  I cut it in half and still ended up eating it all in one sitting.  I used fresh blueberries and only let the batter sit a half hour.  I added an extra handful of berries.  The brown sugar was a nice topping.  I also used butter and powdered sugar which might help for those that think the recipe needs more sugar (it's like having icing on top of your pancakes).

This is so good! Light and fluffy. I'm used to plainer food so this worked well for me. For those of you who prefer more flavor, you might need to add more sugar or have it with syrup. I didn't have any blueberry so I just made it as it is without the berries. I paired the pancakes with strawberry reserve and coffee. So yum!!! My first time making pancakes and this is so easy. Next time I'll probably add some cinnamon.

I made these as written, except used fresh berries. Used a 1/4 cup for scooping and got 8  fluffy, yummy pancakes. My husband, who always asks for the Banana Pancakes I from this site, actually said he'd take these too for variety now. That's huge coming from him as he likes no other pancakes since the first time I made those. Thanks for sharing.

Loved it! Didn't bother waiting 1 hour this time. Sprinkled blueberries while cooking so they didn't get smashed (I used frozen). Thank you!

Mmmmm...these were really good!  No matter what pancake recipe I decide to make I always have to add extra milk, I like my pancakes a bit on the thin side.

The texture of these were fabulous, but we found that the bitterness of the baking powder and the sourness of the blueberries were overwhelming.  I added more sugar and the next ones out of the pan turned out great.  Will make these again with some tweaks.  Thanks!

My family was excited about trying this recipe.  Unfortunately, we thought it was flavorless.  We didn't have any problems with texture as other reviewers mentioned, just lack of flavor.  Sorry!

I keep thinking i must have done something wrong because i found these pancakes to be quite heavy. The only thing i did different was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I even let it rest for the hour as written. The flavor was good, just didn't get the light and fluffy pancakes i was expecting. Probably will not make again.

Yummy!  I used 1/2 c almond flour and 3/4 c ap flour.  I substituted almond milk for regular milk.  Unfortunately I didn't have an hour to wait, so after 30 minutes I put them on the griddle.  They smelled wonderful and tasted better!  Next time I will add the blueberries while they are on the griddle instead of in the mix.  My only complaint is that the recipe says it makes six servings, but I only got 13 smaller sized pancakes.  Easy to fix, I'll just double it next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I like a sweeter taste.  I'm thinking about soaking blueberries in sugar water before mixing them in.  Great recipe, easy to make.  Doesn't need to be set aside for an hour.  Family LOVED it.

Great recipe!  I like to mash the blueberries a little bit before folding them in so that I end up with bits and pieces of blueberry goodness in every bite. Yum!

Yum, very good. The blueberries were perfect for its fluffy consistency. The only change I made was that I got impatient and only let the batter sit for half an hour, but they still turned out fluffy and good. I'll definitely make these again.

I made these for diner last night and they were PRIMO !!
I took the advice of others & only added 3/4 T. baking soda & increased the sugar,  used 1/2 c. each regular & buttermilk,  it thickned up a bit too much so used a touch more buttermilk.  Just dropped the blueberry's on top and that worked just fine with the really ripe berry's I had.  I must say that I'm not a pancake fan but.......Todd's are the best !

This is a great recipe.  I used fresh blueberries, which I chopped slightly for the ease of my young children.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I allowed the batter to set 30 minutes, while I prepared other things, and the pancakes were very good.  Thank you for your pancake recipe!

These were pretty good, I used fresh blueberries and added around a teaspoon of vanilla. I thought the batter was a bit thick since it was not spreading into a decent sized pancake on the pan, I had to add in around 1/3 cup of milk for it to be workable.

A very solid pancake recipe.  I did make a few small adjustments.  I didn't set the batter aside for an hour and I also didn't mix in the blueberries a head of time.  Instead I just dropped some into the batter as it was cooking.  I was afraid if I mixed them in the batter that it would all settle to the bottom.

These were just ok the first time I made them.  I didn't think the pancakes themselves had much flavor (had to add some fresh whipped cream on top).  This time though, I substituted half the milk for lowfat buttermilk...WOW! Gave the pancakes a great sweetness.  Try it for yourself...you'll love it.

Extremely bland made as the recipe directs.  Though these were tender (not overmixing the batter and letting it rest 10 minutes)these were boring.

I don't make pancakes often, but when I do I will use this recipe!  I halved the baking powder and used fresh blueberries... next time I might try someones suggestion of adding 1 tsp. of pure vanilla.

I'd say that these are just alright.  They aren't something that I'd make again because they were dry.  Also, we were looking for pancakes as good as "Veronica's Apple Pancakes."  That's some stiff competition!

Not what I was expecting.
They tasted good but they were awfully thin pancakes. The batter seemed nice and think too but the pancakes just came out thin and flat. They just didn't seem very pancakey.
They didn't bubble right in the center to let me know they were ready to be flipped.
Maybe it was something I did? Although I have never seemed to have that problem when making pancakes before.
But they still had a very nice taste and were a great way to eat your fruit servings.

These pancakes were great.  I am going to use the batter as my normal pancake recipe also.

These pancakes turned out really good. I followed the recipe as it is and added a few more blueberries. Everyone loved them.

These pancakes were lackluster and were a waste of blueberries.  Blueberries are very expensive where we live.  Based on other reviews I did add a little more sugar than was called for and they still were not sweet enough. I made my batter the night before so it had plenty of time to sit.  I would not make these pancakes again. I would agree with someone else who said to make a standard Buttermilk pancake and just add the blueberries to the batter.

By far, the best pancake I've ever had. It never fails. I always use fresh blueberries and let the batter rest as suggested for the fluffiest texture! Delicious with brown sugar and butter - thanks for the suggestion!

I doubled up on the blueberries and added a bit more sugar. They were perfect. I have never made pancakes from scratch (always been a mix person). 
I'll be making these again very soon!

Great pancakes.  I followed the recipe, except that I used 3/4 c. (give or take) chopped fresh strawberries and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and I only let the batter rest for 20 min. They were definitely some of the best pancakes I have ever made--not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, and not too light.  They browned perfectly and cooked all the way through, and were easy to flip.        One tip for making good pancakes is to not let your pan get too hot, because it will result in burned outsides and uncooked insides (I always set my heat to med. or med high, depending on the stove, and remove the pan from heat in between batches).

We have a long-standing tradition in my family of Sunday morning pancakes, and I have tried dozens of recipes to find the "perfect" one for my family. I did find it and have stuck with that one recipe for many years. But I decided to give this one a try because I do love blueberry pancakes. I don't think the flavor was quite there, and it really is a pancake of the "cake" variety ... quite thick, not at all light. The syrup and butter just kind of rolled off of them. Perhaps pancakes are like spaghetti sauce where each family has their own favorite version. I also think there are two parts to making great pancakes: first you need the great recipe, and then you need to get the technique down of making them so they don't turn out heavy and overcooked. I didn't care for these much, although it's not a bad recipe, but I won't make it again.

I thought one tablespoon of baking powder would make the pancakes taste too bitter so I added 2 1/2 teaspoons. I didn't let the batter sit for an hour because I didn't have time but they still turned out good. Just for my personal taste, I would add more sugar next time and more blueberries!

These pancakes are excellent - not too sweet, great texture, and very simple and basic recipe. i didn't even see the part to let the batter sit for one hour, and i'm glad - i probably would have passed this recipe by! i used boysenberries instead of blueberries, and topped them with crushed boysenberries, bananas and whipped cream -just perfect!

I'll admit, I never follow recipes exactly and to this one I used about 2 tbs of powdered sugar and a tbs of honey.  I also added about a cup a blueberries.  This was a great hit with my family!

This recipe said to cook the pancakes on med/hi heat. This only led to burned outsides and raw insides. I did turn down the heat but only had a little batter left to make decent pancakes. What a waste of big, beautiful blueberries!

Yum yum yum. She's right, well worth the hour wait. I didn't have to change a thing about this recipe and I even topped the pancakes with butter and brown sugar like the submitter suggests. I've tried many pancake recipes on this site and this is one of the best. Thank you.

These were sooooo good, and worth the wait. I always make pancakes with buttermilk, though, and they turn out a little moister.  (Use 1T vinegar + 1C milk to make buttermilk.)  Thanks for the great recipe!  I wish my husband could cook like this!

Gee, I wish MY husband would make me pancakes...especially if he used this recipe!  Followed the recipe to the letter and they tasted pretty good.  I used the "hour" wait to set the table, clean up my mess, make the coffee, and warm the syrup and the plates...probably not a full hour.  The batter was pretty thick and the pancakes rose while cooking to nearly 1/2 inch thick!  But they were light, and cooked perfectly all the way through.  Not too sweet, and definitely not doughy.  Next time I think I will thin the batter after it sits with a bit of milk.  We gobbled them up!  Thanks for sharing!

I was horrified when after I made the batter I discovered that my blueberries were rotten. So as a substitute, I used some fresh strawberries instead, and the pancakes still turned out WONDERFUL! My fiance was equally impressed as I was. Definitely my favorite pancake recipe so far. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

Very happy with these pancakes. From my one-year-old to my picky husband, everyone was satisfied. These get nice and fluffy, and look great served. I used frozen (defrosted) blueberries and didn't have any trouble with them turning the pancakes blue. This will be our family's permanent blueberry pancake recipe!

This is well worth the wait.  I forgot to put in the melted butter and this recipe came out light and fluffy.  I've made this recipe four times and it is consistent in every way.  I've used fresh and frozen blueberries and there is no difference.

Thanks, Todd!

I made these for my wife this morning and she said, "These are the best pancakes!"

We topped them with the Cinnabutter recipe from allrecipes.com and REAL maple syrup. Yum!

I like the fact that you had to wait an hour - gave me a chance to clean up the mess I made.  But I didn't know if the batter should wait in the fridge or on the counter.

This was a great pancake recipe!  My 16 yr old daughter made it for Nat'l Pancake week.  Since we are cutting out extra fat, we used egg beaters and skim milk and they were still delicious.  We tried some w/blueberries and some without, the plain were liked better by our family, we are not blueberry fans.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the worst pancakes I‚Äôve ever made. There were so many great reviews, I thought I was missing out on something, so I went for it. Followed the recipe exactly...they were absolutely tasteless. I threw the batter out after tasting a couple. Don‚Äôt waste your ingredients with this one. Ugh

Because I am lazy, I rushed the recipe and mixed all the ingredients together at indecency then immediately cooked the pancakes. And guess what?  They turned out great!  I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen and as mentioned previously, didn‚Äôt wait the hour and they turned out fluffy and great. Excellent recipe!

Hands down the best pancakes I've ever made!  I did make two adjustments after I read others comments.
I was out of white sugar so used brown sugar and increased it to 1 1/2 T.  I also added 1/2 t vanilla, since other reviewers said it lacked some flavor.  Made 8 good sized pancakes.

This is my regular, go-to pancake for weekend mornings. I've tried many recipes and these are the fluffiest. Fresh blueberries and pure maple syrup take them to the next level! Also, I use coconut oil instead of butter and it gives them an aromatic hint that we love! Agree with some of the other reviews that it's not necessary to wait the hour upfront. And I don't mix the blueberries into the batter, I just drop them in while the pancake is cooking on the griddle.

I combined this with a recipe I found online for London Fog pancakes (the original was rubbery and this recipe is so soft and fluffy). I kept almost everything the same with a few updates. I added an extra tablespoon of milk and simmered it with three Earl Gray tea bags and a teaspoon of lavender buds. I also upped the sugar to a quarter cup, added a half teaspoon of vanilla, and a teaspoon of tea leaves to the flour mix. It was perfect

Will make again. Used whole wheat flour and fresh bbs because they were on hand. You have to watch the bottom as they don't bubble around the edges like other pancakes. Keep the heat low because they are thick and take a while to cook through and you don't want to burn the outsides.

Made this using fresh blueberries and they came out delicious! Only thing I added was a dash of vanilla,  and I used 2tsp sugar (more out of laziness since the spoon was already in my hand). As others have stated there's, no need to wait an hour before making these. This recipe makes a very thick batter so consider reducing the heat to ensure the centers are cooked through. *apologies for adding two photos...didn't know the first one saved already.

Wow! These are everything thing I hoped they‚Äôd be! So fluffy and delicious! I did not wait an hour but did follow the recipe otherwise! I was afraid they would taste like a biscuit with such little sugar, but once you too it with syrup (I prefer powdered sugar) they were perfect! Thanks for this recipe! It‚Äôs a keeper!!!

Very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly with substitution of 2 packets of Splenda for the sugar since we don't eat sugar. I didn't have time and let the pancake mixture sit at R.T. for 10 minutes before cooking. They  were fluffy and delicious.

I must have done something wrong but I have no idea what. This came out like a bread dough recipe. It was so thick and stick together, I couldn‚Äôt get it out of the measuring cup as is. I did one sample and it was soooo thick and the center was raw. I ended up adding more milk to the rest but maybe not enough because it was still very thick and took forever to cook through. I tried it by itself with no blueberries and it‚Äôs very plain. I‚Äôll try it again with more sugar and maybe some vanilla.

Great recipe! The first secret to fluffy is mixing the egg and milk separately. Secondly, the wait is well worth it!

Great alone or with any fruit!

I was unsure about making this without baking soda, but 
O

Goodness!!  I made the following changes to this recipe and my husband and I loved them!  I used 2 eggs, 3/4 teaspoon sugar, not quite 1 3/4 c flour and 1 cup of thawed frozen blueberries.  The rest period is definitely worth the wait.  I added thinly sliced bananas to a medium heat melted butter non-stick pan and covered with batter.   Dusted with powdered sugar and drizzle of maple syrup?  Mmmmm good!  I made some without banana and they were fantastic too!  Definitely recommend!

This was a wonderful recipe!
You could easily substitute the blueberries with pecans, mini chocolate chips, etc.
I'm always trying to find the "perfect homemade pancake recipe" as it seems my family uses Bisquick a lot of the time for such.
I will definitely be making this again!

Good texture and fluffiness and good suspension of blueberries but I found the baking soda flavor to be kind of overwhelming, even with syrup.

These were excellent.  I usually make whole wheat pancakes, but really enjoyed these.  I thought it was too much baking powder, but went ahead and added it since there were so many good reviews.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  After the first one, which was perfect, I thought the batter had gotten thicker and added more milk and I wish I had not.  The rest were OK, but not as fluffy and yummy as the first.

I've probably tried at least a couple dozen pancake recipes over the years, and this will get added to the list as one of the best.  I doubled the recipe, used half whole milk and half buttermilk and added extra blueberries (can't have too many blueberries!).  Maple syrup and extra butter on top made a Sunday breakfast perfect.

Last night I picked lowbush cranberries and thought I want to try cranberry pancakes. Made this recipe for breakfast - only change was I doubled it and added cranberries instead of blueberries - even my pancake hating husband could not get over them! I am saving this pancake recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I could only let mine sit for about 15 minutes.  The batter was very thick.  Next time I might try adding maybe 1/4 cup more milk.  Even still, the pancakes (all six of them) turned out very fluffy.  The taste was also somewhat bland.  Perhaps a 1/4 teaspon or so of vanilla extract might help.  I will definitely try these again.

These are seriously yummy! I've made them multiple times and follow the recipe exactly, except where it calls for waiting 1 hour. I usually just make the batter and then heat my pan after everything is mixed. Waiting that 10 minutes still allows the batter to fluff up from the baking powder.

As I was making these I was thinking, these don't seem that different from any other recipe...but they are amazing!!! Other than using fresh blueberries from the farmers market, I followed this recipe to the tee. Maybe the hour wait really does help, these were so fluffy and flavorful, me new go to recipe.

Fluffy and moist with the perfect amount of blueberries. My daughters helped make this recipe and our visiting family just raves and raves about how good the pancakes were. My daughters feel like superstars!

As others have said this is great with fresh blueberries and does not need the setting time. I also substituted gluten free flour and the results are amazing.

Pretty good even without the 1-hour set-up time. I added blueberries after pouring batter on the griddle so the batter doesn‚Äôt turn blue.

Simply the best pancake recipe.  Great plain or mixed with anything.  They are a bit more on dense side, which I like.  Our kids are not big eaters, so I have used condensed milk to get more bang for the buck.  If you like dense pancakes, doing it like this will make you smile!

i don't understand what i did wrong.... way too thick, it was burned on the outside and raw on the inside like some kind of ice cream sandwich. WAY too much baking soda makes it inflate like a balloon, and gives it a weird taste. way too dry too... and why on earth would i wait an hour for it!!!! these pancakes ruined my life.

My husband loves it! Best pancakes ever! I'm going to do this again. I did not wait for the one hour wait. I did add two teaspoons more sugar and two tablespoons of milk so I could have the consistency that I like. Thank you Todd and Alison!

Didn't wait the hour, used fresh blueberries, and a cast iron skillet. By far the best blueberry pancakes I have ever eaten. I just spread some butter on top and didn't even bother with syrup.

My first successful homemade blueberry pancakes! I cut the recipe in half (except for the sugar) because I was only cooking for me. I ended up with 3 large fluffy pancakes. I also added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and I added the blueberries while on the griddle. Can‚Äôt wait to try it with bananas.  I will for sure be using this recipe over and over!

Great just as written! I slipped up and mixed in the melted butter with milk and egg, no adverse affect. Also good without the wait. If you wait the batter out the flavors meld and some what intensify. I will probably wait and double it next time.

Batter was super thick after waiting the hour.  I should have thinned it with more milk, but I went ahead.  The result was a nearly 1" thick pancake that took a long time to cook to get the inside done.  Flavor was fine, might need slightly more sugar in the batter. Tip - use fresh blueberries and coat in flour before adding to batter.

Really good texture. Very light tasting, so if you've got a sweet tooth you'll need a sugary topping. Instead of blueberries I used fresh (poked)cranberries.

Definitely a very tender and fluffy pancake but very bland in flavour. I used fresh blueberries and they held up pretty good but perhaps more sugar in the batter?
I also had to add about 1/4 more milk as the batter had the consistency of a soft dough.

Very easy to make with good flavour. I took the advice of another reviewer and sifted the flour and the texture was perfect; fluffy with a good bit of springiness. I cooked in 1/2 cup portions (I like big pancakes and the 1/4 cup would have been too small for me) over medium heat in a non-stick pan and they came out perfectly browned and cooked within a few minutes.

The flavor was a but plain which is my only issue. Not bad but it was missing something.  Next time I will add a bit more sugar and/or some vanilla and see if that helps.

Added a 1tblsp butter and 1tsp vanilla essence, and 1 tsp baking powder also used 2 tsps of sugar in the batter. By doing so the flavour of the pancake was nice just on its own. However I also made a blueberry and strawberry compote on the side rather than add blueberries into the mix and that complemented the pancakes nicely. 

I was in a bit of a hurry so didn't wait a whole hour , I made the batter first, then the compote, then went straight on and started cooking the pancakes- I found the pancake batter still turned out well, moist on the inside, just the right amount of fluffy for me, and crisp on the outside -  I used a little butter in the pan rather than oil to fry.

They are good made as directed.  However, I found them to be much better if I used fresh blueberries that were not mixed with the batter but rather placed uniformly on top of the pancakes when first poured on the griddle.

I used fresh blueberries and was careful not to over mix, which is the key to a good pancake.  I found them to be tasty but the next time I will add a bit more sugar.  Easy recipe and sure beats a mix

I would not call these pancakes, more like pan fried blueberry biscuits. They taste like biscuits, because there is so little sugar and the baking powder flavor is prominent. 

I followed the recipe exactly as listed, even waited an hour. The batter was so thick, the first pancake I tried to make with it was 3 inches thick! I added a little more milk, it was still really thick, but more manageable. 

Looking at them as buscuits they're a 4, with a little butter and maybe some jam, they're pretty good. 

As a pancake recipe, 1, maybe 2 stars.

Added fresh blueberries to top of pancakes as they started to cook.  Batter was too thick - perhaps a result of not following recipe preparation exactly.

Yum, Very easy to make. My friend made this and I took down the recipe. He adds more milk to make the mix not as thick. We like thinner pancakes as well so made it with more milk. It came out great. We do the fresh berries on the side as a compote!

Just found this recipe a few weeks ago.  Have made it twice now and it's the best pancake recipe I've made, with the following contingencies:  It is important to the fluffiness of the pancakes to let the batter sit at least 30 min. (this is not as cumbersome as you might think; I make the batter, cover it, then go about prepping everything else and voila, at least 30 minutes have passed!); and fresh blueberries are a must because when stirred in gently they maintain their integrity and you don't end up with blue or green batter from soggy previously frozen berries.
Yum!!

This has been my go-to pancake recipe since I found it in my AR magazine in the last year or two. Believe me...Ive tried TONS of pancake recipes and found some very good ones, but this is the best! Its something about the texture that I love! I made it the first time as is...fabulous. Then I tweeked it a bit, as I went for slightly more healthy, by subbing wheat flour for a bit of the white (use more white, though), and using truvia blend instead of regular white sugar. Its still a great recipe! Thanks, Todd!!

Excellent recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed them 

Changes: we used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. It came out so delicious! A lot lighter than usual heavy pancakes and we also flattened them out a bit to make them thinner as well because its easier to eat. 

First time using blueberries in pancakes and its  super goood

I've been using this recipe for a guide for a few years now.  I never did let it sit for an hour tho. (Who had that kind of time??).  So tonight I was pressed for time and I still used the recipe for a guide but this time I threw everything in one bowl, used a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter, and added 1/8-1/4 tsp of baking soda.  I also three in some chocolate chips.  I cooked them on an ungreased griddle on 350 for 5-7 minutes per side and oh my gosh I made THE BEST pancakes I have ever made and I have been making pancakes homemade for over 10 years.  They were so fluffy and perfectly browned. I'll forever make them this way.

These were delicious! They were fluffy and tender. Tip: when mixing the wet ingredients into the dry, don't over mix, it may make the batter runny. Just mix until it until it is just combined.

eh.  made these the other night and maybe it was me, but the batter was way too thick.  they barely spread in the pan, so they were like heavy, 1/2 inch pancakes (not in a good way)  they were not very sweet either, and I don't like sweet things.  oh well, on to the next recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Served with maple syrup, to which I added freshly squished and strained blueberries; also served with patty sausage and and a simple melon and strawberry compote for a wonderfully warm and satisfying tail-end-of-winter supper ... this one is definitely going into my "favorites!"

Love this recipe and I agree with Kimbica, there is no need to wait in fact the second time I made them I did and liked them better the first time. Used fresh blueberries twice and you can add them to the batter or place them on the pancake as it cooks. I'll definitely make these again!

These are fantastic! I used fresh blueberries and I sprinkled them on top of the pancakes in the pan, instead of folding them into the batter...it helps keep them whole and OMG IT IS SO GOOD!! I'd like to note that is not necessary to set the batter for an hour, I used the batter immediately after I prepared it, and they turned out perfect. These pancakes are the fluffiest, most flavorful blueberry pancakes I've ever made. Definitely gonna be a staple in my cookbook.

Super fluffy and airy, but difficult to get to cook through without burning the outside.  Delicious, though.

This is my go to pancake recipe. I've made them with blueberries, chocolate chips, raspberries, strawberries, plain. They're always amazing. I do add more sugar because I prefer sweeter pancakes, but this recipe is delicious any way you make it.

This is an okay recipe but was far too thick. I had to add about 3/4 cup more milk.

worst pancake recipe yet! Absolutely no flavor. I followed the recipe without any changes. Cooked two, tasted: tasted like flour and milk mixed together, kind of like the paste we used to make as kids with flour and water. Then added vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts, a little more tolerable. Who are these people who like flavorless fluffy pancakes? Not me!

I really don't have time to do this but having just served these for breakfast I simply HAVE to weigh in on the matter of letting the batter rest for an hour.

As it happens, I had other things to do and could afford to let it sit and I know enough about cooking to PROMISE YOU ALL that while the pancakes might taste OK if you make them immediately, the act of allowing that baking powder to truly do its thing, is SO WORTH IT.  I'm here to tell you there is NO WAY those pancakes would have risen to almost a half inch as they did this morning if I had not let the batter sit.....and that rising results in a lighter and WAY FLUFFIER pancake, so I would never make these without letting it sit.  They were AMAZING, and I have NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE!!!!

These are fluffy and thick pancakes. I used frozen blueberries, didn't thaw them. Instead, before I started I poured a good handful into a bow and set them on the counter. While I mixed everything out, the blueberries semi thawed. I waited 30 mins instead of 1 hr. Key note: remember to use a spatula to spread the batter thin once batter it's in the pan to ensure it cooks through properly.

We loved these.  Made with fresh berries and followed the recipe as written, except I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I've seen a few negative reviews stating these cakes were rubbery.  Couple things to eliminate that: Make sure your baking powder is fresh, wait the hour as suggested for the baking powder to have its chemical reaction in the batter, make sure you turn them when there are bubbles in the middle.  I usually make my pancakes on medium high heat.

Easy recipe, but they were tough and not fluffy. They tasted a bit boring. I'll be going back to banana-blueberry pancakes.

Use fresh blueberries, they don't break up and taint the whole mixture as easily, and when they get fried by the pan they're delicious. Also sometimes I add more blueberries than it calls for, just cause blueberries rock. And absolutely set the mixture aside for an hour, it takes that long for the baking powder to react and fluff up the pancakes, if you don't wait you'll have dense, flat pancakes.

These are delicious.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla to add a little more flavor.  I didn't read the directions, bad habit of mine, so I missed the part about letting the batter sit for an hour.  I just caught it when I went to rate the recipe and read about someone was OK to wait an hour!  I'll try that next time!  They turned out pretty good to me!!!

Very good recipe, I will definitely make it again. I used 1 cup of blueberries and probably could use more than that, as my husband is crazy for blueberries. I didn't put the batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour, but used it as soon as it was mixed.

I made these for breakfast one time when my step son had spent the night. At 10 years old, he is a light eater. He devoured these and went back for seconds! Not gonna lie, so did we. I followed the recipe precisely using berries I picked and immediately froze the summer before (I cleaned up and cooked some bacon while waiting the hour for the batter to be ready). The berries might as well have been fresh as they were still perfectly plump and juicy. These were some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten. I will definitely make them again!

It's a great recipe but I definitely made a couple of changes. 

Firstly, if you're going to set this aside for an hour, you need to know why... because stirring it after it sits kills the whole purpose of having it sit aside which is why people are not noticing a difference at all! Cooking is all about chemistry and I'm still learning it myself but when you set aside this type of batter, I do believe it's so that you can get a reaction between the acids and the sodas and all the ingredients you've mixed together cause this magical reaction that makes the batter create bubbles of air within it.. making it rise a bit and become fluffier! It's supposed to make your pancakes slightly fluffier! BUT! if you stir it after it sits, you POP all those pockets of air and your little "souffle" of batter deflates back to where it was before you set it aside.

So, DON'T STIR AFTER IT SITS! Just gently scoop up each spoonful for a pancake and otherwise, stay out of the bowl. =)

For other changes, I always like to add a little vanilla to my pancakes (a personal preference since I make my own extract). I also tend to always add about 3 TBsp sugar total and a mixture of white and brown is nice but pure white I think is best chemically. It works with the other ingredients and give the best flavor and texture. I ALWAYS use buttermilk as its light acidity has a nice chemical reaction with the baking soda and powder and the sweetness of it adds something special to a pancake that makes it good e

I had to add more sugar, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and some cinnamon to make them have any flavor.  Then because of having to add so much to it  I had over stirred the batter so they were to thin. I added some more flour and a little more baking  powder. End result was good but way to much trouble.

Delicious tender pancakes! I particularly like the reduced sugar. You can always add more sugar if you aren't going to use any syrup. You can also replace the blueberries with bananas, chocolate chip cookies, etc. Will definitely stick to this recipe from now on!

I was surprised these pancakes weren't better with all the rave reviews. They were fine, just nothing spectacular. Other than the blueberries themselves, the actual pancake was pretty blah. They were fluffy and the texture was great, but we won't be making them again.

The texture of these pancakes is heavenly. I would add just a bit more sugar next time. I also had a overripe banana, so I added it and it was so good. I used pint of fresh blueberries. 
 A touch of cinnamon and nutmeg also gave them a little kick.

This is a great recipe if you're into a pancake that places the blueberry at the forefront without being overly sweet. It pays off in spades if you use quality berries, whole milk, and real maple syrup. If you don't care for syrup, it might not have enough flavour for you.

If I could, I would definitely give this recipe a 0. It required much more ingredients and when it was made, it burnt too easily and the blueberry made it a disgusting brownish green colour. The pancake itself tasted horrendous. It was too salty even though I added the right amount. The hour wait didn't even make a difference. It was such a waste of time and money when we had to throw it out in the trash.

I've just found my new go-to pancake recipe!  Made it just as recipe states, except I sprinkled the blueberries on the pancakes instead of folding them into the batter (to not crush them). I also just sprayed the pan instead of using butter.  I made the batter first & let it sit while I made the fresh blueberry compote & fried the bacon.  This is so good!

just has these for breakfast! really very yummy... I felt like I could taste the baking powder but that could be because I kept the batter overnight? the husband and 3 year old thoroughly enjoyed though... will definitely make again. thank you

I usually use a buttermilk mix to make pancakes but I now see I don't have to if it's a matter of convenience because making them from scratch was pretty easy. This came out pretty good so sure, I would make them again. I followed the directions exactly except I added a bit more blueberries. I was afraid 1/2 cup wasn't enough but actually it would have been so I didn't need to do that.

Made these with fresh blueberries instead of frozen and the cakes came out soooooo delicious and soft. This is my new favorite food. Honestly. I could eat them every day.

I made this recipe as written,  just added some extra blueberries (fresh, since we had just picked them!) and actually let it sit for about 30 minutes instead of the hour stated here.  They were amazing!!!!!  I've tried many different recipes, and though I was skeptical at first, this is going to be my new go to pancake recipe.

They were delicious and fluffy! I didnt let the batter sit for an hour coz my lil one was so hungryy already. I guess it would have more flavor infused if it was left for an hour.

I have made these pancakes many times.  I increase the milk to about 1.33 cups which results in slightly less fluffy pancakes.  I increase the blueberries as well and always use fresh blueberries.

Wow, these were fantastic!! I used frozen mixed berries, and had to thin the batter with a little bit of the berry juice as the consistency was a little too stiff. (I used a mixed whole grain flour, so that may be why it got thicker.) Terrific texture and flavor! I didn't even let it sit for the hour, either. I will be making these again SOON!!!

Great recipe. I used fresh blueberries. Be sure to let the batter rest for the 1 hour.  I'm going to try making the batter the night before next time.

Super easy recipe with a delicious result. 
Instead of butter and sugar, I had them with maple syrup and it was amazing. 

Probably the best pancakes I ever had,  will definitely make them again.

These were delicious and fluffy.  I didn't wait an hour because I didn't have that much time and they still turned out fine.  I think they would be great with vanilla extract or lemon extract added.

I made these pancakes for my boyfriend once and since then, I've been making them almost every Sunday for the past 2 years (and I suspect he may include a clause about them in our wedding vows).  They're best with blueberries, but other fruits can work as well.  Chopped up strawberries are another favorite of mine (with extra thrown on top at the end).

Cinnamon and brown sugar make all the difference! I thought the the recipe was spot on, but it needed something extra. I added 1/2 tablespoon of dark brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinammon to the orignal recipe. I also used fresh blueberries. I would recommend this recipe.

Holy pancakes!!  I have made these more times than I can count. I vary them up from time to time but only in the fruit I add. I almost always add half the volume of milk with buttermilk to make a more tender pancake. You may think 1tbs Of baking powder is too much, but trust me it's not. Enjoy!!

I have made this dozens of times and always double the recipie and freeze what I don't eat for a quick breakfast in the future. I add 1/2 mashed or pur√©ed banana in place of each egg, which gives it a different and delicious flavor. I also have only tried this with frozen blueberries. I add the blueberry juice as well and just add less milk. The juice tinges the pancakes a neat, faint blue color. Delectable!

This recipe did not work well. I tried fresh blueberries, the 1st set on the griddle came out w/ blueberry masses. I went back to the batter and smashed the berries up. Both times the pancake is a floppy thin mess. So, I ended up adding a bit of  a commercial pancake mix. They looked like regular pancakes, but no flavor. Even the fresh blueberries did not redeem these pancakes.

I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and  used unsalted butter.
I would add more sugar and less salt next time just for my personal preference.
I used fresh blueberries.
My son said they were the best pancakes I had ever made!
So fluffy!

I make these about every weekend. My son loves them! Sometimes I use different fruits or none at all. Today we made blueberry with an orange maple syrup :)

The pancakes were good, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  I did learn that if I flattened the pancakes, so the berries burst open while on the griddle it helped to add flavor.

I used fresh blueberries and added them to each pancake after pouring the batter. I also added about 3/4 tsp of ground cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. They were a big hit in my house and made about 12-14 pancakes. If you have a larger family you may want to double the recipe.

I don't understand why these pancakes have rave reviews, they're very bland. I made two ways, as stated and separately with whole wheat flour and vanilla almond milk. Both were equally bland. Good thing we had some delicious Vermont Maple syrup and butter to dress them up! I won't make again.

This was my first time making pancakes - prep and cooking were super easy! I used fresh blueberries because I had them to use up (and everyone suggests it anyway), but otherwise followed the directions exactly. These are great because they're not too sweet - so with some syrup or the brown sugar/butter topping you're not in sweetness overkill. Perfectly fluffy and filling.

So yummy! Make sure to rinse the frozen blueberries before adding them to the batter so they won't turn it blue. I didn't wait an hour (only ~30) as I got impatient, and they were still super fluffy.

Very very good, it's true that needs a bit more flavor, but additional salt to the batter and the usual toppings of your preference will make them awesome! 
My toppings: jam, bacon and honey, yummy!

I have made these twice and they have been fantastic both times. The pancakes come out light and fluffy not heavy and dry.  The recipe is more flexible than you might think.. today I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 3 small eggs instead of 2 and they were super. I use frozen blueberries that I put onto the pancakes when they are in the frying pan rather than thawing them and mixing them in. I fried them today in a mixture of bacon fat from the bacon I was making and butter so they got that yummy edge.

I did not thaw the blueberries, nor did I wait an hour. Just folded in the frozen blueberries and put them on the griddle right away. They were amazing. My family ate them up fast! This was the first time we have not had leftovers after making a batch of pancakes. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes myself but I made these two weekends in a row.

This has been my go-to pancake recipe for years, it is amazingly good, and better than any box mix. I am very sensitive to milk, so I have even made it on many occasions with water instead of milk, and it is just as good.  I also prefer them plain, rater than with blueberries. Thanks to whomever Todd is; YUM!!!

Better than IHOP! These are fluffy, tender, delicious pancakes. They taste great with or without syrup. I did add a tbs of sugar and extra blueberries to the pancakes while on the griddle, but you don't really need to. The bed part is you do not have to wait an hour to make it! Play around with different flavors too. The base of the pancakes works with other berries as well. This is a forever recipe in my book. Thanks.

Of all the recipes I've tried, these are the simplest & best tasting. I did not have an hour to wait, but 20 minutes of rest seemed to change the consistency enough to make a delicious pancake.

I really liked them even plain.  We used a cast iron skillet and half a ladle at a time. This made a medium cake that is easy to flip  In between cakes we sprayed non stick spray.  Cooked on lo on a gas stove

We had about 12 medium cakes

We fixed them all and will freeze the leftovers between wax paper in a plastic bag

I would feel better using honey or brown sugar but his is great the way it is written!

I'll never have to look for a blueberry pancake recipe again. These were light fluffy and delicious. I did let the mix rest for about an hour but I'm not sure if it made a difference but I do know that we will be having them again.

Yes, as a matter of fact I did make a change.  Well not a change actually,I mashed a very ripe banana, and folded it in with the blueberrys.  So we had blueberry banana pancakes. Other  than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  MY MOTHER THOUGHT SHE HAD DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN. Those cakes were very ,very good. There is no doubt that I will make this again and again especially when we have company. Then I can except the complements gracefully  he he

These were delicious, light and fluffy.  I put a few blueberries on top too right after pouring batter in the pan just so they'd be more evenly distributed.

Light and fluffy consistency, but the flavour was strong of baking powder. 

I added 2 tsp of almond extract to counteract the flavour, worked like a charm :)

Great recipe. You can substitute oil for butter, they are great both ways! Also good without blueberries. I've used frozen and fresh, depending on what I have on hand. Also, no need to wait an hour, 15 min is good too.

Kids loved it and they came out exactly like the photo!!  The tip of leaving it in the refrigerator for one hour definitely helped thicken the batter to create a fluffier pancake. So easy to make and so good!

These were delicious! I substituted agave nectar for the white sugar and added about a tsp of lemon zest and a 1 1/2 tsp of dried lavender. The recipe yielded six pancakes all of which were devoured!

Me, being the forgetful being I am, decided to make these pancakes without checking that I actually HAD blueberries. And, as luck would have it, I didn't. 

So instead I added some cinnamon and grated nutmeg, and all was well. The pancakes are light and fluffy, perfect!

These pancakes are great, fast to put together and quickly to cook. I don't wait the 1 hr and they still taste great! I use fresh blueberries and they explode with juices when you take a bite. Really good pancakes!

The Blueberry Pancakes came out very good. Next time, though, I might try just a pinch of cinnamon in the batter to complement the blueberries.

I was skeptical at first by the portion of ingredients in the recipe but after tasting these pancakes...I was amazed! This is my new favorite go-to pancake recipe from now on. I suggest you print this off your your families. 
Only suggest little less baking powder(opinion) and fresh blueberries are a must! Good Job Chef Todd!
- photos next time.

Excellent recipe. Very light and fluffy. You don't HAVE to wait the hour but they are evn better if you can. My only criticism is that against my better judgement I followed the recipe and thawed the frozen berries. Do NOT do that. They still taste delicious but as expected the batter turned blue. Yummy!

The consistency of the batter had me worried at first, but these pancakes are truly great. Not too salty, not too sweet, and not too cakey. Just right. I used fresh blueberries, and that was fine. Also, out of necessity (i.e. a 2 year old waiting to eat), I did not wait the hour and they were still fantastic. Only problem? There aren't any leftovers! :)

Terrific ... just discovered this recipe and made them for supper to please my little big guy and there was no end of him licking his chops.  I had only frozen Maine blue berries but I think fresh would surely be best.  Fact is, tho, I made a coupe without the berries and it was just as good.  Tear up all other recipes and get on you knee to propose to Todd.  I suspect thi is just one of his fabulous recipes.  I also liked them with brown butter and sugar.  They'd be good completely undressed methinks.

Excellent recipe! Hardest part was to wait at least 45 minutes as the recipe says. I knew I would be eating a lot of these because of the prior reviews, so I doubled the recipe the first time. The pancakes were fluffy, tender, and extremely flavorful. I will be using this recipe again without any changes!

I've made these twice so far and they are the best homemade pancakes I've ever attempted to make.  I love how they do not taste like cake batter and are not sweet.  I used fresh blueberries that I had frozen myself and I didn't wait an hour for the batter to sit.  Who has time for that!  I let it sit just about five to ten mins like you would any other pancake batter and they came out beautiful.  This recipe is in my collection now and will always use this when making pancakes.

Absolutely delicious! I'm not normally a pancake girl but these were fantastic! I made the batter exactly as written and then put the FRESH berries in the pancakes on the griddle. They turned out a beautiful golden brown, and so fluffy! The brown sugar and butter is the perfect topping, no syrup needed. I'm NEVER using Bisquick again!

These pancakes were delicious! I put regular syrup on them, and I wish I hadn't. They are good enough to eat without syrup. My daughter ate them without the syrup and she loved them! I did butter them when they were done and I would highly suggest that. One thing, some of the pancakes did not cook all the way through for some reason. I had my griddle set on 350 degrees, and maybe that was to high. The next time I make these I will definitely cook them on a lower temperature, like 300 or 325. Will make again!!!

My husband made these one morning and our 2 year old went crazy. He loved them. Now I always have to make these because my son doesn't want mommy's pancakes...only daddy's. Lol. They were so light and fluffy. We even substituted blueberries for chocolate chips one time and they worked great. We've also had them plain and they are good. Always turns out great whenever we make them.

Whoops! I didn't let it sit for an hour. I pretty much just started cooking as soon as the blueberries were folded in. THE BEST PANCAKES EVER! We used double the butter, and 3 tsp of sugar, and the blueberries were freshly picked a few days earlier. I'm not sure how the texture was supposed to be after sitting for an hour, but they were fantastic made right away. This is my new go-to recipe for pancakes. I'm going to experiment with using some almond flour at some point.

We LOVE this recipe. I always add 1/4C of sugar and 1/2T of vanilla to my mix, and I do suggest waiting the full hour or refrigerating overnight. It's great with the blueberries, but when I'm out of them we love them just as much with an extra splash of vanilla. They always turn out super thick and moist. My husband who only love waffles will practically beg for these!

pretty good. I have never been a fan of blueberry pancakes, but my son wanted them..and he absolutely loved them. I ate a few that didn't have any berries, and i really liked the pancake batter itself. I let it rest for only about 10 minutes, but not for the purpose of resting.

I followed to recipe (except I used fresh blueberries and more of them) and they really lack flavor.  I don't normally like to eat syrup on pancakes, but without syrup these were really bland.

This recipe made a much denser pancake than I prefer. I think it's the additional 1/4 cup of flour. Without that and a dash of vanilla, I think this would be a much better recipe. Also subbing buttermilk (plus 1/2 baking soda) would take this over the top. Won't make this as written again.

I made this recipe for Father's day breakfast and they were a hit. Light, fluffy and very tasty. I did add a bit more melted butter as I did not truly measure. We really love blueberries so I also added a few extra on the top of the batter in the pan. I do plan on making this my go to recipe in the future. 
By the way that hour waiting for the batter to create the awesome height allowed us to relax in the early Tennessee morning sun and have an extra cup of coffee. Well worth the wait!

Pancakes were flavorless and very dull in taste. In my opinion they are definitely not worth the time or CARBS! Will be sticking 2 the box from now on.

Had to make some substitutions:
1 Tbsp baking powder = 2 tsp cream of tartar + 1 tsp baking soda; 
1 egg = 1 Tbsp ground flax seed + 3 Tbsp water; 
1 c. milk = 1/2 c. oat "milk" beverage + 1/2 c. coconut milk beverage; 
1/2 Tbsp. butter = 1/2 Tbsp. canola oil.

I also increased the amount of sugar and frozen blueberries.  At first I thought the batter was too stiff, but as the blueberries thawed in the batter, it thinned to the perfect consistency.

Not sure if I waited the full hour, but the texture was absolutely perfect!  Put this one in the recipe box for next time!

I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used half 'n' half for the milk and 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  The batter only rested for 10-15 minutes before cooking.  They turned out GREAT!  Light yet substantial.  The berries added a mild sweetness and juicy bursts.  I used a 1/3-cup measure and got 10 pancakes.  Cooked at 300 degrees.

Next time, I may let the batter rest longer as it may produce a slightly chewier pancake.  I will also experiment with subtle flavor enhancements like vanilla, orange or lemon zest, cinnamon, ginger, etc. (one at a time, not all together!)

These are amazing!! It's the first time I've made homemade pancakes from scratch. Never again will I buy mix!! I used fresh blueberries and a little more than half cup. I also added a few sliced bananas on top before I flipped...they went very well with it all.

This is my go-to pancake recipe.  Just to make my life easier I omit the butter and I don't sift the flour, etc.  After the batter sits for a while there's really no difference.  I prefer to let the batter sit on the counter unless it's really hot.  If it's too hot to do that I let it sit out for 10-15 after taking it out from the refrigerator.  I also double the fruit (I've used blueberries, bananas and strawberries so far).  Today I had some thawed frozen fruit in the fridge, so I drained the juice and heated it up with some syrup.  It made these awesome pancakes even better!  I always make a double batch, too, because they're really good reheated.

I enjoyed the pancake. I would call this a hearty pancake. It does puff up very high in the pan. I thought the batter was too thick so I added a little more milk so that it would be pourable. Using a 1/4 cup measure produces a pancake with a 5 inch diameter. The flavor is good. I used fresh blueberries because that's what I had at home. I just sprinkled a few onto each pancake as they cooked. I would make this recipe again.  It's certainly way better than any packaged mixes. And of course, you won't miss the chemicals and preservatives. Fresh and homemade is always best.

I've made it a few times for myself, and I really like it! Tonight I'm making some for my husband and i. I've decided to add a little more sugar, and a small pour of vanilla to make them sweeter. Can't wait to see how they taste ;)

The pancakes are very good, light and moist.  However, they need a little more flavor or sweetness.  I will make these again, trying different fruits.

I typically struggle making even decent pancakes. These were amazing! I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen, personal preference, and I also added a little extra baking powder to make them puff up. The extra was not needed, these were both hearty and fluffy. Totally worth the hour wait! I only got 6 pancakes instead of the 12 the recipe says, so next time I will double it. I'm sad that the leftovers are gone! Thanks for the wonderful recipe! 
I also melted some butter and added brown sugar to make a simple syrup. This is a must try, it goes so well with the blueberries, no more bottle syrup for me!

Although I didn't have blueberries, I did make this as directed and they turned out to be the fluffiest pancakes I've ever made.  I would suggest upping the sugar or even subbing some honey in and possibly some flavoring.  You wouldn't even need or want to use maple syrup!!!

Pillowy and tender. Even without the blueberries. I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, instead of just using regular flour. I also added a tablespoon of wheat germ. I added a few more splashes of milk to the batter. I served them with strawberries and whipped cream.  Great recipe!

Truly the best pancakes ever!  I followed the recipe exactly except for only letting the batter sit for 1/2 hour, and adding vanilla to the wet ingredients.  This will be my go to pancake recipe!  Thank you.

After I tried many pancake recipes, this one is my favorite.
Butter, sugar, baking powder are as less as it can be,
but the pancakes are still as fluffy as possible.
The secret is clearly in the direction: set aside for one hour.
The sour taste of blueberries and the sweet taste of syrup are perfectly together!

This is my first time making pancakes from scratch. This recipe was very easy to follow and I think it's a great base. I was unable to leave the batter to sit for a full hour, but they still turned out good. I would cut down on the salt and increase the sugar, I think, for a sweeter result. Also, fresh blueberries should be used if possible.

Best pancake recipe ever! Perfection of thickness, fluffiness and taste. The batter might seem too thick, but these won't be doughy or undercooked at all. You don't need to wait the hour - just mix, pour and eat. I used non-bleached all-purpose flour and 1% milk.

I have tried COUNTLESS blueberry pancake recipes and this is hands down the BEST! The pancakes come out fluffy and perfect. The berries do not burn or stick to the pan and the mix is light and tasty. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will never try another pancake recipe again!

I did the pancakes gluten free and they were excellent!
My flour was a mix of four grains. They must be eaten with maple syrup, nothing else goes!

As far as pancakes go, you can't get much better than these. As an avid breakfast food lover, I will happily give these pancakes 5 stars. It is so delicious! I made them as the recipe says and didn't have any problems. I only waited for about 20 minutes rather than the suggested hour. Mine turned out great and fluffy. I added extra blueberries and some powdered sugar on top. Amazing!

This is a perfect recipe. I made the batter the night before cooking, so it had about 8 hours to rise and thicken. They tasted like buttermilk pancakes without the expense of purchasing buttermilk!

These are tasty! I had blueberry pancakes at a dive in Minneapolis and decided to make some at home. I waited the hour or you can make them the night before. I used fresh blueberries and topped the pancakes with them while cooking.

Just finished the last bite!  Truly an A+++ recipe.  I did not (or could not!) wait the one hour and I also used fresh berries.  Very tasty treat for a late morning brunch.  Easy to make, fast and yummy.  I would recommend this recipe to all!

Very good recipe.  I did add one teaspoon of vanilla (a must for me)and I used fresh blueberries.  Recipe doubles well.
I don't understand some of the negative reviews, but think these might be "user error"?  One review mentions all the baking soda making the pancakes taste metallic.... but the recipe doesn't call for baking soda, it calls for baking powder.  The other complaint is the batter is very thick; however, a thick batter is needed in order to suspend the berries in the batter.  If the batter were thinner, all the berries would sink to the bottom. These pancakes are not very sweet, so if you prefer sweet pancakes, then add more sugar.  I think this recipe is a great base for people to tweak based on their own personal tastes.  In addition to adding vanilla, next time I will try a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.

These were very good: light, not too sweet, and easy!  I only got six 4-5in. pancakes out of the batch.  The batter is quite thick, and needed to cook over med-low heat to cook through.  I used almond milk, and threw in a few extra berries, just because :)  

Will use this recipe as a base for future pancake adventures!

These pancakes were the best and fluffiest I ever had. My whole family goes crazy over these. I must say that this is one of the best pancake recipes. Only I added a little baking soda and that gave the pancakes more puff.

Oh wow!!!! My family loved these pancakes and I've tried many recipes, but this one is the BEST!  My 2 yr. old never eats her pancakes, but she had two servings when I made these. Thank you for sharing. Note:  I did not put blueberries in them because I made a blueberry fruit syrup to use on top instead of regular syrup and the combo. was a huge hit.

We love this recipe.  The pancakes look thick but they are the lightest pancakes, and taste and texture are wonderful.  I've made these a few times and it is consistently good.  It is well worth the wait.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I've passed it on to several friends and family who are equally pleased.

I hate pancakes! I LOVE THESE PANCAKES!!!! They are the most AMAZING pancakes EVER!!!! I make them without Blueberries and they are still amazing! I only use half or less of the salt  because I use salted butter and I don't like overly salted food. I have made this recipe a ton because my kids love how they don't fall apart. Wait or don't wait?? I wait. I have made them both ways and they are awesome, however if you wait the hour the batter is really thick and sturdy so you can put more on the griddle and they won't run together. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.

I followed the recipe other than using fresh rather than frozen blueberries, and the pancakes were very good.

Use fresh berries! This recipe was great! I added lemon juice to the batter also.  I could not taste the lemon.  I think  adding on a little lemon on top would zest it, if you are looking for a citrus taste.

This recipe was just okay. The pancakes did come out beautiful and fluffy, but my fiance and I thought the batter was pretty bland tasting and I had even added a touch of vanilla to it. just reading other reviews, i saw someone say they think it should be more than 1/2 tbs of melted butter added, maybe even 1/2 a cup. Maybe that was the issue and I think it may need at least a tablespoon of sugar. MIGHT try this again.

I believe there is a mistake in this recipe, it should be 1/2 CUP Melted Butter, not 1/2 tablespoon. If you add the 1/2 cup butter, the batter will no longer be too thick and dense, and you will get the full 12 light and fluffy pancakes. They are delicious - and one added suggestion would be to sprinkle the blueberries with a little flour before folding them into the batter...that way your batter will not turn colors and the blueberries will stay together better. Overall an excellent recipe for blueberry pancakes!

I've been making these since I was a kid, only without the blueberries. Try throwing in a teaspoon or so of vanilla into the batch.

Great easy recipe. I used almond milk instead of regular milk. Added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 cup of white granulated sugar, 1/4 of brown sugar, zest of 1/2 a lemon, and 1 tsp of cinnamon! Made it this morning for my boyfriend for Valentines day and he loved it! Didn't need any syrup at all.

This is an AMAZING recipe. My 5 year old son and I like to try new things, especially ones he can help with. We used wheat flour and egg whites in this and added just a touch of vanilla and it was great! We also used a little bit of light syrup on top and he loved them! Thanks!

My husband and I made these for dinner tonight...WOW!! We did follow one user's suggestion of adding the berries after pouring the batter on the griddle. My hubby also got creative, and instead of blueberries on a couple of the pancakes, he added Reese's Pieces...to DIE for!! I will definitely be making these again and again.

The texture for me was a bit dense, which I didn't mind too much. But they didn't have much flavor. I think they could have used a bit more sugar...maybe some vanilla. I used a lot of syrup when eating them because they were just bland. I used fresh bluberries that had been frozen for a few days. I coated them with sugar and flour to help prevent turning my batter blue. The search for good homemade blueberry pancakes goes on....

These were delicious! I used frozen blueberries and drained the water and didnt have a problem with the batter becoming black. I also didnt wait an hour, made the batter and waited maybe 15 mins. Very, very delicious pancakes!

Moms boyfriend loves blueberry pancakes and he LOVED these. I made the recipe as stated and he ate THE WHOLE BATCH OF PANCAKES! I didnt get to try any...neither did anyone else, so I dont really know from experience how they came out...but from his reaction...i think they may have been pretty good lol.

SO GOOD. I doubled the amount of blueberries, though. Also, be sure to add a pinch of salt, it makes a huge difference. This recipe is also great with wild Maine blueberries.

I did not care for this recipe. I like pancakes to be thin, delicate and crepe-like.  

I was able to "fix" the recipe somewhat by thinning with milk until the batter was thick but "pourable", adding a little extra sugar to taste, and throwing in a tablespoon of greek yogurt for the "tang".  

With these additions, the pancakes were edible, but still somewhat gummy though they looked "right" and were cooked the middle.

I was really surprised these turned out so badly. I followed the recipe exactly to a T. They looked nothing like the photos, and they were very dense and not fluffy. I was going over every step, and the recipe is quite simple, so I'm sure I followed it exactly. I even sifted the flour, which I am often too lazy to do when I make my own pancakes, which usually still turn out great.

Well, when I first made it was a bad one but I tried adding more sugar ( teaspooon instead ), I a little bit more milk, vanilla and lemon zest.
I use frag blueberry too
Now it's awesome. Super fluffy and way way better. I also agree that using vegetable oil is better and less work!
Life is good

Really good Recipe for Blueberry Pancakes. I followed the directions almost to a T. Except I used fresh berries and added twice the sugar. They were AWESOME and my girls LOVED them. While I love to try and eat healthy(keep skinny..hah) Im a true Southern Lady..so I put a little butter on top and some good ol Butter Maple Syrup. I think I finished my Pancake (singular) in about 45 seconds. Thanks for this fast , easy , and amazing recipe!!

Perfect pancakes! I used fresh blueberries, and added them when I put the batter on the griddle. They were great!

Very yummy but I used fresh blueberries and didn't set aside for an hour.  Still delicious!

I thought these were okay. For some reason, I was thinking they would be more restaurant quality. I think, based on the picture. Some reviewers were saying the batter was plain, overall, so I just did a full Tblsp of sugar and added a splash of vanilla. I had no real problem with the taste, but I think I just prefer a more crisp pancake like Allrecipes Fluffy Pancake recipe. Also, for some reason, I couldn't get a nicely round pancake as other pancake recipes I have tried. They were a tad thick too from the amount of baking powder.

Wonderful! I made these for breakfast along with Scotch eggs and they were delicious! I also made a cherry blueberry syrup to use on the pancakes. In previous posts it was stated that you didnt have to let the batter sit for an hour. It doesnt really affect the taste of it. However, it may affect the texture of your pancakes. I would suggest letting it sit for the hour. They will be light and fluffy beyond belief!

I made these exactly according to the recipe, and the batter was way too thick! The first pancake was over an inch thick looked terrible. I added about 3/4 cups of extra water, and the resulting pancakes were delicious! Will make these again, with the added liquid.

I've been making these for 2 years now...and we ALL LOVE THEM! I follow the recipe just about exactly. I find the batter a bit thick for our taste, so I thin it out a bit with some extra milk...until it feels right. They are still fluffy and tender. Thanks Allison for sharing this recipe!

This was one of the worst pancakes I have ever had. I did sub whole wheat flour. So maybe  that changed it all so much that these were inedible.

These were the absolute best! I needed a comforting food and a suggestion from a previous commentor- put the blueberries on after you pour batter on the griddle was awesome. The blueberry pancakes cured the blues away! These went best with some ham fried on the griddle. We used a little blueberry juice from the can mixed in the syrup and wallah.. a cure for the Blues..mmmm Thanks, Alison!

Delicious and so easy to make :) They're so fluffy and pretty thick (in a good way)...do not wait an hour, totally unneccessary. I used 2 teaspoons of sugar...only because I thought it wouldn't be sweet enough, but with maple syrup I'm sure 1 1/4 is fine too.

These pancakes were delicious!! I made these last minute for dinner and did not have the time to wait an hour, they still came out great.  I did not have any milk, so I substituted 1 1/4 cups almond milk instead.  I also threw in some milled flax seed, cinnamon and vanilla.  YUMMY!  I will certainly make these again!

Everytime I flipped the pancakes the batter went everywhere regardless of how well cooked the one side was.  They didn't taste all that great either.

I thought they were great, dad did not like them. I asked for pancakes while visiting the parents and they were out of mix so we pulled up this recipe, added a tad of vanilla. Mom said she'd add more sugar next time too, but maybe b/c my dad accidentally added to much salt? I don't know how you can go wrong with these or why someone who likes pancakes wouldn't like them. I honestly think he was being difficult since they were out of his fave mix. Said these needed buttermilk but if they didn't have pancake mix they obviously didn't have buttermilk sitting around. I assume if you want that buttermilk taste you could sub the reg milk for buttermilk. I think these are great in a pinch, who needs mix if you can make it yourself?

Made this recipe for the first time this morning and it was AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe and it made 8 really large blueberry pancakes...16 small ones if you don't like plate sized ones.  I did add about a half cup of milk extra to the batter....it was way too thick without it, and I was really glad that I did.  The pancakes still came out a bit dense but that is what was soooo good about them..  We ate them with butter and maple and OH EM GEE they were tasty!  Can't wait to make them again :)

Great basic and easy recipe - thick and fluffy but a bit bland even though I had added twice as many blueberries as requested.   They were very good but just missing a little something.

These are fantastic pancakes - I've never had any leftover any time I've made them. I also don't usually let the batter sit, once it's mixed I go ahead and cook it and have never had any problems.

We had breakfast for dinner tonight. I made these for my daughter and they were the perfect blueberry pancakes!  If you like them thick just let the batter sit for 5 mins and they are super thick.  Great flavor too...thanks!

Light and lovely, quick and easy, will experiment with cinnamon or nutmeg, maybe add pecans next time. No need to wait 30 minutes, these cooked well right away.

I added a little more sugar, used about 1/4 cup and pancakes were perfect! I will never use the boxed kind again!

I didn't even notice the part about waiting an hour... and they still turned out very good.  I decreased the salt and baking powder a bit, but that's just a personal preference of mine.

These pancakes are the best that I have ever eaten.  I have to triple the recipe when I make them because everyone goes for thirds.  Even my picky two year old will eat four pancakes when I make these for breakfast!

Perfect cooking! I will add a little more sugar to taste! Need to make a double recipe to serve a family of 4. Update 4 years later: still love this recipe. I make a double batch for our family of 5. Also, I don't wait for it, just mix and cook!

Delicious pancakes! Easy to fix and a winner among my family of picky eaters!  The hour wait gives me time to clean up and set out plates and silverware for a wonderful buffet style breakfast :D

We LOVED these with the brown sugar and butter or just plain. We added just a little more sugar (I like my pancakes a little sweet) and used fresh blueberries. DEFINITELY will make again :D Thanks!

These are great! First time making homemade pancakes!   I also microwaved (just until warm) about a 1/4 cup of frozen blueberries and 1T of sugar, which created a sweat glaze for on top... it was delish!

Perfect. (I used closer to a cup of fresh blueberries, but that was my only tweak.) Mr. Storm adores this recipe, and declared these blueberry pancakes to be the best he'd ever had. I *love* finding a recipe that makes him say that! He's right -- they're tender, fluffy, and the blueberries just take them to another level. Thank you, Alison. :)

I made this both with & without the berries and it came out awesome. I used fresh blueberries and added sliced banana on a few too. On the batch without the fruit I added a splash of vanilla and doubled the butter. Spectacular! Even my husband who dislikes sweet breakfast foods couldn't help but dig in.

I know that these are 'just pancakes' BUT I joined allrecipes.com just so I could comment on them: They were fantastic!  I used fresh blueberries, and didnt wait the hour and they ended up looking just like the picture.  More than that, they were rich, fluffy, tender, but also with some bite and texture.    This is my new pancake recipe!

Amazing. I didn't change anything to this recipe except I squeezed about a tsp of fresh lemon juice into the batter. This made them extra fluffy and light.

These are very good pancakes. I loved the fluffy texture of these. My only complaint is that it needs a little extra sugar and some vanilla. I used fresh blueberries since they are so very cheap right now. I had to serve three very hungry boys something filling for breakfast and this was perfect. Thanks!

As long as I have an hour to wait for the batter, this will be my pancake recipe.  Husband and I thought this was excellent.  I made it just as written but prob added more blueberries  (I used fresh, not frozen) and I added a splash of vanilla.  Delicious!

These were great! Subbed oil for the butter and dropped the blueberries on after I put them on the griddle. Oh, and I didn't wait the hour. Definitely will be in our pancake rotation. Thanks

This is a wonderful recipe!  I, too, used vanilla.  It still needed  sugar, so I topped it with whipped cream and extra blueberries.

WOW! These are wonderful. By far the best pancakes I've ever made - and so simple! I did let my batter sit for an hour just because I had the time to do it, but I'm curious to try it without the waiting time.Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Made these this morning for my hubby. He kept telling me how good these were! I didn't realize until I had already started mixing, that the instructions were to wait 1 hr. I didn't have an hour to wait, so I went ahead and made them. I used fresh blueberries(I mixed in with the dry flour mixture). I topped pancakes with blueberry pie filling and whipped cream...yum! Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!****Made these again. This time I added milk chocolate chips to the mix...my husband said they were over the top!!

One word -- AWESOME!  We went to a bed & breakfast recently and thought their blueberry pancakes were outstanding, which is what prompted my search on Allrecipes.  Tried Todd's based on the positive reviews.  Absolutely awesome -- better than the pancakes at the B&B!  Didn't change a thing...

The pancakes turned out light and fluffy, although not really tasty.  I used fresh blueberries and probably about a cup of them.  Probably should have added more sugar.  I also didn't wait the hour, so perhaps they would have been a 5 star if I had actually stayed true to the directions.

Good texture, but very bland.  The family did not care for them.  I think adding more sugar and vanilla would make a big improvement.  Also, if you don't have buttermilk and want to replace buttermilk for the milk, you can add a splash of white vinegar for the same result.  I did not do this because I always follow the recipe as written first.  I think that would be an improvement, too, however.

We just had these pancakes for Saturday morning breakfast and they were perfect!  I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen. My husband said they were better than IHOP!  We finished off the whole batch ourselves, so if you have more than two people, you may want to double the recipe. It certainly wouldn't feed six!!

Delish! I didn't let it wait an hour and used fresh blueberries, but otherwise followed everything. Made with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce with fresh blueberries too. I will definately make this again and use it for my base recipe. Perfectly fluffy and not too dense.

These were very good.  Since my blueberries were frozen, I just placed them on top of the pancakes on the griddle rather than mixing them in and turning the batter blue.  I will admit, we only made it through about a 45 minute wait before cooking them, but they were very puffy and turned out great. My only "complaint" is that there's no way this recipe serves 6, it made 11 small pancakes and 2 medium ones.  There are only 5 of us (including a baby and a 2-year old) and  it still wasn't quite enough for us all (I usually have extra batter left over after making other pancake recipes).  I'd say it serves 4 maybe, not 6.  I'll probably double the recipe next time.  Thanks for the great dinner!

I loved these! They were very fluffy and light, and I didn't wait an hour, I just fried them right away! But I did have to add a lot more sugar, about 2 tbsp. As to the other reviews: my batter didn't turn green when I added my blueberries, because I only folded them in and didn't over-stir. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is simple and delicious! As other reviewers stated, it is not ecessary to wait an hour before cooking. I have made these twice and will definitely use this recipe again. I think next time i will try starwberries instead of blueberries.

These are good pancakes, which I did make as directed, including letting the batter sit the hour. The Buttermilk Pancakes 1 on this site are delicious; these are a good alternate if you don't have buttermilk.

These pancakes were delicious! I've never made pancakes from scratch before and they turned out wonderfully.  I made a few changes which is why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5: I used brown sugar instead of white, I added one tsp of pure vanilla extract and I used fresh blueberries, not frozen.  Also, I didn't have enough time to let them sit out for an hour so I gave them 20 minutes; they still came out light and fluffy so I suspect the hour is unnecessary.

This is a decent recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla because I like it. I'm knocking off an entire star for the serving size. It says it serves 6, yet I was lucky to get 6 normal sized pancakes from it. This would feed 3 people, if they each had 2 normal-sized pancakes each, or 2 people if either of those people is a male above the age of 10. Serving size IS important. Thankfully I went into this knowing it wouldn't be enough so it wasn't our entire dinner, but I can imagine less wary cooks than I winding up needing to double the batch in a hurry -- and this recipe needs (but does not require) 1 hour to sit and bubble. And, yes, you can just go ahead and prepare the pancakes without waiting an hour. But then you've made another recipe, not this one. Sure you can divide the baking powder in half. But again, you've made another recipe. THIS recipe makes fluffy pancakes as written. I do think I'd use a buttermilk recipe for next time, still, thank you for the recipe!

These pancakes were as fluffy and puffy as clouds.  I used canola oil instead of butter.  These were on the bland side, and they needed a lot of syrup. Update: I left out the salt, added 3 T brown sugar, a bit more milk, and some cake spice - a big improvement in the flavor department.

This was my first time making pancakes from scratch. I usually "just add water" But it was so easy and SO YUMMY! I added blackberries and strawberries and blended all of it in a food processor cause I don't like chunks in pancakes, and we put a little cinnamon sugar on top and whip cream... mmmm. I will totally make this again.

As written these are bland. I would add a bit more sugar next time  and perhaps some lemon zest. The texture is wonderful and they fry up beautifully. Also, our teeth felt funny after eating them....sorta like sandpaper, and I wonder if it might be from the large amount of baking powder. I am sure my husband will not eat them again, since he was brushing his teeth immediately after we ate ;) I may make them again w/ a few changes??

These were amazing! My husband made them for Sunday breakfast...since we were in a rush we couldn't wait the hour but I'm not sure it mattered. Amazing! We (meaning he) used a little more than 1/2 c. of fresh blueberries in the batter and then mixed the rest of the container w/ 1/4c real maple syrup and simmered then used that over the pancakes. YUM!!!

This was a solid recipe - I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and added a touch more sugar and a dash of vanilla.  Also, from experience, I do not recommend folding the blueberries in the pancake batter - instead, once you've poured out your pancakes into the skillet, drop the desired amount on top - they won't sink in or burst that way!

I followed the recipe as stated (except waiting the hour) and the pancakes turned out wonderfully!  They were indeed light and fluffy.

Yum!  Like others, I did not "let stand for an hour."  Also, I used about 1 cup of fresh blueberries, not 1/2 cup of frozen.  Yum yum.

This recipe is great! I have used it 4 or 5 times in the past few months. The pancakes come out so thick and fluffy. They are really filling! As others have said, you don't need to wait any time at all once the batter is mixed. Also, I used fresh blueberries, and less than the recipe called for. When I used an entire half of a cup the blueberry taste was a tad over-whelming. Toss a few fresh berries on top of the pancakes on a plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar on top. It looks and tastes amazing!!

This is a great base recipe for making any fruit pancake.  The blueberry is good, but strawberry is probably my favorite.  As it is written, the pancakes come out a little bland (but I don't use any kind of topping, so that might be why), so I add a little bit of vanilla extract to the batter.  Delicious!

First, you do not have to wait the time to cook these. You can cook them right away and they are great! I've made so many of these and they are all perfect each time. What a great recipe as is.

I made these for my husband this morning and they were a phenomenal success. We used fresh blueberries and waited 15 minutes rather than an hour for the batter to settle. I highly recommend Todd's pancakes!

This recipe is fantastic!  I wish I could give it 10 stars!  I followed it precisely and won't alter it a bit the next time I make these.  This was very easy too -- thanks so much for posting this recipe!

THE BEST pancakes I have ever made!  My husband and children raised their eyebrows and asked for many, many more!  Definately double the recipe when making...there can never be enough of these.  I also didn't wait very long to start cooking them, perhaps just 15 minutes.  I would give 10 stars if I could.  Gourmet all the way.  :)

These were good blueberry pancakes.  I left the batter to rest while I ran DS to school and DH cooked them while I was gone- they were still fine without the rest, but I'd like to try them with the rest.

Yum!  I made a few changes -used 3 Tbsp Splenda instead of sugar, omitted the salt & used oil instead of butter.  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the batter and didn't add the blueberries until I spooned the batter onto the griddle.  I used the batter immediately (didn't wait the hour) and it resulted in a tender, fluffy pancake.  Everyone loved them with a little butter, syrup & Grandpa added whipped cream.

These turned out great, my husband especially like them.  I agree with the other reviews, the batter doesn't need to rest if you are short on time.  They still turned out fluffy and tasty, thank you!

I found these to be tasteless and dense!  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and added sugar - strange that the recipe didn't call for it.  Anyway - BLAND and DENSE but these did make for a tall pancake.

I thought these were just okay.  Not really outstanding in any way, and they weren't really light or fluffy.  Didn't like the waiting time on them either.

Very good pancakes and they adapt well to Gluten Free pancakes. I use fresh blueberries when I have them to cut prep time down. Or I sprinkle the frozen berries into the pancake as I cook them. Be gentle! Great pancakes!!

They were good, but not very sweet, not much flavor. I liked the fresh blueberries for sure. Texture was good but only 3 stars b/c of lack of flavor. Maybe it's b/c I didn't have any syrup, who knows :)

I admit, these pancakes take a long time to make (considering the one hour wait), but they turn out so fluffy, so tasty, I am never using the instant mix again. all other recipes I tried turned out to have a strange aftertaste, but not these. I made them with blueberries and without, both times they turned out great.

I just finshed making these.I usually make truck stop buttermilk pancakes from this site.But, i was out of buttermilk so i thought i would try these..They were ok.The batter seemed very thick to me even after i added more milk to thin it a bit.They had good enough flavor.But very heavy!They fluffed up great.My kid's said the other recipe is  better,lighter & fluffier we also found them tuff to cut.Not sure i will make them again.Next time i will just run to the store for buttermilk instead of being lazy,lol.Thnx anyway.

The whole family loves these. It's becoming a Sat morning tradition (while blueberries are in season anyway). My daughter goes out that morning and picks the blueberries and the kids get to help make them. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious, but this recipe only made about 6-7 pancakes. I about doubled the amount of blueberries--personally, I like the berries to be close together.

Absolutely the best pancakes I have ever eaten, hands down!  They are a delicious dense pancake.  I have tried them without the blueberries, with blueberries, with banana and nuts, etc.  These pancakes are good anyway you have them!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

This is the fourth pancake recipe I've tried from this site, and these are by far the best!!  I didn't have any blueberries, so I just added another spoonful of sugar and cooked them as is.  Excellent!  Just like you hope they'll be.  I didn't bother waiting an hour for the batter to "activate".  I made the pancakes right away.  They were great.  My husband said these were the best ever.  These are my new pancakes for weekly use!

Definitely follow the recommendation to serve with brown sugar and butter.  DELICIOUS!  Also, I used butter as the grease for my pan.  Pancakes fried up w/ crispy edges but still moist, and caky inside.

I used fresh blueberries and a little more sugar than the recipe calls for. I still wanted syrup on mine, but they were delicious!

I give this 5 stars with 2 easy changes. 1) Use 3/4 cup of blueberries and 2) add 1 tsp of almond extract.  Delicious!  I have made this recipe half a dozen times and I never wait an hour, the pancakes still taste great.  My only complaint is the serving size - it actually only makes about 8 small pancakes, which is only 2 servings in my household!

We made these this morning, and they were fantastic.  My husband said that they were the best pancakes he'd ever had.  The only change I made was that I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I also separated the egg white and beat that until soft peaks formed, then I folded it into the batter.  They were SO light and fluffy.  Excellent recipe!

These pancakes were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and was very happy with the results. I will freeze some local blueberries so that we can make this all year long. Thanks.

These were quite tasty. I only let my batter sit for about 10-15 minutes before cooking and they turned out fine. Not sure what the advantage to letting them sit longer would be. Also, it only made 8 1/4 cup sized pancakes for me. So, I would say that it serves 2-3 people. I mixed 1/2 cup blueberries into the batter and then sprinkled a few more on top of the pancakes after I had poured them into the pan.

Yum!  I just made these for dinner tonight and they were great!  I used fresh blueberries instead, and added an extra Tbs sugar.  I also only let them set about 20 min and they were still great!  Exactly what I was looking for.

I had high hopes for these, but they didn't really do it for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they didn't blow me away at all.  Perhaps this is due to my living at altitude, which tends to mess with things in general, but I'll keep looking.

A very simple and easy breakfast.  I could taste some of the baking powder so I might cut back on that next time. The kids gobbled them up and my husband who usually dosen't care for blueberries even ate 2 pancakes.

Love this recipe! I used whole wheat flour and soy milk instead though. (when using soy milk however, it seems to need alot more than the recipe calls for with reg milk, just add a little a time as mixing and find the consistency you want)

These are the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made. The batter comes out very thick, so the pancakes don't come out in a perfectly round shape, but they taste good. I do think they need either more salt or sugar. Not sure which. I will keep experimenting. One comment about the recipe's cooking time: I have never had luck cooking pancakes on a high temperature. I find the outside is done, but he inside is raw. Therefore I always cook my pancakes at a lower heat, so the inside has more time to cook. UPDATE: I continued to work on tweaking this recipe because I did not like that the pancakes did not form circles.  What I do now, is I use one cup flour per recipe instead of one and a fourth cup of flour. I use half WW flour to try to make it a bit healthier. I also double the blueberries. These are our go to recipe now, every time.

I have made these pancakes multiple times now - I always get rave reviews. I use frozen or fresh blueberries. I usually let the batter sit for a good hour..and I make sure to stir it as little as necessary..its fantastic.

Extremely delicious! I made these with fresh blueberries, and did let the batter set aside for an hour before making them. I also threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips I had laying around the pantry. Exceptionally fluffy and tasty! The thing I thought was super-special about these is that while most pancakes get unappetizing once they're cold, the leftovers to these tasted delicious cold. We ate them like cookies (sans syrup)!

The consistency was good, but there wasn't much flavor. I think more sugar and maybe a splash of lemon juice would work well with the berries.

I was looking forward to making these, based on the reviews, but for some reason mine came out gummy.  They weren't light or fluffy as I expected. I didn't alter the ingredients because the reviews sounded so good. I wouldn't make them again.

These are famous for a reason -they are AWESOME! It was my 1st attempt at pancakes and I could not have been happier. I prepared the recipe as written, with the exception of the sugar- I added 1 Tbls and used canola oil for the melted butter. The results were light, fluffy and super delicious.  Will make again and again and use this as a 'plain' pancake recipe as well. Thank you Allison/Todd, a keeper for sure!!!:)

This was my first time ever making pancakes from scratch and I definitely picked the right recipe to start with! They were fluffy and very tasty! I even added a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla to experiment. Only thing that I'd mention is that I made this recipe for 2 people and it was the perfect amount, so you might want to double the recipe for a family. I might try this recipe next time with fresh blueberries next time, but the frozen ones worked out perfectly! Very delicious!

Flavor was good, very sweet...I doubled the recipe and think that it had too much sugar as the pancakes were heavy and sticky! I'm not a great pancake maker anyway but I would probably try this again and not double the sugar if I make a bigger batch...I used fresh blueberries-yum!

These are simple and good.  Not out of this world, but definitely good.  I used frozen blueberries and wonder if fresh would be better (fresh usually is!).

This is a very tastey!  I agree with some prior reviews that is it bland, so I suggest adding the following: 1 tbl of butter (instead of 1/2) 1 1/2-2 tbl of mexican vanilla, and to save on un-wanted calories, substitute splenda for sugar.  I think it tastes better my way but you can be the judge!

Perfect recipe as written. I only let mine sit for 1/2 an hour, but I don't think that really affected the outcome. Just the right amount of sweetness. I may actually increase the blueberries the next time, though, just because I love blueberries!

Awesome! I substituted in soy milk and it worked out great. I also added sliced bananas after putting them into the pan and I think that is what made them taste so amazing!

The pancake was bland but the pancakes turned out big and "fluffy". It only made 8 pancakes for me when I used a 1/4 cup for pouring...so if I make this again I'm going to have to double this recipe for a family of 5.

Yummy!  I made these after my son had a friend sleep over and I felt obliged to make a decent breakfast.  I originally wanted Apple Blueberry pancakes so I added in a cup of applesauce, which I thought would mean leaving out a cup of milk.  I ended up adding in most of the second cup.(I doubled the recipe) The pancakes turned out amazingly well!  Between DH, the two boys and my toddler they polished off almost all of it, leaving me just one teeny one at the end.  It was pretty darn good...but tasted like more.:(

Who needs the blueberries?  This one sure doesn't.  It was so good.  I have been a bisquick user for many years and although it is decent it does not compare with this recipe.  It was deemed "the best pancakes I have ever eaten" by my man.  It was so easy, and no need to wait that hour.  It must make it better somehow but I have never waited that long to try it.  This beats anything you get at a restaurant!

Easy and delish! I didn't wait the hour and they turned out wonderful. I have never made pancakes from scatch, but my daughter loves blueberries and she loves pancakes so I wanted to try making them for her 2nd birthday breakfast. She even helped me and they turned out perfect.

I don't know where I went wrong, I followed the recipe and measurements exactly and they were so thick I could not scoop them into the pan properly, I added extra milk to thin them out - they turned out very thick and pasty tasting.  All we could taste was flour - unfortunately they all ended up in the garbage : (

These were delicious!  I added a touch of vanilla, but other than that I made these as written.  Waiting an hour seemed a little silly; after thirty minutes, I was ready to go!  I didn't notice any difference in having waited even that long, but hey.  They were light and fluffy and had a great blueberry taste; just what I wanted.  Will make again!

very good! Didn't wait the hour like it said... we were hungry. I had some sweetened condensed milk already opened so i cut the regular milk to 3/4c and added about 1/4c of the sweet milk. If I didn't do this, i would probably double the sugar. I also added the thawed blueberries to each pancake, not the whole bowl.

These pancakes didn't have much flavor. Probably, because of frozen berries. I`am not sure I`ll make these again.

These were delicious! I have to admit I prefer whole wheat flour but my significant other likes white...so I used half whole wheat and other half I used white..To compensate for the heavyness of the wheat flour  I separated the egg yolks  from the whites and beat the egg whites until stiff...I folded them into the batter at the end.. pancakes turned out light and fluffy!

Overall, this recipe was DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes though.   I increased the sugar to 1 Tablespoon. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract  and some extra blueberries.  My daughter said these were the best pancakes she has ever had!!  This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing Todd!

This recipe is so easy you will never make pancakes from a box again. I found that adding frozen blueberries to the batter didn't add much taste. Instead I add a pinch of cinnamon, sugar and a few drops of almond extract to the pancake batter. Then after I cook the pancakes I top them off with fresh berries and maple syrup. Delicious!

They had a slightly funny taste, but I think it may have been just because I didn't cook them long enough. I don't know. Otherwise these were super easy and super good!

I've made these pancakes twice so far and they have come out well, though I always need to add more milk than is indicated to get a good consistency. I wonder if the original intention was to have the flour measured after sifting which would account for why my batter is always too thick. I use an aluminum free baking powder and extra sugar to avoid the off taste that some have mentioned.

YUM! So good! I didn't leave them for the hour it called for, my boyfriend and I were WAY to hungry, but they were still delicious and fluffy. I will make them this morning exactly as it says and see if it makes a difference. I even made one pancake w/out the blueberries a for my boyfriend and he said it tasted just fine.

These were just okay. Seems to me there was something missing, only I wasn't sure what it was. I barely mixed the batter at all, only to incorporate the ingredients and let the batter sit and 
the pancakes still turned out tough.

Could just be a mistake somewhere on my end, only I'm not sure what it could be. 
I'll try this again another time and see if it was just an off day for pancakes.

This recipe was a perfect consistency.   We'll use again but probably add some cinnamon next time.

These were a huge hit this morning for breakfast! They were easy to put together and cooked up well. I added a little vanilla but you don't have to. My daughter ate them without syrup and raved about them!

These are hands down the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made.  They are SO worth the hour long wait.  I made them just like the recipe said except I added the berries when the cakes were on the griddle.  Only because my family is picky and I often add different flavors.  FANTASTIC!  Go Todd!

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  It is now the most asked for breakfast in my house. I have made the recipe several times.  The first time I waited the hour for the batter to set and then after that I did not.  I did not notice a difference in the final pancake.  Last thing, this recipe lends itself well to other fruits.  I had a morning that I was almost out of blueberries so I also added strawberries.  It was really good! Next I might have to try adding peaches.

Excellent! My fiance and I are on a no sugar no wheat diet so we used Spelt flour (found at Sun Harvest) and 1/4 & 1/8 tsp of stiva natural sweetener instead of sugar and they were so good! If I hadn't been the one making them I never would have known the difference. Thanks for the great and simple recipe!

I used flax seed instead of an egg (I was out) and they still turned out good. They were really thick though and the batter looked more like biscuit dough! I will make them again with egg next time. Good recipe

These were pretty good.  I used fresh bluberrries and did not let it sit for an hour like others said.  I believe that making them with bisquick is just as good and faster..

This is the best blueberry pancake recipe I have ever made! My kids actually cheer  when I make pancakes! I do add a bit more sugar, some vanilla, and I do not let the batter sit for an hour. Most times that I make it I double or triple the recipe and freeze some for during the school week. This recipe will be a long time family favorite in my home!

These were awesome! I doubled the recipe, thawed my blueberries in the microwave and didn't have to wait for an hour. I also used buttermilk instead and do have to agree with others that it needed more, so I added a lot more buttermilk to get it to the right consistency.  I also added cinnamon and pure vanilla. I served with pure maple syrup.  Yum Yum Yum!! My whole family loved them.

My favourite pancake recipe!  I use this with or without blueberries (always fresh ones!) and substitute other berries in season too.  I have never been able to wait the suggested hour, but have always had good results.  These pancakes are fluffy and yummy.  The only change I have made was increase the amount of sugar as I like them to be sweeter on their own.

I tried these this morning, and really though the batter was too thick and doughy, but when they were cooked they turned out really well. I made the first three and served then to my boyfriend, who liked them but thought they were too bland, so I added cinnamon to the batter before making the rest. It definetely helped. Overall we thought they were great pankcakes.

My husband loves to make a big breakfast on weekends, and has always reached for the Bisquick to start.  After persuading him to try this recipe, the Bisquick has been banished--these pancakes came out plump, succulent, and absolutely perfect!

Way too thick which made it hard to cook through without getting tough on the outside.  Would use more milk and more sugar.  Good start, just needs some work.

I've made these twice now and my family LOVES these!  My nine year old actually requested that I make them the second time this week.  I used fresh berries and didn't wait the hour before frying, and they turned out great.  I am sure when bberry season is over that we will try these with the frozen kind as well.  Thanks for an EASY and tasty recipe!

Easy to put together, but needed a little more sugar.  They took on the tartness of the blueberries a little too much.

I read the reviews before making these and I'm glad I did or else they would have been a disaster. I doubled the reicpe to make enough for all my roomates. I added an extra half cup of milk... but they still could have used another 1/2 c. or so. I also halfed the baking powder, turned the sugar into Tablespoons instead of teaspoons and added about a Tablespoon of vanilla. They are delicious but still a little heavy/dry. Go with about an extra half cup of milk to the 6 serving recipe or an extra whole cup to my doubled recipe. Good luck! They are yuumy :)

After reading the reviews...I tripled the recipe as we like leftovers for the boys to heat up before school and I am feeding three hungry men/teenagers to begin with.  I did add 1 c. more milk and I also increased the sugar to Tbs. instead of tsp. and added 1 Tbs. vanilla.  Even though I thinned the batter and didn't quite wait the full hour, pancakes fluffed up nicely.

I used 2 tsp of baking powder, 1 tbp of sugar & added a full cup of blueberries (I used frozen). I didn't wait the full hour ...I think 10 minutes is plenty of time to get the batter to rise a bit. The panacakes were very light & flavorful but I don't think I'll addd as many blueberries next time. I think 3/4 cup would be plenty. I only got 5 average size panacakes out of this batter, so keep that in mind. My grandson ate 3 of them himself! Thanks for a very good pancake recipe Alison!

These pancakes turned out pretty good. I did make a few adjustments, I added a splash of vanilla and lemon juice, used a few more blueberries then it called for, used brown sugar instead of white, and as recommended by others I used less baking powder then it called for, also I didn't let it sit for an hour. I think the next time I will let it sit. 

The recipe as is, does not feed 4 in my opinion. I increased the recipe for a 6 servings and it made 12 1/4 cup pancakes. 

Good recipe, thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe. The taste was great, thought the appearance was a bit of a disappointment the first time I made these. They definitely had a green-ish tinge due to the mixing of the yellow from the egg and the blue from the blueberry. The second time I used this recipe, I just added the blueberries directly to the batter right before pouring into the pan, and had normal looking pancakes. I served these with the blueberry sauce recipe from this site and it made for one happy clan!

I added ground flax seed, and used soy milk instead of regular. Added a bit more sugar, and real vanilla extract, also. Very good, very filling. Will definitely add to my list of regularly used recipes! Definitely a 5-star recipe!

I did not do the one hour chill and agree with the other reviewers, it doesn't need it.  I made these for "breakfast for dinner" for 3 of my boys last night and they were VERY tasty.  Turned out perfectly with no modications.  I used frozen, thawed blueberries with a great result.  The leftovers tasted great this morning for breakfast.

Used this as a basic pancake recipe by omitting the blueberries and adding a splash of vanilla.  Turned out light and fluffy.  Excellent pancakes.  This has now turned into my new house recipe.

Made these over our vacation last week for a crew and they were well liked. Don't see how this recipe could serve six people tho. I had to triple the ingredients. Only one little pancake leftover which the seagulls enjoyed as much as we did. Thanks!

Wanted a change of pace for breakfast and had some leftover blueberries that needed to be used up. This was a very nice recipe. Added a little bit of vanilla as well as cinnamon. Served with blueberry syrup.

Well I don't know about your house, but in my house each person eats more than one pancake.  I did follow the recipe exactly, and was looking forward to serving 4 people (considering the recipe serving is 6 people).  This recipe made 7 small-ish pancakes (using 1/4 measure just like the recipe calls for).  Not only that, I found that the pancakes were a bit tough in the end.  My husband liked them marginally more than I did, but we won't be making them again.

Came out very bland.  I added more blueberries than called for.  Still bland.  Made a few pancakes and sampled, realized they were too cakey tasting, so i added sugar to them.  Still, not very tasty.  Maybe with really sweet syrup or something it would help.  Or a dusting of powdered sugar.  MAYBE it would help.

Fabulous!  I followed this recipe exactly, except i didn't wait for an hour before cooking. Instead, I cooked them right away.  They were perfect.  We sweetened them with brown sugar, butter and syrup before eating.  Yum!

These turned out great! I took the advice to reduce the amount of baking powder, and I added more blueberries (fresh).

I substituted the blueberries with a cup of light blueberry yogurt and it turned out fabulous.  Soft and fluffy with a bit of elasticity.  Tasty!

I ran out of bisquick this morning so I found this recipe for pancakes.  I didn't add any blueberries since this wasn't planned, I also added more sugar to the recipe and didn't wait an hour.  The pancakes were not at all thin, in fact the first batch of pancakes were quite thick, so I used less batter for the remaining pancakes.  This recipe was very satisfying, thanks.

We didn't enjoy this recipe at all. My daughter is a blueberry fanatic, and she only ate a half of one. I made this recipe exactly how it is was written, except waiting the hour.  It needed more sugar in the batter.  I will stick to my Betty Crocker cook book recipe.

Only made 6 small to average sized pancakes for us, but that was wnough to fill the four of us. They were also on the heavy side, as opposed to light and fluffy, but they were still quite tasty.

These were pretty good. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and Lactaid Skim milk, as I am lactose intolerant. I added a mix of blueberries, strawberries and blackberries, defroseted, and it was really delicious. I did have to add more milk, as the batter was so thick I could barely stir it. I will definitely make again, as they are so easy, and I would like to try them plain, with no fruit.

This is indeed one of the best and easiest pancake recipies I've made.  I doubled it and they all disappeared like magic.  Great because they are not to sweet and are very light.  Thank you Alison for sharing this one.  It's a KEEPER!!

Very good!  I added additional sugar to the batter and topped with butter, brown sugar and chopped pecans and omitted using any syrup.  I let the batter sit for 1 hour.  This recipe is a keeper and will definitely make again.  Husband liked them, too.
