I just finished making this fudge a couple of hours ago and honestly, it's about the ugliest fudge I've ever seen. I tasted it as it began to cool and it is way too sweet and doesn't taste like strawberries at all. It does look like leather! Used my thermometer and am a habitual fudge maker, but this one was horrible. What a waste of good strawberries.

This fudge had a food taste,but I can not get it to set up.
I even tried cooking it from soft ball stage to hard ball stage and it still didnt set.
This recipe is alittle to expensive to try and experiment with.

This had a great flavor, but did not get firm.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a candy thermometer to verify proper temp.  Please help.  I would love to be able to make this so it comes out correctly.

The name strawberry fudge is inaccurate. It had the texture of caramel and the flavor of raisins (which I loathe). Strawberries don't boil well, I guess. And just because something is cooked to soft ball stage, put it in a pan to cool, and cut it into squares, doesn't make it fudge. Obviously we didn't like it.

This was my first attempt at candy making.  This is really tasty, though mine were more like taffy than fudge in texture (probably my inexperience, not necessarily the recipe!).  It didn't set firmly.  I'd like to get a thermometer and try it again as we love the flavor.  Quick and easy.

It was much too sweet, and came out looking like gooey fruit leather. It wasn't fudge at all. I couldn't even cut it to get out of the pan, it would just kind of stick to everything.

It turned to glass after it had set. I couldn't slice it with any of the knives in my kitchen.

Like the other reviewers, I found that this "fudge" didn't set well at all, even though I made sure it reached the temperature specified.  I doubt if we're all that klutzy--the recipe must be off somewhere.

My other complaint is that it looks disgusting.  I was going to take it to a church potluck but even if it had set firmly enough, I wouldn't have, because the appearance is so bad that I don't think anyone would have tried it.

That said, it tastes really good, so if you're just making it for yourself and you don't care what it looks like or feels like, go right ahead!

I did not care for this fudge recipe. Turned out like caramel. Tastes way too sweet for anyone to eat. I was very disappointed as I could've used my strawberries for a better recipe.

I used a candy thermometer and it wouldn't get up to temp and just when it started to go, it started to burn. I also burned my potholder in the processes. Unfortunately, I don't think this fudge was worth it.

Followed recipe exactly, including using a candy thermometer. 
This recipe does NOT turn into fudge.
If you want real fudge use a different recipe.

Ok, like all the other reviews mine did not solidify either.  I was mad at myself because I thought I messed up, but I did follow the recipe exactly. I was really looking forward to something good and unique.
