I'm still going to give this 5 stars even though I did not put two teaspoons  of salt in it :eek: can't even imagine with one cup of liquid equivalent.....along with the fact that I never add salt anyway. The other changes I made I don't feel had any affect on the outcome, olive oil for canola and liquid stevia for the sugar and I cut the garlics into slices. Everything melded quite nicely and had a soft flavor.

Agreed about too much salt (1/2-1 tsp max), otherwise this is good.  Can add mushrooms, avocado, cooked bacon, hardboiled eggs etc.

This was a very nice tangy yet sweet dressing. The only change I made was I had run out of sugar so I substituted honey.
