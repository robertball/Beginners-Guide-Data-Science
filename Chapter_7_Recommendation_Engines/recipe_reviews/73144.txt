My family really did *not* like this recipe.  Originally, I thought perhaps I had accidentally switched some of the measurements, since some of the flavours were overpowering to the point of being sickening.  Perhaps it was the steak sauce brand that I used.  The meatballs were okay (but I would reduce the amount of curry by at least half).  My sister actually suggested rinsing the sauce off them.

We really wanted to like this recipe. We love when people combine common flavors in uncommon ways! But in our opinion the curry in the sauce was a terrible choice.

These were really good.  I did make a couple of (I think) small changes.  I did not have enough worcestershire (and thought 1/2 cup would have been too much, anyway), so I drained the bottle I had and ended up with about 2TBS.  Also, I forgot the garlic.  Otherwise pretty much as written.  Served them with Farfalle (bowtie) pasta.  The meatballs had a distinctive (and I mean that in a good way) flavor... warm without being overpoweringly spicy... with an excellent texture.  Will definitely make again.  Good for a potluck ... and I migh not even need to provide pasta ... the sauce is so good!

I'm sorry but, honestly, the sauce was absolutely disgusting. The reviewer who said it was strong to the point of being sickening wasn't joking. I managed to half salavage it by adding a can of diced tomatoes, a can of low-sodium beef broth, and some V8 veggie juice. Even then the flavor was still very strong, and there was no way I was going to eat it. Luckily, the meatballs I was using were just fairly bland ones that I made last week. I'm sure I would have ended up throwing it all out had I made the meatballs in the original recipe. Husband ate this begrudgingly.

This is a really great recipe! I toned a few things down a bit, based on previous reviews (I halved the curry, vinegar, and lemon juice) and the result was delicious! Separately and together, the two parts of the recipe have really worked out well for me.

My rating is only for the meatball part of the recipe not the sauce. I have my own homemade BBQ sauce which I use over and over again! I have never cooked meatballs in the oven before and had always been frusterated with meatballs that were dry after frying. These meatballs turned out moist and perfect!

Another Allrecipes winner. Meatballs cooked this way should be easily adapted for use with other sauces, too.

We really enjoyed these meatballs. I tweaked the recipe a bit...I used half of the onion it called for in both parts of the recipe. Also, since the other reviews said the sauce was too strong, I replaced the beef stock with water, and used 1/4 c. worcestershire, took out the coffee (coffee in meatballs???!).  It was very tasty and I will be making this again.

Very tasty!! I think if or when I make these again, I will cut back on the Worcestershire sauce by about half, it kind of overpowered the gravy to me.  I did add a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the left over sauce up.  I brought a few to my wife at work, and she called asking if I could bring more back, she loved them.  I served them over buttered egg noodles.  Even my 5 year old ate 3 of them, and she usually is very pickey with what she eats.

I have been using this recipe for ages. We all love it, and it's such a nice change from ordinary meatballs. Everyone I have served this up to wants the recipe. It never fails and is always good! I don't usually add the coffee though as it makes the sauce too strong for my liking. Just as nice without.

Fantastic! My other half likes to think he is a huge food buff and is usually very hard to please. I have now made these meatballs three times in the past fortnight - AT HIS REQUEST.

I'd give these a 4.5 rating.  I put in a lot of extra garlic and used seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Also, I didn't have enough instant coffee, and only used just under a tablespoon.  I didn't even notice the curry powder.  Good meatballs...my husband really like them!

I love this recipe. I really like the tangy bite of the sauce and the meatballs go well with rice (maybe better than pasta).

A great change from the traditional meatballs that get served at parties.  The sauce was very unique and had a nice little kick.  I did not have any curry to add to the meatballs however, but I am not a curry fan, so that is probably for the best.  I love the idea of baking them, rather than frying.  And yes, they are better the next day reheated!  
Will definitely make again!
Thanks for the recipe!

I thought that the meatballs were very average, nothing special about them.  I'm even a big curry fan.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

These meatballs are great and so different from most others.  If you aren't a big fan of curry you can leave that ingredient out or just reduce it and they are still fabulous!

The recipe's great! This is on of the best meatballs I've tasted.  I'm going to add some mashed potatoes the next time I make it! I've garnished it with a sprinkle of ground cloves or the italian seasoning. To me, the  sauce is just right. I guess it depends on each other's palate. So don't degrade the recipe! =)

Be warned - the sauce is very strongly flavoured;  I'm glad that one of the reviewers mentioned to cut back on the curry in the meatballs too.  All in all, an unusual combination, to say the least!

I cooked these for an Australian International dinner I hosted so I quadrupled the recipe and good thing because everyone came back for seconds!!  This recipes was wonderful!  I've never cooked meat balls in the oven before and they were so good when they were done I considered eating them without the sauce!  But I was really glad I added the sauce. Yummy!  Be careful not to over cook the meatball once you've added the sauce.  I had to make extra sauce because most of it had carmalized!

These were delicious, very easy to make and everyone loved them.  I'll definitely be making them again!

I doubled up the recipe and used half beef and half pork, with Italian-Seasoned breadcrumbs.  I prefer my meatballs not to have chunks of onion in them, so instead of chopping the onions for the meatballs I minced them in the foodprocessor.  That made them wetter and was probably why I didn't need to add any milk before shaping the mixture.

This is my first time preparing an Australian dish and the meatballs were wonderful. The only thing I would recommend is eliminating half the amount of vinegar, wherein, meatballs is a bit too tangy. Other than that, this is not a bad dish.

I made this for a party as an appetizer.  All the guys loved it.  I now have to bring them to all the parties I go to.
