This is exactly the sugar cookie recipe I was looking for.  Light, flaky, slightly crisp, but not crunchy.  Perfect flavor with the vanilla and almond extracts.  This is definitely a keeper for those who like a traditional sugar cookie.  For those who like thick, soft cookies, you'll want to try something else.

Good recipe- just have to adjust the baking time and temp.  Mine were browning around the edges after 5 minutes, making them too crunchy and hard.  Sugar cookies should be tender and soft, in my opinion.  After turning down the heat to 350 and baking for only 6 minutes, these were perfect.  I prefer sugar cookies using powdered sugar instead of granulated- I think it makes them more soft and tender.  Frosted with luscious buttercream frosting from this site.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe ever!  Until I found this recipe my cookies came out dry and flavorless.  I didn't have almond extract so I only used vanilla extract which I added a little extra.  I also Rolled the dough between wax paper to avoid excess flour to dry them out.  These cookies are fabulous!

I tried these at Christmas time this year.  They weren't terribly difficult to make and the dough was easy to work with (with a well-floured board and rolling pin), but this recipe only made half the amount I thought it should.  The taste was okay--a little bland, but better with frosting.  They also spread too much during baking, and did not hold their shape very well at all!  I don't think I'll make these again; they're just too bland and crumbly.  I've tried several sugar cookie recipes from this website, and one of the reviewers said she'd stick to the recipe in BHG for sugar cookie cutouts.  Then I tried that recipe as well.  I agree with her 100%--BHG's were exactly right, just what I was looking for!

Perfect recipe!  These made the perfect cookies--soft without being chewy, with a lovely melt-in-your-mouth texture.  I topped with buttercream icing and they were terrific, I love the almond flavor.  I'm not sure why some have had problems with this recipe but I would say to make sure the powdered sugar you measure is already sifted, rather than taking a cup and a half of packed powdered sugar and THEN sifting it, or you could end up with too much.  And to keep them soft make sure you don't roll them out too thin, these do need to be rolled out a bit thicker than most sugar cookies.  The only problem I had was that this didn't make anywhere NEAR as many cookies as the recipe said it would, but the ones I did have were fabulous!

My mother has made these cookies for years.  They are my favorite sugar cookies.  I love the hint of almond flavoring.  You can also shape this dough in to a log, wrap, chill, and use as a slice and bake cookie.  Dip the tops in color tinted sugar--and you have an easy treat for the kids!  I also don't think you can really get 5 dozen out of this recipe--unless you roll them out super thin.  I usually get about 3 dozen.

This is the best cookie recipe.  I use this for my personal cooking and for my 8th grade Home Economics classes.  The powdered sugar in the recipe makes the dough easy to work with and the students can roll the dough many times without it becoming stiff.

I always chill the cookie dough over-night for my classes, but it can be placed in the freezer for 15 minutes and will roll out o.k.  If it is too stiff to roll when you remove it on day two, pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds so it is workable.  (You may have to do this a couple of times.) I work with a small amount of dough at a time and leave the rest in the refrigerator. After it has been rolled once, push the left-overs back together and roll again.

This recipe was given to me by a friend three years ago who has long since moved out of State.  I wrote it down on an envelope and lost it this past year and have been trying to find it again since it has been a family favorite!  I have used this recipe for numerous projects at school for Valentines Day as a room mom, soccer parties, at home for any given holiday and bake sales, etc.  I have found that it is better to use the dough directly after mixing due to ease of use. It is a firm cookie when baked, but flaky.  It is a GREAT cookie for kids to decorate since they are not "soggy" in texture and hold up very well to little hands.  They have wonderful flavor!  I also bake my cookies for 12 min. instead of 8 or until the edges are a golden brown.  We like the golden edges better and have noticed that they have almost a "spritz" like flavor.  This is one recipe that I am happy to have back! Thank you!

The cookies were good once I fixed them.  I refrigerated then overnight so when it came time to roll and cut they were to crumbly and hard.  I had to add a little water to roll out and then cook.  Once done they were very good.

These are good, but not the best.  I usually use the Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe from this site, but chose this one this time.  I followed the instructions, but the dough did crack a little when rolling.  After baking for the specified time, I had a few cookies completely break after removing them from the pan.  The flavor is terrific (I do love almond flavoring), so I wish I had had better luck this recipe.

Made this recipe for years and watched it deteriate over time.  Problem:   I was using the same jar of cream of tarter for the last 6 years.    Buy some fresh cream of tarter everyone!!!!!  and if you don't have almond extract remove a 1/2 of the flour and replace it with a 1/2 cup of Red Mill Almond flour (or grind your own almonds in a food processor).  The almond flour gives it just the slightest meaty kind of a texture but the cookies are delicate (with or without the almond flour) and these are not good for shipping to Iraq or Afganistan

My office loved these for Halloween!  Will definately make again and again!  Note:  I found it easier to roll out straight from the fridge as opposed to letting it sit.  Plus I had to use lots of flour cause it was a bit sticky.

The cream of tartar in this is a great improvement over the usual floury taste of sugar cookies, and the texture is great (but like others have noted, these are more fragile than traditional sugar cookies). I roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper while it's just slightly cool to help hold the dough together, then put it back in the fridge on the cutting board for a few minutes before cutting out the cookies. Because of the almond extract, these are even good without decorating. Thanks to Pat for posting this recipe; it was used by the mother of my childhood friend, and I didn't think I'd find it again.

These were my Aunt Margie's signature cookies and the only one I liked, until I discovered homemade Oreos.  They are still my all time favorites. Hers were always bigger, fluffier and softer.  I prefer mine harder and crunchier, but my family doesn't.  Just can't duplicate them like she made them, but they are still incredible to me.   I was so happy that the site had the recipe.  I had misplaced my copy for awhile.  These are the absolute best.

I have been making these cookies for 40 years.  Yes, the dough is a little difficult to handle and it tends to crack, but you won't find a better sugar cookie.  It is not Christmas in my daughter's house until a plate of these arrive!

These cookies turned out just perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any almond extract so just for fun put in a spoonful of Frangelico hazelnut liqueur! I made the dough and chilled it in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 2 days until I finally had a chance to roll them out with the kids.  I took the dough out to let it soften for just a few minutes and the cookies still rolled out just fine even though the dough spent extra time in the refrigerator.  For the icing, I used the Allrecipe "Sugar Cookie Icing", which was great.

I too have been using this recipe for most of my cooking lifetime. it is from Betty Crocker's Cooky Book - 1978. It has become my signature cookie since everyone loves it. QUESTION - I wanted to make it into a chocolate version and I'm not sure what adding cocoa powder would do to the consistency.

This was one of the best sugar recipes I have ever made and I have made many over the years.  The cookies are so good, no icing is really needed.  Light and crisp cookie.  Thanks so much for sharing!  This is now a regular cookie in our home.

I have been making these cookies for the past 3-4 years.  Over the years, I have tried other sugar cookie recipes and they have all proven one thing to me...don't change a good thing!!  This cookie recipe is simply the best and the hint of almond flavour gives it a little something special.

very crumbly and hard to work with... had to re-roll four or five times to cut down on the cracking. They taste great with frosting, but if you're looking for a cookie to just decorate with colored granulated sugar, keep looking.

I roll these into balls and bake. Don't even refrigerate the dough first.  Not another sugar cookie recipe on earth has this tremendous a flavor.  Hands down, this recipe is the favorite of this sugar cookie fan! My coworkers beg me for these cookies frosted with a buttercream frosting.

As a sugar cookie I rate this a 5.  For how much fun we had making and decorating, I'd give it a 10!  The recipe was easy, rolled out nicely and baked up nice and soft.  To give them even a bigger hint of almond I added almond extract to the icing I put on them.  My grown kids and I made these with 3 small children who had never decorated Christmas cookies before.  This recipe helped to make some very good memories for some very special children!

I've been making these cookies for years.  They are the family favorite for cut out cookies.  I love the vanilla/almond flavor combo.  I got the recipe from the Betty Crocker Cooky Book printed in the mid 1960's.  I add 1/2 tsp salt and leave out the baking soda and cream of tartar so they won't change shape.  I've also found it easier to divide the dough and chill it for about 15 minutes, roll each half out between sheets of parchment paper and re-chill it for about an hour.  It makes cutting out the cookies easier and you can remove the excess then bake them right on the parchment paper to prevent sticking and over browning the underside. I re-chill the excess dough and start the process again when I have time.  It's stays good for up to 3 days in the fridge.

Every year I make a different sugar cookies recipe. I think I finally found one I'll stick with. This dough was easy to work with. I made the dough on Sunday, but wasn't able to get to the baking and it kept until Thursday. Tasted a little like my Nana's cookies which I don't have a recipe for.

A wonderful recipe!  I had to make a couple changes due to food allergies at our house.  Took out the almond extract and put a bit more vanilla in and took out the egg and substituted it with a 1/4 of plain nonfat yogurt.  This is a really nice Buttery and sugary mix.  Easy to work dough. So pleased with our xmas cutouts this year!

I'm so happy to see this posted - it's from the Betty Crocker Cookie Book that my mom had way back in the 60s. I have since been able to get a copy because it's back in print, but my recipe card with this recipe is really well used and I have no intention of getting rid of it! These cookies are the ones that my family looks especially forward to...I didn't have time to do them last year and they were so disappointed! Now, even my nieces are making them for their own families, carrying on a family tradition!

This is my first departure from  our family recipe for thin cut-outs which I usually prefer. These cookies had a very nice flavor and were best not over browned. I use a baking stone and they seemed best at 7-8 minutes. This is a keeper, thanks!

Did you hear that? That was the sound of me losing my mind because these cookies were so hard to roll out. I noticed the dough seemed crumbly before I had even added the full amount of dry ingredients, so I didn't add the rest of the flour. After I had chilled it and tried to roll it out, it kept breaking apart and was really REALLY difficult to roll, even after I had let it sit out and get warm. The taste was good enough, and I liked that it used powdered sugar since that was all I had on hand yesterday, but it was so tough to get it rolled and make shapes that wouldn't fall apart that I won't be making this again.

I bake often and I was pleased to find
this easy to use recipe. I did refrigerate my dough overnight and had
no problems.  This is a tasty easy to
use and forgiving dough.  I had five
grandchildren helping with each step.
I did add extra flavoring tho I doubt
it was needed.  I will add this recipe
to my personal collection. P.S.  This
was a child friendly recipe with just
a wee bit of adult help. The wee bit
would of course depend on age too.

I took these cookies to work for Christmas. The other teachers were so impressed that they begged me to bake more (for $6 a dozen). My kids and I ended up baking over 25 dozen...a tidy sum at Christmastime.  We iced them in pretty colors using icing made with powdered sugar, food coloring, a little almond extract and milk. I put about a teaspoon of almond in 1/4 cup of milk and add it a little at a time to several bowls of sugar, squirting with coloring before I stir. Add more milk mixture or sugar to get the desired texture.

the flavor is excellent, the texture when making the dough is very good. My kids cut out several shapes with cookie cutters. While they were baking, they spread and puffed a little so it wasnt a precise shape like the cookie cutter, but it was still recognizable. We then decorated them with icing. Overall, a good tasting cookie and a good time.

As I was mixing the ingredents listed I began to fear that it would not make the amount stated (5 dozen/60 cookies).  I was correct.  It made about half that.  After I sealed it in an airtight container to chill the dough.  I left it in there for 2 hours as stated on the recipe.  When I went to get the chilled dough out of the bowl it was very hard and dry.  I worked it on the counter and brought it to room temperater.  It was MUCH easier to work with at that point.  The dough was still very dry and cracked a lot as I rolled it out.  Also, instead of greasing the baking sheets I used parchment paper (it cuts out a few calories).  That worked just find.  However, since I had to bring the dough to room temperature I also had to adjust the baking time.  6 minutes was perfect.  Once baked I was still not too happy.  There was a bland flavor to the cookies. 

After all that I have decided to use another recipe.  :(  Thanks for trying though.

Excellent cookie! These came out perfectly! I had to bake them for about 10 minutes but they came out wonderful! I split the dough in two and refrigerated it for about 1 hour and then rolled it between 2 pieces of wax paper. This technique was AWESOME! No floury mess and the dough stayed soft!

Ok, so I know I shouldn't review these until I've finished the whole recipe, but I just couldn't wait.  These barely made it into the fridge!!  I could've licked the whole bowl clean.  DELISH!!  I'll rate this again after I've finished baking them.  Thank you Mary!!!

There's so many sugar cookie recipes out there, but this is my favorite so far! Using powdered sugar instead of regular makes them positively velvety!  I found only two cons: 1) the dough is quite soft, so I usually have to work in some extra flour while I'm rolling them out, and 2)this makes a pretty delicate cookie that doesn't travel especially well--if I were making it for a potluck or something I'd probably look for a sturdier recipe. I give it five stars for flavor and texture, though!

liked the fact that these are not overly sweet on their own, so they are a great recipe to ice.  Liked the hint of almond; dough was very easy to work with and stayed firm.  Only thing I found was that this dough needs to be handled very little.  With too much handling, they can be a little tough.

I thought these were excellent!  I only chilled the dough for an hour (ran out of time), but they were perfect!  You can make them a little thick if you enjoy soft cookies or roll them out thin if you like them crispy.  I followed one reviewers advice and used a heavily-floured surface - it worked!   Enjoy!

These are OK. If your looking for puffy and soft cut-out cookies I'd keep looking. The flavor is great. Maybe I'll keep this in mind for a sandwich cookie or something!?! The dough is very hard to work with. It crumbles easily, so roll out between wax paper. I hope everyone else has better luck :)

I made these this morning and I got 2 dozen plus 4 cookies from it. Granted the size of the cutters and the thickness you roll it out to will make the count vary. I had no almond extract so I used extra vanilla (Which I love anyway) but I did find that I needed to add more liquid to turn it in to any kind of dough. I had no milk so I added about 3 or so Tablespoons of apple cider and presto! Cookie dough! I did NOT chill it as it was just right to handle right then. They baked up well in a 35o' oven. Without frosting, they have a nice flavor to go along with a hot cup of tea, but I am a frosting freak so I will frost the rest. Not bad.

These cookies were a big success with my friends. I didn't have almond extract, but as it was Halloween I put in a little Pumpkin Pie spice which made for a nice flavour. Not too sweet, but very good.

My cookies didn't keep there shape well, there were somewhat soft and dry.  I even used powdered sugar (instead of flour) to roll them out in to keep them from getting dry.  Anyway, they weren't quite the texture I was hoping for.  I did make one batch with some red food coloring for valentine heart cookies, it was real cute.

I have used this recipe since the early 70s, I just love it! I lost the it and soo glad to have found it on allrecipes.com!  I don't use the almond, but do use the vanilla flavoring. These are great made with the powedered sugar instead of the granulated for a change.
Thanks for posting these.

Hands down, this is our favorite sugar cookie recipe.  We always leave out the almond extract though.  For variety, sometimes we put one TB of orange zest in the dough.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

I made a batch yesterday and it was exactly what I was looking for. I usually make a thin crispy cut out and decorate with colored sugars. My husband was crying for a "real" cut out with frosting this year. So, I was looking for a recipe that was not too thin and crispy and that was not too thick and chewy, something right in between. This recipe completely fits the bill! After making the dough, I flattened it out with my palms and wrapped in plastic and chilled for an hour. My fridge runs super cold, so when I pulled the dough out, it was def. too hard to work with. Just cut the flattened dough in half and let it warm up a little before rolling. I had absolutely no issues with flaking, cracking or stickiness. I use a rolling cloth with a dusting of flour and use a rolling sock on my roller. Works perfectly. You do need to roll a little thicker than usual, and I only baked the cookies for about a 6 minutes. You do not want them to brown at all. I also use parchment instead of spray, I let the cookies sit for a minute to stabilize before moving to a wire rack. easy peasy, they moved perfectly. These cookies are a little crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside and taste delish!! I frosted with a standard buttercream that hardens on the surface but stays melt in your mouth inside. YUM!! I used standard size Christmas cutters and it made 60 cookies. Excellent and exactly, exactly what I was looking for!

Good recipe for taste.  Versatile as well - I can see adding other flavor extracts in place of the almond (coconut, raspberry, etc).  Once the dough chills, you do need to let it warm up slightly so that it's pliable to roll.  I cut out my cookies then put them into the freezer until just before baking so that they keep their shape better.  If you bake them when they're room temperature, they will spread out quite a bit and lose their shape.

SCORE!!!  I had stopped making sugar cookies a few years ago because I found them to be overly sweet or bland. I was cooking with children and I wanted them to cut out cookies and decorate them, so I found this to be the best rated sugar cookie recipe and decided to give it a go, not expecting to really like them. Everyone, including myself, loved them.  They are just as most reviewers said, light, crisp without being crunchy, and the hint of almond takes the taste over the top.  I followed the recipe, weighing the sugar (6 oz) and flour (10.6 oz) instead of measuring it.  I did not sift the sugar and the only change I made was to add about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients. I recommend dividing the dough in half before you put it in the refrigerator instead of waiting until you are about to roll the dough out.  This makes it easier to work quickly with the dough while it is still firm and cool.  Sugar cookies will definitely be back on my holiday baking list this Christmas, now that I've got the perfect recipe!

I used this recipe for sugar cookie cut-outs. Since the photos shows cut-outs, I thought this recipe would work well. I chilled the dough for 2 hours, as directed. The dough was extremely sticky when I tried to roll it out. Forget trying to do cut-outs with this recipe. Good tasting cookies, but recommend another recipe for cut-outs.

These were only ok (we still ate them of course, they are cookies afterall!).  But I felt like they weren't all that great by themselves and really relied on the frosting to make them yummy.

I baked the recommend 8 mins at 375 and the cookies came out quite dry. Perhaps a minute or so shorter bake time and they would have been just right. Good flavor though!

I had NEVER before baked from scratch, and after reading through many recipes and reviews, chose Mary's sugar cookies for my first experiment.  I read through a lot of the feedback, which was really helpful.  The cookies turned out PERFECTLY, and I was even making "Q" and "C" cookies for some of my loved ones.  No cracking, no real difficulty working the dough at all.  NOTE: I did roll the dough out between two sheets of waxed paper and THEN put the rolled out dough back into the fridge for a few minutes.  Cut out the cookies quickly, while the dough is still good and cold, and it was a breeze!  The taste was exactly what I was looking for, classic sugar cookie goodness.  I even passed some around to our neighbors.  Mary's sugar cookies made this no-bake girl feel like Betty Crocker.

Great cookies! I ended up adding a tiny bit of water because the dough was too dry.  I also followed another recommendation and cooked them 6 min at 350 degrees. :)

These cookies were great! I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and turn the oven temp down to 350. Also, I have to stress that when you chill the dough, you must chill for longer that 2 hours-overnight, if possible. Other than that, they were wonderful. The almond extract gave them a little something extra. I will definately make these again!

Very good cookie. I did make one minor alteration, and added about 1/4 tsp of salt to help bring up the flavors and balance out the confectioners sugar. This cookie has great texture too. Slightly crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. What a sugar cookie should be!

no thanks easy, enough to make but no thanks I do not see what all the fuss is about, the taste was very disappointing, there are much better sugar cookies recipes on here, we did frost them and it was still a bland and boring cookie, sorry I do  not like giving bad reviews.

These are my family's favorite cut-out cookie and we have been making this one for over 35 years.  If you leave your cookies uncovered they'll be crisp, if you seal them in a container they'll be soft and there even seems to be a taste difference between the two.  The icing we use is: 1 C powdered sugar, 1/4 t salt, 1/2 t vanilla, 1 1/2 T. milk or water (Give or take - don’t want it too thick but not too thin either).

I made up the dough last evening and refridgerated it in 2 batches.  Today I set the dough out to make it more workable.  I was disappointed it was slightly difficult to work.  I probably added close to 1/2+ powder sugar and flour to the dough to make it stiff enough to hold the form and to transfer it to the cookie sheet.  Normally 1/4 is fine, but these seem to spread too much and flattened out.  The taste is good, but I like fluffier cookies.  I think I'll stick with Dora's Christmas Cookies.  I do like the almond extract in the dough.  Personally it gives the cookies another dimension of taste.

These were great & easy to work with!!!!  We haven't iced them yet (working with a three year old so we'll finish them tomorrow) BUT they taste great even without icing.  I love the hint of almond flavor.  When mixing the dough, I was concerned at first.  It didn't look like it was going to form into a doughy mixture but after a couple of minutes of mixing the butter mixture finally worked its way through the flour mixture.  I like the fact that you can make them a different thickness to get a different form of cookie.  We have varied tastes in our family. Some like them soft and other like them crisp.  Even the soft ones held their form while handling them after being baked.  So, this recipe worked well for that.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make them again!

Just great!  They come out flaky and delicate - almost a cross between pie crust and cake.  Very nice flavour.  I used orange instead of almond and it was great.  Would add a pinch less baking soda and cream of tartar next time, but that's it!

These cookies are delicious - crisp and the almond extract lends a wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I just sprinkled with colored sugar since I didn't have time to frost - they are great just like that!  Not too overly sweet, but tender and crisp!
Yum!

I made these last night for my family christmas party and they tasted heavenly. They have the best flavor and just melt in your mouth. I love how this calls for powdered sugar and no granulated. It seriously gives this the best texture. I refrigerated the dough for 2 hours before rolling and cutting and had no trouble at all. they turned out beautiful!

This is truly a great recipe for sugar cookies.  I refrigerate the dough for 2-3 hours and it is so easy to work with.  The cookies are tender and taste great! I use a confectioners sugar glaze. Also, kids love to make and eat these!

This recipe is wonderful.  I have searched high and low for a no-fail sugar cookie and at last I have found it.  When I rolled out the dough I used waxed paper on top to keep the dough from sticking to the rolling pin.  Otherwise, the recipe worked great and tastes wonderful!

I just did a weekend long experiment.  My daughter and I took 3 sugar cookie recipes and by far this one here was the BEST!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The dough wasn't sticky at all, easy to work with and they are delicous!  We topped them with sugar cookie frosting (another recipe we got from this site, which was wonderful too)...this was the best sugar cookie I have ever made! They were really easy to make on the Pampered Chef stones I just got too, perfect cookies!

This is my absolute favorite recipe for sugar cookies. This is the exact recipe that I got from my mother years ago. Except we frost our cookies with a powdered sugar tinted glaze. We make them for all holidays!! Glad that it's here and hope you will try it too!!!

This has been my favorite sugar cookie recipe for many years.  It's right out of my 1988 Betty Crocker cookbook.  The hint of almond flavoring is delicious and the powdered sugar gives it a great texture. Try it!  I'm about to make a batch of Valentine cut-outs right now.  Great with frosting!

These sugars cookies are very good. I used coconut extract instead of almond extract it made them have a really great taste.

I made these for valentines day and they were great! I  divided the dough in four and kept them refrigerated  until I needed them as the dough softens up  very fast. On my cookie stone they took 9 minutes to bake.

These are amazing.  They turned out perfectly.  I'd say these are my favorite cookie I've ever made.  I don't care for chocolate!  Or cookies really.  But I bought a new "Dove" cookie cutter so I was motivated!  I sprinkled some sugar sprinkles on some of them, turned out great.

Good cookie and flavor was not too over bearing. I refrigerated the dough over night because I ran out of time to roll them out. I was afraid it was going to be too hard and dried to make a good cookie, but after it warmed a little bit I was able to roll it out. The cookie was not too soft it fell apart or to hard. I will definitely use this recipe again.

We never make any sugar cookies but these, and they always get rave reviews!  Be sure to use unsalted butter...salted butter significantly changes the taste, in my opinion, and margarine causes the cookies to be too soft and spread out too much in the oven.

I absolutely detest making sugar cookies because I just don't like dealing with the mess, but these actually turned out pretty well. The only thing that I would criticize is that they tended to get much larger than I am used to with cookies, so the shapes I had used to cut them got pretty distorted. However, they did taste awesome, which is what really counts!

This recipe was perfect- not too sweet and just tender enough to pass off as a shortbread. Note: I used self raising flour ( by mistake) and rolled between sheets of saran wrap. Veyr very forgiving dough as long as you chill thoroughly before and in between uses. This is a keeper. I made easily  120 mini christmas cookies for school. Will be making a second batch today. This will take nicely to a glaze icing and some colored sugar sprinkles.

My new favorite! The almond extract makes these cookies! I doubled the recipe and added an extra cup of flour, perfect flavor, nicely sweet. The kids *loved* the dough. I did manage to make car cookies for our derby car race tomorrow. I did refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours.

This is a really great recipe.  I have made them a few times.  The last time I used this recipe, I used it as a base for the mint chocolate chip cookies on this site from betty crocker.  I didn't want to use store bought sugar cookie dough for that recipe so I used this.  Turned out really great.

This is my all time favorite sugar cookie. I have used this recipe for years.  I roll the dough very thin when making these. They come out crispy and flaky. Sometimes I use colored sugar and other times I use frosting for these. Anyway I make them they are always a hit, with not even crumbs left on the platter!

The best rolled sugar cookie!  I substituted 2 tsp. lemon juice for the cream of tartar.  I am not fond of a strong buttery flavor so I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  I chilled the dough in the freezer for 1/2 hour and then rolled between parchment paper.  After cutting out the cookies I pressed them into colored sugar that I made from the "colored sugar" recipe on this site.  The end product was a very colorful sugar cookie that tasted great!

These cookies were perfect for making Christmas cookies with my 3 and 6 year old.  They had good flavor, if just a bit too much baking soda (of course that made them have just the right kind of crispy).  I was in a hurry and rolled them out a bit thick, which turned out to be a good choice.  Once the kids decorated them they were just sweet enough (but a tad garish :)

I picked a good one. They turned out slighty chewy yet still crisp; exactly the way I wanted. They also contain that authentic sugar cookie depth of taste, probably due to the addition of almond extract. They also brown beautifully [minus the batch I accidently overcooked; oops]. Try them.

Try rolling dough out a cloth (no lint cloth)covered with powdered sugar and putting powdered sugar on the rolling pin.  It keeps the cookies VERY soft and no need to add the granulated sugar.

This is a good sugar cookie.  The dough is very easy to work with and did not get dry or crack.  I like the faint almond taste and the cookies stayed nice and soft even when left uncovered.  The taste was not quite as sweet as I would have hoped, but this was helped with frosting!  I use the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe on this site (submitted by Kathy Brandt).  I'm still looking for that "perfect" sugar cookie, but this was certainly not a disappointment and I'm glad I made them!

The dough was hard to work with even when chilled to specifications.  I didn't have almond extract so I used coconut extract instead.  Flavour was buttery and not too sweet. Tastes better when frosted. Not one of my favourite cookie recipes.

Not my favorite choice in a recipe. The dough was fairly easy to work with with little cracking when rolling out. I felt the taste of the cookies were plain with little or no taste at all. But, not the worst either.

These are awesome!  The consistancy was great and so was the flavor.  They didn't last long enough to get frosted.  I didn't have the cream of tartar so instead of the baking soda and cream of tartar I sub'd in 1 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I now have all listed ingrediants so I'll be making another batch.  Thanks!

this recipe is okay. It takes at least a cup more flour than is listed. I would not bother to make it again.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. My 3 year old and I love to decorate these soft cookies. I have made them thin AND thick and they still turn out wonderful. Great job!

I bake every Christmas and was in the search for a new recipe. I love the texture and taste of this cookie. Between "the best rolled cookie" recipe and Mary's, I prefer this one. The only change I would do is to not include the almond extract. I plan to use this recipe for my Christmas giveaways.

I have been using this recipe for years and they always turn out perfect. My grandchildren love to decorate and eat them. This is just a wonderful recipe. Frosting with a little almond extract is a great topping for these cookies.

My preschool kids enjoyed baking these cookies.  The recipe makes nice light cookies.  The only issue I had is that the cookies can be flakey. This can be a problem if you are trying to frost them. We ended up drizzling icing over them instead. The almond extract and powdered sugar are a great change from the typical sugar cookie recipe. I'm sure we will make these again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the mixture was too dry and crumbly and could not be rolled out. Maybe another egg would have helped.

They tasted great but I had alot of sticking to the rolling pin. I ended up pushing the dough with the palm of my hand. I made the recipe twice and still had trouble rolling the dough.

These cookies were somewhat crumbly and dry. I used a simple glaze to sweeten them up, but on their own they weren't very good. I won't make them again, which surprised me because of the ratings. Very bland cookie.

I am not a novice in the cookie department but this recipe was a fail. I tried it twice. Once as is on the recipe and once using some tips from other reviewers. Both times the cookies were dry and crumbly and not very tasty. Maybe this is a recipe that should be noted as being one to use for icing? because putting the normal sugar on it wasn't enough to make them taste anything other than bland. I wanted them to be good. Especially using the almond extract (which I LOVE LOVE). Sorry to all the ones who thought this was awesome. This recipe most definitely wasn't it for me.

I'm still searching for that perfect sugar cookie for cutouts!  I was not impressed with this recipe.  The dough wasn't easy to work with, not stiff enough, the cookies didn't hold their shape once cut & came out even worse when baking.  The only good thing I can give this recipe is they do taste good.

These are good, but not all I thought they would be.  Im sure its mostly my own fault.  I think I rolled them out too thin.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and took it out about 2-3 hours before I used it.  The dough was VERY flaky and hard to work with.  I found them to be VERY bland even with the Pure Almond Extract....

I just realized I don’t think I’ve ever rated these! I’ve used this recipe for years (this exact one from this site lol) these are seriously the most amazing sugar cookies! Buttery with a hint of almond flavoring and so soft they melt in your mouth. If yours are coming out bland and tough to work with I’d double check that you didn’t miss or accidentally double an ingredient. I’ve never had to alter these to get perfect cookies!

The best! I have been using this recipe for years and it never fails. I do, however, omit most of the vanilla extract and substitute it with more almond extract - they turn out so delicious this way! Oh, and watch the baking time, it usually goes a lot faster than what is suggested!

I have been making these cookies since I found the recipe in the Betty Crocker cookbook  I received as an engagement present in 1967.  The best sugar cookies.  After refrigerating them for 2 hours I let them sit for a few minutes before rolling.  I made them last night for Valentines Day and it made 50 good size hearts.  Brought them to the bowling alley tonight and everyone loved them.  They never fail.  Love them.

Nice and easy to make, i did not add the almond extract, used all vanilla. The cook time for me was 10 minutes. I sprinkled Lavender Sugar on them. They turned out good and they freeze well.

I too have been making these cookies for over 45 years.  These are my favorite sugar cookies!  The almond extract adds a great flavor and they turn out tender, flaky and slightly crunchy.  Sometimes I frost the cookies and top with sugar sprinkles and other times I just sprinkle the cookies with sugar before baking.

This is my all time favorite sugar cookie recipe!  I first found this recipe in my old "Betty Crocker's New Dinner for Two" cookbook.  I roll them when I want cutouts.  The rest of the time  I roll them into balls, roll them in sugar and press with a fork like I do my peanut butter cookies, they look great on a cookie plate together.

This is the recipe I grew up with.  I have been making them for over 40 years.  No other sugar cookie can compare.  My parents like them thin and crispy, but I prefer them thicker and soft.  Yes, the dough is delicate, but even the broken cookies taste good.

Differences from the traditional sugar cookie: A bit lighter and flakier... not quite as cakey, if you will.

I had this recipe in my cookbook for years, but because I grew up using granulated sugar, I wouldn't use this one. A few decades later, it turns out to be my favorite recipe! Ha! (No kidding... Betty Crocker's 1991 cookbook has the exact same recipe.) 

I made one batch with butter, one with margarine, and one half butter half coconut oil. All turned out splendidly, though the margarine one seemed the best consistency. 

I did not adjust the baking time and temp. I am at 7000 feet, fyi, but leaving the cookie on the sheet afterwards ensured it finished cooking, so they were perfectly done on both the air bake sheets and regular sheets. 8 minutes was perfect even for the giant heart cookies as big as a whole sheet, and perfect for the smaller cookies too.

The cookie is so good, I actually prefer it without frosting to mask it's texture and flavor. The kids put oodles of frosting and sprinkles though, and my 12 yr old can't tell the difference between this or any of the sugar cookies we've made in the past.

I liked it a bit but when I bit into it, the amount of time they told us seemed a bit too short. Everyone else loved them so I guess it could just be me. That's why I'll rate it a 4 star recipe.

Very good cookie!  Really liked the almond flavoring.   The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because the cookies spread quite a bit while baking. After the first batch spread, I cooled pan and cookies before putting in oven.  They didn't spread as much but still a bit too much for me.  I will make these again but maybe use a tad more flour. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

These taste wonderful, and are just delightful little cookies. HOWEVER I was looking for a sugar cookie to decorate with my kids for Christmas, and these are NOT it. They don't hold their shape well at all. Also you will need a lot of flour for rolling these out. The dough is quite delicate and breaks easily.

These had the flavor I was looking for and they were more tender than my family recipe (that I'd lost). I added 1 tsp salt and twice the amount of vanilla and omitted the almond flavoring only because I was out of it. Will definitely use this recipe in the future!

I've made this several times now.  I roll it thicker than the recipe calls.  The flavor is just delicious!  Big hit at our house.  Note, it is not SUPER good at keeping its shape.  I haven't found one that will keep its shape and taste fantastic at the same time...

I had read reviews complaining about how plain the cookies are but they are actually perfect sugar cookies as the icing is so super-sweet you don't want the cookie to be. I omitted the almond extract as I don't like it but otherwise, they're great.

I have been making this sugar cookie recipe for a few years now.  It is my absolute favorite.  I give them away for Christmas to my closest friends and family and they rave about them.  I frost mine with Royal frosting and decorate with various colored sprinkles and sugars.

Instead of almond, I used anise extract.  I also added 1/4 cup of milk to the wet ingredients and 1/2 cup more flour.

I was very disappointed in the texture. - soooo dry.   I put lots of icing on them so as not to waste them but that didn't help much.   Nice almond flavor but couldn't get past the dryness.

I tried this because I was out of granulated sugar but had powdered sugar. The cookies are good. They're definitely not the best sugar cookies I've ever had. But I am partial to cookies that have a small amount of dairy in them, such as cream cheese or sour cream. They were a tiny bit difficult to roll out. I had to add a little extra flour when rolling them. I would make this again in a pinch though. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A very good basic sugar cookie for rolling and cookie cutters.  Had to omit the almond extract cause I didn't have it on hand and it still turned out good, a mild sweet cookie.

I tried a couple of different sugar cookie recipes this year. This one was really good and the dough was really easy to work with - the cookies baked really well and were easy to handle and had a good texture. The only complaint I have is that the cookies tasted a little bit bland to me.

maybe I beat the butter and sugar to much. My cookies turned out more like shortbread than sugar cookie. I wanted a softer cookie but they were harder than i expected and i did not over bake them.but i noticed about a week later after they had been sitting on my counter for a while they improved in taste and softness.

This is the recipe our family has been using for 40 years. It's not Christmas until we have at least one batch of trees, bells and stars. They're not overly sweet, but perfect once they're iced and decorated with sprinkles!

Very easy to make. Delicious with frosting from this site. My three year old daughter helped me make these and they were easy to make. She really enjoyed helping her mama use cookie cutters. To roll them out I put them between two wax papers cause they do stick to the rolling pin. All in all a great recipe!

I followed the recipe perfectly, then let it chill overnight.  The consistency of the dough didn't change at all and it was impossible to roll out and use a cookie cutter, which was what the instructions say it will do and what I needed it to do.  Not sure if it's the copious amounts of butter or some other factor, but this recipe bombed.  Try a different one and save yourself ingredients and time.  Sorry, Mary.

Cookies tasted good but dough was very hard to work with. It kept crumbling everytime you would try to roll it. Still on the hunt for a sugar cookie that tastes good and it easy to work with.

This recipe is great. I love the flavor. Although I didn't refridgerate it. I mixed it all in my stand mixer. And when it was done it was firm enough to handle but I just dropped by cookie scoop onto cookie sheet and pressed them down with the back of a spoon. I love them. Next time I will take the time to roll them out.

I baked these cookies twice at two different cookie parties and both times they came out delicious! I'm craving them now in fact! They taste like the ones from the store that are all puffy with frosting except you know what's in them. No trans fat and chemicals. They are so good I recommend them to anyone.

Nice sugar cookie recipe.  It reminds me a lot of shortcake cookies.  I accidently let it sit more than 2 hours in the fridge so I had to knead it a bit before it would roll out nice.  Once it warmed up a bit it was awesome to work with.  Even after kneading it, it still had a melt in your mouth texture. I made Jack O' Lantern Pumpkins for my grandson's kindergarten class.  They loved them!

I had never tried to make a sugar cookie before, and wanted to try out my new cookie cutters I just bought.
The dough is very dry, needs to warm up a bit before rolling out. The cooking time should say 8 to 10 minutes. The cookie description should say Soft Sugar Cookie, and the flavoring with almond and vanilla was not my favorite..I will not make this recipe again..

I followed the recipe exactly, but I omitted the almond extract.  After refrigerating for a little under 4 hours, I could not get these out of the bowl.  When they warmed up enough to move, they tore and flaked like crazy when I tried to roll them.  I desperately tried to add a little moisture, but ended up with a big crumbly mess all over my kitchen.

Classic sugar cookie.  I also tried the sugar cookie drops on this site and prefer Mary's sugar cookies.  I frosted with buttercreme frosting from this site.  I would not recommend refrigerating overnight.

I did not enjoy working with this recipe. I did not find the dough easy to work with and I did not get very many cookies from the dough. I had to switch to a different recipe.

I'm sure they would have been better if I hadn't messed around with the recipe so much, but as it was I had to half everything and ended up using cherry extract instead of almond, as well as adding a good fourth of a cup more sugar. I never needed to refrigerate the dough, but then I didn't cut them, just rolled them into balls. After cooking, I spread a bit of buttercream icing on top and they turned out pretty good!
