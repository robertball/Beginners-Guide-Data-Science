Quick, easy, and delicious! This is perfect for a simple dinner or late night snack! If you love tacos and you love pizza then this combination is for you! I used "Taco Seasoning II" from this site and Ortega's Thick and Chunky Salsa. I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef. After the "pizza" cooled a bit, I topped it with all the "taco" toppings to make it nice and pretty: shredded lettuce, chopped de-seeded tomatoes, sliced black olives, thin sliced green onion, and a few well placed dollups of sour cream and homemade guacamole!  The leftovers are phenomenal too, that is is you have any!

This is one of our favorite summer meals. To make it a little lighter (and to save a little money), I use ground chicken or turkey, I make my own taco seasoning and I use tomato juice instead of water. My family likes a thin layer of sour cream, so I spread that over the refried bean layer. Right after the meat layer, I like to add a layer of shredded lettuce and chopped roma tomatoes. For the crust, using a cooked crescent roll dough works, too. They even make the new seamless sheets especially for pizza dough-type recipes. NOTE: If you like a good cool summer meal, bake the dough for this in the early morning before it gets too hot and cool it. An hour before dinner, make your taco meat and assemble your pizza, then let it chill in the fridge until dinner. This is good hot but I'm sure you'll find that it's just as good cold, too!

Great flavors here.. I precooked the pizza crust. Added the seasoning to the meat as directed when making taco meat (reserve about Â¼ of the dry seasoning) .  Mixed the beans & remaining seasoning . When crust is cooked spread beans & top with the taco meat and cheese . Return to oven and all beans heat and cheese to melt. Then top with shredded lettuce, onions and tomatoes. Serving salsa & sour cream on the side.  There were no leftovers and everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly and topped it with lettuce, tomato, and salsa and it was great! I also used the new Pillsbury pizza dough which was better than most other dough. I'm saving this one for its simplicity and the flavor.

Soooo good!  I left off the onions because my family does not like them - but I had them on the side along with tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole.  It was perfect and the kids actually ate it!

Super yummy, and so easy for a busy weeknight. I used ready-made piazza dough in a can and it turned out great!
