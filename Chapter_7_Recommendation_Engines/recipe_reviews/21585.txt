Delicous and easy, but time consuming. Made the following changes - reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon, added 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, did not pre-cook cheeses and egg - instead added to cooled spinach and onion mixture. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the reviewer looking for suggestions on shaping triangles: I used 3 sheets of phyllo per turnover, brushing with butter between each layer.  Cut layered sheets lengthwise with a pizza cutter into long strips.  Put spinach filling at lower end of strip and fold bottom corner up over filling to side edge (at a 45 degree angle), forming a triangle - then fold triangle over to opposite edge (like folding a flag) and continue this back and forth motion.  At the end seal edges with extra melted butter. Keep extra phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out while you work.  Hope this helps!

These were really good but I altered the recipe a bit. I added a clove of garlic, substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and added 1/4 C of Parmesan. To cut the phyllo I used a pizza wheel and it worked much better than a knife, which usually tears the dough. I find spraying the phyllo with Pam is easier and faster than brushing with butter.

This recipe took some time, but was fun to make.  I had never used Phyllo dough and a friend gave me some good pointers.  Keep the dough covered with plastic wrap then a wet towel to keep it from drying out.  Only take out what you need.  I used two sheets of dough instead of one, I also cut the dough (width wise) into ~2 1/2 inch strips which made the triangles smaller.  This was a better "finger food" size for the party I made them for.  Also, doing it this way made enough to stick in the freezer for another occasion.  I think I made ~100 triangles.  I will make this recipe again.  Thank you.

This is an easy and delicious recipe!  I found
the blend of the spinach and other filling ingredients to be perfect, and the phyllo dough was no trouble to work with, as long as I kept a
damp towel over the unusued pieces.  This recipe
makes an ample amount, which I enjoyed, because I served some and was able to freeze some for another time.  Thank you for the recipe, Kathleen!
It's a winner!!!

This was the first time I used phyllo dough, what an experience.  I changed some things from this recipe.  First of all, after I created the filling I added about 50 small cooked chopped shrimp.  I also cut the phyllo dough into 3 equally sized long strips and used a tablespoonful of filling.  In addition, I used two layers of phyllo dough, buttering each layer.  I made these a couple days beforehand and froze them.  I baked at 400F for about 18 minutes.  The only thing I would do differently next time I make these is to add only 1/2 tsp of salt....otherwise this is a very very IMPRESSIVE appetizer!

These tasted great but definitely were time consuming.  I made them for a baby shower and wish I had brought more, as they were gone immediatley.  I ended up spraying the triangles with butter flavored Pam, as it was much faster and didn't change the outcome at all.

These are terrific for both fancy and casual events.  They're a bit time-consuming to make, but well worth it.  I've made these several times, and they disappear QUICKLY, so put some aside before you put them out for guests!  My sister likes to add golden raisins to the filling when she makes them, and the last time I made them I had a bit of leftover ham, which I chopped and added. The recipe is great just as it is, though - thanks, Kathleen!

This recipe is a great appetizer!  It can be used for formal dinner parties or everyday dinners.  I was very pleased with it even my first time making it.  To lower the fat content I bought Athenos reduced fat fetta cheese available at Safeway and Knudsen reduced fat cottage cheese. Even with using the lowfat ingrediants it tasted excellent!  It was delicious and it was a  huge hit with everyone I've made it for!  It's a keeper!

It took me a little longer to do this than the stated prep time.  These were really good and I will definately make them again for a special occasion.  I only used 1/2 of the dough even though I was using a measuring spoon to scoop the filling.  Next time I will only defrost that amount so I don't have to waste.

These were even better than I thought they would be.  Made a bunch for Christmas and froze them.  The hard part is trying not to eat them all before.

Great elegant crowd pleaser! I always make this for parties, and they go fast. I'm too lazy to go through the trouble of the phyllo dough, so I tried puff pastry sheets. I cut them into 2 inch wide strips and folded them as directed. The results were fabulous. The last time I made these, I used crescent dough. The individual crescent triangles were perfect for folding and flaky like puff pastry sheets but much easier to manage. You'll get the hang of folding them into triangles after a few. Don't forget to strain out the juices in the cheese-spinach mixture, so the triangles aren't soggy. Try out the crescent dough. It's ridiculously easier to deal with. Good Luck!

Brought them to a potluck and everyone asked for the recipe. I added about 1/3 cup asiago and a little more feta than suggested. I also used Olive Oil Pam instead of butter to grease the phyllo sheets. Delish!!

My husband and friends really liked these.  It is a lot of work using the phyllo dough.  I've also made the filling and put them in the phyllo dough pastry cups to save a ton of time and they were still great.

I made these for a party last weekend and they were pretty good, but not great.  I froze some extras and warmed them today as a side for some soup, and thought I'd write a quick review.  

I thought the filling was a bit bland, even after I added a couple cloves of garlic as suggested by other reviewers.  I think I would use more garlic, more feta and less cottage cheese if I were to make this again.  In addition, I wanted to mention that *squeezing* the juice from the spinach (rather than just draining it) seemed to yield filling with a nice texture.

I also wanted to give a suggestion for folding the pastry.  I used one single sheet of phyllo for each triangle, and I brushed the surface with butter and folded it lengthwise in thirds before adding about one heaping TBSP filling and folding in triangles.  The resulting pastries are probably bigger than originally intended, and it took double the filling to use up one package of phyllo.  If you want them bite size, you could cut the phyllo in half lengthwise before doing the exact same thing with 1 tsp. filling.

All-in-all not bad, but not the showstopper I had hoped for.  I think I can do better with some additional modifications to make the filling more flavorful.

I LOVE these! I used herbed feta cheese and threw in some minced garlic when cooking the onions. Like other reviews, when it comes to using phyllo dough, I reccomend covering with a wet paper towel and plastic wrap the stack not in use. For this recipe I used about three sheets and cut them into four strips with a pizza cutter. I took previous advice and sprayed some canola oil between the three sheets before using.

These are pretty good and not as time consuming as I had anticipated.  I took the following shortcuts:  Instead of cutting strips and using multiple layers of dough, I used one full phyllo sheet per triangle. I folded the sheet of dough in half lengthwise and then folded it in half lenghtwise again.  I sprayed the dough with Pam (instead of butter) before each fold.  After folding I spooned the spinach mix onto one end and folded it like a flag to achieve the triangles.  This really sped up the process.  I will make this again but next time I will add more feta cheese. The feta flavor got lost in all of the spinach.

I found the first attempt to be bland. So I tried again and mixed in a few of my own additions. I used about 6 cups of fresh spinach (rinsed, chopped and cooked in pot with no water for about 3 minutes), 1 cup of crumbled feta, 1 cup drained cottage cheese, 1 small onion finely chopped, no oil, 2 tbsp of chopped parsley, 1 1/2 tsp dried dill, 1/2 tsp salt and three beaten eggs. I mixed all ingredients together and spooned by teaspoon on buttered phyllo ( 3 sheets cut into 5 strips lengthwise) and baked on buttered pan for about 25 minutes @ 325 degrees F. They turned out wayyyy better than my first try!!!

An excellent recipe! The phyllo wasn't as hard to use or find as I thought it would be, and I used red onion instead of a regular one, and it turned out great. Everyone in my company raved about these pastries, and my boss even smacked people's hands away so he could get the last one!

This was delicious!  My husband had complained that I make too fancy of food, so I made him hot dogs & mac and cheese and made half this recipe for myself.  I was ooooing and ahhhhing about it, and saying how good the triangles were.  He kept looking at his food then at mine.  I left him the smallest one, and told him he could have it if he really wanted to try it...ya know with it being so fancy and all.  He loved it and begged me to make more.  Humph...that'll teach him!  Interesting food doesn't have to be scary! Try this recipe as finger food for company, and they'll love it too!

This are great!  I have made them several times. I do make them bite size though, I take 1 sheet of phyllo and cut it in half lengh-wise, then fold in half legnth wise buttering only the side up with salted butter.  I also double the cottage cheese.  They are so cute small and it makes plenty for a party that way!  :)

Directions were hard to follow when it came time to make the triangles. Not sure what I would have done differently. I wish there was more filling per triangle.

These were really good. I accidentally used puff pastry (woops!) instead of phyllo which I'm sure made a huge difference, but they still were tasty. I even served them cold at a tailgate party and none were left. I used some others' suggestions and threw in a handful of parmesan for some more flavor.

These were phenomenal! I just added a garlic clove or two to the mixture.  I wish I either doubled the recipe or made them smaller so that I had more to go around. Thanks!

I have made this a few times now and they are always a hit, even if I don't have cottage cheese on hand.  However, I prefer using puff pastry as opposed to phyllo.  Delicious!

This was so easy and delicious.  The spinach-cheese filling is very flavorful.  I even used puff pastry instead of phyllo dough and they still turned out great.  Another keeper!

These were soo tasty!  I loved that the spinach didn't have an overpowering taste, like it sometimes can.  The Phyllo wasn't half as hard to work with as I thought it was.

This si one of those recipes that are perfect when you are in the mood to play in the kitchen.  The phyllo can be very hard to work with, but it is well worth the effort.  I have gotten rave reviews every time I have made this recipe!  I usually only get 30 triangles out of it instead of the 36 stated in the recipe.

I'm resubmitting my review and giving this one 5 stars this time.  Working with the phyllo was time consuming but after I got into a "rhythm", I actually had fun with it.  And the outcome was wonderful!  I took these to an appetizer party last night and everyone raved about them!  The only adjustment I made this time was to use less spinach (I thought the spinach was too overpowering last time)...I used about 8 oz instead and thought it tasted perfect!

Delicious. The crispy, buttery pastry is so good! I like to add a little roasted red bell pepper to the filling. The cottage cheese helps mellow the flavor of the feta, which I am usually not very fond of.

Wow are these wonderful!  Huge hit as a Thanksgiving appetizer.  Glad I tried to start them the night before because I didn't realize I had to THAW the phyllo before making them.  Duh!  I cooked them on a stone and they turned out perfect.  Can't wait to make them again!

They were very good, but very time consuming to make.  My phyllo dough kept drying out on me.
I won't make these often, because of the time that it takes, but it is a good recipe to have.

Really tasty and easy to make.  The filo dough is kind of hard to work with, but don't let it scare you off.  I only came out with 2 out of the 20 or so I made looking anything like triangles but they all tasted yummy, regardless of shape.

These were very time consuming.  They had a pretty good flavor, feta and spinach are great together, but I'm just not sure I'll make these again. For the amount of work they just weren't spectacular to warrant it.

Delicious! Took just as long as I would have expected. Instead of cutting the phyllo sheets, I folded one sheet into thirds lengthwise, then used directions to fold the triangles.  I used spray butter instead of melted butter. Both worked perfectly! I also added a few shakes of parmasean cheese, and feta with garlic & herbs already added. Remember to flip about halfway through! I will definitely be making these again!

These turned out soooo great! The cottage cheese makes in the inside creamier - so much better! I recommend stacking 2 sheets of the buttered phyllo on top of each other, then cutting into strips, and then placing filling and folding. It helped keep everything inside and was a lot easier to work with. Make these! They are really really wow!!

So easy once you get the hang of phyllo.  Added 3 cloves garlic to spinach mixture.  Used 3 phyllo sheets buttered in btwn and  cut into 3 in strips for appetizer sized triangles.  Brushed liberally w/butter and baked at 350 for 17 min.  Remember to grease bottom of pan  or flip them halfway thru bc bottom tends to crisp before top.    Everyone loved them at the baby shower!

These were good but slightly bland.  I even added a couple cloves of garlic to the spinach mixture.  They turned out well and everyone raved about them but I felt there was just a little something missing but couldn't put my finger on it.  I found it was easier to roll them if you cut each sheet of phyllo into three lengthwise with a pizza cutter so you have three long, fairly thin, strips to work with.

My husband loves the Spinich Puffs from Dino's Gyros, so I thought I'd try my hand at making them.  These were wonderful.  I'm really puzzled by the people that said they were too bland.  They tasted wonderful to us.  We ate the whole batch between the two of us (4 left) with a Greek salad and homemade chicken gyros.  If you like spinich puffs from Greek restaurants you will not be dissappointed by these.  I was not successful in making triangles.  Some directions on how to achieve that would be great.  Mine were more like little hexagons, but they tasted great.  I pretty much ended up cutting each sheet of phyllo in half with a pizza cutter.  Then I spread each half with butter, put on a spoonful of filling and just kept rolling.  The dough kept getting holes in it and falling apart, put they still tasted good.  I will definitely make these again and I'm sure those last 4 will be gone before the end of the night.

I found this recipe very time consuming.  The spinich was too over-powering.  I recommend going to the freezer section at your grocery store and buying these already made.  They taste just as good and all you have to do is bake them for 25 minutes.  I recommend making only if you have a lot of time and patience - the phyllo dough is tricky.  It also took several tries to get the folding down.

This recipe is delish. In order to make the triangles I used 3 sheets of Phyllo with butter brushed inbetween and a little breadcrumbs. I then cut the dough into two long strips. I put the mixture at one end then folded from top corner down to make the triangle then took the bottom corner of the ne wtriangle and folded to the right. Then continued thispattern until the end. 
When making it reminded me of a childhood game of paper football, where you folded a piece of paper into a triangle as your football and someone put thier fingers up for the goal and you would flick the football over thier fingers.

SO greasy.  You absolutely HAVE to use more than a single layer of the phylo!  I did some with 1 layer and some with 2 ... the 2 layers made it flakey and good -- also they tasted less oily for some reason.
BUT the flavor was excellent all around!  I wish I could do 4 1/2 stars.

These appetizers went over great at a church function, but I could not get them to look like triangles (that's the only reason that I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5).  The taste was great and I sprayed the phyllo dough with butter-flavored cooking spray instead of brushing with the butter to cut down on calories.  I would make these again!

These are great straight from the oven, but I didn't like them as much cold/reheated. Served them when guests were over and they all commented on how good they were. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and they worked well - a little time-consuming if you're pushed for time, but they are good!

The flavors all combine together exquisitely.  With the simplicity of the recipe, I was worried it might be bland, but it turned out great!  I had a hard time figuring out how to fold them into triangles.  It didn't matter how it tried to do it though, it always came out fine.

These were really good.  I followed the recipie except used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I addes the spinach after the onions finished cooking and cooked until it wilted.

These were very tasty, but I just couldn't get them to look pretty. I'm not great with pastry, I guess. I would recommend practicing with the phyllo dough to get the hang of it but even if you can't quite get them to look right, they will taste just fine!

A *wonderful* appetizer. My husband's family grew up on casseroles, meat and potatoes...and nothing but. I served these as an appetizer at an adults-only dinner party, and they were fighting over the last one. It wasn't until afterwards that I told them there was feta in them:)

I will not be making this recipe again. I am a person who likes fairly simple foods, and this recipe didn’t even have enough zip to hold my attention. I thought it was very bland for all of the ingredients that went into it. If you decide to make it, at least add some red bell pepper.

Okay, even though I had an awful time with the phyllo dough (my 1st ever attempt) and even though my creations turned out looking like blobs instead of triangles, this recipe was awesome!  Absolutely loved them.  My husband didn't even eat the rest of dinner...he had 8 of these instead.  Will definately make again.

Rating is for taste.  5 stars delish!  Directions other wise on how many sheets to use and if we should butter in between are quite vague.  I highly doubt we only use one sheet per triangle, or the whole thing, I was confused.  I followed Jeannettes review and used 3 single phyllo sheets brushing with melted butter in between, and cut 4 strips.  This is time consuming, but well worth it and plenty cheesy as is!  YUM!!!

I also added mushrooms, garlic and nutmeg and used puff pastry to make the job easier. I cut each sheet of pastry into 4 and added the mixture and folded corner to corner to seal and make triangles. This was delicious.

Very good! One of my favorite recipes! I usually use just 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of one, and it works great! My family loves this appetizer!

we just weren't at all impressed with the flavor, and i think phyllo dough with such a liguidy filling is more truoble than it's worth. sorry.

Was just ok, made it at home, and then took to my mom's house. It needed to be warmed up, and it was just ok. I'm sure it would have been better if it was eaten right away

If you don't mind working with Phyllo, which can be a bit tricky, you are sure to love this recipe. Make lots, they dissapear quick. I always double the recipe and then freeze the ones I will not be using for future use.

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe, I agree with a past reviewer that it was fairly bland, mind you the stuffing on its own tasted good, but I just felt that it needed more ooomph.  I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.
