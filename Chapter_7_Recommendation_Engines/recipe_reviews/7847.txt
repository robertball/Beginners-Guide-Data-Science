It's a cake mix recipe people!!...Cake mix!! IF this was a home-made cake that came out TASTING like it was boxed...I would understand the comments but it is what it is...a boxed cake recipe!  Now, my cake stuck as well and I would probably suggest next time (since I am not the only victim) that after 5 minutes--remove cake from pan, place back into the pan, poke & THEN add glaze. Let cake cool.  Cake should be fine after that.  Stuck or not, I will DEFINITELY make this again! This is a nice, lemony, moist cake which is exactly what I want in my Lemon Cakes.  I added fresh lemon zest to my batter.  Please--Don't be put off by these comments about 'boxed taste'. Just be sure to use Brand Name products for best results.  For baking, that should be a habit anyway. Personally, I love & commend fellow bakers who create "Doctored' Cake mix recipes. They're quick sweet treats for picnics, potlucks or when you want to take THAT recipe a bit further with your own imagination.  I wish we would judge from that perspective.  For the 2/3/2007 review...It takes a lot of 'chutzpah' to rate someone's recipe lower because you (and you ADMIT it) "were GOING to pass it off as home-made but the taste of the mix and the pudding came through. Hence the 4 stars." (unquote) WOW! Let me say that again...WOW! Translation: "I give it low marks because I CAN'T lie that I made it home-made". Trust me people...all will be impressed you made a cake mix cake--taste this good. WOW--(again).

If you like lemon meringue pie, you'll love this cake.  I dropped the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, as previous reviewers recommended, and heated the lemonade and sugar in the microwave for a minute to totally dissolve the sugar before pouring it on the cake.  What a tangy, flavorful, simple cake!  Thanks so much.

This cake is excellent to pull out of the frig on a hot day!  I baked mine in 2 round cake pans.  I placed one on a cake plate, poked the holes & poured topping, then placed the other on top and did the same.  I combined the left over lemonade with powdered sugar and poured over the whole cake...wish I had poured some between the layers too.  I decorated it with sliced lemons.  The cake is extremely moist, beautiful, and everyone loved it.  It is going in my list of favorites!  Thank you!

This recipe is sweet.  I mean, really, really sweet.  Almost too sweet.  And I'm the girl who eats brown sugar out of the box with a spoon, so when I think something's too sweet, that's saying something.  The cake was definitely well-received - I served it with fresh strawberries, like another reviewer on this site - but I think we all felt a little dirty afterward, like we'd just eaten a meal composed entirely of Nerds dipped in pre-sweetened Kool-Aid and wrapped in Laffy Taffy.  I think that the glaze was really what sent it over-the-top.  Concentrated lemonade is already pretty sweet, so adding sugar really ups the cavity-factor.  If I make it again - which I very well might, since I love lemon anything - I might try making a glaze from lemon juice and sugar, or just using the lemonade without extra sugar.  Still, not a bad recipe.  (By the way, one of the earlier reviewers was right when they said that they could taste the mix here; with all of the pre-prepared foods involved, you won't be able to pass this off as a scratch cake.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, just something you might want to keep in mind.)

I do a lot of baking, and this is my most requested cake.  I've even had people pay me to bake them!  So simple!  Sometimes I add lemon zest to the cake batter if I want to be fancy.

Made this in a bundt pan.  I think it could have baked for 50-55 minutes.  It was very golden.  Great lemony flavor!  Used sugar-free Jello and 1/2 cup egg beaters and 2 eggs.  Was trying to cut carbs, but did use regular sugar for the glaze because I wasn't sure how Splenda would work.  Also, when spooning the glaze on, if you do it slowly it gives it a chance to soak in.  Before serving, filled the center with whole strawberries.

I made this cake for a summertime baby shower, and it was a HUGE hit!  I used Lemon icing, and it was to die for.

I just tried this recipe. Like is says, I left the cake in the pan and put the lemonade glaze on top. I let it cool completely like it said. There was no way to get the cake out of the pan without it falling apart. Yes, I did grease and flour the pan. I'm guessing the other people took the cake out of the pan and then put the glaze on top. It does taste very good though.

Excellent lemon cake. I mix the lemonade with confectioners sugar, rather than white sugar.

My husband is a minister and we are all way,s being invited to different church,s where they are holding pot luck dinners.I made this cake to bring along to one.I was a little nervous as this was the first time I had made it.My husband had the first slice and pronounced it great .(.He is a very picky )In fact he ask that I make one for Sunday ..After the dinner 4 different people ask me for the recipe.And one was a gentleman who owns a little diner in town.I made it just the way the recipe said and in a bunt ban.Some have said  the cake stuck to the pan .I sprayed the  pan with Baker,s Joy,and it came right out.I did take it out of the pan, about a hour after I took it out of the oven while it was still slightly warm..And be sure to only use 6 ounce,s of the lemonade concentrate.Most  of the concentrate,s come in 12oz cans so be carefull .I all most that mistake...Great lemon flavor...Mary Morris

Lemonade you eat and not drink! Love this cake. I always add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. You can vary the amount of glaze you use on top. IF you really want a lemon kick, save half of the lemon glaze, add powdered sugar (to your desired consistecy) and drizzle over cake.

This was a delicious cake! The only thing I was confused on was the lemonade. There ARE NO 6oz cans of lemonade in my area. But with all the talk of the sugar, I decided  to use just half the can, and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. Made the glaze nice and tangy.

But then, I second-guessed myself, and decided that they MUST be talking about the WHOLE can of lemonade, so I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the remaining 6oz, and poured that over, as well.

NOPE! 12oz is just TOO MUCH glaze for this. But it's STILL very good, and moist.

I also noted what someone else suggested, and heated the lemonade so that the sugar would dissolve into it.

I made the cake as instructed.  Only change I made was I added a glaze of lemonade and powder sugar and drizzeled it over the top.  The sauce you pour over the cake after it bakes - well the part that got on the outside of the cake was gritty when you ate it.  I did not think the cake was more moist than any other box cake.  Although it was liked by those who ate it, I feel it fell short of my expectations.

Very good, lemony cake. My whole family loved this cake...the kids said it "tastes just like lemonade". I use Baker's Joy to spray my cake pans so I did not have trouble with the cake falling apart. Also, my gang did not find it to be as super-sweet as some had said. It was just right, with a nice lemon flavor. Will make this again!

This cake is very tasty.  The recipe came out perfect needed no altering.  I was going to try to pass it off as "homemade" ; but the taste of the mix and box pudding did come through, hense the four stars-not five.

I think part of it is just a preference on taste. I like lemon and thought this sounded delicious, but to me it was almost like eating straight lemon pudding-just the flavor aspect. It turned out beautiful and I followed the directions to a "T" but our family did not enjoy at all. I needs something, but I just dont know what. I really wanted to like it too!

Absolutly an amazing cake! I made it in cupcake form for my sons first birthday and decorated them as little ducks!! What a hit!! I think that it has been made apparent that this is a box cake. Though if one does not enjoy box cakes I'm sure there is another recipe that will please you. Simply just a great cake with simply ingredance you can wip up!!

This was very moist but a bit too lemony for me.  I would try it again but maybe reduce the amount of lemonade.

This is a great recipe...very lemony, very fresh for summer baking, and EASY!!  Honestly, most of you out there will know it's from a box....but, ultimately, I believe your family and guests will love it.  This is the perfect summer time light dessert when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. My 14 year old son made this for our family and guests - everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  I did change the sugar in the icing to powered sugar. The kids think is too tart but the adults loved it.  I've also made it lemon lime (using lime jello instead) it has a odd green tint to it but they loved that one just as much if not more!

this cake was very good - nice and moist.  unfortunately it stuck to the pan when I went to flip it out so it wasn't as pretty as it could have been but it tasted good either way!  there was too much of the glaze -- i only used about half of it - it pooled around the bottom of the cake, so i let it be.    You could taste a little bit of bitterness from the pudding or the cake mix  - need to try to find a recipe that actually uses lemon.

I made this cake exactly like the recipe said.  It was delicious and my husband isn't a big cake eater.  I did spray the pan and dust it with sugar instead of flour.

Ok, here goes. I brought this to a get together tonight and it got big thumbs up all around. Having said that, this is what I did to change the recipe from the original, as I can't help myself. Tweeking recipes is too much fun. I made the cake as directed, but added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and about 1 cup of cut up strawberries. Adding pure extracts to box mixes often adds home made flavor and disguises the boxy taste you can get. To the glaze I added half of a 12oz. jar of strawberry jelly, zapped it in the micro till hot, gave it a whisk, let it cool a bit, then pored it over the cake. I reserved just enough to glaze the top when out of the pan on the serving dish. Garnish with more strawberries around the cake. I served mine with whipped cream sweetened and with vanilla extract again. Delicious. I agree with the person who said it is better to get the cake out of the pan after it cools slightly, then put it back in to you glaze, then cool completely. It does want to stick.

Turned out GREAT for me.  I baked it for only 50 minutes and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  The reviewer that said it tasted like boxed pudding didn't follow the recipe (I almost made the same mistake).  It calls for a 3 ounce box of lemon Jello, not pudding.  I'm sure that would change the taste and push it in a different direction.  I'm thinking the Jello would provide a better flavor than the pudding mix.  Thx, Patty for providing this great recipe.  I'll be making it again next summer.

First, I baked in a convection oven in the greased and floured bundt pan and have to say, the cake was done at 45 minutes. It was even slightly burned, but still came out moist and delicious. I do think it might be best with a lemon glaze made of powdered sugar and lemonade. Maybe cut the syrup part in half and use only that to soak up. I love lemon anything, so this cake was a big hit. Package taste or not, this is a big hit. I will make it again with the modifications and reduce baking time for my oven. Will report back then.

Something didn't go well for me with this recipe. It was sort of confusing whether or not I was to make the cake as it was directed on the box then add all the stuff. I also accidentally made the jello as you normally would, and the cake looked really good but turned out really bad! My dad compared it to the texture of tofu. It tasted like metal. I think I will try Lemonade Cake I in the near future.

This is very similar to a recipe I recieved from my Grandmother.  The Icing is powdered sugar 2c., and juice of two lemons mixed together. It gives it a really nice tart/ sweet flavor.  I also do it as a sheet cake.  it turns out really well.  Her recipe also has you mix the gelatin dry in with cake mix.  Its really simple and so delicious.

REFRESHING!  Such a wonderful cake on a hot summer day.  I modified the recipe by making it into a layer cake & adding Betty Crocker lemon icing after it cools completely.  It lasted about 5 minutes on the table at work.  Everyone raved about how good it was!

This is by far my favorite cake so far! I've read some comments about it tasting not right because of the box cake and pudding. Well my suggestion would be to use your own scratch recipe and stop adding pudding when the recipe CLEARLY calls for jello!!

I made this cake for my Birthday, and it is fantastic.
I also substituted splenda for the sugar and used sugarfree jello, and it still tasted great. Nobody knew.
I grated a little lemon zest into the batter.  If you use "Baker's Joy" spray, your cakes will always fall right out of the pan.  I will make this again!

I baked this cake for a dinner party. The recipe was quick and easy...just what I was looking for. I think I took it out of the pan too soon though because it stuck and fell apart...even though I used a non-stick pan and cooking spray.  I put it back together the best I could and cut it into slices.  It was a hit with my guests, none of which can tell a box cake from a scratch cake anyway.  I did heat the lemonade mixture and probably will cut the sugar next time as it was very sweet.

Taste was awesome, but mine fell. It had a canyon all the way around. I live at 4500 feet. I'm thinking I should try it again and add 1/4 cup flour to the batter.  Any ideas from the high altitude bakers?

I made my own lemonade syrup (juice of 8 lemons, 2 g plain gelatin, 1/4 C sugar, 1/2 C Splenda granular, and a 1/2 cup water - then I cooked it down to one cup of liquid).    I also used sugar free gelatin, and, instead of 3/4 C oil, I used 2 T butter and 1/2 C pumpkin puree.  I added the zest of 5 of the lemons to the batter.    The cake turned out really great!  Someone who tasted it said, "That cake tastes like summer!"

The first time and the second time, I made this cake it came out burned on the outside. I made it again and pre-heated the oven to 300 degrees. It came out perfectly and it was very moist and delicous.

I've made a recipe very similar to this before. It was my grandmother's recipe that she made often when my dad and his brothers were growing up and was a favourite of theirs. 
This is an excellent recipe--it's very sweet!

I generally don't care for lemon flavored cakes, but this was the exception.  I made it for Easter dessert and it was very tangy, sweet and delightful.  My kids and husband also loved it.  I changed absolutely nothing about this recipe.

No doubt it's very lemony.  The kids didn't like it but all the adults that tried it really enjoyed it and ate a second piece. I'll definitely make this again.
