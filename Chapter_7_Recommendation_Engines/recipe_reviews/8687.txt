OK, so my husband & I are used to the real deal, having spent time in Sierra Leone, so I kept my expectations low.  But it was Really good!!  I doubled the spices (always do), so it had a good kick.  Also used chicken broth instead of water, & added carrots, & used sweet potatoes rather than regular ones.  Otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Will definitely do it again.

oh.....my....gosh.....this was the best!!!! Like previous reviewers, I tweaked the ingredients: I added 1 carrot, 2 ribs celery, 1 can diced tomatoes, and instead of water used 2 cups chicken broth. Also I didn't have garbanzo beans so I used pinto. No natural peanut butter, so I used Jif (I did not reduce the amount). I served it over brown rice, and I am stuffed right now from eating an extra helping because it was so darn good! This is one of the best allrecipes.com recipe I have ever made.

I threw all of my ingredients in the crockpot and set it on low.  Hours later, I came home to a home filled with the most intoxicating aroma.  I decreased my broth to 1/4 cup.  Added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper to spice combo.  I also included some carrots and raisins, for a twist.  Extremely fast, easy and satisfying recipe!

Wow - was this easy and delicious!  And anything that my picky son eats, I will surely make again.  My husband couldn't stop complimenting the dish while he was eating.  I put it together just slightly differently.  I sauteed carrots, celery, and onions with sweet potatoes.  I eye-balled the peanut butter and tasted as I put it in.  I also used homemade chicken stock instead of water.  The other reviewers complained that it was spicy, yet bland, so I dredged the boneless thighs I used in a mixture of flour, cumin, ground corriander, salt & pepper before cooking in a little olive oil.  I did also let this sit for a day before serving.  Easy and delicious.  Just the way I like it!  Thanks so much for the post!

i too took the advice of others and suggest the following modifications:

1. added 1 cup of chicken broth or water
2. 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of 3/4 cup
3. 1/2 teaspoon extra red pepper flakes (if you like spicey).
4. added celery and green onions.

next time i would like to try this recipe with chicken breast as i don't really like the gamey flavor to dark meat chicken.

i was nervous to make this because of the love/hate response to this recipe, but it was very very good.  i used pork instead of chicken because i was too lazy and it was already cubed.  i did doctor a bit, using chicken broth instead of water, and adding a tbsp of brown sugar, as well as a tsp of cayenne.  i went half on the pepper and used 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and added carrots and two tomatoes.  eaten with baguette, with the winter salad from this website, and it was quite exotic and marvelous.  very stick to your ribs.  an absolute must:  topping with fresh cilantro before serving. will make again for sure.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish, although the next time we make it we'll alter it a little. I wouldn't suggest serving it to kids, unless you cut down on the spices. It was very easy and quick to make, we'll probably be having it at least once a month.

This is delicious!  If you like peanut sauce type food you will love this.  I went 1/2 on the red pepper flakes and black pepper only because we don't care for things too spicy but if you like hot go all the way!  I also used chunky peanut butter (1/2 cup).  5 star from us!

Delicious! I read the other reviews and also added an extra cup of chicken broth, and used turnips, carrots and celery. I served over brown rice with plenty of fresh cilantro. A nice cool cucumber salad or green salad is needed to "cool" it off. Look forward to having this again soon. I only made half the amount, but next time I may make it all and freeze portions. I can't think of a better meal to come home to on a cold, stormy night.

Wow. Honestly, half way through making this, I was convinced I wasn't going to like it, I couldn't imagine all of those flavors together, but it was SO SO good! Of course, I tweaked. I used chicken broth in place of water. I added one can of stewed tomatoes. I added carrots and an extra potato, also some frozen spinach. I also just sauteed the onions & garlic together, then just added everything into that pot and let it simmer for an hour & 1/2. I also omitted the red pepper flakes, since I was serving it to small children. Served it over brown rice and corn bread on the side. AMAZING! Seriously one of the best meals I've ever made. I can't wait to have left overs tomorrow!

This was yummy!! I added a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of water, and I used a couple of chicken boullion cubes too. It was DELICIOUS! Make sure you chop your potatoes nice and small so that they cook all the way through. Fresh cilantro is also REALLY good to include.

Yum!  I made this last night.  The flavor is wonderful and spicy, but I think it needs a little more liquid. EDIT - 5 years later, this is still one of my favorites.  I use cooked chicken to save time, which definitely requires additional liquid.  I also double the potatoes to eat without rice.  When I am low-carbing it, I skip the potato and rice and double or triple the chickpeas.  It's alway delicious!

I have to admit, I was a bit worried about making this after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out GREAT!  I did make a few adjustments.  I added 1 large carrot, 2 stalks celery, 1 can diced tomatoes, an extra clove of garlic and I used 3 heaping tablespoons of natural peanutbutter instead of 3/4 cup.  I also substituted 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth (from bouillon cubes) for the water and served it over brown rice.  My potato cubes were pretty large so I ended up cooking for about 30 minutes after I added the peanutbuter and garbanzo beans.  My husband and I were VERY pleased with the outcome and will definately make this again and recommend it!!!

I've never given a recipe only one star before...until now.  I even like all the ingredients!  I followed the recipe with one exception, I followed the other reviews suggestions and cut the peanut butter back.  No amount of peanut butter could make me like this dish.  It was not very good.  We are waiting on Pizza Hut right now.

Excellent!  I halved the recipe.  I used one stalk of celery, one carrot, 1/2 lg. onion, 1/2 cup chopped red pepper, one potato, and 1.5 lbs of chicken breast cut up.   I halved the spices and it was spicy enough!  Made 1/2 cup of homemade peanut butter and skipped the garbanzos altogether.  Great over rice!

I have been making this recipe for years now, just made it again 5/10/2010.  Yum!

My boyfriend's family is from Zimbabwe and I love every chance I get to try her cooking. Always flavor-able and delicious! She usually makes a spinach with peanut butter and while I don't care for it, I've come around to the flavor of it in savory food because of her cooking. So I modified this recipe and added spinach & fresh tomatoes, chicken stock, brown sugar and less peanut butter. It's soo good & I wish I knew how to make their staple food sadza to go with it!!

We LOVED this!! I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, doubled the spices and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Also, I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes. I doubled the recipe and froze half of it for another meal. It thawed beautifully and tasted wonderful!!! My husband doesn't usually like meals like this, but he LOVES this one!! It’s now become a regular meal for our family. This is super easy to make in the crock pot. I serve it over jasmine rice and top it with golden raisins and chopped peanuts.

As my baby and I enjoy the "exotic" dining experience(s), we keyed right in on this and could not have been happier with the result. What a delight! Brought what little was leftover to work and made my co-workers jealous...

I love love love this stuff. We've made it several times. I do use sweet potato instead of potato--start with fresh ones; canned are too soggy. Also, this time I added more garlic, which was pretty tasty. I hate leftovers, but I could eat this stuff three days in a row. Oh, it's good with joloff rice.

This stew was... AMAZING! I followed several suggestions. I made the soup with HOT salsa in place of the crushed tomato. I doubled the garlic, onion, spices, and added approx 2 tsp curry, 1 tsp paprika, and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. I used about 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts/thighs, dark red kidney beans instead of garbanzo beans, instead of water I used 2 cups fat free, low sodium chicken broth, and I actually used the full amount (2/3 c) or so CHRUNCHY peanut butter and thought it tasted tremendous. My husband absolutely LOVED this and he is a pretty picky eater. I had very high hopes for this and it delivered in every way possible. My hubby is actually sitting here right now telling me to add some things. He wants everybody to know that we loved this with Indian Tandoori Naan. We bought it from Trader Joe's in the Curry flavor, sprayed butter spray on it and baked in the oven until browned. This bread is wonderful to sop up the delicious flavors of the African Chicken Stew. I would give this 100 stars if I could!!!!!

This was a great recipe with some modifications.  I boiled my chicken and took the meat off the bone then used the broth instead of water and a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I used 1 large sweet potato instead of white and sliced up 3 or 4 carrots in it.  I also used black beans since that's what I had on hand.  I had about a half head of cauliflower that I chopped up and threw in.  I used regular chunky peanut butter- about 3 heaping tablespoons.  After I got it all going and tasted it, I saw what other reviewers were talking about.  I found it to be quite bland, even with all the spice!  I pretty much doubled the garlic, onion, cumin, black pepper, red pepper flakes then added curry and paprika to the mix.  It definitely made it better and the next day was great!  This is something that needs time to meld together to be a really, really good recipe.  It made alot, so I ate on it for about 3 days and was not disappointed with the left overs at all.  I will be making this again.

WoW! Our most thanks for this one! I added a bit more crushed red pepper flakes as we like HOT, otherwise no changes.  What a great filling meal!  Thank you so much for the post! We will indeed use this for years to come!  Thank you thank you!

oh... my... GOSH!  This recipe sets a whole new standard of AWFUL!  All in all, I wasted three lbs of chicken, a jar of natural PB, and money on spices I will probably never use again.  WE ABSOLUTELY *HATED* THIS!  We're on our way out to dinner now.  What a waste.

Yummy, and VERY filling with the potatoes, chick peas, peanut butter and rice!  My husband hates chick peas and my father doesn't care for peanut sauce, but both liked this recipe.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 1 cup of water, reduced the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, and increased the potato.  This helped to balance out the strong peanut taste that so many reviewers complained of. The potatoes disappeared into the sauce when diced - not sure if this was the intent, but it likely contributed to the "thickness problem" that many reviewers have mentioned.  I also found that my stew was a rather pale "I-need-help" beige, as opposed to the appealing rich brown sauce shown in the picture, but the taste was fine.  Would likely add some colorful veggies to it next time to brighten it up.  Also, I cut the pepper flakes down to 1/2 tsp for a milder flavour.  Wonderful, interesting recipe - thanks!

This dish was quite easy and fun to make!  I should mention, however, that for an inexperienced chef like myself, the "10 minute" prep time actually lasted 45 minutes by the time I'd skinned/deboned/diced my chicken, chopped my onion (which included occasional retreats to the bathroom to splash water on my eyes), and collected all the pieces of the garlic cloves I'd managed to send flying through my kitchen while crushing them.  The result was wonderful, however -- an extremely filling, thick, delightful stew that should feed me for days (no easy task)!  Was great with rice, but I also found that french bread begs to be covered with this stuff and eaten.  I know what I'm bringing to the next potluck!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I did elaborate on it and added carrots, okra and tabasco. I'm sure next time I'll add different veggies but the basic recipe is great because no matter what you throw in it's tasty!Thanks!

I loved this stew. Thick, hearty, peanutty. It's like being on an African safari, except without the $3000 trip. I didn't have any garbanzo beans so I left those out and I also added jalapenos, which spiced it up nicely.

I made this recipe for a date night, and my husband who worked in Africa for a time loved it! I added carrots as one suggested and used broth instead of water. I also used chicken breasts. I served a fresh fruit drink of coconut milk, bananna, and pineapple juice on the side. Nice meal : )

Excellent dish.  This can also be made vegetarian by increasing the potatoes and eliminating the chicken, which doesn't change the dish much at all.  We served it over saffron rice and with grilled Naan bread.  Very easy to prepare.

First of all, I just wanted to say that this is a wonderful meal! This is for nagymom below asking how to cut the fat. 32 of the 35.5 grams of it comes from the peanut butter. The good news is that with natural peanut butter, it's easy to get rid of. Just don't stir it, but pour off the fat and use the peanut butter underneath. It'll be reeaaally thick, but I think it mixes in just fine. Alternatively, you can use low-fat peanut butter, but I don't think that it tastes nearly as nice. Hope that helps!

I made this dish, and I must say that it was delicious, especially with a few changes.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic which I allowed to really cook in the stew to absorb all the flavors.  I also added only about 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I left off the garbanzo beans, and really did not feel that anything was missing.  It was perfection... a hearty meal that was hard to stop eating!!!  Love it.

This was EXCELLENT! The first time I made this I took the advise from other reviews and added celery and reduced the peanut butter a bit, but when I made it again according to the recipe it still was phenomenal! This is a great recipe because you can throw in whatever you happen to have on hand and it still turns out tasting really good.

I think most of the people who didn't like this recipe probably don't enjoy African cuisine as a whole.  My own observation are: too much peanut butter.  My in-laws are from Liberia so I'm pretty well versed in west African cooking and they NEVER use this much peanut butter.  The idea is for the peanut butter to ENHANCE the dish, not to be the main flavor.  I used a heaping tablespoon myself.  I rarely use pepper flakes, I just cut a ripe serrano pepper in half and toss it in.  We're not big fans of garbanzo beans, so we used lima beans instead.  Overall, great recipe.  I wish more West African recipes were on this site!

This recipe did not work for me, the sweet potatoes became mooshy and I had to keep adding liquid to the pot as it cooked. I was disappointed with the flavors of the dish.  Glad others had more success.  Peace.

This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars and is worth cleaning and deboning a chicken.  I used regular peanut butter and did not have coriander seeds, so i doubled the cumin.  Tastes fabulous!  I keep swatting my husband's hand because he keeps snooping!  Next time, I will add cilantro and double the recipe so I can freeze some for later!

This was an excellent dish, and easy to prepare.  I used chicken breasts instead of a roasting chicken and it worked just fine.  I pan roasted them first, seasoning with salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika.  After they finished cooking, I cut the chicken into small pieces.  My husband liked this so much, he asked me to make it again!

I modified the recipe by using 4 chicken breasts cut into pieces and also used some of the other suggestions here:  chicken broth instead of water, added a can of diced tomatoes, 2-3tbsp. peanut butter.

This Recipe was a absolute hit!! Made this dish for the first time ever on Thanksgiving day and my entire family enjoyed it!!!! I did use the advice from others and added chicken broth to thin out the sauce, and omitted the potatoes and it turned out FANTASTIC!! Will surely make again and again. Flavors are absolutely wonderful! Thanks Leah for submitting a superb recipe

Loved this!  I used my slowcooker and didn't bother to debone the chicken and added celery and cabbage to it.  I let it cook on high for 4.5 hours and it was perfect, just the right amount of soup.  Peanut butter was not overpowering at all!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  This will definitely become a family favourite!  I cut the amount of black and red pepper in half to make it milder, also I added an extra cup of water after the peanut butter was added because it got so thick.

Great dish! !   It has an asian or thai flavor.

I used half the peanut butter(which was also reduced fat) and oil to reduce fat and calories and it was still a terrific dish.

Very tasty, but I did make less servings while keeping the spices the same. Also it was very thick after adding the peanut butter, it was overly peanutty and bland. I thinned it out with a little apple juice topped with cilantro and it was amazing. Served with yellow rice.

AMAZING.  I did alter the recipe due to what I had on hand, e.g. carrots, celery, red and green pepper, sweet potato, cayenne pepper rather than red pepper flakes, and chicken broth rather than water.  I also marinated the chicken in a lemon juice marinade beforehand.  I tasted the stew after 1/2 c. peanut butter (crunchy) and decided that was enough for my personal preference.  However, the peanut butter taste seemed to mellow a bit overnight, so next time I will go ahead and add the full 3/4 cup.  My husband, who does not necessarily enjoy trying new dishes, LOVED it.  We are actually fighting over the leftovers.  I am planning to make a vegetarian version for a pitch-in at work.  Thanks for sharing!

I added a large handful of baby spinach, also celery, carrots and parsnips since I am avoiding potatoes. Next time I will use more of them because the parsnips were a nice rare bite in the stew. (I only used one carrot, one parsnip and 2 celery stalks.) I wanted to try something to "brighten" it up...oddly enough, a few packets of Taco Bell Fire sauce added some nice oomph to it.

Very good, warming, and satisfying dish. At the last minute I discovered that I didn't have ground coriander, so I used 1 tsp of curry powder instead of coriander and cumin (since curry has both). The taste was great! Used 2 cups of chicken broth, and additional 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.

Not bad - could have used a little more liquid and a little less pepper (maybe 1/2 tsp).  Thank you!

I wish there were a 1/2 star option, because 3 seems too low and 4 too high.  This was good.  Like other reviewers, I just found it bland.  I used chicken broth instead of water, added more salt than called for, added carrots, cayenne pepper, even a little brown sugar towards the end b/c it was so lacking.  But still it wasn't enough.  It was good.  It wasn't great and it seemed like it should have been.  I can't put my finger on what was missing.  I probably won't make again.

This recipe was delicious!  Served it over brown rice and enjoyed the leftovers for days!  I made a few changes: -I used 2lbs chicken breast -added about 1 cup of chopped carrots -doubled the spices: doubling the spices gave the dish a nice kick, and everything balanced very well with the peanut butter.  When I make this dish again (and I will make it again!), I will probably add more water and peanut butter to make more sauce since I found myself craving the spicey PB sauce on everything.

This was great!  I did make a few modifications - instead of a whole chicken (which we didn't have) I used 4 whole legs  (drumsticks and thighs) - had no coriander so I used cinnamon. Yams instead of potato - threw in some spinach and coconut milk.

As previous posts indicated you look at the ingredients and wonder how this will taste.  This was really good. I doubled all the spice requirements and it came out great.  I served over brown rice but you could use white no problem.  I used the chicken broth instead of water, you may want to add a little more than called for as my got a little dry at the end.  But we will add it to the list to make again.  My kids are beginning to wonder what strange recipe my Dad will make next, Garbanzo beans and peanut butter?

I made this for dinner with chicken breasts and it was delicious! My family doesn't like it spicy so I cut back on the red pepper and they loved it! I added tabasco to mine, I like it hot! What a hit!

Loved this recipe! My husband was a Peace Corps volunteer in Guinea for two years. He said this peanut sauce really brought him back to the west African cuisine he had there. I substituted sweet potato for the white, used a can of chicken broth instead of the water, and added a few handfuls of baby spinach before adding the peanut butter and garbanzo beans like another poster suggested.  DELICIOUS! Also very easy.  We will have this again for sure. Oh, and I didn't have natural peanut butter.  I just used Jif and it was fine. I served this over brown rice.  Next time I think I'll try it with naan.

This was very good.  I made it for my picky husband and he actually liked it. I think next time I may use less red pepper because it had a little too much zip.  This was very tasty and very different!

I enjoyed this recipe, and I'm making it again tonight.  If you, like me, found it a little bland even with extra spice, try adding a tablespoon or more of a good curry blend.  It did the trick for me and made it so much more flavorful!

This is delicious.  Spicy!  After reading the reviews, I also used sweet potato in place of the regular potato and added a few carrots.  Also, I didn't have any chickpeas / garbanzo beans, and can only imagine that it would be even better with them.  Can't wait to make it again.

very tasty...i substituted firm tofu for the chicken just to make it a little heart healthier, and i also added a little garam masala curry powder, which was a nice touch.  needs a bit more water (or broth) because it was a little thick and sticky.  but overall very satisfying.

I made this last night using cut up chicken breast tenders.  My husband LOVED it!  The next time I make it, I will cut the black pepper in half, as it was a little too much for me.  This will definitely be a "keeper" in this household.

Wow, it seems like you either love or hate this one. I'm on the fence however. I put everyting in a crockpot and replaced the potatoes with sweet potatoes. It didnt turn out looking as good as the picture and just from the looks of it my husband wouldnt even taste it. So, he didnt have dinner that night and I had to throw the left overs out. It's a very filling meal served with french bread or rice, and the flavor is pretty good. I just didnt think it was five starts good

This is a family favorite.  I do not use the garbanzo beans.  I usually saute in rendered bacon fat and crumble the cooked bacon on top at the end.  I also finish the dish with a light drizzle of toasted Sesame oil.

I received a vigorous nod and a "two thumbs up" from Him Indoors when I asked if I should make this recipe again.  I made a few alterations to the original design as advocated by earlier reviewers - adding more veg, using stock rather than water, tossing in some tomato passata, decreasing the amount of peanut butter - all to spectacular results.  If you're looking for a rich, spicy dish that gets on famously with red wine, look no further!

Mmmmm...definitely worthy of a five star rating.  Despite its origins, this is the perfect stick-to-your-bones meal for those harsh northeastern winters.  I added more garlic (of course) and served the leftovers over hot buttered spaghetti.  Strange, I know, but good!

This is a great dish to change up your nightly meals. It can easily be modified to your taste. I used chicken broth and less peanut butter like others suggested. Add the peanut butter a little at a time to see how much you'd like. I used Peter Pan creamy PB vs. the natural style and it was fine. I might use a little less pepper next time, but overall this has a great flavor and will definitely become a regular in my home.

Love this recipe!!!  I omitted the potatoes since I did not have any, but with the garbanzo beans I did not even miss 'em.  I also added some shrimp and 1 fresh diced tomato, and dissolved chicken bioullion in the water before adding it.  And I only used 1/2 cup of peanut buter.  Oh--and I threw in some curry powder too!  I think next time I will add some peas and more tomato---there is plenty of room for variation.  FABULOUS recipe--Easy, FAST and absolutely delicious!!!  Thanks!

This soup was "interesting", it just didn't live up to it's expectations.  I took the advice of others, used less peanut butter, added chicken stock, curry and extra veggies.  It still didn't cut it, it made a lot too.  What a waste of food.

It was very Sticky and not very smooth at all. My Husband and his friend like it a lot when they added a little tabaso sauce. I think instead of potatoes I will use turnips, to give a sweet taste. I'm going to try it one more time. I would take the suggestion to add 2 cups of chicken broth and cut the peanut butter down to 1/2 cup.

I didn't add any red pepper flakes. So, mine was only a tiny bit spicy from the curry powder. Also some toddlers from family that eat spicy are able to eat spicy foods from a young age (not mine).

--

This is a keeper for a weeknight dinner. My 2 year old son happily ate quite a lot of it.

I used cubed skinless chicken breasts and canned chicken broth instead of water like on of the other reviewers suggested. I used half a teaspoon of curry powder instead of the ground corriander because I didn't have any and none of red pepper (and I thought it was spicy enough) and only 1/2 cup of peanut butter (it looked thick enough with the 1/2 cup).

This is a fabulous recipe full of flavor.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  The garbanzo beans mellowed the spices perfectly.  I added 1 tsp. sugar and a little extra water and served it over white rice.  A bit too spicy for the kids, but my husband and I loved it.  This is a keeper, thanks Leah.

I served this for guests, and it was a HUGE hit. My kids asked for seconds, though our friends' kids barely touched it. (Mine are ages four, five and six, and theirs are 3 and 2, so age might have been a factor.) I added celery and carrots, and thought it was wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe, Leah.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I also only used half the amount of peanut butter.   Next time I make it I will add some veggies to make it more colourful.   Colorwise it doesn't look very appitizing.  But it sure it delicious.

Delicious!  The peanut butter and garbanzo beans add such a wonderful twist to the standard "Chicken w/ Rice" dish!

Wonderful! I followed the advice of others and used less peanut butter. I also doubled the amount of spices, tripled in some cases. Will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe!  Everyone I know that I've made this for has loved it and asked for it again multiple times since then.  My only change is that I use 1-2 cups of chicken broth instead of water, but I've done it with water and it's still amazing.

This is an easy recipe that our whole family loved.  My son who worked with people from West Africa said it reminded him of the dinners they had served him in their homes.

I added 2 cups of broth used left over turkey, 3 carrots, 2 celrey stalks, and I should have doubled the herbs and spice. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne. I cooked the whole thing in a dutch oven. I chopped up some broccoli and threw it on top put the lid on the oven and cooked it for 10 min. Served on brown rice and it was great.
I gave this three stars because I had to change so much in the recipe to get it tasty. A good basic recipe that you can change to suit your tastes.

This is so yummy and filling! You know that feeling you get after eating Thanksgiving dinner? This is the same. I have made it several times without changing anything. I have also made it for dinner guest and it was a huge hit! I have even had request to make it again. Some people wished it had a variety of veggies included but you can have them on the side if necessary. I did once with collar greens. So if you are experimenting or just want something new, this is it! You won't regret it! Happy Eating!

Very good! I really didn't change a thing, other than using chicken breasts and thighs rather than bothering to debone a roaster. Love the flavor of the natural peanut butter and see no need to cut the amount. As it was cooking, the peanut butter fragrance was very strong, but the flavor turned out quite balanced. I think the only thing I would make sure to do next time is season the chicken with salt and pepper before browning.

Sorry.  I'm sure the recipe is good for some but to me it tasted like peanut butter veggies.  My hubby didn't like it either.  It looked really good though.  Oh well.  I know for next time...no PB for me.  :)

I cut this recipe in half and found there was not enough liquid to keep "simmering" - all of the liquid had cooked off, so I added more which also cooked off. I didn't cook near as long as the recipe stated but everything was overdone and it turned into a big mushy mess. It was ok, but probably not something I would take the time to cook in the future.

I made this during the holidays and it was really good.  I did not have pepper flakes nor cilantro - but used paprika, chili powder and cumin. It was really good - surprisingly.  I put all the ingredients in the crockpot and let it cook all day - I did not use water, but used chicken stock instead.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it multiple times, and while I can't say I've exactly followed it each time, the basics were the same.  I have taken to adding curry powder to it... just a teaspoon or two, and it makes it into a really delicious curry dish when served over rice! Absolutely love it, will definitely make it again in the future. thanks!

Yum!  So easy...I followed the recipe pretty closely but did take others suggestions and used chicken broth in place of the water and doubled up the cumin, coriander and red pepper.  It definitely has a little kick with doubling the red pepper (not too much for me but maybe for others).  I also used boneless chicken breasts and just cut it up into large chunks.  I cut the peanutbutter back to about 1/2 cup and used cannellini beans because thats what was in my pantry. This is going in my recipe box!

I used chicken broth instead of the water.  Cooking a whole chicken and adding it is what I recommend over using chickent breast.  Absolutely a favorite!

Much to my surprise, we all loved this. I used ground red pepper rather than the flakes, as that's what I had on hand, and used a sweet potato rather than a white one. This was really tasty. We will enjoy this again. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this several times now – it is wonderful!  I use skinless boneless thighs to get the best result.  I substitute chicken broth for the water, double the spices, always use a potato and the peanut butter I have on hand.  This has become one of my husband’s favorite dishes even though he says he doesn’t like chicken! Thank you for such a great recipe!

**Add 4-6 pieces of extra dark chocolate (85%`cocoa) and you'll be pleasantly surprised the depth of flavor. Here are the other worthy notations: Used skinless bonesless thighs. Sweet Potato in place of white. Used RS Chix Both in place of water. Used chunky (SmartBalance) PB. Handful carrots. Skip the Cumin & Coriander -- replace with Garam Masala (approx 1tbl). Cinammon (approx (2tsp). Curry Powder (approx 2tsp). Paprika (approx 1tsp) 4-6 pieces extra dark chocolate at end till melted (85% cocoa). Yeah, when I see it all here in front of me I wonder if I am really rating this recipes 5-stars or my own. :-) But this recipes is more than an EXCELLENT beginning!

I really loved this dish!! Exotic flavor but still a dish most people would enjoy.  I think I added too much peanut butter- next time I would cut back and add only 2 tbs and taste. Definitely on the spicy side so you might also want to add that to taste as well.  I am making this again soon!

I made this for the Dr. I work for.  we are trying to stay away from processed foods, with super sugar and hydrogenated oils.  This was a winner.  I didn't use as much hot pepper falkes and I substitutted chili powder for cumin as I was out.  I also used a sweet potato (not white) and added some mixed vegtables.  The Dr. and my husband were very pleased

It was delicious, my husband loved it.  I agree with the previos rating to add more water, (I added 2 cups), because after you add the peanut butter it gets pretty thick.  I only used 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I will make this again.

It was my husband's turn to cook today so I asked him to try this. Made a few modifications using what we had on hand: chicken breasts, ginger instead of coriander, white beans instead of garbanzos, served over jasmine rice and topped with some sliced green onion. Our mixture was much too thick, so a cup of chicken broth at the end smoothed it out nicely. Good blend of flavors and we both liked the change of pace.

I used sweet potato instead of potato, chicken broth instead of water, and black beans instead of chickpeas. This is a great pantry recipe. I thought it was good but not great -- a nice combo of flavors and change of pace but a bit too heavy for me. My husband LOVED it, though. I'll probably make it again but not often. Very stick-to-your-ribs and flavorful. The cooking times were all right on target for me.

I found it really interesting that some people hated this recipe while others LOVED it.  We definitely LOVED it.  One thing that we had to do was add a little more water towards the end b/c it was getting a bit thick.  We will certainly make again!!

Flavors were good, but it was a thick, goopy mixture.  I only ate half of it because it was so thick (like eating a jar of peanut butter -- and I LOVE peanut butter).  Used chicken broth instead of water.  If I made it again I would add much more chicken broth to thin it out.  Good mixed with spaghetti noodles.

This recipe is very good.  I prepared it exactly as directed but varied the ingredients slightly.  I used one can of reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  Because the only natural peanut butter I had on hand was salted, and because of the salt in the broth, I left out the salt when seasoning the potatoes and onions. I was worried that it might have turned out too salty, but it was perfect.  I also added chopped carrots in with the potatoes and onions.  I think one of the best things about this dish is that you really could add many things you might have laying around your kitchen and it would still be great, maybe even better.

My Boyfriend and I lOVED this recipe however it was a bit too spicy, also I am on Weight watchers so I cut the Peanut Butter down to 1/2 cup and used 3 chicken breasts, and 1-2 extra cups of water, and added more veggies to be an 8 points a serving from the original 12. I will definitly make it again!

My family liked this recipe.  I served it with rice and it was good.  It was a little pasty, but I think it was the combo of the stew with the rice.  Next time I will omit the rice and serve it with a bread.

My husband and I thought this was awsome.  Curry and hot food lovers, I added more chilli powder and ginger too (someone else suggested that too) and instead of 1 cup of water, I added a tin of tomatos instead and "Hey Presto" it was fantastic.  As others suggested, I didn't use as much peanut paste, maybe 2-3 tlbs. I fully recommend it!! Thanks Leah, the name says it all.

Absolutely delicious! My husband loved it as well. I didn't have cumin so I used curry powder and only half the red pepper flakes as my husband can't eat a lot of hot pepper. I had to add 3 times the amount of water as my pan lid wasn't tight and we had plenty of sauce. I also used 1/3 cup of peanut butter so it didn't overpower the dish. Wonderful - a keeper!

This was ok. I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I did like the combination of spices and peanut butter. It might be good with ground pork instead of the chicken. I would probably double the amount of red pepper flakes to give it a little more of a kick. I used a can of chicken broth in place of the water.

I didn't think this was very good at all.  My kids thought it was okay and hubby said it was alright.  I don't think I'll be making it again.  To much peanut butter flavor.

Found this dish way too thick and spicy.  The peanut butter flavor is really overwhelming.  This dish is extremely dry, is something missing from the ingredients list?  Read other reviews about adding chicken broth - perhaps that is what this needed.  My husband liked it a lot but nobody else did.  Doubt I'll make it again.

Delicious!  I added green beans, bean sprouts, sliced cabbage and baby carrots, followed the recipe as printed otherwise.  This will definitely become a family favorite, although next time I'll leave out the potato, that just does not seem to fit in.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It was wonderful over rice!  Used red potatoes instead of regular and added the turnips and some raw peanuts and what a hit!  It's even better cold in flour tortillas with tomatoes and onions.  Best sandwich ever!

This recipe was great!  I used boned chicken and it was delicious.  I also used chicken broth and cayenne pepper and less peanut butter that the recipe asked for.  Next time I'll use about 1/2 a cup of peanut butter and it will still be flavorfull.  More potatoes are also recommended. Overall, it's good to try!!

Wow! Absolutely great, unique flavors - but is very, very rich. Will use more chicken broth and about half the peanut butter next time. Also I added some partially cooked diced carrots and celery in place of the beans - really great.
This recipe looked time consuming but it wasn't (used boneless chic. breast).

This recipe sounded very interesting and I was anxious to try it.  I found that the all natural peanut butter was way to overwhelming in the recipe.  It hid the flavors of the rest of the ingrediants.  If you LOVE peanut butter than you will love this.

Quick, easy, and flavorful.
I like the flexibility of it: I 
substituted chicken breasts, cayenne
pepper, and crunchy peanut butter. 
I'd make it for company.

Loved this recipe. 4 stars only because I made many of the modifications that others suggested.  These included the addition of carrots celery and some canned tomatoes. Used much less peanut butter...a good heaping tablespoon was all I needed. Next time I would double the cumin and coriander.

This was amazing!! I don't even like garbanzo beans and I loved it!! I used regular peanut butter and it still was good! i also didn't use 1 teaspoon ground coriander seed or crushed red pepper, it wasn't spicy at all! I had to add a little flower at the end to make it thicker. I also followed other peoples directions and used 2 cups of chicken broth and added corn, celery, carrots and a few extra spices of my own! i will be eating this at least 2 times a month!!

Absolutely amazing!  I have served this dish over and over with rave reviews and have been asked for the recipe time and time again.  I did add raisins and sliced carrots (for texture) and replaced the water with the same amount of chicken broth.  This is an easy and very flavorful meal that is a real family (and crowd)pleaser.

I give it 4 out of 5, only because it is an acquired taste; Not everyone likes the peanut butter flavor.  I used boneless chicken breast instead of whole chicken.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and I cut the peanut butter down to 1/2 cup.  I add a couple of carrots and 2 stalks of celery as well as a can of diced tomatoes (add tomatoes last so the beans get to soften a bit).

Fantastic!   This is one of the best things I've made in a while.  Thank you for the amazing recipe.  The spices with the peanut butter, and with the garbanzos--great combination.  I made it exactly as the recipe called as I don't know a thing about food from Sierra Leone.  I probably will add a cup of water, too, next time, just because I think I would like to have more sauce.

This is one of my favorite things to make. Its not too pretty, but the flavors blend well and its very filling. I often substitute the sweet potatoes or yams for the potato, and I have found that plain-old jiffy works just as well if you don't have natural peanut butter. My favorite way to serve it is over "Forbidden" black rice.

This recipe is similar to what I ate in Sierra Leone, though we only had sweet potatoes.  All stews like this had chopped tomatoes and sweet potato leaf.  Chopped peanuts were sprinkled on top.  Habenero-like chilies were widely available and made stews HOT!!!  Palm oil would give this a nice color but it's hard to find in the States.  Everything was cooked in iron pots over an open fire and everything was delicious!  So, that's what I did to this recipe - sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, added tomatoes, used chicken and pork (though goat would have been more authentic), the garbanzos are great, and more chilies.  I used a crock pot for about 5 hours on high.  Thanks for the memories, Leah.  It was fun making this stew!

Added carrots and celery.  I was too lazy to deal with cutting up a whole chicken, so I used chicken breasts instead.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.

This has become a family favorite.  I use less chicken, more garlic and cumin, and add a vegetable such as cauliflower when I mix in the garbanzo beans.

I followed this recipe to the letter except that I ran out of peanut butter and had to use some almond butter.

This recipe uses WAYYYYY too much peanut butter.  It dried out in the frying pan and I at least doubled the water and it was still too dry.  Also the color is a muddy brown.  I recommend adding turmeric or paprika or tomato paste to add some color.

I do think there is some potential in this recipe so I will be trying a few things to make it work.

I made this for 3 adults.  Here was their opinions.  My husbands best friend loved it and took home all the left overs.  My husband said it was "ok" and I could make it again if I wanted to for a change of pace.  I thought it was awful.  Does that reflect on the recipe?  I don't think so.  I didn't change a thing.  I thought the peanut butter was overwhelming.  Thank you Leah for giving me an opportunity to try a different blend of flavors.  Unfortunately for me this just didn't agree with my palate.

The consistency was off for me.  The flavor was a bit bland as well and I even used a chile spiced peanut butter.  It sounded like a good plan, but it didn't work for me.

I can't tell you how many years I've had this in my recipe box.. finally remembered to make this.  Very yummy as I expected it would be, I wanted to make this a one dish meal to I added in - carrots, turnips, parsnips and  during the last few minutes I added some chopped fresh spinach. I also used a powdered peanut butter product instead of the real stuff to cut calories. I served this with barley and had very filling and warming meal.

We all liked it, but it was a bit on the Peanut buttery side.  Next time we'll cut down the Peanut Butter and maybe use Chicken stock to bring the moisture content up a bit.  Very Hardy and Rich

This is a "kitchen sink" dish. Use any/every veggie u want. I included potatoes, carrots, celery, red & green peppers, scallions, roasted okra, 1/2 can stewed tomatoes, 1 Tblsp tomato paste & 1/3 jar salsa(hot). I doubled/tripled seasonings to taste. Added chicken broth & water.  When finished (doesn't take long at all), topped with fresh chopped peanuts and scallions! My family LOVES!

I like the authenticty of using a whole chicken. Seasonings and spices were good, I adjusted to taste. Using chicken broth instead of water is the right choice. All is well when cooked well. If you want to change up a recipe with subs, make your own recipe and NAME IT !

This stew was all right, not bad, but not real great either. I sampled a little right before I added the peanut butter and garbanzo beans, and I loved the flavor then...but after I added the peanut butter it just turned kind of blah for me. The peanut butter was very overpowering, so much so that I couldn't really even taste any of the other spices that I had put in it. And this is coming from someone who LOVES pb. Maybe I just don't like it in savory dishes, who knows? If I make it again I think I will add everything, but leave the pb out, and use chicken broth instead of water and make it more of a soup.

Very tasty. Since I used salted chunky peanut butter (I love peanut butter so I used extra!) and sprinkled salted crushed peanuts on top, I omitted the salt.

Super WOW!  this is most excellent!! I made this after a search on this site for a dish to make for my son's African Day at school. I tasted a small bowl before I packed it up and was so suprised! I followed the recipe exact and it is going to be a new favorite in our house! Thanks!

Very good and different. Everyone loved the flavors.  I used 1/2 cup of PB and double the chicken stock, which I used instead of water. Needs some color so I added sweet potatoes instead of white, carrots and just a handful of raisins.  Served over brown rice. Easy and tasty.  Will be making again

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... this is goood.  I can see why some didn't like it, the flavours are different and not something most would think to combine.  I was worried because there is a lot of peanut butter and it would be overwhelming, not the case at all, came off more of a thickener that strong flavour component.  Not a fan of chick peas but they were hardly noticeable.  The potatoes didn't seem to add much other than filler.  Granted I did tweak the recipe a bit, doubled the spice (just a quirk I have), half the chicken and plain breasts (it's all I had) but the rest was as is and can't imagine it being better! This will be made again, that's for sure.

I made this for the first time for my boyfriend and I and he and I both LOVED it!!!  Super easy and quick!  Like some of the other reviewers I added sweet potato, raisins and carrots.  The sauce was a little thick so I added more chicken broth.  I think next time I might go a little easier on the peanut butter.  But all in all it's an amazing recipe that I would recommend to anyone!

I tried this recipe because some people from the "Peanut Butter Chili" recipe site said it was like the "African Chicken Stew" recipe. They are nothing alike! This recipe was bland with carrots and celery... the garbanzo beans didn't really go with it. It was like eating generic peanuts. My husband thought it was okay, but he likes "Peanut Butter Chili" better, and we both agree that "Peanut Butter Chicken" was REALLY good!! Seeing other peoples reviews, and the extra ingredients they added, a can of diced tomatoes would've been a good idea. I figured that since "Peanut Butter Chicken" does that, I won't add it in this recipe, but, yeah, this recipe is bland, with fake peanuts...

I too was very skeptical about using peanut butter, but this stew was very tasty. Based on other reviews, I also doubled all the seasonings and I'm glad I did, otherwise it definitely would have been bland. I used pinto beans instead of garbonzo and also added sting beans and carrots. This will defintely be added to my list of repeats!

WOW.  This was sensational.  We almost fought over the stew.  The only changes that I made to the original recipe was to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and I reduced the amount of peanut butter to one heaping table spoon.  Because it was "natural," peanut butter, I added sugar to the skillet towards the end to account for that.  A+++++++.  Oh, and I omitted the chickpeas and added a chicken bouillion.

Very different! You can really taste the peanut butter and spices in this. I used red potatoes with the skin on, and they were really good (nice texture) in this dish.

This is a great recipe. I have made it 3 times so far and always freeze the leftovers which taste wonderful. My boyfriend doesn't like peanut butter so I looked for a way to make the sauce thick without it, I added Sweet Potato soup which comes in a box and it worked perfectly. I always add the peanut butter to my serving and I love it. He loves his without. I always add carrots to the pot, and serve with Jasmine rice and green veggies on the side, cilantro and lime are a must! Fabulous delicious recipe!

Made this last night and the whole family liked it.  Per some other reviews, I cut the peanut butter to 1/3 cup and doubled all spices except salt.  I also added some carrot.  I thought it tasted even better the next day.   Next time I make it I will increase the amount of vegetables but other than that, thought it was a great recipe.

Very delicious, everything I had hoped it would be. I did decrease the PB to about 1/2 cup and it was nicely flavored without masking the other seasonings. I used all breast meat, but in the future I think I'll use breasts and thighs for a richer chicken flavor. Thanks very much for sharing, this will go into my rotation :)

I used boneless, skinless thighs seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  I doubled the sweet potatoes and used half yams.  I also doubled the spices, added cayenne, and cut the peanut butter in half.   I served over jasmine rice and my husband absolutely loved it!

This was pretty good. I made a few changes: sweet potato instead of regular. 1 1/2 tsp each of cumin and coriander. 2 sups ck broth instead of water. 1/2 cup peanut butter. and i can diced tomatoes. I just ate this as a stew instead of eating over rice.

Absolutely awesome!  I'm not one for a lot of spice, but this was pretty good.  We couldn't find garbanzo beans at the time, but now have some and plan to make this again.  You'd never know it unless you tried it, but chicken and peanut butter flavors are an excellent compliment to each other.

This was so yummy- I read all the other reviews and took some tips.. I cup the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, used curry, cut back on the pepper and just chopped up some bonless chicken breasts.  I also added carrots and fresh green beans served it over some jasmine rice.  My husband raved over it and I am looking forward to eating the left overs at lunch.

I made this for two hungry man room-mates after they came back from a 13 hour shift at work and they LOVED it.  I used regular peanut butter and so skipped the salt and added a few more veggies.  This was a great inspiration.  Thank you!!!

Very good.  Made the following substitutions:  Used one sweet potato and one regular potato.  Also cut the PB to 1/2 cup as suggested in other reviews. May still reduce further next time.  Cut red pepper flake in 1/2 to reduce heat to taste.  Used 2 cups chicken broth instead of 1 c water and this was still too thick for my taste, I ended up adding another 1/2 c water.  Overall a good recipe. I look forward to making it again.  Excellent leftover as well.

made this with mods from other reviewers - 1/2c. peanut butter, 1 can chicken broth, 1 sweet potato...  I only used 2 chicken breasts.  I didn't have crushed red pepper, so I used 1/2 t. chili powder and 1/2 t. cayenne (totally an accident, I thought one was paprika!) so it had a kick!  I also just used a few pinches of salt, it needed a little more than that.  I think one can of garbanzos is too much.  I also added some baby carrots and green beans, which were nice.  I liked it and will be eating the leftovers, but hubby didn't say whether or not he liked it (he left a lot on his plate) so it's only getting 4 stars...

I would have given this 4 stars but my husband LOVED it.  I felt like it was missing something but as per another reviewers suggestions will try adding some curry powder next time to see if that does the trick.  It definitely needed more liquid, I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also subbed in a yam for the potato and just cubed up some boneless chicken breasts.

Mushy,dry(not enough broth?) and way too spicy.I followed recipe to a "T" except no garbanzo beans, used chicken broth and 1/2 Cup peanut butter. Will not ever make this again and I tossed it in the composter.

Loved this. Very spicy, but I only had two chicken breasts and didn't add the chickpeas or potato. Served it with rice but ate it cold later with a warmed up flour tortilla and it was even better. Thanks!

Very tasty! I did it in the crockpot and per other reviews subbed sweet pot. Next time i will add the sweet taters closer to the end b/c they dissolved. Oops! Everybody had seconds and hubby had thirds. Forgot to put the beans in but did add green beans, peas and corn.Anything to get veg into my 2 yr old.  Will definitely make again. Very comforting stew.

This is a very tasty dish but I disagree that it lacks spice.  I wasn't sure about adding a teaspoon of pepper and would halve it next time since the dish is very peppery.  I also only added half a cup of peanut butter and used a sweet potato in place of the potato.  Very satisfying and yummy.

This is a delicious dish, made subtly different than standard by the peanut butter addition. Will make again, as husband and South African neighbors loved it.

I'm giving this three stars because I think the recipe has some potential.  I made the changes some reviewers suggested such as chicken stock instead of water and using sweet potatoes in place of white.  I also sauteed the onions first in quite a bit of olive oil then did the chicken.  The recipe smelled good but none of us really liked it.  I also added quite a bit of paprika to the sauteed chicken.  

Next time I will add some coconut milk, sauteed fresh ginger, and top or sautee green onions.  I think that will help the blandness and make for a smoother consistency.

This recipe went over well in our house.  I followed other's suggestions, only used 2/3 c. of peanut butter and I added more chicken stock towards the end of cooking.  I added carrots to the stew and served over jasmine rice with a side of broccoli.  I'll make again, perhaps with dark meat (I used breasts in this recipe) next time for some added flavor.

This was not very good. I followed the recipe except I used cut up chicken breasts instead of a roasting chicken. I boyfriend thought it was 'ok' (as he hadn't eaten all day befor dinner) but I couldn't even stomach it.  I would recommend adding a lot of salt/extra seasoning and cooking the potatoes half way through before adding them to the pan. I had to cook it a lot longer to get the potatoes soft, so the chicken got a little over done/dry. I also had to add a lot more water so it wouldn't get dry.  I think the peanut taste was a little overwhelming... not sure how to fix that.  The leftovers ended up in the trash, which is a rare thing in my home!

Great taste with a kick! I reduced the red pepper to 1/2 for fear it might be too hot, and substituted diced sweet potato for the large potato. Awsome and different tasting. Will make again soon.

My husband and I liked this.  If you're into thick pasty sauce type stews, this is for you.  (The natural peanut butter really thickened this up).
I only had one small red potato so I diced that up and also added lots of celery and carrots.  Added more spices to compensate including garlic powder, and curry powder.  I think any kind of beans would work with this.  I used one can of pinto beans drained and rinsed.  Substituted a can of chicken broth for the water like others suggested.
Great easy and quick way to use up chicken breasts.

I've made this recipe several times, and everyone who has tasted it adores it.  I'm a little more liberal with the spices because my family seems to like it with a little more of a kick.  Will keep in my favorite recipes folder.

Wow! This recipe was amazing!  I improvised and used Jiffy extra crunchy peanut butter and I loved the taste.  1/2 the recipe was enough for me to have dinner last night and lunch today.  I like how well this recipe works reheated.  Will definately make this again!

I thought this was ok.  It left a very "pasty" film in my mouth, I'm sure from the peanut butter.  Also, it was pretty spicy.  I don't know how in the world the other reviewer's 2-year-old ate it!

I made this recipe tonight and followed it exactly.  After tasting the final product I made a few adjustments.  I added chicken broth to thin it out.  Then, I added dark brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit (not sure how much I used, probably about 2 or 3 tbsp).  That really improved the flavor...not too sweet, but it really enhanced it. It also darkened the sauce up a bit which made it more appetizing. I topped it with chopped peanuts and cilantro.  Overall a very good dish, but it needs a little more tweaking...next time, I may add some stewed tomatoes as well as other vegetables.

Wow this is a fabulous recipe!  I used chicken broth instead of water and I substituted yam for the potato.  It still turned out nicely.  The garbanzo beans add a nice touch.

This recipe is great!  Although next time I think I'll try thinning out the sauce a little.  It was just a little too peanut buttery.

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite -- it is a great recipe because it uses ingredients I like to keep around, it is flexible (tonite I added cabbage and left out garbanzos) and every member in my somewhat picky family enjoys it!

Excellent recipe. I wouldn't make this on a weekly basis, but a very interesting combo of flavors. Try chunky, non-salted PB for some added texture.

on a scale from 1 to 10, my family gave this recipe a 11. It is simply wonderful, one of the best stews I have ever cooked. I added more broth to the recipe as we like sauce when this is served over rice. Definetly a recipe to die for.

Very exceptional recipe! I have very little experience in cooking these kind of dishes which involve a large variation of spice. But I was pleased to see that all the steps and preparation were easy. I used chicken broth in place of water and added cayenne pepper as well as lemon pepper. I also decided to use vegetables including celery, carrots, corn,cabbage, and mushrooms. Great for dinner with the family. (Dont be afraid to make this if you don't like peanut butter like me. You can barely taste it in the dish through the spices.)

This was fantastic!  We loved it with a loaf of good Italian bread and a simple salad.  
I used chicken broth in place of the water.  Added 2 large carrots and 2 stalks of celery.  I didn't have coriander seed, so I substituted a scant 1/4 tsp of caraway seed, a heaping 1/4 tsp of fennel seed, ground together in a mortar and pestle, and a 1/2 tsp of dried thyme.
I will make this again and again!

I used frozen chicken that I had slow-cooked earlier in a crock pot. This cut down on the fat. It also meant that it was drier, so I used 3 - 4 cups of chicken broth (also frozen from the same crock pot chicken). I also didn't use oil. Next time I will not add potatoes and will add celery.

I picked out this dish to push the limits on what my husband would eat. His verdict: "This is the second best dinner you have ever made for me." I loved it too. Here's my twist on the recipe: 4 cloves of garlic (not 2), 2 chopped carrots, 1 1/2 stalks of celery (chopped), 1 can (28 oz) of diced tomatoes, 2 cups of chicken stock (instead of 1 cup of water), 1 tbsp of all the spices (instead of 1 tsp) and 1 cup peanut butter. Because there was more stuff, it took a bit longer to cook. I served it over jasmine rice. Loved it and will be serving it again soon!

Could not find garbanzo beans, so used black beans instead. Overall taste was very very good. I cooked this in a crock pot after spending 20 minutes to brown the chicken. I'm not sure if the crockpot is what gave the chicken dryness, but next time, I will add more chicken broth to ensure more of a soupy texture. Will make again. Thank you.

I made this with a good friend of mine for a group of 7. We've been all trying to add new recipes into the mix to keep things interesting...was easy to make and EVERYONE LOVED IT...even my two picky little boy eaters. 7 thumbs up over here. We even added a can of diced tomatoes and green onions for color...and a can of coconut milk for extra liquid. This one is a keeper for sure!

Incredible! Like most that reviewed this recipe, I used chicken broth instead and I added a little more coriander and cumin. Other than that, I used only what it required. It was very very good! Perfect amount of spicy heat! I love spice though, for those sensitive to it, you may want to lower it a little.

This is AMAZING. I made a few adjustments, but kept the basic flavors the same, and it was out of this world! My adjustments: used about 2 pounds of cut up chicken thighs instead of the whole fryer, and used the fat rendered off the chicken instead of olive oil. I also had broccoli and carrots lying around so I threw them in at the same time as the potatoes. Since I had so much more "stuff" I used a tablespoon of each spice instead of a teaspoon, and ended up adding 4 cups of weak chicken broth and 1 1/4 cup peanut butter.  My sauce did end up pretty runny so maybe 3 cups broth and 1 cup PB would have been better.  It came out with a perfect blend of savory, spicy and sweet flavors.  This will definitely be a go-to meal when I have veggies I need to use up and want to make something a little different.

I only used 1/2 cup of peanut butter, but I also used 1/4 of chopped peanuts. I kept the spices the same.

I qualify my review by stating that I LOVE Thai and Indian food so I think this recipe is great for a very flavorful and different meal. I'm wondering what type of GREEN vegetable I could add that would enhance it while making it a complete meal.  FYI I thought I had coriander but didn't and it's great anyway!

Changes: I used 3 lbs of chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken, added 2 sliced carrots at the same time as the onion and potatoes, and used an extra half teaspoon of cumin and a squeeze of lime instead of the coriander because I didn't have any. I found it needed just a little extra pop: I topped it with fresh cilantro and just a touch more salt. It also was a bit too peanutty, and I think I will cut the peanut butter to half a cup next time like others. We didn't feel that the potatoes added anything in this, and next time I'm going to omit them or use a sweet potato instead and some diced red bell pepper, and keep the carrot.  My bf liked it over brown rice, but personally I found it a bit starchy that way and I think I will serve it over steamed spinach next time. Don't misunderstand me: it's a lovely rich, creamy, luxurious dish and I very much enjoyed it, but for me I think a little bite of the spinach will make it a little more balanced and make the creaminess even more enjoyable.

It was a really good dish. Quite a bit spicier than I expected, so be prepared. Would be even better over rice or couscous, would help kill some of the heat too.

Great flavor! Husband raved! I didnt have garbonzo beans, substituted a can of fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic. I increased the heat a little as suggested by others with a pinch of cayenne and a bit more pepper flakes. Only had storebrand peanut butter, very chunky, and it was great! try this recipe!!

This recipe was not bad, and definitely inspired me.  However, with the spices as listed, it's too bland for my taste.  I added more of everything, plus a little ginger.  I also added a carrot and a can of chopped tomatoes, and substituted vegetable broth for the water, adding a little extra as per reader recommendations.  I used standard, processed PB since I can't get the natural variety.  It still seemed to lack something, though.  I think a cilantro garnish would make a big difference, but I didn't have any.  I'll see how it tastes after it's sat for a while.

Loved this recipe, flavor is incredible.  I added different veggies, but I stayed true to the spices.  I agree with some, appearance wise it is lacking, but add some colorful veggies and it perks up.  If you like cumin and coriander, you will love this.

I followed the recipe with the only exception of substituting chicken broth for water like some of the reviewers had suggested and adding some carrots.  It was very good and quite filling.  Someone made the statement that this recipe "sticks to your bones".  SOOOO TRUE! This was a good dinner recipe to make for a chilly night.  Next time I make it, I will make it the same way but also add red peppers, take the spices up just a notch and add some unsalted peanuts for crunch.  This one's a keeper.

I had poached left-over chicken from another recipe that I wanted to use in something other than the "same old, same old" dishes.  This looked very intriguing.  Other than having the cooked chicken on hand, I also had one sweet potato and a bit of okra to use up, so they went into the stew, too.  Otherwise, I followed the directions.  The spice blend was delicious -- with a kick, but not overpowering.  I received rave reviews from my family and our dinner guest.  They all claimed this is a real "keeper" recipe and urged me to make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

Pretty good recipe, although, I added a little extra salt and seasoning, and used chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I used chicken drumsticks which is what I had on hand.  Garnish with crushed peanuts and green onion slices.  thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a small can of tomatoes (plain crushed were all I had) and a touch of cinnamon.  It was coming out too thick so I added more chicken stock. The original recipe seasonings were a wonderful combination.  I added only enough salt to taste and we served it over brown rice topped with chopped peanuts. We will be offering this to my family's table at Christmastime this year.

Made this for dinner tonight. The boyfriend and I thought it was edible but not the best. It won't be on my dinner rotation as peanut butter is quite expensive where I live and the recipe did not knock our socks off. The changes I made: 4 small chicken breasts, chicken stock instead of water, cayenne pepper instead of the listed pepper seasonings, added fresh tomato and cilantro and a 5 spice seasoning to beef up the flavor. Served with jasmine rice and fresh basil. If I ever made this again, I would add a lot more seasoning and eliminate the potato as this really did nothing for the recipe. It made it kind of taste like mushy flour.. but I didn't add any flour. The texture was great - not too thick and not too wet.

We absolutely love this stew! I have made it 4 times in the last 2 months, each time it gets better! My bf eats a lot, so I add carrots and more of everything. Chicken stock and water, and pretty much the same amount of seasonings. I love the peanut butter and the chickpeas. IT IS SENSATIONAL! Thank you!!!

Not bad, but it is a bit spicy.  I wasn't sure about the teaspoon of red pepper but thought that the reviews indicated that perhaps I should just go for it.  I should've trusted my instincts.  It's just a bit more spicy than we like.  However, it's pretty easy and good.  I made it in the crock pot and used 1 can of chicken broth, which I believe works out to two cups.  I didn't add the onion but added extra garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the seasonings, and double the garlic and added ginger and added a carrot and two salks of celery. I also replaced the potato with a sweet potato. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and used a tad less natural peanut butter. I added cilantro a garnish. We really enjoyed it over brown rice. I would note however that prep time listed is WAAAAYYYY to low for deboning a chicken..

Excellent! I just finished cooking this and had a taste test...yummy! So, some things I did differently: -Added one heaping tbsp of peanut butter only. -used chicken stock instead of water, needed about 2 cups. -used 3 chicken breasts instead of a chicken. -put a couple of carrots, some spinach and peas into it.  What flavour. I am super impressed. Definetely a keeper, and not too exotic-crazy tasting..just right.  Tahnks for sharing.

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe based on the hit-and-miss reviews, but I thought it was great. I did make some changes: substituted chicken broth for water, omitted red pepper (since my kids don't like heat), added the peanut butter to taste (which ended up being about 2/3 c.), and added 3/4 c. carrots and 2 ribs of celery to the saute pan. I ate it over rice, but found that it is so thick that it will work better all by itself as a 1-pot stew. It got rave reviews from the whole family and I suspect it will become a regular item in our house. Well done.

Very "Stick to your ribs" good. I found the amount of peanut butter just fine. I left out the red pepper because i have a 2 year old and the result was a very mild yet filling meal. I did make some stock from the bones of the chicken and then used in place of the water. Also served over brown rice.  ps. peanut butter and garbanzo beans are a surprisingly delicious combination!!

This recipe should have come with a 4 alarm disclaimer! I used boneless chicken breasts, added a scallion and some sugar snap peas I had sitting in the fridge, and used chicken stock in place of the water. The group of friends I made it for all loved it, as did my husband. Terrific!

This recipe was not very good. The texture was strange and the taste could have used something fruity to balance it out. It was one of the worst recipes I have made from this website.

I was super excited to try it because it sounds fantastic. All was well until I added the peanut butter. I think it is just too much, and the garbanzo beans didn't help with the texture or taste. I love coriander seed, but it was just too much. I did not care for it at all!

This was  so good.  Will definitely make this again.  I did as another user suggested, and added carrots and celery, mostly for color.  Also added a bit of tumeric for color. Loved this!!

My husband and I didn't like this too much.  The peanut butter was overwhelming and the texture was too mushy.  I used regular potatoes...but I think I should have followed other reviewers who used sweet potatoes.  This one just wasn't for us.

I can't believe my husband, the pickiest eater ever, ate this and said he would eat it again (with a few changes of course). This rating is fully from his review. He said if I were to omit the beans and potatoes (used sweat potatoes) and add tomatoes it would be atleast a 4.5. Let me tell you that this man is conservative and this all came from his mouth. My side: I added celery, a whole can of chicken broth + about a cup of water because I used a whole sweet potato, 18 chicken tenders, and 2 onions. I used generous!!! measurements for the seasonings and upped the garlic. Wish I would have cut back on the suggested peanut butter a bit, did only add half the beans. One tip, it is the coriander that compliments the peanut butter. It is really important to grind this up well if you want uniform flavor, I didn't, just toasted and crushed them, so I added parsley to bring out the coriander flavor. This helped a lot. Definitely a well made recipe I must say. Will make again to please my husband. :)

This is a fantastic recipe and my whole family loved it!!  I am allergic to potatoes and peanuts, so I omitted the potato and used almond butter instead of peanut butter.  I served it with spinach and over wild rice.  This is definitely going into the recipe rotation at our house!

I prepared this recipe last night for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I added 3 heaping tablespoons of pb and omitted the garbanzo beans but added baby carrots instead,omitted the potato and added sweet potatoes and doubled the onions. It was wonderful!  I didn't taste the pb but it fused with the chicken broth to make a very tasty dish.  I will make this often.

This tasted amazing! I never measure anything, but I definitely added quite a lot of crushed chilies, and added a fair amount of curry powder. Didn't have any cumin, so omitted that. Used yams instead of potato, and added celery. Also put in some salsa. Used about 1/2c crunchy peanut butter. Excellent recipe!

very good! i quintupled the spices (i usually do...), added some cayenne, carrots, and a little fresh cilantro in the last few minutes of simmering. it was nice and spicy, just the way my boyfriend and i like it! served with a green salad and French baguette, but i think next time i'll use some sort of flat bread instead. we love Ethiopian food, but this was my first attempt at any African dish. it was a delicious addition to my culinary repertoire! thanks, and if you're on the fence about trying it... don't be scared! it's wonderful!

i made the recipe as it stands and there is too much peanut butter in it for me so I tinkered with it adding curry powder, more cumin, chicken stock cube, carrots and other mixed veg to bulk it out as I added more water to blend out the taste of peanut butter.  I will give it another go as I always to as it may have been just my cooking!

Mmm.  A nice change.  I did make some changes.  I used plain and sweet potato, carrots, onion, and eggplant.  I cooked the plain potato, onion, and carrots till half done before adding sweet potato and added eggplant last.  Then i added chicken broth and spices.  I did not have corriander seed so I used tumeric pwd.  I also reduced the peanut butter to 1/3c.  Next time I will reduce to a 1/4 c.  I think any more than that is overpowering and creates the bland taste.  I also added peanuts.  Great healthy recipe, when PB is reduced.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband took one bite and said he'd eat it again.  That is high praise!  I used boneless chicken breast cut into bite sized pieces, and added cayenne, curry powder, and some canned red jalapenos that I had frozen---we love the heat!  Delicious, thank you for the post.

Sadly, I didn't care for this too much.  my son said 'no way'! so i added all the spice this calls for and more. also used yam instead of potato.  Could it be that I didn't care for this because I didn't have natural style pnut butter so i used tahini and a TBS of regular pnut butter??  probably won't make this again.  just a little too unusual for me.

Wow, I haven't had a response to a recipe like this since I made my first Pasta All'Arrabiata!  Like a lot of cooks, I have to change it a *little*, so I used a home-raised chicken (not noted for tenderness and stewed it for a couple of hours in the crock pot), and I also added a couple of handfuls of fresh baby spinach, and stirred it enough to wilt the spinach, before I added the peanut butter and beans.  My husband made me promise to cook this at least once a month.  Talk about your comfort food...but next time I may cut back a little on the peanut butter to lower the fat content a little.  The flavor was great, but I might sacrifice a little.

Personally I liked it, however my Indian father hated it. And I thought he'd like the spice combo. I followed the base recipe, but also added green peppers and cautiously added a diced tomato. The tomato went great with the stew, next time I'll add more, and perhaps some fresh green beans like in Filipino Kare-Kare. More vegetables makes this much more flavorful.

Yum Yum!  I used turkey thigh (very cheap here in Great Britain) and double the quantity of potatoes (I used sweet potatoes).  I also added a yellow capiscum and some celery.  I used the full amount of peanut butter (unsalted) and doubled the coriander and cumin.  I served it with brown rice.  I will be making this again next week.

I've gotten many compliments every time I've made this.  It's great for occasions when I want to impress someone.  Make sure your spices are fresh.  Once I used some powdered cumin that had been on the shelf for years and it came out really bland.

This is absolutely the best!  I tried once before with regular peanut butter and it was bad, but this time witht he natural peanut butter it was great.  My 11 y/o is asking me to make another pot.  I didn't add anything to it and I didn't have any coriander but it was still delicious.

This recipe was a little bland, but we didn't have the corriander so that may be why.  It was also a little thicker than I expected.  We took another reviewer's suggestion and stirred in some pesto, and that was a great addition.  I will probably make again, because it had an interesting assortment of flavors, but I will make sure to get the corriander!

I really liked this a lot because you can tweak it to your taste.  I added a little red wine vinegar and sugar which went well with the heat from the spices.  Added more potatoes, as they absorb the flavor of the sauce and were really good, added water chestnuts for the same reason.  I also liked it better with pork than chicken, as I thought the chicken was kind of dry.  My 3 teenagers LOVED it, highest marks.

I really enjoy this recipe, and I make it all the time, now.  It's only turned out badly for me once, and that was the time I steamed chicken legs instead of frying them, first.  When I precooked the chicken this way, the dish came out too watery.

I have also experimented with the recipe, and have used sweet potatos and carrots in lieu of the potato.  It turned out well, but I prefer regular potatos.

The stew also went over very well at a potluck dinner, and I had requests for the recipe.

This is an overall good recipe. However, be sure to be generous with the seasonings. I think the recipe could use more salt. Be careful not to let the mixture stick to the skillet (peanut butter sticks easily). This was an overall good recipe. I would suggest it.

I added potatoes and it made the recipe bland and a bit mushy.  I think I'll try it again without any potatoes at all and serve it on rice.  Kids wouldn't touch it, but my husband really liked it.

I was hoping this would be better.  I agree with the other reviews that the peanut butter is over-powering.  The amount of pepper in this makes it very hot, so you might want to leave out the red pepper until right before serving so you can judge the amount.  I would recommend this dish if you omit the peanut-butter.  The chicken is very tender.  Serve over saffron rice.

I added more potatoes, so I didn't have to serve it over anything.  Delicious all by itself.  My boyfriend didn't like the peanut butter, though.

I made this and I couldn't get any flavor!  I think maybe the peanut butter dulled it out?  I ended up using triple  the spices recommended and it was still blah.  I added some store bought Curry (a couple tablespoons).  I cooked it in my crock pot for a couple hours on high and it was very thick and gloppy.   Definitely not pretty food,  not appetizing to look at.  I will try as leftovers today, hopefully it will improve.

We doubled the spices and it was still bland. We spent most of the meal trying to figure out what would save it. My vote was for either vinegar or a vinegar-based hot sauce, hubby's vote was for a ton of vegetables. We didn't throw it away or anything, but I don't think we'll make this one again, sorry.

I make this a bunch for my boys. I do sneak in minced carrots and celery for vegetables. The combination of chicken, garbanzo beans and peanut butter seems strange, but it is soooooooooo good!!! It is also a perfect weeknight quick meal. Try it!

It was ok. It was kind of plain. I added chicken broth, and diced tomatoes, per recommendations. 

I recommend adding extra red pepper

Dang this is good.  I have made this a few times and everyone who has tried this dish likes it.  I have found that you don't need to follow the recipe exactly and can add or substitute ingredients based on taste or what you have available.  I would give it five stars for taste, however this dish does not look appetizing, and this has prevented some friends from even trying it.

This is in the regular rotation for me. I like it with sweet potatoes, and don't measure the peanut butter, just throw in a big heaping dollop.  When I'm lazy, garam masala hits a lot of the right spice notes in one go, although I still add cumin too.  

I generally top it with some combination of lime juice, cilantro, and yogurt to cut the richness and get some sour in there. Also freezes great.

Made in slow cooker.  I used sweet potato and mixed the peanut butter with chicken stock instead of water and added to the pot.  It turned out great. RH

I followed the recipe as-was with only two exceptions: chicken stock for the water and regular peanut butter instead of unsalted. I thought the slight sweetness of the peanut butter added a nice contrast to the spiciness of the dish. Ate the whole serving. Yum.

Really enjoyed this one, both to cook and eat. I used 500g of chicken breasts, and then added okra and celery to the onion/garlic/potato mix. I also added some tomatoes when the chickpeas went in, but they didn't do much (wouldn't do it again). Next time will definitely add some more spice to it.

I loved this recipe! The mix of sweet and spicy is amazing. I didn't add the potato and tasted just as good. Also added a little sugar to calm the spice down. Served over rice! Will be making again very soon.

This dish is absolutely amazing! Sorry for the ones who did not get the result they wanted, it`s just a matter of regulating the ingredientes according your taste! I use fresh chicken breasts, chicken broth instead water, I also added the carrots, and the fresh coriander on top to serve, and what can I say??? Thanks Leah!!!  This is definitely delicious! Yummy!

Great recipe! Used sweet potato instead of regular.  Reduced peanut butter as other reviewers suggested but I ended up adding more because the peanut flavor wasn't strong enough for our tastes.

I personally didnt get to eat any of this as I was sick, so Im reviewing for my DH. I used chicken broth instead of water.  I ended up having to use about 20oz so the dish wouldnt be too dry.  It definitely wasnt visually appealing to us, it looked quite nasty LOL! DH said it was just OK, definitely wouldnt be something he would ask me to make again.

3.5 stars.  I followed all the other advice: added carrots, celery, green onions, used chicken stock and halved the red pepper and black pepper.  Used 3/4 cup pb.  I still thought it was bland.  So I added the rest of the spices and more cumin.  It was still just ok.  My picky step-son liked it, but I htink that is b/c it didn't have a distinct taste, unlike the curry's I've made lately that he doesn't like.

I made this, and possibly made a mistake by not using natural peanut butter but just regular peanut butter. I thought it tasted delicious...but my family did not agree. If your diners don't enjoy a touch of sweet with their meat, I'd recommend using an unsweetened peanut butter (which it says in the recipe anyway!). But a good, easy dish to make and very warming on a cool day.

We loved this!  Just a note--watch the pepper.  I love hot and spicy, but used a couple twists of black pepper and just a tad over 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  I used chicken stock instead of water and next time will use less peanut butter--mostly to save a few calories. I think 1/2 cup would be enough.

Really good and hearty on cold day!! Like other suggestion, used chicken broth instead of water, less peanut butter (1/2) cup crunchy (a little less thick) but tasty.  Added carrots and celery and cooked with onion and potatoes.  YUM

I really liked this recipe. I double or triple the spices plus add in some curry. I added 2 carrots, 2 celery ribs, a can of diced tomatoes. I also used sweet potatoe and chicken broth instead. I'm still afraid to add the suggested amount of peanut butter. I first did it with a heaping tablespoon then with two. Will try with full amount next time.

This was spicier than I was expecting but still fantastic.  I used chick broth and regular peanut butter which I definitely recommend you do as well. Next time I am going to add more than 2 cups of broth as mine came out very thick as well as adding half as much red pepper flakes.  Definitely serve this over rice too.

Loved it, it could definitely use more broth, mine came out extra thick.  Couldn't have been more easy, I just tossed everything in the pot!

I also cut the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, used chicken broth instead of water and used only 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper.  Not bad, but was not blown away by this one.  Maybe more onion?

A very good stew. It was rather on the thick side though. The flavors were all there as well, as some spice too. I really enjoyed it!

***** Awesome recipe!  My husband loved it ( I didn't tell him there was peanut butter in it until after he had eaten some).. I added a finely diced jalapeno pepper, used sweet potato instead of white potato, white beans instead of garbanzo, and included diced celery and red pepper.  The spices just made the dish though.  Also I used half the amount of peanut butter that was called for. I will make it again very soon!

I loved this recipe, but I do love anything with a peanut sauce.  I used only about 1.5lbs of chicken tenders and chicken breast.  Used a sweet potato instead, one carrot and one can of diced tomatoes.  I worried the tomatoes wouldn't mix well,  but they really added to it in my opinion. 1/2 cup of peanut butter seemed like enough, kept  all the spices the same. Yummy.

Before making this dish, I read many of the reviews.  I made three changes...2 chicken breasts cut into small bits, 1 can of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter.  It was WONDERFUL!!!!  BUT...I think you need to be a person who would normally enjoy Thai or Indian food.  It tasted very similar to a Panang chicken dish in a Kansas City Thai restaraunt.  We LOVED it!

This dish was good! This is like an Indian curry dish.  I did have to modify it a bit b/c of what I had on hand - but, I decided to try it based on the 'whatever is on hand' mention ...  I used 3 chicken breasts, sliced generously. I was running out of peanut butter and included some almond butter, I added a can of diced tomatoes (undrained), celery and green onions.  I didn't have corriander on hand - I found a combo of sage and lemon zest would work instead.  I just used a little sage. I used chicken broth - but much more than it calls for ... to maintain a more liquidy consistency. I only used half of the crushed red pepper - and that was plenty. I threw some peanuts in too.  I served it over jasmine rice w/baguette. I agree with other comments - initially, I couldn't tell if the dish would be good?  And it was! My husband agreed!  I wasn't overly excited by it, but pleased to enjoy something new and I apprecitate the flexibility the recipe allows -- my children weren't goin' for the spicyness ... It makes it on my menu - but only very once-in-a-while.

I don't normally write reviews but I wanted to express caution to anyone considering trying this recipe. The peanut butter was overwhelming! The sauce was thick and pasty. I would recommend reducing the pb to 1-2 tablespoons or even eliminating it altogether. Maybe use a can of diced tomatoes with herbs. I don't know but it definitely needs tweaking.

This was ok, but I wouldn't make it again. I used less peanut butter and chicken broth, as others have suggested, but I had to heavily spice to try and cut the peanut butter flavor. It was just too much and gave the stew an odd texture. I would probably suggest even less peanut butter and adding another flavor to cut, like celery.

I tweaked this recipe so that I can let it cook in the crock pot while I am at work. I substituted a 2.5# boneless, skinless turkey breast for the chicken, used a whole 32oz box of chicken broth and added celery and carrots. Plus I didn't really measure anything. I sautéed the onion, garlic and celery in olive oil, seasoned w/Nature's Seasoning and added the potatoes and carrots. Then I poured in the broth, brought it to a boil and added scoops of PB, some coriander, cumin, red cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes. Finally I added the garbanzo beans. O. M. G. It already tastes soooo good! I am going to let the turkey sit in the stew overnight and pop it in the crock pot in the morning. I can hardly wait. I plan on serving it over rice.

My husband and I love this!  I usually don't have a whole chicken lying around, so I just use chicken thighs or breast.  Still comes out great!  We eat it with couscous or rice.  The only variation I use is instead of water, I use chicken broth.  It really pumps up the flavor.  Throw a little fresh cilantro on top, and it perfect!

I only used about half the chicken (1.5 lbs), with the same amount of sauce. Omitted the black pepper, a bit less red pepper and a little more coriander seed powder (bc I like it!) In the end, it wasn't what I expected but still OK, I would rate it a 3. Fam liked it better than I did (they said 4 stars) and asked for more heat next time!

i thought this was very good.  like many others, i used chicken broth instead of water, added carrots.  my only criticism, too much salt.  next time i'll use half as much.  we had this with brown rice and fresh chopped cilantro, cucumber salad on the side.  yum.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the roasting chicken. I sauteed diced carrots, sweet potato, white potato, onion, garlic, celery and added a canned of diced tomatoes (drained) as well. I doubled the spices, but will only use 1-1/2 times the amount next time as it was a tad bit too spicy for me. I may cut back on the chicken broth as the vegetables add a lot of liquid on their own and I prefer a thicker stew. I used 3/4c PB to help thicken it though which worked just fine. I served this over Naan. Will definitely make again!

I took others' advice and added a can of chicken broth and only 1/2 cup peanut butter.  It still came out too dry and really peanutty.  And although I cut the pepper flakes way back, I still thought the flavor was very good.  Next time I will add more liquid and perhaps just some regular peanut butter (which do not seem so overwhelmingly peanutty).   I did add carrots and parsnips too, which I think is a nice addition.  I think it tastes pretty good and hope to refine it to our tastes next time.

This is a very warming and hearty stew. I used chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces, added a can of stewed tomatoes 1/2 way drained and serve over rice. I also cut the recipe in 1/2 but kept the spices the same; as it makes a lot and we like the yummy spices w/the peanut butter. Mmmm.

This is delicious.  My husband and son's have not liked my foray into online recipes, but everyone agreed this was wonderful. Just used 3 chicken breasts and substituted the chicken broth and used Jif. Wasn't too spicy, just perfect and lots of flavor.  Would like to know if anyone has a suggestion for a green vegetable to serve with it?

This was absolutely delicious!  Could have used more potatoes though, I used 2 medium ones, probably use 4 next time.  Otherwise a VERY interesting and tasty dish!

What a delicious meal! I have made this many times when we had dinner guests and they all rave about it. Our kids love it too. It makes the house smell great and looks gorgeous on the table. I cut up a whole, cooked rotisserie chicken, which saved some time and added even more flavor. Like many others, I also added carrots and switched out the potatoes with sweet potatoes. We serve it over rice. Enjoy.

This stew is very unique and everyone loves it.  I changed regular potatoes to sweet potatoes, and I'm not a fan of Garbonzos to I added black beans instead.  Doubled garlic and spices.  So good!

This dish really is fantastic! Lived up to previous reviews...you really can add what you want and it comes out great.  I used celery, carrots and mushrooms in addition to what the recipe called for.  Also used chicken broth instead of water and cayanne instead of red pepper flakes.  I let it simmer for a bit so it got thick and put over egg noodles and was just fantastic! Husband loved it x2 servings!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have garbanzo beans.  This was ok.  It didn't have a lot of flavor, so I would follow others' suggestions with using chicken broth instead of water and maybe some more red pepper flakes.  It's a very hearty/healthy dish though.

Pretty good. Tried this to have something different. It is one of those things you can only eat once in a blue moon. I had A LOT of leftovers. I even froze a whole extra 2 meal-sized bags, after dinner was finished! I did eat the leftovers I put in the fridge the next day, and it seemed to have a better taste. I think the spices had more time to blend. 
I will try this again...but maybe make it the night before.

DH and I thought this was really good, though it turned out a little dry -- I think we used too much peanut butter.  We used a rotisserie chicken per another reviewer's suggestion, which simplified things, and chicken broth instead of water.  It's an easy recipe once you have all the ingredients together.

Be prepared for leftovers since the recipe makes a lot and is very filling.

This was good, when I first put the peanut butter in it didn't taste right but the longer it simmered the more the flavors came together.  I used a can of chicken broth and an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Good and hearty but not really my cup of tea, probably won't make again but it was nice to try.

Very easy to make and very delicious to eat. 
Added sweet potatoes, carrots, and celery to the stew. To make things go faster buy some store bought rotisserie chicken and shredded into pieces instead of cutting and cooking chicken from scratch. Enough stew to last for a week!

I was excited on trying this recipe. I followed the instructions and used every single ingredient on the list. I must say I didn't like the taste.. Those who enjoy the peanut-buttery taste will enjoy this plate. But my family didn't agree with it.

I enjoyed this very much. It had a nice flavor, not too spicy if you add only the pepper flakes. One tip: easy on the peanut butter. Add a little at a time. I found that I didn't need near as much as the recipe called for.

I really enjoyed this.  I was a little nervous, since it is a little different.  But it was really good.  I didn't have any corriander, so I substituted curry and it had a great flavor to it.  Even my kids liked it.  i served it with steamed rice.

This is a recipe to print and keep! I doubled up on the peanut butter and I even added some extra ginger. My family absolutely LOVED this. When I was shopping for the ingrediants, my hunny was a little skeptical. After I made it and served it for dinner, both him and our son just loved it. They asked for seconds and even THIRDS! Our son can sometimes be a picky eater when it comes to trying new foods, but after trying this, he asks for me to make it again. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

I was looking for something different to make for dinner and came across this recipe. I made it with an already roasted chicken. It turned out great. There was so much I brought some of the leftovers to work and my boss fell in love with this dish and asked if I would make it again for him. Really great flavors.

This is a split decision between my husband and I. I would actually rate it about 3 but he seemed to like it and wanted to give it a 4. I opted for sweet potatoes which I think made it much better. However, I believe that this is way too thick and peanut buttery. It is pretty mushy as well. I served with plain yogurt to offset the peanut taste. I may make this again but I will defintely have to tweak the recipe.

This recipe has spiked my interest for African cuisine! I used regular boneless/skinless chicken breasts, added 2 more cloves of garlic, reduced the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, added 1 cup of chicken stock and substituted sweet potato and added this in for the last 10 minutes. We served this over rice with chopped peanuts for garnish. Definitely a keeper!

DEE-LISH :) Happy family here :) I heeded the advice of other commenters and doubled the spices (except the red pepper or it would be too hot for my taste) kept the PB at 1/2 cup, used a half cube of boullion in the water, and doubled the water. It was great!!

I like the way the chicken soaks up the flavor a little of the broth, but this is just bland. although like others i doubled the spices and used chicken broth, still just bland and different. will not make again. my family didn't like it much.

It tasted YUMMY!!!! I did reduce the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, added about 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 tbsp of lemon juice for flavor enhancement.  This dish also reminded me of the phillipino dish "kara kara" which uses ox tail instead of chicken and when serving it, dip the ox tail in a salted shrimp paste.  I will try it with ox tail next time:)

Very good and very spicy. I halved the recipe, but it still made 6 servings, as this is a very heavy dish. Used chicken breasts and a little less peanut butter. I would omit the garbanzo beans next time, I didn't care for their texture. I served them in bread bowls, which made this a complete meal. Next time, I would add a little more liquid for the bread bowls to absorb.
