I make this for 4th of July every year and it always goes. The best part is that you can use fat free/ sugar free or light versions of the pudding and coolwhip and it doesn't make it any less yummy. I usually add slivered almonds on top.

I make this with the jello fat free cheesecake flavor pudding in place of vanilla---much better tasting :)

This was easy, delicious, and low-fat. I added extra fruit, as the stated amounts didn't really completely cover the layer of cake. Taking time to arrange the cake cut (white) side out really makes a beautiful presentation!

This version is kinda boring...I take a quater cup of oragnge juice and a teaspoon of almond extract mix together then pour over the cubed angel food cake (the cake will not get soggy it just addes a nice flavor.) Then layer with pudding mixture and frozen strawberries, blueberries and raspberries.  Put in frig for about 2 to 3 hours.  By the time you are ready to serve the berries have thawd.  This is really good!!

We all really enjoyed this after our barbeque.  It was light and refreshing. I did use some frozen berries with the fresh, and liked the juice soaking into the cake. Since it uses fat-free sugar free pudding and cool whip, it is healthier and yummy at the same time.

I made this for a Memorial Day picnic with great results!  I did end up making a few changes - used pound cake instead of angel food, used cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla and separate layers of strawberry and blueberry jello and didn't have a separate Cool Whip layer.  It was truly simple to put together, impressive to see and tasty to eat.

Very easy and looks so pretty and festive. Light and tasty, too.  EDIT 6/29/10: I made this again for the 4th of July because my husband really enjoyed it last year.  However, instead of using angel food cake (which I find dry and don't particularly enjoy), I used the Country Pound Cake recipe from this website.  Much better-- the cake is moist and subtly flavorful and goes great with the cream and berries!

I'm sure I must have done something wrong but mine just didnt turn out good--Also were not really angel food cake fans so maybe that had something to do with it also :/

We tried this over the Memorial Weekend holiday- my kids and hubby ate until it was gone!  No leftovers!  I used a pound cake in mine, but I will definitely use angel food the next time- much lighter!

I just made this for the second time yesterday for a get-together. It is delicious! I love the simplicity of the recipe. Yet, it tastes like a dish that took much more time to make than it really did! My family likes a little more of the vanilla pudding flavor, so I used more than the recipe called for. It is great as written, though. I will definitely keep this on my list of impressive but easy desserts!

I brought this to a BBQ yesterday and everyone LOVED it!  Even the kids were coming up to me to let me know how much they enjoyed it.  This was so simple to make and I will definitely not be waiting to next July 4th to make it again!

I have made this same dessert with a few changes.  I use Sugar-free Lemon pudding.  Everyone loves it.  The lemon makes it cool and refreshing.  Using fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries.  It's a hit everytime I make it.

Everyone loved this for our 4th of July dessert.  I  used 2 boxes sugar free cheesecake flavored pudding instead of vanilla (made according to directions)and used the fat free whipped topping as another layer. I also drizzled some microwaved blueberry preserves over the pudding layer.  Very weight watcher friendly.
