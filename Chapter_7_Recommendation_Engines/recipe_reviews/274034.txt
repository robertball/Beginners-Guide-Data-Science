I did as the note suggested and cut the red pepper to 1/4 tea and it was perfect for heat!  I substituted tarragon vinegar for the cider vinegar and that, for us, was a huge winner.

Great alternative to the classics sweet coleslaw. This is a little spicy so if that’s not appealing to you, use less cayenne. Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly.. first time to massage cabbage but it did get softer just as he said it would. The chef gave very clear instructions on how to adjust for your taste. My husband loved it. We ate with BBQ chicken.

Another great recipe by Chef John! This was very tasty by itself, but I served mine on top of a pulled pork sandwich. So good, and I can't wait to make it again!

SOME LIKE IT HOT!

Just not me.  

He said to adjust the spice and I did. But apparently not enough. If you are a wimp when it comes to spicy foods HEED HIS WARNING. I didn’t add the full amounts, yet it was still overly hot to my taste.  Prepared it to serve on pulled pork and on the sandwiches, it was better. But I’d never serve it solo as presented.
