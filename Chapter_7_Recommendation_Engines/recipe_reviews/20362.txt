Shwarma is a middle eastern dish and this recipe though not traditional is very good. After the chicken is done saute sliced onion and green bell pepper in the clarified butter until onions change color to a light golden brown.  Serve chicken with the sauted veggies rolled in warmed pita bread. Accompany this with some plain or spiced yogurt on the side and you have great meal.
I went back and changed my ratings from 4 to 5 stars as this dish gets better everytime I make it. The last time I made it I served it with some hummus on the side and a green salad. Thanks for this easy yet outstanding recipe.

This recipes is fantastic! It's easy to make and tastes fabulous - a nice change from day-to-day chicken. I ran out of garam masala and substituted with mutton masala - it tasted even better. Thanks Kathy!

Very good and very easy to make.  Like other reviewers I sauted an onion and green pepper with additional garam masala.  Also, I didn't have clarified butter (I only had Country Crock and I wasn't sure how that would turn out clarified) so I used olive oil.

I recommend cooking the chicken with chopped onions and garlic. Add a few whole cloves, just remember not to eat them. Add some chilli powder if you want it a bit hotter. Once the chicken has cooked through add either cream or coconut milk.

You can easily clarify butter by slowly melting it in a frying pan and skimming off the solids that float on top of the clarified butterfat, though to prevent my regular butter from scorching I merely added some olive oil and fried the chicken in that. Though this recipe has nothing to do with authentic shawarma, it is quite flavorful and excellent accompanied by some fried onions and roasted peppers and asparagus.

I served this dish to my non-Indian friends, and they loved it.  I loved it for its ease in preparing.  I did put in a bit of tamarind paste, though.

Another good idea is going to Glatt (kosher) Markets and buying Shwarma powder. Chicken breast with olive oil and Shwarma powder are good mix when making Middle Eastern food taste authentic.

Make sure you REALLY scrub your frying pan when you're done making this.  I made curry flavored pancakes the next morning by accident.

I hoped that my Middle-Eastern husband would like this one, but he didn't.  He found it to be too sweet.  I thought it was ok, but it's just not the real thing.

This was the easiest to make.  A unique flavor.  Don't go light on the garam masala, use all that's called for!  We fought over the pieces with the most spice.  A dash of sea salt may be needed & that made my little kids all LOVE it!  We added a couple more tablespoons of butter and let the chicken simmer while the rest of dinner finished cooking.

This recipe was really good.  I know it wasn't exactly traditional, but for someone just learning to cook, it was great.  This time, I added homemade hummus.  I think next time I'll add yogurt, onions, and maybe some peppers.

This tasted great for such a simple recipe.  I was in the mood for Indian food, but didn't want to spend a lot of time cooking, and this was a great alternative!

Not being very familiar with Indian cooking, I had no idea how this would turn out.  I was pleasantly surprised, though.  The chicken has a wonderful flavor, this is a simple recipe, and you don't have a "naked" chicken when you are finished cooking!  Frying with the clarified butter allowed the chicken to brown nicely without burning.  I did add a little salt, sprinkled on at the end of cooking.  I served this with basmati rice, creamed spinach and naan, and the family enjoyed the meal.

I really liked this recipe.  I have just tried mid-eastern cuisine recently and I really like it.  I found garam masala and ghee (clarified butter) at a small Indian/Pakistani grocery store.  I did add a little garlic salt.  Next time I will try adding bell peppers and onion.  
Thanks for the recipe!

We like Indian food but I found the garam marsala made us all sneeze when the chicken was cooking.  Also rather dry.  I won't use the recipe again.

We loved this one.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  I grilled it on our cast iron griddle, which always seems to add some additional flavor.  I also grilled some red onion slices, which turned out to be a good compliment.

I thought this seasoned the chicken pretty well. I made naan bread today and wanted some flavored chicken to put on it. I had about 3/4 of a lb. of chicken, so I reduced the butter and seasoning to 2 Tblsp of butter and about 1 Tblsp of garam masala and it was plenty. I used a garam masala recipe from this site. With chopped dill pickles and garlic sauce it all went good together per other recipe suggestions. ty

Over all a very good basic recipe. Needs a little something more.  I did the onions and such like most others but still needs more garlic and definitely a yogurt sauce!

I’m no expert on chicken shawarma so I can’t say how it compares to authentic shawarma, but I found this dish just okay. It’s not over-the-moon great, and I found the flavor very mild.
