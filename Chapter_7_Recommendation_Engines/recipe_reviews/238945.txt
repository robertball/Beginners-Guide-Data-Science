This was an easy to throw together Sunday morning breakfast.  I like that it makes only an 8X8 pan, as opposed to a 9 X 13.  It's also easily customizable; I used ham in place of sausage and 8 eggs in place of Egg Beaters (R).  I think some onion would be a nice addition, too.  It won't become my go to breakfast casserole, but we both enjoyed it.  THANKS for the recipe, PAM.

Breakfast, lunch or dinner this casserole will deliver the flavor. Make ahead, cut into squares and reheat for those on the go. Pam® spray made for easy release and clean up without the greasy feel or taste.

I have never tried egg beaters. They are actually not too bad. This recipe was so super easy too. I don't care for pre-cooked sausage, personally, so I used 4 maple turkey sausages I cooked from the day before. I also used sharp cheddar, since there is so little in the recipe, to up the cheese flavor. I had one small red pepper, so that is what I used, and I chopped it very small. That all worked great. I actually like a more crisp hash brown in an egg casserole, but this worked fine for ease. I lined an 8x8 pan with 2 layers of foil and sprayed with PAM. As usual, it made for extremely easy clean-up. What is so great about this recipe, though, is, cut into 8 squares, it is 115 calories a serving. That is great for a breakfast dish. ty

This is a great and easy recipe!  My go-to morning egg casserole has cubed bread in it - and is NOT gluten-free friendly.  Therefore, when I found this recipe I decided to give it a try for my GF friends who were attending my brunch.  For ease of preparation, I purchased the Jimmy Dean's Turkey Sausage Crumbles and used 1/2 bag of crumbles.  Also, the refrigerator hash browns came in a 20 oz bag.  This recipe calls for 2 cups, which equals 1/2 of that bag - or 10 oz.  The red pepper didn't do much for the flavor.  I would either add a different vegetable (sautéed onion, green chiles,  sliced mushrooms to name a few), more breakfast meat and/or a little bit more cheddar cheese for flavor.  The hash browns don't add flavor - they mostly add substance!  The ladies loved this recipe and all asked for it after my brunch concluded.  I will make this again, but I will make the changes I suggest above!  Enjoy!

Great little recipe. I didn't have enough potatoes (thought I had another bag in the freezer!) so I shredded some fresh ones to make up the two cups (rinsed all the starch off before throwing in the egg mix). I used 2% milk and a mix of sea salt and garlic powder. Only other change I made to the ingredients was to use chicken sausages that I had leftover. My square glass pan broke :( so I used a Pyrex pie plate, came out perfect, I got six servings out of it but served with bagels, fruit salad and yogurt. DBF had seconds, rare for him when we have breakfast for dinner. I think they make hash browns in 2 cup bags; that would make this super easy to throw together on a busy night or weekend morning. Thanks Pam!

This was a hearty breakfast. I used sausage I had in the fridge already and added green peppers and onions, because I love red and green peppers and onions with my eggs and sausage.

This was very easy to get together and I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was!   I don't like using prepackaged cooked sausage, so, I used fresh turkey sausage links and cooked them before adding them to the casserole.  I also added about 1/2 cup of finely diced onion.  Other than that I kept it exactly as the recipe stated.  It did take mine about 7-8 minutes longer to cook in order to be set in the middle.   Both my husband and I thought it had very good flavor and you would have never known it used egg beaters.   I will make this again, but, for our taste probably add a little jalapeno or green chilies.  I did serve this with cholula hot sauce which was perfect for us.

This was easy & tasty I used johnsonville turkey sausage instead of banquet & was pleasantly surprised with egg beaters it was my first time using it. Also I had a lil fresh cilantro left in fridge & added that to it. I could have done without it.

My husband who is not a fan of egg substitutes ate this and enjoyed it. I didn't tell him it wasn't real eggs) I thought it was good, but lacked a little something. This took over an hour to cook for me. Definitely easy and quick to put together without making a mess. I would make again with a bit of tweaking. Appreciate that this was attempting to make a traditional breakfast casserole a little less fattening :)

We thought this was very good, even though I made a few changes and even though I may have overcooked it just a little.  I used several leftovers in place of some of the ingredients--like Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage in place of the turkey sausage, frozen hash potato cubes rather than shredded, and 8 eggs rather than the Eggbeaters.  I even threw in just a little of a leftover grilled hamburger patty.  I put a little more cheese on the top when it was done, and we used up a little salsa that we had left from another meal.  I stayed true to the intentions of the recipe, and it came out of the pan easily thanks to PAM!  This easily serves as a gluten-free recipe, too!  Thanks, PAM!

It was good and easy to make!  I think next time I will use the turkey sausage crumbles and maybe add a bit more hash browns.  The size was perfect for 3 too!

This is terrific.  Hubby really liked it too.  I made these changes...used a can of diced potatoes....added sauteed onions...bacon bits....no garlic salt....almond milk...turkey breakfast sausage that I cooked....fat free shredded cheese.  Yes many alterations but that is what I had in my house.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  Add what you want it will turn out great.

This was easy to put together, and by using the PAM spray, clean-up was a breeze. However, flavor wise I thought this dish was just okay, and probably not something that I would make again. 
I did swap out the EggBeaters for 8 fresh eggs. I used salt and pepper, but I found this to be bland. I think it's because the potatoes go in plain and unseasoned. Maybe using a bag of potatoes O'Brien in place of the plain ones and peppers would work out better? We just weren't wowed by this.

Winning combination all around and you can empty out the odds and ends in your fridge.  I doubled the recipe.  I also used cubed hash brown potatoes and cooked them in a cast iron skillet until crispy. I added 1/2 cup of fresh hot salsa veggies for some spice.  I baked in an 11x17 roasting pan and cut the eggs into 16 portions.  I added this to toasted bagels, English muffins and bagel thins and wrapped in foil.  Breakfast on the go for my kids is ready for the next three days!

I substituted 8 eggs beaten for the Egg Beaters and used cooked and crumbled sausage instead of the links. Aside from those minor changes I assembled as directed. This was a pretty good breakfast casserole! Spraying your baking dish with Pam is a must or you will have eggs stuck all over!

This was a good base of recipe but it lacks flavor.  I would add some onion to it and some other veggies to give it a little more gusto.  The proportions are great if you just want a small casserole.  I would make this again with some additional ingredients to accommodate our household.
