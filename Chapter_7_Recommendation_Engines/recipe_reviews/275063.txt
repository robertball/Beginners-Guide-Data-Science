Delicious and THIS is the way to go in the future for making tri-tip at home. In the past, I had marinated it overnight. It went on a rack in a roasting pan in a hotter oven. This made MUCH less mess and it's easier. (I still used the rack, though.) Served with Chef John's Creamy Corn Pudding - another winner. Thanks again, Chef John!
