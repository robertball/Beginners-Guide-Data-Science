This is a pretty good basic recipe, especially if you're just looking to use up leftovers. I was hoping it would be more like real lo mein, which it wasn't, so I had to make a few changes: The amount of pasta called for in the recipe is double what I would have used, so next time I'll use only half the pasta. I added shrimp, broccoli, a clove of garlic and julienned carrots. For the sauce: I ended up having to double the sauce and double the amount of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce on top of that. If I make this again I'd cut the five spice down to only 1 tsp and add 1/2 tsp. ground ginger or some fresh ginger. As it was, it was okay, but it could have been better.

this was very dry and had a strange flavor to it.  my dh did not care for the anise in the 5 spice powder.  I think next time I will find a teryaki garlic sauce.

This lo mein tastes like the real thing!  It must be the five spice that gives it such authentic flavor.  I cleaned out the fridge and added more veggies like carrots and peppers.  Delicious!!!!!

This got mixed reviews at my house. Four of us here. My son and I thought it was "ok", wife strongly disliked it (ate PB&J instead) and my daughter LOVED it. My wife didnt like the anise I think. I agree with Tiffany, it is a "different" type of flavor. But mine was not dry. This is unique in flavor. Almost reminds me of jamaican with the nutmeg/cinnamon twist.

This is a great basic recipe. I marinated some pork in Char Siu and diced it up. I used celery instead of peas because I like a little crunch and added garlic. I only used 6 oz. of Chinese stir fry noodles, as I wanted more of a veggie dish than a pasta dish. Very tasty, Kay. Thank you for the post!

I made my own 5 spice, which made this recipe good.  Then I purchased some at an Asian market and made it great!  My husband says it's as good as the real thing!

This was pretty good.  I don't think I like the flavor of 5 spice.  If I try this again I will leave that out.  I would also maybe use chicken stock instead of boullion to cut sodium further.

This did not taste like lo mein to me....It was very bland, and the Chinese Five Spices added a very odd and out-of-place flavor.

Very delicious.  First I made my own Chinese five-spice powder  (Googled it), then proceeded with the recipe.  As I was using leftover Orange Beef, I substituted beef bouillon for the chicken bouillon.  I added Asian vegetables and served it with soy sauce to spice it more.  This is a great way to use leftovers.  I will make it again.

This made a great meal. I have made it three times so far. I didn't have the spice listed in this recipe, made it with ginger instead. It came out great. I also added slivered almonds and sunflower seeds for extra crunch. Thank you for a great and simple recipe.

This is not a bad base to start from, but the Chinese 5 Spice powder is not something that most American palates are going to enjoy (you won't find 5 spice in the lo mein at your local Chinese buffet, because it tastes so strongly of star anise) and there's not nearly enough soy sauce. These are easily remedied, but I really missed the flavors of sesame and garlic and would add those in the future. Thank you for sharing your recipe -- I'm sure I'll use this again, with my own tweaks.

here is a recipe for the 5-spice  1.In a dry skillet, roast 2 teaspoons of Szechuan peppercorns by shaking the pan over low to medium heat until the aroma of the peppercorns is released (about three minutes).  2.Grind the roasted peppercorns and 8 star anise in a blender or pepper mill.  3.Strain the blended seasonings.  4.Mix in 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds.  5.Grind the seasonings until very fine. 6.Store in an airtight container. Tips: 1.Use five-spice powder sparingly, as it can be quite pungent.  2.If desired, you can substitute black peppercorns for the Szechuan peppercorn, and ground anise for the star anise (use 4 teaspoons of ground anise).

I thought it was really great.  My whole family loved it.  Didn't taste like authentic "take out" at all to us but was good anyway.  I added fresh carrots to stir fry with the snow peas just because I was running low in the pantry/fridge but I would definately make this with shrimp, baby oriental corn, carrots, and mushrooms if I had had them-this would turn the dish into a main course instead of being more of a side dish.  Thanks for finally giving me a reason to use the Five-Spice powder in my pantry!

This was pretty good! I actually added 1 cup of green onions, 1/2 cup onion, a little more soy & teriyaki sauces. Next time, I may use less oil to make it less greasy. Will make again! Thanks! :)

This was really quite good.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I tweaked it somewhat.  I used vermicelli instead of spaghetti and I used some sesame oil and not as much canola oil.  I also added thinly sliced beef strips, julienne carrots, red & green peppers, mushrooms, celery, broccoli and cauliflower along with the snow peas.  I found it quite strong tasting so I diluted it with a mixture of chicken broth and soy sauce to make it better and it was quite nice.  So when I make this again (and I will)I'll simply cut down the 5 Chinese spices to 1/4 tsp or less.  Even though it was strong it was very enjoyable and this is on my keeper list.  Thank you Kay for sharing your recipe with us.

It was good, but too much pasta for the amount of liquid.  I will make it again and take some suggestions from some of the other reviews, and double the liquid. It was more than a 3 but less than a 4.

I left out the chicken bouillon granules (out of them) and the chinese five-spice powder (don't  have any) and used frozen peas and added fresh sliced mushrooms. I really liked these as a side, but would be great as a meatless entree!

It was ok. I didn't think it tasted much like real Lo Mein.  I didn't eat it fresh, but reheated the noodles the next day.  I thought it had a strange flavor (probably due to the 5 spice).  If I made it again I would half the noddles but use the normal amount of sauce.

I doubled the sauce and added garden veggies out of the fridge that needed to be used. We loved this!

Good starting recipe. I used some of the suggestions. I doubled the sauces and added mushrooms, bok choy, bean sprouts. I could have used half the pasta but I like Lo Mein with LOTS of veggies.
