This is the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever tasted.

It is extremely moist and very chocolately.

I put it in the freezer immediately after taking it out of the oven and that adds to the moistness.

You can't beat this cake, and with chocolate icing you can't just eat one slice.

ENJOY, and thanks for the recipe.

Baking is my passion. Mine turned out dry and nothing special in the taste.  In thinking back I know I followed the recipe to a T so was very disappointed.

This is a really yummy, moist cake. I used it with the "Fudgy Cream Cheese Tunnel Cake" recipe on this site (instead of using a cake mix), and it went perfectly! I'll deffinetly make this again. My boyfried called it "Awesom!"

I made this cake on Christmas Eve so that my grandson, who has dairy allergies, could have something "chocolate" for dessert. He is only five years old, but he managed to eat two huge pieces...one after the other, and took a good amount home with him. Wonderful chocolate cake; we all enjoyed it very much! I almost forgot to mention that this recipe tested "done" for me after being in the oven for only 25 minutes; after cooling, it was perfectly moist.

I found this recipe after searching for one that didn't use butter, shortening, or margarine.  It was easy to make and it was delicious!!  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and it turned out well.  The only problem was the hot water caused a lot of the chips to melt but it just made the cake more chocolate-y.  My husband normally doesn't eat dessert but he had 2 pieces!

I've made this cake loads, and it always turns out beautifully. I toss a handful of chocolate chips in the batter and on top. I've also crushed up a Terry's Chocolate Orange and stirred that through. very yummy base chocolate cake recipe!
