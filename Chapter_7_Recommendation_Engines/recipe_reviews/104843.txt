What a wonderful spread. Very light, mild and yet tasty. I've recently started exploring different compound butters and this one is very nice. The dill doesn't have a very strong flavor. So this is a great spread on toast I would agree. I haven't tried it on veggies yet but going to. A little goes along way.

his took the delicious taste of butter, and turned it into a dull dill.

Wonderful.  Great infusion of flavors, and adds a bit of class to a regular spread.  Add garlic, etc to jazz it up even more.
