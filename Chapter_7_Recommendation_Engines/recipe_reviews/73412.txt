HOORAY! SUCCESS AT LAST!  After 2 successes and 2 "almost" successes( my butter pooled on top twice) I read about 50 reviews, applied all the tips and had perfect toffee.  Here are all the tips you need for success too: test your thermometer in boiling water (212f)to be sure it's accurate.  Use a heavy, large pot or pan (I used a 4 quart nonstick pot).  Melt butter/sugar on medium/high heat, whisking the WHOLE time (I used a flat whisk that allowed me to get edges incorporated in very well). Let come to a steady, but NOT rolling boil, at about medium heat, and continue to stir frequently.  At medium heat it really shouldn't burn. Last, keep temping toffee until thermometer says 285-295...at 285 do the ice water test by dropping a dot of toffee into some ice water...it should be brittle.  If so, it's done.  It will be a very dark amber color. Pour into foil lined pan, put on chocolate and nuts and, VOILA!  Perfect toffee!!  Refrigerate before breaking apart!  I also keep it in a cool place (fridge or in an airtight container in the garage, in the winter, then it's extra brittle :)).

I have been making this toffee for 40 years.  I cook it until 300 degrees.  You have to stir constantly or it burns.  Also, I make it in a 9x13 or 10x14 pan.  I butter the bottom of the pan, spread the crushed almonds over the butter and pour the toffee mixture over that. I sprinkle the chocolate chips on top, let them melt and then spread.  Mmmm, good

(Here is a hint)! Before you pour on the melted chocolate over the toffee, wipe off the excess oil with paper towel, so that the chocolate will stick better.

The butter started to seperate from my toffee and I panicked. I continued cooking it up until 300 and then poured off some of the butter before putting in my pan. I really did not think it would turn out. However I still put on the chocolate and almonds and it tastes fantastic! My mistake was following another reviewers suggestion. I stirred the toffee constantly. You should stir frequently but NOT constantly. Stirring too much will cause seperation. If you have not been stirring constantly and it seperates try lowering the heat a bit and slowly stirring to get the sugar and butter to re-combine. You can also add 1/4 c. to a half a cup of water 1 Tablespoon at a time to help the butter re-mix.

Toffee came out excellent! My mom, who was an expert candy maker, taught us that boiling sugar like in this recipe requires OCCASIONAL stirring. This recipe states to "STIR OCCASIONALLY" so follow the recipe. Some women who are not familiar with making candy want to stir and stir because that's what we know, but boiling sugar for candy does not require a lot of stirring. Always use a wooden spoon, no metal (changes the temp). The reason the butter separates: by stirring and stirring you're cooling the sugar down and not allowing it to get hot and cook. Do not take a spoon and scrape the sides of the pot "above" the boiling line, that's where the sugar crystalizes. If you scrape, your candy will come out gritty. Hopefully this helps.

As a professional Chef, I say mom2oovc has the best directions.  It is very important to remember the following:
1. The pot MUST be "heavy-bottomed". It allows for the best even heating. Constant stirring should not be necessary at a medium heat.
2. At medium heat it should take about 20 minutes to reach 285F. If your temp is rising faster than that, your heat is too high. 
3. Remember to consider your sea level. High sea levels affect your results.
3. Butter pooling or separation is caused from cooking too fast at too high a temp.  At medium heat you will not have this problem.  It is better to heat at a lower temp and adjust if it is taking more than 20 minutes to reach 285. The temp will rise faster in the beginning and slow as it reaches higher temps. Don't rush it!
4. 285F is "soft crack" meaning your toffee will be more pliable or chewy when cooled.  The higher you take it (300-310F), the harder and more brittle the candy will be when finished.
5. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER!  The boiling water method is best (212F), but remember to take sea levels into consideration! Don't let your thermometer rest on the bottom of the pan, but about 1/2" above it.

Wonderful, easy toffee recipe!  I always like to add a few nuts to the bottom of the pan before pouring in the toffee mixture.  Gives the toffee that little extra edge of flavor.  Side note: using a large baking sheet will make for a thinnier toffee bottom, use a small cookie sheet if available.   This recipe is definitely a keeper and great for gifts during the holidays for those friends who do not cook/bake!

Excellent! I found the solution to the butter separation! Make it in a wide, shallow pan, like a cast iron skillet, and use a metal slotted spoon to whisk the mixture in an up and down motion, making sure to incorporate the separated butter on the sides of the pan. My butter started to separate, but this helped tremendously to incorporate it back  into the sugar. I added vanilla, extra salt, and topped with a dark 60% cocoa chocolate and chopped pecans.  Perfect!

Delicious.  I used 2 sticks of butter and 1 cup dark brown sugar (or light brown) and added a splash of vanilla and the 1/4 tsp. salt.  Poured into 2 9inch cake pans sprayed with pam.  Turned out great with or without chocolate and nuts.  Use the heaviest pan that you have; I have Le Crueset and it helps prevent hot spots.  EDIT 12/23/08: Made a batch with the original measurements (usually make 1/2 batch).  Needed to use 3 cups brown sugar for the 2 cups butter.  DIdn't add chocolate, just pecans.  Much easier to make a half-batch, but was still AMAZING toffee.  12/09/09: Made tonight and added a generous pinch of sea salt and press very finely chopped walnuts into toffee with the back of wooden spoon.  :)

This toffee is super easy and absolutely delicious!!!!!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  I've made it several times already, including to give as gifts this past Christmas.  Everyone I've shared it with has loved it.  So far, I've only made half batches (resulting in about 1lb of candy for each batch).  Other than that, the only change I've made has been to add a little bit (about 1 teaspoon or so) of pure vanilla extract before cooking.  I always prepare the aluminum foil covered baking sheet (and measure out my chocolate chips and almonds) before I start cooking, so I'm free to keep stirring once I start.  While the toffee is cooking, I stir it constantly instead of occasionally as the recipe suggests.  It doesn't take very long to chill/set - I'll usually let it chill for about 45 minutes to an hour - before breaking it into pieces.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe that I intend to make for years to come!  I highly recommend this recipe for beginners and experienced candymakers alike.

Like pralines...too soft, too bland.  
Toffee has to be cooked to 300 degrees or to the hard crack, or 12 minutes boil to where it is truly brownish.  I made it years ago from a recipe and it was perfect but here I couldn't remember the recipe.  I used this recipe but it was all wrong.  If you want a soft praline-like taste then this is it.  If you want genuine toffee, cook it to the hard crack.  I found the real recipe from Betty Crocker, and that is 1 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, not double. 1/8 tsp salt.  However, instead of spreading it on a cookie sheet (unless you just like it paper thin), I recommend pouring it in a lined rectangular cake pan in order to achieve the thickness of a real Heath bar.  Still spread a cup or cup and a half of chips with the back of a spoon, then add any chopped nuts of your choice.  Set naturally or refrigerate for a short while, then break into bite sized pieces.  This is genuine toffee with the genuine flavor, not some spruced-up praline.  Do NOT use a plastic spoon in this recipe.  Use a wooden spoon.  The plastic one will melt into the candy.  I don't recommend this recipe because it is tasteless and not at all toffee-flavored.  It is sugary and like a praline.

I just made a batch this evening and it is INCREDIBLE!  This is the first time I have made toffee, so I really don't have other experiences to compare it to, but it was super-easy and turned out perfectly.  I did tweak it a little by first toasting a cup of sliced almonds in the oven; when they cooled a little, I put a handful in my coffee grinder and chopped them up until they were almost a powder (careful: too much grinding and you'll end up with almond butter) and the rest I just broke up with my fingers.  When the candy mixture was ready, I added the broken up almonds, then sprinkled the powdered ones over the melted chocolate.  I'm telling ya, just like gourmet candy stores' toffee.  Thanks so much for an excellent recipe.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

This is a super easy receipe!  The heavy bottom pot is key though.  I tried making these last month in my stainless steel pots, no can do.  I have a cast iron pot now and they came out great..can't stop nibbling on them.  Made 1/2 with almonds and 1/4 with pecans and 1/4 with walnuts just to try the difference = none!  A nut is a nut on this toffee!  Thanks, will make many more times.

My husband and I (ok, mostly him) made this toffee for Christmas. It was easy to make and is delicious! We followed the directions with the exception of adding a teaspoon of vanilla. I took a few pieces into work and gave a few pieces to my mother and saved the rest for Christmas - everyone loved it. My husband has made toffee for years, so when using the candy thermometer he only took it to 285 degrees; he confirmed doneness by the color and the water test. The toffee was buttery, creamy and crisp but not super brittle, almost melted in your mouth! Thanks, FunkySeaMonkey, for sharing this recipe.

This will result in PERFECT toffee every time if you just follow some of the guidelines. The best tip is stirring constantly until it comes to a boil, but then only VERY occasionally after it comes to a boil (this prevents separation). Also, cook to exactly 300 degrees (anything under 300 will result in WAY too soft toffee), then pull it off the burner and immediately pour it onto a prepared pan, lined with wax paper sprinkled with your choice of nuts (the weight of the liquid toffee will "press" the nuts into it, leaving the opposite side for the chocolate). After a couple of minutes, add your chocolate to the top, wait a few minutes, then spread with the back of a large spoon until even, and pop in the fridge until set. This is the absolute best toffee recipe ever - yeilding a flaky, but crunchy, toffee that is crisp, but easy to chew and doesn't stick to your teeth...the hallmark of the most expensive toffees out there! I'd recommend investing in a $3 candy thermometer...takes the guess work and stress out of the process at the last minute! ONE OTHER TIP: It's not a bad idea to spray your wax paper lightly with non-stick spray as an extra precaution. I have had toffee stick to wax paper and have had to peel it off, which is no fun at all. :-( Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have been making this toffee for years.  The only thing I do different, is I use salted butter and do not add salt.  The lady that gave me the recipe, didn't tell me what temperature to cook it to or for how long.  She said the easiest way to do it was to put a brown paper grocery bag by the stove and when the mixture was that color then it was ready and it works.  I never use a candy thermometer.  I do like to drop some into cold water to make sure it is at the hard crack stage.  One thing I have found about the butter trying to seperate out, is never to try to make this in bad weather.  This candy is very sensitive to moisture in the air.  If you fix it only one beautiful clear days, it should not seperate at all.

Not sure I would classify this as *easy*...but maybe some people have better luck. Mine separated on my first try... I was using a non-stick pan and stirring constantly with flat whisk, because I read that suggestion in one of the reviews. I think I stirred to much. It turned into grainy clumpy sugar and floating liquid butter on top. I tried transferring it to a cast iron skillet to see if that would help. It didn't. I thought it was ruined, so I ran to the store to buy more butter and start over.   Came back 30 minutes later and the clumpy separated mess was still sitting in the pan on the stove. It seemed like such a waste to throw it all away, so I decided to Google what causes this separation and came across some tips...   The three tips I read were 1) Add hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time and continue very gently swirling. You can add up to 1/2 cup of water. I added a total of 4 tablespoons. 2) Add salt. I read that using salted butter can have better results, so I added more salt. Maybe 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp more. 3) I switched to a wooden spoon.   IT WORKED!!! Slowly but surely, the separated yuckiness came together into a fluffy caramel mixture, and then smoothed out.   It is chilling in the fridge right now, but when we tested the bit we dropped into ice water (to test if it was crunchy), it was great!

I made this over the weekend and believe this is my best batch yet!!! I reread all the reviews and took notes. You MUST have patience with this recipe. This is what I did to acheive great success. 1) Weather: This must be made on a cool dry day, some of the bad review were based upon the toffee made on rainy/wet days. 2) Equipment: I used a cast iron enamel pot, candy thermometer, wooden spoon, and measuring glass with cold water. 3) Mixing: I combined butter (used unsalted), sugar and salt together stirring until the mixture was melted.  Then throughout the cooking process I maybe stirred a few times. It will take 20-30 mins for the mixure to hit 285 degrees on medium heat. I know there is a bit of debate cooking until 300 depending how soft or brittle you like your toffee. Once the temp hit 285 I cooked for about 5 mins more and did the cold water test. The toffee was brittle and perfect, melted in your mouth.  I poured the mixture on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and almonds. Let it cool a bit and spread melted milk chocolate on top. My only regret is not making a full batch. (I wanted to perfect this process experimenting with half batches) My co-workers said it's the best toffee they've had!! Thank you funkyseamonkey for sharing your outstanding recipe!!!

I just made this recipe. I just wanted to post a note for others.  The recipe says to pour into a large baking pan.  Use a 9x13 or something similar.  I used a cookie sheet and my toffee is extremely thin as a result. Just FYI

The first time I made this recipe, I made the mistake of stirring as the temperature increased.  Also, I took the mixture off at 285 degrees even though it hadn't reached the right color.  (I thought I tested my thermometer correctly!)  It was a mess - the butter separated and none of it set up.  Suffice it to say, I tossed that and decided to try again because I had butter that was going to expire soon anyway and I wanted to get over my phobia of making toffee!  I am glad I did because the next try worked like a charm.  I followed the instructions this time (I know, I sound ridiculous!) by not stirring at all once the butter melted.  Then I didn't pay attention to the thermometer reading and just waited for the dark amber colored.  It worked brilliantly.  Everyone loved it and now I am no longer terrified of making toffee!

This is amazing!  Tastes exactly like a heath bar.  The first batch I made had a tragic accident involving a plasic jar of barbeque spice and a cat but the second batch was perfect.  I layered the almonds on the bottom of the pan and poured the toffee over it and then covered with chocolate.  I also put some in muffin pans and sprinkled salt on top.  All of the variations I made were amazing.  I took half a cookie sheet to work with me today and in less than an hour, it was gone.  I had to hide some for my friend.  I think I"ve found my go-to candy recipe.

I finally got this recipe right; I bought a digital thermometer and melted the butter completely on low/med (between 3-4 on my electric stove) before adding the sugar.  I then stirred continually until it reached 212.  I then stopped stirring, from recommendations from other sources until it reached 236.  Once it reached 236, I began stirring again until it reached 285.  It turned out great! I think next time I might cook slightly longer for a more crunchy texture. The type of pan you cook in makes a difference too.  If I use a pan that has a plain surface, it cooks to a carmel type color and is more crunchy.  If I use teflon or non-stick type coating, the sugar doesn't brown very well at all.  I prefer the plain pan WITHOUT the non-stick coating

Be certain to use salted butter and don't omit the salt from the recipe.  Salt stabilizes the butter and helps to keep it from separating out.  Also once it is boiling stop stirring.  Just keep taking the temperature ever so often.  It's easier if you melt the butter first and then stir in the sugar.

Three important keys to making this a 5-star success:    #1 - Add 1/2 cup water to the recipe at the beginning.  #2 - To keep the oil from seperating from the butter, stir CONSTANTLY all in the SAME direction.  Example - only stir clockwise.  I know it sounds strange, but I have only had one batch seperate in 24 years of making it and it was because I didn't pay attention to how I was stirring it.  #3 - To keep the chocolate from popping off the candy when breaking, wait until the candy has cooled enough to be comfortable to touch with your wrist and then spread with MELTED chocolate.  Let it cool at room temperature.    I have made a similar recipe as this for 24 years.  Mine includes 1/2 cup water and uses milk chocolate.  Before cooking the candy, I spray a large cookie sheet with pam and then sprinkle it with 6 oz sliced almonds.  I start the candy on high (throw everything in at the same time) and then turn it to medium high after it starts boiling.  It takes approximately 12 minutes from start to finish.  I don't use a candy thermometer but wait until it's smoking quite a bit before pouring it out.  If your toffee doesn't have a rich taste, you need to cook it a little longer.

I made the toffee as a  take home gift bag for a wedding. I doubled the recipe, then made it x3.
Enough for (I hope) 150 cello gift bags, to be tied with ribbon, sealed with an initialed sticker.

The first batch I made was trial & error, following the recipe, using a candy thermometer. It took forever
To get the mixture up to temp & it was still on the  light side. What I realized is that I was not 
aggressive enough with the heat. So here's what I did...

I used my Le Creuset  Soup Pot. Melted the butter. Added the sugar. Using a wire whisk, stir, stir, stir
over medium high heat keep stirring! It will look like molten lava with huge bubbles after a few minutes.
Now you can remove the whisk, stir just once in a while as the color begins to happen. Fold up from the 
bottom. Watch the heat. You may need to turn it down. It will turn brownish quickly now! Don't burn it!

You are looking for the color of a brown paper bag. Now check it with candy thermometer. 290 is great.
Pour onto foil lined half sheet pan that has been lightly sprayed with Pam & sprinkled with finely diced almond.
I used sliced almonds that I processed & pulsed in Cuisinart to a fine dice. I used a 17.5 oz milk chocolate bar
melted the microwave in a Pyrex cup 1 min., stir, 30 stir. Pour or drizzle on cooled toffee. Sprinkle with more 
almonds. Allow to dry. Store in airtight container. Keeps for a few weeks.

I have been making this toffee for 15 years since I was a little girl. I cook it just to 285 stirring the whole time. It comes out perfect every time. I made some  last night and didn't feel like chopping almonds so I just used some peppermint sprinkles on top. Also I have always used semi sweet chips on top, let the toffee cool for about 5 minutes then sprinkle them on top and let them sit for about 5 minutes. Once the chips are all shiny spread them over the toffee. PERFECT!

very easy recipe! temperature should be 300 degrees though not 285, 2 1/3 cups of sugar works better, 25 to 30 minutes on medium works for me. If the toffee starts to separate, add 1 tbsp of water at a time, it will come back together, no more than 1/4 cup. Parchment paper makes easy removal and clean up.

Separation Issue:  Add 1/4 cup of light corn syrup (helps emulsify the sugar/butter).  Also keeps the sugar from crystalizing.  Grainy issue: Sugar has crystalized (it only takes one sugar crystal to start the chain reaction) due to not using corn syrup, too high heat or not cooking long enough. DO NOT scrape toffee from sides of pot when pouring out onto pan.  Those are where the crystalize sugars (if any) will be and will separate your toffee, even at the end.  Burnt issue:  Could be the altitude.  High altitude affects cooking process.  You will have to add/subtract time depending on your altitude.  Also, cook at slightly lower temps so it won't go from "done" to "burnt" so fast and/or crystalize. It happens FAST! Sticky, not crunchy issue: Humidity.  Too much humidity in the air.  Check humidity levels the day you will be making toffee.  If it's high, or it's raining/snowing, it will make the candy "chewier." 
I know candy makers use copper pans.  I think this is what remedies the heat distribution issue, but don't quote me on that as I have never cooked it out of anything made of copper.
Hope those help.  I learned them from about 10 years of trial/error/research.  I even asked Dori Greenspan for her ideas on this subject (separating). She knew exactly what I was talking about-how frusterating it is, but had no suggestions. Sometimes candy just doesn't want to "play nice." These tips should reduce the frequency of incidents.  It's very tricky to make candy! An art.

I did everything that I could have done wrong with this recipe but your toffee can be saved!    First crystallized sugar will turn your batch into a grainy mess! Make sure the sugar is completely dissolved into butter before boiling. If there are any sugar crystals built up on the sides of the pan. Wipe them off with a wet pastry brush or wash cloth. I have also read wooden spoons can cause crystallization. Grainy toffee is the worst!    Second! Once it begins to boil STOP stirring. Set on Medium or medium low and stir once every few minutes. High heat and stirring too much will separate the butter from the sugar.    :( IF ITS TOO LATE...    Separation is an easy fix. Turn heat down to the lowest setting and add a tablespoon of hot water at a time while stirring VERY slowly. Don't add more than 1/4 cup water! Be patient...it will start to come together!    Crystallization is impossible to reverse completely but can be helped. Bring the temperature down to the lowest setting. Cover with a lid and stir every few minutes for about 10 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn!  Your toffee will still be a bit grainy but will crack not crumble.    Hope this is helpful!!

This was SOOO good! I did what one of the people down below said to do and coated both sides with the chocolate and nuts. I also did what the author of the recipe does and used pecans... not because I like them better.. it was just the only nut in the house... but anyways. The taste was wonderful the crunch was perfect. I added a little bit of the nuts into the toffee.. it tasted just like See's candy... if not better! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE! VERY EASY AND VERY VERY VERY GOOD!!!

Great recipe, but the directions could have been a been more clear for those of us who are first time candy-makers.  First off, it took much longer than 15 minutes from the point of boiling until the deep amber/caramel color.  I was fearful of burning, so perhaps I cooked at a lower temp than I should have.   I used Reynold's Release foil, so there was no need to grease it.  Once the toffee was poured into the pan, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to pre-melt the chocolate before spreading.  Following the directions, I sprinkled the chips on top and was horrified to see them sinking into the hot toffee.  I decided to spread with a spatula anyway and it was then that I realized the melted chocolate just skims over the top.    I don't suggest you use baggies on your hands to press nuts in...it actually smears the choc and makes it look messy.  Simply sprinkle nuts right away when the choc is still soft and they will stick once chilled!  Great recipe, thanks!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times. Every time I get rave reviews and everyone always requests that I make it for Christmas. It is SO good! Much better than most of the stuff you buy at the store, and that's saying a LOT because I LOVE toffee! I do have a couple of suggestions. I cut the butter in half to 1 cup and it is plenty! When I have made it with 2 cups, it was way too buttery! Then you also don't have to worry about separation. Half the butter gives it all the flavor with half the fat! Awesome! I'll take it! Make sure that it turns to a deep amber color before you pull it off the heat too or will be very sticky, almost like caramel, instead of crunchy. My sister made this mistake when she made it because she didn't have a thermometer. I don't actually use a thermometer anymore myself (I did the first couple of times), but I find that if you wait longer it comes out with more flavor and more crunch. So I would agree that you should cook it to closer to 300* instead of 285*. I also like to put the almonds in the toffee because I think it gives them better flavor. I've tried them on top and didn't care for it. I stir the almonds in when the toffee is almost done, probably about a minute left. Then I proceed to melt the chocolate on the top as directed. SO delicious!! We've also tried it with a little sea salt on top. This is a recipe I will be using for a long time. Thank you FUNKYSEAMONKEY!

I've made this twice. It turned out both times. I used room temp butter and heated the butter and sugar on medium in a high side All Clad pan- stirring with a wooden spoon quite frequently. I used a wet pastry brush to wipe down the sugar crystals from the side. Once it started boiling I only stirred about 4 times just to give it a mix. When it was the color of a paper bag, I removed the pan from the heat and stirred in the vanilla. I poured the toffee on a silpat baking sheet- added the chips- spread when melted and sprinkled with chopped cashews- very good!

My Mom made toffee like this every Christmas.  To get chocolate on both sides, I use my mother's method.  She would sprinkle an even layer of chocolate chips and pecans on the jelly roll pan before pouring the toffee mixture on top. Then she would wait until the candy had set up a bit, but was still warm. She would break up a large Hershey's candy bar and place the individual squares all over the toffee mixture. After sitting for a few moments, she would CAREFULLY spread the melted chocolate all over the toffee and top w/more chopped pecans. I also remember her spraying the pan w/a little Pam before sprinkling the chocolate chips. So wonderful!!

Though the amount of ingredients were right on, the directions are off. They said to bring the candy up to 285. You really need to cook it until 305, stirring constantly. I made 3 batches following the directions exactly, and the toffee always came out chalky. After reading other reviews I found if you cook it until 305, once cooled it will be perfect in color and will have just the right crunchieness:) 
I also chose to use chopped pecans-next time I would like to try toasting the pecans to give a sweeter taste to them. This recipe is a keeper, but remember to change the temp! Thanks for sharing:) Yummy!!!

I've been making toffee for years with a similar recipe- but the salt addition here made me think...  what would happen if I used unsalted butter? Today I used this recipe with a couple of adjustments- and it was PERFECT. 1.  I used unsalted butter and added salt for the first time ever.  Toffee was a lighter color after it cooled and was ideally crisp (snapped easily when you broke it). 2.  When cooking, I use a heavy bottom pot on a smaller burner.  My burner is 1-12 setting.  I start the burner on about 8 to melt the butter w/ sugar.  Stirring only every 25 seconds, as you can easily over work the toffee by over stirring- I use a slotted well made plastic spoon (really seems to work much better than metal or wood, as it takes the mixture easily off the sides and bottom of the pot). 3.  As soon as mixture starts to bubble (a very light boil), add 2 tsp. of water and stir... 4.  Watch very closely and take down heat a tad (to 6-7).  Keep stirring every 25 seconds or so. 5.  You are looking for mixture to become an amber color (google the color amber to see what it looks like).   6.  Pour mixture onto greased foil and let it roll naturally.  I put foil on cutting boards/ cookie sheets.  For this size recipe you'll need about 4 cookie sheets. 7.  I ground up 1/2 of the almonds to a powder.  I put this on top of the chocolate and the slivered almonds on top of that. 8.  Press down on top layer to embed almonds. 9.  For best result, put sheets in freezer for 25 minutes or so...

Used Candy Thermometer and followed recipe to the letter - EXCEPT - I wanted chocolate on BOTH sides of the toffee. When the toffee was just about finished ~ I turned on my oven to 200 degrees and using a small foil pan (8x11) I scattered some chocolate chips in the bottom of the pan and put the pan in the oven for a few min.  Once the chips were shiny I removed the pan and spread the chocolate into a thin even layer.  I then sprinkled the almonds on top of the melted chocolate and poured the toffee on top.  Tilted it to get it even in the pan and then put the remiaining chocolate chips on the top of the toffee.  Spread after a bit and then popped it into the fridge.  The great thing about the foil pan is when I removed it from the fridge I just twisted the pan and the toffee broke into chucks!!  PERFECT!!! Mmmm MMmmm Good!!

I'm sorry, but I wasnt happy with this recipe. I followed recipe exact and cooked on medium for 25 min, finally gave up, poured in pan and chilled.  The toffee has a good taste, but is still a little chewy.  I think I will stick with my old stand by recipe of 1 stick butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup water and 1 cup chopped pecans.  You cook the butter, sugar and water on med-high heat stirring constantly.  Once it boils, set your timer for 13 min.  After 13 min., pour onto foiled pan and sprinkle pecans.  Works every time.

For my taste, I like my toffee to be crunchy. So you will need to boil the toffee until a hard crack. Otherwise, this recipe will give you soft chewy toffee instead of hard crunchy toffee. I have also used different chocolate and nut pairings and it comes out yummy.

oooooooo SO GOOD!! I LOVE English Toffee but its hard to find a good recipe. I followed the advice of another poster and whisked my mixture until it started to boil.  I would also suggest using mini chocolate chips for the topping, they just melt so much faster and makes it easy. I didn't have almonds in the house but I do have a healthy supply of hazelnuts and any time I can combine those with chocolate is heaven in my book! so I ground them up and dusted the top with hazelnuts :)

I've made this a few times and never had a problem.  Until now.  I made FOUR batches the other day and they all separated right before it turned dark amber.  I finally thought maybe it was because I started with frozen butter which I'm not sure I've done previous times.  I didn't think it would matter since you melt it anyway but I looked online and found some others saying it was a problem to use frozen butter.  So, I went to the store and got fresh butter and this time it worked!  I was too afraid to even try thawing my frozen butter b/c I read some people saying even previously frozen butter will cause problems.  SO...do not start with frozen butter!!!  Lesson learned!

Just put my cookie sheet of this toffee into the fridge and it came out perfect!!  Followed the directions and took the hint to not stir once it started to bubble up.  I did let it hit 300*.  The only thing I did differently was to sort of whip it up a bit before pouring onto the cookie sheet.  None of the butter puddled up on top at all!!  First time trying and I can say success!!!  Thanks for any easy, yummy recipe!!

no one can resist home made toffee like this! sometimes i add corn syrup which makes the toffee more glossy and clear (it tastes the same, the two forms of sugar keep eachother from crysatlizing).

Looking through the reviews, I can't believe people had a problem with this! I've made this recipe for the past 3 years, without a candy thermometer, and I've never had a problem with it. I judge it based on the colour of the toffee as it's boiling. With that being said, this is amazing! Everyone always loves it, and it's always a hit at potlucks. I've made a video of me making it for this Christmas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPhej9mWew

Made this as written and the butter pooled on the top... still tasted great though.  Made the next batch but stirred it the entire time and the butter did not pool at all.  Yes!  Perfect!

Perfect! Didn't change a thing except to use 3 cups chocolate chips instead of 2 for the chocolate layer (2 would have been pretty skimpy).  At first I thought it was not going to be hard enough - the traces left on the spoon seemed more chewy, like caramel, however after it cooled it was a perfect toffee (soft crack - crunchy, but will dissolve in your mouth) consistency.  I did use a candy thermometer, and would definitely recommend it to get the correct end result.

This is the first time I've ever strayed from my tried-and-true toffee recipe and I was sorely disappointed!  I've made the other recipe at least 2 dozen times in the past 15 years and have never had it fail.  This is a grainy, soggy, gooey mess.  I was skeptical...cooking to 285 defies the laws of candy-making.  Toffee isn't toffee without hard-crack. I'm not a candy expert by any means though, so I followed the instructions and it was not to my liking.  Yes, it firms up in the fridge, but it's still chewy and grainy.  It bugs me how much chocolate and almonds I wasted on this disaster.  I cannot imagine how this recipe has so many great reviews--I can only surmise that the people who are happy don't know what toffee is supposed to be like.  This is grainy caramel at best. :(

I've made this many times now and it really is super easy...but there is a bit of a learning curve!  The candy thermometer is a huge help.  Makes a great gift.  People always ask for the recipe.

I have been searching and trying for years and this receipe is it.  The key is to stir until it starts to boil  then stop stiring.  The butter won't  separate.  I also added the nuts right into the mixture just before I poured onto the cookie sheet.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS WAS!  Brought it to a party and everyone raved.  I made sure to stir it constantly, though.  I also added chopped toasted pecans instead of almonds, and it was great.  I also didn't spread the chocolate chips, just left them on top to melt and then pressed the nuts over top.  This way there was no mess and it still looked and tasted great.  I am making this for everyone I know this holiday!

My go to recipe for perfect toffee.  Be sure to cook it on med high temp until you get that rich toffee color you want!  I find that I get the crackle stage but the color is too light so I just cook it longer and it gets that deep brown, so much better!

I've made peanut brittle for 40 years but since I found this recipe peanut brittle is no longer my go-to candy!  This toffee is SO easy to make!!!  
I've never used a candy thermometer - a previous reviewer said to cook the mixture until it was the color of a brown paper bag.  I keep the bag on the stove and when it's that color I remove from the heat! 
You also should stir constantly (Funkyseamonkey posted this is a note).
I top with roasted, salted cashews - YUMMY!!!

This is a REALLY amazing recipe and so easy. I have had some problems with the butter separating but otherwise it's great. I've done this 3 times, all without a candy thermometer (!). I test by the color and ice-water bowl, so the last batch was amazing. Definitely making again (and again and again and again...)!

I scaled this down to one stick of butter and half a cup of sugar, and it turned out great.  I cooked the toffee to a hard ball stage (a bit of the hot toffee dropped into iced water turns into a hard, breakable strand) and used the broken pieces in chocolate chip cookies.

This was the first year I made candy ever (for Christmas) and I tried this recipe. This is hands down, the BEST AND EASIEST toffee!!! I shipped it to friends and family, and got RAVE reviews all around. Pay close attention to the temp. I pulled my toffee as soon as it hit the hard crack stage. It was smooth, and melted in your mouth. This is now going to be part of my Christmas tradions!

SWIRL MORE, STIR LESS...This really is EASY and exceptional tasting! I, too, read all the reviews and what I can tell you about stirring is not to do it too much, but rather swirl the pan...this moves the toffee around but doesn't break it up and cause it to separate. Also, if you see your toffee start to smoke, it is DONE!  One reviewer said when it's done you just know and this was true for me.  This was my first time making toffee and it couldn't have turned out better. Check out my photo of this..it's the one on the glass cookie tray with the peanut blossoms and pecan sandies. Also, if you want to practice without wasting all the ingredients-halve the recipe and use a smaller pan.  I "greased" my pan with a little crisco and they fell right out.

I'll give it 4 stars only because I think the mistakes were mine. My husband really enjoyed it, but I thought the toffee part was REALLY granulated and just tasted really sugary and icky. I didn't eat it, but my husband ate it all in a matter of about a week and a half. I'll definitely try this one again and hopefully it turns out better!!

Rave reviews!  This toffee is very easy to make and tastes very expensive.  My only suggestion would be is that slow and steady wins the race when making the toffee portion.  I heated on medium for about twenty minutes, stirring the entire time, and then slowly raised the heat until it turned amber (an additional ten minutes).  My boyfriend took this to work and everybody loved it and I couldn't keep my hands off of it!

Hard to know what rating to give this. I've never made toffee before and attempt number one went badly. I followed the directions exactly and was feeling good when it started turning amber colored and I hadn't had a separation problem. Unfortunately, my problem was that the mixture turned a dark dark almost chocolate color LONG before hitting 285 degrees. I kept the temperature at slightly lower than medium to avoid burning. No burning smell or anything so not sure why it's so dark. I also had trouble with the chocolate melting...it almost seemed crumbly and I had a hard time spreading it. I'll try again but not sure what to do differently next time. Can't say for sure if this is a recipe flaw or operator error! Ok just tried round two...this time I didn't use the thermometer and acheived the desired color; however, the butter separated right at the end and it became thick. I plopped the "dough" on the cookie sheet and it stayed as is! Another flop. Ugh!

This really is fabulous & one of the easiest recipes ever! Couldn't find the candy thermometer so I used the water test and judged by the color too. I followed the recipe exactly other than using pecans for the nuts.

This toffee is so good.  This is my first attempt at candy making, so the first batch didn't work out for me.  I follow reviewers advice and did not stir after it started boiling, but the butter pooled on the top.  I poured it onto a cookie sheet, dumped the excess butter off, and put chocolate on it anyway and it still turned out ok.  The next batch I used salted butter and despite what some reviewers have said I stirred slowly, but constantly.  Every time the butter would start to separate I would add a Tablespoon of water and stir.  It pulled it back together every time.  I didn't use a thermometer and I just eyed it to get it the right color and checked it with the water method.  It turned out great!  On half I put milk chocolate and almonds, the other half I put milk chocolate and cinnamon chips (SOOOOO GOOD, if you like cinnamon).  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again.

This recipes is excellent & super easy. I even did it without a candy thermometer by following another reviewer's suggestion of testing it in cold water. Once the toffee mixture is a maple color, drop a tiny bit in cold water. If it hardens right away and is brittle when you bite it - it's done.

This did not turn out at all!  Stirring occasionally is just not enough stirring - mine was dark and burnt tasting even though I only cooked it to 280.

I have made this recipe for years and everyone loves it.  I omit the salt and instead of semi-sweet chocolate I use milk chocolate chips.  Also I have had the problem with separation a couple of times.  If this starts to happen-stop stirring and it should come together.  Also I've never used a thermometer.  I cook it until it is the same COLOR as peanut butter

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!  It takes a while for it to get the amber color.  If you don't have a candy thermometer I would cook it until the color changes and it's not as frothy anymore!  my mom and i think it tastes like almond roca.  Brilliant!   
i tried adding 2 tablespoons of instant coffee to it!  yummy!  coffee toffee!

Excellent. If you don't have a candy thermometer like I didn't have, cook till amber brown as it says and drop some in cold water... if is brittle and breaks it is done. I used chopped pecans. LOVED it.

I have just made my fifth batch since Thanksgiving.   Here is my two cents worth! I have found that my best bet is to make it in my heavy enamel coated 6 quart stock pot. I don't go past medium heat. Early on I stir occasionally, but once it hits about 240 I stir it almost constantly until it reaches 300°. I think it has more of a toffee flavor and a nice crisp consistency if you take it to 300°.  At that point I stir in one fourth teaspoon of fresh baking soda and a quarter cup of finely chopped roasted almonds. Now we are NOT dark chocolate people around here -- strictly milk chocolate, and to me, dark chocolate overwhelms the flavor of the toffee. I use Merckens milk chocolate discs from our local cake supply store.  I find it to have the best complementary flavor and hardens nicely so that it does not require refrigeration after having set up. I spread those on and once  they've melted, top with more chopped roasted almonds. 
Go get a Heath bar and try it side-by-side with this! Heath has nothing on us, girls!

Great recipe. Came out as expected, I used hazelnuts omitted the chocolate and  I used a knife to perforate lines in the toffee as it cooled so that it broke more evenly.

This is a "don't hover" recipe. Follow what submitter said. Stir good till the butter  is melted, stick your candy thermometer in and DONT HOVER! Just stir occasionally until candy thermometer reaches 300. If you stir too often, it will separate. Very easy, and good recipe

This is so simple I have enjoyed every calorie to the fullest. Being from Mississippi I substituted the almonds for pecans. To make it even better it is a simple 2,2,2,2. 2 cups sugar 2 cups butter 2 cups chocolate morsels 2 cups pecans. 1 cup pecans goes in toffee right before you pull it off the stove. Last cup goes on top. Just like making a roux you do need to stir constantly till you have the temp. correct

Do not listen to any of those reviews that tell you to stir constantly.  As soon as butter and sugar are incorporated, leave at medium heat and let the toffee work its magic.  I stir occasionally and let the mixture reach 300. DO NOT STIR FREQUENTLY, I repeat, DO NOT STIR FREQUENTLY.

I have been making Toffee for Christmas give-away's for YEARS!  MOST important- you MUST use butter.  At first you may want to use half of this recipe. Never use more than the 2 cups of butter/sugar.  It just doesn't work. People who get separation are probably using margarine.  My twist - I chop walnuts and put them on the baking sheet. About 1 1/2 cups scattered around so the sheet is covered but there are openings in between. As your butter/sugar mixture comes to temp, (do not stop stiring), you will see a VERY slight smoke. DRIZZLE immediatley over nuts. Then top with choc. chips.  Wait a minute or two, then spread the chocolate with the back of a spoon.  This will give you pretty swirls. Sometimes I will sprinkle a few chopped nuts ontop.  After cool break into pieces.  If you used alot of nuts, you may have to cut into pieces.  If you spread the nuts a bit thinner, you can poke the toffee with the tip of a sharp knife. It will break into nice irregular pieces. This is just the best stuff! And now all my friends expect it every year.  Start your own tradition!

This toffee was wonderful! Everyone had a fit over it and suggested I should sell it! I cut the recipe in half and made a half batch. The only changes I made was I used 2 sticks of butter and 1 and a half cups brown sugar. I also used dark chocolate chips and sprinkled some sea salt over the top along with the finely chopped almonds. DELISH!!

Made this for New Year's Eve, came out decent.  I was worried because it appeared that my butter was separating but I still went ahead and put it in the pan and finished the recipe.  I think the toffee tasted a little overdone, next time I make it I will probably remove from the heat sooner.  Overall people enjoyed this toffee and I will make again and will fine tune and adjust to make it even better.  I think I will invest in a heavy-bottom pan before I make again.  It appears from other reviews that this is key to a good toffee.

This was the first time I've ever made toffee, so just bear that in mind.  Even though I whisked the mixture the whole time, the butter still wound up separating like mad, and in the end I had to siphon it off when I poured the toffee into the pan.  Also, it seemed to separate more the longer I cooked it, so I didn't get quite the color or taste I wanted.  That said, this was a fairly easy recipe, and the toffee turned out pretty well.  How can you go wrong with butter, sugar, and chocolate?  :)

This was great.  Great flavor and texture.  I followed directions, and also stirred the candy while cooking most of the time.   You have to watch it carefully as it starts to get more golden.   It should be a creamy texture, and should begin to pull from sides of pan.   I toasted the almonds which added flavor.   One regret is that I didn't spread the toffee thinner in the tray at the end, so the candy is rather thick in the middle.  Still tastes great.

I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  The only change I made was to use a cast iron skillet, and I added 3 tbsp. of water and 3 tbsp. of corn syrup.  This seemed to stabilize the butter and sugar so it did not separate.  I will make this recipe again my family loved it.

This is an excellent recipe. Thank you for posting it. While cooking . .  the butter separated but as I removed it from the heat I kept stirring and it came together perfectly.  Delicious! And my first attempt at this yummy treat. Thank you again.

This is a great recipe. I use a cast iron dutch oven because the toffee doesn't burn as easily that way. I stir constantly and I don't use a thermometer. I've noticed that there is a very short window between when the toffee has that sickly hot butter smell (not appetizing at all) and when it smells like toffee. When you hit that perfect toffee point, you should see a tiny wisp of smoke come off the toffee. The first time this happened, I thought I was burning it and I pulled it off the burner immediately. But it was perfect! Then I stir in a teaspoon of vanilla and dump it out onto the parchment paper to cool.

It's good, but if you don't have a candy thermometer like I didn't and are going by the instructions to let the mixture darken to a dark amber color, I think it's too much. It tasted a little burnt.  Next time I make this I am going to cook it to a medium caramel color. Otherwise, it was good!

OMG! I finally got it right!  After reading many, many reviews, I decided to follow the directions that seemed most consistent.  I did use a cast iron skillet & I did STOP stirring it after the sugar was melted. It slowly bubbled up to 300 degrees & did not separate.  Resist the urge to stir-I tried it & it immediately started to separate. I am usually in a hurry with heat & stirring so this was a real challenge for me to leave it alone.  It didn't look uniform in brown color in the pan, but I figured that when I poured it on to the pan, it would all mix up-which it did.  The chips melted like a dream & the chopped nuts on top made it look like it came from a professional! I will pass on this recipe with all my friends.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I made chocolate truffles and this toffee and brought some to work. The toffee was everyone's favorite of the two. I did add 1 tsp vanilla before pouring onto sheet. I also used Godiva chocolate (half of batch milk and half with dark). I sprinkled the chocolate with coarse salt. One thing I needed to do is lay paper a paper towel on top of the hardened toffee and lightly pressed it to help soak up excess grease from butter before spreading chocolate over it.

I am giving this a 4 because of the instructions. I think the medium heat is too hot to start the melting process. I found that slow and low work the best. Also, stir the whole time.

On 3/9/2011 made this recipe twice and failed. As promised I am back because I know this is a good recipe that somehow I failed at. I am proud to report on 12/17/2011 I made the Best Toffee Ever!! Yea me! I used a regular pot (before I used non-stick) and lowered the flame so the toffee did not cook too quickly (cooked it low enough so it took about 15 - 20 minutes) and took it off once it reached 285 degrees. I did use twice the amount of crushed almonds and used 2 heaping teaspoons of dark brown sugar to make a full cup of white sugar and am very very happy with the quality of this recipe and I am proud enough to use it for gift giving.

I have made this several times and it usually turns out perfect. However, I have had it seperate, but I think, as some others have noted, I used butter that had been previously frozen and that could have caused it. I was able to save it when that happened by stiring very quickly and constantly after separation, and it came back together. I do not use a candy thermometer, and cook it over medium to medium high heat, (on MY stove, yours might be different), until it becomes just slightly darker than a brown paper bag.  I have used many types of chocolate chips and different nuts to top it, and it always is a hit.  I would have to say this is as good as Entroms toffee, but at a fraction of the cost.

So easy to make and it's turned out perfectly every time.    I add a bit of vanilla to the recipe and I often will add almonds to the toffee.  How I do this is to heavily butter a sheet of foil on a cookie sheet, sprinkle sliced almonds onto the foil and then pour the hot toffee mixture over them.  Once the toffee has cooled slightly on the foil -- it will be slightly firm to the touch but still quite hot -- I sprinkle milk chocolate or white chocolate chips on top, let them get melty and shiny, then smooth the chocolate with an offset spatula.  Then I sprinkle a topping on the melted chocolate; nuts, colored sugar, cake decors, even crushed peppermint candies for a special holiday toffee.  This toffee is a huge hit with family and friends and every year I get requests for it.

I cannot believe I made this.  I'm a cook, not a baker or confection maker and made this for Halloween.  Super easy and WOW was I proud.  Hint:  I would omit salt as I used salted butter and it was a bit salty and a good rule without a candy thermometer, is cook it bubbly (not high but medium) until it is DARKER THAN PEANUT BUTTER, and that worked for me!!!  EXCELLENT

HUGE hit!!  My mother was my biggest fan - she loves toffee and said this was the best she has ever had!  I did make some changes:  I halved the recipe and I used a tsp. of vanilla.  I also used a non-stick pot and cooked on medium the entire duration until I reached between 295-297 degrees and they were PERFECT!  I also did something different and put them in silicone so that I could make them heart shaped for mother's day - so very cute as well!  Everyone loved them and they were oh so addicting that I have made about 4 or 5 total batches!  Thanks for the recipe!!  (Next time I won't half it because I need all the toffee pounds I can get!)  (Oh - also I used melting wafers for chocolate, they are much better in my opinion and I waited until the toffee was room temp before I melted them. - If you do it this way, make sure that you take a paper towel and wipe off any excess oil from the toffee so that the chocolate sticks and doesn't separate.)

Should have read ALL the reviews first. This recipe wasted a pound of organic butter and two cups of organic sugar. A total bust! Highly disappointed here. Trying to make candy for gifts and I just wasted time and money on this recipe. Huge pool of butter all over the place upon pouring this out onto the pan.

This recipe is the BEST! It's so easy too! I have never made any candy before and I was worried about this, but I had no problems and the candy turned out perfect! I was worried about the separation factor that many people talked about, but I did what a few reviewers suggested and it worked out. Basically, I whisked the sugar/salt/butter mixture until it started boiling, then I left it alone, and didn't stir again until it had reached 285 degrees and was ready to be poured in the pan. I had no separation issues using this method. The toffee is soft and so good. I will definitely be making this again and thanks for sharing the recipe with all of us!

This really was very easy to make.  It was my first attempt at toffee and I was a little nervous, but it turned out great.  As tempting as it is to keep stirring it, it really does make a big difference to just let it simmer...the bubbles will stir itself.  Very tasty!

So simple!  Just note, if after you melt the butter and the sugar melts you still have a lot of butter floating around on top, add more sugar by the tablespoon while stirring until all the butter is incorporated.

I have made this recipe often but use Hershey chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips.  Just place the candy on top of the toffee after you pour it in the pan.  The Hershey melts quickly and taste yummy!

This is a great recipe, I make it every year for the office and it never lasts a whole day...usually not even half. 
I add slivered almonds to the toffee right before it turns the desired color. It gives it a good nutty crunch. 
I also use only about half of the chocolate chips that the recipe calls for, but that's because my family is not huge on chocolate in the first place. 
Do not attempt on a humid or rainy day!
Oh and I have never used a thermometer either, just watched it closely.

This was so good, i dont know how you can mess it up and i did not even have a candy thermometer, i just cooked it to the perfect amber color.  This is what i did, i stirred the sugar and butter until it was melted then i just left it alone on medium heat, i did stir once i saw the color change but for the most part left it alone, when it was the perfect color i did the water test it was brittle and perfect, i then poured it on prachment paper and stuck it in the frig, OMg it was good and tasted just that the candy bar...yummy very easy

Wonderful, rich toffee and couldn't be easier to make. It had a decadent flavor, and was perfectly crisp without being sharp the way candy sometimes can be. It really is important to use a candy thermometer. I made two batches to include in my holiday goody bags and everyone raved about it. I added a small splash of vanilla, but besides that followed the recipe as directed. I will make this again without a doubt.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this recipe at all.  The toffee itself I thought had no flavor and was almost butter color.  It just tasted like butter to me.  Also I like my toffee to have a hard crack to it which it was just kind of crumbly?  I cooked it to 300 degrees hoping it would crack nicely but nope.  I brought the toffee to work so everyone there would eat it and they all said it was good?  I will go back to my other recipe I found on here.  Thanks.

To put it mildly... OMG!  Awesome!  Just like eating a Score or Heath bar... yummm!  The only things I did differently was add a bit of vanilla extract (also helped the color) and rather than semi-sweet chips I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup semi sweet chips.  I was afraid to use strictly semi sweet chips thinking it'd be too bland, this was the right mix!  SO easy to make.  I'll be making this again for Christmas the day before we fly home so everyone can share it.  Thank you!!  :)

I use recipes from Allrecipes, at least 3 times a week and rarely comment on them, but I just had to say something about this Toffee.  It is so easy and so good.  What's up with these other toffee recipes...cook on low until mixture comes to a boil...IT TAKES FOREVER and there is no need to do that!  Anyone out there who has failed making toffee before...try this one.  And if the butter starts to separate..it will still be ok..just pour it all onto the baking sheet.

The first time I didn't cook quite long enough, resulting in a softer toffee. Instead of throwing it out, I crumbled it and used it on top of ice cream and used some in an oatmeal cookie recipe! The second time I cooked it longer and the toffee came out perfect. Delicious!
I made a half batch without a problem as well.

I used grated hershey milk chocholate bar instead of semisweet chips (grating it in my cuisinart). I also put chocholate/nuts on both sides. If you want to do both sides, put a little butter on the tin foil baking sheet before pouring the mixture on to it.  After you've done one side, place another sheet of tin foil over it and flip it over. Do the other side while it is still warm.  This was very good.

I made this recipe without the chocolate or the almonds, which made it a little overly rich. It was still gone within a few hours.

overall good recipe - good flavor, I add vanilla.  having worked this recipe on more than one occasion, I have come to the conclusion that you (PAY ATTENTION HERE FOLKS) YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE THIS TO 315 DEGREES FARENHEIT PERIOD (hard crack)  the toffee will not set properly.  it will be more like a quasi crunchy exceptionally chewy caramel.

easy recipe - very impressive. However I will warn you my first batch I did not cook the butter and sugar together long enough and though the flavor was great the results were grainy not candy like. Second time around - I ensured the mixture was heated well, and the toffee was perfect for gift giving!

After a traumatic praline failure this Christmas season, I was pretty anxious about trying anything else that involved a candy thermometer. Much to my delight, this recipe turned out PERFECTLY on my first try! I made no changes; just followed it exactly. It's a Christmas miracle!

OMG, This is the Best Toffee! Took me 2 attempts due to my impatience but the end result was well worth it. You MUST have ready 1)Pan-I used a jelly roll pan with parchment paper, no greasing needed. 2)Almonds-I lightly roasted 1 cup of slivered almonds. I then lightly chopped 1/2 the almonds & finely chopped the other 1/2. 3)use either mini choc chips or chop them in food processor. I used the slow & steady aproach but was impatient the 1st time around & after about 25 min I turned the burner up a bit. The toffee actually smelled burnt before it browned and at that point the pot & the toffee were to hot to stop it from burning. My 2nd attempt, I stirred regularly but not constantly over a medium heat for about 35 minutes. Let it come to a steady, NOT rolling boil, over medium-low heat. I did have a new thermometer which gave me an idea of when it was getting close but on the 2nd batch which turned out perfect I used a cup of ice water & dropped some in until it was perfectly brittle. It will be a medium orange-brown and quite bubbly. As soon as it was brittle I quickly poured it onto the pan. I quickly sprinkled the larger almonds into the toffee, tilted the pan to spread the toffee & then sprinkled the choc chips on top. As the chocolate melted, I gently spread it evenly & I sprinkled the finely chopped nuts on top & placed it in the fridge. Once the chocolate was set, I cut it w/large butcher knife to get nice looking peices. It was beautiful and everyone loved it!

Yum! This got rave reviews. I opted to make it thinner, but more brittle (cooked it until it was quite dark brown), added vanilla extract and a little extra salt, pretoasted the almonds, and also put almonds into the pan so the almonds were both 1) in the toffee and 2) on top of the chocolate.

The tips I got from other reviews that helped a lot:

Heat on medium heat only, err on side of cooking too slowly. Should take 20 mins to get to 285 degrees (for softer toffee, or 300-310 for harder toffee), otherwise you are going too fast. Heating slowly also will help you avoid having the butter separate from the sugar (which several other reviewers said they had problems with). Drop toffee into ice water to test if it's ready, should be brittle. Use heavy bottomed pan. Stir only occasionally. Use wooden spoon for even heating. Chilling should take 45-60 mins. If necessary, pour/wipe off extra oil off before adding chocolate to help it stick.

Classic toffee, or as some call it Almond Rocca.  I was reading reviews about the butter pooling, I was taught by an old friend to stir constantly and keep stirring when it separates and once it comes back together that's how you know it's done!  This is a great trick, you don't need to worry about a thermometer, I promise!  It will be browned and perfect.  It helps speed the process to use a large iron skillet as well.

This toffee turned out Sooo good!! My family thought it was store bought. While making it, it took a little longer than I thought it would but overall it was an easy recipe to follow. I opted to use Ghiradelli's semi sweet chocolates and I believe it definitely took it up a notch! I think next time I may try adding some vanilla extract to see if that adds more umph. Also, this recipe makes quite a bit of toffee, so I decided to wrap it up in cute baggies and give them out for Christmas.

This was my first go at toffee making and I am now on my third batch! I followed the recipe as written with just the addition of a little vanilla extract. I followed all the tips e.g. used my le crueset pot, stirred constantly to a slow, low boil, then stirred frequently but not constantly to the temperature listed (just below 300, after checking my candy thermometer in boiling water). I couldn't be more pleased with the product. I like a thinner toffee, so I spread it out on a cookie sheet. Perfecto! Thanks for this! To the one who posted that this is more of a praline, it isn't. You just didn't let it reach the desired temperature. This does take patience but it is oh so worth it!

My first time ever making toffee and it came out perfectly!!!  I used salted butter and heavy-bottomed sauce pan.. I stirred constantly until the butter melted and then stirred only occasionally with the heat on medium. My butter did not separate at all using this method!! After reading the other reviews, I heated the mixture to just under 300 degrees and then poured it immediately onto a parchment-lined sheet pan and quickly spread it with an offset spatula. I then sprinkled on the chocolate chips and waited a couple of minutes until they melted enough to spread, just as the instructions indicated. Absolutely delicious!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Just made this and it is yummy! The substitutions iI made where that I used brown sugar instead of white, and put down a half cup of chopped pecans on the bottom of the pan.  Plus, I didn't use chocolate.  Kids all loved it!

This recipe is very easy.  I gave a bag of it to several families for Christmas, and got requests for a bigger bag next year because they loved it so much.  It is addicting.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

I can't believe I forgot to rate this fabulous recipe.   I made it in Dec 2011 for Christmas trays to take to work.  This is wonderful toffee, my first attempt and it turned out perfect.  I did have some butter pooling after pouring onto the foil-lined sheet pan, but I just waited until the toffee was beginning to solidify, then tipped the pan and drained the butter off.  Then, I topped with the (milk) chocolate, and chopped and toasted almonds.  I was a little worried that the chocolate wouldn't stick, but after it had chilled, I broke the toffee into nice generous pieces and it was perfect.  An instant read thermometer, like a "Thermapen" makes taking the temp much easier.  A+

Excellent recipe!  I had no problems with separation, but it did take a long time to get to temp.  The time involved was totally worth it and the toffee was devoured.

I enjoyed the taste and it was very easy to make. However, maybe an expert cook can answer a question...I never get the toffee hard enough. It turns out a little crumbly. Does anybody have any suggestions as to why I am having trouble? I would appreciate it, because I do love the recipe.

This absolutely has to be heated to 295-300, otherwise it's somewhere between taffy and brittle.  Also, it's too light in color at 285.  Otherwise, excellent.  Try it with pecans too.

!st attempt and it came out perfect!  I used a heavy enamel coated cast iron pan and think that makes a difference.  Holds an even temperature. I used the tip of buttering the foil and putting a layer of nuts down, then pouring on the toffee.  Used thermometer, cooked to 300 degrees.  Will be making this alot!

I am so happy with this recipe! I followed the tips and used a heavy skillet and a flat whisk. I put a paper bag by the stove for color reference and used a candy thermometer. It seemed to hover at 260 for some time and I was nervous it would never reach 285 but as soon as it turned the color of the paper bag, it was right at 285! Perfect! No problems with separation at all. Skor is my favorite candy bar and this tastes exactly like it!

I found that the type of butter used made a huge difference.  The first time I made it, I used Land O Lakes and it came out great.  The next time, I used Kirkland brand and it separated and was a mess.  Maybe it had more water in it or something.  I wonder how it would be with a richer European butter...

I am more of a beginner cook. I am not good at knowing how to improvise. I was also nervous to try a toffee recipe, as it seemed hard to make. However, this recipe was simple and came out great. I used a large pot so I could clip my candy thermometer to the side. I followed the directions and the candy was perfect. 

I used walnuts instead of almonds, as I simply had them on hand. Still delicious!

I've been making a version of this toffee every Christmas for the last 20 years.  Invariably, the chocolate pops off of the toffee.  I followed the recipe AND the suggestions from mom2oovc and it STUCK!  Best toffee EVER!  And it really is much, much easier than my 20 year old recipe.  I especially love that you just sprinkle the chocolate chips on top and let them melt.  My old recipe had me melting chocolate separately.

Very easy.  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I used the ice water test.  It worked extremely well.  Read the reviews before making to get tips.  I also used a whisk and gently bounced it up and down against the sides of my pan to incorporate the butter and sugar.

This is amazingly tasty and super easy! I am accustomed to cooking caramel and other candies that require constant stirring. I think I over stirred mine and it did not get as brown as it should have. It was fantastic either way!

Absolutely DELISH!If the butter begins to pool on top of mixture, let it sit on the heat for a few minutes and DO NOT stir. The butter will then incorporate with the mixture.

I just tried this for the first time.  If I had known how easy this was I'd have made it YEARS ago!  Who knew butter and sugar with a dash of salt tasted so good!  Great easy recipe.

I made it just as the recipe called for.  The only thing I do different is I spread it thin to the toffee is thin instead of thick.

so easy and delicious!  If you like Score chocolate bars, than this recipe is for you!  It's absolutely delicious and so easy!  I've tried making fudge before, but I could never get it right.  I didn't think  that when I made this it would turn out since I haven't had success with candy, but it worked the first time!  I just followed other reviewers advice, and I stirred it constantly.  YUMMY, you must try this! :)

Love it! I didn't even have a candy thermometer, but with the other reviewers suggestions I could completely eyeball it and do a cold water test to create perfect toffee! I'm still working on making the perfect milk chocolate topping, since the plain chocolate chips have a dark chocolate taste. Next time I'll add more sugar and milk when I melt my chocolate. Thanks!

I cut the recipe in half and poured it into a 9x9 pan lined with non-stick foil. I went until the temp was just over 290. It was good a few hours later but still a bit chewy after refrigeration - perfect the next day!!! Addicting!!!

Somehow, I didn't find this easy. Mine came out
chewy instead of brittle, which I would have 
preferred, but the taste was delicious.

It has to get 5 stars because I was able to get it done right the first time.  Great flavor.  Took it all to work and was gone half way through my shift.

Very easy! I had no pooling problems at all! No candy thermometer either. The test was make sure it's just like it states in the recipe, a "dark amber color". Drop a little in some ice water and try a bite. If it forms a ball and you can bite it without being "sticky", then it's done! Fabulous recipe, just like my mother's!

I take it back! I just tried it again and I had MASSIVE pooling issues! The only thing I did differently this time was I cooked it on high heat the entire time instead of medium. It was very foamy throughout and rose up, almost boiling over numerous times. Next time I'll keep it on medium heat with a slow boil the entire time.

In addition to adding nuts to the top, I stir in about a cup of sliced almonds to the mixture right after I remove it from the heat and before I pour into the baking sheet.  See a photo of the bars sitting on an ocean picture to see what I mean.

I followed these directions and had my toffee come out perfectly.  I made it for my guy friend since he buys me toffee for every special occassion (which I totally don't mind).  I always avoid buying what I can make and have control over the ingredients for my loved ones and this was a perfect and super easy to make treat.  He said it was better than the candy shop's!

Wow. Have never been able to make a good toffee - until this recipe! So easy! Like others, I found in my experience it is best not to stir too often. Cook @ med heat (no higher - be patient) in heavy stainless pot and it comes out perfect - never separated. I did try 1 tsp vanilla just prior to pouring onto the sheet and it adds that perfect finishing touch. Yum! Will be making this often as gifts. Thank you!

Followed the directions closely (read lots of reviews for tips) and stirred Very slow but constantly until 290 F and it turned out Perfect.  Used white choc chips and crushed candy canes to top.  Will def be making again next Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was really simple and everyone loved it!  I used a large cookie sheet. Figuring out when the caramel is done is a little tricky but as other reviews have said, it starts to puff with smoke and it was then that it was done.  So good!

I would not call this the best toffee ever. I followed the directions to the letter and I got a strange semblance of what toffee should be. I think the general idea is ok, but I'll be doing some tweaking of my own next time.

Awesome - I love toffee and this is the best I ever had. It wasn't as hard and didn't stick to my teeth as much as commercially prepared toffee. I was a little fooled by how much time it takes (I thought it would be quick), but takes more like 45min of constant attention. I also had always been nervous about cooking anything that requires you to get to a certain temp, but this was my first try and I had success. I do suggest only a temp of 285, as I let it get a little higher and some pieces had a little burnt taste. I used a slotted spoon to stir at first to prevent the separation of the butter, and then later on used a spatula to get the sides and bottom clean on pan. I did not stir constantly but about once per minute for about 10 seconds each time. It took about 30min of a light boil to get to the right temp; The temp goes up very slowly. I did a half recipe and poured it out on a large baking sheet, and would probably use 2 sheets if I made it as written. I used mini chips for quicker melting. Do not pat the toffee with a paper towel to remove grease, as per another reviewer, you'll loose some toffee onto the papertowel. Also, don't pat the almonds down with a bagged hand, you'll loose some chocolate - instead use the back of a measuring cup. Can't wait to make again!

I've made this toffee at least 100 times. Here are my thoughts. My recipes calls for 1/3 c. water. Never use chocolate chips;2 large Hershey bars. Sliced almonds on bottom, chopped pecans on top. Don't let butter sit out; it has to come straight from fridge. I like a med. heavy pan; candy mixture has to be brought to boil quickly so a great, heavy bottomed pan throws it off.  Keep temp while cooking at med high. Cook till it just starts to smoke and is the color of a brown paper grocery bag. Keep stirring the whole time but just to keep the mixture moving, taking a few breaks. Cool at room temp, if you do it too fast the chocolate will pop off when breaking apart. Good luck!

Success! Let me start by saying I have NEVER made toffee. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of subbing half milk chocolate chips. I followed cooking suggestions from the reviews, as far as stirring periodically; not overstirring. I do not own a candy thermometer, so had to go by color and the candy/water test. It came out perfectly. Delicious! I will make this again.

Wow....Fabulous!  I followed the directions and I didn't have a candy thermometer, I went by color.  I even tasted as I went along and did the ice water test and that worked fine.  The only changes I made were adding a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and using pecans instead of almonds.  It came out perfect, no separation.  If you live in freezing temp area, just stick it outside, it'll be ready in about a half hour.  After you break it apart, don't throw away the crumbs.  Put it on top of ice cream or throw in a batch of cookie batter (I threw it in my chocolate chip cookie batter, yum!)

I should have known better.  Toffee needs to be cooked to a temp of at least 300 degrees.  I followed the recipe and my toffee never reached crack stage and whole batch was ruined.  (cloudy,gritty. and it never got hard) I will try this recipe cooked to 301 next time.

I've been looking for some easy candy recipes, and this one fit the bill. I just followed the directions, and it came out great and have now made it several times. I never even use my candy thermometer, just watch and stir until it turns a dark rich amber color. I've never made toffee before. The only thing I did differently was to toast the almonds before I added them as that brings out the flavor of the nuts. You can make it with dark chocolate if you want; we love it that way. Definite thumbs up from us! This is a great to give as a Christmas gift or to have on your Christmas candy tray. People always ask for the recipe.

So good and so easy. I am a beginner and even I was able to pull this off. After reading all of the reviews I was very confused about weather to stir occasionaly or constantly. After a little internet research....I followed the directions directly and stired occasionally. I used a heavy enameled cast iron pot- 2qt. And a wooden spon with a whole in the middle. I stired occasionally and gently. No butter separation and no burning. I tested my thermometer out on boiling water to make sure it was accurate. When the correct temp was reached I tested it out in ice water and my drop easily broke in my fingers. I did follow others suggestions and added vanilla. This has great flavor and just melts in your mouth. I wish I had added nuts to the top- very thin or powder dusting of nuts would be perfect. Going to make these for gifts for the holidays this year.

Try toasting the almonds.  and I put the almonds down before I poured the mixture onto the parchment paper, so the nuts were inside the toffee.  I finished off the remaining nuts on top.

I have made about 15 batches of this for business gifts.  Doubling the recipe worked great. I experimented with white chocolate pieces instead of semisweet chocolate...very good, and I drizzled the opposite chocolate over the finished product in thin zig-zags before breaking them up...very pretty.  Double batches are good in my wide All Clad pot.  I can't imagine making these without a thermometer. On one batch, my thermometer was malfunctioning and I think it went over 300 deg. Not good, very bad butter separation and I had to drain it off, but the candy leftover in the pot turned out OK, so don't despair.  Finally, I agree with another reviewer who cooked till 300 degrees.  It goes very quickly from 285 to 300, so I prepare to be lifting it off of the stove, getting my pot holders really close, etc.

Ok after 3 failed attempts i finally got it. For those of you like me that never make candy you need to use real butter. I was using margarine sticks and not sweet cream butter sticks. I didn't know there was a difference and it is a big difference. I used 2 sticks of sweet cream butter  salted and 1 cup sugar and left the salt out since the butter was already salted. I stirred the whole time even after it came to a boil. It took 18 minutes after the first boil and then i poured it onto a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam. Then put the chocolate chips on and they didn't sink! Woohoo. Then sprinkled on the chopped almonds. I left out on counter for 2 hours and then broke apart. It finally turned out right.

My go to recipe when I need a fast and easy toffee.  I've made this several times, had times I wasn't watching and it got a tad dark, also had times where I think I pulled it too soon and it was a tad light, but it was great all ways.  This is what I make instead of going out and buying Heath toffee bars in other recipes I use.

Very good. I used a little more salt, brown sugar instead of white sugar and then added in some Vanilla Extract. I boiled until it was soft crack stage when dropped in water. Will make this again

After reading all the reviews I thought I was prepared for what ever problem I might have...but I wasn't. Like many others some of my butter separated from the sugar when the mixture had almost reached soft crack even though I went by what I thought might be good methods to follow like, wisking constantly until the mixture boils then only stiring occasionally. At first I paniced and poured out some of the separated butter but then I remembered that the other toffee recipes I've made always had a little corn syrup in them. So I added in about a tbs of Karo and voila my mixture came back together and the rest went easy as pie. I didn't have any almonds, only pecans so I sprinkled them over the top of the chocolate and also sprinkled chopped soft peppermint over the top of half turned out great!

This toffee is incredible! It is amazing just as written, but I made a couple of changes, and it is even better than the gourmet stuff you find in the store. I skip the salt in the toffee (I always use salted butter, and the extra salt is unnecessary) After the mixture comes to a boil, I stir in a cup of slivered almonds. I use milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and chopped walnuts instead of almonds on top of the chocolate, because I already put almonds inside the toffee. After the chocolate has hardened, I add a drizzle of dark chocolate, and then another drizzle of white chocolate. The finished product is beautiful and delicious! My family cannot stop eating this, and everyone else who tries this toffee raves over it!  I  have to make about 5 batches over Christmas so that we will have enough. Thanks so much for sharing this...it is excellent!

The title says it all! Super easy and very good. I added 1/4 t salt and 1 t of vanilla after I removed it from the heat along with 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Yum!

I rarely comment on recipes, but this one deserves special mention for its ease and quality.  Easily the equal of the best gourmet toffee and I made a batch in less than half an hour.  When the butter didn't incorporate fast enough, I added one tablespoon of cold water and whisked it in - problem solved!  Thanks so much for a real "keeper!"

Fantastic!! I can't believe I have been afraid to make toffee. This is such an easy recipe and it came out perfect the first time.  It tastes like a Skor Candybar.  Definately a holiday go to recipe. Thanks:)

I made a half batch and it came out beautifully.  I did use a thermometer though and the water test to make sure it would set up properly because I don't have the best luck with candy making. This will be added to the Christmas baking list!

So easy that I thought I was messing it up!! I made the toffee in a skillet with a thicker bottom.  Let it heat slowly, be patient!  I didn't have any problems with the butter separating.  The chocolate spread so easily that I laughed!  I just cannot believe how incredibly easy this recipe is...and I barely bake anything!

YAY so easy so yummy. I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I just stopped stirring after the steady boil started. When the toffee became the color of the brown paper bag on hand, I poured it out. It's burning if the bubbles in the center are dark brown rather than amber. Spreading out the chocolate chips is so fun, haha~ So easy to make, it only took me a few minutes. Highly recommended!

Good heavens--this recipe seems like it'd be simple but I found it to be finicky. From the reviews, you can probably guess that. Stir constantly or occasionally? Cook to 285 degrees or test with water? What color should the end result be, and so on. I couldn't believe the ups and downs folks had but plowed ahead anyway in my quest to find the perfect toffee. I followed recipe to the letter and though the toffee was still butter yellow at 285 degrees, I poured anyway. Disgusting mess of separated butter and sugar. Tried again and cooked until it was an amber color (regardless of temp) and poured. Better but still really bad separation. I then went back read e-v-e-r-y single review and found one very critical one: DO NOT MAKE THIS ON RAINY DAYS. What do you know--it was pouring. So, I tried a third time on a sunny day and though the toffee was a nice amber color at 285 degrees this time and I poured into the pan at that point, the amount of liquid butter still on top of the hardening toffee was extreme and had to be sopped up w/a paper towel. I give it a 3 b/c the end taste was pretty good but I won't make it again--it's too finicky a recipe for me.

This is the best and easiest recipe yet. I have made it three times and each time, it has turned out great. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner wanted the recipe. 
PS... I used the paper bag and cold water test.... no thermometer.

This was not a good recipe for toffee.  I made it twice and both times it seperated like crazy!  It was almost as if a whole stick of butter, or maybe two, had to be poured off before I sprinkled the chocolate and nuts on top.  I tried whisking the first time, and little stirring the second.  Both times were awful.  I will never use this recipe again.

This recipe was amazing & made a huge amount, enough to share with 4 families!  The only problem I had was when I poured the mix into the pan, it began to seperate & there was a bunch of melted butter sitting on the top.  I don't know why this happened & I knew if I left it there, it would be really bad having hardened butter on top.  Underneath the butter was the toffee, beginning to harden.  So, I poured the butter off the top & then continued with the instructions & it turned out amazing.  I know it wasn't as thick as it should have been, but it was almost like it needed more sugar to mix with the extra butter.  I measured everything right, so I don't know what happened, but it turned out good.  I did add the vanilla, you can't make a toffee without vanilla!  I WILL make this recipe again!

Wish I could give this a 4-1/2 ... but as I can't ...

This was not the best toffee I've had, but was really quite good, and the small lack is made up for by the ease of the recipe.  My chocolate didn't work out quite as expected, but was okay in the end - should have waited a little longer to drop the chips on top.  My husband's big complaint was that he thinks toffee deserves better chocolate on top than the semi-sweet chips, so I will purchase some high-end candy-making chocolate for next time.  I do love the speed - this will make for a nice addition in the holiday baked goods baskets that I send!

tastes good, but i made the mistake of trusting candy thermometer (removed at 300) and not waiting until the mixture turned amber (also stirred the entire time)and it is light and not as brittle as it should be-it is also hot and humid today. still broke up well though. i used dark (70% cacao) chocolate and unsalted cashews on the top. i will try it again, stirring less, and using the candy thermometer as a guide not a governor.

*UPDATE* I made this again after not making for awhile (to many lbs gained when I made it often) but I used 1 c butter to 2 c. sugar and I think it has been my favorite yet. It is solid and brittle but has more of a true caramel flavor than a heavy butter flavor/feel. It was amazing.

Also, tips and tricks, use a wooden spoon and never leave out the salt, even if you are using salter butter!

This is a fabulous recipe. I cannot mess up making it. IT has become my default toffee recipe. I have made it as gifts for Christmas and birthdays and Tuesdays and it is great. I experiment lots. For Christmas I like using white mint and dark mint andes chips and personally I love using white chocolate chips with coconut flakes and crushed macademia to top it off. So many possibilities and always wonderful!

This was my first recipe for toffee or any kind of candy that actually came out right!  I followed the recipe except for the temp- I agree with some of the other reviewers that 295 is the best temp for this recipe.  To everyone looking for a toffee recipe- this one's the ONE!!

WOW.  I was so surprised at how easy this was.  I didn't even use a candy thermometer and it came out perfectly.  I was a little scared when I saw how easy it was.  I've never made candy before so I was pretty afraid I was gonna mess it up, especially since I don't have a candy thermometer.  I just followed the recipe exactly, and followed some tips from some reviewers (like wait till the mixture turns a little darker than peanut butter) and it turned out PERFECTLY.  And it tastes so good!  I thought it tastes exactly like the candy that comes in thee See's Candy bars.  Absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Very easy and delicious... I just wanted to update my review... I initially followed another reviewers suggestion and mixed the nuts directly into the toffee (to help contain all the nut crumbs) - it does contain the crumb mess, but it also allows the chocolate layer to show the fingerprints you leave behind after breaking the toffee into smaller pieces.  Before adding the choc chips, be sure to allow the toffee to firm up enough to keep them from sinking down to the bottom of the toffee.  Also, blot up any excess butter so the chocolate will stick better.  If the toffee cools too much to melt the chips, just pop the whole thing in a warm oven for a minute or two.  By the way, I poured the toffee onto a silicone baking sheet - absolutely no sticking at all.  Although this recipe is fine without it, I might try adding a bit of vanilla next time, as others have suggested.

I used this recipe and it came out very well. Making candy scared me for some reason, but this was relatively easy and smelled amazing. First, I made sure i measure the ingredients beforehand. Second, I added vanilla right before I poured it into the pan. I also lined the pan with aluminum foil before I poured the toffee onto it. Make sure you press the nuts into the chocolate, or else they won't stay put. You can use whatever nuts you like. I used walnuts and toasted them beforehand.

Great recipe and very quick!  If you do not use a candy thermometer, err on the side of taking the butter mixture off the heat too soon.  I think I waited a few seconds too long and it gave it a bitter taste.  Good with slivered almonds.

I, too, had the problem with the butter separating from the sugar, even though I refrained from stirring.  I cooked slowly to 300*, and poured into my foil-lined pan, and had to pour off/soak up a LOT of excess butter.  For the choc chips, I used 1/2 milk & 1/2 semi-sweet (Yowza! Great mix!) and melted them in the microwave to spread over the already cooled toffee.  But WOW!!  It still came out PERFECT!  This is some awesome toffee, taste & texture came out like it was professionally made, instead of clumsily tossed together by me... all that worrying for nuthin'.  ^_^

GREAT!  And very easy.  I recommend using a candy thermometer because it turns a dark amber color long before it reaches 285 degrees.  If you stop cooking it based on its color, it may be too chewy and/or sticky.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!  I made a different recipe first made with brown sugar; it turned out kind of grainy and tasted a little burned.  This recipe was smooth, creamy ,exactly how I expected toffee to taste.  It really tastes like a Heath Bar!  Thanks much!

I didn't use almonds, and I didn't cook this to the full temperature, instead I cooked it to just beyond the hard ball stage, stirred it while it cooled for a couple minutes, then poured it all over fresh air-popped popcorn, then stirred it around the best I could.  It's delicious!  It maybe wasn't as sweet as chocolate covered toffee, but was MUCH more filling. Great recipe!

This toffee is incredible.  I first tried this recipe at my sister-in-law's and have loved the results ever since.  I made a very small batch for our family movie night this evening.  It took a grand total of 10 minutes!

My 9 year old daughter had a craving for toffee tonight, and a quick web-search brought me to this recipe.  
I'm a 50-something dad that never makes confections, but we decided to give it a go.  Call it beginner's luck if you want, but I watched the video,  did exactly what it said, and it turned out perfect!  I didn't have a candy thermometer, it didn't sound like I had the right kind of pot (I used a Kitchen Aid hard anodized non-stick 6 qt) and if I had read the reviews before I started, I might not have tried.  This was so easy! 
I used a large silicon spatula to gently stir the mixture over medium heat the entire time, going along the sides and bottom of the pan.  My daughter actually got the peanut butter out so we could compare the color as it started to change. :)   As soon as it was the same color as PB, we poured it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (not wax paper), added the chocolate chips, sans tree nuts.  To speed up the cooling process, I added crushed ice to another same-size cookie sheet and set the cookie sheet with the toffee on top of that. It was cooled enough in about 5 minutes to put in the refer to finish hardening the chocolate (another 5 minutes).

The texture, hardness and taste of this toffee is fantastic! It breaks up easily, crunches perfectly, and doesn't stick to your teeth.  It's as good as any heath bar I've ever had.

I have been making this toffee for  years.  It certainly is not fast, but it is delicious.  There is a very fine line between being perfect, and scorched.  Everyone loves getting this in their assortment!!  From the boil point to perfection carmel color is 22  minutes on my stovetop.  Stir constantly.

I love the taste but did have to pour off about 1/2 c butter. Never had a problem with toffee recipes before but this one does call for more butter than others I've tried. I also add 1 tsp. Vanilla extract and I use Hershey chocolate bars instead of the choc. Called for
Makes it yummy!

The recipe turned out fantastic on my first attempt!  Perfect! No separation of butter, sugar---no---scorched spots!    And, no crystallization, perfect!  

Now, because I am curious and like a challenge, I did a number of  things "WRONG"!  I wanted to see if I would be successful anyway!  

I used "frozen" Costco Kirkland" salt free butter! (One person said that's why her batch did not turn out!)

It rained today (Bad news, right?)

I read many of the evaluations.  I decided to try the 300 degree F suggested temperature.  (I have a very  accurate instant read thermometer.)  

When  I MAKE this EXCELLENT RECIPE again-----I will use the 285 degree F reading as the recipe suggests.  I think this 300 Degree F  is way too brittle for my liking!  

I used a wooden spoon.  I stirred VERY little.  I use a medium temperature to cook.  My stove is a conduction model, no burned spots.  

I used a 9 X 12 cake pan lined with parchment paper to pour the toffee into.  NEXT TIME---- I would use a large lined cookie sheet (lined with parchment.)  The toffee is too thick for me!

I used Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and Cashews for  my nut preference.  Next time, I would use Milk chocolate  instead of the bittersweet, because I just do not care for the bittersweet.

Frankly, I do not see how you can fail if you use a good instant read thermometer, and follow the recipe, exactly!

I have used this recipe for 2 years now and it is wonderful.  I sprinkle sea salt on top of the toffee before the chocolate is spread and it gives it a great taste. I made this again today without a candy thermometer (we recently moved and i haven't unpacked it yet) and as long as you have patience and watch for the dark color then you are good to go!

Great recipe, easy to make. The most critical variable is temperature.  I agree that going above 285 degrees results in "tighter" toffee. I liked 295 better for nice hard crack crunch. Also, adding a touch more salt brought out the flavor, esp sea salt. I had a combo of almonds and walnuts and toasted them, for the win.

This recipes scales up beautifully. I multiplied it by six and it was perfect, plus little extra effort for the giant batch.

Lastly, when you cut up the pieces, you get a bunch of "cruft," which makes exquisite ice cream topping.

I have made this recipe dozens of times with both success and failure.  My best suggestion is to start with room temperature butter and mix with the sugar before turning on the heat.  Then, continuously stir while melting the butter.  This prevents the butter separation that happens easily.  I don't bother with a thermometer any more.  I just aim for the correct color - the same as store bought toffee candy.  If you use mini chocolate chips, it makes more divots in the toffee and it tends to stick better.  YUM!

I have been making this recipe for years, every xmas.! Every year i get requests for the recipe.It is VERY weather sensitive! I honestly have had the butter separate on me a couple of times, but all in all it is an excellent recipe. I can only recommend to choose a dry day, use a wooden spoon, and stop stirring constantly after the butter & sugar is melted. It is a rich buttery toffee that melts in your mouth. It will remain my "go to" toffee recipe! Would actually rate it 4.5 stars.

I made this and it has ruined my pan and will have to throw it out.  I cooked it until 285° and the toffee burned and the bottom inside of pan has burnt on butter and sugar and is black.  My pan is ruined, I cannot get it clean.  I stirred it occasionally and it was darker than amber and started smoking.  Perhaps my candy thermometer was not working correctly.  I used the pan that I use to make jelly and jam with and now I don't have a pan any longer.  This apparently for me was not a Super Easy recipe.  Bad experience.

A friend is always the hit of the bake sale with her toffee and refuses to share her recipe. Well, this is every bit as good as hers (and I suspect the same, because how many variations can there be). Maybe I'll make toffee for the next bake sale ... just kidding ... I'd never give it away to strangers!

Super easy. I had no prior candy making experience -- had never used a candy thermometer -- and my first batch was a complete success. I was sure I had over-cooked the toffee part, but pored it anyway. Not only was it tasty, it's very pretty. Perfect addition to holiday gift bags.

I loved this. It was really easy to make, even though I didn't have a candy thermometer. I just timed it for about 20 minutes after the butter was melted. Stirred just occasionally. Great recipe!

Tasty and very easy.  Boil and stir until it reaches 300 degrees to make it more breakable.

This recipe was so easy and I found it to be fairly forgiving. I didn't stir constantly and also added a little vanilla. It tastes amazing, breaks apart easily and stores well. Now, if I can just get it packaged up and given out this Christmas before we eat it all!

EXTREMELY DELICIOUS. I used pecans instead of almonds. I also used a 9x13 glass dish lined with foil and buttered, which I prepared before hand. You NEED to stir constantly or it will burn. and heating to 300 is also a must. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it melts in your mouth, the best toffee ever !!!

I rarely add the chocolate or almonds.  My family loves just the toffee.  It turns out perfect every time, you just have to stir, keep your eye on it, and don't turn the burner up too high.  Don't forget altitude and humidity rules.  Thank you so much!

Very easy recipe.  Used others reviews and buttered the bottom of a large cookie sheet to spread it out thinner.  Next time I'll use two large cookie sheets.  Added a teaspoon of vanilla and a little extra salt.  I used a hand mixer to blend the sugar and butter do to separation.  Will make this recipe again.

Went with the brown sugar variation recommended by a review and this is AWESOME!  I also added a touch of a high end vanilla at the end as well.  Really an easy and wonderful recipe.  And they mean it - don't keep stirring ..it doesn't need it.

I'm starting a hunt for the best toffee recipe and I used this one. I'm done. This was perfect! I did half dark & half milk chocolates. The only problem was breaking. Any hints?

This recipe made great toffee. I cut the recipe in half and added 1/4tsp of vanilla extract. I also didn't use any toppings. My only complaint is that it is a little bit too sweet on its own, so it really needs a topping. I noticed a lot of 1- and 2-star ratings on here. Most of the complaints are for it separating or being white and chewy. If its white and chewy, you haven't cooked it long enough. Don't bother with a candy thermometer (I didn't use one), but pay attention to it and turn the heat off when it reaches the color of normal toffee. Also, when you do turn it off, mix it up really well to incorporate the butter and sugar and you shouldn't experience any problems with separation.

My first time making anything like this - it was awesome! Everyone was impressed. I read many many reviews and followed the directions. My butter did separate a bit but it didn't affect the outcome at all. When I poured the toffee onto my pan, the oil ran off to the side and got left behind when it cooled and I picked it up to break it apart. Also, I had no thermometer but after about 20 minutes I dripped a bit into cold water and then fished it out with a spoon and ate it, it was crunchy and melted in my mouth. Doesn't even stick to your teeth, just melts. So easy!

I am a very experienced cook and this recipe is my Achilles heel. It has taken me as many as 5 tries before it works, although when it does, it's amazing. The only problem is that although I try all the tips in the reviews, I end up with a gritty mess that seperates at the end of the cooking process. My new thought is that I am letting it boil too hard. So, I'll probably give it one more shot because this holiday season, I've wasted 4 lbs of butter and 8 cups of sugar but I'm determined to serve this along side my New Year's eve feast.

Made this for Christmas and it turned out great!  we used pecans instead of almonds and my mom wanted the nuts in with the toffee instead of on top of the chocolate so we just put the nuts on the parchment paper then poured the toffee on top of them.  YUMMY this one has been added to my Christms candy that I make every year!

Perfect recipe...i sell this for double what it costs to make it, if not more. Ive made this about 20 times already in double batches. i just add 3 drops of vanilla and stir pretty constantly, its ok to walk away for a minute,but no more. get creative, i use slivered almonds mostly, whole on the bottom and broken up ones for the top. MAKE THIS TOFFEE! easy and perfect, just need a candy thermometer!

I have made this recipe for Christmas gifts for a few years now, it is always the hit.  Definitely use a sturdy saucepan, stir constantly until it boils, then don't stir at all until it reaches the proper temp - then give it a good stir and transfer to pan.  Yum yum!!!

Oh my Gosh!  I made this for Thanksgiving today... what a great recipe!  I used macadamia nuts instead of almonds in honor of my Hawaiian friends.  Mahalo!  (Hawaiian for Thank You!)  I followed the recipe to the letter, but I stirred constantly.  Thanks for a wonderful treat!

Okay... WAY too much butter for the sugar ratio - I wound up pouring off a ton of it. I followed the suggestion to cook to hard crack (300F) and I'm glad I did! Next time I'm going to try the Joy of Baking's ratio of 1.5c butter : 2c sugar and see how that goes.

I've made this the last few holidays and I keep getting requests for it every year.  I do add 1/2-3/4 tsp of french vanilla extract and cook it in cast iron, it seems to magically deepen the flavor.  We've also topped the chocolate layer with walnuts or broken pretzel pieces and white choc drizzle.  

This recipe is simple and delish - Thank you Funkyseamonkey! 

(I've done it with and without a candy therm, just watch for the right color, consistency and smell, it really is easy!)

I was looking for something more crumbly and buttery, sort of like an Ethel M's consistency or Enstrom's, but this was nothing like that.  It was dense, sticky and difficult to eat because it sticks to your teeth something awful.

Absolutely delicious; it is very sweet and I think would be even better with dark chocolate or half dark and half milk chocolate blended together. We will make this again and plan to make goodie bags for Christmas with this toffee in it. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This one is pretty good. I find that a pound of butter, 2 cups of sugar, 1 pound of candy quick chocolate and chopped walnuts make an excellet toffee too. Use two greased flat baking pans. I like my toffee thinner, not too thick. Def. use the water test..once it carmalizes drop a piece of toffee in a small cup of ice water and do the taste test. Make sure not too cook it too long otherwise it will burn. Layer both sides of the toffee with chocolate and walnuts after it hardens. and break into pieces.

My family and friends love this recipe, but I don't use a whole cup of nuts. I use pecans or walnuts and only about 1/3 cup at most.

UPDATE (8/22/14):  After reading a phenomenally simple recipe online, I decided to go with my gut and try this toffee again.  You don't need a candy thermometer!  I've made this twice now with great success, after having a butter-covered mess the first time.

I put in my butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla, and cranked up the heat to medium-high.  I stirred gently and constantly, from the outside in to incorporate any lingering butter around the edges.  When it starts to smoke and it's a dark toffee color, it's done, no thermometer necessary.  It only takes about 12-15 minutes to get to this point.  I used milk chocolate and chopped pistachios and the result is outstanding, and no butter separation.  If you've failed before, try it again, if I can do it anyone can.

Super easy! 1st time making it and I got to impress my hubby again! :)  Butter-Sugar-Salt & stir frequently (not constantly) until the mixture turns a nice brownish color (I was thinking cookie dough color).  Line a jelly roll pan (9x13) with parchment and poor in the mixture and spread evenly.  Top with chocolate chips and let them melt a minute or so and then add your nuts.  Gently pat the nuts/chips into the mixture and chill in the fridge for at least an hour! So easy! Can't believe I pay like $20 for this at the chocolate stores.  Oh, and I used chopped macadamia nuts - YUM-E!!!!

This is a gerat recipe. I have never made toffee before and it turned out perfect.  My butter started to seperate too, and I thought it might be because I was whipping it too much. I just started to stir it a little and the butter remixed. When I was finished I read some more reviews and found out that was just what others had said. I guess I better read the reviews first next time I try a recipe. Thank you for the great recipe.

The taste was truly wonderful, but I was not successful in texture. Please use high quality ingredients. I used generic butter (to save cost) and it was a disaster!What a shock.

I like to use 1/2 C vanilla sugar and 1 1/2 C raw sugar.  I clean a vanilla bean putting the good stuff in the pan along with the bean that comes out when it's done.  I top w/ good sea salt (fleur de sel) after the chocolate has hardened.   

As others said 300f is fine, After it reaches 285 I watch for the color and smell to change, then I know it's done. 
 
Go slow using no more than medium heat, slowly turning up if needed to get those last few degrees after a good boil.

Very buttery and good tasting; however, I thought it was too thick.  Next time I make it I'll use a jelly roll pan and a little more chocolate to cover the top.  Also, I didn't place chocolate on the bottom, but sprinkled on the top right after pouring into dish, then waited a few minutes till I could spread it out.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

This was great! I suggest a candy thermometer versus the cold water test as I was likely a little shy of the 300 degree temperature for perfect brittleness, but it was delicious. I made it without nuts due to an allergy, and added a teaspoon of vanilla as others suggested. This is a keeper!

This is perfect and so easy - I followed directions exactly and it was perfectly crisp, 285 was the right temp for me to make it brittle - but I did check it with the cold water test. So easy and addictive!

Fantastic! Was craving toffee and this one hit the spot! I didn't have a candy thermometer so I used the iced water test - worked great! (After toffee turns an amber color while boiling, drop a bit into the water, and if you pull it out and it's brittle - it's ready!) I stirred the entire time the mixture was coming to a boil to prevent burning, and to prevent butter from seperating. Oh, and if you don't have one, get a Pampered Chef Mix 'n Scraper for this task - it works GREAT!!

Great recipe. It's a good idea to use a candy thermometer to make sure you do not overcook the toffee mixture. My first batch (w/o a thermometer) turned out ok, but a little burnt. Second batch (w/thermometer) turned out perfect.

YUM!  I used pan toasted pecans instead.  Chopped them up fairly small and generously sprinkled on non stick foil.  Poured toffee over and then more nuts on top. Going to try with bittersweet chocolate next time  YUM!

Absolutely awesome.  First time I made this it took forever becasue I stirred constantly and briskly.  I just made a second batch and it took about a third of the time because I stirred slowly.  This is what I am making for Christmas gifts this year.

Butter separated.  Ran the temperature up to 300.
Poured the entire pan into the cooling pan.  Poured off excess butter.  This is probably a very good recipe.  Unfortunately... I am not a confectioner.

My sister has made this toffee for me as a gift and both my partner and I have fallen in love with it.  We both love toffee and this stuff is the best we've ever tasted!
I tried the recipe for the first time today and am amazed at how easy it is.

I just made this tonight, unfortunately without the chocolate or almonds. The toffee was still really good on it's own. I had made it at 1:30 am, so couldn't run to the store, so I made do with what I had. I followed some of the other tips here, and also added a small amount of amaretto flavouring, just to spice things up a bit. My husband, who usually can't eat hard candies, is still sitting there licking the toffee chunks to death! Thank you very much for the awesome recipe!

EDIT: I made this again for a family reunion about 2 weeks ago, this time using a little vanilla extract, and actually having the chocolate. It was a hit! I even had people tell me that they hadn't had it in years, and that it was something their grandmother used to make. I will definitely be making this many times, for years to come.

USE A THERMOMETER!  That's the only advice I can offer!  It turned out wonderful...not greasy at all.  I used sliced almonds, and sprinkled half of them on my sheet pan (lined with a Sil-pat mat) so that some of them would get into the toffee part.  I followed the instructions for the cooking, as well as for how to coat it with chocolate...I used dark chocolate chips and sprinkled the remaining almonds on top.  DELICIOUS!

I have had problems with the butter separating so I use .5 tsp lecithin. And, I never make this on a rainy day.  When I pour the toffee onto the pan and spread the melted chocolate chips, I score it to make it easier to break apart.  I have to limit how often I make this - it's my new favorite recipe.

I had never made toffee i my life, in fact, I have been terrified. The week of Christmas I had a craving for toffee. I didn't have a candy thermometer, but I decided to risk it and used this recipe. It was the best toffee EVER! Super easy and didn't take very long. I just paid attention to the color and it was perfect!

This couldn't be any easier or more delicious!!  One recipe makes quite a bit.  We toasted our whole almonds at 350 for 10 minutes before chopping them.

This was definitely a two person job! As suggested by other reviewers, I added a cup of sugar (so, 2 white and one brown) to balance out the excess butter- this worked quite well. I didn't have to soak up any excess at the end this way, as I had to do with a previous batch with the 2/2 ratio.  It heated evenly and incorporated well; I used a le creuset dutch oven, nice and heavy, and a wire whisk.  For the nuts I used salted mixed nuts (macadamia, cashew and almond) chopped- the salt was a nice counterpoint to balance the sweetness of the candy. One note (and this is no fault of the submitter, but a tactical error on my part) because I added a cup of sugar, I should really have used a much larger cookie sheet to allow it to spread out evenly- thus, my edges of the cookie sheet had the consistency of heath bar, and the center the consistency of praline.  For flavor, and for ease, this truly deserves 5 stars, but the butter sugar ratio error made me rate it a 4. Just the same, I will make this over and over, and I'm grateful for the recipe!

Woo Hoo!  Just took the first nibble of this toffee and it's incredible!  I usually have bad luck with candy making, but this was easy and produced better than expected results.  I have an ancient, temperamental gas stove and I didn't have a heavy bottom pan, so I put my flimsy sauce pan in my cast iron skilled to diffuse the heat and it worked like a charm.  Also I didn't have a candy thermometer, but my meat thermometer and the water test worked just fine.

OH. MY. GOD.  I have never made candy of any kind (unless you count fudge which is a crapshoot as far as whether it turns out great or gross).  I was scared to death to try this but figured I'd give it a shot.  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Stirred the mixture constantly while it was melting, then almost constantly after it came to a boil.  It turned out perfect!!!!  I was so concerned that the caramel wasn't going to harden but it did!!!! It is beautiful and delicious!!!  Merci!!!  Merci!!!  Merci!!!  My family could not believe that I made this.

Wow...this was my training wheels with candy, wonderful, easy, and so tasty.  I made mine in a 9x13 pan, would not recommend, came out pretty thick for the toffee portion.  And whatever you do, do not lick the spoon.  Thanks for providing this, great gift for my 6 months to the dentist!  RAVE reviews.

I have made a similar recipe many times.  It definitely needs to cook to 300 degrees.  I have even found it's better to go just a shade higher (302).  I still have trouble getting it to turn out right sometimes.  If it hasn't turned an amber color it's not going to turn out right.  An excellent combo for toffee!  Pouring it onto buttered parchment paper makes it easier to deal with.  I put chocolate and crushed almond slices on both sides of the toffee.

I made this twice. The first time I burnt it. The next batch I brought to 300 degrees over medium heat. I removed it from the heat and stirred until it combined (it had separated), which took several minutes. Then I poured onto a foil lined cookie sheet. It came out pretty good.

WOW- this recipe is so easy and simple and GREAT! You do not even need a candy thermometer- just stir frequently (but not non-stop- give it a little rest in between) and it will be done when the sugar-butter mixture gets foamy, light brown and kind of pulls away from the pan. You will just kind of know. Just make sure you don't burn it. Turned out perfect both times I have made it.

This was so good, I did not have any trouble with it separating, and I did what some of the others said and I stirred it off and on. After I put the chocolate on the top, and spread it around,  I had crushed some candy canes in the food processor and put them on half the melted chocolate and the other half I had chopped some pecans and put them on the other half, and pressed each down, I cooled it in the fridge.  I will make this again and it will make great gifts, will be sending my husband to work with some tomorrow!

I cooked to about 285 and did a water test and it was brittle enough for me.  Melts in your mouth!!  To make it slightly prettier I put on milk chocolate disks and then sprinkled some white ones on top of that.  Once all the chocolate had melted enough, I took a steak knife (anything small would do) and inserted the tip into the white dot of chocolate and pulled out and around and it created a paisley pattern.  Very pretty.  Tried it when it finally cooled completely...AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH :-)

LOVED making this. I read all the reviews before making the toffee. The recipe itself is excellent. The BEST advice given here is to use a whisk until the mixture starts boiling. The butter and sugar never separated on me. After that, whisk about every 5 minutes on medium low to medium. I added a teaspoon of vanilla while melting the sugar and butter together instead of adding it at the end of the boiling time as with traditional candymaking. What a delight this toffee is - I have no doubt I will be making it again and again and again!

It worked the 2nd time!! My first effort was a disaster as I used high butter fat organic butter and organic sugar cane thinking better ingredients, better taste. Unfortunately, I stirred the whole time as some recommended and it separated terribly. Tried water but not great. My thermometer may have been the problem also as it said it was 300 and no amber color.  I tossed and went to the butter from the freezer and granulated sugar. Only occasionally stirred it and didn't use the thermometer. I waited until the color was right and poured it in the pan. When I saw some separate melted butter I was scared, but decided to pour it off and hope for the best. Well, it is delicious and is beautiful with chopped bittersweet chocolate and ground almonds. A great taste and very smooth. Thank you all for your ideas. This finally worked for me!

This toffee is excellent! Toffee is now my favorite christmas candy since I made this recipe! I halved it and it still turned out perfect (half made about a 9x13) Then I sprinkled with toasted and chopped pecans. Yum!

I love this toffee but I have made a few revisions that I have found really make all the difference between it being good to excellent. Once you met the butter, and add the sugar/salt, add 2 tablespoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. Also add 1/3 of the sliced almonds to the sugar/butter to give the toffee a bit more crunch. It was a great success with my families.

Excellent!  Just finished a batch - very first ever!  I can already tell from the residual in the pan that it is the perfect consistancy. Super easy - used a nylon gravy whisk (pampered chef or similar) and it kept the butter from separating! Will be making more - THANK YOU for sharing!

This recipe tastes great!  Next time I think I'll try it with pecans as I think they'd be more flavorful.  I also used bittersweet dark chocolate and that was really good.  But I did have to make this recipe twice as the butter separated the first time.  The only thing I changed was instead of stirring the whole time I just stirred until the boil, then occasionally after the boil like the recipe said to do.  And it worked!  I was worried about burning it the first time so stirred the whole time.

I'll give this 5 stars with a caveat.  If you aren't used to working with hot sugar, this can be tricky.  Took me two tries to get it right, and with a pound of butter, it's a bit of an expensive disaster if it goes wrong.  I'd definitely recommend a candy thermometer.  And don't let it get too hot.  The first time mine hit about 315-320 and it immediately separated, and there was no saving it, despite other reviews tips to add bits of water, etc.  I had to pour it out, let it hard and throw it out.  The second time I dumped it out at about 305 (I was afraid 285 wouldn't be crunchy enough) and it was perfect.    I topped with chopped milk chocolate bark, as in my experience chocolate chips are not ideal for melting.  The candy melting disks (Wilton makes them, for example) are probably the perfect thing to go on top.  I also let the toffee harden up just a bit before I put the chocolate on - about 3 minutes or so.  The toffee was still plenty hot to melt the chocolate, but it didn't sink in.

I recommend getting to a higher temp than 285. Good toffee, but mine didn't get crunchy at 285. It was soft and chocolate chips sunk in.

If you've never made candy before - this recipe is for YOU!  So, so easy and VERY yum!  It's very easy to half the recipe, too.  Just pour it on a baking sheet and cover with the chocolate.  It just won't go all the way to the edges.  Don't bother changing a thing with this recipe.  You don't need to.  Mmmm....time to get me another piece! :)

This was my first time making toffee, and it was amazingly easy.    First off, I dont have a candy thermometer so I didnt monitor the temperature at all, but I do bake often so I had an okay idea of where it was at. I had no separation after the mixture started to boil, and I turned the heat down to low instead of keeping it at medium. At first I stirred constantly until it came together, then stirred frequently (a few times a minute.) I did the iced water test to see if it was done, poured it in a foil lined pan, then when it started to get cool poured already melted chocolate over it. I used chopped macadamias because I ran out of almonds.     I would definitely make it again.

Oh.My.Goodness!  I could not stop eating this!  My chocolate layer was pulling away from the toffee layer, but regardless it was the best toffee I've ever eaten!  Next time I'm making quite a bit more to break into tiny pieces to freeze for use in cookies and such.  Thank you so much!  Next Christmas this is going to be given out as presents!

I had been given some homemade toffe as a gift severall years ago and just fell in love.  I had always liked toffee candy bars, but this toffee was special.  I found this recipe and am completely ruined for commercial toffee.  This recipe is so good and so easy, I can't stop getting requests for it.  I follow the instructions exactly and if you don't stir it too much close to the end, it will turn the beautiful golden brown color you want.  It is delicious and makes people think it's a lot harder than it really is!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. The texture of the toffee was perfect - crunchy, but not so hard that you're risking an emergency trip to the dentist. I did switch it up a little to suit what I was looking for. I made the toffee (butter, sugar, salt) as directed, spread and let cool. It looked a little oily, so I just patted it with a paper towel once it had hardened a little. I broke the toffee into two-bite pieces, then tossed the pieces in confectioners sugar, then dipped in melted chocolate candy coating and let cool. The result was what my family called "homemade Heath bars".

Excellent. I cant seem to remember which store bought heavenly toffee these match upto but when I remember the name I'l definitely put it here!!  I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I wasn't sure if this would work out fine for me. But the best bit is, it so totally did! I went by the colour. I kept stirring (no constantly and yet not occasionally) and I let the sugar and butter froth up and melt. I kept it on low flame, and stirred it until it was dark amber in color. After which I put a few drop of toffee into a bowl of ice water. They were exactly right not super brittle but not soft and chewy. So I poured it out into my already foiled baking sheet. Immediately sprinkled it with semi sweet chocolate chips, waited for a few seconds and spread it all over the toffee equally. then i put almond shavings over it, let it cool and then refrigerated it. This is truly easy!!  Oh btw, I did skip the salt and I didn't add any essence. It doesnt need it! :) If you dont try this, you dont know what you're missing out on!!

Excellent toffee!  Just like my Grandma's...patience is the key, it take much longer than the 15 minutes the recipe suggests. Mine boiled more than 15 minutes alone. Was helpful in the other reviews to not stir once it is boiling.  Go for color first then temperature to know when done.  My thermometer was 285 degrees long before the amber toffee color developed.  I used an entire bag of semi-sweet chocolate per batch. Again, patience when smoothing out the chocolate and it will swirl and cover beautifully.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Delicious, very simple to make. Warning: a half batch makes a full 9 x 13 cookie sheet, so you'll have a lot of toffee on your hands with a full batch.

I had never made any kind of hard candy in my life.  This recipe looked so easy when I read it-- then I read the reviews which made it sound so difficult to get right.  I decided to try it anyway.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it came out PERFECTLY!  I highly recommend this one.

UPDATE (9/08/11)--The first time i made this recipe, I used margarine--and what a difference real butter makes.  I recommend doing the water test instead of relying solely on a thermometer; drop a little in cold water and if it's hard and cracks, it's done; if it is chewy, it's not done yet.  You also really do need a cast iron to cook this properly.  Stir this minimally, although you do have to stir to prevent scorching towards the end.  I made half a batch and just poured it out on a 9x13 foil lined sheet, and it spread to a great thickness. When you drop the chips straight onto it, it can sometimes make divets into the toffee, so if you are all about presentation, you may want to melt your chocolate in the microwave before spreading. 
Love toffee and this a great recipe!  I did cook it to 300 degrees like one of the reviews suggested because i like a harder toffee.  Will definately make again because the first two batches dissappeared!

Tastes quite good...this is hard like MacIntosh Toffee.  I used all chopped/crushed pecans and I used milk chocolate chips. There is quite a bit of toffee left in your mouth though as you are chewing and it gets harder and harder as you chew and you end up with a little ball of hard candy in your mouth.  I want to figure out how to make this a bit softer and more brittle and not so grainy and hard.

I made this today and I had butter seperation problems, too, which I didn't expect. I wonder if it has to do with salted/unsalted, or brand? I was using Tillamook unsalted butter. When I poured the toffee out there was just a giant pool of butter on top, which messed up the chocolate. Eventually I poured a bunch off, but now that the toffee is cooled I have a layer of butter on top of the chocolate, which isn't very appetizing! However, since most people didn't have the butter problem I'm guessing it was either something I did (and I *did* accidentally let the mixture get past 300 degrees, although I'm not sure my thermometer is entirely accurate) or it was the butter. I will CERTAINLY be trying this again and again until it comes out perfect. Next time I'm going to try Tillamook salted butter and watch the thermometer and the mixture like a hawk. If it still sperates I'll try a different brand of butter.   Anyway, the stuff tastes great - I LOVE toffee.

This is fantastic; better than any Heath or Skor, that's for sure! Like other posts, I made mine in a heavy bottom stainless skillet/sautee pan. I had no issues with burning or separating, and I only stirred about once a minute, so not exactly constantly. I recommend adding vanilla and a little more salt (I added about 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt)and toasting the almonds before chopping. Also, make sure to sprea the toffee evenly in the pan to cool otherwise, like me, you'll end up with pieces of varying thickness. Will make again for sure! Delicious!

This was so easy! This was the first time I have ever made toffee. I put the chocolate chips on top with nuts, when I went to break it up later the chocolate came of the top on some pieces,is this normal? Anyway, it was yummy!

I loved this recipe! I found it easy even though I don't own a candy thermometer. I just used the water test, where you drop a bit of the toffee in a cup of water and if its brittle then its done. I gave it out as gifts and everyone loved it! My husband ate all the leftovers in just a couple days :)

Yum - rave reviews by the whole family!  When the mixture comes to a boil don't stir anymore!  I didn't use the chocolate layer and the recipe came out great.  Other than that, I used pecans instead of almonds.

This toffee is INSANE!!!!  Wow!  I made 2 batches - one w/ chocolate and almonds on top and the other with pecans inside the toffee and chocolate on top.  For my first batch I started on medium (5 on my stove) and it started to separate so I turned the heat down to med-low(3) and didn't stir as much.  I just tried to "pull" the butter in from the sides gently.  For the next batch, I cooked it on med-low the whole time.  I stirred it a lot at the very beginning until the butter melted and was all incorporated, but then I just moved the whisk very slowly around the edge of the pan, taking about 5 seconds to go all the way around.  I did this continuously for the remainder of the time and it didn't separate a bit.  I used both the temp and water method to get to the right stage.  In my opinion, the temp just gives you a rough idea of when to start testing it in the water (around 290).  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!  It tastes exactly like Almond Roca to me!!

I have made this two times and the first time I cooked it until the temperature was 285 like the recipe states. It set up, but wasn't crunchy. The second time I cooked it until the temperature was 295 and it turned out perfect. Both times I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar. I also put almonds on half and left the other half without. Very yummy either way.

Easy and very, very yummy. Using the buttered tin foil was a great idea for no mess, easy clean-up. No need to take to 300. 285 was fine and did the job. I used dark chocolate chips, only had 2 cubes butter on hand, so used that with 2 cubes margarine. Used walnuts. Will be making this again!

This was my first attempt at toffee.  I halfed the recipe in case it was terrible.  I did add about 1t vanilla.  I used a skillet.. it was all I had.  I followed the directions to stir constantly.   It turned out GREAT!   I don't have a thermometer either, so I dropped a but into a glass of cold water.  It set right up, so I knew it was done.  It took about 10 minutes of prep and about 20 minutes in the fridge before we dove in.  I am thrilled with this recipe!  Thank you for a new favorite!

This is my second year in a row with this amazing recipe.  This year, I decided I wanted to cut a few calories, so I tried this recipe with the "splenda blend" which is half sugar half splenda.  Amazing.  better than the full sugar recipe.  You use only one cup of the splenda blend with the two cups of Butter.  same cooking instructions.  Melts in your mouth.

Very easy to make. I have never made toffee, nor have I used a candy thermometer before, and it turned out on my first try! It was a hit with everyone who tried it, so I will definitely be making it again. :)

This came out really great, very quick and easy too! I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the sugar mixture just before taking it off the stove. I also greased the pan and the parchment paper to prevent sticking, and I used my enamel over cast iron pot to cook this in. 
my husband loved this. Tastes like a heath bar!

Very delicious and indeed, very easy!  My guy wanted something sweet and I didn't want to spend time baking.  This toffee came together in a snap and he really liked it.  I did use peanut instead of almonds.  I just pressed them into the toffee before spreading the chocolate on top.

I changed up the nuts a bit. I toasted the almonds in a 250 oven, tossing every once in a while until they took on a toasty color. I then pressed them into the chocolate. It gives the toffee a somewhat smokey taste. Not too overbearing, just enough.

My sister and I made this toffee without a candy thermometer.  Instead, we used the cold water test.  The butter separated from the sugar a bit during the cooling process, but the toffee turned out delicious!  We will definitely use this simple recipe over and over again.

I made this twice and both times it didn't work.  I have made toffee before, not this recipe, but another and I am going back to that one.  I hate giving negative reviews, but I am disappointed that I went through two pounds of butter.  The entire thing seperated.  This first time I followed the recipe to a tee and the second I followed the reviews.

This recipe is excellent. I actually found the same recipe on another website that was the same as this one but halved. I made it halved! I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract after it was done cooking and it seemed best at 300 degrees! I can't stop eating it!! Definately a keeper for the holidays or any time!

This was very easy to make and tastes delicious! I don't have a candy thermometer so just judged by the color as other reviewers suggested; when it was slightly darker than peanut butter. I didn't stir constantly but stirred more often than not. I'm taking what I haven't eaten into my co-workers tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll eat it all! Thanks for the recipe.

Really good, but tooo much butter, by like 1/4 of a cup, after I poured it in the pan to cool there was a lot of butter pooled around the edge of my toffee.  It didn't ruin it but it was messy to deal with.  Another tip, let the toffee cool and wipe off excess butter, and then poor the chocolate pre-melted over, it helps it stick better.

Just as the name says...best ever and super easy!  I broke my candy thermometer so I just went by the colour of the mixture and when it was dark amber I poured it out to cool.  As other reviewers have suggested...don't stir the mixture until closer to the end of cooking.

I made a couple of batches around X-Mas. Wonderful, classic toffee taste...But you MUST take it to 300 degrees or else you wont get that flaky, crunchy texture that is a traditonal toffee - which is what you want. 285 degrees gives you the absolute wrong texture. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious. I've found that if you cook it until it reaches 285 degrees,you end up with a pale,slightly grainy candy that's less crunchy but good nonetheless. If you take it up to 300 degrees,you get a smooth,dark amber colored crunchy candy. I topped mine with semisweet chocolate and toasted cashews. It tasted just like those Skor candy bars I used to eat as a kid. When the butter separated from the sugar,I finished cooking it,poured it into the pan,waited a couple of minutes,and carefully poured off the extra butter. I blotted the top with a paper towel,added the toppings and it set up just fine.

I'm glad I heeded mom200's suggestion to test the thermometer in boiling water as I discovered mine is basically useless now. Using the ice water method to test for the crack stage worked well in lieu of using a thermometer. I also followed her other directions but found that after the mixture became peanut butter-like in color I need to stir until it reached it reached the proper stage. The end result was delicious. I would however, recommend toasting whichever nut you use prior to adding to chocolate layer.

LOVE this! Make it every holiday and people can't stop eating it. I use a bit of brown sugar in place of the white.

Yes, it can seem a bit greasy but not too bad--it's a rich candy, people! I use parchment paper. It tastes like Almond Roca for those of you who have tried that.

To make this recipe crisp, we take it to 295 degrees.  It really disappears at parties!

This recipe is really good, i have made toffee before, this is as good as any other if not better. Like the first review i like to add slivered almonds to the bottom of my baking dish, and then again on top. Also while cooking i put almonds in ... it really brings out the flavor. Like the second review I suggest getting your pan ready and chocolate and nuts measured. Also i add vanilla and almond extract. Unlike the last review before mine i suggest you stir constantly, and make sure its a dark brown. Also doing the ice water test works just fine. I made mine without a thermometer.

I've now made this recipe three times in one week.  It gets better each time.  I halfed the ingredients to make a smaller batch which worked well.  Sets to the perfect consistency (not too soft, and not teeth breaking hard) when cooked to "just right."  The just right stage did take me a couple of times to figure out as I don't have a candy thermometer.  Will continue to make this recipe as it's a hit among all who taste!

It took 3 tries, but I finally got it right! I discovered it was best if I did not stir it very often. Also, wait until it is a DARK amber color. Then I added a touch of vanilla. Wonderful!!

Superb toffee.  I have been looking for this recipe for years.  It is the easiest toffee recipe my sister and I have tried and it tastes fantastic.  We chopped almonds and spread those on parchment paper before pouring the toffee mixture as suggeted in a previous review.  We used finely choppd pecan on top.  However, the nuts are not what make this recipe.  We did not vary from the critical elements of this recipe and everything worked like a charm.  WARNING: This toffee is incredibly addictive. Enjoy!

Tasty.  Seemed there was way too much butter though.  It did separate and I tried using some water and putting it on a low heat, but it still wouldn't come together. I did what another user said and poured out some of the excess butter.  After it was cool you could  still see the butter in a layer on top of the toffee.  Not good!  :-(

I've never made any candy before, but this recipe really was SUPER easy!  Used a Walmart thermometer and it came out perfectly, I just broke it up and tasted it.... YUM!  I would suggest using a non-stick pot (I have an all clad), they tend to heat better.

Very tasty, I think this recipe is better than the store candy bars.  I poured the cooked mixture into a greased glass 13x9 pan and really liked the way it turned out.  The toffee ended up just about a 1/4 inch high, then with the chocolate and nuts on top it was a bit higher.  It did take about 20 minutes to boil to 270 degrees, and another 5 minutes for it to actually reach closer to 285.  I took it off a bit before 285 because I could tell it was burning a bit on the bottom.  Still was great!  I will use this many a time!!  Thanks!

This recipe comes out delicious and is very easy to make. I let the temperature get up to 300 degrees (hard crack) and it came out perfect. You must stir constantly to avoid burning.

This toffee is excellent and it really is super easy!  I had never made candy of any type before although I bake lots, but this toffee turned out perfect the first time.  I had to hide some from my husband or he would have eaten it all up!

I just made this and it turned out great.  I actually made 1/4 a batch, I needed some toffee bits for another recipe.  I didn't have the toffee so I thought I'd just whip some up and it turned out great.  Just be sure to watch it carefully, it will only take a few minutes after boiling before it starts to burn.

Sooo good and sooo easy!  Can't believe how simple and tasty this was.  Didn't have a candy thermometer, just stirred until light brown, approx. 15 minutes at a boil.  Great for holidays!

I absolutely love this recipe!!! It was super simple and came out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and as soon as the thermometer reached 285 I poured it onto the pan. It has the perfect buttery flavor and texture. Not too dense or sticky. I did add a little more chocolate chips than the recipe called for because I love chocolate. Everyone raved about it. You do have to stir it constantly. Thanks so much.

This toffee is absolutely delicious.  I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe from the girls in the office!  However.... when I made it the 2nd time the butter separated from the sugar, the consistency became thin and it turned very VERY dark at about 280 degrees.  Never even reaching 285.  What did I do wrong the 2nd time??

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It turned out wonderfully!  I think that I'll leave the almonds out or reduce the amount next time though, as I think they masked the deliciously buttery taste of the toffee.  Thanks FunkySeaMonkey for a wonderful recipe!

hmmmm. . . i don't know about this recipe. for one, half of the butter separated from the sugar. i had to pour it off at the end! the toffee itself tastes slightly bitter or burnt, although that could be my fault, and with the chocolate it's not as noticable.  the toffee has a strange texture that dissolves while chewing. maybe it would be helpful if the recipe was more specific about stirring? i wish toffee was this easy to make!

I have made this toffee for years before I ever saw it here.  If it separates—keep stirring—it will come back together.  It can scorch easily and requires constant stirring.  I also add sliced almonds to the toffee.  Great and easy to make for cookie and candy platters.

Definitely watch the video first, gives you tips that will avoid you from ruining the first batch or 2.   Like the butter thing- if you stir in the same direction the butter will not separate. 
Do not use a 13x9 baking pan, use a cookie sheet. The 13x9 pan makes it wayyyy too thick. 
Also, takes a lot longer than 15 min to cook. The video even says can take as long as 20-30 minutes. Not a big deal, but when it's taking a lot longer you think you've done something wrong. 
And the temp should be somewhere between 285 and 300. 
Flavor is good and using milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet makes it a whole lot better.

Excellent recipe. I tweaked it a bit. I cook mine to about 295 , otherwise it seems a bit chewy and grainy. After pouring toffee on cookie sheet and allow to cool for about five minutes. I microwave chocolate chips to melt and then spread on toffee, it spreads more evenly and I found that if you put chips on the toffee it sometimes pits and sinks into toffee. I use wax paper to help press almonds into chocolate so I don't "lose" quite so many when breaking apart. Hope my hints are helpful.

I recently made some peppermint bark that turned out OK, so I thought I'd give this a try.   I only made a half batch of it but it turned out great.

Did a couple of things differently.   I used walnuts instead of almonds and used a mini-cuisinart  (thanks to my daughter for that little machine) to chop them up fine.  From another recipe I saw that folks sometimes put the nuts into the mix after it started boiling.  So I put about 1/4 cup in at that point.  I also used 53% cacao dark chocolate instead of the  chocolate labeled semi-sweet - that was a good choice.

 My stove is an electric and it runs hot, so I boiled the butter, sugar, and salt combination on #4 which would be the equivalent of a medium setting on any other stove.  I stirred it a lot until it started boiling and then only stirred it occasionally.  I watched the thermometer until it hit 285° and then poured it out on a cookie sheet with parchment paper on the bottom.   With a half batch there is not enough mixture to fill a cookie sheet.  Fills most of it but doesn't get to the corners.

I then poured the 53% cacao Nestle's dark chocolate morsels on top and let it stand for a minute or two before using a spatula to spread it over the  toffee.  I found that I had to use the entire 10 oz. bag of morsels to cover it completely instead of the anticipated 8 ounces.  I next poured the rest of the chopped walnuts  (about  3/4 cup) over the chocolate and gently pressed them into the chocolate using a plastic bag over

Disaster! My butter and sugar separated worse than a tabloid-ready hollywood romance. I continued to keep it on the heat and stir which only seem to make things worse as the butter pooled above a messy glob (albeit an "Amber colored" glob). Per another reviewer (bless you) I threw in a tablespoon of water (and then another), took it off the heat, and stirred like my life depended on it. The toffee reconstituted, I topped it with chocolate and SUCCESS, I have officially faked my way into toffee making.

I made this without any problems and this is my first attempt at making candy. I followed another reviewers suggestion and it worked perfectly. 1) Keep the temp on medium at all times from beginning to end and you will not have any issues with burning. I have an electric stove top and set it to 4.  2) use a cast iron skillet to ensure even heating. 3) use a wooden spoon, 4) do NOT still constantly. I stirred twice around the pan about every 2 minutes and 5) cook to hard crack stage. I do not have a candy thermometer. I test it by dropping a 1/2 teaspoon in a 1/2 cup of water. If the drop is hard to touch, then it's ready to pour into your greased pan. I used Pam to spray my pan. I did not use aluminum foil. Happy cooking!

This recipe turns out perfect every time!  I make it every year at Christmas and it’s always a hit. Be mindful to not scrape the sides of the pan while cooking as the crystals will ruin the batch and I always use a wooded spoon. Also, I had to substitute white chocolate because that’s all I had on hand and man, was it good!  I also prefer pecans over almonds.

WARNING: Do not make this unless you have friends and family to share with, as this toffee has a way of breaking even the most determined will power.

I do tweak this recipe. Stirring seems to be debated when making toffee. I use a silicone spatula and stir constantly before the mixture boils, then use the spatula sparingly to "turn" the toffee from the sides and bottom. Also, I do not cover both sides of the toffee with chocolate, as it tends to be overwhelming.  I make my topping by laying out parchment on my baking sheet then spreading  finely grated almonds (i use a rotary cheese grater) then a layer of gharadeli mini semi-sweet morsels (and sea salt). The molten toffee will melt the chips and the weight will help the almond stick to the chocolate. I also add some vanilla extract right before pouring it onto the chocolate, and as mentioned, sea salt which adds a little more complexity.

This turned out fabulous. Took it to work and everyone loved it. I really didn't bother with the temperature as it reached over the limit before it turned a nice amber color. Just cooked the mixture on medium (boiling) and stirred continuously until it was thoroughly combined and a nice amber color. Carefully took it off the stove and poured into a parchment paper lined baking sheet. I will do this again and am going to try some flavoring variations (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) Also, it is quite inexpensive to make. Two pounds of toffee as delicious as this is would certainly cost $ 25.00 at a specialty store.

Excellent and easy.  I halved the recipe for the first try so if it didn't work out...I'm not out the larger amount of ingredients!  I would recommend using a candy thermometer for sure.  Do not rely on the 15 minutes cook time.  I believe the people who gave this recipe bad reviews simply didn't cook it to the proper temperature, and that's critical for any type of candy.

Toffee is good but the pan size is to small and the toffee comes out a little thick. Next time I will use a little bigger pan. Everyone loved it

Wow!  My first attempt...and this one is a keeper!  After reading tips in the other reviews, I agree that 1) invest in a decent candy thermometer 2) cook the mixture to the hard ball stage at 300-310 degrees 3) if cooking on an induction range like me, make sure your candy thermometer isn't affected by the magnetism in the cooking element.  Luckily mine worked perfectly 4) stir regularly but not constantly once the mixture boils 5) buy sliced almonds and pulse them through a chopper or mini food processor for perfectly sized almonds!

I love this. Easy and delicious. WATCH THE TEMPERATURE. The toffee cooks fast from 250 degrees to 285 so you've got to keep your eyes glued to it or it'll have a burnt, overcooked taste. I chop my almonds well, unlike the picture which enables the almonds to stick to the chocolate better.

I made this using my heavy cast iron dutch oven on the stove top, so easy and SO good! I stirred the entire time, and it was PERFECT, I used Ghirardelli dark melting wafers for the topping, could not taste better.  I have not made candy since I was a teen 30 plus years ago...if I can do it you can do it,

Both ways are delicious.   I made the original version and then gave into peer "review" pressure and cooked it to 300 and stirred constantly.  Both batches are the same, simply delicious.   Not sure what kind of butter people used but mine didn't separate.

Needs the addition of 1/2 cup water to the sugar to insure it dissolves and then cooks into a nice brittle instead of turning to sugar. Cook to hard crack (300 F) and do not scrape pot when pouring.

I halved the recipe to try it. Came out great!  But I would rec-amend you cook at a lower temperature slowly... and to 300 degrees.  Other than that it was wonderful will make this recipe over and over.

Also used finely ground walnuts instead of almonds.

This was SUPER EASY! And so yummy. I wouldn't use the whole cup of chopped almonds next time, too many fell off. Plus, spreading the chocolate chips with a plastic bag over your hand was way too hot. I would use a spatula next time. Otherwise, this was an awesome recipe and got a lot of thumbs up from those who I allowed to have a taste. I will have to make two batches -- one to give away and one just for me!

This is soft, bland and I knew before even trying that 285 was not hot enough so went to 300 but it still did not harden the way a toffee is supposed to.  Soft enough to cut with a knife.  Will be using my old tried and true recipe from here on out!

This was my first time making toffee.  I cut the recipe in half as I wanted to see how well it came out.   The only change I made was adding 1/4 cup water with the butter and sugar.  I let it cook on a low-medium heat for about 30 minutes.  I stirred til the ingredients came to a boil, then stirred occasionally til it registered 275 on the thermometer.  Came out perfect.

I have made this 3 times. Going by the recipe as well as suggestions other cooks on this site used. No matter what there is some butter separation.Very frustrating.

Oops:  I forgot to mention that when I make this (as I have for 40 years) the recipe calls for 3 TBS water.  I've never used a candy thermometer, just cook about 15 minutes till the right color - and it has never separated.  I spread it as thinly as possible on a greased cookie sheet. Then I pop it in the refrigerator for a few minutes.  Sometimes I sprinkle nuts on the melted chocolate - other times not.  Spreading it thinly on the cookie sheet makes very thin delicate pieces - and everyone loves to receive it.   And eat it!

Great flavor, good texture. Not difficult at all. I had no excess oil, and it turned out great, even without a candy thermometer.

Very Easy! I read several reviews and tips (thanks to all), and was able to accomplish this right off. My kids were gathered around in excitement as I stirred. Thanks for this quick easy version! We love homemade goodies of all kind. :)

I tried this twice and couldn't get the sugar to melt in so it was very grainy and the butter wants to separate from the sugar, in turn, the toffee would be better used for a nice sugar scrub in the tub!

This was my first time making toffee.  I prepared it as described, stirring frequently at first then constantly as the toffee began to darken.  This was as easy as described and absolutely yummy.  Try this recipe.  You won't be disappointed!

This recipe is pretty amazing! I used a skillet to cook the toffee and cooked it for about 10 min. stirring frequently. The key is to not look away. If you turn your head for too long it can go from being almost done to burnt pretty quickly. Mine came out amazing! I took a box of it to work and everyone loved it and my boss actually wanted the recipe :) definitely worth a try!

I did not care for this recipe. I brought to 300 degrees and stirred constantly. Oil (butter) rose to top and chocolate chips sunk, sugar was still whole and coarse.

I just made this and am waiting for it to cool. Looks delicious. Based on that and the little bits i tasted, i give this recipe a 5 star. I didn't have almonds so i used walnuts. Ill update my review after the toffee cools. Can't wait!***UPDATE*** i just tasted the finished toffee, and can i just say that it is absolutely AMAZING! It exceeded all my expectations. Way better than almond roca, because it is homemade. thank you for this awesome recipe!

I am changing the name to this to "Crack"!  It turned out so good that I can't get my mind off of it!  I cut the recipe in half because I have had trouble in the past getting the mixture to the right temp. This came out perfect!! Hope I don't eat it all before I can share with my work peeps!!!

This is the best recipe for Toffee I have ever tasted.  I am a huge fan of English toffee and every other type there is...except bad toffee!  The recipe is perfect and yes, you do need a candy/frying thermometer.  Those who complain their butter did not incorporate must have been knitting while cooking this recipe.  It must be stirred all the way through and the spoon does not have to be oiled or wooden.  As a matter of fact the toffee will slide right off any utensil you use because of the high butter content.  I will make one slight change for my next batch, however, and that is to cook the toffee only until the soft crack stage or slightly above.  I like to chew my toffee (Like a heath bar) and you cannot chew this easily.  Also I toast my ALMONDS for 10 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven before using them. Spread the almonds on the bottom of a cookie sheet and when the toffee mixture is ready, pour it over the almonds so the candy will have nuts inside and out.  I also make my own chocolate from scratch and spread that over the top.  YUM!

If you follow the directions, this comes out perfect with no problems!  I have used this recipe for years and everyone who tries it, loves it!  My only suggestion is keep stirring until it reaches the 285 degrees and the color is correct toffee color. I use Parchment paper on a cookie sheet and use the same parchment paper around it when cracking to avoid a chocolate mess.  Yummy!

I have been using this recipe for 5 years (200 - 300 lbs).  In addition to what mom2oovc said, I would like to add.

1.  if you making large batches, I can do a double batch at once in a heavy bottom pot.  Here are the tricks.  Have the choc chips ready in pre-measured bowls.  Pour the toffee equally (by eye) into the one of 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper (I drape over the 4 sides).  Spread out the toffee quickly.  Then sprinkle the choc chips right away.  If you work too slow, the choc doesn't stick well to the toffee after it cools.   Note:  I tried triple batch but the toffee cooled off too quickly.  Instead, I have 2 double batch going at once so I can have 4 batches within 40 minutes.  I just adjust the temperature so not all batches are ready at once.

2.  It is important to whisk the toffee but the most critical time is before it all comes together in a creamy like material.  So, keep whisking.  Thereafter, you can whisk every few minutes.

3.  Long handled whisk.  The toffee cooks up to 300 degrees so if you can, try to get a long whisk from a commercial cooking supply store ($15).  

4. The most critical part about the cooking process is that the temp has to be over 300 (I pull mines out at 305).  Otherwise, it won't be crispy.  I use a thermapen for this.  

5.  I had a problem one year when some of toffee had really think bottom while others were thinner.  I found out that my sheet pan was warped.  I hammered it back so it is more even.

Enjoy

This is a delicious, fun and easy candy to make. It smells great when it's cooking and tastes even better when it's done. We're sending this candy to relatives this year for Christmas. I used white bark instead of chocolate and mixed butter and margarine in some of the batches. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The first time I made this it was great. The next two times it the butter separated, then the whole thing burned. I don't know whether it turned out bad because I melted the butter before adding the sugar, or something else. Now back to the store to buy more butter.

Very easy. Worked better the first time I made it WITHOUT a thermometer! Poured it onto the jelly roll pan just as it started to turn tan color on the bottom and I panicked. It turned out PERFECT. The second time I measured the temperature to 285 and turned it out too soon. Next time will just eyeball it. Although I prefer the flavor of Ghirardelli chocolate chips, they do not melt completely since they are bigger than Nestles. The Nestles taste fine and melt better.

I sprinkle chopped almonds on top of my parchment paper and then again on top of the melted chocolate

This was so easy and so fabulous.  I do a lot of baking and such, and I think this toffee is the absolute best thing I've ever made.  It is fantastic.  I had no issue with seperation, and rather than put foil or parchment down, I buttered a cookie sheet.  It was perfection!

My go-to recipe, stirring in 1 tsp. vanilla before pouring. >Always use a flame tamer under the saucepan, cook with patience on medium flame til 250F, then full blast and push toffee to 300F, pouring immediately.

This toffee is very easy to make and DELICIOUS! The differences I made were: I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and I cooked the mixture until it was between 300 and 305 degrees. 285 is not enough. I had no problems with any separation, and it tastes amazing!

Perfect toffee every time. My husband goes nuts for this special treat. I always get lots of compliments when I bring it to gatherings. You really can use any nut you like and it's delicious. Yum!

This recipe was so easy! I just used a regular non-stick saucepan, and it came out great. It came out so well without the suggestions. I had my 2 sticks of butter at room temperature (by my own forgetfulness), which might have helped the cooking process. I tweaked the chocolate addition to incorporate a mix of dark chocolate and vanilla candy wafers, and it's delicious! I have to resist the temptation of eating it all in one sitting. I think will try using different nuts next time.

Extremely good! Followed the recipe as it said but I stirred everything constantly. From start to finish it took 20 minutes. I had to bump up the heat to med-high to get the temp up to 285 in the last couple minutes of cooking.

Not the best toffee I have ever had, hence four stars, but definitely worth making. I will make this again!

I may not have cooked this long enough although I did use a thermometer.  It keeps well, but it has to be in the refrig.

Delicious!! I cooked it on the cast iron pan and then in a copper bottomed sauce pan because I didn't have a thick bottomed sauce pan. I stirred constantly with silicon spatula. and cooked on medium for 10min...wouldnt come up to temp. so i cooked i at medium high for about 5 minutes until 290. i used parchment paper...doesnt lay flat on the baking sheet...maybe try foil or 9x13"pan. the chips melted easily and I refrigerated for 1 hour.

I made this recipe originally for people at work for Christmas. I put it in a gift bag with other candies, and everyone raved about the toffee. I have made it four times since. I made it exactly like the recipe said, and never had any problems.  The only thing I would recommend would be to let the toffee reach closer to 300 degrees. This is super easy and delicious!!

This toffee was so yummy! I made it to add to my Christmas cookie trays and almost didn't have enough because my family kept sneaking bites of it! I found that I did not spread the toffee on the cookie sheet around well enough and had some pieces that were uneven in thickness. Next time, I know to watch for that!

Make this!  It was incredibly easy and tasty!  I made a double batch of this and spread it between two greased sheet pans (no lining).  Put nuts on only one.  This turned out great and was delicious!  The toffee does look peculiar while cooking, but just keep on until it reaches the correct temp.  Mine ended up going to 300, since it went from 275 to 300 in a matter of seconds.  Turned out fine, though.  I would recommend melting the butter first, then adding the sugar in - even in my big pot it took a while to get the butter all melted when I had everything in there together.

Easy and very yummy. I've made two batches in thess than 24 hours b/c the first batch literally vanished. A kinda obvious tip (but one that didn't occur to me until my hubby pointed it out): don't let your thermometer rest on the bottom of the pan.

I found this to be a very simple, yet delicious toffee recipe!  It's definitely a keeper.  Just be sure to cook it to the right temp [~285-295 degrees f] and wipe off excess butter before throwing on the chocolate chips!

Absolutely perfect on my first try!  I used a candy thermometer to make certain that I had cooked it long enough, but I think that it would be just as good to judge by the color of the butter-sugar mixture, i.e., shoot for that rich amber color just like in the picture.  I stirred the mixture every 2 minutes or so and poured the cooked mixture onto a parchment lined cookie sheet.  Thanks, funky, for such a wonderful recipe!

Excellent and so easy!! I was a little worried about the temperature so I let it go a little above 285 to make sure it would harden and it worked perfectly! Make sure you put it in a BIG pan! I put mine in my roasting pan and it turned out thicker than I expected but it's still great!

I made this the other day for gifts.  I first made it as a single batch, then doubled it as well, and made 2 more batches.  I used a whisk for the 2nd doubled batch and miixed steadily until it came to a boil.  Then I just mixed frequently, but not constantly, like another reviewer advised.  Both came out perfectly.  Everyone loves it!

This is a yummy candy that ive been making myself for the past few yrs.  Something that I do different to give it that salty/sweet combo I like is I take a pack of saltine crackers and lay them side by side on the bottom of the cookie sheet first.  Then once the candy mixture is ready, I pour it over the crackers.  The rest is the same.  My kids and husband always love it and want me to make more.

I would not say super easy since it took me three batches before I had success,  and the butter still separated. I used a cast iron skillet and rarely stirred once it boiled, when I stirred constantly it did not work.  I am still searching for a better recipe.

I have made this four times with three of them being successful.  The three times it was successful I stirred the toffee the whole time in the same direction until it hit 285 degrees.  The time it wasn't successful the only thing that I did differently was to use a non-stick pan.  I'm not quite sure why that would make that much of a difference but the candy separated and was terrible.  So I guess I will stick to my regular pans because when this recipe is done right, it is so good.

This is the easiest, most amazing recipe ever! I get requests from everyone that tries it, and they have no idea that my 8 year old helps make it.  I would recommend this to anyone that is trying candy making for the first time.

That was soooo easy! The toffee (minus chocolate and nuts) was a perfect addition to my cookie bars. It came out perfectly on the first shot. Took Hiphop's  suggestion and stirred until it hit 300 degrees. Cookie bars were a hit!

I made this yesterday and it was fabulous! I didn't have any problem with it separating. (I think you guys are stirring to fast) Anyway, It was a great hit and everyone loved it. Pretty easy.

Made this for Christmas gifts this year.  It was wonderful.  I stirred almost constantly.  When it reached 290 degrees, I took it off the heat and poured the toffee out.  I let it cool for a few minutes before I put the chocolate on so the chips didn't sink and then I spread them with an offset spatula.  I didn't have any problems.

Don't use Crisco instead of butter. It never did mix with the sugar and I had to throw it out. I'll try again with butter.

This toffee is great -- both in ease of preparation and taste. I don't usually take the time to write reviews but this recipe deserves it! I made a batch to bag and give as gifts to my co-workers. Everyone loves it, and it was so easy to make! Cannot believe that nothing went wrong -- as it usually seems to when I follow a new recipe. Try it, you won't be sorry!

I couldn't believe I got it right on my first try! it is a great, very easy recipe. Next time I will either  use a larger cookie sheet or two small ones because my toffee turned out too thick and we would like it thinner next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my god! It turned out! I can't believe it! I've hardly made any candy before, and certainly not toffee, but it was quite easy. I was nervous about the butter separating, but I just whisked it together, and it worked out fine. I had to wait a bit to add the chips because the toffee was still so hot - just 3 or 4 mintues. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tastes great and everyone loves it. It's very hard to make without a candy thermometer. Easy to remember and very convenient. Works better on medium high insead of mediun.

This Recipe is definitely super easy. It turned out great with one exception there seemed to be a lot of excess butter. I measured it and there was about an 1/8 cup so next time I will decrease the butter, other than that it tasted amazing and everyone loved it!

I have made this toffee on 2 separate occasions following the recipe exactly as stated. It came out perfectly both times. I used two 9x13 pans lined with foil spray with cooking oil and I had no problem with sticking at all. The butter I used was land o lakes and I had no problems with the butter pooling or anything like that.

I tried this recipe twice using a candy thermometer. I cut the recipe by a quarter (1/2 c sugar & 1/2 c butter). First time I stirred constantly and at the end the butter and sugar seperated. I poured off about 1/4 cup of butter and it made toffee, but it was super hard. The second time, after reading reviews that said don't stir constantly, only occasionally, it still seperated at the last minute as I gave it one quick stir as I was ready to pour it out. Not sure if it's my heat level (meduim), or if I didn't make the whole batch, or what?? Very frusterating.

I've never made toffee before, but it turned out awesome. I don't have a candy thermometer, but I just waited until the colour went darker and it turned out perfect. It took way longer to boil then the recipe stated, but as the other reviews said, that's normal. Will make many more times.

WOW! This is amazing and incredibly rich. It is SOO rich I could only eat a few small pieces. Perhaps the extra richness comes from butter in equal amounts as sugar, where as a lot of recipes have a less butter? So if you don't want super duper yummy rich toffee, either find another recipe or cut back on the butter, but if you want divine goodness, this is it!

Super easy and very yummy! Only changes I made was that I used Salted Butter and that when it started to boil I only stired it a few times enough to scrap the sides and bottom to keep from scorching. I did the water test per other reviews and it turned out great after the 2nd time of making.

English Toffee is my favorite candy.  I thought would try for the holiday.  It is very yummy.  I did not have almonds so I used chopped walnuts and it still came out wonderful.  The only thing was I do no have a candy thermometer so I just had to watch it really close until it got to the right color. Still this was a very easy recipe.  Thank you.

AWESOME Toffee!  I will be making this again and again.  My mom and I made this together and it is incredible.  We took the candy thermometer up to 295 degrees and this was perfect.  We did not have any trouble with the butter and sugar separating.  Starting out, we melted them together on low heat stirring constantly until it came to a boil.  Then, we only stirred occasionally.  We decided next time we will stir a little more frequently because we did have a little scorching in our pan.  It did not affect the taste of the candy though. Also, I will melt my chocolate and spread it on the toffee.  I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  This was gone in a flash and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  This is better than ANY store bought toffee IMHO.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for gift tins for 20+ people and EVERYONE LOVED THIS TOFFEE!!!!!!!!  I used chopped walnuts instead of almonds and next time I am just going to skip the nuts all together and will try 1/2 butterscotch and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips to see how that goes...  But this recipe is perfect!  WONDERFUL!

First time I ever made toffee so I was surprised when this turned out so well. I followed the recipe to a tee. The toffee is easy to break apart and once in smaller pieces looks like something that would be sold at a fancy chocolate shop. Super easy like it says. I made this to give out for the holidays and I will be making this again soon, like tomorrow.

The title is true, it is the BEST ever and easy to make.  This is an annual staple for our holiday baking with my mom and sister.  It barely gets out to share with others!  This year we are making 2 batches.

Just made my first batch of candy..ever!! Turned out great except... I was impatient and put one pan in the freezer to cool and it turned a milky beige while the other pan (from the same batch) was a beautiful beige, it's texture was also different, kinda gritty like others mentioned. I did not use any chocolate but just mixed in chopped almonds at the end right before I poured... it turned out great!! Sure it would be great with choc. too !! Get getting ready to make batches 2,3,4,and 5. yes I like it!

Mine was a bust also.  I did not stir and followed everyone's suggestion and used a candy thermometer.  I probably poured off a cup of butter.  I have another toffee recipe that calls for 2 cups butter and 3 cups sugar - I am going to try that one to see if it will come out.  I must say that it tasted okay but just was very oily on the bottom.

Were wonderful.  Make sure you boil it long enough to reach the candy stage though or they will not harden.

I hate to say it but this ones a bust for me. I don't have a candy thermometer, but I used the cold water trick to test my temp (spoon some sugar syrup into cold water and the pliability helps determine temperature). I think when the toffee was close to 280 it was still  a golden color. I didn't mind the color but after taste testing, the toffee was very very chewy. Almost like taffy. Not even 5 minutes later the syrup was the dark amber color. It had the right color and crack to it, however it tasted burnt. I hate that I wasted so much butter but I wasn't willing to waste the fridge space.  I'll try another recipe.

I've made this recipe dozens of times, and would absolutely recommend it to others. Everyone thinks this candy is much harder to make than it is, and there's always a wow factor when you bring it to a gathering.

This recipe is so easy. I was a little intimidated by the idea of making candy but this is one user friendly recipe. I gave it as gifts at Christmas and the comments were that it was better than anything you could find in a store or candy shop.

This is so amazingly delicious. I love toffee. I stirred mine every few minutes, and I didn't have any separation or breaking problems. I was making a brownie cheesecake the same day, and broke little pieces all over it. I do believe that is one of the best combinations in the world.

I made the recipe BEFORE reading the reviews! A mistake that I will NEVER make again! I followed the directions (but it never turned the amber color that I wanted to.) Then I put it in a cookie sheet, and the butter seperated from the sugar! I tried to get the butter and the sugar to mix, but it was like trying to mix oil and water! I gave up and put the toppings on, and froze it. I took it out and chopped it up since I wanted to put it on top of homeade coffee toffee twisted frosty's.  It was ok, but it just did not taste like toffee to me, but it was great on top of the frostys! Oh well, at least I learned a lesson! NEVER forget to READ the reviews!!! :o)

I have never made toffee before, and this turned out very good.  My first batch was a disaster because I used the butter I had on hand (nucoa no burn).  Then I realized I needed to use real butter and that batch turned out delicious.  The thinner I got the toffee, the better it tasted!!  What a treat

Very easy and a very yummy recipe. I followed direction but halved and it came out perfect. Only change I made was to toast the nuts and I only had milk choc. chips. I do think I would prefer semi-sweet tho. Great recipe thank you.

Great toffee! I read the reviews before making, mostly followed the recipe, only I did stir constantly throughout. Didn't have a thermometer so I just eyeballed it and it came out great. I did change it a little by adding the almonds to the toffee mixture just before pouring it on the cookie sheet, so they were dispersed through the toffee instead of on top of the chocolate,delicious!! Had no separation problems as others mentioned.

I thought this was good but my husband loved it. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I had to go by the color description in the recipe. I think if I did have the thermometer it would have come out better. I did half the recipe though cause I thought 2 cups of butter was a lot and I'm glad I did because even making half the recipe there was plenty.

3/29/2009 This was my first time making toffee, and I live in hot, very humid Florida so I was a bit doubtful it would turn out looking at my humidity reading of 71% inside the house.  So I decided to make only a 1/4 batch to test it.  It actually turned out decent.  I think I could have taken it off the heat a bit earlier as it has just the faintest tase of starting to burn, but that's my fault.  I did have an issue with the butter seperating into a layer of grease on top of the toffee.  I tried to sop a bit of it up with a papertowel which seemed to help.  I put it in the fridge for a few minutes then placed the chips on it to melt.  It seems to have turned out decent.  I will keep experimenting with small batches until I get it right and post more results.  But, yes, you can make toffee in humid Florida!!  Thanks!
12/20/2010 Tried again and it came out wonderful...of course we moved to Tennessee since and it's not as humid and I now have a gas stove.  I read other reviews and heated it up slow and didn't stir as much and had no problem with the butter separating this time.  The full amount of chocolate and almonds is a bit much but that's my personal opinion...I want the toffee to shine through.

Excellent! Next time, I'll use two cookie sheets instead of one.  I liked the thinner ends of the toffee better than the thick center.  This is wonderful and tastes just like the stuff you buy at the candy store for $18/lb!  You must buy a candy thermometer ($2.50 at Wal-mart). On top of using the thermometer, I also used the cold water test.  It was perfect!

Just finished making this and it turned out perfect.  I was worried about the butter not mixing properly with the sugar so i added 2 extra TBSP , i also used dark brown sugar.  I stirred constantly until butter melted then occasionally as the the instructions indicated.  I removed from heat when it reached 300' F. added a splash of vanilla per another reviewers suggestion , used pure milk chocolate and toasted pecans.  TOO DIE FOR!!  Thanks for the keeper.

Really good- Here are a few suggestions. First, use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. It won't burn so easily. Also heat to 310 degrees and cover with milk chocolate chips. It you make this on a humid or rainy day it will take you way longer because the moisture takes longer to evaporate. Pick a dry day and it will be quicker.

This is so delicious! I made it for Christmas and gave it to relatives.  A candy thermometer is key - I burned my 1st batch by trying to eyeball it.  Also, I used chopped pecans.  Easy and yummy!

Very easy to make.  You really do need a kettle with a heavy bottom.  My toffee got a little dark-on the verge of scorching,but was still very good. Received several compliments. Will make again.

I have staple items in my Christmas candy list and then every year I try one or two new items. I was absolutely AMAZED at how easy this was. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with FABULOUS results. Note.. Make sure when you are spreading the hot toffee in the pan you take care to do it evenly. One half of my toffee was thick and the other was much thinner. The only thing that I may do different next time is to melt this chocolate prior to puring over the toffee. GREAT RECIPE AND NEW STAPLE TO MY CHRISTMAS CANDY LIST!!!

Maybe I didn't cook the toffee long enough (20 mins?).  My toffee was really soft when I broke it up and pretty much tasted like white sugar with chocolate on top.  Way too sweet.  :(

Super easy and always amazing.  Two things I do to this recipe.  I add a tablespoon of water to help everything come together and I whisk until it comes to temperature.  You won't have any butter pooling this way and it becomes thicker

The secret to the recipe is following it exactly.  I used my heavy teflon coated 2 quart Berndez sauce pan.  Use a candy thermometer and a whisk and gradually raise the stove temperature until the candy reaches 285 degrees to prevent burning.  The sugar/butter combination will get foamy and turn a caramel color.  The foil on the cookie sheet worked great.  Next time I will use the largest cookie sheet that I have so the toffee is less thick.  The chocolate chips melted well and the almonds were easily sprinkled on the melted chips.  It set up quickly in the refrigerator.  Clean up was easy. My family will enjoy this on Christmas day.

This recipe didn't work for me. Somehow I think the butter/sugar ratio is off because I made another toffee recipe that called for 3 sticks of unsalted butter and 2 cups of sugar, and it came out perfectly. Maybe the unsalted butter is the key? Either way even when setting in the fridge to harden up it came out grainy and not as hard as I had hoped for. I followed the recipe to a T also.

I can not thank you enough for posting this recipe. I never made anything like this in my life.My mom is a school teacher and every year someone gives her homemade candy just like this recipe.. She got some this year and we ate it all..lol We loved it so much that I though to myself I should check out how to make this.. 

So I looked online a found your recipe and It came out perfect I followed everything but I didn't use the thermometer I just waited till until it was brown and did the ice water test..
It came out soooo awesome, I could not believe how easy this was..I though I could never make something this good, but i did thanks to you...

 I already made 3 times and making more tomorrow and everyone is get some for chistmas.. Thanks again you Rock!!!! :)

Happy Holidays, Lisa from Boston, MA

I have never made candy, and this toffee turned out amazing! I didn't have a candy thermometer, and didn't even do the ice water test and it came out exactly as it should. I had no separation problems at all, but used high quality butter and sugar. Easy and tasty! I will make this every year!

This recipe is very easy to make.  I use a digital thermometer and let it get to 300 degrees.  I make this toffee every Christmas and give it out to friends, teachers, etc. and everyone always remarks how delicious it is.

This recipe did not work for me. If you dare attemp to gamble away four bucks of butter: Make sure you buy the highest quality butter you can find. If the butter does separate, (mine did) make sure you use something to "sop" up the extra liquid. I never thought I'd use a turkey baster in making toffee, but I guess there's a first for everything. The chocolate still seized on top of the toffee because of the excess liquid. I stirred occasionally like the recipe said with no luck. I'm a good cook, and I couldn't pull this one off... good luck!

This really is the best toffee ever!  And it really is super easy!  I have not had any trouble w/separation like some other reviewers have had.  Initially, I stir quite frequently and once the mixture comes to a boil, I only stir every so often.  GREAT TOFFEE!

I have never made any type of candy before. I used a cast iron frying pan which worked great for even heat. I had no problems with butter separation. I am excited to add this new recipe to my christmas cookie trays.

I had never made toffee or any kind of candy until this recipe.  I was slightly nervous so I cut the recipe in half.  In addition, I added 1/4 c. more sugar than it called for since a lot of the reviewers said there was excess butter.  My family and I were very pleased...It's definitely a sinful pleasure!  FYI. After a serving of this heaven it is advised to hit the gym for 2.5 hrs straight, lol. ;)

Alright...I"ll admit it I totally screwed up the first batch. It sugared on me, and all I can think of is, I put in vanilla after it boiled..OR I used generic sugar? I dont know but it was awful :( So I ran to the store for more ingredients and made it again this time I used name brand sugar, and no vanilla...Wa Laa! I am determined!!!!!:) And I was a little confused on how much to stir..it says occasionally , but some of the reviews read constantly...I just did occasionally and let it slow boil. Anyway it is delicious! Thanks for the recipe...

Just made this WOW !!! I put this in a heavy pan and didn't stick with minimal stirring. Cooked until 300 degrees. Took off heat and started stirring, after boiling stopped I added 2 tsp vanilla and continued stirring until smooth. I poured out on large UNGREASED cookie sheet. Let sit 10-15 minutes then dab off extra butter with paper towels. Score candy with knife into bite size pieces. When cool, break into pieces and dust with powdered sugar to prevent sticking.  Does not need Chocolate or nuts.  Great alternative !!!

This is very good, but you'll need to boil on very high heat for about 15-20 min on order to get the sugar fuse into the butter. I would add some vanilla as well. Also I would melt the chocolate separately and pour onto the partially hardened toffee. I'll make this again, but also tweek it a little until it's perfected.

I cut the recipe in half and it came out perfect!  1/2 a recipe makes about a pound of toffee.  I didn't over stir I think that is the trick!  I used pecans instead of almonds and it was delish and so easy!

This worked for me. I even made mistakes like stirring too much (?) but after I let it just rest and cook, it started to turn amber. I then stirred it really hard and poured it into the pan quickly. The layer of butter on top helps melt/spread the chocolate. It's a GOOD thing. Delicious recipe.

Yum! This stuff is addictive.  I used one c. brown sugar, one c. white. It came out a little crumbly/soft, so next time I'll probably try to get the temperature up to 300 degrees. But the main idea is that I will most definitely be making this again. Oh, and I've been told (and agree completely) that the semi-sweet chocolate overpowers the toffee a bit, so next time I'll use milk chocolate. Amazing recipe!

First of all, thank you FunkySeaMonkey!  What a fun recipe.  I finally made it today after saying I was going to all through the holidays!  I followed the recipe except for the butter.  I only had one cup so I also used one cup of smart balance.  I made sure I stirred the sugar and butter/salt mixture until it was melted and thoroughly combined (I think if you do not...the sugar never binds and you have seperation during the boiling point.) Then I only stirred once in a while to check on the color.  I believe all the other posters are correct when they say, just a little darker than peanut butter (I got the jar out, lol.)  Much darker and I think you would have a burnt taste.  I did not use a thermomter, I just went by color and coating the back of a small spoon and running it under cold water...to do the tack test.
I also used a smaller pan and have a thicker toffee.  It is a yummy, easy recipe.  Next time I might use all butter or might stay with the combo that has worked for me this time.  I will also add more almonds and the thinnest layer of chocolate, which is really just about preference.  Adore it!

This was ok toffee, and it certainly was super easy!!!  We made one batch of this and one batch of the English Toffee (from this site) and the English Toffee vanished within 24 hours... this toffee is still sitting in tuperware after a few days.  It was good, but not great.  Still, if you need a quick and easy recipe, this is certainly it!

Amazing! This is so good, and so much simpler than I thought. I don't have a candy thermometer so I had a glass of ice water handy. I didn't wait until it got peanut butter color, though, so it's not "brittle" but it's not chewy soft, either. It's PERFECT! I crushed up some pecans and halved the recipe. I WILL MAKE MORE!

Thanks to the person with the consolidated tips, it really helped.

Another tip, use those mini chocolate chips, I think they melt faster and are easer to work with.

I am a huge toffee lover and for years have purchased it from a local store. I decided to try it on my own, and had no idea how easy it was.

We followed the directions with the exception of adding a tsp of vanilla.

This toffee was perfection. Better than the stuff I buy. We decided to make batches of this for gifts.

Great, easy to follow candy recipe.  I cooked to hard crack stage ( a little higher than the recipe states) and have the most beautiful, buttery toffee.  It'll make great Christmas gifts!  Thank you!

This toffee turned out perfectly!  I couldn't find my toffee recipe I always use, so I used this one as it looked very similar.  I stirred it constantly and didn't use a candy thermometer, just waited until I got the right color.  I also halved the recipe & used a small pan. Great recipe!

This recipe turned out so well I finally registered after valuing the reviews of others on this site for years.  I followed the recipe as is ingredient wise, but did not use a thermometer, just eyeballed it for color and consistency and having read in other reviews that about 13 minutes of boiling gets you there, found that to be about true.  I poured it out on a foiled cookie sheet, spread the chocolate around as it melted and voila!  Perfect!! This will be great in goodie bags for Christmas gift baskets.  The only thing I might do differently next time is double the ingredients to make a thicker/denser toffee next time, or use a smaller pan.  I can't believe how easy this was!

LOVED this recipe. My Candy Themometer did not work, so I ended up judging it by the color and hit it perfectly. Not even that sweet, not too salty either...just perfect.

I just finished making two batches of this recipe - the first turned out more like a really sweet chewy dessert.  This was my fault because I didn't cook it until the dark amber color formed.  I tested my thermometer before use and it was about 5 degrees off so I just cooked accordingly.  My second batch I didn't use the thermometer and cooked until the peanut buttery color as others stated -- voila, perfection at last!  I can't wait to wrap these up and give them as gifts to my employees.  I will continue to make this recipe without the thermometer!

I really like this recipe.  I tried using light butter and it came out chewy.  I used regular butter and turned out good.  It reminds me of the skor candy bar.  I make this every year for Christmas.

YUMMY!!!! So rich and decadent that one batch can feed a lot.  I used chopped peanuts.  I also followed the tips on cooking to 300 and adding a little vanilla. Might try the brown sugar idea next time just to see how it tastes.  Good recipe!

I read all the reviews and took a stab at this recipe.  I used a cast iron pot as many recomm and did not stir...but at the end, I stirred once or twice and complete biphasal mixture: oil and amber-coloured sugar mass...AGHH...I then gave up, turned off the heat and rapidly stirred it all together with a whisk and then less rapidly...looked at the texture...finally looked like pudding...and then took it out and panned it.  Tastes and looks great, amazingly.  So folks, even if becomes oily, it can be 'rescued' - heck of a lot of butter to waste if you toss it all out.

I had never made toffee before, so I made a half a batch to try it.  It was WONDERFUL.  I have already made a second batch.  Very addictive.  Followed the recipe except used a little brown sugar along with the white sugar.

This was great when It finally worked. I tried it once and the butter and sugar seperated. Then the second time it turned out ok but I still poured a lot of butter out. Third was the same as the first then I read mom200's review and it turned out awsome. I was so glad it turned out. I think the biggest thing was not to stir to much. Thanks a lot.

I just made this toffee and it's terrific!  I'm not the most experienced candy maker, but this was foolproof!  I topped with walnuts instead of almonds b/c that's what I had on-hand.

WOW! Fantastic toffee recipe.  I followed the advice from another toffee recipe and cooked this in my cast iron skillet while stirring constantly until the desired color was achieved.  I did not even pull out the candy thermometer and it turned out perfectly.  Will certainly make this again and again.  Thanks:)

This recipe is so simple and absolutely mouth watering. I made some around Christmas time last year and sent it with my husband to work. I had so many compliments and requests for more toffee. Even my super picky father in-law loved it. This will become a regular for Christmas' to come.

I love this because it is so easy and delicious.I have given it for Christmas gifts and it has been such a hit.
Update December 2011...over the years I have made this and it is delicious. I have noticed a few comments regarding the butter pooling. My experience with that happened when I bought the butter at Sams in bulk, unknown brand and the storebrand butter at a local grocery store here in East Texas. I have no problems when I use Land o Lakes.

I had trouble with this recipe last year, but i just have to change my review this year because I think I finally got the hang of it. I used a candy thermometer but I think I could have done without because my temps got much above what the recipe called for. I let it get over 300 but just watched for the correct color. I liked the suggestion to stop stirring for a while in there, and I then resumed stirring when I sensed that the correct color was near. I was glad that I let it get over 300 degrees because it is so nice and crunchy, which was my problem last year when it was kinda soggy or chewy.  I think I now need to try another batch- this one will go fast!

This is a good recipe for toffee, but you need to cook it to 300 degrees or it won't have the right consistancy.  It gets sticky in your mouth unless you bring it to a hard crack at 300.
Tastes great though and makes a wonderful gift.

This recipe, although the flavor was good, ended up having far too much butter. The consistency was alright, but after only 2 days, the candy was grainy, rather than the traditional, hard consistency toffee should have.

I was amazed at how easy this recipe was to make.  It's one of those recipes that looks difficult but takes no time at all.  I chose to use pecans instead of almonds and it was delicious.

Super easy!! I didn't have a thermometer, but as others suggested went with the dark caramel color, and it is fabulous!!! I did add some vanilla and I stirred constantly over a medium low heat. Buttered the pan and put down some slivered almonds, and topped with chocolate chips. This stuff is delicious!!  And fool proof.

I made toffee!!! Woohoo! I halved the recipe with no problems.  I think I may use more chocolate next time. But this was easy. I did babysit the toffee, stirring almost constantly until the temperature reached 285. The butter did separate some, which I don't undertand. But it still tastes great.  Something new to add to holiday packages!  Thanks!

OK.  Milk chocolate chips would be so much better... Toffee part is good.  I'm not a toffee fan, but my family thought it was ok.  I halved the recipe, & it turned out ok.

I didn't have a thermometer and it started to curdle so I lowered the heat,and used an electric whisk until it blended together properly and heated until it looked caramel colour then in place of the nuts I drizzled plain chocolate all over the top. I also follwed the tip of 1 tsp of vanilla essence before cooking. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!

Cooking the mixture to a dark amber color will cause the toffee to taste really bad.  I suggest cooking it to a dark CARAMEL color, instead.  I had checked my mixture's temperature several dozen times throughout the process, and between dark caramel and dark amber color, the temperature quickly rose 30 degrees in a matter of a minute.  Again, dark caramel is better than dark amber.

I had no idea making toffee was this easy!And quick too. I cut this recipe in half and it still made a lot. No problems at all. It tastes just like the candybar and better than a lot of gourmet toffee candy I have had. Excellant recipe, thank you for sharing FunkySeaMonkey!

This is the first time I have ever made toffee and this recipes was easy and delicious.  Think Almond rocha.I think maybe the lady that had the seperation problem either used margarine which is a big no no or just didn't keep stiring.  I hope maybe the author could resubmit the recipe for those people who don't read all the reviews before they make a recipe.  Mine didn't really turn much of an amber color it was a bit lighter than that although maybe I should have gone longer until it did?  Oh well it was still absolutely wonderful!  thanks!!

AWESOME! Wish i could give this more than 5 stars!
Thank you very much for this recipe! I varried a little bit by putting parchment paper in 9x13 caserole dish, then added chopped pecans, then milk chocolate chips, then poured the toffee mixture over top. Resulted in wonderful, consistent, thick yummy treats!

I added three tablespoons of water, and I melted the chocolate in a double boiler, instead of letting the toffee melt the chocolate. I didn't have almonds on hand, so I used walnuts. I also don't have a candy thermometer, so I used the cold water method to test when the toffee was done, which worked out lovely.  The toffee had to chill in the fridge overnight, but it was well worth the wait!

I followed recipe exactly and it turned out great! I did, however make a mistake in using a 9x13  baking dish. It was way too thick. Next time I will use a large cookie sheet. This one is a keeper though, thank you.

Cooked to the hard crack stage 300 degrees instead of what the recipe recommended (285). Added a pinch more salt than the recipe asked for so it could be Salted Caramel. This turned out perfect! The toffee was hard but crumbled easily and melted in your mouth. I used toasted pecans instead of almonds. I also used a 13x9 pan instead of the baking sheet for slightly thicker toffee.

So excellent! I brought it closer to 300 degrees, it turned out with a nice crunch. Not too hard. I used a 13x9 pan and its still a bit too thick for my tastes. So many ways to vary this too, with different chocolates, different nuts. So glad I tried this!

I made the mistake of stirring in opposite directions right from the start. Also, I'm getting used to a new cook top and got it too hot.  I took it off the burner after only 13 minutes, when the temp was about 190. It's in the fridge setting now, but initial taste tests are positive. Just glad I didn't burn it!!

Foolowed others advice of
"This recipe states to "STIR OCCASIONALLY" so follow the recipe. Some women who are not familiar with making candy want to stir and stir because that's what we know, but boiling sugar for candy does not require a lot of stirring. Always use a wooden spoon, no metal (changes the temp). The reason the butter separates: by stirring and stirring you're cooling the sugar down and not allowing it to get hot and cook. Do not take a spoon and scrape the sides of the pot "above" the boiling line, that's where the sugar crystalizes. If you scrape, your candy will come out gritty. "
Thanks for the tip!

Even after taking others' suggestions, the butter separated. The chocolate chips don't melt completely so it doesn't look like the picture. Will look for a more traditional toffee recipe.

Definitely not "BEST TOFFEE EVER". Easy, yes, but missing the savory buttery flavor of real toffee. Probably needs to cook a little past the 285 degrees as recommended, as it was still a little flexible after cooling.

So easy, no changes, unsalted butter, didn't constantly stir,  but stirred often, used a wooden spoon with a flat edge to scrape bottom of pan, used a candy thermometer but it was awkward to stir and hold the thermometer because my pan was rather large so the butter/sugar wasn’t super deep.

I followed the recipe exactly, no changes, no pooling butter or wiping excess. It is PERFECT. Possibly the best thing I've ever made.

Followed to a T. Didn't modify. I worried when butter seemed to separate,  but after chilled it was fine.

 I had so many people telling me how awesome it was I am making again! And that was my first time ever making! 

Don’t change anything.

PERFECT !!! Do not substitute anything. It simply doesn't need any adjustment. I didn't have my candy thermometer handy and eyeballed it by color. TIPS: Brown sugar is what makes it grainy. All true caramel and toffee is made with white sugar. Electric heat will heat it too fast and if you aren't paying attention it will burn. Heavy pan is a must. You shouldn't have to pour off butter. This is the best butter toffee. It came out excellent in texture and flavor.

My brother in laws girlfriend made this and sent us a box full of treats. I absolutely loved it and sent her a thank you note and asked if she could share her recipe with me. She nicely told me that it was a family recipe and could not share it with me. Well I searched and found this one. I follow it exactly and ALWAYS use a candy thermometer. Everyone loved this one the best!  I brought it to a family function and watched as everyone devoured it. The look on her face was priceless. She told me it was better than hers and I just simply thanked her and offered her the recipe.

Made  this one 4 times- 2 hits- two (almost) misses. I think humidity and temp are critical for all candy and esp at high altitude. Even the ( miss) was delicious of course- it’s easy and fast- great for cravings.

The things that went wrong are on me. Not the correct sauce pan or stirring utencil. 

It separated. I stirred until 300 degrees. Once in the pan, i poured out the butter sitting on top and carried on with the instructions. It tastes amazing but a little too hard. It does stick to my teeth which apparently is not a good thing. But overall very haply with my first try of toffee/ candy ever.

Love this recipe! I cooked to 300 (hard crack) and used dark chocolate chips that melted on their own when placed on top of hot toffee.  I also replace almonds with chopped pecans.

This is a great and easy recipe. The first time I made it, I didn't cook it long enough and it wasn't hardening on the cookie sheet, pan, so I actually poured it back into the saucepan and cooked it a while longer, figuring it probably wouldn't work....but it did!

I love this recipe! I read through all of the tips and tricks and let me tell you using water a tablespoon at a time to control the emulsification of butter and sugar and making sure not to burn your candy while bringing it to temperature is Golden Rule. Also a fine line of mixing regular and not too much, sit and whisk constantly will cool the candy and cause separation, and DONT SCRAPE sides you will get grainy toffee. I will be using this in an endless variety of ways and adding different spices and ingredients as toppings personally I used 2 trays so that I could get it thin and crispy the way I like to eat it. I also foil the bottom and put a silmat underneath so I didn’t have to use too much butter just on the exposed foil. Great recipe will definitely be using again and again.

I add vanilla at the end; it may just boil out through vapor, but I think it adds to the recipe. I also often toast the almonds. I make this for friends and family. Everyone loves it.

A great recipe. I used all ingredients as written. For all of you out there that had butter pooling on top of the poured toffee- you cooked your toffee at too high of a heat setting. Toffee wants you to take your time. really good toffee can take as long as 1.5 to 2 hrs. use a low to medium setting. Stir frequently but not excessively. You absolutely HAVE to brush the inside of your pot occasionally with water and a brush to remove any sugar crystals that built up along the side so your toffee doesn’t become gritty. If you stir too much you introduce too much cool air into the mixture. Sooo, slow and steady is the key. perfect temp is 285-290. above that it will be brittle, below that and it will be too soft.

Fabulous recipe, although it did take me a second try before I got it right. My candy kept burning LONG before it reached the temperature specified. I'm not usually a candy maker, so I did a little research and discovered that, living at a high altitude, it makes a huge difference to your candy making. I tossed my thermometer aside, and cold water tested when it got to a nice golden colour, not too brown. Then I immediately poured it into a parchment lined pan. I also used a combination of dark and milk chocolate chips, and roasted my own almonds. The result was fabulous, and my candy making skills are improving! I only stirred my candy while the sugar was melting, and once it started bubbling, I left it alone until it was time to pour it out, with just a quick stir immediately beforehand to make sure it was nicely combined (I did NOT scrape the sides in) to make sure it stayed smooth, not grainy. For those of you who don't have success right away, keep trying! It's a learning curve, and you'll get it! It's most definitely worth the effort!

Super buttery and good :) Made it three times.  First time I cooked it to a really dark color and it had a burnt taste, almost like a burnt marshmallow. Second time I added too much sugar and made caramel. Lol. Third time just right.

I've been making this exact recipe for 35 years.  Having a candy thermometer is key - I've ruined it too many times trying to eyeball it.

Great recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I buttered the cookie sheet instead of using parchment paper.  Worked very well.

Sweet, smooth toffee. The best I've ever had.  Super easy, light and creamy. I added some peppermint because I had leftover peppermint for Christmas. SO GOOD!

I  made this for Christmas and it came out Absolutely incredible! Followed the recipe to a tee. My only issue was that it left a charred spot on my cast iron pot (Despite stirring per instructions). After trying to clean it, I got the char off, but it seems like it took off the enamel coating too....this is my first pot of this type of pot...it's a red Cooks Tools pot...no clue if anyone can provide insight as to if the pot is still useable? As for the recipe,  it's a 100% WINNER!!!

Great tasting toffee! Definitely cook to 300-310 for a very crispy toffee. The color was a little light compared to the pictures and videos, but turned out perfectly. 
One recommendation is, make 2 batches in a 9x13 or use a large cookie sheet with edges, this toffer was way too thick in the 9x13. (About 1/2-3/4” thick)

I’ve always loved this stuff. So easy to make and came out just perfect! I had a bag of pretzels that won’t get eaten, so I used those on top instead of almonds. Delicious!

I did everything except I used chopped walnuts. I dont have a candy Thermometer so I just eyeballed the color to what I felt looked like a "dark amber". I then poured it over my walnuts and added mini morsels chocolate chips on top. I gently spread the melted chocolate over the toffee. let it cool down enough to stick it in the freezer. After about 24 hours, I broke it up into pieces. I took some to work and had my coworkers try pieces. I had a lot of positive feed back.
Didn't realize how freakin simple this was to make!!!
10 out of 10 will toffee again.

Great recipe! I recommend using a candy thermometer. Also, if you prefer sweeter toffee bars, you can substitute the semisweet chips for milk chocolate.

Excellent results first time. Very easy. Used a heavy-bottomed 3 quart non-stick pan. Followed video. Stirred sugar, butter, vanilla (appx. 1/2-1 t.; I didn't measure) and salt until melted, then let it boil away over medium heat only stirring occasionally. At almost exactly 20 minutes, the mixture reached 300F, made a hard ball in cold water, and had browned to a medium tan. I poured it on parchment in an 11"x15" pan. There was no separation and no melted butter on top. I roasted whole raw almonds myself for 12 minutes in a 350F oven, then cooled off the cookie sheet and chopped. The only thing I would change is to use a larger pan or 1/2 the recipe since the toffee bark is thicker than I prefer, but that's just personal preference. Otherwise, texture, taste, everything is perfect and a big hit with family.

Have never made toffee before and it turned out perfect!  Oh my, I couldn't stop taking little pieces here and there, and husband says I'll be making it again soon (it's not even gone yet lol).  I used milk chocolate and like the pairing with chopped pecans on the top.

For the actual cooking, I wasn't comfortable only stirring occasionally, it seemed like it might have burned if I didn't keep at it, and it looked like the butter was never going to fully incorporate but finally it did.  I did track the temp with a candy thermometer, though you can see when the mixture hits 285, there is a subtle change in the consistency as it becomes smoother.  This is an absolute keeper!!

Used salted butter and no additional salt.  Stir constantly and heat to 290 to get a harder toffee.  Took 20 minutes to get to proper temp.  After you spread the toffee, smooth out the bubbles.  Wait  1 or 2 minutes then add quality chocolate.  Spread as it melts, add almonds or crushed candy canes.  SO EASY!!!

Loved this! I cooked mine to the hard crack stage and found that mine did not get super dark in color. I poured it into a 9 by 13 pan and it seemed a little too thick. Next time I will use a bigger pan. Other than that it was perfection!!

Very easy to make but do make sure you have your candy thermometer handy.  I had to use a glass of ice water to determine if my batch was done because my candy thermometer is packed away in a moving box.  It looks like it turned out but I guess I'll find out soon enough.

Beginner's luck? I love toffee but I've never made candy before. So, I went to the store, bought your ingredients and a candy thermometer and made it EXACTLY as described (with the exception of substituting pecans for the almonds). It was delicious. I took it to work and everyone loved it!

Great toffee. I add vanilla, about a tble spoon at the end of cooking. I also salt the almonds. Low - medium low heat and not letting the toffee burn is critical. Always asked for by my clients, neighbors, and friends at Christmas time.

Made a 1/2 batch and poured it into a small 8x12 cookie sheet so the toffee layer would be thick enough.  I let the temp get to 290 for crisper toffee.  Also used pecans instead of almonds.  I usually let the toffee sit and cool just a bit before sprinkling on the chocolate chips.  Once the chocolate looks shiny, spread with an offset spatula.  I used a whole cup of pecans; placed 1/2 on the bottom of the pan before pouring the toffee, the other half on top of the chocolate.  I'm about to try a batch with white chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  White chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate swirled together would look so pretty.  Great recipe.

Wow, simply superb! I will say that the almonds neither take away nor do they add, so I will omit them next time around. I'd also mention, stir until the sugar and butter have come together...but once the mixture starts to boil DO NOT TOUCH until complete or the whole thing separates. This will definitely be a regular go to in my home!

I made the toffee to use for another recipe and it was a wonderful success. I cooked the butter and sugar over medium heat while continuously stirring it in one direction using a whisk. When my candy thermometer read 290F, I took it off the stove and placed it into a dish lined with parchment paper. Once it cooled, my toffee was solid as ice. I was relieved this recipe worked and tasted great! This one is a keeper! Edit.....temperature was a bit too high, perhaps 280f would’ve been better

As I had never made candy before, I scoured the reviews for all the helpful tips and then ignored probably the most important one when I made my first batch. Who needs a candy thermometer anyway.  It burnt, but surprisingly, the texture was perfect. Batch two made with thermometer, lower heat, and less frequent stirring...perfect. Will make again and try some variations with different additives...almond extract, maybe, pecans....

Great recipe.  After reading several reviews, I think the key is to error on the side of going too slow than too fast.   I let the toffee boil for about 45 min with it finally getting to around 300 degrees, which makes it more breakable.  

If I make this dish again I'll use 25% more chocolate or reduce the toffee a bit to enhance the ratio of favor.

Made this for the first time and it was GREAT! Couple things to consider. I doubled the recipe and used a big jelly roll pan. Lined it with the nonstick foil. So easy but needed bigger pan or an additional pan. The toffee was a little thicker than I would have liked. Also the timing of when to put the chocolate chips on is tricky. I must have waited slightly too long because they didn't spread very easy. Kind of melted in clumps. Still tasted good mind you. I did use candy thermometer and tried to get the temp up to 300 (like some of the other readers suggested) but it turned the nice amber color and was perfect texture without getting to 300. I didn't want to accidentally burn it. I stirred only "occasionally" also like some of the other readers suggested, maybe once every minute perhaps. It was very good, but a little too thick because I needed larger pan for the double batch. Might try another, single batch, tonight.

this is a fun recipe.  one issue i had, but fixed, was butter pooling t top, y just need to whisk it till it sets back in.  i have seen people say it turns out buttery in color... you need to *burn* the contents of the pan to get the color, you didnt wait long enough. worked great for me, should be  nice hit for the holidays

This is an amazing recipe... simple enough for a first-time candy maker. I read through the reviews and altered the cooking temperature - took it to 300 F; and kept the heat at medium low - between 3 and 4 on my stove. Had no issues of butter pooling and the toffee cooked like a dream! Very happy with the results!

SO GOOD!!!! This has just been added to my Christmas baking list. Easy and delicious. I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed with Pam (not sure if the Pam was necessary). I melted 2 cups of Milk Chocolate chips and sprinkled with chopped almonds (probably more than 1-cup) then put in the freezer for a few minutes while I made the toffee. I heated the salted butter and sugar (didn't bother adding extra salt) over medium-low (about 3.5/10) it came to a rolling boil and I let it simmer for about 15-minutes until it turned a deep amber colour. You have to be careful not to let it cook too long, it will burn quickly. I may invest in a candy thermometer for next time. Poured the toffee over the chilled chocolate/almonds and let set in the fridge. Fabulous!!! Everyone raved about it.

This tasted good, but I couldn't eat it without risking a broken tooth.  The toffee is 1/2 inch thick in a 13x9 inch pan, and since I let it cook to 295, it hardened to a crunchy hard texture which is just too hard to chew, you have to suck on it like toffee candy.
So sad about this :(  to throw all this away.  Next time I will fill out 2 pans with the toffee.

Great recipie, but you cannot stir this constantly. Stirring causes the butter to separate and you end up with a pool of butter on top. After having this happen multiple times I learned to stir this only enough to keep it from burning, particularly as it gets hotter. I also had luck VERY CAREFULLY adding in a little hot water to the mix once it had separated to lower them temperature, then letting it heat back up and stirring as little as possible to "fix" it once it had separated.

Today is toffee making day!  My hope is to make 8 batches. 
 Made 4 batches with no problems at all - set up perfectly.  However, my last two batches "buttered out".  I didn't do anything differently.  Now I am reluctant to make another batch.

I made this on a cold, rainy day and not a problem. This was an easy recipe. I followed all of the tips. Melt on medium, stir occasionally once it melts. I used a candy thermometer to 300 degrees and also matched up the peanut butter color. I would use a large cookie sheet. The first batch I made on the regular cookie sheet was very thick. I used almonds for the first batch and pecans for the second. Thanks for all of the helpful advice from the reviewers.

Great.  Make sure to spread it evenly in the pan.  I had kids helping and center was way thicker than the outside edges and almost impossible to break up.  Ha.  Added Christmas sprinkles on top of chocolate

This was super easy! I’ve never made toffee or any kind of candy before. First time I ever used a candy thermometer and it was a success. I made sure to heat the toffee slowly in the pan and cooked until 300 degrees for a hard crack. I stirred occasionally and nothing burned. The only thing I would change was using a larger baking sheet to put the toffee onto, I used a 9x13 pan and the toffee was too thick for my liking. Also, I sprayed the baking sheet with cooking spray to make sure it didn’t stick. I can’t believe how easy this was!

This toffee tastes delicious and wasn't too hard to make. I did have a few issues, but candy making is hard, so it may have just been me. I boiled the sugar/butter until it reached 285 as called for in the recipe, but my butter did separate toward the end. Even tried stirring only occasionally, but it still separated. Rather than trying to mix it back in, I poured the toffee into the prepared pan and then drained off the butter on the top, probably an eighth of a cup. A turkey baster would have been helpful! I used a 7x11 inch pan, which made the toffee a little too thick. I had a heck of a time breaking it into chunks after it set up. Next time, I'll use a bigger pan and spread it thinner.

This was my first attempt at making toffee and I must say it was a huge success.  I followed the suggestions of others and boiled until 300 degrees and only stirred occasionally.  Plus I added a bit of coarse sea salt on top and left the chocolate chips on top without spreading them into a chocolate layer.

I half the recipe and it is perfect for so many things! I also only got to 260 for a crispy caramel (again perfect for so many things). Love it! I only use 1 cup sugar (white or brown) and 1 cup real butter to 260 and pour it out or over anything! :)

It's too soft for a toffee if it works out. Otherwise the sugar and butter separate, although I was able to save it by blending it and putting it back in the burner. The taste was just OK.

Not exactly easy... Well I wouldn't call this a total failure because it's edible but I had a problem having it reach 300 degrees even on high heat. At 250, I panicked when it started to smell burnt and I poured it onto parchment paper. It did solidify enough to cut apart but it's chewy. It still tastes really good and I will be trying this again some day when I am more comfortable with a candy thermometer.

This toffee turned out fantastic! I am not am not much of a baker and I just followed the recipe to perfect toffee! We put it in jars for gifts and took it as a hostess gift to 2 parties - it was a hit! Next year I think I will try adding crushed candy canes to a batch or marshmallows. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just pulled it from the burner when it was dark amber.

This is my first time making toffee.  It turned out great. I took the advice from the person that had been making this for 40 years.  I cooked it to 300 degrees. I didn't need to press the almonds in.  They stuck just fine.  Everyone loves it. Great recipe.

Over the course of 10 years I've had many fails and successes with the toffee recipe(s).  I have learned much about cooking sugar...it is all about temperature, and the time it takes to achieve the perfect temperature, and the tools used.  But it does not have to complicate what truly is an easy recipe.  This recipe is the one I use most often, except I ignore the instructions to cook to 285 degrees; I prefer 300-310 degrees.

I have settled on the following for perfect results every time.  

I use my heavy Magnalite pot and set my electric stovetop to "5" which is exactly MEDIUM heat.  
Stir OCCASIONALLY, not constantly, with a WOODEN spoon (stirring constantly cools it down, and using metal cools it down).  
When the mixture is at the stage when the sugar and butter are bubbling but have not yet foamed together, I reduce the temp to 4.5, to make sure the mixture does not get too hot too fast, which causes butter separation.  (Once the butter separates, you cannot undo the butter separation.  However, all is not lost.  Finish the toffee recipe, use paper towels if you want to absorb the butter off the top.  Set it in the refrigerator overnight.  The butter will harden and the toffee will still taste great.)  
When the toffee begins to turn color, I use my candy thermometer, waiting for 300-310 for hard crack.  Before I bought a thermometer, I used the color test (darker than a cardboard box) and the cold-water-test (drop a bit into ice water and eat it, to determine if the t

WoW! This is the first time I've ever made Toffee, and it turned out great!
I made this for use in a cookie recipe. I lined the cookie sheet with foil, then I did a super "low and slow" method that seems to work very well with candy recipes. This was for Christmas, so we used the red and green chocolate chips, along with some sparkly green sugar on top. lt was almost to pretty to break!
But that was the other great thing. We put it in the garage ( in frozen MI), for about two hours. Then all I did was bend the foil over in about 3 inch segments and it easily broke into one inch pieces! Perfect recipe, I'll be making this every year!

This recipe is soooo good! This first time it didn't turn out well, second time I followed others tips, I used a wooden spoon and made it in a cast iron. I made sure to check my thermometer in boiling water and use the cold water for brittle test and got it up to 300 degrees and used a brown paper bag to match the color/donenesd. Sooooo good. Will for sure be making more of this.

This was a hit. As always, making toffee or caramel without burning it is a challenge for me - stir regularly on all areas of the bottom to prevent any burning. One small burnt spot stirred up will make the whole batch taste burnt. I no longer trust the accuracy of my candy thermometer (I think it's too slow to respond), so I also drop some of the toffee in a glass of cold water to check the stage. When it starts firming up, I eat the drizzle to find out if it's hard yet. This worked well for me. I was also unexpectedly out of almonds, so replaced those with toasted pecan pieces.  I will make again. MY colleague demolished the serving I brought in. I've also got more stored away in vacuum-sealed packages in the freezer, to pull out over the holidays.

This is my go to recipe for toffee. I must have had 20 failures over the years, but since I have been using this recipe I have had a good batch each time. I think the trick is cooking it on medium. DON'T RUSH IT!   I also take it up to just below 300 degrees. "Voila!"  Good luck.

I had to make some changes because I didn't have enough sugar, I only had about 1 and a half cups. Since I used less sugar I also used less butter (half cup less). I did not stir constantly and butter did not separate. I heated the toffee to 300 degrees because I wanted it to be harder (more brittle like) and it turned out great. I did take the advice of some and used a smaller pan, but I wish I didn't because the toffee was too thick. I would definitely make again.

Don't be afraid to cook this longer, it needs to be constantly stirred until it jut turns amber. I poured it over pretzels to get the sweet salty taste. Oh so good!

I attempted this recipe 3 times and every time is started to get thick, it separated. I kept the heat consistant and stirred occasional. This seems like a very easy recipe, and I am not sure why the separation continues to happen. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Be sure to let it boil until 285 degrees. That takes 20 to 25 minutes on medium heat.

Wonderful! Read several reviews and followed a few tips that  others suggested. Added a tsp of vanilla,  used wood spatula, used candy thermometer and cooked to 300 degrees. Chocolate chips started sinking into toffee, so I waited a couple of minutes and added more.  Put pan outside ( 20 degrees, brrrrr) and voila. Will make another batch today.

This toffee is SO YUMMY! I made this for  holiday gifts for my co-workers and I got several comments about how good it was.  I made another toffee recipe from this site (melt in your mouth toffee) and that didn't turn out for me, but this one was INCREDIBLE!!  I highly recommend this recipe!!  It's so easy too!!!

This was easier than I thought it would be; HOWEVER, note to self!!!  Don't let the toffee mixture "burn." LOL :)  It wasn't too bad; my dh is still enjoying it. However, the next time I make this, I will definitely keep a better eye on it and will use milk chocolate. I followed another poster's tip about pouring the toffee mixture onto the nuts and this worked well. Again, I will use a smaller sheet to make sure I get a more consistent level of toffee. My first batch kinda spread itself, in my mind, unevenly. I will definitely be making this again! :)

There is something wrong with this recipe.  If you read other toffee recipes on the web, they always add water.  I made this and the fat from the butter separated from the toffee.  So I ended up with a cup of sweet clarified butter that I had to ladle off the batch of toffee before pouring onto my Silpat baking sheet.  It hardened off okay and tasted good because the dairy whey from the butter stayed incorporated.  I do live at 5000 ft. elevation but I don't think you need to alter candy recipes except the temp which I cooked a little longer.  Now I need to figure out what to do with all the sweet clarified butter I have left.  At $3 a pound, you can't waste it!   I would use another recipe.

Crystal S. mentioned she was a chef, so I took her advice and maintained a medium temp.  All of the reviews about the butter separation had me nervous, but I maintained the temperature and stayed patient.  It paid off.  The butter and sugar truly combine at the boiling stage.  I cooked until about 300 and wished I'd gone a tad bit longer, as my toffee was on the chewer side.  I also used a nonstick 12" frypan purchased at a restaurant supply, which was well worth the $20 investment.  In my opinion, it spreads out the mixture and provides a more even temperature throughout.  Wooden spoon and a good candy thermometer were a must.  Will keep this extremely easy recipe in my repertoire.

Excellent recipe...very easy and finished product looks beautiful!  But take time to read the tips.  Heavy bottomed sauce pan, wooden spoon ONLY for stirring, stir frequently and be patient.
I personally prefer a harder toffee, so next time around I'm going to try taking it to 300 degrees (hard crack instead of soft crack), but I have no doubts that the current batch will be gobbled up before I can make the next one!  It is delicious and very easy!!

This is the best toffee recipe I have ever used and trust me, there have been many.  The key is to cook it slow and low ( or at least medium as the recipe calls for) and make sure you use a heavy pan so it doesn't heat too fast!  I did not have almonds so I went without.... I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract at the very end.... otherwise I did it exactly as stated!  So yummy!!!

My first attempt at making toffee was a total success, even considering my stupid candy thermometer was not working properly. When the mixture got pretty thick-looking and amber in color, I did the ice water test and it showed that it was ready to be poured into my pie tin (I only made a quarter of the recipe so that I wouldn't waste a lot of ingredients if it wasn't good.) But glad to report that it tastes amazing and super easy to follow. Thanks for sharing!

Although this is not the BEST toffee I have ever had, it it very good for how easy and quick it is. I'd rather make this over cookies any day!!! I read a number of the reviews before making it and I took the advice of one reviewer who said to cook it until 300 degrees, not 285. I wish I had listened to the recipe and cooked it until 285 when the toffee was not so dark. Cooking it longer gave it a slightly stronger flavor which although not bad, is not what I prefer. Everything else was done as the recipe called for. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Fifth batch was the charm for me.  The first 4 batches still worked for Christmas gifts but once it hit me I needed to adjust for altitude (I live at 5344 ft.) it worked beautifully.  I let the temperature just get to about 265.

I've used this recipe many times, always with success and without changing the cooking directions. This time I spiced it up by using dark chocolate, cayenne pepper (I'm Texan), and sea salt before adding the almonds. Yum!

Not sure why, since I've googled and researched a million troubleshooting solutions, but after 3 tries, it still separated. Looked fine up until I poured it out then the butter was resting on top of the "caramel" on the sheet pan. I changed butter, added more salt, didn't stir at all and used a thermometer. Sincerely, 
Stressed in Smokey Asheville.

I LOVED the toffee but i had some difficulties, i  recommend melting the sugar first, it reduces the chance of burning the mixture, and makes it a faster process, also add less butter because i could see the melted butter and it wouldn't mix together. If this happened to you just try to pour out the extra butter.

I tried to make it, but it didn't work. It burn't and the whole thing just got messed up, I'm not sure if it was just because I didn't follow the recipe right or if candy is just hard to make. I will probably try this again though.

of course very rich, but addictive!

as mentioned, and like the video,  stir occasionally as mixture heats up, but once boiling (under medium heat) let it go until to 300' temp - a candy thermometer a must.  double recipe to fill full cookie sheet (w/4 bags of semi-sweet morels).
added some chopped pretzels to the nuts; and next time will drizzle on some white choco too.

Perfect English toffee! This is the first time I made it and I do not have a candy thermometer. It said to wait until it was a dark amber color so I did. The color changed quickly towards the end and when I thought it was dark enough I poured it onto the pan.  I sprinkled chocolate on top waited about five minutes, then spread it around and sprinkled it with almonds. I had no problem at all. This is the first candy I ever made and it went really well

For the first time I made this, I was not a big guy on candy.  I thought this would easy to make.  Candy is tough.  It is all about temp. and time cooking.  Keep this in mind when you tell someone it's easy.  Cooking right is all about paying attention to detail.

Mini chips are best, I mixed mini and regular sized, and not all of the bigger ones melted. But with the almonds added, no one knew or cared. It's yummy stuff!

I followed Megan Orsini's tips with this recipe, poured the 305° mixture over the toasted almond pieces added chocolate and spread it evenly then sprinkled lightly with coarse sea salt - excellent.
I used a laser pyrometer for accurate temperature reading.

Actually I have made this a few times and I have found using a stainless steel heavy bottom pan and a wooden stir spoon creates my best results. The plastic   spoons will melt and you don't need that in your food. I have the coated cookware and I just don't get the same results. Thank you for the recipe. It is delicious!

Wondeful. I opted to listen and cook butter/sugar to 300*. Also made only half and i put it in a 9x9 but would have been better in a 9x13 because its pretty think. Also I think next time I will add the nuts into the toffee at the last minute just to reduce the mess I made lol. Worth making

This toffee was awesome! Didn't bother with finding my candy thermometer ,  just went by color and feel... came out perfect. Have used cashews and almonds, both have gotten rave reviews.... Always use in candy and cookie boxes

Here's what I learned: 1) my 2 candy thermometers did not read correctly when tested with boiling water so my daughter & I used ice test & appearance only. 2) medium heat would have been high enough if I had only stirred occasionally after beginning to boil 3)four butter separation events salvaged with a little hot water, and likely occurred because it wasn't getting hot enough due to my excessive stirring. 4) I prefer choc. on bottom & top & milk choc. With almonds. 5) consider half batches till u r successful. It still makes a good bit. 6) I think we try to make this more difficult than it needs to be!  Good but my next attempt will be better. Never give up on your "globs" u can salvage it with hot water, less stirring and slightly more heat if necessary. stirring seems to be the culprit. Kathy

Perfect the very first time, I followed the directions exactly and got perfect results. I've tried other recipes and didn't come out as good as this one. I highly recommend trying this even if you've never tried something like this before! Delicious!!

Oh, this stuff is good and so easy to make. It makes a beautiful gift for Christmas. I did have problems with the butter separating but I think I figured out what I was doing wrong based on the reviews. Next time I will stir the butter and sugar constantly until it boils, then stop stirring, except occasionally, until done. Even after a batch separated, I just poured off the butter and the toffee turned out just fine. This stuff is delicious!

When this toffee comes out right, it is unbeatably buttery, crunchy, and addictive.  It really doesn't get any easier than this simple advice: follow the recipe.  Stir the mixture occasionally, use a candy thermometer, and watch the color.  
Anyway, perfect, perfect, perfect!  This is my second Christmas of including it in my cookie basket gifts, and everyone LOVES it.
Don't be scared of it; it's just an amazing and an easy recipe.

I took the advice of several other reviewers and cooked the toffee on medium heat the whole time, letting it get to 300 degrees before pouring it in the sheet pan. It turned out crunchy and perfect even in our moist, rainy Northwest climate. I will definitely be making this again next holiday season!

This is so great! I had to hold myself back from whisking the toffee constantly....it just felt right. After I spread the chocolate chips on the toffee, I sprinkled sea salt on top.

This recipe does not make Toffee, and yes i have made it 2x before researching other recipes...because i'm a sucker for "Super Easy".
The biggest flaw in the recipe is the temperature..it says to cook to 285 and that is a SOFT CRACK not a HARD CRACK...! This i learned after reading a better recipe.
Next flaw is the butter ratio, you do not need 4 sticks of butter, 3 is fine.
If you want a "Super Easy" recipe go online and find the ones that you just stir the ingredients a bit until it starts boil then add the thermometer and NEVER STIR AGAIN until it reaches 300-302 degrees (Hard Crack). Trust me, a no stir recipe is perfect and it does not burn.

I made this tonight and have not an idea what went wrong. It turned into a sugary glob. I added water to get to a liquid form. Never turned amber brown looked more golden brown. I'm disappointed as this was for Christmas Eve celebration. I'm afraid it won't be good.

The key thing here is to use GOOD butter (none of that Land O Lakes  - it will burn). Use a high quality butter like Kate's and it will come out perfect every time.

Followed the recipe exactly- stirred occasionally, with a wide heavy pan, pulled it at exactly 285 degrees as directed.  I felt some degree of dissonance as I pulled it off the stove, as the appearance did not fit the "dark amber" color in the directions, but decided to trust the recipe. Big mistake. The color ended up being a more blonde color. The toffee never set completely (as it never reached the hard-crack temp), and was neither taffy nor toffee, but some amalgamation of the two. Additionally, it was missing the nutty, rich toffee flavor I love. Disappointed. Will try a different recipe, or just let it hit 300 degrees before pulling. Will not repeat this one.

Just made this for the first time. Have only made caramels before so i had an idea of what to expect, it just moves along a lot faster then with cream. I do not even have a thermometer and they turned out perfect with just a little stiring every 3 to 4 minutes. We dropped the nuts and instead went with crushed candy canes since they will be used for Christmas presants! Cant wait to try them!

Easy to make. Just make sure to use real butter and medium heat.  I like milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

This is the EASIEST recipe. I have never made anything like this before and it came out perfect on my first try. 

Use a candy thermometer and a heavy bottomed pot - these are NOT optional tools! No need to stir at all while this cooks if you leave it at MEDIUM heat and use the correct type of pot.

There is no need to modify this either, it is perfect as is!

Mixture was pasty white and grainy for the first 50 minutes and then instantly turned dark brown and an inch of butter floating on the top and smelled burned.

Made this wonderful cocoction exactly as instructed, and I was amazed at how easy and fast it was to do, and how tasty!  I am a novice at  candy making, so I used a 2 quart saucepan because it had a heavy bottom, as detailed in the instructions.  But I didn't realize how the candy mixture would expand in middle and late stages.  I would recommend to others as uninformed as myself that a 3 quart pot is really a better choice.  My family has advised me that we certainly will be making this again!

It turned out perfect!  I cooked the toffee for 20 minutes stirring constantly and did not have any problems.

Tastes fabulous.  I cooked it to 300 degrees, stirred constantly, and the butter did separate quite a bit.  I started to panic until one reviewer suggested that if it separates to add up to 1/4C water 1T at a time and reduce heat.  I did this and it seemed to help.  I still needed to blot the corners once I poured the toffee into the pan, but at that point the separation wasn't bad.  Used bittersweet and not semi-sweet chocolate - just personal preference.  Doubled the recipe and used a half sheet jelly roll pan (17 3/4" x 12 3/4" x 1" high).  

**NOTE**  After the fact I realized that, despite efforts to double recipe, I had only added 4 sticks of butter (2 cups) instead of 8 (4  cups).   It still tasted fabulous.  Thank you for a very forgiving recipe!

We've had this at work for years and fondly refer to it as 'Christmas Crack'. This year I 'under-cooked' the toffee slightly so it wasn't an amber color. The darker the candy, the harder and stickier it is . Mine is more a cream color and everyone has liked it better because it's chewier and not so hard on their teeth. Either way you go though, it's definitely a win!

This was promoted on the site, and came up in a Google search as well.  I read through the reviews, and I consulted with Betty herself, so I decided to go ahead with this.

This was super easy, but I took Betty's advice and added a 1/2 cup of water at the beginning.  I made two batches in succession (my pot was only big enough for one at a time).  The first batch I cooked slowly over low heat and it took about 30 minutes to get to 300, which is when I poured it out onto a parchment covered jelly roll pan (11x16 aluminum).  For the second batch, I turned up the heat to medium and tried to stop at 295 (I wanted it a little softer than the first).  The second batch finished in about 15 minutes or so.

I used a copper clad pot for even heating.  Also, I substituted 1/4 cup of the sugar with brown sugar, but I don't expect that made much difference.  I used unsalted butter and added a 1/4 tsp. salt to each batch.  I had no problems with this; it turned out fine with the adjustments.  Plan at least 2 hours for this to cool (or chill in fridge instead).  I made some with pecans, some with almonds, some with walnuts. 

I recommend the addition of at least some water if you want to avoid graininess (this may also depend on your altitude since that will affect the boiling temp).  Once the water boils off, the temperature will rise quickly, and you must stop the heat by 300 if you want to avoi

This turned out great.  I cooked it to 275 degrees because I live in Albuquerque and our elevation is 5,000 feet.  Home extension at the university says for candy making, reduce temperature 2 degrees for every 1,000 feet above sea level.  Worked like a charm.  Great consistency in the finished product.  When it reached 275 I added 1 cup of hazelnuts.  Boy,did that make it good!  Didn't do any chocolate topping.

I have always strayed away from candy making.  I remember growing up and baking seemed to be so much easier.  I have to say I am impressed with the ease of this recipe, not to mention how well it tasted.  The crunch was exactly what it was supposed to be.  I used unsalted butter, added 1/4 tsp of salt.  I used a non-stick pan and with the advise of another review,  cooked until the color resembled a brown paper bag.  It turned out great!!!  I would recommend mini semi-sweet chips as they will melt quicker and be easier to spread across the toffee.   I will definitely make more as gifts for Christmas.

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted burnt.  The second time I adopted some of the popular suggestions with results that weren't as awful, but still did not care for it. And, I'm experienced making candy, baking, and cooking. Disappointing.

I've made a lot of candy but never toffee. I followed this recipe exactly and used my trusty candy thermometer to 285 degrees. It's grainy and whitish in color and isn't as crisp as it should be.

Agreed that 300 is a better temperature, thank you to other reviewers. Also did not stir constantly but as directed. Only one problem - how do I stop eating it?

Super easy, just like it says. I followed the recipe exactly as it says, but did take the temp up to 300 as some reviews recommended. Oh yeah - and I chose not to smooth out the chocolate chips after I sprinkled them on top. I liked the look of them whole/chunky.

I've purchased something similar from a high end kitchen store for years.   THIS IS BETTER.  I made it just as directed and it turned out wonderful.  I also have a non-chocolate grandson, so I made a second batch using white chocolate and it was just as good.  With the white version, I used pecan pieces and it was really good.  So yummy and not hard to make.

I have tried a lot of toffee recipes that claim to be easy but aren't and don't taste that great.  This one is both!  Pretty straight forward and am very glad for the tip from another reviewer about not going too quickly on process.  It took about 18 min to get to 285-290 degrees.  I did add vanilla after I removed from the heat and stirred in the nuts.  No separating of butter and the texture was perfect.  Thanks!

THANK YOU!!! Thank you for this recipe.
I made this 2 years ago for Christmas and now it is a request from family and friends every year!  I am not a great cook, and only a moderate baker, but this turned out perfect the very first time! Never had any separation of butter. I followed directions exactly. 
I like to use the finest butter and chocolate I can afford, but I've made it with the standard brands and had great success.  Make several batches of toffee to pour,  and top with milk, dark, white, or a mixture of chocolates. Add  pecans, almonds, or whatever! ...  Fantastic gift!

This was my first time ever making toffee. My butter separated but I poured it into the pan to set anyway, and the butter pooled on top. It looked really gross so I reheated it, and actually poorer out almost a full cup of butter that separated. I then poured it back into the pan to set and I got very nice toffee. My advice it use less butter.

The title fits this perfectly, it really is the BEST toffee recipe ever! I've never made toffee before but I followed the recipe and a few of the suggestions given by others and I made the most delectable, buttery toffee my family and I ever ate! The only thing I would do different next time is use a bigger cookie sheet to cool it on. It was a little too thick in some parts. Other than that, I'm pretty proud of my first time effort!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Beware, it does make a lot so you might want to only make half. You do not even need a candy thermometer. Make sure you heat it to a dark, dark amber so it is hard when it cools down. Happy cooking!

This is the easiest and most delicious toffee.  Highly recommended it.  I have added it to the family recipe book.  My coworkers repeatedly ask me to bring more to the office....

Wow!! My first time ever making toffee and it turned out  perfectly! I made it to go in my favor bags for my Mother's Day brunch and man...these things are amazing! I followed the recipe to a 'T' with the exception of adding  a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The process of the butter/sugar mixture turning dark amber took longer than expected but it was worth the wait. I bought my Taylor brand candy thermometer at Target and it says 'cracked hard' 300 degrees so I let the mixture get to that temp. The mixture was super easy to spread with a silicon spatula. While the butter/sugar mixture did it's thing, I melted the chocolate chips in a double boiler (so the chocolate isn't on direct heat). I poured the chocolate on the toffee and spread that with a different silicon spatula. Placed the concoction in the refrigerator for about 30-40 minutes and Voila...awesomeness!!! No nuts this time but I'll make them again and again and again!!! Holidays, homemade birthday presents, just because. This is now my go to recipe!

This really is good - but you need to make sure it gets hot enough - to candy stage - otherwise it will be grainy.

Just what it claims to be. Everyone scarfed this down. I couldn't believe how well it turned out, because I'd always assumed it would be hard to make. I did two batches, one as described, and another with the nuts placed on the sheet prior to pouring the liquid over it. Both are excellent, but I think I like the nuts in the mixture better than on top.

My first attempt at toffee and it came out perfect and delicious. Followed directions but let it cook to 300* like mentioned.  Will make again for sure.

I loved this recipe! It was my first time making toffee and it was easy, and came out delicious! The only change I made was putting some chopped pecans in the bottom layer, the toffee part. I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top and they melted from the heat of the toffee. Topped with chopped almonds. To die for!

I followed the recipe and read the reviews hoping to have this toffee recipe turn out well. I cooked it on a medium/low heat because on my stove a medium high heat, as the recipe says to use, is too hot and the butter separates, a lot.  I followed the recipe exactly except turning the heat down and I am very frustrated with how badly the butter separated.

used almonds. This was beautiful. And delicious! Takes a long time for it to start boiling. Used two cookie sheets with parchment paper and tried to spread it out as thin as possible. Used the plastic idea for smearing out the chocolate.

Used pecans and cooked to 300.
Perfect texture.
Parchment paper is your friend. Made two batches for Christmas.

I love chocolate toffee like this and I did my best to follow the recipe along with keeping the many reviews in mind.

I used a heavy bottomed enameled cast iron pot, and cooked on very low and slow heat at first. My butter and sugar separated after about fifteen minutes, so I turned off the heat and added a bit of water like other reviewers suggested and that salvaged the situation. However, in the end my toffee was good but tasted a bit burned, and grainy. Like I said, I did my best following and I know I am inexperienced at this, so a lot of it is likely my fault, but in my opinion if a recipe doesn't make it so that someone who has never made it can do a pretty good job, it is partly the recipe to blame.

Works great.  I make 6 or 7 batches of this every year for gifts.  Using a candy thermometer makes life a lot simpler! This is the exact temperature you should get it to in my opinion.  When it becomes an amber foam, you're there.  I like my toffee just soft enough to bite, yet have a just enough crunch to it.  If you go much higher temp it become more of a hard brittle.  You can also mix it up with some flavored chips too, like mint or white.  Just draw a knife edge or spatula through it to make beautiful flavorful swirls.

This recipe worked the first time I tried it I poured the toffe mixture on the nuts and the chips on the warm toffe mixture.  The toffe came out not as hard as I thought it would. It still had a nice crunch without being a brick like other recipes I've tried I will do this again!!

My first time making Toffee and it came out perfect! I can hardly believe I did it. I discovered that my candy thermometer has little hint settings on it, my toffee was cooked exactly when it said "soft crack (which by the way was at the temp specified in the recipe). I did the ice water test a few times on the way, noticing how it was a bit harder but still soft along the way, I knew it was getting there, when it was ready I Knew it using the ice water test. I did stand over it for the 15 minutes or whatever time it took noticing it getting darker and stirring, keeping watch over the thermometer. I used a tad over medium heat to cook it on my electric stovetop. I am so pleased with the result I can't wait to give it away. (I gave some to my son and his girlfriend as they stopped over and they loved it).

Mine didn't turn out.  I waited until it was 300 on medium heat.  It did not turn golden brown, did not harden, and is like eating crunchy sugar. I lightly sprayed the wax paper and it still stuck to it.  Second attempt making toffee. It did the same thing last year too.

As my husband is a Type II diabetic, I made this recipe with Whey Low sugar substitute.  In addition, I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips and eliminated the almonds.  The toffee turned out fantastic, and you can't even tell a sugar substitute was used.  I'm sure the recipe is that much more delicious with real sugar!

Made myself sick eating this stuff because it's so good you can't stop! I used milk chocolate chips though and cook until 295 for perfection!  Also, a whisk helps with the butter separation, use it right before you pour but be very careful not to slosh it on yourself.

I followed the reviews and stirred constantly but with a rubber spatula not a whisk. I put tin foil on bottom of 9x13 pan and topped it with trader joes semi sweet and crushed candied walnuts! Delicious!

A truly decadent yet EASY toffee! My married daughters and their families look forward to a batch tucked into their Christmas and Easter goodie baskets each and every year!  I have noticed that to get a nice amber color I have to start it off hotter than I originally thought and once the temp reaches around 290-295 the color is PERFECT!  Easy gift to make that EVERYONE, old and young alike appreciate!!!!

Well, our first attempt SUCKED!!! It separated, burned, and smoked!  But we are at 6,800 ft elevation and are using Propane to cook with!  We did not take these factors into account when we tried it the first time.  Propane seems to burn hotter then natural gas.  Our second try was much better! 

Here is what we did different: 
--I softened the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. 
--Added the sugar, salt and 1 tsp vanilla before turning on the flame.
--Once I saw the butter starting to melt, I started to whisk it 
  continuously until it was combined and starting to bubble. 
--We used a medium/low heat to start with and lowered it to low to
  allow it to come up to temperature SLOWLY! 
--We heated it to 300F and followed the rest of the recipe (chocolate &
  nuts)
--We took it outside and placed the pan in the snow, cooling it quickly.

RESULTS?  PRETTY GOOD!  Still not perfect but we will attempt it again soon.

I just got done making this receipe for the first time.  I used a 4 quart non stick pot using medium heat and stirring SLOWLY and constantly using a non-slotted wooden spoon. Just like my mother taught me years ago.  No butter separation. I cooked the toffee to 290 F, it will be a little soft but I plan on giving it to my children whose chewing muscles might not be up to the task of a hard candy. 

I simply followed the directions for the choclate, spreading with the back of the same spoon I used to stir the toffee.  The combined heat melted the morsels very nicely and the layering turned out great.  I am using silivered almods, non-toasted this time.  Usually I like toasted nuts, but we will see.

Super Easy - just like the recipe says.  I made this to give away as gifts to neighbours.  I tested this out on my family and I'm finding that my supply stashed in the back of the fridge is dwindling fast!  I stirred constantly and did not have any issues with butter pooling on top.

super easy and tasty! Made it for Christmas goodie exchange at work, and it was a big hit. MUST have a candy thermometer. To add some fun, put nuts on the sheet before pouring out the toffee.

Made this once with great success.  Got cocky and, I think, ruined my candy thermometer somehow and burned it the 2nd time, did better a third time and just finished a fourth batch - perfect, delicious, sweet and buttery. I bought raw almonds, toasted them whole in the oven for a few minutes, then used my food processor to chop them into fragrant, chunky pieces.  Great recipe!

I made this two nights ago and it turned out great.  The only thing I changed was the chocolate - I used dark chocolate.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I have never made toffee before and was sort of intimidated by it.  This was very easy and it is so delicious.  I will definitly make it again.

Really the best toffee around!  Easy to make! Key things to know... Use good butter ( it will blend without looking greesy) I chop nuts and put them on the bottom of the pan before I pour the hot toffee mixture~ love extra almonds. Keep it in the fridge until you are ready to serve it ~ won't stick to your teeth when it is super cold!
Enjoy!

This was the first time I've attempted toffee.  I admit I did not use a candy thermometer, but just cooked until a dark amber color.  Otherwise,I followed the recipe as written.  We loved it. It was a tiny bit bitter, but next time I'll cook it for a shorter time and use a heavier pan as others have suggested.  This is the perfect toffee texture.  Yum.....my kids love it.

My first try and SUCCESS!  I have made this many years ago so I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I don't even use a candy thermometer but rather go by the color and smell (as well as cold water drop to test for crunchiness).  I put chopped almonds (raw) on bottom first.  The toffee toastes the almonds for you and the thickness is perfect.  I cook it a bit longer to get a true brittle consistency, not soft ball stage, it turns out crunchier... personal preference. It's easy to burn so watch it carefully while cooking.

I made this recipe with a friend this weekend and it couldn't have worked out better! It's absolutely delicious and tastes just like a Skor bar. It's so easy, too. We didn't have a candy thermometer, but we stirred the butter and sugar mixture constantly until it turned a dark amber colour - which takes quite awhile. Stirring constantly helps because the butter starts to separate. 

After it was finished boiling, we poured it into the pan. TIP: dab off the excess butter that pools in the pan with paper towel. We also found that the chocolate chips weren't melting quick enough on top, so we popped the whole pan into the oven for a few minutes at 170 degrees.  Finally, we topped it with crushed pecans and almonds. SO GOOD!

This was my first attempt at toffee...I love the stuff but was always afraid I would burn it or not get it to the right "crack" and would end up with a blob.  It turned out perfect!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a family Thanksgiving meal. I made it just as the recipe said to & everybody loved it. Oh also, I knew that there is noway you can cook it without stirring constantly. I am going to make it again for another Thanksgiving.

This is excellant toffee! My stove top cooks hot so I had to reduce the flame more to low once it boiled to allow it to cook properly and had no problems. The first batch was eaten so quick I had to make another.

Such an amazing in-expensive way to have such a great treat.
I added a tiny bit more suger and some golden syrup.
Made it for my partners birthday party
Note to self though don't try dip your finger in to see what it tastes like even if you think its cooled down enough as you will end up with a nasty burn blister ^_^

I made the mistake of cutting this recipe in half just in case....horrible mistake because it was eaten in a day and I am now craving more!! I never knew toffee was so easy, but when I went to a holiday bazaar here in Germany and saw the price of jars filled with home made toffee, I decided to come home and search for recipes. This is as good if not better! If you like Skor and Heath bars, than you'll love love love this tofee!! I didn't have a problem with separating of the butter, I did use heavy, deep pan though (it says to in the directions!) Try this!!!

I loved this recipe.  I added chopped almonds into the toffee and didn't put any on top instead.  It was a huge hit with the whole family!

it was easy to make, but it was tiring to have to stir it for so long and it took a lot longer to change color and it still wasnt  very dark, but spreading it and the chocolate were easy and it was delicious.

Easy and super delicious.  The toffee has a great flavor- buttery and rich.  I used a large baking sheet- probably 11x17. This produced toffee just over 1/4" thick- the perfect size I think.  It was easy to break apart, but not so easy that it was fragile.  Did not require my undivided attention to make, either- I stirred about every 5 minutes.  And the best part was the pan in which I boiled the toffee took no effort to clean up.  I filled it with water and came back an hour later and everything rised right off.

Woo Hoo!  This was easy and turned out really well. I have never made candy before...afraid of cooking to a perfect temp by thermometer! Heated slowly bringing up to 140C, stirred intermittently then poured over buttered parchment paper sprinkled with almonds, added chocolate and more slivered almonds...worked a treat!!

Very good.  I halved the recipe as I wanted to try it and not have too much.  Other than that I followed the recipe letting the toffee cool for 3 minutes before putting the chips on and then waiting another 3 minutes to spread them.  Start to finish (including cooling) was just over an hour and I've already tried my first piece!

This toffee was great tasting and super easy to make. I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract after taking it off the heat for extra flavor. I also lined the cookie sheet with plain parchment paper for ease of clean up. From start to finish the process took about 22 minutes. Just cut up the batches into tins for gifts. Thanks Funkeseamonkey for a great recipe!!!

I've made this twice, and will be making it today for a holiday cookie/treat exchange.  It's insanely good!  I don't use white sugar, and I've successfully made this twice with organic evaporated cane juice.  Just wanted let others who prefer a less refined sugar know that it does indeed work!

Adding to this a year later.  Making this again for a goodie exchange.  I'm thinking of adding coarse sea salt to the top of a small portion of this.  This recipe has been a huge hit and these cookie exchanges.  Everyone raves about it!

My first time ever to make toffee was last yr Dec 2009. I used this super easy recipe, added 1 tsp vanilla, used white choc chips and macadamia nuts in place of the original. 1st batch I scorched just slightly (was unsure of the amber color to bring it up to), 2nd and 3rd batches were perfect. This made super food gifts for several friends, which are now raving fans and waiting anxiously for this years Super Easy Toffee!!  A big thank you to FUNKYSEAMONKEY!

I never made toffee before and gave it a try. Read the reviews first to get all the advice before I end up with a big mess. I used light salted butter so I didn't add salt. Melt the butter first then added the sugar. After boiling the mixture for over 20 mins. on med heat, I didn't get the amber color and didn't have a candy thermometer. I increased it to med high and it got thick and started to turn amber in about 10 mins. Poured it in a buttered 13X9 pan and put the melted chocolate over it then sprinkled crushed almonds. Refridgerated it. Broke it into pieces and they were delicious. The next time I make this, I'll use a bigger pan since it was thicker than I thought they would be and harder on my teeth.

This is a really yummy and easy to make dessert. We will often cook it less so that it is more chewy. It is just a nice easy treat when you want something sweet that doesn't take a long time to make.

Whatever you do, use your candy making judgement regarding the brittle. If it is not golden in color, cook it until it is or you will have a hard time with it not being crisp. I have made toffee many times and used only the temp. on my candy thermometer. Last week when  I was in a hurry(of course), I made an expensive mistake, and I knew better! However, the taste is still amazing! I also made it with finely chopped pecans. Took it to a family reunion and still had requests for recipe. This is a very good version of a classic.

OH my goodness...YUM! It took me awhile to reach the consistenyl I needed but it finally did and it was soo good. I didnt have enough semi sweet chips so I used have semi-sweet chips and half semi-sweet baking chocolate and i melt it first. I also use djust a bit of chopped pcans instead of almonds. I ate almost the whole batch myself. My friends counldt belive I made it. im definitley making this for the holidays as gifts. I bought a candy thermometer so it should go a little faster next time.

It was my first time to make, was really easy and turned out just like I thought it should!  I fixed it just like the recipe and cooked as suggested by reviews, till paper bag color without much stirring.  It would've been 5 stars, but texture was the only thing I could hope to improve.  It wasn't grainey exactly but did not feel smooth while eating.

This is a great recipe...I also added about 1 tbsp water, and 1 tsp vanilla...no separation at all during cooking. I substituted 2 Hershey's chocolate bars for the chips, Delicious!!

perfect recipe. i used hazelnuts and it was fantastic. do not stir while cooking! that is the trick to perfect toffee. be sure you use a thick-bottomed pan.

was really simple and flavorful, however I only got it right once, not sure what I did. I later added 3 TBS of water and 1 TBS of corn syrup, I found this to be more successful.

I loved this recipe!  I used a 9x13 pan, but think I will go for a bigger pan next time because it turned out a little thick.  Also, I am wondering if I should have heated it until 290 degrees because it did not turn out as dark as the picture....but it was absolutely delicious!!!!

Easy and Delicious. This got rave reviews all around. I followed the directions for the toffee exactly and though I was very concerned at first when it started getting close to temp. it came together nicely. I toasted pecans in butter and salt first, finely chopped them and used them as a base. Then hot toffee. Then poured about half a bag of semi-sweet chips over the top, let them melt and spread it out. Drizzled melted white chocolate over that. Perfect!

I didn't care for the taste so much - the buttery part tasted a bit grainy.  It didn't set too well for me - I live in very high humid Florida, but even putting it in the fridge, when it hardened, it still had that grainy buttery taste.  I won't make it again.

I was a little nervous making this as I had never made candy before, this was so easy. I made the recipe as written and the end results were wonderful. It turned out so well, I'm making another batch today to share at work. My boys and I thank you.

This recipe was perfect! I had to let it cook at 300 for a few minutes because it wasn't dark enough yet. But it turned out perfectly, I used an icing knife to spread the chocolate and make it nice an smooth.

mmmm.... so this recipe is much better than the one i tried last night:) my texture isn't quite right, when the temp. reached 285, the color wasn't right yet. so i think  i let it get too high. next time i'll cook on low for a bit first(i have crappy pans:) ------>also, if you want to coat with chocolate i would do it after the toffee has set, and just melt choc. and short. in a bowl and pour. i tried to follow these directions and my choc. never set right.

I love this recipe for it's simplicity and flavor. I have limited experience making sweets and my first batch turned out great. I did use chopped pecans instead of almonds. I also followed the advice of prior reviewers and did not stir the toffee after it started to boil. Very Good!!

Use a wisk to stir it, will keep it from separating. Came out a little soft at 285 degrees, hardened better at 300.  I used dark chocolate chips instead.  I also used hazelnuts instead of almonds and I briefly toasted them first in a 300 degree oven and stirred some in the pot right before pouring it out, as well as put some on top of the chocolate.

I cut the recipe down to make less servings because I wanted to do a "test batch" and I am glad I did this. Like other reviewers I had butter pooled at the top which I had to pour off. I didn't read the reviews the first time but came back and made a 2nd test batch and still got butter at the top which I had to pour off - again. I was not pleased with this result at all. The end result did harden up and tasted good but while chewing on this toffee it melts but also leaves a hard bit of toffee in your mouth at the end. Also I have a major sweet tooth and after eating a piece of this, even I felt it was a bit too sugary but the good part was it still kept calling me back for more anyway. I will try a different recipe cause I just don't like this pool of butter at the top.

I have made this for several years but have always laid the small size Hershey bars on top they will start to melt right away so just take a knife and lightly spread. Much better than chocolate chip, I think.

This is a very tasty treat.  I felt mine came out a little too sugary..in a separated kind of way.  I also wasn't completely happy on how the chocolate looked on top.  I think in the future I would rather melt the chocolate and pour it on to make it have a smoother, prettier appearance.  Thank you!

This toffee was very easy.  I used a heavy bottom saucepan and cooked the butter-sugar mixture to 300 degrees which is hard-crack stage.  I used 60% cacao chips and instead of nuts which I don't like I put toasted coconut on the top.  While cooking the toffee mixture I did NOT stir constantly, only occasionally and it turned out fine.  Will make this again, was a hit at the poker game.

This was so quick and easy! Mine came out a tiny bit brittle but I was also doing it without a thermometer, so I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars! I was a little scared before I made it because in the reviews some people had trouble, but I thought it was a really simple recipe.  Will definitly make this again!

This recipe tastes really good as the end product.  I am a novice cook and made a huge mess.  The butter and sugar boiled over my pan and flooded my stove.  The chocolate chips didn't melt all the way either.  It still tastes really good though.  Has to be easier the 2nd time around.

Excellent.  My husband had a craving for toffee.  I made this for him.  He shared with friends at work.  They loved it.  My sister said that it was excellent.  It was not hard to make.  I thought that it was separating, got flustered, but it all worked out.  Tip: Don't panic.

I'm so excited! I just made a batch of the toffee and it turned out awesome! I'm now going to give my mother n law a run for her money:) Seriously, I've tried a few times to make toffee, and it didn't turn out. Next time I plan to add a bit of pure vanilla. I'll certainly make again & again. Thanks for sharing!

Super simple to make. Took almost no time to put together, and was a huge crowd pleaser.  I used half light butter and half regular butter. Worked great and was super creamy.

I love this toffee, it's exactly like the Almond Roca in the pink tins I used to get when I was little. But ever since our family moved to NZ they were forgotten as no one sells it here, it's great to bring back a good memory once in a while, thanks for sharing.

Lovely! I had no problems making this at all and it turned out delicious. I Ended up drizzling the chocolate over the toffee, because I found having a layer of chocolate on top overpowered the toffee taste somewhat.

AWESOME!!  People ask me to make this all of the time...I made a few changes to the recipe.  I use milk chocolate chips and pecans.  Also, when I am melting the butter I am constantly stirring it until it is ready to pour out.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is awesome.

I think there was too much butter in the recipe because of how it floats on top after pouring it out.  I added 2 tsp. vanilla after removing from heat, because we love vanilla.  As per another reviewer's suggestion, I boiled it until 300 F to ensure a hard crack candy.  It is delicious, though.

This was really easy to make and delicious too!  It was my first attempt at candy making, but after following mom2oovc's advice I had no problems at all.  I will definitely make this one again, but I will have to invest in a candy thermometer as i didn't use one last time and the toffee turned out a little on the sticky side.  Great Recipe. THanks!!

Success -- on my first attempt!  Here's how: I did not use a thermometer; I used fairly low heat; only stirred occassionally; I waited for the mixture to get a little darker than a paper bag (about 30 minutes, I think), then I added 1 tsp of vanilla before speading mixture onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet.  TIP: After breaking into pieces, DO store in an airtight container to retain crispness.  So amazing I made more and gave toffee to neighbors and family for Christmas!

This was my first attempt at candy making and wow I'm sooo impressed! I halved the recipe and used a cast iron skillet. I did stir occasionally as the recipe stated. It took around 25 minutes on med./low heat. I did not have a candy thermometer so I did the ice water test. I will definitely be making this again!!

I make this every year for the holidays and it's always popular. Use a good quality butter, I swear it makes a difference. I leave out the nuts as we don't like them and usually add sprinkles. Using the Hershey bars is a GREAT idea, it makes taste great and the Hershey bars melt much smoother and thinner than the chips. (I needed about one and a half of those big big bars.)

I made this a few days before Christmas and I am going to try it again soon. The butter did separate but I realize now after re-reading reviews, I over-stirred the sugar and butter mixture. After pouring off some of the butter I went on with the rest of the directions and it came out really good. I will try again and I will NOT stir constantly. Thank You

I give this a 4 due to self error. I allowed it to go 15 degrees over and it over cooked (much darker than wanted). It still came out yummy, but had a more bitter taste than one shoots for. Next time, I won't take my eyes off of it for a second towards the end of the cooking time.

I had never made toffee before and was a little worried.  I followed the advise of HipHop and it turned out just GREAT!  As a matter of fact I am going to have to make more as this is now my son's favorite.

Ok, I made this EXACTLY as directed, mixing almost constantly to try to keep the butter from seperating.  I don't know WHAT happened.  I got these little and some bigger pockets of PURE BUTTER!  While the candy tasted good, their were these butter pockets!!  I couldn't put this in my goody bags, but I did save it in case my family wanted to eat around the butter.  I think there is just TOO much butter in this recipe.  IF I were to attempt this again, I would try it with just 1 cup and see if that worked.  OR, i'll just try to find a recipe that works.  Thanks anyway!

BUTTER SEPARATION NOT A PROBLEM
Well, it wasn't a problem for me. It did separate and I did panic. I proceeded to separate as much of the butter as I could by pouring and spooning it out of the pan. I proceeded to soak up the rest of the butter with paper towels because I really, really wanted to save the batch. I don't know how the toffee's texture is supposed to turn out - mine was brittle - but I loved it! Couldn't ask for a better outcome - especially since I didn't use a candy thermometer or do the water test. I just winged it and it still turned out great!

I just made this for Christmas for my husband. Best toffee ever. SO easy. I did exactly what the recipe said and it turned out perfect! I did not alter it at all. Do not stir constantly! I only stirred a little bit. I did not have a candy thermometer, so I just cooked it until it was amber and guessed. Still turned out perfect. GREAT recipe!

Exceptional recipe!  I've never really made candy before except for fudge and this Toffee turned out 100% perfect.  I followed the directions exactly and neither added nor took anything out.  I used a very very heavy All Clad pot, didn't stir too much, kept a close eye on it and would take it off the burner occassionally if it seemed it was getting too hot.  I took the candy off the burner at about 290 degrees.  I will definitely make this again.

this was my first ever attempt at candy making.  (i used no thermometer, i just went by the color of the toffee as it cooked)  i had NO problems with the butter separating or burning.  i stirred it occasionally not constantly.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla, and incresed the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, right before i poured the toffee into the pan to cool, i stirred in chopped (and skinned) almonds.  The chocolate that melted on top, i left plain.  IT TURNED OUT FABULOUS.  almonds throughout the toffee and smooth chocolate on top.

I just finished making this and I am SO happy, it turned out great! I hope I'm not early in praising it so much, it is still chilling in the refridgerator, but it looks marvelous! I tasted a piece that dried on the spoon and it tastes great. I was so nervous about making this but I followed the instructions to the tee, cooked it to 285, used good quality butter, and it looks great. Can't wait to pass this out to my family and friends!

well I'm not giving up! but i am going to have to try it a few more times. i took the advice of a few other reviewers, and realized that everyone's stoves, and cookware, are different, and what may work for one person, may not work for the next! so i tried to cook the toffee to 300 degrees, and not stir constantly, but just frequently (which alot of reviewers mentioned) but i ended up burning it, and by the time i realized it was burning, it was too late! so i went ahead and poured into pie pans and top with chocolate and almonds (i wanted the toffee to be a bit thicker than some others pictured, so i used 2 pie pans instead of a cookie sheet) but after it cooled a bit, i tasted it and it tasted very burnt. i let it set over night to see if it would change in the morning, and it did.... slightly. but it was still burnt, none the less! i think this could be a great recipe, but i have to figure out what my stove can do, and what it can't

My little sister and mom love toffee so when I saw this recipe I figured I had to try it. I was a little skeptical at first due to some other reviewers talking about using a candy thermometer which I don't have and have never used before but then I saw a bunch of reviews that used the cold water test so I figured I could pull this recipe off with no problem. I was so right, it came out perfect!! I was so excited and it tastes just like a health bar!!! This recipe is amazing and I will be using it for years to come!!!

Oh. My. Goodness. This really is the most super easy best toffee ever. I followed the recipe exactly, except I stirred it constantly, and it came out perfectly flavored and textured. I also used evaporated cane juice rather than highly refined sugar, and it worked perfectly. And this was my first time making candy, so if I can do it, anyone can.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I so so would.  This is amazing.  Just like the toffee you buy in a fancy candy store.  Thanks to the tips that helped me get it right the first time.  YUM!!!

I've never made any type of candy before but love toffee, so I read through the reviews and thought I'd give it a try, as long as you don't heat it on too high of a heat, it's real easy.  I made two batches in one day.  I found it easier to melt the chocolate first and spread it out then pour the toffee on top of it.  Yummmm  Very good recipe

This recipe was ok, though I've found that toffee made with brown sugar has better color and flavor.  I also thought it would have been helpful to suggest a time to boil the sugar-butter mixture (for those of us without candy thermometers!).

Great recipe, I found with this one I prefer my toffee as thin as possible so next time I will use 2 prepared pans and spread quickly.  I still like a bit more crunch to my candy but if left in the fridge you will get best results.  After a few days it's better.  I had many compliments for this recipe and sent a whole bunch home to my son's girlfriend, who loved it! Great for Christmas goody gifts.

Incredible! I made four batches to give as gifts and have around the house. Every batch of toffee came out great. I never did make it up to 285 degrees on my brand new candy thermometer. I have to wonder if relying just on the thermometer determines one's success with this recipe. I just took it off the heat when the color looked right and forgot about trying to reach the correct temperature. Will purchase a different thermometer and see what happens next time. Anyway, one batch did separate from the chocolate after it cooled - and that was a disappointment. But, it still tasted great and the other three stayed in tact. All in all a success - and I will definitely be making this again.

This was pretty easy, but mine also had butter that rose to the top. I'm trying it again & hopefully I will not have the same results. What I did & it worked just fine was dab the extra butter off. Thank You for such a good recipe!

Very easy to make and it tastes SOOO good! I made it for Christmas and everyone was begging for more! =) I made i with white chocolate and no nuts. I also put the white chocolate chips on the bottom of the pan then spread the toffee on top of them (it makes them stick MUCH better).

My toffee didn't seem to turn out.  When I poured it in the pan it looked like it had alot of air bubbles in it and the butter seem to lay on top of it, didn't look very good to me.  I probably would not make this again and than again it may be that I don't know how to make it correctly either.

Absoutly fabulous and easy, it just takes time to cook. I did add the extra butter as suggested and I used Hershey Bars instead of chocolate chips. Everyone who has gotten it has raved. Thank you so much.

Just got done making this (as I have for the last several Christmas').And as usual it is wonderful.I've only had one bad batch ever.That was when I went by temp and not color.I usually toast the almonds on a un-greased cookie sheet(with all that butter and oil from the nuts you don't need any extra)and then pour the toffee over that.Very easy and very good.

Oh man! This stuff was to die for! Super crisp, melt-in-your-mouth buttery... I love it. The only thing I'll do differently next time is put the hazelnuts ontop of the toffee then put on the chocolate already melted... when I went to break these into pieces I was losing most of my nuts. I wound up using a pizza cutter to help break up the toffee. SO GOOD!

Very easy to make if your thermometer is working well. I just laid tin foil on the counter covering a large area and dumped the mixture into the middle and spread it thin. I made one batch with nuts and one without. Very, very good taste and the easy style for me was perfect.

I made this first using Blue Bonnet and it was wonderful. Then I made a couple more batches using butter and had to throw them out. (I thought I stirred too much...very gritty, didn't cook long enough..butter running all over, etc.)  But then I determined that using real butter was the problem. So using Blue Bonnet and cooking to 300 worked wonderfully.

This is the first candy I've ever made, and on the first attempt, it turned out PERFECT!! It was amazingly simple and such a beautiful looking treat. This will make perfect holiday treats for my friends and family. I used a 9"x13" pan because I wanted a little thicker. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of bittersweet. I will probably use bittersweet next time.

Made this for a bake sale and it was very easy and a hit.  I have an automated therm. which sounded when the temp was correct - made it even easier.

This Toffee is amazing!! My first (actually second) try at making any type of candy. First batch ended up a dark coffee color. It got ate regardless! :) I'll blame it on the candy thermometer. Bought a new one and this batch was perfect!! Next batch, I'll cut the chocolate chip topping in half as I feel it is to much chocolate. I'll make this for years to come and gift some this coming Christmas!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!! LOVE IT!!

The name definately says it all!  This was my first attempt at toffee...and it's a good thing that I didn't find this recipe before I developed an ounce of self-control! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

The taste was divine and it turned out great.  The problem was that I was expecting toffee and this (to us Brits) is more like brittle.  Toffee, to Brits, is chewy and this was crisp.  It is delicious and I will definately make it again but probably more as a Christmas gift! Superb buttery taste though. Nice.

I am impressed; this was easy and looks incredible (and this was my first candy-making experience to boot)! Don't be freaked out by some of the below reviews. I just stirred continuously (15 minutes?) until it turned the same color as peanut butter (which meant it was ready). I didn't have any parchment paper, so I just greased a casserole dish with a lot of butter and, after cooling completely, it actually came out of the dish really easily. This is so rich, I'd consider just making half a batch if it's just for around the house. Thanks a lot!

just made it tonight, for a lemon crunch cake im making tomorrow so didnt add choco or nuts but the toffee alone has a very good taste/consistency. however, you can forget the thermometer if you like. just do the ice water drop test and cook low/medium heat til slightly darker than peanut butter. also, i continued to stir till last two minutes. easy as can be. and that's as a first time toffee maker.

This is the recipe that inspired me to go buy a candy thermometer because of the easy instructions and ingredients. My first batch came out great. 

I used parchment paper instead of foil so the toffee came out without any problems. 
It's also important that once the toffee comes to a boil on the stove, do not over stir and leave it alone (no matter how hard it is). 
I removed it around 295F like other users have suggested and the color was a light caramel color. 
The taste was buttery and smooth.
Definitely a recipe I'll make again.

I tried this recipe tonight and just loved it. After reading some of the reviews I decided to cook it to 295 and it turned out great. It has a great texture and wonderful taste. I recently bought some at a candy shop for 22.00 per lb and this has a far better taste and texture.

So easy, yet the finished product is super impressive and always gets rave reviews.  I butter the bottom of the pan and have taken to putting down a layer of pretzels and sliced almonds over which I pour the toffee.  The pretzels give the toffee just a little more saltiness which is so popular in desserts right now.

Excellent recipe!  It's soooo easy!  This was my very first try at making any kind of candy!  It was a lot easier than I ever thought!  I stirred the nuts into the toffee, though, to give more of a nutty taste to the toffee.  It turned out great!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made the toffee/saltine recipes on this site for years, despite the fact I've had many batches turn out grainy, greasy, or sticky...but not anymore!  Granted, this is the first time I've ever made this recipe, but it came out perfectly!  I used 1 cup brown and one cup white sugar, and mixed chopped pecans into the toffee immediately before pouring it into the pan.  I put a little bit of Christmas sprinkles on the top of the chocolate, and it looks so festive!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, and for all of the helpful reviews!

This is AWESOME stuff!!!.  I made it last night and brought it in for a work party.  The key is to make sure you use the right pot and the right butter.  Use a non-Teflon Pot.  I used a Pressure Cooker Pot with Land O'Lakes Butter and Crystal Brand Sugar.  Came out fantastic.

The recipe is super easy. the first time I tried it it turned out great. However, the next times I wasted 2 batches. i read the reviews and found out that I was over stirring which caused it to seperate. Instead of chocolate chinps I used a 1/2 pound hersheys choc. bar that is melted in a double boiler and I dont use a candy thermometer. It works great and I am happy that I figured what was going wrong.

Incredible toffee recipe and very easy to follow.  This was my first time making toffee and it turned out perfectly.  I chopped almonds and sprinkld them on the parchment, then poured the hot toffee over the almonds.  On top I spread chopped pecans over the chocolate.  Friends, family, and coworkers have raved about and asked for this toffee recipe. I will definitely be making this toffee again.

Just like the title:  it really is the best and super easy!!  If I can hold off eating it all myself, these are wonderful holiday treats to give away.
Remeber to keep an eye on it, as with different altitudes, the temp may not be exactly 285.  I am near 5000 ft altitude, and it was closer to 275 for me.

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I wanted to put chocolate on both sides, and a tip for turning out of a jelly roll pan is to use another one the SAME SIZE OR LARGER, place the BACK of the pan against the candy in the pan, hold them together tightly and flip.  This way, your candy doesn't break before you have a chance to put chocolate on the other side.  Of course you need more chocolate, but what's wrong with more chocolate!

This was the first time I made toffee and it turned out magnificent! What I've noticed though, while making this toffee (and I think this may help the cooks who said this recipe made the toffee crumbly) is that the sugar is grainy until it reaches its perfect amber/caramel color and texture. So, maybe you oughta leave it in the pot for a little bit longer and it will turn out great? But what I did was made it too thick so I almost broke my teeth. Oh mon dieu!

Delicious!  I didn't put nuts on top as my daughter doesn't like nuts.  I also cooked until 295 degrees (hard crack stage).  Thank you!

This toffee did not turn out well for me. After following instructions carefully, it came out crumbly, the wrong color, and it would not even be recognized as toffee. I believe it needs to be cooked to a higher degree, and possibly longer. I'll use another recipe on this site the next time.

This is a wonderful treat!  I bring to dinner parties instead of cakes/pastries and I'm always asked for the recipe.  It is extremely yummy and easy.  I would strongly suggest to let the mixture get just a little darker than what you think is dark amber if you are not using a candy thermometer.

This was the first time I've ever made candy.  It turned out perfectly just as instructed and I was asked for the recipe by my coworkers.  I also found it easy (and actually kind of fun) to make.

My toffee had a good flavor, but the texture was not as crisp as I like.  I used a thermometer, but I think I should have taken it a little hotter.

Good but not perfect... My butter separated both times I made it according to the directions.  I think I will also use milk chocolate instead of bittersweet with almonds on both sides of the toffee next time.
I'll give it one more try!

It's as the title says, super easy. I slowly boiled it on low heat till it was a nice dark amber... but my thermometer didn't want to move to the proper temp until the very end! Had me a bit worried ^_^ Immediately poured and sprinkled on grated dark chocolate. I will never grate chocolate in winter ever again! After grating, it was statically charged to everything nearby  including me! Created a super mess but, on the flip side, it was super easy to sprinkle on the toffee and then spread it when it had melted sufficiently. Either way, it tasted perfect. Wouldn't change a thing.

Oh my gosh...this is addicting! I made 1/2 a batch last night to taste test for holiday treats and it is almost gone. Tastes just like the stuff I get at the store in the mall and it was so easy. I have never made candy before, if I can do it anyone can.  My temp came to 285 before it turned amber, I just kept stirring until it reached the amber and poured it onto the pan.  I will be making this many times more!

This is delicious.  I toasted my almonds on the stove before using them.  I also ruined the first batch because I didn't have a thermometer.  After I got the thermometer, it turned out perfectly.  I got a lot of compliments!  Thank you!

This was a huge hit for the holidays, I had to make it 3 days in a row to keep up with the request for more! It was so easy. I made only a few minor changes, instead of almonds I used pecans, and no chocolate, and sprinkled with powdered sugar once it cooled. I do recommend a candy thermometer for those not experienced in the art of candy making.

This was my first time to make candy. The flavor of this toffe was wonderful. It didnt turn out very hard though (not a problem in my opinion, I kind of liked it a bit softer) but this was my fault as I dont think I cooked the butter and sugar long enough. Thanks for the recipe!!
