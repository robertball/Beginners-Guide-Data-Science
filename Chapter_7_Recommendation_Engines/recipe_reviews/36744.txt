I've made this for company and they raved about it.  It's so easy too - I substituted the frozen petite whole green beans and it works great.  Also, I now double the garlic and ginger and it really adds a punch of flavor.

As previous reviewers suggested, I added a bit more garlic and may add a pinch of red pepper flakes next time. I also added additional veggies. I liked the idea of marinating the pork while I chopped. Nice sauce, good flavor - will definitely make again. Easily fed family of 4 (includes 2 teenagers).

Very tasty!  My husband and I don't like green beans so I substituted broccoli instead and it worked out just dandy.  I also found the sauce to be a bit thin, but this isn't a problem unless you like thick stir fry sauce.  Also, watch the sesame oil, it tends to burn quickly.

This was pretty good but I thought it could use some other veggies other than just green beans.  It was a bit salty too even though I used the reduced sodium ingredients?!

The marinade was a little blah, but the combination of the meat and cashews was great.  I used salted, since I couldn't find unsalted, but they were just fine.

I was really surprised when I tasted this, it was soooooo bland! Even though I added a LOT of ginger andd garlic, more then what was called for. Good thing I had a bottle of stir fry sauce on hand, I added some of that to it, and it saved the dish. I didn't sprinkle the cashews on top as suggested, but stirred them into the stir fry last. After doing all that, it was good.

This tasted WONDERFUL, but was pretty short on sauce.  Like other reviewers I marinated the meat in the soy/cornstarch mixture all day, and the pork was tender and very tasty.  We really enjoyed the texture of the pork and green beans together.  I would just suggest to others to make more sauce--while the meat was tender, the dish overall was a bit dry when paired with rice.

This is really good.  It tastes just like my mother-in-law's cooking who is Chinese and owned a Chinese restaurant for 30 years.  My husband was very impressed that my cooking was "as good as his mom's".  The only thing I did different was added one cup of shitake mushrooms and omitted the cashews as my family doesn't like nuts.

This was a delicous stir fry. I read the previous reviews and did make some additions though. Added half of a juliened red pepper, a half can of water chestnuts, half can of bamboo shoots and a bit of crushed red pepper towards the end of simmering. I believe toasting the cashews makes a big difference and is a cinch with a piece of foil and a toaster oven. Good stuff, and good for you.

This recipe had a nice flavor and we loved the cashews as a garnish.  I used salted cashews and brushed them off with a paper towel.  I toasted some cashews and needed more so we used untoasted and didn't really notice the difference, so next time I won't toast any!  I substituted half of the green beans for green and red peppers and onions.  It turned out great and tasted even better the next day after the flavors had time to set.

Very tasty and easy recipe.  I marinated the pork most of the day and it turned out so tender and moist.  Be sure to add the cashews to each serving vs. the entire pan if you want them to remain crunchy.  Will make again!

This recipe tasted great.  I used chicken and peanuts instead of pork and cashews.  Also, I didn't have sesame oil, so I used 1 tsp. veg. oil, 1 tsp. walnut oil, and 1tsp sesame seeds.  When I poured the chicken and sauce in to the pan, they stuck to the bottom so I added about a cup of water.  I would probably double the amount of soy sauce next time and still add water, because there didn't seem to be enough sauce.  But what was there tasted great, the fresh ginger and green beans were wonderful with the chicken.  Also, I opened a can of chicken broth and used the rest that didn't go in the recipe as part of the 'water' to cook the rice in.  All together very nice flavor and appearance!  Thanks!

I made this with broccoli since I prefer it over green beans. I also added a can of chopped water chestnuts and used brown rice instead of white. I agree that this recipe definately needed some help in the spice department. I added some 5 spice powder and then mixed up soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and a little sesame oil and tossed it in. NOW it tasted great. :)

This was really good! Even better as a leftover.
I also added shitake mushrooms. It added a nice additonal flavor and texture. Shitake mushooms and green beans are a great combination, with a soy based marinade.

"It's very delicious!"  I had to make something quick since sister was hungry, so I put these together in less than 30 mins.  She was the only one to eat it, so I can't say.  It was very easy though.  I substituted broccoli for the green beans and left out the cashews since we didn't have any.

This was great - quick, easy, tasty and healthy.  I made 1/2 the amount and added a handful of bean sprouts with the beans.  We had it on its own, didn't need the rice.

This makes a great meal.  Very tasty!  The downside is it takes a long time and there are a lot of dishes to wash after the meal is finished.

Incredibly good...tasted better than take-out.  I used a package of thinly cut pork loin chops, and will probably cut them up further next time for more bite-size pieces.  Five minutes was perfect for my green beans...make sure to salt the water well!  I used dried ginger, as well---still great!

I think I must have done something wrong.  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, so I used regular.  Sooooo salty, and I am a salt fiend.  My family thought it was just ok.

My husband couldn't get enough of this.  He wanted me to make it two nights in a row and he never wants to eat the same thing more than one time!!!  This was great recipe and has become part of my regularly scheduled meals =)

This is a very simple and yummy meal.  Very easily prepared.  The green beans have the most wonderful texture.  Not alot of labor, quick cooking time, tastes superb.

I used low-salt soy sauce and it still came out too salty for us.  Reviews said to double the sauce, so I doubled the soy sauce, which was a mistake.  I will try it again using the directions as written.

This is in regular rotation at my house, though I do make a couple changes.  First, I cut the soy sauce amount in half and make up the difference with rice vinegar or rice wine.   Second, I double the garlic and add a little sambal oelek or red pepper flakes to taste.  Lastly, I don't pre-cook the beans, but stir-fry them with some oyster mushrooms until crisp tender before returning the pork to the pan.  Very tasty.

Used water chesnuts instead of Cashews to give a little bite.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it, but I felt it needed more sauce and maybe a little spice.  I definately will try making it again with these changes.

This is a great recipe...easy, tasty, versatile, fast...what more could you want?  If you're craving authentic-tasting chinese food, this is the recipe.  I used onions, broccoli, and green peppers in place of the green beans.

AWESOME! We loved this recipe. I reccomend laying out all your ingredients and placing them in small containers like they do on the cooking shows because the cooking is fast. Easier to have everything at your fingertips. We liked this recipe so much that I bought a wok shaped pan just to make this recipe (and other stir frys) I could not find small cashews so I bought whole ones and chopped them up, placed them in a pan and sprinkled sesame oil over them. Then, I broiled them for a few minutes until they were crispy. Thanks for the add- one of our favorites.

Good basic stir fry recipe.  Next time I'll reduce sesame oil to 1 teaspoon.  Would probably work well with broccoli, maybe scallions and matchstick carrots too.  Sauce needs something - perhaps a teaspoon of hoisin?

I know I'm minority here, but this dish was missing something. I'm from the south and EVERYTHING is bursting with flavor here! I made peanut cilantro sauce for our egg rolls and ended up pouring that on this dish. Hubby and kids did the same. Sorry :(

Wow this recipe is so delicious!  I've been looking for a pork dish that wasn't too dry and this is it!  Everything I needed was already in my kitchen, only the green beans which I substituted for frozen stir-fry vegetables.  But next time I'll definitely follow the recipe as it would probably be much better!  Thanks

This was a good stir fry!  We added a chopped onion and sauteed it before adding the beans.  Also, we used Chinese style long beans instead of regular green beans which turned out delicious!  Sub'd guar gum for a thickner instead of cornstarch and veggie 'steak' strips for meat.  Next time will add more veggies for some variety.

Really a great basic stir fry recipe.  I have never added corn starch at the marinating stage - great idea.  While cooking, it allowed for the pork to stick and brown, leaving all those 'yummies' on the bottom of the wok.  You could add whatever veggies you like (mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, sub broccoli, sub asparagus, sub bok choy) that you like.  What is not variable is the liquid at the end, but you could sub white wine or cooking sherry instead of chix broth.  The reason for four stars instead of five was that I believe you can skip blanching the beans....it's the nature of "Stir Fry."  This will be in my permanent recipe box.  Thanks!

This was SO good! The pork was so tender and flavorful. I added some extra garlic, but otherwise cooked recipe as directed. I let the pork marinate while I prepared everything else. I highly recommend this dish!!

I have made this twice in 2 weeks.  It's so simple and wonderful.  I did follow the advice of the reviewer who bought pre-marinaded pork (first time was with the peppercorn, second with teriaki- didn't seem to make a difference).  I also added some red bell flavor for color.  I highly recommend this.  The cashews are fabulous!

I made this recipe with broccoli (one of my favorite veggies) instead of green beans. I skipped the boil/blanch stage and this came out great! I also bought a peppercorn marinated pork tenderloin, which added some pep to the end product. Great recipe overall, and easy to experiment with!

I loved this recipe! I'm not crazy about green beans but I ate all of mine in this recipe. The cashews, toasted, makes this dishes even better. I will make this again.

Very good!  We added mushrooms, bell pepper and onions--not because it needed it, but just because we love those ingredients--and of course a little more seasoning (red pepper, black pepper, and salt)  We loved it and will definitely make it again.

Unbelievable recipe!  This was absolutely easy and great tasting! I have never made Chinese food before and this is just as good as eating it at a restaurant. I used salty cashews and brushed them off and didn't toast them, but it was still wonderful. Next time I will boil the green beans for a little longer than five minutes.

i substituted pork chops cut in thin slices & didn't use fresh ginger, but this was still pretty good.  it tastes like stir-fry, nothing special but i think it's good enough to make again.

This recipe was very yummy!  I used a 14.5 oz can of green beans rather than fresh ones, which made the cooking a little faster and easier....and it still tasted wonderful!  Very good recipe and I am glad that it is a healthy one.  I served it over rice vermicelli rather than rice.  A++!

This is so yummy and not too hard or time consuming to make!  Probably as kid friendly as stir-fry can get.

The hardest part of this dish is cleaning and cooking the beans.  A very tasty and simple to make dish.  It is definetly a dish I will make again.
