I love this fruit salsa and use a raspberry all fruit spread for the preserves. I've made it before and the homemade chips take a lot of time and pans. I was feeding 12 for dinner tonight, so I opted for Stacy's Cinnamon and Sugar Pita Chips.

I made this for a get together and everyone really loved it.  I used kiwi, strawberries, peaches, and blueberries with 3 Tbs peach preserves.  I baked the chips for 8 minutes, turned them over and baked an additional 4 minutes.  I thought the chips could be a bit crisper, but maybe I should bake them longer.

I make it this way all the time.  I do sometimes add a little Splenda and maybe some brown sugar depending on the sweetness of the fruit.  I have also melted Ghiardelli dark chocolate chips and drizzled the chips lightly for a special treat.     Also I added my chocolate mint from the garden chopped finely.  Any mint or even Basil would add some nice flavor to it.

I added some grapes, blueberries and juice from one lime.  I used one tablespoon of orange marmalade and two tablespoons of strawberry preserves. This recipe is great and you can add any fruit.  It can be made with whatever is in season or on hand. My son loves it! One minor issue my chips were not really crunchy, but I like this salsa with regular tortilla chips.

I absolutely love this recipe.  The fruit really does not need any sugar if you use 3 T of preserves.  It's seriously one of my favorite snacks!

So yummy, I use this on hot cereal, with yogurt, mixed into cream cheese with a whole wheat bagel, and on top of cottage cheese. Its an all purpose fruit condiment next time I will double and freeze.  :3  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  =D

This was very tasty and easy to make. I did bake the chips for 15 minutes to give them a little more crisp.

This is my very favorite thing to make! I sometimes dice up different fruit combinations to have a different experience.

Loved this recipe! My daughter used it for a school assignment but just used what we had on hand. (strawberries, pears, apples) And it was still great!
