it was really easy to make but i usually like my green beans on the crunchy side so simmering for 45 minutes was way too long for my taste. however, the sauce was really nice and i added some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a kick. not sure if the sauce would have been as mellow and sweet if i didn't simmer for 45 minutes. maybe next time i will simmer the sauce first and add the green beans in the last 15 minutes or so. the sauce never thickened.

This is a great recipe! I added a clove of garlic and a little cayenne pepper and used fresh parsley from the garden. This went great with our grilled chicken.

After reading reviews, this is what I did.  Omitted the cup of water, sauce thickened nicely.  Sauted 1 small sliced onion and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms in 1/4 cup of oil and added to the simmering sauce with 2 teasp. of minced garlic.  Let simmer 1/2 hr., then added 3/4 lb. of fresh green beans and simmered about another 20 min.  We like our veggies with a bit of crunch to them. Delicious.

I've tried so many versions of this recipe trying to replicate the amazing greek style green beans in Chicago's Greektown restaurants which have rich and decadent sauces without tons of acidity -- this recipe comes close, but after so many tries and reading so many reviews, I made a few changes to this one as well.  

Sauteed on low to medium heat a very rounded cup of vidalia diced onion in about a generous 1/4 cup of olive oil.  S&P the onion while cooking. Cook until translucent about 6-8 minutes.    Carefully added 2 healthy size diced cloves of garlic for only 30 - 45 seconds [watch so it does not burn].   
Drained and added one 28 ounce can of diced organic tomatoes, reserving the liquid.  Added one small 8 ounce can of tomato sauce.  To all of this, added about 1.5 tablespoon of dried oregano (rub in your hands to release the oils), ~ 1/8 cup of fresh parsley [just had the fresh on hand].  Little more S&P. Used 4 tablespoons of that reserved liquid here.  Brought to a boil.  Added 3 cans of organic [drained] green beans [trial and error with this recipe has sold me on canned green beans for the texture and they marry well with the other ingredients.]  Add the lemon.  AND, 2 tablespoons of sugar (pinch just doesn't do it for us).    Simmered for 25-30 minutes at the very end it was still a little too acidic -- a chef once told me to add butter to reduce the acidity from tomato based sauces.  Added 1 tablespoon butter.    Really, really good.

Do not use 3/4 c. olive oil.  This is way too much.  I used 1/4 c. and it did not take away from the taste, and I probably could have used less.   I also added 2 cloves of garlic and used the full can of tomato sauce rather than 8 oz. listed in the recipe.  With these changes, the recipe was great!

I have been searching for this recipe for quite some time!  I once tried a similar dish at a Greek Fair and I was forever hooked. The beans are so flavorful and they practically melt in your mouth.  Yum!

Very nice...I added a pinch of sugar to the sauce and extra lemon juice after it was done.  Served with rice, it hit the spot.

I searched for this recipe after having the green beans in tomato sauce at the local greek restaurant. Made them for dinner last night, and definately spot on! The only addition I made was to add about 1/4-1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, which I definately recommend adding. I served it with 1/4 cut roasted potatoes, homemade tzatziki, and pita bread. My extremely carnivorous boyfriend didn't even notice there was no meat or that it was a healthy meal. I will definately be serving this often.

I made these for Thanksgiving to be healthier and because they have a lot of flavor. I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 28 oz chopped tomato with the juice, and a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper, cooked 40 min with lid on and 5 without so the sauce would be thicker. There was just my husband and myself and I plan to make Alton Brown's baked brown rice to go with the leftovers.

I totally omitted a few things from this recipe since I didn't have everything on hand. I omitted the olive oil and lemon juice and I used canned green beans and these were still a nice twist to the same boring thing. Thanks for sharing.

This was great!  I only used about 2 teaspoons of olive oil to saute the onion in.  The amount called for in the recipe was just way too much.  Then instead of water, I used chicken broth.  I also probably used 1/4 more liquid than the recipe called for.  Instead of tomato paste and canned tomatoes, I used two vine-ripened tomatoes.  This recipe was delicious.  It tasted just like what they serve at a local Greek restaurant.  I'll definately make it again.

I could eat it but it was very bland.  It was straight tomatoes.  I don't know what flavors exactly it was lacking for me, but it was something.  Guess it just wasn't the flavor I was going for.

Very good easy and different side dish. I always try the recipe as is and rate it on that. Sure you can tweak it to your taste or even almost change the recipe entirely but when people do that I discount their ratings as I feel they are actually rating their own "new" recipe.

Use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce ... so much better with a nice thick sauce that sticks to the green beans for a full flavor bite.

Yummy, very similar to a favorite side at a nearby Greek restaurant.  I like to add carrots and top with some fresh parsley and onion.
