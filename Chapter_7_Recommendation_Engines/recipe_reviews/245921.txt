I reserve 5 starts for  foods that are so good Odin would want to enjoy in Valhalla .   Although this dish didn't make me slam the table with my fist at the first bite, it's nonetheless worth having in the recipe box for the times you didn't to take the meat out of the freezer in time to thaw out properly.   It's satisfying and has a lot a great flavor.  Excellent with potato wedges and a side of broccoli.

I am always looking for sandwich ideas, this recipe was fast and tasty.  For 6 servings, you would need to be pretty stingy filling up the bun. 4 servings only.

WOW, this was a HUGE hit with my family!!!!! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing...my only criticism is that this did not make enough for 6 sandwiches, I only got 4, but I guess if I would've used less filling per sandwich I could've streched it, but I wanted nice, full sandwiches. I would def double this next time for my family, as we all really, really, LOVED this sandwich. The kids were calling them 'sloppy kielbasa sandwiches', and I think that was perfectly fitting, lol! I served them with curly fries, which made for a perfect, fun and delicious dinner. This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was rich and filling.  I followed the directions and served on half an onion bun.  However, I sauteed the vegetables longest and then added the meat.  This meat is already cooked and didn't need much except browning.  I used low sodium ketchup and this was plenty salty.

Made it as described but omitted celery and carrot because my kids would have picked it out. It was still delicious.  Fed 4 people easily.

This was a tasty sandwich.  I made very few changes.  I don't like onion so I omitted that.  I used baby carrots and 3 stalks of celery to give it more crunch since I omitted the onion.  I saluted the sausage/veg mix in a non stick skillet sprayed with cooking spray.  For the sauce I added 1 TBS of White Rice Vinegar.  This was an easy, tasty sandwich and I will make it again.

We thought this was a super delish sandwich, which we enjoyed last night during the big game. I followed the directions, using a handful of baby carrots in place of one regular carrot.
It was quick to prepare, and had a great flavor. We liked it so much, I might have to double it next time!
