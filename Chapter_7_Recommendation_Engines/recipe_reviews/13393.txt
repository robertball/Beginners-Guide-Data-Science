Thoroughly enjoyed this light and easy to make soup. I changed a few things. First adding some very thinly sliced carrots (lengthwise) and thinly sliced mushrooms. I sauteed all the veggies including the green onions and the ginger with the pork. Turned out delicious!

Excellent.  I used a canned chicken broth by Swanson with chinese writing on the can, and I added baby corn cut into little rounds, plus a few drops of sesame oil.  Very delicious, next time time I'll add different vegetables.

This is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best soup I have ever made. I doubled the ginger and added some garlic, a little extra soy sauce, and had to use chicken instead of pork. It was fabulous! It was all gone PDQ.

A keeper - quick and easy to prepare.  I had a few slices of leftover roast pork from dinner the other night so I made this recipe exactly as called for except for the pork part.  I sliced the already cooked pork into slivers and added it to the soup at the end of cooking.  I also added a tablespoon of chinese garlic chili sauce to give it an extra kick - but that was only a preference.  Now I have a great, easy recipe to put together when there is a small amount of pork leftover.  Thanks submitter!

This soup was easy to make and pretty good. We added 7 large fresh mushrooms (thinly sliced), 3 serrano peppers (for heat), 3 cloves of garlic, and extra cabbage. Instead of decreasing noodles as other reviewers suggested, we increased the amount of chicken broth and added 1 TBS fish sauce and increased soy sauce to about 4 TBS. This made the soup much more flavorful.

This was a very good recipe that was also quite healthy. I did fiddle the recipe up a little, following the suggestions of other reviews and taking it a step farther. I decreased the amount of noodles, doubled the ginger, added 3 cloves of garlic, and a touch of sesame oil at the very end. The canned broth I used tasted fabulous by the end of it all! This will definitely be made again at my house.

Simple, easy, delicious recipe. I added slivered carrots for more veggies for the kids. My 9-yr-old loved it and wanted leftovers in his thermos for lunch.

This is a great Recipe. Hubby liked it so much he asked me to make it again the next night. I did add a clove of garlic with the Cabbage and pork and I also grated the ginger instead of mincing it.

I've made this recipe dozens of times for my family, it is a favorite. Quick and easy, tastes wonderful. We do vary a few things: We add sesame oil, a few drops of chili oil, garlic, ginger, and shredded carrots.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Although it was easy to make, it lacked something. I added a few drops of sesame seed oil, and that helped a little.

I thought this soup was really really good.  I quadrupled the recipe which made a ton of soup.  But somehow we managed to eat it all!  I did not have enough chicken broth, so used a combination of Chicken broth, Veggetable broth and chicken boulion.   I used a little less green onions because my kids aren't big on onions.  They liked the noodles but not too big on the broth.  I think it needs some slight tweeking - perhaps next time I will use a little more ginger.  Also thought it was much better the second day.

This was a very tasty recipe. We made it with chicken, pork and both of them together and it tasted great. I used less broth and made less "soupy", but that is my for my preference. It became a steady dish for us.

This soup was good, my family loved the pork, cabbage and udon noodles.  However, no one finished the broth.  I used low sodium chicken broth, maybe that's why??

Was just ok.  Soup was a little greasy from the frying of the cabbage and onion.  Tasted alright but won't make again.

I put my own spin on this excellent recipe. I omitted the noodles, added a ton of garlic and yellow onions and carrot slivers, more soy sauce and i used ginger powder, because that's what I had. I sauteed all the vegetables except the carrot before putting them in the stock--this gave them extra flavor. If I'd had it, I would have added dark sesame oil, as one user suggested. This was intensely delicious. Yay!

This was very, very good and exceptionally easy to prepare.  I replaced some of the veggie oil with sesame oil and used 1/4 tsp ground ginger since I didn't have fresh.  I also added a shredded carrot. The kids had colds/upset stomachs, and this was gentle yet nourishing.  They ate it well, and we enjoyed it for lunch the next day.

With a couple of additions, this was a really tasty soup. I added garlic and onion powders, sesame oil, more soy sauce than stated and some Kale for color. Because of the Kale, I had to cook the soup longer. Family loved it Corwynn!

I added the thinly sliced carrots and the mushrooms to the recipe. It was quite easy to make, even for me a university student. Plus my roommate who usually only eats chocolate and cookies even ate a whole bowl full and found it quite delicious.

I changed this up a little bit, reducing the chicken broth and thickening it to make it a sauce and adding crushed red pepper flakes for heat. Excellent!

Keep the noodles.  In fact, I added more noodles and less broth and also added a bunch of carrots and celery.  I'm a starving student, I don't want a wimpy soup.  It was fabulous.

WOW -- This soup is unbelievably good.  I did follow the advice of a few other reviewers and sauteed the ginger (plus extra ginger) and minced garlic along with the pork.  Simple and delicious.  My thanks for the post.

We doubled the pork and cabbage, added more broth, and doubled the soy sauce. (We like things salty.) VERY delicious. And easy!

Awesome quick and easy way to use up leftovers. The results are always a success despite substitutions. I like how it reminds me of Phõ soups.

I substituted a rotisserie chicken for the pork and added 1/2 tbsp of garlic and 1/2 tbsp of crushed red peppers for a little heat. I couldn't find Chinese noodles so I used lo mein.
this recipe is fantastic and will definitely go into my favorites list.

The thing I like about Allrecipes is people give you an idea & because our tastes all vary, you can modify to suit your palette. This recipe is good for a base for us & we took the recommendation of several of the reviews & made a great soup. We added mushrooms, carrots, sesame oil, a little celery & I always use home made chicken stock. Hands down one of the tastiest soups we've had.

5 star after I made some changes! I used about a pound of pork tenderloin, added some flavor to the broth by frying the meat in sesame oil and chile oil. I added garlic with the minced ginger and added fish sauce to the broth. I shredded the cabbage finely and added it raw, along with raw green onions finely chopped and some thin sliced jalapeño peppers. With some extra punch it was awesome!

This is really easy to make and tastes delicious. My brothers loved it. I followed the recipe on this one but after having tried it I think you could add a lot of different veggies and it would still be really good. I did add the onions in earlier with the chicken broth so that it could build more flavor in the broth. It's a really hearty soup for fall and doesn't take long to make.

This is my new favorite soup! After reading reviews I took some advice and added 1/4 tsp sesame oil, 1 Tbl fish sauce, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest, and 1 1/2 c sliced mushrooms, . It has a lot of noodles but I liked that (I used Pad Thai rice noodles). Definitely top it with some fresh thai basil and cilantro.

I followed the directions and the result was not good. The seasoning is way off (needed so much more soy/salt, and it still tasted bland after I added more). If I were to redo this recipe, I'd lightly cook the pork separately with generous seasoning so it doesn't overcook when trying to fry the vegetables. Also, cabbage is so bland and sad looking. Bok choy would be a much better choice. Or pretty much anything green and fresh. And as for the seasonings, this needed way more ginger, more soy, a bit of garlic, and a sweet component like honey (or even carrots) to compliment the soy and ginger. Just SOMETHING to give it some depth of flavor. Beef broth also seems like a more flavorful choice than chicken. Definitely never making this again.

This was a quick an easy meal.. Make sure to add garlic and sesame seed oil. I didn't add as much past either.. The leftovers still even sucked up allot of the juice. Overall decent.

Awesome soup! Super easy to make. You have to add mushrooms though, it makes it so much better. I also always make it with chicken instead of pork for a healthier soup. Once made it without any noodles and a lot of cabbage and mushrooms and loved it as well maybe more! You can also add some mire ginger. I got nuts for it. The best: it looks like a chef made it.

We just made this and it was fabulous.  For people who think it's a little bland try adding more ginger.  The ginger I bought for this I used all of not just what the recipe called for.  I just didn't know what else I might use the ginger for so I didn't want it to go to waste.  If I had measured the ginger I would say it was like 1 1/2 tablespoons of ginger.  My husband says it reminds him of the soup they serve at the Japanese hibachi restaurants only mine is much better.  We will definitely make this again.

This soup is absolutely delicious. Quick and easy to make. We had a cold night and I felt like soup found this recipe and made it, only exception I cannot use pork, for allergic reactions in the family so I used diced chicken and even my 2 girls ate it that don't like soup at all. Winner, I will make this again. Thanks for sharing

Terrific recipe!  I accidentally let the soup boil vigorously for several minutes and the pork remained tender despite my lack of attention!  I added 5 cloves of garlic and some julienne carrots--just my preference, and I thought the carrots added some color.  I served with egg rolls and salad--an easy weeknight meal that all five of my family members enjoyed.  Thanks, Corwynn!

Great recipe!  They now have Thai Ginger infused broth. Maybe Swanson. Great flavor!  I also add bean spouts and fresh mushrooms. Great light soup!

I follow the recipe to a T and it is great! it would make four really really big servings--it feeds all six of us with some left over so maybe keep that in mind as you are planning dinner. I usually serve it with homemade dumplings. Use fresh cabbage by the way, the preshredded stuff is horrible. Please do not ruin your soup with it!!! Take an extra minute to chop it yourself, you will be glad you did.

It seemed like lots of cabbage to not enough meat.  I doubled the soy sauce added LOTS of extra ginger & added garlic & tiny corns and carrots and some sesame oil, but it still didn't seem TERRIBLY flavorful to me.  It was pretty good, but I'm not really excited about the leftovers, so I don't know that I'd make it again.  And my 3 and 6 year old didn't care for it.

So Yummy! I've already made this a few times, and agree with others that a little garlic adds a nice touch. This recipe can be easily altered to be vegetarian. Use vegetable both instead of chicken, and fired tofu in place of ham (cooked separately and added just before serving).

This is a fantastic recipe! Very quick, but very tasty. I didn't have Chinese noodles and used orzo pasta instead, and it was still just delicious

Very easy for a week night dinner.  As some reviewers suggested, I added shredded carrots, used rice noodles and added some diced water chestnuts that needed to be used up.  Everyone loved it; I was hoping for leftovers, but there were none.  Next time I will double this.  Thanks for sharing, CORWYNN DARKHOLME.    This is a definite keeper!
