First just let me say that this dish is delicious. I'm not sure I made it properly. I tried following the directions, but I'm not sure that cacciatore is supposed to fall apart like that. Perhaps six hours is too long? It was more like a pulled pork than a traditional cacciatore. With chicken or rabbit, you generally have distinct pieces of the animal to serve. But it does hold up to its title of being melt in your mouth! I have a tone of leftovers, but it will go quickly because it is that good. I served this with pasta rather than the suggested mashed potatoes, but I can see how it would be good partnered with mash.

I modified the recipe by cooking it for 9 hours on high.  Adding another 1/2 cup of wine and more spice.  It melted in my mouth after that.  I'm serving it three ways.  One with egg noodles and have garlic bread on hand to slop up the sauce.  Two over rice and three over mashed potatoes.

This was delicious!  I was pressed for time so I couldn't make it in the slow cooker as I had planned.  I  cut the roast into bite sized peices and dredged them in flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I browned the beef in olive oil, removed it from the pot  and sauteed the veggies in the same pot.  Once the veggies were tender, I added the wine and cooked it down for a few minutes.  Then I added the beef back in along with the remaining ingredients.  I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper and I used beef broth instead of water.  I simmered it for two hours.  I served it over egg noodles.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this again!

I leave out anything that generates spicy heat because my system won't take it, but other than that followed the recipe. What's the word? Scrumpdilyicious!!!

I cut the beef into small cubes. Then I marinate the beef over night in some wine. The next morning, I cooked the beef in the skillet as suggested. I followed the recipe to a T. all I can say is AMAZING. My wife and I just loved it. Thanks for sharing. Slow Cooker Bill

It's a great recipe. Could not be easier with the crock pot.  The only thing I did differently was to pull large chunks of the beef out, as you would a pot roast, put that on a bed of noodles and then pour the sauce over everything.  It did not look appetizing to me as a "pulled pork" texture.  The meat does fall apart very easily and it truly melts in your mouth.  Great comfort food dish that is set it and forget it.
