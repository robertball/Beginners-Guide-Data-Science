This dip is good with wings and with roasted potato wedges. It is not great with crackers or chips. When I first made it, it tasted like canned tomato  soup. I allowed the flavors to blend for 90 minutes and it tasted better. I think the addtion of a little hot sauce would be good. If you didn't want heat, a little garlic salt and onion powder would make a good addition.

I truly think this would work best as a salad dressing. As for a dipping sauce I added Sriracha to taste. The sweet heat of the Sriracha made this a 5 star recipe. Thank you for sharing this JULIE0330.
