I don't have a rice cooker however I do have an instant pot, and so I saut√©ed the rice in a little bit of olive oil until it was translucent, then added the chicken broth and cooked for 7 minutes on high pressure. Afterwards I added the Parmesan cheese I tasted it and decided it needed a little bit of garlic powder. Otherwise without the addition of garlic powder it was a pretty good risotto. This could be improved with a little bit of white wine.

This was sooo good.  It made making risotto very simple.  The instructions for cooking it in the rice cooker were clear and worked well in both our small rice cooker and our larger one.

I had trouble finding instructions on how to make arborio rice in my rice cooker (which I love!) so this recipe was  greatly appreciated!  Turned out perfectly, so I'll be using this again and again! Thank you!!!

Mine turned out mushy. I'll stick with the stove top.
