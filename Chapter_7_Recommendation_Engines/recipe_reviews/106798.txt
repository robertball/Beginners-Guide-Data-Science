Try replacing 1 cup of the rice squares with 1 cup corn squares, add 1/8th tsp of garlic powder to the egg whites, and after the mix has been baked and cooled fold in 1 cup wasabi peas.  Delicious.

Great snack!  I substituted corn chex and mixed nuts for the pretzels and oyster crackers-wonderful!  My 10 year grandson enjoys it for an after school snack.  We all enjoy the low sugar content of a sweet snack, there are 2 type II diabetics in this house.

Love this recipe, had it at a friends BBQ and had to have the recipe. I was surprised to know it was made with Splenda. I'm diabetic so this is awesome snack for me.
