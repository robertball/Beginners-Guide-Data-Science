I made this cake with a few revisions, it is excellent.  I used  two cups chunky apple sauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Also added 1/2 cup extra flour, to make up for added moisture of applesauce.  When I made the glaze I added 1/4 cup Brandy instead of vanilla, remove from flame when adding it.  It is now one of my favorites.

Loved by lots when I made. I made this according to recipe with some small changes because I didn't have everything on hand. My changes were since I didn't have allspice I used 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove and 1/4 teaspoon of grated whole nutmeg. I also didn't have quiet a half cup of half and half so I added dark rum, around 2 tablespoons. I think this actually thinned the glaze a tad, but it soaked into the cake and made it super moist. It was definitely a hit and also a goner. Will make again!!!

Man, oh man, this is a delicious cake. I followed the recipe exactly, except used a caramel glaze instead. The cake itself is now my only way to kick off Autumn. Hearty yet super moist- simply awesome.

Made this cake for my family last evening. Served it while it was still a little warm and not one piece was left. I did add some extra spices to the cake like 1 teaspoon each of ginger and nutmeg then 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. I only used 1/2 cup of crop pecans in the glaze. The glaze harden into a candy like shell which broke a part when we cut into it. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the guess just gathered up the broken pieces and ate that too. Already getting request to make it again.

Nice cake recipe but the best part is the "glaze".  I have frequently made the praline glaze as a candy for parties.  We use heavy whipping cream and let them set up in mini cupcake liners.  We also prefer to use chopped pecans.

This was excellent!!  Made it according to the recipe and it turned out to me, perfectly.  We had friends over when I  just took it out of the oven and didn't have a chance to put the praline on the cake.  So when it cooled, they had a piece and suggested not to put the praline on.  My husband also asked me not to put anything on not even a glaze. They won, I left it plain and it was still so good. Everyone has their own opinion!!

We made this twice - it is one of our favorites - it is divine - thanks Jim!!  Only question I have it - how do you cook the glaze and keep it glossy - once it cools and sits it gets dull.  But that doesn't affect the taste :~))
