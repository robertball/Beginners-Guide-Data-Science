I made this salad for our Mother's Day celebration.  My mother wanted a luncheon of salads.  I wanted to try some salads that were not so ordinary and routine, and this salad really fit the bill!  It is a beautiful salad with lots of color.  (I used an orange bell pepper instead of the green.)  Everyone loved it!  And we were all pleased at the healthier choice it offered us over mayonnaise laden potato salad.  Definitely a keeper!  I'll make it again and again.

Ingredients were a little pricey for one side dish, and the serving number is way off.  I made the dish without modifying and ended up with a roaster pan full.  Fortunately, I was making it for a youth gathering and needed alot.  Sadly, I bought enough ingredients to double it and ended up using only half.  I heard back that this was one of the favorites of the teenagers.  They loved that it had no eggs or mayo.

I came across this while searching for a recipe to use up the head of red cabbage.  A little different, but tasty and pretty nonetheless.  I cut the recipe in half, but then only used 4 red potatoes (instead of 7).  I also had only 1/2 a red pepper, I didn't bother to buy the other 2 colored peppers.  I added the dressing and it was soaked up immediately, probably because I didn't let the potatoes cool completely.  Anyway I ended up making twice as much dressing just to get it going.  Also added a splash of red wine vinegar, it seemed to need it.

I would give it a ten if I could, I just found this to be very good & more like a meal in one with the potatoes and beans. I didn't have the romano cheese but it didn't need it. Excllent on a hot day or not. Will be making this again ;-)

I made this for my daughter's high school graduation party and it was a huge hit with all our guests, from the grandparents down to the teenagers.  I followed the recipe except that I almost doubled the ingredients for the dressing.  Making the amount of dressing listed left it too dry in my opinion.  I have made it for several other occasions and I always get great compliments on it.

I made this recipe for a pot luck.  It was a great hit.  I used balsamic vinegar/oil/ dijon dressing, instead of just the oil.  I just made it again.  I guess this recipe will be my take to party recipe for the summer.

This was very good, but the quantity is huge. That wasn't a problem for us  because we just continued eating it through the week. Still tastes good the next day although the potatoes do get soggy. The other vegetables stay crisp. As good as this salad is, I think the dressing needs some zip. I may tweak it with some vinegar next time I make it.

This recipe is lovely, the flavors and textures are well-balanced. Tasty and refreshing. BUT it makes way more than 8 servings. More like 16. I hope the ladies at the bag lunch meting are hungry!

Excellent recipe.  A few tips to make it perfect: 1) I used only 8 red potatoes instead of 14.  This way, you can get more flavor from the veggies.  2) Make sure the potatoes are fully cooled before adding them to the dish (2 hours in the fridge will do.)  3) I added about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper to the dish.

The best thing I can say about this is that it's different. I found it very labor intensive and only passable in flavor. Glad I try out recipes before making them for pot lucks!

A couple of tweeks to this recipe elevated it from good to outstanding.  When I fist started making this, it was welcome.  Later, it was requested.  Now I get orders for it from a friend with a cetering business on the side.

Substitute apple cider vinegar, add honey or maple syrup to add some body to the dressing, use whole grain french mustard, cut the potatoes raw and sprinkle liberally with paprika and chili powder and toss them in olive oil before microwaving, let sit until they come to room temperature, and most important, use fresh corn baked in the oven or grilled and then sliced off the cob into a bowl. If fresh corn is not available, I use frozen. I use green and yellow squash in summer and cabbage in winter.

This was good but not great.  I had to add a splash of red wine vinegar as suggested by another reviewer.   Even then I think it needs twice as much dressing.  We really couldn't taste the dressing at all.  I had no romano cheese so we used feta and it was a good option - salty and very tasty among the mild veggies.  Thanks for the recipe;  I'll make it again with the extra dressing.

My husband wanted me to make potato salad, but I wanted a healthier version without so much mayo.  I was VERY disappointed!  I should have read the reviews before making it.  I agree that it needs LOTS more dressing!  I couldn't taste ANY!  Adding vinegar is also a good idea, since olive oil doesn't have much taste anyway.  There was definitely something missing.  I was embarassed to show up at a picnic with it.  Sounded like a great idea for something different.  But, I don't think I dare try it again.

Very tasty and light - perfect for hot nights.  My kids love it and I can get all these veggies in them at once!  I decreased the amount of most ingredients for a smaller batch.  Very pretty - a good one to take to potlucks!

I liked the collection of veggies. Great color and textures. As to flavor, I expected it to have a bit more zing. I might try adding some balsamic vinegar next time. But quite good overall.

Based on other reviewers, I cut the recipe in half; but doubled the dressing adding some red wine vinegar.  All of the veggies were fresh from the garden which really perked up the flavors.  I served the Romano on the side for individual tastes.  There is leftovers for tomorrow and maybe even the next day.  This does make alot!!  Kimberly, thank you for sharing something new for us to try.

I didn't have the mustard or the Romano cheese. I used an herb dressing instead.
Taste is phenomenal.

My new favorite salad! It's so beautiful and so delicious.  Instead of canned corn, I used frozen organic corn. First, I drizzled both the corn and red potatoes with olive oil and sea salt and roasted them and set aside to cool. I also substituted the Romano cheese with herbed goat cheese and garnished with fresh avocado slices. Seriously scrumptious!
