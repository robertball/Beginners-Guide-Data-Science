Really enjoyed everything about this recipe.  Only thing I did differently was thicken the sauce with a little bit of a cornstarch slurry.  I'd recommend that you double the marinade because the sauce is so good, you'll want more!----UPDATE 6.17.13------Here's another reason to make enough for leftovers.  I always make extra marinade for extra sauce.  I had some leftover pork from a dinner two days ago, so I heated the leftover marinade, shredded the leftover pork, and added it to the marinade, warming briefly.  Use this as a filling for a flour tortilla burrito, topping with shredded cabbage and carrots, and fold up burrito style.  My husband loved this!!

Awesome!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast and thigh meat (what I had on hand) and I also added sliced orange and red sweet peppers to add some color and crunch and then served everything over thin noodles YUM

FABULOUS!  I've never written a review before but I search and research this recipe over and over.  Don't forget to keep the marinade to simmer in pot and add as sauce when serving. The perfect balance of citrus, cilantro, garlic and ginger!!!  Culinary worthy!!

OMG so good.  The combination of the sauce ingredients is perfect and we could almost taste a hint of everything.  I only marinated for about 2 hours but will do overnight next time - definitely will be making this again!  I will also increase the sauce, which I thickened just slightly with a little corn starch, probably will double it.  Served with steamed rice and green beans and the sauce is awesome on everything. Another keeper!
Ended up making this again tonight (2 nights in a row) but with chicken  - great either way!

Hmmm...everyone else that reviewed thought this was really good except for me and my family.  None of us liked it very much with the main complaint being that you could taste the peanut butter too much.  Perhaps the brand I used was too strong?  Not sure but it basically tasted like spiced up peanut butter that was heated and poured over pork.

Very good!  I used a chili-garlic sauce in place of the red pepper flakes (but still added some garlic, too!)  Paired it with cooconuct rice and a vegetarian green curry dish ... mmm!  The sauce over the sliced pork is divine!

Very very good. We only used one tenderloin but kept the same measurements for sauce. Very tasty and complex. Sauce is good over rice too. Thanks!!

Very Good!!! I used this recipe on chicken breast and it turned out GREAT! I didn't have fresh ginger or cilantro so I added dried cilantro and ginger instead to taste. I served it with coconut rice which really rounded up the whole thing! I will make this again!

Absolutely incredible.  Only made personal taste changes, more red pepper flakes, simmered the sauce with vegetable stock.  Husband called it the Death Planet of dinners.  Meaning, if any other dinner tried to approach it, it would be instantly destroyed.  Marinade bursts with fresh flavor.  KILLER recipe.

I made the full amount of marinade for just one pork tenderloin.  I used half to marinate the pork all afternoon.  The other half I brought to a simmer, adding just half (1/4 cup) of the chicken stock (I used broth) and added a corn starch/chicken broth slurry – just thickening it enough to give it some nice body.  Instead of cooking the tenderloin in the oven, we grilled it.  I gave Hubs half of the thickened sauce to baste on the last five minutes of grilling and it came off the grill looking beautiful with a nice sheen.  I served this over saffron rice, which made for a gorgeous plate and served the remaining half of thickened sauce for drizzling/dipping.  Very good!  You can definitely taste the peanut butter in this, as well as the orange juice, which made for an interesting combination.

So good!  Really good flavors all around.  I used one tenderloin but kept the sauce the same and am glad I did, because it is so yummy!  Hubby grilled the meat and I thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch and served with rice.  Wonderful, thanks for sharing!

Definitely marinate for 24 hours.  The flavor is very  light (without the sauce) at 24 hours.  For us, the sauce made the meal.  Served wtih Thai style noodles with mushrooms and green onions.  Next time we'll BBQ instead of baking and that should raise to a 5 star meal.

wow! I'm not a fan of pork so i made this using skinless chicken breasts other than that i made no changes.  I'm a huge fan of thai food and i'm not sure that this was very authentic, but when it's this delicious  who cares!

Very tender meat; very flavorful sauce.  I expected the sauce to be hot, but it wasn't.

The name of this recipe is horrible, but the flavor is great and we loved the tenderloin. I didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again...served with brown jasmine rice and green beans sautéed in a teriyaki sauce.

This was the best and most tender pork I have ever eaten.  Definitely marinate overnight - I believe that's why it was so tender.  And the gravy is awesome!  Our dinner guests raved over this recipe.  Can't wait to cook it again!

I found this last night, and let it marinade for about 18 hours. SO GOOD! We seared off the tenderloin and then threw it in the oven with the chicken stock.. nice and juicy. Served with coconut ride and asian slaw. Perfect!

We absolutely love this recipe.   I marinade overnight in all the marinade liquid, and boil it all down with the chicken stock before serving.

Doubled sauce - a must. Husband kept nodding as he ate. Sign that this recipe was a keeper. Good way to mix up my boring chicken/pork repertoire. I felt sauce was little too salty. Next time will ease up on soy sauce or chicken stock.

I marinated it overnight and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes - delic. I also boiled the marinade and served it over the pork. It was a little gloppy (becuz of the PB) but it tasted good.

My boyfriend actually said, "Wow!" to this dish. The only change I made was the omission of the cilantro - broke my heart because I LOVE cilantro, but I forgot to pick it up at the store. Only change I'd make next time is to cut the red pepper flakes in half - the sauce had quite a bite to it.

Made this recipe as written with one exception; I couldn't get fresh ginger root so I used powdered.  The tenderloins were tender, the flavor was incredible and what an impressive meal!  I've since made it again but this time using chicken breast tenders and served over Udon noodles.  Another success!  If I could rate this twice and give it 5 *'s each time, I would  :)   Thank you for sharing!

This was great, even my choosy young nephews had seconds! Pork tenderloin was nowhere to be found in our market, but a pork roast cut in half worked fine. I increased the ginger for personal preference. Thank you!

This one has become a family favorite. I recently served it to friends for dinner and they raved about it! It is easy and elegant. Be sure to double the sauce--it makes the dish!

I haven't try this! But! I give it a five stars because I put this in the oven before go to work. Told my husband to serve it over rice with sauce for the kids (3 of 2 years old). I cam home and there was nothing left! I never think 3 kids all only 2 years and one adult could eat 2lbs of pork in one meal. It gotta be great recipe. Now I need to make it again so I can try some :)

Pork tenderloin with a lot of flavor, despite the name of “Quivering” tenderloins.  I let the meat marinate overnight and chose to grill it rather than bake it.  My family enjoyed this dinner the first time, but really enjoyed the leftovers cold the next day for lunch.  The meat was very tender and had delicious flavor.  I added a little Wondra® to thicken the sauce a little bit.  I served this with ‘Cauliflower Casserole’ from AR and a simple green salad.   I’m sure I will be making this one again.

fabulous.  We doubled the marinade.  I am concerned about the food safety issue of reusing the marinade & cooking it into a sauce.

Very good recipe, the only thing that I did different from the actual recipe was that I grilled it.  Sauce is wonderful, if making for family with kids, maybe scale back on the pepper flakes, but I thought it was just the right amount of spice.

I doubled the sauce and marinated the tenderloin overnight. Made some jasmine rice and a side of broccoli and cashews. I then cut up the tenderlion and mixed everything together. It was wonderful!! The sauce was amazing and I will use the leftover to put on some chicken.

Excellent flavour! Very easy to prep. I actually sliced my pork into thin strips, and stir fried it with onion. I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to the marinade, and mixed into the pork when cooked. Tastes like saytay!

Very good, perfectly spicy and I could still taste everything.  Think the peanut butter was just right, any more would have been too much and any less would have disappeared.  I used only 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and added diced jalapeno as I needed to use it up.  Will be also trying this on chicken.  We don't always have fresh cilantro available. I wait until I can get it and then go crazy with all my recipes that simply wouldn't be the same without it.  Thank you adrienne duval, super delish!!!!

I made this and it was absolutely delicious.  The pork was so tender and tasty.  Also very easy to make.  I did ease up on the spice because I can't eat much spice.  I also did not have fresh cilantro so substituted parsley for it.  I would definitely make this again.

This was SO good!  I like things spicy so I added an extra teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  The weather was beautiful so I cooked the meat on the grill, and did as others recommended and added a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  YUM!  I served the meat and sauce over brown rice.  

I would consider making the sauce to stir into brown rice and serve as a side dish.  

Great recipe!

Make sure to double up on all marinade ingredients - that way you will not get caught short on the great tasting sauce that it turns into.

This was a huge hit with my husband!   I made exactly as is, except, I made an extra batch of marinade to use as the sauce instead of using the sauce the pork had marinated in. I also marinated about 8 hours.   I served with pineapple fried rice and steamed vegetables.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW - is this good!!!  I added a little sesame oil but other than stayed true and it was awesome!  Sweet, Spicy, Yummy!!  I marinated for about 6 hours and then drained the marinade into a saucepan.  Cooked covered at 350 for 20 minutes then uncovered, poured the pan juices into the saucepan and raised the temp to 450 for another 10 minutes.  The meat was so tender and juicy!!
I only had one tenderloin but used all the marinade ingredients.  If I had two tenderloins I would double the marinade to make sure I had enough sauce.

OMG I'm so glad I made this! Very authentic- tastes like some meals I had in Malaysia.  Love it!! Used the sauce to go on stir fry veggies with black rice!

This "Thai Quivering Tenderloins" recipe was quite good and reminded me of the many peanut satays I've had, and the level of spiciness was perfect. I made the recipe with pork chops, and placed them in the oven on my broiler pan (not on a baking sheet) because I wanted them to brown up well. I used the juice that ran into the bottom of my broiler pan (instead of chicken stock) to make the sauce. The only thing that I would do differently another time is to add the cilantro to the sauce at the end of cooking (instead of adding it to the marinade) to keep it fresh. Thank you adrienne duval for sharing your recipe.

Delicious and easy. I only used a 1/4 tsp of chili peppers and still found it had a good kick. 1 tsp would have melted my wimpy lips right off!

This is delicious, although I didn't use the sauce. It didn't need it and it was so moist and juicy!

As other reviewers suggested I marinated the pork for 24 hours. The meat was incredibly tender and delicious. Not a strong flavour from the marinade alone but quite pleasant. We did not care for the sauce. Will most certainly make this again. Thank you.

I was short on time to marinate, so I cut the tenderloin into thick chops and marinated for 2 to 3 hours before grilling.  I was short 1 T. of soy sauce and cilantro however it was still very good.  Bring sauce to a low boil to thicken.  We had very little of the sauce leftover.  Looking forward to trying it with chicken breasts too. Thanks!

I marinated about 8 hrs.  I did not have cilantro.  Very nice!  Quite spicy.  I had a very low sodium soya sauce so it was not salty at all.  If I had used regular I would have likely cut it in half.  I used just one tenderloin, cooked on bbq for about 30 minutes.  I boiled up the marinate to reduce it and served over sliced meat.  Delish

I also used this for chicken tenders and it was pretty good. Tenders take about 20 minutes in the oven.

I used this as a marinade for chicken wings to go along with a Thai Chicken pizza I made. First of all, once they were BBQ'd, I honestly couldn't distinguish any of the ingredients that made up the marinade. However, they were probably the best chicken wings I've ever had! So full of flavor! We liked them so much that I made another batch to marinade over night. Will definitely be using this on many different meats.

I'm sorry but with all those flavors I thought that it would have a much better taste.  The peanut butter overwhelms the entire dish.

I made this with chicken thighs. Did not marinate, just threw everything into a pan and baked for an hour. Thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Great recipe!

OMG ... I followed the recipe as written, only substituting Splenda brown sugar, and I've never had better tenderloin! I could drink the marinade with a straw. I would serve this to company without reservation, but it's easy enough that it also makes a great mid-week treat.

The pork is awesome, the sauce was tasty. bites that had less cilantro were more on the 4 star side, may just be the family's taste buds. I will try again using basil instead of cilantro! also used the chili-garlic sauce instead of red pepper flakes.

The only different thing I did was to add chili paste to the recipe. It was great. We will have this again.

Quite nice. Followed exactly the recipe and served with Rice and Curried Garbanzo (from this site) and a green salad. Not amazing but quite good.
