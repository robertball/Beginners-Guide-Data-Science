Really was surprised at texture and flavor, really pleasing. I didn't have ham available but used Canadian bacon instead. I can see some other ways to try it, this will be my replacement for mac and cheese in order to save carbs'

In the spirit of an honest review, I cannot get behind tofu no matter how hard I try, so I omitted it and used 4 cups of cauliflower instead.  With that said, I prepared the recipe as stated.  I thought the flavors went well together and I will serve this again.

I will try this again as the texture was pretty good and the flavors melded nicely, just a bit too much garlic powder for my liking. Maybe try cutting that in 1/2. Otherwise, a good, low carb option.
