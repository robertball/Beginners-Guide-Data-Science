Great smoothie...I am a breakfast smoothie junkie!  Just changed a tad for a healthier route.  I used half a banana, the given amount of strawberry and kiwi and reg vanilla yogurt not frozen.  I left out the juice to save calories.  I added 9 almonds for some healthy fat(ya need to eat good fat in order to lose it).  With that it was a perfectly balanced smoothie that is a good jump start to your day.  I added all ingredients into blender with a dab of water to make it blend nice...then I added a cup of ice to give it a great smoothie texture. 5 stars for sure.  Oh and for the real health conscience..instead of yogurt go for the scoop of protein powder that comes in fabulous flavors.

I used a very large frozen banana, nonfat plain greek yogurt and one teaspoon of vanilla extract. My son and I split this smoothie. VERY good. We loved it's creamy texture and my banana was quite ripe which made it the right amount of sweetness. I'll make this again.

Very good smoothie....but why is it called Kiwi Strawberry when the most prodominant flavor is the banana.  Don't get me wrong it is tasty.  Just wanted to taste the strawberries and kiwi just a bit more than the banana.  Thanks for the post.

Very refreshing for breakfast and I was able to use up the last lonely little kiwi I had left...  I didn't have frozen yogurt so I improvised and used my regular vanilla yogurt and added some ice.  The combination of flavors is very good.

This smoothie was incredible!  I love the combination of kiwi and strawberry, and the banana helps make it thick so the straw stands up on its own.  I think the brilliant person who created this smoothie meant to use FROZEN yogurt, so I went ahead and used frozen vanilla yogurt.

I changed the recipe a little by using frozen bananas to give the smoothie a nice texture. I also used half the yogurt then it said too. The smoothie turned out great.

Past experience has shown me I don't care for orange juice with strawberries, and pineapple and orange juice blend is something I never have on hand anyway, so I just substituted milk and was much happier with that choice.  I also used just refrigerated yogurt rather than frozen - strawberry.  I used all frozen fruit, including the kiwi.  After blending it I found it needed some sweetening, so I used Splenda to taste.  Hubs loved it.

We tried this recipe similar to this and we were all very happy with it. I absolutely loved the way the kiwi seeds crunched in the drink.  We are looking forward to using it again.  The recipe we used also had 1 c. of ice with it.  Likely a bit more strawberry (1 c.). We also just used regular vanilla yogurt since our fruit was frozen.  Enjoy!

I didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used vanilla ice cream. It was pretty good, but I'd say the given recipe only makes ONE smoothie, not 2 as is stated.

Delicious.  I used more frozen yogurt and less juice. Mine was milk shake like, but this is what I wanted due to making this my dinner.  Very filling.

Awesome smoothie! We used frozen strawberries and added about 10 blueberries to the mix. Also we only had vanilla yogurt, not frozen and didn't have any pineapple orange juice so we used 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup fresh cut pineapple. It turned out GREAT! Next time we'll follow the recipe ;-)

I thought this was very tasty, but I did tweak it a bit - for 1 serving, I used half a frozen banana, 5 strawberries and one very ripe kiwi.  I used maybe 1/3 cup plain non-fat Greek-style yogurt, about a teaspoon of honey and 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice.  It was not overly sweet, but I wouldn't call it tart, either.  It was very refreshing!

I really didn't like this too much the first time around, but smoothies were fairly new to me at the time and I learned a little and made it again to give it a chance.  So I used a riper banana, all frozen strawberries since the so-called 'fresh' around here isn't so good, and a riper kiwi.  Definitely better but still just wasn't my favorite.  I love most fruit juices and have liked other smoothies with strawberries.  I'm guessing it was either the kiwi I wasn't fond of (and I totally cut out the core so no seeds), or perhaps just too much banana for something that's supposed to be "kiwi strawberry," as someone else suggested.

This was pretty tart, and my kiwi was very ripe. I guess I was expecting it to be smoother and sweeter due to the frozen yogurt. I suppose it's good if you consider tart refreshing, but it was not for me.

This is our current favorite smoothie! And, the beauty of smoothies is that you can substitute ingredients or quantities so easily.  The combination of kiwi, strawberry and pineapple was so refreshing and did not need any added sugar. Next time I will make a double batch!

I did not like how strong the banana was in this concoction. I doubled the rest of the ingredients in attempts to tone it down and it was still overpowering. I will try it again with no banana. Also, I felt it tasted much better after adding crushed ice and blending that in.

Good recipe but it is a bit of a misnomer to call it "kiwi strawberry"...I found that it tasted mostly of banana.  Excellent consistency and very tasty, just expected a bit more kiwi and strawberry flavor.  I even used strawberry frozen yogurt as I didn't have vanilla on hand. I did love how easy this was to put together with all the fruits I usually have in the spring and summer, so I'll definitely still make it, maybe even play around with it to get the flavors I originally was looking forward to.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy Smoothie, I changed it a wee bit, but still stuck with the general recipe. I used half a banana because I wanted it to be a background note, and not the over-riding flavor, and I used plain yogurt (not frozen), and a splash of vanilla. Very sweet and tropical! I also added a few ice cubes since I didn't use frozen yogurt

This recipe was delicious! Every morning I eat a fresh fruit smoothie and this one is by far my favorite. I upped the kiwi to two and I didn't use strawberries and it was still yummy! However I didn't like the seeds from the kiwi so I would recommend slicing the seeds out.

Tastes great. I substituted strawberry banana yogurt for the vanilla and I used regular orange juice. I also added crushed ice. Delicious!

This is a very yummy smoothie for breakfast! I changed just a few things though. I cut it in half for one serving. I used low fat vanilla yogurt, real pineapple slices, and added a splash of low fat almond milk. I also add protein powder to all of my smoothies too. My son didn't care much for this smoothie as he is my taste tester for everything but I thought it was very refreshing!

Very good recipe. I mde some changes though. I used a large banana, 8 strawberries I froze from my garden and I also used about 1 tbsp. wheat germ. I used refrigerated vanilla yogurt. I didn't have any pineapple-orange juice, but I did have a tropical fruit blend that had pineapple, orange, guava, mango & carrot juices. I didn't use the full 3/4 cup, but used only what I needed for the proper consistency, which amounted to slightly more than 1/3 cup. I made it for my grandson, who had never tried smoothies before, & he enjoyed it, but said his throat was "burning" (I'm guessing it was from the kiwi flavor & seeds scratching his throat). My banana was very large, but wasn't too overpowering because of the additional strawberries I added.
Overall, this was a tasty, smooth & refreshing drink that I will surely make again.  
Thank you for sharing!

I tried this and needed to make some minor variations based on what I had in the house at the time. I used fresh fruit like it called for but needed to use plain low-fat yogurt rather than frozen, but used another reviewers suggestion to then add ice. I think it turned out good. I haven't ever been much of a smoothie fan just because of the consistency, but I made it for other people and they seemed to really like it. I will try it again with the recommended ingredients.

OK- instead of kiwi, I added a few pieces of frozen mango.  Also, in a Dixie cup, I froze (overnight) a 1/2 cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt.  Combined all of this w/ 6 frozen strawberries, 3/4 cup of pineapple juice and a banana and it was FANTASTIC!  This will be my permanent new smoothie recipe.  It was SO easy to make and very healthy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I tried making smoothies years ago and they all tasted not good. But this one was a hit. My kids even liked it. I used non frozen strawberry banana yogurt and then did one without ice and then with ice. With ice was better. Couldn’t find frozen yogurt so added ice. I doubled the recipe and it made four servings. I just used regular orange juice

This smoothie was very refreshing! Instead of using orange and pineapple juice, I used half of a large fresh orange, and a quarter cup of frozen pineapple and it tasted great. I did add some extra almond milk to thin it out a little.

instead of using ginger slice,  i always have pitcher of pre-made fresh ginger tea with lemon in the fridge and use it in the place of water, orange juice..etc. but if you want little sweeter.. you can use honey or stevia .

It was very nice, though the OJ gave it a bit too much of a bite. Would definitely make it again, but need to add something to counter OJ or use less of it.

I made some huge changes to it. I added 1 banana, 6 strawberries, Strawberry yogurt, 3 pinches of sugar, 3 spoons of peanut butter, Chocolate Syrup, Tiger tea, and some banana powder. It was the best smoothie I ever made! I will make it again for sure. Its a great color and some interesting bubbles with shine. I will make this my own recipe!

I am going to make this a regular! It is delicious and refreshing! I used all pineapple juice instead of blending with orange (I was out of OJ at the time) and it was great!! I can't sit to try it next time with some OJ too :)

Delicious! I made it a little different than the recipe called for but with nearly the same ingredients: 

half a frozen banana, 3 frozen strawberries, 1 kiwi, half cup of orange juice, and one serving of greek vanilla yogurt.  

I recommend trying this way, too!

Love this smoothie! Tastes just like my favorite from Smoothie King. I added 12 almonds to this recipe to make it more filling. Using the nutribullet, it took about 5 seconds to achieve the perfect consistency.

I loved this recipe! It had a sweet flavor but it wasn't too sweet. I didn't use any orange juice, instead I used all pineapple, and instead of frozen yogurt, I used frozen strawberries. I'm definitely making this again and I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a sweet, fruity, and perfect smoothie!

I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used 100% cherry tart juice instead of the pineapple/orange juice blend. I also added a dash of vanilla extract. Best smoothie I ever had!

It is sooo yummy!  We used strawberry yogurt and topped it with whipped cream and a cherry!  Big hit!
