Because of the richness of this dish I added a little Garam Masal and Cumin for the smokiness without wanting it to taste too "Chili" like, and it worked! Everyone loved this i will make this again! I also added frsh diced tomatos which gave it a fantastic taste.

I worked with what I had on hand (eggpl, red onion, lots of garlic, red/green pepp, frozen brocc, can of stewed tom., garb. beans,& tempeh). It was really good. I did the little bit of cumin and I overdid it a bit w/ the rosemary/thyme. I think the natural flavor of the veggies and s/p would have been fine. No matter what you have on hand the chick peas and tempeh were a great idea and create a good stew texture. Nice way to use tempeh.

Defiantly recommend adding more spices. I made it as is and it was pretty bland. The tempeh added a sort of strange texture to the dish that I liked but the family didn't. If I did it again, I would add more of the spices that the other reviewers added.

Very good! I used shredded mozzarella in lieu of pepper jack and it was great! I'm not much of a cheese person but I thought the cheese made it. I loved all the veggies and tempeh and let everything simmer much longer than the recipe called for and I think this helped with the flavor. Additionally I added cumin, lemon pepper, fresh basil. The hubby liked so I will definitely make again!

This was great, but we had to add lots of seasonings. Added extra fresh rosemary & garlic, plus fresh parsley & chives.

definitely add more spices such as cumin, hot pepper, etc. i cooked it a little longer so the carrots were soft. used kidney instead of garbanzo. didn't use green beans. but for a vegan recipe, not bad as a base to personalize to your liking.

It is a great high fiber, low glycemic casserole. I replaced the vegetable broth with red wine, increased the rosemary and garlic as suggested by others. It was delicious!
