This was VERY good! Served it along with a hamburger stroganoff and we all loved it. I made it exactly as written - and there will be no need to experiment further. I'll make this again as is. And it is so EASY, too!

12.30.17  For whatever reason, my wild rice never really did get tender even after cooking for 55 minutes, so my pilaf did have a little crunch.  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of cutting the amount of green onions in half.  Two cups each of chopped onions and chopped green onions seemed excessive for the amount of orzo and rice, and I would do the same thing in the future.  The rice and orzo were good partners, very mellow in flavor, and did not overpower an expensive main course.  This would be a nice side dish for chicken, pork, fish, whatever.  We enjoyed it with beautiful wild-caught sea scallops. Tricia McTamaney, thanks for sharing your recipe.
