People would never believe that pop would do the trick and that it results in the lightest and flakiest crust EVER!!! Think about it....bubbles, air, and just plain YUMMY!! I have used this recipe for 20 years and have always received rave reviews and recipe requests for the crust.  Thanks a bunch for sharing!!! You really won't be disappointed!!

I have tryed this recipe for the first time.I made tortieres with it for christmas.They turned out wonderful! It is a very flakey tender pie crust with just a hint of sweetness.This recipe is almost fool proof, you can not go wrong with this one. I didn't even have to brush it with an egg or milk for it to turn golden brown. It is realy wonderful. This pie dough is very easy to work with also. It rolls out very nice, doesn't crack or break apart easily like the recipe I usualy use. Minde you, the recipe that I usualy use I a very good one, but this one is easier to work with and turned out great. Can't wait to try out an apple pie with this recipe. I know it will be great. I wonder if you can freeze this pie dough made with 7up?

This recipe is wonderfully flaky & delicious.  You won't use the full can of soda - I usually use less than half, so add it slowly!

Good flavor and probabaly great with fruit pie, puddings, or custards.  But too bready for my pot pie.  It soaked up all the broth and made the dish quite dry.

I was looking for a pie crust recipe to use for a coconut cream pie that I made for my dad for his birth day when I found this recipe. I am not a fan of pie crust I would prefere the pie without the crust to be honest. But this was the best pie crust I have ever eaten. And trust me I have tried many pie crust through my years of working in restaurant kitchens. A+++

I loved the idea of the soda but only had a pumpkin spiced beer. I made 1/4 recipe in the food processor and used very cold butter instead of veg. lard.  I threw in a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar for the heck of it and pulsed the dry ingredients with the butter. Then I poured in 3 oz. of the beer. I dumped it out on a floured board and lightly shaped it in a ball to be placed in the fridge wrapped in Saran. The consistency was perfect. I think the secret might be in very cold butter, a smaller recipe, and very little handling. Don't know about the taste yet but will let you know.

This was the first pastry recipe I tried, and I do not need to look further. I used the pastry to make onion and cheese turnovers for the weekly wine tasting and the consensus was delicious! This crust was very easy to handle, rolled out smoothly and even rerolled the bits with no problem. A little labor intensive working the lard in, but worth the effort. I used a generously floured pastry cloth and covered my rolling pin with a cloth cover. Wonderful recipe, no more refridgerated dough for me!

I made this pie crust for a pie I entered into the state fair.  Although I won 2nd place, I don't think I liked this recipe.  The crust was tasty, however, I found that it was hard to mess with & seemed to be very sticky & very difficult to roll out.  Would now make it again, sorry.

This was tender and flakey for the pumpin and caramel apple pie for thanksgiving.  It didn't hold up as well as some crusts on the third day but it was still very tasty.  I am going to use it for the turkey pot pie.

This is a great looking and easy to make crust but the soda doesn't overpower the taste of lard, as I had hoped.  Perhaps butter instead of lard would give it a better flavor?  Not a bad taste and the lard flavor is so slight, that most couldn't tell.

I donâ€™t use the salt. Add Another half a cup of flour when rolling out. Always stays flaky it does not matter how many times you reroll the pastry.
