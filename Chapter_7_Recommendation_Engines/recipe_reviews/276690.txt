Flavours were wonderful and beef very tender. I braised it a bit longer as I like it very tender, and I reduced the liquid at the end as I wasn't putting it over anything. Be careful with the amount of red chile peppers you add.

Another awesome recipe from Chef John! We used large slices of portobello mushrooms then plated the dish with steamed white rice and broccoli.

We love King mushrooms so were very excited to try this, and were not disappointed!  I used salt sparingly as I felt the vegetable broth we substituted and miso paste contained a lot.  We didn’t have sake so used chardonnay to deglaze. Our chuck roast took close to three hours to tenderize, so all together it took about 3.5 hours to complete.  We left off the peppers and green onions at the end and did not miss them.  Served with mashed potatoes.  The sauce has a fabulous rich flavor and we will definitely make this again.

I wanted to try something new during the weeknight so I found this and decided to give it a try. I did not have yellow miso I instead used red since it gave it a deeper rich flavor, I also substituted the chicken stock with rehydrated shiitake mushroom water and it brought the dish together. A tip is to have your pan on high, bring your meat out thirty minutes before cooking so the splatter of the meat on the oil won't be so high, also 3-4 minutes per side and use a cast iron skillet. Excellent recipe! can't wait to make it again!

I've made this one a couple times now, and it's a consistent hit! I love how easy it is to get impressive smelling, tasting, and looking results.
While some of the harder-to-find ingredients may scare off prospective cooks, this recipe works fine with substitutions for things like the oil or mushrooms. In fact, and I hesitate to admit this because Chef John will never be my friend now, but I don't like maple syrup and used 'pancake' syrup. While the maply flavor probably adds something more, I don't find myself missing anything.
You can cut or omit the spicy ingredients to taste, and I would advise going easy on the salt until you get to the end and are seasoning to taste, as miso is quite salty on its own. Mashed potatoes are my favorite side to pair it with as they soak up all that incredible braising liquid! Some sauteed greens would probably go great too.

This is an excellent dish!!  We only changed the mushrooms to portobello because we couldn’t find the others and used red miso for a deeper richness.
