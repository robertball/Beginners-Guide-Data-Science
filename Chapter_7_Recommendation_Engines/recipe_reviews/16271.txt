I decided to stray from my "traditional" pecan pie this year for Thanksgiving and give this recipe a try.  BIG HIT!  I don't think I'll ever go back to the old recipe after having this pie.  It was wonderful.  Everyone who tried it agreed it was the best pecan pie we've ever tried.  I did have to increase the baking time to around 55 minutes.  The recipe called for dark corn syrup, but light works just as well.  Also, the directions call to add the "whipped" cream.  This was a little confusing as it should (I believe) just be the heavy cream (NOT whipped).  All-in-all, it was heavenly and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing it, "Peanut"!

I found this recipe and made it for my family for Thanksgiving dinner. It was an absolute hit and I have been assigned the "official" pecan pie maker for Thanksgiving get togethers!

This pie was very good but I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers and used half of the amount of brandy called for.  The only thing I didn't like was the pale color, probably from the addition of the cream.  To solve that, I put a pie shield around the edges and ran the pie under the broiler for a few minutes to carmelize.

This is a very rich, flavorful, great textured pie. It baked beautifully. Nice golden coloring. I baked for 50 minutes and used 1/4 cup of the brandy. I can see where if you want a light brandy taste, a 1/4 cup will do. If you want a kick use the full 1/2 cup. Absolutely the best Pecan Pie!

This is a GREAT recipe but the 1/2 cup of brandy is WAY too much. Everyone loved this pie but were laughing at me and saying they didn't want to 'eat this pie and drive.' Next time I'll cut the brandy in half and it should be PERFECT.

Overall a great recipe, but next time I would use only half the amount of brandy.  (For children, I would omit it.)  Goes perfectly with the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now. I t has been a huge hit. My inlaws love it so much I know I cant show up to a holiday dinner without it. Trust me when i say there won't be a crumb left & people who dont like traditional pecan pie will like this recipe too. Took the advice in other reviews to make sure you half the amount of brandy otherwise the brandy overwhelmes the flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  If you have smaller portions, the brandy is not overwhelming, but I might add less next time I make this recipe. Also very good cold!

This has become our regular pecan pie for the holidays with just one adjustment. I cut the brandy to 1/4 cup and it’s perfect. It’s just enough brandy to help cut the sweetness.

I have made this recipe for years.., except my recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of  brandy and I usually use just a little less than the 1/4 cup called for.  Everyone loves this pecan pie.
