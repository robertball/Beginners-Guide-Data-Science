Fabulous on fish tacos!  The jalapeño gives it a zesty flavor boost.  This seems really versatile and would compliment a lot of dishes.

Due to the amount of produce to be chopped, I found that using a cuisinart (if available) works much better than a blender... that, or this blender (brand new Oster) couldn’t manage it very well. Tried this as a sauce over lightly marinated chicken... definitely making this again!

I was not a big fan of this. I think it just wasn't for me. It wasn't bad, just not for me. The longer it sat the better it got tho.

Very good sauce. I added cream cheese and sour cream for added body and flavor. Was really good.

Hubby made it as is but with just one avocado so did 1/3 of the other amounts. We used it as a topping on quesadillas in place of sour cream. Loved the tang of the lime.

It was not what I was expecting. It was kind of bitter and tart. I added sour cream to it cut it a little bit.
