I had a five pound beef roast--I adjusted the serving counter to reflect that FOR THE ROAST ALONE. I added fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the flour before sprinkling it over the roast. I also used beef broth instead of water. I didn't want to lose all that great flavor in the pan from searing the roast so I set the roast aside and sauteed the onion and some fresh minced garlic in the skillet with a little butter until the onions started to turn translucent. I then added the broth, let it come to a boil, and scraped all that good flavor from the pan. I poured the liquid into the bottom of the roasting pan, set the roast on top, then poured the wine over everything and added the spices.  This was one of the best roasts we've ever had. Out of that whole roast, there's just enough for leftovers for one person tomorrow. My boys inhaled dinner. NOTE: My roast was done in two hours and that's medium done. If you keep it covered the whole time it's cooking (just cover it with a lid or with foil), you won't have a dry roast.

I finally decided it's time to jump in with a couple of comments on my recipe. First, I totally agree with everyone who suggested using beef broth instead of water. Second, Allrecipes made some changes to the recipe that I originally submitted. This recipe does not make 12 servings, it makes one serving per 1/2 pound of chuck roast. When I submitted it, I said it made 6 servings. I also said small onions, not pearl onions. I use small yellow onions when I make it. Also, if the carrots are large, I add them before the other vegetables and let them cook for 10 or 15 minutes before adding the rest. I also add whole fresh mushrooms if I have them, but I don't change the seasonings; my family likes them just like they are.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using beef broth in place of the water and added mushrooms.  However, I didn't follow the method.  I seared the roast, put it into the Crockpot, added the rest of the ingredients and cooked on low for 8 hours.  An easy Sunday meal!

Good, but I essentially used this recipe as a guide – an average three stars as written.  I modified the recipe in several regards, elevating my rating from three to four stars.  I added salt and pepper to the flour, seared the (rump) roast in olive oil, used beef broth rather than water, and topped the roast with sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme instead of the dried herbs.  I also made slits in several places on the roast and inserted slivers of fresh garlic.  I had other plans for vegetables (besides, I don’t like cooked carrots or pearl onions) so I skipped the potatoes, carrots and onions and chose instead to toss in a handful of dried porcini mushrooms which added a great deal of flavor.  The biggest change – I wasn’t sure when we’d eat supper tonight so I used the slow cooker rather than the oven.  Very flavorful and tender.  Searing the roast first and adding red wine makes all the difference.

Very very very good!  My only changes were to use beef broth instead of water and I doubled the broth/wine to about 2 cups.  Great balance of spices.  I also made some brown gravy to drizzle over the top of all the meat and veggies at the table.  Will definintely use this again and again.

This roast was one of the best roasts I have ever made. If you have a cast iron pot I suggest using that. It made it SOOOO tender and also cuts the cooking time down a bit. I used low-sodium beef stock in place of the water and ended up using 1 cup in all after adding an additional 1/2 cup when I added my vegies. I combined all my spices together first and added 1/2 to the flour before sprinkling on the roast. I also put the flour/spice mixture into a spice shaker to make applying to the roast easier and less messy. Worked out great and I only ended up using 1 tablespoon flour mixture in all - didn't need any more and the roast was well covered.  The liquid does cook down quite a bit, unless it was because of my cast iron pot, so I suggest keeping an eye on that, especially if you want to make  a gravy. You may want to add more if that is the case. I had just enough liquid to use as an au jus - no gravy needed. Delicious. Thanks for an awesome recipe! I will definitely be making this again!

This was a great / easy recipe.  
I substituted beef broth for the water, used Pinot Noir for the wine.  I did not brown it.  I put the meat, wine, broth, spices and the onions, carrots and potatoes all in at the same time and cooked it for 2 hrs & 30 mins at 350.  I think cooking it for 3 to 4 hours would be too long.  The meat was tender and the wine and spices gave it a great flavor.  I will make this again.

We liked the subtle red wine flavor of this pot roast and would definitely make it again. I opted for the slow cooker on this one, so I bypassed the flour/browning step and just threw everything in the crockpot for 8 hours on Low. It came out perfectly tender with plenty of juice to make gravy. Unlike my usual self, I didn't add anything to the ingredients. It was very flavorful! Thanks for a great pot roast recipe!

This is an excellent pot roast.  The meat is moist and tender, and while the herbs enhance the flavor, they don't dominate it.  As others have, I used beef broth instead of water.  My carrots needed more time than the potatoes, and in the future I would add them earlier.  Red potatoes were a nice change to my usual pot roast too.  This is a keeper.

Since we are not fans of chuck meat, I used a top round roast, I don't have a dutch oven so I did the whole thing on the stove which is most likely why I used at least 5 times the amount of liquid called for. I took other reviewers suggestion and used beef broth in place of the water. Was very tender and flavorful.

Excellent roast! Used beef broth and regular onions. Also skipped the oil and browning; just sprinkled the flour atop the roast, and I used a crock pot, since it was 95 degrees outside & I didn't want to use the oven! I added the carrots after an hour and the red potatoes after two hours. Roast cooked about 4 hours total. I  may increase the amount of seasonings next time. THANK YOU!

This is really good.  I love the flavors of the red wine and the herbs.  I didn't think that there was enough liquid, so I used 1 cup beef broth (instead of water) and 1 cup red wine.  I haven't quite got the hang of pot roasts yet, or maybe it was my cut of meat, but my roast didn't turn out very tender (but I'm not faulting the recipe for that because I'm guessing it was my fault).  Next time I make this I will do it on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours.

The most tender roast I've ever had. No need to put knives on the table at all! I would recommend adding seasoning to the flour before browning the meat. Make sure you brown it well too. Use the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up all the brown flavorful pieces. The herbs were perfect. I didn't all the potatoes to the pot but made mashed instead. But the cooking time was maybe a touch too long - you can add the veg after 2 1/2 hours and then only cook another 40 minutes. Just keep checking on it. Also...definitely double the liquid to ensure it doesn't dry out. The onions caramelized on top giving it a beautiful sweetness.

I made this recipe, changed a couple of things and adapted it to the crock pot.  I first sprinkled the roast with garlic and herb seasoning, then browned it (in canola oil) on all sides in a heavy pan.  I then put the roast in a crock pot set to low.  I heated the wine and water (mixed) in the pan I used to brown the meat and poured it over the roast, added the seasonings (I didn't have all of them so used Herbes de Provence and dehydrated onion flakes).  I didn't use salt because of health reasons and didn't put in the veggies..  I cooked it between 7 and 8 hours.  I cooked potatoes separately (so I could mash them) and some carrots and served everything with a small salad.  The meat turned out very moist tender and flavorful and I thickened the liquid in the crock to make gravy.   We never missed the salt.  Great meal without all the salt that so many recipes have.

If you skip the veggies, sub all wine for water, cook til most of the liquids have soaked into the meat, scoop it onto a nice bun, you've just recreated the Aaron Sanchez sliders that they serve at the Crossroads bar @ Downtown Disney. Applause, applause to infinity and beyond! :o)

The meat was melt in your mouth tender & the gravey from the juices came out great! I did use on the bone meat, and I used vegtable broth to add some flavor, and less than called for red wine. It was yummy!

I used beef broth instead of water.  I would prefer this with more red wine and less broth.  ...next time.  I also added cremini mushrooms at the end.  Sauteed them in a little butter first.  Served over mashed red potatoes with the skin and broccoli.  Cooked on low about 8 hrs in a crock pot. Use one!  You one be disappointed!

4.5 stars! Easy & very tastey! I may add more red wine next time (used 3/4c & 3/4 c beef broth in croc pot) so I can get more wine flavor, but that is totally a personal preference. This is a keeper & as forgiving as the original chef promised! :)

I've made this a couple of times now.The first time I used the flour and browned according to instructions.The next time I just wiped the inside of my 7 qt. dutch oven w/olive oil and browned as is...this was easier and I couldn't tell that the flour made a difference. I also used Isimon99's suggestion and used a full cup of red wine and a full cup of beef broth. I added water only when the veggies went in. I also used an entire onion cut into thick slices at the beginning of cooking. I think whatever variety of onions, potatoes and carrots used would work...as karenCooks wrote, this is a very forgiving recipe. I've also used Penzey's beef roast seasoning instead of the individual spices called for...equally good. My family really enjoys this recipe. Thanks, KarenCooks!

Very good roast.  Tender.  I did not have the veggies and so I didn't put the onions on top (can only imagine that would have made it even better).  I read the reviews and saw many people used broth.  I only used water/wine and the amount called for.  The roast was so good that I will make it this way again for sure.  Thanks for the posting.

This was great. Did not have any red wine so just used beef broth. It is the spices which really made this great!!! Also cooked it in the slow cooker for 8hrs on low after browning it. Easy!!!

Very good pot roast  recipe but I don't always have red wine I can use so I've found strong coffee is a good substitute. It's old Navy cook's trick! Makes the best beef gravy ever and nice for those who might not want to use wine in their food.

This is a great recipe..I made it tonight the only changes I made was extra wine and water because I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 35 minutes..I cooked my potatoes,carrots and onions separate in the pressure cooker for 10 minutes.I also added a few of my favorite spices... It was all super yummy..

OMG..."This Ain't Your Momma's Pot Roast" is what it should be named!  I was looking for something other than my usual way of making Pot Roast (celery, carrots, onion, potato) and this hit the spot. Made it as directed (but with beef broth instead of water) and wow, the flavors of the red wine and seasonings just popped.  Definitely company-worthy and something I'd pay a lot for in a restaurant. Thanks!

We thought this was good, but lacked a good  beef flavoring.  Next time, in place of the water, I'll use beef broth as others suggested.  Otherwise, the spices were very good!

Made EXACTLY as stated. I made mistake of  leaving home while roast was in oven, to come home to burning smell at the 3 hour mark. :-( The bottom of my dutch oven was blackened along with the bottom of the roast. HOWEVER - I salvaged it and cut off all burnt pieces, SCRUBBED my pot and went on with the rest of the recipe. This was DELICIOUS!! I think I'm going to have to make it again - like next week!! I will definitely double the liquid and check on my roast often next time. I threw out my old roast recipe! :-)

Very good, except I had to keep adding liquid.  I cooked mine in a cast iron pot which may have been too hot and cooked out the liquid.  I didn't think it was all that flavorfull at first, but it was very good the next day. I agree about using broth instead of water and thicken the gravy.

I prepared this roast exactly as directed accept I used 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup sangria.  I cooked it for only 2 1/2 hours, refrigerated overnight.  Then I used the cut up the roast in the Mom's Secret Recipe Beef Stew recipe found on here.  The roast was extremely tender and tasty.  Definitely easy and a keeper for again and again.

I used a few sticks of celery cherry tomatoes button mushrooms fresh rosemary and a bayleaf any old hunks of beef will do along with baby potatoes and a few pieces lightly crushed garlic but the key is good robust red wine Merlo works well for me. Outstanding

Great dish!  This was my first pot roast and it turned out well.  I had a 4.25 lb 7-bone roast that wouldn't fit in my cast iron dutch oven so I used a very large but heavy roaster.  I had to double the wine and broth but it left lots of room for extra veggies which included whole mushrooms.  The wine was an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon.  I did cook it at a lower temp, 300 deg, for 3.5 hours, added the veggies and cooked for nearly an hour at 350 deg.

WONDERFUL I made this for Sunday dinner. I followed the recipe except like suggested by others I used beef broth instead of water and because I wanted to cook it while we were at church I lowered the temperature to 325.When I got home I added more beef broth (and a little more wine) when I added the vegetables.It was soooo tender and yummy. I will make this again.

Truly, this recipe is awesome! I made this last night, and my family loved it. The smell while it was in the oven was heavenly. I doubled the wine and water, since we are a gravy-loving family, and I added a bay leaf, and a vegetable bouillon cube.  This is in my recipe box to stay!

I made this and actually browned and prepped the meat and veggies the day before.  I used 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of wine.  The oven temperature seemed high to me, so I lowered it to 275 and my roast was perfectly fall apart tender in 3 hours.  Since I had the time, I removed the roast and tented it with foil and cooked my veggies in the same pan, stove top.  I simmered the carrots for 15 minutes before adding the potatoes and then simmered another 20 minutes.   I reheated everything just before serving.  A great roast if you adjust the time and temp.  I'd also add more veggies next time.  7/3/15 UPDATE:  I made this as before, but put the veggies in about half way through the cook time.  Very good again!

Really good and will make again.  I will add this to the chuck roast options.  I only rated this a 4 because, while it was as good as our other chuck roasts, it wasn't that elusive ultimate chuck roast recipe I've been searching for.  I did substitute beef broth for water.  In an abundance of caution I added an additional 1/4th cup of wine and an additional 1/4th cup of beef broth and all was well.  I didn't halve the pearl onions as we like them whole.  In fairness, maybe if I'd followed the recipe exactly it might have been even better.   Nonetheless, the flavor was really good.  I also used my favorite nonstick covered brasier as cleaning the cast iron dutch oven is such a pain.  Hint:  take the dish out of the oven about 30 minutes before done and take the lid off for a minute or two before covering and putting back in the oven to really smell up the kitchen good; that is if you don't mind the menfolk hovering around the kitchen.

Wonderful flavor, but very dry. I had to add quite a bit more liquid to roast it in the oven. Next time, I will use the slow-cooker, my preferred method, anyway.

The meat did not have as much flavor as I am use to.  I'll just have to find out what my grandmother seasons the meat with and add that next time.  I also was not a fan of the overpowering red wine taste--could this be because I used cheap red wine?  I'll try this again next time with a little less red wine and bolder seasoning.

Good, not great in the slow cooker.  If I try it again I'll roast in the oven to see if I can achieve the "melt in your mouthness" that others did.

All the flavors tasted really well.  If you bake this in the oven you really need to babysit it & check on it often.  I had to add more liquid several times because it had all been absorbed.  The meat was sooooo tender & the taste was wonderful.

SOOOO BUMMED!  I put this in the oven after following the instructions.  Left the house but made sure I was back before the 3 hour mark walked in the house...OH UH, smells like something is burning.  Yup all the liquid is gone and the veggies haven't even gotten into the pot. I think you really need to watch this one.  I did it in my Le Creuset and my new oven temp is dead on.  Good thing the  Le Creuset pots clean like a charm even if they are a burnt mess. I was so looking forward to this meal.  I just hope the meat doesn't taste burnt, but I don't have high hopes for it.

Everyone loved this! I didn't have red wine so I used white merlot (blush) & a few dashes of red wine vinegar, also added 2 cloves of garlic! Yum, yum!

This roast will absolutely melt in your mouth! I also used beef broth in place of the water and doubled the broth, wine and seasonings.  I don't have a dutch oven so after I seared the roast I put the broth/wine/seasoning mixture in the pan on med-high heat, stirring to include all of the nice browned bits.  Then put everything in the crock pot on low and it smelled wonderful.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is always a huge hit in my house. All of my modifications for this came from the top three reviewers advice, but even if you cook as directed you can't go wrong. I'm so glad to have a pot roast recipe that works and I will definitely be making this for years to come.

WOW.  Made this for my wife and it's just as her mother made it.  What a compliment.  I watched the timing a bit as mine was ready in 3 hours 30.  From the oven to the table aroma wafted throughout the house the taste. was delicious.  

I'll definitely be making this again and again.

04-25-16 ~ The name is truly correct - this pot roast is AWESOME! Lucky Noodles, another AR cook suggested this roast, so I went with it. I'm glad I did. Everything had such wonderful flavoring. It really did fall apart with a fork. I used a chuck roast in this recipe. A nice complete meal, that I would make again.

This turned out wonderfully!  We followed the recipe but used beef broth instead of water and used an entire container of beef broth..... We also added garlic and celery.  The roast was perfect!

I got a bigger roast so I adjusted the servings. I probably should have had the heat on a higher temp when I seared it to get that dark brown crust. I rubbed it in flour to coat but not too much. I did make sure I got all sides when searing it and seared it a little longer on each side since my roast was bigger, almost 6 lbs. I added cabbage and used the baby carrots but added those with an hour left. I just used water and red wine but next time I will do beef/chicken broth. I checked it after 3 hours to check on the liquid and it was fine. I could have spooned liquid over it but wanted to see how it was without. Next time, I think I will try that. I did use an iron dutch oven with a lid, this kept it from drying out. Came out perfect. Has great taste and was very easy to do. Doesn't get much easier than this. Even if you aren't a good cook, think you can make this meal and impress anyone. Lots of leftovers and taking some to the in-laws tomorrow.

I always add broth instead of water if available,or add beef cubes/paste.
for better flavoring. The more intense the flavors the better in most cases. After it's fully cooked I remove all veg./meat from pan. I used corn starch to thicken the sauce in the pan then put the meat/veg back in. It coats 
every thing better.... much better!

I have tried several pot roast recipes recently and was disappointed with all of them. I was even thinking that Trader Joe's had downgraded their pot roasts in recent years. Then, I tried this recipe ... amazing! The only changes I make are adding in mushrooms from time to time and doubling the liquid, replacing chicken or beef stock instead of the water; also, I used olive oil instead of canola for searing. The roast is fork tender and full of so much flavor! It's a dish my whole family loves, even my 3 year old, who is not much of a meat eater normally.

The roast was very tender and flavorful! The vegetables were a bit crunchy, however. I would definitely add them a bit sooner next time. Otherwise, very good.

I substituted 1/2 cup no sodium beef stock for the water. This was delicious!  The au jus was great for dipping. I cooked my roast in a slow cooker on low for 8 hrs.

This roast is really tasty. I used the beef broth substitute instead of water, like most reviewers. Baked about 3 hrs and well done without being dry. Used 1 large sliced onion, but did roast carrots in a different pan and served with mashed potatoes. Also want to say I rarely cook with wine but did use a calif. red organic and made some gravy with pan juices. Will def be making this again. Thanks KarenCooks.

This is the best pot roast I have ever had!  I make gravy out of the drippings just by adding some flour and some beef broth.  The red wine based gravy is delicious.  We love this recipe and it is a regular in our house.

My mom and I loved this recipe.  My boys thought it was 'alright'.  They are not big 'pot roast' fans, but they did eat this and didn't end up making themselves a PB&J later, so that is saying something.

This was a good roast.  The only thing I changed was I cooked it in my crockpot instead of the oven since I was going to be gone all day.  I think I cooked it a little too long, but just poured a little of the juices over the roast when serving.  Made my house smell heavenly.

The name fits. The beef chuck turned out very tender. Like other reviewers I replaced the water with beef broth. Also I did not have pearl onions so I added more onion to the top of the meat. The wine I used was Merlot since I already had it open. Thanks for the recipe KarenCooks.

Initially I was scared because the smell of the wine was so strong, but 4.5 hours later, the house smelled good enough to eat!  * I also used beef broth instead of water. This one's a keeper!!!

Excellently tender meat and vegetables. I'm gluten-intolerant, so I skipped the flour and braised it in a cast-iron pan. I used beef broth instead of water, adding another 1 cup of red wine/broth combo when I put in the vegetables. There was a little something lacking for me with this dish; maybe I needed to add more salt. But overall, very delicious and I will make it again.

This is essentially my go-to pot roast recipe. The browning, the braising, the carrots and potatoes, thickening the gravy. Everything this recipe calls for.

I use wine to loosen up the brown bits (is it called fond?), and beef broth or stock - water is a missed opportunity to add flavor.

My mother made a great pot roast, and I tried for years and was always disappointed. 

It took me a long time to learn, and none of the recipes were specific, but the key was not to, NOT TO, cover the meat with liquids! Cover the meat half way, add liquid as needed, throughout cooking, but DON'T COVER THE MEAT WITH LIQUID!!!

Turning the meat half way through may be good, but the flavor and texture aren't the best if meat is submerged in even the most flavorful combination of liquids.

That's all I'll add to this excellent recipe.

This was awesome, however, I would add 1 more cup liquid to start.  Very flavorful, great tender roast and yummy vegetables.

I made this last night and it was good, but 1 cup of liquid to cook 3 hours is way too little.  Now I need to use oven cleaner to clean my stainless dutch oven.  If I make again, I'll definitely use more liquid to start off.

After taking a hiatus from red meat for 6 months, pot roast was my first choice for a “Welcome back!” meal. I have been using this recipe for several years and am shocked there are not more reviews! This pot roast is phenomenal. I have always followed the recipe exactly until last night when I added celery because I had a bunch that was about to go bad.

This was a delicious pot roast.  However, I needed to add WAY MORE liquid than called for, even though I started out doubling the wine and water amounts.  I will make again, keeping a close eye one the liquid as it cooks.

Made this today using my cast iron pot. Pretty much followed recipe and cooking method by flouring a 3 pound chuck roast but as some suggested put herbs in flour and then coated meat. After browning meat on all sides, took it out of pot and sautéed onions slightly with a big clove of fresh minced garlic and then added beef broth and red wine. Put roast back in pot and poured onions on top with broth.  Cooked in oven for about 2 hours put in a small bag of the small Yukon potatoes quartered with baby

Didn't love it, didn't hate it...had a bit too much spices in it, in a combo that I wasn't crazy for.  I might try it again using less spices.  I also reduced the amount of water as other posters suggested.

The pot roast came out perfect. The wine gave it the over the top flavor. My only change was to use a crock pot and Yukon Gold potatoes.  Oh, and I threw in one of those little cartons of fresh sliced mushrooms.   A keeper recipe for sure!!Thaks for the great and easy recipe.

After browning the roast I de glazed the pan with a portion of the wine/water and added the remaining flour to thicken.  Poured this over the roast and put in the oven.  Roasting potatoes and carrots only took 45 minutes then I turned the oven down to 275 until we were ready to eat.  Wonderful aroma while cooking and received compliments from guests... for our Midwestern pot roast meal.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe as written - perfect! For variation, I substituted beef broth for water plus added mushrooms. Also great. If you have a crowd, serve over rice (or is that just a Southern thing???) Can't go wrong with this recipe. :)

This recipe just did not look right to either me or my wife. First of all, as other people have stated, there's nowhere near enough liquid to roast this in. Instead of 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup wine we used 2 cups of beef broth and one cup of wine.  We also used 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper to coat the roast with before coating it in the flour prior to browning it.  When simmering the wine/beef stock  mixture prior to adding the roast back in we added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  In order to better flavor the roast, we added a mixture of spices directly on the roast  rather than in the simmering sauce before placing it back in the roasting pan which included 2 teaspoons Berbere and 1 teaspoon each of basil, oregano, thyme, celery salt, ground mustard, sumac and turmeric. We skipped adding the bay leaves as I have never noticed any change in taste to any food I have ever used them in.  All these spices together added tremendous taste without any "heat" or burning sensation which  neither of us enjoys (we never add hot pepper flakes to any recipe that calls for them since even 1/8 teaspoon of them makes it nearly impossible to eat for us). The biggest problem with this recipe is that it takes FAR less time than the four hours listed to fully cook. We felt it might take just three hours and luckily we checked the 3 pound roast after two hours of cooking when we were going to add the potatoes and carrots and it was already at 195°!  We then had to allow

Only changes I made was to soak potatoes in salt water for 15 minutes and  to NOT preheat oven. I adjusted cooking time accordingly using a meat thermometer. Good flavor with the spice mix.

Soooo delicious. I cooked it on my BBQ grill to keep the heat from permeating the house. I turned on only one of the grill elements and kept the temperature at 250-300 ish. It went for 4.5 hours and the meat was super tender. The neighbor who tired it asked for the recipe. This is a keeper.

I've made this three times now, but I modified it a little.

Instead of water, I used beef stock.

Also, for the red wine, I use Tawny Port Wine instead. I've used this wine in another pot roast recipe and it has a better flavor than just red wine.

Everything else is the same it comes out delicious and the family loves it.

This weekend we had a spate of cold weather and it was a perfect day for this.  
I used a whole cup of red wine and did not use the half cup of water.  I fried the onion slices in olive oil first.  Then I floured and browned the top roast in the same cast iron skillet.  I halved just some regular yellow small onions and fried those along with a pound and a half of sliced mushrooms.  I poured mushrooms and onions in the crockpot on top of the roast, which i placed on top of the sliced onions.  I peeled and roughly chopped four toes of garlic and threw them in the cast iron skillet. After about half of minute with the garlic I poured the red wine into the pan to get all flavor out.  I poured the wine over the roast.  I then added two 15 oz. cans of low sodium beef broth and two 15 oz. cans of fire roasted tomatoes.  I poured a one pound bag of carrots in then threw in the halved redskins. 
 It was a good recipe but lacked any zing.  I don't know if it was the wine I picked or something else.  My guests loved it.  I was just hoping for more.

The only change I made was using chicken broth instead of water.  I increased both the broth and wine to make a bit more liquid.  The house smelled wonderful, and the meat was tender and delicious!  The only thing I would do differently would be to add mushrooms next time around.

This turned out delicious with using beef broth in place of water. My husband loved it! I made a gravy with more broth and what was left in the pan.

This was an early dinner.  I used a 2 pound chuck roast and otherwise followed the recipe.  I checked on the roast after two hours and the meat was done. Perfect; except for two hours too soon! I added the vegetables and a little water and cooked it for another hour.  Very good, except the meat was a little overdone.  Next time, I will cook for one hour.  Add the vegs. for another hour.    Taste was great.  I don't think it needs beef broth as so many here suggest.  Water and wine seem to do the job.

The meat was tender and moist,and the gravy was delicious.  I used my tall cast iron skillet.  I had a small 1.5 lb. Chuck roast so I baked it for only 2 hours.  The only change I made was to put the potatoes and carrot right away, due to the shorter cooking time.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I added was a clove of chopped garlic, and I used all dried ingredients as that was what I had to work with. Thanks for the great recipe! I plan to make it once a month.

This was just ok.  I had to cook the roast a lot longer than it said.  The flavor was ok, I don't think I'll make it again.

Planned to have leftovers, but my crew finished it all.   Followed the recipe, but added a little fresh garlic with the onion slices and substituted sweet potatoes for the red potatoes to make it more paleo friendly.  Needles to say it was  a big hit.

Excellent.  Mine cooked quicker, even though it was a 5 lb roast, so check your roast after 2 hrs.  I added a beef cube to the water.  The gravy was divine. Thank you.

Yummy! I was looking for a recipe to use my new  Dutch Oven. This roast and the gravy was the best we have ever had . I have made roast forever including this recipe in my crock pot and it turns out nice and is super easy but using the  Dutch oven the  taste far surpassed every roast I have ever made. This will be a regular meal in our home. For those like us following  a Whole30 lifestyle I replaced wine / water with chicken broth and the flour with arrowroot flour. I have this in my oven now and we cant wait for dinner time, the house smells heavenly!!

Bottom round was on sale so that's what I used. As per the submitters review I used beef broth, 1 1/2 cups of home made with 1/2 cup of red wine. I had fresh thyme so I used a sprig of that instead of dried. I didn't want to babysit the roast so I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 1 hour and then on low for another three. I added the carrots after two hours and the potatoes after three. Amazing flavour!! I've been trying different pot roasts and so far this is my favourite. Thanks for sharing.

My family loved it, and I did too!  I made it exactly as written, except for the beef broth instead of water substitution that everyone mentions, as well as the small yellow onions instead of pearl onions, which the submitter KarenCooks says in her review is how it should have been posted.  It was very easy, it was done in the amount of time stated, and it was delicious.

There's nothing that rings in fall better to me than that first good pot roast, and this recipe definitely nailed it. I did find that my particular pot roast (baked in a Dutch oven as recipe suggests) required quite a bit more liquid than called for. When adding the potatoes and carrots, I opted to use 32 oz. beef bone broth. I didn't have marjoram, and I also decided to use a couple of bay leaves, which I felt gave the jus a nice flavor. My husband (who is a true northern-rooted southern born) says it was the best roast he's had!

Thanks again for this great recipe!

I added 1 cup wine and 1/2 cup beef broth.  I browned onions , garlic and mushrooms in pan after browning meat and deglazed the pan with wine. I love veggies so added peas, carrots and potatoes. I cooked everything in slow cooker on high 4 hours.

I made this twice so far, and it was perfect......but as usual, the recipe is a guideline and I did some minor changes.
I used a 5 lb top round cut it in half,  and seared it in a cast iron skillet which I used to roast it in.   I added garlic , bay leaves, and beef stock to the wine and seasonings, and put the veggies in the whole time it was in the oven the first time I made it and for two hours the second time....I use baby carrots, onion,celery, and potatoes. I also got to snip fresh parsley, scallions and thyme from the garden before serving. It was a hit both times I served it. I'm adding this to my recipe file.

I am making this now and cut the time down since my roast was under 3 lbs, but even at 2 hours the liquid burnt along with the onions it says to place on top!  So disappointed,  I had to scrap out the burnt onions and double the liquid so I could add the vegi's...Guess I'll know soon how it turns out!  4 hours is too long in my opinion!

The seasoning made the meat look blackened and the wine had a similar affect on the veggies, but the meat fell apart and was delicious.  I think I may have added a bit too much wine, because the potatoes absorbed a lot of the flavor.  Also, I used a burgundy wine, which is strong.
All in all it was a wonderful dinner!  I will definitely make it again, but maybe a Merlot instead.

This was awesome!  I don't have a pot that goes in the oven.  So I cooked in regular dutch oven, deglazed that with the wine (I used a Cabernet) & organic vegetable broth (a change I made to the ingredients) transferred to an aluminum pan I had (no forks did not want to loose any juices) covered really well with foil.  The pearl onions are wonderful Hard to peel but I'll use more next time.  It was worth it.  OH and I used 3 1/2 lb bottom round rump roast.  I do believe the potatoes/carrots have to go in way earlier.   Next time I'm making mashed!    YUMMMM!!  Oh and plenty of gravy.  Of course I adjusted the liquid ingredients measure a tad for the extra 1/2 lb of roast.  I have this recipe memorized!!  Thanks so much!!

Best roast ever. I followed your directions, but also - 
sprinkled garlic, added no salt, used the beef bouillon suggestion instead of water (1 cup), 1 cup of the wine too instead of 1/2 cup. I laid two twigs of rosemary over the top and I flipped it half way through. I didn't have onion or marjoram, so those were not included. Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely love this!! Tender, juicy, tasty. Speared it with 6 cloves of garlic and didn't sear it or cover with flower because of wheat and gluten intolerances but I did wipe it dry with paper towel.  The onions are superb served with the broth.  Planning on adding some gourmet mushrooms to the cooking to see how this turns out.  Definitely a favorite!

So Easy to make!  Meat turned out so tender, the wine gave it a nice mature taste. I used the martha stewart roast pot to brown the meat, then threw in the  potatoes (peruvian, golden and red) with carrots and onions  around the roast before I put it in the oven. I substituted Marjoram with Fresh Rosemary  and rubbed the roast with the basil, thyme and rosemary just before putting it in the oven. 
There  was minimal mess and clean up! The last 10 minutes I threw some dinner rolls in the oven with the roast and viola, dinner is served!   My husbands woofed it down and the clean up with minimal!

This worked great.  I used a five-pound roast and followed others' suggestions to substitute beef stock for the water.  I also doubled the water and wine but actually I don't think that was necessary as the meat produced juices as it cooked and made the liquid almost too full for the pan.  I don't have a dutch oven, so I seared the meat in a saucepan and then transferred everything to a baking dish that I covered with foil.

One of the best pot roasts we've ever had. Made it as a stove top pot roast (gas range so good temperature control). Very delicious! Definitely will make again.

I made this pot roast and it turned out wonderful.  I used 1/4C red wine, 1/4C chicken broth and 1/4 - 1/2C  beef broth.  I didn't use onions or garlic as my husband doesn't care for them.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I cooked this in a slow cooker on low for 7 hours, and it is so tender and flavorful. The house smells wonderful, too. I didn't have potatoes, so I'll serve it with mashed potatoes that I keep in the pantry for a quick side dish. I threw in a handful or two of celery cut into chunks, used one cup of red wine and one cup of water since I was going to be out all day and didn't want to have the roast dry out in the crock pot.
I haven't tried to slice it yet,  but the little piece that I tore off with a fork was yummy, tender and moist.

Old man cooking! I'm starting slow, but getting better. Made this Pot Roast two weeks ago and loved it. Just put a 5# roast into the oven for my second Pot Roast ever.
I doubled the wine, used double the beef broth, Herbs de Provence Thyme, salt pepper.

WOW, thx Karencooks

I added garlic, a little bit of honey and a bay leaf.  I made it in a crock pot.  I browned the beef well in a Dutch oven before putting in the crock. I cooked the onions and garlic in the same Dutch oven, then deglazed the pan with red wine and added to the crock. I added water to barely cover the beef and added the seasonings. Then I cooked for six to eight hours in the crock pot.  Everyone who has tasted it loved it.

In a word, dee-LISH!  I only roasted for two hours in my cast iron Dutch oven, then put the veggies in for the last hour.  My 3.5 lb. roast was sooooo tender and flavorful, and the veggies were not mushy!  I did not use the flour, and I just "eyeballed" the seasonings.  I thickened the pan juices with arrowroot to make a great sauce.  Thanks for posting this fool-proof method for real comfort food!

I used small regular onions, quartered, rather than pearl onions and added parsnips.  Really good.  I used a Dutch oven but can see doing the same recipe in a crock pot/slow cooker.  Nice to have an easy and reliable recipe such as this.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!  I did not add potatoes or carrots or pearl onions, only because I did not have them in the house.  However, no need. We devoured it.  Pure perfection.  So easy to make.  I used beef boullion with the water as someone else suggested.

I made this today for Sunday dinner and it was amazing!  I may it in my cast iron skillet and I used a venison roast.  I also replaced the red wine with a rue of grape jam and red wine vinegar. The meal made it's own gravy in the bottom that was divine. This will be a family favorite for sure!  My teen age son, who does NOT like gravy said as I was putting the leftovers away,"I would tell you to give the juice to the dog, but forget that!"

I never cooked a roast in my life and I've made this twice and each time it came out moist and delicious. You do have to keep a weather eye on the cooking, but it's worth it in the end. I've used two different cuts of meat - a 3 lb chuck roast and a 5 lb top sirloin roast. For the sirloin roast I doubled the recipe and substituted beef broth for the water and it came out fantastic. A bit of advice though: place about half as much more liquid than the recipe calls for along with half the spice mixture and heat it on very low while the roast is cooking. Once it comes to a boil cut the heat then use this mixture to baste the roast once for every hour of cooking time.

I made this exactly as listed except I only added carrots, I was out of potatoes and onion and we were snowed in!  This was the best roast I've made yet! Very tender and full of flavor.

Made it with porkchops instead of pork roast and my bf Loved it. He even finished off the leftovers.  For pork chops I coated them in egg and breadcrumbs, then browned them on both sides before making the sauce. For the sauce I added more wine and instead of tomato paste I used diced tomatoes for some additional veggies.

Excellent. I ran out of time however and only cooked it for 3 hours and it was still really good and plenty tender. I would say it serves 6 though and not 12. Also I used regular russet potatoes because that is what I had and they worked out just fine.

This was an outstanding recipe. I've shared it with several of my "cooking" friends already and they have all said the same thing. Those that like venison will want to try this in place of the beef. It's mouth-watering to say the least.
