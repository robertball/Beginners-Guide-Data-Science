YUM!  I made this for Christmas morning for my inlaws. It turned out great. I did take a lot of the suggestions and modified this recipe. Here's what I did: Used Italian bread from the bakery (French bread seemed like too much crust). I also whipped 1 1/2 bricks cream cheese w/ 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and spread it over the cubed bread. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) and only 10 eggs. I also made sure to press the bread down so that everything got french toast consistancy. The syrup is delicious!! I made 1.5 times and poured 2/3 of it over the dish and the other 1/3 was put on the table for those who wanted a little bit more. Overall, this is a great recipe!! Will be sure to make at my next brunch. Thank you!

I am only giving this 3 stars because, as written, it needs some work. It is, however, a great basis for a recipe. I try to only give feedback that I think is truly helpful, so here are my suggestions. 1. Make sure you use a good hearty bread like an Italian or French loaf from the bakery. If you use basic loaf bread, it will be way too soggy. You do not want a soft or delicate bread. 2. After placing the first layer of bread, sprinkle with cinnamon for more flavor. 3. After reading many reviews, I decided to mix 1.5 blocks of cream cheese with 1/4 c. of powdered sugar and then spread it on the bread.  I thought it was still hard to spread, so next time I will add a little milk to thin it out. Maybe also a dash of vanilla. 3. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) & they worked well.  You could also definitely use more than a cup in the middle of the french toast. 4. After placing the 2nd layer of bread, sprinkle with cinnamon again. 5. I thought the blueberry sauce was lacking a certain wow factor, so I added a little fresh lemon juice. This definitely gave it what I thought had been missing.  Overall, this was very good with modifications and would be great when you have have company. Next time, I will make this with strawberries instead, and I'm betting it will taste like a breakfast version of strawberry shortcake!

Delicious and beautiful, and perfect just as written.  I used a good quality Italian bread, and chose to serve the blueberry sauce on the side. My out of town guests, both of whom are professional chefs, loved this so much they asked for the recipe.  Gooey, creamy and crunchy all at the same time, depending on what forkful hits your mouth! Any leftover sauce (I made a double recipe of it) would be great on waffles, pancakes, pound cake or ice cream.  We all enjoyed this very much!

I made this for Christmas Eve Brunch.  I followed the advice of others and decreased the cream cheese to 10 oz.  I added a little milk and whipped the cream cheese and spread it on the slices of bread.  A little messy but it was evenly distributed.  I also took the advice of others and doubled the amount of blueberries in the syrup and in the dish itself.  Atleast use one and a half the blueberries when making it.  I cut the sugar in the syrup to 3/4 cup - it was plenty sweet.  I added a dsh of cinnamon and nutmeg to the syrup too.  I still had a request to get out the regular maple syrup.  All in all, a very easy dish that is a little different from the standard egg casseroles so often served for a crowd at breakfast or brunch.  I would make this again - next time I will try strawberries.

Tasty. I used cinnamon raisin swirl bread, 10 eggs, and a grating of nutmeg. After reading comments about the blobs of cream cheese I chilled the brick in the freezer and then grated it over the bottom layer, much more efficient than spreading on bread. And then to add a bit more colour and zing I threw in a handful of chopped fresh cranberries. Yum!

My husband REALLY likes this recipe.  I've made it twice now. The second time I tried it with strawberries.  That was good too.  Just like everyone else I've made adjustments to the recipe....I 1) doubled the amount of blueberries, 2) cut the cream cheese to one package and whipped it with a little bit of milk, sugar and vanilla so that it made like a filling (works great!), 3) doubled the "syrup" recipe, 4) I've made it with day old French bread and day old croissants.

This has been one of our favorites for a few years now.  This makes a lot, so be sure to use your largest casserole dish.  If you prepared this way ahead of time and it has been well refrigerated, it will need extra time on the counter "warming up" to room temperature before you cook it.  You'll have a more difficult time cooking it all the way through if it's too cold.  Delicious, unique recipe.

I have made this recipe many times as is and it is really great. I now make it with a few minor variations and everyone loves it. For the bread, I use french bread (it gives it a much lighter, fluffier texture than regular bread), I only use 8 oz. of cream cheese, I use 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead of 1/3 cup and I sprinkled cinnamon over it before putting it in the fridge. The cinnamon really makes it smells great baking. Everyone loves it. This is a staple in our house for Christmas morning or anytime I have friends or relatives visiting. It lets me spend more time with them and less time in front of the stove.

I couldn't help myself...I made some changes on my own which turned out to be AMAZING!  ~ I could eat this for desert.  I have a 12 year old, a 10 year old and a 7 year old. ~ They all gave it rave reviews.  I put cubed French bread and croissants into my buttered dish.  Then I added my *"cream cheese mixture" over top, then topped with the blueberries.  The next morning I used a knife and very gently swirled some of the cream cheese mixture into the casserole, not to incorporate, just to allow the cream cheese mixture to soak down a bit. It made a beautiful presentation.  I will definitely make this one over and over.  *(cream cheese mixture: 2 8oz Cream cheese and 3/4 c. sugar, cream well.  Add 1 egg and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice.  Cream well.)  I hope you try this change.  This is now one of my favorite breakfast casseroles.  Of course...fruit is an option.  (with strawberries it would be amazing too!)  :)

This was great and very easy.  I made it for company today and it got rave reviews--even the super picky 7-year-old said it was the best breakfast he had ever eaten!  I used egg substitute for half the eggs and light cream cheese, but you would never know it.  It was still very rich and filling.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the egg mixture, which I think was a nice addition.  I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda in the blueberry sauce, and that worked great.  I will definitely make this again, and very soon!

Excellent recipe.  Enough with the praise here is the mods I employed. 

1. reduced the cream cheese to 12oz

2. I doubled the sauce but I dont think it is necesary

3. the cornstarch in the sauce I only used 2 TBS cause that will keep it from thickening too much

4. I used 1 loaf of french bread and only cut it into 12 slices and made them almost like sandwiches.

5. I made the cream cheese with a bit of milk and mixed it up to a consitancy that I could spoon it on to the bread


I made this the night before and the bread soaked the mixture up fine.

The answer to the CREAM CHEESE PROBLEM:  One reviewer suggested freezing and then grating the cream cheese for even distribution.  I tried this but the frozen block (used only 12 ozs.) was so hard, I could not grate it.  So, I got out my Cuisinart food processor with the grating disk, ran the block down the shoot, and in 15 seconds had "cream cheese snow" that easily and evenly covered the entire dish.  Note:  use a rubber spatula and work quickly or the cream cheese will melt and be more difficult to distribute.  When baked, the cream cheese was not evident as a separate ingredient, but added a creaminess that everyone at my New Years brunch raved about.  Also upped the blueberries, only 10 eggs, 1-1/2 sauce recipe using 1/2 sugar, 1/2 Splenda.  A keeper!!

Always a crowd pleaser... My mother-in-law owns a Bed and Breakfast and makes a variation of this and taught me how to make this MUCH easier. Combine ingredients in Step 2 into a blender.Also I only use 9 large eggs therefore, it won't be such a close call. And this way cream cheese will be much more evenly distributed. Pour over cubed bread as follows. For an eye appealing final touch I sprinkle 1/4 C. Domino Washed Raw Cane Sugar over the top just before baking. When serving to children I make the bluberry sauce optional in a pretty glass bowl. (More for adults!)

I made this for x-mas last year and it was a hit with the entire family.  I used french bread instead of regular loaf bread.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested cutting the cream cheese into smaller pieces as they did not melt completely.  Otherwise, I am planning to make this again.  It is a nice change from the traditional x-mas food.

I softened the cream cheese then spread over whole bread slices. Put two together like a sandwich then cube.  This distributes the cream cheese evenly.

Absolutely fantastic! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and halved the cream cheese which I softened and creamed with some milk and sugar until it was easy to spread over the bottom bread layer. I also added 1 tsp. of lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I doubled the blueberries to 2 cups. I used challah bread, but also think croissants would be great. To the eggs, I added 2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon and used 1 c. milk and 1 c. half and half. The suggestion to flip the bread in the morning before baking is ingenious! It made all the difference in not having mushy bread. I made the blueberry topping as the recipe dictated. I also made the Buttermilk Syrup recipe from this site and served it on the side. This recipe got rave reviews at my office breakfast. Delicious! Thanks KARAN for the great recipe.

Ohemgee--this was fahreaking yummy. I made only a half recipe of this. I used leftover Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls from the night before, reduced fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk, for a richer "custardy" flavor. Instead of maple syrup, I used Smuckers blueberry syrup to make it more fruity. I did use a frozen organic berry blend as I didn't have fresh berries and I increased the berries to a full cup for a half recipe. I did toss the berries with just a little flour before adding them to the eggs. This did take just over an hour to bake, about an hour-fifteen. Because breakfast was so late, I used what was left of the Smuckers blueberry syrup instead of making my own. This was a hit! My two boys ate seconds and if I wasn't watching my weight, I would have, too. Really, really good and fantastic for using leftover rolls, frozen fruit from my freezer and little odds and ends from my fridge before our big move. YUM! NOTE: I think next time, I might make a sweeter cream cheese "filling" out of berries and a little confectioners sugar. I wish I'd read the reviews before I'd made this. That would have really taken this dish over the top. Having the syrup was important without sweetened cream cheese but I think we'd have used less syrup if I had sweetened it.

Wow.  An instant family favorite.  Made for a brunch and everyone raved.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1 1/2 blocks of cream cheese whipped with 1/4 confectioner's sugar.  Then I put it in an icing bag (you can use a plastic baggy with the corner cut off) and it made it very easy to squirt all over the bread.  :) Also sprinkled it all with a little nutmeg and cinnamon before it went in the fridge overnight.  Wonderful recipe - you won't be disappointed!

Beautiful presentation!  Served this to a group after a morning motorcycle ride with a side of peppered bacon and mimosas.  Perfect ending to a beautiful sunny spring morning. Thank you Karan1946 for the submission.  You made me look like a rock star!

This dish is awesome!!!  I have been making it for years; and its a special breakfast on our yearly trip to the Outer Banks.  Make it the night before; and enjoy it in the morning.  The syrup is also very delicious; bit I don't always make it to save calories,  time and money;(I use a lite syrup) -  but you can never go wrong with  homemade syrup -  it is wonderful.  I also use whole wheat bread; skim milk and light cream cheese to make it a little healthier.  ENJOY its a great company breakfast.

Always delicious! I half this recipe for a resulting 6 large servings, but keep the blueberry amounts the same. Also, I use frozen blueberries and whole wheat bread without any negative effects.

This has become our Christmas morning tradition.  It is a very forgiving recipe that anyone with a little kitchen intuition will be able to turn into a masterpiece!  It's different every year I make it, but one thing that I've made a permanent addition is the use of canned blueberry pie filling in the dish rather than making the sauce from scratch for the top.  With the pie filling, it's goey and sweet enough.  I plop heaping spoonfuls in the middle, the same layer as adding the cream cheese, and it blends and bubbles just beautifully. I use frozen blueberries in place of fresh (limited supply and high cost in December!). We keep pancake syrup nearby but only the kids seem to want it.  Some years the bread I've used has required more egg/milk, which I could tell in the morning after it soaked and seemed too dry.  I've used french bread, italian, and plain old wonder bread, it all works.  Cinnamon is a useful touch (mix in with the egg/milk).    Can't wait to make it again!!  The best part is having a special breakfast cooking that requires very little attention while the kiddos open presents!

I've been making this for years. It's a brunch staple in our home! I never use day old bread, but usually an Italian bread or even a loaf of white bread (a whole loaf). I cut the cream cheese into small pieces and place throughout the dish, not just on top because it really doesn't melt that well. Using frozen blueberries works just fine as well by the way!  For those in our group who aren't too into blueberries, I serve with regular maple syrup. After making it once it becomes a really simple dish to throw together the night before. Excellent!

I got really good reviews on this french toast.  I usually make the Baked French Toast from this site, but I decided to try something different, a little less sweet.  Everyone really liked it.  I made some modifications as others did.  I used Peppridge Farm Oatmeal bread and dried it in the oven at 200 for about an hour.  I only used one block of cream cheese and 10 eggs.  I didn't have vanilla extract so I used about 1/4 tsp. rum extract, didn't want the flavor to be overwhelming, especially for the kids.  I also added a dash of cinnammon to the egg mixture.  I didn't use the maple syrup, which was an accident, but honestly, it doesn't need it, save the calories!  I used frozen blueberries which worked out just fine.  When I took the tray out to brown I took a knife and spread out the cream cheese so that it wouldn't be all lumpy.  Final result, the perfect breakfast casserole served with a side of sausage links.

When I first saw this recipe I thought, WOW!  My guys, being "blueberry-aholics" would LOVE this, & they did!   But, I had to make a change to it next time  .  Did I mention they love B.B.'s?  Well, I doubled the blueberries in the dish, & made double B.B. sauce too.  For the problem of the cream cheese "chunks",  I reduced the amount of cheese, added some confectioners sugar, & whipped it up.  Then put the mixture into a pastry bag with a small (not too small) round tip in it.  About the size of the "o" of my keyboard.  Maybe a tad bigger.  Sorry, hard to describe.  Then I splooked in dots every where, both layers.  I use a pastry bag for EVERTHING, if I can .  If I use the word "French toast" they expect cinnamon.  So, I added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I think that was it.  Oh!  I added a splash of lemon to the syrup, and a Tbsp. of sugar & 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the egg mixture.  WOWEE!  

AND, strawberries are FAB & can't wait for you all to try peaches ( now there's MY fruit!) or apples.  Obviously you have to adjust spices for other fruits, but you'll start looking at this dish as a FABULOUS desert too!  As Chef John says, "enjoy"!

This was a HUGE success and has immediately become a brunch staple. I made it for a family girls' weekend and the ladies raved about it, demanding that it become an annual tradition for the girls weekend getaway. I incorporated some of the changes recommended by other reviewers, mainly, use 12 oz of cream cheese and hearty french bread with a good crust, reduced eggs to 10 and added cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture. For the blueberry sauce, I added some fresh lemon juice. 
The one thing I want to experiment with, is getting some crunch into the recipe - the bread on top crisped up a bit, but some additional crunchy texture would send this over the top.

I wasn't quite sure what bread to use so I opted for Oroweat's Italian bread.  I used 12 slices and dried them out a bit in the oven.  I used 2 less eggs, 1/2 C less milk and 1/2 of the cream cheese.  I think whatever bread you choose should be enough to fill your dish.  I salted the egg mixture to bring out the flavors and might add some butter extract next time.  I missed the butter taste from regular blueberry french toast/pancakes.  Oh, and I added a sprinkling of cinnamon on top as others suggested.

This is scrumptious!!  I love to assemble this the night before and pop it in the oven for breakfast.  2 packages of cream cheese is way too much for this.  I only use about 1/2 of an 8 oz package.  I cut it into small peices and distribute it evenly over all.  Don't skip the blueberry syrup...it's a must!!

We didn't care for this recipe. I especially did not like the cream cheese in it. The cubes never melted all the way and there ended up being just globs of it all over the toast and made it very mushy. The cream cheese did nothing for this dish, and I think it would have been much better without it. I did like the blueberry sauce, but ended up throwing out all the toast, so had nothing to eat it with!

This was absolutely delicious. I made this for mother's day brunch, and loved the minimal effort on the morning of. I only used one package of cream cheese, and that was plenty. Also, I had a bit of frozen pound cake leftover from my son's birthday so I cubed that up and put it in with the french bread, I know its not the healthiest, but it's not something you're going to eat all the time. My family loved it and my mom said it was the best thing she had ever eaten.

i took others reviews and made quite a few changes. 1) used 2 loafs french bread.  2) used 12oz cream cheese.  3) i whipped the cream cheese with a few dashes nutmeg, cinnamon...a little milk and few Tbl. powdered sugar. then daloped it on the bread.  4) 10 eggs instead of 12.  5)i doubled the "sauce" recipe  (but didn't need to..lots left over even after drizzling over the top). also cut the sugar down to 1.5c.  6) dusted the top with cinnamon before baking.  mmm.  It was gobbled up at the brunch today.  i will do everything the same next time except doubling the sauce!

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe to the letter, except for two things: I left out the butter in the sauce and added a little bit of powdered sugar to the cream cheese. Because of adding the sugar to the cream cheese, I didn't put it in the casserole as cubes, but spread it over the bread instead. Made this for myself for mother's day. I was so happy :P

This turned out wonderfully! Modifications I made were from other reviews: mix cream cheese with powdered sugar and cinnamon, then spread on six pieces of bread, then cube and arrange on bottom of pan. The rest of the recipe is great! If doubling, prepare in separate pans so the middle doesn't turn out soggy. Blessings!

This recipe is incredible.  I freeze it as well and pull it out for special occasions or vacations.  For those who did not like the cream cheese cubes, I didn't either.  I cream the cream cheese with sugar and then spread it in a layer or drop in globs.  It was a huge improvement. It also melts.  It will be my goto fancy breakfast.

This recipe is delicious, almost like a bread pudding! I too used a crusty loaf of french bread and only 10 eggs. For the cream cheese I only used 1.5 packages. I let them soften on the counter and then beat them with some powdered sugar and lemon zest. Please trust me as this makes all the difference! I was then able to spoon it over the 1st layer. It baked wonderfully. Do not over bake, for those worrying about it being mushy, I let it sit for a little and it set up and cut just fine. One batch of syrup was enough for us, I added more lemon zest and some brandy. Made for a very nice Father's Day brunch.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like this with the cream cheese in it but I ended up loving it! I halved the recipe and put it in an 11x7 pyrex and it fit perfectly. I used fresh Texas toast that I threw in the oven directly onto the oven rack. The oven had 'leftover warmth' from dinner and it dried it out a bit. I used just shy of the amount of milk called for due to other complaints of it being too soggy. Kept the eggs and cream cheese the same (per half recipe). I used frozen organic blueberries which are way smaller than normal blueberries and liked it very well. I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top but next time will mix it in the egg batter because when I went to put it in the oven I used another reviewers suggestion and flipped the entire thing over so that the top would get some of the egg wash, and now my spices were on the bottom crust. I am glad I flipped it because my results were a perfectly light and fluffy, but still moist, bread that I think characterizes French Toast! I also mixed my cream cheese with powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla, all of which I eyeballed and mixed to a spreading consistency then spread onto half the bread slices and then cut them up.

We did not enjoy this very much.  It seems to be a ton of calories that don't really deliver on the taste.  The cream cheese is unnecessary and sometimes unpleasant - it doesn't really melt down so every once in a while you get a big blob of cream cheese in your mouth leaving you wonder "where did that come from?" I like a good, rich breakfast every now and then, but I don't like feeling like there's a bit lump in my stomach and no yummy enjoyment to show for it.

Made this using a loaf of baked Rhodes bread dough, and substituted a can of drained blueberries for the fresh ones.  Served with maple syrup instead of the sauce for familiarity's sake.  Great recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe...with or without the vanilla (so if you don't have it don't panic)...my ONLY suggestion use French or Italian Bread NOT regular bagged loaves of bread or it will be REALLY mushy.  I use just the blueberry syrup recipes for when I make pancakes too!

We made this recipe on Christmas Eve. After reading all of the suggestions, we used 1 1/2 pkgs. of cream cheese, 9 eggs, added a little bit of vanilla, and another handful of Blueberries.  It was wonderful!  When we started the syrup, we realized that we didn't have any cornstarch. But, I made a roux,(flour and butter) and added it to the sugar syrup mixture. It worked great. I added the same amount of butter at the end also. We had NO complaints, and had family fom 6 yrs. to 80! We served it with the cheesey Ham and Hash Brown Casserole. YUM!!!!!

YUCK!  I made this for Christmas Eve breakfast.  Followed the recipe exactly as written. It comes out of the oven looking beautiful and goes downhill from there.  It has a very strange texture, the cream cheese makes it grainy.  My 4 year old wouldn't even touch it.  What a waste of good fruit.

A nice treat, not to-die-for, but very good. Read many other reviews and took their advice to scale back eggs, cream cheese, and sugar. Also took suggestion to add additional blueberries. Turned out great, however could have used a little more sugar after all. Also wasn't sure how to "cut" cream cheese into cubes, just kinda smeared it onto the bread and it melted fine. Will make again!

Very good, very original dish, especially for breakfast with company.  I made it recently for friends and it was a hit.  However, I think 12 eggs were more than necessary.  I used 9, and still had to add extra time and increase the heat to get the middle to set. The bread I used was 2 days old, and should have absorbed the eggs quite well. I think it would also be wonderful with substitute fruits, like strawberries or lingonberries.  Word to the wise:  get your guests to eat it all, because the it doesn't make for the best leftovers, due to the extremely eggy texture.  Overall, though, I think it's a great recipe and will definitely serve it again.

I always find the various changes that people make to recipes so helpful. I made a 'sort of' 1-1/2 recipe amount and used only one package of cream cheese as someone advised. (It was also advised to cut the cream cheese into 1/2" squares, rather than 1" squares).It was perfect.  Also, I used hoagie buns (exactly what the bread wrapper stated. I left the package open a day to dry the buns a bit.  I really lked the buns, as they provided more brown crust; thus, I didn't have any mushy bread problems. I would think leftover hamburger or hotdog buns would work nicely as well. I served the blueberry sauce on the side. I would NEVER have poured it all over the top...too messy and that would have created a soppiness I think. Our guests loved it.

I've made this three different times, once with the blueberries, once with apples, and once with savory ingredients (spinach and mushrooms with feta cheese instead of cream cheese).  When you make it with the fruity ingredients, this is reminiscent of a blintz.  The savory version of this is a little heartier; if you aren't big on sweets for breakfast (there must be someone like that, right?), this option might be something to try instead.  Overall, this recipe is really delicious, fairly easy to prepare (ahead of time!), and by simply throwing in anything that sounds good to you, it can also be easily customized...thus the 5 stars.  :)

This is very good.  I've made it twice now, and made a few changes, most significantly by doubling the amount of fruit.  A nice surprise for the family!

Amazing recipe!!! My dad and I modified it a bit.  After reading comments we bought 2 loaves of cinnamon swirl bread and used 10 oz. Of cream cheese spread and spread it on the bread before cutting it.  Then we used frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  It was delicious!

I made this today for my 1 year anniversary brunch. I cut the recipe in half because it's just the two of us. I made some changes to suit it more to our tastes. I used regular storebrand wheat bread, it's what I had on hand, used 5 eggs, almost tripled  the berries-1.5c (we just went to a pick your own and have a ton of berries), and used about 3oz of cream cheese. I sliced the cheese into very thin slices and spread it around so it was uniformly over the bread. I also added a couple of dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture. I put it into an 8x8 pan and let it sit overnight baked as prescribed \ the next morning. The cooking time was pretty accurate. For the sauce I made the full amount but cut the sugar and cornstarch in half. I forgot the butter but I don't think it needed it, maybe a squeeze of lemon juice.  I also made some whipped cream (1/2 c heavy whipping cream, 1.5 T confectioners sugar, and a 1/4 t of vanilla extract) whipped with hand mixer until stiff peaks formed. I didn't pour the sauce all over the pan, but just put it on the individual serving, then topped with the cream. The results were amazing, It was crispy/crunchy on top, moist in the middle and not soggy at all! I served it with bacon and hot tea. Presentation was beautiful. My husband was really excited once it was on his plate. I'll definately make it again. Next time I'd like to try it with challah and see if it makes a difference.

Loved this!!! I used challah bread and frozen blueberries. I had no problem with chunks of cream cheese. I cut the cream cheese into tiny cubes and it was a little mushy in the middle but yummy! Could use some cinnamon.

I think I made this as written about a year ago and wasn't too impressed by the blobs of cream cheese throughout the dish. I came back to it today and tried again given some of the mods by other reviewers and was wowed by what the slight changes did to the recipe.  I only used 8 eggs and whipped the cream cheese with some confectioners sugar for a while then spread on the bread cubes. I also used homemade bread from this site called "amish white bread." Fabulous!!!

I wasn't to sure about this recipe, but I wanted to try it because my daughter LOVES blueberries and I was looking for a good birthday brunch recipe that the kids would eat.  I changed a couple of things.  First I didn't let it sit overnight.  In the past this hasn't worked well for me.  The bread I was using was still pretty soft so I added 4 more pieces for a total of 16 slices.  Also, I added 1/3 cup of honey in addition to the maple syrup to make it a little sweeter.  I cut the cream cheese small in 1/4 inch pieces, and only used one brick instead of two.  Only put in 8 eggs because that was all I had, but didn't miss the other 4.  Also all I had was frozen blueberries.  Instead of a middle layer of blueberries and cream cheese I mixed it all up in the pan, let it sit for about 10 minutes then mixed it again before putting in the oven.  I was not going the make the syrup because I can buy blueberry syrup at my store, but thought I'd give it a try after reading other reviews.  I came together very nicely but next time I think I'll use a bigger pot because it did splatter quite a bit when it was boiling.  I am VERY glad that I went ahead and made the syrup.  It is better than anything blueberry that I have ever tasted. (I am personally not a big fan of blueberries, but I actually caught myself licking the spoon after putting the leftovers away!)  I served it on the side because the pan was so pretty without the syrup on it.  I will definately make this again!

For a slightly healthier version I substituted vanilla greek yogurt and neufchatel for the cream cheese. It turned out delicious on the very first try.

I didn't read reviews from other posters but I wish I had. This recipe is wonderful, but I wish I had creamed the cream cheese before hand as they stayed in their cube forms. My guest literally dug through and removed the lumps. Myself and a few others just creamed ours in. I added cinnamon on top of both layers of the bread and 1 sliced banana with my blueberry filling & also doubled the blueberry syrup recipe. All in all everyone loved the dish, I served it with thickly sliced turkey bacon; delicious. It's 12/27/11 & just made this again but omitted the blueberries, cream cheese, vanilla and maple syrup. I cubed the bread this morning & in large mixing bowl added 2 cups egg nog instead of milk & 2 TB cinnamon, soaked for about ten minutes then poured in a butter dish. I then dotted the top with butter, sprinkled some nutmeg and baked same as orig. directed. When I removed from oven I lightly drizzed maple syrup and served with warmed butter/maple syrup combo to top.

Wow what a hit! Added more blueberries and only 1 package of cream cheese. Also mixed everything including cream cheese together then folded into eggs. Served blueberry sauce on the side so the French toast was crispy on top when served. This deserves two Wows!!!!

This was great, but you must of have the blueberry sauce with it definitely, or else the french toast cream cheese is not sweet.  The sweetness comes from the blueberry sauce.  Which makes it a perfect combination.

Very tasty.  The sauce is the best part!  I halved the recipe and used regular sandwich bread cut into cubes.  I used fat-free cream cheese and Egg Beaters for the eggs, and skim milk.  I only had frozen blueberries and it worked out perfectly.  Like I said, the sauce is what really makes this a 5 star recipe.  Thank you Karan!

Fantastic-I use French bread instead of regular and add a little cinnamon but other than that I make it as is. 

The blueberry syrup is wonderful over pancakes, waffles, or ice cream-we make it a lot by itself!

I submitted this recipe to a national contest almost 40 years ago and won. It was later published in the "Taste of Home" cookbook.  My original recipe called for sugar. Since my family makes maple syrup I substituted one half cup of maple syrup heated in the microwave with the cinnamon. Stir the maple syrup to dissolve the cinnamon. My recipe also served the sauce on the side. I also used half and half sometime for a richer dish.

Just tried this and everyone loved it!  It does take time in the morning, so I got it out of the fridge as soon as I got up, then went to get myself ready.  I made 2 times the amount of syrup and people would have used more, it is fabulous.  One suggestion on the syrup, mix the sugar and cornstarch together before adding water to be sure the cornstarch doesn't clump.  Or else mix a little of the water with the cornstarch first.  I like the look of the large squares of cream cheese, and they browned a little as well.  Will be making this for the holidays.  Probably Christmas morning when I am tired after cooking for Christmas Eve.  It will be prefect to warm and cook while we relax and open presents.

Thanks for the great recipe!  What a wonderful breakfast for any special occasions, or just to make breakfast special on the weekend!

I had almost a half-gallon of blueberries left from last season in my freezer so I thought I could use some up to make room for more fresh.

MY twist was to use whole Texas Toast slices, versus chunks of bread!  I layered the bottom of my greased dish with the slices of Texas Toast.  My dish fit 3 across and 2 deep perfectly!  Also, I sliced the cold/firm cream cheese into strips (approx 1" wide x 3" long x 1/4" thick) to lay 3 or 4 across the bread slices  (again, it fit the bread slices perfectly!); added the blueberries ... topped with another layer of Texas Toast slices.  Poured the egg/cream/vanilla mix over it all, and as directed, refrigerated overnight.  This morning, I let it sit at room temperature approx 30 min.  Baked 30 minutes covered, and 30 minutes uncovered while I made the simple syrup with blueberries.

Voila!  No chunks or globs, just full layer of rich cheese and berries!  There wasn't room in the dish to pour the syrup over, so merely topped each plate with the hot blueberry syrup and served with whipped cream!

Boy did I earn some brownie points today!

This recipe was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly and it was soggy and watery. I really do not think this needed to sit overnight. That might help with the sogginess. I don't know that I would try this again, possibly.

Made this for Easter breakfast...so delicious!  I used the suggestions of whipping my cream cheese with powdered sugar, but did use the full two packages and didn't feel like it was too much at all.  Only used 10 eggs.  May even decrease to 9 next time.  Definitely a keeper!

I did as someone else suggested and mixed the cream cheese and some powdered sugar together and spread over the bread before cutting it into pieces.  I don't like big globs of cream cheese.  The sauce is great, kind of resembles pie filling, you could use as much or as little as you like

WOW REALLY REALLY GOOD..... I cut the cream cheese in half and whipped it with milk, sugar, and vanilla... I also doubled the blueberries and the sauce. I poured about 3/4 of the sauce over the french toast and the other 1/4 I set on the table.... great breakfast bake

I made this yesterday and am rating a 4 star due to the fact I had to go with some of the other comments...which I'm glad I did, the creamcheese definetly needs sweetning up, I did a 1/4 of confectioner sugar which I think could of used 1/2c more. I also used 10 eggs and then followed the recipe from there. The sauce needed thinning so I added water as needed to my desired consistency. Over all, this is a keeper.!

I had to comment on what I thought would have been a much better outcome.  I didn't believe a few of the reviews commenting that the cream cheese was, well...weird.  And that it was.  I didn't go well with the recipe- which seems strange- I thought for sure it would.  I always follow a recipe to the tee to be able to give a fair and accurate review-not based on my changes.  Here's what will-in my opinion- make this better.  First and most important- the cream cheese needs to be made into a filling like substance.  Almost like cheesecake- with some sugar, vanilla, etc.  Use a brick and a half of cream cheese- not two.  Way too much.  What I did was to almost melt the cream cheese so that I could spoon it over the bread- smoothed over nicely that way.  The syrup- not sure what to do about that.  I almost went into a sugar coma when I tasted it- but when we mixed it with regular syrup- very yummy.  I think maybe some cinnamon in the egg mixture, too-to give it a more french toast taste.  I really thought this was going to be soooo much better.  Read all the reviews before you make it- and take a little from all of them.  You should end up with a better product.

I love this recipe!!  I have made it several times for a charity brunch serving 120 people..  I have tweaked it over the years.. I only use one package of cream cheese mixed with 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar and a splash of milk to thin it out.. Whip this up and put it in an icing bag or baggie with one corner cut out.. This allows the cream cheees to spread more evenly..  I cut back on the eggs to 8 or 10 and double the blueberries..I always add extra vanilla because I love vanilla!! 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon...  Here's the key thing... Always use real Maple Syrup!!  Anything else would be a tragedy!!  Also, I use Texas Toast and/or brioche...

This is a very good recipe. As is, it needs some tweaks to fit our family. I doubled the blueberries on both the toast itself and in the syrup. Since we didn't like biting into hunks of cream cheese, on the second try I beat 12oz of cream cheese with sugar to taste, a bit of vanilla extract, and a splash of heavy cream until smooth. Instead of fighting to spread it, I loaded the cream cheese mixture into a pastry bag and evenly piped it on top of the first layer of bread. I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture and substituted evaporated milk for regular milk. The final tweak was I added a quarter cup of lemon juice to the syrup. This would be good with any fruit and next time I am trying it with peaches.

My kids love this and have made it 3 times now!!!!  I read a lot of the reviews.  Only things I changed was the way I did the cream cheese (it was hard to spread).  I listened to another review that said they added milk, confection sugar, and lemon juice.  Beat it in the mixer and was able to pour and spread it on the bread evenly and with little effort.  Thank you for making Sunday mornings in this house great!!!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The 1st time I took some advice from reviews, used only 10 eggs, and just clumped the whipped cream cheese mixture (adding vanilla extract, powdered sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg) over the first layer of bread because it was really hard to spread and then put blueberries all around. It turned out delicious but didn't have "layers" like the picture. The 2nd time I made it, I made much bigger bread cubes (I used an entire whole wheat ciabatta loaf and last time I just used leftover bread that I had laying around) and I found that the bigger cubes (like 1 1/2 to 2 inches) made it much easier to spread the same whipped cream cheese mixture. Also, don't put too much bread on the bottom of your pan. I found that if I put too much bread in one spot (i.e. a cube on top of a cube), it was impossible to spread and it stuck to my spatula! I just threw the "excess" bread cubes that were hiding underneath in the reserved bread for the top of the casserole and kept on spreading to link all the bread and cream cheese layers. Still used the same 10 eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract, dash of salt, 2 cups milk, and 1/2 cup maple syrup mixture as last time. I pressed it down and topped it with cinnamon and brown sugar. When I baked it, it came out perfectly just like the picture! Tasted just as good as I remembered it!

We just tried this, it is awesome just the way it is.  I did tweak it a bit though so here are my suggestions; the cream cheese really didn't distribute so next time I will cream it with the eggs as previously suggested.  If you want the decadent feel of it just use ten eggs not 12, we only had ten this time.  We added a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Did a tablespoon of vanilla, buttermilk instead of milk.  For the sauce we only used 1/2 a cup of sugar, the fruit is sweet enough. Next time I'm using peaches in the bread egg mix and making a blueberry sauce to top it with.  

I try to add as much nutrient value to the food I make for my family so I made my own loaf of bread from scratch and used it the very same night, no need for it to be day old, I cut most of the crust off, not all.

3 cups white wheat flour
1 cup ground flax seeds
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 packet of yeast
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup milk or buttermilk
1/4 cup oil

bake the bread at 350F until the internal temperature is 190F

Incredibly easy! My favorite version of this recipe is adding raspberries and blackberries along with blueberries. I also use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, xylitol instead of sugar and sugar-free syrup - you can NOT tell the difference.

Broil it for 1.5 minutes and it will get nice and brown. I would use a loaf and a quater of Challah bread. Great Recipe. Easily serves 6 people.

I feel like this recipe has a lot of potential, and with a little tweaking, it could be really wonderful. Maybe if I followed some suggestions left by other reviewers the dish would have been more flavorful. But instead, I followed the directions and measurements exactly and ended up with something I'm not really sure my family will finish eating. I think I'll give this recipe another go and create a mixture of cream cheese and powdered sugar to spread in the center. The best part of this recipe was the blueberry sauce -it was something everyone in my household agreed on. I haven't given up on this recipe yet, so onto round 2!

This recipe is so good with Raspberries! I think high quality maple syrup makes a big difference. It's pretty eggy, so I think I'll try 10 eggs next time.

I really liked this but I am a huge fan of cream cheese in anything so maybe I'm a little biased!  I'm the one who ended up eating the most of this but my husband liked it too.  I took the advice of others and used French bread which I think made it better.  You almost forget that it's a breakfast dish because it tastes more like a dessert!

Excellent breakfast casserole! I got tons of compliments when I made this for my family. I did make a few of the changes mentioned in previous reviews. I used fewer eggs and used french bread. After I cut the french bread into small pieces I baked it at 350 for about 7 minutes to get it crispy and dry. The bread was a great consistency and not too soggy.

Yum! My hubs and I hosted my parents for a pre-Easter brunch. This was one of the items on the menu - and everyone LOVED it (other than my fruit-hating hubby)!!! This was the perfect consistency (i.e. not too "eggy) and is unlike any French toast casserole I've tried before. Although I do not dislike blueberries, if given a choice, I prefer to eat them raw, not cooked. This has certainly changed my opinion on that! I didn't have much time to prepare or read many reviews beforehand, but what I read of CLARRY32's review pretty much summed up what others have said / done. I too used Italian bread, 1 1/2 blocks of (reduced-fat) cream cheese mixed with 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar and only 10 eggs (Egg Beaters - my dad is on a heart-restrictive diet). NOTE: It was quite difficult to "spread" the whipped cream cheese mixture over my bread cubes as CLARRY described. Next time, I'll SLICE half of my bread, layer it on the bottom of my baking dish, spread that with the cream cheese / blueberries and then top with the final layer of bread (cubes). One last note. I thought the amount of blueberry sauce was spot on and even had a bit leftover.... Thanks for sharing, KARAN1946. This is a real gem! :-)

Crustless French bread makes it fluffier. It will disappoint you if you serve it right out of the oven. Let it rest 24 hours for better flavor and a nicer presentation. Serve with a small cup of maple syrup on the side.

I want to plan a brunch just so I can make this again!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but I spread the cream cheese on the bread and then cut into cubes.  It was soft inside--just like French Toast is, but not soggy at all.  It wasn't overly sweet--perfect for breakfast.

Smelled great in oven and was very tasty!  I did double blueberries and used only 1/2 the cream cheese.  Also, I froze and grated the cream cheese over the bread cubes as another reader did.  What a brilliant tip - THANKS!  Will make again - THANK FOR SHARING!

We loved it but found that there was too much cream cheese, we cut the cream
cheese down to one rather than two packages.  Because some of my family doesn't 
like blueberries, we substituted blueberries with strawberries, which was great.  Overall 
we would definately make this again.

I've been intending to make this for ages. Well, I've had a boat-load of company so now was the time to feed my crowd some yummy-ness for breakfast. Why-Oh-Why did I wait so long? This is scrumptious. Of course, I had to eat 4 lactaids, but it was worth it! Holy Cow! Rich and decadent, I served with homemade BB Syrup from this site. I made it per the directions except I used Challah bread (also from this site)I had made for the PNW Round Up, but forgot to serve. It's the perfect bread for this recipe.

This turned out pretty gross. Made it for brunch, and was embarrassed with the results. Was dry, but edible. A few differences probably would have made a world of difference: 1) more blueberries; 2) blending the cream cheese instead of just cutting big chunks; 3) adding more liquid as the french toast was cooking, kind of like a bread pudding.

I Also made this a second time, learning from the first. This wants to be a decadent dessert rather than a main dish. don't be afraid of sugar and DO NOT be afraid to add cinnamon. I also used Hawaiian bread the second time and I used the Blueberry Cream cheese spread and made "sandwiches" which I then cubed. I used 16 Oz of cream Cheese! and then I doubled the amount of fresh and frozen blueberries! I like to use both for tartness and for sweetness. I Used half and half in the egg mixture instead of milk ,and you definitely need to let it sit overnight. I then drizzled melted butter over it before baking and I sprinkled sugar over the top giving it a crispy crunchy bite against the soft gooey inside. In The syrup, I added double the fresh blueberries too. It came out fantastic!!!!!!! Everyone was Amazed at how delicious it was. I served it with fresh whipped cream. t was perfect. The  blueberry cream cheese spread throughout was divine. it really helped to spread it onto the bread before cubing. I happened to have a few Blueberry muffins (the small ones) so I threw those crumbled up in there too. it truly was a decadent dessert! my Husband said it was the best dessert He'd ever eaten. And he's very fussy
Oh and blend the cream and eggs in the blender so they're really fluffy, I also added some sugar , vanilla, and cinnamon to the egg mixture, it really made it much more flavorful than the original recipe.

I loved it! I put it in 2 8 x 8 pans and froze one so I can take it out and reheat it for company. It was hard not to eat that one too! I put all the liquid ingredients in the blender, including the softened cream cheese. I just poured it over the bread mixture. I used a lot more blueberries; 1 cup didn't seem much. The frozen blueberries came in a 2 1/2 cup package so I used all of them. It seemed to be the right amount.
I also used a mixture of different types of bread; whatever I had around such as bagels, croissants or plain white loaf bread.

WOW... There are only two of us, so making a half batch was perfect!.  I did spread the cream cheese on the bread.  I did put in about 1/8c powdered sugar in the the cream cheese.  I allowed the cream cheese to sit til at room temp.  Makes it much easier to spread.  I did double the sauce!!! (if cutting recipe in half, then use original amonts of remaining ingredients)  ALSO I used blueberries, blackberries and raspberries!! YUMMMMYY!  Highly recommend and I look forward to trying other fruit such as peaches or cranberries!!

I contemplated giving this only 3 stars, as the taste was not as great as I expected, but it is a great recipe idea.  I used a baguette, which was a great suggestion to not get a soggy mess.  I only used 1 pk cream cheese as others suggested (and thinned it out with milk).  I added more blueberries than called for, as 1 cup didn't fully cover the bread and I thought one must have blueberry in every bite! I sprinkled the layers of bread with cinnamon as others suggested, but it wasn't enough, next time I'd add more.  I could not taste the maple syrup at all, which would have been great.  Maybe I'll increase that next time, as I also thought this could be a little sweeter, even though I'm not a super-sweet eater.  The blueberry sauce was a bit off... I think it was too much cornstarch, it was so thick, it got globby.  I will try this again, but I need to add more flavor to it!

This is one of the best dishes ever. To make the cream cheese incorparation easier, after slicing the bread, I just spread the cream cheese on top then tore into pieces. Delicious!!!

I love this recipe. I have made it a few different way, using whatever fruit is in season. I have cut the eggs to 9 with the same amount of liquid with no change in the results. To answer a couple questions, i have tried it without the cream cheese and it's still good..not AS GOOD because it gives it the richness but seems ok to do. In our area we have available what's called Texas French Toast which is thickly sliced. I have had the bakery slice bread thicker for me if i can't find the texas toast because I found that regular bread was just not thick enough. Hope this helps. Happy Mothers Day....worth the calories for sure!

This is the best breakfast dish to have with guest or taking out. My mother loved this so much she turned it into a desert! I can't understand why anyone would give this anything other than 5 stars! I have taken this to morning events, served it to guest and I have never gotten one negative comment. If I am going somewhere I get asked to bring it and for the recipe. I would make this once a week at our house if I didn't mind gaining weight, it's not for a dieter! This gets 10 yums in my yummy book! 
I usully make double the sauce, pour 1/2 on top and the other 1/2 on the side.

It was ok. But the cream cheese didn't soften up as I thought. Next time I will try a "whipped" cream cheeze and swirl trough, not in chucks, as recipe suggests.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful, everyone I made it for loved it! The only thing I will do different next time is use a little less egg and cut the cream cheese into slightly smaller cubes. Great recipe, thank!!

awesome. The best part is you make it the night before. I use french bread in about a 1/2 inch dice. Add an extra egg and 1/2 cup more milk too. I substituted a cup of diced apples and a couple good dashes of cinnamon since blueberries aren't on sale right now. Then I just served with regular maple syrup. However, I tracked this recipe down after a friend made it at a brunch  - as written with the blueberries and blueberry syrup and it's SO good. It's really a good foundation to be creative with. I may even venture to try banana and walnuts in the future... :) UPDATE: i just made it with blueberries this morning and it was delicious. However, I'd recommend only using half the amount of cream cheese called for (at the most!). And I'd recommend the blueberry syrup too!

I followed the directions, as well as the suggestions in other reviews to use about double the amount of blueberries. The end result was that the french toast casserole part was bland, unsweet, and had too much egg flavor. The flavors of blueberries and egg just didn't go together. The cream cheese added some tangy flavor but it was just overall really, really, bad. The blueberry syrup/topping was the best part. I wish the casserole part was sweeter, or that it could taste like blueberry french toast instead of just bland, unsweetened blueberries and eggs.

This was really good!  My only thing was the sauce - it was really thick and very sweet.  I think next time I will cut back on the sugar and cornstarch and see if that helps.  I did what other reviewers suggested and mix the cream cheese with some powdered sugar and I think it really needed that extra flavor.

I am a huge fan of baked french toast/bread pudding recipes, but I didn't Love this one.  I have a lot of blueberries to use, so I may try this one again this weekend, but make the following change.  I will make a cream cheese filling, adding a little sugar and vanilla to the cream cheese, and then spread it onto the bread before cubing.  I didn't like the chunks of cream cheese left after baking.  I also opted not to make the sauce and instead sprinkled with a few fresh blueberries, some whipped cream and just a tiny drizzle of maple syrup.  Everyone else must have enjoyed it because the pan is gone.  Will definitely try again - Thanks!

This was incredible.  I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups as these kinds of dishes never seem to get cooked completely in the center & my family won't eat it.  Also added some cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture.  It was fantastic.

I used Italian bread. I used 16 oz of whipped cream cheese and smeared it on the bread. I also added two cups of the blueberries to the casserole instead of 1. If I could do it over again I would have made twice the amount of blueberry sauce. I didn't pour the blueberry sauce on the casserole because I was worried the left overs would get soggy. So we just poured the blueberry sauce over our personal portions.

I thought this was great! I forgot to make it the night before though, and quickly put it together in the morning. I let it sit for about 30 minutes before placing in the oven and it tasted great! I don't know how much better it could have been if I had done it overnight. Also, I used rasberry syrup I had on hand instead of making the blueberry syrup. That was a great compliment to the dish.

I have made this for years. I use 1 1/2 loaves of French bread, cubed. A bit more substance than regular bread slices. Make certain you "squish" the bread cubes down in to the pan and egg mixture. I cover with plastic wrap then cover with foil. Remove before baking, but bake covered with foil the first. Alternatively, grease the foil so it does not stick to bread mixture.  If you use frozen berries, drain them well or it will be soggy.   Wonderful for a special breakfast. Serve with bacon, sausage and fresh fruit.

Read all the reviews and suggestions and the result was perfection! I used day old challah, and froze then grated the cream cheese.  Also doubled the blueberries for the casserole and sauce. Everyone raved. Great for special occasion brunch.

The blueberry sauce that you pour over the French toast was amazing! However, the French toast itself was just ok. I found that the cream cheese didn't  melt the way I had hoped that it would. Maybe cutting it into smaller pieces may help with this issue.

I've made this several times and it's always a HUGE hit.  I've done the exact recipe and I've tried it with modifications.  The biggest change I  make is to only use one 8 oz. block of cream cheese otherwise it's too much.  Everyone in my family and at the office loves this recipe.  It's a keeper!

I made this for Mother's Day yesterday and it was delicious.  I took the other reveiwers suggestions and did the following:  Used Challah bread and cubed it.  I doubled up on the blueberries.  I also used 10oz of cream cheese with 1/4 cup powdered sugar and a splash of milk and mixed with a hand mixer so it spread better.  And sprinkled each layer with fresh nutmeg and cinnamon.  I was afraid to use the blueberry sauce but it isn't too sweet.  It makes the dish complete.  This is a keeper.

I used thick-cut white bread (worked really well!) and a mix of half fresh and half frozen blueberries. It turned out really yummy!  I also used the entire amount of cream cheese and double the amount of blueberries (both inside and on top, in the syrup).  Next time I plan to mix/whip the powdered sugar into the cream cheese first, as others have suggested. The cheese was too cheesy, too savory, for a French toast dish.

I did run into the problem of my dish not being fully cooked in the middle. Not sure what happened, as I put it in for an additional 10 minutes, too.

I made this for a women's bible study and awed everyone ... even myself when I tasted it!  This is unbelievably yummy and delicious.  Everyone who tried it raved about it and thankfully I had brought a copy of the recipe because a number of women asked for it.  I personally wouldn't change a thing because I loved every bite and so did everyone else.  I do, however, like someone's suggestion to use cinnamon raisin swirl bread.  It must have been decadent.

This was a great recipe. My only caution is that it is really rich with all of the cream cheese.  Next time I might take the cream cheese down a bit.  I also added allspice and cinnamon  to the egg mix.  My family loved it.

I made this exactly as written and loved it! I would give it 5 stars, but my husband felt it was just okay ("I didn't DISLIKE it ..."). I think he was expecting French Toast as he is used to it. I made the full recipe, and doubled the sauce, so I'll be freezing it in individual portions. Next time (if I do make it again) I would probably just mix up the ingredients in a big bowl and pour them already combined into the baking dish. Much simpler than the layering, and I think it would work just as well. Also, be sure to grease your pan VERY well. I did, and it still stuck to the bottom. Would probably use parchment next time ...

For a much healthier yet very tasty sauce try the blueberry sauce recipe from the recipe "Blueberry Waffles with Fast Blueberry Sauce" from this site. You need 1 1/2 C blueberries (I use 2), 1/2 C orange juice (divided), 3 Tbs honey, and 1 Tbs cornstarch. To prepare the sauce, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix the blueberries, honey and 1/4 cup orange juice. Bring to a boil. Mix remaining orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl, and stir into the blueberry mixture. Stir constantly until thickened. Serve warm over your french toast. You can also make this the day before and just reheat it for use in the morning.

This recipe was excellent--plenty of moisture after baking, and the blueberry sauce you make at the end is delicious. I used frozen blueberries for both the bake and the sauce and it turned out perfectly.

made this exactly as written for my mom's birthday brunch.  she loved it.  the blueberry syrup was to die for.  i found it to be heavy on the cream cheese, but i am not generally a fan of cream cheese (unless it's laden with sugar atop brownies...)  will definitely make this again for special occasion breakfasts!

I made this according to the recipe and it was just ok. My husband and I had something similar but absolutely amazing on our honeymoon at a bed and breakfast on Victoria Island. We all agreed that without the bluberry "compote" this version would be a waste of time-very bland. Next time, I will make the following changes: mix powdered sugar into the cream cheese and either spread or dollup over the bread; double the blueberries in the mix; double the syrup and add a little lemon juice to it.

Like alot of others have said with 12 eggs poured over top and then sitting overnight makes for a very soggy egg bottom. I'm sure the recipe has promise if altered a little. I will probably try again but with only dipping the bread in the egg mixture and not making overnight for it to get soggy hopefully that will make it better. The topping layer of bread with the blueberry sauce was really go. Disappointing if made by the recipe...

OH MY! WAY too sweet for my liking.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and was still WAY too much.  I think I would prefer mine with the blueberries just heated up- maybe a sprinkle of sugar.   I also blended the cream cheese with a little milk as others suggested and cut the eggs back to 10- still thought it was kind of eggy- probably depends on the amount of bread used- i used an entire loaf of Italian

Awesome.  Served it for a business breakfast this morning and it was a great hit.  One of the men actually asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  This is definitely a "keeper" recipe.

Not horrible but I was expecting more flavor. I didn't think the flavors meshed together to well. I also should have taken others advice about mixing the cream cheese with a little powdered sugar. I have had blueberry french toast bake before at a breakfast and really liked it but I don't know what recipe they used. This one tasted different to me. Maybe the powdered sugar would have made all the difference??? Also, I think it may taste better when it is room temp and not straight from the oven like I had it.

I so wish this one would have worked out, but it didn't. The sauce was good, however, the french toast just wouldn't bake. I did everything exactly as instructed, but it was a raw mess. I cooked for an extra 2 hours and it still was raw. What a waste of ingredients.

I didn't like it-tasted way too much like a bread pudding. Both my parents really liked it. So I averaged our two ratings and got a 3. I followed the exact recipe except I did soften and whip the cream cheese and then "butter" the bread with it before cubing it to evenly distribute the cream cheese.

I previously made this recipe exactly as is and LOVED it. However my 4 year old isn't a huge fan of blueberries so I decided to switch it up this morning. 
I used:
Whole loaf of challah bread
2 pkgs of cream cheese
1 jar of yellow plum jam
10 strawberries chopped
10 eggs
splash of vanilla
spalsh of maple syrup
3/4 cup sugar

I put the bread in the bottom of a 9x13 clear backing dish. I then mixed the cream cheese and jam together and microwaved it in 30 second intervals until it was soft enough to blend. Stiring in between each interval. I put the strawberries over the bread and then spread the cream cheese/jam mixture over the strawberries and mixed it all together in the pan. Then I combined the rest of the ingredients and poured it over the top of the bread mixture. I then put it in the fridge overnight. It was awesome! I put extra syrup on the side for my family to use if they wanted it but it didn't really need any.

Made this for an office breakfast and it was a huge hit!  I only used one package of cream cheese and whipped it with milk and a little powdered sugar.  I followed other suggestions and used french bread and didn't use the entire milk mixture.

This was a hit at our prayer breakfast this Sunday. I only made a few changes. I divided into 2 containers so it would serve more and substituted blue berry syrup for the maple syrup. Will be serving again and had many requests for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make!  It was warm and gooey with a thin crispy crust on top with a really nice texture.  The only reason I rated this recipe with 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found the blueberry syrup to be a little too sweet.  Next time I will use less sugar.  I also think it would be very good with other fruits as well.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for a church brunch and it came out fantastic. I did follow a lot of reviewer advice - I only used 8oz. of cream cheese, whipped with a little milk and powdered sugar - that was plenty of cream cheese. I used day old challah bread, doubled the blueberries in the dish and sauce, cut back a little on the cornstarch (many said sauce was too thick, used only 10 eggs, and sprinkled everything with cinnamon - yum!! I also took this out of the fridge an hour before baking to warm up a little. Will definitely make again! Hubby and 3 year old loved it and was asked for the recipe!

This was MOST EXCELLENT!  Used a good cinnamon swirl bread...the sauce was absolutely the crowning touch...everyone loved it!  Will definitely make it again and again...just be sure that you use a large baking dish.  This will ensure that ingredients are spread out enough for uniform baking...no soggy middle!

I made this for my sister and nephew's birthday brunch. It was delicious everyone went back for more. I will make this again for family gatherings.
I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 10 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. I also sprinkled with cinnamon and confectionary sugar on each layer. I used a nice loaf of italian bread from trader joe's. Yum!!!

Excellent! I did follow Tricia Jaeger's advice and use only 1 block of cream cheese, 10 eggs and 1-1/2 cups milk (I used light cream cheese and fat free milk). Also, to the egg mixture, I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. IMO, the blueberry sauce is a definate MUST! The french toast on it's own is not very sweet, so the sweetness of the sauce is needed, and reallly compliments the french toast nicely. I served the sauce on the side instead of pouring it over the entire thing. Hubby said I could make this anytime...and I will~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This dish is DIVINE.  YUM!!!  I made this for my hubby and I on Christmas morning.  Prepared it on Christmas Eve when I was exhausted and it was so quick and easy!  Took 5 minutes...then just popped it in the oven while opening presents in the morning.  This will definitely be one of my dishes for many years to come.

Oh my stars this is yummy.  Made it for Christmas morning and it has earned all the rave reviews!  I bought a loaf of Texas toast and used that because it is thicker.  It took longer than 10 minutes for all the blueberries to burst, but it was well worth the wait.  This might be our new traditional Christmas morning meal!

Made it exactly as the recipe is written. If it weren't for the cream cheese this would have been in the trash. The sauce is way too sweet with a cup of sugar and way too thick with 2 T cornstarch. Tasted like a bad breakfast from IHOP. I won't be making this again.  No one liked it.

Made this for a family breakfast and everyone loved it! I would recommend cutting the cream cheese into smaller pieces as they didn't melt and blend as I expected.

I was never a fan of bread pudding, but this makes a fantastic one!  I liked it much better cold as a dessert.  I had an 8oz. mixed berry whipped cream cheese and a plain 12oz. one to use up.  As someone else suggested, I mixed the cream cheese right in with the milk mixture,and used boysenberry syrup rather than maple.  I dusted it with powdered sugar for a bit more sweetness, then poured the blueberry sauce straight over the baked casserole and no one even reached for the extra syrup.  You might mistake the very moist bread as not being done but if you refrigerate it and serve it cold, you will see that it is perfect.  Good either way, but I'm filing it under desserts.  Thanks!

This was delish!!! One child said she thought the cream was sour(meaning the cream cheese) I agreed but I needed to put more blueberry sauce on her's and it was divine. Mine was so soft, moist and flavorful. I did take a suggestion from another member to prep the morning of and waited like 30 minutes or so before putting it in the oven. I used whole frozen blueberries and ran them under water. I will so make this again. I we love loved the blueberry sauce.

Made this for our monthly birthday celebration at work.  I always get a little nervous when cooking for this crowd because they are very critical.  Everyone loved it and I needed to make 15 copies of this recipe for all the requests I received.

This was a great new breakfast dish to make, especially since you can prep it the night before and just toss it in the oven when you wake up! I only had cherry pie filling at home, and only a little cream cheese left, so I swapped cherry for the bluberries, and dotted butter and what little cream cheese had throughout.  I say five stars for the great flavor and just right amount of each ingredients! I did notice that when it bakes covered, the steam from the eggs creates a slight pool of water in the bottom of the pan, and doesn't look too appetizing when you dish it up to serve. I'll try venting it next time and maybe a few extra dry bread cubes in the bottom. Can't wait too try the blueberry!

I have to say that this wasn't the easiest dish I've ever made, but it was good.  Not wonderful, but good.  We had it Saturday morning -- one person didn't like it at all and four others liked it okay.  I would make it again for maybe a girly luncheon or brunch, like a bridal brunch or something.  *** I followed some other reviewers suggestions and I found these things helpful. -- Don't cut back on the sugar in the syrup!  It's perfect like it is.  In fact, I think I enjoyed the syrup more than the french toast.  It's a good contrast to the eggs in the casserole.  I did add about a half of a cup extra of blueberries to the syrup and a couple of squirts of lemon juice, which may of offset the sweetness that others didn't like. -- I used some cinnamon swirl bread, which helped with the flavor, and I found it easier to pinch the bread in 1 in. pieces and cream cheese in 1/2 in. pieces rather than cut it. -- I spread one brick of cream cheese on the bread, but I really thought that was too difficult.  I think it would be best to just pinch it all.  Some reviewers worried about the cream cheese, but I think the richness is a good thing. -- Definitely add a little more cinnamon or PCs "Cinnamon Plus."

This turned out very well and very yummy! I did adjust the recipe a little based on other reviews. I only used 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese, which was a perfect amount. I also mixed the cream cheese with powdered sugar and instead of spreading it I dropped cookie-dough-like dallops over the bread. I used 10 eggs instead of 12, and didn't miss any. I also pressed the bread down into the egg mixture after I poured it on but before I put it in the fridge for the night. I one and a halfed the syrup for extras. I only poured about a cup of it over the french toast bake, and the rest I served on the side. I plan to use the leftover syrup on pancakes!

This is an excellent recipe.  I've made it several times and it is always very delicious.  Some other friuts I've tried are strawberries and raspberries -and I must say raspberries were the best! (if you don't mind the seeds)  This dish also heats up well in the mircowave for a next day treat, that is if you have any left!!

My family really enjoyed this, especially my 1 year old. I cut the recipe in half and it made plenty for the 3 of us plus left overs. It was even great reheated. I may decrease the cream cheese a little, although my husband said it was perfect. We used wheat bread.

I have been making this a lot in the last couple years, so I figure I better let people know how delicious this is! I use italian bread with this. Substitute Comstock brand blueberry or apple pie filling instead of fresh, both are wonderful in this. I also add a sprinkling of cinnamon. I don't even bother with the blueberry sauce, I just serve it  with  Mrs. Butterworth's syrup or butter flavor syrup. I get so many requests for this, we never have a special breakfast or brunch without it! I have made smaller versions just for ourselves. Outstanding! Thanks Karan, our breakfast/brunches got even better with this one!

I made this the day after Christmas to rave reviews.  The only regret I had was that I hadn't made two batches.  Oh, I also adjusted for fat and calories by using egg whites and no-fat cream cheese.  Didn't miss the calories at all.

I found this recipe while looking for a way to use up extra fresh blueberries.  What an impressive and unique recipe!!  I used whole-grain wheat bread.  I agree that you can cut back on the cream cheese and be fine.  The blueberry sauce would be nice to pour over vanilla ice cream, if you make extra.  This recipe is sure to get smiles from guests.

This was great -- so easy to put together the night before and pop in the oven in the morning. I wasn't pleased with the sauce, however -- much too sweet and a bit flavourless. I added more blueberries and the zest of a lemon and fresh squeezed lemon juice. I'll definitely make this again! Note: doesn't reheat well, so be sure so finish it all!

I served this for Christmas morning breakfast, it was delicious and so easy since I prepared it the night before!  It baked while we opened presents.  The leftovers are even better warmed up in the microwave with the sauce poured over while it reheats.  Next time I'll try whipping the cream cheese into a spread instead of placing chunks over the bread.

This is a 5 star recipe as is, although I did spread sweetened cream cheese on the bread before cutting it into cubes.  The second time I made it, I used Italian bread (better) added about 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the blueberry layer and added a streusel topping and served it with blueberry syrup and whipped cream.  Next time, I am going to try it with sliced, frozen strawberries.

For my first time making it, I stuck mostly to the basic recipe. I used day old country bread from the bakery. It had a thicker, more tougher crust that proved to be appealing to the eye and taste when completed. I used almond milk, unsweetened, one regular cream cheese, one light. I broke the cream cheese into tinier pieces to spread it out over the bread. The result was delicious. Next time I will make these adjustments, I'll soften and beat the cream cheese and use only12 oz. total. I will add lemon juice, cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg. I think it will enhance the overnight flavors. I will use less sugar in the sauce but definitely more blueberries. I ran out of sauce and needed to make more. I will serve with peppered bacon, as I meant to do this time. This is bed and breakfast ready for any special occasion! I WILL make this again.

I made this recipe for a breakfast tailgate party in a round chafing dish with sterno underneath.  It was a huge hit.  I made 1 1/2 recipes to fill the chafing dish.  I added some confectioner's sugar to the cream cheese as others recommended.  Since I was serving this out of the back of my car I simplified the sauce for the top.  I used two cans of blueberry pie filling, one bottle of blueberry syrup, and a cup and a half of fresh blueberries.  I heated this up on our camp stove.  It was amazing and so much simpler than going the cornstarch route.  Wow.  This recipe is now in our tailgate hall of fame!

I love this recipe and have made it numerous times. Like many others I use a loaf of French bread, use 8 oz cream cheese which I blend with about 1/4 cup milk and 1 tbl spoon maple syrup. Cube the bread,  spread half the bread in bottom of  cake pan, put the cream cheese mix in plastic bag, clip one corner and spread this over the bread. Sprinkle with cinnamon, spread the blueberries, top with remaining bread, then drench each piece of bread with the egg mix.  If you use sandwich bread, it does not hold up.  The suggested amount of cream cheese is way too powerful, if you don't dilute and mix with a small amount of syrup it will not melt and you are left with a small glob of warm cream cheese, which is not what you want.  The cinnamon boosts the flavor.  If you do not drench each piece of bread, it will not soak up the egg mix and just taste like toast.  This is an awesome recipe.  I encourage everyone to make this delicious recipe.

I have made this twice now.
I use challah bread instead of white bread.
Also, I switched out a combo of creme fraiche and mascarpone dollops instead of cream cheese.

THe sauce was too sweet, so I made a sauce from  another source. 
2 pts blueberries, 2 tbs red wine vinegar. 1/4 tsp cinnamon/nutmeg; 1/8 tsp ground mace/cloves. Cook on stove top til bubbling, then simmer low to med for !10 minutes. Can be made ahead.

I made this for brunch. An excellent bread pudding type recipe.  I would definitely , and I did, add cinnamon and sugar on top of EACH layer...Otherwise, it would be way too bland.  I also added 1T of lemon juice and a lemon slice-rind and all  to the blueberry syrup.  A double batch of the syrup is a must. I used grated  frozen cream cheese block that turned into snow cheese.... which distributed easily. I would do that again, but I would also add chunks of cream cheese for effect. A wonderful recipe ! Thanks for sharing it ! FYI, I used Italian bread.

With a little tweaking this was amazing. I'm giving it 3 stars b/c when I made it the first time, following the original recipe, it was just okay. 

The second time around I ended up cutting the cream cheese by half (1-8oz pkg) and blending it with a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, a tbsp of lemon zest, and 1/4 cup lemon juice until it was smooth and creamy. I then spread it over the first layer of bread cubes before adding the blueberries. I also used day old Italian loaf instead of plain white bread and cut the eggs to only 8. 

With those adjustments it was a winner and has quickly become a family favorite. :)

Awesome! Everyone who tried it loved it, even the one who said "it's not really my thing, but I'll try it". I prefer making french toast with croissants (from the grocery store bakery), so I used croissants instead of sliced bread. This is a fabulous treat for family or a special occasion, and I can't wait to make it again!

I think 2 cups blueberries are needed! I will actually rate it with 5 stars. I made this last weekend for my in-laws and parents. It was a hit!  Unfortunately, I thought I only needed 1 pkg of cream chs so that's all I purchased and used.  Next time I want to make it with peaches, then other fruit. Also, I'm going to add cinnamon and will definitely cream the cream cheese. Excited to make it again!!

Great recipe, I doubled the amount of blueberries in both the sauce and the overnight portion.   WHEN I make this again I'll probably use a 3rd less sugar in the sauce, but that's a taste preference.  Would definitely recommend this recipe.  I used a loaf of Italian bread from Wegman's and let it sit for a day and a half.

This was a very tasty recipe. To make it even easier i mixed the cream cheese, sugar , vanilla with some lemon juice together in a mixer. Put it into a zip lock bag. Cut the tip off and piped it onto the bread mixture.
I also added lemon juice to the Blueberry sauce. I also added cinnamon to the milk/egg mixture.
Served with whipped cream as well.  YUM!

Delicious! Took others' suggestions to whip cream cheese with 1/4 cup powdered sugar & spread it on bread. Doubled syrup, had leftovers, but 1 batch would have been too little. Loved how easy it was! Will make again!

2016, Made it again , this time with sourdough bread, my best one so far , served with very good quality maple syrup . Fresh blueberries , I add more than what the recipe calls. 
First review: Best casserole ever, this is a once a year, Christmas breakfast signature dish for our house. We use French bread loaf , organic eggs, and frozen blueberries that we collected during the season. 
This year I did not have enough blueberries then my husband made a strawberry sauce. Thank you  Karan1946!!

I have now made this breakfast casserole SIX years in a row for our Christmas breakfast.  I have followed the recipe as written except that I have made it with Italian bread, including the crust, instead of sliced white bread, based on the advice of other reviewers.  I also sprinkled about 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar over the cream cheese cubes (all 16 ounces!) and doubled the syrup, which I put in a small pitcher for self-serve.  Each time I've made this I did not find it necessary to "spread" the cream cheese.  I just made sure the cream cheese cubes were small and then pressed the casserole firmly after topping with the second layer of cubed bread so that the cheese would melt into it as it baked.  I've used frozen blueberries the and fresh blueberries with little or no variation in taste or texture.  This casserole is REALLY delicious, very easy and saves so much time since the preparations can be done the day before!  Be sure you bring it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before baking to take the chill off and allow it to cook thoroughly.  I serve this casserole with good quality (i.e., meaty) bacon.  A perfect pairing!  I will continue to make it for holidays and other special occasions because it always disappears among rave reviews.

I made this recipe for a Work related Secret Santa Breakfast.
Everyone really liked it. I used regular white bread and cut off the crusts. Next time I will do as many have recommended and use french bread. I also replaced the cream cheese with  combo of creme fraiche and mascarpone. Like others, I added cinnamon also.

Next time, I will use less sugar and will not use corn starch for the blue berry sauce. I added some balsamic vinegar to the sauce to counter balance   the other flavors. I will try lemon next time. Overall, a crowd pleaser, relatively easy to make and works well with the ahead of time prep.

I made this recipe one Mothers' Day for the extended family.  I made one mistake.  I didn't see the division between the main recipe and the sauce.  I mixed it all together, put it in the refrig. overnight, and baked it in the morning.  It was very sweet, but the grandchildren loved it.  I will try it again sometime.

I loved it because I did what many of the reviewers suggested--used only 9 eggs (10 would have been fine), French bread cut into cubes and 'toasted; in the oven because I am always doing things like this at the last minute, 10-12 ounces of cream cheese mixed with 1/3 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 cup milk, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk/egg mixture, lemon juice to the syrup and used a 16 ounce bag of frozen blueberries.  I put half the berries in the casserole, half in the syrup.  It is now my winter dessert recipe.

This was good. I took advice that I should not have taken which I now regret. Because I used a nice crusty bread I should have used all dozen eggs as it was a little dry. I am a cream cheese lover and should have used  the entire amount. I did use double the blueberries which I was grateful for.  So I will make it again.

I thought this recipe was good. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little more tart to balance the sweet. Especially in the syrup. I definitely recommend using a different syrup recipe that keeps a little more of the original blueberry flavor. Very good otherwise.

I didn't really enjoy this recipe (the texture threw me off I think), but everyone at my house did (including a very picky boy) so I'm giving it four stars. First off the cook time is low; it took about an hour and a half to cook and I left it out for forty minutes beforehand. Next time I think I will use two loaves of French Bread instead of one. I followed the advice of others and added cinnamon to the bread and syrup.

I do have to say that I loved the blueberry topping. I ended up using four cups of blueberries total, two for the bread and two for the topping. Also followed others advice and added a little bit of lemon juice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. 

All and all I'd be willing try it again with some changes. Its a bit of an experiment making it for the first time.

This was amazing!  We did cut the cream cheese in half and only used ten eggs but we probably could have gotten away with eight.

I purchased blueberries on sale and looked at AR for a breakfast casserole.  I chose this one and it was a huge hit with my family. I halved the recipe since only 3 were eating it.  I did however, use a full cup of blueberries in the bread and that was perfect.  I had thick sliced cinnamon swirl bread that worked out nicely.  I added a touch of lemon juice and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the sauce for a little more flavor.  Next time I make this I want the sauce to be more syrupy so I will half the corn starch.  Thank you for a decadent French toast that will be make over and over.

This recipe is appealing to the eye - but not the taste buds. To my family - it tasted bland & it seemed there was too much bread.  I was hoping the edges would have a crispy texture - like French Toast - it did not.  Just soft & doughy.  I can't quite put my finger on what it needs, but it's definitely lacking some pizazz. I won't waste my time on this one again.

Double the blueberries, soften cream cheese and blend with 1/4 cup powdered sugar, then add as a layer (not cubed), use cinnamon swirl bread, double cinnamon. BEST STUFF EVER!

This was really good....I made it for Christmas breakfast and it was devoured! I did as other reviewers had suggested and only used 10 eggs and I used frozen raspberries as my husband is allergic to blueberries. I also spread the cream cheese on the French bread slices (sandwich style) then cubed...no worries about trying to spread the cream cheese :o)

I took the advice of others and used small cubes of cream cheese. I only used one 8 ounce cream cheese and thought that was plenty. Lightly sprinkled powdered sugar over the cream cheese layers. also added zest of one lemon to the syrup. Everyone loved it.

Made this with frozen blueberries, everything else as the recipe said.  Used the Italian bread, as some reviews suggested.  What came out of the oven, it was watery grey on top! Tried cooking longer, with convection until the bread on top was getting a bit too crusty, but still was watery on top.  I then let it'rest' for 15 minutes, with no better results!  The blueberry syrup is very good.  But the next time, I would just make a good french toast, with a hearty bread, and use the syrup on top.

This was very good and very easy to make. Next time I would whip the cream cheese with a little vanilla extract before adding to the bread mixture. Thanks for sharing I will be making again.

wooowww. amazing. this recipe is more than awesome, ive made it for brakfast on sunday and everyone was thrilled. However, I have taken only half of the ingredients , for example instead of 12 eggs only 6, and only 6 sliced bread instead of 12, it  was completly enough for 3 people. each of us has eaten a piece for breakfast and again as a dessert in the afternoon.

Reducing eggs to ten and cream cheese to 1 1/2 oz. is a must. I made it with apples, mixing them generously with cinnamon.

It was awesome the only thing I would change is to add a little extra sweetener to the egg mixture -- maybe a couple tablespoons of sugar or splenda or more syrup. Will definately do it again

I made this recipe for my scrapbooking friends while we were away in a cabin in West Virginia.  Except for my friend who hates eggs (???), we loved it.  It was my first time making this recipe, and I was really pleased.  I followed the recipe as written.  The only change I would make doing it again would be to add a pinch of salt to wake up the eggs.  I have just read some of the reviews, and it seems people are spreading the cream cheese and, perhaps, struggling with that.  I freeze blocks of cream cheese and that makes them easy to cut, cube, grate, etc.  I would only consider cutting the amount of cream cheese if I was trying to make a lighter, less calorie-dense version.  The ladies loved the recipe, and we ate the leftovers the second morning.--They were good too.

Loved it!  It probably would have been amazing without my changes, but this is what I did:
-Used 3-day-old french bread (most of a loaf)
-Used a 2qt 11x7 pan
-Used only 1 block of cream cheese (was perfect amt. for this size pan)
-Used 10 eggs; made sure I really mushed that top layer of bread cubes to get coated in the egg, esp. in the morning before baking
-Sprinkled some cinnamon & sugar and some of Penzey's cake spice on the top mid-baking (it was an after-thought and a good one!)
-Dolloped 2 Tbsp butter over the top out of oven

I didn't make the blueberry sauce b/c I had some leftover from another recipe.  It had lemon and an edge of salt--good!

Served with warmed blueberry sauce and warm maple syrup.  Yummmm!!!!

I made this recipe, with a few tweaks. After reading all of the feedback. The constant issue was with the cream cheese. I cut them into smaller pieces.I added cinnamon to the egg batter and half a teaspoon of almond extract, along with a 1/3 cup of orange juice to the blueberry sauce. perfect!

WOW!!! Reduced servings by 1/2 and substituted lower fat Neufchatel cheese, 2% milk and splenda to reduce fat and sugar calories for a healthier version. The results were outstanding. Will make this again whenever there are fresh blueberries.

My very first review.....I have made this as is and changed to my family's preferences.  Have made blueberry and strawberry, even made it and tried to transport back from vacation in a rented vehicle...not a great idea unless you know it is secure.  Family absolutely loves this and requests it!! Thank you!

Per my Mother's day breakfast request, my husband made this dish for me and it was delicious!!!  You must serve/eat warm and out of the oven.  He used day old buttermilk bread instead of the Italian bread suggested, the first time he made it and recently day old Italian bread, they were both yummy.    He is going to try cherries next time instead of blueberries.  It has now become a favorite dish for us!  Enjoy!

Delicious! I used cinnamon raisin bread. I also substituted egg beaters for 6 off the eggs. But really the dish would have been just as good with less eggs. I also used Truvia/Stevia in the place of sugar for the sauce. My husband's birthday breakfast was a hit!

I was a little worried to try this because I thought it might be weird and it was. If you like a blueberry/bread omelet, you would like this. Sorry! I just didn't get it.

Family loved it.  Used Whole wheat rolls, a little less cream cheese and more blueberries. It was a great Mother's Day breakfast.

This French toast is incredibly amazing. I've made it half a dozen times at least! I do, however, have a few things that I changed after reading all of the reviews on this recipe. They were minor, but important enough to take off a star. 

Instead of using any type of bread, I used thick, stale Italian bread. I also sliced the bread instead of cubing it. That way, it wasn't so mushy. 
I also cut back on the cream cheese. Instead of using 2 8oz. packages, I used 1 10oz. package of lite whipped cream cheese. This was PLENTY. 
I doubled the blueberries, using 4 cups instead of two.
I used 1/2 cup of real maple syrup instead of 1/3 cup.
I used 1 1/2 cups sugar in the blueberry sauce, because it was too tart without the extra sugar. I also added a dash of lemon juice to the sauce.
I sprinkled cinnamon in between each of the layers.

Below are the changed ingredients:

12 slices thick, stale Italian bread (we used fresh that had been out on the counter for a couple hours)
10 oz. whipped cream cheese mixed with 1/2 cup powdered sugar
4 cups blueberries, separated into 2 cups each
12 eggs, beaten in blender
2 cups milk
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 cup maple syrup
(a generous) 1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup water
1 tablespoon butter
Cinnamon
Lemon Juice

I have made an almost identical version of strawberry French toast. Check it out!

I stopped posting reviews due to removals or edits that did not seem accurate however, I had to post something about this recipe.  This is darn near awesome!  The only changes I made was to use Italian bread, thawed frozen blueberries, extra cinnamon and I heated the cream cheese up in the microwave with a little vanilla then poured it on the middle layer of bread.  I did not follow other reviewers by mixing the cream cheese with confectioner's sugar because that is the start of cream cheese frosting and I did not want this to be teeth hurting kind of sweet.  The blueberry sauce is already pretty sweet as it is and pouring it over the bread mixture makes it just perfect.   This could also be called Blueberry Bread Pudding though perhaps not as breakfast friendly.  As a whole, this was super delicious and a huge hit.  Husband loved this and lived on leftovers the whole weekend.  I highly suggest heating the cream cheese up for easy pouring (no need to spread) and make the blueberry sauce as listed because it is really good.  The bread I used was only slightly stale (same day baked) and still turned out fantastic.

Mmmmm...wasn't expecting to like this as much as we did.  My husband is not a huge fan of cream cheese, and I am not a fan of French toast at all!  Made this just as recommended, and it was amazing!  It was so good, soft and sweet on the bottom, and crispy on top, with blueberry sauce drizzled on...mmm...can I say a definite keeper?

This was great.  I've made some good stuff from Allrecipes but holy guacamole, this has to be the best I've made.  It's just complex enough to be interesting but easy enough for even a kitchen newbie plus, you can put a tray of bacon in the oven on the rack below this dish and cook them both at the same time.  This is going to be my daughter's birthday breakfast tradition from now on.  Make this, you'll love it.

It was delicious!! We all loved it.  We had it Easter morning and didn't have to add butter or syrup to it.  I just added cinnamon to the recipe just to give a little more flavor.

This recipe is fantastic! It is my go-to for Christmas, Easter, etc, with guaranteed rave reviews every time. One change I would recommend however is to double the blueberries in the french toast. Another tip- if you are short on time, use store bought blueberry glaze (in your grocery store's produce section) with a handful of fresh blueberries. Delicious!!

Loved this recipe.  I made a few modifications - added cinnamon to the egg mixture and only used 10 eggs, used French bread and plenty of blueberries - at least two cups. Didn't make the blueberry sauce - my family prefer real Canadian maple syrup. This has become a staple for Christmas brunch.  I make it two days ahead and give extra time to come to room temperature before baking.  Leaves time to make the Pavlova and prepare the turkey and makes Christmas morning so much easier.

I made this for overnight houseguests and it was a huge hit. I made some modifications based on notes from others. I cut the cream cheese in half and next time I will cut it in smaller pieces and I sprinkled cinnamon between layers.  I also used an apple raisin loaf from my local Fresh and Easy store. Next time I will also double the syrup recipe! My neighbor is having a housefull of company this week and I will surprise her with this to give her a hand.

It sounded great but there was too much cream cheese.  2 8 oz bricks is too much, it didn't get creamy at all, just stayed in a big lump.  I don't think I will make this again unless I modify it a lot.

I made this for an after-wedding brunch and it was a huge hit! Since we were serving a big crowd, I made enough to fit in a Half-pan with the sterno underneath. I had to keep it in the oven longer than I expected but it was fine since the first crowd came back for it when done. I didn't make the sauce according to the directions, though. I bought blueberry glaze by Marzettis and mixed it with fresh blueberries. It was awesome like that and had a fresh blueberry taste. I'll be making this again! By the way, the original recipe was found in a recipe book I have for Bed and Breakfast recipes.

Great recipe, that can also be made with mixed berries for a different flavor.  The only thing I do differently is I serve the berry syrup/compote on the side instead of pouring it over the top, in case you would like to use maple syrup as well.  A little bit of both is yummy!!  Enjoy!!

It was a Christmas delight!  I did make small changes, I blended 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to the cream cheese and only used 10 eggs per other cooks suggestions.  Next time, I wont add the powdered sugar and make per recipe as it was just a little to sweet for my taste. I bought italian bread from Costco which worked perfectly.  I also doubled the syrup as my family loves extra syrup.  There was a little left over and will use it on ice cream.

Wow.  This is good.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added sugar to the cream cheese...tastes like blueberry cheese danish...in the best way.  Makes a ton.  Definitely for a lot of people.

This is amazing!  Great flavor, great texture, easy to prepare, guests love--what else can I say?  I made the "casserole" part exactly as directed.  The only change I made was to double the sauce, and I'm thrilled I did that, because it is delicious!  Can't do this everyday, because it's more delicious than healthy, but it is blueberry so it's not all bad, right?  Definitely guest worthy!

We love it!  It is in the oven right now. I have made this 3 times so far. I use the thick Texas Toast bread and let it sit out for a few hours to get a little dry. Put the creme cheese in the freezer for 30 to 40 minutes, makes it easier to cut into little cubes. I also use an extra egg and sprinkle cinnamon on top. We don't want the blueberry sauce, so I just add extra blueberries into the toast. Took it to my Dad's house for brunch one time, and they loved it too.

This recipe is excellent! I have made it twice - the first time exactly as the recipe instructs, the second time with raspberries instead of blueberries. We liked it much better with raspberries. With making it the night before, it makes for an easy and relaxing breakfast/brunch the following morning. This will become a family favorite for sure.

Absolutely delicious!  This was wonderful and enjoyed by many of my friends and family!  Did follow a few of the suggested changes by fellow reviewers; I toasted until lightly brown 12 slices of Breadsmiths's french peasant bread, used 1.5 packages of cream cheese with a little over 1/3 cup powdered sugar whipped in, taste as you add and you'll know if you need more. put the cream cheese mixture in ziplock and cut off corner to squeeze, going around perimeter of baking dish then 1 inch in, around again.. so on and so on until gone. Used 9 eggs instead of 12 (perfect) not mushy at all, custardy texture at its finest. used 1pint of blueberries to top.  For Sauce I added 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1cup and that was still a little too much for my taste, but I'm not complaining!!!  Also used 1 pint of berries in sauce.  Bon appetite!

Fantastic brunch recipe. I served it with small sausage patties, turkey bacon and mixed fruit. Split the recipe in half and cooked in a 9x9 dish, serves 4-6 people. As other reviewers already mentioned: doubled blueberries in both places, added more maple syrup (just for a bit more sweetness to combat the cream cheese) and used croissants and Italian bread (with crusts), thanks for the recipe!

I took some advise from previous comments and changed this up just a little.  Here is what I did:

Added 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar to the cream cheese (I did use the full 2 packages of cream cheese)

Used 11 eggs, but next time I'll use only 10

Used about 1.5 cups of blueberries in the casserole

Used 2 cups of blueberries for the syrup and forgot the butter, but it turned out **fabulous**

I drizzled a bit of the syrup on the cooked casserole and saved the rest to use "as needed" per serving.  It does make a LOT, so it would be good for a group.

My husband and I couldn't stop eating it, and even my picky 6 year old daughter liked it.  She said it was even better than blueberry pie!

We have a blueberry farm nearby, so we will most definitely be making this a must make recipe every time we go blueberry picking.

Mine did not turn out tasty at all. Once the bread soaked up the syrup that helped but the cream cheese clumps mixed with the berries just did not sit well on my taste buds. I was preoccupied while making this so it could be my fault. I probably won't make this ever again.

Huge crowd pleaser! Used maple cinnamon bread so I omitted the maple syrup. Mixed the cream cheese with 1/4 cup of powered sugar and some milk as some comments suggested and put in ziploc bag, snipped corner and piped out. So much easier than trying to spread it. Everyone loved it...It was So delicious and so easy!

I make this dish every Easter for a huge neighborhood brunch and egg hunt. The only thing I do differently is substitute fresh raspberries for blueberries.  Got the recipe 15 years ago at a B&B when it was served for breakfast and i's become a staple every year. Thanks for posting so I know where to find it in the event I ever lose my copy of the recipe!

Made this for Christmas brunch and EVERYONE loved it! I particularly like how the syrup is in the egg batter. This coupled with the cornstarch mix makes adding additional syrup unnecessary. Delicious!

I doubled this recipe and put it in an 8.5 x 14" pan.  I did not double the cream cheese because I thought it would be too much, so only used 1.5 times the amount of cream cheese called for in the recipe.  this turned out very good and suited my family's taste to a T.  I wold definitely make this recipe again, without any further changes.

I made this as written. it was a disaster. I dont like to change anything unless I follow the directions the 1st time, So I Made it a 2nd time cause it looked so good in the picture. Followed prev raters reviews. Added cinnamon to the egg mixture only used 10 eggs, and used cinnamon Bread. mixed the cream cheese with milk and sugar.It didnt come out good at all. Im giving it 1 star for the smell in the house. The egg mixture was gross and didnt cook even after an hour and 20. the bread on top was ok with the sauce but my kids and hubby wouldnt even touch it. It has promise, may play and tweak it some more. But as is,I didnt like it at all.

This was DELICIOUS!!  A big hit at my office.  Being able to make it the night before was a huge convenience.  I just popped it in the oven when I got up.  By the time I was ready for work, it was too.  I will definitely make this again.

Made as written except used challah bread and added a pinch of cinnamon to the milk mixture.  Did not care for the cream cheese at all.  Would omit if I made again.  I read the reviews that said to whip it, but didn't feel like taking out the mixer so maybe I will also try that.

I halved the recipe for an 8x8 dish and doubled the blueberries(to 1 cup) and this still came out delicious.  The extra berries add moisture that may or may not please all(hubby thought it was too custard-like) but I loved it.  If you want a firmer, more french toast-like consistency, I recommend sticking to the specified amount of fresh berries and making the sauce to top it(I skipped the sauce and used a small drizzle of maple syrup instead). Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I reduced cream cheese to 1/2 a package and added 1% milk and plain organic yogurt instead.  Doubled the blueberries, too.  Didn't do the syrup as it was sweet enough as is!

Wow! My husband made it for breakfast today and it was really good. He used homemade whole wheat bread and it worked great. We wondered about melting the cream cheese next time to get a more even spread, 1 inch squares seems like too much for one bite. I also  reduced the sugar by half in the sauce and used more blueberries and it was still very sweet...actually I think it needed a dash of salt or maybe some lemon juice to cut through the sweetness a bit, oh yeah, I totally forgot about the butter in the sauce, didn't miss it. Overall an excellent recipe. Its definitely going in the cookbook!

Oh my, I made this just as written, but just a touch of cinnamon and used strawberries instead.  Delicious!  Made extra syrup so we could add over ice cream the next day!  Kids loved it!! Keeper for sure :-) and so many different berries you can use.

Tasty, but don't pour the sauce over the french toast. It became a soppy mess and I had to throw the leftovers out. Next time I would just put it on the side. I also think I will melt and spread the cream cheese out, because I didn't like getting chunks of it in a bite.

I made this  Sunday morning for my daughter's friends and they loved it! The cream cheese layer looked pretty heavy, but it baked up perfectly. For a little added sweetness, next time I think I will double the sauce and serve half of it on the side to be added as desired.

Delicious! Made this for brunch today with a few tweaks to rave reviews:

- Used a loaf of day old challah bread, cubed
- Decreased cream cheese to 1 8-oz package, whipped with confectioner's sugar & vanilla, and dolloped onto first layer of bread cubes
- Used 1 1/4 c of milk & 3/4 c of half and half
- Decreased amt of eggs to 8
- Used 1/2 c brown sugar instead of maple syrup
- After the overnight soak, I flipped the whole thing into another greased pan to bake as directed (It does create another pan to wash but I hate soggy French toast!) This made it moist, not soggy at all.

So incredibly delicious!  I loved it and I made it for my family and my dad, who doesn't like blueberries, asked for seconds!  I halfed the cream cheese like others said to do and it was still awesome!  I also used half splenda and half regular sugar and it was quite tasty!

I thought this recipe was ok, my daughter thought it was good but missing something. I made as directed except for the sauce. Someone ate all the blueberries before I could make it so maybe that was our problem. But for the main part of it I thought it was too bland. It need something sweet and I couldn't taste the maple syrup in it. If I make this again I'll try it with some of the revisions from other reviewers next time around.

As written, it has way too many eggs and a little too much cream cheese. As other reviewers mentioned, it's best with only 8-12 oz cream cheese and 6-8 eggs. The blueberry sauce is SO yummy!

If you’re looking for something different and exceptionaly good this is it. I would classify this as a dessert. VERY SWEET. I made according to directions. Next time I will have the sauce on the side.

I found that there are 2 versions of this recipe on allrecipes.  The only differences is the other one does not have the syrup recipe or the vanilla.  I made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it!  Ages 2 - 62.  I am making this again for tomorrow morning, and I am making a few alterations....      If you are making a 8 or 10 serving batch, I would cut the eggs to 10.  The first time I made this, I noticed that it was a little soupy when I took it out of the frig, so I drained about 2 eggs worth (it still came out wonderful!).      The first time, I used frozen blueberries (thawed).  After I sprinkled the cream cheese and blueberries over the first layer, I sprinkled about 1/3 cup sugar over everything.  This time I am using frozen strawberries (which have sugar added), so I didn't add sugar.      I added about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and to the egg and milk wash before I poured it.      I didn't think it really needed the syrup, but my husband and my mother loved the syrup. Keep syrup handy for those pancake lovers!        My 6 year old is sitting here telling me that I need to write that this recipe is "yum, yum, yum, soooo yummy"

This was a hit for Christmas morning.  I did whip the cream cheese with milk and about 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar to make it more spreadable.  I used italian bread too.  I doubled the sauce recipe, but only used about 3/4 cup sugar total--it was very sweet.  Delicious!  I think it will be a holiday tradition.

Good but I would add cinamon or something to the egg mixture to liven it up, also used less eggs 10 instead and it was just fine.

this is DELISH!!! I sprinkled some cinnamon on top right before I baked it.  The blueberry topping is out of this world!!!  I have made this twice and will make it MANY more times for the family! I know this will be on my table Christmas Morning!

May and June 2016. Still making this for overnight guests. Still get an empty pan with great reviews. I added 1 full large loaf of 3 day old french bread cut into 1 inch or so cubes with my new electronic  knife, it  worked great. I added all of the milk and  2 1/2 cups of berries to the French Toast.  I boiled 3 cups of blueberries  for the syrup, I do not add any *extra sugar in the bluberry syrup, it would be to sweet because my guests opt for drizzling extra maple syrup over their serving.  I made this for brunch  and pulled out vanilla ice cream; more for a brunch treat than an early morning treat. My guests put the ice cream on their french toast and then poured the hot bluberry syrup over all of it. It was a hit!  This recipe never fails me!!! ??Older review * Made this for brunch again for overnight guestThis August 27/2011 and I am still making this dish! THIS IS WONDERFUL!!!!!  Oh My!!!! !kinda good.  I have made this several times now, not one complaint of any kind, except, ahhh, it's gone! I have made this for brunch, breakfeast, and a supper just becasue I really wanted it!  You have to try it with the blueberry sauce, it is so wonderful!  I will always make it, I was a syrup user but WE are so glad I tried the sauce! Our overnight guests loved it and went for seconds, and thirds lol!  I added 1/2 cup less milk, and a half a slice more bread cubed, the second time I made it, it helped with some wetness, (which did not stop us from eating it, mmmm). I use the LOWE

Very disappointing.  I took into consideration all the different comments on any changes people made, but decided to stay with the original recipe.  The only thing I liked about it was the punch of flavor the blueberry syrup added.  Sorry, recipe sounds promising but just didn't deliver.

It was ok. I had to up the cookin g time to and hour and a 15 mins and the temp to 400 because it didn't want to cook in the middle. Next time if I make it I'd reduce the eggs and cream cheese and add some cinnamon, I would also use a different kind of bread, the italian I used didn't seem to soak it up very well. The blueberry sauce was great.

I made Cinnamon Roll French Toast last week and decided to try this recipe this week. I used the same amounts I had used last week, 16 slices of bread, 8 eggs and 1 1/4 cups whole milk. I used 1/4 cup of blueberry syrup instead of the maple. I also blended the cream cheese into the milk and egg mixture.  I sprinkled 1 cup of frozen blueberries in the middle and another 1 cup on top.  I baked 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. It was moist but not soggy, a hit with my kids.

Delicious!  Second time I made this I scaled down to half the recipe and decreased eggs to 4 (instead of 6), and only used about 2-3oz cream cheese (eyeballed it) and it was still great.  Cutting the eggs is a good way to save calories/fat/cholesterol if you're watching those things.  We ate it with maple syrup on the side instead of making the blueberry sauce.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch for 7 people.  It was fantastic & a very pretty & aromatic dish.  My house smelled like an IHOP all day :-)  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used 10 eggs, lite cream cheese (should've cut that down to 1.5 packages instead of 2) Also added a little skim milk & powdered sugar to the cream cheese and whipped the to spread evenly over the bread. I also increased the amount of blueberries in the syrup and the dish itself - 1 pt for each.  I used the Splenda/Sugar blend in the syrup instead of straight sugar & flour paste instead of corn starch.  I forgot to add the butter in the sauce and couldn't tell the difference. This was a simple dish to make ahead for a nice brunch.  Served with some bacon and fresh fruit and everyone was full and happy.  Also thought the dish was rich and sweet even with the reductions in fat & using Splenda.

Very good.  Added more berries per other reviews and whipped the cream cheese with some powdered sugar and milk before spreading on the bread.  Only used 1/2 cup sugar in the syrup....perfect sweetness.

Very tasty! I made this for a company potluck brunch, and it was a huge hit. I used sour dough bread that I dried out in the oven (didn't have any day old bread). I followed the advise of other reviewers and mixed the cream cheese with half of the milk before pouring it over the bread. I also flipped the bread before putting it in the oven to get the liquid more evenly distributed. I will certainly make this again. Thanks!

I love everything blueberry, and this recipe is no exception.  I had it at a bed and breakfast one time, and the owner made it and let it set for 30 minutes (not overnight) before putting it in the oven. So, I did the same.  This dish definitely needs the blueberry sauce.  I don't think it is anywhere near as good without it.  I halved the recipe but added extra blueberries (used frozen, not fresh) to the base and the sauce.  I will definitely make this one again. ***Have made this recipe numerous times, halved or full recipe, and it always turns out fine not putting it together the night before.

This wasn't awful, but it was too sweet, too cheesy (which until this moment I hadn't thought possible) and there wasn't enough fruit for my liking.  Next time I'll cut down the sugar/syrup and cheese and up the berries.

I prepared this with cubed ciabatta bread which I let sit overnight in the egg mixture.  The next morning I then took half the bread and put into another baking dish, sprinkled on double the amount of blueberries and only one pkg. of cream cheese.  I then topped w/ the remaining bread and baked as per directions.  It took twice as long for the dish to cook as called for in the recipe, the cream cheese was evenly distributed as I froze it and grated in onto the bread, but it was too cheesey tasting, I would whip the cream cheese w/ some type of sweetener next time for a better flavor profile.  The sauce is wonderful and I served that on top of each individual serving, which saved the whole flavor of the recipe as it is very sweet and made up for the lack of flavor in the french toast.  I will do this again, but reduce the egg mixture, add sweetener to the cream cheese, and to make the recipe easier to put together I won't bother with layering the ingredients, I'll put in the blueberries, top w/ the cream cheese and top w/ the bread which has already set overnight soaking up the eggs.

My family loved this, although I messed up the sequence and baked it uncovered first! Either way, I don't think the bread will get mushy in this. I used challah bread, 3/4 cup sugar instead of the whole cup, and 1 1/2 cups blueberries in the layering. I also spread out the cream cheese after mixing it with some milk - I think I'll add powdered sugar to the cream cheese next time. I also used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries for the sauce, and 10 eggs instead of 12 (which I think would have been a bit much). Thanks!

If I were rating the blueberry sauce by itself it would get 5 stars!!  The sauce is a keeper for sure!  The casserole portion I modified due to other reviewers comments on the bland taste.  I used Sara Lee Blueberry Crumble bread for the base and only 8 eggs.  Probably could have used maybe 2 more eggs.  I was leary of the cream cheese "globs" so I only used about 4 ozs. of cream cheese and spread it on each slice of bread before cubing it.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to the egg mixture.  For the sauce I only used 3/4 cup sugar, which was plenty, and added a few drops of lemon juice to freshen the flavor.

I made this for father's day breakfast and it was a hit!  I used 1 and 1/2 pkgs light cream cheese mixed with a little powdered sugar and milk, half white bread and half whole grain (no culinary purpose - it's just what I had on hand), 11 eggs, and a few extra blueberries.  I followed other reviewers and doubled the syrup.  It was very decadent, especially compared with the boring diet food I have been eating the last two months!  It is a recipe I will only use for very rare occasions because it is so rich, however, it was beautiful and delicious!

Really good! I just made a few alterations. I used "7" egg beaters, and 3 real eggs. I love cream cheese, but I think this definitely only needed 1 8oz package of cream cheese. I also used two different kinds of bread in each half of the pan.

Excellent recipe.  I agree with other posters about doubling the sauce/blueberries.  Cut down on the cream cheese to 10 ounces.  10-11 eggs is plenty otherwise it might overflow.
*Suggestion: this can be soggy if the bread isnt a day old. Consider toasting the bread before cutting it into cubes.

This dish was so great I just HAD to give it a review.
It was simply fabulous!  I made it for my entire family the morning after Christmas and it was a big hit.  My husband is not a huge fan of sweet breakfast foods and even he loved it.  I asked my sister to rate it on a 1 to 10 scale & she gave it a 12.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and instead of cubing the cheese, I spread it onto the bread 1st then cut the bread into chunks.
I only used 1.5 pkgs of cream cheese and was very happy with the results.  
I also (since some reviewers thought it was soggy) used a loaf of french bread -- stayed with just 12 slices but cut them thick like texas toast & used 3/4 of the loaf.  Perfect!
I tried to time the syrup and french toast to be done at the same time..... Next time, I'll wait til it comes out of the oven & THEN make the syrup thereby giving that scalding hot cream cheese time to cool just a tad before serving.
It was funny watching everyone waller it around in their mouths cause it was so hot -- until it was my tongue of course!

The picture shown with the recipe does NOT compliment the dish.
If you have any doubts.... toss them aside & give this a try!!

Very yummy!
Mixed milk with 8 oz. cream cheese to make a whipped topping instead of cream cheese globs- worked out nicely- no need for 16 oz. of cream cheese! As per other's recommendations...doubled the amount of blueberries, used 10 eggs, and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. The middle came out gooey (but not undercooked) may try baking for longer next time.
Great recipe. Nice that you make it the night before!
Syrup is AWESOME! Would be great to make for just ordinary pancakes too!
Merry Christmas!

This was very easy and everyone loved it.  I used blueberry crumble bread to give it more blueberry flavor.  We will definately add this to our Christmas bruch menu every year!

An interesting twist on french toast...almost turns out with a bread pudding consistency. A little bland and that was with adding cinnamon and cinnamon sugar. I will try again with a little tweaking.

Wonderful! Very easy to make. I did modify the recipe a bit like other reviews suggested-used less eggs and cream cheese. The husband loved it but wanted more maple syrup in egg mix. Definitely cut back on sugar for sauce, very sweet but soo good! I didn't let it set overnight, I just let it soak in the fridge for about a half hour and it was fine. I also spread the cream cheese mixed w/ cinammon onto the bread slices and then soaked them in the egg mixture before putting them in the pan. Extra mixture I spooned over the bread.

Heavenly!  This was wonderful.  It was easy- I used frozen blueberries.  It looked pretty and the taste was fantastic.  We couldn't wait to eat leftovers the next morning.  I will be making this again.  I cut the sugar in half- it was still very sweet (save a little on the calories).   = )

Pretty good with a few changes - This recipe makes french toast that isn't sweet at all that is covered in a sauce that is a bit too sweet.  I would like the two to be balanced a bit more, so next time I'll sprinkle cinnamon sugar all over the bread, and I'll reduce the amount of sugar in the sauce by half.  Also, 12 eggs are WAY too much, try 8 or 9.  And although I'm a fan of cream cheese, I will either greatly reduce or completely eliminate the cream cheese next time because it doesn't really add any flavor to the dish - but if you want to use the cream cheese, I found it's almost impossible to dice, so I just squeezed little bits off the brick by hand (messy, but infinitely easier - by the way, 1-inch cubes are WAY too big).  I LOVED the sauce and added just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavor a bit.  I also doubled the sauce recipe and used the leftovers to stir into vanilla yogurt - it was delicious, but I still plan to reduce the sugar by half next time; I think it will be just as good.

Fantastic and easy to make. Be sure to slice the bread thick enough to absorb the egg/milk mixture. A good quality maple syrup adds the perfect touch. This is a favorite every time!

Could definitely use mixed berries too. 
My family loved this breakfast! Thanks

Awesome.  Enjoyed by all.  I toasted the bread first and used frozen blueberries (bag said use like fresh) and this dish had great texture.

This was a great change to the normal breakfast/brunch options!  I set my bread machine to have a Hawaiian bread mix ready in the morning then made the overnight mixture that evening.  Followed the directions and the dish came out perfectly!  Lots of flavor!  The left overs even tasked great cold the next morning.  This is a keeper!

This dish was a big hit with most of my Christmas guests.  Turns out a couple of them weren't big fans of cream cheese.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 package of cream cheese.  I thought that was plenty but next time I'm going to cut it into very small cubes.  I made the blueberry sauce the day before I served this.  The sauce was okay reheated but it was a little too thick.  I have a different blueberry sauce recipe that I think I would like better.  It calls for 2 pints of blueberries, 4-5 Tbl sugar, and the juice from 1/4 of a lemon.  You combine everything in a saucepan, mash some of the blueberries with a fork, simmer, and stir.

What a yummy dish!  My family is not big on blueberries, so I kept them out of the recipe.  Instead of the blueberry sauce, I added a streusal topping and brought out the maple syrup.  Excellent dish to bring to a carry-in at work.  Got many requests for the recipe.  It disappeared within minutes!

I made this for a Sunday brunch when I had company.  Everyone loved it.  It is nice to make the night before and bake the day of to free up time.  I did use more bread than called for,cut back the cream cheese, added cinnamon and cooked the blueberry sauce for alot longer than the recipe calls for.  It was great and I will be making again for company.

I have made this twice now, and both times, it was a howling success.  The second time, I cut back on the cream cheese, at it was just as good.  Cutting the cream cheese in smaller pieces helps to distribute it better.  I can't wait to make this again!

I made this for a Bible study brunch and it was very well recieved by all of the ladies who tried it. Since I had to go early , it was great to know it was all made except to bake. This is a really easy recipe and so good! Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I made this recipe as part of my Easter Brunch and had gotten great reviews.  I used Challah bread and it worked beautifully.  I also used frozen blueberries which were a lot less costly.  I couldn't tell the difference!

This is absolutley delicious!  I used frozen blueberries as opposed to fresh, and didnt really notice a taste difference at all.  Wonder how this would taste if using peaches, strawberries or even chocolate chips...I'm willing to give it a try!

I LOVED this dish...and so did my husband. I tried it for my family...and the kids weren't too much of a fan. But this was AMAZING!!! I made the changes others suggested to the recipe. I also found a thinner cream cheese mixture worked better to spread it over the bread.

Everyone loves it.  I added powdered sugar to the cream cheese and hand mixed it so that it was still kind of stiff and I placed it in tablespoon fulls.  I also added lemon juice to the blueberry sauce.  I used frozen blueberries.

i make breakfast every Sunday morning for 35-40 volunteers at my church. I have made this Overnight Blueberry French Toast several times and it flies off the table. 2 tweaks, I substitute Brioche bread, a little costlier but it brightens the flavor and I also substitute whole milk buttermilk in the scrambled eggs. The fat in the buttermilk livens up the flavor of the egg yolks.

We have used this recipe for many years for our Christmas brunch. 

I use 1/8 oz cream cheese mix in 1 egg much easier to dollop in the recipe.

Family loved this!  As suggested I added some cinnamon and ginger to spice it up a bit .  Also as another GENIUS reviewer suggested I froze the cream cheese and grated it over the casserole to avoid the clumps.  It worked like a charm!

Served this for a Presidents Day brunch for some of the neighbors. It was OUTSTANDING! I tweaked it based on some of the reviews: used leftover homemade French bread from my freezer, used a little more than 1 8-oz. pkg. cream cheese sweetened with about 1/4 cup powdered sugar & whipped with enough milk to soften it a little, spread cream cheese on bread slices before cutting them into pieces, sprinkled a very small amount of cinnamon over the first layer of bread/cream cheese, doubled the blueberries, doubled the blueberry sauce, served sauce on the side instead of pouring it over the baked casserole. It was a big hit, & everyone at the table went back for seconds!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it three times now. The first time I forgot to use the drizzle over the top at the end. It makes all the difference.

I have been making this every year for Christmas breakfast for the last 8 years or so and it's become our tradition!  I'm planning on trying this in my casserole crock pot tonite.  Anyone else tried it in a crock??  I'll keep you posted!

Crockpot was a disaster!  Turned into tasteless MUSH!  DON'T TRY IT

Just served this for a Thanksgiving  breakfast at work and it was a hit!!  Modified a bit based on other reviews as follows:   Used an entire loaf of Italian bread from the bakery cut into cubes, added 1 tsp cinnamon to egg mixture, beat the softened  cream cheese (used both blocks) with 1/2c cup powdered sugar & 3 tbsp milk with a hand mixer until smooth & then scooped onto 1st layer of bread and spread to cover, topped with 1 bag frozen blueberries (thawed) and remaining bread and then GENEROUSLY sprinkled top with cinnamon before adding egg mixture and then baked on 360* for 75 minutes (took an extra 15min for the center to set).   After baking, drizzled the blueberry syrup on top and then sprinkled with powdered sugar to make it pretty.  I doubled the blueberry syrup recipe and used 1/2 on top & served the other half on the side.  The only change I made to the blueberry syrup was to add about 1/2 cup OJ to my double batch to cut the sweetness a bit...would have used lemon juice but didn’t have any.  Did it all this morning so it didn’t sit overnight but still turned out perfect...sort of the consistency of bread pudding!!  I think the cinnamon absolutely made the dish stand out as a “French Toast” type casserole...without it, it’s more of a blueberry bread pudding.  Absolutely fabulous recipe with the other reviewers’ modifications!!

I made this for a buffet style breakfast meal with a Moms club and they LOVED  it!!!! I used a hearty artisan Italian loaf- sliced it thick (1.5” slices) then cubed it in about 1.5” cubes. I think the bread is IMPORTANT to keep it from getting soggy. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of blueberries extra and sprinkled it all with 1/4 cup sifted powdered sugar before baking. I also made extra syrup by adding 50% to all the syrup ingredients. 
This recipe was excellent! Very very good. The amount of eggs- 12 -is perfect IF you are using a thick hearty bread and not regular sandwich American bread.  I think that’s the discrepancy with people saying theirs came out soggy. And I did cook a full 60 minutes, closer to 65min. 
It came out perfect and I had none left to take Home! Thank you for a fantastic recipe! I will definitely make again!!

I will use a larger dish next time....the blueberry juice bubbled out and spilled onto the bottom of my oven during the last minutes of baking.  I used half French bread and half cinnamon raisin bread; next time I will use all cinnamon raisin to give it more flavor.  It is a very unique dish, and my group seemed to love it!  It keeps you from having to make a separate dessert for a brunch.

This is an absolutely amazing easy breakfast casserole and my new favorite!  The only modification made was a small reduction of sugar, my own personal preference as my blueberries were already naturally sweet.  Hands down the best breakfast casserole I've ever made.  My entire family devoured the dish,  I received tons of  complements

Too much cream cheese.  If you add 1/2 the cream cheese, maybe, but we will not make it again.  My family did not like all the cream cheese.

It is 5 stars with the suggestions of other reviewers, such as less cream cheese (8 oz) only. I used bakery-bought challah bread. I used a full tablespoon of vanilla extract. I used only 7 eggs...12 would be way too many.  The maple syrup I used was a high quality grade A maple syrup aged in a bourbon barrel.  Also, I spread the cream cheese on the sliced bread as recommended bc it does not melt and I didn't want to end up with large blobs of cream cheese. It tastes even better the next day!

I made it as written, as I do all recipes I try the first time.  Next time I will take others suggestion and beat the cream cheese, as the chunks of cream cheese were a little overwhelming.  Otherwise, great recipe.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it. I took the advise of some of the other reviewers. I blended the cream cheese with a little powdered sugar and milk then spread it over the bread cubes. I also added a lot of cinnamon, but it did not overpower the dish. I also doubled the syrup recipe. Easy to make and a big hit!

Awesome Recipe!   I Definitely Would Make Again!
I Used 1 cup Frozen Wild Blueberries Mixed w/ 1 Tab. Flour in Recipe.   @ End of Bake Time, added 1/4 cup sliced Almonds and 1/4 cup Cubed Unsalted Butter  10 Min. @ End of Bake Time....Then, After Pulling Out of Oven put 8 oz Raspberries Atop,  instead of making the Blueberry compote.

Excellent!  I made a 2 lb loaf in the bread machine the day before, doubled the blueberries in both the dish and the sauce (used frozen that were freshly picked this past summer), creamed the cream cheese with 1/4c powdered sugar and a dash of vanilla, sprinkled cinnamon over both layers of bread, brushed the top with melted butter just before putting it in the oven, and added a heavy dash of lemon juice to the sauce.  It baked perfectly in 60 mins.  I wasn't sure about pouring the sauce over the bread so I only did half, but it was great.  Made a pretty presentation.  Held up well as a leftover too.  I could see where soft or not enough bread would result in a soggy mess, so that's an important choice.  Also could see where users should adjust the number of eggs to their preference - maybe use 10 the first time.  For the holidays, this would be good with extra cinnamon along with added nutmeg and powdered ginger.  Might also sprinkle the top with sugar and cinnamon next time.

I did use only 10 eggs.  Took for Christmas.  It was left in the oven a little too long, so it did brown on the bottom. ( Maybe try cutting down on the milk and add the 12 eggs). The rest I followed the recipe this time. Next time try adding the p. sugar to the cm. cheese instead of the chunks.  I also used frozen berries.. 1 1/2 bags.  I made 1 1/2 recipes of the sauce.

Delicious! This dish really is about technique. I read a lot of the reviews and made several changes but the basic recipe is a great starter. I did half the recipe so I had to adjust the quantities of some of the ingredients. 
1. I used 6 slices of soft Italian bread but I lightly toasted them first and let them sit in the toaster oven for about 30 mins to allow them to further harden.
2. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added about 2 table spoons of powdered sugar to 6 ounces of cream cheese. To further smooth it out I also added a table spoon of half and half and about 2 table spoons of sour cream. It made a creamy spread that I was able to easily spoon on the bread in dollops.
3. Though I halved the recipe I still used 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries.
4. I used 5 eggs, 1 cup of milk, 2 table spoons of vanilla extract, 
nutmeg and cinnamon(eyeballed these to my taste).
5. I made this casserole in a deep ceramic pie plate sprayed with butter flavored Pam and it was a perfect size. I lined the bottom with 3 slices of my bread cut into 1" cubes, added the cream cheese mixture, added the blueberries, and then added the other 3 slices of cubed bread. I topped the whole thing with the egg mixture and pushed everything down to make sure all the bread was getting wet. 
6. I got up early in the morning and actually flipped the casserole over. I cut it into quarters and slowly flipped one piece at a time, it actually made it without falling apart to much and I was able to

Amazing.  We are trying to live healthier but love brunch so I used Greek Yougurt cream cheese (lots of protein), skim milk, and half eggs/half egg substitute - didn't  alter the rich taste one bit!  For the sauce we also used Splenda instead of sugar and made a slurry of the cornstarch (otherwise it was just nasty lumps - the "sifting" technique didn't work).  Being from New England, I also used a 1:3 ratio of cranberries to blueberries in the casserole itself and it made for a wonderful sweet-tart taste.  Simply amazing - and turned out to be less than 400 calories each serving.

This was a big hit at an office get-together.  I used a long loaf of french bread and cut it into one inch cubes.  I didn't measure, but just used enough to make each layer.  I will make again.  As one of my friends suggested, this would be great for a morning tailgate.  I had some cold leftovers the next day.  It is definitely better when served warm.

After reading several reviews  I used a loaf of Italian bread. I sliceed the bread and spread the cream cheese on the slices before cubing them. I used 10 large eggs. And added cinnamon and nutmeg.  The rest I followed exactly as in the recipe. I served for breakfast hoping for leftovers. Sadly there were none. Everyone loved it.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was awesome!  I only used 8 eggs, and added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the egg mixture.  Based on the comments about the cream cheese, I used a cheese slicer and sliced really thin pieces of it and covered the bottom layer of the bread pieces (using French bread that I toasted in the oven) and it worked great.  This was heavenly - like eating brunch at a bed and breakfast, all I needed was a mimosa.

I Read other reviews before cooking.  I did 10 eggs instead of 12, Italian Bread instead of sliced bread, 1 package cream cheese with 2 splashes of milk, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar and splash vanilla beat together.  Many people added either regular sugar or powdered sugar to this mixture - but the powdered sugar just makes it thicker which I didn't want so I went the milk route and thought brown sugar would probably add another layer of flavor since most fruit dips are made with brown sugar.  I layered mine with bread, a sprinkle of cinnamon, then cream cheese mixture.   On the final layer of bread I did another sprinkle of cinnamon.  My guests said they couldn't imagine this dish without cinnamon.  NOTE:  There were lots of reviews reporting problems with spreading cream cheese so I put my mixture into a quart ziploc bag and cut a TINY slit in the corner and squeezed it over the bread (thick gobs averted)!  As I squeezed it on, it looked like plenty and I only ended up using 3/4 of the the mixture.  I feel like this technique lets you better gauge the amount of "filling" you use.  Also, I used fresh italian bread and just dried it out in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes (no time to let bread stale).  If going Italian Bread route you want to weigh out 12 ounces which is equal to the 12 slices of bread called for in this dish.  It ended up being about 3/4 a loaf of italian bread.  I also just tore some of my pieces rather than cubing all of them.  I like the occasional big p

After reading the reviews I decided to make a few alterations myself.  I liked the suggestion to lightly sweeten the cream cheese. Also liked the idea of spreading the cream cheese on the bread before slicing.  Very messy but it does give even distribution.  Also added a bit of cinnamon to taste and increased the amount of fruit by double.  Was so rich and delicious.  We will be making this again.

I slightly toasted the cubed bread before placing the cream cheese and resulted in a firmer dish. Delicious!!

I couldn't eat it (dairy-free girl) but my husband and guests raved about it. Very easy to put together and get ready in the morning. Great taste - they didn't even need added syrup (and with my husband, that's high praise ;-) I will definitely make it again, next time with cashew cream cheese and almond milk replacements so I can partake.

I've made this recipe without blueberries just topping it with cinnamon/sugar. Delicious!  The blueberries will be a great addition. Making it for tomorrow's breakfast!

This was wonderful! I did do some modifications per the other reviewers.
1: I used a crusty egg loaf bread cut into thick cubes. I dried it out in the oven for 20-25 mins on 300 to get it nice and crusty
2: I beat only 12 oz cream cheese with 1/4 of powdered sugar, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. It was easy to spread this onto the cubes
3: I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk and 9 eggs
4: I sat two heavy books on top of the plastic wrap covered casserole overnight. This was excellent to meld everything together. In the morning, I flipped over the casserole before baking

This was amazing and I will make again and again.

We have this every year on Christmas morning. My husband is diabetic, so I modified the recipe for him and to make it easier for me! I use sugar free maple syrup in the casserole and I put both cups of blueberries in the casserole. I don't make a separate blueberry syrup, just use regular syrup for anyone who wants it (I enjoy it without syrup). I also use a large Italian loaf from the bakery for my bread. Everyone in my family loves this!

I made this for my daughters baby shower brunch. It got rave reviews. I made 2 pans of it as I thought it would go over well and wanted to make sure I got some. I made it exactly like the recipe called for and it was delicous. I might of thrown in a few extra blueberries but that was it lol.

Pleasantly surprised! I normally do not write when I alter the recipe as much as I did but I felt I could still offer a critique on one area of the recipe.  the mixture of egg, vanilla and syrup was perfect.  I also think 1 hour bake was too long, I took mine out early.  I did not add cream cheese or the sauce on top because I am watching calories.  But I am sure it tastes great.  I also added cinnamon to top of bread and baked uncovered the whole time because I used very soft bread. I did appreciate having somewhere to start, thank you for sharing the recipe.

I made a version of this with a few alterations for a group of family and friends. Winner! Of the many breakfast dishes i have tried for this group, this is the first one loved by everyone who tried it.  

I wanted this to be something we could "grab and go," so I decided to skip the sauce, and moved the sugar to the egg mixture. I added the grated zest of an orange, and sprinkled the second cup of blueberries on top as a final layer. 

It was plenty sweet (if not too sweet for my taste). No one could taste the maple syrup, but they liked the combo of orange and blueberries. No one minded the chunks of cream cheese. In fact, I thought they made a good contrast with the sweetness of the rest. Next time, I plan to omit the maple syrup and drizzle some melted butter over the top before baking. I'll be making this often.

This was a huge hit here. I made half a recipe, but kept the original amounts of blueberries. I LOVE blueberries.  I worried that it might be too watery since my blueberries were frozen, but it was fine. I will make this again.

With all of the fatty foods in this dish I was hoping for something wonderful.  Alas, this missed the mark.  Most of the bread remained crunchy and the parts with liquids didn't have any flavor.  What little flavor there was didn't blend well together.

I used 6 blueberry bagels cut in half.  I didn't cut up the bagel halves.  My 9x13 baking dish fits 6 bagel halves in 2 layers fine.  I didn't whip the cream cheese, just cut into pieces putting some on each bagel half in the bottom.  I put frozen blueberries in the middle too.  I put the second layer of bagel halves on top, pressing the top layer down some to flatten the cream cheese.  I used 10 eggs and 2 cups of milk.  It turned out good.

I make this recipe all the time.  The only thing I do different is to cut the cream cheese into much smaller cubes.  That way it is distributed better throughout.

That's a long recipe, next time I will try Ricotta. Used sliced Hawaiian bread, homemade whipped cream sent it over the edge and served w thick crispy bacon. Lastly, cut this in half and would've fed 4 easily.

I made this recipe this weekend and didn't care too much for it. I was so excited for it and was pretty disappointed. It the flavor was good but the recipe needs quite a bit of work. If I make this again, I will use unite a bit less eggs and blend the cream cheese before adding it to the bread. It was too eggy for my taste and the cream cheese didn't melt sufficiently ( it stayed in chunks and didn't melt enough to blend into the casserole. Also, because the recipe called for so many eggs, it took much longer to bake than the 30 minutes stated in the recipe (I ended up baking it for an additional 45 minutes). The blueberry sauce was the best part but next time I will probably let people pour it on individually rather than onto the entire casserole as stated in the recipe. I would probably also use half the amount of cream cheese as well. Overall, I was quite dissapointed in this recipe and believe it can be made better

I've made this quite a few times and it's always a hit! I do change only one thing which is the cream cheese- cut the amount in half. Each and every time I make it people leave my house asking for the recipe.

I halved this recipe and only used 5 eggs. Besides that I also used a loaf of Italian bread because it definitely needs something a lot heartier than regular sliced bread. I whipped the cream cheese with some powdered sugar to sweeten it and dropped small spoonfuls of it and it was creamy and melted after it baked. I also used canned mixed berry pie filling because I had no fresh blueberries and it still turned out extremely delicious. Even with all the changes I made I'm still giving this 4 stars because it turned out perfectly.

The whole family enjoyed this with Christmas brunch.  I made it as directed except making an extra half recipe of blueberry syrup, but I don't think it really needed it.  It was very rich, so it served about 12 of us nicely with a little left over.  Excellent recipe. Thanks.

Very good, though the sauce was way way too sweet and really needed that hit of lemon juice to balance it out. I didn't think it needed any sugar in the cream cheese as others suggested- I just used a melon baller to make small scoops which distributed nicely and didn't end up as a mouthful of cream cheese in every other bite (scoop when the cream cheese is pretty cold otherwise it smears and makes a mess). Definitely double the blueberries in the dish and the sauce.

Excellent.  But, I did whip the cream cheese with a 1/3 cup of icing sugar and spread over the bread.  Also, I used Ciabata bread - because nice and dense.  Also added a sprinkle of cinnamon over the middle and top layers.  I poured the blueberry sauce over for about the last 15 minutes of baking. I brought this to a pot luck brunch and it was probably the favourite dish and everyone wanted the recipe.  YUUMMMMMMM

Agree with fellow posters that the bread should be a nice French bread. Remember, the cream cheese is cubed, not spread. I only used one and one half pkgs of cream cheese and that was perfect. I also added another cup of loose blueberries to the  bread part.  I found it needed to baker little longer; just keep an eye on it, watching for the center to set and the bread to brown nicely on the top.  If you are lucky enough to have leftovers it warms up nicely too. This is a new keeper for holidays at my house!

We were very excited to try this and really wanted to like this. Following the advice of many reviewers we used 10 eggs, italian bread, added a little cinnamon on top, and for fun threw a few strawberries on as well. The result was just... not good. It had a strange off flavor, almost like a salt. Once you got past that it was just a very bland flavor. None of us finished our plate. We will not be trying this recipe again, which says a lot for us.

2nd Christmas morning we have used this recipe.  We really like this one, & you can use any fruits.  MAKE SURE TO TAKE OUT OF THE FRIDGE 30MINS BEFORE BAKING.  Next year we are going to follow the advice of others & use grated cream cheese & French loaf bread.

Made this for Christmas brunch at work.  It was delicious!  Used sour dough bread smeared with blueberry cream cheese then cut in one inch chunks.  Added cinnamon to the egg mixture and also stirred in the bread chunks to set overnight.  Only used 1/2 cup sugar to the blueberry sauce and added some lemon juice.  I would recommend this recipe for everyone!

This was amazing! My guests loved it. It was like having cake for breakfast! I toasted the bread (gluten free) first and halved the recipe. Will definitely make this again but will halve the sugar in the syrup next time!

Beautiful recipe, as written. Perfect dish for a holiday brunch or a special occasion. Blueberries are in season! Used organic blueberries from Texas. The syrup is really nice. Garnished with a little whip cream.

We needed something for an office breakfast meeting of 20.  Tried the Overnight Blueberry French Toast and OMG was it a huge hit.  I made two dishes to be sure we had enough.  Both dishes were wiped cleaned.  I did not change anything in the recipe, just prepared it as instructed.  The video sure was a great asset in knowing how to chop and when to mix ingredients.  Thank you for sharing.  Definitely will make this one again.

One tip:  When refrigerating an egg casserole overnight, cover the pan with plastic wrap, then place something flat, rigid, and just barely smaller than the pan on top, and weight it down with cans to push the top layer of bread down into the liquid.  That helps the top layer get really soaked.  I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews (10 eggs, more blueberries, spread cream cheese on slices of bread) and this turned out great!  Our family enjoyed it for breakfast, and when playdate friends stayed over into lunchtime the leftovers got rave reviews.

WE made this for a church event and expanded it to feed 160. We used 3 very large roasting pans. We also served baked ham, biscuits, smoked salmon, bagels, cream cheese and a huge cake. It was for our Rector's 10th Anniversary. This dish was the hit of the day.

Yummy birthday brunch! Served with turkey sausages, turkey bacon, extra scrambled eggs, lots of fresh fruit. Found the blueberry syrup quite sweet so preferred to use maple syrup. Small changes were low-fat cream cheese and 2 tsp. cinnamon sprinkled over bread cubes.

This was just so so. I made this to bring to work to share. I used chunks of cream cheese but put a piece on each piece of bread. Made double the blueberry sauce as well. Usually everything I bring gets devoured in less than a hour (there are plenty of hungry men in our crew). But this dish was only 1/2 gone at the end of the day. I left it for the night custodial crew and the pan was empty by morning. It wasn't a big crowd pleaser. Probably won't make again.

This was a hit !  I made it for a professional networking group breakfast.  They loved it!  I wish I had looked at the video before making it.  I think chunking vs spreading the cream cheese is better.  I spread it and it seemed a bit thin.  Also making double the syrup was a good suggestion.

Yuck. More like bread pudding than what I expected. I followed the recipe to the "t" and should have read reviews first. Cream cheese was too much, without cinnamon it was tasteless. The syrup was delish, but that was definitely the highlight of this recipe. Make but only with modifications.

I really liked this recipe.  I prepared it to have for breakfast Christmas morning.  I did follow some of the tips by using softened cream cheese and blending it with powdered sugar.  It was just wonderful!  I especially loved making the blueberry syrup for it too.  Was absolutely perfect.  It does make a lot.  So if you do not have a lot of people to serve it to then consider cutting the recipe down.  I served three people and then sent some over to a friends house and still had some left over!  But I will make this again for sure!

Delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and dipped each bread cub into softened (and slightly sweetened) cream cheese. I also reduced the eggs from 12 to 10. I think even 9 or even 8 eggs would work - I had a few "eggy" spots but we didn't mind. I did use a combo of blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries (all I had) and it was wonderful!

I made this for Christmas Brunch and it was a HUGE hit!
I used 1cup heavy cream and 1cup half n half not milk. I also took advise and only used 1 block of cream cheese and cut it up into much smaller chunks.
*I baked mine in a 9X13 foil pan and it took about 25mins longer to bake.
I served mine with warm maple syrup not the blueberry topping.
This one is a keeper for sure!

I made this for company and everyone enjoyed it.  I used coconut milk instead of milk, dried out some French bread in the oven (I didn't have day old bread), and added some cinnamon and lemon rind to the sauce.  It was yummy and not overly sweet.

oh my gosh, good!  It's like dessert for breakfast.  I made this for Christmas morn and I tore it up, hahah!  My husband said it's too sweet but who asked him, lol!  I will absolutely make this again.  The leftovers kept real well and I was able to eat it for breakfasts for over a week.  I may try what some of the other reviewers suggested next time, shredding the cheese, etc.  The large chunks of cheese were not the best, it's ok when it's fresh out of the oven because you can just swirl it all together.  The sauce on top was just wonderful.  Great recipe, thanks!

I made this to serve on christmas morning and it was divine.  I had read some of the reviews and some people said theirs came out soggy but I used Texas toast for the bread and it came out perfect.  This is very sweet and rich almost like a desert than a breakfast.  Not something I will make often but nice for special occasions. The blueberry sauce is fantastic I plan on making the sauce again next time I make pancakes.

OMG this was delicious!  Made this for breakfast on Xmas morning.  Made some slight changes based on others feedback.  Used Italian bread for this.  Softened 1 bar of cream cheese in the micro and mixed with 1/4c of powdered sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, & cloves and spread on first layer of bread.  Will up the cream cheese next time!  Used 1-1/2c frozen blueberries and topped with rest of bread.  Used 10 eggs and added 1/2c white sugar instead of the syrup.  Added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix.  Let sit overnight and popped in the oven for about 1 hour and 15mins at 350.  Didn't have time to let it come to room temp before baking so added a few mins to overall cooking time to make sure it was cooked all the way.  For the syrup, used 1-1/2 c frozen blueberries and lemon zest and juice from 1 lemon.  Add lemon to this it made such a difference! also added a splash of vanilla extract.  My hubby who isn't fond of sweets went back for seconds.  Its warm and gooey and very comforting.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe try cherries next time. YUMMY!

This made a wonderful Christmas breakfast! Everyone really enjoyed! It was sooooo easy too! And looked beautiful! Really perfect for a special occasion!  The only thing i changed was i used frozen blueberries. I also doubled the syrup! The bread i used was an italian loaf. I think the only thing i would change would be to make the cream cheese chunks a little smaller the next time i make it. Thanks for sharing!

I mostly followed the script but per some of the reviews I read modified a few things. I used a French Baguette for the bread. I used a can of blueberry pie filling instead of making a blueberry syrup and added this to the middle layer. My own twist was I used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese. I scattered 8 oz of the cheese with a spoon. To the egg mixture with 10 eggs & I added cinnamon. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and added some lemon zest to the blueberry pie/fresh blueberry mixture. I put the casserole in the fridge overnight, pulled it out about 45 minutes ahead of baking it. I flipped the entire casserole over prior to baking per a review and this seemed to help in the cooking process so everything was mixed up well and not too soggy. I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top prior to baking for grins. It turned out great!!!! I simply served it with some maple syrup. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe! Happy Holidays!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. Seemed a little bland for my liking unless you put a lot of the blueberry topping on it which was wonderful.  No one in my house went back for seconds and they are all blueberry fans.  I wouldn't make it again.

I have been saving this recipe for a Christmas holiday opportunity.  I forgot to start it the night before but decided to go with it anyway.  I read through reviews to see if anyone else had done this, but didn't find any reference, it would be nice to have a search function on the reviews. I went boldly ahead, and used homemade bread that was a couple days old, a good solid bread.  I spread the cream cheese on the bread and cut it up.   I used twice the amount of blueberries and then added the mixture of egg milk vanilla over the top.  Because I wasn't going to store in the fridge, I left it out on the counter for about 45 min or an hour with a plate over it and my teapot on top to weigh it down and force the bread to be more smooshed into the egg mixture.  it looked like the egg was pretty well absorbed, and it baked up well.  Since I used frozen blueberries I baked it 40 minutes then another 40 with the cover off.  I made the sauce per instruction, and it all came out great.  I will definitely try this again.

Great recipe!!  Changed eggs to 10 and increased blueberry to 2 cups. I decreased cream cheese to 1brick and added 1 cup of milk to it and blended it slowly in microwave mixing ever 15 seconds until nearly smooth.  Do not scald milk!!  Don't worry if small lumps still exist.  Cooked on the second day at 325 for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered.  Brought it out and let it rest for 15 minutes. Wonderful!!  Gave it 5 stars anyway because this recipe is very easy and forgiving!!!!

Simply delicious tried this recipe several weeks ago for a brunch at a local club a received numerous raves.  Had to make copies of this recipe for several friends.  The only change I made was a was to use a little more cornstarch as I felt the sauce was a little watery.  Thank you very much.

This is a great make-ahead recipe, especially if you have overnight guests. I, too, made a couple of alterations. I cut back on the eggs (10) and doubled the blueberries. I also sprinkle the top with sugar before I bake it. I would say the only challenge this recipe has for me is that I have to remember to give myself 1 1/2 hours (30 minutes to "sit"and another hour to bake) in order to have it ready by the time my guests/family are ready to eat.

This was delicious.  I posted questions about this recipe because I was going to have company and had just made it when they said they would not be here for another week.  Thanks to all the answers I received, I cooked it and froze it.  Turned out beautiful.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a few adjustments:  deleted maple syrup and used lemon rind instead (from 1 whole lemon) and sprinkled over the cream cheese, along with about 1/4 cup sugar, added about 1/2 cup sugar to the egg-milk mixture, and used 12 eggs, used about 1 1/2 cups blueberries in the sauce, and about 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice,  used more milk--about 6 cups with the eggs. It took more like 1 1/2 hours to get done.  Added this to my best recipes collection.

I had been blueberry picking the weekend before a girls weekend at my sister-in-laws and decided to try this since I was in charge of breakfast.  Everyone went crazy over it, it reheated well for breakfast on the 2nd day and all the girls talked about how delicious it was all day and could not wait for breakfast the next day.

The homemade syrup is amazing!!  

Only tip I have is I did not buy my bread a day before cutting in up and it was hard to cut since it was too soft so make sure you have 1-2 day old bread or it takes a lot of time to dice it up and it smooshes instead of cuts up nice.

This was pretty good with some of the modifications other reviewers suggested. I halved this recipe, but kept the blueberries the same. I used most of a block of light cream cheese, but instead of cubing it, I mixed it with a couple of tablespoons of confectioner's sugar and some almond milk - just enough to thin it out a bit. (I mixed until the consistency looked kind of like large-curd cottage cheese, and it spread over the bread layer just fine.) However, I think the recipe would have been better with even less cream cheese and more fruit. I used about half a loaf (6 oz) of bakery ciabatta bread that I had dried briefly in the oven. It was pretty good but the top layer of bread did not soak up enough of the egg mixture overnight -- and as a result the top layer of bread was pretty dry. I skipped the sauce -- because I was feeling lazy -- but next time I will definitely make the sauce and I think it will help with the dry bread problem.

I make this every Christmas Eve to enjoy Christmas morning for a couple of years and anytime a breakfast dish is wanted at a kids school event, teacher appreciation etc and it is always the first dish emptied and usually at least one person tracks down "who made it" to get the recipe. This dish will make you feel like a sought after master chef when you take it someplace. (Good luck not eating it on your way)

I thouht it was good but need more flavor. I did try some of the reviewers ideas with add cinnamon to the bread .I think I will  add it to the egg mixture and mix the cream cheese with some powder sugar and spread on the bread and see how that goes.

I just served this to 10 house guests yesterday and it was a hit.  AMAZING recipe!!!!  I doubled the blueberries and also doubled the syrup.  I added about 2 cups of blackberries to the syrup in addition to the blueberries.  I also added a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg, which really added to it.  A splash of vanilla might have been a nice touch, but I didn't think of it at the time.  Loved this!  Definitely a keeper!

It tasted really good. But the cream cheese stayed chunky, I only used 1 box. Next time I'll try whipping the cream cheese with milk and spreading it like the other reviews said. The syrup was perfect as written. I did add cinnamon in the middle and cinnamon sugar on top...yum

This is one of those recipes that people call keeper. I made it for breakfast with our family reunion and it was hit. EVERYONE loved it, it was soooo good makes it hard to stop eating it! I defiantly would recommend to try it.  I followed the advice of others and decreased the cream cheese to 10 oz. I added a little milk so its easier to spread it on bread. Used 8 eggs and I substitute maple syrup with brown sugar. I don't know how would it taste with maple syrup. But even with brown sugar it was very YUMMY. For sauce I doubled blueberry so it wasn't too sweet. Thank you for shearing great recipe.

I first saw this recipe in Taste of Home.  I believe it was on the cover of an issue many years ago.  Don't wait to make this for a holiday, it's a great way to spruce up breakfasts any time!  I cut the cream cheese way down for health reasons and preferences.  Hubby likes maple syrup better than the sauce but I think you should definitely try the sauce - it's delicious.  I also used a loaf of french bread, don't use cheap bread, it's not a good idea for this recipe.  If you're going to bother to make this, use the best ingredients.  Highly recommend if you're a blueberry lover!

Super good! My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I used only 8 oz of cream cheese and cut it into small and thin pieces. Following the advice of other reviews, I doubled the blueberry sauce - was really great! Also, I used only 10 eggs - was enough.

I made the recipe according to the recipe (with the exception of the maple syrup - didn't have any) and had the same "ehhh" experience that other people have had. I did use Italian bread both times and appreciate the density and and crust:bread ratio in the italian vs other breads I was able to find.  Sandwich breads are already sliced too thin, so I wouldn't suggest even attempting to use them with this recipe. Otherwise, I see no need to be repeatedly redundant when it's already been said so well by others.  I tried it again with some of the suggested modifications - that review is totally different!

The second time, to begin, I used 10 eggs and added "some" fresh nutmeg and cinnamon.  Secondly, I whipped two cubes of room temp cream cheese with powdered sugar (to taste) and smeared that ON TOP of the blueberries.  Spreading the cream cheese mixture on the blueberries was far easier than spreading directly onto the bread.  As suggested by someone else, I was sure to "mash" everything down into the egg mixture with it was all assembled to make sure that all the bread was soaked.  Because I'm in Denver, I had to bake mine quite a while extra, but it was worth the wait!  I doubled the syrup recipe and EVERYONE was glad I had.  The second batch was a hit from start to finish. 

Looking back, I think next time, I'll cut back some on the amount of milk that goes into the egg mixture because I felt the middle was still a little bit "squishier" than I wanted it to be.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of blueberries, but my guests love them, so this was my prep-ahead choice for their early morning arrival.  WOW! They loved it, and I loved it.  I followed some of the suggestions, and mixed the softened (light) cream cheese with a bit of the milk and a little sugar, then dolloped the creamy mixture over the first layer. This is a "having company" keeper!

This was fantastic!  I made it for a breakfast potluck at work and it was loved by all.  The only thing I did not use as the recipe states was the cream cheese.  As I was putting the cream cheese on it seemed like if I used all of it that would have been way to much.  The sauce was great. I will for sure be making this again.

Great! The cream cheese kept the syrup, which was perfectly sweet, from being cloying. I used cheap white sandwich bread  and frozen blueberries and it was perfect.

The french toast portion of the recipe is fantastic. I made as written but halved for a 8x8 dish. I think the cut cream cheese pieces are wonderful, you could reduce the amount or cut it with sugar if that's your taste but we thought the whole dish was perfect. Now the "sauce", that's basically pie filling. Very sweet and very thick. I thought about cutting out the cornstarch/down the sugar but made it as directed, I won't be making it that way again. I think that's a matter of preference though so this still gets 5 stars. Thanks for sharing :)

I thought there was way too much cream cheese. It overpowered the goodness of the blueberries. Even as I was making this I thought it was too much and I was right. No one in my family enjoyed this because of the cream cheese. I do think it is a great recipe minus the 2 packs of cream cheese. Next time I think I will either put only a 1/4 amount of the cream cheese or none at all. Also, a little cinnamon would give it a good flavor.

I received great reviews even the morning I did it an hour before baking! I forgot to make it up the night before so next morning I made it (using 10 eggs and whipping the cream cheese with milk to make it "pourable") Just make sure you press the bread down into egg mixture. I let it sit on counter while prepped others things then placed it in oven according to directions came out great,

As is, this recipe is a good base. There needs to be something added to the cream cheese layer. Next time I will add honey and double the vanilla extract. I will also increase the blueberries from 1 cup to 1.5 cups or more.

Delicious! I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. I did make a few changed but only because I wanted to cut down on some of the fat: Used egg beaters for 6 of the eggs and used low fat cream cheese. I also decide to use Cinnamon Raisin bread from our local bakery and wow it was amazing!

The day before my son's wedding we had a 24 person brunch for the family from out of town. I made this dish. It was the hit of the brunch. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was perfect just as it was written. Delicious, moist, flavorful, definitely a keeper. The overnight part is perfect for a busy morning. My family LOVES IT!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe, but this what I liked and didn't like.....loved making it the night before. My cream cheese didn't melt and stayed in blobs, maybe because it was low fat.  Next time I will use just 8 oz and blend it and spread it like other reviewers suggested.  I used Italian bread which was good, but I  would  like to try a whole grain bread to make it a bit healthier.  Glad I sprinkled cinnamon over the top before baking, wish I had done it on the bottom layer as well. I LOVED the blueberry syrup! I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup........will make the syrup again, even if just for waffles YUM!

Can't say enough for this recipe!! I have made this twice before and it never lasts! I, like so many others only used one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese. If you prefer more cream cheese use the 2 pkgs but 1 is plenty and doesn't overwhelm. One suggestion: make as is but use double the amount of blueberries for the dish and for the sauce. So worth it!! Very easy to make and you will not fail. Turns out everytime and looks wonderful as well as smells wonderful!!

This recipe was a huge success at Mother's day brunch today! It will now be a regular at my brunches. I read the other reviews a bit too late and had already purchased plain white sandwich bread and used all 12 eggs but thank goodness I could see the bread was not gonna hold up, so I toasted it very lightly just to make it a little more dry and crusty, more like day old bread. Then I used a few more slices than called for to make sure I soaked up all the egg. I did notice I had to cook it longer to make sure all the egg was cooked and the middle was firm probably even 15 min longer. If you or your guests love blueberry pie, pancakes or cheesecake you will love, love, love this. PS fresh homeade whipped cream on the side for guests to spoon on is a must.

Great recipe.  Lots of compliments and requests for recipe.  Stuck to the recipe for the most part.  Took the suggestions of some reviewers and used French bread, used low fat cream cheese, whipped the cream cheese when soft with some powdered sugar & a little milk (tho this isn't necessary) and doubled the sauce.  Tho some used less cream cheese, I did not.  I liked the gooier parts with the crusty parts.  I did not put the sauce on afterwards--I served in a bowl so people could add their own sauce, or use maple syrup as an alternative.  I used both! Next time I will make a lighter version (i never use lighter versions of anything new when serving to company b/c you never know how it will turn out) and try cranberries or other fruit.  Yum!

For Julymist- you buy a loaf of french bread or something similar and cut it up yourself.  You are right, pre-cut loafs are too thin.

This was a huge hit at a work potluck.  I did use a loaf of French bread and added 2 tspn of cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I would double the blueberries next time and whip some powdered sugar and vanilla into the cream cheese.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup for the syrup that was out of this world and not to be missed with this casserole!

The first time I made this it was perfect.  We all loved it.  The second time I made it it did not turn out too good.  I used Healthy WhiteWheat bread.  It was at least 4 days old but it was gummy.  I think that was probably why it wasn't so good the second time.  It did not seem to absorb the milk/egg batter.  Does anyone have any thoughts on that?

Also the more cream cheese the better.  I saw another recipe almost exactly like this but it only called for 1 8oz pkg. cream cheese.

Like others: add cinnamon (I used 2 teaspoons in the egg mix), cut down on cream cheese, and DECREASE the sugar in the sauce; 1/3 c. was plenty for us.

This was a good recipe to make. Like others I modified the cream cheese,  made half of the blueberry syrup, and only used 10 eggs (continued using 2c. of milk) and everything was perfectly sweet. I creamed only 1 package (8oz) with 1/2 c. powdered sugar, dash of almond milk and splash of vanilla. Placed everything in a bag and squeezed it all over the bottom layer of cubed bread. Would definitely make it again!

Stirred the wet ingredients in first before placing bread in pan.  Only used 1 package of cream cheese in the middle (even that seemed like a lot but turned out fine) and did only 1/4 c of maple syrup.  Also sprinkled cinnamon on top before throwing in fridge.  Really good.  Will make again!

We really enjoyed this for Easter breakfast this morning! I subbed strawberries for the blueberries and used real maple rather than the homemade syrup. I'll be doing this again!

I tried this with strawberries and it was amazing!  Even my 2 younger kids who normally refuse to eat eggs absolutely gobbled it down.  I'll try blueberries or maybe even peaches next time.  I can imagine it with so many different kinds of fruit!  I did what other reviewers suggested, spread the room-temp cream cheese (1 pkg) on the slices and then cubed up the bread.  I also cut back to 9 eggs and it came out perfect.

I made this yummy dish this morning for Easter Sunday it was really good. I listened to ALOT of the people in the reviews cut the cream cheese to 10oz and added more blueberries. I kept the blueberry syrup on the side and then I had the choice of Maple or Blueberry syrup two of my kids chose the maple over the blueberry so I am glad I put it to the side. I thought this was very good. I will definately try it with strawberries next time ;)

I actually got this exact recipe from a friend months ago. Everyone absolutely loved it. I do most of the cooking for my family so anytime a new recipe is tried, it is voted on. I keep the most loved ones for holiday gatherings and this is definitely a keeper. The only thing I added was a bit of cinnamon. I actually have it in the fridge for todays brunch. I read the other reviews and thought the idea of using cinnamon raisin bread was a great idea and may try it next time.

The garden group appeared to enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a large extent, although I reduced the amount of cream cheese by about a third and cut the cubes much smaller - and will go further next time.  I added cinnamon (tsp?) and the zest of a lemon to the liquid eqg mixture, then used the lemon juice to brighten the blueberry sauce.  I used a water bath when cooking.  Will make this again.

Made this recipe with leftover sourdough, cut the portions in half and baked in a 9" pie pan since I couldn't find my square baking dish and it came out perfectly.  The portion was just enough for a family of four.  The blueberry sauce was over the top delicious!  I will definitely make this over and over again.  So easy!

I made this for my family last night and we ate it this morning.  It smelled heavenly and tasted delicious!  My husband would like me to make it again and even my daughter who does not like "breakfast" food thought it was delicious!  For 3 adults and one child I cut the recipe in half and it was still plenty for everyone and leftovers. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Made as written. Took out of fridge for an hour, but it still needed an hour and a half in the oven. Everyone loved it, but I thought it was too sweet. Just my taste. I'll make it again, maybe mixing the cream cheese, though.

I love blueberries and I love cream cheese.  Two things that go together really well.  I used frozen wild blueberries because I always have them in the freezer.  This is delicious with or without the nutritional advice.

Absolutely perfect recipe - followed it exactly.

1)  Loved that I could prepare this the night before.
2)  The glaze recipe was delicious and super easy to make - I will use the glaze for other things in the future
3)  It did take much longer to cook than the directions detail - I think I cooked for at least 30 minutes longer

My husband only recommendation was to use French Bread next time - and I might just try that.

This was our Christmas breakfast.  It was great.  I do recommend adding a protein on the side because this is so sweet all by itself.

I used a raisin breakfast bread and kept the 2 packages of creamed cheese instead of cutting back to 1 as some others suggested.  I also sprinkled cinnamon between layers and again on top.  Serve with whipped cream.  It definitely takes longer than 30 minutes to cook.  My family loved it, even my picky middle daughter.  Will definitely make again.  Perfect for Christmas morning!

This recipe was excellent! I used day-old cinnamon raisin bread, but cut the milk and eggs down by about a fourth so it wouldn't be too "eggy" or soggy. The consistency was perfect! And the sauce was delicious. Next time I might try this with a few white chocolate chips or substitute the blueberries for apples. Thanks for a great, easy breakfast!

My family absolutely loves this blueberry french toast! I took the advise of a reviewer and mixed the cream cheese w/powder sugar...yum! I don't do the sauce because it just came out too sweet and sticky the one time I did try it. Instead I buy the Knotts Boysenberry sauce and it goes great with it. My teenage kids say this is ridiculously good! A must try recipe for sure.

I made this dish over the weekend. We thought it was too sweet to be a main course but would make a great addition to a meal. Only one of the three children liked it (the teenage boy who eats everything) The adults weren't in love with it either. If I were to make this again I would edit the recipe and probably serve other food with it.

Absolutely fantastic!  Easy and delicious.  The trick to make the cream cheese easy is warm it up in a pan with a little of the milk to mix, then it will spread on the bread with a spatula easily.  We doubled the berries in the french toast and also in the sauce ~ wonderful!

This recipe is so easy and the results are outstanding.  Every time I have made this for a breakfast potluck it has been the hit of the morning.  For an interesting twist, I once threw in some raspberries and blackberries as well.  It came out very nicely!  

One thing I do a little differently is whip the cream cheese with a little confectioners sugar and spread it over the bread.  It just makes for a little nicer consistency and flavor, but the original recipe has always been a big hit whenever I make it.  I also like to experiment with different kinds of bread.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone RAVED about it, even my FIL, who doesn't eat fruit. The sauce it great, not too sweet. It's so nice when you can prepare a dish the night before and just pop it in the oven. Will definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe using day old sourdough bread, which held up perfectly.  I cut down the amount of cream chees to 1 and 1/2 packages and it was still creamy and rich. I heard rave reviews from those that tasted it and will definitely serve it again!

Absolutely delicious!  Tasted like something straight out of a pancake house!  I would like to add that I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the cream cheese but the next time I make it, I'll be using both packages as the recipe says.  I think it was a mistake to cut back.  I would also like to double the blueberry syrup topping.  Sooo yummy!

I cannot WAIT to make this again. I accidentally left it in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes so the top bread was too crispy but the underneath part was soooooooo yummy.  So in addition to not burning the casserole, next time I will put more blueberries inside on the 1st layer and I will use a different sauce; this one was bizarre. "Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this site is much better, there's less sugar and water and more blueberries. Thanks to others for the suggestion of whipping the cream cheese with milk so it could pour onto the bread instead of placing chunks that don't melt everywhere. I only used 1 block of cream cheese since I'm not a huge fan and I didn't want it to overwhelm the flavors. I used challah bread and it worked great.  FYI it's really good cold too!

As is I give this recipe a 4 star rating, even though my husband doesnt like french toast and he raved about this.  For me, it just lacked something.  Here is what I did to make it a 5 star recipe...I only used 1 8oz block of cream cheese and sprinkled  cinnamin/sugar on top of the top layer of bread cubes.  Then for the egg mixture, I used the eggs as called for and instead of milk, I used 2 cups of vanilla flavored liq coffee creamer and omitted the vanilla extract.  I  also increased the maple syrup in the mixture to about 1/2 cup.

I know this gets great reviews and looks divine, but we just did not enjoy this.  The cream cheese was overpowering and the sauce was WAY too sweet.   I may try this again with some modifications.   I usually make overnight french toast with apples, but thought I would try something more seasonal.   IMO, I think this needs some tweaking - my family would not  eat more than a few bites.   Sorry!

I like the idea of this, but it turned out just ok for me. Not sure if I used the wrong bread (challah) but it didn't cook all the way through. I'd have to keep putting it back in the over bc certain parts were uncooked.  We also found that any bites without the blueberry syrup lacked flavor. you really had to load on the syrup to get the sweetness.

Oh man! So yummy! I used blackberries instead of blueberries and it is to DIE for. More like dessert then breakfast, like a blackberry, cream cheese bread pudding. I whipped the cream cheese with a small amount of sugar and milk and put it in a bag and squirted it over the bread. When I made the syrup I mashed the blackberries with a potato masher to infuse the flavor throughout. Can't wait to try this with other fruit. Delish!

Very good! I am not one for changing recipes, but I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on top before baking. I halved the recipe and put it in a 8x8 and bake covered for 25 min and uncovered for the same. I did make the full amount of the sauce. Absolutely delish!

Overall it was good. I used French bread. It had a bread pudding consistency. Would probably make it again but next time cut way back on the eggs. The blueberry sauce was super yummy!

Amazing !! I sorta messed up the dish I put honey in the eggs instead of syrup. I was tired but used a loaf of french bread then after I took the foil off drizzled syrup on top let it finish cooking and it was devine. Nice and crunchie on top.  But I did add a tablespoon of lemon juice in the blueberries because I though it would be to sweet. It came out great.

I made this for my mom and grandmother for Mother's Day and it was a great success!  I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers such as adding powdered sugar to the cream cheese and mixing.  I loved that I could make it the night before and just stick it in the oven the next morning.  I left it in the oven a little bit longer than suggested, but that could have been the difference between ovens.  This is also a great left over dish for breakfast the remainder of the week or even dessert!

I made this recipe as-written except that I used 1 pint of blueberries in the french toast and 1 pint in the sauce, which I think ends up being about 4 cups. Also, I thought the sauce would be too sweet for some family members so I served it on the side. Everybody loved this dish. The sauce is very sweet so some people used more than others. We will definitely make it again.

OMG....this was fantasic!  I did use french bread for this recipes and I actually cut the recipes in half as it was only my husband and I.  My husband absolutely loved this.  This will be a definite keeper, I will fix this again.  This is definitely something to fix and WOW your overnight guests with.  I served this with sliced banana and sausage, as well as, mimosas for Mother's Day.  I told my husband I would rather have something at home that I KNOW I can't get anywhere else!  Why would you want the usual breakfast?

Cut eggs back to 10. Left bread as slices and "iced" with cc mixed with powdered sugar n 1/2stick butter layers like lasagna with berries. Should have piped cc mix  and needed more sugar!!!  Left in fridge over night topped with 2nd pan weighted with cans

Delicious, but rich!!  Next time I'll decrease cream cheese to half and make sure I set it out for 1/2 hour prior to cooking so it cooks thoroughly!  Maybe double blueberries too!

My son made this for Mother's Day breakfast.  What a treat!  He used 1 package of cream cheese  and 8 eggs (that's all we had).  I think two packages of cream cheese would have been overkill.  The blueberry sauce was very good but next time I think we should use half of the sugar. He also added lemon rind and 1 Tbsp of lemon juice to the sauce which helped cut the sweetness.  Will make it again with the changes.  Anytime someone cooks for me it makes me smile. :)

This was so easy and good. I was a little surprised at the baking time since I cut recipe in half but it was still great. I used half block of cream cheese and a fraction of the sugar for sauce but still loved, loved, loved. Strawberry is next...

Not a fan. Too much cream cheese. Needs sugar and not just syrup all over it. Lacked flavor - cinnamon, sugar, etc. Super easy recipe. We didn't have a 9x13 baking dish so I had to use a casserole dish instead. It felt like 2 hours before we finally ate. I would never make this again.

Very easy and tastes great even when you have people who aren't a fan of French toast. You can make it diabetic friendly by using splenda and sugar free syrup

I made this for my wife on Mothersday.  I'm no baker, yet it turned out great.  She loved it and wants me to make it again for brunch in future.  In viewing comments, applied the following adjustments: 1) used French Bread, 2) cut into smaller cubes (1/4-1/2 inch).

I LOVED this recipe, so darn delicious. Made it for breakfast for the mothers I work with for mothers day and they could not stop making "yummy" noises as they ate.  I had to finish off the rest of it this morning and simply re-heated it in the microwave for half a minute, so sad that I had to go back for seconds ;)

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day brunch last year because she loves french toast. I'm happy to say it was a huge hit! Although it does take a long time to make, it was well worth it! I have already stared preparing it for this years Mother's Day Brunch!

This was a little taste of heaven! My only regret? I didn't use quite day old bread, it was too fresh, and it made it really mushy on bottom, :(  I also don't think I let it bake long enough. You can be sure I won't make those mistakes again, because even with the mistakes, We have developed a serious craving for this! LOL

Made this today for dinner to test recipe before serving to guests next week and it was scrumptious!  The top and bottom were crispy and and it tasted like french toast/blueberry pancakes.  I followed advice given in reviews, used a whole loaf of french bread and 3 extra thick slices of homemade white bread to fill the top layer. Only used  1 package of cream cheese mixed with 1/4 cup of powder sugar, a few drops of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Used 2 cups of frozen blueberries from last Summer, not thawed. Instead of maple syrup, I used 1/3 cup sugar,  a dash of salt and sprinkled cinnamon on top before refrigerating. I only had time to refrigerate for 5 hours. Sprinkled some white sugar on top layer of bread cubes right before baking. It baked up in 1 hour. All of the liquid was absorbed--not soggy or gooey at all. It was served with warm maple syrup  to save time today. (made that before and it's a 10 star)Just perfect! Will definitely make this again and with other fruits as well.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch.  It turned out fantastic!  I did take the advice of some of the reviews and added a little milk and powedered sugar to the cream cheese and whipped it up.  This made it easier to spread and a more even dispersion of the cream cheese across the bake. I used frozen blueberries and that worked out fine. I also added chopped walnuts and sprinkled on top.  Added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg....yummy   It is a keeper!

Flavor was right on but the dish was a bit too soggy in some spots.   Maybe the bread I used wasn't "day-old" enough.

Far too much going on; detracts from the blueberries.   Instead of layering the "toast" would suggest whipping up some mascarpone or fresh whipping cream with a touch of sugar to use when serving.

Really disappointed in this dish!  Did not like the chunks of cream cheese or overall flavor.  I've had such incredible french toast type bakes in the past that this was not up to par for me.

This recipe did not work for me.  I sliced the bread instead of cutting it into cubes.  I used ten eggs and it still seemed like a few too many.  I cut the cream cheese in half and it still seemed like too much.  I doubled the amout of blueberries in the toast and in the sauce.  The sauce was excellent and I will make it again, but the toast took way to long to bake through the center and no one liked the texture.

This recipe is delicious!  Easy to make the night before, bake in the morning and everyone raves about how good it is.  I've made this recipe several times and have used raspberries instead of blueberries, also strawberries instead of blueberries.  All are great and I've not substituted any of the other ingredients.  MMM, MMM, Good!!

Not something I will make again.  I realize that I prefer a breakfast casserole with sausage.  Adding a spicy breakfast sausage to this dish might just make it pop.

I would definitely keep the bread as slices and mix the cream cheese with some confectioners sugar and cinnamon next time.  It was a bit disjointed with the cubes.

Mike suggested to try with apples. Blueberry too bland.  Or maybe remove cream cheese & put on top as frosting.

Wonderful flavor! Next time I'll add a few more pieces of bread and cut down on the cream cheese. The topping was absolutely delicious! I made this and the praline topping french toast casserole, and although I received compliments on both, I've decided that I prefer this one a little more.

This was really good and made for a beautiful presentation.  It also made breakfast for guests very easy and fast!  I cut the eggs down to 10 which I thought was plenty, and I also cut the cream cheese down by 1/2 to reduce some of the fat.  I might go for all of it next time, though!  Update 1.28.19...Made for family again and although it is good, makes a ton and we prefer plain old french toast!

I only gave three stars because I do not like mushy bread. The top layer was crispy but the bottom layar was like bread pudding.  My kids wouldn't touch it.  I will try again using the suggestions in the reviews.  I will cut the milk down and cut the cream cheese smaller.  The sauce over top was really good.  Very sweet.  I am also going to try this with strawberries.  The only difference I did on the recipe was used frozen blueberries.  I thawed them first and that worked fine.

VERY good!  Used frozen blueberries, 1/2 the cream cheese, & only 6 eggs.  Also for topping we used 1/3c Agave nectar instead of sugar.  Thanks for a tasty recipe, we love blueberries!

My sister and I ordered blueberry french toast @ a Mother's Day Breakfast @ a upscale resterant. You all should know this should be named Overnight Blueberry Bread Pudding!!  My sister and I dont really care for bread pudding but love french toast!!!   So again this is NOT french toast...

This came out great! I took the suggestions of several other posters, and reduced the cream cheese to 1-1/3 bricks. I used french bread from the bakery, and softened the cream cheese first, then tore it with my fingers into little balls and dotted the first layer with it. This made a TON of syrup, which wasn't necessary. May consider a layer of maple sausage next time.

I should have read more of the reviews before I made this. I thought it was good... I made it with strawberries and did only use one package of cream cheese, but next time, like others, I would whip the cream cheese and add some sugar and probably some milk to make it pour-able. And I would probably add more of the strawberries in the future.

Great dish when you have company overnight, you can make it the night before and just throw it in the oven in the morning.  Also a great way to use up old bread.

My family really enjoyed this recipe - my husband said it may have been one of the best dishes I'd ever made.  I forgot the butter at the very end, but didn't miss it at all.  I also added cinnamon to the top before baking it.  I didn't mind how sweet it was from the cream cheese, but I wonder if there would be a way to freeze it partially and cut it into strips with a vegetable cutter or something for a more even distribution.  Very good and I will definately make again - maybe with strawberries as some others have suggested.

Decadent Breakfast!! A loaf of french bread (found in your bakery department) is great in this recipe.  If you don't have cornstarch in your pantry, no fear...it will work fine without.

Very nice recipe.  I made this for a baby shower brunch and all the women LOVED it.  Was easy to do.  I followed the directions exactly, but found I didn't need 2 blocks of cream cheese 1 was plenty.  It also took almost 30 minutes longer to cook all the way through.  After the initial hour it was still not set in the center.  I will make this again on special occasions.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this, it is so good.  I have made it to take to a brunch and it is now a Christmas morning staple.   I use a loaf of french bread from the bakery.  I also whip the cream cheese with about 3 tbs. of powdered sugar.  I also add  1 tbs. of cinnamon to the egg mixture.

Just good- not great. Let it sit for about 4 hrs. and not overnight. The sauce was to sweet. It could be reduced by half. Not sure if i would make this again but if i did, i would add spices to the egg mixture to give it more flavor. Overall- 3.5 stars.

I made this for a family brunch and it was well recieved by everyone.  Everyone raved about the blueberry sauce.... The french toast part was good but I did reduce the cream cheese by half and added cinnamon/nutmeg to the bread cubes. I will make again for a large group since it was very rich tasting dish.

This was delicious.  Very rich, of course, so it will feed a lot of people.  The sauce is delicious.  I made a double batch as some suggested, but had way more than was needed.  Next time I will not double the sauce.

Great recipe. I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and we all really enjoyed it. Some ate as a dessert and others with the rest of the brunch dishes. I did have a little trouble grating the cream cheese but that's all. I doubled the sauce and served it on the side. Exceptionally nice that it can be made the night before serving. Thanks.

I only used half the amount of cream cheese and thought it was still too much.  Maybe its because I don't think of cream cheese with french toast.  The sauce was fantastic however!

If I could rate this 10 stars, I would! The only change I made was to use 2 tubs of whipped cream cheese instead of the blocks. I also made sure to push all of the bread down into the egg mixture. Next time I would make 1 1/2 batches of the syrup. Easy to make and nice that it can be made ahead of time. I will definitely make again!

I made this for my daughter's birthday brunch (with my extended family) and it was great and got lots of rave reviews. I used blueberry bagels and spread the cream cheese on the bagels before cutting them into pieces (a bit messy but good in the end). It soaked over night. I will make it again!!!

this was very good. I mixed about 3/4 cup powder sugar with the cream cheese so it would spread easy and poured it over the bread instead of chunks it turned out well

Great taste. The cream cheese stayed in cubes so I had to mix my bites. Top bread was crunchy, but we liked that. Leftovers were good with just a little maple syrup. We did not make the sauce for the top and it was still very good.

A friend gave me this recipe about four years ago and I have been making it ever since. I substitute 1 8oz block of farmers cheese for 1 of the cream cheese's. It gives the dish a better texture. This recipe I have referred to many of friends.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I doubled the blueberries (they're just so good). I only used 7 eggs because that's all I had. Still came out great.

I made this for Christmas morning, it was excellent. I followed a few tips here and added sugar and a little milk to the (room temperature) cream cheese. I left the bread slices whole and spread the cream cheese over them and made them into "sandwiches". I called it "Stuffed blueberry french toast". I also made extra syrup. It was a huge hit. Thanks for this recipe.

This has become our traditional Christmas breakfast for the past few years since I found this recipe.  The best part is that I can put it together when I'm cooking up a storm for Christmas Eve, then all I have to do Christmas morning is put it in the oven and make the sauce.  I use frozen blueberries and they work just as well (the juice mixed with the syrup is sooo good!

We did not really care for the taste of this.  There was way too much cream cheese. It over powered the entire dish. I used sliced French bread instead of cubed bread.  The finished product had a nice appearance & nice texture.  The blueberry syrup was tastey.  I would not make this again.

Great. Instead of cubing the cream cheese, I make a cream cheese filling (with egg, vanilla, and a little sugar).

I wanted to be sure this would be delicious for my husband's birthday breakfast so I read many of the reviews. I used 10 eggs and 1.5 packages of cream cheese and I also chose to use a long French baguette, cut into 1" pieces (smaller actually). I wanted to avoid what some reviewers said was a strange reaction to the cream cheese chunks. So I tried to make the "chunks" very small and spread them around on all the pieces of bread by hand (icky!). I also didn't make the syrup and we just used maple syrup. The end result? Everything "worked" but it didn't have much of a taste, which was disappointing. It also was quite "eggy" and could have used 1-2 less eggs (8 total). I don't know what else would improve it - perhaps sprinkling some sugar on the whole thing to add more taste. Perhaps simply the blueberry syrup would have been better. Either way, I don't know if this is the best thing to make for a special occasion (at least test it out another day first).

This was the most unbelivable recipe I have ever tried.  Besides being extremely easy to make, it tasted so very good.  Due to cheese, it never got very firm and maybe chilling it and eating it cold would work.  But warm, with the sauce...Crazy Good

Soooo good. Every one loved it. I used a loaf of Italian bread. I had to cook a little longer to get the middle firm but other than that.... Flawless.

I made this for an Easter brunch and it was very well-received.  Beautiful and delicious.  I used two French bagettes cut in 1" slices and dried in my oven for an hour at 200, then quartered each slice after spreading with cream cheese.  I used a big 9x13 stoneware dish and followed some of the reviewer's advice by cutting the eggs to 10 and cutting the cream cheese to one package - wish I hadn't done it.  My great big dish could have handled the extras and there wasn't tons of cream cheese flavor, but everyone still loved it.  I served the blueberry compote on the side and let guests ladle what they wanted on top of their serving.  This was THE hit at our Easter brunch and I'm glad I was the one who brought it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Mmmm.  I made this for Christmas morning with for my husband and in-laws, and my husband loved it.  He's pretty picky, so I was happily surprised that it was a hit.  I've made it several times since.  The most recent time I made it, I used pre-sliced bread instead of cutting into a big loaf of fresh Italian bread on my own.  The thick bread is much, much better.  :)

Made it this morning...AWESOME! I did make a few modifications as others have suggested - used Texas Toast spread with 1 block of softened cream cheese and doubled the blueberries. Definitely will make again.

Love it! I have been looking for an overnight holiday recipe and this it it! The first time I read the reviews and whipped the cream cheese it was messy and time consuming and in my opinion not worth it. The second time I sprinkled powdered sugar over the cubed cream cheese to sweeten it a little...YUMMY!

Very delicious -- but WAY sweet.
Not sure what I'd do to prevent that for next time -- but it has to be toned down!
*update - I remade this a few weeks back and reduced the sugar down to about 1/3c and it was PERFECT.  Not too sweet at all.  We were all impressed with the change.

This recipe received mixed reviews from my family. Some thought it was too "gooey" while others thought the cream cheese was "odd"...and I used less than 1 8 oz pkg. I also used only 10 eggs and replaced the blueberries with strawberries. Overall it was delicious but I'm going to try again to find a better way to utilize the cream cheese.

This was a very good breakfast and pretty easy to prepare.  I didn't give it five stars though because I made some changes and I am not sure if I would have been as good as written.  I decreased the cream cheese by half and also the eggs.  I think there would have been too many eggs and too much cream cheese if made as written.  The syrup was fabulous though and my husband was basically licking the bowl.

A very popular dish at my house. I've used the sauce on other items. The cream cheese chunks are a little odd so I need to find a fix for them.

So, so good. I dont let it sit overnight though. I just mix the egg mixture together, dip the pieces of bread in it, put it in the dish and then pour the eggs over the top (I also add a touch of vanilla into the eggs). I think it comes out a little soggy when I let it sit overnight.

This is the BEST french toast ever!! My family loves it! I saw this orginally in taste of Home and have made it a ton of times. I don't care for blueberries so the only thing I do differently is use strawberries. I absolutely love the cream cheese in it. It really is worth making.....you should try this for sure!!!

This is a great recipe! I have made it for Christmas and Easter mornings. I made a few changes. I put 9 eggs in, 1 1/2 pkgs. cream cheese, more blueberries. Really easy too!

I tried this recipe for something new and different one year, and now my mom and I make it every year for Christmas Eve breakfast, it is delicious!!!  I also tried it this year with frozen mixed berries instead of blueberries because I couldn't find blueberries at the store (yeah I was amazed, too) and it was just as good if not better.  You should try it!

This dish was easy to make.  Since no photo is submitted, I will let you know that it comes out real pretty.  Keep in mind when planning on making this dish that you need to give yourself 1 1/2 hours time to prepare - (let it set 30 min and bake for one hour). I didn't notice that and had to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to have it ready for my children before school!  LOL   Great for the holidays!!!

This is a very flexible receipe. I make multiple substitutions and it's great. I substitute egg substitute for the eggs, non-fat milk for whole milk, fat-free cream cheese for regular cream cheese, and Splenda for sugar, maple flavor for syrup, and lower calorie bread. I usually add cinnamon or cardamom to the egg mixture, too.

Double blueberries.  Double the sauce.  Do not cut down on the cream cheese. (everyone commented on how "light" the french toast seemed)

I used French bread, as others suggested and thought the blueberry syrup was tasty... But I also thought this had too many eggs and didn't enjoy the outcome. Sorry!

I made this as our special Christmas breakfast, and everyone liked about three bites of it.  It was much too sweet, and the ingredients didn't really blend very well.  The egg didn't soak into the bread completely because of having so much cream cheese to work around...I won't make it again.  What sounded so great in a recipe actually turned out not appealing at all.

I made this for a brunch and everyone RAVED about it! It was very helpful reading others reviews, as I followed advice and cut the cream cheese down to 12 oz.  I did decrease the eggs to 10 instead of 12 and decreased the milk slightly. Anyway, the result was a fabulous dish. Can't wait to make it for Christmas morning!

This recipe is wonderful! Made this for my family was so easy and fun to make. Everyone loved it. The blueberries and cream cheese in the recipe was so good. But the best part was the topping  "blueberries sauce".Yummy Good! My Hubby and I had the last two pieces the following day and it was even better. I will make this over and over again for family and friends. Thanks, Patsy

I was looking for a special Christmas morning breakfast and I've found it.  My friend and I had a girl only weekend and I tried it out on her.  It was amazing and she loved it so much that she took the recipe home to make for her family.  This will definately become a regular Christmas moring breakfast in my home.

This dish got rave reviews at the bunch this morning.  I will make it again.  I forget to buy the bread early so I cut the thick sliced bread in cubes and laid it in a single layer on the counter to dry out a bit.  The only other adjustment I made was to use almond  milk with the egg mixture.

We absolutely loved everything about this! It was very easy to put together. Changes I made include: used a French loaf and layered the bottom of the pan with slices covered with the cream cheese, then cubed the rest of the loaf and more cream cheese cubed up. Doubled the amount of blueberries....(we love blueberries). Also added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a tiny bit of cloves. Lastly, had to add the whipped cream in lieu of more syrup.

I made this for a work pitch in.   Brought the sauce in a small crockpot to keep it warm and delicious when pouring it onto casserole.  Accidentally bought just one brick of cream cheese, so only used one and it was still so tasty!  Will make again and again!

As many other reviewers have said, this is a good start for a terrific recipe. I started with an entire loaf of sliced brioche (13 slices plus both heels). Sprinkled each layer of cubes with 1/4 t cinnamon. Stayed with the 2 blocks of cream cheese but creamed in 1/3 c of powdered sugar. Distributed little dallops across *2* casserole dishes. Doubled fresh berries in the casserole to 2 cups. Used evaporated milk because I had it on hand (1 can plus water to make 2 cups). Stayed with the dozen eggs. Proportions seemed perfect across 2 dishes and made 12 servings. Baking time and temp was just right. Syrup was a must for me to balance the dry bits on top. Loved this!

A+!!!  We made this for Christmas morning and it was the perfect breakfast for the holiday!  It tasted like a blueberry cream pie our mom used to make  when we were kids so it was the perfect meal for me and my sister.  We made it with Cinnamon Swirl bread to give it an extra cinnamon flavor which I think really put this over the top!  Will definitely make this again!

It was delicious. Made it exact to the recipe. Only suggestion is to double the topping recipe. It's even great left over believe it or not.

I didn't use as much cream cheese as it calls for because my family is not crazy about it. But it still was delicious.

This was a perfect addition for Christmas morning brunch. I didn't use quite all the egg/milk mixture and let it sit in the oven after baking to keep it warm until we were ready to eat. My Denver altitude usually requires a little longer baking period anyway. I didn't make the blueberry sauce. This would be good with lots of other fruits, or without fruit or cream cheese. Definitely  a keeper. Be sure to use a hardy bread. I used Italian.

Fabulous bunch casserole!! I made this similar to CLARRY32’s version of using 1-1/2 packages of cream cheese except I stayed with cutting the cream cheese into cubes and no extra sugar. Used Italian bread and 10 eggs, too. Made it for a church brunch and friends wanted the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I substituted brioche for french bread.  I would definitely make it again and highly recommend making the blueberry syrup as it really adds to the tastiness of the recipe by adding some tartness to balance the sweetness of the main dish.  Might consider reducing the amount of added maple syrup to reduce the sweetness.

Made this recipe to have New Years morning and it was a delectable treat. I used thick sliced cinnamon bread and as mentioned in another review, added a little sugar to the cream cheese. Next time I’ll top the cream cheese and blueberries with some lemon zest.

I would say it was a success.  It could have used a few more minutes baking as the custard was a little runny.  I made the blueberry sauce with Swerve instead of sugar to reduce the carbs. Turned out perfect and nobody knew I changed the recipe.  This recipe was a winner due to that fact the base wasn’t overly rich or too sweet like many overnight French toast casseroles.   During the holidays it was a delicious new addition.

I made this in a 10x15 pan, so my quantities of ingredients used reflects that. Like a lot of people, I used Italian bread (about 1-1/2 loaves) and frozen blueberries.  I used 14 eggs and kept the milk the same. I didn't pay any attention to the amount of blueberries, just used what looked right to me (large bag of frozen blueberries from Costco made it so I didn't have to worry about how many I used) As one suggested, I put the cream cheese in the freezer just long enough to firm it up so I could grate it with a cheese grater and used 1-1/2 blocks of cream cheese I didn't want large pockets of the cheese I because I thought it would be too much.  Grating  the cheese was definitely the way to go. I made a double batch of the sauce but could have got by with one.  I put some blueberries sparingly on top.  After it came out of the oven, I drizzled a little of the sauce on top and put the rest on the table.  Lightly dusted the top with powdered sugar, more for decoration than anything else.  I was really pleased with the results.  Making a new recipe for Christmas breakfast with family over is always a little stressful.  Everyone liked it, even my wife, who was sceptical at the get go because she thought the cream cheese was going to be too rich.

Made this for Christmas breakfast for a party of 10.  Sooooo very good, everyone liked it.  Used fresh blueberries inside and then used raspberries for the sauce, otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I meant to add cinnamon to the top forgot, that would make a nice touch.  Will make again for a crowd.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and it was divine! I read the reviews and suggestions before making it and it turned out wonderfully. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on top of each section of bread just for my own liking. It was the perfect breakfast for such a special day. I will definitely be making this again in the near future!

Delicious!! I did follow other reviewers suggestions and whipped the cream cheese with a little powdered sugar and spread it on the bread.  I also only used 10 eggs and a dense wheat bread but not 12 slices since it looked like way too much for my pan. I just let people put the syrup on themselves. So good!

I made this yesterday into today. I followed the directions, BUT took other "chefs" advice as well as my own. I used a Hawaiian bread loaf, I cut it thick then cubed it, I used 11 eggs, and I whipped my cream cheese with 1/4 cup powdered sugar. It Is Fantastic! The syrup is delicious, casserole can be eaten with or without. Family loved it too, light souffle like texture, with a hint of sweet with this bread and the cream cheese mixture, which IS lacking in original recipe. Highly Recommend with these changes.

I made a half batch with glutenfree bread and frozen blueberries, baked in an 8 x 8 pan. It was delicious! My gluten-eating kids loved it, too.  I made a full batch of the sauce, figuring we could use any extra on other things. I don’t think there will be any extra.

I love sweets, but this was over the top for us. I’ll stick to an apple French toast I generally make for Christmas. This was very good. But 3 bites was the max for us.  I divided up into small portions to freeze.

This is a very tasty and filling dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out beautifully. I did wind up having to bake it for about ten minutes longer than the listed time, but that was no big deal. A little of this goes a long way, which is the case for me with any type of French toast. Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made half the recipe. 6 pieces brioche that I spread with the softened cream cheese. I put the sides together like a sandwich and cut into cubes. I used half of everything  else except I used a half cup fresh blueberries and a half cup or so of frozen blueberries in the casserole and more frozen blueberries for the syrup. I loved the custardy texture.

This has now become the family traditional Christmas Breakfast.  I will be in big trouble if I don't make it.  Over the years, I have at times adjusted the cream cheese.  I now spread a little on the bread before I cut the bread in cubes.   I use a little less than a package. It still has a nice flavor without the fat and calories.   I also bake my own bread ahead of time and use only maple syrup for sweetening and no sugar.

Definitely a family favorite for birthdays or Christmas! We prefer only 1 block cream cheese. Sweet or Challah bread expand past the 9x13, but the liquid amount still works. Raspberries are a great alternative too!

Made 1/2 recipe this weekend. My twist was I creamed 1 block of cream cheese with 1 egg, maple sugar and 1/4 c of sugar. I poured this mixture over the bread. Ii was hoping to have more of a ribbon of warm “cheesecake” in the middle.  I used Aldi Marbled cinnamon breakfast bread and added 1/2 t of cinnamon in with the eggs. I also used the blueberry sauce on All Recipes with almond extract.  The taste was WONDERFUL. The next time I will not mix the maple syrup in the “cheesecake”, I will just mix It in with the eggs. It was not as thick as I would have liked. I will make again!

Very good. Since I wanted to try this with my husband I cut the recipe in half. It came out great and I will make this again.

This is excellent!  I was nervous when I uncovered the dish during baking (it did not look as I expected), but it all took shape by the end :).  This was gobbled down at our Christmas brunch today.  Although it was delicious as is, I could see going with less cream cheese in the future to make it a little less heavy.  I did add a tsp of cinnamon to my blueberry sauce because cinnamon is the best ;).

I didn't like the cream cheese.  If I make it again I will leave that out and I think it needs syrup lightly poured on the top maybe for last  5-10 minutes.

This was amazing however, I read a lot of the other reviews so I tweaked it.  I used egg Challah bread and to avoid clumps of cream cheese I microwaved  the cream cheese  to soften it up and mixed a touch of cinnamon to the cream cheese then I was able to easily spread it on the bottom layer of bread. I also added a touch of cinnamon to the blueberry sauce and kept it on the side.

Made this recipe for my family, they all thought it was good but had too much cream cheese. I used an Italian bread loaf and I definitely reccomend that. I did scale it back to 1 1/2 blocks of cream cheese but the next time I make it I will scale it back even more to maybe just 1 block and cream it so that it can spread it over the bread. All in all it was yummy but I'll making some adjustments next time.

First time I made it exactly as recipe states and I give it four stars. I personally didnt like the cubed chunks of cream cheese, but like everything else. 
However this wouldnt be an Allrecipes review if I didnt add my own spin that makes it my kind of delicious. 
I used the cheap 30 cent walmart french bread loaf that's about to expire. The dryness of the bread and lack of good crust which would normally be lackluster, goes great with French toast because it really soaks everything up. 
What I did was cut it into 1 inch bread slices, slathered it with blueberry flavored spreadable cream cheese (usually for bagels) between each layer and with sections about 4-5 sliced high, cut once longwise, and 4 the other way, giving a bunch of cubes with cream cheese on both sides. I then used clean hands to mix in the berries and separate the pieces. 
I use 10 eggs, 1/4 cup real maple syrup, the vanilla, and 1 1/2 cup milk, with an additional 1/4 tsp cinnamon, for the liquid, poured over and fridged overnight  and baked like normal.
The original topping is delicious, but an easier way is to use a couple tablespoons of the leftover blueberry cream cheese, room temp, and blend it slowly with cream (or plain coffee creamer), then add in powdered sugar to get an easy icing to pour over the while thing.

I followed the suggestions of other  people and it turned out great! First of all I only used 9 eggs. I used italian bread as well. I also used one brick of cream cheese and whipped it with 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and 1/4 cup of whole milk. When I say whipped I ax5uslly used a magic bullet because my mixer broke but it worked just as well! I also replaced the blueberries with just over 1 cup of diced fresh strawberries. At the end I poured half of the egg mixture on top, sprinkled on a generous amount of cinnamon, and then poured the rest on. I put it in for maybe 5-10 minutes extra and it turned out PERFECT.

Made this for a group of hunters and two of them asked for the recipe.  The only changes I made were to use Texas Toast for the bread and then only used one package of cream cheese. Delicious.

This is a fabulous recipe.  For my first try, I used French bread and I doubled the amount of blueberries.  I glad I did since our family likes blueberries.

I can't stand people who make tons of changes to a recipe and then rate their recipe, not what was originally posted! I made it exactly as posted.... and it was perfect. I used regular old fashioned sliced bread, yum! It wasn't overly sweet, it has amazing flavor! And it looks beautiful. My kid loved helping me make it. The syrup was perfect too.

At my new working place, they love to celebrate birthdays with potluck brunch. I "NoCanCook" and was stressing over what to bring  until I stumbled upon this recipe. I followed as directed except the cream cheese was cubed into smaller pieces.  It turned out so good, my boss took a second serving.

Made it with fresh peaches instead of blueberries, and it was yummy.  Used King's Hawaiian rolls, lightly toasted in the oven, as the bread.  It took longer than an hour to set the eggs.  For the sauce,  I used only 1/3 c (brown) sugar, no water, and 1 tsp corn starch.  Added a little ginger, lemon juice, and almond extract, then finished it with a pat of butter.    I hate it when people rewrite a recipe before eating; but this is a great basic recipe, and I used what I had on hand. I should have cut the cream cheese into much smaller pieces, but it still tasted great.

I thought it was fabulous! My husband thought it was good and my 9 year old didn't like it. Cutting back the sugar would make it a little healthier. I already used light cream cheese and whole wheat bread.

Delicious!  The only change I made was to spread the cream on the French bread as suggested  (added the extra into the casserole).  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture because I like the spices.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this for the first time. It was delicious and I am passing this recipe on to a family member who really enjoyed it. I would add more blueberries because we love blueberries and there wasn't enough for our liking.  I would definitely make this again!

I added twice as many blueberries to the bake and decreased the eggs to 10.  I would also decrease the cream cheese as I see other reviewers had recommended but it was a great dish and I will definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated. I'll probably use a little less cream cheese next time, but that's a personal preference. The compote really makes a nice touch.

Loved it! Because I  was trying it out on my hubby before I made for family get together, I  made a few modifications.  I didn't pour sauce on entire casserole,  I spooned on per serving. I reheated the next day by putting on cookie sheet with cooking spray 350 for 15 minutes and sauce in microwave. Was delicious again!

It was delicious! My only critique is that the blueberry sauce is super sweet!!! I added a splash of lemon juice, but it was till too sweet for me. I think next time I will add the syrup sparingly over individual pieces instead of pouring over the entire dish. Thanks for submitting this recipe. It's a keeper!

Made this for fathers day and it was a hit! I would suggest using less cream cheese, for us it was too much. Saw another lady used less cream cheese and added a lil powdered sugar. I also used regular sliced bread (didnt realize my mistake) and French bread would have absorbed the liquid better. but overall really good. Everyone is going to have little things they will tweak for it to be ideal for them! Thanks for the recipe!

A little bland- overwhelming bread flavor even though I increased the amount of blueberries.  Followed recipe to a “t” otherwise. Really felt it was a lot of effort for a “meh” dish. May consider making again with some major  adaptations

This was delicious, and everyone raved about this tasty breakfast treat that you make ahead of time and bake that morning... this is going to be featured at Christmas!! I didn't change a thing, except I used brioche hot dog buns as that was what they had available at my store, got 8 of them and it was perfect!! The creaminess of the cream cheese, even without adding sweetener to it, was divine!

LOVED THIS! A real crowd pleaser!! 
I made 2 batches. One, substituting with Cinnabon bread. The other batch was both Gluten Free (using Schar GF bread) and lactose free (using Tofutti cream cheese and  plain unsweetened almond milk.) Both required full 60 minutes.

Loved loved loved this recipe AS written! In all honesty I was looking for a French toast recipe for a large family brunch and this didn’t really fit what I was looking for because French Toast for me has lots of cinnamon, and is drowned in sticky maple syrup , and this doesn’t call for either. But it sounded too good not to try it. A blueberry cheesecake casserole breakfast dish? Hells yeah!! So glad I followed it as written because it couldn’t have been more delicious or gone over better than it did. My only alteration was using gluten free bread, for my Celiac self!! So soooo good.!

I pretty much made it as listed, it was tasty enough but the egg layer was a little too much. If I make it again I will divide the egg mix and add just half at a time.

This was very good. I toasted up some french bread in the oven (rather than using it at a day old) and it came out wonderfully crispy. I also used only 10 eggs, but did everything else as written.

I have made this for several family brunches and it's always a favorite. After looking at the review comments, I also made some changes. I beat the cream cheese with some powdered sugar then spread it on the first layer of bread cubes. I prefer this to cubes of cream cheese since it is distributed through out the casserole better. I also use fewer eggs (10 instead of 12).  Sprinkling cinnamon on each layer of bread cubes also adds a very nice flavor.

I've made this breakfast dish several times and it's a big hit.  I follow the recipe exactly because I tend to have the correct ingredients in the house most of the time.  This one is rich with a dozen eggs, basically a loaf of bread, and two 8 oz packages of cream cheese, plus more, but these ingredients and the quantity of each item is what sets it apart from other similar recipes. It's the only one I will ever use.

I will for sure make it again. Followed a couple of reviewer's advice but will try it again as originally written. I creamed the cream cheese with some sugar and funneled it on. I think the chunks of unsweetened cream cheese would have been better both ascetically as well as flavor. It was still awesome and most of the work was done last night. My other half had maple syrup on his and his son had 1/2 compote 1/2 syrup. My son and I did the compote only. We all enjoyed it so much.

My out of town guests were very pleased with this special breakfast. They went back for seconds!  I must say that I took a chance in serving this to guests without doing a family taste testing prior.  I followed the recipe - I didn't add or take away anything! I did serve it with sausage patties! I had left over sauce which I served over pound cake that evening for dessert!  This recipe will be a keeper for sure!

This was disgusting. Mine tasted more like scrambled eggs with cream cheese than blueberries or french toast. I recommend reducing the egg mixture or doubling the bread, and also reducing the cream cheese.  This recipe is also poorly written - how much is 12 slices of bread? Sizes and thickeness of sliced bread can vary. Do not recommend this recipe without major adjustments.

Made this for a sleepover.  Kids liked it! It is very sweet and I might try it again with strawberries. I used italian bread and doubled the blueberries, which was a great idea. For my personal taste, it is a bit too sweet, but everyone else gobbled it right up! They were very full!!

I made this for a friends wedding day breakfast, and it was a huge hit! With the leftovers I cut up and put on the dessert table and everyone loved it.

This is a Great Base Recipe.   I  made  it  completely
Gluten Free!!!   People  make baking GF  WAY too complicated!  It  shouldn't be.  I  used several of the changes that  others found more appealing.  My family were in Bliss!
No Sauce needed.  I  froze  the little I had leftover.  Reheated perfectly!  I  Did  Add  more  Cinnamon, everywhere.  Personal choice.  Will  make  it  Forever!

It was ok, probably won't make it again.  I didn't care for the plain cream cheese, was hoping for a sweeter taste.   When checking if it is done, check all the way down to the bottom.  The top half was cooked, but the bottom was too mushy for my taste.  I did not make the blueberry sauce topping, maybe that would have helped.

Delicious and easy for kids to help make too! I used leftover cream cheese icing (because I used the last of my cream cheese up to make icing for an earlier dish), it was so good... No extra blueberry sauce needed on the top because it was sweet enough. I also used only 12 egg yokes because I used 12 egg whites for angel food cake (angel food cake III). Pair these two recipes together and you'll get dessert and breakfast out of the same 12 eggs!!

This is the first time I've decided to make a dish and then comment. After reading a few other reviews by others and implementing some of their suggestions, I have no complaints. I used a whole boule instead of sliced bread. It was still a bit soft and not exlpired. So I toasted the bottom layer, until a golden brown, to give it more body and flavor. Excellent choice, even if I do say so myself. It absolutely filled up the entire bottom of the 9x13 in. pan. I put more blueberries in than the recipe called for and sprinkled cinnamon on that layer as well. After putting everything into the pan except the blueberry topping I drizzled a few tablespoons of ghee over the top add another layer of taste and unctuousness (is that a word?) to the final product. And brightened the blueberry topping up with about a quarter of a cup of Meyer lemon juice (it was a double batch, as per another suggestion). Out of the fridge today and into the oven. Couldn't wait for it to cool down. Yummers! Quite a bit left. Come on by and bring a bowl.

Wow! This was so good! The French bread base worked out really nicely. I was worried that the crust might stand out and be chewy, but after it soaked in the egg mixture overnight it was perfect! I made the Blueberry sauce as well as a Raspberry sauce just for fun. Delicious!

This was well received at a dietitians potluck. I only used 3/4 of a block of cream cheese, cubed (just not into having a lot of this in French toast) , and 10 eggs but otherwise followed the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce. It was very good and I received compliments. I will make this again.

This version just didn't do it for us.  I used twice as many blueberries (which our family loves) and half as much cream cheese (which doesn't like our family), but otherwise left everything the same.  I don't much care for overly sweet breakfast good, but we though this could have really used some sugar or more maple syrup in the custard.  The blueberry sauce just seemed flat to use maybe some lemon juice and zest or some ginger to wake it up a bit.  We also found it needed a good half an hour longer to bake.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast!  Easy to put together and bake.   The only change I made was to use 1 cup of maple syrup instead of the white sugar for the blueberry syrup.  I made the syrup the night before after prepping the dish and just re-heated it for serving!   
Such a decadent delightful treat!

OUTSTANDING! I made this for Christmas Day breakie...an absolute hit!! I took the advise of other reviewers; used French Brioche bread & 4 bakery croissants instead of regular sliced bread / used frozen blueberries thawed in cold water / broke out my Kitchen Aid mixer and whipped 1 block of cream cheese & sugar and added lime juice (about 2 Tblspns). Using a rubber spatula...very easy to spread evenly. Followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I did not make the sauce, not needed in our household. Its perfectly sweet without. So so soooo good!

I didn’t have fresh berries on hand.  I used frozen mango in the French toast overnight in the fridge. Frozen blueberries also worked just fine in the pour over sauce. It was a huge hit for all those who tasted it.

Scouring the Allrecipes community for Christmas morning wow factor sweet offerings, I came upon this.  Despite the photos and method that clearly shouted THIS IS. REALLY NOT FRENCH TOAST I forged ahead.  Allow me to underscore.  This is NOT French toast, it’s bread pudding.  Nomenclature not withstanding,  I must admit, I will try this again with a few modifications:  add more maple syrup or brown sugar  to the liquid portion to sweeten it up.  The blueberry sauce was lovely... just too thick.  Less cornstarch I think, and/or more water. A bowl of whipped cream should DEFINITELY be served alongside this dish. When I finally busted out a can of emergency whipped cream it was met with oohs and ahhs.

Very good! I am not a cook....nor a baker. I hardly ever cook, so I was a little worried about how this would turn out. But I wanted to do something special for my husband for Christmas breakfast. A great way to save time Christmas day...95% of the dish is prepared the night before, and all you need do is make a very simple sauce. 

I read a lot of the reviews, and was grateful for the fact that many more seasoned cooks than I posted about recipe modifications.  I too used less cream cheese. I also used frozen Blueberries,  which in my opinion worked just fine. 

My husband had three very large squares of this...I had two. It is a delicious treat for a special occasion. 

I will be making this again.

Everyone loved it. I made it per the recipe, but when I checked the top layer prior to baking, I found the bread rather dry. I removed the top layer, beat up a few eggs in a bowl (with a little syrup and milk), and soaked the bread for a few minutes. Then proceeded per recipe. I think I would have been disappointed if I hadn't done this. But it is a keeper.

We loved this French toast!  On the recommendation of our local bakery, I used Portuguese sweet bread. I was afraid it might be too sweet but it was AMAZING!  I didn’t have time to make the blueberry sauce but we all loved it with maple syrup,I will definitely try it next time!

In addition to the 1 cup of blueberries I also added about a half a cup of cut up strawberries too. I liked this.  I made the blueberry sauce the night before worked well. Served on side at room temp.

This was really, really good, and a hit at Christmas breakfast. I did give 4 stars, and with the addition of cinnamon to the egg mixture and lime juice to cut the sweetness of the syrup, that took it to a 5. It cooked a little longer, as I did 1.5 times the recipe, we topped it with whipped cream, the blueberry syrup and regular syrup.  So good!  Everybody "oooh"d and "aaaah"d throughout the meal. Seriously, it's that good!

This is a great recipe. I have made it two different ways. Both ways were a hit!!  The first time I made it as the recipe calls for, except I took the tip of whipping the cream cheese. I changed it the 2nd time by whipping 2 of the eggs into the cream cheese, so much easier to spread. Next, used 2 apples chopped up, tossing them with a little brown sugar, cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  I may use 3 apples next time.  After putting the egg/milk mixture over the bread I sprinkled the top with cinnamon. Then followed directions.  My son loved it on Christmas morning!!  He said that it really tasted like French toast.  Topped it with syrup and a little whip cream. Baked it about a total of 65 minutes.

This is our Christmas morning special breakfast. The family loves this dish. I use a hearty cinnamon bread, or Pepperidge Farms has a variety that could all work depending on your taste (French Toast bread, Maple, Apple etc) I use fresh blueberries sprinkled with some sugar and cinnamon to bring out juices. You could easily switch up this recipe with many options - strawberries, apples, raspberries etc. great breakfast dish - everyone looks forward to breakfast on Christmas.

Added a little extra bread cubes and it had the perfect bread pudding-like consistency. We served it with whipped cream. It was a hit with the whole hungry crew.

So scrumptious!  I took the advice of others and whipped the cream cheese with powdered sugar and vanilla.   I also used bakery style french bread and I am glad that I did.  Next time, I may use brioche. 
*2nd Review: Used brioche this time and was a little concerned after the first 30 mins that I had made a mistake using brioche.  But after an additional 40 mins, it was PERFECT!
3rd Review: Used brioche and baked it for more than 60 minutes.  I did not whip the cream cheese as per the first review.  It was still a crowd pleaser.

This was very good - I made just a half recipe - forgot to get cream cheese and had some mascarpone on hand so used that instead. Made it creamy, but I think maybe the cream cheese would have added a little more substance. Definitely a decadent dish, not for those watching their carbs or calories.

Added cinnamon to each layer of french  bread.  For the cream cheese I used 1.5 blocks and mixed it together with some water and 1/4 cup confectioners sugar. Then I put it in a ziploc bag and cut the corner to then squeeze it out over the bread. Used 2 cups of blueberries in the middle. This was so good!

This was delicious.  I’d made a similar recipe once before using Neufchâtel cheese and I think I liked this one better.  ALWAYS a go-to when we have overnight guests to make breakfast for.  And without fail the guests will ask for the recipe.

This was very good. Use 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese not two. I used twice the amount of blueberries.  The sauce was delicious.  We had this for Thanksgiving brunch.

I've made this about four times already and it always comes out great. It's very easy to put together and the blueberry sauce is awesome. I think in the future I will make other versions like blackberry and apple.

I did use croissants for the bread. I had to make sure it cooked all the way through the croissants. That allowed for a crispy top layer. I will definitely make again.

Perfect as written! Made for Thanksgiving morning using day old french loaf. Besides a little lemon zest and reducing the sugar by half in the syrup made no other changes. Served with homemade whipped cream and the whole family asked when I will make it again. Thankyou for sharing!

Modifications:
Bread - no time for day old, french bread cubed and dried at 300 degrees for 8 minutes.
cream cheese - 2 bars whipped with 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup powdered sugar
Eggs - cut down to 11 eggs

Expect original would be just as good but relied on a few adjustments per the reviews.

Delicious!  We will make this again!
I halved all the ingredients except for the blueberries and made it in an oval, 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.  I only had to cut about 5 minutes off the "uncovered" baking time.
Also, I left the butter out of the sauce since I felt like it didn't need it, but I did add a splash of orange juice at the end of cooking the sauce.  I generally feel like blueberry sauce benefits from a splash of citrus at the end.

This is great! I used regular white bread, frozen blueberries, and only 11 eggs since that's all I had.  It was on the soft side but not too soggy. I thought the cream cheese would melt but instead I was biting chunks of it, so that's not as good as it could be but hey, it wasn't awful! I don't think it feeds 10, maybe 6-8.

I made this recipe exactly as written since it was my first attempt at it. The cream cheese didn’t seem to melt down the way I was expecting and overall it seemed tart. Next time, I would add confectioners sugar & milk to the cream cheese as others have suggested and replace half of the milk with pineapple juice. I know it sounds weird to put pineapple juice in the eggs, but I think it would add sweetness and flavor to the dish.

I made this just to see how it compared with a decades old recipe from Southern Living magazine called Blueberry Bread Pudding.  It is almost identical.  the only difference is that one uses a jar of Dickinson´s  or other quality brand of Blueberry Preserves, heated, and served over each serving. Even better with just a mere dash of ground cinnamon added to the egg mixture.  Nothing new, but oh so very good!

Really yummy recipe. I followed what other reviewers said with sprinkling the cinnamon on the layers. MIxed the cream cheese with powdered sugar as well. I used frozen blueberries and much more than recipe said in the syrup as well. Turned out great. I made a big batch in a 13 x9 dish and used 12 eggs.

This was fantastic and easy - made with blueberries and put  a pint in the bread mix and a pint for the sauce.  I used Italian bread and didn't make any changes.  Made for a cabin weekend with a large group and everyone loved it!  Would definitely be delicious with any type of berry.

As a shortcut, we ended up spreading the cream cheese between slices of bread, then slicing the bread and putting in to the 9x13 casserole dish - this seemed to distribute it more evenly than trying to drop chunks of it in to the bread mix.  :)

I made this exactly as written AMAZING!! Everyone at the meeting wanted the recipe!! East prep. Put in the fridge over night. Next day, pop in the oven to bake. While baking, I prepared the wonderful sauce that tops the casserole when served. Beautiful presentation just like pictured. .

Needs some adjustments, including reduce the cornstarch in the blueberry sauce 
Put a little sugar in the egg mixture. Less cream cheese cut in smaller pieces 
Also I would but in a larger cake pan like a  lasagna pan  it would be better for the soggy pieces on the bottom if it wasn’t all crammed in a tiny cake pan

Excellant Brunch dish.  I cut back on the sugar to allow the blueberry flavor come through and added a splash of brandy to the sauce. Also took a hint from another all recipes person and slightly trimmed to crust on the bread. I used sour dough and just left a small bit of crust. Delicious.

Only changes (No biggy). As others have mentioned, whip the softened cream cheese with 1/4 cup powdered sugar.an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Yummy!

It has a lot of possibilities but this recipe needs a lot of work.
For starters reduce eggs, mix ingredients in a bowl, cream the cheese add nutmeg.
Be sure to read the other comments since other people have great ideas.

Very rich and super tasty! used half the cream cheese (and that was plenty for me!) but I feel like this would be good with a ricotta/cream cheese mix. Would be a little lighter and make it way easier to disperse. Great special brunch dish . I prepared mine ahead of time and just took it over to my friends, popped it in the over and BOOM! I'm an amazing chef! ;)

I made a small change to the topping. I just put 1/4 cup maple  syrup in small saucepan w/berries and cooked slowly until berries released their juice and served it warm with french toast!  I will definitely do this again.  Delicious and easy.

I love this recipe, I used mixed grain bread which is harder than regular white bread and it’s perfect for this recipe. I used frozen mixed berries and it works well as well.

I made only  two changes.  I  added an extra handful of blueberries before the second layer of bread. I cut the sugar in the topping by a quarter of a cup. It was absolutely a repeat.  Just sweet enough and definitely enough protein to "stick to your ribs".  That is usually my problem with sweet breakfast dishes.

My husband and I loved it.  I used Italian bread and I only used one brick of cream cheese.  Next time, I would consider using both bricks like the recipe called for.  I also only used 10 eggs and would definitely not use 12 eggs like it called for.  Everything else was done exactly as called for.

This is an amazing crowd pleaser that you can make the night before.  Love that it uses fresh blueberries.  I used two cups of blueberries in the sauce instead of one cup.

This was amazing! I did not have maple syrup but it was sweet enough without it. I added some lemon zest to the blueberry sauce. My pan was too big for a loaf of French bread so I added 1/2 of a Hawaiian bread. Next time I will assemble overnight, because I did this 6 hours before and the cook time was more like 65 minutes.

I make this a few times during the year.  It is so popular and I rarely have leftovers.  Definitely double the blueberry syrup!  The original recipe does not call for enough.

I tried to make this recipe last Christmas and everyone loved it!! Since then, been making every time blueberries are in season and Christmas..Though the sauce it a little bit too sweet . I decided to reduced half the amount of sugar , and used coconut-palm sugar instead of white sugar. Once the blueberries are in and broken up, it adds up sweetness to the sauce also. It turns out great.

Great dish for my family and friends!  Always receives compliments.  I use Sara Lee Artesano bread because of its thickness and only about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cream cheese. I found 2 full ones was too much.  Such a simple casserole but looks and tastes fantastic.  I serve my blueberry sauce on the side.   Turns out every single time with a great presentation!

I cheat immensely.  Instead of cubing everything I cut the bread then half it, place in baking dish.  nuke cream cheese to soften then spread a hefty amount over the bread, add the blue berries and repeat.  Two layers is usually enough for 1" slices of bread.  I own a bed and breakfast and this recipe is the most requested.  I've also made with strawberries and apples.  To the apple recipe I add cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is the Best recipe!!  Made this for New Years and again for Memoral Day weekend for company we had.  I do make it wth Italian bread and only 10 eggs as the 1st time 12 eggs (large) seemed too runny.  Sprinkle cinnamon into the egg mixture and on top before baking.  Soooo delicious.  We ate it for 2 breakfasts and everyone LOVED it.  Would like to try it with fresh peaches this summer...can’t wait!!!

Everyone at work loved this recipe!  I sprinkled cinnamon on the bread before baking.  Also added juice of one lemon to the blueberry syrup as suggested by others...gave it a great flavor!  I left the dish covered for 35min and then baked uncovered for 25min, no problem with sogginess.  Used regular wheat bread from Trader Joes.

Made it for company breakfast only thing I changed was I used Texas Toast and it was perfect and a hit.  It was gone within minutes.  I made it once with cinnamon/brown sugar instead of blueberries and it was just as big of a hit.  Next will try with fresh strawberries.

Delish!! Just a couple of adjustments.  Used just one block of cheese, cut into half inch pieces.  Extra blueberries.  Sprinkled top with some chopped pecans as well.  Used a dollop of marscapone whipped cream for serving.

I make this quite often and always get raves.  Only changes were mentioned by others - add cinnamon to sauce as well as sprinkle on layers.  Also thin out  cream cheese with milk , add a little confectioners sugar, and spread over bottom layer of bread. (not easy to do but worth it)

I was expecting a bit more from this recipe.  It was certainly easy to make and tasty but there was something about the cream cheese that was disappointing.  The pieces of cream cheese were bland rather than creamy and sweet.  They might be better mixed with some milk, vanilla, and sugar to soften it, then added to the layering in spoonfuls.

I used half Cinnabon cinnamon bread and the rest was a baguette. I also used huckleberry berry syrup instead of making the one in the recipe. It was delicious and super easy to make. It did take longer to cook then the time stated but that could just be my oven. Definitely this recipe is a keeper!

They looked amazing, but were actually dry, and the cream cheese was just too much.  Should have blended the cream cheese with something a little sweet (like maybe some blueberries and a hint of sugar?) and thinned it out in the middle layer.  I however, won't be making it again.

I made this just because we love  blueberries. My family loved it. My daughter came over after I sent her a text with the picture of the French toast casserole.  My son and his family came and they loved it as well. I'm making it for a bridal shower This will be a huge hit for blueberry fans.

I used a loaf of French bread, and probably could have used about half of a second one.  I couldn't get two entire layers of bread.  Nonetheless, it turned out absolutely DELICIOUS and all of the ladies at the Sunday brunch at church wanted my recipe!

I didn’t like the blocks of cream cheese in this. They didn’t blend in and had no sweetness. The sauce helped but overall I wouldn’t make this particular recipe again.

Easy to make.  I cut the cream cheese smaller as recommended.  Added walnuts to the top of the dish to add some crunch.  We'll make this again.

The middle didn’t cook. It would be better to turn the heat up to 365 for the last 20-30 minutes.

The hunks of cream cheese are distasteful!  I kept a small portion of the egg & milk mixture and whipped the cream cheese with that. That mixture was  poured over the bottom layer of bread cubes and blueberries.  I added the last layer of bread cubes and poured the egg-milk- syrup mixture over the whole thing.  I also used  about 2 cups of blueberries, rather than one cup.  I followed the directions after that.  it turns out  much better.  I've made it several times this way, and it gets rave reviews.

delicious!  got so many many compliments on it.  The first bite and lots of 'wow' complete with lit up eyes.  I used a whole large baguette of day old artisan french bread.  only used one package of cream cheese and just cut it into pieces and tossed on.  used one pint of blueberries in the dish, and another pint for the sauce. I did sprinkle that layer with some cinnamon(glad I did because I do think it helps compliment the other flavors).  made the sauce as written but added some lemon juice to brighten it up. and did pour it over.  This is a synch to prepare.  All you need is some sausages and bacon, and a hot steaming cup of coffee, and you'll have folks set.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I'm giving this three stars because of the blueberry sauce. That part was amazing and I will be using that sauce on many things. The French Toast casserole was bland and my family really didn't like it all that much. I probably will not make it again.

It's very yummy, but resembles more of bread pudding dish than a french toast.  However, I suppose that is what French Toast is in all honesty.  Regardless, it was a really good recipe and tasted great.  It made good use of the frozen blueberries I have had since summer.  And I added a little bit of raspberries in the sauce too to punch it up a bit.  I will probably only make this on special occasions because it is a pretty rich dish.

Directions incorrect on cook time. Baked 30 min covered and then 60 minutes uncovered. The last 30 min increased to 400 F. Never browned. Did follow direction to take out of fridge and let come to room temp before baking. If had taken it out of oven at the 30 minutes uncovered it would have gone flat and been liquid egg. We used a secondary thermometer to be sure the oven temp was accurate. Probably won't make again.

I didn't read other suggestions but on my own used 1 cup splenda instead of sugar and a splash of lemon juice for the blueberry sauce. I think next time I will do 1/2 sugar 1/2 splenda. We have discount bread stores here so I used  thick slices of Texas toast. I did push all the bread down in the egg mixture to make sure it was saturated before I put it in the refrigerator. The next morning I "fluffed" it up a bit and ut it in the oven for the first 30 minutes covered. Before baking uncovered for the next 25 minutes I stirred it all up to help distribute the cream cheese better. I also sprinkled cinnamon over the top and put it back in the oven for 25 minutes. It came out wonderful!

Made it for the family for Christmas Day Breakfast .... what a HIT!!  I made a few changes ... Cream cheese filing:  I whipped the cream cheese ( 1 1/2 cups) until creamy, then I added 1/4 cup heavy cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla - whipped it until it was creamy  smooth... it spread so easily.

We love fruit so I decided to changed it up a bit by adding strawberries too ....defrosted berries: 1 cup of blueberries, 1 cup of strawberries.

For the egg mixture  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg 

For the berry topping: 1 cup of frozen blueberries/1 cup of strawberries defrost- keeping the juice from the defrosting.   Instead of water I used 1 cup of pomegranate juice and added the reserved juice from the defrosted fruit.  I skipped the butter and added sugar to taste.     Really I think you can use just about any kind of fruit you want .... change it up!
This is defiantly a keeper for my family on Christmas Day for breakfast!!!

I made this for New Year's Day brunch.  It was aaaaamazing!   I cut the recipe in half  but  made the full recipe for the syrup.  I cut the cream cheese into very small cubes for more even distribution.  The only change I made was to the syrup.  I added a small amount of lemon zest to add some brightness and it was perfect!  I will make this again and again.

It was a delightfully moist French toast and I will make it again for company coming in the New Year. The only thing I would have liked was a sauce that thoroughly covered the bread cubes. I stretched the sauce over as much of the top as possible and then let individuals add whipped cream to make sure some guests did not feel it was too much of a bread taste. I did not think it was but some people who prefer a drenched sauce might think so.
I think I will monkey around with the sauce to make it cover the toast completely. 
But it was delicious!!! And everyone enjoyed it. A winner.

I used the suggestions of a previous reviewer- whipped the cream cheese and added 1/4 cup powdered sugar. I also added a couple of TBSP. of 2% milk just to make the cream cheese mixture easier to spread onto the bread crumbs. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 casserole dish. I did not make the topping just because we had quite a bit of syrup already on hand. For our taste, I think it's at least six servings. It's quite tasty and filling!

We loved this breakfast dish. It was my first time making it and it was a huge hit! We used gluten free bread and it turned out perfectly - we couldn’t tell the difference. Perfect for Christmas morning as it was quick to prepare and delicious to eat!

As other reviewers, I made a cream cheese filling rather than just using hunks of cream cheese. I used 1.5 blocks, 1 egg and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Were I to make again,  I would use 2 full blocks,  1 egg plus 1 egg yolk and a tad more sugar. I used a loaf of grocery store bread. It was ok but slightly soggy, but that could be because we live at altitude,  and maybe it just needed a few more minutes in the oven.   As for the sauce, the quantity recommended made only enough for a very thin layer.  I'd make 1.5 times the amount next time.

This has become a Christmas morning staple. Half of us like blueberries and half do not, so we double up the blueberries on one side. We also use Greek Cream Cheese.

I made this recipe for Christmas morning breakfast and everyone loved it.  I gave this it 4 stars because, as written, I liked the taste, and would make it again, but to love it, some modifications were needed.  1.  Made a spreadable cream cheese mixture (2 pkgs, soft cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, enough milk to make spreadable).  2.  The blueberry sauce is too sweet, gave me a toothache.  Cut sugar in half and use flour/butter to make sauce instead of cornstarch.  I don't like the sheen cornstarch gives to food.  3.  Added 1 tsp cinnamon to egg mixture.
Thank you for sharing - it's a keeper!!!

I made this for our Christmas brunch and it was delicious! I made one using Italian bread cubes and another using gluten free cubes I cut from baguettes. As others recommended, I mixed the cream cheese with a little confectioners sugar and cream and added some additional blueberries. The mixture was enough for both of the casseroles. My family said they would not have liked the full amount of cream cheese for just one of the casseroles.  I will not be making the blueberry topping the next time. With the additional blueberries that I used, the topping was unnecessary.  We will be having it again next year for sure!

Love this recipe. I made it pretty much according to the plan. The only changes: less cream cheese (about 10 oz) and less eggs,  I forgot the butter in the sauce however it was plenty rich enough. No need to spread the cream cheese on the bread (just let is soften before putting it in spoonfuls on the bread), I did NOT double the sauce or add extra sweetness, no need to - it was perfect!

It comes out super yummy if one catches the mistakes and fixes them. Like How the directions call for 2 cups of blueberries (see "remaining 1 cup of blueberries) but the ingredient list on lists "1 cup fresh blueberries."

This stuff is amazing! My mom gave me this recipe and I decided to make for Christmas morning. At her advice, I cut the eggs to 10 and doubled the syrup. My husband does not like blueberries, so I made a peach syrup instead. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely make again!

Made for company on 12/24/17 - YUM!!  Only changes I made are to add 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar and splash of light cream to the cream cheese (used the 2 full bricks), whipped in the mixer.  Also used MORE blueberries in the casserole.  Next time I'll use the idea of loading the cream cheese into a baggie and 'piping' it onto the bread cubes.  I did use an Italian bakery loaf and let it sit out for a bit before putting all into the baking dish.  Made a double recipe of the syrup, which was really a LOT - only drizzled a bit over the casserole and then served it alongside for people to add their own.  Next time spray the  aluminum foil with cooking spray so it doesn't stick to the bread.

I followed the recipe as given. My family loved it. I did too. I still prefer the savoury breakfast dishes. This was a very nice change.

Made it a couple of times. I use only one 8oz package of cream cheese.  When I first made it with 2 packages, I found the cream cheese overwhelmed the blueberries.

Made it with a loaf of French bread.  Whipped the cream cheese with 1/4 cup confectioners sugar (as recommended in another review). Also made with frozen blueberries. I only put about half of the syrup on the French toast. It was really good without being overly sweet. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my husband's staff meeting at work, so that they could give me feedback as I plan my holiday menu ahead for Thanksgiving and Xmas. It was a HUGE hit at my husband's work, where 15 employees gave it a thumbs up and wanted the recipe. I will definitely be added it to our holiday menus, along with a grits casserole and sausage links for a large group. Thank you for sharing! 
Here is a listing of a few minor updates I made, gathered from reading some of the feedback notes posted by others.
- I used a full loaf of Italian bread, purchased from the grocery store bakery and not on the aisle bread shelf, that I sliced and cut up with a knife.
- I used 2 (8 oz.) pkgs of cream cheese, as noted in the recipe and based on feedback of other reviewers, I creamed it with 1/4 C granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1-1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice, creating a cream cheese filling and spreading it, dollop by dollop across the bread crumbs.
- I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries (4 cups total), in both instances where the recipe called for 1 cup blueberries. I also doubled the ingredient measures when making the blueberry sauce, including 1 tsp fresh lemon juice too. I spread enough of the fresh blueberry sauce across the dish, but not too much because not everyone likes as much sauce as others (I love LOTS!). I then packaged up the remaining sauce in 2 containers, 1 to be served with the dish for those who like extra sauce and the other to be stored in the refrigerator, served

Really good even when using gluten free bread. May use only 1 (8oz) bar of cream cheese as the family said it was really rich. Glad to have found something for Holiday breakfasts

It was very easy and guests took second helpings, which meant it was well liked.   It  was a cold, Wisconsin morning so the casserole was very much a comfort food.  
I almost skipped the blueberry sauce, but decided last minute to make and it was fabulous.  People used a little of that and a little maple syrup.
When I made it, as I was distributing the cream cheese, I thought one 8 oz. package was  almost enough so I only used a little bit of the second package.    Also, it calls for 1 Cup of blueberries, and to me you can never have too much fruit so I used a whole 12 oz. bag of frozen blueberries.    It really wasn't overloaded at all.  
I sprinkled some cinnamon & nutmeg on the first layers, then topped off with the remainder of bread, and finally the egg mixture.  I didn't measure the vanilla in the egg mixture, just dumped some in and I'm positive it was more than the recipe calls for.  

For the bread, I had a fresh loaf of French.  I cubed it all up and let it sit on the cutting board for a while to let it dry up a little......just did other things in the kitchen and came back to it later.  I  don't like soggy things so I figured this would help, and it did.  
Good recipe, easy to tweak to suit your individual taste.

Absolutely delicious with a few tweaks. I used Italian bread as suggested in other reviews. I sprinkled each layer of bread with cinnamon and added cinnamon and a dusting of powdered sugar to coat blueberries. I added 1/4 c of the milk to cream cheese along with 1/4 c powdered sugar to sweeten a bit. I only used 1 3/4 c milk in egg mixture. This was a real hit with everyone!!!

My husband prefers savoury rather than sweet, but he loved this breakfast dish.  I followed the receipe except I used Italian bread.  It worked out great.  Thank you for sharing the receipe and for all of the tips!

this one got mixed reviews at the breakfast table. It is yummy, but for the work involved, it did not get enough thumbs up. 
A good recipe if you like this kind of casserole.

We loved this!  And we loved the sauce even more :)  I made it to take to a lake cabin for a week's vacation with family and it only lasted two days.  There was leftover sauce and it was really, really good on ice cream!

So disappointed. I wish I read reviews a d suggestions prior to making this.  Way too many eggs and cream cheese doesn't blend well. My dish was complete mush. I did use French bread as well to be certain it wouldn't be soggy.

Made it exactly as the instructions.  I also served the sauce on the side   Was fantabulous!  My family cleaned it all up. Also took to a pot luck breakfast and got rave reviews. This makes a large amount but is easy to 1/2 the recipe.   Definitely a keeper

This recipe was not bad, but I would not make it again without several changes. The blueberries could probably be doubled, and the cream cheese halved. I assumed that the cream cheese, which was supposed to be cut into 1" chunks, would melt and spread. It did not; it stayed in salty little chunks. Next time I would add sugar and an egg to one 8 oz. package of softened cream cheese to make a cheesecake-like mixture, which I would drop by spoonfuls onto the bread layer. That would solve the salty little chunks matter. I also think that it could use some cinnamon or freshly grated nutmeg and lemon zest, since it was overall pretty bland and eggy. (I'll probably use 8 instead of 12 eggs too.) The blueberry sauce did not have a lot of flavor--just kind of a bland sweet without a lot of berry flavor (and I had picked the blueberries fresh--they WERE good.). I will either add more blueberries, or some lemon juice to brighten the flavor, or something--needs help though. The ingredients are good together, but I will really tweak the proportions next time.

This is fast becoming a special occasion / holiday favorite.  I will tell you that making it exactly as stated the first time out is probably a good idea!  Get a feel for the dish.  These are some things we have done and tweaked along the way.  I used some else's tip to freeze the cheese before I cut it. Amazing tip!  We have used Texas toast bread and French bread depending on what we have or sales, because thicker cut is best here.  A tiny bit of cinnamon with blueberries is never wrong!  We sometimes cut the cheese back by a half of one block,  but not more than that because one block in this huge dish isn't enough. And I always double the berries in the dish.  Seriously, if you have to ask why,  I'm not eating breakfast with you. And please, for the love, please use real maple syrup. That all being said,  this is an amazing recipe. Yes it is rich and not at all cheap to make,  but it's worth it those times when memories are being made around the food we eat.

I loved this! I ended up using a whole wheat french loaf, because it was on hand,. and added about a quarter cup of sugar to the cream cheese. Delicious with or without the blueberry syrup. My blueberry syrup turned out pretty thick. I may have over boiled it.

I made this when up visiting my parents. It was blueberry season and a friend brought us a large bowl of blueberries.   We cut the recipe in half but used the full amount of blueberries and made the full recipe of sauce. It was a huge hit!  We used the left over sauce the next day on pancakes. Thanks!

It turned out like bread pudding...but I followed the recipe to the letter. I will try making it again but this time with some of the modifications suggested in the comments and maybe it will be better. Will comment again when I do.

I listened to other reviewers and adjusted this recipe a bit.  I used Italian bread instead of day old bread with crust (as a reviewer suggested).  I also whipped 1 1/2 bricks cream cheese w/ 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and spread it over the cubed bread. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) and only 10 eggs (as a viewer suggested).  I found that I could have used a bit less egg when baked as it was a bit 'mushy'.  I had frozen blueberries that were picked by hand during the summer frozen, so those worked well.  I omitted the juice from said blueberries in fear that it would add too much liquid to the mix.  I will be making this again; however trying 8 eggs instead of 10.  I made this for Christmas morning and it was incredible.  However, I have a daughter who wouldn't eat it because of the wetness of the final product.

Perfect for a special occasion breakfast or brunch. I make it a practice to try new recipes 'as written' the first time through, but this time I couldn't. I love cream cheese as much as anyone, but 2 8oz packages in this dish is too much of a good thing.  Just use 1.  My guests and I all agreed that it would have overpowered the dish.  Blueberry sauce on top was great!

This is great! My husband loves it! But it tastes best if eaten the same day it is cooked - the leftovers get really mushy.

Loved this recipe just the way it was!! I tried this on my large family during a family reunion and it was an absolute pleasure!  I did, however, use egg whites rather than eggs and bakery prepared croutons to simply and cut out a couple minutes. It was awesome!!! Will make again!

This dish is to die for! We made it for our "breakfast for dinner" night, but it could easily be served as a dessert...oh so delicious! Both my daughter and I went back for seconds...and it's even better the next day! Love, love, love.

Fell in love at first sight with this recipe!  Read  the reviews and incorporated some of the suggestions when I made it: Added 1/4 c of milk and 1/ c of confectioner's sugar to cream cheese and stirred it over a low heat long enough to become a pouring consistency. There was a small amount of syrup left over in the bottle and I added it to the blueberry syrup rather than throw it away. Sprinkled an extra 1/2 c of blueberries on top of the French toast before baking it. I did reserve the syrup and served with both blueberry and maple syrup, as someone suggested, but I won't do that again. The blueberry syrup is the  crowning touch on this recipe.  The two batches I made were consumed by 18 people. Served it with 4 lbs of bacon, but guests would have eaten more if I'd had it.

Super easy.

I didn't bother past the overnight thing (no extra sauce or sugar). 

I added 1+ tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkle of allspice.  Worked out great.  Ate if for a week.  I will make it again with different fruit.

I cut the recipe in half and it would easily feed 4-5 people. I might cut back on the cream cheese as it was kind of rich even with one block. I also used really thick bread. I added Ceylon cinnamon (teaspoon) sprinkled on top. Overall it was easy to make, tastes good.

I cut the recipe in half since i was only feeding 2 people. It was delicious. I used fresh blueberries since we had a ton of them. Leftovers were good but fresh out of the oven was the best. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is very good & easy. Not too sweet. I added more water to the blueberry sauce, as it was much too thick for our tastes.

The only change I made was to make it larger. I fed 200 hungry campers with this last Oct in FL. Super easy to make & it was very well reveived. I used chibata bread because that is what I could get as day old.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was to add strawberries because it was 4th of July weekend and I wanted red, white and blue. Everyone loved it. I will be making this again soon!

I made this because our neighbor gives us eggs and we had a lot! The whole family loved it, including a 5 year old and 3 year old. Made for a delicious, filling hot breakfast with little effort on a busy weekend morning!

Followed the recipe using thick cut French bread.  Cut the cream cheese into small dice size pieces and added extra blueberries.  Agree needs to add some cinnamon next times.  I served without the berry sauce and it was delicious!

My husband loved it.  It was easy to make and can be easily adapted.   One thing I've done with similar recipes is to substitute pound cake for the bread and swap out some of the milk for Rum Chata or Tres Leche liquor and serve it as dessert.

It was good but next time I would only use half the cheese it was asking for and instead of all water in the syrup I would do half water half Jack Daniels Tennessee honey whiskey half water.

I cut the recipe in half and used a 4 by 8 glass dish. It took about 50 minutes to bake. I omitted the cream cheese but it still turned out fine. The blueberry sauce was excellent!  I made more of it a couple days later and poured it over store bought lemon pound cake. Yum!

I have made this three times and each time it was a winner.I did modify the recipe a bit.  I used day old french bread but cut off the crust. It takes about 18 c. of cubed bread. I only used 8 oz. cream cheese.  I used blackcaps the last time and I think you could use many different kinds of fruit. I also added 1/2 t. cinnamon and a little nutmeg to the custard. I had half n' half in the house, so used 1 c. of that and 1 cup of milk.

Perfect recipe for a Holiday like Christmas morning!  Make it the afternoon before, kept it in the refrigerator, and just popped it in the oven when ready.

Rich, delicious, fruity, a real crowd favorite and now an annual tradition for my family!

Just a small recommendation to either have a cover or screen of some sort on the blueberry drizzle/glaze when cooking.  If those blueberries pop on you, that stain is a lifelong reminder of your great breakfast of Christmas 201x...

Made it for the first time and I followed other recommendations when it comes to cream cheese. I whipped it instead with 3/4 c confectioner's sugar and a little bit of milk then spread it on top of the bread before putting on the bluberries, and since I used 2  8oz cream cheese, I have some left overs, so I pread it on top after adding the layer of bread and then top it with bluberries before baking it. Also I don't have any maple syrup, so I used honey instead, came out very good. I also cut down the sugar on the syrup, instead of 1 c, I used 3/4 C, not too sweet. Overall, very good! Will make this again.

I have made a very similar recipe for 30 years.  I found it in the Dallas Morning News.  I started  substituting  croissants for the French bread after the first time I made it.  The recipe I have, calls for another layer of cubed cream cheese on top, and 1 cup of maple syrup.  A couple of years ago I started putting blueberries between the layers.   I will have to try the blueberry topping next time-looks delicious.  I have also put thinly sliced apples between layers and cinnamon.  Just had it yesterday for company - it may be awhile before I have it again - very rich!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  I did use French bread, and would agree with everyone else that a "stiff" bread (unlike a regular loaf of bread) is the way to go with this recipe. The only changes I made were 1) I added cinnamon to the egg mixture 2)I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of each of the 2 bread layers 3)I poured a little of the egg mixture over the first layer of bread, but most of it went over the top layer as directed.  I did not add any sugar to the cream cheese, and it definitely didn't need any! The syrup is plenty sweet on its own. My husband and I made this together, we both loved it, we will definitely make it again!!

Made this french toast for my kids to eat every morning.  They were NOT fans.  Two wouldn't eat it because they said there was too much cream cheese.  There also wasn't enough flavor.  Not enough berries?   Next time I would add cinnamon and nutmeg and use a lot less cream cheese... or skip it entirely!!

I have been making "overnight" French toast for years. The secret is two fold, hearty bread left overnight to firm up & custard made the night before. also, both grilling the toast and baking it as well. This recipe's ingredients work, but the cooking is different than mine. I set the bread on a cooling rack, make the custard & refrigerate overnight. I the morning,  dip the "stale" bread in the mixture 30 sec. on each side, set on cooling rack. Then, add to a medium heated pan, flip when done, add butter to both sides &  place on cookie sheet pan & place in 350 oven for 10 minutes.  Add your cream cheese & filling,  dust the outside with powdered sugar & cinnamon if desired.

This recipe is not the best as stated because it has way too much sugar.
I did use the stated no. of eggs and I did use 2% milk instead of whole milk.
I added only one quarter cup of pure cane sugar to the cream cheese, beat it til smooth and spread it on the blueberries.
My blueberry sauce is incredibly fresh tasting and not loaded with sugar.
I use fresh blueberries, add lemon juice and only enough pure cane sugar to make it slightly sweet but tart.  I add about 2 Tbsp cornstarch for 3 cups of blueberries.
The amount of sugar people use for fruit sauces and/or desserts is astounding to me.  They are so incredibly and sickening sweet.  Not to mention, sugar is creating a huge population of obese Americans.
Sorry, don't mean to be so blunt but the amount of sugar people put into their recipes is gross in my opinion.
This breakfast treat with a tart, fresh  blueberry sauce on the side is fabulous.
Fresh i s the key.  If you don't have fresh blueberries, make something else.

I made this recently.  The recipe was just slightly different but almost the same. I did decrease the cream cheese to just one brick. It was awesome.  We really loved it  and I will definitely make it again.

I doubled the blueberries, and I used plain old wonder bread, which I toasted lightly. Next time I'll take the suggestions from the other reviews, throw in some cinnamon (maybe even nutmeg)  and whip the cream cheese and spread it out. Regardless, it was delicious and potluck worthy and is a new favorite.

This was so easy to make.  I added the 1 cup of sugar to the egg mixture before I realized it was for the syrup.  But I am so glad I did. Also I used a whole loaf of sourdough bread. Husband and I both loved it.

Before I start, I should mention that I made this at my boyfriend's, which means a general lack of kitchen items. I tried to make it as similar to the recipe as possible, but I didn't want to buy cornstarch. So I decided to forego the sauce altogether and just use syrup. It turned out pretty well! If I make it again, I would use less cream cheese- maybe 1 1/2 packages.

This was very tasty yet a little soggy. Next time I will cut the cream cheese in half. Also, I added a bit more syrup. Next time I shall add a bit more. It was very easy to make. I love over night dishes!

I made this for Sunday family brunch. I only made a few changes to cut the fat content. I used eggbeaters (the equivalent of 10 eggs), low fat cream cheese substitute, and wheat bread. I also added a few teaspoons of lemon juice to the sauce. It was delicious!

I used gluten-free bread and it came out very well. Used a loaf and a half because gluten-free bread is a bit smaller than regular bread. I used frozen blue berries with no problems. I will make this recipe again but I'll double the amount of blue berries both in the casserole and the sauce.

I was hoping for a sweet cream cheese center but after baking it, the cream cheese was still in its blocks and wasn't sweet at all. And the egg mixture wasn't very sweet and also didn't provide enough liquid to really make the bread into French toast...it was pretty much just toast with cubes of cream cheese.

Better than I expected, I would cut the cream cheese into smaller pieces and I added bananas in the sugar mixture just to add some different flavor. Also 1/2 the sugar in the top layer and I only added 7 eggs as opposed to 12.

I made this for my Mother-in-law and friend and it was a hit!! We all loved the Blueberry sauce to pour over the  the bread mixture. I only had one loaf of french baguette instead of two french breads but it all worked our great. I had to cook it a little longer for the cream cheese to melt as much as I wanted it to melt. Everybody loved it!!! I can't wait for the next guests to come to make it again and change it up a little. It's a must have recipe.

I'm rating this a 4 because I did make changes. I did add 1 tablespoon of milk to the cream cheese along with 1/4 cup powdered sugar. This sweetened it and made it creamier and easier to spread. I did 10 eggs just because. 

It was very good. My husband and most of my kids  (I have 7 and you can't please them all) and I liked it.

No.  This recipe is seriously lacking.  First of all, it's ridiculously enormous.  Half this recipe will feed at least 6 people.  Secondly, it is lacking one key ingredient necessary for French Toast... CINNAMON.  I had to add cinnamon  - before, during, after...  Thirdly, TOO MUCH SUGAR!  Just yucko.  On the blueberry compote, you could use 1/4 the sugar and twice the blueberries and 2 tsp. of lemon juice.  I had to add at least 1/2 cup of lemon juice to cut the horrid sweetness and give it some actual flavor!  This recipe would be better served without the cream cheese and skip the compote altogether and use syrup when served.  If you have taste buds, this recipe will be seriously disappointing to you.

With a couple of the changes I read in the reviews, this is 100% a keeper. I creamed the cream cheese (12 oz not 16) then put it in a zip lock bag, snipped the tip and swirled it on the bread cubes.  I used 2 cups of berries in the bread and 1 cup in the syrup.  My large eggs weren't very large but I used 11, added a dash of lemon juice and cinnamon  to the egg mixture because I'd forgotten to sprinkle over the bread :) it really was quite easy to put together as I'd printed out the recipe and made my changes on paper. I also used my plastic 9x13 pan lid so I could occasionally flip my  mixture a couple of times to disperse the egg mixture to the top layer of bread cubes.  Little extra things made a huge difference.

I made this as written, using a few tips from the reviews. It seemed like a good idea, but it came out poorly. Even the kids wouldn't eat it. It tasted like cream cheese topped with blueberry topping. The blueberry topping was delicious, and I used my leftovers for pancakes, but I wouldn't make this one again. Sorry.

My moms belated Mothers Day breakfast. She loved it, gave it ***** and said everyday is a Happy Mothers Day?
I baked for an extra 10 minutes; added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and a few drops of squeezed lime to the blueberry sauce....yum!

I made this as written for a Mother's Day brunch.  It was delicious and I didn't use any special bread, just what I had on hand, and didn't have any problems. My family absolutely loved it! I will be making it again in the very near future!

Big time kid pleaser!  Made a 1/2 recipe, and it was delicious.  Definitely recommend a light bread, though.  The bread in this recipe provides texture, but shouldn't be overly flavorful, imho.

Don't bother making this recipe.  I was disappointed with the turnout.  The bread is crusty on top, the cream cheese doesn't melt like I thought it would and it calls for 12 slices of bread and it could have been 9 slices.  For the cost and effort next time I will make regular french toast and pour blueberry syrup on top.  Oh well, you discover some great recipes and some are not what was expected.  Sadly this only deserves 2 stars.

I made this for Sunday brunch exactly as and it written and it was delicious. My husband ate about 4 servings just himself and that was unusual.  I was at first thinking using a sweeter bread like Hawaiian bread would work great but I used a french loaf I had on hand and it was perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness in this recipe for us.

I was worried this would not taste as good as it looks! It's better. I did add about double the amount of blueberries just because they're awesome. I was also concerned about two blocks of cream cheese as it seemed like a lot. It's definitely not to much. This will be going into the special breakfast rotation! Thanks.

After reading the many reviews, I decided to make this. It was just ok.  Turned out a little soggy but I did cream the cream cheese with powdered sugar so it would be spreadable but probably added a little too much milk while whipping it. Maybe try heavy cream instead of milk. I'm glad that I took the suggestions of others and added the powdered sugar to the cream cheese and cut it in half. I also added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  Needed a lot more. I also doubled the blueberries. It was kind of tasteless to me but smelled nice while cooking. The blueberry syrup on the stove was a whole other story. Delicious!  Can use that on anything. I normally don't make changes to these recipes based on the reviews because after all, a recipe is a recipe for a reason.  I'm glad that I read the reviews but not sure that I would make this again.

So I made this before reading the top comments. I split the recipe in half because I just made it for me and my husband. I used regular wheat bread, and I should have used French bread because my version based on the original recipe was too soggy in the middle. Also, I cut up the cream cheese into the one inch cubes and layered them. However, they still didn't seem to bake into the bread mixture; they were still chunky. So next time I'm going to let the cream cheese soften a bit and then spread it onto the bread layers. It does need more blueberries. The blueberry compote mixture made on the stove turned out great. I'll make some changes next time I make this.

This recipe was a great basis for this casserole. I did however make a few changes that made all the difference including adding cinnamon, lemon zest, nutmeg, and vanilla. I also used a loaf of brioche that I toasted in the oven to dry it out a little and halved the reciepe which was enough for my family.  The sweetness of the brioche was a great balance to the cream cheese and fresh blueberries. It only needed real maple syrup which I mixed with blueberry jam and butter. Great after the changes.

Since there are only two of us, I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for two meals and then some. It makes for a very tasty breakfast, though a bit rich with the cream cheese.

I did a half recipe of this French toast but still a full recipe of the blueberry topping. It was all amazing. I don't like how some overnight casseroles are too mushy. This one is not!  I will make this all again and maybe for dinner!!

This is very yummy. Everyone said it was like eating blueberry pie for breakfast. So obviously it's quite sweet. I followed the advice of others and added powdered sugar to the cream cheese-probably a big reason for the sweetness. If you don't want it as sweet then follow the original recipe with no powdered sugar added. One person used only 10 eggs so I did 11 eggs which is completely sufficient. And I definitely agree that a hearty crusty bread has to be used, otherwise a regular sandwich bread would pretty much disintegrate. Side note: when I made this it was for Mother's Day brunch and there were only 5 of us. Because of the rest of the brunch menu and because of the sweetness,  each person had only one serving of this so there was quite a bit of leftovers. I've put it in the freezer and we'll find out later if it'll be the same when I take it out to finish off for the next event.

My husband made this for Mother's Day at my request. We halved the recipe, since it was just the two of us. It was soggy and not that flavorful. For the two of us, real blueberry French toast would have been easier and better. Sorry!

I took the suggestions from some of the other reviews and used a hearty Italian bread and added cinnamon to the layers.  The dish turned out to be absolutely decadent!!  Everyone loved it and it is definitely going to be my "go to" breakfast dish for guests and even just for us as a special treat.

This was so delicious and very easy but you have to leave an hour and a half in the morning of non-active prep time to let it get back to room temperature from the refrigerator and bake it. No sleeping in!

Made this for my wife as Mother's Day brunch and she - we - loved it!  Cut the recipe in half (just two of us) but followed the recipe precisely. Wonderful for brunch, and we had the remainder for dessert the next night!

Since I used a whole loaf of bread since I did not have a sliced loaf I thought it was a bit heavy on the bread... woukd have liked the receipe to indicate the bread amount in cups.  Also the cream cheese never totally melted.  It was good but not great.
I will try it again but with adjustments.

It came out Great! It was easy to prep and was a homerun success at Mother's Day brunch! I cut the amount of sugar in the blueberry compote and think it worked out well, due to the natural sweetness of the blueberries.

We loved this recipe but  would like the cream cheese to melt more. I think I would soften and whip it first. I'm going to try this with croissants.

So delicious! I had left over homemade Greek bread from Easter. It is very dense bread and it worked great! I halved the recipe but still was a lot! I also added some cinnamon to the liquids. Very simple and great for a crowd and brunch! I will make this always to impress!

This is a first for me:  I'm usually so happy with the recipes I use from AllRecipes  This was absolutely awful.  And yes, I made it exactly per the directions...for a Mother's Day breakfast and it was a bust!  All you could really taste was the cream cheese.  If you do make it, I suggest you cut the amount of cream cheese in half.  But, the bottomline is - the mixture of the eggs, blueberries, and cream cheese sounds like it should be tasty, but it was not.  Five of us ate it (kind of) and all five of us did not like it.  It went down the garbage disposal.  It was that bad.

This was absolutely to die for! Everyone raved about it. I took one reviewers suggestion and sprinkled cinnamon over the initial layer of bread cubes and it made a huge difference as the cinnamon flavour was delightful. This is an impressive dish that gets everyone talking as it is sooooo yummy. Thank you.

My wife is a French Toast aficionado ( me, not so much) so I thought it would be the perfect surprise brunch for Mothers' Day. I served it poolside -- and she was floored. I was especially pleased with the fact that I had every ingredient on hand. The recipe is clear and simple, with lots of room for improvisation. I served it surrounded by sliced strawberries and blackberries, and topped it with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.

Not an experienced male cook. I followed step 1, and before I realized , in step two I mixed all the ingredients into one bowl. Everything on the list. Well I just poured it over the bread , which was French, and blueberries and cream cheese. It came out great for Mother's Day. Just needs to cook an extra 20 mins. Couldn't mess this one up if you tried. ????

Enjoyed the final product with many revisions based on previous reviews. Decrease eggs. Use sturdy bread. Decrease sugar in blueberry syrup. Use mixture of whipped cream cheese w powdered sugar and milk instead of cubed cheese. Add more blueberries. Flip prior to baking to decrease sogginess. Add cinnamon and nutmeg, and add lemon rind and juice to syrup.

I made it pretty close to the recipe the first time around.  It tasted really good but was a bit soggy. I used a loaf of brioche but next time I will use an Italian crusty bread, less eggs, and put cinnamon between the layers like other reviewers suggested. A lot of people complained about the chunks of cream cheese- I really love cream cheese and liked it being in chunks so I wouldn't change that. All in all a good recipe and a keeper!

Made this for a work brunch and it was a hit! Made it with the following modifications: I thinned out the cream cheese with some milk and sweetened with some powdered sugar and spread on the bread cubes, I used a loaf of bakery Italian bread. Added more blueberries, and doubled the sauce, when making the sauce I cut the sugar and added sone lemon juice. Really delicious!

I made this recipe 4 times bigger to feed a whole lot people at a camp, and it was a hit. Instead of fresh berries with cornstarch, warmed jam was used. I havent tried it with the fresh berries, but it would probably be better because in my opinion the jam made it too sweet. And it "could" be bland without  of spices having like cinnamon and nutmeg to it.

I will make it again.  I used all organic, bread, cream cheese, blueberries, palm coconut sugar, the milk! I have to say when you uncover to bake additional 25 to 30 minutes, I would just do 20 minutes. Greased my pan with melted butter covering.

I used very stale French bread and cut the recipe in half. I wish I would have read more of the reviews. I thought the sauce was way too sweet with no pizazz. I should have put more blueberries in and lemon juice. Is the cream cheese supposed to melt? I had clumps of it everywhere, did not melt, just softened a bit. I would also use more b.berries. Not enough. Maybe that would have cut the sweetness. Lots of calories and sugar. I won't be making this again. There just wasn't any wow factor.

I made this as the directions stated and would not change a thing. Very good crowd pleaser that helps simplify the mornings when guests are over or when blueberries are in season. I used the blueberry syrup on this site over top since I had extra on hand from picking.

I've been making this for many years; got the recipe from a B&B owner in Eureka Springs.

Always a crowd pleaser and yes, as easy as it seems.  Great for having an elegant brunch when  entertaining weekend guests .

I  was intrigued but the idea of overnight French toast but while reading the recipe it looked more like bread pudding of which I am not a fan.  I hope I'm wrong though.

I've made this a few times now, and of course I changed it.  I always do, mostly because I have to use what's on hand. Im not running out to the store just to get that one item I didnt have in the house... like blueberries. But I did have peaches, canned, then well drained and mashed a bit with a ricer.  Then of course, I looked at the cream cheese... nope, no way was cream cheese going to work with peaches. Soooo - I opted for some whipping (heavy) cream. and with a bit of peach syrup left over from the can that i saved from the night before....  but i didnt want it so .. well eggy.. so i decreased the eggs.. I also noted my bread wasnt really dry enough even though it was two day old - so the liquid helped there..I ended up using 8 eggs.. , but I think you'd have to check the dryness and the  consistency of your bread after adding the egg and cream... and make up your own mind on how many to use.. cinnamon and brown sugar for the peaches of course and it was good to go in the fridge.  In the morning,
I noticed that the eggs kind of pooled a bit at the bottom....  I thought that might create a kind of layer of egg... so I flipped it into a new pan and let it sit out while i got the oven going, the coffee going, the bacon frying... and then i made  peach sauce :) brown sugar, so used less, and less cornstarch, water with a bit of the peach syrup... Im looking forward to trying it with blueberries.. think I'll skip the cream cheese entirely - 
What a wonderful breakfast idea,

When my friend made it, I would give it five stars. My attempt I only rate at three. Why? Because the difference, as I found out, is that she dramatically cut back on the amount of cream cheese. I found it WAY too cream-cheesy and would suggest using half the amount.

Made it as written. With regular loaf bread it was a little soggy on the bottom. It was very cream-cheesy and definitely needs more blueberries in the middle layer.  Next time I will take others' suggestions to use french bread and whip the cheese with some sugar and spread it.  And I prefer my own blueberry sauce: 2C blueberries, 1/2C sugar,  1/4C water/juice, 1Tbsp corn starch, splash of lemon juice.

Made this several times and it's always a hit.  Nice that the bulk of the work is the done the day before.  I usually make double the sauce and still sometimes run out.

I made this using frozen blueberries. I also took the advice of another reviewer to use my hands to soften and spread the cream cheese.  I do not typically make sweet breakfast casseroles, preferring the savory ones with eggs and meat. This was a nice change of pace and made for a lovely dish on the Easter brunch buffet.

This recipe was so easy to put together and tasted terrific.   I made it for a brunch party yesterday and It took a little stress out of my day being able to prepare it the night before and just pop it in the oven.  I'm going to make it again next weekend for my Grandson's 1st communion, I'm going to substitute either blackberries or raspberries for the blueberries instead.   ??

I used half cinnamon, raisin bread, the one with powered sugar topping and half polish rye bread (left over breads) and only one package of cream cheese and fresh berries.  Friday evening layered bread, cream cheese and berries.  Mixed egg etc together in a separate covered container, refrigerated both. Saturday night poured egg mixture over bread, recovered.  Took out of refrig half hour to warm, then baked and served Sunday morning.  Delicious!!  Great ! make ahead recipe.

I make this every time I need to bring something for a brunch and on holidays.  I did find a way to make applying the cream cheese less irritating/messy.  I got a squeeze bottle ( the old style ketchup ones from the 70's) and with softened cream cheese put it in the bottle, cut the tip to make it wider, and was able to put the cream cheese on much easier, better coverage, less mess, it was a joy.  Just make sure the cream cheese is softened.  Tap bottle upside down to get more at the top for better use.

I made this with fresh strawberries. I followed advice of others and decreased the eggs to 10, thinned cream cheese with a little milk and added a bit of powdered sugar. I spread the cream cheese on slices of challah bread, then cubed. My berries were sweet so when I made the syrup I didn't add maple syrup. This recipe is good but my guests enjoyed the edges and corners the most and the center was firm but still a little soggy. Next time I think I will mix the base up as directed and then bake the mixture in muffin tins to give it more crunch.

I've been wanting to try it and finally got around to it today. I used 6 large, cubed Costco's croissants that were 6 days old in leiu of french bread. It was AMAZING! All my guests and later, my kids loved it. It was easy to prepare as well.

Made it for Easter brunch. Per others suggestions I used a loaf of Italian bread rather than sandwich bread. I doubled the blueberries. It was a hit with everyone!

I gave this 4 stars because of the bread.  Found this recipe on Pinterest.  It called for CHALLAH Bread.  That sweet, braided loaf really enhanced the flavor. I cut it with an electric knife which made short work of the task.  It is so worth the effort of seeking out that loaf of bread.  Try grocery stores with their own bakery or a regular bakery you can order from, it's well worth it.
Make this, it's an awesome recipe!

This was a perfect addition to our Easter brunch!  So easy and super delicious.   It got rave reviews from everyone.  I followed the recipe but just used more blueberries than it called for because our family loves berries!  Other than that addition, I wouldn't change a thing!

I prepared the recipe exactly as directed.  It was a huge hit!  I had several people go back for 2nds and 3rds.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to make the sauce that goes over the top, but it was really easy!

This is a wonderful breakfast casserole for brunch or for a special occasion. For two people, I halved the recipe for the French Toast, but made a full recipe for the sauce. The only changes made were (1) I used slightly less cream cheese than called for, and (2) I added a small amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture before pouring over the bread cubes. I will make this again, probably many times. It's sweet, but oh so good! If you are making the full recipe, I highly recommend making a double batch of the sauce. It would be wonderful over vanilla ice cream if you have leftovers!

Delicious!  I think everyone went back for second helpings.  I followed the recommendation by others to whip the cream cheese with some confectioners sugar and milk for easier spreading.  I'd definitely do that again, otherwise I made as directed.  I put the blueberry sauce into a pitcher so people could pour the amount they wanted onto their serving.  The sauce was worth making (easy and so fresh tasting!).

Big hit with company. This was a super way to use up old French bread. Also made an extra pan with artisian bread and it turned out great. I used frozen, drained blueberries with success. Lined pans with parchment paper for miniscule cleanup. Definite REDO!

Our absolute favorite overnight breakfast dish! I've used fresh and/or frozen blueberries. I've also used frozen triple berries.  The blueberry compote is a must have. 
A great travel dish to bring to share with co-workers, friends, family-but don't let this sit too long, you will want to eat this soon after coming out of the oven.

Outstanding! This dish turns out delicious, and is fairly simple. I followed the tip about slightly freezing the cream cheese block and using a cheese grater to shred it over the bread- what a helpful tip! I doubled the syrup and was glad to have done it- my MIL licked the serving container clean! I have made this a few times and am always pleased with the results. It makes the house smell delicious while it's cooking- definitely makes it hard to wait the entire baking time!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was an easy recipe to follow. I felt like the dish was a little dry and the bread didnt cook down enough also the cream cheese didn't melt into the dish like I was expecting. It had great ingrediants so the taste was good but it would have been dry without the extra blueberry sauce on top...
I'll try it again and tweak it...

This is really good! I put cinnamon on each layer of bread and I put maple syrup and blueberries (frozen) in a pot, brought it to a boil, added cornstarch and let simmer then added butter.

We really enjoyed this!  And leftovers the next day were equally as good.  Some very minor suggestions that we employed: used 1.5 blocks of cream cheese instead of 2 and cut into smaller chunks.  Topped whole casserole with generous amount of cinnamon right before baking.  Yum!  Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it like the recipe and found that the actual French toast was a bit dry  and the cream cheese didn't melt well. Next time I'll cream the cream cheese with powdered sugar and thin it with milk to a spreadable consistency. The sauce was outstanding,  though.

Amazing!!!  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on both layers of bread, nice little personal touch. My kids loved it. Simple and delicious. I used fresh Italian bread and it absorbed all the egg batter. I totally should have taken a pic. It doesn't last long

I halved the recipe, but followed it exactly to see how it was before I stated altering things.   The basic recipe came out more like a bread pudding  which in itself was still ok.   Loved the blueberry syrup.   Overall it was an OK recipe but had too much cream cheese for my husbands taste and I  would probably make it as a dessert rather than breakfast.

I softened the cream cheese,sweetened it a bit and dropped spoonfuls  instead of the cubes. Took it to our camping family reunion and it was a big hit. I mean a big hit. I'll probably make 2 pans this year.

It really is fine as is, however the suggestions about which bread to use would be the first thing I'd change. To make it easier, you *could* get a jar of blueberry pie filling, but it wouldn't make it better.

Karan1946, thank you for sharing this recipe.  I have made this recipe numerous times, the family loves it. Changes made: did not add the blueberry sauce on top, as suggested (too sweet for my family). Used hearty whole wheat bread, cubed and left out  24 hours (before assembling ingredients). Increased(frozen) blueberries to 2 cups. Substituted 8 oz of feta for the cream cheese. Generous amount of cinnamon. While baking: cover for 45 minutes,  uncover for 15 minutes.

Husband loved it; even my adventurous kid did not.  I think its the name that's misleading.  This dish has a ton of protein and is rich and filling.  But's neither French nor toast.

Great recipe! The sauce as written is a little too sweet and could use more berry flavor.  I did make the blueberry sauce as written, but now wish I had followed the advice of another reviewer to cut the amount of sugar by 25% and add at least 50% more blueberries.  All in all, this recipe will not disappoint .

what happened to the maple syrup? - on the grocery  list but not in the process !  I used whole wheat sub roles instead of bread and I added Chambord to the syrup.  Fantastic.

OMG!This was amazing! I had it as a dessert since I'm not much of a breakfast person.
I took the advise of some reviewers. I sprinkled the bread with cinnamon and thinned the cream cheese with a little milk. It spread much better  this way. I used homemade French bread from this site and it tasted like cake! It also had a creamy custard taste that was divine .The blueberry syrup perfect, use more for dessert a little less for a breakfast, it was very sweet.

Great dish to start the new year.   I made slight modifications after reading other reviews.  I used 12 oz of cream cheese with a couple shakes of cinnamon,   powdered sugar and milk for easy spreading; 10 eggs.  The blueberry sauce is delicious.  I will use this for the grandkids next visit.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe.  My only change was to use Italian bread.  I wasn't sure about the "day old" part, so I left the slices out for a few hours and that turned out well.   I thought it was a little bland and too "eggy" but still, I'll give it 4 stars.

Made this for a brunch! Very good... lots of compliments ??. After reading reviews, the changes I made are:  used loaf of French bread, added cinnamon,2 cups blueberries, (mixed cream cheese, 1/2 cup of the milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla & one of the eggs with mixer until smooth and put in ziplock bag cut corner out and piped on top of bread then used offset spatula to smooth out). Worked like a charm!

Unbelievable!!! Soooo delicious my family LOVED it I did take the advice of other reviewers and used Italian bread,  reduced the cream cheese to 1 1/2 blocks and whipped it with some milk to make it spread a little more evenly, only used 10 eggs,  and I even did half blueberry and half of the pan strawberry and then sprinkled some cinnamon on top it was a huge hit!

I made this as a test since this seems a nice recipe for company. I cut it in half, used cinnamon, and french bread. Husband liked it, I thought it wasn't bad, but I found the top very dry, and the bottom a bit soggy. Next time I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion...to soak all the bread first before assembling. I'm also going to change up the cream cheese, mix it with an egg and sugar and then drop dollops on top of the first  layer of bread and blueberries. The recipe is good with a few tweaks.

So delicious and it can all be done ahead - just make sure you have enough time to let it rest for 30 minutes, then bake. This recipes makes a generous 8 servings, so you can save extras for another day, when it's just as good.

I think from now on I will make recipes as written!  I followed some reviewers and used 1 block of cream cheese and 10 eggs, and it was dry (not all bread got saturated).  Right before baking I had to drizzle heavy cream over it which probably saved the dish.  The blueberry sauce was divine!

I made this for family for Christmas brunch.  I used French bread that was past its due date so it was not fresh and added some cinnamon to the top prior to baking.  I did cube the cream cheese in to what I thought were small enough pieces but I found that during the hour of baking time....it all had not completely softened as I had hoped.  All in all it was a true success and it did not last long.  I will be making  this many many more times and will not be surprised when  I have requests for it !!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Really  super easy to make. The one thing I did change was that I only used one and half bricks of cream cheese.  It was too creamy  with the full amount.

Made this for Christmas morning and was almost in tears - at 1 hour of baking the egg-milk mixture was still liquid, had not begun to cook into custard texture. But 40 minutes later, it was perfect. I made this recipe following directions almost exactly. Changes I made - used multigrain crusty loaf, a fairly dense bread. Add some nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg-milk mixture. Only used 8 oz cream cheese, which was plenty. I used Stonewall Kitchen's Blueberry syrup instead of making it myself - don't need even more work on Christmas morning. Changes I would make in the future - more blueberries in the center. Cut the cream cheese into smaller pieces - 1 inch is too big and creates a lump in the middle and no cream cheese flavor in other parts. Recipe itself as given needs work, but overall was a big success. Just allow extra baking time just in case.

Was pretty good for an easy dish. I bit eggy though. I'd do it again with 9-10 eggs instead of 12.

Made this for Christmas morning breakfast with the family.  I used a heavy stone ware pan and had to bake it an extra 20 mins.   So be sure to check you center is set.   I also added vanilla and a dash of salt to the blueberry topping it gave it an extra layer of flavor.   My family loved it.   I will be making again

I made this a couple of times. It was good each time. I changed it up the last time by dusting the top with cinnamon and sugar and it made a big difference. The crowd loved the change. I recommend the cin and sugar.

I LOVE this dish!  I've made it twice now and it's great every time.  I'm gluten free so I use gluten free white bread.  I toast it first and it's come out great each time.  I have to admit I think the sauce is far too sweet (for my liking) as written so I used a half cup of sugar this time and it was great.  I might actually use a quarter cup next time and I think it would be even better.  Regardless, this is absolutely delicious.  I will make this for years!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe, my wife and I first had this dish in 1998 at a B&B in Big Bear, CA. The host provided us with a copy of the recipe that has long-since been misplaced. I was thrilled to find this recipe online. My family loves the dish - as do my in laws. This year, my daughter wanted to use challah instead of french bread. It was great - just slice and the challah into cubes the morning you're going to prepare the receipt and let it sit in a bowl to dry out a bit.

I made this exactly as written. I thought it was bland and soggy and my husband thought it was too sweet. Something this bad for you should be delicious and irresistible! Instead I think we'll be tossing the leftovers unfortunately.

I will absolutely  make again.  I did make some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers. I added the lemon zest and juice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  There was a lot of egg at the bottom of the pan, so I may try to soak the top layer of bread in the egg mixture to make sure its gets a good amount of it and them add it to the top.

This was delicious. I thought it might be too sweet but it wasn't. The amount of bread used really cuts down on the sweetness. Good for a big crowd!

Made this exactly as the recipe states, using a round of Italian bread I had that needed to be used. I like to follow each recipe before making changes. It is delicious. My entire family enjoyed it Thanksgiving morning. It's been requested for Christmas morning. Read the previous reviews and made notes when deciding to make this one. I'm guessing it will be even more delicious with a little less cream cheese (unless you and yours love cream cheese) and some confectioners sugar mixed into the cream cheese as another reviewer suggested. It is so good as is that I can imagine it is out of this world with that change.
I have guests who ate seconds and asked for the recipe. Thank you for sharing this.

11.2.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15057/overnight-blueberry-french-toast/ ... While I did change the recipe, I'm rating the french toast part; ya know, the main thing.  ;D  I used 10 eggs, as reviews suggested; added a bit more vanilla; only 6 oz cream cheese.  Surprisingly, wasn't thrilled with the cream cheese addition - especially since I was thrilled using  it in another recipe.  'Maybe those that suggested sweetening it were on to something.  I don't remember if I sweetened the preferred recipe I mentioned.  Or, maybe the syrup in with the egg mixture makes that big of a difference.  'Still glad I tried.

This was delicious. I made two pans, one with Udi's gluten-free bread and one with sliced Italian bread from the deli. Everyone loved both. QUESTION: Do you pour the blueberry syrup on top of the casserole? I served it on the side. Does pouring it over the casserole make it too "soupy"? And if you pour it on, when do you do it? When it is still warm?

Loved it!!! So Yummy! I would go with the previous suggestions and use a little less cream cheese. Use 10 oz only.  Use Italian Bread keep it covered even longer and maybe cook for almost the full 60 min. It was amazing! Will be a staple recipe in our house!

Very delish and super easy to assemble.  Only change I made was to cut the cream cheese into smaller pieces so that the cream cheese was better distributed.  Our brunch guests enjoyed it!

This was great!  I used frozen blueberries and doubling the amount was almost too much.  The only cream cheese I had was frozen and grating it worked awesome!  A new trick I will use in other recipes I'm sure.  The cream cheese grated in this added a creaminess that wasn't obviously from cream cheese.  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the layer and on top and used sugar instead of any maple syrup in the egg mixture.

I love this recipe for brunch with large groups. You can prepare the night before and just pop it in the oven in the morning. I make the glaze and serve it on the size. It is a crowd pleaser!

It came out really soggy  in the middle, put it back in the oven and baked it longer which did not help. Nobody would eat it.

It was too eggy for my liking, even with the eggs reduced to 10 from 12 as per review suggestions. I read the reviews and was hoping for something perfect. Maybe my expectations were too high? On the other hand, the blueberry sauce was delicious!!

Followed the suggestion of thinning the cream cheese with some milk and spreading it over the bread cubes.  Also used a loaf of Tuscan bread that was nice and firm.  Brought this to a brunch and it received "rave reviews"!

Perfect, since it's an overnight recipe and quite easy to make.  My kids made it for me as a surprise a long time ago for Mother's Day.  I loved it and keep this recipe handy.

Would definitely make again!  

Followed a few tips from others...and I'm glad I did.  Have had to be gluten free for over 20 years now.  Finding good French or Italian bread is hard and pricey, so I used a regular loaf of gluten-free white bread.  Cubed it and felt the dozen eggs would be too much.  Dropped eggs down to ten and only used about nine.  Also reduced milk accordingly.  When I started to compose the dish, my concern was that due to bread selection a baking pan would be too big so I grabbed my covered casserole dish and carefully put it together.  Only used 1 and 1/3 box of cream cheese cubed small which I thought was plenty.  Added the nutmeg and cinnamon to the top per the suggestion of another reviewer.  May mix it in next time.  Allowed another ten minutes  for baking d/t the density.  Turned out beautiful!  Proofed up like a souffle', which tasted like  an awesome, decadent French toast.  Great for presentation.  When I went in to take off the cover after the first 30 minutes it had already proofed up, lifting the cover right up.  

Sauce, eh, I've had and made better.  Didn't care for the addition of corn starch. Also added the fresh lemon juice, which gave it some life.

Will definitely be making this again.  A great presentation dish that will wow your guests. ..a great dish when you want to have a nice breakfast that doesn't tie you up all morning...love make-ahead dishes like this!  

Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Eh. My husband didn't like it at all and I thought it was just okay. Regular ol' french toast with blueberry syrup or jam is better.

What a wonderful breakfast casserole. I like to have a little maple syrup on the side in addition to the blueberry sauce. I made this over 24 hours in advance, and it turned out perfectly.

Had used palm sugar instead of m. s. and only used 1/2 of sugar in sauce (would have been wayyyy too sweet) and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Only used 1/2 amt of cr cheese.  Also, only used 1/2 amt of blueberries in base, since the bread I used was Weston's blueberry bread.  Served it with whipped cream, which I thought made it too sweet (had added too much sugar to it). Yogurt was very good with it.
Everyone loved it.

I have made this a few times now and my whole family just loves it.   I always have wild blues in the freezer and they work beautifully in this.  I didn't change a thing, but why would I?  I used a loaf of Italian bread from WalMart, which made it a very economical dish too.   Kids and grandkids ask for this one.

Ate at b&b in Bryan, TX. I'd increase cream cheese to 1 1/2 bars and add 1 1/2-2 c blueberries to recipe. (Id use stale French bread as advised).I'd serve homemade syrup instead of the blueberry syrup in recipe as it had little flavor.

It was really tasty! I would definitely make it again...maybe with strawberries next time. Everyone at work and my husband thought it was great. I did have to bake the casserole for an additional 30 minutes because it was very soupy/uncooked in the middle and recovered it with tin foil. I plan on making this for holidays or work potlucks in the future!

This was a HUGE success at my breakfast party this morning! I did make a few very minor changes from the recipe. I used an Italian loaf of bread, diced and toasted. I took note of the reviews complaining about huge chunks of cream cheese, so I cut one 8 oz. pkg into a very small dice and sprinkled that around.  I doubled the amount of blueberries both in the bread mixture and in the sauce. I cut the amount of water in the sauce to 1/2 c and added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce. If I ever need a blueberry sauce/syrup, this will be my "go to" recipe. I did not pour any of the sauce over the bake but served it separately in a bowl. The bake and the sauce looked yummy! I can't wait to make this again! Thank you!

I read all the reviews prior and the main complaint was inconsistent moisture issues - some say too dry and others too mushy. The key is to make sure the lower level of the bread is somewhat stale, dry or slightly cooked so that the layers do not become an off -putting mush. That and of course cooking it long enough. As far as the dryness, I altered the recipe by increasing the cream cheese mixture by an additional 1/2, and I created a brown sugar and cinnamon glaze for the top using 1/2 stick of butter (melted), and eyeballed the brown sugar to add just enough just keep as a viscous liquid without the presence of butter, and added cinnamon to taste.  It turned out great. Good luck.

I would make it again, and again.  This was very good and could also be used as a dessert.  It is pretty light and airy and leaves you still feeling good after eating (vs. weighed down.)
At first appearance you might think not enough blueberries, but it's just right.  I might suggest using cubes on the small side. Yum!!

Have made this three times and it is excellent. I used a loaf of Italian bread that I cubed myself. Would be nice to know a total number  cups bread, rather than slices. I think the loaf was more bread than the original recipe proportions so I pressed down the bread before adding the egg mixture to help with everything soaking up the bread and also helps to make it easier to cut.  I also used more than 2 cups total blueberries - doubled to 2 cups layered in the casserole and doubled to 2 cups in the sauce. Seems this would be dry and with much less flavor with any less blueberries (but I also likely used more bread). I softened the cream cheese and beat with about 2 tablespoons of milk so I could make it more of a spread across the bottom layer (otherwise the cream cheese will never quite melt and mix into all of the servings). I sprinkled cinnamon across the middle cream cheese/blueberry layer. And finally added about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to the syrup.

Love this recipe.I made this recipe for company for a July fourth  brunch. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe except I did put the cream cheese in the food processor with 2/3 cup of milk to make it easier to spread. I also doubled the amount of syrup which I found out later I hadn't need to do as I had syrup left over(I served it on the side) I absolutely will make tis recipe again.

I wish I had made the following changes (others said the same, but I never like changing anything before making the recipe "as is" first. I would've either skipped cream cheese or tried freezing/grating it because the blobs did not melt/mix and were therefore unappetizing.
I also wouldn't poured the blueberry syrup over everything  - instead I would serve on the side. Once those eggs turn blueberry-purple, it's not nearly as attractive/appetizing (looks kinda gross, actually). Overall the taste was pretty good but not outstanding (mixed-in cream cheese might've helped).

Yum, Yum, Yummy!  Made this for 4th of July holiday weekend. Turned out perfect. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some powered sugar to the cream cheese along with a little milk to make the cream cheese more spreadable. Spread that onto french bread slices and made "sandwiches" which I then cut up into cubes. Layered half my cubes, fresh  blueberries then the remaining cubes. Topped with the egg mixture and refrigerated overnight.  Cooked as directed. Perfect amount of sweetness for my families taste buds.

Very good. Ours needed to cook much longer. I added cinnamon to the top and added more blueberries. Next time I would use a whole loaf of French toast bread instead of only 12 slices.

For my first attempt, I made it exactly as directed, and I'm confident it turned out like it was supposed to,  a French Toast custard casserole. Unlike other reviewers, I would not reduce the egg, but I used an entire day old sourdough loaf, so I had plenty of bread to soak up egg. I would, however, consider creaming, instead of cubing, the cream cheese, as some folks suggested, for better distribution. I probably wouldn't add sugar, in fact, I would probably omit the maple syrup next time, because it didn't sweeten it up, and I prefer adding syrup or jam after it comes out of the oven. Mmmm.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I varied a little from the recipe.  I used less cream cheese and mixed it with a little milk and icing sugar to spread over the bread cubes.  Next time I might do as another reviewer did and that's to put the cream cheese in with the eggs, etc and pour it altogether over the all the bread cubes rather than layering it.  I also had to add thin down the syrup with a little water, maybe half a cup actually.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone.  Delicious.   Some of my guests had seconds at brunch this morning. It's great being able to prepare it the day before.  Would make a great dessert anytime.

Made it gluten free and it was delicious! No one (even my son who always makes fun of gluten free foods) knew the difference. I used Uden's cinnamon-raison GF bread and just baked the cubed bread for a few min in the oven to crisp it up a little before putting together. I made  one recipe with apples and one with blueberries, and everyone actually preferred the apples. I didn't change anything otherwise, but did cut up the cream cheese into very small cubes (and added a little cinnamon to the syrup). Oh...and I doubled the sauce and put some on top and some on the side. 
Thanks! I'm sure it will become a tradition!

I spread the cream cheese between slices of bread before I cut into small pieces - more evenly distributed in my opinion.  Have made it several times and I'm always asked for the recipe

Made this for my daughter's bridal shower and everyone raved about it.  It looked beautiful and tasted just as good.  After it cooled I cut it  in squares, put it in a chafing dish and then poured the blueberry sauce over it all.  It was a bit hit and I loved that it could be prepared ahead of time.  Can't wait to make it again and it will be a go to recipe when needing a breakfast or brunch dish.  I love this site!!!!

This is a signature Sunday breakfast dish from a small local diner.  The owner was generous enough to share the recipe with the public, and it is WELL worth the effort.  However I have a few strongly-suggest tweaks.  First, use more blueberries!  Two cups is about perfect.  Also, I use only one brick of cream cheese, and just pinch it into much smaller pieces than shown in the video (more like a quarter to a half inch).  That way, you get the flavor and richness, without getting a whole mouthful of what tastes like molten chalk.   I also give the top of the casserole a light brush of melted butter after removing the foil for the second half of the baking time.   That adds great color, crispness, and richness to the top crust.  And finally, the blueberry sauce needs a LOT of work from what's shown here.   First, add the cup of blueberries at the start, so they can cook in with the sugar, water, and cornstarch, to release their juice (aka, flavor!).   Then add a second cup of berries at the end, after the sauce has thickened.  For brighter berry flavor, I also suggest putting a tablespoon of lemon juice into the measuring cup before filling the rest of the way with water,  A scant pinch of salt helps too.   Those tweaks help elevate this dish from "pretty good," to absolutely fantastic!  It's been our go-to for a special occasion breakfast for years.

I was hosting a relatively large group for breakfast and made the blueberry French toast.  To say it was a hit is an understatement.  Everyone raved about it.  I followed the recipe   &  didn't make any changes except I used frozen berries vs. fresh.

This was rich and delicious and gorgeous to look at. The cream cheese needed to be cut up finely, maybe shredded or grated as others have said. I used a mix of berries instead of just blueberries, adding blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, and it came out perfectly. Highly recommended, will make again.

I will definitely make this again.  The only downside I encountered was it took the 2 bars of cream cheese and I didn't have any more to make anything else for the weekend. XD. I also added 2 cups of bluebwrries instead of 1 cup.  It made for a very good Mother's Day breakfast.

I have made this twice now. It is very easy to make, feeds a large party of people and most of the work you can do the night before which is what I prefer to do so I am not trying to entertain and cook at the same time. The second time I made it I used 2x the amount of blueberries vs what the recipe called for. My brother and I love blueberries and you can't have too many. It is sweet so not for everyone. Both times it came out great and everyone loved it. I did use sour dough bread slices and cooked in the oven for around 20 minutes at 275 to make "day old bread". I served it with bacon and scrambled eggs for those with not a sweet tooth. I will definitely continue to make this for special breakfast parties/holidays.

Delicious! I made this for an annual family spring brunch and everyone loved it. I substituted fresh blackberries for the  blue as the grocery store was out of blueberries. When making the homemade syrup I strained it to remove the berry seeds. While some reviews noted not all of the cream cheese was needed I beg to differ; I used it all but first whipped it with some powdered sugar as I knew the blackberries were a bit more tart than I wanted them to be. I also used Italian bread . I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again.

This was a delicious recipe!  I give it 4.5 stars overall.  I love these types of casseroles that can be made the day before so there is minimal work the next morning.  With that being said, I didn't prepare ahead of time for this, so I made it the morning of.  Overall I went by the recipe except a few changes.  I only made half since it was just two of us.  I cut down one of the eggs(5 eggs to half the recipe) and needed to still bake a few minutes extra since it was very liquid-y still after baking an hour.  With these types of casseroles, I add in some sugar to the egg/milk mixture because I like it a bit sweeter.  I also double the maple syrup.  Instead of cubing the cream cheese, I soften in the microwave and spread it over top of the bread cubes.  The blueberry syrup for the end was delicious and for my tastes I added more sugar as well with a splash of vanilla.  The blueberry syrup is delicious and great to make to serve with pancakes, waffles, etc!  Overall this is something that I will definitely make again.  We really enjoyed it!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe for blueberry and strawberry this morning and both flavors got rave reviews from my brunch guests. I used Texas toast and added 2 more eggs to the egg mixture to compensate for the extra bread and made sure to push down the entire bread and fruit mix in to the egg mixture before placing in the fridge overnight. Based on other reviewers feedback, I spread the cream cheese on to the bread before cutting and placing in to the pan, the cream cheese was consistent throughout the dish, rather than globs here and there. I did make extra sauce for the French toast, one blueberry and one strawberry. It was a great dish to go alongside the vegetable frittata and mimosas that were served. I will be making this again.

I used challah bread to make the dish and it really made a difference. I cut up a loaf and let the bread sit out to dry and get that "day old" texture.  The bread took up the liquid and and baked up beautifully.  I took this to our Easter brunch at our church and it quickly disappeared. This recipe is a keeper!

This is beautiful and yummy! I followed the recipe exactly because I do not feel that I shouldn't make comments on a recipe if I don't follow the instructions. However, I forgot to add the maple syrup to the egg mixture, so I just poured the syrup over the top after baking. And I served the blueberry syrup on the side.  I used Italian bread from the bakery and that worked well. Next time, I will definitely add more blueberries and less cream cheese, but that's just my personal preference. The recipe is great as written. I even enjoyed this cold the next day. I will be making this again but not too often because it is like having blueberry cheesecake for breakfast.

My family loved this!  It's a keeper for Easter brunch.  I made it with strawberries as blueberries were not available.  I can't wait to make it with blueberries.  I did what others recommended and used 2 cups of strawberries in the middle.  we like fruit and next time will use 3 cups to see how we like it.

I made this last night for a potluck at my church.  I followed it exactly and wouldn't change a thing, except maybe make more of the blueberry topping.  It disappeared quickly and I could hear the comments on how delicious it was.  I will definitely make this again soon.

Great, skipped the blueberry syrup.  This could be made with almond milk, leave out cream cheese, use whole grain bread and still be wonderful!  Made 1/2 recipe in smaller rectangle pan.

Wow! It looked good but it tasted FANTASTIC! The only thing I did differently is that I used Italian bread, as other reviewers noted, and I only had 8 eggs on hand. Next time I will whip the cream cheese as others suggested and pour evenly instead of doing the chunks. Delicious! One of my new go to brunch recipes for sure!!

Very disappointing. I am perplexed as to how many positive ratings this got. There are way too many blobs of cream cheese that do not melt down, the dish ended up very soggy, despite extra baking. I could go on, but I have to make another breakfast.

This is delicious and I will definitely be making it again! I am definitely a beginner and this was easy enough for me. I followed the suggestions to mix the cream cheese with a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a tiny bit of vanilla to make it easier to spread over the bread. I also used vegan cream cheese and it still tasted great. I agree with others to only use 10 eggs instead of 12 and to double the amount of blueberries. Double the batch of blueberry syrup.

I just made this for Valentine's Day breakfast and I was disappointed. Mine wasn't cooked all the way, there were runny egg whites still. So I put it back in and the bread on the bottom was still soggy. UPDATE - I let it cool completely and it solidified up, so the bottom was less soggy. Then I just topped with maple syrup. It was pretty good that way.

This is really good. It is not overly sweet. The sauce does bring a little but it's not an over powering sugar "bomb". I used reduced fat cream cheese and real maple syrup. Also added a sprinkle of powered sugar.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe for a brunch at our community.  It was delicious!!  I should have read the reviews first, though, because I made the recipe as is & had to tweek it at the end.  The middle was not done, even after I had raised the temp by a few degrees & cooked it longer.  I took it out, mixed it with a spatula, and cooked it an extra 10-15 min.  By doing this, the cream cheese was spread throughout!  I made the blueberry syrup & poured it over the top when it was done.  I love the fact that most of the work is done the night before.  I will definitely make this again, when we have out of town guests,  so I can visit with them instead of standing over the stove making breakfast!

I made this for Christmas morning brunch.  I was never much of a cook until I became a stay at home mom and wife.  In the year and a half since my cooking skills have grown significantly. However, my mother-in-law always found a way to politely decline anything I cooked.  We agreed to do Christmas morning at our house this year instead of moving two small children to her house.  I made this, hopefully to impress, and it pulled through with rave reviews! Even other family members were asking for the recipe at our extended family get together that night.  This was voted the official Christmas morning dish, and...my mother-in-law now never turns down to try my dishes!

The cream cheese didn't melt as much as I would have liked, but it was still delicious!  I coupled it with smoked sausage, eggs, and baked red potatoes with sliced red peppers.  The sweet and savoring went very well together.

Close to the recipe my cousin gave me.  Turns out amazing with my home made Challah egg bread! Have made it without the overnight step and is still a killer casserole! Cinnamon and nutmeg kick it up nicely too.

I made 5 casseroles Christmas morning. I thought this one was the surefire home run. I was wrong. I made the recipe exactly as written, didn't check out other reviews beforehand (I should have). It tasted good but had a strange texture. The cream cheese cubes did not melt so they were a little strange looking and the bread was way too soggy. But, this recipe has potential and with some tweaks, I can see it being a home run. Next time, I will use more substantial bread and I will follow other reviewers' suggestions and cream the cream cheese.

EXCELLENT  We loved this. Christmas morning 2015.
EASY to make. I did not make sauce for lack of berries.
Still great. We thought with cream cheese and maple 
syrup ,it was like blueberry bread pudding.

I made this New Year's Day morning and it was a hit - soooo good!! 

I made two changes, and I've seen these mentioned in other reviews: I used a whole loaf of French bread rather than regular sandwich bread so it would hold up to the weight of everything else, and I used thawed frozen blueberries instead of fresh - which gave it an extra blueberry punch with the juice.

This will be made again, and I likely won't wait until next New Year's Day!

Used a whole loaf of Italian bread, cubed.  Used 2 C. blueberries for filling.  Creamed 1 1/2 pkgs. cream cheese, enough milk to make it more speadable and a small amt. of xx sugar.  I put the cream cheese mixture in a baggie and cut off the corner and piped it over the 1st layer of bread, then took a knife and spread it around a little more.  Used 1 c. skim milk, 1 C. fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  . I added the syrup but could probably leave out.  Only used 9 eggs, no problem.  I cut back on the sugar slightly also.  After pouring milk over top and to take my hands and push bread down so it was all soaked by the milk.   Everyone liked it.

Yum.  I used almond milk, made 1/2 the receipt in an 8x8 square pan, and didn't have any bread so I used whole wheat bagels, which made it hearty and crunchy.

Thought it was great!!!  Only change I made was to blend some confectioners sugar with the cream cheese, & I decreased the sugar & water for the sauce.  Felt 1 cup of sugar was going to be way to sweet for me-I was correct. The sauce was perfect!!!!!  Will definitely make again, probably once or twice a month.

I've made this twice now and I will most definitely make it again! The first time I made it as written, but made one and a half times the sauce. It was delicious but very rich; I found myself trying to dodge the cream cheese bits. So the second time I used a half brick of cream cheese only, and cubed it pretty small. It was perfect for us when served with a little whipped cream that we had left over from Christmas. I would use one brick maximum and always make extra sauce as other reviewers suggested. Yum!

I made this for a houseful of folks over New Years! Fantastic. Highly recommend it! I only used half the amount of cream cheese, and sheoherd's bread! SO SO GOOD! Not one bite left on any of the plates (there were 8 of us)!

I thought this was more of a dessert than a breakfast dish. I will make it again because it was delish. I took the advise of some blended comments. I used Italian bread an left the crust on.  I soaked the bread in the egg mixture (only used 10 eggs)  to make sure all the bread got some because I also blended the cream cheese with some sugar and spread it over the first layer. (it was a little hard to spread but with patience not impossible) I felt that the eggs wouldn't have soaked through the solid spread of cream cheese and that's why I soaked the bread first. I used more blueberries as well, enough to cover the dish because well...who doesn't like more blueberries. I also served the topping on the side rather than over the dish this way people could use more or less according to their liking. It was a hit!!!

My family did not enjoy this dish and I would not recommend it. It had too much egg flavor and the chunks of cream cheese was not a hit. The sauce was very good but without it this dish would have been flavorless.

I made this recipe but used wheat bread crust cut off cubed for healthier version & almond milk in place of milk. I whipped the cream cheese with a few bluberries & a bit of honey.  Before serving, I also kept most of blueberry sauce on the side, maybe drizzling just 1:8- 1/4 of entire sauce on top before serving. For fun, We put a can of whip cream next to this dish  for those that wanted a creamy inhancement. A big hit, especially  with a few picky teens  & we will make it again!

Loved this recipe just the way it is. Made for Christmas breakfast and I am making again for New Years Day breakfast. I will make the full recipe this time instead of a half. Also bacon on the side. I did use Italian bread instead of regular bread

I have made this twice now.... it's AMAZING!!!   I used a loaf of Italian Bread to make the bread more dense.  To avoid the bread being dry I increased the ingredients in the egg mixture.

I was hoping to make this a Christmas brunch tradition, but I probably won’t try it again.  The sauce was too sugary sweet and the dish had an odd and somewhat-soggy texture to it, certainly nothing like French toast.  Overall, it was quite bland (even with my addition of cinnamon) and unimpressive.  Blueberries are too pricey to use on a dish with ho-hum results at best.

I served this dish Christmas morning and my family  loved it. I  know it is not an everyday type  breakfast because of all the fat but occasionally I would indulge. I  also used the Italian bread suggestion instead of regular bread.  To  add  to an already decadent dish, I  offered a Boston-creme to top it off, the topping sent an already fabulous breakfast through the roof.  This was an instant hit.

I made this for my kids and their extremely picky-eater children. My grandson was the first to taste it and proclaim how good it was. They cleaned their plates down to the design so I'm calling this a resounding success! A few revisions to the recipe: neufschatel cheese instead of cream cheese, skim milk, and sugar free maple syrup. AWESOME - thanks for the keeper!

I made this for Christmas Eve morning and it was fantastic!  I didn't have enough blueberries to make the syrup so we used maple.  
The only change I made was rather than have cubes of cream cheese, I simply put everything in my Vitamix blender, mixed it all together and poured it over diced cubes of ciabatta rolls I had in the fridge.
So good the next day too!

I used partridge berries bc thats what I had, instead of blueberries. I added 2 mandarin oranges & served it on Christmas morning. It went over really well & the beautiful deep red berries looked right festive. I added about 1/4 c of OJ to the jam, & used brown sugar. It was lovely. Will do as gifts for next year!

5 stars because you get a great dish that's easy to make & it's filling! I made this for Christmas & I will be making it again for our visitors over NEW Years. My family loves sweets & I was surprised not one person needed extra syrup. I will try a few diff things like using 10 eggs (first time my bread loaf was huge) & adding 2 Tbl lemon cake mix (my husband's idea) to enhance blueberry flavor. I did use cinnamon like someone else recommended, and ill do that again. I will cut the cream cheese smaller next time.

I made this for breakfast Christmas morning. It was delicious and everyone loved it.  I too made a few adjustments after reading the reviews.
I used 1 1/2 blocks cream cheese, added a splash of milk,  1/4 cup of confectioners sugar and small splash of vanilla and beat till blended.
I dropped small dollops on top of the bread pieces (I used Texas Toast bread) and was  able to spread it pretty well. I started with nine eggs but needed more.  I cooked it a little longer than the 1 hour. Would  highly recommend this .

Family loved it right away, but later decided we should use less cream cheese.  Maybe about 12 oz. instead.  I also cooked it for 10 extra minutes to make sure the center was completed done.  Could be an extra 15 minutes.

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast.
We thought it was very good.
I did make a couple of changes after reading other reviews.
-used 12 oz. of cream cheese, mixed it with 1/4 powdered sugar & some vanilla 
-used 2 cups of blueberries in the dish
-the sauce I used 2 cups of blueberries, 1 1/2 cups of water & 2 Tbsp of butter - other ingredients stayed the same amounts
-added cinnamon to both the egg mixture & sauce 
We will have this again!  It it very easy to make the day before & just stick it in the oven the next morning.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was really good.  The syrup was really really good.  The only bad part is you don't get to eat it for a few hours as it has to sit for 30 minutes and then bake for a least another hour.

This has become an expected contribution at my family annual Christmas breakfast.  This year I used Strawberries with a touch of lemon zest.  It was fabulous!  Here are a couple of my additions/changes to a great recipe.  I used Texas Toast instead of regular bread.  I saw the idea of adding french bread, but honestly, I found it to be a little heavy and more like bread pudding.  The Texas toast seemed to be a great choice.   I also added a 2 tablespoons of sugar to the egg mixture, since it is like french toast batter, I do the same for my regular French toast.  When you add the berries and syrup at the end it really is already sugary, I don't like things overly sweet or it would just become a dessert instead of something for breakfast.  All and all, this is a great recipe and after you make it a couple of times then you can expand it to suit your tastes.

What a great recipe. It took a little longer in the oven then stated in the instructions, but it turned out wonderful.  The kids are asking for it each weekend. This makes a big breakfast morning a lot easier.  Served with cantaloupe, bacon and sausage.

Made this for breakfast this Christmas morning (2015)  I agree with other reviewers who used a more robust bread and increased the amount of blueberries.  I, too, sprinkled some cinnamon over the first layer of bread cubes.  This is a fantastic recipe and was enjoyed by all.

Made this Christmas Eve night. My family loved it for Christmas morning breakfast! I live in AK so fresh blueberries weren't an option. I used frozen and it turned out perfectly. When you defrost the blueberries pour out most of the excess water.

Very rich and not tasting like French toast in the least. I was expecting a different culinary experience. I also thought the cream cheese would melt in a bit more but it was too much like eating chunks of cr cheese. I doubt I'll make it again.

Christmas breakfast--great dish but I will tweak it next time as the blueberry sauce was a bit bland; may try lemon OR cinnamon like other cooks suggested. Could use double the blueberries in between the bread layers. We found the dish a bit dry so added maple syrup along with blueberry sauce when serving. Cream cheese solution: here in Greece they only sell cream cheese "spread" (not bricks) so I was able to spread the cream cheese onto the bread very easily.

This recipe is fantastic!  We've made it two years in a row for a large family holiday gathering (feeds 12 people, as long as you're feeding them other things too) and it's a crowd favorite. The first year we made it exactly as written and thought it might have had a little too much cream cheese; we used about 1 1/3- 1 1/2 this year instead of two full bricks. It's only a slight change, but was delicious and brought out the other flavors versus having a lot of cream cheese in every bite. We also use an Italian crusty bread. Yum!!

Made half a recipe in an 8x8 pyrex.  Made according to directions except had a little less than 8oz cream cheese.  Used 2 spoons on room-temp cream cheese to drop it onto bread (not cubed), like dropping cookie dough.  Used sliced sheepherder's bread from Costco.  Didn't use all the syrup.  Delicious and rich as written; good contrast between creamy, fluffy, and sweet.  I wouldn't make any changes next time (also tried with cinnamon and would not use again).

My husband was impressed with this dish. But first I have to say this dish was so so easy to do.  I used cranberries instead of blueberries because that's all l had at the time.  I was a little worried that the tartness of the cranberries  will over power the whole dish but with cream cheese - it was a perfect balance. This dish will definitely be in my rotation of menu.

Made this for the first time and it was a hit. I hadn't read any of the reviews prior to making it so will make some adjustments for the next time. You know it's a hit when your pan is empty and everyone wants the recipe!

I was looking for an easy brunch type dish. I followed the recipe exactly and wish I would have read the suggestions first. I liked how the recipe wasn't overly sweet, but the cream cheese didn't meld into the flavors of dish and so you ended up with hunks of it in different bites. No one really bragged about it. We ate the leftovers for a few days but ended up throwing the rest away.

Didn't have all of the cream cheese so I used marscapone with just a touch of cream cheese.  Added powdered sugar to it and stirred until soft so it spread easily over the layer of bread cubes.  Added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  Like other suggested, added lemon juice to the blueberry sauce mixture to cut the sweetness a little.  It was a hit - will definitely be making this again.

This is the BOMB!  I used Pepperidge Farm sourdough bread, added cinnamon to the egg mixture and used 2 TBSP of vanilla, and doubled the blueberry  syrup.  I also used half of it on the dish and used the leftover for extra to pour one your own serving.  This is perfect for a special breakfast in bed on the weekend.  Just pop it in the oven in the morning.

My sister made this when I was in elementary school (28 now) and it was my absolute favorite dish!! I love French toast anyway, so this was perfect! Now that I'm older and I have a son of my own, I wanted to make him this too. It's just as delicious as I remember. I'm definitely keeping this recipe to continue making it. ??

A friend gave us a couple of loaves of homemade bread.  She said she likes to use it for French toast.  I remembered having this at a brunch years ago.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!  

Another review mentioned leaving the syrup on the side.  I like the option of each person sweetening their portion to suit their own taste.

I'm making this breakfast for a second time this morning, Sept. 6, 2015, for me & friends. 

I made it the first time for my wife & me, & my daughter's family. It's so good! but you need a good-sized breakfast group because it makes a lot of food, even when you adjust the recipe for fewer serving sizes.

There is a lot of potential there though and I will try it again. I'll need to figure out how many cups of cubed bread to use as there seemed to be too much bread for the custard mixture.  My family didn't like biting into the huge pockets of cream cheese - it was rather overwhelming - so I think I will also cut 1/2 of one brick of cream cheese into 1/2" cubes then blend the remaining cream cheese into the egg mixture. I did use a family favorite homemade blueberry syrup - which always surprises me with its deliciousness and was an asset to the dish.

Followed the recipe pretty closely. I used some Italian bread from the bakery for the bread. Next time I make this I'll probably want to leave out any crust. The crunch of the crust just wasn't doing it for me. However, this dish was amazing. 

On a side note, be prepared to have quite a bit leftover when making this. I should have used less ingredients but went all the way with it.

I made this recipe two times during the holidays. Great recipe. I did made some changes as suggested by other reviewers. I used Townsend frozen blueberries from Sam's club and thawed into strainer then when making the sauce, added it back in. I doubled the sauce. One for the table for extra yummy topping. I also divided up the cream cheese. Layering bread, cream cheese, blueberries and then again. In the winter I would suggest taking it out of the refrigerator a little longer and make sure oven is fully preheated.
.... .Perfect!!

Use Italian bread. Also, I like it better in a deeper dish. I've made several times. Also tried using fresh peaches with raspberries instead of just blueberries. It's delicious.

This recipe was PHENOMENAL. The only substitution that I made (against my will) was that I subbed Sugar Free Log Cabin syrup for the maple syrup. The person whose house I was staying at didn't have maple syrup. Everybody raved about it, and went back for seconds. I also went off recommendations from previous reviewers to use french bread, so I used two loaves. I would absolutely make this again.

We had this for breakfast on Memorial Day. I used leftover hamburger buns and hot dog buns for the bread. Followed the rest of the recipe as directed. It is very delicious and our entire family loved it. 
I highly suggest that you start blueberry syrup when you take cover off for last 25-30 min of baking. Gives you plenty of time for the blueberries to burst. Oh n don't forget the butter at the end!

Very good.  I made a few changes per others suggestions.  Ten eggs instead of 12 and used electric mixer for the cream cheese and added 1/4 cup powdered sugar to it.  My husband who doesn't like blueberries loves this.

Very sweet, may half the recipe. At least 30 min out of refrigerator before cooking. May need 40 min cook time to cook through center.  Topping is also great for pancakes or waffles.

We loved it!  I am one of those people who doesn't quite have the ingredients on hand so I either omit or sub for ingredients.  In this case, I did not have any vanilla extract but since it is mostly for flavoring I was willing to forgo it since the other ingredients compensate.  I also modified the sugar/fat content by reducing the sugar and cream cheese amount.   Also, could not let it sit overnight in the refrig.  Instead, I mixed all the ingredients together in a blender (cream cheese too and add milk to make it a bit more runny if needed).   Took the bread cubes (I used brioche) toss it all in together with the blue berries and popped it in my oven proof container and baked.

Tried this for the first time for a Mother's Day brunch. I followed everyone's suggestion to reduce to 10 eggs, double the sauce as well as use Italian bread. This came out fantastic. We did add in a side dish of homemade lemon curd which went very well. Everyone was so thrilled with the dish that I shared the recipe with all. Will make again and try other fruits.

I loved this!  I used 10 eggs and 1.5 pkg's of cream cheese.  I used good quality french bread and left it out for a day to get stale. I kind of used my hands and massaged the softened cream cheese into the bread.  I also made 1.5 times of the blueberry sauce, it really kind of makes it special.  I added some lemon juice to the blueberry sauce and it helped a lot.It is a rich heavy breakfast but delicious

I have tried this recipe several times, it was excellent. Everyone wanted more. Its definitely a nice treat for breakfast. I used canned peaches on mine. I also doubled the topping part of recipe. 

I will make it when family & friends come to visit us on vacation. I do occasionally make it on weekends for ourselves. Matter of fact making it today for tomorrow and making an extra one and freezing it. I think it will still be Ok.
I did put add the topping on top overnight, easier that way, no extra pots & pans in the AM. 

Try it you will be glad you did.

My 10 year old daughter made this with a little supervision.  We used vienna bread (like french bread) with good results.  It puffed up beautifully after we removed the foil! I would use only 8 oz of cream cheese next time and cut it into smaller cubes, maybe 1/2" instead of 1".  Served the blueberry sauce on the side.

I should have given this 5 stars, but the blueberries I purchased weren't sweet at all but real tart/sour.  I think had the berries been better the recipe would have been great.  The presentation was very appealing, and the flavor was great as long as you ate around the berries!  So taste the berries before you start!!!  I'll definitely try this again, when the berries are in season locally.

This was very delicious!! I made the following changes based on reviews. I mixed 1/4 c powdered sugar into about 12 oz of cream cheese, I increased the blueberries to 2 cups. 12 slices of bread was not enough (even though it was oversized sheepherders), so I cubed up the rest of the loaf and toasted it in the oven. Well, I got distracted and they ended up a cross between stale cubes and croutons, but I used them anyway, and you could not tell! This was very good. HOWEVER, I think you need to be careful with the quantity of sugar. Our blueberries weren't very sweet, so if you ate the casserole w/o any syrup, it was perfect, as far as sweetness goes. However, if you poured on the very, very sweet blueberry syrup, it was too sweet for everyone except for the kids! Edible, but sweet. When I make it again, I will NOT add sugar to the cream cheese, and I will use just 8 oz. It was a whole lot of cream cheese in the middle....about the thickness of a thick layer of frosting in the middle of the cake. For our family, just a little too gooey/rich. Bottom line...my advice, follow the recipe as written except decrease the cream cheese to just one pkg., unless you want a thick layer of cheese. You may need to increase your bread cubes, and you may consider decreasing the sugar in the syrup, depending on how sweet the blueberries are....the syrup is excellent, but VERY sweet.

Turned out well, though a little soggy at the bottom. Might cut back on some of the milk or eggs next time.  I used a brioche loaf of bread, which had a nice buttery flavor. I added more blueberries to the dish and doubled the sauce, though I don't think the extra sauce was necessary for the dish.  Added about a tsp of cinnamon & nutmeg and a dash of cardamom to the egg mixture.  Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the doubled syrup, and cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Next time I will either cut the cream cheese up smaller or spread it out over the bread more -- it just stayed in big chunks instead of melting like I thought it would. Overall, though, it was good.

This is a five star recipe if you add 1/4 cup powdered sugar to the cream cheese and sprinkle with cinnamon. Otherwise I made exactly as written. Just drop by teaspoonfuls on top of first bread layer. All French toast has cinnamon on it so that was a given for me. Used two small containers of blueberries. Put one cup on top of cheese. The rest (and I didn't even measure) I used in the syrup. 12 eggs. Real maple syrup. I pressed the top layer of bread down in the egg mixture so it all got covered. Baked in a convection oven at 350* for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. This timing came out perfect for my oven. Poured some of the syrup over the casserole while warm. Served the rest on the table for those who wanted more. Served with skinless smoked sausage for an awesome breakfast. This could be put together real fast in the evening if the bread was already cubed and the cream cheese mixed. I used about 16, 1/2" slices of store bakery French bread cubed.

My husband and I thought it was delicious. I did use a heavy Tuscan bread and I used frozen blueberries, strawberries and raspberries that I thawed first the sauce was great. I did double the sauce recipe like I had seen suggested. Will definitely make this again and again.

LOVED it! I kept the recipe exactly how it stated, including the amount of cream cheese, and it was fabulous. I did cut the cream cheese into smaller cubes, the sugar in the "syrup" does need to be decreased maybe down to 3/4 cup (?) for it was too sweet for our liking. I used regular whole wheat loaf bread. I just put the slices out on a cookie sheet to "stale up" and then used them that way for I refused to buy special bread for this recipe. My picky father even enjoyed this dish very much. We agree'd it could be for dessert due to the sweetness. My father put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of his, so I tried it...reminded me of blueberry cobbler/pie. I'll be making this again for sure!

I made this for Christmas day for a large group.  It was very easy and very, very good!  There is no need for extra syrup or toppings and leftovers made a great dessert warmed up and topped with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream!  I did not add anything or change the recipe. I cut the cream cheese in small cubes and "stretched" them to rectangles to cover the whole layer.  It worked very well.

This was a total hit for our Christmas brunch! I actually didn't expect the kids to like it because they aren't big on blueberries--but they came back for seconds. Used thawed, fresh Maine blueberries (which I'd frozen myself)...so much better than the big grocery blueberries--if you can get them, use them!  (Wyman's frozen blueberries are also Maine berries, if you can't get them fresh yourself.) I did take some of the suggestions of others and reduced to 10 eggs, dusted with cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg before refrigerating, and whipped the cream cheese with a tiny bit of milk and about 1/4 c. of powdered sugar so it would spread a little easier. Definitely need to press the bread into the liquid mix before letting it sit overnight, so it gets well sopped up. Served the syrup on the side, but it's definitely what makes this dish special, so don't forgo it altogether! This will stay on our rotation for a long, long time!

So yummy! Used less cream cheese, more fresh blueberries. Will experiment with other fruit - strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, banannas.  Also thinking banannas with peanut butter substituted for cream cheese.  Possibilities are endless!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was a total hit for New Year's Day brunch! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and whipped the cream cheese with milk and sugar so it would spread more easily. I also used a sprinkle of cinnamon on top of the first layer and would add some more to the top layer next time. I also reduced the eggs to 10 and doubled the blueberries. Can't wait to make it again!

This is the second time I've tried a French toast casserole and both have been too soggy in the middle! I've read that some people prefer these to be the texture of bread pudding, but I would like mine to be more firm. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, maybe it's the bread? I used sourdough this time because it's all I could find. Anyway, flavor was good but I personally feel it was way too much cream cheese. I agree with others that should be cut in half. Also less egg and it definitely needs cinnamon and more maple syrup. The cream cheese needs a different solution too. I like the idea of creaming it first like others  mentioned so you don't get big chunks of cream cheese. Good idea but this recipe needs some work.

The only reason I'm giving four stars and not five is the lengthy bake time. Pretty much became brunch instead of breakfast!! It was pretty good though. Better than I thought it would be. I cut the recipe in half for 2 adults and my three year old daughter(who actually ate it and even said it was good)! Hubby liked it and was busted attacking it with a fork later that night!!! I did alter recipe a tiny bit just by adding pecans that toasted up nice in the oven and made blueberry sauce not as sweet by adding 1/4 cup less sugar, a couple squirts of lemon juice and little cinnamon. I also used a little bit less cream cheese and cut it into smaller chunks.  I would like to make this again for a special occasion breakfast or brunch. Good one for something like that.

I've made this several times just as written with the exception of the bread, I use gluten free from Rudi's. It is amazing!! The sauce is perfect with this, and can be used on pancakes or ice cream. I recently took it to recipe club and it was a huge hit! The ladies wanted to know what, if anything I had done differently. They were very surprised about the bread in a good way I guess, cause they ate every last bite!!!

I thought this was great as written. The only change I made was using a loaf of challah bread. I broke it up and let it sit on the counter all day and prepped the rest before bed. It was delicious.

My 9 year old granddaughter and I made this for our family Christmas morning brunch and was delighted with the results.  We followed the recipe as stated except used frozen blueberries and probably used more than what the recipe said!  Everyone loved it and I was very pleased with being able to make it the day before and free up Christmas morning.
I will make this again with only one change and that change would be to use a little less cream cheese.  Regardless, it's a 5 star.

This was so easy, so forgiving, and so pretty.  I just used my own preference for content sizes and it wasn't heavy like some breakfast bakes can be.  Love that glaze on top.  Nice Christmas surprise.

Big Christmas morning hit. It took a little longer to bake than expected but everyone loved it. I beat a little lemon extract and 1/4 c. sugar to the cream to help compliment the blueberries. Great recipe!!

This was a hit at our house! After watching the video and reading reviews, it seemed it would be a good change from our usual Christmas egg casserole. We already had some wonderful blackberries, so i used them, with good results. i will do next time with blueberries which are hubby's favorite. Also, i added some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg. For our family, I only used one brick of cream cheese with the dozen eggs, and 1/2 c sugar in the sauce, knowing I could always add some. The sauce ended up still so sweet that I added about 2 1/2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice for brightness. That seemed just right and the sauce had gotten a bit thick anyhow. Next time I may only use 1 Tbsp of corn starch. Our family of six ate about half the casserole, but we look forward to leftovers. The sauce was served on the side to allow for personal taste. I can see making extra sauce to use on ice cream, etc.--it was yummy! Thanks so much for sharing--loved it and may have to always have it even if an egg casserole is also on menu. This time, though, I served with sausage links and patties and fresh fruit. Again, thanks!

I think this recipe is perfect...I followed the recipe to a tee and I think the only thing I would change is sprinkling cinnamon on top of the bread and adding another tsp of vanilla in the egg mixture along with adding either lemon zest or juice in the blueberry syrup.  I don't understand the other reviews where people are adding confectioners sugar to the cream cheese and "spreading" it on the bread cubes.  I thnk the cubed cream cheese is just fine, it does melt perfectly as it bakes.  If you really like cinnamon you could probably add cinnamon to the egg mixture also.

This was amazing! Great comfort food. I made it for Christmas morning, and everyone had seconds. I did leave out some of the cream cheese and did not put in the maple syrup. For the cream cheese, I kept it in the fridge till I was ready to put it on so it would be more solid and easier to cut into slices.  I used frozen blueberries and used some of the blueberry juice as the liquid in the sauce. Will definitely be making this one again, it has already been requested for breakfast next Christmas!

We had this for Christmas breakfast.  I couldn't find fresh blueberries at a good price so I used frozen mixed berries and it came out great.  Like others, I used day-old Italian bread.  I topped it with the hot berry topping right out of the oven and it was perfect.  This might be good for making ahead and freezing for an easy Sunday brunches, and would be great for Easter breakfast potluck at church.

Made for Christmas morning. I used Italian bread. I didn't really love the cream cheese in it - so may look for a French toast recipe without it. I didn't make the sauce either so maybe this would have made it better

I made this for friends this past summer and it was a huge hit! The only change was that I omitted the cream cheese as there were a couple of people who don't care for cheese. It's Christmas Eve and I've got a an in the fridge ready to go in the morning. Yum!

It was great! I used water with the eggs instead of the milk, I didn't add the butter, and I added cinnamon on top but followed everything else and it was perfect not too sweet or full of calories.  One small container of low-fat Greek vanilla yogurt instead of the cream cheese also worked well for our diets.

Let me begin by saying I took other readers suggestions in making this recipe so I am judging it based on my changes.  (Drives me nuts when someone rates a recipe low based on their changes!)  It was FABULOUS! 1st, frozen blueberries worked out great.  2nd, I creamed  8oz of cream cheese with 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a splash of milk.  This allowed me to smooth it out more easily. 3rd, I only used 10 large eggs. Lastly, I doubled the blueberry sauce recipe, using 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  So yummy!  Thank you for sharing the recipe and thanks to every who shared their changes.  The perfect Christmas morning breakfast!

Actually pinned this recipe on Pinterest.  Amazing! Didn't have to change a thing.  Although my bread was fresh so after cubing it, I put it in the oven for 10-15minutes. Just until very lightly toasted.  I think this really helped it to hold up.  It was the perfect texture once complete! YUMMY!

What a great recipe, I've made this about 10 times. Tweeked just a little: loaf of italian bread let sit out all day trim crust off, I add one teaspoon of cinnamon to egg mixture, half brown sugar, half granulated sugar makes sauce darker and richer. This recipe can be scaled down in size,less cream cheese and eggs. Everyone that has had this loves it.Try it you will be amazed

As suggested I could:  
decrease the cream cheese & mix with milk to spreadable consistency; 
best to use Italian Bread & cube it a day ahead;
use more Blueberries, or use Strawberries or any other berries;
pour half the sauce over it after baking, & serve the rest on the side;
OR EVEN TRY MASCARPONE CHEESE INSIDE.

This was a decent breakfast/brunch, but takes too much time to cook in the morning and ties up the oven for an hour which is a big down side, in my opinion, especially on a holiday morning when you need the oven for Turkey, Ham, and such. It was a little soggy and the cream cheese didn't melt so was still in clumps. Getting chunks of cream cheese took away from the rest of the dish. I don't think I would make this again given the time it takes in the morning (30 min. to set out of the fridge and then another hour in the oven on top of prepping the sauce), but if I did I would probably use a little less milk and egg mixture or a bigger dish with more bread AND would use less cream cheese and melt it with some blueberries and pour it over instead of leaving it in chunks. 

The blueberry sauce was super simple and I give it 5 stars! Will be using it again for sure with regular french toast or other suitable dishes. Overall, this recipe was okay, but could be better with some tweaks. However, I would not consider it a good holiday breakfast/brunch as the time it takes to cook and prep the morning of is too inconvenient. It is a really pretty dish when done though so if you are looking for something pretty to present and have the time in the morning this would be a great choice (again with some small tweaks).

The bread you use can make a big difference. I use a loaf of French bread and reduce the eggs to 8. This gives a good ratio - not too soggy. Cream cheese and blueberry amounts are personal preference but we prefer a bit less. We also skip the sauce just for time sake. I look for recipes to add to my everyday cooking and without sauce and less cheese this works well.
We serve it with maple syrup.

Really very good. I used fresh blueberries and the only change I made was to soften the cream cheese and pipe it over the bread cubes instead of tossing chunks of it it; after experience with a similar recipe, I found that the chunks give the final product a strange, unfinished texture. Husband and child both readily gobbled it up, and leftovers didn't last long either. This one's going into my permanent files.

We picked out the chunks of cream cheese because they were just took much. If I make this again I'll melt the cream cheese and put a layer in between the bread.

Okay, am I the only one who has the issue with cutting the cream cheese into cubes? Yeah, I get it that I can freeze it first, but 1. It's not in the recipe and 2.  Who needs that extra step?  I ended up pinching off tiny pieces and placing them strategically over the bread cubes...

Anyhow,  I don't see how you can go wrong with all the ingredients, so I'm sure it will turn out good (chilling in the fridge now.)

I had this in the oven for an HOUR and a 1/2 and the egg STILL wasn't cooked all the way. I followed the recipe as written. It says bake 25-30 mins covered and another 30 uncovered, not true. like I said 1 and 1/2 hours later, no go. it only gets two stars because my kid liked it.

Like some of the others, I did not like the cream cheese in the recipe, and I did not like the consistency. I always make the recipe as written the first time. I will try it again with some of the modifications suggested by others.  The sauce is very good and I will use it a lot with other desserts such as ice cream, pound cake, pancakes and waffles.

This dish is great.  Love the blueberries and the easy of making it the night before and just shoving it into the oven the next morning.  For us, it seemed to need a little more time in the  oven to firm up a little more., but was just great.

Not my family's cup of tea as they say...I think we are just traditionalists when it comes to french toast maybe.  I made a half recipe...the bottom was like rubbery eggs(almost too done by the time it was cooked all the way) and the top was dry and crunchy...I even used French bread like suggested!

So disappointed was looking so forward to it too! :(

Gluten free!  I made this with the heels of the (expensive) gluten free bread we eat that I'd been collecting in the freezer. I used half blueberries and half strawberries, as that was what I had, and increased the eggs to 14 as it looked a bit dry.  I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and instead of mixing in the syrup, I dribbled it over the top. Because of a change in plans, it was 14 hours before I could bake it, and it still turned out beautifully, not all all mushy.  Finally, rather than making the cooked sauce, I simply mashed up some strawberries and mixed in a little sugar--no cooking.  We ended up serving it as dessert with a choice of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. It was a big hit, and the leftovers are rapidly disappearing.  It's great even cold straight from the refrigerator!

Love the recipe.  Made it numerous times.  One Christmas when traveling, I forgot vanilla and used half eggnog half milk figuring it would add the extra flavor from missing vanilla.  It worked great!  I've also used cottage cheese instead of cream cheese, easier to distribute and still gives some filling creaminess.  I always seems to make it the morning of rather than overnight and it still works out great!

This is a good base recipe, but I suggest making it first, as is, then tweak it according to your personal preferences. I used some of the suggestions in the other reviews,ie added powdered sugar and used Italian bread. It was good and went over well with these modifications, but I think it needs some lemon zest or something to make the blueberry flavor come out. My husband suggested that I cut back on the cream cheese filling next time I make it. I agreed. The blueberry topping was good without any modifications, and I'd use it on pancakes or ice cream. I also want to make this recipe with tart apples and add cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture. A Rhubarb version would be good too.

Delicious. Next time I will cut the cream cheese in smaller chunks and use 1/2 the amount it calls for.

We really liked this recipe we tried it with french bread from the grocery store and strawberries instead of blueberries. It turned out great. We will be making this again.

I made this and had a hard time getting the cream cheese to melt. I would suggest cutting them into smaller squares. My kids thought it was okay but suggested I make it more of a dessert. We added a scoop of icecream and whipped topping while it was warm. Then drizzled it with the blueberry syrup. It was a success!

I made this recipe for a Sunday breakfast. I cut the recipe in half for my husband and myself. I put it in a 11x7 baking dish. The recipe turned out great. We had plenty of leftovers that we heated in the microwave. This is too good to wait for a holiday. Go ahead and spoil yourself with a weekend treat.

My family did not care for this recipe. It was very soggy, and i used a good quality Italian bread as suggested. This just did not taste very well. Will not make again.

Made this recipe with suggestions from other members: used 10 eggs not 12, used Italian bread, added cinnamon to the bread mixture, & decreased the cream cheese.  My Mom & sister raved about it for Mother's Day. I will make this again when strawberries are in season. Thanks for the recipe!

Yowza. I had famiy in from Boston for my child's college graduation and that recipe went home in 3 different suit cases. It was marvelous and it was nice to have something to pop in the oven with all those folks here visiting. 5 delicious stars.

I modified the recipe by using a whole carton of Egg Beaters and used reduced fat cream cheese and it didn't take away from the taste at all and came out better than I expected!  However next time I will use less cream cheese.. Perhaps about 10-12 ounces vs 16.  Oh! And Day old bakery Italian Bread is best...the type that comes as a whole loaf unsliced!

Too much cream cheese! I made the mistake of following the recipe and using all of the cream cheese and it was way too much. If I made this again I would cut the cream cheese in half. The blueberry sauce was delicious.

I was really disappointed. I'm so thankful I didn't have company that morning. The preparation was easy enough and it all came together just like the video until I took a bite. I got a mouth full of cream cheese and some wet soggy bread and had to excuse my self and took care of it. Sad to say I ended up with some toast for Mother's Day Breakfast. I should've known the cream cheese were too big of chunks. And it did lack flavor. I'm willing to try again with other's modified version.

This was fabulous! Everyone loved it. I only let it sit for 2 hours before I cooked it (not overnight) It was still wonderful. I will definitely be making this again. I did double the blueberries in the dish and just used blueberry syrup and a touch of whipped cream. Heaven!

My daughter made this last night for breakfast this morning and when it came out of the oven it looked delicious,and it was!  She doubled the blueberries, decreased the eggs to 6 (we were low),added an additional 1/2 cup of milk to make up for the loss of the liquid from the eggs.

I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast. It took much longer to cook than stated; about 1 1/2 hours in the oven; just didn't want to set. Also, the cream cheese was too much. We wound up eating around the cream cheese; just too heavy. 
The custard was delicious as was the blueberry sauce. Cooking time aside; if you like cream cheese A LOT, than go for it but it you are like we are; cut down or omit the cream cheese, it will be much more enjoyable:)

I loved this recipe but as an Aussie  it was made as a dessert as it is not a typical breakfast style over here..
I enjoyed the pockets of cream cheese through out and  the sauce will be a favourite for waffles , pancakes and ice cream.

This is a great recipe! Used day-old french bread.  I thought there was enough liquid to cover the bread, so it was all moist and tasty good.  I forgot to add the syrup to the milk-egg mixture and just poured some on top; it seemed to add a nice touch of sweetness to the French toast (probably added more than called for in recipe, though).  I would agree to reducing the amount of cream cheese... there was more than enough, but it wasn't overwhelmed.

EXCELLENT!  SO was skeptical of the blueberry syrup, but we agree - it truly makes the dish.  This was fantastic - it will be in the regular rotation now.

Two bites into the breakfast and people were asking for the recipe - that speaks for itself!  I did take the advice of others and whip the cream cheese with icing sugar before pouring it over the first layer of bread.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  I will certainly make this again!

Don't change a thing.  This is good stuff.  Made for Thanksgiving morning and it's in the oven right now for christmas brunch.  The kids pretty much made it clear it's the new holiday breakfast must have. Be sure pop some sausage in the oven the last 30 minutes of baking too.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I have received many compliments on this dish.  I use half of the cream cheese and cut into 1/2 cubes to make sure there is plenty of coverage.

A dish that people LOVE.  My only change is to use only 1 block of cream cheese.  This is an addicting dish that is usually the first to go at a potluck.  Make sure to use 100% maple syrup.  Worth it!

Excellent!!!! Thanks for recipe. I made this for Mother's Day. Big HIT. Forgot to review, Made again this weekend. RICH & Utterly decadent......Have made this many times since first review. Still Love it. I found a Texas Toast loaf in bread aisle & it works GREAT as it still has a softer crust. I have used Strawberries & Raspberries. I cut up the strawberries if they are large. I think recipe is PERFECT as written & gets many requests at all holidays.

This was sooo delicious ! It is perfectly sweet and decadent.The blueberry sauce is the perfect finishing touch (would also be delicious on many other things like,yogurt, ice cream,pancakes,pound cake,etc.) Of course,the beauty of the night-before preparation just makes all the better!

I made this dish once and it was okay but I probably won't make it again. My husband liked it and I thought the flavor was good, but the texture was almost the consistency of a bread pudding. If you are a bread pudding fan, this recipe is amazing, but I happen to not like bread pudding very much. 

The only thing that I can think that I might have done wrong is I that used regular loaf bread and dehydrated it in the oven (arnold's oat nut) rather than buying french or Italian bread from the bakery. If I used a crustier bread, maybe the texture would have been more french toast like, but I am not certain since the bread I used was pretty crusty after dehydrating it.

Made this for breakfast this morning and just really did not care for it. Made it by the directions with the exception of double the amount of blueberries. I thought it was way to sweet and way to mushy. Would not make again.

This came out beautifully!  I was worried that the milk/egg mixture didn't fully cover the bread cubes but the result was a good combination of soft and crispy parts.  This is a great way to celebrate blueberry season.

A great tasting and great looking breakfast casserole - all 30 guys I made this for loved it.  Two even came back in the kitchen and said that their wives have tried blueberry french toast and they were awful and asked me for my recipe.

I made this on a family vacation and it was fabulous. They ate it all. I used Texas Toast for the bread and then worried that I should have adjusted the egg mixture but it turned out great. Will definitely make it again.

I Love this recipe!  It is so easy to prepare and delicious.  Everybody loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.  I think I might try black raspberries instead of the blueberries when they are ready for the picking.

I made this using raspberries (using a little more berries than the recipe says) and it was amazing! The only things I did different was use 9 eggs instead of 12. I also blended 1.5 packages of cream cheese with powdered sugar and spread that over the bread.  This was a HUGE hit and several people asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make in the future!!

amazing! I changed receipie as others did, changed it to 9 eggs, used french bread, added  a little cinnamon and powder sugar to cream cheese. when baked i sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top of casserole and then spooned blueberry mix on top and then drizzled a little maple syrup. it was a huge hit!

I wanted to like this but was really disappointed.  I cooked well over an hour and it was still raw (its in the oven as I'm writing this review).  I tried eating it after about an hour and ten and was really grossed out.  I pick my own blueberries locally every fall and felt like I had wasted all of the hard work I put into picking them.

So easy to make - I make it the night before - I also use more blueberries (1 pt instead of 1 C) - but I don't think you can make it poorly.  The worst thing I ever did was to cut the cream cheese too small - don't do that!  Healthy chunks with chunks of bread - it's all good

I needed more from this dish than it delivered.  It was neither sweet, nor savory enough for me.  I followed some suggestions by reducing the cream cheese to one 8 oz. pkg. and topped it with cinnamon before baking.  Without the sauce (that is fabulous), this dish just fell flat for me.  I think the cream cheese needs to be sweetened because it was a slight bit bitter without sugar.

Delicious! I used frozen berries instead of fresh. 1 1/2 C over cream cheese. Added the additional 1/2C sugar. Also whipped cream cheese with 3T confect. sugar. I doubled the syrup recipe and poured it over the baked product.

I made this for work this week and wow, did it get great reviews.  I love how you can make it the night before and bake in the morning....
I think it made alot of syrup.  I poured half on the top and used the remaining half for people to pour on to their liking.  That way, it didnt get soggy.
Great recipe and I used blackberries from our yard...delish.

I made this the day before to serve on Christmas morning and it was a HUGE hit! I read all the reviews and decided use the suggestion to use the crusty Italian bread. I only had one package of cream cheese and it seemed rich enough to me...no loss. I also doubled the syrup, per one of the reviewers and that was a great tip. Plenty to use, and plenty for leftovers to use on pancakes, or whatever. I served this with thick bacon. It makes a beautiful presentation, or as we like to say at my house, "a Bon Appetit cover." I will definitely make this one again.

This tastes great and is easy to make. I use egg substitute, fat-free milk, and low-fat yogurt butter instead of full-fat ingredients and I still get rave reviews. I'm so glad I tried this.

Made this for Christmas morning breakfast and have to say that I wasn't all that impressed.  My family ate it and liked it, but it wasn't quite sweet enough for me.

I did find that mixing the cream cheese/bread with my hands helped spread everything out evenly.

I made this for Christmas morning this year.  I prepared everything the evening before and it was very simple.  It took maybe 10 minutes.  I did half the cream cheese, using only 8oz and probably used more than a cup of blueberries, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled delicious baking the next morning.  And the sauce was SO easy and delicious.  Everyone LOVED this and went back for seconds.  I will definitely make this again.  It's perfect for holidays or when you have visitors.

OMG!  I wasn't sure what to expect and of course I waited until the last minute.  This was going to be Christmas breakfast.  It was fabulous.  I used Artisian Bread from the Safeway bakery and cut the cream cheese to just one block.  PERFECT!!! Thanks for the recipe....

Great recipe.  It is also good when made with blackberries or raspberries.  I think I will try peach or bing cherries when the season rolls around.  This would also be good for "breakfast for dinner" night.

This was a hit with the family at Christmas Eve brunch.    I made a few revisions, though.  I doubled the blueberries in both the casserole and the syrup.  I reduced the eggs to 10 and I sprinkled cinnamon generously over the top before baking which was a nice addition.  Also, I doubled the syrup.  We probably used a little over half, but I was glad to know we had plenty.  I didn't pour any of the syrup over the casserole prior to serving, but just passed it on the side so everyone could use the amount they wanted.  The leftover syrup will be great on pancakes or waffles!  Or even ice cream.  Modifications I would add next time--I would add the cinnamon to the egg mixture so it incorporates throughout the french toast.  I would reduce the amount of sugar in the syrup.  As others said, it was too sweet.  I added the juice of half a lime to it which really helped cut the sweetness and I liked the hint of citrus.

We love this recipe for family get togethers.  I love serving it for Christmas morning.  That way I don't have to work to put on a nice breakfast.  This year I am going to try it in a crockpot.

This was delicious. The only change I made was to only use 1 8oz. Block of cream cheese, cut it into small cubes and spread it all over the bread. Really wonderful, like something from a B & B. I'm making this again, this time with strawberries!

This was absolutely delicious! The taste was AWESOME! The only mistake I made was I think I needed to bake a tiny bit longer as the center seemed a little mushy although it was cooked. YUMMY!! I was first worried that syrup wouldn't turn blue and mix right - but it was PERFECT!! Thank YOU!!!!

This dish was outstanding.  Made it twice and both times got rave reviews.   The only change I made was I used french bagelette bread in place of day old bread.  I like the density of the bagelette bread with this recipe.  The blueberry sauce was delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe to all!

Great recipe!  I made it for my family on Father's Day and they loved it!  I opted for Texas Toast instead of french bread or day-old bread as the recipe calls for.  I added a touch more vanilla too.  Most wonderful french toast I've had in a long time.  Will definitely make again.

I made this with a loaf of day old Italian bread, it tasted good but was a little soggier than I like! My hubby had his wisdom teeth taken out a few days ago & enjoyed it since it was so soft (he was sick of yogurt & applesauce lol) So that was a plus!!! It was good just a tad too soggy for my liking....however the blueberry syrup was awesome!!!

Well, this tasted great and was super easy to put together, but there were just a couple things I was a little disappointed in.  First, I halved the recipe to fit a small casserole dish, but kept the baking times the same and mine still seemed to have a lot of liquid in it - maybe because I used skim milk, as that's all we usually have in the house.  It kind of fell apart as I served it. and didn't stay in distinct layers.  The other thing was the cream cheese - it ended up looking like curds of cottage cheese.  Those were just visual issues though, because once I took a bite my whole perception changed. It's very sweet, delicious and perfect for a special occasion brunch or breakfast!  Next time I'll probably reduce the milk and maybe try whipping the cream cheese with a little orange zest instead of going with cubes of it.

I think this was good. I didn't feel like I had died and gone to heaven eating it, so it's not getting 5 stars! My fiance loved it though.  I would do as others suggested and whip the cream cheese with some powdered sugar before adding it. I might even cut the cream cheese to 1 1/2 blocks.

This was a nice, easy breakfast. I did the whole milk and sugar to the cream cheese to make it spreadable suggustion. I also sprinkled cinnamon over it before putting it in the fridge, and I added some cinnamon and nutmug to the sauce. Looked fabulous, but was just a little bland. I'm going to blame it on the blueberries...they weren't at their peak. I will make this again using blueberries, blackberries and strawberries. I'm thinking that will really be flavorful. **Update**, added some almond extract to the leftover sauce, much yummier!

Make sure you have a large loaf of bread - while I was able to get the 12 slices 1 inch thick - it still was just not enought to soak up all of the eggs of which I only used 10.  My husband was not too immpressed with it, but my guests raved about it.  So tastes will vary.  I think that if I make again I will definitly make sure I have two loaves of bread and just make it like sandwiches instead of cutting it up in cubes.

I was in a rush and didn't have time to read any of the reviews so I made the recipe as-is.  Absolutely delicious, I especially enjoyed the syrup.  I probably added more blueberries than called for and I used brioche for the bread, but the only comment I have is that I was a little concerned about the amount of eggs ... it seemed like there was a lot of liquid-bread ratio.  It turned out lovely though, with a sort of custard-like consistency.  I still might decrease the eggs a little next time.

YUM! We had this for a family weekend. Took to our hotel suite, popped in the oven in the morning.  It puffed up gorgeous like a souffle but then falls as it sits.  We used french bread in this cubed up. Wonderful with or without the blueberry sauce. Some had it plain, some with regular maple syrup, some with blueberry sauce. Family favorite.

I made this at Christmas this year for my whole family---WHAT A HIT! The only thing I added was I mixed my cream cheese with about 3/4 cup of powder sugar and a little milk and spread it over the first layer of bread. I also double the syrup so we have plenty. I made this again just the other day and used frozen mixed berries---YUMMY-- Thanks so much for the new "tradition" in our family!!

This recipe is amazing! The blueberry sauce is what really makes this dish! I made this for the first time for Christmas morning breakfast - loved every bite! Only thing I will do different next time is use 1-8oz package of cream cheese instead of 2.

Amazing. It was very sweet and I think I'll cut some of the sugar down in the syrup next time. But, it was delicious. When I added the cream cheese, I cut pieces of it off and topped each slice of bread with a small piece of cream cheese. I also used homemade bread that I cut into big chunks. My husband doesn't like "soggy bread" so he ate the crisp pieces off the top and there was a little something delicious for everyone.

This was amazing I did take some of the other pointers and I also used panettone bread in place of the bread cubes It was fantastic !!! The citrus and currants added a wonderful taste and smell ..Also added a little cinammon for more flavor I will make this again for sure !!!!Happy Holidays

I used strawberries the second time I made it.  I used a whole package of frozen strawberries for the bake and another package for the sauce.   Everyone loved this!  I followed the recommendations made by the other reviewers!  I made it with blueberries as well for a facutly breakfast.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

I thought this was really great. Family loved it too. I will make again and maybe thin the cream cheese with a little milk. I only used 1 8oz. of cream cheese. The blueberry syrup is the best!!

I made this for my family when they came up to visit and it was pretty good. I liked that I didn't have to do too much in the morning other than make the syrup and pop the toast in the oven. I did what other people said and whipped the cream cheese then spread it on the bread, but I think it made the cream cheese almost non-existent in the end. Maybe next time I'll whip it up with some sugar or something to make it sweeter. More spices would be nice too. Maybe cinnamon and nutmeg, or more vanilla.

excellent recipe!!!  i have made this for my family, then for a brunch i was hosting and received rave reviews.  the only change i made was using blueberry syrup instead of the maple...warning, it does make the egg mixture turn green but it tastes so good!!  once cooked, you can't tell the color changed.  :)

Super-yummy.  Easy to make too.  I made this for a baby shower brunch, and guests asked me for the recipe during the party.  Also, since then I've had numerous requests to make it again.  You may have to bake it a bit longer than the recipe calls for -- just to make sure the eggs fluff up.

Flavor just wasn't there (didn't seem sweet enough) - too much preparation and just wasn't calorie worthy.

This went over well with the six of my picky eaters. I used 1 block and 1 container of soft cream cheese and used the suggestion of adding 1/4 c. of confectioner's sugar. I did not double the sauce and we had plenty even for leftovers. I will be using this recipe again and again, YUM!

Made this Christmas morning.  Used store-bought blueberry fruit sauce/syrup instead of the recipe for sauce.  I also only left it in the fridge for a couple of hours rather than overnight, and I cut the crusts off the bread before putting it together.  It was okay, but without the blueberry syrup for the top it probably wouldn't have had much taste.  The bottom was custardy/eggy - I can't imagine if I'd refrigerated it overnight! - and the top was too crispy since it didn't get much egg to soften the bread.  I love cream cheese so the chunks of it didn't bother me, but next time I would definitely cut it smaller.  The recipe was just okay in my opinion and most of it disappeared so it must not have been TOO bad but I was a bit disappointed.  It needs more blueberries, less eggs, and firmer bread - perhaps thicker slices of firmer bread to make bigger cubes so it doesn't break down so much on the bottom.

As written, this is only OK. I should have read all the reviews.  There are way too many eggs for the size pan it calls for.  I was not a fan of the cream cheese globs, either.  Next time I'll follow the reviewers advice who spread the cream cheese on the bread before cubing.  The blueberry sauce is fabulous, though!  I'll try it again with some modifications, for sure.

Made it for an all day pajama party movie fest with friends. Not the easiest to prepare, but well worth it. Everyone raved! It was our decadent and rich addition to a brunch full of quiche and mamosas. Very good--worth making again.

I followed the suggestions and cut the syrup back from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup and found it to work out just fine. Three out of four in our household love blueberries so I have had to make this a few time already.

This recipe is one of my all-time favorites.  We pick blueberries every summer.  I always freeze some so I can make this recipe for Christmas morning. I usually don't make the blueberry syrup and just buy it...it's still wonderful and my whole family LOVES it.

SO good. Instead of using maple syrup I used regular syrup and just used a little more for the extra sweet. I pressed everything down before putting it in the frudge overnight so all the bread would be covered by the egg mixture and soak overnight. When I pulled it out the next morning I added more blueberries to the top. Syrup was EXCELLENT. I did only use 10oz of cream cheese and it was the perfect amount. We devoured this!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch/Birthday party for my daughter, and it was a hit.  I am always scared trying new recipes ofr the first time with a group of people, but it was delicious, and everyone commented on it.  I made it especially with one family member in mind because she is allergic to most fruits, but blueberries she can eat.  She came back for seconds.  I think I will take the advice of decreasing the eggs, and try whipping up the cream cheese but all in it it was great.

Kids didn't really care for it.  I thought there was too much cream cheese.  Hubby devoured it!  I may make this again and decrease the cream cheese.

Was very good, but much too sweet. Was almost like a dessert for breakfast! Would be great with ice cream and served as a dessert though! The sauce was awesome--but if you make this for breakfast, make sure you serve a egg dish to balance out the sweetness of this recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few adjustments. I used cinnamon swirl bread instead of plain bread. Like many other reviews I did use more blueberries and less cream cheese. I actually spread the cream cheese (very liberally) on the dried out bread without even cubing it. It was much easier than putting it on tiny peices. Once it was in the dish I just used the end of a metal spatula and cut it into quarters like that. I did use more butter in the syrup also. It added some extra richness to it. Overall, I enjoyed this and will probaly make it again.

We enjoyed this for the most part.  The blueberry syrup was really good!  The downside was that the chunks of cream cheese were overwhelming.  If I made this again, I'd whip the cream cheese and then add the eggs, syrup etc to the cream cheese.

It was different. Good to try one time, not sure I'll try it again. I used French bread, and it had too much crust on it. I picked all the pieces with thick crust and took them off. It was a lot of work, and I'm not sure it was worth it. Very sweet. Might make a better dessert.

I felt a little sick after eating this. There is WAY too much cream cheese and WAY too many eggs. I think with less cream cheese and less eggs it could be really good. The syrup is great and is a must with this recipe.

4 stars as is..5 after I made some adjustments. The second time I made it, I kept the bread in slices, spread the cream cheese (made sandwiches), added cinnamon and sugar on top and reduced the sugar in the syrup. I preferred it this way! But it was still good as written.

I Made this recipe and my family loved it. A few things I did change was I used fresh and frozen raspberries. I used 1 package of cream cheese. I added some maple syrup to the raspberry syrup. Added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture..This was really good and I will make again.

This was a fabulous Xmas morning breakfast!  I, too, used 10 only eggs (plenty) and I used about half the required cream cheese too.  I used "stuffing bread" often found at Thanksgiving time and cut it thick using the entire loaf.  I will make this again and again!  Everyone raved how good it was!

I took the suggestions of many and reduced the eggs to 10, added cinnamon, reduced the cream cheese to 14oz (which I think was perfect), and doubled the fruit.  I also used huckle berries instead of blue berries, added sugar to the egg mixture and reduced the bread, which was plenty.  Things I wish I would have done that I will do next time is add sugar to the cream cheese before spreading it on.  It was really sweet, but very good, I will make again.

I love blueberries, but this was just ok to me.  I sprinkled the top with sugar before baking and served with a dollop of whipped cream and a little syrup on top.  My family loved it, though!

My husband and I made this for the morning after Thanksgiving.  The blueberry syrup was excellent, my husband loves blueberries so he loved this.  But the french toast was very "eggy" and there was not enough blueberries or maple syrup to make it sweet at all.  It was good but not quite a "keeper". But, we decided to save it until we have kids and see what they think.  I think kids would like this.

Made this at our family reunion and everyone loved it! (except for my husband who doesn't like dessert for breakfast) Everyone thought it tasted like cheese cake.
