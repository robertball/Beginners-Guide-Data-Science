Love this dish!  My husband who is not a fan of couscous or cucumbers requests this dish on a regular basis.  It is just that good.  I will sometimes add a cup of cooked chopped chicken breast meat to the dish, and make a whole meal out of it.

I made this for dinner guests last evening. It was an excellent compliment to blackened tuna! Actually, I simplified the recipe further. I use Good Seasons Italian dressing (the kind made in it's own carafe.) Instead of oil/vinegar, I used Lime juice and olive oil. Just poured it over the couscous, and veggies and served it at room temperature. Guests raved!

So good! I used quinoa instead or orzo or couscous and added in shrimp and spinach.

This was a super easy and good recipe.. I used Orzo pasta as my toddler really likes it.  I just cooked the pasta and added a bit of lemon juice to the whole thing.

I would suggest cooking the couscous the way the directions on the box say to do it. I tried cooking it the way this recipe called for and it was slightly crunchy and chewy. Thank goodness I had 2 boxes and was able to try it the box directions. It was lacking flavor except for the fresh ingredients.

I loved this...easy and tasty.  I used the multicolor couscous.  I added carrot.   I didn't have parsley but I did have cilantro....which I love...and I thought it added so much to the dish.  I'll definitely do it again!

Made this as a main dish for my husband and self: added some leftover black beans, increased the amount of tomatoes, cucumber, and feta cheese. Did not increase olive oil, but added a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and several good shakes of Greek seasoning blend. My husband claimed the leftovers for his next meal.

Made this tonight, it was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make again!  I doubled the recipe but followed it almost to a T... Couldn't find plain couscous so I used the Olive Oil and Roasted Garlic by Near East and I did add the seasoning pack for more flavor, to keep with that theme, I added some roasted minced garlic too.  I actually forgot the olive oil and it tasted great anyway!  Saved some calories but kept all the amazing flavor, great recipe, thank you!

This is a great recipe, my wife and I both loved it as a side dish. I didn't have green onions and substituted the parsley with cilantro. It turned out really well. The lemon juice gives it a refreshing taste.

I made this last night, and was a bit underwhelmed with the couscous. As far as all of the other ingredients, I wouldn't change them. 
In the picture, I kept thinking it was orzo...I am thinking I would prefer it with orzo.  Can anyone out there school me on couscous! I am very unfamiliar with it.  My manfriend absolutely loved it though!
