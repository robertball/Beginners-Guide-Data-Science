I doubled the recipe. It was not sweet enough for my taste. I loved the idea of the Cook & Serve Pudding and Cream Cheese together, but the result was less than expected. A VERY heavy cream cheese flavor, so a bit more sour than sweet.  Although like I said that may be because I doubled the recipe. IF I try it again, I'll use less cream cheese and maybe even a little powdered sugar.
