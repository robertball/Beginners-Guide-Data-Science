This was good but the lemonade overwhelms the strawberry taste.  Next time I will add more strawberries but it was still very good.

I tried this recipe for our Memorial Day Cookout - I had made 2 gallons and ran out within the first hour!  Everybody loved it!  Easy to make and serve.

I usually make this yummy recipe with a strong lemonade mix, ice and fresh strawberries.  My husband likes the tiny ice chunks.

This was too tart, but the consistency was great.  I doubled the strawberries and added 1-2 T. of agave syrup and then it was great!  We enjoyed this with a spicy Cajun recipe.  The drink cooled the palate.

Very lemony!  If that's what you're looking for don't change a thing!  If you want less of a lemon taste add more water.  I also added rasberries to mine!

This lemonade was very tart so I added about 1 Tbs of pineapple juice to balance out the flavor... Can't wait to make it again soon!!! Overall, this was a great summer drink!

I tend to double the ingredients as most cans of frozen lemonade come in 12 ounces.  If I just use 6, what do I do with the rest?  Following this to the tee even with doubling, I think it could stand just a tad more water....the lemonade concentrate was still a tad strong, but there is MUCH room to customize how strong you want it (or not :) ).

So simple and refreshing on a hot summer evening. I was able to whip this up in no time and enjoyed ever last sip. I used pink lemonade and it made a very pretty presentation.

Very refreshing drink, but a little on the tart side.  My husband liked as written, but I added 2-3 tablespoons of Splenda before my kids would drink it.  Will definitely make this again, keeping that in mind.  It's simple and perfect for those hot, summer days.

Tasty. I also added about double the strawberries, as other reviewers did. I used frozen strawberries which in turn eliminated the need for ice. Good stuff. Even better with a shot of raspberry vodka or two.

Great if you add additional strawberries.  I used about 1 cup fresh to counter the tart lemonade taste.

This recipe was good, but I found it way too sour/tangy for my taste. I had to add sugar and extra water to make it sweeter. Overall it was okay.

This is a very refreshing drink on a hot day. Had for guests and they loved it too!  I made per the recipe, and thought it was good as is, but a bit tart and needed a few extra strawberries. After adding them,  better, but still tangy. Decided to add  2-3 fresh mint leaves and blended them in at the end. WOW! Really took the zing away and added a nice flavor! The small flecks of green in the red also looked pretty. Can also add a leaf to the top to decorate. DEFINITILY will make again in the summer! Thanks! (I used 12oz of store brand lemonade and made the recipe twice. Made enough for 4 people, 1-1/2  8oz. glasses each. Could have made more, but wanted to save room for dinner! :D. )

It was ok.  I had to make mine with the whole bag of frozen strawberries to get an acceptable taste for my family. I had to use what I had on hand and didn't have any fresh. For me 1/4 c of the lemonade to the 5 strawberries and maybe less of water (1/2 - 3/4 c ??) would do better.  That is the ratio I plan on doing when I try this again. I also plan on trying it with the fresh strawberries next time. Great ingredients just wrong ratio for this house.  Glad I tried it though :)

We lived off of this recipe in the summer. I did it exactly like the recipe but varied it up smoothie-style with different fruits and types of frozen lemonade/limeade and it was consistently great.

When I was making this, I didn't have any lemonade or lemonade concentrate. Instead I used watermelon kool-aid and froze it. The texture was perfect!!! I can't wait to try this next time with actual lemonade. I think if you don't like how tart the lemonade is (as other comments say it is overpowering the strawberry) using watermelon kool-aid works well.

This was delicious! I love tart lemonade so it was perfect for me. Instead of fresh strawberries, I used frozen ones and just added them until I got the taste I wanted. It was great! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I am two months pregnant and the only thing that sounds good is Panera's frozen lemonade.  This is an excellent homemade alternative.  I used frozen strawberries.  Definite keeper because it makes a great summer drink.
