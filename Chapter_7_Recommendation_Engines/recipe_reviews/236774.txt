Well, I usually  make a very bare bones swiss steak.  Meat, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, green pepper, salt and pepper.

I followed this recipe to a tee, except I needed an extra tablespoon of oil to sauté the onions and garlic, and I added a bit of sliced bell pepper

This recipe was really, really good.  Early on, I feared that the thyme and oregano had completely taken over the recipe, but as it cooked (I did 8 hours)it really mellowed out.  It is delicious, and the gravy/sauce is a little thick, which works well with noodles, rice, or potatoes.  I served it over potatoes and boy was it good.

Thanks :)

I just want to let everyone who has not used Cubed Steak before in a slow cooker. Do yourself a favor and use Round Steak instead. Cubed Steak cooked for 6-8 hours in a crockpot will have the texture of chewed up meat. Not a good thing. Round Steak will turn out much better. Great recipe!

The only change I made was holding out thyme as a personal preference. Very good dish!

Was trying to find a swiss steak recipe like my grandmother used to make, and this was it! Delicious with mashed potatoes. I used a pound of round steak and a pound of cubed steak to see which we preferred. The cubed is more like grandma used to make, and I liked both ... but the round does hold up better after cooking so long. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I have eaten Swiss steak all my life but I must say this was the beast I have ever had. The only changes I made were to add some sautéed mushrooms & thickened the gravy with the seasoned flour used for dredging. It was divine. The only negative was I made the mistake of using cubed steak instead of round but that one is on me.

This was beyond my expectations! It was early evening and had to rush so I cooked it in my Pressure cooker for 20 min. My family absolutely loved it. I did not change a thing.

I made it and followed the recipe pretty well, added mushrooms and 1/4 cup of red wine.  It was delicious and there was enough two meals.

I made it using venison (deer meat) which made it incredibly tender but I did find it kind of bland.   Recipe was easy and I love using my slow cooker as it lets me do other things instead of continually watching it.   I would probably make again because of ease but I would definitely find some more spices to make it more flavorful.
