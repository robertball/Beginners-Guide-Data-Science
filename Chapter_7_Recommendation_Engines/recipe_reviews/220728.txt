I loved this pie. The first time I made it.  The strawberry filling was too sour and a little gritty. He second time I made it I left out the coconut in the filling and added a tablespoon of agave. It was perfect. The crust was incredible all on its own.

Such an amazing recipe! I don't review most recipes, even though I should, but this, how could I not write a review about this! It's so amazing! Even the non vegans in my household loved it. I did take the suggestion of a fellow baker and omitted the coconut in the pur√©e. Everything else stayed the same. I did however leave it in the fridge to set up for 48 hours. Because I left out the coconut I knew it wouldn't set as quick. Great, great recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

I substituted more strawberries, a little raw agave and more medijool dates instead of filling it up with the coconut flakes and ended up with  a smooth, creamy texture on the inside. I also found that this recipe needed more than just a "pinch" of salt - but this may be preference.

This is a delicious pie and is super easy and fast to make. The crust is very sweet from the dates and the filling is slightly sour from the strawberries, so it's a perfect blend.

I used all raw products when making this recipe.  The coconut in the filling caused the pie to have a gritty mouth feel.(I used a vitamix)  The coconut also overpowered the strawberries so it didn't really taste like strawberry pie at all.  I added 3 packets of stevia because the filling wasn't sweet.
