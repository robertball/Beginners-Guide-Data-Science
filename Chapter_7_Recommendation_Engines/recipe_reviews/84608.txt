This was my first attempt at making cole slaw and I had great results. Just want to note that I substituted the dill pickle and pickle juice for sweet relish--just a personal preference. Also, I have made this many, many times and now I add only a medium onion per head of cabbage. I was being told that the onion flavor was a bit overpowering, so I have cut it back considerably. It's also worth mentioning to experiment with different types of mustard.  I have used sweet and spicy and dijons, all with great results. The sugar balances it out nicely. Thank you very much for this recipe!

this is the only recipe i will be using from now on.  i didn't have a pickle, so i used a tablespoon of dill relish instead.  also decreased sugar to 1/4 cup.  tasted great and got better with age.

I made this coleslaw for a potluck and it was pretty good (on day one).  A few days later I made a fish dinner and thought I would serve the coleslaw as a side.  It was awesome!  So much better on day 2 and 3.  Yum!  It's also very easy to make (especially if you cheat and buy the pre-shredded cabbage with carrots like I did.  I used 2 bags.)  :)

I have tried many different varieties of coleslaw. This is by far the best ever! Thanks Dave, with just a few minor changes to suit my family, it was delicious.
I left out the carrots & added tomato's diced small right before serving instead. I used sour cream instead of Buttermilk.  The perfect slaw recipe that I have been looking for.

This is a crowd pleaser. This coleslaw is elevated because of the yin yang relationship of sweet and tangy. I cheated w/ a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix (green & purple cabbage w/ carrots). Not being sure about the equivalency of a head of cabbage to a 16 ounce bag, I stuck with the amount of ingredients per the recipe since it would be easy to drain away any excess ‘liquid’. In subsequently looking up info, it appears an average size head of cabbage produces about 8-10 cups, or roughly 32 ounces. When making again, I’ll halve the mayo & buttermilk unless 2, 16 oz. bags are used. One modification was to garnish this dish w/ blue cheese, reduced fat crumbles. This was served as an optional topping on Shredded Chicken Tacos by Goya. ROXY24, thanks for sharing.

I have to say, I was very surprised when I made this recipe. I thought that adding the mustard would ruin this, but it didn't. I had about 25 guests that I made this for and everyone loved it! I will for sure make this again.

I just thought this recipe tasted ok.  I followed the recipe as stated except for scaling back to 6 servings.  I only let the flavors blend in the fridge for 4 hours initally before serving.  I am used to a sweeter coleslaw so was tempted to add more sugar but did not.  In all fairness, I tasted again 24 hours later and the flavor didn't taste any different than at 4 hours. For our family, there was too much dressing and it was soupy (even after being in the fridge overnight). I do feel this would be good on a pulled pork sandwich because it does not have an overpowering sweet or sour taste.

This is a wonderful creamy coleslaw; not too sweet and just the right amount of tang. I served this at a bar-b-que with a whole roasted pig. This slaw was perfect. It makes a lot of dressing so use a big head of cabbage.

I have made this coleslaw to go with my sister's pulled pork for her Superbowl party for the past two years.  Needless to say it has been such a big hit that I cannot even think of going to her party this year without.  Everyone LOVES it!

I have made this many times and thiught I'd throw my 2 cents in. This is by far the best coleslaw I have ever eaten. Like many others I found the dressing a wee bit sloppy so I cut the mayo and buttermilk in half and left everything else the same. Most times I can't even leave it to sit overnight because it gets picked at as soon as its made. YUMMM!!

It's like eating a big mac, except with coleslaw instead of a hamburger. The pickle juice makes it truly awesome. More fattening than a good German slaw, but worth it.

This stuff is awesome. It's not heavy and too creamy like some deli cole slaws. I substituted bread-and-butter for the dill and dijon for yellow mustard just because that's what we had. I'm definitely holding on to this recipe.

Great coleslaw ROXY! Needed a side for our Surf and Turf BBQ and this was it!  I love the pickle!  Next time I'll cut back on the amount of sweet onion and add another baby kosher dill. I put the leftover dressing in the fridge and poured it over a spinach salad the next day... :)

Hands down the best slaw I've ever had. Thanks. Grew a bunch of cabbage in my garden this year and have been looking for good recipes to use it up. Took a look at the ingredients before deciding upon this particular recipe and boy and I glad I chose this one! Mighty tasty stuff!!!

Excellent recipe, Dave! I suppose the fact that it was too much dressing may have something to do with the size of the cabbage head. I like my slaw a little toward the dry side when using in hotdogs.

Wow....this is great...don't change a thing.  I thought it would be really runny dressing but after letting it sit  the suggested 8 hours or more it was perfect with my slow cooker pulled pork sandwiches.....and loved the touch of mustard and dill pickle.

So good..... tried it both with sour cream and with buttermilk. Liked the sourcream much better. Seemed to help with the runny consistency. Like my coleslaw more on the white side so used about half the mustard.

This is very good! I did add a little bit more pickle juice, probably a total of 4 TBS.  It turned out very good.  I will be making this again and again.

This is a great classic slaw.  I din't have the time to tlet it sit for 8 hours.  Mine only sat for about 1 hour and it was still delicious.  I served it with BBQ pork sandwiches.  My husband, the BBQ fanatic, loved it!

I really enjoyed this coleslaw recipe.  I took it to a family christmas party and they loved it!  It would be wonderful on sandwiches I agree.  Some put on their ham sandwiches also.  It would be perfect for pulled pork or reuben sandwiches.  It tastes very close to KFC's coleslaw.  Also, I enjoyed it the next day, but didn't care for it the 3rd day (does that make sense?).  Wonderful recipe and will definitely keep.

This was GREAT!  My husband ate some before the party we were bringing it to - and he wasn't going to STOP.  And it was a big hit at the party - I was asked to bring a side for ham for a luncheon party.  My brother-in-law loved it so much we set some aside for him for after the party.  Thanks, Dave!!

LOVED this!  Took it to a BBQ, and topped it on pulled pork sandwich...delicious!  (Actually, I had a hard time stopping myself from snarfing the whole huge bowl before we left for the picnic!)  It does make a LOT of dressing, so make sure you serve it with a slotted spoon!

Tastes just like at a fast food chains that I love.  I made this for a BBQ, and a girls mom told me she didn't eat colesalw. Well, I gave her some anyway and she at 3 helping.  she loved it and her mom couldn't believe it.  A new favorite coleslaw.

The best coleslaw dressing!  Compare it to the best restaurant slaw I have ever eaten.  Family gobbled it up.  Made the entire recipe but only used half to mix with the cabbage and stored the rest of the sauce in fridge to ensure we could have fresh coleslaw later in the week .

I didn't use a carrot; and instead of buttermilk, a little regular milk for consistency; and Splenda instead of sugar. This is the best coleslaw dressing ever!  The pickle and juice really sets it off.

Amazing coleslaw recipe! My husband loves coleslaw and has tried it from just about every restaurant in our area...never finding one he truly loved. Now I can make it myself and know that it tastes better than anything else out there.

NOTE: I didnt have buttermilk so used equal amounts of sour cream in its place. Also, we ate it within two hours of making it and it was still fabulous! Cant wait to try it again tomorrow if its supposed to be better after more time....

this is a good coleslaw recipe. i used a garlic dill and used a bigger sweet onion since i didnt have any green onions. i didnt use near the dressing it made maybe 1/2 so if i make this again ill cut all the dressing ingredients by at least half. the recipe states let it sit and thats absolutely correct i didnt think id like it so well right after i made it but as soon as the flavors melded this was good.

this recipe is fab.u.lous. i don't even like coleslaw but was making slow-cooked pulled pork and wanted a slaw to offer guests. i ended up eating more slaw than my guests! only things i changed: a little extra cayenne, no green onion, and substituted greek yogurt for the buttermilk. sooo good.

Also a lover of good coleslaw, I have to say that this is truly one of my favorites ever!  Even my finicky kids love it with pulled pork sandwiches or even alone.  I did not change anything from the recipe, and loved it!

Great recipe- thanks! I used bagged coleslaw cabbage to make it easier. I also subbed sour cream for buttermilk just because it's what I had in my kitchen. Still 5 stars!

I'm picky about coleslaw.  This was intriguing, but it ended up too juicy and one flavor was overpowering - maybe the green onions?  I think I'll stick to my mom's recipe.

I gave it 5 stars for flavor and how it complemented the pulled pork. The only things I would change is the amount of dressing. I cut it down by half and it was still very soupy but I may not have used enough cabbage. Very YUMMY!!! will make again.

Awesome coleslaw! I made it exactly as the recipe stated except to halve the amount... but I forgot to halve the pickle juice, vinegar and mustard, I put the whole 2 tbsp of each. So it was a touch tangy. Next time I'll get that right. I really like what the dill pickles imparted to the flavor though. I've never made nor had coleslaw with dill pickles but I think this recipe is definitely a keeper! Good job!

This coleslaw was extremely pickely and that is saying a lot because I like pickles. Something about the creaminess, and sweetness along with the pickles did not agree with my tastebuds. To me, the ingredients did not mesh together well.

This is a great recipe!  My husband loves coleslaw and is always searching for a good recipe. He said this is the best he has ever had.  We all loved it.  Tastes great with pork.  Note:  Makes enough dressing for two batches.  Use sparingly.  Delicious!

DELICIOUS!!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used a mixture of mayo, sour cream, plain yogurt, and milk.  Next time I may try a mixture of dill and sweet pickles since my husband likes his coleslaw really sweet.

Very, very good recipe.  I found it way too liquidy so next time I would use 1/2 or a little less mayo and buttermilk, but leave everything else the same.  Very nice taste.  Hubby gave it a 9 on ten!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious on BBQ pork sandwiches. I think next time I will add more pickle though because I like it a little bit more sour.

I LOVED this recipe!  It was a huge hit amongst my household of all guys.  I modified it a little b/c we have different ingredients in the UK:  1/2 the buttermilk and Branston pickle instead of dill.  Tasted delicious and created a thicker dressing!  Cheers!

I had a purple cabbage and needed new slaw ideas. Never thought to add dill pickles or mustard! I loosely followed the directions (which is what I usually do with recipes). I use agave syrup instead of sugar, and I didn't have buttermilk or some of the other ingredients but my slaw turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My first attempt at Cole slaw from scratch. Came out great.  

Only suggestion for future newbies is to give some advance thought for a container to toss everything.  Next time I'll use my crock pot or a large stock pot. After it's tossed and dressed, a 11x17" baking dish is big enough to serve.

Wow! This stuffs amazing. I have been mindlessly eating this a bowlful at a time for days now. It definately gets better the longer it sits. I stumbled onto this recipe while looking for a mustard slaw like I used to get at the BBQ place here that went out of business and while looking for a kfc clone for my sister. I managed to find both here on allrecipes and I decided to try this one based on the ingredients and reviews of others. By far and away one of the best coleslaw recipes I have ever tried. Every person in the house tested both this and the kfc clone and everyone preferred this one. Mustard and dill pickles whats not to love. Thank you so much for posting this. It is now our main coleslaw. Went out today and got ingredients to make more since the bowl is almost empty.

This is an amazing slaw!
I was wary of adding pickles but had them on hand so why not?
My journey to this recipe started with a head of savoy cabbage and a head of red cabbage.  Luckily I had 2 potlucks coming up and figured a coleslaw would be a good use of all that cab-bage!
The sauce was amazing - it actually makes quite a bit so don't hold back on your cabbage and carrots, feel free to experiment by adding other ruffage, kohlrabi maybe?
Anyway, it went over well at both parties and even my husband liked it.  
This is my new go-to slaw recipe :)

This is a great basic recipe to build on. I made it as shown first, but then second time I made some changes. First I cut the dressing ingredients in half. There was just too much the first time. Then I eliminated the buttermilk and increased the mayonnaise by 1/2 cup (remember I halved all the dressing ingredients!) and added 1/2 cup Greek yogurt to make up for the missing buttermilk. I used Dukes Mayo as it’s tangy and the recipe needed some zest. Final change was to stir in a Tbsp of horseradish. ( started by adding 2 tsp, tasted then added until I got the level of heat we like. Someone else might like less or omit it).  Yum! Took to a potluck and they gobbled it right up! I would tell anyone to start with the original recipe then change to suit your taste. The original is really good, but I love it after I made those few changes.

I found that this recipe makes a quantity of dressing suitable for a head of cabbage of about 3 lbs. or a little larger, weighed before trimming. For a thicker dressing, I increased the amount of mayonnaise to 1½ cups and decreased the buttermilk to 1½ cups. Cider vinegar works fine, as does Dijon mustard. I greatly decreased the sugar to 2 tablespoons (coleslaw isn't candy!), and added a teaspoon of ground black pepper. An entire sweet onion (which, as a measurement, is vague and unhelpful) is way too much, yielding sometimes more than 2 cups when minced. A third of a cup is plenty. I suggest using from 1 to 3 cups of grated carrot. (3 cups is very carroty. I bought 2 large carrots weighing 1 lb. together, before peeling and trimming, to get 3 cups.) All else was per the recipe. Do let the coleslaw macerate overnight. Stir occasionally, and always before serving. While this recipe doesn't have quite the classic coleslaw dressing taste, it's very good in its own right. The buttermilk can get a little funky after a couple of days, though.

I absolutely recommend this recipe to anyone who needs a great side salad for any kind of dinner or topping.  I have made this multiple times now and have tried several variations (i.e. adding more carrots or using yellow onions, or adding diced scallions) - each turning out excellent.  I would highly recommend substituting 2/3 of a cup sour cream blended with 1 1/3 cup whole milk if you don't have buttermilk handy. This definitely works too..

I believe this will be my go-to recipe for coleslaw from now on.  I questioned some of the ingredients, but went for it.  There was plenty of sauce for 2 pkgs of the store-bought shredded slaw mix.  I did cut back a little on the onion, personal preference, but don't think the full amount would be overwhelming.  It was fantastic!

The name of this dish doesn't give it justice.  It is so much more than a coleslaw.  It is quite honestly the most perfect addition to just about everything, and it makes for the best fish tacos and "Pittsburgh" sandwiches you'll ever eat!  Oh yeah, and we also put it  on Po Boys,  and slaw dogs topped with a little mustard.

This is excellent coleslaw and it got rave reviews from everyone at the BBQ where I took it. I halved the recipe and the only substitution that I made was that instead of using buttermilk, which I didn't have, I used a half a cup of milk and half a cup of Greek yogurt. This was so delicious and had that little bit of something different that I will certainly be making this again. Thanks Dave, it's a keeper!

I will definitely make this again! I only made 2 substitutions because of what I had on hand. I used 2 bags of 16 oz coleslaw mix and sour cream instead of buttermilk. I also cut the recipe in half because I didn't use a whole head of cabbage. It ended up being the perfect amount of sauce for 2 bags of mix and it was so good! It's still good if you don't wait before eating it but if you wait as directed, it's even better.

I grew up on Cape Cod in Massachusetts and we had some pretty wonderful seafood places.  The smell and taste of this coleslaw created such a pleasantly nostalgic experience for me that I know I'll use this recipe for life. In my opinion, it is perfect.  Thank you for posting it.

It tasted wonderful. I will definitely use this recipe many times. The only thing I would do differently next time is to reduce one cup of buttermilk. This time too soupy. 
I added two table spoon of sriracha sauce to take place of cayenne pepper as I do not have any.

I thought the taste was great, a personal preference was to reduce the sugar and reduce the measurement of the liquid ingredients to make it less sweet and a bit thicker.

Used a small bag of precut cabbage with carrots and just cut the othe ingredients in half, except for the cayenne because we like a bite.  Topped our BBQ chicken sandwiches with the slaw as soon as I combined all ingredients and it was so delicious! I bet it'll be even better tomorrow night in fish tacos!!

Followed the directions exactly adding 1 sweet onion and 3 green onions. Way too much onion and I love onions.  The onion that I added was a smaller sweet onion.

Thanks Dave!  It gave me a great starting point. I coarsely grated the carrot, cabbage and onions - chopping the pieces that were too close to the end to grate. I didn't add mustard or dill pickles however and substituted seasoned rice vinegar for the dill pickle juice and white pepper for the cayenne pepper. The buttermilk, mayo, sugar consistency was perfect!! Added a teaspoon of celery seed because I'm from the south. Served it with pulled pork sandwiches and it was a hit!!

This was a very good coleslaw, and very tasty on pulled pork BBQ sandwich. I only used enough of the dressing to moisten the slaw--I didn't want it too sloppy. The recipe doesn't specify the size of the head of cabbage --I bought a huge one and ended up only using half of it for a large party. The size of the pickle and onion also are not specified. I used 3 thumb-sized pickles, and probably will  add 1 or 2 more next time. I didn't add the green onions because I thought the large Vidalia was enough. But I want to try them. I really liked the lightness and flavor that the buttermilk added to the dressing.

This is my first time making coleslaw and it turned out great! The ratio of dressing ingredients worked well. It was very refreshing. I put in 1/2 the onion because I'm not a fan of raw onion, and I also didn't have pickles so just put in a pinch of dill. When I have them on hand I will make this again. Great recipe!

I've used this recipe about 8 times and my husband keeps asking for it. There is a lot of dressing but I just shred a bit more cabbage and carrot.  Great with pulled pork, excellent for lunches the following week.  I think the dill pickle and juice is the secret ingredient.  Love this recipe!

I halved the recipe and still ended up with more than my family could possibly eat in a week.  Although I liked it, it wasn't any better than simpler recipes. I won't make it again for that reason.

I really like the balance of flavors - tangy, spicy, a bit sweet (but not too sweet). I tend to prefer less sweet and more tangy coleslaw so I did halve the sugar (used 1/4c), and I'm glad I did because for me that was just right! I also used red cabbage. Very tasty dressing...mmm...thanks!

Tested this recipe before family cookout with pulled pork sandwiches.  I will be making it for the cookout, it tastes amazing and I think the hint of pickles will be amazing when the coleslaw is put on the pulled pork sandwiches.  My new go to recipe for coleslaw. (I did cut the dressing in half as recommended by the author and I thought it was perfect)

Great slaw recipe, thanks Dave!  I used a 16 oz bag of precut red and green cabbage with carrots.  I added additional 5 baby shredded carrots since there didn't seem to be much carrot in the precut ingredients.  I halved the dressing since I read all the other reviews.  I also used 2 green onions and about 3/4 cup of sweet onion.  That was plenty of onion. I did add more cayenne since I like my slaw to have a nice kick.  I used 4 packets of Truvia instead of sugar.  Our family follows the Primal lifestyle and try to avoid white sugar. I omitted the garlic and used season salt.  I use Morton's season salt on everything since I love it.  It's so easy and it has salt, pepper and garlic in it. The slaw only marinated about 4 hours before we ate it and it was still great.  I'm sure the left overs will be awesome tomorrow.  Thank you for a great recipe that really makes an ordinary BBQ side dish outstanding!

I'm usually not a big fan of coleslaw; too goopy and too sweet.  I really wanted coleslaw to go with pulled pork, however.  This recipe intrigued me because of sharp ingredients like mustard, pickles and vinegar. I thought that would complement the pork nicely. I cut way down on the sugar and on the mayo and Greek yogurt (which I substituted for the buttermilk since that's what I had).  Turned out I enjoyed this a lot! I may shock some of my friends that I will actually make coleslaw as a side dish in the future simply because I like it; if it's this recipe, that is.

I just finished making this recipe and doubled it.  It will sit in the fridge overnight to be served for Easter early dinner for 20 people.  I didn't have pickles and used pickle relish,instead, so no juice.  I added more cayenne.  From what I tasted before putting it in the fridge, it tasted delicious.  I am a coleslaw fan, so let's see how it goes with the fam!

Amazing! This is the best coleslaw recipe.  1 head of cabbage is about 2 bags of shredded (15 0z bags).  I used half the amount of buttermilk. The addition of 1 apple finely cubed mixed with 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice made this even better!

I made this as written but eliminated the onion. I liked it well enough, but it wasn't our favorite. I'd probably eliminate the pickle an pickle juice next time. The cayenne was a great touch.

Amazing. Best coleslaw ever! I doubled the garlic, added cilantro, red pepper flakes and fresh red bell peer (for color) and cut 1/2 of the regular mustard with sweet and hot mustard. So delicious and so fun to experiment and hit different flavor notes by changing up the ingredients!

I tried this because I wanted a coleslaw to go with pulled pork.  Made the recipe as instructed except I substituted the buttermilk for a "faux" ( regular milk with a whole fresh lemon juiced and whisked into it) and I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. 
I also added sunflower seeds.
Wonderful coleslaw recipe. 
Thank you!

Very rich, creamy dressing. I was hesitant to add the pickle but it makes a nice touch! I ended up with twice the amount of dressing I needed though. I guess I will have to make it again soon ;)

Just made this. It's 'marrying' in the fridge right now. Sample taste was delicious. Can't wait for dinner!

Wasn't really thrilled.  It's okay...edible... but not magnificent.  I'm not exactly sure what would make it better, or if I should try.

Great!  I didn't have buttermilk, but it turned out just great without it.  Will make again!

this was really good.  I halved the ingredients as I didn't need the large quantity.  I substituted the dill pickle for sweet relish as per another's rating.  Also substituted half the mayo for plain Greek yogurt.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing the recipe

This was a good place to start.  I added some cayenne pepper for some additional zip.

Just excellent! Both my hubby and I love this recipe. I added some dried dillweed. Buttermilk or sour cream, both good. 
Yummy, yummy, yummy! Thanks for sharing and all your work on perfecting it :)

I must admit I was little disappointed.  I made a fabulous pulled pork and wanted this to go along but I found the recipe really soupy and washed out.  I will try it again with some modifications from the other reviews.  I hope it will turn out better next time.

This is really a great recipe.  Prepared as is will be great for almost anyone although I prefer a little less buttermilk (so it's a little less slopply) and I go a little heavy on the pepper.
