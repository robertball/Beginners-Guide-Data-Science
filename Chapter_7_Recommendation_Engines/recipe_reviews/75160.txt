This recipe was perfect! I was a little hesitant since the other reviews said it didn't thicken, however, I was delightfully surprised when it did. I beat it with the mixer for approx 5 mins & it turned out delicious & beautiful! It isn't super, sickening, sweet & it makes the perfect amount of icing for a 9x13 sheet cake. Thanks IBLONG2JCH - this will be a recipe I use frequently :-)

had to cool in the fridge overnight, then warmed up in microwave and dipped cupcake tops in to coat. it cooled to a perfect sheen. it wasn't too sweet, and looked very impressive.

My Husband LOVED it! I used as an icing on Beer Cake 1 (on this site, substituted chocolate pudding for vanilla) He said it was the BEST icing he had ever had.I also added a few andes mints and melted them in for just a slightly minty flavor. will definatly use this recipe again.

i love this recipe for the fact it isn't sicking sweet. While it didn't thicken as recipe says next time I will either try  letting it cool first or adding a teaspoon of cornstarch to recipe with other ingredients  to bring to boil. Also for a Bundt cake I think half a recipe would be sufficent for a great glaze.

this was too thick, and I didnt even beat it after the boiling and stirring for 1 minute. But, very fudgey, and delicious, worth trying again!

Easy to make!  Great when you don't have or don't want to use powdered sugar!  This is a rich glaze for cookies!  I used it on Habanero Cookies, and it was wonderful!

This is wonderful frosting! I did cook it almost an additional minute after reading the reviews and it came out perfect. I wonder if some of the cooks that had trouble with it thickening are too young to remember old fashioned fudge (the very very best). You have to beat it...... a LOT! Just keep beating it and it will set up.

It's a great frosting But the "one-minute" is a lie. Had to mix for several minutes for it to set up.

So yummy!  I needed a recipe without confectioner's sugar and this did the trick!  I did beat it for 5 minutes and it was the perfect consistency.

Fudgey and delicious! I was looking for a frosting that doesn't use (to sweet) confectionary sugar and found this one..  The trick is to stir, stir, stir on medium heat. Thickened nicely as it cooled and it wasn't gritty.. I will deffenately make this again...

i found this to be a lovely recipe.  not too sweet, and a very pretty, shiny frosting.  it sets up very quickly, but i just popped it into the microwave for 15 seconds and it was pliable and shiny once more.  love this recipe so much more than buttercream.
