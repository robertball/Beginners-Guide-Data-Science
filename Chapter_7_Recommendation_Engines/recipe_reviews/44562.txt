I was hesitant in trying this recipe because of the amount of sugar and margarine called for, but still wanted to give it a try. I did change the recipe a little, used butter instead of margarine, omitted the walnuts for personal preferance, and baked in a bundt pan because I don't have a 10x15 pan. Stayed with the 2 cups of sugar even though I thought it was too much, but ended up not too sweet like I thought it would. It was a very moist cake, but the next time I make it will try grating the apples instead of chopping and using applesauce to replace some of the butter and spicing it up a bit more with cloves and nutmeg. Definatly a cake worth making again.

Great recipe! I messed with it a bit too much and it ended up taking over 2 hours to cook! Totally my fault though... I first soaked the raisins in Appleton rum, then I added an instant butterscotch pudding packet because my husband loves butterscotch (I think this is where I messed up the cooking time). The batter was way too thick, plus I think I chopped my apples a little too coarsely. In any case, I’m soaking more raisins right now and I’m going to make this again tomorrow without the pudding.
