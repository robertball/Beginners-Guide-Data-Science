Wonderful, easy recipe.  I made it lowfat, using ground turkey, fat-free evaporated milk, and omitting the cheese.  Couldn't even tell it was lowfat! I would highly recommend this recipe if you're feeding a crowd and short on time. Goes well with a salad.

The flavors in this are excellent and the cornmeal base is easier to prepare than it sounds. I've made this a few times now and I've tweaked it a little here and there, using 1% milk instead of the canned milk and water. I also used a jalapeno salsa instead of the green chiles in one batch along with a bunch of cilantro and it was fantastic. The good thing is that you can pretty much add what you want to the meat mixture and it comes out great. One hint, you might want to lightly spray your pan with non-stick spray.

Good recipe. I used Marie Calendar's Corn Bread mix instead of the cornmeal and also added cumin to the recipe.  Have made several times.

The meat mixture is the only thing good about this recipe.  The cornmeal mixture is way too much.  I think if would be much better if you were to just make the cornmeal according to regular cornbread directions.  My husband hated it.

Great recipe!  I spiced it up a bit by adding a serrano and jalapeno pepper to the filling, as well as a little cumin and extra garlic. Quick and tasty meal!

This was really good! I'm going to try it with chicken next time and add some shredded cheddar to the cornbread.  Delicious!

Have made it twice now and both turned out wonderful!  This last go round I used left over grilled chicken (diced), and put jalepeno peppers in the cornbread mixture.  Wonderful dish especially for those night you haven't alot of time.

I made this for my two teenage sons and they loved it. I added a little cumin and chili powder to the meat/sauce mixture to give it a bit more flavor. We had a little leftover and it tasted better the next day.....        TIP:Don't cook cornmeal too long, it will get too thick and hard.

Kind of bland, my family just thought it was okay, I think maybe the cornmeal needed to be kicked up.

For my first time making a tamale pie, the end results were great.  Since acquring this recipe, I have made a pie, twice. This is really a great recipe.

I make a veggie version by sauteing a chopped onion, green pepper, and a can of whole kernel corn together, then adding 2 cans of pinto or black beans and cooking until beans begin to become thick and start to fall apart a little. 

After I put the beans on top, I push a whole green olive (pitted) through into the lower crust every few inches throughout the pie. To me green olives add a LOT to this recipe, though kids might not be fans. 

I love tamale pie!

Here is the modifications I made: I only used the evaporated milk with 3/4 cup of cornmeal.  I also used half a bunch green onions in the meat mixture.  It's very tasty.

Nice flavor, but sort of plain.  I will spice it up next time.

I forgot to add the chilies to the corn meal mixture until too late, so added them to the meat mixture.  Turned out great!  Served with salsa. Excellent!

This was pretty good--reminds me of a dish my mother prepared when I was a child.
