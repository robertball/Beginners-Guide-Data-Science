I used frozen wild berries and melted them along with the peanut butter and honey... and I don't use microwaves so I used a saucepan on the stove and the results were amazing! Thank you for the inspiration!

If I could give this more stars, I would!  Super easy and tastes great.  A wonderful healthy snack.  What I also love about this recipe, is that it is very versatile.  The second time I made it, I tried a different variety by adding raisins, and unsweetened coconut flakes instead of the berries.  It was great too!  I think next time I will use a different nut butter (maybe cashew?)  and add a few whole cashews into the mix.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!   Thank you for this healthy, tasty and very simple recipe!  :)

Great recipe.  Yummy! The recipe provides a flexible base. Used almond butter and some blueberries too. As long as the nut butter and honey are soft, I don't think you need to microwave them. Microwaving honey isn't great for it. Thanks for the fun recipe.
