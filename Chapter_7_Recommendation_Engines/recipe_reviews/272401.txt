Simple and delicious recipe. I made it according to the instructions except I only had Dijon mustard in the house. My chicken thighs were skinless and boneless. The oven time was spot on and I let the chicken rest about ten minutes before serving with saffron rice and chopped green onions for garnish. Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef Mo.

I tasted the sauce before I cooked off the alcohol and was nervous because it was bright and sharp but the bourbon/mustard/marmalade combo once cooked down was super interesting and complex. I will make again because it was basically a measure-dump-cook meal that was delicious. Some nights you just don t feel like food prep.
