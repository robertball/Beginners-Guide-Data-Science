Very pretty, but kind of bland; I made the following changes; 1) after pureeing the carrots, add *double* all of the spices and juices (I use orange/lemon juice/zest interchangeably), as well as 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 2) beat the cream cheese until soft, adding about 1/4 cup of white sugar while beating, 3) add the carrot mixture in halves to the cream cheese, beating until smooth after each addition, scraping the bowl frequently, 4) after adding the eggs and pouring into the crust, place the springform into a hot water bath, reaching about halfway up the pan.  Bake as directed.  Comes out crack-free, creamy and smooth.

I used strained babyfood carrots to cut the prep time.

I made this recipe for a meeting and was a little disappointed.  Even using the water bath it cracked and a skin formed.  I ultimately removed the unsightly skin and topped it with whipped cream and chopped pecans.  My guests loved it and asked for the recipe, but I was not impressed with the flavor.  It tasted more like a pumpkin cheesecake than carrot cake (and not a very good pumpkin cheesecake).  I was really looking forward to a flavor more like an actual carrot cake.   The crust was very good and the cheesecake was easy to make.  I sent the leftovers home with one of my guests.  I don't think that I will make this one again.

This came out fantastic! I made this last Christmas and not one other dessert was touched on the dessert table. I have reputation for good cheesecake (for my own recipie) and this one didn't tarnish that reputation at all! Highly recommend to other bakers.

This is a wonderful dessert!  It's a rich color, and the flavor is delightful.  A welcome change from the more common fruit-topped cheesecakes.

Well to say, this carrot cheesecake was VERY elegant looking and simply looked the part. The recipe was very easy to do. I didn't do a water bath for it and thought I should because the ingredients were processed in a food processor. It did crack, not like I thought it was going to, but mainly around the outer edge of the dessert and that wasn't that bad at all. I choose to keep my pecans in halved peices verses chopped.  However, I followed to a T. Texture wise, the cheesecake was right on point with creamy and smoothness. The crust was by far superior with texture and flavor. I'd make the crust again. Because it held it's form when cutting and overall look and the flavor of the crust was really good. However the flavor of the cheesecake was a bit different. I found the zesting of the orange over-powering in flavor as well as the spices. It did taste similar to pumpkin and so it was just not what I expected. I would totally tone down the orange and spice flavor to see if the carrot flavor would shine through. Having said that. I can see changing the carrot to a sweet potato OR pumpkin. I don't want to say it was overly bad but I won't say it was the best either. It was just okay. My husband however said, that it wasn't his favorite but was okay. Not something he would totally request me to make again, unless I've perfected a great flavor. If you like a faux pumpkin cheesecake, then this is for you.

I changed this recipe to make mini cheesecakes instead.  I don't have a springform pan.  It turned out great.  My husband, who doesn't like cheesecake, ate 3.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've used this recipe many times. It's preety easy to make once you get the hang of it.But even more important to me is that it is very deliciousand the rave at the end of a meal with acup of coffe ,tea or capucinno(which by the way is a great complament to this dessert).It's not a cheese cake to make with children ,I use recipes for refrigerator cheese cakes with the kids.Try this recipe yourselves you won't regret it.

I tried to follow this recipe exactly but I have never seen a food processor big enough to handle this filling! I did as much as I could in mine and then dumped it in a bowl and used an electric hand mixer to beat in the cream cheese. Otherwise it was nice and easy.  As for finished product, it tasted great, similar to pumpkin flavor, and the texture was firm and creamy. The top cracked, but mine usually do, and I actually think it makes it seem more homemade and authentic, and anyway the taste is far more important than appearance, and it tasted great! I'm a little ashamed to admit, but for the sake of review, six of us finished off the whole pie in one evening!

I love to make cheesecake and am told often how great mine is, so when I said I was bringing a carrot cheesecake to Easter dinner, everyone was excited.  Anytime I make any other cheesecake, there is not a bit left over.  I ended up taking most of this one home because no one cared for it. The flavor was more like a gingered pumpkin pie than a corrot cake.

Nothing impressive.  I didn't put  in the mace.  I couldn't really taste carrots., the spices overpowered.

Besides upping the spices, I followed this recipe as it was written. The result is a pumpkin pie-like cheesecake -- nice, but the cheesiness didn't come through (perhaps because of the added spices?). The crust was excellent and I used a water bath, so no problems with cracking. But my family didn't rave about this one, so I won't be making it again.

Perfect dessert . Not too sweet or spicy and a nice way to end a meal without competing with the meal.  This will be my new Thanksgiving Day Pumpkin Pie....
