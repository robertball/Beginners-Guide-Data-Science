I've spent years trying to find a good Campbells Bean & Bacon soup clone - - - this is it!  Made as directed and it was good.  Tweaked it just a bit by noting the following:  to keep your beans from staying too hard, don't add salt or tomato sauce until beans are soft;  I did the ole "boil the beans for a minute, let sit for an hour" thing with fine results; Used a mixture of navy, northern, and pinto beans; puree apx 1/3rd of soup to give it more consistency;  Outstanding flavor - my thanks for the recipe !!!

When I cook for the homeless, this recipe is easy and multiplies great! I usually make it with 10 lbs of dry pintos. I substitute turkey bacon and beef kielbasa for the bacon. Everyone loves this soup!

Very good and very flavorful! My 3 year old scarfed it down. The only thing that differed was the beans took forever to become tender, but that always happens to me. Next time I will try it in the slow cooker. Thanks Buffy!

This could have worked well, but all those peppers was way too much for me. One, maybe even a half of one, would have been enough. Needs work.

This recipe is great!  I left out the cilantro and jalapeno for milder palates.  It reminded me of my favorite "canned" soup I had as a child.  I made the recipe as stated except used canned white beans instead of soaking and cooking the pintos.  It was good, just a little too salty.  Next time I used low-sodium broth, bacon, tomato sauce, and beans.  What a wonderful recipe!!!

1. This soup was absolutely delicious!
2. When I made this I used 5 cups chicken stock almost 2 cups of beans, a whole large jalepeno, half a package of bacon, and almost a whole large can of tomato sauce. This turned out WAY too spicy. It also was not meaty enough and a bit watery. The beans also didn't cook in time advertised in the recipe.

I was skeptical that a recipe with such basic ingredients would be any good, but this soup is delicious!  I didn't add the tomatoes until the end, when the beans were soft.  I made a 1/4 recipe and only used one large pepper, but it was plenty spicy.  Thanks!

This was delicious  I did adjust it though.  I had a ham bone and some ham which I used instead of the bacon. I did add some bacon grease.  I substituted 2 cans of rotel tomatoes (original) for the tomato sauce and jalapeno peppers.  I also left out the cilantro.  (2 cans for 8 servings)

This can really taste like Bean & Bacon soup with 16 oz. bag navy beans, water, grated carrot, diced celery stalk & leaves, a little piece of onion diced.  I used ham flavored bouillon & chicken bouillon, one bay leaf, 8 oz. can tomato sauce and  black pepper.  I cooked diced bacon and added it in after it was almost done cooking.  It was great!

This is Awesome! I made it the first time per the recipe as written. tasted just like the one out of the can. I did find that I liked it when I pureed half of the soup. This time I am making it with chopped green chili's instead of the jalapeno's. Smells good cooking right now!

Used two small poblano peppers instead of all the jalpeno peppers and it was just the right spice. Added more carrot and a few small stalks of celery and fresh tomatoes instead of canned sauce as I had produce to use up, same with real garlic rather than powdered - all but the youngest child ate it up - even though the veggies were pureed so he couldn't "find" them to pick them out.

This was OK.  Too much tomato sauce, in my opinion.  Might try it again with less (or none).

Used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added cilantro and salt 15 minutes before serving.  Otherwise made as directed and really enjoyed this soup.

We enjoyed this soup.  My husband thought it was just right for spice.  I thought it was a little spicier than I usually like but I ate it anyway.  I only used 1 pound of beans and didn't add the tomato sauce until the end of cooking time like some other reviews mentioned.  I also pureed a portion and added it back to the soup to make it a little thicker.  Loved the flavors.

After all the five star ratings, I expected a lot more. I found it extremely (!!!!!)  bland and am now trying to figure out what to put in 20 finished cups of this soup to give it some flavor.

Whew!  I'd give 10 stars if I could.  Only change was no cilantro but it didn't need it.  This rocks.  We ate the whole pot on this rainy day couldn't help ourselves.

This was very good.  It makes a lot.  I did use green chilis instead of the Jalepenos.  I was afraid it would be too hot.  Next time I will try using a few jalepenos.

This was very good... had to ad lib on the peppers though.  Didn't have any whole jalapenos, so I seeded some pickled jalapeno slices and chopped them up.  Also didn't have actual Cilantro, so I used some Ground Corriander (about 1/2 tsp.), which is the seed of Cilantro.  Soup turned out great.  Oh, and for those of you that think it's too thin... I let it simmer the first hour covered... then continued to simmer uncovered for a couple more hours.  Reduced beautifully to a nice (I'd have to say creamy) consistency.

i love recipes that require simple ingredients and still yield a surprisingly good result. i halved this and only used 3 slices of bacon and it still was very good. make sure you watch this and keep adding liquid as you go or the beans will burn. i didnt have broth so i used water and added the bouillon once the beans had softened quite a bit(i have had bad luck w/ salting beans before they have become tender in the past).hubby really liked this. paired w/ quesadillas made w/leftover shredded beef this made a very inexpensive meal.

Great soup recipe.  Unfortunately did not have any cilantro, but it was great, all the same.  The only other thing that I changed was using black beans instead of pinto beans, because that is what I had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe, Buffy.

I enjoyed this very much. I will probably make it again but either leave a few jalapeno seeds in there for more spice or add a little cayenne pepper. I may also try it with a different bean like black bean or adzuki.

Best soup ever! I omitted the jalapeño peppers since we aren’t fans of that much spice. Our 18-month-old granddaughter loved it too!

I halved the bacon and also added some diced sausage and a half bunch of chopped kale and 2 bouillon cubes for flavor.  What an easy and delicious recipe!

Great recipe. Only thing I did different: I always cook large batches of dried beans in the slow cooker and freeze into smaller portions to use when needed. The pintos I thawed for the soup had been preseasoned with cumin, lime juice, and garlic. It was a pleasant addition to the existing recipe.

My last review got posted before I was finished writing- used 1/2 can diced green chillies instead of jalapeño, one can organic pinto drained, 28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes-drained, 4 cups chicken broth.  Sautéed bacon onion garlic carrots potatoes. Put all in vitamix on soup setting except bacon and beans- added bacon for a few pulses and dumped beans in and stirred. Toddler loved it! Husband added cholula.

Oh, yes. To add to my review, I used turkey bacon and dried cilantro and it was lovely.

My family spent two day in this soup (because we make our own chicken stock which just makes everything better, if you have the time I recommend that), and let me tell you it was totally worth it.  Not only did my house smell incredible while it was cooking, but it was probably one of the best soups I've ever had.  Now, I have read other reviews about the peppers making it too spicy, well this is a SPICY soup, it's in the title.  And the spiciness of the peppers is always a game of chance, you might get mild ones and you might not.  We were lucky and the peppers we got were nice and spicy and added a lot of flavor.  The only thing we did different was add a little more of each ingredient (we have a big family and we eat a lot). We did make our own chicken stock to use the day before and I recommend homemade corn bread as a side, it complimented the soup very nicely.

I made this as directed, except that I soaked the beans overnight and pureed part of the soup.  I thought the soup was excellent.  Very flavorful.

This was a good recipe. The only thing I did different was I used a small can of chopped jalapenos.  It had a little zing but was really good.  I would suggest that you not add any salt until you let the bacon cook with the beans for awhile.  Some bacon can be really salty. This way you can season to taste.
