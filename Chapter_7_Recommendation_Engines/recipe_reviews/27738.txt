I made this last night for dinner, it was good my kids like it which is always plus for me, Although I would reccommend to add potatoes when chicken is half cooked, cause by the time chicken get tender potatoes were mushed, I will make it again.

Pretty solid recipe. The chicken and potatoes definitely soaked up all the spices and they tasted great. The sauce could have been thicker and more flavorful but overall a simple and tasty recipe.

Recipe was definitely okay, but not especially flavoursome. Next time I would add one or two diced onions at the beginning and fry until translucent, then add the chicken. I hope that would add more flavour and I would then reduce the amount of yogurt slightly.

This was very good.  The spices and herbs really made this recipe.  It was a meal in itself.  I used two packages of frozen spinach--defrosted in the microwave and squeezed out the juices.

I made this recipe yesterday.  As written, I think it would have been really plain.  I tripled all the spices (except the cayenne--I doubled that)  I used ground cumin instead of cumin seeds (1 tsp all together)  and I didn't have black mustard seeds but used regular mustard seeds instead. I also didn't have cardamom so I used chinese five spice.  I used 6 skinless chicken drumsticks, 2 pints of tomatoes I canned last summer plus a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I used half a quart bag of frozen swiss chard (squeezed all the water out) that I had frozen from the garden last year and diced 3 potatoes.  I put all of this in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hrs.  I then deboned the chicken and added it back to the sauce and added 2 cups of greek yogurt.  It was still pretty bland, However, as it sat and cooled a little the flavors really started to pop!  Had a little later before bed and it was really good!  This is one of those recipes that get better as it sits.  Will make this again with the changes I made but will make it in advance.  Would be excellent as one of my cook for a month meals and frozen for use later!

Very tasty with a few adjustments.  After reading reviews that said this was a bit bland, I doubled the spices (except the cayenne) and added diced onion and ginger with the garlic.  Also, my husband has a dairy allergy and I couldn't find any soy yogurt so I used coconut milk instead... wonderful flavour!

I was looking for recipes with Swiss Chard and chicken and this one fit the bill. It took extra time to make up some garam masala as I was out (dry roasting cumin, coriander, cardamon, black pepper, clove & cinnamon).  After reading the reviews, I added the stems of the chard with an onion and carrots and parsley and cooked them with the chicken.  I used less olive oil and added ! 1/4 c. homemade chicken stock.  If I was cooking for myself, I would have added the full amount of cayenne pepper, but toned it down for my  children.  

Like the other reviewers, I vastly increased the amount of spices, especially the cumin and really could have added even more, though my son thought that the spices were pungent, but I didn't think they were strong.  I served it over brown bastimati rice and have several containers leftover to take for lunches!  I also used Greek Yogurt which made it a little creamier sauce.

It needed to have more sauce (used soy milk instead of yogurt - try yogurt next time); perhaps it was because I had more chicken than it asked for even though I increased the spices.  Doubled the spices to give it more flavor. Did not have cardamom so I subbed cinnamon & nutmeg in its place. Used a whole bunch of chard b/c I wouldn't know what else I would do with the rest of the bunch. Used 3 whites potatoes; peeled and parboiled a little but it still took awhile to cook the potatoes.

Good flavor, but chicken got overcooked while waiting for potatoes to cook.  Next time I would parboil potatoes before adding them.  Also- add yogurt at end so it does not separate if heat gets high.

Excellent dish! I doubled the spices. I also didn't have yogurt so I left that out. I did add 1/2 c. soy milk in it's stead. The dish was fabulous and will definitely make it again. My daughter loved it too!

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe.  Since we like spicy foods, we followed the suggstions of others to double the spices.   We could not find black mustard seed, so we used yellow mustard seed as a substitute.  Further, we served without the rice.  Highly recommend!

This recipe tasted good when all was said and done, but I had a totally different experience that many of the other reviewers. I added an onion in the beginning and subbed frozen (drained and thawed) spinach for the chard. I fried the chicken, onion and potato for 15 minutes on medium, and even though the chopped red potato was still hard, I did as the recipe said. 1 cup of yogurt was not enough - there was absolutely no sauce. I added another half cup. Then I covered and continued to cook. However, the potatoes took another 30 minutes and even then they were still a bit crispy! Also, the flavor, which seemed like it would be great, was basically non-exisistent. I added a teaspoon and a half of curry powder. There was next-to-no sauce. I couldn't believe how much food this actually turned out to be. I would have added much more spice in the beginning if I knew how bland it would be. After an hour and half of chopping and cooking, i just wanted to eat the food already! Ultimately, it was too much work for the end result. I'm going back to my trusty jar of curry paste with chicken, tomatoes and onion.

All four of us liked this, including my kids, so those recipes are always winners. I doubled the reciple and made some substitutions to accommodate what I had on hand - kale for the swiss chard, a can of light coconut milk for the yogurt, a can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, boneless chicken breasts for the thighs. Next time, I will definitely double the spices and add an onion and probably some grated fresh ginger for a little more flavor.

Automatically doubled spices because of the reviews. However, didn't have cumin seed, so just used crushed cumin and didn't have mustard seeds. I also added a little yellow curry powder. We had this with coconut jasmine rice...yum!

This was very tastey.  I added a whole diced onion in the beginning and I know this may sound wierd but I melted some brie in it instead of yogurt.  It gave it excellent flavor and creaminess.  Next time I'll also add a bit more spices.  I will add this into the regular rotation, thanks for the new recipe!

I added a chopped yellow onion with the garlic and I doubled all the spices (except the salt).  I like my Indian food on the spicy side anyway, and the current spice measurements didn't quite cover the potatoes and the chicken.  Good flavors overall though.

I thought the spice blend was amazing (I doubled everything to get the chicken and potatoes super flavorful), but I didn't particularly enjoy the chard/tomato combo in this. I may try this again using different veggies--I bet bell peppers would be delicious.

Fabulous if you double the spices except for the cayenne.  I substituted light coconut milk for the yogurt.  And served it with soy sour cream on the side.  Company meal for sure.

I couldn't find any cumin seed or black mustard seed so I used ground cumin and ground yellow mustard powder, so maybe that's why this was so bland. Also, I used spinach instead of the swiss chard. So, perhaps it wasn't the recipe that was the problem. It was okay, but not something I would make again.

Excellent taste. I didn't have yogurt on hand, so used light sour cream. Love the flavour of this dish - definitely a hit.

This is excellent, BUT you MUST at least double the spices, although i could do without the double cayenne pepper next time! I used ground cumin, didne have seeds, and yellow mustard seeds. I nuked the potatoes about 4 minutes before adding to the chicken, to be sure they would cook through. I had some store bought yellow curry in a jar and i added (about 1/4 cup) because i wanted more of the spice and flavor. After adding all the ingredients, I thought this was a bit watery  moisture from the potatoes and the chard so i took 3/4 mug full of the sauce and whisked it with some flour, then added to the pot to thicken. Overall this is a great recipe, I just had too much chicken (I used 4 chicken breasts because that is what i had defrosted), and I am not one to measure things but instead eyeball it, so next time I will make a LOT more of the sauce! I will definately make again, with a little less hot pepper and more of the other spices.
