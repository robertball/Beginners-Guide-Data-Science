The taste was just okay.  The filling was bland so I added some soy sauce and a dash of salt.  We used hoisin sauce as a dip to compliment the Juan Tons.  Our family liked the texture of the wraps after they were pan fried and steamed.  From there, I used the same technique for other types of hot wraps.

These were so good. They were a little bit labor intensive, since I decided to make my own tortillas, but I think the flavor was fantastic because of it and they were worth it in the end! I ended up throwing in a pinch of sugar, a squirt of soy sauce, some ginger, onion, and cayenne pepper into the filling, and left out the egg. I will definitely make these again with my changes, since everyone loved them! Give them a try! The technique alone is worth it!

These were super fun to make! I had several recipes going at the same time and left out the egg by accident but they still worked just fine. The cabbage/meat ratio is spot on but I did think the mix was a tad bland. The next time I make these I'll throw in a couple of shakes of soy sauce. Again, super fun! Thanks for sharing!
