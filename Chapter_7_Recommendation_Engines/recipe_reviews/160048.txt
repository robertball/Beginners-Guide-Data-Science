I used fresh beets instead of canned, just boiled them for about 10 minutes before continuing with recipe. Loved it!!

This recipe was perfect!  My neighbor gave me some beets, I baked them at 325 for an hour, let them cool a bit and then used this recipe.   I wanted a recipe that didn't need pickling spices, because I didn't have that on hand....this was exactly like grandmas!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love these! I'm a big fan of pickled beets, but they are expensive in the stores. These are great and I wouldn't change a thing. Since I like them so well, I doubled the recipe. They are really good!!

I also sliced some red onions, very very thin, and added those. Used fresh beets as well.

These were delicious.  I used fresh beets.  I will make them again.  Don't forget to remove the cloves before serving....I missed one and my brother-in-law got an unpleasant surprise.  AFTER MAKING MANY MORE TIMES:  I don't use whole cloves, I use about a tsp of powdered cloves.  I am asked for this recipe over and over.  I always use fresh beets.

I was looking for something similar to my mother's pickled beets. I had to add more sugar to get the taste I wanted. The cinnamon added a pleasant surprise!

These were absolutely delicious.  I will use this recipe from now on when I cook beats.  I doubled it because I had more beets to use, but I think I will try it with maybe less sugar next time.

Tasted really good. The cinnamon gave a real subtle boost in flavor. My daughter who has strong taste buds really enjoyed it. Will do it for guests.

So EASY, so DELICIOUS!! I made the recipe before just as it was written and we loved it. I made it again recently, but w/ beets from our garden. I forgot about needing to save the beet broth from cooking them and couldn't as I didn't clean them fully before boiling. Having looked at other recipes that incl orange zest, I got the idea to use 1/2 c orange juice and a splash of water instead. They turned out wonderfully tangy sweet w/ the smell and gentle taste of the orange too. And they are so pretty. I'm giving little jars of them as Christmas gifts; no one will expect this of me so I can't wait!

I didn't have my Mother's recipe for red beet eggs, so I went looking and compared several different recipes.  I followed this recipe except I used 1/4 teas. of ground cloves, 1/4 teas each of cinnemon and salt.  My husband LOVES red beet eggs and he gave them a "5".   This is a keeper!

Use beets from the Green Giant Veggie Spirals® selections, omit cloves, add onion powder, substitute sugar with Truvia baking blend (be aware of equivalent chart on back of bag). Mix cold beets with ingredients, let sit a few minutes and drain, then devour!

I had 3 medium sized fresh beets from a farmer's market down the street.  As I Iove pickled beets so much, I decided to pickle them myself rather than just cook them as usual or buy the canned version.  I peeled, thickly sliced and poached them in about 1.5 cups of water in a sauce pan. I removed the pieces with a slotted spoon, and to the sauce pan added to the hot beet juices the sugar, vinegar,  3 T squeezable ginger pulp (that has salt added to the mix) and a cinnamon stick to the pan, and proceeded with the directions. I did not add extra salt because the ginger pulp already had it. The only addition was ginger. I was out of ground cinnamon so used 1 stick in lieu of.  
After jarring and allowing to cool with the lid tight until it was room temperature, I transferred the jar to the fridge for 5 days.  

Myyyyyyyyyyyyy..... these were delicious, lightly spiced for January and they are simply beautiful atop my green salad with goat cheese and candied walnuts.  

I will be making more for a potluck next week.  

Thank you so much for the recipe!

I’ve been using this recipe for some time now. They are like the ones my mother used to can and store in the cellar. This way I can make some whenever I am hungry for pickled beets and don’t have to make a big batch.

My husband said they tasted just like his grandmothers. I also used fresh beets and followed the receipt the 1st time, the second time I used less sugar. The longer they sit, the better they taste, but I encourage you to cut the beets as uniformly as possible for  consistency, (or not!) either way, yummy.

My mother would can pickled beets from scratch. These Sweet and Sour Beets are just as good wil 1% of the work. I love them and I keep a jar in my refrigerator at all times. I always double the recipe

Great simple recipe. I had a few large beets I cooked in the oven & started craving that pickled beet flavor. I just sliced them up and cooked them in the mixture for 5 minutes like it says and they are excellent. I added a little sliced onion & a bay leaf in the jar. Can't wait for them to chill!

I used fresh beets, so I deviated from the original recipe, but the flavor after 1 day marinating is close to, but not as smooth as delicatessen bought beets.

LOVED this recipe. I was a little skeptical about the cinnamon but it was subtle and complemented the flavours well. Next time, I'll quadruple the recipe and add eggs and pearl onions.

Very easy to make and always delicious, even if you mix up the steps! These taste just like the ones Grandma used to make. They add color to any table, and are delicious on a green salad with blue cheese.
