I had two friends over for a "martini sampling night"--- this was low on the list of 7 that we tried. Favorites-- baileys & kahula martini, bikin martini, citrus martini.

I liked it. Very lemony & tart! You can make a simple syrup with 1 part sugar to 2 parts water. Boil & cool. Add to drink to make it sweeter.

This was WAY too sour for me. I'm very glad I used the sugar on the rim otherwise I wouldn't have been able to drink it.
