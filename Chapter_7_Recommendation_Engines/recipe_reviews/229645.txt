This is an easy-to-follow recipe, and the results are interesting.  Frankly, though, the result didn't meet with our palate.  We were wondering what it would taste like without the mint, and then later, I thought maybe sweet basil might work better.  Still a bit sweet, but not minty.

The lime juice, fresh mint, and the serrano are the perfect partners for this crisp cucumber salad.  A real burst of freshness with just the right amount of "heat" for us.

7 20 17 ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/229645/cucumber-chili-salad/ ... While I haven't had a mojito (yet; it's on m'list!  ;D), I think I'd like 'em!  I liked this salad, too.  Subbed jalapeno & it was wimpy so added some tabasco.  I think this is a recipe I'll be returning, too.  With the first bite, I wasn't "YUHM, but I was 'Hmmm, good, different, like it.'" - if that makes any sense.  Very pretty, too.  A little red pepper instead of tabasco would pretty it up more.  For lime juice, 2T; salt, 1/4t & 1/16t of pepper.  If you're not up for spicy, up the salt.  :)  I'll reduce the oil next time to increase the lime & mint flavors; a bit too subtle.

Delightful! Went very well with a spicy meal. Even though this has hot chile (I used a jalapeno instead of serrano, it's what I had) it is still a cool and refreshing salad with the cucumber and mint. I think I'll use a bit less sugar next time, but still enjoyed this quite a bit.
