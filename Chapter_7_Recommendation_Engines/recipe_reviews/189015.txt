Well, as the 1st reviewer I thought I should follow the recipe exactly, so I did.  Except for using White WW Flour instead of all-purpose (we are a non white flour house!). :)  These were excellent - good flavor from the cardamom, just sweet enough and very tender.  However, I do have a problem with the making of the bread.  I am going to try this again using more traditional techniques (proofing the yeast, kneading before the 1st rise).  Reason - it didn't rise AT ALL during the 1st rise....  I mean at all.  Now, this could be partly because my water mixture was barely at 100 degrees (it cooled really fast!), I like to have mine at 110.  So!  I will try this again and see how it goes.  Def worth trying!!

NOTE:  This website made changes to the recipe!  This dough is best when it rises overnight in the fridge.  Due to its high sugar content it rises VERY slowly.   Mix 3 cups of flour with the yeast, then add the liquid (up to 120 deg. F) and the eggs. Mix to create a runny dough.  Then, slowly add the rest of the flour and knead 8-10 min. to form a soft, sticky dough (I do all this in my KitchenAid.)  Then, put in fridge overnight - cover top loosely with non-stick foil.  Then, continue with the rest of the recipe.  The formed rolls will take longer than an hour to rise because they were formed from cold dough, so be patient.   Whew!

Like the last reviewer, my rolls did not rise during the first rising either.  Next time I make these, I will try them in my breadmaker.  But they tasted delicious (cardamom is one of my absolute favorite spices) and I will definitely make them again in the future.

So this was my first attempt at making home made rolls and I ended up not using as much water as the recipe called for by accident.  The rolls still turned out fantastic, light and fluffy and delicious!

I did not like this recipe. The dough did not raise and the buns browned on the bottom but not the top and some were doughy in the middle. Not like bread because they did not rise. more like a bagel. To be fair I even started over with a new batch in case I had done something wrong. Second batch, same as the first.

I really like the taste of these rolls.  I love the taste of the cardamon, and they are sweet enough to eat plain but you could put jam and butter on it and go to town.  And, in fact, that is what my coworkers did.  I have to say, though, that I'm not pleased with how they rise separately on a cookie sheet.  These are more workable as pull apart rolls in my opinion. They rise outward and so when I tried on the cookie sheet, I ended up with flat little disks, so I reshaped and placed in a pan, then let them rise again.  Although this made for some funny looking rolls (I don't do consistently sized rolls well), this worked much better.  Takes a lot longer to bake, though, but I liked how they rose better.  I couldn't fit all the rolls in the pan, so I played around and made five braided rolls, placed them together in a bread pan, then let rise and baked along with the pan.  It turned out really well, actually, and made for a small but tasty and pretty loaf.  I might do that next time again.  Thanks for the recipe!
