I've found this is a great idea for picky men... men love anything wrapped in cheese and bacon! I did these in large muffin tins (it made six little muffins) because it cooks faster, serves more neatly, and is easier to wrap the bacon! I also added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to keep it moist, and because it is such a good flavor with the beef. Next time i would use a few less bread crumbs, because the flavor of the bread crumbs was a bit overpowering. AWESOME recipe.

I followed the recipe as close as I could with the ingredients I had on hand. I was low on bread crumbs so I used half crushed Ritz crackers. I doubled all the spices and also added 4 cloves fresh minced garlic. To make the meatloaf wrapping a little easier, I just stuffed the inside with cheese (pre-sliced cheddar--about six slices) and then formed the rest of the loaf around it. I've baked meatloaf with cheese on top and when I go to drain the grease off, I'd lose the top cheese in with the grease which is a total bummer. It helped that I kind of piled half of the meat mixture in a really big loaf pan, layered the cheese, then piled the rest of the meat mixture on top. I just turned the pan over to dislodge the loaf, then wrapped it with bacon. This really did need the extra spices for us, but that was a personal choice. Next time, I'd like to try this with hickory BBQ sauce. My boys really liked this, especially my oldest. He's like his mom, really loves the bacon. My husband was thrilled because I used real thick sliced bacon and not turkey bacon. ;) NOTE: It might help if you form the meatloaf a couple hours before you have to bake it so it has time to hang so it really stays a "loaf" shape and not a meat blob on your plate. I learned that after years of meat blobs.

I loved the idea of the recipe.  The first time, I wasn't thrilled with the outcome.  The second time, I chopped the raw bacon and mixed it into the raw ground beef, and cut the cheese into large cubes (maybe 1/2 inch) and mixed those in.  I cooked as directed, sprinkled some cheese on top at the end, and it was great.  The bacon flavor permeated the meat, rather that just sitting on top, and there were little bursts of cheese throughout the loaf.

It's best to just make meatloaf the way YOU like it..and then add the concept of bacon and cheese.  I think I would have liked it more if I had made how I normally do and then added the cheese and bacon.

Not the healthiest meal, but it is well worth it to have this as an occasional treat.  SOOOOOO yummy!  I made it for my bacon-loving stepson for his birthday (along with bacon-cheddar mashed potatoes for a bacon-themed meal, he was in heaven!) and it was a big hit with all.  I made it exactly as listed, as it was perfect as is.

Wow! What a hit! The men loved this because it was wrapped in cheese and bacon, and the kids loved it because it's not your "traditional" meatloaf. It didn't last but maybe 10 minutes! The only thing I did differently was I used Italian style bread crumbs, and they seemed to work really well with the spices that were used. I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Both gave it a little extra punch. The meatloaf is greasy, so I wouldn't suggest making it in a loaf pan, a jelly roll works much better. I served it with home made mac and cheese, for a deliciously cheesy meal!

I thought this would be a lot better than it was. It lacked flavor and was a bit greasy. I don't think I will be making this one again.

The only change I made, was that I saut√©ed the onions in olive oil w/ garlic salt before I put them in, I don't know how big of a difference it made, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to onions.  Wish I could figure out how to make the bacon crispier, I want to try cooking the bacon before putting it on top next time.

We made little finger meatball sizes for an appetizer dish.  Was a big hit.  Used half lean ground beef and half pork sausage. Great the next day too. We will be doing this dish again for sure.

This meatloaf was so good.  I followed the directions exactly.  The bacon gave the meatloaf so much added flavor and helped keep it moist.  Mine was a little lopsided, but tasted great.

My husband adored this recipe as he thinks everything is better with bacon. The meat loaf was flavorful and tender. My only complaint was that it was a HUGE amount of meatloaf. However, I solved that problem with meatloaf sandwiches!

Wow, this was amazing! I never knew meatloaf could taste this good! I used to hate meatloaf as a child so I haven't had it for, like, 20 years, but my boyfriend really felt like some so I made this one for him and I loved it. I will definitely make it again! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I give this recipe high marks for it's great flavor and relative ease to make. I do have a few substitutions I made however. I use fresh basil, oregano, and finely minced fresh garlic. One other substitution is Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup it seems to add a certain zest that I prefer. I use the fresh vs powder because I grow these herbs. I also add two extra strips of bacon across the top and weave them into the slices coming up and around the meatloaf. (I like bacon) :) PS: In order to not have it be greasy use one of the new meatloaf pans with a rack so you can lift it out easily plus it can be raised slightly to allow the bacon grease to drip to the bottom of the pan away from the meatloaf.

So  good, I'll never make meatloaf any other way again!!
*TIP*: form loaf a few hours before cooking and refridgerate, this keeps the loaf firm while cooking.

With slight changes, this was excellent!!!  I used 1/4c bread crumbs (with a little italian seasoning) BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, made a 1 lb loaf with green onions, green bell pepper, dry mustard and used 3 pieces of real bacon, cut in half and just put on top. then about a tablespoon of bbq sauce on top of the bacon, into oven for an hour.  I also mixed all the dry ingredients in a bowl, added the egg, while keeping the hamburger in the fridge.  At the last minute, I added the hamburger, quickly blended and put a half a cup of shredded cheese into the middle. This kept its shape nicely because I kept it in the fridge.  I would not add the cheese on top again because it seemed to just melt off.  I did add about 1/8 tsp more on seasonings except the garlic powder, just added 2 cloves of zested garlic.  I may add just a little more bbq sauce to the actual meatloaf mix next time, but a keeper!!!  Great base recipe!

I have been making meatloaf like this for years.  However I cook the bacon first and crumble it right into the meatloaf. I also just add shredded cheddar rather than cubed. My family and friends always rave about how good it is.

I had to make some changes only because i didn' have some of the ingredients on hand. no dry crumbs and no cheddar, used crushed saltines and just omitted the cheese. was still very tastey. next time i'll make it with all the correct stuff because it could only be that much better with cheddar

I hate meatloaf and this was great! I didn't put as much breadcrumbs in it as stated and I'm glad I didn't. Otherwise, you didn't need to rearrange this recipe at all!! I really don't like it when people rate a recipe a 5 make all kinds of revisions!! Great recipe!!!

Delicious....I used 7 strips of bacon...they were kinda skinny.My 10 year old son LOVED this meatloaf, especially the bacon part. He said to make sure we give this recipe 5 stars!

Leave out the salt and substitute barbecue sauce for  the ketchup. Instead of just 1 tbsp of ketchup over the loaf try 3 tbsp of bbq sauce.

So devilishly delicious!  Used White Cheddar because that's what I had and added a few good splashes of Worcestershire because I love it on meatloaf....followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to layer the bacon on top instead of wrapping it around.  I like my bacon crispy.  Super Comfort Food.  Thanks Ashley!

I have made a similar version of this recipe and it is FABULOUS.  Wanted to mention that patting out the meatloaf into a rectangle and then spreading the cheese, which I grate, over it, and then rolling like a jelly roll ensures getting cheese in every bite!

Awesome - so easy, so good.  Only had 6 slices of pre-cooked bacon in the house, so instead of wrapping it in bacon all the pieces were in the middle layer along with Colby Jack and Provolone cheeses.  Topped off with two slices of Colby Jack.   As I write this, I'm hungry for it, so I think it will be my breakfast!  :)

LOVE IT... I have twin boys and husband who loves meat.  This was the perfect dish for them.  There was a little bit left and served for nice leftovers.  I got hamburger rolls and the men ate meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day.  

I chopped up the raw bacon and added it in with Ground beef.  I also added about a cup of shredded cheese before shaping into a loaf.

Very easy and quick meal! My family loved it. I added about 5 more pieces of bacon that I layered in between the 2 layers of beef. It was a super bacon extravaganza!!! I don't eat meat and I don't cook it very often, but if I did eat meat, I would start here! Everyone wanted seconds.

A little dry, but still good. The bacon and cheese really made it. I think less bread crumbs and more onion and garlic.

My husband and I made this for dinner and the only thing we did different was use big slice of pepperjack cheese on the first row. We put ketchup on the meatloaf before the bacon is folded together.  After cooking for an hour we made a topping sauce of ketchup and bbq sauce and brown sugar and it was amazing. Great flavors. Must try.

I made a few tweaks to the actual meatloaf according to what we usually like in it, substituting worcestershire for the ketchup in the mix (I still used ketchup mixed with a little barbecue sauce & horseradish on the top) and thyme instead of basil. Overall I was kind of disappointed in the bacon. It only got crispy on the top - it was greasy & soggy on the sides & bottom of the pan, which wasn't super appetizing and didn't add enough flavor to make up for it. Next time I think I'd just lay some strips of bacon across the top so it all has a chance to get crispy.

I love bacon, I love cheese, I love meatloaf. So I love this. I used bacon flavored ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, added green peppers, put the cheese on the inside and brushed the bacon weave with brown sugar and Bbq sauce. 

Great recipe

I used this as a basic guide and added my own extra seasonings. I replaced the ketchup with A1. Used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I also used shredded cheese. I suggest thick cut bacon, the thicker the better. It was a huge hit at home with 3 picky eaters! I am going to try adding some green and red peppers, minced garlic instead of powder and maybe mozzarella next time. I really liked this one.

I've cooked a few different Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf's, and by-far this is my favorite! I cooked the meatloaf my regular way (w/ listening to the ingredients listed) and it was Awesome! Placing the cheese inside and the bacon underneath, made this meatloaf juicy and a cheesy delight! I've always coked the bacon on top and vertical, under the meat and horizontal was an amazing added bonus&it cooked sooo much more evenly&crispy! Love It!! Then the cheese in the middle, added surprise! Thank You for Dad's Cheesy Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf!!!

Very pretty dish, very tasty. 4 to 6 serving. Did not add cheese to the top at end. Used toothpicks to secure the bacon. Before cooking I basted entire loaf with ketchup mixed with a little water. Used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  Used Kithchen aid to mix thoroughly. Serve with baked potatoe or rosemary potatoes and salad

I have three grown men in my household and they all LOVED this.  The only change I made was to coat the bacon wrapped meatloaf in brown sugar to caramelize it. I brushed on the ketchup after it baked for 30 minutes. It came out amazing! I think next time I might make it in individual sizes, so each bite has a bit of bacon and cheese in it! 

The guys said this was the best meatloaf EVER! Better than Grandma's, and that is saying a LOT. I was also requested to make this every other  day, hahahaha.

Made this exactly as written the first time. The boys love it.  They ask for this all the time.  I've made it so often that now I just toss in whatever I have around.  As long as it is full of cheese and wrapped in bacon - they are happy.  Last time, I added some Worcestershire and a can of mushroom and that was good too!  Whenever I tell the bf to pick up ingredients for dinner - this is the meal he chooses.   I do bake it on a wire rack so the bacon on the bottom will cook a little better and the meatloaf isn't just sitting in the grease.

I make this all the time! Its always a hit and there are never leftovers! One time i did a bacon weave over the top instead of wrapping it and it came out pretty cool. I usually use seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. But always follow all the other ingredients. Always amazing!

This was delicious!  I did a couple of things different, but otherwise used the recipe as printed.  I used fresh garlic (2 cloves minced), 1/2 cup of milk, and 1/4 cup of sour cream (I had just a little left and used it as a substitute for 1/4 cup of milk.) Probably not the healthiest meatloaf, but definitely the most delicious.

This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever had in my 27 years on this earth!  Even my 4 year old PICKY daughter cleaned her plate!  I did not change the recipe at all.  The only thing I added on top of it was a sweet glaze that consists of 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce. PERFECTION...taste even better the next day.

Excellent Recipe. The only changes I made were to chunk the cheese up into cubes and mix it into the meat mixture and, because I needed it right away, I made 10 mini flat loaves.  It was cooked thoroughly in about 30 minutes. Family loved it. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I used fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.  It is a gorgeous and impressive looking loaf with the bacon wrapped around it.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes... We called it "The Bacon Cheese Burger Meatloaf"!

I put a sauce on top of worcestershire, ketchup, HP, soy sauce onion ... topped the sauce with cheese and baked on it for the last 10 minutes.  To save on calories, I did not use the bacon and it was very good.

Made this for the family tonight!
Used cubed American cheese inside with two broken up Kraft singles slices (Also used 3 slices of Kraft singles for the cheese on top) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and used my meatloaf pan with the drain thing. 
Turned out AWESOME!!! 
Even the three boys (15 yrs,10 yrs, & 5 yrs) loved it!
Will definitely make this recipe again!
Thank you!

My family enjoyed this meatloaf. The second time I made it, I saut√©ed the onion before adding it to the mixture. I also replaced the ketchup with barbecue sauce. It‚Äôs a keeper .

Great meat loaf. One of the best I have had and it's a real man meat pleaser. I live in Australia and our cheddar has a slightly different texture and tends to bleed out in the middle so after experimenting a bit I found those kids single wrap cheese sticks tend to be the best for staying put and still holding in the middle of the meat. They work a treat. Can put the regular cheddar on top as usual. Thanks will make again

My FAVORITE meatloaf recipe! Always a hit with my friends and family (even people who don't like meatloaf). Sometimes I add a little Worcestershire sauce, but that's it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I make this probably once a month. It is one of the best recipes I've tried from this site. We absolutely love it! The only change I make is using colby jack in place of the cheddar.

I love this meatloaf! It's easily the most flavorful meatloaf I've ever made and I even got a friend to try it who claimed she hated meatloaf and she grudgingly admitted this one was pretty good. I've also made it without wrapping it in bacon because I didn't have any available, and once without the cheese in the middle. Every time it was still delicious but the original version is of course the best! Great for cold winter nights when you need a warm meal to help you cheer up. :)

My (now husband) asks me to make this on a regular basis!  I tried it when we were first dating & it is on our short list of favorites!  I skip the ketchup  & only use bbq - Sweet Baby Rays is our favorite.  I typically add more bbq in the mix too.  I add extra onions & garlic and drizzle more bbq on top.  Thanks to the previous reviews, I also followed their recommendations to skip the ketchup, add more bacon strips on top (my loaf is usually too big to 'wrap' bacon around the loaf so just have 4 on bottom & 4 on top).  This needs garlic mashed potatoes served on the side!

I really like this recipe.  My kids would probably prefer my family meatloaf mix instead of this mix but prepared the same with the cheese and bacon.  This was simple to make and produced 10 servings with the 2 lbs of ground beef that the recipe called for.

First try, I made it as written, too bland.  I made it again, adding  1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and increasing the salt and pepper a bit.  Serve with hot sauce and it's perfectly delicious!

Used all exact amount of the ingredients as in the recipe. However my son gave me a stuffed meatloaf maker I had been wanting to use so I did. Also followed another users advice and cut up bacon and added it to the mix. My boys loved it !!

This is the easiest and most tasty meatloaf I have ever made. It wasn't heavy like I thought it would be with all the bacon and cheese. Thank you for sharing. I substituted plain bread crumbs for Italian bread crumbs.

I followed the recipe pretty close but made a few changes.  I cut up blocks of cheddar cheese and added them in random spots inside the actual meat loaf.  Skipped the ketchup on top.  I also didn't have basil so I did without.  The results were amazing!  Although, not the healthiest choice on the planet it's def worth making on a night you can splurge.  Be prepared for a food coma after.  No sides necessary either....I just prepared a salad.

This recipe was disgustingly decadent!  Loved it.  Used Italian bread crumbs and increased salt and oregano to one teaspoon.  Sliced the cheese into little slices instead of using big chunks.

I was a bit disappointed in the taste.  I like a little bit more spice and won't put cheese in the middle if I make it again.  When I sliced it the cheese just melted out onto the plate, lol.

Best meatloaf ever! Made as listed but omitted the cheese so recipe was dairy-free. Used a meatloaf pan sold at Bed Bath & Beyond that has an insert that lets the grease drip below the cooking meatloaf.

I made this meatloaf for Father's Day dinner yesterday. Wow!  It is the best meatloaf I've ever tasted.  Followed the recipe exactly. This is now my one & only meatloaf recipe! Bless Ashley for sharing her father's recipe. Mary Ellen

I was looking for something other than my usual meatloaf and thank goodness I came across this recipe! It was ABSOLUTELY  delicious! I only needed half the recipe  because it was just 3 of us ... The only thing I changed was I used 5 slices of bacon to cover while loaf  instead of 3 and I used slices of American cheese instead of cheddar bc that is what I had on hand !! It stayed together perfectly and and was still moist!  I will definetly make this recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing :)

I just made a meatloaf, its in the oven.  Wish I would have seen this recipe with the cheese.....looks amazing!  I make a bacon wrapped meatloaf but have never thought of cheese....will try next time!  I think a good trick I learned for meatloaf is regrind the meat, it is so much better I think.  I like to use lamb and sausage in addition to beef.  So good!

This was delicious!  I love meatloaf, and my husband hates meatloaf. My kids don't care one way or the other.  I finally found a meatloaf recipe that everyone loves.  My husband actually had seconds.  I followed the recipe, omitting the kosher salt, and adding more ketchup.  The only thing I did not like about the recip was the amount of grease in the bottom of the pan when it was done cooking.  I had to take meatloaf out of pan and put on serving tray to serve.  This way I avoided all of the grease.   Not very healthy, but a great dinner once in awhile.

The "italian" seasoning seemed a little odd to go with bacon and cheddar.  We liked it but I don't think this will be a regular unless some ingredients change.  (Which of course, wouldn't be this recipe)
Was worth a try, wasn't bad, just not exactly what I was looking for.
