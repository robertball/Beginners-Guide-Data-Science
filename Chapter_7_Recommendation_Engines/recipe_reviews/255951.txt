Delish, who knew! I think the baking time can come down a little. I didn't have provolone, I used mozz, swiss and parm. YUM.

Oh my yum!!! This was amazing! I didn't change anything- I literally couldn't wait to eat this! I cook for one, but I'm glad I made two servings! Definitely will make this again!

I think this is my new favourite 'go to' recipe for fish. Made this a few nights ago and absolutely loved how it turned out. I did have to make a change - the only cheese I had on hand was parmesan and cheddar, but the cheddar substituted very well for the provolone and mozzarella - and the cod I had didn't have any skin. 
One other slight alteration: I sprinkled a tiny bit of smoked paprika on the fish before adding the rest of the ingredients. Oh, The end result was one tasty meal, VERY easy to make. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I didn't have the provolone cheese so I made it without.  It was delicious and can't wait to make it again.

Quick and easy.  Even altering the ingredients a bit to what you have handy, its still a winner.

I had defrosted Salmon and Tilapia fillets to use, so I searched for and found this great recipe.  It was so quick and easy to make!  I added minced garlic to the pan with the onions and used Old Bay Garlic and Pepper Seasoning instead of seasoning salt.  I also only had one type of shredded cheese available.  It was very tasty!

I made this for friends and it was delicious and we all loved it.  The onions in the bottom of the pan made it so flavorful. I used the cheeses that I had on hand - cheddar and gruyere and the fish that I had in the freezer- tilapia and mahi-mahi.

Cod isn't a light fish to me, therefore it was hard to consume.  The topping made the dish very pleasant.

So good! I cooked it in an air fryer: preheat 400 degrees.  In Pyrex dish 10 min covered w foil, 10 min uncovered. Cooked to perfection, Juicy! This is a keeper

This was a hit with my kinda picky husband and stepdaughter! Followed the recipe with exception of the provolone as I didn't have any on hand. I subbed more mozzarella for the  provolone. I used red fish and sea trout as that is what we had in the freezer from a prior fishing trip. Excellent! Smells divine while cooking - wait til the top of the cheese starts to brown before you take it out of the oven. Will make again!!

This actually tasted better than expected. I made it true to the recipe with only one substitution; couscous in place of orzo. No orzo in the pantry!  I don't think the cheese was necessary and could be left off next time.
