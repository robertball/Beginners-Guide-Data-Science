I made this for a Hawaiian-themed bbq.  I read through many of the other reviews & found them very helpful.  I gathered together the most pertinent info & the dish turned out wonderful!  Here are the changes I made to make the dish 5*'s.

I used rice vinegar instead of sherry.  Rice vinegar makes chicken tender.

I used fresh ginger & garlic.  Triple when using fresh herbs.

I added fresh mushrooms.  You could add other veggies too. As another reviewer pointed out, it is safer to separate the chicken & veggies. 

After marinating several hours, I skewered the chicken and vegetables separately as they are done at different times.  I soaked the skewers in water to keep them from burning.  

After I skewered the chicken and vegetables I used the left over marinade from the vegetables, like other reviewers suggested, heated it on the stove until boiling & added 2T of cornstarch dissolved in a 1/4 -1/3 of water to make a basting sauce which I applied during the last few minutes of grilling.  

The dish was a hit!  Everyone loved it! The basting sauce was worth the extra few minutes.  It really topped it off.

Yes, I would make it again!  It was worth the time, which really wasn't much.  What was time consuming for me was deciding what to make, reading the reviews & putting it all together.  

I wrote this review hoping to condense all the reviews I read for other viewers so they don't have to go through all the time & trouble I did.

I used fresh pinapple for these and made the mistake of putting the chicken and pinapple on the skewers the night before and marinating.  When we ate them the chicken was pasty on the inside.  I think it was because the enzyme in the fresh pineapple ate away at the chicken all night.  I would recommend marinating the chicken and the pineapple in separate containers and then putting on skewers at the last minute if you are using fresh pinapple.  Otherwise it was delicious.

I used 1 tsp. sesame oil (instead of 1 Tbl.) to cut down on the fat, and there was no difference!  Marinating overnight is the key.  I baked them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.  Awesome!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome marinade!  I made skewers with chicken, bell peppers, and pinapple chunks.  In addition to marinating the skewers, I took some marinade and simmered until it was reduced by half into a glaze.  I then brushed this over the kabobs....Fabulous!

Followed another cooks suggestion and marinaded the chicken and pineapple separately adding 2 Tbspns more brown sugar to the pineapple marinade portion. With the leftover pineapple marinade I boiled it with a little cornstarch to thicken and basted the completed kabobs. (I thru the chicken marinade out)I also broiled the kabobs and they turned out really good.  Tons of flavour. Served with rice and salad.

My family and I love this.  I have modified it by baking the chicken and pineapple chunks in the marinade, and serving with coconut rice.  It is so good.

Everyone loved this recipe.  It was extremely easy.  It also is very low fat.  Next time I would eliminate the powder and use fresh chopped garlic and ginger.  I did not marinate the pineapples with the raw chicken (that didn't seem safe to me).   I put the onions, chicken and pineapple on separate skewers.  Chicken goes on the bbq first, then add the onion skewers, a few minutes later, and for the last 2-3 minutes add the pineapple to the bbq.  I served this dish with white rice and it was a perfect meal.

I made this for guests and it was fabulous.  My husband who doesn't care for chicken went nuts for it.  I made extra sauce due to preference.  I marinated the chicken pieces alone for 3 hours, and marinated the vegetables (green pepper, red pepper, and mushrooms) for 1 hour then broiled in the oven.  I chose not to marinate the pineapple.  The mixture of ingredients was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing next time.  I served with rice pilaf, salad, and Hawaiian bread.  I had some chicken left over which I ate cold on a salad the next day which was also fabulous.

My husband and I made this on our charcoal grill for the 4 of July and we LOVED IT!!  I can't believe we cooked this ourselves. (scaled to 2 servings)

We marinated the mushrooms with extra marinade and we marinated the chicken for 4 hours (turning once) and the chicken was perfect, the mushrooms were the most flavorful I have ever tasted! We also added some marachino cherries to our kabobs. We did not marinate the pineapple because we thought it would be mushy, but I think we should have for a little while, it just tasted too tart because it was fresh and didn't quite get cooked enough.

We served it over some brown rice. I wish we had made even more marinade to pour on the rice-I highly recommend making 3 times the amount of marinade for basting and marinating the shrooms.  

The smell was wonderful - I can still smell it! I want more!!!  MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

The marinade smelled scary while I prepared it, BUT it tasted great!!!  I baked mine in an oven instead of grilling them and they came out wonderful.  I added some mandarin oranges and green pepper for color too.  GREAT RECIPE.

I read some of the other reviews and incorporated various ideas, and whatever I did came out amazing! My boyfriend kept saying "wow" as he was eating it. Now that I've tried it out on us, it would be a great recipe for a dinner party. 

Here's what I did:
 Made double the marinade, using fresh ginger and garlic (and I only did 2 chicken breasts; so if I were doing the full 4, I would quadruple the marinade)
. Marinated the chicken first, in one bag, for 2 hours
. Marinated fresh pineapple with red peppers, green peppers & purple onions in a separate bag, for 1-2 hours
. Threaded chicken and pineapple/veggies on separate kabobs
. Put the chicken on the grill, turning every 5 minutes, for a total of about 20 minutes. Put the pineapple/veggies on the grill for the last 10 minutes, turning once halfway through. Meanwhile, heated the marinade from the pineapple/veggies over the stove with a little cornstarch to thicken it. Served over coconut rice (2 cups jasmine ride, 1 cup coconut milk, 2 cups water, 1/2 tsp salt & 2 Tbsp shredded coconut in rice cooker on regular setting), with the thickened marinade drizzled over the top. 

AMAZING!!

Oh my! These are absolutetly delicious!  I've made these twice now with excellent results and it's now become one of my husband's favorites.  To "health" this up just a little I used low sodium soy sauce, fresh garlic, brown sugar Splenda and replaced the sherry with rice wine vinegar. I mixed it altogether along with the sesame oil and ginger.  I put three quarters of the marinade along with the chicken into a ziploc freezer bag and let it marinate all day.  The remaining marinade I put into another ziploc bag along with fresh pineapple, viadlia onion, and red and yellow peppers.  I skewered the meat separate from fruit and veggies as they cook at different rates.  I love when so few simple ingredients combine to create something really special.  This was wonderful served with rice!

As others suggested, I added pineapple juice to marinade. Also added onions, yellow & orange peppers. I doubled the marinade ingredients figuring the veggies would absorb alot of it. After marinating for 3 hours I put everything on kabob sticks & used the remaining marinade as a baster through out grilling, this was delicious! Served with asian rice & corn.***SOAK KABOB STICKS IN WATER 30 MINUTES BEFORE ADDING FOOD,WILL KEEP THEM FROM TURNING BLACK***

Wow! We loved these! I marinated my chicken with full serving marinade and then I marinated my fruit/veges separate. I doubled the marinade amount for the fruit/veges and I used fresh pineapple, mushrooms, yellow pepper, and red onion. After I took veges from marinade I made a paste for basting by adding 1 Tsp cornstarch and bringing to boil. I served with coconut rice (1 and 1/2 cups white rice, 1 and 1/2 cups water, 1 can coconut milk and 1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar depending on taste, bring to boil then cover and simmer til liquid gone about 15 to 20 minutes) My husband said it was better than the $80 meal we got at the hawaiian restaurant.

I marinated the chicken and shrimp for 8 hours with this recipe.  It turned the chicken and shrimp so mushy that we had to through it out and order delivery.  Ruined the barcecue and we had to throw away 200 dollars in food.  If you try this recipe make sure to only marinate it for 2 hours at most.  I have marinated chicken over night over 100 times and never had a problem.  I don't know if it is because the pieces are cubed or the marinate isn't good but using fresh pineapple and ingredients, following this to a tee, I wasted a ton of time and it was a disaster.  I wish I knew what went wrong.  I am thinking that protein and pineapple do NOT belong marinated together for a long time.  Recipe says "at least 2 hours" I wouldn't go 1 minute over and cross your fingers...

Very Good!!!  I made the full amount of marinade for only two chicken breasts.  I used part of it to marinade the chicken, part of it to baste with while grilling, and another part to drizzle on when plating.  I skewered the chicken separately from the pineapple, and to the pineapple skewers I added red bell peppers and onions.  Rather than cubing the chicken, I pounded it and cut it lengthwise into 1-inch strips and wove them on the skewers.  I used fresh pineapple and fresh garlic.

This was very good.I marinated it overnight instead of 2 hours,but it was still not a strong enough flavor.The pineapples held most of the flavor.I think next time I will double the marinade and reserve 1/2 to baste the chicken with while grilling.Then I think it will be perfect!Also the recipe says this is for 8 boneless chicken breast but it was only enough for 4 chicken breasts.Which was just enough for my family of 4.I served this with "Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinaigrette" and "House Fried Rice",they all went well together!It was a very impressive meal!

Had to double the marinade, not enough. I used only 1/2 the chicken, but added chunked pineapple and whole waterchestnuts to the kebabs. Very good and very easy.

I thought this recipe was great. The only thing we didn't like was the pineapple being marinated with the chicken, but that's just us. Next time we'll just use it straight out of the can onto the grill. Also, I cooked the leftover marinade into a thicker sauce and spooned it over the chicken while it was on the grill like someone else suggested. Very good!

These were good, but I made a couple changes that I would not do next time.  First, I over-marinated.  This marinated for over 8 hours and it was too much, I would stick to 2 or 3 max.  Also I made a glaze with the marinade to baste the kabobs with, but it was too thick and was overpowering.  I would only baste with the regular marinade next time.

Easy, quick, tasty!  Just my type of recipe.  I substituted pineapple juice for the sherry, because it's easier to find.  I only marinated about 1.5 hours and the chicken was so tender we were cutting it with a fork.  Loved the pineapple.

Froze marinade and chicken cubes together a while ago then defrosted/marinated for two days.  Delicious!  Chicken skewers only (no pineapple).  Grilled at 350-400F, 5min/side for perfect, juicy chicken.

Great recipe! The only changes: used raspberry vinegar instead of sherry and only half the oil; marinated only the chicken for about an hour; used frozen pineapple instead of canned; added green, red, and yellow peppers. I only had half the meat, but made a full recipe of marinade, and it was all used. What wasn't soaked up by the chicken I added just a touch of cornstarch and cooked until thickened, then brushed over the kabobs when i turned them during grilling. Everyone thought they were delicious! Mom wants me to add mushrooms next time and Dad suggested putting onion on the skewers next to the chicken to give them a little more zing. May have to try that next time--there definitely WILL be a next time! 2 thumbs up

Would be better with fresh pineapple.  The canned chunks kepts falling apart on the skewers.  I also did not marinate the pineapple with the chicken.

This was great.  I didn't make kabobs and kept the chicken breasts whole.  I doubled the marinade and reserved some for a dipping sauce.

absolutely delicious! i think you lose something if you don't marinate the pineapples and chicken together - maybe add some pineapple juice to the marinating chicken? the marinated and grilled pineapple was especially delicious. i served it with homemade hawaiian bread and white rice, and i made another batch of the marinade (thickened with cornstarch) to make into a sauce for the rice.

yum these turned out great for our hawaiian dinner party.  It was 25  degrees outside, so opted to make them in the oven...broiled them on soaked skewers for 3-4 minutes per side.  basted with some extra sauce that I made on the stove top and thickened with cornstarch.  Everyone loved them.  Added green peppers and onions.  thanxs!

I used some of the reviewers suggestions.  I made a lot of extra marinate.  I did not marinate the pineapple, and cooked it on a separte skewer.  I used separte skewers for the chicken, mushrooms, and red pepper. I marinated the veggies separately and used the veggie marinate to make a sauce by heating it with a little flour.  I served the dish over rice.  The mushrooms were my favorite.

Love the recipe.  The one ingredient you just can't leave out or substitute is the sesame oil.  I also used fresh garlic and fresh ginger and substituted rice wine vinegar for the sherry.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and it was wonderful.  I served it over coconut rice.  This little haole found it pure Hawaiian.

You can't go wrong with this one!  I doubled the sauce and marinaded 3 large chicken breasts (cut up) for about 4 hours in a ziploc bag.  I made double the sauce again and used it for basting.  I didn't have pineapple so I used red onion and red pepper pieces on the skewers with the chicken.  Awesome!

Hmm. I decided to bake this, as it decided to rain at dinner time. I will try this again and grill it, but don't bake this!!! It turns out like paste. I will give it another shot, though, and hopefully have the same success as everyone else.

These were good, I subbed rice vinegar because I didnt have sherry, I like my meat well seasoned so I did season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder after marinating, (first batch I didnt and they were a little bland)we also added marinated bell peppers and white and red onions.

ALWAYS separate raw meats and poultry from fruit and vegetables to eliminate possible cross-contamination. otherwise, amazing marinate. using rice vinegar in place of sherry makes all the difference, and will keep your chicken tender even if it is over cooked! thank you for the recipe!

Per other reviewers, I replaced the sherry with vinegar as I did not want to buy sherry just for this recipe.  That may have been the recipes downfall. This recipe didn't have much in the way of flavor.  If I make again, I will not substitute.

Both my husband and I LOVED these kabobs.  I added red and green peppers, onions and mushrooms. I marinated the chicken about 3 hours and all the rest (except onions and pineapple) about 1-1/2 hours.  I took the other reviews seriously and didn't marinate the pineapple.  We basted the kabobs 3-4 times while grilling with left-over sauce.  They were wonderful and I will definitely make them again.

This is great! I used it to jazz up plain turkey burgers. I basted the patties with the marinade & broiled the burgers. Made a pretty golden color on the patties & the taste was so good, I didn't even need condiments on the bun! A keeper!

I really loved this dish.  My girlfriend could not stop raving about it.  We both wolfed it down!  I must say that the sesame oil distinguishes the marinade from other soy-based marinades.  Next time I may try to add some parsley or chives.  I placed the kabobs on a bed of carribean style rice pilaf for the finishing touch.  Ooh boy - this is good stuff.

I actually used some of the pineapple juice (from the can) in the marinade and a touch more sherry.  I also blended the marinade in a small pot on the stove over a low to medium heat.  let it cool then marinaded the chicken.  Kept a little marinade on the side which I used to baste the skewers while they were on the grill. I also added a cut up red pepper to the skewer.  my son and husband LOVED it.

Sweet Savory Chicken Chunks and Pineapple. Where can you go wrong?! (smile) This was good and easy to make for my summer party. Taking the advice of other reviewers I used rice vinegar instead of sherry and added minced garlic and ginger to the marinade. I used both fresh pineapple and can pineapple and both ways taste great.

Spectacular dish! I'm a little tired of chicken right now, (unless it's fried) so I tried this with chunks of pork tenderloin. Oh my! Melt-in-your mouth. I followed all of the recommendations of kajewski. I also used fresh pineapple instead of canned (heavenly), also skewered red and orange bell peppers, Vidalia onions, and I doubled the marinade mixture so I would have plenty to work with when adding the cornstarch. I marinaded my meat and vegetables in seperate containers. I served this over Asian Coconut Rice, submitted by silvrezs, added Sunkist Honey Roasted Almond Accents (a salad topper) per reviews. I had a little marinade/cornstarch mixture left over, so I drizzled that over everything. Rave reviews from my family and our dinner guest. I will make this again. Go ahead, try this with pork tenderloin. You will not be disappointed. Thanks for sharing dailyn2003!

Definitely a good idea to grill the pineapple and veggies separately from the chicken. I also made a dipping sauce using the leftover marinade.

OMG...what a great recipe!!!  I read the reviews prior and used the suggestion of using rice wine vinegar instead of the sherry. I also marinated my veggies (onions, fresh pineapple, zuchini, red bell pepper) and chicken separate as well as skewered and cooked them separate. I doubled the marinade for the veggies and then after skewering the veggies, added corn starch to the marinade and heated it to make a thick dipping sauce.  My husband LOVED and RAVED about it.  My 4 y/o son loved the chicken.  My 8 y/o (who will not let a veggie pass his lips) loved the veggies and my 2 y/o ate all of it!!!  (Plus, it is fun for the older kids to eat off the bamboo skewers!!!)  The marinade gives a sweet tangy taste to the veggies and chicken.  Even though alot of prep work goes into this dish, I will make it for my parents when I go back to the US and visit my family.

Excellent recipe.  Used fresh ginger and garlic but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I made an extra batch of the sauce, thickened it with some cornstarch & water mixture over the stove for basting and dipping.  I would also try this with steak.

VERY DELICIOUS! Followed the recipe to the dot except I didn't have any ground ginger so I omitted that.. i made the marinade twice in separate containers.. one to marinate in, the other to baste on the kabobs while its grilling. It turned out fantastic. The whole family raved on it, and will make again, again, again, and again!

Tried this and whole family enjoyed.  I used green pepper, onions, grape tomatoes and pineapple.  Next time will leave out tomatoes as they didn't have a good texture once grilled.  Marinated chicken overnight and the veggies without pineapple for about 2 hours.  Kids enjoyed skewering in creative ways.  As recommended in other reviews, heated remaining marinade and added ~1/2 teaspoon cornstarch to thicken; used this for basting.  Used 5 cut up chicken breasts and marinade for 8. . . just right.  Also substituted rice vinegar for sherry and garlic cloves for powder.  Followed recipe otherwise.  Thanks!  Now I need a good rice recipe to go with this.

excellent recipe, liked by all in the family. I marinated for 4 hours but decided next time I make this recipe I will increase amount of marinate, pierce meat deeply and let marinate longer to make it more flavorful.

Used a combo of chicken breast and thighs. Baked in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes then broiled them for about a minute on both sides. Turned out REALLY great.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make and very tasty.  I marinated my chicken only about 1.5 hours.  
I usually find breast meat to be dry but this was very moist.  I will definitely make this again.

This dish has great presentation. I made this for a party at work and although people ate them up I thought that the taste could be better.  I marinated them overnight (24 hrs) and that seemed to be too long.  The chicken pieces had a slightly mealy consistency.  The recipe should say to marinate for no more than 6 hours before cooking.

This was easy to make and a hit with my entire family - even my extremely picky daughter.  Trying to use ingredients I had on hand, I substituted red wine vinegar for the sherry and used regular vegetable oil instead of sesame.  I also cut up a green bell pepper and alternated pieces of it with the pineapple and chicken that I had cut into bite sized pieces before marinating.  During grilling, we brushed the kabobs with soy sauce.  NOTE:  If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them at least 20 minutes before assembling the kabobs.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of Hawaiian chicken, but I didn't really care for this dish.  I followed the recipe, and even used the "good" sherry.  The marinade flavor was just ok.  As long as I took a bite of pineapple with the meat, I liked it better, but without the pineapple, it was just ok.

Not bad! While prepping the marinade, I knew I was in for a real treat because it smelled SO good!!! I just wish these tasted as good as they smelled. The flavor of these was quite mild, even tho I marinated everything for nearly seven hours (FYI, I divided my chicken & pineapple for fear of cross contamination). NOTE: It only took my hubs five short minutes to grill our kabobs. I'm not sure what we'd have ended up with if we cooked these on medium-high for 15-20 minutes (ikes!). All in all, these were easy to make but in need of some tweaking to better suit my tastes. A side of fried rice rounded out our simple meal. Thanks for sharing, dailyn! :)

I had quite a disaster! I wanted to make slightly smaller kabobs (called sosaties locally), as I wanted them as a starter for our BBQ with a group of friends. I also am not fond of canned pineapple, so decided to make the extra effort and bought lovely, fresh ones and cubed these. As the recipe said to marinate for at least 2 hours, I thought I'd make them on Saturday afternoon, ready for the Sunday lunch BBQ. BIG mistake!! I believe the pineapple acts as meat tenderizer. The chicken pieces were so tender, it was more like eating flour! Did not taste like chicken or meat at all! I had made at least 36 inedible skewers. This must be a result of using fresh pineapple iso canned.

Made these last night.  Excellent!  I did make a couple of alterations.  I added the juice of half a lime to the marinade and used chunks of green bell pepper and onions on the skewer with the chicken and pineapple.  While it was cooking outside, even our dog was freaking out because it smelled so good! Later my husband asked me where I wanted to eat out Friday night.   He said that it didn't matter to him because it wouldn't taste as good as what I cooked last night!  Huge compliment! Huge!

Something about the marinade does something fabulous to the pineapple! I did not use the chicken and used other veggies as well as the pineapple because I was wanted a side dish for grilled salmon, but I followed the recipe as-is and it was really great... the pineapple flavor explodes in your mouth, it was the star!

Delicious! Wow! This recipe is worth saving for the marinate at least! The chicken was so tender and soo good. I added mushrooms & zucchini to the kabobs. Yum! Like another reviewer, I didn't have any sherry so I used rice vinegar and it worked so well! You need to make this. Haha.

Excellent! The sesame oil is a great touch. This was a fun meal on our camping trip and required no plates or silverware...Perfect!
 I made a double batch of marinade. One for veggies and one for meat. I used rice vinegar as I had no Sherry on hand. I added red and green bell peppers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes and onions to the pineapples. I skewered chicken separate from veggies . Everything came out so yummy - even the veggies quickly disappeared! Only three days after returning from our camping trip and all five of my kids are requesting this meal again. 
Love it when healthy food is so well received! Thanks for the great recipe. Serving again tonight!

This was just "OK" for us.  The marinade was not as flavorful as we would have liked.  The chicken looked good, but was a little disappointing in taste.

These were a success in my house! The chicken was tender and the grilled pineapple was yummy! I think i may try to marinade the chicken over night next time to give it more time to absorb the flavor as it was fairly light tasting. But over all it was good and I will be making these again!

This recipe was great!  I couldn't BBQ them but I can't wait for next summer because they are going to awesome grilled.  I followed the advice of others and marinated the pineapple separate and used the marinade from it to make a glaze.

Very good recipe! I used fresh ingredients instead and added assorted veggies to gear toward my taste. My guests and I absolutely loved this recipe!

The pineapple was fine, but the chicken had the weirdest consistency. I was sad I tried this recipe on guests! I noticed now that one person wondered if the pineapple and chicken shouldn't be marinated together...

I followed KAJEWSKI's tips. I soaked the skewers before using them, I also used fresh ginger, and garlic, and used rice vinegar cause that's all I had. I cut some bacon into chunks and tossed that in with the chicken and pineapple to marinate. I doubled the recipe so that I could marinate some veggies in it. While everything was on the grill I thickened up the left over marinade to brush over the food, which was a great idea. This dish is so good, very flavorful, and very easy to make.

all the reviews made this sound so good  it is easy and smells great, but i found the chicken to be dry.. the only items I did change was the marinate time ( I did  overnite)  and I did not use the pineapple other then that I followed the recipe.   I will not even try this again. sorry

This would be a 5* for it's flavor alone!  It was wonderful, but I'd give it 4.5*'s because I think  the extra step to boil the marinade & baste the chicken at the final couple minutes is necessary.  I added the reserved pineapple juice to the remaining marinade & brought it to a full boil for 2-3 minutes, then added 1T cornstarch w/2T cold water mixed to make the basting liquid & enough to serve over brown rice (next time I'll use white rice).  I also used chicken tenderloins & threaded them on soaked skewers with the pineapple in-between & cooked veggies on seperate skewers, adding a little basting at the end to tie the flavors together --- it was wonderful!

Absolutely delicious! We are veggie eaters so we added cherry tomatoes, peppers and onions to the skewers. I also left some of the pineapple juice for the marinade and added some chopped garlic. The outcome was terrific! I doubled the recipe for 7 adults and three children and had enough for everyone to have two skewers. I think that I might just triple the recipe next time!

WAIT! STOP! do not drain the pineapple juice, put it into the marinade. I did use fresh garlic and ginger.  My husband said this was great!  Better than El Pollo Loco!  I made this with Legs and thighs.  I marinaded them for only 2 hours and they were great. I did season them with French fry seasoning after I took them out of the marinade.

Delicious! It would have had more flavor if I had marinated it over night. I only did for 2 hours, but it was still awesome. I also used EVOO instead of the sesame oil, because the sesame oil was $11 and there wasn't that much of it in the recipe anyway. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe. This will be used in my home from now on=)

Tip 1:  Marinate overnight.  Some of the reviewers said that the kabobs did not have much flavor, so I marinated mine overnight.  They turned out great.  Tip 2:  Cut your own pineapple because the chunks from the can were too small.  Some ripped as I threaded them onto the skewer.

I've made this twice now and each time came out great!! It's now being requested for each barbeque I attend as my dish to bring. I switched it up the second time though. I didn't have sherry so I added burbon instead. Tasted great then too.

I made this recipe last night and was "wowed" by the flavor!  It was easy and so good.  I followed another reviewers advice and added red onion and green pepper chunks onto the skewers.  My husband loved it and "wants this again"!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very simple to prepare and yielded great results. I reduced the recipe to four servings but still ended up with six shishkabobs. Kids loved them because I didn't put anything but chicken and pineapple on the skewers. Marinated for two hours as the recipe called for and thought the flavor was great. Overnight would be even better I bet. Will make this many more times and serve to guests. Went well with P.J.'s Summer Salad from this site.

I used this as a marinade for whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was so fine. It's been a long time since everyone has been this pleased with a meal. I personally liked the nutty flavor the sesame oil gave the chicken.  We made grilled pineapple slices with a butter, honey, and cinnamon glaze to serve on top and it added a terrific finishing touch to the chicken. This is going to be a summer favorite!

This was fantastic!  A nice change to the daily dinner menu.  The only change I made was to use rice vinegar in place of the sherry.  I also used some of the marinade from the pineapple (boiled with corn starch as others suggested) to baste the kabobs while grilling.  Then I used the rest of the cooked marinade to pour over rice.  Again, this recipe is excellent!  It will take a spot in the dinner rotation!

The flavor was Delish but my chicken was extremely dry. I followed the recipe pretty closely. The changes I made was due to the ingredients I had on had.  1) I marinated my pineapple and veggies separately 2)  I had some red and green bell peppers along with yellow onion with the pineapple and that mixture turned out great.  I think otherwise it might have been too sweet 3) I made a dipping sauce as suggested. I would make this again with my changes listed above.

I should have read the reviews first.  Do not use fresh pineapple, unless you're looking for a QUICK marinade.  Only after tossing everything in the fridge to marinate, did I start reading the reviews and read comments about chicken turning to mush while using fresh pineapple.  Yikes!  Less then 2 hrs I the fridge and my chicken was mush.  I will use canned pineapple in the future.  For sure I will give this recipe another shot.

I used fresh pineapple. Do not marinate fresh pineapple with the chicken! Enzymes in pineapple starts to break the chicken down, makes the chicken pasty. I loved the marinade.

Delicious. Everyone at the barbeque that I went to was pleased. I added green peppers and red onions to the skewers, and doubled the marinade recipe to fit. I will make this again.

Wonderful combination of flavors! As other reviewers suggested, I used freshly ground ginger and minced garlic - nothing compares to fresh - and doubled the marinade ingredients. And, since I don't often go to the trouble of grilling just for myself, I turned this into a stir-fry. After marinading the chicken for several hours I added the pineapple chunks along with orange bell pepper chunks, sweet onion, and mushrooms, letting all the favors blend. Then I did a quick stir fry before adding the remaining marinade and simmering for about 10-15 minutes. Thicken with a little cornstarch and water, serve over coconut jasmine rice (from this site) and... YUMM!!! Already looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers :-)

This is a very flavorful recipe that goes very well with white rice and great for the first grill meal of summer. Everyone in my family loved it. I did find it needed a little salt. I also added onions to the kabobs. Everyone in my family like onions with any kind of kabobs. The sweet taste of grilled onions complemented the grilled pineapple perfectly. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Marinated for 2 hours using fresh pineapple. Enzyme in pineapple made the chicken pasty on the inside, not pleasant. I liked the marinade but perhaps will just use onions & peppers next time instead of pineapple and make pineapple fried rice instead to add that 'Hawaiian' touch.

No grill, I baked at 450. @0 min, turn, 20 min.   Made red pepper and summer squash for veggie daughter.  Did the cornstarch thing with the marinade and basted in the last 10 min.  Everyone voted MAKE AGAIN!  Even picky eaters!
Oh, did not have sherry.  Just used some pineapple juice from the can.

The flavor of this dish was wonderful.  The next time I will use boneless, skinless thigh meat instead.  Thigh meat is less expensive, flavorful and less likely to dry out during the cooking process.

Oh my gosh!  These were so good!!!!  I followed the directions as written.  I did separate the chicken from the pineapple on the skewers when cooking.  I also followed the advice of some of the other reviewers by bringing the excess marinade to a boil, adding a little cornstarch, and basting the meat while cooking.

We are trying to eat healthier and grill more this summer.  I found this recipe when I was looking for something to do with some pineapple chunks that needed to be used.  I made the marinade in the morning and added 4 frozen chicken tenderloins to marinate all day.  I added the pineapple chunks in the last 2 hours.  I also used the pineapple juice instead of sherry.  We really enjoyed this recipe and will be making it again.  Thanks!

This was "easy, simple, fast and good" words from my hubbys mouth. We used fresh pineapple, because we normally have it in the house. I did not put the pinapple in with the chicken to marinade. I did double the marinade to make sure all the chicken got a good coat. All in all great recipe and will be making this again soon!

meh, not bad but not good enough to make again. I grilled with an electric grill I'm sure a charcoal would gave given a better taste. Also should have read the reviews ahead of time and not added the pineapple chunks to the marinade. It made them to soft and mushy for my taste.

This is a great-tasting recipe. I added sliced chunks of yellow onion, which added a nice touch. I served it on top of brown rice and my husband added a dash of soy sauce.

A truly yummy marinade!  The chicken came out tender and left me and my guests very impressed.  I also used rice vinegar instead of sherry and marinated for 4 hours.  I added the pineapple chunks just before grilling.

11 minutes on my grill was definitely too much for 1 inch cubes of chicken.  Like most others, used rice wine vinegar and fresh ginger and garlic.  Marinated the veggies (our favorites) separate and then thickened sauce for dipping with corn starch.  Great flavor but cooking time WAY off.  Will definitely use again for chicken kabobs, with fish/shrimp and use the marinate on chicken breast halves too.  Great, easy recipe you can customize for your family's taste.

Our Grill was not working when we attempted this dish, so we put them in a dish, covered them in foil and put them in the oven.  They turned out great!  I made extra marinade to drizzle over the kabobs on a bed of rice before serving and this really made the meal.  Very easy to do and highly recommended!

Living in Hawaii, this is a REAL favorite for all of our guests, especially the kids!! I soaked the skewers in the marinade first, so they don't stick to it later. Chopped scallions are a nice finish too.

I'm not sure what is different about this recipe compared to other kabobs, but the chicken was so soft and moist! The sauce combo with the pineapple was delicious!  I give 5 starts whenever a recipe makes it into my permanent recipe box and this one is definitely a keeper.

I made kebobs last night and used this marinade recipe. It was very good. I added chunks of mahi mahi with pineapple, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, and yellow bell bepper. I skewered the chicken, fish, vegetables and fruit separately.

Fantastic!  These are great- we cooked them on a charcoal grill and made some extra sauce for dipping.

Yum!  I marinated everything together (including the juice from the pineapple)to give the chicken the pineapple flavor and then threw out the pineapple after cooking (we don't care for grilled pineapple).  Also used Red Wine Vinegar in place of the Sherry.  This is waaaay better and more flavorful than any store bought hawaiian marinade I've tried.

This was very tasty. I, like others, used rice vinegar instead of sherry, only because I didn't have sherry. I also used fresh ginger instead of powdered and fresh pineapple instead of canned.

These were easy to make and tasted good, according to my husband. I used the same marinade for tofu kabobs for me and they were ggod too. Make sure the chicken is cooked through before serving. It's sometimes hard to tell when you use a dark coloured marinade. Thanks!

Yum! Great flavor. I went a little lighter on the brown sugar and added halved mushrooms and zucchini chunks to the skewers. Marinated the chicken for 5-6 hours and threw the veggies in about a half hour before cooking. Thanks!

This defintely requires an overnight of marinating. After marinating for 6 hrs, this still lacked flavor. I did think that the combo of pineapple and chicken was great. I will most likely attempt these again.

Excellent.  Read all reviews first and took advice.  Tripled marinade, added 1/2 cup of canned pineapple juice.  Marinated chicken separately.  marinated pineapple and veggies on their own and used this marinade to make a glaze adding corn starch.  I did add more ginger as that's a preference.  Absolutely delicious - we basted the chicken and veggies with the glaze and used the rest to drizzle over our rice  We are going to try it on a salmon filet next time.

I tried this recipe this evening and loved the combination of flavors. The reduction glaze made this recipe shine! I am already thinking about other elements to add to the kabobs...

I have a question though for anyone who has made this recipe: Has anyone experienced the chicken becoming almost "chalky" or "paste-like" in texture? 

I made the recipe with the only difference being a substitution of red wine vinegar for the sherry (didn't have any on-hand). I am wondering if this may have been the problem. 

I followed the recipe and marinated the chicken and pineapple together in the mixture. I did re-mix the items several times during the marination process to ensure complete coating. Towards the end of grilling, I brushed on the glaze as noted. 

When I finally ate these, I noticed the chicken had almost "broken down" particularly on the outside surfaces. It made for an odd eating experience. Any thoughts or ideas?

This recipe is very good. I made it after it was recommended on the Recipe Exchange. I substituted rice vinegar for the sherry. I added some crushed red pepper, but next time I may add more. I marinated for about 3 hours. I served it with white rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe. I didnt marinade the pineapple w/the chicken, IDK just felt like pineapple soaking in chicken juice for hours wasnt a good idea, but the marinade was great.  I just marinaded chicken and when time to grill put on skewers with pineapple.  I only added a little bit of seseme oil, and compensated the rest with veg oil.  Remember seseme oil is VERY strong, and a little goes a long way.  But other than that very good! thanks!

My entire family including the kids loved this recipe!  I omitted the sherry and added red bell peppers to the kabob for color.  Didn't have the sesame oil, so I used olive oil instead and it didn't seem to make a difference.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes turning once.  I cooked the chicken, peppers and pineapple together and they all cooked perfectly.  We had it with brown rice.  I'll definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

This chicken was delicious. I've made this several times, even for guests, and everyone always loves it! My husband and I went to Maui for our honeymoon and this reminds us of some of the chicken we had in Hawaii. It's quick, easy, tasty and healthy. Can't go wrong w/ that. Try serving this w/ Fried Rice w/ Cilantro also on this site. Makes a perfect meal!

This was a very flavorful marinade. I let the chicken marinate for approx 24 hours. So it was extremely flavorful, jucy and tender. 
We served on the kabobs as well: 
I cut up yellow and orange bell peppers into chunks and marinated them in pineapple chunks and pineapple juice for 24 hours. 
I bought to packs of pearl onions and they marinated in itialian dressing for approx 24 hours also. 
We assembled the kabobs and grilled them.
OOOHH this was so good. We served on Fathers Day to three families and it was a hit!! Thanks for sharing

These were so GOOD!!! I only marinated mine for about 4 hours and they had a lot of flavor. I cut my own pineapple into big chunks. I also marinaded my pineapple by making another marinade (this recipe). Then i used the sauce from the pineapple marinade and mixed it in with brown rice. I also cut thick chunks of zucchini and soaked them in EVOO and salt and put those on a skewer. One thing I will do differently is I will put the chicken and pineapple on separate skewers. My pineapple burned before my chicken was done. This is very good and I can't wait to make it again!!

Good.  I used red wine instead of sherry.  Also, I didn't use ginger, but I did add some fresh garlic.  next time I'll marinate it longer as I only had about an hour.

This was wonderful.  I received many compliments and I will definitely make it again.  My only complaint was that it was difficult to thread the pineapple on the skewer without it falling apart.  Next time, I'm going to marinate chicken breasts and pineapple rings and serve it over rice.  Delicious!

Great flavor- but I agree with the other reviewer who said that the chicken became a bit "pasty". I marinated my chicken overnight, but I am sure that is what gave it it's great flavor. I will have to keep working on that. Thanks for the great marinade recipe!

Thanks for a wonderful idea that helped me clean out my fridge in high style!  I threaded chicken, fresh pineapple, red bell pepper, and onion onto the skewers.  I wanted to try out your marinade, but I didn't have a couple of the ingredients, so I used a store-bought sesame ginger one that I'm sure is very similar.  I will serve these with leftover homemade fried rice.  I never thought of making kabobs like this, so I wanted to thank you for the meal-saving idea! :)

Great recipe, but I think I marrinaded the chicken for too long, (about 6 hours in the fidge) it turned a bit pasty and fell a part easily but will definately make it again.

Yummy!  These actually marinaded for 48+ hours.  I kept the pineapple separate, and used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  Also used deboned chicken thighs, which while a pain to skin, debone, and cut, worked out ok.  The flavor of the marinade eases into the pineapple during grilling.
8/22:  I subbed shrimp for the chicken, and it was not good.  The shrimp came out way too salty (could be my fault for not soaking them prior), so I think I'll stick with chicken.

Prep time and such few ingredients make this recipe so simple.  I added a little more garlic powder and one small clove of crushed garlic.  I also used fresh grated ginger.  I added red pepper cubes to the kabobs for color and flavor.  This recipe is a keeper, look beautiful when they are finished and taste wonderful!

Smelled amazing as it marinated!  I took others suggestions - used fresh garlic and ginger, doubled the marinate, and had it marinate overnight.  The chicken was really moist!  Also, i made the same marinate (in a seperate bowl) for red and green peppers and onions, and at the end added pineapple.  Heated left over veggie marinate and added flour/cornstarch to thicken and used it as a sauce.  15-20 was WAY too long to grill.  we did 7 to 10 minutes MAX!!   Just a killer recipe!  thank you! thank you!

These were AWESOME!  I served them for a cookout with my family and everyone loved them!  The flavor was YUMMY and the meat stayed VERY tender and moist.  I even cooked some a bit too long on the grill and they were still moist, and I only marinated them for about 4-5 hours.  I will definitely use this over and over!

I originally planned to cook this on a high heat BBQ but ended up having to cook it on a slow cooker BBQ. Because of the other things I was prepairing these were not cooked the way they should have been (so they were a little dry) but even still they went over big, everyone loved them. I can't wait to do the recipe as it should be! Don't miss understand me, these can be prepared on a slow cooker, or high heat BBQ. You just need to take you entire menu in consideration.

I made this and it was a huge hit. I did marinate the night before but going forward I will separate the pineapple from the chicken and marinate the chicken alone. The pineapple definitely breaks down the chicken if left in for too long.  I’ll also take another poster’s advice and soak the skewers in water so they don’t burn on the grill.  Great recipe!

I recently made these and they had fabulous flavor! I did add onion and green bell pepper to the skewers and used fresh pineapple, instead of canned. The only thing I will do different next time, and there will be a next time, is not to marinate the pineapple and chicken together. The chicken came out a little mushy. I don't know if it was the fresh pineapple or that I used chicken thigh meat instead of breast, but the texture was a little off putting. Thanks for a really good recipe idea!

Do not mix the chicken and pineapple if marinate overnight. Pineapple breaks down the enzymes of chicken, so your chicken will be mushy. I would suggest keeping the pineapple and chicken separate until you grill

The recipe sounded great and the reviews were pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly. As some reviewers mentioned that the use of fresh pineapple may over tenderize the chicken. The chicken had a mushy texture and was not very good at all. If I try this recipe again I will marinate the pineapples separately or not at all. I had made this recipe once before and had forgotten that it turned out poorly. One bite of that chicken reminded me.

Great marinade, added onions to the kabobs and marinated for about 45 minutes. However the chicken could use longer, will try 2 hours next time. Need to watch the chicken so it does not overcook.

I followed the suggestions made by some of the other reviewers and am glad that I took the time to do so. I made the recipe as listed, but found that the sesame oil did not make a significant addition to the baste; instead, the oil caused the marinade to slip off the chicken and did not allow it to adhere. However, I tripled the marinade to use as a side sauce and added the sesame oil to this, and the subtle flavor of the sesame oil DID add a nice, extra flavor to the entire marinade. I will be making a LOT of this dish (and marinade) for a luau/birthday party I'll be hosting next month and am glad that I tried it out on my sister's family first. Always good to have a dry run with someone who's opinion you can trust!

Delicious! So easy and tasty my boyfriend loved it and so did I. This recipe was so easy I used fresh garlic omitted the ginger since I didn't have any and used the rice vinegar like others suggested and I didn't want to cut up a pineapple so I used a can of pineapples in 100% pineapple juice and added a couple splashes to the marinade, I added onions to the skewers and served over rice... great recipe! Also nice that it's versatile and still taste great.

I absolutely love this recipe. I did not find it necessary to make all of the edits others did. The only edit I made was to reduce the sesame oil to 1 teaspoon because I don't like the taste. I do make two batches of the marinade; one for marinating and the other I heat up on the stove to serve along side the finished dish. I also use this marinade to make teriyaki bowls. Really, really delicious!!

A few years ago I had the most delicious chicken in Hawaii and I have been trying recipes to find that flavor ever since.  This is it!  For those of you who did not try it with the sherry, but substituted vinegar, you are missing a fantastic flavor combination. This is a perfect recipe as is.

This was terrific! Had not made kabobs in years. Meat always seemed dry.  Not this recipe! The chicken was moist, and the veggies were perfectly done.  I made a few minor changes.  I used white wine in place of sherry, since that was what I had on hand.  I also separated the meat from the veggies when marinating and cooking. I also included mushrooms since my husband loves them. The most time consuming part of this meal was threading the kabobs! Hubby, who does not like onions or peppers, actually commented on how much he liked them with this meal. Also, I made double the amount of marinade for four chicken breasts. This seemed like just the right amount of marinade. As other people suggested, I took the marinade from the veggies, put it in a small pot, and boiled it to reduce. This was then used the last 5 minutes of grilling to baste the chicken and veggies. Absolutely delicious!! Will definitely make again. The grilled pineapple was especially wonderful with the marinade.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe with exception of the pineapple and the chicken so that I could have more marinade and I marinated them individually.  I have two very picky eaters in my family and EVERYONE loved this!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

More like 4.5 than 5 - rating system should be more nuanced! But it makes the five when served with coconut rice!

This is so good! Not too sweet.  I didn't use sesame oil because we didn't have any, so I used a healthy balance oil.  I used fresh, minced garlic instead of powder. I marinated the chicken for 7 hours and wouldn't do it for less.  I took the advice of other reviews and turned the marinade into a baste.  Lastly, I forgot to marinate the (fresh) pineapple, so I just brushed it with the baste as we grilled and it had plenty of flavor, especially when combined with the chicken.  I will make this again and again because it's amazing + very easy.

This was pretty good. I did make the mistake of using fresh pineapple and marinating it with the chicken overnight, so the enzymes in the pineapple made the chicken sticky/pasty. It still tasted great though. Next time I will marinate the chicken & pineapple separately. I served over rice with some roasted red potatoes on the side. Delicious.

Great marinade for the chicken! We thought it was very flavorful (marinated 4 hours). A word of caution, though, do not marinate the pineapple. The enzymes break down the chicken. After pulling the chicken out of the marinade, I threaded skewers with chicken, fresh pineapple, red and green bell pepper, and purple onion. However, I made sure not to place pineapple and chicken next to one another.

My husband has had to eliminate red meat from his diet. So it has been a challenge coming up with different ways to make chicken. We both loved this recipe very much. It was so easy and the chicken came out very moist after grilling. We grilled some onions as well and served with the kabobs. Would highly recommend!

These were just awesome.  Served with coconut rice, and veggie kabobs (green and red peppers, zuccini, and mushrooms).  Per other suggestions, Made an extra batch of marinade cooked with about 1tsp corstarch to thicken slightly and basted chicken and a little on veggies while on the grill.

Delish !!
Made this tonight. Used fresh garlic, fresh ginger root and fresh pineapple. Also substituted sherry with rice vinegar all per other reviewers. Used a teaspoon of arrowroot and 3 T of cold water to thicken sauce and use as basting sauce on skewers.  Absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!

I'm definitely adding this recipe to my regular schedule, tasty and low in fat.  I'm giving it four stars because I did change a couple of things, first I used fresh ginger and garlic and doubled the amounts, and I also used rice vinegar instead of the sherry as others have suggested and I think it would be too sweet without it.  I also splashed in some of the pineapple juice and let the chicken and veges marinate overnight.  I marinaded the chicken in one bowl and in another I had some onion and capsicum marinading to be safe.  I didn't put the pineapple in the marinade, for some reason I just hate pineapple when it's not on its own, but that's just me.

I made this tonight for the second time. I added fresh garlic (instead of powdered) and fresh cilantro to my marinade. I find it best to marinade for at least 3-4 hours. I wanted more vegitables so I added fresh zuccini, green and red peppers and mushroom. The kebobs were so colorful and full of sweet flavor from the pineapple and marinade.

I'm giving it 5 stars because I messed it up, and even the messed up version was at least a three and a half.  First of all, I swear I grabbed soy sauce, but when I got home I didn't have any; don't know where it went. (substituted balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce AND sherry)  Secondly, I DID grab pineapple, but one I got home I saw that it was *crushed* pineapple, *doh*!  Obviously, you can't put crushed pineapple on a stick, but I put everything in a skillet and it worked.  I look forward to making this recipe again with soy sauce and pineapple chunks.

The marinade had a good flavor, yet I didn't like the texture it made of the chicken - the smaller pieces were really mushy. Did I over marinate with 3 hour time?

Excellent! The marinade is so yummy and tastes just like the Hawaiian chicken we used to get at my husbands favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Portland, Oregon--NoHo's. I also included Vidalia sweet onion on the kabobs with the pineapple and chicken chunks. I also made two batches; one for the chicken to marinate in and a separate one for the pineapple and Vidalia sweet onion. I served it with a creamy macaroni salad, which is a staple at any good Hawaiian restaurant. This is a keeper! My husband asked me to make this again and again. Yummy!!

I had to double the amount of marinade to have enough for basting. I did add in some toasted sesame seeds and a bit of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce which adds wonderful flavor to the chicken. Along with the pineapple, we added some green pepper and red onion. Marinated and cooked the veggies separate from the chicken. Sear the chicken over direct heat and then move the skewers to indirect heat while you cook the fruit/veggies over direct. By the time the veggies are done so is the chicken. Served over white rice. What a great summer meal...oh and we used fresh pineapple since it is in season right now.

This was delicious!! Similar to the teriakki recipe I make, eve my 2 year old ate all his chicken up!! 
I did not marinate the pineapple with the chicken though just sliced it up fresh & added it to the stick when all the chicken was cooked (not a fan of warm grilled pineapple)

The longer you let it marinate the better! Excellent recipe. I marinate a lot of chicken and leave it in the fridge. I use what I need for the day, the following days it gets better and better.

A real crowd pleaser with my family.  I used chicken drumettes and they came out great.  Thanks will throw this into the rotation.  Its a quick and easy weekday meal and easy to modify.

Fantastic. I added a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger plus a few shakes of cayenne and about a teaspoon of dried chili flakes because we like things spicy, although the basic flavor is still excellent. We used a non-stick griddle on the grill and are so glad we did! Otherwise, the sugars from the marinade and pineapple would have made a mess. Using the griddle, the kebabs carmelized perfectly (without flameups) and the chicken was moist and very flavorful, with only 2 hours of marinating.

Fabulous! For July 4th we made a few different kebab-marinade combos for variety, and this one stole the show! I only had time to marinade 2 hours, but it still turned out moist and flavorful. Like others, I didn't marinade the pineapple with the chicken. I reserved a bit of marinade and dipped the pineapple in before skewering. (Also put red and green bell peppers and red onions on some of the kebabs for color and kick!) Sooo good with rice!

Tripled the recipe and used it to marinade 24 boneless, skinless breasts overnight.  We grilled them for the dinner for the local Ronald McDonald House and served along with Pineapple Rice, Sweet and Sour Green beans and Fruit Salad.  The guests loved them!  I didn't add any pineapple as I had it in the Rice (along with peppers and onions) but I did make extra marinade and thickened it to brush on the breasts right before they were done and to serve along side.  It smelled divine!  Used fresh ginger and garlic.  There were 3 families there from outside the states (Guatemala, Belize, and Ecuador) and they were particularly happy with the meal (the usual lasagna and spaghetti really aren't their cup of tea).  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely one of the most delicious meals I have had recently.  Grilled pineapple is one of my favorites.  We added some red peppers and onions to the kabobs and marinated them with the pineapple (I marinated the veggies seperate from the chicken as some have suggested).  Would highly recommend to anyone.

OMGosh, served these for a family BBQ. Made 'em for the kids, but the ADULTS went wild over them.  The glaze was super good, and the char on the pineapple was delicious!  Family LOVED this sauce!!  Definitely will make again!

I wish there was a way to rate the top reviews... as many suggested, I substituted the sherry for rice vinegar, and the 2 hour marinade was WAY too long. The chicken was too broken down and ended up being pasty and weirdly textured. Otherwise the flavors seemed as if they would have been great. I do NOT recommend using rice vinegar, or if you do, cut the marinade time down to no more than 30 minutes.

I marinated my chicken for 24 hours partly by accident because I didn't know dinner had been planned for the day I started marinating these.  I didn't marinate the pineapple with the chicken but added those to the kabobs when I was ready to grill them.  That being said, this was delicious, very full of flavor.  I would make these again in a heartbeat.

Absolutely amazing! I took others advice and marinated the veggies and chicken seprately, also used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry, and placed chicken on a seperate skewer than the veggies (yellow and red bell peppers and mushrooms) and pineapple....the chicken had the most amazing flavor from the marinade, it was a huge sucess! Will definitely be cooking this again!

I loved this chicken! I followed the other reviewers advice and separated the pineapple and the chicken. The only things I did differently were adding a little pineapple juice to the marinade and I used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry. I marinated the chicken all day while I was at work and it was packed with flavor. Then I made veggie kabobs with pineapple, onion and green pepper and put some of the basting sauce on while grilling. They were fantastic with the chicken and brown rice. A great recipe for summer!

Excellent taste and easy to prepare! My family loved it. It was really good served with rice. We have been looking for healthy recipes and this was great. You can lessen the sesame oil and even brown sugar if you want to decrease fat/cal more.

I just used the marinate for some chicken breast since I didn't have the pineapple on hand. These turned out very moist and flavorful. Even my picky 4 yr old who complained about grilled chicken told me this was the best chicken I have ever made! So with that being said I will be making this very often and next time with the pineapple.

I was so bummed when I went into my pantry and did not have the Sherry. All I had was Red wine vinegar so that's what I used... PERFECTION!! I will definitely make again. Also, it was a late night dinner so I didn't have time to let it marinate for 2 hours. I did it for 30 minutes and it was delish!!

Have made these twice and both times came out great. To save a little time I cook the breasts just plain instead of making kebobs, and grill the pineapple separately. I also use port instead of sherry because it's what we have in the house

Very nice! I subbed the sherry with orange juice, used fresh ginger and garlic, rather than powdered, and fresh pinepple rather than canned. I chose not to marinate the pineapple with the chicken as the idea did not appeal to me at all. These grilled up in about 12 mintues. Great quick and delicious way to do chicken on the grill. Thanks for the recipe.

Chicken tasted good but really, pineapple marinated in soy sauce was kick off for me. I would try different vegies/fruits for this recipe.

Definitely need to follow the advice of some reviews and separate the fruit/vegies from the meat.  Using fresh ingredients is best, and the rice vinegar is great. Making 2 sets of marinade, I serve this chicken with marinated skewed pineapple, mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper.  Wtih  white rice and brocolli, this makes my favorite family/guest healthy meal.

Awesome!  I prepared the full amount of marinade using 3-4 cloves of garlic, setting half aside to reduce for basting.  The remaining was the perfect amount for three chicken breasts and about 10 oz. of pineapple which marinated for 4 hours.  I skewered the chicken and pineapple with fresh snap peas cut in half (these were so good) and maraschino cherries.  Our family loved this served with coconut rice.  Basting was what really made this recipe stand out for us.  In fact, I should have made more!  And more marinade to have with the rice.  Our entire family enjoyed this dish immensely which is rare with a husband, teenage boy and toddler.  Thank you so much for a recipe I look forward to using and playing with in the future.

The marinade made these delicious.  Because we love veggies in our house, I added mushrooms, onions and green pepper.  As noted by others, it is important to marinate meat and vegetables separately.  It cuts down on the growth of bacteria, and the marinade from the vegetables can be safely used to baste your kabobs as they cook, while the marinade from the meat cannot and should be discarded.

This was excellent!!  My hubby and guests loved it!  Without exception everyone asked for the recipe.  I used the juice from my canned pineapple as well in the marinade. I would suggest making more of the marinade-put half with the chicken and then half with the veggies (we used red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, and onions).   Delicious!!

I made this for a housewarming for about 30 people. I started marinating the chicken that morning, and we made mini skewers with three pieces of chicken and a couple of pieces of pineapple per skewer. Just be careful - they cook very quickly on the grill and are easily overdone. Everyone at the party enjoyed these.

Wonderful!! Just what my husband and I were craving! The chicken was so tender when we used the rice vinegar, and I added sesame seeds, as well. They carmelized on the kabobs beautifully.  I also completely forgot about kabob-ing the pineapple chunks - how could I? So I fryed them in a pan with a splash of the marinade that I had set aside, cut them into smaller chunks, and folded them into the rice I had made. We drizzled some of the marinade on top and my husband said it was the BEST rice he'd ever tasted! so good!

Loved it.  I had extra a heated over the stove in a skillet.  It turned out wonderful as well, not as good as grilling, but good as well.

I was anxious to try this and I'm sorry I did.  This was awful.  I don't know what I did wrong, but the chicken was gritty and tasteless.  I marinated for 3 hours, and I used fresh pineapple.  Whatever happened, this was a disaster for me.

Fabulous - so tasty and tender. I used turkey breasts, cut the oil to just a teaspoon, substituted brandy for the sherry and two cloves of crushed garlic for the powder. I boiled the remaining marinade and poured it over the couscous and broccoli that I served on the side. One amazing supper.

I did half the chicken and twice as much marinade and added mushrooms.  I made the extra marinade into a basting sauce to keep things nice and juicy on the grill.  It was fantastic and my husband said it was better than restraunt quality.  Oh, and I replaced the sherry with orange juice.  We'll definately be making this again.

Excellent!  I tripled the marinade and  kept the chicken separate.  I used rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry.  Made several kabobs using baby bella mushrooms & a variety fresh garden veggies (tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, green bell pepper & sweet onion)  and I used fresh pineapple rather than the canned!  I did heat part of the marinade and thickened with cornstarch to use as a glaze while grilling. Served with "Brazilian White Rice" from this site and it was a perfect summer meal!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were really good. I liked the marinade and the only changes I made were that I didnt use the ginger or the sherry because I didnt have any, so I added a little pineapple juice to it instead. I marinated it overnight and I cooked them under the broiler because I dont have a grill. Yummy, will make again!

Excellent flavor, and very juicy and moist!  I didn't marinate the pineapple along with the chicken, and other than that no changes.  Definately a repeat recipe, thanks.

Really good and flavorful!  I made one change as recommended by another reviewer, I substituted Rice Vinegar for the Sherry the original recipe called for.  I marinated chicken overnight, and separately marinated veges for 4 hours (mushrooms, zucchini, red pepper, vidalia onion, and pineapple).  That seemed to do the trick in terms of infusing the flavor.  This will surely be repeated over the grilling season!

Very tasty.  I would say you need to marinate longer than two hours, I did mine for 8 hours.  The chicken was very flavorful.  I did substitute the sherry with rice vinegar as another reviewer suggested and I happened to have it on hand. I will make this again.

The chicken was great although I think it should have marinated in the sauce a little longer.  It just didn't pick up the taste like I thought it would.  Still very good though!

This chicken was good, and my family liked it quite well.  The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that it just didn't have that extra "oomph" that I look for in a recipe.  That being said, it is a good go-to recipe that is hard to mess up.

I tried this recipe for a barbeque at my house, and everyone loved it! I marinated it for about 8 hours, but I definitely thought it could stand to be marinated overnight. As another reviewer suggested, I marinated the chicken and pinapples separately. I also added green and red bell peppers to the kabobs. Makes for colorful, delicious looking kabobs. Will certainly make it again.

My family and I loved this dish. It is freezing here in NY so I did not grill it instead I cooked it in a wok added a second portion of the sauce and string beans. Served over rice it was excellent. This one is a keeper.

Didn't make kabobs - just used chicken breasts and grilled after marinating for two days in the refrigerator (got busy!) and the family loved it.  Used rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry and 1/2 tsp real ground ginger and 1 tbsp minced garlic (we like stuff spicy--you might want to adjust to taste).  Yum!

VERY YUMMY! I didn't use the pineapple because we didn't have any...put in some mushrooms and used Crown Royal instead of sherry. Marinated for about 3 hours. Cooked in oven for 15 minutes.

I marinated for 4 hours then BBQ'd.  It was good but not as much flavor as I expected.  I probably won't make it again.

Made this recipe for a luau I had attended by 20 people (!)  So it had to be easy and fast to make in big quantities (and it was) and also, of course, taste good.  And the compliments are still coming in!  The irony is that I don't even eat meat, so I couldn't try it, but judging from how much everyone loved them, I sort of wish that I did.  Highly recommended (and easy too!)

This was wonderful!!  We've made it twice so far - once on the grill and once using the broiler.  They were both good but I lean slightly towards the grill version.  Didn't have sherry so I used red wine vinegar as someone else suggested.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder, and made a sauce using the leftover marinade, the juice from the canned pineapple slices and some corn starch.  A definate hit at this house!  Thanks!

Veru flavorful, I cooked it in the oven and added some cornstarch so the sauce would thicken it was delicious with the rest of our BBQ, and didn't take up space on the bbq grill.

A wonderful marinade, just like Teriyaki! I used the recommended amounts for the marinade, but only 4 chicken breasts so that they would be well coated. We'll be making these a lot!

I used 4 chicken breasts but kept the rest of the recipe the same so I would have more marinade. I marinated the chicken for 48 hours and added the pineapple chunks the morning before grilling. I found the sesame oil to be the dominant flavor, so if you're not a fan of it, you probably won't like these. They were tender and sweet and we all really liked them.

This was AWFUL! I followed the recipe with 1 exception....instead of the sherry, I used rice vinegar as one of the reviewers did, and marinated the pineapple SEPARATE from the chicken (cuz that’s just gross). The pineapple was tasty, but the chicken was chalky tasting! I don’t know what I did, but I ended up giving my chicken to the dogs. What a disappointment.

Sad to say this recipe didn't work for my family.  Probably user error but our chicken was bland and dry.  May try again by tweaking the recipe like the other reviewers.

I made this for a luau and everyone raved about it!  The marinade is delicious and well worth making your own.  I marinaded the chicken overnight but did not marinate the pineapple.  I sliced fresh Delmonte gold pineapples just before skewering then skewered the chicken and pineapple just before grilling.  I was cooking for a large group of people so skewering 50 kabobs was rather time consuming.  Next time I make this for a large group I plan on skipping the skewering process and will just put the chicken on a flat top until partway done then I would add the fresh pineapple and cook on the flat top until finished.

I doubled the sauce and marinated chicken and pineapple in one, and peppers, mushrooms, yellow squash and onion in the other. After marinating, I thickened sauce and based throughout cooking time. Hubby loved it! Definitely will make again....

The kids loved it! We couldn't make it on the grill, but I made it on the stovetop. First, I reduced the marinade by 1/4. Next, after browning the chicken I added the marinade and the pineapple to the skillet. I then reduced the heat and cooked until the chicken was cooked through and the sauce had reduced and the chicken & pineapple were 3/4 above the sauce. I served it with sticky rice, fresh pineapple, and peas.

I would definitely make this recipe again.  I served it for dinner with our son and daughter-in-law and it was a huge success.  The chicken was so tender and tasty.  I didn't have any sherry on hand so left that out and couldn't tell that anything was missing.  However, next time I'll try to have sherry to add to the marinade.

Recipe is great as written.  Maybe next time I’ll use some of the pineapple juice in the marinade. Also baste the kabobs with marinade during grilling.

These k-bobs were really tasty. Everyone loved them. The only thing I would change is I would certainly use fresh pineapple  and maybe a  little Tabasco in the marinade or perhaps red pepper flakes !

Labor intensive but delicious. Make sure you don’t put on skewer too tightly or the middle of chicken pieces won’t cook thoroughly.

I made 2x the marinade (with extra ginger) and to the second batch I added a small can of crushed pineapple. I used this batch as a serving sauce to pour over the meat/veggies/fruit and rice that I made to go with this. I put the chicken and pineapple on separate skewers and added veggie skewers as well (zucchini, onion, red pepper and grape tomatoes).

Didn’t have sherry, but found suggestion of substituting 1/2 apple cider vinegar and 1/2 water. On a whim I added several slices of orange pepper to kabobs. Dish was easy to make and was delicious! Will definitely make again.

Great simple recipe. I didn't have sherry at the time so I threw a tablespoon of rum in there. I also let it marinate for 24 hours and the chicken was amazingly tender. I had to try it as a stirfry with broccoli, pea pods, carrots, pineapple, and celery and I dumped in the entire marinade with some cornstarch and it made a great sauce over rice.

Excellent flavor! I would have added some green Bell pepper to the kabobs for flavor and color, and possibly a thickening agent to the marinade so it stuck to the chicken and pineapple a little more.

Yum. Yum. And more yum. We LOVE this!! I have made this many times. Follow the recipe, although I do not marinate the pineapple (I use fresh), and I add red, orange, yellow, and green peppers on the skewers (also not marinated). Also, I use gluten free, low sodium soy sauce, which is totally fine. Throw them on the grill and serve over rice with a fresh salad. Fantastic and easy!!! Give it a try, especially in the summer!

I didn't have Sherry or time. I used pineapple juice to substitute the sherry and marinated about 45 minutes. It was a hit! Darn no photo, it went too quick!

I loved this. Could be made with pork. Used fresh pineapple and marinated the chicken in Toshidas in the fridge. Added some onion to the skillet and cooked the chicken on high. Threw in the pineapple to caramelize. Made the sauce separately and used fresh ginger and garlic. Put over coconut rice.

It tastes like a very weak teriyaki marinade. I added pineapple chunks and bell peppers to the cooking chicken (not marinade), which were GREAT I'd do that again for sure.  Note to self: Never buy Kikkoman again, use Yoshida's or SoyVey.

loved this, put it on the veggies too!  boil down marinade until it starts to thicken while the kabobs are cooking, then baste with sauce when almost done.  YUM, great for grilling weather!

I made it with no changes, other than reduce amount of marinade, because we only cooked one large chicken breast.  The next time I would definitely use more marinade because I would like to have had enough to baste the chicken and vegetables while they were cooking.  We did cook peppers and onions on separate skewers.

This was pretty delicious. Only modification I will make in the future is adding red bell peppers to it. Served it with white rice and Hawaiian rolls. Went over pretty well for first time. Looking forward to making it again in the future with the bell peppers!

This was ok, but ended up dry and the flavour of the marinade didn't really shine despite the chicken being discoloured by it. Probably won't make again.

I messed up the recipe and it was still good! I didn’t have sherry so I used red wine vinegar (don’t ask my why-didn’t do my research) and accidentally used ROASTED sesame oil instead of sesame oil. My family loved them. I did marinate the chicken and pineapple separately and doubled the marinade so I had some to thicken with cornstarch to apply at the end as others had suggested. I will definitely try this again

This marinade made the chicken very mushy. I did not like it one bit and neither did my Husband. We ended up throwing the food in the trash. We were very disappointed. I do not know if it's the Sherry or the sesame oil that caused the food to get this soft and moshy.

Just finished a great dinner. Didn't have sesame oil or sherry so subbed pineapple juice and evoo. Also added green peppers.  Will definitely be making this often, hopefully with the right.   ingredients. Served with rice and tossed green salad. Be sure to soak skewers to avoid burning.

I followed directions, despite what all the reviews said....my bad. Chicken did get pasty texture but the flavor overall was delicious.  next time I'll marinate chicken separately from pineapple - I used a whole fresh golden pineapple.  In the meantime I'm going to make some more of that marinade into a sauce (looking at reviews)and try to fix the leftovers and serve over rice.

Marinade is great, but I would use fresh pineapple (more firm) and would not marinate the pineapple.

I used fresh pineapple. 
I also used up my mushrooms and bell peppers. 
Following others' advice, I marinated the meat (4hrs)  and veggies (2 hrs) separately. (Doubled the marinade) 
Great flavour! 
I will try with pork next time. Chicken got mushy. 
I baked @ 350*F for 20 minutes. Will BBQ next time too.

The instructions say marinate at least 2 hours.  I cut my chicken in the morning and marinated about 8 hours since there was no max time listed.  The chicken was  spongy, threw it all away.  Wish it would have advised max marinade time.

Delicious.  I've read some have had trouble with mushy chicken.  Use the juice from the pineapple into the marinade and put the pineapple pieces away in the fridge for later.  Add them only when you put the kabobs together.  Also, its been my experience that shrimp shouldn't be marinaded overnight because it will get mushy.

I made grilled Kabobs the first night and let the rest marinade for another day and made this delicious stir fry. Have added this to my recipe book and will make it often.

Followed the recipe exactly. The pinapple camr out fine but it completely ruined the chicken. Turned it into a gross paste somehow. I marinated it for 2 hours and BBQ'd the skewers and it was inedible due to texture. I dont know what went wrong but be weary that there are others who have experienced this problem

Jaw-dropping flavor & tenderness! Substituted Cooked Shrimp & Ham, Yellow Onions, Red & Green Bell Peppers & added Scallions, Black Pepper & Honey to Marinade. We expanded recipe;made 50! 
Used garden clippers to economize, by cutting Bamboo skewers in 1/2 (to 6"). In rush to serve guests - marinated only 1 hour & that worked fine.  Count on this adjustment to be incredible. Brushed extra sauce on while grilling.
Thanks to the original chef. We owe you!!

The best, most tender, delicious!  I didn't have time to soak it in the marinade for more than a few minutes. So we brushed it on while we grilled and it turned out great!

Very tasty. I used fresh pineapple and garlic. We grilled the chicken on separate skewers from the pineapple and peppers because we weren't sure they'd cook the same...We'd never done kebobs. The chicken came out super tender and flavorful. I will definitely use this recipe again.

These were nice. I had a fresh pineapple to use, and knowing the juices can react with stuff I took other's advice and didn't add the pineapple to the marinating chicken. I didn't have any sherry so subbed some red wine vinegar, and in addition to the breasts used for the kabobs I also put some wings and thighs in the marinade and baked them and they turned out delish. Will make again.

I marinated overnight and chicken and pineapple turned out great. A pretty quick bbq and tasty, too. I was tempted to add some red bell peppers, but did not. I think I will try that next time.

I made these for one of our meals while camping. I used fresh pineapple because I just don't care for canned. I also used shrimp and chicken.  The flavor was fabulous!  I wish I had read the reviews as we thought the meat got mushy, or "pasty". Someone else had suggested marinating the meat separate fromthe pineapple to avoidthis. Next time I will try that.

Followed other reviewer suggestion to marinate meat/fruit separately so no problems with texture. Great flavor- will add onion/ pepper chunks next time. Husband not fond of chicken but ate two servings. Really liked this one

This is definitely a versatile recipe based on the reviews.  It rained so grilling was out. So I turned it into a stir fry! Browned the chicken over high heat and it got a nice carmelization. Removed it from the pan and added the pineapple chunks until they blistered and browned in spots. Removed that to the chicken plate and added the marinade to the pan,  with a bit of cornstarch to thicken after boiling. Very tasty!!

The recipe was great as is but I wish I would've read some reviews.  I used dried herbs and seasonings since it was faster.  I will try and use fresh ingredients next time.  I marinated overnight.  I added red bell pepper and mushrooms in addition to the pineapple to introduce different textures.  Although, I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again, I will use a previous reviewers suggestion and make basting marinade as there was only a hint of it.  Also, I suggest using a low flame on the grill or indirect heat as the sugar-containing marinade causes it to flare up and burn more easily if not supervised.

What a quick and easy recipe for guests.  I added green peppers and onions to the kabobs for anyone who wanted them.  I've made this twice now it was a hit both times,  The second time I used fresh pineapple on the kabobs, so there would be bigger chunks.  I shredded some of the canned pineapple chunks and added that to the sauce.  When grilling, watch the chicken carefully to get  the centers cooked through, but not too long as   the chicken can dry out quickly.

I marinated the chicken by itself and left out the pineapple until ready to skewer then tossed in the pineapple.  Pineapple has an enzyme that breaks down proteins as does papaya.  So it generally does not work out well to marinate meat except for a very short time in those juices or with the fruit.  That is why it turns the meat to mush

This is one of our favorite meals. I don't both making kabobs. I just use the marinade on chicken tenders. I do not marinade any of the vegetables. I usually grill pineapple and sweet peppers with the chicken.

It was okay. Doesn't have enough flavor. Should marinade it overnight maybe.

Definitely like adding pineapples, peppers, and onion to the skewers! Definitely make larger pieces of all the veggies and chicken, as it was easy for the chicken to dry out. I would add some kind of glaze on top after all is cooked--I want to try a teriyaki glaze! Overall a very good marinade!

My family loved it and we've made it more than once.  I had to cut down on the marinating time to just 1 hour so the kids didn't starve and it was still flavorful.  I added extra pineapple since that was really our favorite part.

While it was good, the sauce stuck a lot to my grill even with spray and it was hard to grill.  I would just soak the chicken and pineapple the night before and simply use my fryer to cook this up.

I enjoyed the chicken in this recipe but it was not a favorite of my children's.  I didn't care for the marinated pineapple.  I did make a few changes....i substituted rice wine vinegar for the sherry and fresh garlic for the garlic powder.  I added pineapple juice and a chopped onion to the marinade.  I did choose to keep the pineapple separate from the chicken (with a little extra brown sugar for the pineapple!) during the marinade process and instead of grilling I broiled.  I discarded the marinade left over from the chicken marinade but added cornstarch to the leftover pineapple marinade and reduced it to make a dipping sauce.  The chicken was delicious in the dipping sauce but I felt that alone, the chicken tasted overwhelmingly like soy.

We don't grill, so I threw it all in the slow cooker, I figured it would cook and marinate at the same time. I used chicken thighs and the meat was very moist.  Delicious served over rice.

We made this as one of our first recipes on our new charcoal grill. It was a great place to start. We halved the chicken, but kept the marinade amount the same. The marinade tasted great, but it wasn't strong enough for my taste. Maybe marinating longer (we marinated the chicken and pineapple separately for two hours). I'd definitely make this recipe again, but with some changes!

We really enjoyed these!  We put squash on as well but it probably should have soaked a little more in the marinade as the squash wasn't as flavorful as the rest.  To cook them over the fire I put them on oil sprayed tin foil which turned out well

Wow, I was sooooo disappointed with this recipe after it had so many positive posts and star rating. After following the recipe to a "t" , I found the meat flavor extremely bland and unexciting. I would recommend adding fresh ginger and garlic instead of dry. Marinating the meat in pineapple juice would give it more tang while adding a dash of Thai chili paste or even lemon grass to the mix would really amp up the taste. My guests were equally unimpressed. I like lots of flavor and it we are going for a tropical chicken, then add more flavor...just like in the tropics. Marinate the new mix overnight and voila! greatness!

Easy to prepare, I made this just as described. My husband an I really liked it. The chicken turn out very tender, marinaded about 3 hours. I left the pineapple separate from the meat during the marinade due to reading the reviews and everything turned out perfect.

My family loved this recipe!  I switched apple cider vinegar for the sherry and used toasted sesame oil, doubled the recipe and it came out great!  I do recommend marinating the chicken and pineapple at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.  Turned out great, the brown sugar caramelized and it was done in 20 minutes on the grill.

The chicken was great, but I wasn't crazy about the pineapple. Usually I love pineapple either fresh or grilled, but I think I didn't like it with this marinade. Next time maybe I'll just marinate the chicken and not the pineapple. Also, we didn't have any sherry so we used wine instead. It still turned out well. We had this with baked beans and the Asian Coconut Rice recipe on this website.

Followed the recipe except for marinating time. This was a last minute thing so I marinated for 30 minutes but the chicken still came out pasty. It smelled great and pineapples were ok but I could not get over the pasty-ness of chicken. I will try again but will follow KAJEWSKI suggestions. Will update how they come out next time.

No change to ingredients, but used as a chicken marinate instead. Cooled to room temperature, put small slits in chicken breasts then combined marinate and chicken in a zip lock bag, pressing out air.  Refrigerated for 2 hours. Grilled and used marinate to baste.  Fantastic flavor, guests raved!

You have to so careful not to over cook these especially on the grill.  The chicken can easily get dried out and tough.  I felt like the taste of the soy sauce was to overwhelming along with the seseme oil.  I will cut both down the next time I make this.  I also marinated the chicken alone. I did as others suggested and cooked down the marinade adding a little corn starch but again the soy sauce was to powerful, we didn't use it. We will try again, but I appreciate all who made suggestions.

Delicious!  I had limited time, so the chicken marinated for only about 15 minutes.  I used fresh pineapple and a can of white potatoes.  Skewered it all and grilled it.  Because the potatoes were on the kabob, I didn't even need a side dish.  Quick and easy.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, dailyn2003.

Delicious! I did as another cook suggested and boiled the leftover vegetable marinade combined with 2tbs cornstarch and 1/3 or so cup water. It makes a great baste/sauce.

I thickened the marinade slightly with cornstarch and served as a sauce for pulled chicken & pulled pork sandwiches.  Yummy and received raves at our annual picnic!

This marinade was absolutely wonderful! Substituted red wine vinegar for the rice wine (I couldn't find it anywhere!)

We have made this twice already... once we just made on the stove (which came out very watery but was still delicious), and the second time we finally tried it on the grill! Yum!

We have tried with both chicken and shrimp- both are amazing.

Highly, highly recommend!

Tested it on Saturday and will make it again on Monday for Memorial Day. The marinate has a strong smell but it does not overpower the chicken.  Great recipe!

I tried this last night and everyone loved it. I used chicken tenderloins and used canned pineapple instead of fresh since I didn't want to head to the store.  Only modification was using some pineapple juice in the marinade too from using the canned pineapple.  Let it all sit for 3-4 hrs in the frig and put on skewers.  Easy and yummy! Thanks for posting. :)

We loved this!!! The only change I made was using Teriaki sauce rather than soy sauce, because I didn't have any on hand. Everyone loved them!!Definitely marinate over night. Excellent with pork also. Fresh pineapple is the only way to go!

YUMMMMMMMMMMMY!  I used rice vinegar instead of sherry as others suggested, and I paired the kebabs with the Tropiguac (Hawaiian-style Guacamole) also from this site and blue corn chips.  Could not have had a fresher meal with some new flavors!

Couldn't get enough of this. The canned pineapple was trick to keep on the skewers, but I used big metal ones. Next time I will try bamboo ones and if that doesn't work easily, unmarinated fresh pineapple.

This was delicious.  I made it exactly according to the recipe the first time.  Next time, I will marinate the chicken overnight and use the pineapple juice as part of the marinade, leaving the pineapple chunks to be added to the skewers before cooking.  My husband loved it too.

Used rice vinegar instead of sherry. Cut up 4 chicken breasts into chunky strips and marinated with canned pineapple chunks and seasonings for about an hour. Discarded the pineapples and used a pan grill to cook the chicken. Boiled and simmered the remaining marinade while cooking the chicken. Pan grilled bell peppers and onion. Served with white rice. Delish!

Made these for my 13yo's birthday party. Huge hit, no leftovers, sadly.  I did bbq the chicken and pineapple separately because I am not a fan of blackened pineapple, and subbed allspice for ginger because I was out, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Definitely will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did sub out rice wine vinegar for the sherry and it tasted great.  Follow the suggestions of other reviewers and it turns out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out GREAT!!!! Followed the recipe as written for the marinade. I added zucchini and bell peppers to the skewers along with the chicken.  Made a second batch of the marinade, replacing the sherry with the rice vinegar.  The second batch was used to baste the chicken while grilling.  Grilled the chicken and veggies.  Separately grilled the pineapple for a few minutes.  Added all items in a bowl and served.

Wonderful! The only thing I changed was to make two bags of marinade, one for the chicken and one for the pineapple and veggies,  and I added the pineapple juice from the can of fruit to each of the marinades, just because it seemed to be a waste not to use it.  Wonderful with onions and sweet peppers on the skewers. Simple too!

I made this for a junior high church retreat. Everyone absolutely loved these kabobs, telling me they were the best chicken kabobs they've ever had. I made one change as recommended by another reviewer - used rice vinegar instead of sherry. I had to share this recipe with several in attendance at the retreat as well as others who heard about it.

i did NOT add the pineapple (ok, well like 4 little quarter pieces and a touch of juice)... in reading other reviews was afraid of the pineapple ruining the chicken.....  and well, glad i did not add all of them..... turned out wonderful.... thank you thank you thank you.....

We've made this one a couple of times this season so far, and my husband keeps asking me to pick up pineapples so he has an excuse to make it again.  Taken to parties, it's a huge hit!  Leftovers are incredible too, I put them in wraps for myself and the flavor is still great.  Basting with (veg only) reduced leftover marinade worth the time.  So easy!  Thanks for posting, and thanks to KAJEWSKI for condensing the tips!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  Marinated for about five hours, and added some onion onto the skewers.  Chicken was moist, and the grilled pineapple added some sweet bites.  Served with a bit of brown rice.  Will definitely make again!

GREAT! Made as written, except for not adding the pineapple in with the chicken. I marinated the chicken overnight, then skewered it with the pineapple before cooking. Wonderful flavor! I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

absolutely loved it, especially with chopped up strawberries floating in it. Made this for a baby shower and put it in that duck  inflatable bath tub (unused ad washed out) then gave it to the mom as a gift. Everybody loved how it tasted and thought the decor idea was great! HUGE HIT!!

This was delicious.  I used garlic instead of garlic powder (I think I just read the recipe too fast), but otherwise followed the recipe.  I skewered bell peppers and onion in addition to the chicken and pineapple.  Served with rice.  This was filling, satisfying, and flavorful.  This will go in my regular rotation.  Excellent flavor.

A fruity, delicious way to prepare chicken. We don't have a grill and I was feeling lazy, so I baked the chicken and pineapple (and mushrooms, green peppers, and red peppers, which I also threw in) in the marinade at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. We ate it with white rice, and it turned out fabulously! I will make this again.

Marinated chicken and vegetables, separately overnight.  My fiance thought it was pork, which he loves, and I didn't bother to tell him otherwise.  I did add the cornstarch to the vegetable marinade to baste, as others recommended, but it was much too thick, even though I only used half the amount of cornstarch.  Will try again without the cornstarch.

This was probably a 4.5* - very good.  I used sherry as written, not rice vinegar, and marinated for about 5 hours (meat and fresh pineapple separately).  15 mins before bbqing, added cut-up veggies (mushroom, zucchini, pepper chunks) to the pineapple marinade.  We actually grilled the meat and pineapple/veggies separately and both turned out excellently - the boneless, skinless chicken was just right (not dry, not chewy).  I'd use this again.

Fantastic flavor!  I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders, and it turned out perfectly moist and tender.  I cooked the leftover meat & pineapple that didn't fit on the amount of skewers that I had in a skillet and served it with rice.  Equally delish!

Based on other reviews I used rice vinegar instead of sherry and marinated meat seperate from the pineapple.  After marinating, the chicken developed a weird texture (kind of dry in places). It tasted ok when all said and done.

We eat this once a week in the summer. I LOVE IT! Here are the changes I make. I substitute rice vinegar for the sherry to make the chicken really tender. I double the marinade and put half with the chicken and half with the pineapple. Then when my husband grills them, he'll baste the kabobs with the leftover pineapple marinade. So so good...

Wow. Made this tonight for dinner. It was absolutely fantastic. I don't have any sherry, so instead I just used a couple tablespoons of pineapple juice in the marinade. It was so great. I marinated my veggies and chicken separately then used the leftover veggie marinade on the chicken as it cooked. If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would!

I'd give this 4&1/2 stars if I could.  The chicken turned out very tender and juicy, but a little too sweet.  I didn't marinate the pineapple with the chicken, but I did substitute 1 Tbs vinegar and 1 Tbs pineapple juice for the sherry in the marinade.  I also added extra veggies on the kabobs.  I think it would taste better with less brown sugar, so I'll try that next time.

I did this TWICE this week for friends and then family and they RAVED about it! I follwed the reviews and did rice wine vinegar instead of sherry. I also doubled the recipe and marinated the chunks for atleast 2 hrs. I didn't marinate the pineapple at all either time and just grilled it. I love pineapple and didn't want to take the flavor away at all. Anyway served with rice and spinach and strawberry salad...PERFECT for summertime!

I tripled the marinade as well.  I added vadalia onion, red, yellow and orange peppers.  This was excellent.  I marinated the chicken and pineapple for two days, seperately.

Made this this weekend, used both rice vinegar and sherry.  Three times the recipe for the marinade is about right.  We used red pepper as well and it was great.  Shredded the cooked left over chicken and made salad with it today.  Very great.

Per other reviewers, I replaced the sherry with rice wine vinegar.  I marinated the chicken for 4 hours and it came out decent.  My guest didn't rave about the kabobs only because I have my own personal chicken recipe that they LOVE and can't get enough of. I guess I'll be sticking to my own recipe from now on.

I used fresh pineapple. These were so good that at my birthday luau last year they disappeared so fast I nearly missed out on trying them!  The last one that my boyfriend had saved for me I got one bite of and then it got drug off by an ill-behaved dog.  The one bite I had was very tasty though!  Be sure to get rid of fatty pieces on chicken.

I tried this recipe in hopes of duplicating the flavor of a local Hawaiian BBQ restaurant, but this just wasn't what I was hoping for. It was good, but I probably won't make it again.

I made a few modifications to this recipe- 1) I doubled the recipe 2) I used fresh ginger instead of ginger powder 3) I added some pineapple juice to the marinade.  I marinaded the chicken for 24 hrs and then grilled it, it was very good and flavorful!!

This was pretty good.  I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars, but not quite 5.   I also added some of the pineapple juice to the marinade.  I grilled half and baked half and both turned out great.  I marinated for about 3 hours - I think next time I make it I will marinate for longer.  Served with rice.

Everyone loved it!  I tripled the marinade so I would have lots for basting.  I kept the chicken and the veggies in separate zip lock bags while marinating.  I also added Onion, red & green pepper chunks and halved mushrooms.  Delicious.  I will be making these again for 40 guests at my daughters 2nd Birthday Luau.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe turned out really well.  I basted the chicken with the marinade glaze and that really makes a difference.  Next time I'll use more than just pineapple though.

I liked them too.  I didn't have sherry so I skipped that step and added pineapple juice.  Only marinated for about 2 hours and used other peoples suggestion to boil the marinade and bast w/ it.  Fiance gives it a 5 and hes a tough judge!

I marinated for about 3 hours. It must not have been long enough because I thought the chicken was pretty bland tasting. The pineapple was too flavorful, though. I wouldn't recommend marinating the fruit. I will try again but with chicken thighs. The chicken breast was too dry with this marinade.

Well, they were good, but I couldn't really taste the marinade at all.  Granted, I didn't use sherry, but other reviewers said they left that out and it was just fine.  I only marinated for 1 hour--just ran out of time--so maybe that was why?  They were still good, just not as good as I thought they would be.  I won't use this recipe again though.

This recipe was FABULOUS!! I had a LUAU themed party this weekend and made these. I added onion to the kabobs and subsituted rice vinegar for the sesame oil(i couldnt find it in the store) and they were delicious, everyone was asking for the recipe. Thanks, these were wonderful.

eeehhh... followed ALL of KAJEWSKI advice and my chicken came out gummy like other reviewers. Maybe next time I will not marinate over six hours (like other reviewers suggested) and try them on the grill them. I'll stick with Krafts recipe for now. The three stars are because of the marinade - it was GREAT.

Loved it! Used real garlic instead of garlic powder, added some sesame seeds and added about 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice to the marinade. Made a double batch and marinated chicken, red onion, red pepper and pineapple for about an hour. Served with a wild rice pilaf. Will add this one to the rotation. Thanks.

I followed the recipe except used white wine in place of sherry.  Only marinated an hour too but it was delicious.  Moist, flavorful and fantastic over wheat rice.

LOVED these. I made extra marinade on the side as well for dipping sauce. I also used peaches as well as pineapples and they turned out great. I baked these on 350 for 20 minutes and they came out perfect.

I had the same problem as someone else, my chicken turned somewhat gummy.  I used fresh pineapple and though that might be the problem.  We liked the sauce so much (I made an extra batch on the stove)that my family and I agreed we would try it again, but with canned pineapple.

I made this recipe for a family event. I substituted the sherry for rice vinegar. I also recommend letting it marinate over night.  I didn't use the sesame oil either. I made an extra batch of marinade and the mixed it with cornstarch for a dipping sauce. Everyone enjoyed it.

I made these last night for my boyfriend and we both really liked them (even though I ended up cooking them a little too long and the chicken dried out a bit).  I added red and green pepper and didn't marinate the pineapple.  I also used fresh garlic and ginger in the marinate.

I made these for a summer bbque -- with great reviews.  I made the sauce and marinated them the day before so all I had to do was put them on the grill when the guest arrived.  Super easy and will do again.  Sent this recipe home with several guests

This was awesome!  Made it on the charcoal grill, served over rice and with a romaine salad.  Some pieces of the chicken were a little dry, next time I'll make some extra marinade to baste.  Awesome flavor!

I liked the flavor of the marinade.  I wish I would have had more of it for the rice as others suggested.  We added onions to the skewes which was really good.  I would have added green pepper, too if I had had it.  I cooked them in the oven because we are out of propane for the grill, but I think I would have liked the flavor and crispiness a grill would have added.

Next time I think I will marinate overnight, for better flavor. Also, don't let your husband over cook it on the grill.

This was absolutely delicious!  Didn't change the recipe at all, but did marinate it overnight.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a winner - I didn't marinate the pineapple andI actually cooked it in a pan on the stove after the chicken marinated overnight. Still really good. Can't wait to try on the grill.

This was so good.  You really don't taste the brown sugar at all, which I prefer.  My boyfriend made these for me and added Vidalia onions, mushrooms, red pepper, and green pepper to the skewer and served it over white rice.  It was so good.  (May make extra sauce next time to mix in with the rice.) I asked him to make me something creative, and he did.

This was pretty good. Not a "knock you socks off" recipe.  I marinated the overnight and added mushroom to the kabobs.  We over cooked this.  It should be about 7 minutes, turn and then anthoer 7 minutes cook time.  We all agreed that you have to eat the pineapple and chicken in the same mouth full.

Excellent flavor. I ended up using fresh garlic and added some onion chunks on the skewers too. It was wonderful!
