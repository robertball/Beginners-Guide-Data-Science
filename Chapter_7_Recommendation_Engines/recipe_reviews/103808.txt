This recipe is a great start to many other guava delights.  In Mexico, they spread it out thin, sugar it, and roll it up after cooling, like a little fruit roll.  You can use lime instead of orange juice for a little added zip!  Super Tropical!!!

Instead of OJ, I used a cup of Lilikoi juice with a splash of lime. I ignored step 3 completely. Poured it into a mason jar, and called it jam. It's great.

I really wanted to like this, but it became impossible to eat. I followed the directions exactly, but it was grainy and eventually solidified to the point that I had to dissolve all that sugar using hot water just to clean out the container.
