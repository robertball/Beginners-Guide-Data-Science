First let me state that I have never liked the taste of venison.  With that said, this was a wonderful recipe.  I even ate it!  It tasted like pasta in garden spaghetti sauce.  I omitted the green and pinto beans though.  I also used cubed pieces of venison instead of ground.  I recommend all to try it and vary it to your taste buds.  My children and husband asked when I was going to make it again!

This was very good.  Very little prep time, just let it simmer away!  Mine turned out fairly thick, almost like chili - it would be good with cornbread. My 13-month old couldn't get enough of it.

My husband is a hunter and requested that I make some type of venison soup for our x-mas dinner.  I found this recipe and made it and it was absolutely delicious.  I was cooking for 12 and because it was a first course and not a main meal I added small soup pasta instead of ziti.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water and actually added a can extra so it wouldn't be so thick.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  Best soup I think I have ever made.  It's a keeper for sure!!

The hunters in my family loved this!  I tripled the recipe to share with all the hungry hunters and the only bad thing that happened was that the crock pot was overflowing! We did not add green beans-but it was still great.  The spices blend together nicely and coming from a person that won't eat venison, I have to admit that is smelled pretty good.  Some guys sent reusable containers to my husband asking if there was anymore.  Would be great for winter hunt club days.  Thanks for the recipe! (You made me a hit with the hunt club!)

I make this at least once a month, until I run out of venison.  The only changes I make are I leave out the green beans and add some beef broth to give it a more soup like consistancy.  Husband and kids love this soup and I can make it in the morning and not have to cook..say on a Friday night.  Which is what I'm doing today.  :)

This is an incredible recipe.  My 3 yr old and 1 yr old loved it, even my picky hubby loved it!  I substituted chopped venison for ground, omitted the beans and added more pasta and veggies.  Ate it with tomato basil cheesy bread until we were stuffed!  Not a spur of the moment recipe though.

As usual, when cooking with venison the soup has a richer flavor than if beef was used.  The canned beans & tomatoes make this recipe easy & fast. It smells wonderful as it simmers & tastes even better. The only problem is it tastes so good there's slim pickings on the leftovers so I think I'll double it next time.

Fabulous,I've never cooked with venison before,but was given some venison sausage.  This recipe worked wonderfully,smelled great, and was very tasty.  I'm hooked! I omitted the beans and used what pasta I had on hand and it turned out great.

This is amazing!  My husband is an avid hunter and so I always have venison in the freezer. Getting me to cook it was like pulling teeth....lol....I  decided to try this because of the excellent reviews it got. Everyone loved it including me!  I did modify it a little bit! Used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water and potatoes and carrots instead of the beans...I did use all of the seasoning as in the recipe.  It was very tasty!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Followed recipe to a "t". I did not like this, but my husband did. It would have been a lot better without adding the uncooked pasta. Maybe adding cooked pasta when serving? Pasta soaked up all the broth and made it REALLY thick. The broth was fantastic before adding the pasta. Loved the veggies/meat/spice combo. Would make again without pasta.

First time I have ever cooked or ate venison.  The recipe was perfect for ground venison...like a veggie "chili mac."  Subbed green peppers that had to get used up for green beans and used macaroni.  Meat wasn't bitter or gamey, but gave the dish an interesting spice and heartiness.

I've read over this recipe a million times, and STILL can't figure out what I did wrong! :o(.  All of my measurements were correct but my finished product had more of a chili consistency than that of soup.  It still tasted very good, but I had to cook the pasta separately instead and it made more of a meat sauce than the soup we were looking forward to.

This soup is really really good. I do not use the pasta, and instead of using basil and oregano, I use tupperware's italian herb seasoning(if you don't have this,buy it, it is awesome in soups and spaghetti sauces)I use this soup when my whole family gets togethter and goes camping, and everybody just loves it. SO GOOD!!!!

We really loved this but will probably cook the pasta separately next time only because the pasta did not do well after freezing.

The flavor in this is really great. My only problem was the consistancy. I prefer a more brothy soup. I added about 3 cups of extra broth, omitted the green beans, carrots, and zucchini, and it was STILL as thick as chili. Next time I'll have to use even more broth and less noodles.

Great soup! Green beans felt a little out of place with the whole recipe and I will probably exclude them next time around.  Thanks!

Very good.  Forgot to add the green beans, but it was still a very hearty soup.  It was even better the next day.  I only simmered the soup half as long as the recipe called for and it still tasted great!  I appreciate any and all tried and true vension recipes.

Definitely needed much more water throughout the whole process.  The water kept cooking off and the food got burned.

I did not have ground venison so I used ground beef instead.  Otherwise I thought it was very good and I will make it again.

I am not a big soup fan, but I make this one frequently. I always make more and freeze some for later.

This recipe is Excellent! Only changes I made are, added about 1/4 cup more water, changed to Black Beans instead of pinto beans (husband doesn't like pinto beans)no zucchini because I didn't have any on hand. Also, reading from the reviews, I cooked the pasta, rinsed then added desired amount into the soup after it was cooked..then heated thru. Its good the day it's made, but Great the following day. I also used vension, which I have an abundance of.
Thank you, Joelene.

This recipe is fabulous. Just a couple of changes: I used cubed venison. Also, I added a green pepper. I cooked the pasta separately and just added it to each bowl individually. That way the pasta does not expand quite so much. I added a little olive oil when browning the venison (it's so lean). A complete meal! Thanks for sharing.

Man, Venison is sooo strong tasting, I never knew what gamey tasted like til now.  A friend of ours was moving and gave us this meat, had no idea how to cook ground venison, cuz I had no idea what it would taste good with.  This was absolutely perfect though.  I tried hamburger helper with it once.  NASTY TASTING DISASTER.  LoL  Please don't make fun of me!

The flavour is excellent.  However, it is not really a soup. I added an extra 2 cups of water but still more like pasta with lots of sauce.  I will definately make again, only next time less pasta (pre-cooked and rinsed as suggested by previous reviewer), more water or broth.  Thanks for a great venison recipe.

This was very good.  I used some deer meat that a friend gave us.  I'm glad the spices overwhelmed the "wild" flavor.  I used what I had on hand which was a little chopped broccoli and some frozen corn instead of the zucchini.  I added a can of tomato soup with one can of water for extra juice.  I didn't add the pasta, but I will next time. A very versatile recipe. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!!!

I left out the zucchini (don't like them), and added extra water because this was SO thick.  Next time I'd add broth instead of the extra water because I think I compromised the flavor of this soup.

This recipe was really good.  Instead of venison I used lean hamburger meat, and sauted it with onion and garlic.  The soup was very hearty and more like a stew.  My family including my 17 month old boy loved it.

My husband LOVED this!  And he's not really a soup eater.  The only thing I did different was add whatever leftover veggies I had in the fridge and used orzo in place of the spiral pasta.  Would definitely make again!  Thanks, Joelene!

I don't much like the taste of venison, but with the spices I couldn't really taste it.  I loved the way it made my kitchen smell with all the spices.  I've made it twice and the second time we omitted the pasta all together, and served it with crackers instead.  My family loved it!

Very good.  I couldn't even taste the vension.  I omited the zucchini and used Ditalini pasta.  Some may like it to have a little bit more broth.  I always cook my pasta separate and it rinse before adding it to any dish.  This way the starch from the pasta will not thicken the soup broth/recipe.

I would definitely make this again but without the pasta.  I'm giving it 4 stars because of that.  I ate a bowl of this before I added the pasta (which was awesome!) and I felt that the pasta took away from the blend of flavors....especially since the pasta thickened the dish up, leaving very little juice.  If you choose to add the pasta, I suggest adding more stock/water and tomato sauce to still have the consistency of a soup.  Following this recipe was more like a thick stew.

Update:  I've made this recipe twice since my initial review and leave out the pasta every time!  Excellent as a soup-like dish!!!  I've also made a couple of adjustments to it: two cans of stewed tomatoes, can of yellow or white corn, substitute chicken stock for the water, increase black pepper to (1) tsp.  I love this dish with these minor adjustments.  I always say I'm gonna try adding some diced potatoes to the dish as well (add more stock if doing this), but I always end up knowing I'm going to freeze left-overs and potatoes won't hold up well.  Will turn into mush the next time it's reheated!  But otherwise, a great dish!

I have five boys in the house that love to hunt, so we are always looking for new recipes for venison.  This is my husband's new favorite and all the kids (except for my daughter that "hates meat" really liked it too...even with the veggies.  I used kidney beans instead of the pinto beans since that is what I had on hand, but it turned out great!

Thankyou Joelene for posting this recipe which
I found to be both forgiving/flexible and a 
100% KEEPER!!    My soup came out great even tho.
I did not have the two cans of tomato sauce and
had to substitute kidney beans for the pintos.
Also.. my stewed tomatos had onion, celery and 
green pepper in them.    Still...  totallllly great!   My first time cooking venison.. now I
wish I could get it ALL the time!

Wow, this is good.  I have made it twice and both times have gotten great responses.  I echo others comments that this is very thick and hearty -- not a problem, it just is not very soupy.   I couldn't find fusili, so I used rotini and instead of stewed tomatoes, I used the canned diced tomatoes I had on hand.

Great taste! The only change I would make would be to decrease the amount of pasta.  I used 6 oz instead of 8 and would decrease it even more next time so that it wasn't so thick.  All in all, a great recipe I'll be using again.
