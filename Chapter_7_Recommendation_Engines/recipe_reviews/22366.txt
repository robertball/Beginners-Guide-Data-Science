This was really good, however I think I will refrigerate for about 1/2 to 1 hour after putting on the chocolate layer next time.  The peanut butter layer melted in with the chocolate layer, and did not look as pretty as the picture.  The scaling for this recipe did not work properly, so I had to eyeball the amounts.  Also, the microwave burned the chocolate before it melted it all, so I ended up doing it over a double boiler.  My boyfriend loved it tho, and thought the chocolate/PB mess looked charmingly homemade...thanks!

this recipe was fun to make! We used Carmels too for the children with peanut allergies.
 P.S. Stardust: Chocolate has to be stired often as it retains its shape even when melted in the Microwave.

Super easy to do!!  the only thing I modified was heating the chocolate over the stove instead of the microwave.  That way I was able to keep the chocolate 'liquid' while dipping all the apples.  Other than that, it was GREAT!

My husband and I both love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate... so I thought of making these apples... they turned out great! A very good recipe!

I made these as a treat for my co-workers and they went crazy over them. I used twenty ounce apples. The tartness of the apple was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the chocolate.  Just make sure to let the chocolate layer cool before adding the peanut butter.

Sorry, hate to break the 5 star review, but I really think I expected more than what I got. I Liked the peanut butter part of the apples but the chocolate part was just not good enough tasting and a little on the soft side. I would have like a harder chocolate coating like that on a choc covered cherry. The presentation was very good however. Easy, Fun and Attractive just not very tasty!

I actually modified this recipe a little.  Instead of peanut butter chips I went with white chocolate (my husband is allergic to peanuts) I think it turned out nicely.  It was a nice alternative to carmel apples.

Forgot to rate this at Halloween. Made these for Halloween and a bake sale. They are a hit! You must make sure that the first layer is completely set before you add the second layer. I used  as written for Halloween and recently for a bake sale I used white chocolate instead of peanut butter for a black/white look. Next year I am going to do peanut butter as a base and do the dark chocolate on top. Thank you.
