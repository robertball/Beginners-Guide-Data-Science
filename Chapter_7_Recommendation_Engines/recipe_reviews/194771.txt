This cheesecake recipe is wonderful!  The texture is perfect and the crust was delicious! One thing I would for sure change is the caramel topping.  It was tasty, but the caramel hardned once I placed it in the fridge and when I tried to cut it, the topping messed up.  I suggest a LIQUID CARAMEL TOPPING that is normally for ice cream. That way it is soft.  But keep the caramel candy in the cheesecake part, it was delicious.

Oh my goodness! What a wonderful cheesecake! The texture is so creamy and the crust, mmm. The pecans just add a special touch to it. I made this recipe almost as exactly stated. The only change I made was the caramel I used. I did not use Kraft caramels, I used Praline Sundae Topping (with the nuts omitted - recipe from this site) for the entire recipe. The amount to be used in the batter (36 melted caramels) would be 1Â¼ cups. (special thanks to redneck gramma for calling Kraft to find out!) This cheesecake baked up perfectly and I did not top it with the nuts and caramel right away because sometimes I like plain cheesecake. When enjoyed plain, you can tell that it is a caramel cheesecake. The flavour is subtle yet noticeable and perfect on it's own. I added caramel and pecans to individual servings and wow, just looking at it was like eye candy - digging into it was heavenly! Thanks for the recipe. Delightful!

This is scrummy, the only change I made was to use liquid caramel topping, it stayed soft and creamy.

amazing recipe!!! We made it for mother's day and it was the perfect treat - a must-have for cheese cake lovers with a sweet tooth. The only thing was that the caramel on top hardened until it was like toffee, so I would suggest leaving it out for a bit before serving so the caramel is soft. I will be making this one again!

I always heard that making cheesecake was difficult, but after making this one, I guess I don't understand why.  Family and friends said I should sell it... it was that good.  It was my first ever try to, so it doesn't get much easier or better than that.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This cheesecake was yummy and extremely easy to make.  I made a mistake in measuring, so ended up having to double the recipe, which was actually a good thing because it was gone quickly when my husband brought it to work.  I ended up making a 9 X 13 inch rectangular pan and a 7 X 11 brownie pan.  They came out light and tasty.  I did use the melted caramels in the cake, but drizzled caramel sundae sauce over the top.

A winning recipe, for certain!  I made the recipe x 1-1/2 to serve more people and used an 11"x16" pan.  That said, it took an extra 20 minutes to cook (I did lower the temp to 325 for the last 10 minutes because I didn't want to burn the crust).  It was darker-tinted than the picture, but I think that it would have been darker anyway because of the caramel in the filling!  Delicious, people-raved and I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely perfect!  My husband ate 5 big pieces of this in one day!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used caramel ice cream topping instead of melting the leftover caramels... will definitely make again!

really tasty but crust was super dry. i left it that way though before baking because I assumed everyone else who reviewed this had it turn out ok. but nope, way too dry and started falling apart when serving. next time I'll add more butter to the crust. the filling was super good though. Definitely a tasty dessert that I could easily binge on for days..

These are yummy. I agree with the others who suggested using liquid caramel topping. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly & they are delicious!

These were a big hit at my job!! I got many compliments. I told the people that they are very rich to begin with but I had no one complain. I did what most reviewers said and only melted the 36 caramels in the mix and then I drizzled the top with Hershey's caramel ice cream topping the next day about an hour or so before serving.

I made these for my family for Thanksgiving. They were a huge hit. I did use the caramel sauce on top instead also.

Great recipe. My husband, who doesn't like cheesecake, even enjoyed this recipe. In addition, his co-workers continue to ask when he will be bringing more of these in.

I made this without the pecans or any nut as my hubby doesn't care for them.  It was still awesome!  I took the advice of others and used the caramel sundae topping instead.  Keep in mind that if you have a convection oven, you might want to back a few minutes off the original cooking time.  Mine cooked 12 minutes faster.  Awesome recipe!!!
