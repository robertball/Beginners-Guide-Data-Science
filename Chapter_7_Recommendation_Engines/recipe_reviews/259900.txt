This recipe almost makes it.  Add bacon Spam to your ground pork and you won't believe how good these will be.  Also, I use Savoy cabbage or Napa cabbage as it is sometimes called.  It is a little softer and more easily blended with the meat.  I also shred a bit of carrot for color.  If you use the Spam, you can leave out the egg.  I never use egg.  The spam holds it all together well.

These are delicious and I will be making them again. The only change I made was I added a small squeeze of honey to the dipping sauce.
