I did not put this in the oven...simply browned the chicken, took it out of the pan, made the sauce and then returned the chicken to the pan w/ the sauce to continue cooking.  I used a home-grown orange, so it was a little tart.  Thus, I added a little Splenda.  I would double the sauce next time to have enough to serve over rice.

This is the best recipe I have found on this site. My husband likes my cooking different recipes, but the kids make it difficult. I have two extremely picky children and they not only loved it, but requested it again this week. And as a bonus it prepares and cooks quickly so I can make when I get home from work with no preping the night before.

I doubled the cinnamon and added a couple TBSP of maple syrup as suggested by some of the other reviews and this dish turned out delicious. I think next time I'll try adding some raisins or prunes toward the end of baking.

Me and my little sister had this as the main dish for our parents on their anniversary and they really liked it. we didn't have oranges so we used orange peel seasoning instead and it turned out awesome.

Wow this is really good. I had a couple of oranges I needed to use up and wanted chicken so when I found this recipe I was happy :) The cinnamon was a nice addition to the chicken and I was happily surprised that my family really liked this, I wasn't sure they would. When I served it I poured the sauce in the bottom of the pan over the chicken to give it a little extra boost of flavor. Served with brown rice and baked apples. Thanks I'll be making this again!

I added extra Cinnamon as a suggestion by other members.  I notced adding more seems to thicken the sauce to much so then I had to add a bit more OJ.

The ending result was okay, but I still could not taste much of the cinnamon.  I may have to give this one another try. While the chicken was moist, the flavor just wasn't what I expected.

This was a hit. I did double the cinnamon and added maple syrup like others had suggested. In addition I also added a tsp of orange grind. My family loved it!

Didn't have enough flavor for us so I added a good splash of maple syrup and about a tsp of orange zest. Also only used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Served the sauce over rice, my hubby loved it.

This is a good recipe.  I made it tonight.  I can see how some might not like the taste of the cinnamon with the chicken, but both my husband and I thought it was good.  My 4 year old, who is a fairly adventurous eater (and who loves cinnamon), did not.  I liked the savory/richness quality it gave to boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I would make again.

I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe without any changes.  The sauce was fantastic.  I also made this dish for my 10 month old with all organic ingredients then chopped it up in the food processor and added some quinoa for added nutrition.  He loved it too!

OK flavor.  I used 1 Tbsp cinnamon per the other reviewer.  Next time I will try adding nutmeg and sugar to bring out more flavor.

This was very simple and very good. It needed a little something maybe a little maple syrup and a pinch of cayanne pepper to spice it up.  Definatly a dish you can play with depending on your taste.

I liked it & will definitely make it again. I also used more cinnamon-- I did a heaping tsp. I didn't have enough orange juice (I squeezed a orange for fresh juice) so I ended up adding some mango orange juice that I had on hand and I couldn't tell the difference. I would have maybe liked to double the sauce though for the rice, as others have done. Love how easy it was, & how few ingredients.

The sauce turned out a little goopey, there wasn't much flavor (and I even added the maple syrup and double the cinnamon). Certainly an easy dinner idea, but it would almost have been better to marinade the chicken in orange juice and cinnamon overnight.

i loved this!  The only changes i made was to use orange juice concentrate undiluted, i used a good 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup as i made a lot of sauce.  Will make this again.
