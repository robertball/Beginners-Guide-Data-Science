This was very easy and really good. My family enjoyed it. I did replace the lima beans with wax beans.

Good recipe with a few changes. Cut the sugar way down to a tablespoon with 1/2 cup white vinegar and a splash of balsamic. Used a good olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Couldn't find pimentos, so I subbed in chopped red pepper. Added a teaspoon of dried marjoram. Delicious!

I made this Bean Salad for our end of the year staff party - I love recipes that can be made in advance, kept in the fridge overnight, and transported easily to the party.  In fact, sitting overnight really helped the flavours to blend.  What a GREAT salad!!

Awesome salad!  I agree with other reviewers that it's okay to mix and match the veggies according to one's tastes.  I used this recipe as a jumping-off point for my own version, with green beans, wax beans, garbanzo beans, dark red kidney beans, and sliced beets.  For the dressing, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (I used "Sugar in the Raw"), and paired that with 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (for an extra kick).  I added minced garlic and fresh cracked black pepper before giving everything a toss.  This salad gets better with time, so if you can make it a couple hours before you want to serve it, the veggies will marinate in the dressing and it will taste amazing.

This bean salad was very good, fairly easy to prep, will keep forever in the frig. Kids had seconds. Thought it could stand a touch more vinegar flavor, maybe useing a stronger type of vinegar would do the trick. Will use this recipe again. Thanks Kathleen

A nice change from the three bean salad I always make.  The marinade is refreshing and tastey.  The lima beans add a touch to this salad. Keeps well in refrigerator - will make again. Mmm...

I thought it was to sweet. If I ever make again will not use as much sugar as recipe calls for.

This is the mosy delicious bean salad I've ever tasted! Plus it is quick, easy and inexpensive. Replaced the lima beans with butter beans and used red onion and raw sugar to make it a bit sweeter and it did the trick. Used fresh, steamed green beans instead of canned and tossed it straight from the steamer into the dressing - this helped to heat the sugar a bit to blend into the dressing more easily. Gorgeous! Cover the bowl with some cling film and it will help the absorbtion of the dressing. Just some caution: the dressing is quite acidic. Eat this salad with something starchy like pasta or panini to tone it down a notch.

This no-fuss recipe is a delightful dish to have "on hand".  Keeps well for several days -- a sweet-tart tang that lightens any meal.  Interesting textures add nice dimension.  Great as a side dish with salad for lunch or with a main course for dinner.

great taste...thought 1 cup of sugar was way too much so I only used half. Still came out great. The leftovers , I added quinoa and it made a filling lunch.

That recipe had sooo much sugar, I thought it must be some kind of dessert.  No wonder some people said their kids loved it!  You could hand it out for Halloween trick or treat candy.  Lower it to about a teaspoon or none at all...it is unnecessary.

Excellent.  Took to family gathering and even those who don't like "bean salad" asked for the recipe.

It needs more of a curry/chili flavour burst - is a little blegh without it.
