I added eggs to the mustard and garlic to dilute the mustard flavor. It worked wonderfully! I also didn’t use a baking rack in the oven. I laid the chicken strips flat on a baking sheet and baked them at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes (or until the chicken reached 165 degrees internally).

I made it and, unfortunately,  I listened to the early reviews about the over powering Dijon. Next time I will make it as directed without a cutback or dilution of the wet mixture. I will also add some dehydrated onions to the panko mix. A keeper for crispy chicken

Perfect! Follow exact directions. Do not add eggs! Egg addition is only for the unskilled cook :) Don’t be scared be CONFIDENT in your skill.

I Loved it!!  Kids loved it.  I made as directed.  I did have to cook a few minutes longer, but my chicken strips were fairly big.

Added an egg to the dijon/garlic mixture as suggested by other reviewers. BIG difference. Otherwise, the recipe is pretty good!

I was looking for a chicken strip recipe because I didn’t have one that didn’t have an Asian taste to it. This recipe was a great starting point for me.  I did make a few changes because the mustard was strong and I always add more seasoning to all my recipes.  For the wet mix I used the Dijon mustard & garlic but I also put about 1 1/2- 2 Tbl of honey in the mix to make it a little sweeter.  For the dry mix I used the oil but I don’t think it’s necessary so I will omit it next time. I added garlic powder, onion powder and a little parmesan cheese to the dry mix.  I baked the chicken on a cookie sheet wrapped in foil for easy clean up on 425 for the same amount of time (approx 12 mins).

The Dijon mustard was unbelievably overpowering in this dish. The panko breading was good, but all anyone could taste was salt and mustard.

We thought this was very good, and I'll make it again.  I used regular paprika and chicken tenders but otherwise followed a halved version of the recipe.  As it was I wasted maybe nearly 1/3 cup of the 1 cup of  panko mixture; it could be because there wasn't enough olive oil to make it moister, so keep that in mind.  The oven temperature and timing was about right.  Thanks for our dinner tonight!  We'll enjoy it again!
