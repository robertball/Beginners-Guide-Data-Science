I made this without the can of vegetables.  Just seemed too chunky with them ~ the 
pieces are so big.  This dip is good but is for onion-lovers.  Very strong onion flavor.

This was a little too bland for my taste.  Needs different veggies or something.

My mom made a similar recipe when I was a child. Now i am making it at home for my kids and they really love it! It is the perfect after school healthy snack. Also, I made it for a work party, and everyone agreed it was delicious!
