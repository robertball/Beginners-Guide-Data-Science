This is one of the best snacks I've ever eaten! I just have to keep it away from my huisband, or he would eat it all! However, I would like to mention one thing for other people who wish to attempt this recipe: Remember, the chocolate hardens very quickly, much like wax, so be sure that once you leave the chocolate standing and off the stove for 5 minutes or more, it will harden and you will need to heat it up again before you dip more fruit. Thanks!!

These are GREAT! Everyone likes choholate covered strawberries, but the dried apricots are equally wonderful! I also like to dip dried pineapple. Dip an assortment of dried fruits, allow them to dry and package as gifts for the holidays...everyone will go crazy! :)

This tasted good, but so much chocolate was wasted because it hardened to quickly and reheating didn't help.  I dipped dried apricots and fresh strawberries...delish!
