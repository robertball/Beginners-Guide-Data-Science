Instead of an italian dressing, I used a homemade Dorothy Lynch Style Salad dressing that I found on this site. I made no other changes. I made this the night before and portioned it out for lunches for my husband and I--we both really liked it. He asked me to make it again soon but to add chicken next time. This recipe's a keeper. REALLY good. NOTE: The longer it sits, the better it gets.

I love a good taco pasta salad. I made this, but instead of Italian dressing (I really dislike Italian dressing) I used sour cream mixed with a little milk. Otherwise I kept it the same. My 4 year old even loved it!

Not your typical rotini salad. A nice change of pace. Would be great for a Mexican potluck.

Made this the night before for a work lunch pot luck and it was super dry.  So the next time I made it I used 1-1 1/2 cups of Zesty Italian salad dressing.  I also doubled the onion and cheese.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.  I also omitted the green chilies because my kids don't like them and omitted the cilantro because I don't care for cilantro.  Overall a great recipe you can make tweak to make your own.

This is a wonderful recipe! I usually follow the recipe for the first time, then add my own touches to it later. This served as a perfect base recipe. Instead of a package taco seasoning I used a recipe here on allrecipes for the taco seasoning. I also used Queso fresco cheese instead of shredded. It turned out perfect for our Cinco de Mayo family dinner! This is a keeper

This is similar to some other recipes I have with pasta & beans. Hubby liked this a lot, but I'm not so sure because of dental work my taste buds aren't what they should be. I did fluctuate on the ingredients by using more yet not in proportion to number of servings. I did let the salad sit most of the day so flavors could blend. Will probably make again & then see which of the recipes that are like this is the best.

I used whole wheat rotini and made my dressing from olive oil, fresh squeezed lime juice and Mrs. Dash fiesta lime seasoning. I will definitely be making this again!

I think this would be good if you use store bought taco seasoning. My homemade is mild so it wasn't strong enough to match the Italian. I also used dried cilantro, fresh would have been perfect.

Nice flavor change from all the creamy pasta salads.  I used Wishbone Zesty Italian. Next time I'm going to try Olive Gardens Italian.  If you think you want to make it a meal you could easily add ground beef or chicken. Tasty!

I liked it and would make it again.  The ingredients complimented the rotini pasta nicely. It was a hit with my guests, and went nicely with a simple barbecue lunch of burgers and chicken sandwiches. I might add a bit more dressing next time, but that would be my only change.

This recipe is delicious!!! I could not find "Mexican corn" at the store I went to, however, a quick search showed all it is is regular can corn with red & green pepper. So instead of 1/2 cup red pepper (which was about half of the red pepper I'd purchased) I used the entire red pepper and added about a 1/3 cup of green pepper. I also added extra cheese.... (making for a pot luck and my coworkers are big cheese lovers).I also used plain colored noodles and it still looks beautiful. I couldn't be more pleased....absolutely delicious!!!! This is definitely going in the books for future cook out go-to recipe.

I think this is good. It goes with a Mexican meal.
People liked it. They aren't my flat ours so I can't say  great.
