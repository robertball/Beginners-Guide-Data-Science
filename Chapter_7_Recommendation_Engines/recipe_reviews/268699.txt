Hmmm. Made this exactly as written and while they tasted fine, they were not what I expected. For starters they never did get brown. I checked them at 10 minutes and they were not brown so I stuck them in for 5 more minutes. When I checked them at 10 minutes they were still balls. When I checked them at 15 minutes they were "cookies". They went from balls to flat discs somewhere in that 5 minute span. They still never browned.
