Delicious!  I was suspicious initially, but it was really good.  I used about 2T of ranch dressing instead of the mix.

I am not a big fan of cooked carrots, but these are sooo tasty. I recommend them and no changes are needed in the recipe.

These were good, but a little sugary I thought. I may reduce the sugar next time. I used one large bag of carrots, instead of bags of baby carrots. I also used one pack of lipton ranch dressing instead of two smaller ones. My husband loved them.

Combination of sugar and ranch dressing added a lot of zest to the usual vegetable course.

This was a very interesting recipe.... good combination, but I think i prefer just the sweet instead of the combo of that and the ranch.

Nope, nope, nope.  Followed recipe exactly.  The sweetness from the sugar combined with the tang of the salad dressing mix left a very artificial taste to the carrots.  Either use the brown sugar or use the ranch, but not both together.

I have always wanted to like carrots but never do.  The recipes that have honey or maple syrup are not for me. These were enjoyed by the entire family and is my new carrot recipe.

I just made this for a friend and I. Neither of us are big fans of glazed carrots, but this one sounded different. It is fabulous! The ranch dressing makes this really good - not too sweet. Will be making this for my family at Thanksgiving.

I just went with the brown suger and butter (didn't have any ranch dressing in the house.) So I cant speak to the outcome of the actual recipe with the ranch; but I can tell you the carrots were delicious with just the butter and brown sugar glaze.

I have used this recipe 3 times and it took me until the third time to get it right!  First of all, 1/2 cup of brown sugar is way too much.  The carrots taste way too sweet, so I halved it and used 1/4 cup which was perfect.  Also I never have those ranch packets on hand so I substituted 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing which worked out just the same.... cheaper than buying the packets and more convenient.  Overall, very good recipe, only I would recommend using less sugar!

I have to admit when I read this recpe my first reaction was "ick..brown sugar and ranch dressing?"  But I really wanted a new recipe for carrots so I gave it a try (I could always pop open a can of corn if necessary) and it turned out REALLY good!  My husband thought they were great too. Served them with roasted Cornish hens...yum.  The sweetness of the brown sugar and the tanginess of the ranch dressing is a good combination.  Will absolutely make this again.

Tasty!  Chopped large carrots into rounds with the food processor.  Used 1 package of dressing (not sure if it was ranch or dill) and added dill, salt and pepper.

Much to my surprise, my husband really liked these.  I will definately make again and may also use as a side dish for the holidays - they are not onl only nutritious but add oft needed color for a meal.  I was skeptical of the ranch dressing mix but it not only added an interesting taste difference, but added color.  Thanks for an interesting different way of serving carrots.

A little odd in concept, but really delicious in execution! It provided a tangy counterpoint to the mostly sweet sides with my Christmas dinner. I cut the brown sugar in half and didn't miss it - the dish would've been too sweet otherwise. The brown sugar, ranch and butter formed a weird clumpy mix when initially combined in the saucepan, but glazed beautifully when the carrots were added. A winner for sure!

Delicious! Made these for a large group and they were simple yet delicious. I was a little worried about the ranch and brown sugar flavor combination but was pleasantly suprised. I used half ranch dressing mix (dry) and half ranch salad dressing (wet) which made it a bit runnier. Definitely will be making this again.

This was delicious! I had some extra carrots from a different recipe, I cooked them until they were soft when I poked them with a fork (a bit longer than 10 minutes because I cooked them on lower heat). After draining, I put about 1/2 stick of butter and 3-4 spoonfuls of brown sugar. Then I squeezed some regular ranch dressing (probably equal to about 2 tablespoons) in there because I didn't have any packets. Fantastic!

I, like many, was skeptical, but the great reviews enticed me to try it out.  I halved the recipe and Wow!  So good!  It was a BIG hit at our Christmas dinner table.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I was excited to try this. But unfortunately I have to say it was terrible. My kids wouldn't eat this because it was too sweet. I tasted it and it was like eating a spoonful of sugar. Sorry.

I made this recipe with garden carrots so I am not sure if I used two pounds or not. It was really good, even my kids liked it. But, next time I think I will only use half the sauce because it was a little strong. I will be making it again though.

Good! I wanted something besides regular steamed veggies. This is good, tasted like a fancy restaurant side dish. go easy on the seasonings though, it is pretty powerful.

I was so excited to try this recipe. I used fresh baby carrots and I thought it was just ok. Easy, but not as good as some other carrots recipes I have tried.

Curiosity FORCED me to try this recipe, and I am so glad I did, it was really good !!!  I used the splenda brown sugar mix and only one package of salad dressing mix.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy for our taste.  Thank you for a very simple and delicious side dish.  It shows up at least once a week now at our house.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I triple checked the measurements and had my daughter check them too!  The glaze came out stiff and didn't blend with the butter at all.  We ended up just eating the carrots with a little brown sugar sprinkled over them.

The "glaze" was more of a sauce which worked just fine.  The carrots were a side dish to rib steak and glaze/sauce was excellent to dip the steak in.

I have never found a recipe that has made me like carrots, however this recipe at least made me want to try them! They still tasted like carrots to me, but everyone else at the table loved them! I have made this recipe several times and I think it is perfect as is.

These were quite good...  I took the advice of another rater and added less brown sugar, but I wish I would have added more ranch.  They were still a little too sweet.

Maybe just a little TOO flavorful for my taste, but not bad. I think I'll just stick to honey or brown sugar when I glaze my carrots.

I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone really liked it.  I couldn't find the ranch salad dressing mix so I used creamy dill and it was really good.  I will make this again.  It's a change from plain old boiled carrots.

surprisingly yummy!!  I never would have thought that adding Ranch mix to sugar and butter would be great.  The changes that I made were adding brussel sprouts and juice and zest from 1/4 orange.  Subtle enough to make you go "huh?!".  I will definately make again!

I wasn't sure how the ranch would taste, but it came out wonderful.  The whole family loved it.  Even my 17 year old daughter who normally doesn't like carrots!!  We will be having this again.

Carrots prepared this way are SO tasty. My family really enjoyed them, and we now make this a part of our fare.
