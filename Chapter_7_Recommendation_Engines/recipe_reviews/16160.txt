A new family favorite! I let the chicken breasts soak while I heated up the grill - about 5 minutes - then seasoned with garlic powder, seasoned salt and Italian herb seasoning. I turned the heat down to medium low and cooked them "low and slow" - about 6 minutes on one side, 10 minutes on the other. When I turned the breasts, I put a pat of butter on each to keep things moist. The results were outstanding. Nothing plain or run-of-the-mill about it! The ckicken was bursting with flavor - you could taste the lemon juice as well as the seasonings. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the amount of chicken cooked. My husband is disappointed there isn't more for leftovers!

My family really enjoyed this. I put the ingredients in my frozen bag of chicken and let it marinate while it was thawing.  Next time I would add seasoned pepper and maybe some garlic. Very good.

Simple to make. I combined the dry ingredients with the juice of 2 lemons and OLIVE OIL and marinated the chicken for about 15 minutes prior to grilling.  The chicken was moist with a mild lemon flavor.  Will make again.

I made this twice this summer: The first time, we could hardly tase any "lemon." The second time, I poked a couple holes in the chicken with my knife and let it sit in the lemon juice mix for apprx 5 min.  I then added some lemon pepper seasoning. Much better, and had a nice, light lemon flavor.

Good, simple recipe.  The chicken was moist.  Grill Mates Montreal Seasoning by McCormick could be substituted for the seasoned salt.  This is a recipe that allows for changes according to personal tastes.

Soooo easy and soooo good.  My two year old said it was delicious and it even pleased the picky husband and twelve year old.  I used Lawry's for seasoning salt and cubed the chicken for kabobs.  It was very moist and had great flavor. I have already passed it along to friends and family.

I WILL make this again and again, mostly due to the fact that *ALL* my family liked AND I liked it's simplicity. (If you don't over-cook) the chicken is very juicy with a nice, fresh,lightly-spicy flavor, that is EXCEPTIONAL cut up (or I sometimes make with chicken tenders)on lettuce greens with a creamy dressing. Thank you, Jenny for the quick, healthy and "popular" recipe! I can always use recipes like this!

I liked this recipe, over other easy to prepare chicken recipes, because the preprep was so easy. I like chicken a little spicier and instead of lemon juice, I rubbed in a prepared lemon pepper spice in a jar. It tasted great and I will use again.

This dish was AMAZING!! and I didn't even grill it the chicken turned out just right and juicy in the middle. I put it in the oven for25 mins on 350. I kept the remaining lemon juice and once the chicken was done drizzled some on top. I definately will be making this again.

This is a quick and easy marinade that really helps to keep the chicken moist.  It had a nice light, lemony taste.  I used Greek seasoning in place of the seasoned salt.

The chicken came out OK, but I wasn't crazy about the mix of seasonings.  I wasn't sure what was meant by "seasoning salt."  I used Mrs. Dash.  If I try it again, I'll definitely add some real salt! :)

I think this was pretty good. I loved that it actually had flavor. I like my chicken on the salty side, so I added a bit more seasoned salt. I also grilled this on my george foreman grill...came out great! Topped it w/ mushrooms & onions. :)

These turned out tasty and juicy! I used a tip by another reviewer and used this as a marinade (added 1/2 C olive oil) while grill warmed up, about 10 minutes. Pounded the thicker parts, and cooked using indirect heat 6-8 mins per side, then directly over coals to brown 2-3 mins per side. Super super deelish. Thanks!

A good, easy recipe for chicken. I like that it doesn't have garlic in it, except in the seasoning salt. It is possible to get seasoning salts without garlic, but one must hunt them down. If you decide to marinate this, remember that lemon will start to partially cook the chicken. This happens with fish, too, when lemon is used to marinate.

Best part - IT WAS SO EASY! And we had ALL the ingredients already in the house~!  Instant favorite. Poke holes in chicken for lemon juice to saturate. Add a little lemon pepper and chopped garlic or a dash of garlic salt. It was unbelievably delicious - this is my first review of a product, I liked it so much I had to write a review!

Made this for Labor Day at our annual family gathering, went by directions exaxtly, I don't feel as though you can truly rate a recipe unless you first make it like it says, I used bottled lemom juice which did just fine the chicken was tender and you could really taste the lemon. Now that I have made the original recipe, this is what I would do the next time I make this I would add some garlic (fresh Minced) the recipe does not say how much seasoning salt but I would use 1 teaspoon. Everyone liked my chicken will make again.

Great Flavor and Easy to make!! My friend who never likes chicken (cuz its to blah for him) had 2 chicken breasts!! This is also very healthy, so perfect for losing those holiday pounds! I would highly recommend making this recipe...Oh..marinate for about a half hour to an hour (depending on how much flavor you want) and poke the chicken breasts so the marinade can soak in..Enjoy!

Very tasty.  My only modification was to marinate the chicken for 40 minutes.  I cooked mine in the George Foreman.  It turned out great.

Very good.  The butter that Trinka G recommended made a huge difference.  I used ground pepper, Italian seasoning, and some other all-purpose seasoning from a local source.  Again, the pats of butter made a HUGE difference.  Loved it and my family loved it.

Amazing.  I threw it all together in a zip lock bag and marinated the chicken as it defrosted. I then made another batch of just the dry spice, husband added red pepper flakes, garlic powder and chili when my back was turned. well I sprinkled the spice on the chicken as it cooked on the foreman grill for 8 minutes.  Amazing, tender and juicy. Thanks!

Bright and refreshing.  This chicken recipe bursts with flavor and is very easy to put together.  The lemon just brings such a delicious zing.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's become a 'go to' for me.

This is one of the best chicken recipes!  I used garlic powder instead of onion and grilled the chicken on the BBQ.  It was so moist and flavorful, my guests were very impressed!

I ended up letting the seasoned chicken rest overnight in the fridge before cooking it because my husband chickened out (pun intended) about cooking on the grill.  It cooked up great and very yummy!

This comes out just great everytime I make it. You can use any seasonings just so long as  you use the lemon (or lime) juice it will be moist and tender. Definently a favorite in my home.

Execellent recipe!  I used Lemon Juice concentrate and soak the breasts in it while heating the grill.... I used a George Foreman grill and it took about 6 minutes to cook!  My family loved them!

Excellent! I don't give a lot of 5 star ratings, but this passed the in-law test! My mother in-law is a great southern cook. I have to come up with recipes that she doesn't cook so that I don't feel like my dish is being compared to hers. I followed this just as the recipe calls, and everyone raved about it. Trust me, in the south, we have hospitality and charm, but don't be deceived we say what's on our mind when it comes to food. From that day forward, when I have grilled chicken, this is how I do it. It's a hit every time!

After reading the reviews and the recipe I thought this would be bland to our taste, so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup soy sauce, also added some garlic powder and Greek seasoning.  Seemed to be the right amount of seasonings for us.

Like others, I cut WAY back on the LEMON juice. For (2 Large) breasts I used about 2-3 TBS Lemon.  After adding some parsley, fresh ground Pepper, some Mrs Dash 'Table Blend', Garlic Powder and Minced Onions (did not onion powder), I still found it TOO lemon-y.  I added more Garlic and about 1 TBS Minced Onion.  The mixture thickend nicely.  Dipped chicken and let it sit for about 30 mins.  Too Cold outside, used Med-Hi heat in a very LIGHTLY oiled pan.  The chicken BROWNED Beautifully and the extra onions carmelized.  SUPER Jucicy with a hint of LEMON... THanks

This recipe is great, and SO easy! I think the spices are just perfect, and the chicken was so moist! I didn't use parsley, just because I didn't have any, and, I did it on a George Foreman Grill (took about 5 minutes per breast). My husband doesn't like chicken, but really liked this stuff!! Will definitely make this again!

I am always looking for different recipes to prepare chicken breast since we eat so much of it.
This recipe was quick and easy, plus I love using the grill to prepare chicken breast.

Maybe it's because I froze the chicken in the marinade before I thawed/grilled it, but it was WAY too lemony for my taste.  

It did keep the chicken very moist, and I will probably just use the leftovers on top of salad tomorrow for lunch, but unfortunately not a hit at my house!

I made this recipe judging by the rave reviews. I don't know if my expectations were too high, but I wasn't "wowed" by this recipe. It was just OK and not very flavourful.

loved the flavor of this dish. Just enough lemon to give it a fresh clean taste, and so easy. I let it marinate in refrigerator for several hours.  Will definitely make again!

I'm sorry but this wasn't good. I followed recipe exactly as written. I even undergrilled it a tad & it was so dry & overall flavor was pure lemon. I won't make this again.

I saturated the chicken breasts in the lemon juice and unfortunately the lemon flavor was too over powering.  Not a big fan of lemon so I think I'll skip the lemon altogether next time and just stick to the seasoning.

Great recipe, my only changes were to use orange juice instead, and I used a teaspoon each of parsley and dried cilantro. My wife loved it, and even raved on it the next day. Thanks, Jenny!

I cut the chicken into cubes and marinated in lemon juice for an hour before cooking it in a pan with some olive oil.  I put in extra seasonings and it came out amazing.  VERY lemony - so if you don't like the extra lemon flavor consider not doing the marinade!

Super juicy, nice and light. I pierced the breasts and let them soak in the lemon juice for about 5 minutes before grilling. I also added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and basted the chicken with the lemon juice while grilling.

Excellent! Made exactly as directed except didn't need to grill them nearly as long as instructions state.  Only about 6 mins/side on the "low and slow" mode.  Very juicy and tasty.  Will make these often. Thanks!

Outstanding! I thought the chicken tasted great. Although I didnt have onion powder on hand , I used garlic powder. Also, I started cooking on the George Foreman grill w/ the lid UP but the chicken breasts were too thick so I put them in the oven to bake after my first attempt. Still came out good next time Ill hammer the chickens thinner so I can grill it the whole time.

This was great, I actually went out to get all the ingredients and found Safeway had a Lemond Garlic Marinade that pretty much matched the ingredients and saved me some time.

This was a solid recipe which I will use again. I added lemon pepper seasoning, a few shakes of pepper flakes, and a dash of EVOO. It marinated for an hour before going on the grill. It had the perfect lemon flavoring and was moist. I served it with a side of jambalaya seasoned rice.

loved this. Make sure to not marinade the chicken longer than half an hour or so or it will have way to much lemon.

very good! tender and tasty! Used fresh lime juice and had to forego the onion powder because didn't have any. Let it marinade for about 10 minutes before cooking. definitely will use it again, maybe with longer marinade time in the fridge + the onion powder. Definitely would recommend trying the lime!!!

I chose to make a marinade out of the ingredients.  I doubled the dried parsley and used 2 teaspoons of seasoning salt.  I pounded the breasts down, placed them in a Ziplock with the marindade, and left them in the fridge for about 6 hours.  The lemon flavor was fresh and intense.

Easy dinner.  Very nice flavor.  I baked these, covered at 350*, for 30 min. and then uncovered a few minutes more until done.  The chicken was very moist and everyone enjoyed it!

I found that this recipe made the chicken breasts a little dry and the combination of spices made it very salty.  The recipe calls for the breasts to be grilled 10 to 15 minutes per side and that was way too long as the chicken ended up overcooked and dried out.  I suggest cooking about 6 minutes per side so that the chicken is cooked through but is juicy. I served it with a fresh mango salsa and that made all the difference. Not sure I would make this again.

Great chicken to fix when you don't have time to
marinate.  I used ReaLemon,  and Lawry's for the
seasoned salt and the flavor was awesome.

I have already used this recipe twice. The first time I thought it was just a tad lemony, so the next time I used Jose Cuervo margarita mix instead of the lemon juice. Much better!

My husband likes to take credit for all of the grill creations.  But, truthfully, I do all the prep and seasoning as he is getting the grill ready.  This "marinade" works wonders in the few minutes time it takes. Juicy, tender and flavorful - try it on grilled split fryers, or other cut up chicken parts.

This recipe was so simple, yet fabulous !!  I used boneless/skinless thighs, let them marinate in the lemon juice for about 10 min or so while I prepared the grill and got the rest of the dinner started.  Then I put them on the grill,sprinkled them with McCormick Montreal Seasoning as HEYPAULA53 suggested and they turned out SO GOOD!  Only thing I would have changed was to make more !  No leftovers at all !! Thanks so much Jenny

Chicken came out tasty and juicy!  I didn't have lemons or parsley so I used limes and rosemary instead and added a little red pepper flakes for a little kick! Delicious! And the chicken picked up a lot of lime flavor just by dipping the chicken in the juice as the recipe says.  Thanks!

Fabulous! I thought the breasts would be dry, but they were wonderfully moist. Per previous reviews, I added garlic powder to the ingredients listed; cooked them for 7 minutes on one side and 5 on the other over medium heat.  So fast, easy, and delicious!

This is the best basic grilled chicken recipe!  Love , love, love it.  My kids think it's "delicious"!  I leave it in the lemon juice for maybe 10 min, to get more of the lemon flavor infused into the chicken.  I also bake it in the oven for about 20-30 minutes, then finish it on the grill.  This way it turns out juicy every time (I have a habit of drying out my chicken on the grill)!  So good in salads too! Thanks Jenny!!

Very Good Recipe!  I didn't have enough lemon juice so I used 1/4 Cup Lemon Juice and 1/4 Cup White Wine.  It seemed to level out the lemon taste and it turned out really well.

This was just okay to me made as written. The chicken was really moist, but little to no lemon flavor at all. If i make again, i will let the chicken marinade in the lemon juice for awhile as other posters have written

Used McCormick Grill Mates chicken rub, let the chicken marinade in the lemon juice/olive oil for about 15 minutes.  Will use this frequently for grilling chicken.  Very juicy and tasty.

This was wonderful, however I did add Meyer Lemon infused Olive Oil to the marinade.  The chicken was moist, flavorful, and had just the right hint of a lemon accent.  It paired prefectly with a mixed field greens salad for a light and healthy quick fix dinner.

Made this last night for family & friends.  One of the easiest and best recipes I've found.  I used fresh chicken breasts.  They were so juicy one guest squirted herself in the eye when she cut into her serving.

I too, added olive oil and galic salt.  I let it marinade for about 5 min before putting it on, since I had to have dinner in a pinch.  Turned out great!  Very tender.  Next time I'll let it sit for about 15min. and add more seasoned salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe often in the summer.  I use split chicken breast and marinate the chicken overnight. I also use fresh garlic (2-3 cloves) and rub it all over the chicken (under the skin too).  The meat is so juicy and the flavor is terrific!

i usually marinate in Italian dressing, but decided to try this easy recipe instead. My family loved it! I didn't have any onion powder, but substitued garlic powder and used Ms. Dash seasoning for chicken. I also marinated frozen chicken for several hours until thawed. Very moist and excellent flavor!

I took the advice of others and let the chicken sit in the lemon juice for a few hours after pounding it. I also added garlic powder to the seasoning. WARNING: If you are using a George Foreman grill, do NOT cook the chicken more than 4-5 minutes per side! I made this mistake for the first two pieces and luckily became wiser for the rest of it. It came out tender with a very fresh taste.

I found the lemon juice to be a great addition to the chicken breasts on the grill.  I think I could change the spices a bit, but the lemon juice base was great.

I dipped 4 pieces of chicken breast in 1/2 cup lemon juice and then sprinkled each with garlic powder, ground black pepper (only on 1 side), Lawry's seasoning salt, and Italian seasoning.  Then I grilled the chicken!  So good!

This was quick and simple and very moist, although the flavor was good, it didn't wow me. If your using large chicken breasts and cooking on the foreman, make sure to slice them in half or butterfly them. It took way to long for the middle to cook and the parsley was almost burnt on the outside. This was light and healthy. Boyfriend loved it, I thought it was alright, but I'm more difficult to please. No need to keep leftovers because they were way too dry, but fine if u eat them when made!

Excellent...I added some chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  I also pierced the chicken with a knife before marinating so the juices could soak in.  I marinated about an hour.  Very flavorful.

Omg this was soooo good and healthy. We marinated the chicken the same way and cooked it over stove top. The chicken was juicy and just yummy. 5 stars all the way :)

Soooo easy, and so good! I used garlic powder instead of onion, and Herbes de Provence instead of Parsley - amazing! My 5 year old had seconds and didn't even ask for barbecue sauce, which is huge for her (she has to have sauce with everything). Chicken was moist, and the lemon juice paired perfectly with the seasonings. I will definitely be making this again!

I made chicken tenders with this recipe they were amazing! I made them on a George Foreman grill. I cooked 6 , two at a time in 9 minutes! They had a bit of a kick to them but i coated each chicken strip with the onion powder after dipping them in lemon juice then i generously applied pepper to them added regular table salt then generously added the parsley. These chicken strips were excellent but the lemon taste was almost non existent. I'm defiantly going to marinate the chicken in the lemon for a bit before i make them again.

These are just wonderful, and super easy! I added a little bit of white wine to the lemon juice (that I halved), a little bit of chopped garlic to the chicken breast before hand, and dry parsley, oregano, black pepper and salt for seasoning. It tastes out of this world!!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was delicious and easy to make. One modification is that I marinated the chicken in the lemon-juice mixture for about 30 minutes. I also followed the advice of one of the reviewers who suggested poking holes in the chicken to let the flavor of the lemon-juice mixture penetrate.

Great recipe! I uses the leftover juice to baste the chicken while it was on the grill. It came out moist and full of flavor. I will definitely fix this again!

Overall, it was good. I just drizzled lemon juice while on the grill, and overcooked a little but some bbq sauce fixed it right up. I got a lot of positive feedback at the dinner table.

Excellent yet simple recipe. The lemon juice doesn't take over - it complements the grilled flavour nicely. I tried this with chopped rosemary and it was incredible. Truly, you could use any fresh herb. We sliced this over a spaghetti pomodoro - fab!

Great Dish! Due to the reviews I did prick the chicken with fork and marinaded the chicken in lemon juice for 30 minutes. Cilantro was on sale at the store so I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley but I bet any herb would go well with this dish. Cilantro chicken was great but looking forward to trying others. I will use this recipe again.

i used some fresh lime juice, mixed with bottled lemon juice. this was easy to make. it wasn't super flavorful, but good enough to make again. some of my kids really liked it and my husband thought it was pretty good. great for when you have nothing planned for dinner, since all the ingredients are common pantry items.

Loved it!  I don't like having to season "to taste" but I did pretty good this time.  I only had 2 chicken breasts and made all the seasoning, so maybe it was more flavorful than others' were.

Delicious!  I used chicken cutlets (boneless breasts pre-flattened to a thin, even size), added some lemon zest, olive oil and Montreal Chicken seasoning to the fresh juice, onion powder and white pepper.  It was perfect--moist with a delicious, subtle lemon seasoned flavor.  I'm always looking for easy grill ideas and will make this again.  Of course, my husband takes credit for his perfect grilling skills! :)

This recipe is simple and delicious.  For the most lemon flavor, prepare the chicken just before cooking.  We serve frequently with green beans, carrots and potaotoes sauted in Italian dressing for a very quick meal.

Delish and Easy (my 2 favorite things when it comes to cooking)!  Chicken was moist.  I marinated for 30 min in sauce as many others suggested.

I marinaded it in the lemon juice for 5-10 minutes, and it did have a good lemon flavor, but was a little too bland for my tastes.

My family LOVED it!  I followed the recipe exactly, but let the coated chicken rest in the fridge for a couple of hours before grilling.  The lemony flavor really came through, and even my kids gobbled it up.  I tried it again, without letting it rest, and couldn't taste the lemon very much at all.

So easy and yummy!  I poked holes in the breasts and let them marinade in a little EVOO & the juice from 2 lemons while the grill was warming up.  I combined the dry ingredients along with a little garlic powder and sprinkled on the breast just prior to grilling.  Wonderful light flavor.

I made this over the weekend and it was delicious.  I put all the ingredients (except the chicken) plus a 1/4 cup of olive oil in a blender in a blender for about 4 min as one reviewer suggested. Then I marinated the chicken in a ziplock bag for about an hour, then grilled the chicken per the recipe and it came out moist and flavorful.  I can't wait for my chicken sandwich for lunch today.  I will make this again!

I really didn't care for this at all.  All I could really taste was lemon.  It needed more spices in my opinion.

This was easy and quick but lacked flavor. Maybe, I'll try more season salt next time. The lemon flavor was nice. I soaked mine while waiting for the grill to heat up.

Easy marinade to remember, not much to it. The lemon gave this a nice twang, but really didn't penetrate the meat. Thanks.

My husband and I agreed that this was plain, but deliciously plain!  It was refreshing to have chicken that wasn't doused in a marinade or sauce.  I took another reviewer's advice and added olive oil to the lemon juice and herbs.  I also let the chicken marinate for about half an hour.

This was just ok. But I think it was my fault.  I left the chicken in the lemon juice and spices for about 20 minutes before cooking.  It was just too bland for my taste.  The kids had to dip it in barbeque sauce.

Bland. This is a 3.5 for us. This will need some jazzing up or marinating before I would make again.

This was a great fast and easy recipe.  I doubled the lemon juice like some other people suggested and I didn't measure the seasoning I just put them on straight from the bottle.  It was great! Very flavorful.

Quick and easy...I was planning on grilling this outside but thunderstorms and lightning prevented that!  So, I used the George Forman instead.  I think this would be better on a real grill, but it was yummy and I served it Zucchini Saute from this site and Cheddar Jalepeno Bread.  It was a great, healthy meal!  :o)

I thought this had a nice, subtle flavor.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because my husband complained that it was dry and flavorless.  I cooked it on the Foreman grill, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the dryness.

A new family favorite! I substituted the lemon for lime since that's what I had on hand. I also added Italian seasoning and olive oil. Marinated all ingredients with chicken about 15 minutes prior to grilling. Awesome! My husband and kids loved it!

Unless you like bland then you might like it as is.   Maybe add a nice butter lemon sauce if you serve as an entree.

It's not a very strong, flavourful recipe. But it is still very good. I cooked an extra breast and cut it up for a Caesar salad. I cooked it on the stove top to keep it very moist. Maybe that's why I didn't like it as a main dish. Will probably make this again for ingredients to another dish

I trippled the recipe and the lemon didn't permeate like the reviews said - next time I'll place the chicken in a shallow dish so they're not stacked.  Also, could use a little more seasoning - little more garlic, maybe some thyme.

This is probably the best chicken marinade I've used...it "brightens" the chicken so that it tastes mild but flavorful and makes even skinless chicken breasts moist... Leftover chicken is perfect to add to salad or other recipes that call for cooked chicken.  I use about 1Tbl of olive oil to 2 lemons and use onion and garlic powder...I also put the marinate the breasts about 15-30 minutes before grilling... Typically we use an I door grill

My family loved it.  I also poked some holes in the chicken and I let it marinate for just 10 minutes and then cooked it on the grill.  My parents absolutely loved it!!

This was quick, easy and really tasty. Husband and 4, 3, and 1 year old all loved it. This is great for nights when I don't have time (or forget to) marinate.

This is one of the most useful recipes I've found. It's so easy to throw together and tastes great every time.  I love the leftovers, as suggested, in a salad the next day with a simple balsamic/olive oil dressing. Thank you!

We did not find that this recipe had a strong lemony flavor, which we would have preferred, but it was a nice light flavor. I did not taste the parsley at all which makes me think I probably could've saved 2 teaspoons of my money on that one. Thanks for sharing!

The chicken was very juicy, but I think I'll adjust the spices a little next time.  I like a stronger taste, but it was still very good.

Great recipe!!! It is rare for my recipes to be good on the first time, let alone turn out above and beyond my expectations! We just finished dinner and I had to return to rate it 5 stars! The chicken was juicy and although the recipe is simple the taste is anything but! This is going to be one of my go-to recipes! Only thing I did different was cut chicken into medallions, and cooked it in a skillet with a few tbsp of butter but only because I didn't grill it in the grill. Deeeeeelish!!!

This was pretty good.  I think it may have been better if I had used a better season salt.  It wasn't one of those "wow this is delicious" dinners.  But it wasn't too bad.  I will try to make it again with a different season salt and see how it turns out.  All in all, it is a healthy dinner that tastes good.

Delicious! I used a little EVOO in the lemon juice marinade, poked holes in the chicken and let it sit about 15 minutes before grilling, flipping it over twice. I seasoned with dried oregano, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper. My grill ran out of gas before it was finished, so I put them in the micro for a couple of minutes and they were still plenty juicy!

This recipe was a hit with the family today!  I am such a novice at cooking and it was so simple.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I added garlic powder and seasoned salt to it due to other reviews and it was great! Very tender and definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

I have used this recipe for a few years now and always enjoy how moist and juicy the chicken comes out!  Plus, it is SO simply and easy, just the thing for a quick supper during the summer when it's too hot to cook inside!!  I wouldn't changed anything about this recipe.

This was so great.  I often forget to marinade so this one was handy for me.  I was afraid that you wouldn't be able to taste the lemon flavor but it was perfect.  The spice combination was good. The only "change" to the recipe that I made was I didn't measure the onion pwd or parsley I just sprinkled the meat.  Also, I had a 1/2 a lime to use up so I used part lime juice and part lemon juice. YUMMY. We'll definitely use it again.  This time we grilled it, sliced it & had it in burritos.

Great!!!!  Of course, I didn't have have the lemon juice, but I did have True Lemon.  I substituted 6 packs of True Lemon (1 packet = 1 lemon wedge) and used olive oil.  Instead of parsley I used Penzey's Parisienne Bonne Herb (hope that's the spelling). Otherwise, no substitutions and it was quick, easy and TASTY.  Two thumbs up!

This was fair.  I did not taste the lemon at all.  I let it sit in the lemon for 10-15 min. prior to grilling & really hoped it would taste lemony but it didn't happen.  :(

I made this for the first time tonight. I let the chicken breast marinade for about one hour and then grilled over charcoal. Served with twice baked potatoes and green beans. I will be making this again. Thanks Jenny.

This was an overall good recipe if you like a strong lemon flavor.  I did soak it in the lemon juice for about 15 minutes and it was just a little too strong of a lemom taste for me and my husband didn't really care for it at all.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

My husband loved it and so did I.  The spices were perfect. I drizzled a little olive oil over it before serving.  Also, I did not need to barbeque for as long as the recipe said but we have a gas barbeque which may have made a difference.  Thank you so much.

This was a surprisingly tasty marinade given how simple it is.  I added a little bit of olive oil and let the chicken soak for about 1/2 hour before we put it on the grill.  I used Lawry's seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to season.  Yummy over a salad!  We will be making this again.  It's a great marinade when you realize an hour before dinner that you want grilled chicken but didn't marinate any until now.  Not a lot of time needed for this one!

loved this chicken on a salad.  Great mild flavor.  I'm more of a 4.5 stars on this one. Needs a little more kick to stand alone.

This was very good. It was a welcome change from the same old barbeque sauce. I just get so sick of that in summer. Thanks for a great combination of spices! I didn't have Seasoned Salt so I used a basic chicken rub instead. It turned out great!

I made this recipe tonight and it was absolutely delicious!!!  It was so moist and juicy.  I did add a little bit of minced garlic to it also.  It was a fantastic addition to a Ceasar salad.  My husband, who's not much of a chicken eater, loved it!!!

The chicken was very easy to prepare and grill. There was a subtle taste of lemon, but I thought the chicken was overwhelmed by the parsley. I would add less next time.

Good flavor but I wasn't overwhelmed by this. Used oregano instead of parsley and added garlic powder. I also soaked the chicken breasts in the lemon juice for a few minutes before pouring off. The chicken was dry and could use some olive oil but that wouldn't make it low calorie. On the positive side, this would be tasty on a salad.

What a delicious twist on chicken.  I have used this many times in the last 9 months, since finding it.  I share it with anyone who will listen.  When I have no lemon juice, I substitute margarita mix and it is still wonderful.  It is a great summer recipe, but I also use in in the winter in my Foreman rotisserie.  You have to try it.  Thank you Jenny!!!!!

Great chicken recipe.  Simple to make with common ingredients.  Chicken stayed very moist and flavor was excellent.  I will try it with fresh spices next time for added flavor.

Great! I doubled the recipe, with about 15 chicken thighs. Added 1 tablespoon minced garlic. The winning element of this chicken was by far the tangy lemon flavor. Soaked in lemon juice for 15 minutes.

I made this but ended up changing it slightly. I left the onion powder out and added Italian seasoning. I also added a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil. I put all ingredients into a bag then added chicken tenderloins. The chicken sat in the marinade while the oven was preheating. We’ve been grilling a lot lately so we decided we wanted these in the oven. I cooked the tenders at 350 for 30 minutes on a silicone mat. They were delicious! Cooked just right and very juicy. The lemon flavor really came through! The parsley is a bit heavy so I’ll probably use half of that next time. This is a really good and healthy entree!

Everyone loved this, and it was so easy to put together!  I just added all the ingredients to the lemon juice, and then marinated the chicken in a gallon zip lock bag for two hours.

Very delicious! !  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice for a few hours.  Once out of the fridge I seasoned the chicken with a similar line up that was suggested .  I had chicken tender type chicken so I cooked about 3-4 min per side covered.  Would make again

Excellent. I was prepared to deem this as "lacks flavor" because the ingredients and prep just seemed too simple and easy to be tasty.  But I was very wrong.  It was excellent.  I wouldn't change a thing, this is perfect.

I used this as the chicken on a grilled chicken ceasar salad. WOrked out great. My husband cleaned his plate with nothing left. I really like the lemon dip before seasoning. I can make this with whatever is in the spice cabinet. Simple, Easy, Awesome!

Really easy and tasty, even my 9 year old was asking to try it, foregoing her mac n cheese. Paired well with "Skewered Grilled Potatoes" for an all on the grill meal that was pretty fast and used mostly pantry items. Only mod was I used tenders as my wife likes them better. Pellet grill was set to 425, cooked about  5 mins per side until IT was 150, then put on the cold side while potatoes finished.

Not much flavor. Maybe soaking in lemon juice instead of dipping would be better. Would probably add more spice as well.

Used less lemon juice (only juice of one lemon), mixed all ingredients and marinated chicken for a few hours before searing in a cast iron skillet and finishing in the oven. They were delicious.  Glad I used less lemon when marinating as the lemon taste was enough.  Great easy recipe.

This made the best and juicest chicken breast we have had in a long time. I took the advice of one other respondee  and added a pat of butter on after it was turned over. I have copied this recipe and added it to my personal cook book.

Simple and delicious. 
As others suggested, after pounding the chicken so that it was all  consistent thickness, I marinated the chicken in the lemon juice while the grill heated up. I added the herbs right before grilling. It’s perfect.

Dang Jenny.... this is a great chicken breast recipe! Quick-and-easy dinner recipe and pretty healthy, even if you follow the "add a pat of butter" tip from the top review (which i do). This is my go-to weeknight dinner meal that's easy to dress up with sides or enjoy as a solo entree. My greatest thanks to you, Jenny English.

Delicious and juicy. I added some thyme and rosemary to the lemon juice n spice mix and let it soak for 10 mins, seasoned with salt/pepper while on the grill, and brushed on some olive oil a few minutes before taking off. Went perfectly with a linguine aglio e olio.

I put the chicken, lemon juice and seasoning in a ziploc bag and let it marinate while getting the grill ready. For seasoning I used minced garlic, Greek seasoning and pepper. Very easy and tasty!

This was surprisingly flavorful for  the simplicity of the ingredients and ease of prep.  I followed a few of the recommendations that seemed to work well.  I let the chicken marinate in the lemon juice for 5 min and I used Italian Seasoning instead of parsley.    Everything else was done by the recipe.  It was also very juicy, but that may have been due to the new grill I got which uses indirect heat.

So simple but so tasty. Not even missing a sauce or gravy that I would normally prefer to eat with my chicken breast. And for those of you participating in Weight Watchers, this is only 2 Smart Points. I did, however, let the chicken marinade for a good hour before we grilled this and I used the juice from 1/2 a lemon, and I also added a little bit of garlic powder.

All of us loved this recipe! I used lime juice instead of lemon because it's what I had, and it was fine. Btw, I was afraid the dried parsley would add a dried leaf texture (LOL), but it didn't. I did season the chicken and let it sit for about 30 minutes while I made everything else. I don't know if that helped or not, but regardless, it was delicious and moist!

I added a little fresh rosemary and a combination of garlic salt and seasoning salt and it came out juicy and delicious! This recipe is the perfect recipe for the grilled chicken on top of a bed of greens.

Loved this!  I used fresh parsley instead of dried, but otherwise faithfully followed the recipe.  The lemon presence was subtle but significant.  My only issue was overcooking the chicken on the grill - user error.

Have made it twice now, and enjoyed it both times. The only problem we've had is that even at medium-low on the grill, the times listed tends to overcook the meat. Next time I make it, I'll be lowering the times.

Our teenager guy enjoys eating this grilled chicken.  I use lime juice out of fresh lime instead of lemon.  It is YUMMY!   Next time, I would add garlic after reading your comments.

Made it as written and felt it lacked a bit in the seasoning. It did cook up nice though on my indoor grill. I did as another reviewer suggested and poked holes in the chicken to marinade it for a bit while heating the grill. Will make it again but adding garlic might be a nice addition with some more seasoning.

So good!  This was the first time ever I have been able to grill chicken that came out juicy and flavorful!  I took some suggestions from some of the other reviewers, but mostly stayed right with the original.  I let it sit in the lemon and seasonings for a few minutes while the grill heated up, pounded the thicker parts down a little for more even cooking, and smeared some butter on them and let them finish grilling.  They were delicious!

We baked the chicken rather than grilled it.  It was delicious!  The rosemary and garlic balanced perfectly and the dijon mustard added just the right amount of piquancy.  We'll make this again, and perhaps try it with salmon.

Actually 3.5 Not bad but seems like it might need some more seasoning, not sure what. Maybe fresh parsley? Breasts were cut in half and then I sliced fatter pieces  through the center. Cooked about 4 minutes a side on medium to high grill 375-400 degrees.

This was ok.  The only thing I did different was braise in a pan, since I don't currently own a grill.  I  thought it was too salty though.  I recommend using seasoning salt sparingly. I was eyeballing it,  and I just used too much., so be careful.  I might try this again, with some different seasonings.

This was delicious.  I did change it slightly:  Juice & zest from one large lemon+almost as much olive oil, 1 tsp all purpose dried herb, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp Crazy Jane Mixed-up Salt.  Marinated for about 1/2 an hour. Grilled about 10 minutes each side. Tender, tasty, juicy.  My husband and I both loved.  Those who said it was tasteless need to try fresher ingredients.

I've been wanting to try this for a while because of how simple it is.. And I love lemon and chicken. I opted to use 3 garlic cloves minced instead of the onion powder and used Oregano in place of parsley. Also used to zest of the lemon. I pounded my chicken breasts to about twice the size and marinated them for 1 hour(drizzled in about 2 tbsp of olive oil also.
I enjoyed the overall light flavor of this.
I don't see how just dipping the chicken quickly in the lemon juice absorbs any of the flavours.. Seems like a waste to me... But I like a lot of flavor. 
I didn't end up having any juices to discard after an hour of marinated.. Because it all stuck on the chicken.. Perhaps would of rated lower if I followed the method.
Highly recommended marinating for optimal flavors. Don't marinate more than 2 hours as the lemon juice will start to cook the chicken.

I marinated the chicken overnight and pan fried it in a little canola oil. It was easy to make but the taste fell short. The lemon was overpowering and it needed a bit more seasoning . It is a healthy dish though.

This was incredibly easy and very tasty. I used it in a recipe from this site, Chickend and Vegetable Pasta Salad. My son and my husband devoured it. I am going to use this for all kinds of dishes. I am going to have my son grill it tonight for dinner. I slightly butterflied my breasts and then put them on a grill pan on the stove the first time I made them.

Good enough for company. Made it twice so far. Today made it for company and everyone raved. I cut my chicken breasts in half to make them a little thinner. Marinated them in the lemon juice for 15 - 30 min and for the seasoned salt I used the McCormick Grill Mates Smoke House Maple. I used the onion powder, salt and pepper as called for. I also used the butter pats while grilling as recommended by Trinka. Do not overcook!! I cooked approx 9 minutes total and could have even gone less time on the thinner pieces. It was delicious.

Jenny, this is a wonderful starter recipe; as many have posted, there are different ways to adapt to flavoring. I followed your recipe except I added garlic powder and let sit in the lemon juice while the charcoal grill heated up. Very nice flavor!

Jennie's Grilled Chicken Breasts Haiku: "Used like marinade. Let chicken bathe for a bit. Flavor didn't 'cling.'" I made the recipe as directed (halved for 2 chicken breasts though), and marinated the chicken for maybe an hour tops, as I've been told that too much lemon juice will gradually start to "cook" chicken in a marinade. Anyways, I thought the flavor was too subtle, which made the chicken OK for topping a salad, and then using in quesadillas the next day, but I wanted the flavor to POP on its own. For all the 5-stars here, I was surprised, but it was still an okay recipe that I'm glad that I made!

We liked it but it was a little too lemony. I made one before that had honey in it too so maybe adding a little of that will help for us.

I did everything according to recipe as written.  Chicken turned out flavorful and juicy.  I will use this technique for grilled chicken again, changing up the  herbs and spices for variety.

This is hands down THE BEST Grilled Chicken recipe ever!  I've made it for friends and family (several times), and everyone drools over it.  So simple and delicious.

Very, very, very, very good and easy, easy, easy.  Oh, did I mention that it was good and easy.  I let the chicken sit in the lemon juice (I didn't have quite enough so I threw in some lime juice) until my grill was ready, maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Served it with Mexican rice and green beans, delicious, fast and low cal.  A triple play.

Made this tonight and it was great!!! I was careful not to grill the chicken too long like I usually do and it was so juicy and delicious!! No BBQ sauce needed! I didn't have onion powder though but I did have dried onion and used that. Hubs and the kids loved it too :)

Great flavor and easy to make.  As others suggested, I cut slits into the raw breasts and let them marinade in the lemon juice for 2 or 3 hours.  Our grill isn't prepared for use, so I cooked these in a skillet.  They were good this way, but I can't wait to cook them on the grill.  Well done, and thank you for sharing.

I tried this twice, first time as per the recipe and it was still pretty good, just a little bland for the over-spiced taste-buds I have here, second time I used a little red pepper as well and there was no complaints at all, thank you :)

Really great, would have been better if I had let it marinade first -- but I could still taste the lemon. Made our extra peppery! Served with "Pasta and Beans" from this site. Simple and delish!

The meat stayed juicy but you can eliminate the salt.  I used sea salt and it was still too salty.  Otherwise, a good recipe!

Very nice and easy.  I used boneless thigh pieces, as we prefer dark meat.  Followed the prep, but for myself, I need to work on getting a bit more flavor. Also, the grilling time needs to be watched. For us, it was much shorter.

Very good! I used Emeril's Essence (recipe on the food network site) instead of onion powder and parsley. Used thin tenders, and cooked only a minute or so per side on a very hot cast iron grill pan. Had with Pioneer Woman's Crash Hot Potatoes and broccoli. Great dinner!

We loved this recipe!  It was very tasty and moist.  My husband said this was the best grilled chicken ever.  I added just a touch of orange muscat champagne vinigar from Trader Joe and also added some dried herbs.  I will definitely make this many more times.  Thanks Jenny!

This is a great and simple recipe. I used oregano b/c I was out of parsley and I only used one lemon and it was still good. I made it with rice pilaf but next time I'll try the scalloped potatoes...thanks for the suggestions.

I loved this recipe for the simplicity and the taste.  Cooked as directed and my hubby loved it too.  I actually diced up the leftover chicken and put over some tossed salad for my lunch today - yum.  I love that it's super healty too!

This was good but needed a little more flavor.  I marinated the chicken in evoo & lemon juice before putting on grill.  Next time I think I'll season sooner and let the chicken sit.

This was quick and easy.  I added red onions when marinating and let it sit for overnight.  I don't give 5 stars if I need to make changes.

I made this last night and it was VERY good - hubby really liked it! I didn't have any dried parsley, so used 1/2 tsp cumin with 1-1/2 tsp oregano...yum! It was super simple and super fast (especially when cooked with my Foreman grill).

Absolutely delicious. Prepared on my George Foreman. Added some minced garlic which really spiced it up.

Good, super quick and easy, and very few ingrediants needed (and likely to have all on hand)

Made this for my brothers and I for dinner one night. Very easy, very delicious!! Didn't taste too good reheated, moisture was gone I'll look into how to fix that problem next time I make it. Will definitely make again!

I MARINATED THE CHICKEN BREASTS FOR 6HRS FOR EXTRA FLAVOR AND USED FRESH PARSLEY INSTEAD OF DRY.
