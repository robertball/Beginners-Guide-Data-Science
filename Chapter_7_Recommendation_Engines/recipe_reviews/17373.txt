I have made this many times, and my friends and family all absolutely love it.  However - one change I make - when adding all the veggies & meat to the bacon grease, also add appx 1 cup of water.  Cover & simmer for about 20-30 minutes, then drain water, add bacon, and serve.  This ensures the potatoes & other veggies will fully cook.  This dish is an all-time favorite!!

This was ok but I thought it was on the bland side. I did not like the texture of the bacon in this dish. I thought the potato slices were akward since everything else was chopped I should of cut them into small cubes.

I make this at least once a month.  It's delicious, super fast, and adapts well to almost any combo of vegetables on hand.  Don't skip the sausage-on-top step -- it's the key.

This was fantastic! Thanks to reviewer "kim in NY," I cooked the potatoes for approx 10min in the microwave before adding them to the skillet. Also, I used a little more bacon and seasoned it all with some garlic and onion powder. Very tasty meal! We loved it and wanted more when it was all gone! Some of us sprinkled a little cheese over our bowl but was good without it too! Will make this again! Thanks Lillian and your creative mother!!

I thought this would be bland but I was wrong!! I used precooked bacon cut into bits, frozen brocolli, and smoked sauage. We like the flavor of smoked sauage better. I put all the veggies in a glass pan with a lid and baked in the oven at 350 for 1 hr. Then I added the sausage to the top and baked another hour. Next time I will add the brocolli after the first hour but all in all the flavor was wonderful. I'm sure it would be great on the stove if you slice the potatoes very thin like the recipe says. I cut mine into half inch thick slices. Didn't even need butter and salt!

Brussel Sprouts cut in half and sauteed is also a good option instead of the brocolli.

My family loved this dish! However, I think the potatoes should be cooked first because they take more than 10 minutes. So place them first in a skillet and allow them to cook a while, then add the rest of the ingredients.

This was a hit with my picky hubby!  I love to try new recipes, but he rarely asks me to make things again.  I have made this several times since the first try, and we NEVER have leftovers.  I pre-cook the potatoes (6 of them instead of 4) for about 10 minutes in the microwave while chopping the rest of the vegetables.  It turns out perfect, everytime!!
THANK YOU!!  THANK YOU!!  THANK YOU!!

I made this for a potluck breakfast wedding shower for my former boss and everyone loved it.  The combination of meats and vegetables made it flavorful, and colorful.  I enjoyed it a lot... If only bacon grease were healthy.

Yum, this was really good, we made some small changes, used a full package of bacon, sauteed 2 cloves of fresh garlic in with the bacon grease, used 2 lbs of kielbasa, and added garlic pepper, onion powder along with other ingrediants, it was delicious, DH said definately a keeper.  Thank your Mom for a delicious recipe.

This was really good.  Needed to use up some fresh broccoli.  I didn't have celery, so I substituted diced squash and turkey sausage.  Really easy.  Thanks!

Liked it the way it is.  I doubled the recipe.  Couldn't find Kielbasa Sausage, so use any sausage I could find.  Why is it called a casserole?  It's more like a skillet dish.

This dish was soooo easy to make and my family loved it.  Even my kids who are 5,9 & 10.  I used red potatoes and left the peel on.  I put them in the microwave for 5 min. and then sliced them for the the dish.  I only had carrots, red onion and broccoli on hand.  I put some lemon pepper and a few dabs of butter on at the end and let it melt over the meat and veggies.  I served it with bread sticks.  This will be a regular in our house.

Make also with whatever veggies are on hand (i forgot the brocolli)...used more bacon (yum)...so easy to change.

Pretty good stuff.   I pre-cooked the potatoes a bit in the microwave and cubed them, and I left out the celery (had none).   It made a good hearty supper, and the broccoli and carrots made it very colorful and appealing on the plate.

We loved this recipe, I didn't have broccoli, but did have broccoli slaw, with carrots, cabbage ect so was able to make this with pretty much the same ingredients, just cut differently!  This also saved time in the end for a quick easy worknight dinner.  I also placed the potatoes in the microwave for about 8 minutes before adding to the pan.  We will definitely have this again!  Thank you for the wonderful dish!

Definitely comfort food! It was tasty but sort of greasy so I would not make this very often. Would probably be good for breakfast along side some eggs.

Following another poster's advice, I used pre-cooked bacon to try to cut down on the fat.  However, cooking the veggies in olive oil made the whole dish come out pretty tasteless.  Next time I will fry the bacon in the pan and then fry the veggies in the bacon fat, as the recipe states.  But I think this can be a really tasty recipe . . . . just make sure to follow the original recipe!  :)

This was really good.  I'd like to give it 4.5 stars as a combination rating for being very good (not the best ever, but very good) while also being reasonably easy (though not a 5 minute quickie), but 4.5 stars isn't a choice.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked my potatoes a bit in the microwave first (whole, in their skins).  For my microwave, 10 minutes was too much, so I'll try 6 minutes next time.  I made a few MINOR changes just to make it a little easier and a little healthier.  Subbed precooked bacon so all I had to do was cut it up and add it at the end.  I therefore sauteed the veggies in olive oil instead of bacon grease.  I chopped the potatoes, as recommended by another reviewer, (instead of slicing) after precooking them in the microwave .  I used bagged washed broccoli spears and chopped up some pre-peeled and pre-washed baby carrots for ease.  And I used turkey kielbasa to cut down on the fat.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added 1/4 cup of water before adding the kielbasa.  I'm listing all these things just to be thorough but they are all very minor changes to the recipe.  It as really good. My young kids (almost 2 and almost 4) wouldn't touch it (didn't even try it), but my husband and I thought it was very good.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish although I parboiled the carrots, potatoes and broccoli together and I left out the celery.  Will definetly make this one again and heck with the fat content.  Cooking this in the bacon grease was flavorful enough, but I agree with other reviewers and could add some garlic or season salt.

Both my boyfriend and I liked this recipe - I used bulk baby carrots and broccoli so I didn't have to chop and skipped the celery as we both don't like them cooked.  Used red potatoes, so no peeling and added fresh garlic.  Very quick and tasty.  Thanks

Thank you for this delicious recipe. Everyone liked this one--even the picky grandkids. I did make a few changes: I used 1/2 head cabbage instead of broccoli; six mild italian sausages instead of Keilbasa; added one garlic clove and two thinly sliced carrots.
I served this over brown rice and it was delicious! Will make again.

I used turkey bacon and turkey kielbasa to cut the fat and didn't cut out any flavor at all, my husband thought the bacon was real and "quality" before I told him it was turkey.  I added some olive oil after the bacon cooked since there wasn't any grease, tasted great. This was super easy! Thanks!

I made this for lunch today and I think it is pretty good. My kids (4 and 2) are not eating it, but I will feed it to hubby when he gets home tonight. 

I used Beef Smoked Sausage,6 small potatoes, 1/4 of an onion, and 1 small head of broccoli because that is what I had on hand. 
I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 1 cup of water. I think next time I would only use about 1/2 cup of water and will make sure to use the rest of the ingredients as written. Thanks!

I made this recipe today because I had bacon and broccoli that I wanted to use plus most of a sausage. My only changes were minor, as suggested by some previous reviews: cooked the potatoes & onions in the bacon grease (practically none, so had to add a little olive oil) until nearly done, then included the broccoli, added chicken broth as needed to soften the potatoes & broccoli, and cooked a little longer than called for until the liquid was nearly absorbed. I had no celery and therefore omitted it. Both husband and grown daughter loved it! My daughter said I can make it any time for her, which is rare for her.The sausage was a flavorful one from the island of Crete (we don't seem to have Kielbasa here), which may have contributed to the excellent taste. Yum and thanks to the poster. Next time I may try shredded cabbage as suggested by several reviewers - looking forward to it!

This recipe is good, homestyle, comfort food.  I like to dice the potatoes instead of slicing, and saute them for a few minutes before adding the other veggies.  Then, I put a lid on and steam everything for a few minutes.  This gives the sausage a chance to release all the nice juice and helps to tenderize the potatoes and other veggies without burning.  It is delicious!!

Pretty good! I couldn't bear to leave all of the bacon grease in so I drained most of it and add chicken broth a little at a time as needed while cooking. Probably better with all of the bacon grease but still very good this way.

Lillian, I hope you live another 86 years! And, tell your daughter to submit more of your recipes!  This was truly wonderful.  I didn't have any celery and only had Smoked Turkey Sausage, but even with those changes, this dish was very very good!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was delicious!  Since I don't care for celery and my boyfriend doesn't care for carrots, I used broccoli and cawliflower.  The flavors were out of this world.  We will definitely have this again, and again, and again . . .  Thank you Lillian!

This was really easy and good.  I always go heavy on the veges and this turned out great.  Remember to prep everything before you start.   I used my electric skillet and just put the lid on while cooking.  It cooked so fast.

I thought this recipe was OK. While preparing it I thought it wouldn't have any flavor but it was OK. I did add some garlic salt which helped but the leftovers didn't get eaten. I think I'll make something different next time.

Good but I used turkey bacon which doesn't have hardly any grease so I had to keep adding water. I did microwave the potatoes for a couple minutes before putting them on the stove. My 9 yr old didn't really like it but it was probably because I subbed brussel sprouts for the broccoli and she doesn't like them.

I really liked this recipe.  It was well like by 3 out of 4 family members.  In my house that is considered a victory.  I followed the ingredient list, but didn’t measure.  I used 12 oz pack of bacon and will probably try 16 oz next time.  I don’t eat kielbasa, but left in for the boys in the house, and added a lot of flavor.  My husband whole heartedly believes that cabbage would great next time.  I told him good luck with that

This was really good and easy to make. I only used 2 potatoes and cut them into cubes as recommended in an earlier note. There were still too many potatoes because they didn’t cook evenly so I would maybe use one next time.

Tasty, but definitely precook your potatoes a bit, or else they wind up not being fully cooked when the rest is done. Otherwise though, a pretty great, simple dinner.

Quick and tasty meal for families on the go.  The only change I made was to put a cover on the skillet during the cooking times.  This helps get the vegetables to the desired tenderness

I give this 5 stars because it is exactly what it says it is, Down Home.  A nice one pot dish with regular ingredients and tasty in a country home cooked and flavored in an old fashioned way.  You have to have a very LARGE skillet and even then it's tough to saute all those ingredients.  My advice, do the best you can to stir 2 or 3 times, but mostly just to coat all the ingredients with the bacon grease.  Add the kielbasa, lower the heat, cover and cook until desired vegetable tenderness.  We like our broccoli and other veggies very soft, so 20 minutes should do the trick.  Someone said they added water...I can't imagine doing this and it isn't required.

I brought this dish to my daughter's for me to eat for lunch because her household (except her husband) is on a special diet. Her mother in law and husband were there so I offered them some. They loved it and so did I. Definitely not a low calorie dish with the bacon fat, but I think it is actually very healthy with all the veggies. I added the potatoes and onions to the skillet after the bacon was cooked and cooked them for about 10 minutes until they were just barely done before adding the rest of the veggies. I did wind up adding about one third cup of water to help the broccoli and carrots along. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. What a great meal! It is not fancy, just good food served right! I am making it for dinner tonight after a busy day to serve to my husband for the first time.

I thought it was all right, but I wouldn't make it again.  It really didn't stand out for me.

This was really good.  My husband thought it needed some kind of sauce, but my son and I were happy to eat what he didn't want.  It is really good as leftovers, as well.

I precooked the potatoes in the micro, added some italian seasoning and topped with cheese. Will make again.

It took a lot longer to cook than the instructions said, but it turned out really great!!  And my husband liked it (which is a good sign)!

A little vague on the directions (use an entire bundle of broccoli), and a little bit too much on some other things. For example, we would use half the amount of sausage recommended, a lot more broccoli, and possibly add a layer of chips and cheese on the top. otherwise, not a bad starter base recipe, but it wasn't quite to our liking.

This is another time when I would like to have a half star rating - the dish was really good but not quite a 5, so 4 1/2 stars.  A lot of chopping is involved, but it's worth it.  I followed the recipe as is but next time (and there will be), I will add a few red pepper flakes and cheese on top to serve.  It's a keeper.  Thanks.

I had a heart attack just reading the recipe!  I am giving 4 instead of 5 factoring in the years I just took off my life.  My Suggestion:  Drain the fat and then add the crumbled bacon.    Delicious Dish!

Good Recipe!  I read the reviews and I did start cooking the potatoes while I was cutting up everything else.  Will make again.
