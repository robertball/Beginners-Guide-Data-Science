This salad was very colorful and had a lot of texture.  It was good, but, not great for us.  I think it needed to have more dressing and for our taste needed a little more tang.  I didn't add the additional 1/4 cup of sugar and it still seemed a little sweet for my family.   If you like a sweeter salad - you would probably enjoy this recipe.

I have made this a few times. Use any canned beans you want. I left out the mushrooms and the extra sugar isn't necessary. It's delicious every time and super easy!!!

I left out the corn and unfortunately I didn't have green beans, but otherwise I made the same recipe. I used my emulsion blender to mix the salad dressing. I agree with the posters; the flavor was bland. I added garlic powder. Boom! that's all it needed. It is now a tasty salad. I will add green beans tonight. Before we finish it off I will add a lesser amount of corn to see if I like the addition. Enjoy!

I used all fresh garden veggies, the extra sugar was needed! Then instead of garbanzo beans I used black beans. Instead of bell pepper I used sweet banana peppers (all colors). Instead of cider vinegar I used reg distilled vinegar. Instead of can corn, I used two cobs of corn boiled cut off the cob, all veggies except onion, peppers were cooked prior no mushrooms were added.

I made this recipe as directed, only not using the mushrooms. I have family members that do not like them. I gave this 3 stars because not only did I just think the flavor was so- so, the rest of my crew thought the same. Like the other reviews indicated, the extra sugar is not needed unless you prefer sweeter bean salads. It was worth a try though.
