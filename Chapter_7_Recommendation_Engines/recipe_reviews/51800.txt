I cheated on this one and used blackberries instead of the blueberries. Just in case anyone is having a dificult time finding the 3 oz. box of jello, it's actually 0.3 oz. I used the sugar free kind, and light cool whip. I poured the mix into the mold before adding the blackberries, and refrigerated it overnight. It came out of the mold beautifully, although I left it in the warm water a little too long(the top melted just a tiny bit). I will definitely use this  recipe again.

This is really good.  Bf hasn't tried it so I'll have to update when he does, but I like it.  It's light and fluffy.  Pretty easy, too.  I put the timer on for an hour so I wouldn't accidently allow the jello to gel completely, and it really didn't look that thickened to me but I went ahead and whipped it and added the remaining ingredients anyway.  It worked perfectly fine.  It does take some whisking, so be prepared for some exercise or use a mixer.  I used my stand mixer and it probably needed about 3-4 minutes on high speed to fluff up.  I put some in 4 6 oz ramekins and the rest in a 2 quart bowl (I don't have a jello mold) and it filled the 2 quart bowl a little over half full, so this does get a number of servings.  I guess I didn't grease the ramekins that well bc a little bit stuck to it.  It's sort of a pale lime green color; my picture doesn't do it justice, unfortunately--it just looks off white in the pic.  :o(  Thanks for the recipe!

This was even better than I thought it would be. I wasn't sure about the added sugar, but it was just right and made for a really nice combination of flavors.  It was a big hit at the potluck I took it to & I only got a little bite of my dad's because it was already gone by the time I got to it.

Loved it! I took it to a potluck, and it all disappeared! I got great comments on it! Will be making it again. I did find that i didn't need all 8 oz of cool whip. and it took longer than an hour to get anywhere near thick.

7.4.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/51800/blueberry-lime-mold/ ... Well, reading reviews I expected magic, but I got a refreshing, light lime gelatin-ish number with blueberries.   The addition of the lime juice & sugar steps it up; a more "real" taste.   I had a larger container of whipped topping, didn't feel like doing the math, so folded in two cups.  'Don't think whisking it in would be a good idea - like you shouldn't whisk the real deal into something - could be wrong about it being okay with whipped topping.  Anywayyy, no magic, but a cool, Summer side just the same.

This jello is delicious! It's so light. I thought the lime juice would make it too tart, but it was just right. And it's pretty too. Served it at Easter and everyone loved it.  Glad to have a new jello recipe that is different from the one I always make. Thanks for sharing Domestic Goddess.
