I knew this soup would need to cook longer to bring out the flavors.  I didn't bother to saute` the onion and garlic, I just put all except the beans and pasta into my slow cooker.  I used 1 teaspoon of basil and added 1 teaspoon of oregano and just let it cook on low for most of the day.  An hour before serving I added the beans, let the cooker heat back to simmer then the last 30 minutes I added the pasta.  Much more flavorful.

This was very tasty.  Since we aren't strict vegetarians, I used Knorr caldo de pollo instead of the vegetable stock and threw in a little more pasta and used Italian spices because that is what I had.
It was fun for my stepdaughter because some of the garbanzos get stuck in the shells and she made sure that all the shells had a bean in them.

I used dried chickpeas which I soaked and cooked - I really dislike the texture of tinned beans and such - and I used water plus ca. 2 teaspoons of Vegeta seasoning mix rather than canned broth. I also about tripled the basil - next time I'll maybe add some oregano and paprika powder, possibly some chili as well. Unfortunately, our spice shelf is rather empty at the moment... Changed the method a little, too: Cooked the chickpeas, saut√©ed oinion and garlic in another saucepan, added tomatoes to the onion, added water, spices and cooked chickpeas, cooked the pasta and added that. This is a really yummy recipe!

Even using chicken broth instead of water the resulting soup seemed somewhat weak.  I doubled the amount of garbanzos, added a little more pasta (which I had ready because of other reviews), added 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and at the last minute added a can of Italian Green Beans.  This brought the flavor of this soup up quite nicely and was a hearty and satisfying meal.  With these additions, my yield was 8 servings.  Very good basic recipe.

Great soup recipe. I did add 1 tsp. of oregano and I added squash and zucchini to the sauteing onion and garlic. My husband finished off the leftovers all by himself.

Five stars for this healthy recipe.  I added another can of chickpeas as well as rosemary.  I used two cups of water instead of vegetable broth.

I added to the four severing recipe:
1/2 Portabella Mushroom
1 Cup Bean Sprouts
3oz Firm Tofu

It was delicious, everyone who has tried it loves it.  Wonderful favor and a filling soup as well.

Very good and easy recipe. Used vegetable boullion cubes instead of vegetable broth.  I didn't follow the proportions all that closely, but still ended up with a great-tasting meal.

I did not find this had much flavour.  My friend is a vegetarian and she didn't find it flavourful either.    We tried adding more herbs and seasoning but there was still something missing from this recipe. Would not make it again...

I followed Wilemon's advice exactly, and the resulting soup was fresh and tasty--but not nearly as flavorful as I would like. I added a few drops of Sriracha sauce to the bowl, and my bland soup became one of the best soups that I have ever had!

YUM.  Next time I think I'll saute the onions in my sop pot, then add the broth and pasta - Its my fault, I should've cooked my onion a bit longer...I added extra garlic and only sauteed for the last min or so as I like the stronger garlic taste.  I also add a bunch of fresh basil at the end and didnt have the whole tomatoes, so used a can of petite diced (threw it in with the liquid) and I used veggie boullion (it is all I had) and ended up using 6 cups to get the consistency I liked.  So - yes...I altered a bit, but the base is good and I kept to the ingredients :-)  If I had had some spinach, I would've threw some in with the fresh basil.  OK - as I'm eating and reading, I see it calls for 3 cans of broth - I thought it was just two, LOL, pays to read the recipe...I was hungry and made it fast!  Which is nice, this soup can be made up quickly!

This was good and a very healthy meal! I didn't exactly follow the recipe though but the recipe was a great base to add on to.  Instead of the pasta I added brown rice and I also added potatoes.  I added a little more than half a can of tomato paste and I was generous with the spices and added 1 tsp. oregano.  In addition to what the recipe called for, I added about 1 cup of celery, a can of corn, and about 5 carrots. It was yummy! I will definitely make this again! Next time I will add green beans and maybe throw in cabbage.  This soup is wonderful because you really can add whatever you have in your fridge that you want to use up!

This is a very easy soup to make, but the recipe as written doesn't have much flavor to it so I'd recommend doubling the spices and then let it simmer for a while to let the flavors develop properly.  Once you do that the soup is very tasty and good for you.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Joy :)

Very good! I used tomato paste instead of who tomatoes (all I had at the time and everything is closed past 7:00 here) and it was still awesome! I little garlicky for my taste, but I balanced it out by adding some potatoes. First recipe I've used from here that I've bothered to review. Highly recommend!

I really enjoyed this recipe better the next day than the first. I think once it sat for 24 hours and the flavors melded together, it brought this soup from just okay to really delicious. More spices are needed - added lots of garlic and italian seasoning. Also, per another reviewer - added a few tablespoons tomato paste to thicken it up and topped with shredded cheese.

Delicious and very easy! I tripled this recipe, added 4 tablespoons of tomato paste and simmered for at least a 1/2 hour.  Adding the tomato paste added a little more flavor and color and simmering brought out the flavors.  Just a little bland without doing this. Will make this again!

This was great and easy and easily adaptable. I did not follow the recipe to a T, but I used bullion instead, added tomato paste like one of the reviews, as well as dried basil, enoki mushrooms. It was great! I will make it again and add different veggies, broccoli or carrots would go well!

I thought this soup had excellent flavor! I followed the heed of other ratings and added oregano and simmered longer than an hour. It is light but the garbanzo beans pack in the protein. It reheats really well too.

This was exactly what I was hoping it would be! It was easy to whip together and absolutely delicious. The recipe calls for 3 cans of broth, but I used a single 32-oz carton that I found at the store, and only used half of the onion and reserved tomato juices. And for the sake of being lazy, I opted for a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes as opposed to the whole peeled. At the end, it was the perfect consistency and very filling. I easily got six servings out of it. Easy, affordable, low cal, filling and delicious! Thanks for sharing! :)

Incredibly easy, especially if you make it in the slow cooker like I did.  I upped the spices and added oregano, and instead of 3 cans of broth, I used 2 cans then did not drain the tomatoes.  Made for a tomatoey, richer base.  I added the chickpeas about an hour prior to serving, and the pasta about 20 minutes before.  I didn't bother cooking the pasta prior to putting it in; it cooks up in 15-20 mins from the heat of the soup.  As another reviewer commented, cooking all day in the slow cooker increased the flavor in this soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a few things which made it 10x more amazing! I used chicken broth, I added potatoes and celery and used pastina instead of the pasta shells. so delicous!

We loved this soup! I don't really to take a long time to cook, or recipes with a trillion ingredients. My partner is a doctor, and I'm a student, so we're both busy. This recipe is perfect, we substituted shell pasta with ditalini pasta and added fresh chopped kale.  Very quick and delicious.

Very good soup. Excellent meal when served with a salad and biscuits or rolls. (I made Cheddar Bay Biscuits). I didn't understand using whole tomatoes just to chop them up, I'm thinking you could probably use a can of diced tomatoes in its place so I might try that next time because chopping up whole canned tomatoes is quite messy.

This is a good soup. I give it 3 stars because the flvours are good, but very simple and basic. This is a satisfying soup, but nothing fancy. It is a very quick and cheap way to make soup, especially for a last minute meal. I used only a 15 ounce can of tomatoes, and added a bit of soy sauce to enrichen the flavour.

As any Italian household (and those who are friends of Italians) will tell you, this is a popular meatless meal called pasta  fagioli -- aka pasta fazool. Easy to make, very tasty!

This soup was soooooo good!! I only changed a few things and the changes made this soo good. First I sauteed onion in olive oil then seasoned them with garlic powder, cumin, red peper flakes, basil and thyme. I added the drained and rinsed garbanzo beans to the onion and sauteed them while the pasta was boiling. I didn't have that much broth so I boiled the pasta in water. I poured the chicken broth (that's all I had and I only had less than half a box of it) and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles into the bean/onions. I needed a little more liquid so I used a couple ladles of the pasta water when I added the pasta to it. This was pretty cheap to make!! Will make again, thanks for the great soup recipe.

Loved this! I used my immersion blender to puree the tomatoes with onion and garlic and subbed a can of white beans for the pasta. I also used a whole bag of fresh spinach, chopped. Thanks for a great soup!

I made this the first time with store-bought,  "Kitchen Basics" brand vegetable broth---a very salty, full-flavored broth----and it was scrumptious,  delectable.  I made it again with a weaker,  home-made broth and it was just okay.  If you want to make this yummy,  use a full-flavored veggie broth!

I added oregano, rosemary, parsley, and a bay leaf.  I also added some sliced carrots that I wanted to use up, and increased the pasta by about 50%.  I threw in a pinch of sugar just because it seemed "right."  The soup turned out delicious, and my kids asked to have it again the next night!  We ate the soup with bread for dipping, and shredded cheese sprinkled on top.  I'm sure I will make this again, and I will probably make the same adaptations to the recipe.

To those who say the recipe lacks flavor. I suggest the addition of grated parmesan or romano cheese.  My family has made this type of macaroni and bean soup (Pasta Faggioli) for years and I can't imagine eating it without the cheese.

This was awesome. I hope I can replicate this. I had leftover chicken, beef, and lobster broth. (Majority Beef broth) I added more noodles (macaroni) and when done, I sprinkled some shredded colby cheese on top. For leftovers, I layered the containers with soup then cheese, soup and topped with cheese. Great and reminds me of minestrone.

Eh.  This soup lacked some flavor, but it is easy. I highly recommend slicing the diced tomatoes into smaller pieces--otherwise, you have large tomatoes in your bowl that are hard to cut with a spoon.  I'm not sure if I would make this again--maybe if I had the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it.

My husband LOVED this soup! Not sure what I did but it ended up more pasta dish, less pasta soup. I used concentrated veggie soup base, but more than was called for to add more flavor. Besides that it turned out great!

Pretty good basic recipe.  I used garden rotini pasta instead of seashell pasta and more onions than called for.  I always cook with more spice than called for.  This soup was a great hit with my mom.  She almost finished it off the next day.

this is basically a modification of pasta fazool, made famous by dean martin in the song "that's amore."  the line in the song is "when the stars make you drool like a pasta fazool, that's amore."  the original has cannellini beans instead of garbanzo's. buon appettito!

Added more garlic, just because I double the garlic in almost every recipe I make and used crushed tomatoes out of personal preference.  We didn't find it flavorless as some reviewers did.  I gave it 5-stars for the comfort food factor and ease of preparation.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but did make a few changes.  I used dried chickpeas that I cooked with garlic & bay leaves and reserved the cooking liquid.  Instead of the canned broth, I used half homemade chicken stock & half of the reserved cooking liquid.  That alone gave it great flavor.  I thought crushed tomatoes sounded better than chunks, so used that instead.  At the last minute decided to use a couple of turkey sausages that I had on hand and thought that tasted great.  But since we try to eat vegetarian meals often, I will make it without the meat, and I think it will be just as good.  Definitely top it with grated parmesan cheese.  We all loved this soup, even my little kids!

I rate this 5 stars because my kids actually ATE it! I did change a lot, though, and I doubled the recipe as well. Here's what I did: 44 oz. vegetable broth, 1.5 cup whole wheat rotini pasta, 1 can (14.5) garbanzo beans, 1 (14.5 oz.) can dark red kidney beans, 1 (14.5 oz.) can diced tomatoes, 2 whole tomatoes diced, 1/2 t. black pepper, 1 t. salt, 1 t. Italian Seasoning, 1 zucchini, 1 onion, 1 t. minced garlic, 1 t. dried basil leaves, 1 t. oregano, and shredded colby jack cheese on top. YUM!

I made this recently and had high hopes for it. I followed the directions except adding a few extra veggies like spinach to it. However, it just did not have enough flavor for me in the end. It really needs some extra seasonings or ingredients to give it a flavorful taste. I will not make this again.

This was very good and the kids even ate it.  I did change the recipe slightly b/c I didn't have all ingredients on hand.  I substituted crushed tomatoes for diced tomatoes and I used brown rice shells.  Because I used rice pasta I cooked it according to package directions, rinsing in cold water when cooked THEN I heated the stock and added everything.  I also added extra garlic and I must say this soup is better the next day!  REally nice for cold days!

Although this is not a very well written recipe...it is EXCELLENT, VERY tasty!  If you like pasta, I would recommend doubling the amount of shells.  Also, add some Italian Seasoning.

I make this all the time, we love it! I like to brown up some hot italian sausage to add to it just to give it some kick, but it's tasty without it too!

This was a comforting, simple recipe.  To make clean up even easier I only used 1 pot - first I sauteed the onions and garlic, then added the broth, tomatoes, beans, etc, brought it to a boil and then dumped in the pasta and cooked for 8 additional minutes.  I think this would be amazing with fresh herbs instead of dried.

I make this recipe about every 2 weeks - it's perfect for spring. I do use black beans instead of chick peas, since the chick peas take a lot longer to soften, but both ways it tastes great.

This soup is just ok in my book.  I fixed it because I am on Weight Watchers and it came in at 5 points per serving.  I found the recipe to be confusing (I ended up using all the reserved tomato juice and all the broth I cooked the noodles in).  I also subbed cannellini beans for the garbanzos and chicken broth for the vegetable broth.  I omitted the olive oil.  It seemed to need more seasoning, so I added Italian seasoning per others' reviews.  The WW point value decreased to 4.  This is such a huge pot of soup that I think I will get more than 4 servings out of it.  Also, I'm hoping it is more flavorful tomorrow.

Really good, healthy soup.  I used light red kidney beans (just what I was in the mood for), and tossed in some squash and zucchini I had on hand.  Also, because I love soup but hate the 1000mg sodium per serving, I used a sodium free boullion and added extra spice.  Very good.

The broth was bland (I used chicken broth) so I spiced it up with red pepper flakes and fresh rosemary, thyme, oregano and parsley. Also used whole wheat penne. I should have used more garlic. Still, considering its simplicity, pantry ingredients and short prep time, it's a good soup. It'll be good for lunches this week.

Followed recipe other than I used pasta I had at the time. As well, did not use liquid from Tomato tin. Doubled amount of herbs. Think that left-over will have more flavour...

This was extremely easy and very quick to make.  I was even able to throw it together being low on groceries in the house.  I added a little bit of spinach as well.  I didn't follow the amounts exactly, but it turned out to have a light tomato/garlic flavor and I also added a bit of parmesean as garnish.  Delicious!

Tripled recipe to fill crock pot. Canned garbanzo beans I got were a little hard, but soup still came out yummy. Will definitely try again with beans. May also sub mushrooms for variety.

i used this as a base but changed added many more things.  It actually kind of turned into a minestrone.  i added zucchini, portabello mushrooms,and a few shakes of paprika, rosemary, cumin, and oregano.  I used fresh basil and cooked the macaroni with the garbanzo beans with all the spices and vegetables.  it was really good after i made some adjustments.  I also topped it off with some colby jack shredded cheese.

This was very good. I used very little onion as a personal preference and added more pasta. I also used Italian seasoning and basil as my spices. Finally, I let it simmer for a few minutes to infuse the flavors, and it was very flavorful. Very easy!

Very good. Does have a more mild flavor, but I let mine simmer for about half and hour to let the flavor come out. I also made mine with a full cup of pasta b/c I like a chunkier soup, and used Italian seasonings. Will definitely make again.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic in them.  I also used an extra cup of chicken stock, not vegetable.  This smells and tastes delicious, and it freezes well too.

Great!  This is a vegetarian soup that will please non-vegetarians.  Mild but satisfying flavor.  We used a can of "Italian style" diced tomatoes with basil and oregano.  This worked well.  I'd like to try it with diced celery for a little crunch.

This was so, so, so, so good!  I did add a handful of mushrooms, zucchini and yellow squash.  Whatever left overs there were... got eaten.  I also used chicken stock for more flavor.

I liked that it was so excited and used pantry items I already had on hand.  I did sub navy beans for the chickpeas, because I didn't have those and it was still good.  However, the flavor is pretty one dimensional, probably because the flavors didn't have time to get develop.  I would saute the herbs with the onions & garlic next time and make my own broth.  Otherwise, yum!

I love this recipe! It overall has a great hearty flavor, perfect for tomato lovers! I used a ready-to-serve vegetable soup instead of a veggie broth. This packaged vegetable pasta with different shapes caught my eye at the grocery and I just thought the mix of colors would look great for this soup. I also missed to saute the garlic and onions, I threw them directly on the boiling pot and left it for 10 minutes and it still had great flavor.

made it in my slow cooker with everything except noodles and beans and let it cook all day. An hour before eating I added the noodles and beans and noodles ended up being way over cooked. Next time I'll add them in closer to serving time. Flavor was great!

This was really good!  I added 1 6oz can of tomato paste for extra thickness.  Also reheated leftovers of this on the stove were every bit as good.

This is just a really bland soup that has almost no flavor.  I had to jazz it up with some fresh bay leaves to make it edible.

I made this in the Instant Pot.  I skipped the oil and did not saute anything.  I just put all of the ingredients (minus the oil) in the IP and set it for 3 minutes and then did quick release.
I doubled the garbanzos, basil, thyme and garlic.
It was delicious, and we'll definitely make it again.

We added mushrooms too, easy addition.

We loved this soup!  Super easy to throw together.  The only change I made is substituted oregano for thyme.  I also saute the beans with the onions and garlic before placing in the soup.

It was pretty good. I loved how hardy it was for a soup. Although i didnt not care for the garbanzo beans in the soup and i love garbanzos. Next time i will swap out for lentils.

It's good. I used butter & saut√©ed the onion until soft, added garlic & cooked 1 more min & then added the other stuff. I used almost a full can of diced tomatoes, vegetable stock instead of water & added spinach to individual portions after it was done. Yes, I made some changes, but everyone has different taste preferences. I like solid base recipes you can tweak! :)

I'm a beginner at cooking but this seemed very easy to make, and it was! I used fresh garbanzos that I pre-made and I added a little bottled tomato (pasta) sauce the next day. Was good both with or without the tomato sauce. I also added a lot more garbanzos because I had them. I'm definitely making again.

My family and I did not like this at all.  It had no taste.  I followed the advise from some of the other readers and doubled the spices.  Also added carrots and celery and cooked it all day in the crock pot.  Still had no taste.  Would never make again.

So very good!  I used fresh thyme and oregano with some spoonfuls of bottled marinara sauce. Added an extra clove of garlic, left whole and smashed rather than minced.  Left to simmer on lowest heat setting for over an hour.   It tasted fantastic the second day! My toddler also enjoys that the a chickpea fits inside the shell pasta; it looks like a boat with a passenger to him.

Awesome recipe. So easy, tasty and healthy. I like to add frozen or canned corn.  I use crushed tomatoes and Quinoa pasta because it doesn't swell up nearly as much as other pastas, plus it makes it a gluten free option.

I must have done something wrong I couldn't eat this.Panicked I added a little more of the seasonings.It was way to acidic.I tried to remedy that with baking soda and more broth.I was thinking about tossing it if this didn't work and it did not.Lastly I added a can of tomatoe soup.Thank goodness it worked.
I budget my shopping and have so many recipes to last the week,so I'm happy to have saved this soup.

Add chunks of zucchini, celery cut into thick slices, thick slices of baby carrots and a chopped onion, and voila, minestrone!  If I don't have any broth, I just cover the ingredients with water and add a bay leaf while cooking.

Liana made for dinner.  She loved it as it had no meat.  :)  It was easy and good.  We doubled and used 2 cups of pasta and used 2 qts. homemade chicken broth and 2 1/2 c. of Lipton Vegetable soup instead of vegetable broth.  If I hadn't used the flavorful broth I may have added the oregano that several people recommended, but it really didn't need it.  We sprinkled romano cheese on top.  Tasty!  (plenty of leftovers on a double batch)

Turned out great! Have to agree with the other reviews though- add the tomato juice and allow the soup to simmer. Cook the noodles separately and add before serving.

This was awesome. I read some of the reviews and was a little nervous that it might be bland. I don't measure my spices but it's safe to say I used more than what the recipe called for. I also added some fresh thyme, basil and oregano because I had it. The real kicker though? I chopped the top off of a serrano pepper and let it stew once I added all the ingredients. I definitely sauteed the onions and garlic first with some oil and added some tomatoes to that after they were cooked.

My wife and 11 month old kid loved it too! I added some frozen peas during the last ten minutes to give it a little bit more veggies.

This one might be a winter staple.

After reading a number of reviews, I decided to add a bit extra of the basil and thyme, a decent amount of pepper, some soy sauce and Tabasco. I also added frozen green beans - not for flavor, but just for added veggies. I tasted it at after combining all the ingredients and it still seemed less flavorful than I wanted it to be, so I put it on low for about an hour, being careful never to let it get to a boil. It was perfect! I will make this recipe again with these changes.

Quick and easy and satisfying - i used tortellini instead of shells for a little more substance and added some extra spices.

I used rigatoni noodles and a mushroom broth. I added water to the broth to make more soup and didn't have canned tomatos to put in so used canned green beans instead. This soup was so good and tasted different! :)
