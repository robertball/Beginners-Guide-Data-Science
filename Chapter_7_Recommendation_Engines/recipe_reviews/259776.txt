LOVE this dish and so does the family. Very easy to make. I usually cook up the chicken early in the day and then put together an hour before dinner.  Three  changes I made was to use only organic spicy black bean (2 cans), La Banderita low fat high fiber tortillas (that's what I had in the house) and a red pepper instead of green.

I drained the extra water from the chicken vegetable mixture before I added it to the dish. Turned out perfect!

Added chipotle peppers in with pepper & onion mix for added heat, and it came out amazing! Not too hot but not bland like others said. Used extra cheese on top too.

Given the ingredients I’m surprised it was not more flavorful. I’m not a fan of baked tomatoes, so maybes add them at the end. Decent, but nothing to rave about.
