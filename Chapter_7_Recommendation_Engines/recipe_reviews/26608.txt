Average recipe.  Easy to make, but the pre-mixed taco seasoning has loads of salt.  I would suggest making your own spice mixture and using that instead.

I planned on serving this over rice for my teenage son.  He ended up bringing in 4 of his friends who also wanted to eat...as teenage boys often do ( chuckle ).  They ate every last bit of it and wanted more.  I did change a little - I added a 1/4 cup of ketchup, a 1/2 cup of salsa and some garlic powder to it.  It was REALLY very good.

I do not even know what to say about this recipe other than YUCK! Are they tacos or meatloaf. I had to give it a one star because they will not let you submit it, but it does not even deserve that.

As simple as it is to make great taco meat from scratch (and far less salty and more tasty) with 6 ozs. of tomato paste, 1 can of Ro-Tel tomatoes (undrained), 2 tsp. cumin, salt, 2 tsp. chili powder, and 1/2 tsp black pepper, this take on taco meat isn't something I'd ever use again...and certainly not something I'd serve to adults.

My family Loved this recipe!  I only made a few changes... I doubled the recipe (to feed 3 teens and a hubby); I added 3/4 cup salsa (Hell on the Red brand) and 1/4 cup ketchup and a dash of garlic powder. This we rolled up into soft tortillas with some fresh chopped tomatoes, shredded green leaf lettuce, and sour cream.  Great for a quick night's supper when everyone's going to soccer practice, football, band, etc.

It was just too sweet... and I didn't even use as much ketchup as it called for.  The next time I make this I'll only put in 1/8 cup of ketchup.

Pretty good and super easy!  Could use a little something though, maybe next time I will add a little garlic and salsa to the mix.

I didn't quite follow the recipe, but this was SUCH a HUGE hit!  browned the meat and added ingredients to crockpot and let cook for @2 hours.  used ground turkey. used six pounds for a party.  used one large can diced tomatoes and added @1/2 cup ketchup.  made this for birthday party and was perfect!

Good basic recipe that is quick and easy to make on a week night, without sacracficing flavor.  I did add salsa instead of just diced onion.  The ketchup seemed to thicken up the seasoning on the beef and made the taste more satisfying!  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely put ketchup in with the seasoning now everytime I make tacos (which is a usual Monday night "mexican night" thing around our house).  I almost forgot, we love to take a soft taco, sprinkle some shredded mexican cheeses on it then place crunchy corn tortilla and warm them until the cheese melts.  A double decker shell.  It seems to hold together better for that *CRUNCH*

This was good. Even with the ketchup. Which I had my doubts about before I ate it. I used AR Taco seasoning I by Bill Echols and only a third of the onion. I added more water and let this simmer while my rice was cooking. Thanks this was easy and made a nice meal.

Pretty Good. I was afraid this was going to end up tasting like a sloppy joe with the ketchup. It did have a sloppy joe kind of hint of flavor but over all it turned out well. All 4 kids liked it. When it's a hit with all the kids, I have to give it 5 stars.

I was a little scared to try this recipe at first, but the end result was pretty tasty. It reminded me sort of a cross between tacos and sloppy joes. We enjoyed this as something different to my traditional taco meat recipe. I will definately use this recipe again from time to time! Thanks for posting :)

I doubled the recipe for a super bowl party and it was a hit.  I put out taco shells, but it was most popular as a nacho topper!  Delicious with rotel dip, lettuce, tomato and shredded mexican blend cheese.  I transfered to a crock pot after simmering and it did great on the "keep warm" setting all evening.  Will definitely definitely make again for future potlucks!

This was a very easy recipe that was really good. Not only does it make a good taco sauce for tacos, it is great on "Loaded Nachos" and as a chili sauce on coney dogs.

Wonderful meat for tacos. I added vegetarian style refried beans in to it for some added oomph. Excellent!

I used my own taco seasoning from this site; Taco Seasoning II  and the ketchup flavour was a different twist to the meat taste!  We thought it was pretty good.  THX

This doesn't get any easier.  I didn't use the ketchup because it would have made it too sweet for my liking.  Great mix for tacos.  Thanks

I tried this recipe with a twist!  I tried Johnsonville Sausage.  It was delicious!  We made some homemade taco seasoning and tacos the way we like them, just with sausage.  It was a hit!  We will definitely do it again!

I like this better if it is made with Old El Paso medium taco sauce, it gives the meat a great flavor.

This beef was pretty good but there was something not quite right about it.  I think it was that the seasoning mix was just a bit too salty for our tastes.  I added some extra chili powder to give it a little bit more of a kick.  I will probably make this again, but I think next time I might cut back a bit on the mix, add a bit more chili powder and maybe add a little salsa.  Thanks for the recipe.

Being from California and now living in Maine I really miss good tacos, so every now and then I get a real yen for a couple.  When I fix a recipe for the first time I almost always prepare it according to the recipe but this time I really wish I had used my instincts and added a small can of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chilies and a  clove of minced garlic and omitted the ketchup altogether, it added a sweetness that was hard to correct.  Needless to say, I had a lot left over so the next day I doctored it up and made Chimachangas...not bad. :-)

I was skeptical....but this was FANTASTIC! I used Taco Seasoning I from this website and used salsa instead of ketchup.  Home run.  I will absolutely make this again and recommend it.  Omit the water though.

Great recipe. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and replaced the ketchup with salsa and a small can of diced tomatoes and green chilies. I made my own taco seasoning (got the recipe from here too). So yummy! My hubby doesn't like ketchup, so it was perfect!

If ketchup is too sweet, use a can of tomato sauce. I cook the meat with minced garlic and onion, add taco seasoning and tomato sauce. I usually add black beans as well. If you don't want to use taco seasoning, use chili powder, cumin, and garlic.

We liked this recipe. I especially liked that I could make it from items I usually have in my pantry.  I made one change. I used a taco spice mix called taco seasoning 1 from this website. I leave the salt out when I make it. I make more than one serving at a time and keep it in a jar with a screw top lid.  This taco meat recipe is quick and easy to make.
