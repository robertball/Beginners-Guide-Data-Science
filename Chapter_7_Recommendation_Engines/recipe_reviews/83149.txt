Sorry but this just didn't quite make it. The sad thing is there seems to be some good potential here that just isn't making it. For one thing it was WAY too much pasta for the amount of other ingredients. I could tell that going in so I cut back the spaghetti by QUITE a bit and still somewhat felt like I was eating pasta with a hair of flavoring. Since I think it has potential and I like the combo of salami bacon and Parmesan I might work with this and see if I can figure out a good balance in the ingredients.

This was a good recipe to use some salami that I had on hand but I wouldn't buy the ingredients just to have this dish. I did not have any tomatoes so I subbed some canned diced tomatoes. I will make it for lunch again if I have salami that needs to be used.

I omitted the basil because I didn't think it would work well with the other flavors. I also used penne pasta as that's what I had on hand. This was ok but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

This was delicious! I added a little left over Creme Fraiche I had which made it creamier than it might otherwise have been. Thanks for rescuing me I was looking at my fridge in bewilderment before I found this recipe. I whipped it up minutes and was ready to serve it when my wife walked in the door:)

This is really a very good pasta. I added extra tomatoes and think a few more wouldn't have hurt. The butter gives this a unique flavour. Thank you for the recipe.
