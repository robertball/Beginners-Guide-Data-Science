this recipe was great.  I changed it around a little by adding some different kinds of seafood. My family really loved it.

I made this at home, and it was as good as the restaurant "Cajun Boil" version that is popular in our area. We all loved it!!!

Awesome and easy - directions were easy and turned out perfect. I used Zatarains instead of the liquid seasoning - otherwise followed as is.  Note: when this says 15 servings - it means it - not one of those where you get less than expected.  We scaled back to 10 and ended up with way too much!!

Omitted the green chili pepper and used Cajun seasoning at the time I added the liquid boil.  Also, when I cut down the recipe for 4, it said to get over two lbs of shrimp and 4 lbs of crab. We had SOOOOOO much left over. That is okay, recipe was great!!

I didn't understand what was meant by "hot peppers to taste" but overall a good recipe.

we winter in texas and have access to fresh shrimp.  we brought some back to SD for christmas and made a boil.  we added brussel sprouts (it's a texas thing), it was a tremendous hit.

WOW, this turned out great.  This was just as good as our local chain restaurant.  The family loved it and really pretty easy to make.
