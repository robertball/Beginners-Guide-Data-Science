I have to let it out: this be  bangin'!

I've been hankering for some coffee ice cream, and decided on this recipe for its simplicity and the wonderful reviews. I, too, left out the donuts -- instead, I toasted some raw almonds in a frying pan and gave it a nice, chunky chop. I also used Nescafe-brand instant coffee (the "classic" variety found in Spanish stores). I've had my share of instant coffees, and this has got a wonderful, unique richness. I was too impatient to chill the mixture (KitchenAid asks you to refrigerate all mixes at least 6 hours before churning it in the ice cream attachment), so it took quite a long time to become "ice cream-y". Though I was nervous at first, within 20 minutes I knew I was in love. 

The ice cream is chilling in the freezer now, and I will update this review if it is anything less than mindblowingly spectacular. But if I don't update, it's because I'm too busy eating the whole dang container.

WOW. I skipped the donuts and just made it as coffee ice cream and I was blown away. Make sure to refrigerate the batter overnight if you're using the KitchenAid attachment. Smooth, creamy, and very satisfying. Plus, I always have everything but the heavy cream on hand, making it way cheaper than buying packaged ice cream!

I'm an ice cream addict and this is truly yummy stuff. Break up the donuts in larger chunks and make sure to add at the very end

Absolutely loved this ice cream, really gives you that donut-dipped-in-coffee flavor and it's so creamy!

I tried this recipe for my first time making ice cream and can't begin to express how great it is!  I made it with crushed Skor bars mixed in at the end instead of crullers.  I really appreciated how fool-proof this recipe was and how I didn't end up with a bunch of leftover egg whites afterwards.  The ice cream came out perfectly smooth and rich.  I wish there were more ice cream recipes like this that don't require an involved custard-making as part of the process.

This is a fun ice cream – tastes just like donuts dunked in coffee.  Dunkin’ Donuts didn’t have marble crullers so I used glazed crullers.  Even though I added them in at the very end, they still disintegrated pretty quickly.  That may be because the crullers were very soft and tender.   The ice cream was still very good though and very enjoyable.

Just finished making this! I skipped the doughnuts, but followed the recipe to a T.  I swear this is the Breyers Coffee recipe, before they went cheap. Creamy and delicious. Look out Coffee Ice Cream lovers!!!

Did not include the doughnuts though I'm sure that would have been good. This is excellent (and easy) coffee ice cream. No more expensive store bought pints for me! Thanks!

This recipe is fabulous!! I substituted 2 cups chocolate cream cookies broken into pieces and 1/2 cup sliced almonds, creating Mud Pie ice cream. I will do this again.
