Very good. This has a Southwest flavour and it was a nice change that surprised the family. The smell alone will tell you that this is not your usual stuffed bell peppers. I did however change the recipe a bit. I didn't use feta cheese but parmiggiano reggiano instead. The outcome is quite moist. Thank you for the recipe.

It is a great recipe! I recommend decreasing the amount of water by half a cup while cooking. Its a recipe worth trying and a great way to use millet.

Very tasty! I skipped the olive oil and just cooked the onions & garlic in with the ground beef.

One of the best recipes we've made! We decided to use rice instead of millet (we were unable to find it) and it turned out perfect
