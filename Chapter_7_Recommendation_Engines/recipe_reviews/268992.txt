This is an excellent way to dress up instant ramen noodles. I've been doing this (or similar) for years now. Half of an onion plus a whole bunch of green onions is overkill in my opinion but I am still giving this a 5 even though I left the yellow onion out. I did make one change and that was with the mushrooms. Nothing against fresh mushrooms but I prefer canned shiitake's in a dish like this. They just seem to go better and they add a nice texture. In the past I've also used asparagus heads and frozen peas and they are great too. Here's a tip I'll pass along. You can take this to work for lunch even if you only have access to a microwave. Dice whatever veggies you are using really small so that they will cook in time. Place everything except the water in a microwave safe bowl with a lid. When lunch time rolls around just add the water and microwave on high for 8 minutes. Let cool for 3 minutes. You can even add leftover cooked ground chicken or pork. I am no nutrition police but one thing I will point out is that this is not a recipe for someone on a restricted sodium diet. This really is a good way to "dress up" the instant noodles.

I cooked the veggies first and put the noodles in last so they wouldn't get soggy. It turned out amazing!

So simple and delicious! Love how easy it is to change things up and still taste great.  I used 4 cups of Thai chicken broth, added red cabbage, hard boiled egg, fresh veggies and about 1/2 ts of chili garlic

I did not add siracha, green onions, black pepper and white pepper, and was still very tasty!
