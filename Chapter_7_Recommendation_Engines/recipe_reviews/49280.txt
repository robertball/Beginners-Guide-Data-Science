If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! This was incredible!  However, as is always the case with me, I did make modifications.  I only had 1 1/4 cups red lentils and I ended up using 1/4 cup regular lentils (as you can see in the picture I am submitting, the color of the soup was not uniform, but that was unimportant).  I did add salt to the water when cooking the lentils and ended up adding probably close to 1 more cup of water.  I used the suggested coconut milk and used Jamaican Curry Powder along with (as suggested) red pepper flakes, cumin, and cinnamon.  I then prepared some Jasmine rice and steamed some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots as that is what I had in the freezer.  I spooned some veggies and some rice in a bowl and ladled the soup over top.  This makes a lot of soup and I thought for sure we would have substantial leftovers, but my son ate 4 huge servings and he is only 12 years old!  It was delicious and I could easily make it again and have it tonight.  Be warned, however, that meat eaters may not find it substantial enough to their liking.  I am a vegetarian and my husband is not and although he ate it, I do not think he will request it again any time soon.  That's ok because there will be more for my son and I! Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM YUM!  I made this, but used a total of 4c of water, and instead of the soy milk, I used a can of light coconut milk, and garnished with coconut....wow I thought I died and went to heaven.  This will make a regular appearance in my lunchbox!!

I also tweaked this recipe quite a bit.  I sauteed the onion and garlic and some chili pepper with the spices prior to adding the lentils and water.  I also used coconut milk instead of the soy.  Also - added a large can of diced tomatoes to make it heartier.

Delicious and EASY! After the changes I made, I would give it 5 stars for sure! I added quite a bit more ginger and curry powder, used coconut milk instead of soy (and more of it), added cumin and cinnamon, more salt, and cooked it with cashews. Delicious!

3.5 stars.  Very easy to make, actually tastes better after a few days when the flavours have had the opportunity to settle.  I used coconut milk instead of the soy, and added shredded coconut and green peas.  It was kind of lacking flavour, so I added red pepper flakes, cumin, and a pinch of cinnamon.

I tried this recipe and thought it was fantastic! I cooked a double recipe and the whole thing disapeared! I substituted 2/3 of the soy milk to coconut milk as someone had suggested and it really added alot of flavour. Make sure to cook it long enough to soften it until it looks more like pulp then lentils. Some people described it as bland, but all it needs that the recipe doesn't call for is alot more salt! Try this and it will be much tastier! I will add this to my permanent repertoire.

I really liked the flavour of this. Making as per recipe the lentils are not as "soupy" as I would like so I added about a cup of veggie chiken stock to thin out the mixture.

This is awesome. It definitely hit the spot while I was craving a warm hearty soup on this cold rainy and windy day. It's perfect on a Sunday night watching football and cozying up to this soup. I wish I had made basmati rice with it but instead I poured myself a glass of white wine and heated a crusted artisan roll with butter..mmmmm. it doesn't get better than this. Oh by the way, I did add salt and used coconut milk instead, also what really added flavor was a teaspoon of Garam Masala and it was perfect.

A bit bland looking.  I jazzed it up a bit with chopped red peppers.  The quantity of water in the receipe is low...I used closed to 4 cups.

This was just so-so. I had to make some changes based on what was in the house-- brown lentils, regular milk, white onion, ground ginger. I used red curry paste instead of powder, which would have helped if I'd not over done it-- not the recipe's fault. However, I do think it needs coconut milk and not soy milk mixed with shredded coconut. The shredded coconut could still be added though, even with using coconut milk. Overall, a 3.5, but could be good with some tweaking.

I was alittle disappointed with this recipe.  I too, substituted in coconut milk.  Overall, I thought the recipe was lacking in flavor.  It was edible, just missing a special ingredient.  I might try it again and tinker with it to see if I can get the right flavor.

I used a can of coconut juice (with shredded bits) and a little cow's milk instead of the soy milk and coconut.  Also added fresh cilantro, and pureed about 1/3 of the soup after cooking.  Very tasty!  Will definitely use this one again.

This is a really excellent base recipe. I doubled the amount (four servings just didn't seem enough in this Jewish household) and added a carrot and parsnip. Amped up the garlic and ginger and added cumin, chile powder and cayenne to the seasoning mix, as well as a serrano chile, keeping the seeds. Nice pungent yet subtle mix. Yum!

I thought this recipe was fabulous - though I did replace the soy milk with coconut milk as others have advised.  I also added peas, sliced carrots, cumin, and a bouillon cube to the soup for added flavor.

I thought the coconut flavor might save the lentils, but as usual, the blandness of the lentils was overbearing in this soup.

Great recipe, I didnt use shredded coconut but used coconut milk instead of the soy milk. I used regular lentils and yellow onions. I didnt have fresh ginger root so I used a teaspoon of dryed ground ginger. My husband loved it, we will have it again for one of our meatless meals.

I followed the top reviewer's notes and used 4 cups of water (a MUST) and a can of lite coconut milk instead of soy milk and shredded coconut.  I also pureed the lentils.  The result was a rich and creamy soup with a unique taste.

Loved this vegan recipe it had great flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that spooning it over rice & veggies or eating alone is great.  I loved the contrast of the coconut and curry.  I used sweetened coconut I had from baking and it worked ok, I bet it's a lot better with fresh.

Pretty good. Instead of using the soy milk and coconut I just used a can of coconut water with the little chunks of coconut floating in it. It turned out really well. It's better the next day, though, after the flavors have had a chance to develop.

This was OK.  I agree with the other reviews; it was a little bland.  I added coconut milk and ground cumin which helped add more flavor.  Also you will need at least 4 cups of water to boil the lentils in.

Very yummy... I also used 1/2 can of coconut milk instead of soymilk, added a pinch of garam masala and will toss in some cooked rice next time for a little more substance.

It was good enough to eat, but I can't say it's my favorite dish. I made a few modifications to bring it up to 4 stars. If I hadn't made these changes it would be extremely bland. I used coconut milk instead of soy milk, I used unsweetened coconut shreds (it doesn't specify, but this is what I had in the house), I added a tsp of cinnamon, a lot of Kosher salt (REALLY needed salt), a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp more of curry powder. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow as another reviewer suggested?

Awesome!!!  Hard to beleive something so healthy, gluten and dairy free can be soooooooo good! AND easy to make.  Will become a regular in my house for sure!  I used a whole tin of coconut milk instead of the other liquids (left the water for the lentils the same) and doubled all the seasonings including the ginger.  MMMM mmmm.

Pretty good, but needs a touch more flavor and more liquid for sure. I'd up it to 3 cups water AND 1 cup soy milk. OR you can do what I did, add about 1/2 cup apple juice. Adds liquid and more flavor depth.

YUMMY, I have love in my tummy!  Following other reviewers suggestions I used 4c up chicken stock instead of water and used a can of coconut milk instead of the soy milk.  I also added 1 tbsp of salt.  I used red curry paste instead of curry powder. Finally, I garnished the soup with fresh cilantro before eating.  I love this recipe and will make it in the future.

Excellent recipe.  Only change I mad was to add 2 celery stalks and  1 cup of diced tomatoes for extra substance. Will definitely make again.

Really tasty -- made this as a quick dinner when I had nothing else in the cupboard.  Had no ginger - so I sprinkled a little bit of pumpkin pie spice, used chicken broth instead of water for the lentils and used more of it as I had it on too high for the first bit.  Instead of soy/coconut blend I used a can of coconut milk.  It was great, easy and fast.  I liked that it was made from staples I always have on hand.

Great dish - tasted as good or better than many of the Indian restaurants' lentil dishes I've had here in Chicago.  My lack of expertise at shredding the coconut made this a lenghty prep dish, but it was worth it in the end.  Very healthy, and high in protein.

Tasted nothing like the coconut lentil soup I had in a restaurant and thought was delicious. This was just ok with a strong taste of curry.

This was just...weird.  My boyfriend liked it, but I don't know how I feel about it.  It was just okay...I changed the recipe quite a bit to even get it to taste okay.

I liked the recipe, but next time i will use coconut milk instead of real coconut and soy milk. the coconut taste wasn't very prominent. I also used about 4 cups of water with the lentils. All inall, it was a great recipe

This is a nice soup but needs more seasoning than the recipe. I made with coconut milk instead of soy milk. A little salt and curry paste and more garlic and then very tasty!

This soup has potential but it needs work.  It was very thick and not very flavourful despite using coconut milk instead of soy milk as many have suggested.  It needs a lot more liquid and more flavour.  I like the concept so I plan to try again.

I did not have red lentils s I used regular lentils. I don't now if it makes a difference or not since I have never had red lentils. I too used coconut milk and coconut. The flavors were good. I will try it with red lentils next time.

I made 6 servings (1 1/2 times the recipe ingredients) for a 454g pack size of red lentils.  Very flavorful with the following modifications:  6 cups chicken stock instead of water, one diced white onion (did not have red), 2 cloves minced garlic, and lots of grated ginger, 1 1/2 tbsp. red curry powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper and bring to boil.  Simmer for 20 minutes covered, add 2 tbsp. finely chopped cilantro, 1/3 cup dried coconut (did not have fresh).  Continue simmering for 10 minutes with lid on.  Add 1 can coconut milk, heat and serve.  Beautiful!

This was pretty tasty, if a little on the bland side. Like another reviewer, I used coconut milk in place of the soy milk/shredded coconut and it seemed to work fine. I also reduced the cooking time by 10 minutes and my lentils still turned to mush.

I made the recipe as suggested, however used regular milk in place of soy milk. I also added some cinnamon and cumin to give it more flavor since other readers said it was kind of bland. It tasted horrible!!! I was so tempted to throw it out but decided to wait. Put it in the fridge overnight and the next day it tasted much better! I wasn't a big fan of the shredded coconut; it made the dish too sweet, and I think next time I will either reduce the amount or omit it entirely.

I added a couple of teaspoons of chicken base and, eventually, some garlic salt.  It was pretty bland otherwise.  I also used dried, unsweetened coconut which I soaked in the soy milk to soften before I pureed.  I'll try the coconut milk next time and increase the garlic.  I did, however, like the taste combinations.  Will serve with plain yogurt, of course.

I thought this recipe was fairly good.  It was yummy, but it didn't wow me.  I used light coconut milk in place of the fresh coconut and milk, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and may try it again as originally indicated.
