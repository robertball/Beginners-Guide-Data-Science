Here are some things to know about meringue that will help you if you are unclear about some of the directions in this recipe.   1) Make sure you have completely seperated the yolk from the white... the slightest bit of yolk will break down you whites.   2) Make you your mixing bowl is 100% GREASE FREE!!!  Very important! 3) Keep your eggwhites at ROOM TEMP before you beat. 4) Begin beating the egg whites slowly, increasing speed when they are frothy and beating until soft peaks just begin to form. Continue beating, slowly adding the sugar and then the cornstarch mixture. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, this takes a little time. Egg whites are "STIFF" when the beaters leave ridges in the whites and they are glossy and hold a stiff peak when the beaters are lifted out. 5) It is VERY important to beat your eggwhites completely and not stop until you are ready to put on the pie.  Meringue starts to deflate within 5 minutes of turning off the mixer.  Hope this helps!!

If you try nothing else, you HAVE to try this recipe!  One word:  Awesome!  

For others, like myself, who are "dummies" at meringue making, I want to point out a few things about this recipe.  

First of all, it is super easy to make!  

The cornstarch mixutre (preparation), can be tricky!  My mixture never did turn clear.  I followed the directions to a T.  After about 10 minutes, I gave up, and simply removed it from the heat, as directed.  I did cook it on low, and although it never did get clear, it worked, beautifully!  I would suggest this:  Cook it on low, as directed, and if it never does go clear, remove it from the heat, after about 5 minutes.  

The recipe did not state what speed to put the beater on.  I would suggest hi.  As far as how long to actually beat the egg white mixture, that is tricky, too.  NOT being familiar with meringue, I beat it on hi for ten minutes!  It said to beat, until "stiff."  One persons definition of stiff, may not be the same as someone elses!  So, with that said, I would recommend beating it, maybe, 5 or 6 minutes.  

This made a delectible meringue!  It was super easy to fix, and more than covered my pie! It peaked, beautifully, just as it should, and I took a picture of it!! 

I put it in the oven on 350 for 17 minutes, exactly!    

Meringue II, as the recipe is called, just doesn't get it!  This recipe deserves a much better name, and an award!

Try it, you'll love it!

At last a meringue that does not weep!! I have tried so many different meringues that weren't supposed to weep and of course they always did. Tried using the extra fine sugar and it helped but did not prevent the weeping.This one truly does not weep and tastes excellent. Thank you for posting this Saundra. This is the one I will continue to use.

This was the best meringue recipe ever. My mom was AMAZED by it!!! I messed up the first time I made it by not letting the corn starch thicken enough.... but my fault completely and the next 3 times I made it it came out perfect and delicious. The "extra step" is more than worth it...

This was my first try at meringue, and I researched carefully before trying this recipe.  My husband had told me he didn't like meringue -- after eating my lemon meringue pie (made with Lemon Meringue Pie III from this website) he asked for another piece and said he must not have ever had good meringue!  My mother and mother-in-law were amazed that I had made a meringue with such a perfect consistency and that didn't weep!  Use this recipe, you won't regret it.  Also refer to the "Perfect Meringue" article you can find on allrecipes.

OMGosh!! I am "merinqueingly" challenged to say the least!  I thought this one sounded like a winner and boy-howdy was it ever!  I cut back on the vanilla by 1/2 and may use a little less sugar next time but this one is printed and in my cookbook for ever now. Thanks!

This was truly the PERFECT meringue recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and couldn't have been happier. No weeping, it held up beautifully over the weekend in the fridge, and the taste/texture was superb! This will be the only meringue recipe I will use from now on.

This is a beautiful meringue that went together easily and turned out pic (see my photo with this recipe to see how dreamy it is).  I followed the recipe to a t and got rave reviews both times I have used it.

A little more work than regular meringue, but definitely worth it.  Made for an excellent, non-weepy topping for Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie.  Even used an extra egg white, but kept the remaining measurements the same.  Browned in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes -- perfect.  Thanks!

the meringue looked nice but flatened out as time went on,and it took a long time for the cornstarch mix to get somewhat clear.

I'm giving this five stars for the texture, & for the fact that it did not shrink or weep at all! Sounds like more work than it actually is, once I got started it was much easier than I'd anticipated so I'll probably try it again but cut the vanilla in half & use even a smaller pinch of salt.

Perfect!  I don't even really like meringue but this recipe is so tasty.  I made this first before making a coconut cream pie.  I read how the meringue won't slide off the pie if you top the pie while the filling is hot off the stove.  I then baked the pie and the meringue together for about 13 minutes.  It turned out so perfectly, it made me look like a professional.  Thank you for the recipe!

WOW!!!!! Ditto all the glowing reviews. I will fear meringue no longer, because this one did not disappoint. Quality control at last :) My best tip is to BEAT very well. It should be unquestionably stiff; if you are not sure, keep beating, because this recipe is not as sensitive to overmixing as traditional meringue is.

It took me a lot longer than I thought to make this - I, like some others thought I had done something wrong at one point, but it turns out great.  I had hubby put my chocolate pie in the oven for about the last 5 minutes of meringue beating because I was worried that it was cooling off too much, I wanted a good seal on a hot pie.  When meringue was ready, I took the pie out of the oven, put the beautiful meringue on and sealed to the edges well.  After baking, it was beautiful - I thought I would cry!  After 5 hours though, the meringue separated from the crust completely - before the Birthday boy had a chance to see its beauty!  I was devastated - UNTIL - we tasted it.  Heavenly taste.  No weeping, just some shrinking.  While eating the pie, we all voted, and decided if I couldnt figure out how to fix the shrinking next time - We didnt care.  Love the flavor and texture of this meringue - Thank you so much!

I always avoided making pies with meringue because my meringues ALWAYS shrink and weep.  NOT ANYMORE!  I'm amazed that the cornstarch mixture makes such a difference in the success of the meringue.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I might have done something wrong, but it wasn't the melt-in-your-mouth bubbly fluff that I expected from meringue.  It was more (both in texture and flavor, but I most likely messed up on the texture) like whipped marshmallow topping.  It was still really good! But it ended up making my pie a bit too rich since I already made the filling super sweet.

This meringue really doesn''t weep or shrink. I made 2 pies and put them in the frig overnight.  Both pies looked great the next day. No shrinking  or weeping.  It has a nice sweet vanilla flavor too and was easy to make.

I LOVE this recipe!  I used it to top lemon cupcakes filled with lemon curd.  I had made the recipe for the meringue that came with the cupcake recipe but it was too soft and sloppy which made eating the cupcakes a mess!  this recipe is so nice and firm and comes together so easily.  It is definitely a keeper!
Thanks to Saundra for the recipe and to Sarah and Beth for their tutorials!

I increased the serving size until i got to the amount of extra egg whites I had left over from my Lemon part of a Lemon Meringue Pie (Grandmas Lemon Meringue Pie recipe)...I just figured it would make extra Meringue. From there I followed the directions exactly. What could go wrong with extra meringue right??? It is SOOOOO good (browning right now). My only pause was how long did it take to get the cornstarch mixture clear. It never really did turn clear but it did turn VERY thick. But it was super smooth so I continued to follow the recipe and seems like all is perfect. This meringue taste NOTHING like other meringue. I may never use cool whip again...it is THAT good. Not to mention how fun it is to mix up with my Kitchen Aid Mixer!

This Meringue recipe was perfect. I have made 4 meringues. the first one turned out great! the other 2 were sloppy in terms of the meringue.  This one as, the first one, I followed the recipe perfectly.  My utensils as well as my glass bowl.   Stick with this recipe, really works best  get the meringue to peak.

This is so good, I dare say tastes better than the pie filling it covers!  One tip, my hubby made it the first time trying to whip by hand with a wire whisk, poor guy!  First try was white mush.  Once I advised him to use an electric mixer he had success.  We brown the tips of the meringue on Lo Broil for about a minute to get the top brown then turn to Hi Broil to get the darker tips.

Excellent meringue!  My mother's recipe has not been working - bad weeping, deflating, pulling away by the next morning, and beads of liquid all across the surface of the meringue.  So we tried this new recipe.  Beautiful when it came out (the browned areas taste like toasted marshmallows) but the overnight test is the true test; and it came out gorgeous then, too!  Barely lost any height, did not pull away from the crust AT ALL, and no puddle of liquid where we'd ate our pieces the night before!  The meringue was still a couple inches tall the next day.  Our only modification was to use baker's sugar for the last 6 tablespoons (rather than regular granulated) and we used 4 egg whites instead of 3 (because our filling had used 4 yolks).  Throw away all your other meringue recipes.  This one is the the KEEPER!

I will never put whipped cream on my banana pudding again! It holds up in the fridge and keeps my pudding from turning to soup the way whipped cream does. Not only that but I took it to a ppotluck and didnt have to keep it refridgerated until the last minute like whipped topping. Its as good as it gets and sooo easy! I add a little blackwalnut extract and then topped with toasted walnuts and it got rave reviews. Thanks!!

Just tried this out. It is perfect in every way. The amounts of ingredients is enough to cover 2 pies. My wife loved the taste and it was her first time of watching it made ever before. I'm the cook and baker in our home. So if it is your first time of making this don't give up keep beating it till you pull your beaters out and they make peaks. I didn't ever get the cornstarch mixture to clear up so I just put it in and it worked just fine.

I topped "Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie" from this site with this meringue, based on another user's review.  It was a huge hit!  I never got the cornstarch/sugar mixture totally clear, but I would say that it was translucent.  Other than that, I made it exactly as stated.  To the question of when to top the pie (hot or cooled): I began *making* the meringue just after I had poured the lemon filling into the crust, so it was partially cooled when I topped it with meringue.  There was no weeping at all, and my family said it was the best meringue they had ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

What do you do when you don't have Cool Whip??  Make this EASY meringue! This turned out AWESOME as a "frosting" for Jenny's Black Forest Cake (on this site). We also added some food coloring to the meringue for our daughter's birthday.  We set aside some of the meringue in a baggie, added different food coloring, cut the corner of the baggie and used it to "write" on top. Hope to add a picture asap to show how it turned out!

I dunno what I did wrong!!  I followed the directions exactly. The pie looked so pretty when I put the meringue on and browned it, but by the next day, the meringue shrank and was full of beads.  I thought this recipe was supposed to prevent that.

Super yummy and foolproof for a beginner.  I had a little bit of weeping when I refrigerated it, and a few more beads on the second day, but nothing major.  I used this with Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie from this site, and tossed in the extra white.  Was more than enough filling to cover a 9" pie.  Thanks a lot for the awesome recipe!!

This was my first attempt at meringue, and after following the recipe EXACTLY, it turned out perfectly!  I almost gave up, because after beating for what felt like an etermity, my mixture wasn't getting "stiff"...give it time, and it will!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was a great recipe. It was easy to make. It made plenty of meringue. It was piled high. YUM!! It did pull away from the crust a little bit. I have had this problem with other meringues so I know it is not due to this recipe. It must be how I am sealing it. The flavor was good. It took along time (25 mins) beat into stiff peaks but well worth it. Will be using this meringue again.

Holy Moly is this a great meringue recipe!  I had great success and felt very proud of my beautiful chocolate pie at the Christmas dinner table.  Like others, my cornstarch/sugar/water did not turn clear, but did become more transparent as the mixture thickened.  I followed the recipe to a T and beat it in my large stand mixer (hands free).  It set up quickly, looked beautiful and had a great taste--not too sweet.  I did brown mine in the oven slightly and it DID NOT WEEP!!!!  I feel like a professional now.  Thanks for the recipe and this will be the only way that I make meringue again.

I have never been a huge meringue fan, but this recipe is outstanding.  I topped a lemon meringue pie with it and it was a huge success - I got more compliments on the meringue than the pie itself.  This will now become my go to recipe for meringue!

Good Gracious! Where has this recipe been all these years! This has to be the most perfectly designed recipe for meringue I have ever tried. Pie meringue is the hardest thing to get right but this recipe makes it easy. I have had trouble for years trying the get that perfect meringue my mom use to make. Now, finally, I have found the ultimate recipe. If you are afraid of trying a meringue in the past, have no fear anymore! This is just plain perfection! Thank you, Sandra, so much for sharing this with us!

Beautiful!  Makes a lot.  A little too sweet for my taste.  And sorry, but it does weep.  Still I would make again, but without as much sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I cannot believe how wonderful this meringue is!  It should be called "Miracle Meringue".  Not only is there not a "tear" in sight  since yesterday; it tastes wonderful.  I will never use another recipe.  Thank you so much..................even my daughter in law who is the "official pie baker" in this household, was  very impressed and asked me to please file the recipe away for her!

EXCELLENT.. Is definitely fluffy and very creamy flavor. I added a little  lemon juice right at the end of beating to add a zing. Made to top a lemon pie

My first attempt of a meringue pie and I used this recipe! It was perfect. My husband and family commented on how light and tasty it is. Now to conquer a coconut cream pie and, of course, meringue on top! Yummy!!!

I had never made meringue before. It looks beautiful! No weeping, no shrinking. However, I never did get the first step to be clear, so I just added it after about 10 minutes of cooking it.

I had a hard time getting peaks to form but I think that it's probably my fault. This is the first time I've made meringue and even though it wasn't perfect, it tasted amazing!

I didn't whip this long enough, but it turned out great! Loved the taste. I will reduce the sugar a bit next time. This reminded me of some pies purchased in a grocery store. I like the fact it wasn't so foamy / airy where you squish it down with your tongue to nothing.

This was my first time making meringue so I didn't really know what to expect in the process of making it.  First of all, the recipe doesn't tell you what speed to whip it, and I always whip everything on low, so I was standing there forever starting to get worried b/c it wasn't getting thick.  Finally I turned it up to hgh and right away it started thickening up!  So, make sure you whip the meringue in a stainless steel bowl on HIGH, and it will thicken.  I made it to put over a lemon pie and put it in the oven for 20 minutes and it got lightly browned.  I wanted the meringue to be a little harder, b/c it was more soft and fluffy, but since it was my first meringue I was quite happy w/ it! And it tasted great! Thank you!

Wow!!What a great Meringue!! I've been looking for a meringue that would not weep.And one that would really taste good.So this is a keeper!I had a huge Banana Pudding to make for a cookout and this Meringue was such a hit.I piled it on the pudding thick and it held up so good on a hot day too.I made so much I had to 4 times the ingredients.It came out wonderful!And don"t worry if it don't cook clear it still works.I cooked mine for about 20 minutes or so until it thickened somewhat.I also put 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of the two called for.This ones a WINNER!

Wow!  I have a novice cook/baker and this turned out perfect for me!!  I bought a new Kitchenaid mixer and was dying to use it, so I made a chocolate meringue pie.  The meringue (of which I sometimes like) was AMAZING!  The taste was that of a yummy marshmallow - not too sugary at all.  This was VERY easy to make (esp. will my mixer).  I used the comments of others and kept the mixer in the saucepan on low (constantly stirring) for 5 mins, as mine did not come out clear either.  Also, I constantly beat on high in the mixer until foamy and continued beating as I added the saucepan mixer and slowly added the sugar too.  AMAZING!  Definately a keeper...my family was very impressed!

My first time making a meringue, and it turned out beautifully. I used it for Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie (recipe on this site), and it's perfect. I made the pie this evening, and we're already starting to eat it...if there's any left, I'll check in the morning to see if there's any weeping.

The meringue layer separated from my pie, but I think that's because the filling had cooled by the time I got the meringue made...apparently, it's best to put on the meringue when the filling is still hot. Doesn't take away from the presentation or flavor however, and that was my mistake, so this recipe still gets 5 stars!

This Meringue makes the most beautiful pie.  I wanted to impress my mother-in-law to be with her favorite Coconut Cream Pie and this meringue made it look like something out of a magazine. And it was delicious too.

This is the best meringue. Like other reviewers meringues are not my speciality. But they are now. Worth the extra steps.I use this with lemon meringue pie 3 which I double to make 2 pies therefore I double this reciepe. You will have an extra yoke do'nt worry just follow the rest of the receipe as it is and it will be perfect. Enjoy :)

How clear does the cornstarch, sugar and water have to be after cooking it? What texture should it have? I ended up with a very thick goo...which I grradually added to the egg whites.

Easy, just takes a long while for the stove top mixture to turn clear. Don't overcook as it will get real thick and then its difficult to whip. Worth the effort.

Great taste! I don't think I beat mine long enough though. It probably should have been stiffer, but I was worried about over beating. However, I just read a review that said that this recipe is hard to over beat, and if in doubt, keep beating! So next time I will. I did put mine in the oven for about 13 min. at 350. Worked out great.

This recipe is phenomenal.  I doubled it and it was a little too sweet for our liking.  Next time we will try reducing the sugar by one third.

Browned it for 20 minutes at 350.

The meringue is gorgeous.  Makes for a very impressive pie!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I haven't made meringue since I was about 12 years old and I'm 23 now. It took longer to form peaks than I remember and I was starting to worry that I did something wrong. But it eventually got stiff and not only does it look beautiful on top my banana cream pie, but it tastes delicious! Thanks you!

4 stars and not 5 because i thought that the vanilla flavor was overwhelming (i followed the recipe exactly, next time i'll use half as much vanilla).  it's true, this meringue did not weep, i did however get some beading on the top.  the thing that perplexed me most was after the pie was cut the meringue didn't seem to want to stay on top of the lemon filling... it had the tendency to slide off.  anyone have any ideas on why this might have happened?  i followed directions for the filling and meringue to a tee.

I didn't have Creme of Tartar so I substituted lemon juice and it still turned out OK for me.  I made the cornstarch goo in the microwave.  It doesn't get transparent, more like translucent.  It is a very good idea.  It made the meringue very stable.  Even 20 minutes later the uncooked meringue that was left in the bowl was still puffed up.    Thanks for the recipe.  I will do this for all recipes requiring meringue.

Great recipe - the only thing it doesn't tell you is how long to put it in the oven. I followed another reviewer's  advice on that - came out perfect!

No beading up! Turned out nice and toasty brown! I only had one problem...the Meringue pulled away from the crust, even though I sealed the edges well. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Hopefully this won't happen next time. I got many compliments on the taste. Thank!

This is the first meringue recipe I have used that really looked good and tasted better than it looked.  I used four egg whites and the recipe made enough meringue to cover two chocolate pies.  My eight year old granddaughter loves this, too. LPogue

so i had 4 pies to make in a little under 3 hours.  i thought i messed up the meringue when i added the cornstarch directly to the egg whites while they were beating.  as it turns out, they held out fine and i had the most beautiful meringue!  used with grandma's lemon meringue pie!  it was awesome!

I followed the recipe to a T but it still had dew on the top the next morning.    The taste made up for it though, it's like toasted marshmallows.  Topped Grandma's Lemon Meringue pie.

I loved this recipe - it was wonderful.  I doubled it though, as is would not be enough for one pie in my opinion - but that depends on how thick you want it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This meringue is fantastic!!! It completely filled my mixing bowl. My daughter in law who is a wonderful cook was impressed and remarked about how good it tasted.  Will find a good recipe for the lemon part  though, it was not as tasty.

Best meringue ever!  And I don't like the traditional,  egg and sugar meringue for several reasons:  weepy,  shrinks from crust,  flat,  dense,  egg tasting.

But I made this for a coconut cream pie,  and it's the best one I've ever had.  Like toasted marshmallow creme. 

I followed the directions to the letter.  And had no problems whatsoever.  But that's because I've been baking for 20 years.  The recipe is kind of vague on a couple key points.  I'll include my clarifications for anyone that's interested:

Place the cornstarch and sugar into a small saucepan,  BEFORE adding the water.  Then add water and stir it all together before you start the heat under pan.  If you add dry to liquid in a pan,  you've got problems.  Which may be catastrophic.
And cook it on medium heat,  stirring constantly until it thickens and becomes CLEARER.  It will never be transparent.  Think Vaseline opaqueness. 
Take off heat and set to the side while you prep the egg white part.  HOWEVER,  stir the starch mix from time to time so it stays consistent and does not form skin/lumps.

Then start beating up the egg white mixture.  The whites should be room temp.  They fluff up better that way.  You really do only need a pinch of salt.  It's not for flavor,  it's science to make the meringue stay firm.  

After adding everything -the starch mix can't be too hot or you'll cook the eggs- keep an eye on the texture of the meringue. If you beat it too much it will fall.  Just until it's glossy with stiff

This was terrible. I should have known adding water was a bad idea as it sweated out and made a mess everywhere and made the crust soggy. I  followed I followed the recipe exactly except where someone said the water never did turn clear so cook it for 10 min.  Don't know if this was the problem but really sorry I tried this really ruined my pie :(

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!!!  Every time I wanted to make a pie with meringue to take somewhere I was in search of the "perfect" meringue recipe. It never failed that the meringue would weep, even though it looked gorgeous... I just made two lemon pies in a matter of days...the first one looked pretty and tasted okay but the crust got soggy from the weeping meringue.  Then I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I will use this recipe from now on!  I made the meringue exactly according to the recipe and it couldn't be more perfect...looked beautiful, tasted great, and best of all, IT DIDN'T WEEP!!!! I was amazed.  I could hardly wait to get up this morning to peek in the refrigerator to see if it had totally deflated and wept during the night.  I was elated to find not one drop of moisture, the meringue is still thicker than the pie filling, and another added bonus is the meringue doesn't feel rubbery like a lot of meringues.  I am completely satisfied with this recipe and will make cream pies with meringue with a new-found confidence!!!  This is definitely a winner!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

You stole the picture of my chocolate meringue pie from my Instagram feed.  I know this is my picture-- I compared it side by side to my photo.   Why did you do that?  The recipe you list is not the same as what the meringue picture (that you stole) shows.

I normally don't write reviews, but this one was worth it.  I thought that weeping meringue was just something I would always have to deal with.  I even remember my grandmother and the other older ladies at my church (best cooks I've ever known) lamenting over their weeping meringue during potlucks.  If only they were still here for me to share this recipe with.  I really didn't believe it was possible, but it doesn't weep, tastes great and holds up well.  The only change I might make next time is to double everything.  I'm used to really high meringue and this wasn't quite enough and looked a little flat (just a personal preference, it still looked pretty though).  Thanks again for sharing!

I have made this meringue for 15 years and since and making this recipe, I will never use another recipe. Get the tips from Sarah at the most reviews and you will do just fine. Enjoy.

I never will use another meringue recipe again.  I have tried several other concoctions and this is by far the best no matter what dish it is paired with.

In the past when I said I hated meringue on my lemon pie, I absolutely meant it. I had always found it too goopy and spongy. Today, because of this recipe, that sentiment has changed. I can now say I LOVE it. This recipe is fantastic and is now my go to recipe for meringue. This does not weep and is velvety in texture. I followed the rcipe to the letter however one thing I must note - The recipe does state to cook the cornstarch mixture on the stove until clear, mine never went clear I think it would be better to say translucent....I cooked it for approximately 5 minutes and it had the consistency of lemon curd. 
Try it, you won't be disappointed.

The meringue did hold up better with this recipe... and did not weep. But to me, it kind of had the consistency more of a marshmallow cream, which I didn't care for. Think I'll go back to just adding the cream of tartar.

Wonderful recipe! Worked even without the cream of tartar and -more surprisingly- without an electric mixer. That's right, with just a metal bowl and a whisk (and lots of elbow grease, of course)!

Looks beautiful, tastes delicious. Awaiting dessert to cut, but it's perfect in my book! I can't imagine why many could not get the water, cornstarch and sugar to clear. In minutes I had beautifully clear syrup. Replaced this recipe for my mother-in-law's recipe that I've been using for 20+ years.

Used 4 large eggs instead of three. Followed recipe to the T otherwise. Cornstarch syrup doesn’t get clear, but does turn opaque and quite thick. I put this on top of a banana pudding and toasted with a torch. This was absolutely delicious!! I had never made a meringue before... turned out perfect!!

I have used this recipe twice and am about to use it again. It is strange with the cornstarch mixture! The second time I made it, I was doing several things at once and that mixture got gooey and clumpy. I thought I might have ruined the meringue, but didn't have time to redo it. 

Nope. It was just fine!

This meringue is simple, holds up well and is delicious! I made it to try to recreate my grandmother's chocolate meringue pie for my mom. I don't usually like meringue, but I enjoyed it completely!

This does make an excellent stable meringue.  I was somewhat hesitant about adding so much of the water, sugar, cornstarch mix.  It seemed like a lot of liquid to add. But as it was being slowly incorporated in to the egg white mixture, the magic happened and it became this amazing meringue.  It also refers to the water, sugar and cornstarch moisture as becoming clear.  I think a better word is smooth or dissolved.  There is nothing that would make it clear like water.

I have made meringue several times and have never really had an issue ( thank you KitchenAid ). This was a very different way to make meringue, although it was a bit more work,  it blended well and seemed to firm up faster. I never rush cooking because, to me, it is a meditation.  The end result was more dense than traditional versions, but that isn't a bad thing! Thank you SAUNDRA! I will use your method again for sure!

Don't change anything with this recipe. Perfect as it is. It does take cooking the cornstarch awhile before it comes nearly clear.  It was beautiful and delicious.  Next time I'm doubling the recipe so I can eat more of this yummy stuff. I did brown mine in a 350 oven for 15 as recommended by another reader.

I followed the recipe and also took into account the review by Sarah (11/21/09) to make sure mixing bowl was super clean,  and the egg-whites sat at room temperature for several minutes.  Also liked the review by Beth (9/12/07).  

Conclusion....Turned out perfect!!!

Lies! All lies! I was really hopeful this would be the meringue that did weep. Nope. Directions were followed exactly. Within 2 hours at room temperature, it had shrunk (in height, not away from sides) by half. Watery mess when the pie was cut. I officially throw in the towel on meringue.

This is the best meringue i have ever made. It holds up really good. I did read the most helpful review first and this helps.  My sister ate a pie i made with this meringue,  5 days later and could not get over how good it tasted and still held up so well. Very impressive recipe.  My go to recipe for meringue always!!!!

made as written. the cornstarch mixture is not clear like water however, you will have no doubt that it is clear compared to the thin milky white mixture it starts out as. cook until it thickens and it will be like a silver grey color. then you will understand the " clear " best meringue I have had. this will be my recipe for meringue from now on

Will never use another meringue recipe again. Fluffy, glossy, and tasty. Didn't fall flat, though I did have to double the cream of tarter before it became stiff enough to suit me. Keeper recipe for sure!

I made this for Easter.  It was very good, and as advertised, does not weep.....a big plus.  However,  cooking the cornstartch syrup on low heat until it clears took over 1/2 hour.  I eventually raised the heat to get it to clear.  Then, when adding the syrup to the foamy egg white mixture, again it took forever for stiff peaks to form.  So, while this is very good, it takes a lot longer than advertised to make.

This is the first time i've made meringue, and this recipe was easy to follow.  I only used the three serving size because I just wanted a small amount on my pie. Turned out nice and tastes awesome. I used the broiler to brown it a little, (May have gotten it a little too brown)--oops! Definitely need to practice my peak making skills! All in all I'm satisfied.

Easy to make and pretty but it really is more a marshmallow creme than a meringue.  

Edit/Update the next day:  Ok, changing my rating based on magic that happened overnight.  My husband and I both agreed yesterday that the meringue was rather too similar to marshmallow creme which was not what we were looking for to top our Christmas pie.

Come Christmas dessert... its texture is different today!  Not sure if it has to do with the browning or sitting overnight but today it is much better!  Good in fact!

I topped my Cherry Cream Pie with this meringue and so far this looks like a good recipe. I've given it 4 stars since the meringue did go a little flat, but maybe it's due to not beating it long enough.  So far no shrinkage on the sides.  The meringue is firm and looks nice.  We try it tomorrow at our Christmas Eve dinner so we'll see what everyone thinks about it.  I had no problems with the corn starch, water and sugar mixture turning translucent while cooking.  It only took about 3 minutes with constant stirring.

i cooked this a while. It never got completely clear and it congealed while I was beating the egg whites.  I beat in a few lumps of it and it looks okay.  haven't eaten any yet.

This was very good, even though I did have a tiny bit of weepiness. After so many terribly weepy meringues, I am not going to complain. I have read that every meringue pie made in the White House has a layer of soft white bread crumbs to soak up any weepiness, and just a few crumbs would have taken care of any weeping for me.

This is the best meringue ever!!!! It doesn't turn weepy.  I've made it on numerous pies and have never had a problem with it. I follow the direction exactly and it always turns out perfectly! I do wish the directions said what degree to bake it and for how long. I followers other people's advice and went 350 for about 20 mins.

--a very good meringue that "keeps" very well.  Make sure you beat the egg whites so that they are stiff.  I like to brown it in the oven too.

I have had weepy watery meringue ruin my pies for years. But no longer! This recipe is THE PERFECT MERINGUE RECIPE! Thank you Saundra! And not only was the meringue BEAUTIFUL, the pies this Thanksgiving didn't need to be "drained" to remove all the water. AND, I could still cut through the meringue 4 days later without it bunching up resulting in an ugly mess on top of the pie. Also, I went to Wikipedia to find out why we need to add cream of tartar to meringues. Their explanation is "stabilizing egg whites, increasing their heat tolerance and volume". I decided to leave cream of tartar out and my meringue was fine. The corn starch mixture could be the reason why cream of tartar isn't needed. Unless I get information that it would help my meringues, I plan to continue to not add it.

I have made this several times and it is perfect.  I believe the instruction should say to cook the cornstarch mixture until it boils and not until clear.  You make this mixture the same way you make cooked pudding.

It tasted great and went together in a snap, but mine did weep a little once I refrigerated the leftovers. It also was a bit "softer" than I would have wanted. I suppose I would have preferred "spongier." I will still use it again.

Excellent recipe! As noted by others....my cornstarch mixture never did go clear either. I cooked it as directed for about 10 minutes and then carried on. Turned out perfectly! :-)

Very good. I used it on the top of my key lime pie and it sealed the deal. The sweetness of the meringue balanced the sourness of the pie. Thanks!

While this was a bit more tedious in preparing, it was well worth the extra effort.  I got in a hurry and was trying to make the constarch mixture while whipping the egg whites and I'd recommend making the cornstarch mixture THEN working on the egg whites.  A more harmonious outcome! :)  Meringue is beautiful...My girl's clapped as I was removing it from the oven and it didn't shrink.  Beautiful, high, fluffy meringue...FINALLY!

I just made this with "Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie" from this site.  Holy cow!  Not only was it perfect for lemon meringue pie but bonus, it is a pretty forgiving recipe.  It was huge to start with and after cooling a few hours did sink a little.  HOWEVER, flavor was awesome and still had the volume that any lemon meringue pie should have.  Excellent.  Will make this recipe every time!  Thanks for posting.

The recipe is wonderful!!! I used it for a banana pudding that I made (my recipe called for a different meringue technique but it kept 'weeping' on me).  Even with me making errors during the process... I.e., over-cooking the cornstarch  mixture, and spilling part of my room-temperature eggs on the floor ( so I had part warm/ part cold eggs), it worked like a charm... It still turned out DELISH!!!

I had never made meringue before and this recipe was perfect. It made nice stiff peaks, had a great flavor, and browned nicely in the oven.
