I love eggs and I love avocados, so I just had to make this! I sauteed some onion, red pepper and a little garlic and scrambled the eggs. Once the egg mixture was done I topped it over the toast.  I used some shredded cheddar cheese vs. Parmesan as I had a little left on hand. I made two of these and mine was fabulous all by itself, but to my husband's I added a couple of strips of bacon to take it over the top (plus it was a good way to get my husband to give it a try)! This really is a delicious combination of flavors and "perfect" for a hearty breakfast!

Lol....so I thought I'd update this since I noticed the recipe has 'grated' parm vs. shredded. It was supposed to be shredded parmesan, which in my opinion tastes so much better and gives the freshness to the meal in addtion to the avocado. Hope this helps!

Thanks for the recipe, Britty! It was yummy just the way you wrote it, but I like my egg yolks runny to be sopped up with the bread. :). Andrea, these 5 stars are especially to counteract your strange review of anything you haven't tried, and S & P are a "given" for me. Any recipe on here is free to be tweaked as you wish, that's the beauty of the art of cooking, but it offends my sense of fairness to give anything the lowest rating if you didn't even try it. Reviews help me decide if I want to tweak it and how.

This was good for a quick and simple breakfast! I used regular white bread (that's all I had) and 1 egg, which I seasoned w/ salt and pepper while it was cooking. I think this would be great w/ some nice sliced tomatoes as well, but I'll try that next time.  All in all, this was good...filling and tasty, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty good! If you want to cut calories, simply eliminate the butter and spray your pan with either butter flavored or olive oil cooking spray. If you don't like cooking spray, simply use about a half teaspoon of butter. Give this one a try - I made mine with honey wheat toast and it was very good, healthy and nutritious!

This is excellent.  We used regular wheat bread and made a dijonaise sauce instead of straight up dijon by mixing half dijon and half mayo with freshly ground pepper.  Loved the flavors.

This recipe is even better if you fry the avocado lightly in olive oil before assembling the sandwich.

Really enjoyed this. 

I cooked the eggs overeasy leaving the yokes runny. Also I took another reviewers suggestion and added bacon which I heartily recommend. All in all a healthy and filling breakfast.

I tried because it called for Parmesan cheese, never thought to put that on an egg sandwich before and it was delicious. An egg sandwich for breakfast is a no brainer, I eat them all the time and quite often add avocado. Sometimes with bacon, sausage, cheese, even, heaven forbid home made mayo. I liked the fact that this sandwich didn't call for a food police size portion of avocado. 1/2 an avocado is perfect on a sandwich for me unless I want more and then I'll add more. I have to agree with some previous reviewers, why criticize something you won't make because you object to some nutritional facts? Flavor, comfort factor, health in that order is the way I cook all the time. If 36 grams of sat fat is enough to overcome you then try bacon fat, it has 40% less sat fat then butter. I use both depending on what I cook, Sometimes a combo of both. Happy taste buds = an important good quality of life for me. If there are any complaints about my cooking it usually comes from me. Great recipe Britty.

Love eggs and avocados together, I also added some nice garden tomato slices. I'll probably try this again for a quick breakfast, but leave the mustard off and keep my yolks over-easy, I just like to sopp the egg up with the bread. :-)

I like the idea of breakfast sandwiches: very good for weekdays, or when you need a grab-n-go breakfast. Eggs, avacado, and mustard are a great combination; I scrambled the egg, added peppers & chopped tomato and wrapped in a tortilla to make this dish more portable for my daughter to take with her to school.

This was great and very easy!  Next time I may try spreading the bread with butter instead of the dijon and topping with pepperjack cheese.  Original recipe is excellent, though!

What a great idea!  I used only 1 egg and I forgot the mustard.  I also added some chopped tomato.  I put the egg on the bread first, then mashed everything else together and spread it on top of the egg.  It made a very filling breakfast.

I saw this recipe last night and made it this morning. We are a SCD family so I used almond bread which I make and it was delicious! The avocados came from a friends tree, Yum. The bread was the only thing I changed, We LOVED it and will make it again. Thanks  for posting  Britty .

I make a version of this same breakfast. One day, all I had was raisin bread. It was a delicious combination with the mustard. I also like to add some crispy lettuce. It adds a nice contrast to the soft avocado.

It's what I had for breakfast this morning, and it was delicious!  I used crisply toasted rustic grain bread  and skipped the mustard....because I just can't do mustard for breakfast. The parmesan makes it perfect. I will make this again and again.  Thank you, Britty.

Had all ingredients in the house so made this for hubby and me for Sunday brunch. Scrambled the eggs and served it with Mango Salsa. We both loved it and the flavours were excellent together! Very satisfying, pretty presentation with the salsa, super easy and quick to make.  I'm always searching for new recipes to make when we have guests and this ticks all the boxes. Thank you for sharing Britty.

I wrote a review on this, but it didn't show up. This is a good breakfast or snack dish. I used olive oil (lactose intolerant) and grated(hard) goat cheese. Will make this again, but will leave the mustard off. I like mustard with an egg sandwhich, but not so much with avocado. Thanks for sharing Britty.

I just made this for my boyfriend an I, and loved it! I used sprouted wheat bread and added turkey bacon. He said it was a "boss sandwich" and is an "instant classic" in our household now :) It not to often I get such a rave review on breakfast, thanks for the great recipe! It is going to be our pre-hike sammy from now on!!

Delicious easy way to change it up in the morning!  I see other suggestions for adds, but honestly don't overcomplicate it.  The nice delicate avocado could get lost.  This was a big hit!

Made this for breakfast this morning, LOVED it!  I even forgot the cheese yet it was soo good and easy.  I used Trader Joe's aioli garlic mustard sauce, just a smidge, rye bread from the bakery with no extra additives and the avocado with some sliced cherry tomatoes on the side. I made my one egg sunny side up with the yolk still runny.. yum yum yummy. Very filling, I could eat this many times a week and feel good about it, it's healthy. Next time I may add a little more aioli and some thinly sliced tomatoes.  This ones a keeper, thank you Britty

Delicious!  I did make the egg over easy as I like soft eggs rather than hard.  Loved the taste of the avocado on this sandwich.

Very tasty breakfast dish. I used only one egg (sautéed in a bit of olive oil) for each sandwich, and added a slice of Canadian bacon between the avocado and the egg.

I made it with oatmeal bread slice instead of sourdough (just to make it healthier). Tasted like a fancy deviled egg with the Dijon. I don't think it needs 2 tbsp of the parmesan. Next time I'll just use 1. Was so filling! Will definitely make again.

We loved it. I took some suggestions such as adding sliced (fresh local grown) tomato, used grated cheddar, buttered the toast (garlic/herb sourdough) and added equal amounts of Dijon and Mayonaise, 1/2 avocado, with organic bacon on the side. Delicious, fast and easy - and flexible.

I love this recipe, I used Dave's Killer bread which is a cinnamon/raisin  mix with whole oats and loads of fiber but sweet. I also used tomatoes, cucumber and the mix was perfect with the egg and avocado.

My husband said to make sure I save this recipe. I thought he may not like it without a sauce on top, but he loved the flavor the Dijon mustard gave it.  He has heart disease so I used egg whites only and through some seasoning into them.  And it is so easy!

This was amazing. I had to substitute ingredients to use what I had on hand. I made two servings and only used 3 eggs. Substituted items were: Sourdough to whole wheat bread, mustard to cilantro dressing from Trader Joes, and parmesan to feta cheese. I sprinkled some pink salt on the avocado. And I used half an avocado on each slice of toast. I didn't scramble up the eggs and I loved how it turned out. I sprinkled some pepper and dried oregano on top.

I halved the butter, cheese, and eggs to lighten this up a little, and it was delicious. I'm kind of iffy about Dijon mustard, but it really is great with this combination of flavors. Thank you for a great breakfast!

Delicious! The only things I added were  hot pepper flakes, a splooge of olive oil and lemon juice on top. Avacado toast is a staple at our house but the addition of the egg, parm, and digon mustard put it over the top.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this, and it was quite filling. I, too, like my eggs runny, so cooked them like that and served on English muffins as that's what I had on hand. Will make again, thanks for sharing!

I thought this was okay. To bring it to the 300 calorie range I halved all of the ingredients but the avocado. My issue was the dijon mustard didn't really seem to go with this. I think, it is better suited to a lunch sandwich. I also didn't love the parmesan and think cheddar or a softer cheese would have went better with this. I can see reworking this so it all comes together better. It just seemed like a lot of separate components. Maybe, scrambled eggs, mashed avocado, a softer cheese, and get rid of the spicy dijon, would be my changes. I like that this breakfast has 2 sources of protein and it was a break from my usual toast, English muffin, or low-cal muffin with coffee. Note: Video adds mayo, bacon, and tomato. May be the trick to this open faced sandwich/breakfast sandwich.

I liked this. I used olive oil in the pan, a wrap instead of bread so it could be eaten like a sandwich with less calories. The dejon mustard was a great kick.

This is good and easy.  Just gets cold fast.  I did give the avocado a quick hit in the microwave and it was room temp to begin with but still the sandwich was barely warm. If anyone has suggestions on heating, I would appreciate. Thanks in advance.

I love sour dough bread but unfortunately, did not have it on hand. I went with some slices of baquette bread that were 'on the way out'. I didn't toast, just softened up in the microwave for 11 sec. The Dijon mustard really added a good flavor boost. I did salt and pepper which I felt it needed.  Great combination for a filling and healthy breakfast or anytime meal! Thanks Britty -- good recipe!

You should really try this sandwich! This has become my all-time favorite sandwich. Everybody that I’ve made it for loves it too!   You can change it up many different ways.  The first time I made it, I went by the recipe. Since then, I’ve changed it up a bit depending on what I have available in the kitchen. Here’s how I’m eating it today -  might be my best one yet:
Toast  your bread (any bread will do, you don’t have to go out and buy a certain bread),  spread with Dijon mustard (again, use your favorite mustard, whatever you have in the fridge),  I had homemade pimiento cheese that I spread on top of the mustard, I had some leftover sautéed mushrooms, onions and red bell pepper  that went right on top of the pimento cheese,  fried egg (I use 1 per sandwich) seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with shredded Parmesan cheese went on top of the veggies and topped off with sliced avocados.  Oh my word!!! Be prepared to adore this open-faced sandwich!!  PS. My husband prefers his with some kind of meat, so I put a couple slices of ham or turkey sandwich meat or bacon on his and he also prefers another piece of toast on top instead of open-faced.   The variations are endless!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! My husband loves mustard so this was a nice surprise for him in the a.m. The only change I made was using 15 grain bread because that's what I had on hand. Rest stayed the same and it was a great, satisfying breakfast. Thanks for the idea!

When it comes to all things kitchen, I'm a novice, so I wouldn't have thought to put these together. Bread and eggs, yes, but not the avocado, and I was especially skeptical of the mustard. 
I ended up scrambling my eggs, and used quality stoneground deli mustard (it was all I had on hand), and added bacon, then ate it as a sandwich (broke my sourdough piece in half so I wasn't eating a monster sized sandwich). 

Really good. I tried the same concoction on toasted, buttered sourdough toast, and while still good, the flavor profile was not as complex. The mustard definitely DOES add something, tho if you spread it lightly you dont actually taste it.

Simple and a great combination that I would've never considered for breakfast.  I didn't have Dijon mustard so used the closest thing to it, horseradish mustard.  Plus I didn't have the parmesan cheese, but was still gobbled up by everyone.

Oh my gosh this really is a perfect breakfast! I made it exactly as written with 2 tiny differences: I used Oatnut bread for the toast, and I cooked the egg over-easy because I like a bit of runny yolk. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it is absolutely DELISH. It's so quick and easy that you can make it for yourself in minutes, but also so elegant that you could serve it at brunch for guests and be a kitchen star. Thank you so much for sharing it!

Add a layer of arugula and sliced tomatoes, then it's a 5 star rating! Yum!

Delicious! This has become my favorite east breakfast. I would have never thought to put Dijon mustard with eggs but it totally works. I did change it a little bit due lack of ingredients. Here's what I did: I used whole wheat toast instead of sourdough. I spread butter into the Dijon then mashed the avocado onto the toasted bread. Fried egg on top of that then put a couple slices of bacon and sprinkled feta cheese on top instead of parmesan . I made this for a friend and she absolutely loved it.

We liked it. Next time I'm going to use regular mustard instead of Dijon. I think I will like that better.

Very good and quick to prepare. Did not have sour dough bread but it would be better than the whole wheat baguette I used as a substitute

I followed the advice on the video, using small amounts of both Dijon mustard and mayonnaise. Rather than break up the eggs, I thought it was more attractive cooking the eggs over well.
