My husband LOVED this.  I did a couple of things differently.  I didn't have a Jalapeno so I used Sambal in the dressing for the heat.  I also finely minced the ginger and added that to the dressing instead of to the cabbage.  To be honest I didn't really measure the peanut butter - just a big scoop, the dressing is nice and thick and clings to the vegetables well.   Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor was excellent. Don't skimp on the sugar, it needs it. When I first tossed the slaw with the dressing I tasted it and it was out of this world delicious. Then I let it sit for an hour as the recipe called for and ended up with asian slaw soup. It was a sloppy, soggy mess that was not very appetizing. If I make this again and I probably will I will serve it right after I combine everything. UPDATE: I made this again last night and realized what probably went wrong for me. Last time I made this I julienned all the vegies and probably dressed the salad too much. This time I coarsley chopped everything and watched the amount of dressing I used and no more soupy slaw! I even let it sit for about 30 minutes and it was perfect. Tasty recipe!

Really, REALLY yummy! I used a bag of coleslaw mix (yes, I'm lazy), and green onions in place of the regular. Oh, also, I microplaned the ginger, and just combined it in w/ the dressing ingredients. LOVED the different textures and the bit of heat from the jalapeno. Great flavor...I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed the recipe very closely, except for using only 1/4 of an onion, I added the ginger and the jalapeno to the dressing, and I used dry roasted, unsalted peanuts (loved the crunch of the peanuts in this).  This salad "grew" on me.  It starts out OK, but then I found myself going back, and going back.  I think next time I will leave out the salt in the dressing.  I think this will make the dressing taste a tad sweeter and allow the ginger to come out more.  Salt can always be added in later, if desired.  Thanks for the idea!

Even though the flavours worked great together, I found it a tad too salty. I think one to two table spoons of soy sauce , less the additional teaspoon of salt would be sufficient .

I made this exactly as written.  The sauce is a little funky tasting for me, but everyone at the dinner party loved it and one guest asked to take the leftovers home.

Great basic recipe! The dressing was way too salty. Next time I'll leave out the salt. This time I added a 1/4c OJ to dilute it/ cut the salt. I used a shortcut with the veggies & subbed Trader Joe's "Healthy 8 chopped veggie mix".

Seriously nummy! I had half a cabbage to use and this did the trick. A couple of tweaks...I didn't have lime, just lemon and I prefer cashews over peanuts as suggested by the submitter. I used bragg soy seasoning as it has less sodium and I don't use white sugar in my cooking so I subbed honey. I love salty and spicy. Making this one again next week! Yum!!!! Thx prisci

Nice change from a vinegar coleslaw.  Only change I made was used green onions instead of a regular onion.  I also added an extra jalapeno because I wanted a little more kick.  Wonderful recipe!

This recipe is delicious!  I substituted coleslaw mix. I only had creamy peanut butter on hand, so I used that.  Don't be worried about the amount and consistency of the dressing if it looks like there's not enough or it's kind of thick looking.  That is exactly what mine was like and it covered the cabbage perfectly. Excellent mix of flavors.

Good recipe but if you think it's too salty buy the low sodium soy sauce.

This is a super bold tssting coleslaw and welcome change to mayonaise based coleslaw which I think is okay but not great.  I followed the recipe as written and it hits all the sweet savory tart and spicy notes that makes you go back for more. Very tasty!

Really like this recipe. I use a little extra sugar and also a little honey and Sriracha to the sauce. I also don’t use the jalapeños.

It was bursting with flavor, nearly too much. Don't get me wrong it was, Yum! It over shadowed our main dish of Mongolian meatballs. So, I would suggest making it the star of the show.

I also used the Sambal chili sauce and added more peanuts. We really like peanuts. This would also be good mixed with cold rice noodles for a summer salad with a few scallions on top. We ate it with the Korean Beef Tacos. Excellent combo!

I thought i would really like this, was just ok.  I think I was wanting something lighter, more refreshing or zesty tasting. I tried to add some white vinegar to add zip but still couldn't get the taste i wanted.

This "Asian-American Slaw With Peanuts and Jalapenos" was very good. I find the recipe hard to rate because I love the dressing, just not on coarsely chopped cabbage. I would have normally chopped the cabbage much finer except that one reviewer warned that this could result in a "sloppy, soggy mess." I think I would have liked this salad much better with less-coarsely-chopped cabbage. I have actually been looking for a recipe for this very delicious dressing for about 13 years. It tastes just like my favorite peanut-butter dressing served on the lettuce salad at my favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you prisci for sharing your recipe.

This is very good, though I found it to be a bit too salty even using low sodium soy sauce.  Next time I'll omit the regular salt.  Also, I would just comment that I believe the lime juice is essential.  I originally substituted unsweetened orange juice since I was out of limes but it just seemed to be missing something.  So I sent hubby to the store and was amazed at the difference two tablespoons of juice could make.  Thank you prisci for adding great new salad to my arsenal.

This was very good.  I substituted the onion for green onion and used blanched salted peanuts instead of dry roasted because that is what I had on hand.

This was absolutely delicious!!! My only change was swapping out 1/2 the cabbage for broccoli slaw and cashews instead of peanuts. I made a big batch and ate on it for 3 days, it held up well in the fridge. Along with the salad, I made the Firecracker Grilled Salmon from this site. Excellent pairing, a favorite meal at home.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly EXCEPT I used creamy peanut butter (I didn't have crunchy on hand) and I halved the amount of regular soy sauce used (if it was low-sodium I would have used the entire amount requested).  I also used part sesame oil and part olive oil (as the sesame oil was super strong).  I took this coleslaw to a beach picnic and received rave reviews! :)

I didn't have jalapeño so I used sambal garlic chili. I also used smooth peanut butter, since that is what I have on hand. A great way to use cabbage and low fat. Oh if you have regular spy sauce, it might get too salty, so add half and then more to taste.

This is my favorite salad!  Love the nuts, the ginger, the spice from jalapenos; it's all a great combo of flavors.  I add cilantro before serving it.  I have made it without lime juice (I was out and used grapefruit juice) and with jarred ginger (works perfectly).

I only want to eat coleslaw now. Been looking for a tasty vegetable snack. I think this is it. mmm...
