This was really terrific.  I altered it to four boneless, skinless breasts.  I cut all the coating ingredients in half except for the garlic and the parmesan cheese (I grate mine fresh, and recommend that!).  Since I had cut down the butter, I brushed the garlic butter onto the chicken with a pastry brush rather than dipping the chicken into the butter.  There was a ton of coating mix leftover, so after I drizzled the leftover garlic butter onto the chicken as recommended, I then dumped some of the remaining coating on top of the chicken when it was already in the pan.  I baked it for about 40 minutes.  It was really fantastic - made the whole house smell delicious - it was moist and really flavorful.  My kids both loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  I can only imagine that if it is made with the skin on the chicken, it is probably incredible.  But it worked extremely well prepared as above.

Wonderful recipe! I used boneless chicken breasts that I pounded down thin. For the bread crumbs I used Italian style and added a mxiture of spices (Italian seasoning, crushed rosemary, oregano, basil) along with the Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt and pepper basically eyeballing everything. 1/4 pound of butter is 1/2 cup and I added a bit more garlic than called for to that as I love garlic. I baked my chicken at 375 for 35 minutes and it was done perfectly - moist and juicy, not dry at all with a wonderful crispy coating.

My family loved this chicken.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is I set the oven to 375 degrees, I put the breasts in about 15 minutes before the other pieces so the smaller pieces didn't get overdone and I used a jelly roll pan instead of a 13 X 9 pan to promote crispiness.  The chicken was VERY crispy and juicy.  Loved it!!

This was the best oven fried chicken I have ever had. Usaually I don't eat oven fried anything, but WOW!!!. I could not help but think while I was eating this, (this sure beats all the oil and fat that I would be eating if this was my normal deep fried chicken and on top of that this is really crunchy and Gooood!!!). I used Italian bread crumbs and I used chicken wings. If you do not like or can not have a lot of salt cut the amount in half, then sprinkle a little bit on after dipping into the butter, I used seasoning salt. I double dipped my chicken because I had so much breading left over and hate to waste. Then poured
remaining butter mixture over chicken then baked. What ever you do try this recipe, IT'S THE BOMB!!!!!.

VERY good recipe!  I despise frying chicken, so have been in search of the best oven-fried recipe for a while.  I can stop searching.  This recipe is easy and very flavorful!  The coating comes out nice and crispy, and stays that way when reheated as leftovers.

Very good, you could omit the bread crumbs, add extra parm and stick to a no carb diet if you prefer, very tasty either way.

Fantastic recipe. Thanks, Judy! I have made this several times. Family and guests really love it!I normally make my own bread crumbs, but I was out and no bread in the house. I substituted crushed cornflakes.I eliminated the melted butter and instead, spread the chicken with a mixture of dijon and mayo. Then carefully patted on the cornflake, cheese and parsley mixture.Place in the greased pan then dropped small bits of butter onto each breast. Wow! The dijon/mayo really zipped up this recipe! Now everyone asks for seconds!

This recipe was really flavorful and good but it was a bit too buttery for me. I made it again but this time I substituted eggs instead of the butter and added garlic to them Came out delicious. Remember to pound the chicken flat!

Great recipe for the healthier alternative to fried chicken.  It was moist and juicy, and the outside crunchy.  I added some saltine cracker bits to the breading for a little extra crunch.  I also did chicken strips, so it only took about 30 mins.  Tossed some leftover alfredo and marinara sauce in a pan, added some canned mushrooms.  Threw it all on top of some vermicelli noodles and voi la!  An awesome dinner.  Thank you so much!  Will definately add this to our "regular" meals.

Great chicken!! I didn't change a thing except I used 5 whole chicken breasts instead of strips and baked covered the first 30min and uncovered the last 35 min. The coating was tasty and the chicken was very moist! This would be even better if it had some sort of sauce or gravy to pour over when serving but all-in-all, this recipe is a keeper for my family! Thanks Judy!

Nothing beats the messy way of making real fried chicken..but this recipe I must say is right up there! Bounissimo!! I used all the ingredients mentioned by Judy, but did alter some dosages and the pan I cooked it in. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, so it already had parsley, but added 1/2 tsp anyways. I opted not to bake in 9x13, instead used a jelly roll pan. Due to having all that added butter I thought it would be too greasy. By cooking it in the jelly roll pan at 375 degrees it came out super crispy and soooo tender!  It was the best recipe I have ever tried for oven fried chicken!!!!  I did add an extra bit of parm, grated fresh..and it was delicious. While the butter was melting I took the garlic clove and infused it the butter...you have to do this. Smells terrific and adds to the taste!  5 stars for sure and my honey loved it!!!!!  We had leftovers and all I know this morning he had taken it all to work and now they are asking for the recipe so the others wives can make it!  Thanks Judy!!!!

I made this for a birthday dinner party and it was a total hit!  I served it with the Best Marinara Sauce ever (found on Allrecipes too).  Everyone loved it!  The chicken was tender and juicy but had a crunchy coating that was awesome.  I did dust my chicken breasts lightly with flour, then dredged in garlic butter and bread crumbs.  I saw that tip on an Italian cooking show.  I will definitely make this baked chicken parm again.

The parmesan adds such a wonderful flavor to the coating - i also like to add dried oregano to the bread crumbs.  To really infuse the butter (or margarine) with garlic, I put the stick in the baking dish with the garlic and put it in the oven while it's preheating.  Then I dip the chicken in the melted butter then breadcrumbs with tongs and return it to the baking dish.  Yummy recipe!  And one less bowl to wash :-)

This was the easiest thing to make and absolutely delicious.  This alternative is so much healthier than frying (which is our usual method).  This will be used many times especially when I have a late day at work and can't take time to prepare.  Thanks for the post.

I have made several chicken parm recipes and never found one we really loved, until now. This was so very good. I followed the recipe exactly but used panko bread crumbs for the extra crunch and melted a slice of mozzarella on top before serving. My kids said it was the best I've ever made and my hubby loved it!  Thanks

I used 3X as much garlic, the butter was just enough so I didn't have leftover, and I recommend if you are using chicken thighs as I did that you only cook for 45 minutes.  This recipe is yummy and I will definitely use it again, thanks for submitting it, Judy!

Wow!  Exceptionally good.  I used 6 skinless large chicken legs and soaked them in 2 cups of buttermilk, 1 tsp of hot sauce, salt and pepper for a few hours before the breading and baking process.  After the soak, I dredged the pre-soaked chicken legs in flour with some garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika mixed in.  I increased the oven temp to 375 degrees and then proceeded with the recipe.  Baked for 35-40 minutes.  The chicken turned out fantastic!!  Much better than getting a bucket at the drive through... =)

I usually only review a diah I have prepared more than once to besure to give it a fair review.  I am so happy I followed that rule with this.  I fave prepared this 3 times and it has gotten betrer each time.  The first time I followed the receipe exactly except cook time sime I had tenders.  I didn't feel the breading stuck to the meat and never crisped up...the second time increased the parmesan bread crumb mixture and I added a splash of egg beater to my butter...the last time I still added the splash of egg beater to my garlic butter and increased the parmesan bread crumb mixture but I double dipped the chicken in the butter, then bread crumbs, then butter, then bread crumds.  This was perfect for the breading.  Made the chicken much more fried chicken like vwithout the oil

Thank you Judy for a great recipe.  This is in my list of standards!   I made this tonight.  I had boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs.  I saute'd 2 cloves of garlic with a skinned and seeded jalapeno pepper in some butter for just a few seconds to flavor the butter.  I also added some sweet paprika to the bread crumb mix.   40 minutes in a 375 degree oven worked perfectly.

To make this even healthier substitute olive oil for butter. Heat the olive oil and garlic in the microwave for like 10 seconds or so to combine the flavors. So good. :)

Delicious. I did change a few things.  I made this for 2 people using 2 chicken breasts.  I also used Smart Balance and olive oil mixed together instead of butter.  For a kick, I added a bit of cayenne pepper...my husband loved it!

I have made this recipe so many times because it is always requested.  I found that boneless, skinless chicken thighs are best, and when you roll them up add a slice of mozzarella cheese in the middle.  I also use fresh garlic and Italian bread crumbs.   OMG!  Absolutely to die for.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

It was good but nothing like regular fried chicken.  Used the leftovers the next day in a huge green salad with homemade ranch.  tasted better in that than as an entree.

We thoroughly enjoyed this chicken. I used 4 chicken breasts instead of pieces. It didn't stick to the pan, wasn't soggy, it was good! We don't fry anything so this was a really nice change. Thank you for the recipe! Update: We thoroughly enjoy this chicken and use different parts. It always comes out tender and moist. I double dipped many of these drums and still had lots of breadcrumbs left over to be thrown out.

Excellent recipe!  Made a huge batch of this for a weekend camping trip, and it was a bit hit, even cold.  I added the garlic (plus extra) to the butter on the stove before I melted it, so the taste would be infused. Also, I used a combo of fresh and dried crumbs, as well as some leftover crushed saltines I had. I really spiced the crumbs up a lot, adding extra parm cheese, and dipped the chicken in flour before the butter. Someone suggested cooking on racks to avoid soggy chicken, but this did not work for me, as it caused gravity to make the breadding fall off the underside of many of the pieces.  The pieces I didn't cook on the rack were fine- they were crunchy on the bottom and didn't stick. Loved this, and will definitely make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe, the chicken was moist and very garlicy, nice flavor!  I used boneless breasts, and added basil and oregano to the breadcrumb mixture.  I baked for 45 minutes at 375, and topped with tomato sauce and cheese for the last five minutes.  My only wish is it could have been a bit crisper, next time I'll put the chicken under the broiler for a couple of minutes prior to topping with sauce. Delicious with a side of angel hair pasta!  Thanks so much for sharing this.

Made this for supper tonight - it was fantastic! I used Italian bread crumbs since this was all I had. Just great, it'll be on my rotation.

We love the taste of this chicken. The only thing I do differently is that I cook it on a pastry cooling rack on a cookie sheet to drain any fat and turn it about 3/4 of the way through to get it crispy on both sides.

I substituted crushed saltines for the bread crumbs and used boneless chicken breast tenders instead of whole pieces. Because I used chicken tenders, I was able to bake it at 400 degrees, and reduce the cooking time to only 30 minutes! Very quick and easy! Overall, the chicken was juicy, tender, and deliciously flavored!

Used 5 skinless boneless chicken breasts following the directions as given.  Baked at 375 degrees for about an hour.  Delicious!  Crispy outside and moist inside.  Will try next time with chicken nuggets and mayonise instead of butter.

Very delicious! The best chicken I've had in a long time! I used panko breadcrumbs, added a little more cheese (used a parmesan/romano blend), some TJ's 21 seasoning (plus the salt & pepper, no parsley), and used about 3/4 of the stick of butter instead of the whole stick. I used chicken leg quarters and baked at 375 for 40 min and then 350 for the remaining 20 min. Oh, and I baked the chicken on a foil lined cookie sheet. This helped so much with getting the outside crispy. When I use a pan with taller sides the chicken tends to be soggy. This is the only recipe I will use from now on for "fried" chicken. So good!

I made this recipe using thin boneless chicken breasts that I cut into tenders because my daughter prefers tenders.  I put the garlic and the butter in a dish and microwaved them together to melt the butter, this made the butter more garlic flavored.  I also used italian bread crumbs so I only added a little salt and pepper and no parsley since the breadcrumbs already had dried parsley in them and I mixed in the shredded parmesan cheese.  I cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes and for the last few minutes I turned on the broiler to try to crisp it up a bit.  This chicken turned out ok but wasn't anything special.  The flavor was pretty good but the bread crumbs were kind of powdery like and not really crispy.  I was hoping this would be a good subsitition for the fried chicken tenders I make that my kids love but unfortunately it didn't fit the bill.  I gave it four stars because it wasn't bad at all just not as wonderful as a lot of the reviews led me to believe.  It was good for a quick dinner which is what I needed because I was short on time.

Awesome!  I used skinless, boneless dhicken breasts and instead of salt, I used Mrs. Dash.  It's the most tender and juicy chicken I've made.  I will definately make this again.

we did NOT like this at all. I followed the recipe to a tee and the skin never got even close to crispy, which is what we love. I will never make this again. sorry for the poor review, but I have no clue what went wrong, I didn't change a thing....

This recipe was wonderful! My fiance' told me it was the best "fried chicken" he ever had! I did make a couple of slight modifications. I used 4 boneless breasts and soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 1 hour prior to preparation and baking. I also added a packet of ranch dresssing mix to the bread crumbs. The chicken came out so moist and flavorful. I love fried chicken but would choose this healthier alternative any day! Serve with home made mac & cheese or mashed potatoes and corn, or over a bed of crunchy greens with tomatoes!

I'm doing WW with some girlfriends of mine, and we missed our comfort foods.  This recipe is a quick convert to lower points by using reduced or fat free Parmesan, fat free margerine, and low fat crackers (I was out of breadcrumbs and everything else...I rolled them in ritz crackers!).  Delicious, easy clean up, and it makes great chicken fingers to serve with dip.  Muchas gracias!

Delicious! I melted the butter in my glass 9×13 dish, in the preheated oven. Once melted, I added 2 tablespoons of garlic paste and mixed well. Then, I dipped my chicken breasts in the garlic butter and rolled in the bread crumb mixture and put back in the glass dish. I baked the four thin chicken breasts for 40 minutes. They came out juicy with a yummy crunchy crust. And, my girls LOVED them. This recipe is a keeper!

Tasty, Crunchy outside. Tender meat inside. I used crushed butter flavor crackers since I didn't have bread crumbs. I used the baking dish to melt the butter while the oven was preheating and then just added the garlic to the pan. It was easy to dredge the chicken in the garlic butter then rolling crumbs and back into the pan. I had one less dish to clean up after too doing it that way. Thanks for a great dish Judy!

Great recipe and very easy, no bread crumbs, so I took some Italian flavored croutons crushed it up, added a teaspoon of paprika in my dry mix and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and threw in there too, took the chunks of crumbs left and sprinkled on top before popping in the oven.  Rave reviews from the family.

I really liked this. A great week night meal. I thought one hour of baking would be too much, but it wasn't. The chicken turned out juicy and crunchy. I used Panko bread crumbs, and put a clove of crushed garlic in with the butter.

Delicious. I used this recipe for chicken legs, and removed the skin before dipping them in the garlic butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe, only I substituted panko crumbs for the dry bread crumbs, and used more parmesan than called for. Thanks for the recipe Judy/AZ. it's a keeper.

Absolutely AMAZING! I fallowed recipe to the exact ! except i did not add fresh parsley because i did not have any on hand.
Also i put some salt and pepper on the chicken as well as a little into the bread crumb mix. I used the real deal Parmesan cheese and grated it my self. I did not have the meat pounder on hand so i just took the chicken breast and slit my knife down the middle and turned it into 2 thin peaces CAME OUT TO PERFECTION. OUR MOUTHS WERE DANCING. THANK YOU SO MUCH JUDY/AZ FOR THIS RECIPE. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF SIMPLE PERFECT RECIPE FOR A WHILE. JUST AS THEY SAY SIMPLICITY GOES A LONG WAY!!!! THANK YOU THIS WILL BE ADDED TO MY WEEKLIES.

Pertty darn good..I flipped the fillets half way through cooking so both sides would be nice and crispy, then added mozz cheese on top for the last 10 min.  Almost like our favorite Italian place.

I love the flavor in this recipe.  I used chicken breasts, so getting the bread crumbs to stick this way was a little hard.  I mixed all the ingredients also, because I was tired and did not see I was suppose to dip in the garlic butter... hehe.. I pulled a (Pomplemouse).  I will make this again and again.  I served with a salad and side of pasta with marinara.

Absoloutly amazing!!! I loved this recipe and it was really good left over as well. I used chicken tenders instead because I do not like bones in my chicken, and I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated and it came out wonderful. I used the leftover coating over the top of the chicken for more crispiness and I can see me making this more often, it is one of my new favorites.

This chicken is awesome and my favorite recipe for baked chicken ever!  I use slighly more butter and garlic, but that is my preference.  I LOVE garlic!  I also used "I can't believe its not butter" spray to spray all over the chicken before it goes into the oven.  Makes the coating evenly crisp and buttery tasting without extra fat.

Yum!  Before dipping in the garlic butter, I rolled the chicken around in a flour/pepper/onion powder/garlic powder mix, for extra flavor.  I turned this recipe into Chicken Parmisiana by smothering the chicken in spaghetti sauce and shredded mozzerella.  So good!

This was pretty good. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, and cut the other ingredients in half. It didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped, but it was easy and my husband liked it.

I put a bit of a twist on this. I LOVE roasted garlic in the oven.  So, instead of crushed garlic, I roasted the garlic with a bit of olive oil and salt.  When soft, I mixed it with the butter.  Wonderful!  I also used skinless thighs instead of breast meat.  So tender, and good.  thanks for the recipe

We just finished having this for dinner and it is a definite keeper.  Had purchased 12 chicken legs on sale and divvied them up in sixes.  Took one pack out and used that.  Thought there would be a couple of leftovers to munch on, but not so. As we were eating them, I could see the juices just flowing out of them.  Only change I made was using chopped parsley and very little salt.  My husband kept m-m-m-m-m-ing while eating the legs.  He said that we must use this recipe with the other legs we still have left.   Absolutely delicious!!!

I made this for my family and it was a huge hit, which is very difficult in a house full of picky eaters! However instead of doing such big pieces of chicken I cut all the breasts into halves or thirds more like chicken strips. I had to use two pans in the oven to fit all the chicken, it turns out SO much better in a glass pan then a metal one. The glass pan kept them moist and softer, the metal made them crunchy very fast.

I thought this was an extremely easy and very tasty recipe. I have been looking for a good "oven fried" chicken recipe so that I can avoid getting out the fryer for just a couplke of pieces of chicken when it's just the wife and me. This was very tasty, healthier than regular fried chicken and with the added bonus of minimal cleanup.

This was amazing! I went exactly by the recipe, but at the end, I topped it with mozzarella cheese for a few minutes and then added some of Marcella Hazan's tomato sauce to make a sort of chicken parm. Based on some recommendations, I also baked at 375 for about 40 min.

Baking at 350 left the crust soggy so I had to bump the temp up to get it brown and crusty.  Tastes fantastic with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese.  Thank you for sharing.

Awesome. My husband and my stepson finished all of it. I listend to some reviewer's suggestion, brushed the butter on the chicken instead dip in. Also i added some fresh basil, then 375 degrees baked for 35 minutes.. So good.

This was easy and delicious.  Next time I will make half the bread crumb mixture; I had far more than I needed.  I served this with festosi (semolina rufffled pasta--any favorite will do)with garlic infused EVOO drizzled on top, steamed spinach, and slices of ripe tomato.  I did use gluten-free bread crumbs, and they worked very well.

The chicken had really good flavor.  I used this with boneles skinless chicken breasts.  I followed the directions other than substituting cracker crumbs for the dried bread crumbs.  My coating did not stick well to the chicken, and only browned where the butter was drizzled. I even cooked it on a rack to try to keep it crisp. Maybe it's my cooking ability, but this didn't work for me as i thought it would.

I have made this recipe many times, and everyone loves it! The last time I made this, I used a three cheese blend of parmesan, asiago, and romano. It was so delicious! I know that it was no longer just parmesan chicken, but I love playing with this recipe. I have even used shredded colby jack cheese instead of parmesan, added a little egg to the butter mixture (cooled, of course) and substituted turkey fillets for the chicken. Amazing! Thank you so much for this recipe.

Absolutely amazing! I made it with a large package of chicken wings that I had in the freezer and doubled the ingredients. Normally my family is picky and will not eat chicken on the bone, but between 4 adults and 5 year old there were no left overs. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and just fell off the bone.

My husband loved this and he hates all kind of cheeses! I didn't tell him what it was until after he ate it. I thought the Parmesan cheese over powered the garlic flavor. Will make again using less Parmesan.

This was outstanding and will makeit  a regular dish to prepare.  As one reviewer suggested, I sauted the garlic and added jalapeno peppers also, and mixed a bit of paprika to the dried bread crumbs.

My fiance and I LOVED this recipe. It's going to be a staple at our house. I used 2 small garlic cloves and dried parsley instead of fresh and it was AMAZING. So much flavor and it was moist. Thanks!

Excellent!!!!! My very picky family just loved it.  My 22 year old daughter wants the recipe....for her boyfriend to cook for her.  I had to use panko, as I was out of bread crumbs, but I am sure it would be just as good with bread crumbs, maybe even better, as the bread crumbs would absorb more of the butter.  Thanks Judy.

This is a really good recipe and I see lots of potential for variations.  I made according to the recipe except I used Italian bread crumbs, so the extra seasonings made it really good and perhaps some that thought it needed something more should try that.  I used only chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand and it was crispy and smelled soooooo good!  I am anxious to try with boneless skinless chicken breasts to be a little healthier.  I can't wait to get home tonight for leftovers.  Oh, one other thing - I started it out skin side down and turned over about 1/2 way through.

I made this for dinner yesterday, and it was ok.  The parmesan chicken need more salt and pepper.  It wasn't alot of flavor.  I made it because it had a lot of reviews, so I thought the parmesan chicken would be good.   Well that goes to show you, not beacause a recipe has alot of reviews... that doesn't mean it's good   ;)

Made this last night for dinner and it was excellent! I followed the recipe with the exceptions of, I added just a bit more garlic(garlic lover) and I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts which I pounded out with a meat tenderizer to flatten and so the garlic-butter mixture would soak in the chicken and I also used italian flavored bread crumbs as I didn't have any plain. The smell in my kitchen as these were cooking was fabulous and they came out very well except the breading on them was a bit mushy, so about the last 10 min. of cooking, I put them under the broiler to make the tops of chicken crunchy, I would definately reccomend this method, they came out perfectly and were simply delish!! Will definately make again...thanks for this great recipe. :)

I can't be sure, but i do believe this chicken was the clincher in getting my husband to propose! I usually make them into strips and cook them on a broiler rack to make them crispier. We love it!

This was delicious!  The only changes I made was to add a few dashes hot sauce to the butter mixture, and I baked it for 30 minutes, and the last few minutes I turned the broiler on high to make it crispy - be careful with drizzling too much of the butter on the top or it will just come out soggy.  My husband LOVED this - definetly a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! I used chicken breasts and pounded them flat. I also double dipped the chicken and placed them in a Reynolds Release non-stick foil lined pan. Turn them over after 20 minutes and cook an additional 25 minutes.

This chicken turned out great!!  However, I modified the recipe a bit because my significant other and I love garlic.  I substituted the salt with garlic salt for the bread crumb mixture and let the garlic butter sit for about 15 minutes after I added the crushed garlic.  As for the chicken, I dredged it in the garlic butter, and then let it sit for about 10 minutes before dredging it a second time and then put it immediately in the bread crumb mixture (to which I also added dried parsley instead of fresh).  I cooked the chicken at 350 for about 30 minutes, but found the bread crumbs were getting soggy, so I increased the temperature to 375, turned the drumsticks over (I used a package of these rather than a whole chicken) over, added more bread crumbs (there were a lot left over) and topped with an additional 3 tbs of melted butter mixed with garlic salt.  I cooked this an additional 30 minutess, and it came out very juicy and crispy!  I highly recommend!

THIS IS AWESOME!!!!! My family is a challenging audience and it was a success.  I didn't have parsley or garlic cloves but went to Cook's Thesaurus and got the equivalent measurements for minced garlic.  This dish's aroma while cooking will make you crazy waiting to sink your teeth into it.  I'm gonna try pork chops next. EXCELLENT FLAVOR! I reccommend it highly (if you like this type of cuisine! Thank you!

I love this! I modified the recipe a little: I used 4 cloves of garlic (because I love it), and 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts-sliced in half.
It was GREAT! Nice flavor and very EASY~!

Best recipe I've tried on allrecipes.com!  Use chicken breast, which cuts the cooking time down to 25 minutes.  Everyone loves this!!!

A hit with the whole family!  I doctored up the breadcrumbs with additional Italian herb seasoning.  I too coated the chicken with flour first, and I added salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to the flour.  This was moist, smelled YUMMY, tasted YUMMY, and the bread coating was not too thick, not too thin, and stayed on the chicken while cutting with a knife and fork.  Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic!!  I would use chicken breasts or chicken pieces.  Rather than dirtying up a dish, I put all the dry ingredients in a ziploc bag to coat the chicken.

Is there anything higher than a 5?!  This was the best recipe I've gotten here.  I took the advice of another member and dusted with flour first, then the butter, then the crumbs.  I used a few pieces of french bread, tore them up and put them under the broiler.  When brown, I put them in the food processor with the herbs.  I had very large bone-in chicken breasts, so I baked for 40 minutes on each side on a jelly roll pan. I also added about one teaspoon of ranch dressing powder to the bread crumb mixture.  One of my son's friends (14 yrs. old) was over and wouldn't touch it at first.  When he did eat it, he said it was better than the Colonel's!  My husband worked very late that night so I fixed his plate and put in the fridge.  I was afraid it would be soggy.  He heated in the microwave and it was still crunchy.  He said it was as good or better than regular fried chicken.  This will be a regular.  Since we're trying to watch our calories/fat, I may try something in place of the butter, but even as the recipe is, we had green beans (no fat) and corn on the cob (no butter), so it still wasn't that bad in fat.  Real good.  THANKS!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I was impressed with how moist the chicken was, and the recipe itself is very easy.  Next time, I think I'll ease up on the amount of butter and kick up on the amount of garlic.

I used chicken strips and lessened the baking time. Also broiled at the end for more browning. Very tasty.

Quick to prepare, and very flavorable using common kitchen staples and ingredients.  I could smell the cheesy flavor while it baked.  An hour was almost too long to wait!

This was easy and delicious. I would recommend cooking the chicken at a higher temp to promote more browning.
I followed recipe exactly...but did add a splash of hot sauce to the butter mixture...will make again for sure.

I used I can't believe its not butter and added garlic. Cooked for an hour then drizzled fresh cheese for 10 minutes. The aroma was amazing and the taste was incredible. Chicken so moist and then crunch of fried chicken without the guilt!!

I've been baking my chicken breasts this way for 20 years. For a quick go-to meal, mix up a large batch of bread crumbs and parmesan and store it in the refrigerator in an air tight container. You can easily substitute herb seasoned bread crumbs and omit the parsley, salt and pepper or crush seasoned stuffing mix in a food processor to the consistency of bread crumbs.

I also bake at 350, but only for about 45 minutes unless the chicken breasts are very large. They always come out juicy and tender.

This was pretty good but you have to use Panko to get that crunch!

If you're searching for a terrific oven-fried chicken recipe, look no further. It's incredibly simple and it is delicious. Other than brushing the butter on rather than dipping the chicken pieces, there is no tweaking necessary! I have made this many times and I've had to start making a larger quantity because it gets inhaled. I have found that I can cut the bread crumb mixture in half and have plenty.
Variations I use from time to time: I sometimes use boneless breasts. When I do this, I add a thin layer of mayonnaise before brushing the butter on. This makes it a lot moister, but you can't taste the mayo. If using boneless, cut the cooking time to about 40 minutes. And sometimes I add a little cayenne for some heat.

I am speechless!  This recipe is so simple, yet MAGNIFICENT!!! You can just stop your searching - if you love garlic, and fried chicken, you will never need another recipe! The only changes I made (no, there won't be a list of 20 additional ingredients, lol) was to take another reviewers advice and use fresh garlic (2 large cloves, crushed) to one cube of REAL butter (it's totally worth it!  Health benefits aside, the flavor it imparts will simply blow. your. mind.)  I used it with 5 large chicken thighs, and in retrospect I would have doubled the butter/garlic because I didn't have enough to drizzle over the top for three pieces, and BELIEVE ME, that makes a difference!!!) I had no parsley, and doubled the pepper.  PLEASE try this!  You will be doing yourself and your family a huge favor.  THANK YOU JUDY/AZ!!!!!!

Very good.  Surprised how moist it was.  Leftovers great on sandwiches.  Pounded, as others said.  Easy and delicious.  Coated w/mayo instead of eggs/etc.

My family loved this recipe! It was juicy, moist, crispy, and very tasty. I used 6 boneless chicken thighs. The amounts of ingredients worked for me, but I really didn't measure the coating mixture, which I made using unseasoned breadcrumbs, wheat germ, grated parmesan, and added some sea salt, pepper, a bit of basil and oregano. What little butter/garlic mix was left I drizzled over the chicken. I set the oven at 375, baked the chicken for a 1/2 hour covered with foil, turned the chicken, baked the last 1/2 hour uncovered, and turned it once more half way through that last half hour. The result was "perfectable" as my 6 year old stated. I served the chicken with homemade mashed potatoes and peas. Yum! This recipe has already been added to my recipe box : )

I cut two hefty chicken breasts into chicken fingers....
instead of using bread crumbs I used smashed up butter & garlic croutons! I cooked the chicken strips  on top of a cooling rack placed on top of a baking dish.
My side dish consisted of 5 red potatos quartered & covered in the leftover melted butter and crunch topping .. I put them in a baking dish. Cooked both dishes together at 350 for 45 min.
FABULOUS!!!

Deeeeelicious!   Add yet more garlic (cuz we're crazy like that) and mixed the regular bread crumbs with some panko, because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely add panko whenever I make this--which will be often!  Great job, JUDY/AZ!

This is good , and very easy .  I used more garlic than called for , and toasted panko crumbs , for the bread crumbs.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil ( un-greased ) instead of the greased baking dish .  Will make again for sure .  Thank you for sharing .

Before I found this recipe, I usually made my own Parmesan chicken out of the top of my head, it's not hard really, but I was looking for other ideas to add to the bread crumbs, etc. I decided I'd just try this recipe because it got such good reviews. I never thought about dipping the chicken in garlic butter! Genius!! The chicken was so flavorful and moist! Usually when I make this I make pasta along with it, so hallway through the baking, I spoon a little marinara sauce on top that I've been simmering on the stove. I got raves about this chicken and I'm always asked to make it again. Once, I really wanted this but I was out of butter, so I used milk instead, and it was still good, but the greasing wasn't as crunchy. I did no alterations to this recipe and I doubt I ever will. This was so delicious!

I scaled the recipe down to four serving and used eight drumsticks and a breast.  I cut out the salt, used less bread crumbs and added a few sprinkles of onion and garlic powder to the crumb mixture.  My husband really enjoyed it!

I've made this two times now --one time I followed the recipe exactly, and the other time I added 1/2 tsp. paprika to the breading mixture. Both times it was excellent, but I have to say that adding the paprika made it just about perfect. The paprika also gave the chicken a deeper color, which I liked. My whole family loves this recipe!

i used extra garlic in the butter and drizzled it over the breaded chicken right before baking. I also added some seasoning to my bread crumbs - some onion and garlic powder and italian seasoning. I also used a little extra cheese. It crisped up nicely and had good flavor. The only reason this wasn't five stars for me is because i would use only boneless skinless chicken thighs (breasts if you really don't like dark meat, though i think its wonderfully juicy for recipes like this) and it would have been a touch bland without the extra seasoning for my tastes. We'll likely make this again though.

Very easy and good recipe.  It is a family favorite at our house.  I suggest lining a shallow pan with foil then spraying with Pam.  Place the coated chicken on top of the foil prior to drizzling the rest of the butter. This simple step makes clean up much easier later on.  I have found that we prefer more seasoning added to the bread crumbs as well.  We feel that the recipe is a bit bland as written, but that is a matter of preference.

I really liked this recipe - adding the garlic to the butter is genius. I also used skinless, boneless and it worked great.  I will try another suggestion to cook at slightly higher temp for less time.  I did not have a problem with crispiness but I sprayed the  tops of chicken with a bit of olive oil cooking spray before putting into the oven.  I will definitely make this again but with a bit less salt - for my taste.

Good eating.  I used chicken breasts instead and cooked them for half an hour at 400 degrees. Much faster.

This was fantastic!  Made this tonite (didn't have parsley) and it was really good.  I used bone-in chicken breasts and they remained moist and flavorful.  For those of you who haven't gotten your chicken to crisp, just put it under the broiler for the last 2 or 3 minutes.  Crispy and brown on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside.  Excellent!  The butter really added a lot of flavor.

I didn't even bother to measure and it turned out great. I used chicken fingers and cooked them for 40 minutes. 3 stars only because I try to be critical in my reviews and while this was tasty and I plan on making it again, it didn't really stand out from other parmesan chickens I've made.

this recipe is amazing. My picky 3 year old calls it "the best chicken ever". I can't believe the flavor comes from these few ingredients. Simple, easy and delish!!

Very good!  I used chicken breast only (1 pd) and cut the butter and bread crumbs down.  I also used canned bread crumbs with italian seasoning. I drizzled the leftover butter and crumbs over the chicken and then  covered and cooked 30 minutes then 10 minutes without foil.  Unbelievably moist and tender.  I will be making this agin!

This was an easy recipe to make, but the chicken didn't become crispy like expected. Does anyone have an idea how to make it crispy in the oven? I tried using a rack and turning the chicken as it baked.

I just can't seem to please the kids with any of these baked nugget recipes. I liked them very well, but the kids just aren't satisfied with anything but the bland boring ones you buy in the freezer section premade. So I'm only giving it a four because I liked them very well, but was really hoping to please both myself and the kids this time.

This was awesome.  I thought maybe it would be just like regular old breaded chicken but it was so much better.  The butter and garlic mixture really gave it a little something extra.  I only made two minor modifications...I used italian style bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand and instead of 2 tbsp. of parsley I used 1 tbsp. of dried italian seasoning.  I cooked for about an hour and flipped once during baking.  I also turned on the broiler during the last few minutes to crisp it up a bit more.  It was so moist and flavorful, no dipping sauce required!

I made this the other night and it was so yummy I had to come back to review it and to let others know how I served it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper. It gave it a little more taste and garlic salt instead os regular salt. Instead of a whole chicken I used 4 chicken breasts. Then with a can of chicken broth, some garlic, butter, flour and salt I made a garlic gravy. I served it over the chicken with potato wedges coated in grill seasoning and extra virgin olive oil that I roasted in the oven. My family said it was the best meal I'd ever made. The garlic gravy really added a great finishing touch!

This was so simple and quick to prepare which made it a great recipe for a week night. My husband, who is not a big fan of chicken, loved it. The coating was not quite as crispy as I like so I turned the heat up to 450 for the last five minutes of cooking time to crisp it up a little more. I'll definitely make this again.

Really, really good.  I used fresh parmesan, and it was wonderful.  I also sometimes leave out the breading, and just bake chicken with the garlic butter.  Also very good.

This is a wonderful chicken recipe.  I used about three cloves of garlic because I love garlic chicken and it added another dimension to it.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you, Judy, for sharing this with us!

My family and I loved this recipe. I used boneless chicken breasts and cut back on the cooking time, of course.  I also used italian style bread crumbs and extra parmesan.  The flavor was great. I drizzled them with olive oil instead of butter, and they came out crispy and juicy. This recipe is also good with some marinara and mozarella cheese added at the end of baking time.

I made this last night when we had some neighbors over, and everyone loved it.  I did make a few modifications.  I added more garlic, I used seasoned breadcrumbs and I also added a little garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture.  YUM YUM.  The chicken stayed so moist - even the pieces that I removed the skin from stayed nice and moist and tender.  My husband told me to put this in the "do again" book.  Thanks!

This was delicious. The chicken came out super moist. I made angel hair pasta and covered it all with spaghetti sauce. I've since told at least 3 other people about this recipe. My new favorite chicken!

This chicken tasted wonderful!!  I cooked extra, but still had no leftovers.  I used 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup crushed ritz crackers.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This chicken was so delicious that I know this is going to become atleast a twice a month staple with my family. The breading on top was delicious, except I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, which just made it more tasty! I only baked the chicken for one hour, which for me was enough time to bake all the way through, and still left it moist and juicy. My family LOVED this recipe!

DELICIOUS! Sometimes I will marinate the chicken in italian dressing and skip the butter. I also usually use Italian bread crumbs. I usually use skinless, boneless chicken breasts, powdered garlic and dried parsley. Sometimes I sprinkle a little bit of extra cheese on top right before placing it into the oven. Not only does this taste great, the house smells wonderful while cooking.

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party. I made a slight adjustment, instead of using chicken breats, I used chicken tenders, it was easier to coat and they cooked in 30 minutes. I also put a little marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese on them 5 minutes before they are done. I loved this recipe!! It even tasted great the next day!

Incredible! I used the whole breast, but pounded them first and they turned out really juicy. I did cover the chicken with aluminum foil all the time it spent in the oven. It lacked crispiness thou, maybe next time I'll uncover it the last 15-20 minutes. I spread over the breast (5 minutes before they were done) the tomato sauce from the Italian spaghetti meatballs recipe and added shredded mozzarella and oregano. They were great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe really saved me the day I had very limited supplies on hand, and most recipes called for stuff I didn't have.  We used .8 lb of chicken breast, cut each breast in half to make them thin, and pounded the breasts.  Then we made the batter as specified and baked for 40 minutes.  It was really tender and juicy, and I would definitely make this again.  However, next time I'm going to put melted cheese and pasta sauce on it to make it more like the Chicken Parmesan that I'm used to.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good--the skin was golden brown, crispy and delicious, and I don't usually like the skin on chicken.  The only changes I made was adding more garlic than the recipe called for, and adding some poulty seasoning and garlic herb seasoning to the breading.

This was great! I used boneless skinless breasts and fresh basil. It had a wonderful crunch to the outside and moist on the inside. Everything you want for a great chicken parm. Serve it with sauce and bread to dip it in!

It was like using homemade oven fry. It was good. Nothing special. The cold chicken hit the warm butter & garlic & it instantly solidified. It didn't rub on very well but the bread crumbs stuck ok.

My daughter made this recipe tonight. She used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Oh my word .... This chicken was fan - flipping - tastic! The chicken was amazingly crispy, just like she had fried it! I am not a big fan of fried chicken. This chicken was crispy and flavorful. I would highly recommend this recipe!!!

I added seasoning salt, garlic pepper and basil to the breadcrumb mixture. It was pretty tasty. I didn't feel the guilt I feel after eating fried chicken and this didn't leave a lingering odor as fried foods typically do. Winning!! I'd try this again.

This worked great with breasts cut into strips (I was pushed for time).  Strips cooked in 25 minutes at 350.  Kids and adults loved it!  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.   Crispy and juicy.

Very easy and delicious. I used boneless chicken breasts and sliced them sideways, more like chicken fingers. Everyone said "make these again!"

This chicken is amazing! I made a few alterations because I didn't have everything but it turned out very good. First I used a pastry brush to mask the chicken in the mayo, it coated the chicken beautifully and it used less mayo. I didn't have true bread crumbs so I used the Italian Style Panko breading for a substitute. I also cooked my chicken on 375, which I think is perfect, it cooks faster, seals the juices and the breading meshes well with the chicken. I also cooked the chicken and then about halfway I rotated it to the other side and toward the end I flipped it back over and broiled it for a little on the other side. I've never had oven fried chicken until tonight but I didn't want any soggy breading. I loved this! Taste very good and it's pretty healthy. I added some asparagus as a side with a little salt pepper and olive oil drizzled over it and it was amazing. I will for sure make this again!

This is wonderful! I stuck mostly to the recipe, but used what I had on hand: drumsticks, dried parsley and seasoned panko breadcrumbs. Juicy and flavorful all the way to the bone! This one's a keeper!

Always looking for a different way to do chicken.  I had drumsticks, thighs and panko Italian seasoned breadcrumbs on hand.  Came out absolutely delicious!  Very crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Rave reviews at home and will make again !

This was very tasty and I was so happy that it came out crispy yet is healthier because it is not fried. Great recipe!

I don't generally write reviews, but this was so good that I had to write one.  I did make a few very minor changes.  I used chicken breasts and pounded them thin then cut them in half.  I used a little extra garlic in the butter mixture.  I used panko crumbs and increased the amount of parmesan.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used Italian seasoning instead.  I baked on a jelly roll pan at 375 for about 30 minutes.  It came out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The whole family loved it.

We absolutely LOVED this recipe, and will definitely be using it again!!!  Made some slight changes per the reviews.  I also used skinless/boneless chicken breasts and cut them into pieces, trying to stretch it out a little.  I cut the amount of butter in half and decreased the bread crumbs since I did not have a full 4# chicken (probably just approx. 2# breasts)but doubled the amount of garlic.  I also used season salt.  I was in  a hurry, so cooked at 375 for about 40 min.  Made an amature mistake and checked the temp in the largest piece to make sure was at 165 and ended up over-cooking the smaller pieces so they were dryer) but it was still loved and lots of "mmmmmm's" throughout the meal.  Next time, I think I will try putting the thicker pieces between plastic wrap and pounding them out to a more even size, but don't want to go too thin, because I believe the best flavor is with a slightly thicker piece, as they are more juicy.  Served it with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  This is definately a keeper!

Wow just finished eating it and had to rate it!  I had seen Parmesan chicken recipes but didn't want to try it, thought it might be too cheesy, but this one is not, just a hint of parmesan flavor, very crunchy, slight garlic and butter, all the seasoning works together for unique flavor that I will be making a lot!

This is the BEST! No mess, no fuss. I had 5 chicken leg quarters, so that's what I used. I separated the thigh from the drum, and had to double the other ingredients to cover all that chicken. The smell when it was baking was heavenly! It came out nice and moist and tasted great. The only party pooper was my teenage son, who thinks fried chicken should come from a frying pan, or better yet from KFC. But everyone else loved it, and if I had to do it again, I gladly would!

I turn the oven up to 400 degrees and prior, spray the glass dish with Pam Olive oil spray and put some butter. Butter will help it brown and oven fry...I normally cook pasta and coat that with olive oil and italian seasonings...my family always goes back for seconds. Olive oil spray keeps it healthy.

Everyone loved it. I didn't have a clove of garlic so I sprinkled garlic powder on the margarine before melting. Also followed others advice and I added italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and cooked them 375 for 35 min. Served with noodles and a jar of spaghetti sauce heated through. Super easy & great dinner on a work night. Thank you!

Oh yeah, I'll be using this recipe again and again!  I used Italian croutons and crushed them in a ziploc bag.  I followed someone else's tip and dipped the chicken in a beaten egg first, then dipped it in the butter mixture, then the bread crumbs.  I served it with skillet fried potatoes and a spinach salad with sliced mushrooms and bacon pieces.  My husband cleaned his plate.  He complemented me several times on how tasty the chicken was!

My family crushed this!!! I cooked this meal for my family while we waited out Hurricane Sandy. I know, I was bored. It was a major hit! Used it with chicken legs only with green beans and mashed potatoes and garlic bread. Once again loved it! All 4 of us. Thanks!

Great!!!  My husband and I don't eat much deep-fried food, so this was a slum-dunk substitute for traditional fried chicken.  I did, however, make a couple of changes: 1.  increase butter by 50% and garlic by 100%; 2. add about 50% more breadcrumbs and parmesan.  I also used large chicken thighs rather than a cut-up chicken.

I only gave this four stars because I didn't have anymore chicken...This was awesome. I did substitute. I only had legs, so once dried I used saltine crackers blended in my magic bullet. I double dipped three and single dipped three, single was better but both went before I knew it. I also added extra seasoning: Oregano, cajun pepper and this southwest blend I created.

Very tasty!  Used chicken thighs because that's what I had.  Yum!  Didn't add the parsley because I used Italian breadcrumbs and it seemed to already have them in it.  (also oddly not a huge fan of parsley).

I have done a dozen versions of this over the years, but this was by far the best.  I think that the kicker was the garlic in the butter and pouring what butter I had left over the top before baking.  I used chicken thighs with bones and my husband told me they were the best chicken thighs that I had ever made.  Will do this again for sure!

Wow.  I used chicken legs (because my kids think they are fun) with the skin pulled off (because I try to eat healthy).  I used less than 1/2 the suggested amount of butter and 3 cloves of garlic (because, in my opinion, there's no such thing as too much garlic).  I brushed the garlic butter on and then rolled liberally in the cheesy crumbs.  (I had to skip the parsley because I didn't have any, and I used whole wheat homemade bread crumbs.)  

Fabulous.  The house smelled amazing while they cooked, and my picky family devoured them as soon as I put them on the table.

I will be making these again.  Soon.  Thank you for the phenomenal recipe!

Delicious and so simple to make! This is a meal you could easily throw together after work on a weekday. Everyone at the table enjoyed it.  I increased the garlic, probably about 2 heaping tablespoons of the pre-chopped stuff. In addition to the finely ground parmesan, I added about a 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese. I left out the salt so people could salt to taste. Instead of cut up fryer I used 6 large thighs, which I cooked at 350 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I may try reducing the cooking time by 10 minutes next time, otherwise it was perfect.

I just had this for dinner tonight. WOW, it is by far  the best oven-fried chicken I've ever made. I used all drumsticks.  The only thing I did different was to add a little seasoned salt to the bread crumbs.  I baked it on a broiler pan, so the bottom of the chicken wouldn't get soggy.
Delicious!

My son loves fried chicken, but in my pursuit of healthier versions of those types of foods, I stumbled across this recipe.  Excellent!  I used half of the breading and used boneless chicken thighs instead.  This is the best parmesan chicken I've tried yet!

this is so delicious! it fills our entire apartment with an amazing smell.  I use boneless skinless chicken breasts, sometimes cutting them up and putting them into a salad (salad includes: greens, tomatoes, mandarin orange slices [from a can/jar], feta cheese, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and sesame ginger dressing..sooo yummy!). I also recommend brining the chicken first for extra moistness/flavor.  I put my chicken in a large ziplock bag and just pour some kosher salt and sugar in it, shake it up, and let it refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours. I also recommend buying a block of parmesan and fresh grating it yourself, it's so much better than the pre-grated kind.

This was delicious. I used what I had in my kitchen, so I changed a few things. I used 4 large boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut those in half. For the butter and garlic I used minced garlic. Instead of the Italian bread crumbs I mixed 2c grated parmesan 2 1/2c flour 3tbsp Italian seasoning 1tsp black pepper 1tsp paprika 1tsp salt 4tbsp chopped chives. Dipped chicken in butter then coated in flour mix. Placed in baking dish and spooned butter and garlic over chicken. Baked uncovered at 350 for 45 minutes. My family loved it over spaghetti and smothered in marinara sauce and parmesan cheese.

Delicious recipe. I used chicken thighs and wings, prepared it as written and it was wonderful. This is a dish that I will make over and over again.

Made this recipe tonight and my entire family loved it! The only thing I changed was the cooking temperature and time...I used 375 degrees for 45 mins. I also added marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese to the top of the chicken to make it chicken parm!

My husband LOVES this recipe. It works well using crackers instead of bread crumbs also. It was a little on the salty side the first time I tried it, so I cut the salt in half the next time and it was wonderful... but I suppose that's a matter of taste! Great recipe!

This is my "go-to" recipe when I need something quick and delicious for company.  It is a no-fail as written, and comes out perfect every time.  I like to use chicken tenders, as it makes better serving sizes for company and kids.  Adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Cooked for 65 minutes, which was too long for medium size cutlets. Will cook 50 - 55 minutes next time.

I finally made this dish yesterday for my fiancee' and father. We all loved it! The parmesan in this is fantastic, and it was nice and crunchy. I do agree with others, about it being a little too much butter, and will probably omit some of it next time. Also, I feel like this would have been slightly better without the skin of the chicken, so that will also be omitted. All in all, a fantastic dish, and a definite remake.

Yummy!!!!  I thought this was excellent! It was easy to make, the coating got nice and crispy in the oven and the flavor was great.  Instead of standard breadcrumbs, I mixed half whole wheat bread crumbs and panko.

Made this for dinner using 2 very large bone-in skin-on breasts. This was very easy to make, made the whole house smell great. My boyfriend loved it. He asked that I make this again soon. Only adjustments I made were seasoning to our taste.

Moist and delicious! My husband and 4 yr old son loved this and so did I. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs, and baked it for 45 minutes in 365 degrees.

I love this recipe, the garlic butter makes it much better than the standard breaded chicken that my mom has made for years.  It may be more fattening, but it is nice for a treat every once in awhile.    It is quick and easy to prepare and even my picky 4 year old ate it.    I use the thin sliced chicken breasts and bake for 40 minutes

This was a great recipe. I used six boneless, skinless chicken breasts and 2/3 tablespoon of dried parsley flakes instead of fresh, but kept everything else the same. Topped with mozzarella cheese 5 minutes before finished. Served it on a bed of angel hair pasta and with a light amount of pasta sauce over it. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this recipe was alright.  My kids loved it and asked for more so I gave it four stars.  After I made it I thought it would be good as chicken Parmesan with red sauce over noodles but it was still good just on it's own just not to die for.

You can substitute crushed pork rinds for the bread crumbs.  I myself do not eat pork rinds, but my husband does so have in the house.  You do not get the rind flavor when using them for that purpose.  Just the crunchy.  Works well for us.  I  have oven fried for years and have done a similar idea with the rinds.

I used 4 boneless skinless breasts that I sliced into cutlets.  And I skipped the additional salt.  I don't think it's necessary on top of the cheese and seasoned bread crumbs.  I spooned a little roasted garlic tomato sauce on top of the chicken the last five minutes of cook time and sprinkled an Italian six cheese blend on top and let it finish up and melt the cheese.  Really so easy and very good.

EDIT 08/02/2012:  Lately when I've made this I've used boneless skinless breasts cut into strips or nuggets.  Four breasts, 1/2 cup butter, 2-3 cloves of garlic minced, a cup of fresh breadcrumbs made with stale Italian bread run through my Ninja prep (love that!), a tsp of freshly ground Italian seasoning, and sometimes I use shredded parm instead of grated, it all depends on what I have.  25 minutes at 350, and turning halfway through.  The kids like to dip them in homemade pizza sauce.  Really good stuff.

This is great!  It was so easy to put together, no hassle at all!  My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL while it was baking!  I covered it for the first 30 minutes, then baked 30 minutes uncovered, and its moist, tasty and crispy.  I'd reccommend this to anyone, and will be making it again!

Very good.  I did add some extra flavor however.  I added red pepper, hot paprica, chili powder, a touch of cumin and poultry seasoning.  I poured the melted butter directly into the cooking dish instead of placing it into a separate bowl.  This way after I coated it, I didn't lose any coating when the extra butter was poured over the chicken in the dish.

I've made this recipe twice now and it's already become a family favorite.  The first time I made it, I didn't have bread crumbs so I did homemade ones.  The second time I had store bought bread crumbs....I liked the coarser, homemade breadcrumbs better, they seemed to crisp a bit more.  Also, I added more parmesan cheese, about 3/4 cup total.

This had a fine flavor but it was not crispy at all. It wasn't like fried chicken and that was what I was hoping for. I appreciated the ease of this recipe but the flavor was just average. I won't make this again.

Yum! Everyone loved this. I used boneless breast and cooked in 40 min. Instead of salt and pepper I sprinkled Adobo seasoning on the chicken and added some in with the bread crumb mixture. During the last five minutes I spooned some spaghetti sauce on the top of each piece of chicken and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella. Can't wait to make it again.

I have been making this for many years.  I use chicken tenders instead of bone in chicken.  I also use italian bread crumbs. This meal is VERY easy and most likely you have all the ingredients on hand...

Love this... very cruncy and tasty. I used cutlets, raised temp to 375 and cooked only 40 min due to thin cut of chicken. I accidently used shredded italian blend of cheese, so I added the parmesan to the top - it was perfect. The extra cheese in the mix gave it a great flavor.

I made it with Italian bread crumbs and spaghetti with marinara sauce. It was pretty good. My chicken was slightly frozen, so it made the breadcrumbs a bit soggy, but it still tasted fine. I will have to make it again!

This was quick and oh so tasty.  Quotes of 11 and 8 yr olds, 'this is the best chicken you've ever made, mom!'  I think next time I'll cut back on butter to make it more "figure friendly."

I made this the other night for dinner and I have to say even my extremely picky daughter loved it. In fact she loved it so much she ate her whole dinner (which never happens) then went back for seconds of the chicken, and if that wasn't proof enough she was even caught eating the crumbs off the baking pan as I was doing the dishes! will defiantly be making this again!

Great recipe!  My 18 yr old daughter helped make it, she is still learning to cook and she thought it was super easy to make.  We used boneless chicken breasts and Italian bread crumbs.  That was the only changes we made and it was fabulous.  My 15 yr old son loved it and asked me to make it the next night.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

When I oven fry chicken, I use this recipe.  It is great.  It makes the house smell so wonderful.  My dog counter surfed and took a whole tray of cooking chicken!  Now I have to hide the chicken while it cools!

This chicken is great!!! My two picky kids asked for seconds and if we could have it again tomorrow! To make this cook faster I used boneless skinless chicken breast and cut them into strips. They cooked in 30 minutes, turning once. They were very tender. Will definitely be making again!

It was great tasting, but we sliced the breast (boneless and skinless) in half and it was even more delicious and stretched out the recipe to serve more and have leftovers...Great recipe!!!

Surprisingly delicious.  In addition to the parsley, I used fresh basil!  I also used panko whole wheat bread crumbs.  I will make this again.

this was very good. i removed the skin to make it a bit healthier and it was still good. i think next time i make it i will use all thighs because they were my favorite pieces. served it w/ traditional mashed potatoes and the green bean and mushroom medley(both from this site). i will definitely make these again.

Great recipe!  Boyfriend really liked this one.  I just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I ran out of parsley so I threw some basil in there (not the same though, I know).  I had it in the oven for a little over an hour at 375 degrees- perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed directions exactly used progresso panko Italian breadcrumbs was wonderful! Used chicken tenders. Boyfriend said it was the best he's ever had. Next time going to try cutting butter with egg just for health reasons. HIGHLY recommend. Will be making again and again.

Way to keep it simple!  I work 12-13 hour days so don't want to spend too much time cooking. Use chicken tenders, cut in 3rds, put oven at 375 F, 20 minutes on one side, flip them, and 20 on the other.  By then my face is washed and my sides are ready.  Still juicy and tender and just a little quicker.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipie was pretty good. The flavor was good. It was a little too greasy even though I didn't use all the butter called for. I also used Italian brad crumbs instead of regular.

This was nice.  I used 2 tbsp butter mixed with a little olive oil for a whole chicken so the breadcrumb did not stick properly.  I think I will mix more olive oil next time to make 1/4 cup.  I did mix half the salt and pepper in the butter and I also plan to do that next time.  It  was a bit salty -- 3/4 tsp salt may be enough.

Delicious! I have been struggling to find good recipes since I was diagnosed with a wheat allergy 4 months ago. I substituted crushed corn flakes for the bread crumbs and doubled the garlic. The whole family loved it!!  It could use a bit of a kick - I may spice up the corn flakes & Parmesan with cayenne next time. We dipped the chicken in our favorite barbeque sauce, which did the trick tonight. This will definitely be added to our rotation.

It is a great recipe. I used the precut chicken strips and the were very delicous. Maybe using a few drops of hot sauce in the garlic butter might add some good flavor, if you like something with a kick. Overall, a fantastic recipe!

I found the chicken way too salty and I didn't even add the salt--glad I didn't.  It wasn't crisp like I expected and generally kind of blah.  I used skinless boneless breasts and baked for 40 mins. Perhaps if I used pieces with the skin on and cooked for 60 to 75 mins as indicated, maybe....(that's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 3 and maybe I'll try it again.)

I used chicken tenderloins and cooked them in about half of the time. They were a big hit with my husband and children. This is a dish that I have used for company as it is simple and something most people will eat.

Quick, easy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Time to cook was about 40 min. Will do again.  Using fresly grated Parmesan made the difference.

I cut breasts and thighs into tender-sized pieces before proceeding, and they turned out very well. I should have cut down the cook time (they were a bit overdone), but otherwise they were absolutely delicious. Next time I might try with crushed crackers as opposed to bread crumbs, as I have had more flaky results with that in the past. Great recipe!

I made this recipe for my family last night and it turned out awesome!! It is so simple to do and was delicious if I do say so myself. My husband raved about it! He absolutely loved it! (he is more picky sometimes than the pre-schooler- so this is saying alot!) Thanks for posting this recipe. It is going into my keeper book!

For a change-I have for years used this same recipe but the difference is substituting rice krispies cereal rolled in a ziploc bag until crumbed to sub for the bread crumbs-combining the rice crispies with the fresh parmesan is a taste treat!

It was just okay for us.  I did use a little more garlic and used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  It was juicy but the coating wasn't what I expected.  Just ok...

I used chicken breast cut into finger size strips.  I sprayed each piece with Pam cooking spray and added 1 tsp. garlic salt to the bread crumb mixture using Italian seasoned bread crumbs then sprayed Pam cooking spray lightly over each strip after the coating.  The cooking temperature and cooking time is still the same.  These were TERRIFIC! I used fat free ranch dressing, barbecue sauce and honey mustard dressing available for dipping. I served with pasta and sliced tomatoes lightly coated with italian dressing.

We both enjoyed this dish. Nothing stood out to us as dominating, but a somewhat nice alternative to traditional fried chicken. I was hoping for a stronger garlic flavor. I'm 12 weeks preg and craving garlic. However the chicken was prefectly done and juicy. We will be making this again. Thanks

This reminds me of shake n bake chicken with a touch of cheese. However I did like it and I will definately make this again as this is an alternative to deep fried chicken, which I'm trying to avoid. LOL

My husband doesn't care for chicken but I love it.  So when he has a special request for something I don't care for, I make myself chicken.  Last night was one of those nights and I wanted something oven baked.  I found this recipe and thought it sounded good.  I baked it using the directions exactly as I always do the first time I try a recipe.  I can honestly say that I think this is the BEST chicken I've ever eaten!  It had great flavor and was extremely moist.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is maybe add more garlic to the butter and try using skinless chicken breasts as a whole fryer chicken is way to much for one:o)  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe - it's a keeper!

I gave it 4 stars, the wife gave it 5.  If she knew how much butter was in this she'd have given it a 2.  Quite tasty and the chicken was perfect at 1 hour.  I added quite a bit more garlic though.

I was looking for a quick chicken recipe last night and ended up trying this one out and it turned out delicious! The breaded crust with the buttery garlic flavor was yummy!! I served it with a baked potato  and my fiancé loved it.

I've got to be honest, this was suprisingly disappointing considering the high ratings, There just wasn't that much flavor. I made it again later dipping the chicken in flour first, adding an egg to the recipe with the butter for the batter to stick better and added basil, and more oregano to the breadcrumbs (and garlic salt), baked them, then added tomato sauce and mozzerella cheese in the last 15 minutes, much more flavor that time!

Yummy!  I made exactly as stated, but used Italian bread crumbs and 4 large chicken breast cut into nugget sized pieces.  It took only 25 minutes to bake, with my small chicken pieces. Yummy! Whole family loves it!

Wonderful recipe.  Have used this on bone-in pieces and also on boneless.  We prefer it on boneless, skinless breasts, but it's good on just about any piece.  Easy, easy, easy.

I did as others said, dipped the chicken twice into the breading.  Since I used boneless breasts, I think it had too much parm cheese for my liking.  I will definately make it again though, just using much less parmesan cheese.

Wow!  I recently made this recipe for my Pastor.  She was responsible for bringing the meat to a conference and asked me to make something.  I converted this recipe to feed 40 and boy was it delicious.  It was so good in fact, my Pastor only got 39 servings...I ate one!  The only thing I did different was that I dredged the chicken in the garlic butter and bread crumbs twice. This gave the chicken a wonderful slightly crunchy crust!  I'll be making this again really soon!  Thanks!

I used chicken breasts and baked for 35 minutes, the meat was juicy and tender. However, the breading was not as thick or crunchy as I wanted. My husband really liked this though.

This dish is excellent.  I used chicken tenders and bake them for 45 minutes!  My husband suggested putting swiss cheese and a red sauce on them next time.  Very juicy!

This was the best oven-fried chicken I've ever had!  I used chicken tenders instead of whole chicken, and I baked it in my toaster oven for about 25 minutes.  They turned out PERFECTLY.  I used more garlic than it called for, to my taste.  This chicken paired perfectly with the red skin mashed potatoes also on this site.

This recipe was really good. For a little more crispness, I added pecan chips to the parmesan mix. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I used Smart Balance, boneless skinless chicken breasts and dried parsley. I baked it for only about 35 minutes. It was extremely flavorful and tender. Yum!

This was great. My husband isn't a very big fan of chicken, but, he loved this. It was very filling and it tastes like it's 1,000 calories. My daughter still wouldn't eat it though.

This was delish! I always read lots of reviews and pick and choose what will work for me, but any changes I made were evidently perfect. Used drumsticks and thighs, panko crumbs, a little less butter, freshly grated Parmesan, and olive oil spray in the baking dish. Company raved.

This was so lovely! My boyfriend adored it and could not get enough of it! I did a couple things differently though. I halved all the breading ingredients and used three boneless skinless chicken breasts. I also ended up pouring over some tomato sauce in the last 10 minutes in the oven and it turned out wonderfully. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I loved it. It was super easy and I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I loved that the gluten free substitute ingredients were listed as I’m gluten sensitive. I didn’t have panko so I used gluten free bread crumbs. I added garlic powder to the bread crumbs for more flavor.

Tip:  I use one pair of tongs to coat the meat in the wet and dry ingredients. It’s a lot less messy and my hands stay clean.

Loving fried chicken, but hating the greasy mess and smell, I decided to try this.
Absolutely delicious. I followed recipe, but added a few shakes of Franks Hot Sauce to the butter mixture for a little kick.
My husband loves it and am making it again tonight.

Excellent oven fried chicken!! Even my husband who loves deep fried chicken loved it and thought it was full of flavor. 
I made it with chicken tenders and they were moist, tender and tasted great!

I subbed regular breadcrumbs for Italian panko breadcrumbs and it turned out great! I also used all chicken drumsticks instead of a whole chicken. Very flavorful and crispy.

Changes made Panko bread crumbs in 1 tbs unsalted butterI used chicken breasts that were obviously double G’s so I butterflied, making 4 breast out of the 2 I had, salt and peppered both sides. Halved the butter used for dipping, added garlic and simmered in the butter to get the raw garlic flavor out. Dipped my chicken breast, both sides then coated the breasts with the toasted crumbs and Parmesan cheese using a large ziplock type bag. Dribbling extra butter sauce over chicken and piling on the extra bread crumbs/Parmesan mixture. Baked @ 350 elevated on a rack for 25 minutes checked internal temp pulled out to rest while they continued reaching a minimum of 160° internally. Family says this is a keeper.

I made this using chicken thighs that were boneless and skinless, and I marinated them in Italian dressing for an hour before I followed the recipe and put them in the oven. I also added my own taste of spices to the bread crumb mixture i.e lemon pepper, etc. They were delicious!! As a side note, I poured marinara over the top after they were done so we had our own version of Chicken Parmesan. I will use this recipe again and again.

I used chicken tenderloins and Romano cheese because I didn't have any parmesan. I also mixed whole wheat bread crumbs with panko for the breading. For the garlic butter I had some leftover garlic herb butter so I just added more butter to it. It came out moist and delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Very good. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I cut in half and reduced the cooking time a little so they were not dry from overcooking. Next time I will cut the chicken breasts into thinner strips for chicken tenders.

My family really loves fried chicken so I've made this recipe  several times.  The first time I prepared it exactly as written.  But we really love garlic and cheese so I've increased both.  I cook it at 400 for 10 minutes and then at 350 for about 35-40 minutes.  Perfect every time.  Thanks for a delicious and easy way  to make crunchy chicken.

This was sooooo good .. I will be making my fried chicken like this from now on!!! I did make a couple changes though. I ran out of bread crumbs, found a little bit of fine cornmeal and added flour. Since my tummy can't handle garlic, I just put my usual spices in the butter. I used drumsticks and the whole family ate them up quick and was looking for more. Kudos!!!!

Muy rica receta y sencilla. En casa ha gustado a los adolescentes y al resto de los adultos. Tanto que me han pedido que la repita al menos una vez a la semana. Al igual que otros comentarios, yo también sugiero disminuir la cantidad de mantequilla y recomiendo que el pollo se ingrese al horno sobre una parrilla para que asi quede dorado por ambos lados y se escurra la grasa

My husband had been wanting some fried chicken but I don't like to deep fry anything. I t doesn't go with my diet. I decided to try out a simple over fried chicken recipe. Surprisingly he loved it! It was a hit. I made Kale and scalloped potatoes. We will be making this again.

Had I baked this for the specified time, it would have been way overcooked. Maybe because I used chicken tenders, but I only had to bake it for 25 minutes, and it was more than done. I didn't have butter, so I used coconut oil, and it came out great!

I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I didn't have too
Much butter mixture left over but what I did I pour it on chicken.  Same with a little bit of left over crumb mixture.
Very good!

Great recipe, impossible to mess this one up. I let the chicken marinade in the garlic butter mixture, using garlic powder for speed and intensity, while I mixed the Panko, cheese (Costco Romano and Parmesian blend), parsley, etc. Cooked a little longer at my altitude, turned out moist on the inside and very flavorful. Fill up your sheet pan--the one with sides-- and put these in the fridge to serve that week to your family a couple different ways. I served with salad and a chunky marinara topping on one occasion, and with a side of pasta on another.

Following the recipe I cut up a few large skinless chicken breasts into 3-4 oz pieces. I used half panko and half regular bread crumbs and baked at 350 for 30 minutes (using a temp probe to the right doneness of 165). Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. My non chicken loving husband said it was 'really good' and 'the chicken is so moist,' and 'it's a do again!'
Next time I will use all panko bread crumbs and increase the temp to 400 to improve the browning and crustiness. This is a fantastic recipe that I will make often :)

Delicious and easy (after husband cut up the whole chicken).  I use 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs and 3/4 cup panko.   Minced fresh rosemary instead of parsley. Used a rack on a cookie sheet and baked at 350 on convection.

I tweaked it a little bit as I have no parsley, used dried organic basil and some Everyday Seasoning from Trader Joe's! Also fresh grated Romano cheese along with the Parmesan! No way should it bake for over an hour, I baked for 60 minutes!

I made this chicken for a week night meal with our grandchildren staying for dinner. According to family this is a keeper, so this recipe is in the make again file. The smell of this cooking in the oven is very enticing with anxious smiles and more cooperation in preparation, table setting, and clean up. No need to change or tweak, enjoyed it just the way it is.

Oh my gosh,  this is deelish!!!  If u like it CRISPIER,.. be sure to turn it over bout 1/2 way thru cooking.   Also,  even tho I loved it, it was a tad bit 2 greasy 4 hubby,  so the next time,  I'd cut down the butter to probably  about 6 Tbs., not a whole stick.  For people on restricted salt diet...cut out the salt as the Parm has enuff of a  salty  flavor.  My daughter & son-in-law both also gave it 2 thumbs up!

this would have been so good if it hadn't cooked too long. the chicken was tough and the coating lovely. thicker chicken pieces or watch the oven. Lol 
a wonderful way to cook chicken and make it better than normal.

I made this for dinner tonight. I only had boneless breasts. I cut them in half horizontally because we like small portions. I used a bit more garlic because we love it. It Wes easy, delicious and a keeper.

The flavor was good, but it wasn't very crunchy.  I was expecting it to be more like a cutlet.  Next time I will use convection and put it on a rack instead of  in a baking dish.

I used this for drumsticks and they were very good and easy to make.  Instead of using the crushed garlic in the butter, I just mixed garlic powder in with the bread crumbs.

This chicken was moist and delicious!  I, like other reviewers,  used boneless chicken breasts;  lightly flattened. At 375 degrees and  35 minutes, it was perfectly done.  Will make again!

I had 2 huge, dinosaur-size, bone-in chicken breasts that I needed to cook.  This was very good and very easy.  The only changes I made were to add a dash of oregano and basil, then to cook at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. Came out juicy and full of flavor!

I finally got a compliment out of my wife! We both love the flavor and she likes that the chicken is baked. We started with cubed watermelon. The side was kale & cucumber salad. Yum.

I made this as written with a 6 pound chicken cut up and skin removed.  I set oven @375, the chicken was done in an hour.  This is a keeper.  The chicken was juicy and without the skin rather healthy but still tasted great.

This was a delicious recipe. But instead of garlic butter, I dipped the chicken in egg. I used Italian reasoning bread crumbs and mixed it with paremesan. Using other suggestions, I cooked the chicken for 35 minutes at the temp 375, the chicken turned out just right. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Ate with buttered/pepper pasta and asparagus with bleu cheese melted on top. Thank you for posting the recipe & suggestions

This is a great recipe that I've made a bunch of times. I alter it to fit our tastes each time. Overall, it's a good base recipe to start with and kudos to the chef. You may like salt, but the chicken ends up being far too salty for us because of the butter and Parmesan cheese, so we skip adding any extra salt. I also use margarine instead of butter, and at least 4x the amount of garlic that this recipe calls for, along with some other spices depending upon my mood at the moment or what we're craving. Try it out and enjoy!

Really yummy!  I did tweak the recipe just a little. First, I used chicken thighs because I find them to be moister and cheaper than breasts. I then melted a block of margarine because I didn't have butter and microwaved that with a generous Tbsp of minced, store bought garlic. I also used panko instead of regular bread crumbs because I wanted the crunch that panko gives. I added a few dashes of paprika to the panko mixture and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese all over the chicken in addition to the shredded parmesan cheese already in the panko mix. Make sure to spray dish with non-stick spray so the chicken comes out with a nice coating. Will definitely make again and again, plus it was easy to make!

This was by far the BEST recipe I have tried for moist and crispy fried chicken. I used a suggestion from another review to melt the butter on stove with garlic cloves to really infuse the flavor. YUMMO!  Bravo to the creator of this recipe!!!

I had 2 HUGE chicken breasts my husband bought yesterday (I thought they were a split turkey breast at first).  I used homemade bread crumbs from stale New Orleans french bread, added parm. cheese, oregano, fresh parsley and basil from the garden (minced), salt and lots of fresh pepper. I heated the butter and garlic in the microwave with a touch of virgin olive oil to cut the butter in half.  Came out moist and crispy.

I really wanted to like this because the batter was pretty tasty, if not a tad salty.  I followed the instructions and cooked it for 1 hour.  The chicken was overcooked.  I cut the chicken breast into 3 equal parts each, so they weren't small pieces.

Excellent.  Better than fried chicken.  Used seasoned bread crumbs for half and panko for the other half (cut salt in half to accommodate)   I doubled the bread crumbs, butter and garlic for a huge tray of legs and thighs (about 9 pounds) for 11 people.  I have about 7 pieces leftover.

for the coating, I used half bread crumbs and half crushed ritz garlic butter crackers.  I prefer romano cheese, and I also added some dried oregano to the crumb mixture.  delecuous!

My picky family loved this very much! I have made similar recipes in the past but not with the adding garlic to the butter and coating the chicken with it before rolling in the breadcrumb mixture. It added a great deal of flavor! I used dry parsley instead of fresh and used additional melted butter to drizzle over the prepared chicken because I ran out by the time all the chicken was coated in the crumbs. Next time I may not use as much breadcrumbs and Parmesan because I threw much out after.

This recipe is great. I have already made it several times. The chicken is moist and great. Since we like garlic, I put more garlic in the butter mixture. Also just bought chicken pieces rather than a whole cut up chicken. One time just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and that was really good and easy. Only cooked an hour as things usually cook faster with no bone. Still juicy. It's really not like fried chicken but really good.

This chicken recipe is really good. The only thing I did different was I fried the chicken instead of baking it. It was so delicious and juicy and my family loves when I make it.

This was so delicious! I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I used more garlic and also grated my own parmesan. I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I substituted my chives. Will definitely be making this again and again!

We love this recipe! I use the Italian style bread crumbs but otherwise follow as directed! The only other thing I do different is towards the end of cooking, I add a jar of any type of spaghetti sauce I have on hand and put some mozzarella on top and bake until cheese is melted! Great for a quick Chicken Parmesan! Great flavor!

Of course, anything you bake in the oven isn't going to have the same texture as something you fry in oil. I, personally, found this to be a fantastic and more flavorful alternative to fried chicken. 

I'm pretty new to the kitchen, and I didn't feel confident that I could cut up a whole chicken without also cutting up my hands with my cheap knives. I opted to use strips of chicken breast for this recipe I cooked them according to the recipe and they were perfect. They were a hit with my family, who enjoyed them both plain and with a bit of tangy barbecue sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using season bread crumbs and omitting the parsley. I made both bone-in thighs and legs, and also some boneless breasts.  It was juicy and delicious.

Easy and very simple, yet tasty.  I added cayenne pepper to my crumbs  and  used drumsticks only.   Chicken came out juicy and full of flavor.

Really good chicken, lots of flavor. I made a few adjustments for my own taste and to make a bit healthier. Instead of butter I brushed the chicken with olive oil. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I grated fresh parm cheese, added lots of garlic. I also increased oven temp to 375 which cut the cooking time. I can only imagine how good it would be using the butter and chicken with the skin!

Pan-seared for about 2 minutes before finishing it in the oven (15 minutes)! The meat was tender and juicy and the crust perfect! Thanks for the recipe :)

Delicious and very easy to prepare! My husband and 14 month old ate this up!!! I used four (4) Natures Own Boneless Chicken breasts. Coated the chicken breasts as directed (except I omitted parsley flakes - I'm not a huge fan) and then baked in the oven at 375 for approx. 35 minutes.  I served with sautéed squash and steamed broccoli.

This was good, but my family likes a little more garlic. So i took 4 garlic cloves, chopped, and cooked them in the butter, in a skillet  until slightly browned. Then brushed the chicken with the garlic and butter, before rolling in the crumb mixture. It was perfect for my familys love of garlic.  But this is easy, and sure to be a hit! With or with out my tweek. :)

Actually got this off the Sara Moulton tv show, but same ingedients.  Made it last night.  Was real good.  I find it so hard to find a good chicken recipe.  I think I will fix this again sometime. I used real chicken next time will try boneless skinless.

I am gluten intolerant so I used potato flakes instead of bread crumbs.  It turn out wonderful.  Even my husband loved it and he is very picky about his fried chicken.

This is basically the same as the garlic cheddar chicken, without the shredded cheese in the bread crumb, parm, parsley mixture.

OMG!!!  We just finished eating this and it was AMAZING!  I also used the boneless, skinless breasts which I halved.  Instead of butter, I used melted cocoa nut oil and reduced the cooking time to 45 min.  I complemented this with some roasted red potatoes and it was a huge hit!  Crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  Thx!

I made this tonight for dibner and it was a huge hit!  My 3 chuldren under 6 devowered it. Nice and juicy and perfectly crisp. I used 4 split chicken breats instead of a ehole chicken and left out the parsley because i was out of it and used itialian bread crumbs and a half cup of parm cheese instead.

I am so in love with this chicken recipe that I served it twice last week - once with spaghetti and marinara and once with mashed potatoes and gravy.  YUM!

Mind blowing! I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro and just added some italian seasoning. The only thing I will change for next time is not tasting it before putting it on the dinner table, that way I can actually eat this dinner with my husband. I lost all self control after that first amazing bite!

This was good, although I must've overdone it with the salt because it was extremely salty.  I have a similar recipe using olive oil instead of butter.  I think I'll stick with that recipe instead of this as it's a little healthier.

This was great! I'm not a very practiced cook, so this was easy for me to make. I added some cayenne for some heat, and my picky husband loved it! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (what I had in the fridge) and it came out delicious!

Loved it. Made it with 2 chicken breasts, baked at 375 for 45 minutes. The coating on the bottom got a little mushy but on top was crispy. I used panko crumbs and dried parsley, oregano and basil in the breading.

Turned out really good.  Forgot to drizzle the remaining garlic butter on top before baking.  I'm sure it would have been even better!  Chicken was really tender.  Will be making this again.

This recipe just didn't work for me. I followed the instructions except used boneless chicken and a tiny bit less butter. I assumed that oven "fried" would create a crunchy topping, or at least something with a bit of texture, but it was a soggy mess. I even increased the oven temp to 400. No one liked it. Too bad, because half of it is left over. I can only hope that it tastes better chopped up to top a Caesar salad. Sorry, won't be making again.

I had some boneless, skinless breasts that I had to use so thought I would give this recipe a whirl.  They were large so I cut them in 4"x4" pieces.  I used Italian style bread crumbs because that's all I had.  After cooking them for 40 minutes, I still couldn't get the coating to crisp up. But after biting into one, I didn't care that the crust wasn't crisp.  The taste more than made up for the lack of crispy!  Will make this again for sure.

Yum!!  I had a dinner party last night for a friend who's favorite dish is Chix Parm. I used this recipe with "The Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site and it was incredible!  Not soggy @ all!  (Note:  I did modify to use thin, skinless Chix breasts and refrigerated approx 20 mins prior to baking). Excellent recipe!!

Changes to original recipe: I added a tablespoon of Italian Season Herbs to the bread crumb mix.  I used boneless/skinless chick breast halves and beat them down to flatten them.  I also used 2 Tablespoons minced jarred garlic and infused it into the butter as it was melting.  After the butter/garlic mixture cooled, I added on egg, and beat it together.  My chicken pieces were quite large, so I halved them again (making 4 quarters out of each full breast).  I dipped each into the egg, butter, garlic mixture and then dropped that into the dry mixture to cover each piece.  I used a 13x9" ceramic cake pan, and did not need to precoat.  I dropped a very small dab of butter on top of each breast piece.  I baked it all for 1 1/2 hour.  I served with penne pasta and marinara sauce, with the chicken parmesan on top.  I would have liked to see a good sauce recipe included in this recipe because I don't think just any tomato sauce will do.  A nice, zesty marinara sauce would work best.

This was delicious. I pounded out the chicken breasts and baked them at 375 for about 40 minutes. I forgot the parsley, salt, and pepper (oops), but it hardly made a difference because I used Italian seasoning breadcrumbs. I lightly brushed the breasts with melted butter and then put the garlic right in with the breadcrumb mixture. No problem there. :) Great recipe! Thank you.

Great make-ahead for camping trips or picnics!  I add the garlic to the butter while it's melting on the stove.  Dredge chicken in flour before the butter.  Dried parsley works well and I also add paprika to the breadcrumb for a nice color.  I do not drizzle the extra butter, as I never have extra!  I cook on 365 for 45-60 minutes, depending on what pieces I'm using.  Boneless, skinless breasts cooked perfectly in 45 minutes.  Refrigerate and reheat at 350 for 15 minutes.

Loved it.  I used chicken breasts, and didn't use that much butter, and had a lot of the coating left so next time I'll cut that down as well.  Very flavorful and made garlic pasta and vegetables to go with it.

Since it was only me and my husband, i only used 2 large chicken breasts.  I cut them into long thin chicken tenders.  I used the butter and garlic called for, but cut the bread crumb mixture in half.   Baked 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  We would make these again hands down.  This was an easy, quick and delicious recipe.

This was fantastic.  I lightened it up a bit by using boneless skinless breasts and less butter and bread crumbs that recommended. Cooked at 400 for about 40 minutes.  The outside was crunchy, the inside was moist. My swaps didn't change flavors and it was delicious. My 4 year old (who hates to waste his time eating) ate an entire chicken breast and asked if he could take leftovers for his school lunch!  I served with Dreamfields pasta, spaghetti sauce, and steamed broccoli.  Definitely going in our monthly rotation!

Flavor was GREAT! Used fresh grated romano cheese and a bit more garlic...as there is never too much garlic for my husband!  I used boneless breasts as always, but I cooked them too long and they were a little dry.  Should have only cooked them for about 40 minutes and they would have been perfect.  Can't wait to make them again.  Will use the leftover in a salad.

I have to admit that I pan fried some of the small leftover pieces and I liked the way they tasted and turned out better. But baking meant I didn't have to stand there the whole time and everyone loved the baked chicken so I would definitely do this again! I added some italian seasoning and used panko bread crumbs.

This recipe is delicious!  We made one change and that was to use seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.  Also, instead of dredging in the crumbs - we coated the chicken pieces by shaking two at a time ina large zip lock bag.  It made clean up so easy!! Can't say enough good things about this one.

We used pork rinds for bread crumbs (low carb) and it still turned out amazing and moist. I only cooked it for 35 minutes since I used thin cut chicken.

I don't normally like chicken but I thought I would try this anyway. I used 4 chicken breasts, pounded them down to about a 1/2 an inch, followed the rest of the recipe and cooked them for 40 minutes. (as suggested by another review.)These were delicious. Cooked perfectly!!

my family liked the flavor of this dish, but we all thought that it was just too greasy (even though i cut the amount of butter in half) and not crispy at all.  i don't know if it's just this recipe, but the term "oven-fried" is misleading.  i might try this recipe again using minimal butter.

This was tender and juicy, the only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I personaly do not like my fried chicken with the garlic and cheese,but my husband loved it!!

This chicken was very moist and tasty.  Used seasoned bread crumbs because that was all I had and skinned the chicken before coating it but it was still tender and juicy with very good flavor!  Husband who absolutely loves fried chicken really liked this and it's much healthier and far less mess to make.  Will definitely make again!

I adapted this recipe for Quorn(TM) "Naked Cutlets", and the result was DELICIOUS. As a vegetarian, I can't say it's comparable to chicken, but my boyfriend said it's nearly as good. The only change necessary was cooking time. This is an easy, easy recipe and the result is fantastic. Thanks very much!

Excellent recipe.  Used 1 tbsp Italian seasoning and 1 tbsp parsley instead of 2 tbsp parsley, but otherwise didn't change a thing.

Became a favorite quickly. So easy! I added a small handful of shredded italian cheese mix to the top of each breast before baking then baked for an hour. Then I spooned marinara sauce over each breast and baked for 15 minutes more. It was restaurant quality!

So much better than frying.  I also used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  Great leftovers too!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 panko breadcrumbs and 1/2 regular breadcrumbs.  The leftovers went for chicken parmesan sandwiches the next day!
