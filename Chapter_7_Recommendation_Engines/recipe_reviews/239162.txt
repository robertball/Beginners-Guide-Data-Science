we absolutely love this dish!...my husband is not a gravy guy, but he slurps this up...I saute the mushrooms first in olive oil and butter with some garlic...set this aside and cook the patties ...remove them and make the gravy, then add back the mushrooms and meat and let it all simmer in the sauce...I serve this with baked potatoes that are broken open with the sauce dumped on them...just YUM

this was so good.  It was simple to follow directions and easy to substitute a couple ingredients.  I used crackers instead of seasoned bread crumbs and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce!

Ok so I have made multiple Salisbury steak recipes on this site before I tried this one and this one is by far the best!!! IT IS PERFECTION, SERIOUSLY!  I have a picky son, and a picky husband and they both said over and over, “this one is a keeper”!  I made it two weeks ago for the first time and ever since they are bugging me for it again.  NO CHANGES FOLKS, not a one!  I know this is a newer recipe to the site, not a ton of reviews but you will not go wrong with this.

There is nothing I would change. This was absolutely delicious. My five year old granddaughter is picky and ate every last drop of the meat. Thank you for sharing. This will be a staple in my house from now on.

This was a great comfort food for a rainy day.   I made as per the recipe and served with mashed potatoes.  Only one dislike in the family, she thought it was "mushy".  Picky 13 year old so take that with a grain of salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fast and easy.  Very good, I loved it.  The only change I made was I added a carton of fresh mushrooms.  It was just delicious and I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

What a delicious recipe! I hate mushrooms anything but I stuck to the recipe and they were awesome. I will only eat them with this. My family and I ate the entire dish served over rice. In my opinion this recipe taste better than the "most popular" recipes on this site. Thanks bunches for uploading it.
