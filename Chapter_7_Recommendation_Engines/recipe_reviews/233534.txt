LOVED IT!!!!! I am a lover of Lebanese-style salads (after all, I am part Lebanese, lol), and this was no exception. Really great combo of flavors and the dressing was just right, IMO. I did use the optional ground sumac. I did not have Greek seasoning on hand, so I just used Italian seasoning (I know it's NOT the same), but it worked well. Also, I didn't measure any of the salad ingredients, just eyeballed everything. This was a huge hit tonight and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great dressing and salad contents! However if you're going to eat this salad with a fork don't shred the lettuce. The leftovers will be inside a slice of pita bread!
