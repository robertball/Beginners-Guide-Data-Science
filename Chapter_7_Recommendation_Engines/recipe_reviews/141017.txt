Outstanding!  Used FF 1/2 & 1/2 and low fat mayo ... 4 serranos and 4 cloves of garlic ... 3/4 of a bunch of cilantro.  I poured it over Tilapia and baked them.  Served with rice and roasted asparagus.  We just LOVED this sauce ... next time I'll add at least 1 more serrano pepper.  After dinner we were looking for a snack and ate this with tortilla chips ... delicious that way also!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

The is awesome! I roasted the chillies, and removed the charred skin and seeds. I alsoadded juice from 1/2 a lime and 3/4 tsp of sugar. Very good on top of fajitas.

I've decided I really like this. I followed this recipe exactly and let it meld a day or so. I used it on some broiled tilapia filets and it was good. DH said it tastes a little bit like a spicy ranch dip. (?) I think next time I'll do as Krazykhat suggested and add a squeeze of lime. My husband and I both think this would make a great dip for a veggie tray. I'm glad I tried it. This recipe will come in handy. Thank you for posting.

Super hot and super delicious.  So easy to make.  I threw everything in the food processor and it was ready in just a couple of minutes.  I used sour cream instead of the heavy cream...1. to make it thicker and 2.  that is what I had on hand.  Best served chilled, we thought.  I think I will use a whole bunch of cilantro next time.  But great as is.  Served with Chipotle Shrimp Tacos from this site.  Huge hit with both my son and myself.  Plan to use leftovers for other meats...maybe chicken tomorrow.  Thanks Luci!!

Love this sauce!   Awesome and so full of flavor.  I served it on top of grilled chicken tacos but I can definetly see this being great on fish tacos.  I hate using cream for anything so I decided I had to sub half and half for it.  Of course it came out rather thin so I took an extra step and threw everything in a saucepan, added 1 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in a little water.  It thickened beautifully and it was still awesome!

LOVED this.  Used as a dip but this would be great on fish like others have suggested.  I am going to change it up a little.  Use sour cream next time and roast the serranos with onions.  YUM!

Very tasty. Now I don't have to run to Sharky's restaurant when I'm craving a gourmet fish burrito. I used this sauce in a shrimp burrito... and so good. I ended up freezing the left over sauce in small baggies rather than throw it away and it tastes very fresh still. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This seemed a lot more like a dip than a cream sauce. It was just okay, it was the mayo that makes it 3 star, it didn't seem to go with the rest of the ingredients, at least to me & seemed to throw it all off. I might try sour cream next time & see if that works better. Thanks for the inspiration!  PS....when you are working with the chilies make sure to !!!WEAR GLOVES!!! I made that mistake & my hands were honestly red & stinging/burning for 2 days. It was horrible!

I've made this numerous times now and it is truly fantastic as a dip as well as a sauce.  I have used it on chiken, pork and as an alternative to mayo for Turkey sandwiches. If you are looking to cut the fat substitute lowfat plain yogurt for 1/2 Mayo and try 1/2 cup of fat free 1/2 & 1/2. You can also substitue a hotter pepper if you like. Very good recipe.

Seriously good! My store didn't have serrano so I used jalapeno, left some membranes in for heat and used low fat half and half. Served over sauteed tilapia, but I can see using this in other ways as well. Did I mention that I loved it?

I made half the recipe and then changed it a bit. I used the whole bunch of cilantro, 4 cloves garlic and 2 large serranos, 2/3 cup f f 1/2 & 1/2, and the 1 cup of reg mayo. I used this sauce over sauteed tilapia. Delicious.

OMG!  This sauce is wonderful!  There is a mexican Restaurant in Houston (Chewy's) that has a similar sauce called creamy jalepeno, this sauce is VERY close.  I made it exactly as written and it couldn't have been easier to make.  I thought it would be too spicy for me but it wasn't hot at all.  I think next time I might try adding a couple more serano peppers and maybe more cilantro.  (I love cilantro)  I wonder if this freezes well?  I'm going to try it.....If I could give this more than 5 stars I would...did I mention how good it is???  LOL

This stuff was amazing with chicken enchiladas the other night. I had no intended use for the leftovers, but was determined not to toss them. Yesterday, I found myself devouring a bag of tortilla chips with them while I cooked. YUMMY!

For health reasons I used Greek yogurt instead of cream. It was delicious.

Rather than mayo and heavy cream (+lots of fat and calories!) I used 1 cup greek yogurt, didn't seed my serrano's (like the heat!), added a small, peeled cucumber and a tomato (just happened to have these from the garden on the counter) and puree all together.  Didn't add salt or pepper.  Served on fish tacos, and it was absolutely delish!

Even though I didn't make this as written, I'm still giving it 5 stars.  We loved this sauce.  I used plain yogurt instead of cream and omitted the pepper.  I  will make it again with the pepper because I think it would be even better with some spice, but because of my kids, I omitted it.  We had this on fish tacos and it was perfect.  This is such a easy recipe, I will make it again and again.

I've finally found the perfect sauce for fish tacos!  I made this a little on the lighter side using low fat mayo and replacing the cream with plain yogurt.  Delicious!

We really wanted to love this, but...it just didn't have enough flavor.  We followed the recipe exactly, and didn't taste the serranos, cilantros or garlic.  If we try it again, we will reduce the mayo by half, use light sour cream instead of mayo (and also reduce the amount), and add in a few serrano seeds (we like a kick).

Great recipe! We are trying to cut back on the fat, so I substituted sour cream for the mayo and heavy cream (which sounds delicious). We like it spicy, so I added more serrano (two full with a few seeds) for an eight serving batch. This was a perfect topping for our fish tacos, and made and incredible dip for the artichokes. Thanks again!

I really enjoyed this.  I served it over some chicken tacos.  I think it would make a lovely dip with tortilla chips or carrot sticks too.  I subbed the cream for low fat sour cream and used low fat mayo rather than regular. You can vary the heat by changing up the size, amount, and type of fresh peppers you use.  I used jalapenos.

I have to admit, I was very skeptical of this recipe when I first found it, but I decided to make it anyway. Honestly, I'm glad I did! This is fabulous! I  didn't have any heavy cream, so I used sour cream. I served this with southwestern egg rolls (another recipe from this site) and it was divine.

This is the best sauce. My whole family loved it. I think I will use only 2 cloves of garlic next time. I'm goingt to try a chicken pizza using this as this base. Store bought rotisserie chicken, this sauce and your imagination. Great recipe, glad I tried it. Thanks

This stuff is awesome.  We use it for shrimp tacos and also just to dip chips in.  I make a vegan version for food allergy reason and it works great.  I use veganaise instead of regular mayo  and sour supreme instead of the heavy cream.  I also use half the amount of chilis, but that is just perference.  I was really glad to find this recipe.  Thanks!

You don't need to tweak this recipe  in my opinion... this is the one of the best chicken taco sauces... the only thing I changed about it was maybe add a few more peppers and/or garlic depending on taste and whose eating it.

Tip: I put the blender into the freezer right away and let it sit there for a good 10 minutes. Then I let it chill for an hour in the fridge. Ideally you'd want this to chill overnight for best flavor and texture.

I have to be honest, I made changes to fit what I had on hand. But it still turned out great! I made 3 cups of sauce instead of two.
 
CHANGES (for 3 c. sauce): 3 fresh green chilies (seeded) + 2 dried bird's eye chilies (seeds in). Had no mayo, used equal amounts cream cheese and plain Greek yogurt to sub. Added about 2 tbs. fresh lemon juice, and 2 tbs. fresh minced green onion.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding the lemon and green onion. The sauce beforehand was good but seemed a little flat, like it was missing something (hence 4 stars). This really brought out the flavors and enhanced the sauce. Also, we like it hot, but not so hot you have to take a "mouth break" to keep your mouth from feeling like it's burning. This seemed to be the perfect amount of heat for us. Mine turned out to be more of a sauce consistency than a dip (although for my purposes I kinda wished it was more like a dip). Still tasted great! We put the sauce in a jar and I put the rest that couldn't fit in a cup, and I ended up literally drinking it!

So easy and so good!  I substituted Greek Yogurt for the heavy cream, so the consistency was probably a bit thicker than it would have been otherwise (IMO with cream it would have been a bit too runny for a dip).  Has a good amount of heat, but not overpowering.  

Will definitely be making again.

We really loved this! I used lite mayo because that was what i had on hand, i might try using sour cream instead next time to add a bit of tang. Or maybe just a squeeze of lime juice to brighten it up a bit. We used this instead of mayo on our garden burgers, i'm already running through ideas on what to make tomorrow so we can utilize the rest of this dip! Seriously was delicious! Thanks for the recipe :)

Wow!  Yum!  We ate it on fish tacos and by itself on chips.  The raw garlic reinforces the heat of the peppers in an interesting way.

Remember to wear gloves when chopping up those serranos people!!! This is a delicious sauce and would have given it 5 stars, but my hands are still burning like crazy from scraping out the seeds with my fingernails...BIG mistake! My husband eats it like a dip and loves it, but I'm not that brave...it's more like a hot sauce to me!

I used Brown Cow Cream Top Plain yogurt instead of cream.  I used 1/2 C lowfat mayo and 1/2C regular mayo.  Everything else the same.  My Serranos and garlic cloves were really big so it was nice and spicy.  No salt and pepper needed. I used this on grilled mahi tacos.  It's saucy, not like a dip.  Excellent!  Just the sauce I've been looking for.

Very good on grilled fish tacos!  To make it lighter I used light mayo, light sour cream, and a little milk.  Peppers added a great kick!  Would make a great salad dressing too.  Will definitely be using this recipe again- thanks!

This was good, but not anything spectacular. I didn't have serrano chiles so I used regular chiles. I used half cream and half milk and it came out just fine. I mixed it up in some veggies and pasta. It's a great quick dish. I would recommend this recipe.

This is great with chicken lime tacos that I make in the crock pot. I also add about 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of celery salt and juice from one lime. It's a hit every time! I love this recipe!

I made this with sour cream instead of the heavy cream, used a whole bunch of cilantro instead of a half of a bunch, and added some lime juice. It was excellent as a dip for chips or vegetables and also as a sauce over chicken.

I found this to be a little bland as written, but with a few tweaks it was fantastic. I started out making a half recipe since it was just for me, made it as written and tasted it. I ended up adding more cilantro, serranos, and garlic - basically my final version was 1/2 cup each of mayo and cream, 1 bunch of cilantro, 3 serranos, and  2 large cloves of garlic. This was quite good. I then added 1 small avocado, which made it like a sauce from a popular chain restaurant, only better!

I made it originally because I had more serano peppers growing in my garden than I knew what to do with. It was wonderful just by its self with chips. Also goes well with tilapia as suggested, if it doesn't dissappear before dinner.

Didn't have serranos but had Jalapenos so I used those as a substitute.  Excellent!  Great kick to this recipe while still having excellent flavor.  Used it on a pork roast, in tacos, and also as a vegetable and chip dip!  Definitely making it again.

This recipe was fantastic, I love the taste.  Although I should have used more cilantro, but that's just me, I really like cilantro.  I also substituted the heavy cream with sour cream.  I used it as a dressing on my grilled chicken salad and then used the rest to cover fish I baked in the over later that night.  Thank you!

This is a great little kick! If you want more spice, add another Serrano pepper. I added a little more garlic as well. I would advise using fresh garlic and pressing it yourself instead of going with jarred garlic. This sauce goes awesome on grilled mahi-mahi tacos and fresh burritos.

Heavy cream, no. 1 cup mayo, no. Did One cup of sour cream, and half cup of mayo, hellman's olive oil mayo. And halved a large jalapeno, seeded half, kept the veins. The rest I followed to the letter, A splash, probably tsp of lime or lemon. DID NOT ADD SALT. Used a blender. After fish taco's it was a great verde goddess dressing. Very potent, but held up for several days, and got better every day. Oh, man, done with ranch..... Solid recipe.

My family raved about this sauce.  I served it on blackened fish tacos.  My husband said it was better than any he had ever had.  I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream for 1/2 cup of the heavy cream.  I did not have Serrano chili peppers so I substituted about a tsp of some sauce from a can of adobe peppers I had in my pantry.  This is an excellent base recipe and I will definitely use it again.

I didn't have cream, so I used 1/2 Greek yogurt & 1/2 light mayo. I also didn't read very well, so I mixed it altogether and added a little freshly squeezed lime juice to make it more creamy. It was delicious! Very easy, I'll definitely use this again!

I made this into more of a salsa because I have a ton of serrano peppers. I used about 8 serranos broiled with garlic and a bit of onion for about 7 min. Pureed them with the cilantro added 4 tbs of lemon juice 1/4 c vegananise and 1/4 c plain yogurt instead of cream. Add salt to taste. It did make significantly less all together but the lemon really brings out the cilantro.

This dip is simply awesome!  We ate it on fish tacos and as a dip for chips and grilled shrimp also.  I did add some lime juice, which I would recommend.  I also used less peppers due to family preference. Definitely one of the best dips I've ever made, especially given the relative simplicity of it.  Great recipe

Awesome!  Used 2 chilies instead and added 1 avocado for creamier texture.

Delicious! For a healthier version, I substituted the heavy cream for 1 cup plain greek yogurt and used 3/4 cup of mayo and it came out still tasting great. Will use this as a dip or sauce for other meats.

I substituted sour cream for mayo, and liked it quite a bit.  To mix it up with leftovers during the next meal, I mixed in some Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce, which was a yummy combination.

Delicious served with Mahi Mahi fish tacos and Taco slaw (also from All recipies)!  Family (parents and children) loved it!  It has a bite but not unpleasantly so.  Served with smoked chicken in a wrap and on various other foods.  YUM!  Great stock item to have on hand!

Excellent as written! I also have used light mayo and half cream/half sour cream. Spice is just right. Just like Gringos green sauce which my family devours by the bucket.

The cilantro is a little overpowering and by taking all the seeds out of the serranos, it's not very spicy.

Tried this to use for fish tacos.  My family doesn't care for too much heat, so I substituted a whole poblano chile, and added a teaspoon of hot sauce.  I used reduced fat buttermilk instead of cream because I had about a cup left in the fridge.  It turned out great - will definitely be a keeper!

This sauce is wonderful! I have an allergy to avocados and this takes to me like guacamole with a bite. Awesome thanks for the recipe. My husband says its gonna be a weekly with our chicken tacos.

This is an amazing sauce. I initially made only one batch, poured it over chicken and penne topped with pepper jack, and baked it. The flavor was phenomenal. It was so good that later we made a double batch and dipped crackers in it. 

Takes less than ten minutes to make and tastes like it takes a lot longer!

Great idea for cilantro and garlic!  I tried it another way for piping into little pickled sweet peppers:  I just used one 8oz brick softened cream cheese, one bunch cilantro and 2 cloves garlic with about 1/2t salt.  Threw it all into the processor and let it blend til light green, then chilled, scooped it into a ziplock bag, snipped the tip and used it for the pepper filling.  Beautiful little appetizer with an excellent taste, really complemented the pickled sweet red peppers.  Filled about 30 pepper with some left over for crackers.  Thanks for the great idea!

Awesome stuff! Had half and half on hand, so used half cup of that, with half cup sour cream.....used 5 garlic cloves...yum... and almost a full bunch of cilantro, everything else the same.. Thickened up nicely, perfect for a squeeze bottle. Going to check it out on grilled chicken tacos tonight!

ridiculous. I used half & half instead of cream, and I halved the recipe but probably added much more garlic & peppers than called for because I gotta be me. I drizzled this over Chipotle Shrimp Tacos (from this website) and oh my was this good. oh yes. yes it was.

This was really good. I served it with "Lime Chicken Soft Tacos" and as a dip for tortilla chips. If I was to use it as a dip again, I would omit the salt in the sauce because the chips made it salty enough.

This is a really good sauce. I was unable to get serrano peppers, so I opted for chili peppers. I roasted them in a 450 oven...cook on sheet untill blisters remove then let "sweat" in a sealed plastic bag for 15 min. Based on the reviews, I too used lime juice. It went great on black bean veggie burgers with avocado. I can't wait to share this recipe!

Fabulous sauce.  Can use it on chicken or pork.  It is great as a dip for veggies.
