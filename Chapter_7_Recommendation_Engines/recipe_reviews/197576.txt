Please pay attention to all of the 5-star reviews, particularly those who made no changes to the recipe, other than maybe using regular bacon rather than maple (I used regular bacon too) - because they are dead on accurate.  I have to admit I made these today basically as an experiment out of curiosity.  The chocolate-bacon combo has been a hot trend for awhile and I wanted to check it out for myself.  Now I don't know if it's necessarily the bacon in these cookies that makes them so awesome good, but trust me and all the other 5-star reviewers, this is just a fantastic, perfect chocolate-chocolate chip cookie, one of the best I've ever tried as a matter of fact. I had Hubs try one without telling him the "mystery ingredient" and while he didn't notice the bacon, he quickly devoured it (eating the whole thing quickly is a VERY good sign of a VERY good cookie).  I tried one myself and what struck me immediately was the lightness of this cookie - a completely different texture and density than others I've tried. I did notice the bacon, but perhaps only because I was looking for it -and the hint of it was nice, and just right.  I wouldn't add any more. If the cookie is good already, what would be the point?  And if I wanted a bacon cracker, or a bacon sandwich, I'd look for another recipe. These are delicious - moist, fudgey but light with just the slightest crispness on the surface.  Trying this  excellent chocolate-chocolate chip cookie today was sheer serendipity.

I wanted to try this as close to the recipe as I could. I used half butter, half Crisco and I chilled the dough during the kids' quiet time before baking. That was the only change I made. I used my small cookie scoop for uniform cookies and they were done at about ten minutes to the chewy-soft stage that our family likes. My kids and I fell in love with these. Oh em gee, you should have heard them go sideways over chocolate-bacon cookies. I recommend you use a quality maple bacon, I bought mine at Tacoma Boys, and I cooked it on tinfoil to crisp in the oven. This one's a keeper. I'd like to try this cookie dough recipe in Lovestohost's cupcakes! NOTE: I made a second batch today, this does work with all butter, as long as you chill the dough. These ARE absolutely delicious. Completely addictive.

These are an excellent cookie!   DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE BACON!  Trust me. Chocolate & bacon make for a happy marriage...they're like (trying to think of a happy celebrity marriage to use for an example....still thinking.....) LTH & Mr LTH (I gave up).  I followed the recipe, except I halved it because I didn't have enough bacon for the whole recipe. I also don't care for maple, so I used regular bacon.   I made teaspoon sized balls (and I didn't flatten them) and they made perfect little bite sized cookies.  Be sure to almost OVERcook your bacon so it falls apart when you touch it.  Don't be afraid to give these a shot; they're worth it!

Absolutely delicious.  My mother said they were the best cookies she'd ever eaten.  I recommend substituting brown sugar for white for a richer flavor.  Make sure to blend the *room-temperature* butter and sugar FIRST before you add any other ingredients, and use a handmixer.  Otherwise, the butter is nearly impossible to fluff and will just break up and make the batter lumpy.  I'd also recommend putting the bacon into a food processor to crumble so that the pieces are a consistent size.  There is *very* little liquid in this recipe (just the eggs and vanilla), so the batter, with all the ingredients, is going to be extremely thick.  I actually destroyed my handmixer trying to mix it (it started smoking and just broke), so I'd recommend only mixing this by working it with your hands or in a sturdy standing mixer.  You can make the balls of batter tablespoon-sized for a bigger, more moist cookie, and don't flatten them!  Refrigerate for one hour before baking so the cookies will be thick.  I baked for 14 minutes, and they were flawless, or, bake them until the very outer edges have hardened slightly and the rest of the cookie is still very soft.  My new favorite cookie of all time!

When I saw bacon and chocolate chips together, I thought they would turn out nasty. Now, they're my new favorite. Combining the best of both worlds, meat and chocolate, This is simply delicious with a savory twist. The only thing I recommend is to not add 2 cups of chocolate chips- it can overpower the bacon.

I really want to give this recipe 10 STARS!!!! They are officially my NEW FAVORITE COOKIE!!! I ate so many this evening I have a tummy ache. Who knew these little gems could be so danged good? I followed the recipe exactly and added a sprinkling of kosher salt on top immediately upon taking them out of the oven. They are addicting and I'M ADDICTED. I actually don't know if I should make them again. I may need  monitoring or a 12 step progam. Thanks for a wonderful recipe MegPie!

I love bacon.  I love chocolate chip cookies.  I don't think the two are compatible textures.  The flavour was okay, it was just strange to come across little hard bits of bacon.  I used relatively thick bacon cut into small pieces.  We'll see how they go over at work tomorrow - I work with all boys.  Bacon anything should be a hit.

I had originally tried the bacon/chocolate combo in a cupcake, and after loving that, started searching for similar recipes!  I made the recipe exactly as is, and so far it's delicious!  We'll see what my husband thinks when he gets home...

I halved the recipe in case we didn't care for them. I wish I would have gone ahead and made the whole batch. These are delicious. Addicting sweet/savory, perfect little cookies. My first batch spread a little more than I like so I just put the batter in the fridge for about and hour and used a small ice cream scoop and they turned out great. Used regular bacon (I don't care for maple flavor) and chopped the bacon so you could still see it and taste it. We will definately make these again. Thanks for sharing!

At our State Fair they sell bacon strips dipped in chocolate - they call them 'pig lickers' and they are pretty awesome.  Given that, I expected these cookies to be good and they were. They were moist and chocolatey, with just that little hint of bacon.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll use 8 or 10 strips instead of 6.  The recipe says it yields 36 cookies.  I got 66 cookies with a 2 inch diameter.

I used regular bacon and semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than the chunks because those were what i had on hand. I also chilled the dough for a little bit before baking. These cookies were delicious! There is no noticeable bacon flavor other than when you get a bite of cookie with a piece of bacon in it, so if you're looking for a recipe where the bacon is the star, this probably isn't it. But the basic cookie recipe is fantastic, and would be equally great substituting nuts in place of the bacon.

Great cookies!  Soft on the inside just the way I like it.  My fiance loved them and was surprised at the "secret" ingredient.  It is not an overpowering bacon flavor, but the whole point is to compliment.  You take a bite and wonder what is that?...they are yummy.

Moist, chewy and suprisingly really good!!  I didn't use the maple bacon, just what I had on hand.  Very good though.  Just have to make sure not to have thick sliced bacon next time!!

I made half the recipe, and followed the directions.  My cookies didn't flatten out, but they still turned out fabulous.  They were cakey and mosit, like a brownie.  The bacon was excellent.  We ate them in one day!

WOW! I'll be honest, the 1st time I saw this recipe I was pregnant & wanted everything! I didn't make them b/c everyone else thought I was nuts (esp my hubby) so I saved the recipe. Well, I am no longer pregnant & decided to make them today just to see what they'd be like - I am NOT disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly (but did not have the maple bacon - I buy turkey bacon so I used that) It was hard not to use brown sugar in a chocolate chip cookie recipe but I resisted since I wanted to make it the exact way the author did. Make these! Do not change things around & give this recipe a lower rating than it deserves!! It's fantastic & I know I'll be making it again!! My 5 year old son just said, "Mmm! I like bacon!" :o) Can't wait for the hubs to get home & try!

Excellent cookies!  Love the texture and rich, chocloate flavor!  I am going to make these for my family's cookie swap and see how they are received.  Why have I never put bacon in cookies before?????

Made these for my friend's birthday. He's a big beer fan. These cookies are AWESOME with a milk stout!  I used a 'good quality' bacon and people sure noticed.  I used 1 cup semi-sweet mini chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips.  I made the dough a few days before and let it ... marinate? in the fridge. I undercook them just a touch because I like my cookies gooey!!

I really like these cookies, they are very moist. The thing different i did with the recipe is I used a 1/2 cup of cocoa powder (because that is all i had left) but i think it was more than enough.  I cooked the first batch for the recommended 12 min. and let them stand for 5 min. but they still fell apart on the wire rack. So the second batch I cooked for 14 min. and let stand for 7 minutes before transferring to the rack to cool.

I'm so happy that I took the chance on this recipe!  These cookies are very chocolatey with just a hint of bacon.  Definitely no overpowering bacon taste.  A must try for any experimental baker!

Amazing! Even without the bacon, this cookie is incredible. It went over so well at a Thanksgiving party, I made 6 dozen to bring to my various Christmas Eve and Christmas stops. Even those who firmly stated they do not like bacon loved these cookies. I followed the recipe, but since I enjoy overloaded cookies, I used 9 strips of bacon and a little over 2 1/3 cups of chocolate chunks (chunks work much better in this recipe than standard chips.) I recommend parchment paper on the baking sheets and chilling the dough before baking. The cookies have a much better shape that way.

I am giving this recipe a 4 because the chocolate cookie part was so good. Howeve, I can only assume it was the bacon that left an odd after taste that lingered for hours. I gave one cookie to a coworker for their opinion, without mentioning the funny after taste, and they gave it the same critique as I did "good chocolate cookie, but an after tatste". I'll try the basic recipe again, but will leave out bacon.

Excellent cookies! I think that if you add more bacon, it'll be even better. I used 8 strips and it still wasn't enough after I baked off my first batch. I cooked up 3 more strips, crumbled them, and sprinkled them on top. Regular bacon would probably be better then maple because the sweet maple blends too easily with the sweet chocolate.

Added this recipe to our traditional Christmas cookies this year.  My husband enjoyed them, but did remark that they needed more bacon. (Of course, he's a man!) Will make these again, but will be doubling the bacon and crumbling into larger pieces rather than chopping fine.

Good, but I needed to keep the bacon pieces larger.  Couldn't really taste the bacon much.

I was expecting a stronger bacon flavor, but it's barely there -- and only when you get a piece in the bite.  However, the cookie itself was very tasty and, like other posters have said, the texture was really great.

I followed this recipe exactly, and although this was a great cookie, we couldnt really taste the bacon. Every few bites we got some bacon, and it was a neat texter, but no bacon flavor as all. Overall, this is a super cookie for big chocolate lovers. It went great with vanilla ice cream!

WOW!!! Awesome cookie! I am always looking for something new and different and these fit the bill! I also used regular bacon... didn't want the extra sweetness of maple. The only change I made was that I used splenda instead of sugar. Will definately make these again. Bringing them to my Bible study tomorrow! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

The chocolate flavor was great.  I think I chopped my bacon too small and as a result, no one could really taste it.  I would advise that you keep your bacon pieces on the bigger side and regular flavor.  The maple is too sweet.

WOW! I made these cookies for my office, the only thing I regret is that I didn't make more for myself. They came out so moist, super chocolatey, super delicious. The only thing I changed was I added about 4 more slices of bacon :) but everything else was exact

Amazing.  That's all I can say for a description.  Whomever I make these for loooove them.  The guys especially run to them.  The women kind of look puzzled to know the ingredients yet decide they want the recipe shortly after.  Easy to make and wonderful to serve! Thanks so much.

What a fun and GREAT cookie!  I liked that it was just a hint of bacon.  I did use sea salt and a little more than it called for to add to the saltiness of the cookie, and I used dark chocolate cocoa powder.  Yum!

This recipe was great. There isn't really a strong bacon taste. It is very very chocolate-y. I used regular bacon and regular chocolate chips because that was what I had on me and it turned out just fine. I can't wait to share them with friends.

I halved this recipe and used regular bacon and milk chocolate chips.  They were an absolute hit!  Not terribly bacon-y, which sounds like a bad thing (more bacon=better, no?) but it really gives the cookie a good balance.  Will definitely make again!

I had just phenomenal reviews when I made these cookies.  I did make just a few changes, but I followed the recipe.  I brown sugared my bacon and baked it in the oven to cook.  I used Bourbon Vanilla extract from Trader Joes and then I use Vanilla Salt (I infuse my own salts) and they turned out crispy on the outside and nice and soft inside!  My husband is a huge bacon lover and I'm pregnant with a bacon craving.  These cookies satisfied both of our cravings! :)

My two favorite foods-chocolate and meat!! Finally a recipe that incorporates the two into a warm, gooey and chewy   sense-tingling cookie! Oh yeah, I also used regular bacon-no flavoring.

This was delicious! One suggestion I would use is maybe use a little more bacon and when I made my batch the bacon was all clustered into one area of the batter so make sure the bacon is spread out evenly through out the batch.

Everyone loved this but the minute I said bacon they made a funny face, I almost had to talk some people into eating it, but once they did they enjoy it. Also my niece, who hates chocolate gobbled these down. I did use 8 slices of regular bacon, I just added a little maple syrup to the batter. This is a great way to use up some left over bacon. I will make these again.

These are surprisingly good.  The bacon is just a little hint in the chocolate and gives that nice salty/sweet flavor.

I make this recipe all the time because everyone always requests these super yummy cookies! I do not change anything about the recipe and it always turns out great. Do note that the batter is a little drier than what you may be used to, but don't deviate from the original recipe - I promise it will turn out.

The combination of bacon and chocolate and this recipe did not disappoint. I followed it exactly, even the timing, which I hardly do. These cookies are like a moist brownie in the middle with slight crunch around the edge. The bacon adds a nice surprise when you find a piece, but for those who decide to omit it, the cookie stands strong on its own. If I changed anything, I would add more bacon for true bacon lovers.

Bacon makes everything better...sometimes. I know these got a bunch of great reviews, but I thought they were just ok. The bacon flavor didn't really stand out to me & I even added a few extra slices. I hardly noticed it but for a little texture here & there. I might even make them without the bacon sometime.

Ok... these are to die for! I followed the recipe completely except I used 10 sliced of CenterCut Maple Bacon.... still does not have an overpowering bacon taste... just enough of a blend of the sweet and salty. Perfect! I am freezing them for a party next week so I hope the bacon texture doesn't get to soft.

My son loves bacon, like most of us do, and when I joked about this recipe he really wanted us to make it.  I thought these cookies were really good.  They were actually better after totally cooling.

I followed the recipe and my cookies turned out extremely thin. My only change was that I microwaved the bacon for about 6 minutes which gave me the perfect crumbly texture, but I know that would not affect the thinness of the cookie, it just made for faster and easier bacon cooking. Perhaps next time I will try adding more flour for a slightly fluffier cookie.

Everyone who tried these loved them.  The bacon flavour is pretty subtle when the cookies are still warm but it gets a little more noticable once they cool down.  I used 1 cup of crumbled bacon (it comes in bags by Hormel and Kirkland) and re-sauteed it down to about 3/4 cup of crispy bits.

My grandson is the maple flavored bacon and sausage king and loved these cookies.  They are on his list for a repeat.  I found that the flavor needed to mellow and the cookies were much better the second day and beyond.

Enjoyed, I should have cooked the bacon crisper.  ended up as chewy (not good chewy) in different spots when eating cookies.

wow! i was not expecting these to be so amazing! i made just as is the first time for a party and they were quickly eaten up.

I agree with the reviewer who said that this is an excellent cookie base. I made a second time without the bacon or cocoa and added a bag of butterscotch chips and about 3/4c of coconut. delicious. i also used 1/2 c butter and 1/2c shortening because i think it provides a richer taste. thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this cookie.  I used regular bacon because it was in the fridge.  I crushed it fine, maybe too fine because the bacon flavor was barely evident.  But it is one of the best choco-choco chip recipes. Fudgy center.  I made my heaping tablespoons and cooked 10 mins w/convenction on.  Just right.  Maybe next time I will leave the bacon abit larger.  I used unsalted butter for a decadent cookie.

The batter is very thin, so don't be surprised when it makes a huge mess as you're transferring it to the cupcake pans.  These came out very tasty, however did not keep well.

Excellent cookies.  Every year for Christmas I pick a new cookie to make and this year it was this one.  I got mixed looks when I mentioned them, but everyone has been raving about them once tasted.  I've always been a big fan of the salt/sweet combination and this one doesn't disappoint.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I just had to make these...and they are delicious!  The bacon is not overwhelming at all.  I didn't have maple bacon so I added just a bit of maple extract...seemed to work just fine.  Mine came out alittle flat but still very tasty!  Can't wait for my family to try them.

I made these for our annual bacon fest over the summer and they were a hit! Not sure why some complained theirs came out dry...mine were soft and moist and stayed that way for days. Fantastic cookies, though I couldn't really taste the bacon as much as I hoped. But that might be because I might have crumbled/chopped it too fine. Next time I may try either doubling up on bacon, or cutting back on the chocolate chips a little. But wonderful recipe, will be making again!

I overlooked the bacon. I believe it needs to have at least some of the bacon grease ooze out of the bacon.  Otherwise really good!

My son wanted to make bacon cookies for his brother for Christmas. While I thought it was an odd request, I looked for a recipe ... sure enough, here they were. They were a huge hit, even for those who were skeptical of bacon in cookies. The salty bacon pairs nicely with the chocolate.

I was challenged to make a 'bacon dessert' as a novelty for a bacon-lover.  I accepted with the expectation that people would eat whatever I made out of curiosity, but that they might not come back for more.  I chose this recipe, and it exceeded my expectations!  Bacon aside, these are just a great cookie!   I pulsed the bacon in the food processor so that no one would get a big overwhelming piece of meat in their cookie.  While allergies prevent me from eating them, everyone who has tried them has raved about them....and come back for more.  They say the bacon adds a nice savory, smoky element to the chocolate.  What started almost as a joke turned into a serious hit. Thanks for the recipe!

Only four stars because I really wanted to taste the bacon.  A very good rich and chocolaty cookie, but next time- next week in fact, I will halve the choc. chips and increase the bacon.  Will check back.

I made these today for my brother who is a huge bacon fan and they are so yummy! I used maple cured bacon but I used more like maybe 10 or 11 slices and I refrigerated the dough prior to scooping and baking. Everything else I did as written. Absolutely delicious and they look great too! I hope he likes them!

I was invited to a bacon themed party, and made these as a joke to be honest. Surprisingly they were very delicious. I followed the recipe, except for using chips instead of chocolate chunks and just regular bacon. I also put the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes after reading another review. I think next time in fact, I would add a couple more slices of bacon to bring the flavor out more. I ate so many I felt sick! lol

OMG!  So delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used an extra 2 slices of bacon.  I love the combo of bacon and chocolate, so I was pretty sure I would like these.  What I didn't know is that it would take every ounce of my willpower not to eat the whole entire batch.  This is an amazing recipe!  Thank you for sharing!!!!

I wanted to give 4 1/2 stars. I made the recipe exactly as written and I found that the chocolate overpowered the bacon. Now maybe the bacon should have been crispier but my husband couldn't taste the bacon at all until he actually bit into a piece. I will make these again for sure cause they are delicious and cook up perfectly. But I will only use 1cup of chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they tasted good, but looked like pancakes & didn't hold their form at all (i.e., a day later, as I held it in the middle, the other side drooped).  Couldn't really taste the bacon, but who doesn't love chocolate, chocolate chip cookies. I probably won't make these again, just because of how the shape/consistency turned out.  Tasted good, though.  Thanks anyway!

I added some cayenne pepper and spiced it up a bit. These have to be thee best cookies I have ever made and so easy to make and they made  bunches. I didn't have chocolate chips so I used white chocolate and just regular bacon. thought about adding some maple syrup but didn't. I give these a 10+. My new go to cookie has been made. Husband didn't care for them much. More for me. Very addicting. I ate them for breakfast.

I do love this recipe however no matter how I've made it you really can't taste the bacon.  I've found that including 1/3 cup of bacon grease to the cookies gives you a better flavor all around.  Also, perhaps I'm just overlooking it but how many cookies is this recipe supposed to make?

I used this recipe as the basis for my chocolate chocolate chip cookies with almonds.  Instead of bacon I added slithered almond , I used cake flour rather than all purpose flour to give the cookies the chewy texture that I desired, and lastly I did 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar.  Next time I will do the bacon, but some of the people that i was serving cookies to this time didn't eat pork so I  tweaked it a bit.  My cookies came out delicious!!!!

They were ok, would make a good chocolate cookie if you leave out the bacon. Everyone I had try it, wasnt really thrilled with it.

I wanted the cookies to have a more bacony flavor, so I substituted some of the butter for bacon grease and drippings instead.  Wow!  My friends and family love them!

These are incredible!  I didn't change a thing and neither should you.  This will be my go-to chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe as well.  My little ones already requested it with mint chocolate chips!  Thanks for sharing this true keeper of a recipe.

Perfectly sweet & savory. Even skeptics instantly succumb to the delicious blend of two of the most crave-inducing flavors. Huge hit!

This is a very yummy cookie.  I only knew there was bacon in there when I bit into a piece.  Maybe next time I will add more bacon or omit it all together.  Either way the cookie was great.

Curiousity got the best of me.. and two of my favorite things are bacon and chocolate.. so I thought what the heck!  I have to try this one.  (so many good reviews too!)  Suprised when I didnt like them.  Chocolate chip cookies are one of those things you just can mess with the origional though!

Absolutely yummy!!  I've made this recipe twice now.  The second time, I made sure to almost overcook the bacon so that it crumbled to the touch.  I also removed any undercooked/fatty portion of the bacon.  That made these cookies a definite 5!!  I think they taste the best when slightly warm so I popped them in the microwave for a few seconds if they were room temp.

I brought these to a party on the weekend and left a celebrity!  The only feedback I would say is people didn't know it was bacon per se, they just really enjoyed the sweet/salty taste.   Thank you for the recipe - it's a keeper!

These were actually really good!  Kids and adults loved them.  I would try and add more bacon next time as you couldn't really taste the bacon.

These are fantastic. I didn't give them a 5 star because I made some changes to the recipe that I think needed it... I split the sugar between brown and white. I used butter flavored crisco because I feel that always produces a more superior cookie!  I used a full tsp of baking soda, a 1/2 tsp of salt and used regular bacon. Everyone that tried these loved them! Now I can't wait to add a few slices of crumbled bacon to my already popular traditional chocolate chip cookie!  And the next time I make these, I may double the bacon--if I can stay out of it while it's cooking!
