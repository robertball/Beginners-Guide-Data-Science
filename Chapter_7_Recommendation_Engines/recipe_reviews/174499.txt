I love most things pumpkin, so I had to try this. I wasn't able to find the requested garlic marinara so substituted Ragu bottled marinara and added garlic.  I must say that it was actually better the second day as leftovers! Yeah! I like how the pumpkin enhances the flavor and it doesn't take so 'tomatoey' like some lasagnas do. Toss a salad and you're ready to go.

Great recipe! I had to substitute a few things. I used 10 noodles instead of 8 in order to fill up the 13x9 pan.  I didn't use the recommended sauce, so I addeda  TON of minced garlic to the sweet turkey sausauge as it was cooking.   I added extra basil, oregano, pepper and garlic to the cheese mixture.  I also used about 22 oz of spaghetti sauce instead of the 15.  I used Hunt's Zesty Spicy sauce because it has so much flavor. I used fat free ricotta and skim mozz.  I poured about 20 oz of the sauce into the turkey wine mixture.  However, once I covered the noodles, it just didn't seem like enough so I poured a little more sauce.  The next time, in order to make it not so dry, I would recommend increasing the wine and broth to 3/4 each, 1 cup of the pumpkin, and adding about 22-25 oz of spaghetti sauce to the cooked mixture.     Fabulous meal that I intend to make again very soon!

What surprising flavor!  I had to substitute a can of Hunt's Italian Seasoning tomato sauce for the marinara and regular Italian sweet sausage as I didn't have the called for ingredients on hand.  I only had 1/4 c white wine on hand, so I sub'd in some more chicken broth and added a little tomato paste (I like mine a little thicker).  I also only used 6 wheat lasagna noodles and prepared them as directed and baked in an 8 x 8-inch dish (it's only me and my husband and I hate lots of leftovers), cutting the noodles to fit the dish.  I ended up having a little sauce left over and topped the lasagna off with that, baked uncovered as directed but omitting the water.  At 40 minutes, I placed 4 slices of mozzarella cheese on top and baked for another 5 minutes.  I would've never thought to put pumpkin in a lasagna, but this is truely a keeper and will be making again!!!

This was a definite crowd pleaser!  Like the other reviewer suggested, I added more sauce... about another cup or so because I, too, enjoy a "saucier" lasagna. The leftovers were fantastic as well.

I had this for dinner last night and enjoyed it. I used soy sausage and soy cheese, fat free ricotta and whole wheat/flaxseed noodles. I wasn't able to find the sauce so I added sauted onion and garlic. When I tasted the sauce, I felt it needed something more so I added a  few dashes of red pepper flakes. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I'll bump up the seasonings more as after it sat in the fridge, the flavors mellowed. The pumpkin in this was really nice. It just made the dish taste richer, rather than like pumpkin. I also added chopped fresh spinach to get some more veggies in this!

This was good. However, it was pretty runny and didn't hold together very well. If I make it again, I will leave out the 1/3 c water.

Amazing taste. I added extra white wine, pumpkin and broth so it would be saucier. I added more Parmesan cheese and mozzarella because I love cheese. The flavors really blended well together and spicy sausage and pumpkin are an extra surprise. Had so many compliments and cant wait to make again. Thanks!!!!!!

This was a definite winner! Served it to company and they gobbled it up! Made a few changes/additions... extra sauce, extra ricotta and Parmesan, extra italian seasoning, fresh oregano, garlic, onion, and used spicy Italian sausage (cause that's all the commissary had that day). Didn't end up using the water or the foil. Let it stand for 10 min before cutting into it to make sure it had set up. Beautiful! Definitely a winning recipe that will find it's way back onto our table. :)
