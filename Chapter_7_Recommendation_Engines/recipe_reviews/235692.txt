I had a difficult time understanding the instructions. I'd recommend the following: 1. Use one, not two, fennel bulbs. Cut the core from the fennel (it's not as tender). Remove the green top from the bulb and reserve the feather-like leaves for a garnish. 2. Layer the potatoes and fennel vertically, not horizontally (like a lasagne).  If you do horizontal layers, the cream sauce won't reach all of the potatoes. Cut the potatoes like potato chips and stand them on their ends, not flat. 3. Consider this a potato dish with the fennel as a twist. The fennel, when baked, will have a mild flavor. My kids liked it, so that was a plus. But if you're looking for WOW! fennel flavor, you may want to try it grilled or raw.

The directions were a bit unclear but not to much. I broke my rule of never changing a recipe the first time but I did make a slight change on this one.  At the end I had saved out some fennel sticks and I sprinkled them raw on top, added some shredded smoked provolone and broiled for about 1 minute. The full flavor of the uncooked fennel combined with the provolone gave this the extra punch it needed. 
I will make it again.
