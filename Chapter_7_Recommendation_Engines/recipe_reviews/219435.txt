I made the sauce exactly but doubled it. .. with the only change being that I added 1 teaspoon onion powder and I used minced garlic. I used the sauce with chicken & broccoli calzones. Turned out delish. Thank you for sharing.

This did not make much sauce at all. I was trying to make an Alfredo sauce with pasta and I ended up more than doubling the heavy cream to cover my noodles. Also, if you follow the recipe exactly the consistency is that of queso, not a sauce. It seems like it would be well suited for serving with plain vegetables though.

Great flavor. Used half n half. Also great base recipe to add things to as suggested by others. Only had grated fresh parmesan but very little graininess.

This was so popular with my family! I liked it, too. Having read the  reviews I doubled the sauce. Mine did curdle but I had several things going for the meal& it was my fault. Still I got raves. I rarely make pasta dishes& even rarer still Alfredo sauce. Glad to have a healthier version. I had a can of evaporated milk open so I did use that instead of cream. Had this with voodoo pasta & steamed broccoli. Delicious! My daughter says' it's a definite keeper.'

Really met my expectations for a quick and easy Alfredo sauce. I made three servings without changing the recipe so if you really want it for four servings I'd use more cream and Parmesan. I used 3/4 cup of spinach instead of zucchini and it was very good!
