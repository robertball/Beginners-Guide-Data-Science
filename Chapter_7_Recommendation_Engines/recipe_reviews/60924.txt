I was skeptical at the huge amount of rosemary and thyme, but I always follow recipes to the T when I first try them. After eating what we could of this, my girlfriend and I felt like we had eaten a bowl of rosemary and parsley. It was barely palatable. I almost wonder if it's a misprint - perhaps 1/4-tsp. of each (instead of FOUR) would be better.

I always follow the recipe exactly the 1st time. Until now... I didn't have any thyme so I omitted that. I poured 2 tbs. oil in the glass dish, added potatoes, garlic and red bell pepper and cooked covered for 30 mins. Then I added the asparagus and cooked covered for 5 mins. & uncovered for 5 more. Delicious!

Wonderful! I followed other suggestions and cooked potatoes at 425 for 30 min covered, then 5 covered with asparagus and 5 more uncovered. The asparagus turned out perfectly. I also added raw onions to the potatoes, and everything turned out great! This will definitely be my go-to roasted potato recipe. Thanks!

Please make sure you like the taste of rosemary before trying this recipe as written.  I like the herb in small amounts but I found the rosemary overwhelming in this dish, and ended up throwing most of it away.  I'm still giving it 2 stars for the basic concept. I'm sure I would have liked this much better with different seasonings.

So simple and so delicious. I did have to extend the cooking time... the potatoes just wouldn't cook through. I ended up overcooking the asparagus a tad. Next time I will chop the potatoes into smaller pieces.

these are very tasty! make sure to not add the asparagus until the last 5-10 mins, otherwise it will definitely be overdone. i also sometimes add peppers, onions, or whatever veggies you like!

This was a very easy and flavorful recipe.  The only thing I changed was cutting the herbs in half, and using 1/4 tsp of salt total.  It would have been way too herby and salty as written.  Great compliment to chicken and green salad.

Great combination. Potatoes were good but the asparagus was over cooked.  10 - 15 minutes total cooking time for the asparagus is probably long enough.  Also would leave the  asparagus spears whole next time.

I followed the suggestions from other reviewers. I added 1 red bell pepper (chopped) to the recipe. I tossed the potatoes, pepper, EVOO, herbs, salt and pepper together in a baking dish - cooked for 30 minutes covered; then added the asparagus - cooked covered for 5 min then uncovered for 5 minutes. Turned out beautifully! Great taste and received lots of compliments from my dinner guests. Easy recipe and will definitely be making it again and again!

I love herbs so I followed the recipe, even after I read the comments to scant on them. It was kinda like chewing on twigs by the end of the meal. It would have been just as flavorful with about half the amount I think. Also, by the time my taters were done my asparagus was over-cooked. May need to change cooking times to fix this...I'll try again though...definitely has potential!

READ REVIEWS FIRST!!  Ok this was delicious with changes.  Luckily I read the reviews first so I reduced rosemary and thyme to 1 tsp each -which was PLENTY.  I also cooked potatoes for 30 min. alone and then added the asparagus for 10 min ONLY and it came out perfect (any more cooking would have overcooked it) - so total cooking time was about 40 min. I also put garlic cloves through garlic press rather than slicing. With these changes it was DELICIOUS!

This was delicious -- I liked the spices just as the recipe called for.  The potatoes and asparagus were overcooked and too soft.  Next time I'll adjust the cooking times, but I'll definitely make this again!

We loved this!  Made it two nights in a row it was that go.  Just a few little additions that put this recipe over the top.  During the last ten minutes when of cooking when you add the asparagus and olive oil, I also added some sliced almonds and some shredded parmesan cheese.  Fantastic!

This was fantastic.   I followed the directions,  but cut the rosemary and thyme in half,  and roasted the potatoes for half an hour,  uncovered so they would be a little brown and crunchy,  and then added the asparagus and cooked an additional 10 mins,  uncovered.

These were not oven roasted, they were oven steamed.  Still not bad, so I can only imagine how good this would have been had it never been covered.

OMG .... this is delicious.  Be sure to add the asparagus at the end so it doesn't overcook.  I cut mine in 4ths.  Upon cooling (waiting for my husband to end his business call), I drizzled some Balsamic Vinegar on top. (This advanced the rating to a 15. Tee Hee.)  Next time I made add a little while cooking.  Also, next time I will add some diced red onions.  I will be making this soon.  :)

This was soooo good, and my husband raved over it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh thyme. This is one of the few potato recipes I've made that actually uses enough salt. Next time, I'll make this with fresh green beans, since they're a lot easier to find this time of year, and I love roasted green beans.

The rosemary in this dish is overwhelming! I did not care for this. I'm so disappointed that this recipe got 4.5 stars and that I trusted the rating. If you have to make such major modifications to the seasoning to make it taste okay, please don't rate it 5 stars!

Excellent recipe I'll use again - but I'll definitely cut back to 2 tsp. rosemary and thyme and 4 cloves of garlic, and only cook the asparagus for 10 to 12 minutes total since mine was overcooked.  It's a great recipe since you can put it in the oven and basically forget about it when you're having company and your potatoes and veggies are all done together.

This dish turned out so great! I made it with regular baking potatoes because that's what I had, I added fresh rosemary instead of dried. Also, I baked it uncovered just because I prefer my roasted potatoes nice and crispy. Served with grilled salmon.

These potatoes and veggies were very tasty.  Saves on the dishes.  The changes I made after reading other reviews were:  Used only 1 teaspoon of rosemary and one teaspoon thyme.  I baked the potatoes, covered for 30 mins., added asparagus covered 5 mins and uncovered for the last 5 mins.  I also added a chopped onion with the potatoes for added flavor.  Nice change.

This is one of my favourite recipes to whip up. It's quick and easy to prepare, plus it never fails to impress anyone it's made for. 

As in other reviews, I also alter the cooking times. I cook the potatoes and onions (and sometimes other veggies I decide to toss in, such as peppers or mushrooms) covered for 30 minutes at 425 F. Take it out, add asparagus and give it a good stir. Cover and put back in for 5 minutes. Remove cover and cook 5 minutes more. Simply fantastic!

I really loved this dish. I used fresh rosemary and thyme which helped reduce the "twiggy" factor. I also used multi-colored fingerling potatoes which added a wonderful flavor. I had to cook the potatoes significantly longer than the recipe calls for, but I am at 5000 ft so that could have something to do with it. Overall it was a simple, healthy, and flavorful meal.

This was very good although I tweaked it a little, I always do. I parboiled the potatoes then baked them with the garlic and some sliced white onions for 10 minutes. I then added the asparagus and baked for another 10 minutes. I also cut way back on the herbs as they are both extremely strong. It was a very good side dish with grilled New York Steaks! Yum

This could be a 5 star recipe with some changes. Following the recipe exactly the asparagus was overcooked and the rosemary and thyme was overwhelming. Next time I will cut the spices in half, and play with the cooking time. I also think broiling the dish at the end would brown and crisp it up a bit. Has potential!

I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews first as I usually do. I totally agree that the amount of rosemary and thyme is overkill.  1/4 - 1/2 tsp at the most would be appropriate. Also, my asparagus was overcooked by the time the potatoes were done, so as others have mentioned, definitely cook potatoes 30 mins and THEN add the asparagus.  I too had to throw mine out.  Husband said it felt like we were eating a sprinkling of potatoes on spices. I will try this recipe again but with the changes.

I love roasted potatoes and I love asparagus.  I had no idea there was a recipe for cooking them together!  We really like this in our house but I am a potato purist and prefer only oil, salt, and pepper.  BTW, another easy method for cooking these is to toss the potatoes in the oil and seasonings, place cut side down in a big hot nonstick pan (lid on) over med/high.  After 15 minutes, toss the asparagus pieces in the residual oil and seasonings.  Lift the lid on the pan, turn the pieces of potato over and dump in the asparagus.  Slap the lid on and finish off for another 10 minutes.  I find this method to be easier than using the stove.

Use this recipe for potatoes frequently--never thought to add asparagus!  Kept asparagus spears whole; cooked potato pieces covered for 25 min. & increased oven temp. Added seasoned asparagus & roasted it uncovered for 15 min.-browned potatoes, too!  Delicious--may add red onion wedges next time in the final roast!

This was yummy, but I did cut down on the
rosemary and thyme like other reviewers advised and next time I think I may omit the rosemary all together. It was a little 2 overwhelming for me but the hubby gobbled it up and declared it 5 stars.

Love this recipe.  I added onions and went lighter on the garlic.  I will definately make this for company.  Simple and delicious, what more can you ask for.

Delicious, just as written!  once you do this you will find you can use just about any combination of spices that you have on hand for a great roasted potato side dish.

love roasting vegetables and I love easy clean up.  so I line my jelly roll pan with heavy duty foil and then spray it well with cooking spray. I made this last night and it was 5 stars, but I never cover my veggies when roasting. I just put the potatoes in for 15-20 minutes and then threw the asparagus & red pepper strips in for last 15 minutes. ( I also threw in fresh mushrooms cut in half) LOVE on a Week night.

Oven Roasted Red Potatoes & Asparagus Haiku: "This SHOULD be 5 stars. But with all those dried herbs  blech! Pick stems from ma toof." The ingredients, the directions, everything about this recipe is a rockstar, except for the 4 tsp of rosemary and the 4 tsp of thyme - they obliterated everything, and I even used half. I'll gladly make this recipe again, further reducing the dried herbs.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the rosemary down to about 1 tsp and completely eliminated the thyme (personal preference).  I added an onion and did sprinkle some red pepper flakes over the top.  Also, I cooked the potatoes for 30 minutes and then added the asparagus and cooked for another 15.  Very good!  I will make it again.

This tasted great. We even make this without the asparagus sometimes. We'll use this for numerous vegetable medleys or just potatoes alone. It's quite refreshing, and at times we enjoy a little heat added like cayenne pepper.

We love this recipe.  I usually have to cook it a little less, and adjust the spices down a little.  But it is one of my favorite winter side dishes!

Potatoes were fine, the asparagus was overcooked based upon recipe.  I would change the timing to better reflect proper cooking of both (potatoes a little longer/asparagus less)

LOVED these!  The only change I made was to use fresh instead of dried herbs.  I also followed the example of some other reviewers and left the potatoes in for 30 min and then added the asparagus for the last 10.  This was def. a hit with the roommate and me!  I added some cherry tomoatoes in with the asparagus for some color and they were amazing with the "dressing" as well!

Sensational! The aroma of the roasting potatoes is fantastic. I made this just as written. Next time, I will decrease the rosemary by one-quarter only because it sort of overwhelmed the thyme. Super yummy!

I left out the herbs because I am not a big fan of rosemary and I am out of thyme...  Just added lemon juice and butter (in place of oil) and it was absolutely delicious!

Like others, I modified the recipe.  I cut the spices to a generous sprinkling, upped the olive oil a little, and didn't add the asparagus until the last five minutes.  It could have used a little garlic seasoning in addition to the cloves, something to coat the potatoes a bit more.  Next time I might add some garlic salt in place of some of the kosher salt.  Turned out well with the modifications.  This was a good side dish for broiled grouper parmesan.  Will make this again, with the same modifications!

Very good.  My husband and I split the whole dish between us!  So that's three servings apiece.  I didn't measure the spices, but I'm pretty sure I used a bit less than called for of the rosemary and thyme.  Garlic, however, I never skimp on.  :)  Loved the combo of the asparagus and potatoes - and the potatoes were so tender.  Will definitely be making again.

a bit too much salt and rosemary for my tastes, other than that I thought it was quite good.  I put some sliced chicken breast in to turn it into a quick and easy meal.  It came out nicely.

I used fresh rosemary and thyme instead of dried, and I added zucchini at the same time as the asparagus. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Success! Quite delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

i followed the cooking time instructions for the potatoes but i added the asparagus at the end 10 minutes before the suggested time was up. the potatoes were still very crisp so i had to extend the time by an additional 15 minutes. when the potatoes and asparagus were finally done the meal was excellent. i did not give it a 5 like i wanted too only for the cooking times and needing to adjust more time. i will make this again but of course ill have the potatoes cooking about 45 to 50 minutes and adding the asparagus 10 minutes before end time.

This was delicious  and not time-consuming to prepare. Although I need more salt than some recipes include, this probably has a little too much - maybe half as much would be better.

Thanks for the recipe.  I had this dish at a baby shower this past weekend and loved it so I had to find it.  This was the closest I found and it was wonderful!  I did not have red potatoes, only yukon gold, so I used them and it turned out just as great.  We had garlic on our shrimp that I served with this dish, so I left it out of this recipe and it was super fresh and still good without the garlic.  I only cooked the asparagus for about 7 minutes because I like mine still crunchy.  Perfect.

This was a little bland by it's self and called for more steps than it needed.  I added more seasoning and tweaked the cooking process and it ended up being a great dish.  This was a great starting point though so it's still a good dish.  Would be very good as written if you are pairing it with something very flavorful.

I never follow a recipe to a T. So I added a bit of cream cheese and I used Italian seasoning instead. I also added some red pepper flakes.  It was good and a great side dish to steak.

Pretty good, but I decreased the thyme and rosemary- try 1/2 the amount next time.  Also added onion powder and a flavored oil.  Roast longer and give asparagus at least 15 minutes

Absolutely delicious..with modifications. I used only 1/4 tsp each of rosemary and thyme.  It gave it a nice flavor but was mild.   1 tsp may be good but I wouldn't use more than that. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and they were perfect.

I just sprinkled on herbs instead of putting as much as called for and minced about 4 to 5 garlic cloves (which was plenty).  I followed another reviewers advice about 30 minutes for potatoes in the oven followed by 5 minutes covered asparagus and 5 minutes uncovered.  I didn't use as much salt as called for and it was still too salty for my tastes.  I would cut it down to maybe 1 tsp total or less.

Everyone liked these my first time cooking them, and by everyone I mean, me, my husband, 18 year old son and 13 year old son.  I did use less herbs than listed.  Made with a crusted pork tenderloin that also had rosemary in the breading so it was a good combo.

We made this last night.. OMG, so, so good. We made it exactly as written, and I thought the spices were right-on! We added a chopped green pepper to it. Will make this again, and again. Thanks for posting!

Very good, it went fast at our family gathering. Only 4 stars because I think lots of the asparagus flavor was lost in the small pieces and baking.

I made this recipe this evening for dinner. We love potatoes, so I filled a 9x13 inch  pan with the potatoes. I did not use any rosemary, but I did use 1/4 tsp of thyme. Other wise, I followed the recipe. I extended the bake time to 45 minutes covered. I added the asparagus and baked covered for 5 minutes, and then uncovered for another 5 minutes. The dish turned out deliciously! I will definitely use this recipe again. I served it with Maryland baked crab cakes, that I also found on this website.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is wonderful, as long as you cut the rosemary and thyme WAY down.  I used a quarter of the recipe amount, and they were still the defining flavor.  Next time, I'll probably use an 8th and see if it blends together a little bit better.  But even with the strong taste of rosemary, it was still delicious.  Potatoes were tender, asparagus was done to perfection.  Rave reviews from the family.

Followed the recommendation for 30 minutes covered, followed by only 5 covered/5 uncovered for the vegetables.  I used green beans instead of asparagus and they were perfect.  Agree with the recommendations to use less spices.  I used about 3/4 of what the recipe called for and about 1/2 of the salt.

This was really, really good despite how much it annoyed me. Why did it annoy me? Because I don't own a metal pan big enough and I won't heat my glassware that hot, so I wound up preparing this recipe on a jellyroll pan that I covered with aluminum foil. I found it difficult to "toss" the veggies with the seasonings so I just mixed them with a spoon as best I could. My garlic blackened in places where it wasn't touching any veggies and I thought for sure it would be ruined, but it wasn't. The little black bits were actually quite tasty! I don't have kosher salt so I halved the salt quantity and that worked fine for us, you can always add more later. Thanks for the recipe, I'll use this one again! (After acquiring a 9x13 metal pan, at any rate.)

The taste was pretty good but this needs a lot of work. First of all 4 tsp of rosemary and thyme would be way too much. I used 1 tsp of each and that was plenty. The potatoes ended up being over cooked (they were over done at the 30 minutes when I went to add the asparagus and it's not like I cut them into small pieces or anything. I added the asparagus during the last 10 minutes of cooking and they were way over cooked too. If I try making this again then I'll probably leave out the asparagus and just make the potatoes and not use foil so that they'll be crisper.

*Update*
I just had the leftovers from the fridge and the flavors of the potatoes were soooo good. I normally like my potatoes hot, with the exception of potato salad, they tasted awesome cold! I will definitely try tweaking the cooking directions and still leave out the asparagus.

Please use measurable terms in your recipes!  I cooked the potatoes with raw onion for 30 minutes covered, then added asparagus for 5 covered and 5 uncovered.  The asparagus was perfect but the potatoes were still not fully cooked.  I may have cut my "chunks" too big?  Cooked for another 7 or so minutes and they were good to go, but the asparagus was a little overdone.  Tasty flavors, I cut the seasonings way down (garlic, too).

I like the idea of this recipe, but I think that cooking the asparagus for 20+ minutes would make them a mushy mess. Instead, I only added the asparagus for the last 8 minutes or so of cooking. I cut down on the garlic significantly. I only added enough olive oil and seasonings to coat the potatoes (and then enough olive oil to coat the asparagus). I liked this recipe, but I don't think using the cooking time as written would work. If you are interested, I created a custom version of this recipe with my changes.

Very delicious dish.  Grumpy wasn't crazy for it but I LOVED it.  I did cut the thyme and rosemary down.  I thought 4 tsp each would have been way too much (like many other's here).  I did use all the garlic though!  YUMMY!

My husband and I loved this this recipe. Easy to make and very yummy. I cut back on cooking time with the asparagus and only had it in the oven for about 10 minutes. Great side dish, will do again.

Always looking for healthy veggie dishes--this was great. I only added 2 1/2 tsp rosemary and 2 1/2 tsp thyme (plenty for us) and added the asparagus 5 minutes later, covered and cooked for 10, instead of 15 minutes.

Just tried it once...will try again.  I like the idea, mine just didn't turn out the way I expected.  Maybe less oil - the potatoes were somewhat mushy, not crispy.  **Just tried it again tonight - I do like this recipe, but still wish the potatoes were crispy.  Tonight though I did cut back on the oil and used just as much as the recipe calls for, also added some chopped onions and minced garlic - that added some great flavor.  We love asparagus so I was happy for find another recipe for it.

Yes the 4 teaspoons thyme and rosemary would've been way, way too much.  I used 1tsp of each and it turned out great.

I took all ingredients and simply "eyeballed" it.  I applied it so that all potatoes were nicely coated.  I served it with a warm tomatoe salad and sirloin steak.  Everyone loved it.  There wasn't a potato left in the pan.  I will make this again and again. It truly was fantastic.

This was OK.  I will give it another try, paying closer attention to the quantities.  Less oil, less salt, less herbs, less garlic.  I had cut down the recipe for two and used too much of all of the above.

Soft and flavourful.  Quite salty/oily, as you'd expect, you may wish to cut back on those per your tastes.  Spice is not too much at all, though it looks like a lot when you toss it on.  Used regular salt and a bit less garlic.  The garlic tastes good, too, after it's roasted.

This was O.K. but I doubt I will ever make again. I hated the color of the asparagus. The potatoes turned out fine though.

As is, this recipe is just O.K. With a few adjustments this could easily be a 5 star dish. I used 5 small-medium sized potatoes, the 2tbs of oil just wasn't enough. The potatoes came out very dry and we had to add more oil after cooking so we could eat it. Used 2tsp rosemary (which was just right) and just about 1tsp thyme, which was also just right (the recipe, I feel, definitely calls for too much thyme)I will try this again doubling the oil, keeping the spices as I did this time, adding a little extra garlic and some chopped onion.

Followed this recipe exactly, although it was tasty I felt that there was far too much rosemary and thyme. Will definitely make it again and adjust the amounts of dried herbs.

I followed all directions to a T, but next time I will put the asparagus on for only the last five minutes.  It was definitely overdone, but everything else was great.  The seasonings were delectable.  We loved it.

Good recipe. I just sprinkled all ingredients minus garlic due to some people in my family being afraid of it.  Seasoning was light and ingredient combo great.  My sister asked for the recipe.  This one is a keeper for me.

As I was making this it looked like there was too many seasonings but it tasted fantastic. I used regular salt and 1 tsp instead of 2. I used Idaho instead of red potatoes. Will definitely make again!

I love this great recipe. I cut 4 slices of thick bacon into bite sizes pieces and cooked until almost done. Then I added it with the potatoes and used 2 Tblsp. of the bacon grease and app. 1/4 cup of Chicken Broth. I Also used a spoon of Italian spice with the potatoes before cooking. Instead of baking, I cooked this dish along with the Asparagus  in an iron skillet on top of the stove until done. Total cooking time was less than 30 minutes.  Add the asparagus in the last 5 minutes of cooking. GREAT!.

I loved this as did my family. When I prepared I grilled some onions and the garlic first then just sprinkled the thyme and rosemary over the top(not 4tsp either) turned out really good. Will follow other reviews next time and cook the Asparagus covered for 5 and not for 5 though.

This recipe is pretty good. If you don't like potatoes to be too overdone, try cooking at 400 degrees instead of 425.

This is a fantastic recipe! Made this the other night with salmon and it was a nice complimentary side dish. I took into consideration from other reviews about the amount of thyme and rosemary for this recipe. Therefore, I only used 1/4 teaspoon of each and it was a PERFECT amount. This recipe box will be a staple in our household. Thank you!

I liked the recipe and it's awesome for my first try onroasted veggies. However due to the fact that i had to tweak the ingredients and modify the method/time/temp of cooking, i'll rate it slightly above average. Cut the rosemary, thyme, salt in half; cooked potatoes at 425 degC uncovered; added on the asparagus and roast at the same temp uncovered for 15 mins. When it's cooked, i split into half and put a dash of balsamic vinegar on one-half for a bit of tangy taste. Try it! :)

As I was measuring out the spice and salt I worried about the amounts, but went ahead and mixed them in.  Should have trusted my instinct on this one, too salty for me and too much rosemary as well.  I would make again with adjusted seasoning, and would probably add some mushrooms as well.

i'm just a beginner and have used the oven only for frozen pizzas and maybe some store-bought cookie dough, so i was afraid i'd mess this up, but it came out delicious.

Will definitely use this recipe again!  Halved the spices (will use full strength next time) and added a red bell pepper.  Cooked at 30 minutes covered, added the red bell pepper and asparagus then cooked 5 minutes covered, then had to cook an additional 20 minutes (covered and uncovered) total in order to finish and brown the potatoes.  Will probably try 45 minutes covered potatoes, add veggies, then cook 5 covered then 5 uncovered and see how that works.  All in all a B+

I added sliced red bell pepper when I added the asparagus, and did not have rosemary (didn't have it on hand). Otherwise, I made no changes, and this was delicious!

I did not have a lot of time to prepare this.  I microwaved 2 Idaho potatoes for 5 min. then chopped them into chunks.  Used the spices - cutting back on the rosemary.  I cooked the potatoes for 10 minutes in the oven and then added the asparagus for another 10 minutes.  Thanks submitter.

I rated it a 4 only because I think the spices were overkill. I didn't read any reviews before making it, but in hindsight I would have cut back on the rosemary and tyme (maybe 1/2 to 3/4?) like other reviewers. I am also in high altitude, so the potatoes took a little longer to cook, which I am slowly getting used to. I would recommend waiting until the potatoes are pretty much done before adding the asparagus. But I think next time I make this the outcome will be a 5!

This was very yummy, I also did not use quite as much on the herbs and salt, only about half that and it was more than enough. Also the asparagus does not need to cook quite that long. I had very thin asparagus and they were a little over cooked. I will definately make this again!

I've fixed these potatoes so many times!  I especially like to make them when we have company over.  I usually leave the asparagus out, but it's good with them, too.  I don't even measure out how much olive oil, rosemary, thyme, garlic, or pepper I use.  I just eyeball it.  The only issue is that sometimes the potatoes stick to the pan, so I make sure I check them and scrape them off if they do.

This was very delicious.  I'm not a huge rosemary fan so I heeded others advice and used half the amount of both that and the thyme.  Used extra garlic because we like it. I cooked the potatoes for 25 minutes then added the asparagus for another 10-15 minutes before uncovering and cooking another 10 minutes. The asparagus took longer than I thought it would but it was a little tough to begin with.  I used another reviewers advice and put a little Parmesan cheese on at the end and it was great. We have a few red potatoes leftover since I bought a 3lb bag and we will be having the dish again minus the asparagus before the week is over. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic!!  My whole family raved even my kids.  I followed the recipe but used fresh rosemary and thyme, about a TBSP. and a half of each.  YUM!  This is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe. I doubled the potatoes but reduced the rosemary and thyme. I marinate the potato mixture in a bag for about an hour before putting in the oven. Make sure the potatoes are pretty much completely done before you add the asparagus.

I cut the salt and spices in half, and only added the asparagus the last 10 minutes.  It came out delicious - even my picky teenagers loved it!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the seasoning. I have a Italian Herb seasoning that I used in place of the rosemary and thyme. I didn't feel like going out to buy seasonings I never use. I ate 3 helpings, while my boyfriend demanded I leave him leftovers:)This paired wonderfully with grilled tri-tip.

I did not like asparagus until I tried this dish... I made the full amount of servings and it wasn't enough for the two of us, we kept wanting more!  I used coarse sea salt, fresh rosemary, and dried thyme and when I took the foil off for the last 10 minutes, I sprinkled the top with shredded parmesan.  Marvelous!

I made this for my husband and my Nazi-baking neighbor.  She loved it and asked for the recipe.  I agree w/ others about cooking the potatoes longer before adding the asparagus.  For the rest, we all season to personal taste...

After my own modifications, this has earned 5 stars! I personally thought it needed a bit more color and flavor so I added 1 small onion chopped and 1 red bell pepper cut into chunks. I also thought after reading the recipe that the spices it was asking for was WAY too much, so I halved all the spices. Even my husband liked it, and he doesn't like onions or red bell peppers... he went in for 2nds!! Thank you for sharing your recipe :-).

Awesome recipe!  I had adjust since I had a prime rib in the oven, so I cooked at 325 for 90 minutes and not mushy at all.  Asparagus went in for last 10 minutes only.

This was OK. Not bad, but not great. I guess I just don't care for roasted vegetables.... but I needed something light to go with the Balsamic Chicken and Fresh Mozzarella dish (by TVMOVIEGIRL) that I made for my bf and I tonight. I scaled this to 3 servings for the two of us. Per other's reviews, here's what I did: a) only used half the amount of herbs (dried) called for, b) roasted the potatoes, covered, for 30 minutes at 425 degrees, c) added asparagus (covered) and roasted 5 minutes and d) uncovered dish and roasted all veggies for another 5 minutes. Turned out PERFECT!!! Just not crazy about the taste (again, I think I am not a roasted veggie gal). Good recipe, but not for me. I definitely think anyone who likes veggies prepared this way would enjoy this one. Thanks anyways!

This is delicious and a nice change from the usual dinner sides. Like others I halved the herb quantities. I suggest mincing the garlic & using fresh herbs instead of dried. Overall, very tasty...thank you!

I followed the recipe and everyone loved it.  I thought it made too much.  But there were no leftovers.  I started to notice that the asparagus would disappear faster.  So I double the asparagus.  Otherwise, it is great.  The flavor of all the seasonings is great.  But I can see how the texture could throw you off.  Perhaps, substitute with powdered seasonings.

The recipe is easy to fix and the potatoes with asparagus is a nice combination.  However, I think there is far too much Rosemary and Thyme.  I would reduce to about 1tsp each in the future.

It's a pretty dish but, I didn't exactly love it.  I cooked the asparagus as long as the recipe indicated and that was just way too long. 10 minutes is plenty of time for the asparagus.  Thank you for the recipe!

My boyfriend and I made this recipe a part of our date night this week.  It was wonderful.  I read some of the reviews that mentioned it had too much rosemary and thyme, but I like both herbs very much and had no problem at all with it.  I left the asparagus whole, b/c I forgot I was supposed to cut them up, but it was fantastic.  The potatoes were nice and crispy and the asparagus was wonderfully tender.  Thank you for sharing.

I love roasted veggies and this was a great recipe for asparagus!  I did take some of the previous reviewers' advice about cooking the potatoes longer and using less spices.  I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and diced red onions.

Like many others have stated this recipe has lots of potential. However, as the recipe is written it did not get many raves in my house. I actually cut the spices in half and added the asparagus earlier as my family likes the asparagus really tender. Thought the spices were still a bit too strong when done. Next time I try this dish I will sprinkle the spices over the dish lightly and add some butter for additional flavor.

Super!!!  I was looking for a recipe to use up my mismatched potatoes in my pantry and this fit the bill.  This was excellent and the sliced garlic roasted in the pan and added a great flavor.  I followed the cooking time and directions because I like my asparagus a soft.  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was great but way too salty.  Next time I make it, I'll use less.

I was missing the rosemary and the thme (which I didnt realize until I started making this) so I improvised with season salt, more garlic, the little thyme I did have on hand and various seasonings. It was really good especially with the fresh asparagus.

Far too much rosemary in this recipe;  I would make this again halving the rosemary.  I did add the red pepper which    is 
a nice addition.

What a tasty dish! I doubled up on the Garlic, used fresh rosemary and thyme, and this is one of the best potato dishes I have ever had! We have a family of 9, and they gobbled it up!

Since my family does not like asparagus, I substituted with fresh green beans and red onion slices, along with chives and parsley.  I allowed it to bake longer, an additional 30 minutes.  The dish looked very eye appealing, but I was disappointed in the taste.  It was a little bland.  We added salt and pepper to our serving to spice it up.  This helped, but I doubt if I will be making this dish again.

I used a blend of whole baby potatoes.  The colors were beautiful, and the dish was tasty!  But we did learn that the potatoes need to be cut to absorb the intended flavor.  I am definitely making this again!

I recommend not re-covering the pan once you add the asparagus, unless you like it mushy.  That is my only complaint. Otherwise it is a nice side dish.

I always make sure to read the reviews before I make a dish because who doesn't like tweaks? I took everyone else's advice and reduced the amount of thyme and rosemary, and I left it uncovered to get that delicious crisp! My husband thought I ordered out! It was so good, and it was done really fast!! I'm definitely keeping this dish in my repertoire!

This would most likely be pretty good, except the recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH rosemary and thyme.  Seriously, i had to throw the food away.  I would say 1-2 tsp of each, NOT 4.

Too heavy on the spices...I thought there was enough to cover 3 lbs of potatoes!  I may make again, but will half most of the spices.  I may also add an onion to the roasting mix.

Followed the recipe, but cut down on the herbs. The rosemary still overpowered the dish. Sadly not a fan, threw most of it away. What a waste.

Like others suggested: potatoes need more time. Also shift them around every 10-15 minutes so they don't fuse the the foil/pan. Asparagus needs less time. do the 5 min covered, then 5 min uncovered. Cover them again with foil when you take them out so they can steam.
I ended up using 2 pans so I could leave the potatoes in longer if they needed (which they did). Potatoes were in for about 45 minutes total. Asparagus was in for 10 minutes, then about 5 more steaming under foil.

I Made these potatoes using peeled  Russets. I soaked them in cold water for about an hour then dry and quartered them. About 10 min. before they are done I flip them over (only using foil for them to sit on sprayed with pam). They turned out really crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Now I make these about once a week and my family  loves them.  They  go with almost anything. Thanks.

I enjoyed the flavour more than some reviewers.
I make it 2ce, and both times could not synchronize the two components -- one or the other was over cooked or under cooked.

Just too tricky for me -- I won't try again.

Nice recipe but cut the herbs in half and cook the potatoes longer or cut them smaller.  Recipe says to cut potato into chunks but by the looks of the picture, they are the same size as the 1 in. asparagus.  Herbs as recipe asks is a bit overwhelming but could be that we used fresh rosemary so maybe that is why we would cut the measurement in half.  Overall though, a great side dish.

Only used 3 cloves of garlic but would have liked more, not sure if 8 cloves would have made it too garlicky. Only used a little more than a teaspoon of oregano, thyme, and parsley each because that is all I had at the time, so if you like other spices that you prefer you can use those too but probably no more than 4 teaspoons total or like others have said, it does get too herby. Also only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, otherwise it might have been too salty. Furthermore, I followed other reviews that said to cook the potatoes alone 30 minutes, then another 5 covered after adding the asparagus, then 5 uncovered with the higher temperature.

This is a favorite with my family.  The garlic and herbs make this dish smell as fantastic as it tastes!  I have even substituted zucchini for the asparagus (when I couldn't find it) and the result was just as yummy!

I did fallow the advise of others cooking the potatoes at 425 for 30 min covered. Adding the  asparagus covered for 5 & uncovered for the last 5.  Also I halved the spices... So good, easy and quick.

Very good except WAY TOO MUCH Rosemary and Thyme.  I added some chopped onion and also baby carrots too which were good and added flavor and color.

The amount of seasoning per the recipe was over powering. Only thing I could taste was the rosemary and thyme. I will try the recipe again at some point but will cut the spices in half and see if it will be better.

This is a wonderful side dish! I made it just as the recipe is written. I did overcook the asparagus a bit, but not one person complained. With the herbs and garlic, it was the perfect accompaniment to the grilled salmon I served.

I loved this recipe!  It was so simple and quick to make!  I actually made it without the potatoes this time, but I added chopped peppers instead (as recommended in the description).  Overall, it took about 30 minutes for the asparagus and peppers to be tender enough for our liking--and the garlic and spices made this dish especially tasty!  I will be making this again, but I'll try adding the potatoes next time.

I used fresh rosemary and thyme.  Recipes taste so much better when you use fresh ingredients and they're almost always available in grocery stores.   Keeping to the 4 tsp. of fresh rosemary and thyme worked perfectly with the recipe, because you have to use twice as much fresh seasonings as dried ones.  15 minutes for the asparagus (and another 5-10 minutes after that) is wwaaaaayyyy too long.  Next time I will just add the asparagus for the last 10 minutes.  All that being said, it was a very nice side dish to the steaks I served.

This will become a staple, nice combination of flavors for potatoes and vegetable that are frequent choices for us anyway. The garlic and rosemary add a great touch.

Wow! This was great! I used 1 lb of potatoes, 1/2 lb of asparagus. I didn't have the garlic cloves, but I used plenty of garlic pepper. Also used Italian seasoning and salt, along with the olive oil! Great recipe!!

Loved this recipe! Only had a few asparagus spears left and needed to use them up quickly -- this certainly fit the bill as we halved the recipe. We also reduced the rosemary and garlic to 1 tsp each and omitted the thyme and salt (personal preference!)

Delicous flavors!  I decided to try it using fresh rosemary and thyme. Usually I've heard the substitution ratio for fresh to dry is 3:1. I was also making just a half recipe so I used approx. 4 tsp each of the fresh herbs with 3/4 lbs red potatoes. It was amazing and still allowed the potatoes and asparagus to be the stars of the dish without an overwhelming herb flavor. The lemon undertones of the rosemary and asparagus worked incredibly well with Marcella Hazan's Roast Chicken with Two Lemons recipe.  I will definitely keep this paring clipped together in my recipe binder!

I would cut the rosemary and thyme in half. This was very good. I will definitely make it again.

Good recipe.  I would suggest cutting the rosemary, thyme, and salt in half at the very least.  It was obvious while doing this recipe that the rosemary and thyme was way too much.  So I cut that from the get go.  I followed the recipe with the salt and for me it was fine, as I tend to like some salty dishes.  However, it would be too salty for most people. 

Also depending on how one likes their potatoes, the initial cooking time of the potatoes could be lenghtened.  This recipe will have the potatoes, somewhat firm.

This was a very good recipe. It smelled sensational. I didn't have rosemary so I added a few extra spices to it and added parmesan cheese the last 5 minutes of baking time. This is a keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

Not bad, but nothing special.  Only added 1 Tsp. thyme and rosemary as suggested by others and it was plently.  I guess I'm not a big lover of roasted potatoes.  Also, not having a second oven makes planing difficult when it's needed to cook the main dish.  The potatoes and asparagus should be served immediately.

I've made these very tasty potatoes twice now, the first as to recipe,except using fresh herbs...this time didn't have thyme or rosemary so I used sage and oregano, both excellent. Also I add the asparagus the last 4 mins of cooking at 425.

I took other users' advice and reduced the amount of the rosemary and thyme - I think leaving it at the original amount would have been overkill. Otherwise, it is a great tasty recipe!

I made this last night to go with my steak. I love potatoes and asparagus and this made a great combo. Since I halved the recipe I did use two tbs each of the thyme and rosemary, even that it smelled a little overpowering at first it turned out just perfect once cooked.

Really good, but way too much Thyme when prepared according to the recipe the first time. If you cut back the Thyme it is much better! A great side dish made by my husband to go with Filet Minon on our anniversary...I love this web site! So many great recipes:)

This was pretty good. I have made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. My asparagus turned out mushy and there was way way way too much seasoning. The second time around, I reduced both the thyme and rosemary to one teaspoon each (as other reviews suggested) and added the asparagus during the last 10 minutes of cooking. It was much better and I will be making it this way again and again!

I really thought I would like this a lot more than than I did.  I don't think the taste of the asparagus came through enough for my tastes and I love asparagus.  I also thought there was too much olive oil and I did cut it back a little.

I used this recipies least night and my guests LOVED It.  I thought it was pretty good, the spices are a little overpowering (I took the suggestions and only used a tsp of each) I also took the advise to only cook the asparagus for 10 minutes.  I would suggerst this to anyone wanting to try somehting differnt.  It also looks pretty on the table.

Very good. I was out of thyme so I omitted that, and probably used more olive oil than needed.  Still, it was simple and fantastic.  Easy to throw together.  On a plus note for our Christmas dinner it was a festive red and green dish.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with my family.
I would use a touch less rosemary next time..seemed to overpower it a bit.
Aside from that..it was a fun addition to our dinner.

I used 4 lge sprigs of fresh thyme and 4 lge sprigs of fresh rosemary and removed them before serving. It scented the oil, and did not overpower the vegetables.

Great dish - I read the other reviews before making this and took some of the comments in to consideration - I used garlic powder (didn't have any fresh garlic on hand)also used parsley and basil instead of the rosemary - seasoned to our liking instead of measuring - cooked potatoes longer before adding asparagus as we like it crisp. Thanks for the great idea.

Safe recipe. I didn't have any thyme, so missed that addition. Only other change I made was to add some onion powder to coat the potatoes. I found the cooking time was less than stated, especially for the asparagus, which I threw in about 10 minutes from the end. I did find the garlic was overcooked, even burned in some cases. Perhaps it should be thrown in half way through, rather than cooking the whole time. Overall, pretty good recipe.

This was good but I didn't like that the potatoes kind of had an asparagus flavor to them.  Otherwise it was pretty good.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for a BBQ and everyone loved it.  Now anytime I go to a potluck this is requested.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this recipe.  The herbs were way too strong, I will definitely cut down on them next time.  I rinsed them off the next day and recooked and it was much better.

Man, this combination sounded so good. I agree with those who think it has potential. The asparagus was too done by the time to potatoes cooked. I used half the spices, and still a bit powerful. I also had to cook a bit longer than called for. Not perfect as recipe states, but one that could be really great with some playing around.

I loved it - but I did not use the full amounts thyme or oregano, I think they might have been a little over-powering as written.  This is going into my rotation, the kids loved the potatoes!

These were great last night, and even better for lunch today! I would use less oil next time though, and more garlic.

We loved this recipe.  All the flavors combined extremely well.  Still having a problem with the potatoes sticking (is it OK to use a glass Pyrex casserole dish??).

Great recipe!  I too added a little less rosemary (about half as much), but other than that this recipe is great!
