Made as written and these were excellent! I honestly expected them to be under cooked but they were perfect. The last step calls for mashing to desired consistency so I'm wondering if these were intended to be refried beans? I left them as is straight out of the IP and we enjoyed them very much.

I will definitely make this recipe again!  The seasoning was perfect as written.  My family loves everything bacon, so leaving it in was a no-brainer.  I just chopped it before the saut√© step, which gave us bacon with every bite.  I didn't have a chile pepper, so I added about 2 tablespoons of chopped green chiles from a can.  This turned out to be a great decision.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, I halved it for a 3QT pot but  wondering if I could have gotten the whole 1lb of pintos in the pot. I would be helpful if you put the size of the instant pot. There are 3,6,7 quarts out there.  You can also substitute ham for the bacon.
