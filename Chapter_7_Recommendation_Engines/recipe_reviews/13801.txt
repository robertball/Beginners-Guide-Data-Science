I found this recipe when I was looking to use up a jar of apple butter a friend gave me. It is a great cake! I did some modifications; brown sugar instead of white; walnuts instead of pecans; instant oats instead of bran/wheat germ. Perfect for potluck or church socials - no messy frosting.

Very moist, delicious cake.  Would make a good breakfast cake.  I made mine in a bundt pan and layered with 1/2 crumb mixture, 1/2 batter, crumb, batter.  Scrumptious!!  I also made the 'All Day Apple Butter' recipe from this site and used it in this recipe.

Wonderful, moist cake!  A real treat.  The batter was thicker than I expected and I thought I made a mistake, but the result was a big hit with everyone.

I made muffins out of this recipe. I used APPLE CIDER apple butter and I cut the sugar in the actual bread recipe in half. For muffins, there was a little too much topping (and imo, I think the topping needs butter, more like a streusel) but I'm not complaining. ;) I can't stop eating it. Quite moist, slightly chewy and VERY flavorful, one of the BEST quick breads I've had in a long time.

The recipe as written has 2x as much sugar as I'd want! So minus a few stars for that. I made it healthier with whole wheat flour, reduced the butter a little, plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and cut the sugar in HALF - it was still a little too sweet for my tastes. Otherwise it was moist and tasty, will make again - with less sugar.

This was a good coffee type cake - but for me it was not as good as the "Graham Struessal" cake found on this site.  I had given that cake FIVE stars and for some reason - I suppose because they are both coffee type cakes  - everyone in my family said "It is not as good as the cake you made last week".  I will probably just stick to that one - although this was tasty.  So..because of that I need to give this FOUR!

I only made this to use up some applebutter but this recipe is a keeper.  It is worth buying the apple butter just to make the cake. Delish!

We love this cake! Soft, moist, tender and slightly dense with a perfectly spiced and crunchy topping/filling. I used toasted wheat germ and the "All Day Apple Butter" from this site and could not be happier with the outcome. This is perfect as written and there is no need to change a thing. Although not needed, I added a drizzle of caramel and it is wonderful with or without. Very happy that I found this recipe. It will be enjoyed often. Thanks for sharing!

This was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. I was a little hesitant about not adding any frosting but it really came out quite good. The chopped nuts really added a nice flavor, and the spices in the topping were great. I made this for my grandpa's 81st birthday since his favorite cake is spice cake, and he loved it.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving desert.  My family really liked it, but many commented that it was like a coffee cake.  I think next time I'll serve it for brunch.  Note:  Eat this cake quickly.  Leftovers don't stay moist as long as othe ckaes might.

This is a keeper!  I used bran flakes for the cereal and chopped almonds instead of pecans (what I had in the house). This is perfect to make for office gatherings, too.

Outstanding! I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved how moist it was. No one touched the other desserts once someone had a bite and said how good it was. I also added a light glaze on top to dress it up a bit and I used a bundt pan. Enjoy!

This is such a good recipe! I made this a while back for a senior citizen center, and everyone raved about it. My husband absolutely loves this, too. It's a really good way to use up apple butter, too. I substitute different things like oat bran for the wheat bran, or walnuts for the pecans if I need to. It still turns out really good. Thanks for sharing!

This cake is wonderful, albeit a little dry.  Perhaps reduce the bran cereal by a 1/4 cup, and maybe increase the sour cream by 1/4 cup.  That is the only reason I am giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.  The flavor is wonderful.  It is a very comforting cake.  On my mom's last birthday she was alive, she requested a spice cake and this is the one I made.  She loved it. Very fond memories with her and this cake!

this cake was absolutely delicious.  I did swap out the bran cereal for oatmeal---because i didn't have any bran cereal.  i also added a diced apple to the batter and layered thinly sliced apples on top, beneath the brown sugar layer.  it was very moist and flavorful.  it was best when warm with caramel sauce and ice cream.

Good flavor. But don't bake it 40 min in a 9x13! Probably more like  30 mins and if using a dark pan, set oven to 325.

This turned out amazing.  I had some apple butter I wanted to use up and I actually wound up buying more apple butter because I kept having people ask me to make it for them.  Its pretty quick and easy.  I also experimented with it a little and added caramel pieces as I baked it to give it an added flavor (and use up some other ingredients I had laying around).

I love this recipe, especially because my picky eater Husband loves it. I did make some adjustments based on what I had on hand. I used a 6oz carton of light vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and I used old fashioned oats in place of the wheat germ. The cake came out delicious and beautiful.

This turned out absolutely amazing!  All who tasted it said they could not have just one piece!  My husband didn't even know that apple was in it.  Which means I can now substitute applesauce for butter in any recipe and he won't know it.  I couldn't get the layers right, but don't worry, it doesn't make a difference.

Wow, I was NOT expecting this cake to be this good!! I just wanted to use up my apple butter, but now I feel like I should buy some more just to make this cake again!! It is so moist, and the brown sugar in the middle makes it so very flavourful with the cinnamon...WOW...really perfect texture and taste! Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

Being from the Midwest, I love apple butter but I'm the only one in my house that likes it.  I didn't want the jar to go to waste so I thought I'd give this a try.  I bake a lot and my husband said this was crazy good.  They only thing I did different was add about 2 cups chopped apples right into the batter.  It took almost 15 minutes longer to bake than suggested.  Not sure if that was due to the added fresh apples which do add moistured.  But this was a do over for sure.

Super delicious, very moist, and definitely cake-y (that's a good thing) but not overbearingly sweet. I love it!

Fantastic "coffee style" cake!  I added a chopped apple that I tossed with cinnamon and a little nutmeg and put it in the middle layer of the cake...it was fantastic!  (Turned out great even with fat free sour cream!)

It was really good. I stuck to the recipe but it wasn't enough to fit in 13x9 pan. Put it in abt a 9x9 instead and it barely spreaded out completely in that pan. But it taste good.

This recipe is perfect as written, I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely the best recipe I have used on this site. I made it as cupcakes and used the topping on the top only, I baked them for 25 minutes and they were perfection. I will definately use these as a brunch recipe! Thank you so much!

This cake was soooo good.  I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ, and put slices of a honeycrisp apple on top before i baked it.  The cake turned out very soft and stayed that way for a few days after (until it was gone).  Next time I'll add apple chunks into my batter.  Great recipe!!

I was looking for a good fall dessert recipe to make for a group we have over each Thursday night.  I made it at night to test it out and so my family had it warm.  I didn't like it warm as much as I liked it the next day when it was cold.  It had a very moist texture.  BUT, I don't think I would consider this a cake really.  It is more like a coffee cake or dense like banana bread.

This recipe was pretty good. The spices were a bit over whelming. If the spices were cut in half I believe this recipe would be even better.

I enjoyed this cake a lot.  Very easy and quick to make.  I didn't need a 13X9 cake, so I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a smaller square pan. Like others, I didn't have any bran cereal or wheat germ so I subbed in rolled oats with no discernible difference.  I also cut back on the sugar a bit.  A flavorful, moist cake I'll make again and again.

So comforting. I added chopped apples, but other than that, kept everything the same. I think that next time, I'd like to try switching out the sour cream for some strawberry flavored yogurt, just to save on calories, and also, although this cake is super good, I can taste the sour cream, and I'd rather taste yogurt. This is a keeper, though. My kids loved it.

Wow!!  This recipe is what made me become a member!!  #1) This site has never done me wrong. #2) This cake was amazing!! It was gone in a day (twind 10yr olds & my husband) - with begging for more!  Although I did not have anymore Apple Butter, I did have a jar of Pumpkin Butter that I used and it was just as yummy !! Thankyou

I was disappointed with this. i did not like the topping at all, in my opinion walnuts or no nuts would've been better than pecans and it had too much nutmeg . I had a lot of topping leftover as well and put it on quite thick. The cake was nice and moist though.

Best use of apple butter!  I substituted pecans for walnuts, and whole bran cereal/ wheat germ for rolled oats per another review.  It turned out wonderful.

This cake got rave reviews by my seven year old granddaughter, who is someone who is not always easy to please!  Wonderfully moist and full of flavor. Baked in 9x13 pan for 30 minutes. I served individual portions with caramel sauce and whole pecans, omitting the pecans from the topping. There was even more flavor the next day, making it a great do ahead recipe. Best served warm.  So happy to be adding this recipe to my collection.

As with some of the other reviewers, I made this recipe to use up some apple butter a friend had made. He said he had put too much clove in the butter, so I thought it would be better to use as an ingredient.  This cake is delicious! I used the bran cereal that is shredded. I love any recipe with brown sugar, and pecans are the family's favorite nut.  While this cake was baking, my grandson asked if I was making coffee cake, and I think this is actually more of a breakfast or brunch cake, but I'm certainly not going to "split hairs" on the issue. This recipe is a definite recommend! Thanks, Shirley!

I made this cake for our annual family pumpkin carving/dinner.  I used my  bundt pan and also added 1 1/2 c. chopped apples as other reviews suggested.  I also put a sugar glaze on the cake.  Very good.

Definitely a keeper. I made this for dessert tonight. The weather was cold and wet and it was perfect. I didn't use the topping - we used a little Cool Whip  - and I substituted about 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for white. I served the cake warm. Another idea is to top with chunky, warm applesauce or a broiled icing (coconut, nuts, brown sugar).

This cake had great flavor and would be a nice treat for brunch or dessert.  The only change I made was to add small chunks of apples to the batter before baking.  I found the topping to be a little dry so next time I may add something to moisten it.

Very good.  The cook time was a little long for my oven so use a toothpick to remove as soon as it is cooked through to retain as much moisture as possible.  I will definitely make this again next fall to use up my extra apple butter.

This is honestly the best cake I have ever made. Every time I make it, people go crazy! I get 50lbs of apples every fall so make a load of apple butter and didn't know what to do it with. Well, until I found this cake!

I also cut up an Ambrosia apple into small pieces and add it to the batter which makes it even more moist. 

My absolutely favourite dessert recipe!

I made this with everything the same except I used wheat bran, because I couldn't find wheat germ in the store. I cooked it for about 35 minutes and it turned out well. Still cakey, but also moist. I had a hard time layering and it seemed like it was even when I did it, but it came out that the middle topping  layer  was pretty low in the cake. It didn't really make a difference to me, but it was difficult to layer without feeling like I was moving all the topping  layer around. I also only used about 3/4 of the topping because it felt like a lot, but probably would have been fine to have it a little more "crumby" in the middle. Ate this warm with vanilla ice cream and oh my goodness...

This is a moist great cake to have with a good cup of coffee or tea. I will definitely make it again.  I did change a few things only because of what I had on hand.  I used brown sugar instead of white and I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ.

Yummy!

I made this twice, first with apple butter then with some pumpkin butter I wanted to use up. I was looking for a not-too-sweet cake I could have with a cup of tea or coffee so I halved the topping and that was plenty sweet for me. Very moist crumb - thanks for a delicious recipe!

Everyone enjoyed this and it is an easy recipe to tinker with if you would like to switch out some of the all purpose flour for whole wheat. Very moist. Others I served this to mentioned that they might like some apple chunks in it. I think I may try it again sometime, cutting the recipe in half and baking it in a springform pan.

I made it in a Bundt pan according to recipe but cut the sugar in half only in the batter, I layered the crumble then the mix then the crumbled then the mix. The crumble stuck to the pan but otherwise it turned out great it tasted awesome, my husband loved it I love it too, little sugary for me I did cut the sugar in the cake part in half. It is a very sweet cake, very aromatic, and yes I will be doing it again.

Just made this cake.  Exceptionally moist and tasty.  The best thing about this cake is every ingrediant is always on hand at our home.  The only thing I did different was add a little cinamon and Nutmeg to the cake batter.

So, I made this late tonight and as it was sitting on the counter cooling, my husband was already digging into it.  He actually told me to right this review right now that this is his favorite cake and that he usually likes the middle of the cake more, but the edge of this one is awesome.  So much for taking this one to work tomorrow.  I think I may end up single if I try.  I can't wait to try it myself.

This was a good cake but it tasted like most coffee cakes.  I put it in a smaller pan and cut down on the sugar in the cake.

Great staple for a quick cake!! I only had pumpkin butter (my preference) and added 1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice to make it more of a spice cake. SO good. I'll be making the apple version as well. going in the permanent recipe stash. thanks!

A scrumptious little coffee cake, if a bit on the sweet side. I made a small cake subbing pumpkin puree for half the butter and using equal parts all-purpose and whole wheat flour, as well as exchanging the sour cream for plain nonfat yogurt. Very nice  moist texture and mild spice flavor warm from the oven as well as the morning after (there was a hint of "wheaty" taste I thought at first that was absent after sitting overnight). The next time I make this I will reduce the sugars both in the batter (half?) and in the topping (even less), which I thought was unnecessary/undesirable as an intermediate layer. I did omit the nuts.

This cake is really fantastic.  I needed a recipe calling for Apple Butter and this far surpassed my expectations.  I used Special K Cinnamon Pecan for the Bran cereal and subbed in 1 cup of canned pumpkin for the sour cream (my sister HATES sour cream and was convinced she'd be able to taste it).  Turned out GREAT!  I'll make this again over the holidays when family is in town!

This cake is exceptional.  The crumb is nice and the cake is moist.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce.  A lovely company dessert!

Very dry. The photo shows a caramel sauce, and that would have helped immensely. It was tasty but more like a bread than a cake

I agree with many others, that this is an exceptional cake.  It stays moist for days.  I gave half away to two neighbors, and both contacted me to say it was moist even on the third day.  The only change I made was to use flaxseed meal mixed with some old fashioned oats, because I have  used flaxseed meal in a muffin recipe, and it is yummy.  I will make this cake again.

The only change I made was to sub 1/4 c. white sugar plus 1/2 c. brown sugar for the 1 c. white sugar in the cake. Reduced the amount a bit but was still plenty sweet and spicy. Took it to small group and all the ladies asked for the recipe. Baked for 35 min. and it was perfectly done and moist. Topped it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream since it was for our group dinner. Otherwise, great without. Next time I'm going to add some raisins.

The cake got good reviews at coffee hour after church. The baking time was a little bit too long in my oven so the cake was not as moist as I had hoped.

I've made this several times. Always great. Save more batter than you think for the top half. I've also used the wheat germ twice and then Uncle Sam's cereal once. I would use either again. Great recipe... good with coffee.

Oh Boy, was this good!!   Easy to make too.  Next time I may add 2-3 chopped apples to the cake mixture.  And,  will use different baking pans based on the event.  Bundt,  or  2 loaf pans or even muffins!!!  I drizzled caramel sauce on top of cake before serving

Wonderfully moist and the sweet to spicy ratio was perfect. And instead of sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt.

I did not like it.Followed recipe exactly. The inside was moist But the topping never melted at all. It was crunchy like Brown sugar, not a good deal. Very dry. I had prepared for a party, had to chunk it and baked another. Very disappointed.

I made this as a breakfast bread layered in a bundt pan.  Only change I made was to use walnuts instead and sliced apples added to the layers.  Worthy of company!

Very nice cake. I made it the night before I was serving it and I found it a little dry the next day.  Next time I will make it the same day I am serving it.  I also added raisins and  it was an awesome addition.

This cake was delightfully easy and delicious!   ( but I did substitute plain Greek yogurt for sour cream because that was all that I had.)  The recipe is easy to cut in half for small family, or full recipe for company. The recipe is perfect the way it is.  It smells so good baking!
Nice for coffee cake and yummy with a side of warm fried apples and scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I made the cake with the apple butter recipe for Crock pot apple butter on this site.

Yes, it isn't good for you, yes it is full of calories but my God is it good!  I made it as directed and it came out perfect.  My wife who isn't big on coffee cakes, absolutely loved it.  Light, airy and full of favor.  What else could you ask for?

Very happy with the way this cake turned out.  I baked it in a bundt pan and substituted quick oats for the wheat germ .   Very moist cake and still tasted great 5 days after it was baked after keeping it in the refrigerator.  Great cake to bring to pot lucks.

This is a very good coffee cake type recipe.  I used walnuts, because we prefer them.  I found the spice ratios to be spot on. Like some other reviewers, I put apples into the cake, but wouldn't do that again.  It would have been just fine without them.

Even with a couple of heathier substitutions, it was absolutely fantastic. I used drastically less sugar, half whole wheat flour, and subbed a high protein yogurt for the sour cream. As a middle layer, I spread a thin layer of apple butter and sprinkled only a couple of tablespoons of sugar with the spices, no topping. Delish!

A little too sweet.  If I make it again I'll halve the brown sugar and maybe add just enough maple syrup to make it flow.  Maybe I'll just use maple syrup by itself.

Fantastic.   The only change I made was to add one apple  some raisins to the existing ingredients and use whole wheat flour. I cut back on the sugars by 1/4 cup. still had too much sugar for me. I will make it again  and add less sugar

I made two loaves and  I added raisins to one of them.  I cut the nutmeg in half and I used quick oats since I did not have bran cereal or wheat germ.  Delicious recipe.

I have made this several times now and this is a great recipe!! My family and in laws loved it!! I used a bunt pan and sprinkled half of the topping in the bottom of the pan then poured in half of the batter, added more of the sugar mixture then I added the remainder of the batter.   Excellent!!

Great cake! I needed to use up the apple butter I canned 10 months ago. What a great recipe. I adjusted it by using ground oats instead of wheat germ. I also used more pecans than it called for.

Delicious!  Next time I may remove it from the oven about 5 minutes sooner.

I had an unopened jar of pumpkin butter that had been in my pantry for way too long, so I decided to make this using the pumpkin butter rather than apple butter.  I made this as directed, but replaced the nutmeg with ginger out of personal preference.  I also used quick oats in place of the cereal or wheat germ.  This was excellent, nice and moist and not too sweet.  Next time I might increase the topping so I’ll have a little extra for the top of the cake – I thought it could have used a bit more.

I took this to a parenting class where I didn't even think anyone knew I'd brought it.  After snack time I was receiving compliments though.  This is a great fall recipe with its wonderful blend of spices.  It would be a nice brunch or breakfast addition.  I followed the recipe except I left out the nuts since I didn't have any on hand.

This is cake is very good, but I wasn't all that impressed with the brown sugar filling/topping.  I think it needs something more than nuts and brown sugar.  Perhaps some butter and oats added to the mix would make a better "crumble"?  Otherwise, very good flavor!  I got a lot of compliments on this after serving it at a party.

This was a wonderful recipe that left my whole family in smiles. Even my son, whom won't try anything new, gobbled this recipe down. I recommend this recipe! It is spectacular!

I made this as is with just a few minor changes and this was SOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!! I added a tsp of cloves, a tsp of nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of ginger to the dry mix and it was amazing. I also added an extra few tsp of apple butter and almonds since I had no walnuts, plus I like the taste of almonds better, will try hazelnuts next time. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I followed this recipe to a T - I liked it, but found that layering the bundt cake (my shape of choice)as recommended - batter, topping, batter, topping - left me with a crumbling, sugary layer - perhaps the flaw is not in the recipe, but in my oven - next time I am going to reverse the layering and add some bourbon - yum!

Really good and easy. For eating a day or two later, 30 seconds in the microwave does wonders!

This was an excellent holiday dish to take to a Thanksgiving dinner.  Extremely moist and with just the right amount of spices.
