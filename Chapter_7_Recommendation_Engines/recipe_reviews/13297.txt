I was searching for a great stew recipe and can stop looking!  I just loved this stew!  I was just licking my chops the entire meal.

I looked through the reviews first and also made a few changes to it.  I only added 1 can of tomato soup and substituted with a bit of water.  Instead of tapioca I added 2 medium potatoes.  I also added a touch of garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture.  I was a bit more liberal with the soy sauce and also added a touch of Worchestershire.  When it was ready (just over 10 hours) I wanted the broth a bit thicker so I took out 3/4 cup of the broth and added some cornstarch.  I then put the stew on high to get it bubbling and then I added the cornstarch mixture back in.  Next time I'll do that a bit earlier.  It was just lovely.  Seems like I made a lot of changes but to me, they were only minor.  YUM!!!!

I tried this for the first time today and it came out great.  I omitted the tapioca but added a couple of cubed potatoes.  My husband picked out the mushrooms but overall gave it two thumbs up. I served homemade biscuits with the stew for a very hearty meal.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Don't be afraid to use tapioca in this or any beef stew. The tapioca is a THICKENER - it doesn't have anything to do with the flavor.  This is a wonderful beef stew recipe and it makes plenty!  I would give it 10 stars if only the nice people at allrecipes would let me!  =)

This was surprisingly good.  10-12 hours is way too long.  I think 6-8 would be adequate.  I started mine on low for a few hours, cranked it up to high for about 2 hours and then back to low for 1 hour.  My meat was a little tough but flavor was good.  I'll make this again.

Unless you like stew that is on the sweet side, I wouldn't recommend this recipe.  I would suggest using canned whole or stewed tomatoes instead of canned tomato soup and leave out the tapioca...made it very sweet instead of tangy.  I also added potatoes and some bay leaves for extra flavor.  Very easy and simple to make.  Perfect recipe to freeze and reheat for a last-minute dinner.

Intially, I wasn't so sure but after a few bites, I really liked the taste.  Very unique and I'd be impressed if any bachelor made this for me. Different from all the other stews I've had before. My family also liked this and I'll be sure its on the dinner table again in the future! Thanks!!

I reviewed this a couple of years ago and have read some of the more recent entries.  I still keep coming back to this recipe over and over.  Everything I had tried up until then for a beef dish in the crock pot turned out to be the same.  The tomato soup really added something different.  I do still add the tapioca but wouldn't mind trying the barley as someone else mentioned.  I added some potatoes to the original recipe as well.  I've changed it a little over the years but not by much such as adding 2 cups of beef broth for example.  It was a great recipe to happen upon and can be changed to fit your own tastes etc.

Great recipe for a cold winter day.  I added potatoes and stewed tomatoes.  My kids rated this meal an 8 on the 1-10 scale.  I would recommend this recipe to my friends and family.

I thought this recipes was excellent.  I did, however, omit the tapioca...and I also added potatos and fresh garlic.  It was quite yummy, had a real different flavor!

Wonderful Recipe!!!!  I made it exactly as stated with one accidental change.....  I used Jello brand tapioca instead of real tapioca.....  IT TURNED out WONDERFUL.  I made it for halloween so everone could have some when they showed up.   I served it over egg noodles, and my parents, inlaws and kids all had several helpings.

This is a great stew;however, I know why it is called Bachelor's stew.  I figured out that the bachelor who made it didn't want to take time to peel some potato's to put in it. Add some potatos and you have a five star stew. Maybe the name could be changed to Irish Bachelor's Stew.

I have been making this recipe for years and realized I've never rated it and my family has enjoyed it so much.  I use potatoes instead of tapioca, leave out the mushrooms (not my choice) and probably add a little more soy sauce.  I'm not sure though since I've made it so many times I don't measure anymore.  Thank you for a great recipe and the only way I make stew.

This was just fair.  I thought the tomato soup overpowered with a preserved flavor.  I needed to add 2 1/2 cups of beef broth to eliminate the gelatinous texture.  Also agree with other reviewers, this needed potatoes or barley.  On the plus side, the beef was very tender.  Likely won't make this again.

always turns out perfect with such little effort.  cook it as long as you can, it gets even more delicious when the meat is verrry tender.

I made so many changes that I had to reduce to 4 stars.  I use potatoes instead of tapioca, terriyaki sauce instead of soy, one bigger can of ready-to-eat tomato soup instead of the condensed, add worcesterchire sauce and red wine, and skip the onions and mushrooms.  My family loves it.  Sometimes I serve in in mini bread bowls.

My family basically. Killed this ;-) Following basic instructions and ingredients to a T with the exception of not having beef chuck, I had Pork Stew meat to use and this recipe compliments using such ingredient. The only suggestion in using pork stew meat, is to cut out the salt out, as I have found out. But it was a fabulous...and so we thought. I can't say anything negative. Meat was nice and tender, the veggies were succulant, the over all flavor was comforting and soothing to the soul. This is a total keeper in my house. I nearly doubled the recipe but chose not to and it easily feed family with no leave overs. TY.

This was absolutly WONDERFUL!  Very easy to make and didn't have to worry about making dinner that night, since it sat in the crockpot all day!  I only used 1-1/2 cans of tomato soup (that was all I had on hand), and it still turned out great!  I left out the mushrooms (my fiance doesn't care for them) and added a couple cut up red potatoes.  I'm passing this one on to everyone I know!

I tried to elimate the over powering tomato taste by adding sausage (rookwurst), more beef stock powder, thickened it with cornflour and ate it with rice.  The kids loved it (especially the sausage!!!)

I am not sure what I missed- all the reviews said this was so good and I just thought it was... okay. Its just stew- I felt like there were a lot of extra ingredients for what turned out to just be a regular stew. Probably won't make again... thanks anyway.

This is a sure winner! I took it to work in my crockpot to share with everyone -- they all raved about the delicious taste. The only change I made was adding a can of italian style diced tomatoes for depth of flavor. Next time I will add a couple of cubed potatoes for more sustance. This one is a keeper for sure. Thanks Corwynn for sharing it with us all.

I was very impressed with how easy and tasty this recipe was. My Husband and I loved it and I will definatly be making this again. I changed a couple of things also...I added two medium potatoes instead of the tapioca and about a cup of frozen peas to the recipe. I also ommited one of the cans of tomatoe soup and instead added a cup of water. It turned out pretty much perfect for flavor and thickness. LOVED IT!!!

I WOULD RATHER HAVE STEW WITH A BROWN GRAVY BASE. TOO MUCH TOMATOE FOR ME.

My husband likes very lean beef, so we used a "mock tenderloin" cut up into cubes.  I did brown the meat the night before.  I only had one can of tomato soup...so I threw in a little extra water.  It turned out great!   I thought the gravy it made was delicious.  I used small pearl tapioca because it was cheaper but next time I will use the finer ground up kind...I think it would be more appetizing.   Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe.

This makes a nice, thick stew.  It was a little bit too tomato-soupy for me, so I think next time I will replace one can of the tomato soup with more beef broth.  Still it was delicious, and fairly easy to throw together.  (Be sure to make some potatoes, rice, or noodles to serve with it.)

Great tasting stew!  Very hearty.  I served it over lumpy mashed potatoes and it was a hit with my family.  Will make this recipe again.

It's quick, it's relatively inexpensive and I actually like the texture of the tapioca but something about this burns the back of my throat.  It is uncomfortable going down.  I think it's all the tomato soup and soy sauce maybe?  I was pretty bummed because otherwise all those flavors together should have been pretty tasty...  Makes a lot, was done in perfect timing after a long work day, just not that perfect bite.

Loved this easy stew. I left out the mushrooms entirely and threw in some baked potato chunks for the last half hour or so. Even my sister-in-law, who rarely eats red meat, loved this recipe enough to ask for it. My brother is very happy...

Excellent and easy.  I used regular stew meat and 1 can of whole mushrooms. Next time I will add a few potatoes but only because my husband missed haaving them. Great flavors.

We really liked this recipe!  It was easy and I like the fact that it can cook while I am at work.  I made at quadruple batch for a potluck at church and it was the only entree to be completely eaten with rave reviews from everyone!  I'm making it again for guests tomorrow.

Tired of all those brothy or cream of mushroom stews? Then you gotta try this recipe! I made it as is and it is wonderful!! Great change, easy to make and hearty taste. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of his and complimented me on it all night! Don't be scared of the tapioca (I admit- I was too) because it adds great flavor! Great recipe Corwynn!

Followed the recipe and opted for the longer ten hour low setting, it was perfect the meat was tender and not very thick sauce. Next time I would add more vegetables or potatoes.

The flavour is overpoweringly that of the tomato soup.  Not particularly bad, but too sweet for me, it felt like eating stew made from ketchup.  I prefer more savoury.

Delicious. I always add 3 or 4 Yukon Gold potatoes to this.

Have made many times. We love it! I add about 24 of the real small baby Red, Blue and White potatoes, cut in half. I don't use celery (bleh) and everything I add is no salt added, so instead of salt when mixing the meat I use a very small amount of celery salt. I use 1 can of Tomato soup, 1 can stewed tomatoes and a mostly drained can of diced tomatoes. That is the only changes I make except I steam the potatoes and baby carrots in microwave steamer for 3 mins. and then add as its easier for dad to eat them.

This is my go-to beef stew! The original recipe which I had found in an ancient slow-cooker cookbook called for kitchen bouquet instead of soy sauce and didn't specify what type of onion to use, but otherwise it's the same.

Anyone who is complaining about the stew being too sweet should pay attention to the type of tapioca they're using. Do *not* use instant tapioca pudding! Find "Quick cooking tapioca" which is sold in a box as a dry powder and can be found at nearly any grocery store (I buy mine from Kroger). This tapioca has a very neutral flavor and is used to thicken the broth rather than flavor.

Great flavor, but maybe a bit too thin - I think a little more tapioca would fix that though?

This recipe was not bad.  I would make it again but next time I will use diced tomatoes instead of the soup. It had too much of a canned taste, it is also incredibly thick.  The tapioca would be the perfect thickener then. I also used fresh mushrooms.

over-all very nice recipe.  I added diced potatoes to make a complete meal.  tapioca worked fine as a thickener....just be sure to cook the entire 10 to 12 hours.
