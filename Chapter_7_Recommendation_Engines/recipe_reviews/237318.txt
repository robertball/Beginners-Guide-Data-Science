Just made this recipe and the whole family loved it!  I put everything in a small crockpot including the bacon (left in whole strips) and cooked on low for 4-5 hours. I did not precook the bacon or any other ingredients.  I omitted the vegetable oil and olive oil. After the soup was finished cooking, I discarded the bacon and bay leaf.  I added spinach to individual bowls just prior to serving. Will definitely make this recipe again!

Delicious.  The black lentils really do make a difference.  I've made this twice now, once with green Puy French lentils and once with black beluga.  There is a textural difference between the two.  The black belugas have more a round shape than most other types and this seems to give it a pearl look and texture.  They do tend to hold their structure while they melt in your mouth.  Both were creamy and flavorful.  I made mine in a pressure cooker to save time.  The first time I augmented the broth to 6 cups just to make sure there was enough liquid and the end result was a bit more thin than in the picture but still creamy and delicious.  The second time I used 5 cups of broth, cooked 20 minutes in the pressure cooker and it was exactly as it should be:  a thick and creamy soup.  The cumin and spices are just perfect.  It freezes well too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is THE BEST lentil soup that I have ever made!!!! I omitted the bacon because I do not eat pork, and could not be happier with the results. My kids are raving about it, and my house smells divine tonight. I served with naan bread and  salad. I will be making this alll the time now.

I couldn't find any Beluga lentils at my local grocery store so I had to use regular green lentils I had on hand. They still turned out dynamite taste wise, and the texture wasn't all that bad (although I'm sure the Belugas would have made a difference). The heat level was a perfect, spicy enough just to leave a bit of a tingle but nothing too overpowering. The bacon added a smokyness that kept having me going back for more.

This was fantastic!  My only change was to chop and add one small tomato because it had to be used.  This will be a regular.

Chef John and his educational, inspirational videos, have given me so much pleasure to watch and reason to create delicious everything! I was given two pounds of crappie filets so while looking through stew, soup, and chowder recipes, I saw and watched his black lentil soup video. I wonder what Chef John would say about using this, his lentil soup recipe, as a base. Since he's not here to try my creation, I (as always) am relying on the opinion of my family. I love my version and so do they. I had small whole green lentils and they stood up to simmering for 45 minutes. Also, I did add half of a chopped jalapeño pepper and 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper to the onion, carrot, and celery. Another ingredient that appealed to me from a Bermuda fish chowder, 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, I stirred into the chicken broth. The small crappie filets (after sprinkling them with Old Bay seasoning) were added during the final 10 minutes of simmering. What do you think Chef?

Excellent! I do not eat pork, so added some smoked paprika in oil to saute onions, carrots, and celery. Also used 'not chicken' broth instead of chicken broth (sorry Chef John!). Very, very good, and will definitely make again!

This soup tasted really good. I added diced jalapeños in with the veggies. I sautéed everything in an instant pot and used the slow cooker function. Everything was done after 4 hours. Thanks Chef John:)

I'd happen to have bought some black lentils, didn't know how special they were! This recipe made a delish dish, thank you Chef John!  
It's so good and low in fat, you can eat it cold!

Black lentils are much better, hold together and don't get all mushy. It was delicious—made according to recipe directions and will make frequently!

Excellent! No matter how you feel about lentils, this will make you a fan. I used the black lentils called for. I'm unsure about other kinds of lentils as I am not that big(wasn't) of a fan but this made me look forward to the next serving I could have.

I used homemade chicken broth which is a little richer than commercial broth.  Balsamic vinegar can also be added just before serving.

Soup turned out a bit salty as you'd need to factor in the salt content of the bacon and I used chicken stock powder too. So do taste as you go. I added an extra 1 and a hald cup of water. Overall it is a really straight forward recipe that pleases.

I followed the recipe closely.  It was too salty for my taste, but the overall flavor was good.  I won't use as much cumin next time.

Amazing.  Made exactly as is but I had spicy pepperoni instead of bacon, so sautéed the veggies in chopped pepperoni and omitted the cayenne.  Will add this one to my regular rotation.  Excellent!

This soup was amazing! I added some Lil Smokeys cut into thirds because my family loves them in lentil soup. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was well worth ordering the black lentils online and waiting for the first hint of cooler weather to make this.

This is another delicious recipe by Chef John.    Followed the recipe to the letter and it went down a treat and was enjoyed by all the family.   Will definitely make again.  It was so convenient to make in the slow cooker, you just have to be careful about the amount of liquid to add if you are going out.

Delicious and hearty.  Followed the recipe closely, except that instead of  the bacon, I used some extraordinary smoked ham from our local farmer's market.  I needed no added salt.

Great flavor! I used French green lentils because that is what I had on hand. I highly recommend this soup and I will be making it again!
