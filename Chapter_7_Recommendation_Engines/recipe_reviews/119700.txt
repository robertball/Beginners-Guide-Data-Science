I used a 12" wok over a gas burner, and 6-7 minutes was FAR too long, it came out limp and sad looking.  1 minute of stir-fry plus 1-2 minutes after the sauce was added would have been best.  I used fresh minced ginger, and the taste was delicious, just quite a bit over-cooked.

Just kind of a plain old veggie side. I used frozen broccoli (the steam in a bag kind) but would definitely recommend fresh since frozen broccoli is always a rip off (a bunch of stems, basically) - but this is not reflected in my rating :). I think fresh ginger would also give this a more bursting flavor; it was kind of bland - and I used the directed measurements with about 1/4 of the directed broccoli. Sprinkle with sesame seeds before serving. I might attempt this again...

Pre-cooking the broccoli before stir frying, if the florets are small enough, isn't even necessary.  But even if they're larger, however, the cooking time is off - if you steam or microwave before stir frying, it will only need another minute or two.  The seasoning is quite nice, tho' as a personal thing I could easily skip the ginger.

Needed a basic broccoli stir-fry recipe & this one is definitely a good one. I didn't add the soy sauce as I was using this site's Korean BBQ Chicken Marinade. Served broccoli under marinaded chicken over udon noodles. I'll be making this broccoli again and again with other sauces. May use fresh ginger next time.

This was fantastic!  I love ginger and garlic, and it went very well with broccoli.  I probably wouldn't cook it for so long next time.........our gas burner tends to cook things a lot faster.  Thanks for the great recipe:)

Made this last night as a side dish. I followed the instructions except, like another reviewer said, I only stir-fried it for 3 minutes. Perfect-very crunchy ( but cooked) broccoli. The ginger adds a pleasant taste while not overpowering the broccoli.

Makes a great side dish!  I used a package of frozen broccoli and that I partially cooked in the microwave before adding to the skillet.  Love the flavor of garlic, soy and ginger together!

Super easy/fast to make--great for adding some green to the family dinner. Have made it twice now and it's way better with fresh broccoli than frozen IMO.

Very good... I did have to double the soy and ginger however.  I made it exactly like the recipe, but then decided it was still somewhat bland... Great recipe.  Went well w/ a chicken and fried rice stir fry

This tasted really good.  I will make it again.  I did add a little more garlic, soy sauce, and ginger than it called for.
