I find that fermentation results are more variable, & less controllable, than those of any other food preparation method. They can be affected by any of the following: the ratio of salt to water, ratio of brine to cucumbers, cucumber size, cucumber quality (related to freshness, growing season/conditions/weather, strain/cultivar, etc.), ambient temperatures during fermentation, the unknowable variables of lactobacilli &, seemingly, assorted other completely mysterious forces. In other words, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results." So one should always consider the lactobacilli to be the capricious executive chef in charge, & oneself to be merely a lowly assistant!

This is a very old fashioned way of doing dills. It is exactly the way my Ukrainian grandmother and aunt made pickles. They are delicious and perfectly sour. I do omit any spices, using only lots of garlic and dill. Thanks Chef John for the memories. Made a batch last week and they are perfect.

These were way too salty if you ate them fresh from the jar after 8 days. However, I completely rinsed the pickles in fresh water and then put them in glass sealable jars that were filled with fresh water and the dill from the pickling process. They were then kept in the frig and they were FABULOUS. The family said that these were my best pickles ever.

Extremely salty. Not edible. Flavor - yuk. No redeeming facets.

Now I was convinced the majority of reviews saying this was too salty didn't weigh their salt out. I weighed my salt out since I wasn't using kosher salt. Luckily I decided to taste the brine before starting and found out it was WAY too salty. Not sure where I went wrong but I just added water till I got a nice salty brine that "seemed" right.

I’ve made it. I think next time to cut the amount of salt a bit. But otherwise it turned out very nice! I’ve transferred the pickles into mason jars and kept them in my fridge for quite a long time without any problem. Thanks for the recipe!
