Yum! That's pretty much all I've got to say about that. Doesn't exactly taste like lasagna, more like a thicker minestrone - but it's delicious! I used farfalle, because I couldn't find the pasta called for - about 1 1/4 cup. And regular Italian Sausage, as its what I had on hand. This is a keeper!
Oooh! I think adding some zucchini would be awesome too!

This is fantastic!!  I made it exactly as written, and it was great. It wasn’t quite a lasagna taste, so I added about 1/3 cup of part skim ricotta, and that just took it over the top. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Very good and flavorful. I was looking for a different kind of soup and this totally fit the bill. Only change i made was i did half pound of sasauge and half a pound of diced chicken thighs,   just wanted another kind of meat in the soup besides the sasauge, and Italian sasauge can be a little rich so I wanted to mellow it out a bit....yum, will definitely be making this again! Kids, who can be picky loved it too!!!

The only change I made was to use frozen spinach instead of fresh; best soup ever!!! My husband and I loved it and will add it to my "go to" fall and winter soup file! Tasted just like lasagne but without the hard work...

It was a good soup, the pasta absorbs all of the liquid over time and become just Pasta over night. It is still good.

Turkey sausage does not taste good in our home.....allergies to onion, garlic, and tomatoes.  The fresh mushrooms are excellent and we  had Lasagna pasta to add.  The fresh spinach was a nice addition.  Next time, we will use low sodium beef broth.  Thanks for reading.  A French baguette will be eaten with the soup next time.

Delish!
I used Hot Italian Sausage. No Basel. I sprinkled the 2 cheeses on individual bowls. In the pot it just melts, sticks to bottom and sides of pot and the ladle.

I made this for the first time yesterday and had to discipline myself not to have a third bowl.  Same with my husband. I think that I might cook the pasta ( I used small sea shell pasta..)separately next time because it soaked up all the broth and we like our soups more liquid.

I used regular italian sausage mild and didn't put the cheese in but served on top with the fresh basil as I find cheese sometimes gets gummy.

Yum!!! I used ground beef instead of Italian sausage because of picky eaters. Also, I didn’t have a can of tomatoes with Italian seasoning so I used a regular can and added dry Italian seasoning. End result is delicious and just may be my new favorite soup!

I followed the recipe, except for the mozzarella cheese (just a personal preference).  Oh, and I accidentally purchased ground turkey and not sausage (realized this after I came home).  And it still turned out tasty!  I want to make it again, and might put in both turkey sausage as well as ground meat.   It was a hit in our family!

Delicious and relatively easy. Unlike other reviewers, I used turkey sausage, which turned out very flavorful.  Goes well with french bread.  Family liked it; I loved it.

Notes : I used turkey sausage, as specified, and boxed chicken broth.   I used half fresh basil and half dried, which I threw in at the very end.  I did not drain the grease from the turkey, because the instructions didn't say to do so.

Wonderful. This is a fantastic soup, rich and hearty. Perfect for a cold fall day. 
I changed the sausage for ground beef, and once served put a bowl of ricotta on the table to top the soup with. Tasted just like lasagna. Definitely making a 3rd time and many more. A new family favorite.

I do believe this is a 5 star recipe but I did make some changes. I doubles the pasta and added another 2c of broth. Added a bit more turkey sausage and some italian seasoning. I used frozen spinach and added 1/3c ricotta. This was AMAZING! Decently quick too. Will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks so much!

This recipe had a few more ingredients than I like to work with, but the results were fantastic. The family and friends raved about its robust taste and warming consistency. I used miniature bow-tie pasta and added more than the 1 cup called out in the recipe. For the turkey sausage I used ground Italian sausage. I will definitely make this one again, soon!

I made several modifications but I always do. It does not taste exactly like lasagna but after adding ground beef, and using extra farfalle it was pretty close! I also left out the spinach because I would never put spinach in soup. Thank you for sharing this recipe??

Came out really well, Sausage was a better flavor than beef would have been, left out the mushrooms. Might add another half cup of pasta for future dinners.

This soup is SOOO good. It tastes like lasagna but in soup form! Ground turkey is the perfect meat for this but it would also be tasty with smoked sausage ??

I used pork sausage, a little less onion and garlic, and upped the pasta to 1.5 cups.  It was great. Will make again.

Fantastic soup.  I used the mini pasta, added 1lb of ground beef with pork sausage, spatini and more liquid.  It truly tastes like lasagna in a bowl.  YUMMMMM!

I made a few tweaks for my liking (venison sausage, Less onion, more pasta) the increased pasta made for more of a pasta dish instead of a soup, but it’s delicious!

Wish there were more stars as this recipe was THE BOMB!  I made it twice within a week - it was such a hit!  One pot cooking is always a plus!!!

I doubled the basil and substituted italian sausage for the turkey sausage and monterrey jack cheese for mozerella on the second attempt!  It is phenomenal.  Everyone who had it wanted the recipe!

I made this exactly to the recipe, using Farfalle pasta, and it turned out really well.  I did adjust the pasta portion to 2-cups, and that seemed to be about the right amount.  I found it to be very flavorful, and thought the thickness was just about right.

This is so much easier to make than lasagna.  Changes I made was hot Italian pork sausage and hamburger, beef broth, added Italian Seasonings to give it a better lasagna taste and little Oregano.   Big hit at my house!  I also put the cheeses in the servings rather than in the pot.

I added peppers a mixed bag of red, yellow and orange , lot s of garlic ( if that s your thing). Used ground beef instead of sirloin and didn t have pressure cooker so made it as a regular soup. Still turned out amazing, thinking spinach next time I make it! Oh and the parmesian cheese just after you put it in the bowl tops it all off beautifully!

I made it for a Wednesday night church thing. People really loved it and several asked for the recipe. I made it pretty much as written. I do keep pesto in the freezer and added some to the sauce. I think it enhanced it but it still would have been delicious without.

Smelled wonderful while it was cooking!  Substituted some red wine for part of the broth.  Used 1 1/2 cups pasta.  I agree with some other reviewers that stirring the cheese into the soup wasn't a good idea.  Mine seemed to stick to the sides of the pan rather than incorporate into the soup.  Will make again but will put the cheese on top.

Was a hit at our house, only thing I didnt like was adding the cheese to the whole pot, next time I’ll add it per bowl. Tip.. add tomatoes and sauce first so you can rinse your cans with the stock

I made it and our family loved it, wife's side of the family is from Sicily and they loved it.   You must really make the effort to find the "Mafaldine noodles" they truly make this soup look and taste, like real home made Lasagna.   It's a keeper, we  can't wait to have the leftovers. Maybe next time I cook it there'll be some.

After a long day at work and( with (finally ) cooler evenings  I made this soup. Followed the recipe religiously except my grocery didn’t have the turkey sausage but did have chicken Italian sausages so substituted that. Also can’t resist adding a splash of red wine to almost anything. Excellent!! My adult”boys” and  rather fussy eaters both had seconds! A keeper for sure!

Kids LOVED this!   I used pork sausage, no basil, and extended the recipe to account for 3 growing boys.  It was gone in one-sitting!  I also used fresh diced tomatoes as well as canned.  Quick and easy.

I used well-seasoned ground chicken, mushroom soup (I didn't have fresh mushrooms), used twice as much parmesan because I am not a fan of mozzarella. It was delicious. My mom & step-dad loved it as well.
