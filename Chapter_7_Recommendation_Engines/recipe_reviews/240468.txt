Tuna & Vegetable Casserole Haiku: "This is unlike me, TOO many vegetables, in this casserole." The poor tuna got lost in all those veggies, and we LOVE veggies in our house. I know that I will make this again (tasted fantastic -- just needed salt when we served it b/c I took the submitter's suggestion and exchanged the french-fried onion for additional grated cheddar on top), but I would reduce the peas/carrots/green beans/zucchini/mushrooms to maybe 1/2 c. each. Oh, and I just mixed frozen peas, carrots and green beans in that way rather than zapping them at all, and when I sauteed the mushroom, I also lightly-sauteed the zucchini and onion. 425 deg for 20 min. started to scorch the cheese and noodles around the edges (a little crusty I'm down w/!) so I think next go-around, I'd go more like 350 covered for 20 min., then uncovered for 10-15 w/ the extra cheese on top. I'm glad that I made this and am able to give it a positive rating to hopefully knock that dopey 1-star review for "not knowing what to do w/ the noodles" - duh!

Good one here…the veggies could have gone into the pot with pasta near the end .. maybe the last 5 or 6 minutes. I would have sautéed the onions with the mushrooms in the skillet for a nice mixture of flavors there and when do we add the pasta to the casserole dish? I assume it would be in step 5. I like the Worcestershire splash ( a rock star friend of mine did it that way). Overall a nice healthy and colorful Tuna Casserole !!  Chris jazz cook Ho…

I didn't use the onion or the squash. Seeing that it called for a cup for each vegetable I doubled the tuna. The carrots came out a kind of a bit hard, so next time I make this recipe, I'll cook them longer. This was an amazing dish. I will be throwing this recipe into the dinner rotation. Thanks, Enaid for sharing this recipe.

had cream of asparagus on hand which worked fine.... but if one wishes to eat more healthfully, suggest skipping the directive to serve it "topped ... with French fried onions" or "more grated cheese or crushed potato chips" as the author notes.... instead, add some crunch with shaved almonds which provide healthful fat.... also, good to use whole wheat rotini/similar in lieu of egg noodles.

I just made this tonight and it was great! I did make some adjustments. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onion and vegetables as another poster suggested. I also cut the vegetables in half. I also added garlic powder, italian seasoning and celery salt in addition to the salt and pepper. I used half mozzarella and half cheddar cheese to mix in and saved some for the topping. Instead of milk I used sour cream since I still had some on hand. I also topped it with panko bread crumbs with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. My husband went back for seconds and my daughter cleaned her plate! (something she rarely does) I will be making this again.

This turned out delicious. I omitted mushrooms since we didn't have any, substituted heavy cream for the milk, and added some garlic powder. To cut down on extra carbs I put shredded mozzarella on top instead of the French onions. Definitely one I will make again, but I will add an extra can of tuna next time since I could barely taste the tuna.

Overall a good concept. I would make it again. The only exception being that I would add the fried onion topping at the very end. Most of my topping was burnt and had to be picked off.

I would leave out the fresh mushrooms, they added an odd texture, also definitely more tuna than called for. But it was a recipe really good for a base and to tinker with. Will make again.

Very bland and needed more tuna for sure. I don't think it is even worth trying to modify to make it again.

I actually disliked it thoroughly and would give it one star  except its blandness may be partially my fault because I did not use solid tuna.  Per comments, I added basil, garlic, and celery seed. It was still painfully bland. I made it because it seemed to have a lot of vegetables, but even that couldn't save it. Plus I didn’t like egg noodles as a base.  I won’t be making this again.

I used a bag of steamed vegetable medley and corn. Tasted good, but maybe should have used a little more cheese.

Use only good solid white tuna and assuming you like tuna then add an extra can. I would double the milk to get it a little more wetter. I didn't like it for leftovers but it is a good recipe.

I will make again. I cut the cheese way back to 1/4 cup, used more mushrooms and peas, no green beans or squash this time. I didn't miss the french onion topping either.

Very tasty. I think you could use almost any vegetables; I used portobello mushrooms, carrots, corn, and broccoli. 

Next time I would add more Worcestershire, and perhaps more tuna... Or less pasta :)

This is a wonderful EASY recipe. My family and friends love it. As with others, I tweaked this and used more tuna and used vegetables I had on hand (some frozen). I love to put shredded cheese on top!
