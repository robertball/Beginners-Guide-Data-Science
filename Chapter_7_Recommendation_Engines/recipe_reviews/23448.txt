Good recipe. Very subtle flavor of the pumpkin. The only complaint I have is that the soup is a bit too thick for my liking (esp. after the pasta is added). If I were to do this recipe again, I wouldn't add the pasta.

Way too bland! I was left with way too much nasty soup. I really upped the amount of spices because of other's reviews, but it still didn't help. I should have listened to the others.

This soup was fragrant and delicious!  The cilantro was just the most perfect touch.  Out of all the different soups i have made, this is the one that my husband and i have agreed is the best -- and we have tried many 5 star recipes from this site!

Soup was good, but was not as savory as I thought it would be. Seemed a bit bland rather than savory and creamy.

Very tasty. This soup is more like a bisque and it is much better the second day (leave it in the fridge overnight for the flavors to blend). Top it with some mozzerella cheese and it's great! I'm making this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and I'll serve it in tiny pumpkins.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago, and have though about making it again ever since. I got the impression it was an "old-fashioned" style soup, since only my friend's grandmother was very vocal about how good it was ("No one makes food like this anymore!"). My concern in making it now is the 2 cups of heavy cream... I suppose milk would work, but I was also wondering if a mixture of silken tofu and water might work as a healthier alternative.

I would rate this recipe with NO STARS if I could.  It was extremely thick and very bland.  I made it for Christmas dinner for my family, and most of them forced it down not wanting to hurt my feelings - until I let them know that I didn't like it as well.

I made this soup for the guests at my annual Octoberfest and it was a big hit.  Most people were leary about eating Pumpkin Soup, but after trying it, they all asked for the recipe.

I loved this soup. I however did not add the pasta, because I wanted a totaly creamy soup, and I used my hand held blender to puree.  It was very tasty.

We used this in our cooking program- cooking for 30+ people. A lot of raised eyebrows at the menu and even more converts to pumpkin soup, as I went home and had to make it once for family and again for a party. Sara you are a pumpkin evangelist with this recicipe.

This soup is perfect for me.  Its a pumpkin bisque soup, and just what I need to have a side for lunch at work.  Preparation is minimal, and it mixes up in one pot, so I'm pleased with the ROI.  I love pumpkin, so the taste is fine for me the way it is.  I substituted minced garlic from a jar instead of the garlic powder.  I omitted the pasta (I try to avoid carbs) and am most pleased with the results.  I may increase the pumpkin pie spice next time, and the cilantro.  Thank you for this recipe - its going into the rotation!!

too thick. Seemed like it would be a good sauce on top of pasta, but shouldn't have pasta in it

This is too much like a "cream of pumpkin" type soup. It IS very bland (despite the directions not stating that the cilantro measurement is for FRESH cilantro and having my husband put WAY too much dried in).  It definitely needed some salt and pepper.  Even then, it wasn't great.      Also incredibly unhealthy with all the cream, sour cream and cheese! Adding vitamins (from the pumpkin) to fat doesn't really make the fat better for you :)    Overall, decent enough if you are looking for a cream of pumpkin (like cream of celery in a can) soup, but not a good PUMPKIN soup.

My husband rates this 4 stars because he didn't get enough.  My kids rate it yummy.  I made two loaves last night and it is gone now!!!  It was very tasty and moist although I did have a little trouble with swirling the cream cheese mixture. Next time I will try layering it as suggested by some.  Still good otherwise.
