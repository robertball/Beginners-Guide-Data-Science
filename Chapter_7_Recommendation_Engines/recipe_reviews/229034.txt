I added salt. I ate this with some homemade sourdough bread and it was delicious!

We enjoyed this soup (omitted the sugar).Needed a touch of sea salt though.

Paired this with a complex salad at a big family (15 of us) meal at Christmas time. I used a food processor, as I didn’t have an immersion blender. I used small sweet peppers and kept the beef and chicken broth ratio at 1:1 (no more room in the pot!). Everyone, including my picky kids, really enjoyed it. We’ll be making this one again!
