A bit strong but I added some fat-free Half & Half and it was really good. We also used white chocolate irish cream (new) and it was tasty.

this is a good drink i have had it at a few bars before. I have found a different version of this drink and found it to me more enjoyable by everybody with out the strong taste.i  use bailieys kaluaha and i eyeball a shot of each. add about 2 ounces of milk then fill it up with coke. it might sound wierd but it actually pretty good. try it out one day.

Oh my mamma couldn't handle this but we can!  Very tasty, I followed the recipe exactly and did use the name brand stuff - not any cheap booze here.  There will be a next time too (okay, several next times).  I've been making ice cubes with fruit juices for summer drinks, now I'm gonna make coffee ice cubes to add to this drink.  Yes, if it is too strong for you, just add a little milk or half and half.  Thanks EGRIVNER!
