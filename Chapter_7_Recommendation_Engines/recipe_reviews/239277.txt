Loved this. I used a little more sausage. I'd recommend cooking the squash in a baking dish with an inch of water on the bottom. No foil necessary.

This is one of the best recipes ever! I'm not one who likes tomatoes so I made mine with turkey kielbasa,olive oil, spinach and garlic, with the squash mixed in. It was most amazing. Everyone else had theirs the "normal" way.  I topped everyone's with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. YUMMMMM!

I love spaghetti squash and this was a simple and nutritious way to utilize it. I, shamefully I must admit, added a lot of shredded parm, salt, butter and garlic powder because I found it a little bland.

Skipped the meat because we are veggie eaters, added fresh basil and used extra garlic and spinach because we love those!

This was tasty. For me it needed some more seasoning, so I added a salt that had some heat to it. I also used some chicken sausage as that was what was in the freezer

I just made for the second time.  This time I used Al Fresco Chicken Italian Sausage.  The flavor is amazing.  I added red and green peppers that I sauteed with the onion and fresh garlic.  This is a perfect Paleo meal.  I served the spaghetti squash on the side.

All in all this was a great dish.  I only used 1squash and that made plenty. I wish I had used more sausage as 2 were just not enough.

We subbed: Canned tomatoes for fresh, and diced everything. We also used Turkey sausage instead of regular sausage.
Other than those two, we followed the recipe. 
Overall, it was good, but very bland. Next time we are thinking about adding different (or more) veggies, more garlic, and maybe a nut for some sort of crunch.

I added a few things to this. I substituted ham for the sausage just because itâ€™s what we had. While the squash was baking, I sauteed an onion, some peppers, the ham; the added the tomatoes and kale; I added the squash, mixed all together, seasoned with salt, pepper, Mexican chili powder, and red pepper flakes. I let it all stew together awhile, and even caramelize a bit on the bottom. The squash was a bit mushy, but the flavors were out of this world!

Had a hard time cutting squash in half. will use smaller one next time.  I was amazed at how much spaghetti came put of the squash. Also used mariners sauce and pre-cooked chicken sausage because that's what I had at hand.

I used ground Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand.  When I browned the sausage I also added some diced onion and garlic.  I did not have a fresh tomato so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I added some Italian seasoning and a little extra salt.  Was very tasty.

Comfort food less than 500 calories per serving (tho I calculate this to make 8 easy).   I used 1 lb sausage browned and crumbled.  Sauteed an onion and shredded carrots and some garlic before adding tomatoes etc.  Mixed all together and baked in 9 x 13 pan for a few minutes in my still warm oven with a cup of mozzarella spread over the top till melted.  I added 1/2c cottage cheese to mine for extra protein and creaminess.  3 & 5 y.o. gobbled it up!

Good recipe. Well received by hubby. I used cooked spicy sausage but fried in pan to char a bit. I also only used one squash. It was enormous. It needs more salt of course. Maybe a bit more garlic as well. Overall very good.

Hands down, the TASTIEST Paleo dish I've had so far! Had to plate the mixture, since the squash shell was pretty much unusable after scraping out all the flesh. Even so, it was fantastic! Full of flavor, and thoroughly satisfying. The spaghetti squash was so effective in simulating noodles that my mind is now spinning with ideas for dishes I thought were behind me!
