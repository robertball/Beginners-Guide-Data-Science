Yum!  This was so good.  My husband loved the sauce and suggested we make it next time we steam lobsters.  That probably won't be till Xmas eve so I plan on making a lot more corn while it's at the height of the season.  I may add even more horseradish since the flavor was pretty mild spread over 8 ears.  Thanks

I served this on corn, and on green beans.  We liked it much better on the beans.  This is a keeper.

This recipe, scaled down for two, was ok, but I found the toppings not quite strong enough when partnered with the absurdly sweet corn available in Japan.  If you corn you think might be too sweet, increase all of the toppings.  (I will double them the next time I make this for 2).

Of all the ingredients to not have, it was the Horseradish I was missing! I made it anyway and it was pretty good - added some home grown chives to it. Next time I will defiantly add the Horseradish. Will probably make this every time I make corn on the cob! Thanks!

This is an excellent way to fix corn! If you begin with good tasting corn, then this recipe will make the corn a real treat.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  With two very strong-flavored ingredients I would have expected the corn to be much more flavorful.  Instead I found it to be bland.  I would not make it again.

I have been making corn on the cob like this for years and no longer make it the old way (with butter only).I don't use the horseradish. And if you don't have the 45 minutes to bake it, its great after 15 or 20 minutes as well.

This was perfect!  We took it out of the oven after 20 minutes and that amount of time was perfect. The sauce didn't overpower the corn; instead, it just enhanced its natural flavor while adding a tiny bit extra.  Will definitely be preparing this again and again!!

I saw this, tried it, and loved it!  We had it with burgers, so I prepped the corn (very easy) and then put it into the oven to bake while we got the charcoal ready and grilled the burgers.  All I did was throw away the foil for clean-up - it didn't even leak on the pan.  I definitely recommend this.

The spread tasted good but it doesn't stay on the corn when cooking. My husband was excited about this recipe and said he was very disappointed that it tasted like "plain corn". If i make it again, I will make extra spread so that i can put it on the corn after cooking too

Cooked the corn in oven for about the first 30 minutes then finished it off over the grill.  Had the same experience as others...the horseradish flavor disappeared even tho we added twice as much AND about a 1/4 t of extremely hot horseradish.  This stuff when you remove the lid almost knocks you out.  Still no horseradish/mustard flavor.  To hopefully solve this next time we are going to not put the mustard/horseradish on until we take off the grill.  Will be interesting to see if that will be a change to keep those flavors.  Also to make healthier we used olive oil for the butter.  Corn was still excellent.

I really liked the flavour of the butter-mix on the corn, but I found it to be a little too subtle. Next time I will use double the butter-mix for more flavour.

Delicious but not overpowering on fresh sweet corn. Paired well with a cheesy potato, chicken, and broccoli bake. I was able to have both parts of the meal in the oven at the same time!

This was great!  I made this for just myself and plain butter and salt for my husband's corn. He tasted the butter before I put it on and thought it was too much.  But after it was done cooking, the flavors were just perfect!

I did not have corn on the cob but used this recipe with thawed frozen corn. We loved the flavor combo of the horseradish and Dijon and I cannot wait to try it again when I have fresh corn.

Meh...I agree with others in that the taste of the horseradish (which I used more of) is nonexistant AND I was very liberal with the mixture.  As someone else suggested, I'll try what's left of the butter on other veggies to see if it works for me.  Thanks, I did enjoy finding another way to make corn on the cob!

Like other reviewers, I couldn't really taste the horseradish, even though I brushed it directly on to the ears. It was still really good, though! We wrapped them in aluminum and put them on the grill.

Pretty mediocre. I couldn't taste the horseradish at all, and the whole mixture had a weird flavor. I used home-grown corn, so maybe the sweetness ruined the balance of flavors, but I have a feeling this was genuinely bad in its own right.

I make this about often in the summer, EVERYONE loves it, I've made this and "plain" for large BBQ's (50 - 100 people) and this corn is the first to go.  I've had many people ask for the recipe and I'm happy to share!  I'm so glad that you did.  Even my mother loves this who does not care for anything more than salt and butter! She always asks when she's coming for dinner if I'm going to have the tasty corn in the foil.  It's easy enough that I have a girl that helps me every summer so even a 9 and 10 year old can help make these!

I just prepared the horseradish mixture and boiled the corn in some sugar water instead of wrapping in foil etc. Tasted great.

It's strange but it's really good! I tried using  " I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead of real butter and it wasn't nearly as good as real butter.

I made it to the recipe and love it. I took them to work cold and when microwaving it , the other employees had to have some. So, I made some for the them the next day. I also like it cold...

Excellent! Gave it a shot last night.  Can't wait to try it again and do some experimentation.
