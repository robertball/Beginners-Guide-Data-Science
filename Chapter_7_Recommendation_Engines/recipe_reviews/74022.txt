The cilantro adds a flavor that sets the recipe apart.  The melons, when ripe, and the salsa is served chilled really is delicious.  I've also usede green chili peppers with the recipe, as some find the Jalapeno a bit too hot

Every time I serve this, several people ask for the recipe. It is a great side for a summer cookout and is best if you make it ahead and chill over night so all the flavor mingle. Serve it immediately out of the fridge for a great hot and cold effect.

If you do try this, cut the amount of onion by at least 3/4ths.

Perfect light side for grilled chicken breasts ! Was surprised how good is the tomatoe-melon mix. However for my personal taste the receipe needed a few changes, thats why is getting a 4 stars. 1) To avoid too strong raw onion taste I used 1 small onion/2p, diced and cooked in the microwave 2-3 minutes previous to addition in the salsa. 2) I skipped the cilandro which is only adding confusion to the mix flavour. 3) I used a whole lime (flesh and juice)and replaced the missing jalapeno by chili powder and GREEN pepper corn. Not even needed to rest a few hours, it's easy, interesting and quick and I would definitively do it again !
