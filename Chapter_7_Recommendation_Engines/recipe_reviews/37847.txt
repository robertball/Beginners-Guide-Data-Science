I'm usually not very picky, but this didn't have much flavor.  I didn't use any oil in the dressing, as the recipe calls for, but I think it would be better if some oil were included.

A favorite in our house.  We use Monterey Jack cheese instead of Mozzarella to give it a kick.

This side dish was a hit. I have made it two times already. I used balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar when preparing the dressing. I also used the "less oil" recipe found on the Good Seasons packet.

Made this as part of an Italian meal for dinner last night. Family didn't care for it, I thought it was pretty good. I am going to go ahead and give it 4 stars although my family said 3. Won't make again.

My husband & I thought this salad was delicious and will definately keep it in my favourites! I used the Italian Dressing Mix (All Recipes) as I didn't have the Salad Dressing Mix on hand and it was excellent with it!

made the salad as a side for my dinner.  wasn't bad but wasn't fantastic either. i used another user's suggestion and used 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup monterey jack for a bit of kick.  will probably make again but probably not as my first choice.

Really tasty.  Use firm tomatoes, even can be a little crunchy.  Used green beans that I had canned earlier in the season, just drained the liquid.
