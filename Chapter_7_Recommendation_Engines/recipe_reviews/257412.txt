This was a total failure. If I could give it negative stars, I would.  The dough never came together even though I added more milk. I wound up with what looked and tasted like sand. Total waste of food and time.

This is a good snack, however the recipe calls for about twice the amount of flour needed! I also added chocolate chips to mine. Yum!!
