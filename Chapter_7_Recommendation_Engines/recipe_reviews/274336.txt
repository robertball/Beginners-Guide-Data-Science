"Meh" at best. Regular cobbler is so easy and 100 times better.

excellent taste, but 45 minutes was way too long.  Next time I will use a 350 degree oven and start checking it earlier.  A lot of butter in this version

I probably won’t make this again. It was easy. After baking about 30 minutes, the biscuit tops were burning.  I cooked it for only 45 minutes and the biscuit tops  were burned and the rest a little doughy. Maybe 350 degrees would have worked better.

Boy this was an easy dessert for my family. Everyone loved it. I served it with homemade peach ice cream. Next time I’ll add a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it a little.
