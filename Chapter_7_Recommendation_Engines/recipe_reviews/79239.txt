I was sold by the ease of dropping the chicken breasts in frozen. This recipe was easy and unique.  The sweet and salty tastes combined were delish... loved it when accompanied by rice pilaf or buttered & salted grits... polenta would also make a great pairing for this dish.

I made a couple of modifications to the recipe and we loved the flavor!  Since other users thought the smoke-flavored sausage was too strong; I substituted 2 links of spicy Italian turkey sausage and mixed dried fruit (apricots, pears, cranberries, etc.).  I recommend serving over rice with herbes de Provence, this was delicious!

This was a great recipe.  I had never started with frozen chicken before and will do it always from now on.  The chicken didn't get dry like it usually does.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I browned the sausage before putting in the slow cooker. The dried fruit soaked up most of the cooking juices so by the end the fruit was nice and plump. The flavour of the sauce was both sweet and salty. Very yummy!

This recipe turned out fabulous.  I did cook the turkey sausage, onion, green pepper, and garlic together in a skillet first.  I layered the frozen chicken, sausage/pepper mix next and followed the rest of the recipe.  I actually had three potatoes that I needed to use so I wrapped those in aluminum foil, poked holes in them and placed them on top of the recipe already in the crock pot for the entire 11 hours that it cooked and they turned out perfectly!  So, we had a delicious meal with spinach salads, baked potatoes and chicken and sausage with a sweet and spicy punch!  YUM!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and cooked it for 8 hrs in the slow cooker but ended up with a pretty much inedible mess.  The chicken turned out dry and not very flavorful.  As for the rest of the ingredients they turned into what can best be described as brown sludge.  I hate to waste food so we ate the chicken after it was scaped clean but the rest went into the trash.  A disappiontment.

I was excited over the sweet salty concept but it didn't work for me.  The main flavor was the peppers and onions, perhaps sauteeing them prior to putting them in the crockpot would lessen their flavor a bit.  The chicken was a little dry, despite being cooked in extra broth.  I didn't use the broth/fruit as a sauce, it didn't look appealing.  I commend whomever posted this recipe, it is interesting and original.  My husband and I thought it was pretty good but the kids gave it a thumbs down.

This dish was barely OK.  My chicken came out dry too.  I didn't think there was much flavor from the fruit in the dish and the turkey sausage really seemed like it didn't belong.  I didn't finish the leftovers the next day.  Sorry, but I won't be making this dish again.

This was my first thing to ever cook in a crock pot, and it was wonderful! I followed the recipe to a T, but used dried apricots instead of the apples. Also used organic chicken stock and frozen chicken breast tenderloins, as I had that on hand. I also didn't have a lot of time, so I cooked it on High for 3.5 hours, and it was perfect! Served it over wheat couscous, it wowed my guests and they all praised this easy meal.

This was a great slow cooker recipe.  There was a whole lot of flavour in this dish. I added a handful of dried apricots, and some mushrooms, and used fresh parsley and mild Italian sausage as that was what I had on hand.  Loved the end result. We will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I love the fact that this recipe was very easy and healthy. I personally did not like the end result--I agree with another poster that the sausage flavor kinda drowned the flavors of eveything else. The chicken was however, extremely moist and I will always use frozen chicken breast when using the crock pot--it worked great.  Even though I was not a huge fan of the flavors of this recipe my husband came home really late and ate it reheated in the microwave and said he loved it!!!!!

I thought this recipe was great, the chicken became a little dry, but adding more broth would make it perfect, or tenderizing it a bit. I gave it 5stars my boyfriend thinks it should have 3-4//Made this recipe again, and yet again after taking my notes into consideration it was too dry.

this was just ok. the chicken was dry, even though i used frozen as recommended. everything else was mush. the flavor was bland. It's a shame because it was so easy and did smell wonderful while cooking.

I donâ€™t have a slow cooker, so I modified this recipe for cooking on the stovetop.  Even though I altered the recipe quite a bit, Iâ€™m still going to rate it since I couldnâ€™t have made the meal without it! :)  Hereâ€™s what I did: Cooked sausage and set aside. Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and browned in pan. Added onion, red bell pepper (didnâ€™t have green, but thought red looked nicer with the dish than green would have), Â¾ or so cup of mushrooms, approximately 1 T. garlic, and sautÃ©ed until soft. Added apples, cranberries, chicken stock, parsley, and chives. Reduced heat to low, covered, and simmered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Added cooked sausage to mixture and continued simmering an additional 10 minutes.  Thought it needed additional seasonings so I added oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, additional parsley, a dash of red pepper flakes, and a dash of cinnamon.  Also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the liquid.  With my changes, the dish came out sweet and slightly spicy.  It would make a wonderful holiday dish.  I would make it again.

This is a great and easy recipe to throw together when you're going to be gone all day.  There is a lot of flavor and the mix of chicken, sausage, and the dried fruit really combine well.  As for my own recommendations, I think the frozen chicken is a must.  I also added 3/4 cup of mushrooms to the veggie mix and used a dried fruit mix instead of just dried apples.  Chicken broth is a little too boring for me, so I used beer (Sam Adams Summer Ale worked very well).  As for the dried chives, it's not something I keep lying around so I just used fresh chives.  All in all, a great recipe and one that gives you a little leeway to make it your own.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and I've got to say, it was odd.  The smoked sausage seemed to impart its smokiness to everything, drowning out the cranberries and the apples, and making the chicken breats just smokey and oniony.  I don't think I'll fix it again, not hugely popular with the family

I did add a few ingredients, but that is my choice - I added a tsp of celery seeds and some frozen french cut green beans to give it substance - I am on a Low Carb Diet and do not eat rice therefore had to add something else for substance.  I do want to thank Theresa for sharing this simple Crockpot recipe (I love crockpot recipes because I work full time).  It was really good for a chilly night also.

I enjoyed the chicken with sausage and dried fruit, but my husband did not like the flavor combination.  I'll use less of the fruit if I make it again.  If you are diabetic, be cautious because of the dried fruit.  It made my sugar go up that day.

This was really good.  I didn't measure the stored for because the reason I made this recipe was to use up a bunch of dried tropical fruits.  So itwas apples, dates, mango, kiwi, etc. I'd say it was about 4 cups. I had soaked it overnight in water (or was really dry and hard.) I included the juice from that and also added enough broth to just cover the food in the cockpot.  I'd say that was important; we appreciated enough broth to juice up the rice and toppings.  I didn'thave smoked sausage so i used turkey breakfast sausage and added a drop off smoke seasoning.  I never did decide if the sausage belonged in it or not.  Next time, I'll leave out. But no one complained Anyway, very good.  

With some very few modifications this will make an amazing sweet and sour pork or chicken dish.  That, I believe, will be 5 stars.

I did not care for this recipe. Yes, I know how to cook and yes, I followed the directions.

It was easy to make. The house smelled wonderful. I also used frozen chicken breast and the moisture was good, however.... it was bland. I was hoping for more flavor thinking it had cranberries, apples etc.  probably wonâ€™t make it again

This recipe was good overall for ease of preparation and also taste.
I think when I make it again, I will wait until the last 20 minutes to add the apples and cranberries. Stewing them with everything made them take on all of the flavors in the mix instead of offering a sweet element into the rest of the dish. Not the end of the world, but my fiance was a bit put off by how squishy the apples got.
But I liked it! Great the next day too! I thought it would even be tasty to top with some pecans.
