If prepared as written, I don't think this would be very good.  Canned soup and raw onions?  I followed the advise of other reviewers and sauted the onions and garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter.  Then I added another tblsp of butter and the flour and made a roux with fat-free half and half (thanks, Lin), then I added the canned soup along with some Worchestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, paprika and nutmeg.  Once this mixture was hot, I added 2 10 oz bags of fresh spinach, stirred it in, covered the pan and allowed to cook for about 10 minutes.  Once the spinach had wilted, I added some freshly grated parm and poured the mixture into a casserole dish.  I topped the spinach with bread crumbs and more parm and baked it for 20 minutes.  This barely resembled the original recipe, but it was delicious.  Thanks for the basic idea.

I've been looking pretty hard for a good creamed spinach recipe lately and I think I have found it. It's very easy and really good. The first time, I made it straight from the recipe. The second, I added about 1/4 cup (maybe a little less) of half and half. That seemed to give it something I thought more suitable. Either way, it's very good, thanks for the post!

I agree with some of the others that this was too bland. I always take a little bite as I go along and knew that I needed to do something to make this side more exciting. In addition to adding more spices, I made a roux using fat free half and half and added in some parm. What a difference it made. Topped it off with more parm and a bit of paprika. Ended up making this in the morning and just popping it in the oven later on. Good start tho and thanks! BTW RogerBerry, please let me compliment you on your advice about using your potato ricer to squeeze out the spinach. I've been struggling with trying to squeeze the water out of spinach for YEARS and never once thought of the ricer. You're a genious man! I'll be posting this helpful hint on my OurTableTalk.com forum for my friends to see. Thanks so much and I can't even begin to tell you how much time I saved!!

I love this easy recipe! I make a few small adjustments. I use 1 can cream celery and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I also cut back on the onion a bit and saute them with a little EVO and garlic to soften before adding. I also add some parmesan to the mix or cheese blend. Then I put it in a dish and top with some bread crumbs and more cheese and bake at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes until bread crumbs are browned. We love this recipe. Thanks so much!

I served this as a side dish with our Thanksgiving dinner and it stole the show.  I did alter the recipe by adding 1 cup of shredded mozz. cheese right before taking the dish off of the stove.  Great dish, and thanks!

a dash of worchestershire, hot red pepper flakes and celery salt help this recipe.  To squeeze dry thawed spinach, use your potato ricer.

A terrific, easy and lower calorie version of a favorite!  I prepared as directed(used low sodium, low fat soup) but added a bit of grated parmesan to the mix, topped with cheese and bread crumb, and baked with my pork tenderloin for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Thanks for sharing this!

This was delicious and really did taste gourmet.  Was a snap to make.  I used real garlic and added a dash nutmeg like the "pros".  Served it with the infamous pork chop recipe from this site and got rave reviews on the meal on this cold night.  It hit the spot.

Delush!  I didn't have the cream of celery soup, so used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic and omitted the minced garlic.   It was great!  My 11 year old son asked if he could have it for breakfast. Will definitely make again!

This turned out perfect! I followed the recipe ingredients to the T but have to admit to a change in preparation. I decided to saute the onions, garlic and spinach in a small frying pan with a bit of olive oil. In another saucepan I mixed the rest of the ingredients. I had absolutely no problem with the water in the spinach as it cooked out. When the onions were softened, I just added the soup mixture in. I topped it with some parm cheese when served and my family raved! This was a wonderful creamed spinach! (I just got back from London where they served creamed spinach on a burger with chili-Delicious! I plan to try this on my next burger!)

This also makes a great alternative to spinach dip when you add parmesan cheese. I did not have any cream of celery soup so I found a recipe and made my own. It was easy and my husband loved it. Much less fat than traditional creamed spinach or spinach dip.

Based on other reviewer's here are my changes that worked out great. 
1.  Saute in olive oil the onion, garlic and spinach (fresh).
2.  Make a roux using the 4 tbspn butter and some flour
3.  Add roux to spinach
4.  add cream of celery to spinach
5.  add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
Tastes Great!

I used cream of mushroom soup in this recipe and we didn't really care for it.  We found the ratio of soup mixure to spinach to be too high; all we could taste was cream of mushroom soup.  My hunt for a really great creamed spinach recipe is still on :(

This is amazing.  I used Cream of Mushroom soup and sauteed the onions in 1 tbs butter.  I added about one half cup of half and half to the roux and seasoned it generously with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic salt.  I also sprinkled the roux generosuly with grated parmesan.  I used a 16oz bag of frozen, chopped spinach and thawed it and dried it between two kitchen towels.  I poured the mixture into a casserole dish and baked for 45 minutes at 350.  I sprinkled the top with bread crumbs and parmesan.  It was as good as in the fancy restaurants.

I wanted to use a thawed box of frozen spinach and thought of creamed spinach - but was out of milk and cream. Followed everything else but with only the one box of spinach and thought it was great. My often finicky mother liked it, too, which was perfect.

I think this is a very good recipe. I’ve made it many, many times over the years. Like others, I made a roux. I took a 1/4 c butter, sautéed diced onion & celery in it until soft, then added 1/4 c flour and cooked through. Next I added 1/2 c milk & 1/2 c chicken broth. When it was combined and bubbly I added the 2 packages of spinach (preciously cooked in microwave and very well drained/squeezed). A little parm to finish in the pan, and very quickly, you have a really tasty side dish.

I thought that I had added enough spinach (about 1lb) but it still seemed like there was too much "cream" and not enough spinach.  It tasted good, the consistency just wasn't what I was hoping for.

This was delicious. I did make a few changes.  I cut down on the liquid by a 1/4 and added more spinach than the recipe called for. Everyone raved about this side dish.

This recipe was fabulous! This was my first time making creamed spinach. I loved it. The changes I made were as follows: I added extra minced garlic, celery salt, half and half, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and parmesian cheese and only used half of the required butter. Dont worry about how much cheese you use, the more you have the better (and thicker) it will be. It tasted just like Boston Markets creamed spinach. I will be making this recipe for years to come.

This is so much better than buying frozend creamed spinach and I have noticed that the longer you cook it on the stovetop the better it gets. It turns darker green and it just tastes so good.

I just made this recipe for my family.  I didn't change anything...I followed the recipe as it was written.  I received compliments from the whole family.  What a great recipe...thank you for sharing this!  It is a recipe you can play with to suit your own taste (add cheese, more or less salt, more or less pepper, a different kind of creamed soup, etc.) but the "bare bones" recipe is a great starting point.

Don't use canned spinach!  Usually I can alter ingredients a little, and still get good results, but not with this one. It turned out bland, the onions were still a little firm, even though I cooked it for over 30 mins.
Will use fresh next time.

This is a nice little weeknight sidedish.  I only used one package of frozen spinach and, with the full amount of sauce called for, that seemed to come out about right.  I replaced the garlic salt with granulated garlic and omitted the salt altogether (there was plenty of salt from the canned soup). I also microwaved my chopped onions for 2-3 minutes to give them a headstart.  Served with Brown Sugar Meatloaf, sliced fresh tomatoes, and sticky rice.  Thanks for the nice side dish recipe, Utopia!

This is a great recipe! I made it with three bags of fresh spinach, and I added a bit more flour and evaporated milk to stretch it.  I also added some shredded 4 cheese blend that I had in the house.  It doesnt get any easier! You can't tell canned soup was made, it tastes better than my friend's traditional creameed spinach made with cream and bacon!

This dish was somewhat bland.  I think part of the problem may have been the spinach - I usually use fresh spinach and prefer the taste, and I'm not sure I properly thawed the frozen stuff.  Will probably try again with fresh spinach.

For not being a fan of wilted spinach I liked this. I added some extra pepper and garlic to it along with some Cajun seasoning. Turned out really good.

It was good. I saute'd the chopped onions and garlic in butter before adding to the mixture. Added 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce. I baked it along with the chicken I made for dinner. Will be making this again.

I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Celery, added a bit of cumin, parsley and thyme along with a dash of salt and pepper, the onion and fresh garlic.  It was terrific.

Pretty darn tasty for how simplistic it is. Only thing I added was cheese. I went without the onion since I didn't have one on hand, still great.

This was my first attempt & my husband raved over it!!  Even my 2 year old ate some.  I would've given 5 stars but as others pointed out, this recipe needing some tweaks to make it perfect.  The only things I would change are:  1) reduce the amount of margarine as it was a bit over powering, 2) add a little Worcestershire & red pepper flakes as folks here have recommended and 3) use crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs on top.  I also baked this for 18 mins on 350 degrees.

Rating would fall closer to 4 1/2!  Very good recipe.  I also used half and half and I do think it really added to the flavor.  Also, thought this tasted very light and would be great with just about anything!

This was really good, I was worried after a couple reviews said it was rather bland but it was great.  I did make two additions, I added garlic with the onion and then I added 1 cup shredded mozerella cheese right at the end just long enough for it to melt. It was a huge hit!

I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 because I had to add a lot of cream to make them creamy.  plus the onion stayed crispy and I cooked it awhile.  I will either omit onion next time or saute them first.  My husband loved it and I think it is a good recipe for company.  thanks.

4 star with minor changes: sauted the garlic and onion til soft. Then added flour for a roux. Addition of 1/2 cup heavy cream with the soup, and a pinch of nutmeg. Great flavor and exactly what I was looking for.

I made this the night before my family's Christmas party to give it a test run and it was quite good.  My husband, a big fan of creamed spinach, thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream at the end because it appeared rather dry.  While I thought it lost something in quadrupling it for a big family dinner, however (even with the addition of heavy cream), my family gave it good reviews.  Reheated beautifully.

Made as is and felt it was very average.  Good, but not great.  Everyone agreed.  Maybe it was the cream of celery soup.  I bet it would be better with cream of chicken, cheese, or potato.

Had to variate a bit as I had no cream of celery soup.  I sauteed lots of garlic in butter then added cream.  I put this in wilted spinach, mixed them up and added parmesan cheese.  While hot, I added grated mozarella.....yummy!  Thanks! :)

I used lowfat Cream of Celery & halved the amount to reduce the sodium. I used olive oil rather than butter and carmelized the onions then added the soup. Delicious and easy!

The taste was great... the texture was terrible.  My boyfriend would not even take my word that it really tasted OK because it was sooo slimy in appearance.  Did I do something wrong?

Excellent and SO EASY! My kids loved it, and so did my husband.  I added Parmasean as suggested and it was fantastic.

My favorite new vegetable!  Super yum. I used the low-fat cream of celery- so it was low fat AND low carb.  Next time I will decrease the onion and saute for longer, a few shakes of creole seasoning- perfect creamed spinach.

Maybe I didn't understand the recipe.  I was more like Creamed Onion.  I modified this recipe and it tasted great.  Cut back onion to 3 tablespoons.  Saute the onion in the butter to start with.  Then add the flour to the butter / onion mix and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Then follow the recipe.  But finish with 1/4 cup parm. cheese.

Delicious!  Will make again! The only thing I'd change is to maybe soften the onions by sauteeing them for a few mins in the butter and garlic, then add to the soup at the same time as the spinach.

I thought this was a little bit bland, but it wasn't bad.  I like a little more zing in my creamed spinach.
