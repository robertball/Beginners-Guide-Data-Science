I loved this salad!  Needed a recipe for a pot luck, and decided to try this one.  Only changes I made (because of what I had available) was to use chicken instead of tuna, dried cranberries instead of the raisins and mayo instead of salad dressing.  I had to make copies of the recipe for everyone at the pot luck....and now it is a favorite in many homes!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Awesome! I made one alteration I used ham flakes instead of tuna, because we have people in our family who won't eat tuna. Terrific and easy to make!

Made this for a cook out, made it for 20 people  Everyone liked it.  Would make it again.  Increased the amount of carrot and raisins just for color.

YUM!  I needed to use up some cooked, whole wheat farfalle (bow tie pasta) and wanted a salad with pasta and ranch, so I did a search and this one came up.  I'm glad I chose it!  I did make some changes based on reviews and what I had on hand.  I can't have store-bought Ranch Dressing, so I make my own.  Instead of using the salad dressing/mayo and the dry mix, I just used an equal amount of already prepared Ranch Dressing.  I used a can of chicken breast instead of tuna, dried cranberries instead of raisens (rest of the family doesn't like them), and shredded the carrot.  Since I didn't have tri-color pasta the salad needed some green, so I added chopped parsely.  I used a Fuji apple and sharp cheddar.  Scrumptous!  Thanks for the quick and easy and delicoius recipe!

Great salad to bring anywhere! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added dried cranberries instead of raisins, the whole 6oz package because they are tasty! I also used canned chicken because not many at my BBQ preferred the tuna. As a creamy salad dressing, I used Ranch.

This recipe is great. I substituted dressing for reduced fat mayo, tuna for canned salmon, used whole grain pasta, and cheddar for swiss. results were spectacular.

This was good but needed a little fixing up. After a night in the fridge all the dressing was soaked in by the pasta, but I just poured some plain youghurt on it and that worked great. Also tossed in some extra raisins because it was a bit bland. Adding some mixed seeds also helps change it up. A nice pasta salad that I ate happily for an entire week for lunch.

My new favorite lunch! It's best with granny smith apples (in my opinion!) and I love it with dried cranberries, too! I make a big batch of it and eat it for lunch all week!

oooo very different I like it! I used mayo and I think you may need more than 1 cup since it really soaks into the pasta but what a great change to the same old mayo, mustard, vinegar recipe

Rave Reviews at our family BBQ tonight!  Modifications: used the whole packet of ranch, used some sour cream along with the mayonnaise.  Omitted the raising, and added a chopped yellow pepper.  Truly delicious, everyone had 2-3 helpings!  THANKS!

I loved it and my whole family did too. I didn't use carrots b/c it wasn't on hand.

I left the tuna out since I was serving this as a side dish for a cookout.  My husband loved it, I liked it well enough but I am not big on "sweet" pasta salad, next time I would use mayo instead of salad dressing, and would add ham instead of tuna. It kept well and stayed moist, hubby ate on the bowl all week long.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It was bland and no one in my family wanted to eat it which is rare because tuna/pasta salads usually are something I can get everyone to eat. I made it according to the directions (using whole wheat pasta)

I followed instructions but recipe seemed dry,  Needed more salad dressing.  Tasted a little  bland.  I needed for a recipe group the next day so I added more dressing,  roasted pine nuts and added cranberries but I would not make again.

I reviewed this back in 2007, and have been making it since then.  I made it again today, and the changes I made were to substitute Ken's Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing for the creamy salad dressing + ranch combo.  It is definitely a sweeter pasta salad, but still delicious.  I am eating it right now straight out of the bowl, without waiting for it to go in the fridge...

This recipe was good but a little on the bland side. Firstly, I used my own homemade Ranch dressing mix. Secondly, I had to add some freshly ground black pepper, paprika and fresh chopped chives from my garden...still a bit bland. I also substituted cranberries for raisins because I didn't have any in the pantry. For the final touch, I squeezed some lemon juice on top. It is good and I will probably make it again but with more herbs/spices to bring it up!

This is the best salad.  I have already made 2 batches in a week!  2 of my family members who don't like tuna love this salad.  YUMMY!
