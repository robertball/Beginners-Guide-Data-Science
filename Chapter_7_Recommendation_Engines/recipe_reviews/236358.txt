4 tablespoons of olive oil!? I used 2, and still the sauce was rather greasy. Additionally, the tomatoes must be seeded, or the sauce will be far too runny. I ended up running it through a strainer. Still, the effort was minimal and the result was alright. I will likely make this again, with these changes.

I made this with a few changes...I used penne pasta as I find mini wheels to be a little too thick for my taste. (Personal preference). And because thats what I had in the pantry.Though the photo with the mini wheels is beautiful! And I added garlic when sauteing the onions. And finally added 2 tbsps. Chili sauce...just enough for a little added flavor as some reviews said it was bland. We loved it ! This site has several good pasta salads and I think a lot of them can be made with enter changeable pasta.

I've made this twice. It's a bit bland, which makes it great for kids. To spice it up just a bit the second time around, I added garlic to the saut√© onions and red pepper flakes. It was delicious!

It would make a fine side dish for a picnic or potluck. It's not particularly filling, so it doesn't work as a meal. You can easily increase the amount of peas, ham, and cheese though--the current proportions seemed heavy on the pasta and light on everything else.

Similar to pasta, salami, & peas recipe. This is good, I also added Garlic with the onions. This dish is somewhat healthy and easy to make.
