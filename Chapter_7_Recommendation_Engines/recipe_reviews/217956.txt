Hands down and without a doubt, a new Christmas morning tradition was born this year. This was the easiest, most incredibly delicious and well received breakfast I've served in quite some time. Not to sweet at all, just the perfect amount.  I used a 1 1/2 lb loaf of sourdough bread, cut to large cubes, with 9 ex-large eggs. I upped the milk to closer to 2 cups and increased the almond extract to a teaspoon. I also used a jar of my home canned pears instead of store bought. I didn't slice them but instead left them in halves. Once baked (65 minutes in my oven), it puffed up beautifully. Also topped the servings with fresh whipped cream flavored with almond extract and almond slices. Totally yummy and will most certainly make again. Love it and thanks for submitting this recipe.

This was enjoyed by all the morning after Thanksgiving.  Next time I will increase the pears so there is a solid layer of them; as is, they are too far between, and you're only likely to get one every other bite.  I went ahead and put on the almonds before baking.  It was easier and didn't have any adverse effect.  The sourdough and almond extract make this a special french toast. A definite keeper~

I made this last night and baked it this morning. It's delicious! 

I halved the recipe and made it in a glass pie dish using 6 slices of whole wheat sourdough bread and egg beaters (by the way 1 cup is equal to about 4 large eggs). I did not use almonds.

I forgot to layer the brown sugar on the bottom but remembered before I placed it in the fridge so I layered it on the top. Then when it was done, I flipped it and sprinkled it with more brown sugar and placed it back in the oven for 5 minutes to get all melty. As you can see from my picture it did stick a bit because the sugar caramelized on top. If I were to get the sugar in the right order I'm sure it would be lovely to serve to guests!

I made something extremely close to this (without the pears). It was incredible!! Everyone loved it. 2 1/2 cups of eggs is (according to my own recipe) about 8-12-depending on if you're using medium or large eggs. You can use Egg Beaters as a sub-maybe the reason for the cup measurement. I'm trying it this next week so my comment will be relevant.

Terrific recipe!  I used fresh pears instead of canned, and it turned out great!  Love the syrup that the butter and brown sugar create, it's just enough to give it a wonderful sweetness.

UPDATE:  I just made this recipe again, and used vanilla soy beverage instead of milk, and only put in 6 large eggs, forgot to measure the amount of bread I used, maybe 3/4 of what's recommended?  Just used enough until it soaked up the milk/egg mixture, and it turned out great!  A little less "rich" tasting, but still very good.

This is delicious! It may now be one of my family's favorites. Made it for an event at church and got nothing but rave reviews. It's even good at room temperature. General rule on eggs is that 1 egg is 1/4 cup. However, this all depends on the size of your eggs, so don't worry if it's not exact. I as a bit short on the eggs (probably needed 1-2 more), but still turned out wonderfully.

This was extra easy and VERY tasty.  I cut recipe in half and baked it in a deep dish pie plate. It served 6.  It was light, and not too sweet. I used 5 eggs. I baked it 50 minutes. I served it with pancake syrup. Yum.

Fantastic breakfast! My entire family (even the children) loved this not-overly-sweet breakfast. The only changes to the original recipe that I made was using fresh red pears (three) instead of canned. I had no almond extract, but I added Ceylon cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg over the pears. The cinnamon gave it a great kick.

Was a big hit at a recent brunch.  I substituted canned peaches, used 11 eggs and it took 75 minutes to bake. Not too sweet. If you want it sweeter, I would suggest 1/8 cup more of brown sugar and another tablespoon of butter.  Absolutely delicious.  I also think extra peaches are a good idea, I sliced then thin but not too thin.  Thanks, this was great.

I made this for Father's Day breakfast & my dad loved it!!  He had seconds and asked for some leftovers to take home.  This is definitely a keeper.  I loved being able to prep it the night before, so that all I had to do was stick it in the oven when we got home from church.  Next time, I am going to sprinkle the almonds on top for the last 15minutes of baking so they get a little toasted.  However, unless it is used as a side dish, I don't see how you can get 20 servings.  I made it as the main dish and we had 6 servings (I used a 9x13 dish instead of 10x14)

I thought this was very good and plan to use it for my Bunko breakfast this month. I followed the directions except I used sliced can pears and drained the juice out of it. The recipe didn't say whether it did or didn't. I put the almonds on before baking and used both the almond and vanilla extract. The picture looked like there was whipped cream on it but the recipe didn't address that. I didn't use it and it was great the way it was. I had a pear in every bite.

Loved this because I could make it ahead for a more enjoyable time at brunch with friends!  My modifications based on what I had on hand...made with French bread from Costco, used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla (was out of almond extract), used fresh sliced bosc pears, peeled and it tasted amazing!!!  I had 6 people for brunch and this dish serves 20...well we all had 2nds or 3rds!  ;)

Love this dish, I think the portion sizes are way off, more like a serving for 8 to 10 nowhere near 20. Seems not to freeze real well.

Delicious, easy brunch or dessert that was loved by everyone at church, home, and work. Has a bread pudding consistency but is not overly sweet. Made the following changes, as others suggested:  double the pears (sliced in juice), 10 lg. eggs, 1-1/2 lb. loaves French bread, 2 c. milk (or almond milk and vegan butter), increase almond extract to 1 tsp. if you prefer stronger almond flavor, put generous 4 oz. pkg. sliced almonds on top before baking. 10 x 14 pan - 24 servings.

Great.  Easy to adjust proportions as you like.  I used 1 carton of egg beaters and 2 large eggs.

This recipe was a big hit at a work potluck breakfast!   This is really quite easy and the almond extract and almonds take this dish to different level of yumminess.  I did not change a thing in the recipe, except to add a little bit more eggs and milk to cover all the bread.  This will definitely be one of my "go-to" recipes.  Thanks!

I took this to a brunch today and it was well received by all.  I made half the recipe; used fresh pears, cinnamon swirl bread and cinnamon instead of the almond extract.  Served 4 with some leftovers.  Thanks for posting.

HUGE hit for family brunch! People were asking for recipe. Would give 6 stars if could! Quick to make the night before.  Note my tweeks: double these things - pears, almond extract. Increase milk by 1/2 cup (I used Vit D milk), bread by 1/2 lb, and almonds so total amount is 1/3 cup (2 oz pkg). Use real maple syrup not imitation to drizzle over entire top when still warm out of oven. Melts in mouth.

I used canned pears and found them to taste terrible in this recipe. Pears just dont go with almond extract. I also thought that there should be more sugar added -  it tasted about as sweet as a popover. I doubled the almond extract which I thought was perfect. I will try making this with fresh peaches, more brown sugar on the bottom and a little more white sugar in the egg mixture.

Yummy!  Fresh pears are a must....not too ripe/soft, a bit firmer is better! Press the bread down into the egg mixture to assure that it's completely covered. I like to top it with fresh whipped cream and candied sliced almonds!

I use a lot more fruit on the bottom than it calls for. I've used peaches instead of pears and that was good too. Also added some nutmeg  for additional flavor.

very easy, not too sweet or eggy (doug's mom would like it), baked for 45 minutes in my oven in pyrex and perfect.  Sprinkled almonds on before baking.  Drizzled with a little honey before serving.  I thought the almond was delicate in this and maybe could even increase to a full tsp (and increase the vanilla in this case too) but it was good as-is

This was really good, but I thought it could use at least twice as many pears. Fresh pears would probably be better than canned, but it was still very tasty.

My kids loved it! I had some stake French bread and some very ripe pears. It came out lovely. It wasn't too sweet at all, which was perfect. But those who like it sweet may want more sugar in the egg batter.

I followed all of the directions, but unfortunatley this just did not turn out good at all and it sucks because I had made it to bring in for a work potluck breakfast and it was pretty horrible.  :(
Definitely would not make again, not sure what happened.

This was a hit! I used fresh pears and it was amazing.  I ended up using 11 jumbo eggs to get 2.5 c. I pulled it out at 50 min to add more pads of butter to the top and sprinkle on the almonds. Cooked another 20 min and it was pure magic.

Delicious! My B&B guests loved it. FYI, 2 ½ cups of eggs is equivalent to 12 large eggs. I used four fresh pears, peeled and sliced, rather than canned, and sprinkled the almonds over it about halfway through the baking so that they would be a bit toasted. Served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream with a touch of vanilla added, and no one went for the syrup! Next time (and their will be a next time!) I make it, I would use 6 to 8 pears. I'm also thinking it would be simpler to melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar, and spread it on the bottom, rather than cut the butter into tiny cubes and distribute them evenly! I might also add a bit more almond extract. That flavor did not come through very strongly. Do use sourdough ... it's great in this.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except increased almond extract to 1 tsp.  Generously sprinkled almonds before baking.  Baked uncovered for about an hour.  Did not need to top with any syrup or powdered sugar.  It was plenty sweet.  Did not find the pears to be lacking.  Used one 28-oz. can and it was plenty.  Made a big 13x9 pan full.  Hopefully the leftovers will reheat ok.
