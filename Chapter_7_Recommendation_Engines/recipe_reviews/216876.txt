Lovely recipe and we all enjoyed it. I followed the recipe and my family loved the different textures with the soft biscuits, perfectly cooked vegetables and creamy sauce. This is a very hearty dish. I seasoned with salt and pepper through all the steps and used the full TBS of tarragon. The one comment that was consistent with everyone was that it was a little bland with the minimal seasonings and herbs. I have added this to our "Sunday Dinner" rotation and will tweak it a little with more seasonings. Thanks for sharing!

This is very good! Thank you. The sauce was very thin so I needed to add flour.  No amount is given for the salt and pepper. I found that I needed to add more of each in the end.

While I love tarragon I don't think it worked in the recipe. And it would have been better to not use it.
