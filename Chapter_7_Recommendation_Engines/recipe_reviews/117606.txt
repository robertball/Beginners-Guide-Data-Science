I doubled this recipe because I have two men in the house and they both love cake.  I also added 1tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon and instead of buttermilk (I didn't have any), I used regular 1% milk.  I added a struesel to the top and cooked it for 50 minutes instead.  I turned out fantastic!!!!!  Will definately use this one again.

This coffee cake is so good!  Very moist. I have made it twice now and both times I added cinnamon to it.  The second time I made a streusel topping for it and that just made it even more delicious.

This was good for a basic coffee cake recipe; it has a very strong nutmeg flavor which I personally wasn't crazy for. Although if you added a little cinnamon maybe that would balance it out.

This was very good.  The texture was perfect.  I really liked the nutmeg taste.  However, I guess I like there to be something more--perhaps another spice, or some nuts.  Then again, some of the best things are the simplest.  I served this plain, with heavy whipping cream poured over it and once with a banana caramel sauce.  All times it was very yummy!

This is the only thing I've baked that my family has devoured completely. It needs no changes. The best thing about this delicious coffee cake is that it's so easy to make, it requires ingredients that you would usually find in any kitchen so you can make it anytime! And I will be making again. :)

This is a light tender cake with a great flavor.  I just made a few changes.  I added 1 t of vanilla, 1/2 t salt, and I added a streusel.  I then doubled the recipe and baked it as a bundt but I wouldn't recommend that.  The cake was too light and it falls apart but it's delicious so who really cares!  Thanks for this - I had buttermilk to use up and this fit the bill nicely.

Our family thought this had too much nutmeg the first time I made it. The second time I made it, I used about 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg in the cake and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon with a dash of ground decorticated cardamom.  It was delicious!

Basically, this was a good cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, next time I will cut the amount of nutmeg, it was overwhelming to me.  And like other reviewers, I will probably add some cinnamon also.

It turned out decent but I wasn't a huge fan of it. I may be partial because I really enjoy the cinnamon streusel type of coffee cake and this didn't have one. I would definitely add one were I to make it again.

Very nice simple recipe.  I would add cinnamon next time, but I had none which is why I made this recipe in the first place.

This was very good! My 12 yr old daughter made this for us tonight, she followed the recipe except when it came to the butter, she used fleischmann's original butter sticks, we have been trying to cut down on fat and calories.  I only wished that it gave the nurtitional value with the recipe, however, We will def make this again.  Loved the nutmeg flavor!!!

Just made this for Father's Day breakfast. I added a handful of blueberries and a streusel topping. I don't imagine that it needed it as the batter was delicious all on it's own. To personalize it for my hubby those had to be added. I can't wait to try it again without my tweaks. Awesome recipe.
