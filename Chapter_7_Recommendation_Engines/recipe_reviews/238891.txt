Loved it.  Since there are only two of us, and we are not big meat eaters, I reduced the meat to 1 lb of stew beef and 1/4 cup flour.  I also reduced to 1/2 packet of stew spices and added 1/2 packet brown gravy mix.  Only used 2 potatoes and 2 carrots and left the rest of ingredients the same.  Came out great and will make again.

This recipe turned out very good. I added a half pound extra beef and skipped step 3 and just added everything into the crock pot after sautéing the beef and onions. Everyone raved about this stew. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this! Only thing I added was a gravy pack! Made mashed potatoes instead. Thank you Bobbee! :)

I made it like the recipe called for except left out the celery. It was scrumptious! I would highly suggest making this.

I haven't written a review before because I usually make the recipe my own based on others reviews....that being said this is by far the best beef stew I have made!!!! The only thing I changed was I added mushrooms. Absolutely perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loved the flavor! Removed all fat, etc from beef. Left out the potatoes and Worcestershire sauce. Added 3 more of each celery stalks and carrots and a little water to the other liquids in the pan. Liquid cooked down so it was not soupy; which was the desired result. Served with biscuits. Yummy!

Followed the recipe to a tee except doubling the amount of celery. I am not sure this is for 10 servings, however. My wife and I finished it in two days. Best stew we have ever had!

Did not have celery or pkg seasoning mix. I used a package of Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix. Also, added 1/4 cup Marsala wine. This was the best stew we've ever had. The sweet Hungarian paprika I used just gave it a touch of sweetness needed. Awesome.

Made recipe as is except added some extra carrots and served with some crusty bread. Everyone loved it. My 5 yr old grandson commented "these are the best carrots I've ever eaten".

We loved it! This will be our go to beef stew recipe.  We followed the advice of adding a gravy pack and was very happy. Thank you!

Love it! Definitely the best beef stew I've ever made. I didn't make any changes except using baby carrots because I was crunched for time. The meat fell apart when eating like a good beef stew should. The flavor is rich and delightful. Served with crusty bread. Delicious :)

I thought this was very tasty and, like any slow cooker beef recipe, fork-tender.  I will make it again, but I will decrease the pepper to 1/4 tsp as the 1/2 tsp was just a bit too peppery for me.  I will also use whole baby carrots and maybe add frozen peas.  It needed a green vegetable. Very good though.

Very good.  Delicious.  I pretty much went by the recipe.  I added one onion to the beef mixture and another one when I put everything in.  A bit more garlic for my taste

I added a 1/4 tsp of whole black peppercorns and some green beans and only used one bay leaf.  Any of the flour mixture that was left over in the bag got poured into slow cooker. Really really excellent beef stew, full of flavor but not overpowered with spices. Will make again!

Major awesome!! My husband said it is by far the best beef stew ever. I followed the recipe exactly but cooked in in the crock-pot. Amazing flavor. Just right thickness. Only problem was I should have doubled it as it disappeared way too quickly.Tasted even better day two with the little left.

Great stew! I've made it 3 times now and my family always looks forward to it! 

I double everything and add mushrooms. I don't brown the meat first and leave out the wine as I typically don't have any.

Smelled wonderful while cooking - looked good too.  Neither hubby nor I could eat - think it was the 2 bay leaves or maybe the stores generic beef stew seasoning, not sure which.  Will try again though and leave out the bay leaves and use McCormicks seasoning.
