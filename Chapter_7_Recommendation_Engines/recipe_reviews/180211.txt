Fantastic! Could be a little sweeter though.  Maybe a little more sugar?

WOW!!!! My first attempt at making home made pickled beets....I pulled all the beets in my garden after the first freeze.....washed, cut about an inch above where the stems started then boiled whole for about 15 min. until I could pierce easily with a fork, cooled, then rubbed the skins off. Cut stem ends off and added the boiled vinegar, sugar and water and poured over the beets (mostly whole, some halved) and some hard boiled eggs, along with some salt and pepper and a few whole peppercorns. I also added a few cups of the beet water that I boiled the beets in. DELISH!!! I hope for great beet harvests every year and I will can these in pints with my pressure canner! (Minus the hard boiled eggs :)

These are so good! I used fresh beets that I peeled and sliced and also added sliced onion at the end. Just what I was looking for! I can't wait to make them again and again!

This is a perfect ratio of sugar, vinegar and water. Boil mixture for a few minutes, add some cinnamon and add to  boiled sliced beets and it will keep in fridge for as long as you can keep from eating them!

So easy and everyone loved it in a salad with some goat cheese on a bed of baby arugula.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I was inspired to try and recreate a Roasted Beet Salad from my favorite local pizza restaurant. I tried the Roasted Beet, Peach and Goat Cheese Salad here on All Recipes by Megancake using plain roasted beets and it just didn’t have that wow factor I was craving. I found this recipe for pickled beets and wow!  Amazing!  It was just what I was looking for!  I used the already prepared beets from the refrigerator section at Trader Joe’s and it made this recipe so simple!  If you haven’t tried these beets in a salad, I highly recommend you give them a try!  I served them in a salad for a dinner party and got rave reviews!

I roasted fresh beets and made the pickling liquid according to this recipe.  I sliced the beets and poured the hot liquid over them. I didn't wait the full 12 hours.  The beets are so delicious.   So much better than any pickled beets I've ever bought.  Wish I had made more --they disappear so fast.  Will definitely do it again.

These beets are great and easy!  I use fresh cooked beets and add about a tablespoon of dill to the brine one time.  Another time I added cinnamon as suggested and onions.  Very adaptable to different spices.  An easy side dish for company.  I also eliminated the salt as my husband is on a low sodium diet.

I have a ton of beets this year, and have been in quest for the best pickled beet recipe.  THIS IS IT FOLKS!!!
I tried 4 different recipes last night and found this one out shone all the others by miles. There is nothing special about the recipe, but that is what makes it so good. It is just an honest pickled beet recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and the perfect amount of sourness without masking the true flavor of the BEET. After all, that is what we want to taste, is the beet. Thank you for this recipe!
