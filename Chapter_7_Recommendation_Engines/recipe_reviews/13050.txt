this soup was delicious and easy. it came out a little thick and salty so i added two more cups of milk and a cup of water. i also added potatoes, celery, and onions into it. but you should boil the veges first before putting them in. i didn't know so i just stuck in raw veges so i had to constantly stir while it softened up. i will definitely make it again.

Great for when you don't have that can of soup on hand.  Plus I feel like I'm not getting all those artificial ingredients, preservatives, etc. in the can.

I made this for a group event and it was loved by all.  I added the baked potatoes and bacon.  I found I needed a lot more milk for a less thick soup.  I used 1% milk and everyone still thought it was made with cream.

Delicious and easy!!! I am living in Austria right now on a foreign exchange program, and I wanted to make a meal for my host family, and one of the ingredients was a can of cream of celery soup. Unfortunately I learned Austria doesnt have any canned soup! Luckily I found this wonderful recipe, and just added pureed celery. My dish turned out even more delicious than when I used the can soup. I would recommend this recipe to anybody, it is quick, simple, delicious, and amazingly versatile!!!

Thank you SO MUCH for this! I was ready to make PoppySeed Chicken and realized I was out of cream soup!  I remembered seeing this recipe long ago--searched, and THERE IT WAS! I will never BUY cream soup again--this is SO MUCH BETTER!

A trick I learned at a gourmet restaraunt I worked at, Vodka. If you add a little vodka to your cream soups it adds a wonderful richness, like wine does to marinara sauce.

Wow, this was awesome. I usually use beef flavoring. I've used this as a sauce in Shepherd's pie and on pizza (Egg Breakfast Pizza from this site). It was awesome! It's good by itself too. Sometimes I'll add a veggie soup mix I get from the bulk spice aisle (it's just tiny dried veggies and some seasoning). Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious.  I used 1% milk and it was very creamy and perfectly rich.  I created a "Mexican" theme with the following: 

*1 can Rotel Mexican diced tomatoes w/ lime juice and cilantro (with liquid)
*1/2 of an 8.75 oz can golden corn (drain before adding to soup)
*1/4 of a 4 oz can Ortega diced jalapenos (more or less depending on how hot you prefer)
*1 2.25 oz can sliced black olives (with liquid)

This is just amazing. I've been using this for a couple of years now. I like the ratio here much better. This is my go to recipe for cream soups when recipes call for it. The only problem though is that this makes 2 cups, and a condensed soup can is only 1 1/4 cups. I managed to modify it to make exactly 1 1/4 cups and it does work just fine. Also I use sodium free bouillon so we have no salt in it whatsoever. In which case I disagree with Aneehs' assessment of it being too salty. Had she used sodium free, then it would have been fine AND the amount called for even with the salt is exactly correct. One cube per each cup of liquid is the proper amount. Either way, I use it all the time now and it only takes about 5 minutes or so. To make another short cut, I have made several batches of these and put them in the freezer. They reheat well enough. Sometimes (not always) the milk separates but when you taste it it's fine. It's just not company worthy or for eaters who have to have it look perfect. Anyway, many thanks to Nell for sharing this perfect no-fail recipe!

SPECTACULAR!!!  To avoid lumps, I divided the milk, heating half of it with the butter, and mixing the other half with the flour.  I then added the milk/flour mixture to the hot liquid.

This recipe is okay, but is much tastier if you saute finely diced celery, carrots and leek, before adding the flour to make the roux.  I also add a little bit of crushed garlic with the flour so not to burn it.  This allows you to omit the chicken stock, which can be full of nasty stuff too.  If you do add the chicken stock, and do not have time to make your own, read labels carefully, they are not all created equally.

This is a great base for so many soups. My favorite; cut back on the milk a bit and add sauteed onions, a good stout beer and shredded gouda!

This is a great recipe to have on hand when you need a cream of ____ soup and don't have any on hand.  I halved the recipe, which made about the same amount that a 10.5 oz. can of soup would contain.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great base that I have used for adding leftover vegetables or whatever I had on hand to it to "recycle" meals we wouldn't eat otherwise. ("Recycle" sounds so gross when talking about dinner!) I added my leftovers Cajun Chicken Pasta (also on AllRecipes) we weren't going to eat and made Cajun Chicken Noodle Soup. Possibilities are endless! :)

Amazingly great!  I used "Better than Boullion" seafood paste when I bought this beautiful geoduck clam.  (Think of a HUGE clam that has majorly out-grown its shell with a five-foot neck!)  Made about three gallons of clam chowder (kid you not!)  Well, it weighed over five pounds!  Unfortunately, it still didn't last for more than a few days.  I ended up having to quadruple the recipe, but it was perfect!  My immersion hand blender pulverized any possible lumps.  And I did brown my butter a bit prior to making the roux -- but we Slovaks will use brown butter in almost anything.

Halved the recipe. I used margarine (gasp! I know, but butter is expensive). I used cup of cooking cream diluted a but with water and the rest soy milk. Seasoned with garlic and onion powders along with the pepper. It came out a little too salty for us. I added a sachet of "Fish Tea" soup (it was lying at the pack of the cupboard begging to be used). I used this in "Martha's Cornbread Dressing" from AR. I would use this again as a base, but maybe only half a cube.

Made this today for our lunch today.  Fantastic starter recipe.  I made potato soup and I would recommend using real butter and letting it brown a little before adding the flour then saute a little onion and garlic before adding the milk.  The base was a little thick but instead of adding additional milk I actually added some chicken stock from leftover chicken and noodles the day before.  Everytime I added more liquid it would be 1/2C at a time with 1/2 cup stock then 1/2 cup milk.  I also recommend seasoning your potato soup with a little basil and topping with cheddar and bacon...VERY GOOD!  THANKS!

Thank you so much for posting this! I can no longer eat anything with MSG in it due to health problems that it caused me so didn't know what I was going to do about my pot roast and my Broccoli and Rice Casserole that I always make (since the can stuff has MSG in it)!  I made this, sauteed my mushrooms and problem solved and way better than the canned stuff.  For those stating is was too thick, its suppose to be, its a cream base, although you can add more milk to make it the consistency you want it.  Again Thanks so much you solved a big problem for me!!

All I can say to this recipe is wow. I'm a beginner cook and before trying this I was a huge fan of eating soup out of cans. Now that I've made the real thing I'm hooked, and my family is hooked too. After making it everyone had second helpings. I cooked with Whole Wheat flour and added 2 and 1/2 cups of milk as well as two more tablespoons of butter. I also added mashed potatoes, onions, green peppers and broccolli. I'm telling you the end result of this soup base recipe puts even resturant quality soup to shame!

This soup is a great base for any creamed soup. Last night it was Potato Soup. YUMMY! One person had three bowls of yummy soup! I look forward to making cheese soup...maybe even beer cheese soup. Watch the balance between butter, flour and liquid to determine the thickness of the soup. Thank you for a great soup base.>

We loved this. I made Cream Of Vegetable Soup. I boiled 8oz bag of frozen vegetable and while that was cooking I melted the butter and sauteed half of an onion chopped before adding the flour. After making base I added the Vegetables. Was very thick so I kept adding water from the vegetables until thick as I liked. I think next time I will try creammy onion or creammy garlic.

This was excellent. I added a little thyme, 1 1/2 lbs fresh, lightly steamed asparagus, a bunch of sliced leeks,  two small leftover baked potatoes (diced) and a large handful of torn baby spinach. It was pretty much whatever I could find in the fridge that *might* work. I added an extra cup of milk to stretch the soup a little further and added a tiny bit of cornstarch/water slurry to help thicken it back up and used a chicken soup base rather than granules or bouillon cubes. I served it with whole-grain grilled cheese sandwiches. The creaminess of the soup complimented the course texture of the sandwiches. It came together nicely. We'll definitely do this again and also will try it as a broccoli cheese soup. This a very versatile recipe and will remain in my rotation...especially as the weather cools down!

This is quite thick which is what I wanted for my mini chicken pot pie filling.  I made half a recipe which is pretty much equal to one can of cream of "whatever" soup.  I kept the ratio of butter to flour equal.  I added finely diced celery and onion to the butter.  Then I added the flour seasoned with garlic powder and poultry seasoning.  After I made the roux, I thinned it out to the consistency I was going for.  For those complaining about the thickness, this recipe is exactly what the author intended it to be - a soup base.  You can add more milk, seasonings, meat, vegetables or herbs to make it to your liking.  It is outstanding!

I just made this to use in "southwest white chicken chili" found on this site. I haven't made the chili yet, but I wanted to say this soup base is going to be used in many of my recipes. It is a great base to use for many soups and casseroles! Thanks for a great alternative to canned soup. Oh, almost forgot to mention, I read the ingredients of a can of cream of chicken and it had garlic and onion powder, so I added a little sprinkle of each. Delicious!

Excellent!!  A very easy and versatile recipe.  The only change I made was to add a bit of garlic powder (but I'm a huge garlic lover), and some left over broccoli and carrots that I finely crushed.  Delicious!!  This will be a regular feature at our home!

I made this soup using canned milk diluted 1:1 with water instead of regular milk. To the base I added the recommended cheese and steamed broccolli but the potato sounded great too so I added canned potatoes. I also tossed in some canned beef I had sitting in the pantry removing as much of the fat as possible. I thought this would be a good soup from all the reviews but I was wrong. It was AWESOME! My husband and kids at it like ravenous wolves. Definitely the best cream base soup I have ever tasted! This recipe is going straight in my recipe box! I can't wait for lunch tomorrow! Leftovers!

Simple, quick, and easy cream soup base. Using milk rather than water really does make a difference. The only thing that can be a bit of a hassle is I tend to find butter-flour lumps after I add the milk sometimes, so don't be afraid to mix well, whisk, or even blend the whole thing in a food processor. I've made this often with frozen spinach and cheese, and once or twice with bacon/ham. I'd love to try tomato or broccoli also.

Thank you, thank you Nell Marsh! Gone are the days of me using those horrible for you cream of whatever canned soups. So easy, SO good. I made just plain cream of chicken today, but I can't wait to make other variations! I made two versions of this... one batch I made exactly as written. Really tasty, nice and thick. It just seemed like an awful lot of butter and flour for the roux, so I made another batch cutting the butter down to 1/4 cup and 3 tablespoons of flour. Just as good! Perfect consistency! I used 1% milk in both batches, as well. Thank you so much! :)

Excellent recipe! I made substitutions for my diet, but did not alter the flavor. This is a keeper & has my creative cooking juices flowing for other uses. Mahalo for sharing this! (Used Smart Balance, low-fat/low-sodium chicken broth, and unsweetened almond milk)

This makes a tasty soup - I am living a lo-carb lifestyle so I usually use broccoli and cheese or asparagus and bacon (with a bit of parmesan). For those inquiring about making this recipe minus the flour to keep carbs down, a good product for thickening is "Dixie Diners Carb Counters Thick It Up Low Carb Thickener"  available at netrition.com, which incidentally is an EXCELLENT site for lo-carbers!!

you should never use black pepper in soups. Always use white. You can't see it in cream soups and it doesn't just sink to the bottom in broth soups otherwise this is a standard base

LOVE this one.  You would think that it was made with cream, it is that rich and tasty.  I added a 10 ounce package of chopped broccoli that I steamed and Cooper cheese, about 3 slices.  Hubby went back for seconds.  What I like best about this recipe is that all the ingredients are a staple in most kitchens and I didn't have to go out and buy anything special, although I did substitute chicken granuales for the cubes - it is my preference to the cubes.  GREAT JOB NELL!!  :-)

I'll be redundant here and simply follow other comments - outstanding! For ease and simplicity of preparation (not to mention taste), this tops all other cream soup bases I've tried.  I used 1 cup chicken stock, 1 cup milk, and added steamed asparagus for my first try.  Pureed apx 1/3rd of batch for added flavor.  Can't wait to try other veggies.  TY so very much for recipe.

I was making a slow cooker recipe from this site (roast beef with gravy) and realized much too late that I was out of cream soup of any kind. I decided to give this recipe a try and create my own. I followed the recipe exactly, but I needed it to be cream of mushroom. While the soup was cooking, I chopped up two large mushrooms pretty fine, and cooked them in a small saucepan with a little butter. When the soup was done, I added these cooked mushrooms, and it was perfect! The only problem I had with this soup was that it was pretty salty...next time I make it, I'll probably either use unsalted butter or add only 1 cube of bullion. This made about two can's worth of cream soup. Thanks for sharing! I am so excited to make my own cream soup...the stuff from the store is not exactly healthy or cheap, and this is both cheap and relatively healthy. :) Thanks again...I'll be making this again!!!

Personally I always try to use country gravy mix as my soup base, we purchase it and bulk, it always works perfectly for all cream soups and eliminates the milk. If I feel it is not creamy enough I just add some heavy cream just before serving.

EXCELLENT!  I precooked potato with chopped onion.  Added to the pot with a can of chopped clams.  Very good.  Satisfied a picky husband.  I noticed though that you need to cook for a good 20 minutes before serving or it tasted a bit chalky...Can't wait to use again!

This is a great base for any number of cream soups.  Just add left over veggies, canned veggies, etc.  You are only limited by your imagination.  I sauteed' onion, garlic and celery and added to the basic soup.  Microwaved several potatoes and mixed those in.  I added more milk for consistency, but it was wonderful.

Oh my, thanks for posting this recipe! So handy to be able to whip this up at a moment's notice with simple ingredients and no nasty preservatives, whether to substitute for a can of something else or as the base to a soup of your choosing. So tasty. Add this to your online recipe box-- you'll be glad you did!

This is a good substitute for canned cream soups, which my hubby doesn't like.  I also don't like using chicken bouillon, so I use half milk and half chicken broth.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for future use!  Thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous. Used it because I didn't have cream of chicken soup. It tastes great. I did add garlic, personal preference. Thanks for a great recipe.  The way I calculate it, I use a full recipe if I need 2 cans of cream of condensed - soups.  Works great.

Only giving a four because it's way too fattening as is, goodness gracious, it takes a half-stick of butter! I used two tablespoons of butter and a 1/4 cup of white flour to 2.5 cup milk and still thought it a bit too thick, I'd like to try it with maybe 4 tsp of butter next time and see how it comes out like that. Despite the richness of the original recipe it still is a wonderful base for a soup. I've made it with broccoli and some leftover mashed potatoes and loved that, and tonight we used mushrooms and corn. I'd like to try it with shrimp or clams and potatoes, should be yummy like that too.

This was a FANTASTIC base, the addition of the chicken boullion made it delicious.  I will use this for all my future cream soups.  This time I added:  2 chopped up baked potatoes, some dried onion (at the beginning with the flour), some crumbled bacon and a couple scoops of sour cream.  We topped it with cheese and chives.

I tossed in all the leftovers from last nights roasted chicken/carrot/potato/onion dinner, and it was delish. Had to add more liquid as I went along (not all milk) and it didn't take away from the creaminess at all. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent flavor just eaten as recipe is. Lots of potential for creating your own cream soups.  Next I will add potatoes, bacon and chives.  The best cream soup base I have found.

I used this as a base for cheesy broccoli soup. It was WONDERFUL!! I did take the advice of others and used 4c. of milk. Thank you for the base recipe, will definitely be using it from this point forward.

I had tried a cream of turkey soup from this site twice before with terrible results.  The consistency and taste were never right no matter what I did.  Using this as a base was exactly what I needed to get the flavor, color, and consistency just right.  I added some turkey stock (fresh-made from a couple of carcasses I had), turkey meat, diced carrots, celery and a few other seasonings to this base and it came out so great.  What's better is I messed up and added too much turkey stock at first, but this lent itself to "correction" very well whereas that other recipe did not.  To fix, I took some of the soup into a bowl, thickened it with some flour and returned it to the pot.  Consistency corrected without taking anything away from the flavor.   This will be the base I use for all my creamy soups from now on. It erally is just perfect.

This recipe is fantastic. I use powder instead of boullion, and depending on the recipe use chicken, beef or veggie powder. You will never have to open another can of cream soup again!

I used this recipe to make cheesy broccoli soup for a group of 40 people and it was such a HUGE hit!  I usually shy away from cream soups because I am sure it will be difficult- but NOT ANY MORE!  It was so easy and many asked me for the recipe.  I made the recipe as described - I steamed some broccoli I had in the freezer from our summer garden and when it was steamed I dumped the broccoli and the water in and stired until blended.  I also added slices of american cheese- they melted right in.  PERFECT!  Thanks for making me a star to my friends!!!

Fast, good, and easy. I use this base for my cream of corn soup, and it is no-fail.  I use cayenne in mine as well as sea salt and black pepper.  It's also wonderful as a vegetarian dish using vegetable bouillon and vegetable broth.

I made the best cream of potato soup using this recipe. Very easy to follow, impossible to mess up and tastes great! I recommend adding cooked bacon to it just as your serving it because the first time I made it, I added the bacon to the soup and the bacon got soggy.

Very easy and very tasty. I made mine into potato soup by just adding a diced potato I cooked in the microwave, some bacon, cheddar cheese, and a little bit of sour cream. This is a very good recipe.

Although I used a 1:1 ratio of flour and butter, I really do like using this recipe as a base for cream soup. If anyone has a complaint about how the recipe does not call for much seasoning, simply add other spices to it. The recipe itself is versatile, so use your imagination and customize it to your liking.

Love this! I changed it up a bit...used 1/3 butter, 4 T flour, and skim milk and it was perfect!! I was just looking for something quick to make for dinner and this was perfect. After I prepared the base, I added 1 c sweet corn, 1/2 broccoli, and a little bit of chopped up cooked chicken...delicious!

I made one of my own recipes and did not have the cream of chicken soup so I made this and used it instead. It worked out perfectly. I did not have boullion cubes so I used a teaspoon of the HerbOx chicken instant bouillon granuals for each cube instead. My family loved it.

Wonderful!!! I've also been looking for a cream soup base ever since I went to a tea room where they served Creamed Vegetable Soup. It was a cream base then they chopped all of the veggies, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, very finely-probably in a food processor. Thanks!

This recipe was easy and quick.  I added 4 fresh heads of steamed, chopped broccoli along with sharp cheddar cheese (about 3 cups).  I had to add about 2 more cups of milk due to the large amount of broccoli, but in the end, it was awesome.  The family gobbled it up!  I will use this base for all my cream soups!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I doubled this recipe and added 4 cups of fresh mushrooms cooked with 1 onion in chicken broth.  I did end up using an extra cup of milk plus some of the liquid from my mushrooms & onion.  It's all a matter of personal choice of how thick you want the roux.  The end result was just amazing.  Thanks for sharing!!

I always have a hard time getting cream soup to thicken.  Not with this recipe, it is so simple and tasty!!!  I turned it into clam chowder by adding onion, celery, clams, potato, and hot sauce.

I used this recipe using organic ingredients for a casserole that called for cream of chicken soup. It was very easy to make. I used all things that I already had on hand. A can of organic soup can sometimes cost as much as $3. I am so happy to have found this!

I was amazed how good this tasted plain!  I used this as a base for creamed spinach, using low fat everything and it turned out awesome!

This was just what I was looking for.  It's very versatile.  I made a cream of vegetable soup for the first try and am looking forward to trying the many variations this base allows.  Thanks so much!

It's very, very thick so you have to add lots of extra liquid.  Also very salty so I would decrease the bouillon and taste before adding more - or maybe use chicken broth instead.  I made cream of asparagus soup and added all the liquid from the can - besides being to salty, it had a good asparagus taste.

Awesome base! I forgot to buy cream soup at the grocery store and I needed it for a casserole so I gave this a try. I actually used three bullion cubes because I like the extra flavor and it turned out AMAZING! Thank you so much!

This stuff is phenomenol! Don't ever buy canned "cream of..." soups anymore. This replaces that and is SO much better tasting. I combined about a cup of cream soup base with some leftover egg noodles, cooked chicken, and sauted mushrooms in a small casserole, topped it off w/ some grated cheddar cheese & baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Mmmmmm! I still have a cup of cream soup base left and will use it instead of cream of mushroom soup in Chicken Spaghetti.

The sodium content of this recipe is astromonical.  436 mg sodium according to the info here, but that's very misleading, as that's for only 1/4 cup of broth... 2 cups liquid and EIGHT servings...

I absolute LOVE this soup base!!! It even helped me make a better version of a local diner favorite soup - cream of pepperoni - than the diner makes! Also make a great cream of broccoli soup! I use a little less flour than it calls for though so it's not as thick.

Great base recipe - I've used it to make cream of chicken soup and I'm sure it would be terrific with other additions.  The claim of making 8 servings seems inaccurate, but it really depends on what other ingredients you add.  Even though I have always added more milk, it hasn't been nearly 8 servings with just chicken, but some bulky veggies might bring it closer to 8 servings.  I also add spices and salt, which significantly improve the flavor, but since this is just a base recipe for unknown additional ingredients, it can't really predict what additional seasonings will work.

I had been previously using a recipe that called for milk and flour mixed together to thicken the broth. It tasted very pasty. This recipe is 100x better and will be my new go to recipe. I use cream soups constantly in my homemade pot pies. Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Very versatile.

WOW! This came in handy when I was making a casserole and was one can short of cream of chicken soup.  I made this in a jiffy and wished I would have not used canned at all in my casserole and made more of this.  While I am sure it's not the healthiest of soups, atleast I know the ingredients in it and always have them on hand in my kitchen.  I can't wait to try different variations of this soup. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe...I will never go back to canned soup again!!!

Love this! I used it as a base in Broccoli and Cheese soup. The only thing I added at the beginning was some chopped onion to the butter. Let it cook for a couple min. and followed the recipe. When soup was thick, I added steamed broccoli and shredded cheddar cheese. Thinned it out with some extra milk.

I used this base to make my first ever cream soup tonight.  I'm thrilled with how easy it was - I was trying to replicate a Southwestern chicken pepper jack soup that I enjoyed years ago, and am quite pleased with the results.  I knew the flavors I wanted to incorporate, but have never before made a roux.  Amazingly easy, now that I know. Thanks!

This is the base I use for all my cream soups. I always use 4 C of skim milk for my favorite thickness. 
I add:
1-2 lbs of cut boiled potatoes and corn
1 lb of cooked frozen broccoli
1 lb of frozen chopped spinach
1 (28oz) can of diced tomatoes (simmered)

This was great!  I used 1% milk and used about 1 cup of white zinfandel I needed to use up.  I also cubed 3 large potatoes and stirred in 1 cup of shredded velveeta.  Served it topped with crumbled bacon bits and shredded cheese.  It was SOOOO good!

As a BASE this is very good.  I have used it to make cream of broccoli, "baked potato" soup, etc.  However, with heartier soups (i.e. baked potato) it is thick and wonderful.  I thin it out for more delicate soups such as cream of mushroom, cream of broccoli.  Add whatever you like and you have a great soup.

I was able to use skim milk for this, drastically lowering the fat of the base.  To cut the saltiness that many people pointed out, I used 2 tsp Low-Sodium Chicken soup base.  I now no longer by canned cream base soups as this far better tasting than them.  Just add any flavorful leftovers and you have stellar cream based soups in nearly the same time as heating up a can and far better taste.

I feel bad giving this a poor rating but this was way too thick.  Six tablespoons of flour is a too much for the amount of liquid.  It was more like a gravy than soup.  I had to add an additional 2 cups of water to thin it out.  And what about any type of herbs or spices?  I have another recipe for "Cream of whatever kind of Vegetable" soup that I will continue to use.  Sorry!

Although I cook often and love making soups, this was my first try at a cream soup. 

Wow.

It was so easy to prepare and took no time at all!

I added steamed broccoli and some shredded cheese, and my family offered rave reviews. I can't wait to try it with potatoes.

This was a great solution to pork chops with no canned cream soup!  I doubled the recipe and it covered a 9X13 pan full of pork chops, and they were SOOO tender after 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees.

Although not mentioned, I'm sure this recipe is meant to be used in place of an UNDILUTED can of creamed soup! Follow your recipes as if you are using a can of UNDILUTED creamed soup, and if called for, dilute as instructed in the recipe you're making! Lets say you're making cream of broccoli soup; steam the broccoli and add to the creamed soup base. Then add milk or water, as you would if you opened a can of creamed soup.

This recipe was great!  I was making a dish from another recipe on this site that called for cream of chicken soup (which I did not have on hand).  It turned out great!  Will definitely try other versions (ie cream of mushroom/cream of celery) of this recipe in the future!

LOVE this basic recipe that is SO versatile!  Here is how I made baked potato soup using left over baked potatoes:  Since I didn't have any flour on hand, I used corn starch instead.  I haven't read many other reviews, but generally someone complains about a 'flour' taste. For those who don't know, flour has to 'brown' after being added to the melted butter (or pan drippings, if making gravy.) Otherwise you end up with a raw flour taste.  I followed the recipe above BUT did not use the bouillon cubes but then added 4 baked potatoes that I had peeled and diced. Since the soup was thicker than I preferred, I then added another cup of milk.  I added salt and pepper, heated until the potatoes were warmed through, and then stirred in approx 1 C. sour cream and warmed a little more. Each serving was topped with grated cheese.  Chives and real bacon bits were available for those who wanted them.  Simple potato soup is our 'go-to' dish when not feeling well, so the somewhat bland potato soup fills the bill. Otherwise, add the chives and bacon before adding potatoes to the butter/flour mixture. And I agree with another poster:  I prefer 'made from scratch' to the canned variety of soup.  I look forward to trying this recipe with different ingredients!  Thank you, Nell, for sharing!

I use this cream soup base as a sub for the cream of chicken soup in my chicken pie recipe.  Adding a splash of vodka really does make this soup taste richer.  Thanks for the great recipe Nell!

Great recipe and it truly is very versatile.  I added cut up cooked chicken breast and cooked white rice, and it turned out wonderful. Since we love leftovers, I doubled the recipe, but next time I may even triple it.

This recipe is great and easy to make!...  I am so happy that I can now make my home made cream bases and no longer need to use the MSG canned stuff!  Tonight I used this recipe to add to my delicious Quick Chicken Divan recipe... My husband liked it even more using this soup base!  Thank you so much!

i will never buy canned again! i ran out of milk and had to use a fourth of what was called for. it came out perfect. i cooked 1 rib of celery in the butter before adding anything else to cook it through so it wasn't crunchy and bring out the celery flavor fast. so good!!

this is a delicious soup base.  like other reviewers, i doubled the amount of milk.  i also added some chicken broth.  i did the baked potatoes, with chives and fried up my baked potatoes in some bacon grease instead of adding pieces of bacon.  it was delicious!  can't wait to try it with other veggies!

I made Roasted lemon and Herb Chicken by barbzal from this sight and needed a side dish. I wanted to make biscuits and the cream sauce from dumplings with vegetables on the side but didn't have any Cream of Chicken soup on hand. So I used this recipe as my base then I added one 16oz bag of cooked frozen California blend vegetables and 1/2 of a cup of the broth from the chicken. I then gradually added flour till I achived my desired thickness. It turned out so great and tasted just like chicken and dumplings. Thank you for sharing this recipe it is for sure going in my recipe box as a keeper.

This is a great base for a soup.  I did not add the chicken bouillon because I was adding fresh Gulf scallops. I added fresh flat leaf parsley, 1/4 of a jalapeno, green onion and the fresh scallops.  It was a fast and delicious lunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've used this recipe over and over again.  It's the base for so many of my soups.  It's wonderful, creamy and thick... just the way I like my soups.

This recipe was delicious! I was in a hurry to get a lunch going, and there really wasn't much to eat at home. Luckily I found this quick and simple recipe and I just added a little leftover salmon into the soup and it turned out just great! I give it a 4 star rating just because it was a little too thick: not even an additional two cups of milk was enough. But I will definitely use this recipe again!

Easy to prepare. Love it. I used margarine, low fat milk and chicken stock with less salt. Added water in the end. Keep stirring to get the thickness desired. Thanks!

This was great. I made the based then added 2 cups of chicken broth. It was still creamy. I  cooked some minced onion,celery and carrots with thyme and added to base. I had some left over chicken about 2 cups and cooked  up a box of Uncle Bens wild rice. Added all together then had to add a little more milk. It was wicked good!!!

This is exactly what I needed, a simple cream soup base for scalloped potatoes. I didn't use the bouillon. I used garlic salt, pepper, and paprika instead. I didn't have milk, so I used 3 cups of original unsweetened almond milk. I used less than the recipe asked for because almond milk is thinner than regular milk. I've noticed when I use almond milk in place of regular milk that I need to use less of it, or else the dish gets runny.

Based on other reviews, I cut the butter to 1/4 stick and flour to 3 T. and it was perfect consistency. I added a little garlic salt and didn’t find it too salty. Used it as a substitute for cream of chicken soup.

I made this with Better Than Bouillon roasted beef base and it turned out AMAZING! No substitutions made at all, followed recipe exactly. Great cream soup base! I poured it over cubed steak in my crockpot with onion petals. Going to be a fabulous supper!

This was awesome! I also had to add extra milk. But this was still a great starter soup. I made it again, but used 2 cans of evaporated milk plus 3 cans of water and used it for the base of chicken and dumplings. It was excellent!

While making a beef pot pie I realized I needed a cream base so I made this one, its easy and so good! I added some of the powdered beef stew mix leftover from the ingredients for the pie filling which made it even more delicious, it gave the beef pot pie a rich creaminess.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I often make what I call refrigerator soup. I make a soup base and add leftovers and last day veggies to the pot. My kids love refrigerator soup. It's never the same and always tastes great. Tonight I had leftover salmon fillets, roasted potatoes and Normandy blend veggies. I added my leftovers, some frozen corn, plenty of pepper and some old bay seasoning to this soup base with a cup of milk and a cup of water. This made a delicious fish chowder. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

Thank you for posting this, I've been using it for a couple years now and haven't bought canned soup for recipes since the day I found this recipe.  Obviously a little more work than opening a can but better for you and tastes SO much better, plus it's actually pretty easy and quick.  Plus versatile.  Love it!

It takes a LOT for me to sit down and write a recipe review, but when I do, it's because it's OUTSTANDING, and this recipe from Nell is one.  I was kvetching about what to do with all the leftovers I had from a Superbowl Mexican 7-layer dip.  It occurred to me that I might be able to make a soup with it, but I didn't know where to start.  Found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. I used 2t of the "Better Than Bouillon" paste as a substitute for the cubes, which I prefer.  Cooked the flour and butter a few minutes on low heat to get rid of that raw flour taste before I added the milk. Once done, I tossed in a can of green chiles, my leftover ground beef seasoned taco meat, about 6 super-heaping tablespoons of homemade salsa (recipe from The Pioneer Woman), and also about 10 slices of chopped cooked turkey bacon (which I chopped in the food processor) I had from another recipe.  I also added another cup of milk which it really needed. Unbelievably delicious.  Restaurant quality. Nell, you made me look like a genius today, and I will use your recipe often.  Thanks!

I'm reviewing this for others with allergies to milk.  We thought it was quite tasty and will make it again. 
Due to my granddaughter having milk allergies and carrots her favorite  Campbell soup was out so we tried this. 
We used coconut milk, and soy free  butter, real chicken broth.  I used 1 cup broth in place of 1 bouillon cube (1 for 1).   Added a little chopped chicken. She loved it!  Another substitute milk may work as well but coconut was our best option. 
I definitely will try adding mushrooms next time.  Different than canned but very tasty. I can see a lot of possibilities with this. Thanks.

Add a bunch of Parmesan and garlic/typical Italian spices and once it's thickened, it makes a fantastic Alfredo sauce!

We love cream soups but since I'm a lousy cook, we usually get "in the can".  I thought I'd give this recipe a shot.  I left out the bouillon cubes and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Otherwise, I followed the direction precisely.  After the base was made, I added cooked chicken pieces and herbs from the garden.  My husband rated it 5 stars and he is very picky.  I love knowing what goes into the food we eat.  Definitely will be making this again.

Half the flour, and  added much more milk& cream. As someone else suggested I sauted some finely chopped onion and a little garlic. I added Orzo, Rotisori chicken, a little fresh spinach and small diced carrots. Family says its great!

I will for sure make this again, I followed the recipe just like it says and in another pan I caramelized onions and garlic I added some potatoes and bacon into the onion and garlic.  I added those ingredients to the soup base it gave it such a delicious taste!  I also added 1/4 cup cooking sherry and sour cream 1/2 cup and it made it so cream and delicious! I also added in about a cup more of  milk as it gets thick .

This is my go-to soup recipe! I've used this recipe for years and I always get rave reviews. I normally add potatoes or broccoli. It's easy to make and tastes like I worked harder than I did!

Living in Spain means there isn't the availability of many tins of soups in flavours I like so I made this cream soup base to use in a Chicken Divan.  I made it with mushrooms sautéed in butter and it was out of this world.  After so many 'taste tests' to check that I really did like it, I almost didn't have enough for the Divan.  I'm sure it would be nice with other flavours but I don't know that I'd be able to resist just doing mushroom everytime.  Great recipe.

One comment about quantities though - I didn't want 8 servings though so I halved the amounts but ended up still using about 2 cups of milk as it was extremely thick at first.

CAN BE MADE ALLERGY FRIENDLY! This recipe is easy, and very versatile! I have dairy issues, so I used coconut oil in place of butter, and almond milk instead of milk. It worked fine! Used it as a base for a delicious chicken-and-rice dish. I'll bet if you had gluten issues, arrowroot powder would work instead of flour, so long as you mixed the arrowroot in a little cold milk before adding it to the pot.

I just made this!  My father in law is severely lactose intolerant so green bean casserole at Thanksgiving has always been out of the question.  Our family has always used cream of chicken rather than mushroom so I substituted Lactaid milk and Nucoa margarine to the original recipe and added a couple of Tbsp. of finely minced chicken breast to the mixture.  It is great!! Thanks and he will thank you too next Thursday!

So so so good! Amazing! Just made this and this will now forever be my go-to soup recipe. Very easy and quick. I did have to add more milk, probably a total of six cups. And added about an 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper for added flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Great base thank you. I didn't have bouillon or stock but I sauteed onion and garlic and steamed up some carrots and asparagus, then I pureed the onion/garlic and carrots/asparagus and added it to the roux. I use skim milk in the recipe and I added sea salt and more skim milk at the end so that it wasn't so thick. I am going to make Chicken and Asparagus in Cream Soup(from this site) using your base.
Thanks Nell Marsh

I used Heavy Cream instead of milk and Canned Chicken Stock instead of Boulillon. It gives it a much richer texture and taste.

It was pretty good but it should have cooked a bit longer after adding milk, there was still a bit of grittiness. It would have received 5 stars if there had been more specific cook times.

I ended up adding about 2.5 cups more milk, simmered veggies and rice along with Cheddar and American cheese. It ended up being more of a casserole due to it's thickness caused by the rice but was very tasty.

oh my god this was too easy-and it's also easy to add pretty much anything you want. I added a leftover baked potato casserole to the base and made a potato soup! It was easy-everything was already in the potatoes.  As far as consistency I think it's all personal preference as we like our soups on the thick side.  All around wonderful recipe-thanks :)

good basic recipe! I added what I had in fridge - cauliflower, broccoli and carrots. I steamed them, then mashed them coarsely. I, too, reduced flour like other reviewers until it looked about the right consistency - I think I used a couple Tbls. I divided the mixture (without milk added) and froze it in 2-serving containers. To heat, put in saucepan and add milk til consistency you like (I added 1c for each 2-serving container.) Needs salt and pepper for sure - leave that for the individual to season!

I actually use this on a regular basis and I love how easy it is.  The reason for the 4 star rating is because I do reduce the amount of flour.  6tbs is too much for us and it ends up getting too thick.  Other than that...added our own seasonings depending on what kind of soup.  Delicious.  Thanks for the post.

This was an excellent soup base and my husband loved it.  Very creamy and easy to make.  I used chicken and corn in it but next time will try ham instead of chicken.
