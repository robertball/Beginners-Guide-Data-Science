This was really good. It tasted like a melted rootbeer float. Easy to make and less messy than a float. My daughter really liked hers. Thanks

I think this drink was good. I also found that adding coke or pepsi instead of rootbeer is good too. I have drank it with coke and chocolate eversince I was 5.

Growing up this was called a Brown cow not black....but I've had this in my recipe box for a year thought I remember drinking this as a kid....I took one sip and that was it. I don't ever remember drinking root beer in it...I believe it was Coke Cola and milk. However. I tried to pass it over to my kids without any qualms that I didn't like it and it didn't go over very well with them too. SO I'm sorry but it's not to our palates' likings.
