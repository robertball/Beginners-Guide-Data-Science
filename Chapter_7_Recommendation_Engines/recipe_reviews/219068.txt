I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the pastry and loved this.  Simple to do, nice for brown bag lunches.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This is a good recipe, but it's even better with the following changes: 1) Add cinnamon to the pastry. 2) Don't mash the apples up into a sauce, but just slice them thinly, and it tastes more authentic. 3) to the apple mixture, add the following spices: nutmeg, cloves, and a little more cinnamon. I would highly suggest adding the spices TO YOUR OWN TASTE. I love spices, so I will add a lot more. 3) Instead of using shortening in your pastry, use softened butter. Make sure the butter is still cool from the refrigerator, but able to stir. (By the way, I would suggest doing that ANY time you're making crusts and pastries). I hope you enjoy this recipe!

These turned out fantastic! I did half white sugar & half brown sugar, like other reviewers I also added cinnamon to the dough, and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar when they were finished. Quick and easy, with ingredients I always have on-hand! They were gone in minutes, and both my son & husband are asking when I'm going to make them again! Definitely a keeper!! Thank you so much!

I wanted some apple pie but i didn't want a whole pie because it only my husband and i.I found this recipe for fried apple pies..After reading the recipe i said that this would better than a whole pie. My husband loved them and he is not a big sweet eater...I am. The reason i rated 4 stars is because i am not good at making pie crust.So i used the frozen crust i keep on hand and i added one tablespoon of butter to the apples while they cooking.And i fried in peanut oil and i use cinnamon sugar to put on after they out of oil  They came out very very good. Thanks for the recipe. I know i will be making these again real soon.

Yummy little hand pies!  I added a little cinnamon to the dough as others did, and I used apple pie spice (made from this site) instead of just cinnamon.  As soon as I pulled them from the oil, I sprinkled them with turbinado sugar.  They were certainly ready before an hour's time, making them a fast little treat when you want apple pie.  I scaled the recipe down for my husband and I, which is nice because the 2 of us couldn't eat a whole baked apple pie.  Would make again!

These little pies are just wonderful. I was crunched for time so I used a ready made pie crust I already had in the fridge. I added a bit of nutmeg and sprinkled them with a sugar cinnamon mix when they came out of the oil. This recipe is fabulously versatile. I think I'll make something savory next. Thanks so much for sharing!
