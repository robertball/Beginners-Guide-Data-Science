I made mine with chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes. I also added some fresh spinach right at the end, really good.- LNP

I must admit, the first time someone suggested I try garlic soup, I thought it sounded awful. I tried it a few years ago at a tapas restaurant, and though it was delicious, I promptly forgot all about it. Recently a coworker brought a huge bag of peeled garlic into work that she was trying to get rid of (after purchasing way too much at Costco!). I brought home about 30 bulbs of peeled garlic not knowing what the heck I was going to do with it - then I remembered garlic soup. Came across this recipe, but I used chicken stock instead of bouillon, and tossed in all of the extra garlic I had. It was just wonderful. Reminded me exactly of the soup I had tasted at the expensive tapas restaurant....and cooks up in no time!

I really enjoyed this quick garlic soup. By cooking the garlic for a long time, the flavor mellows out instead of the strong garlic taste some people expect from garlic soup.   I added a small amount of thyme and rosemary to this with pepper and salt and it was fabulous. Thank you!

I made this soup yesterday to help get over the bug that’s been plaguing me.  It doesn’t look appetizing but it’s very good (however, I wasn’t hungry for a 2nd bowl immediately… it’s more of an appetizer).  I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups of vegetable brother (chicken broth shortage).  For those who called the soup bland, I don’t think they prepared the garlic right.  If it isn’t cut up enough, you won’t get the flavour out.  I crushed then minced the garlic.  For those who are wondering ½ cup of garlic is about 2 complete flours of garlic minced (which is the amount I used).  So… yummy.

Delicious soup. I fried the garlic only until golden, but the soup was still rich in flavour. Word of advice though, do whisk the eggs briskly into the soup and keep whisking until the soup is cloudy, otherwise it ends up looking a tad bit... disgusting. And that is a shame, because it is a fantastic tasting soup.

I made this soup with the chicken stock instead like other users suggested and added spinach leaves to it, it was delicious! I might try adding some green onion to it next time as well for a little something extra. :)

This soup is fabulous. I used a large can of good brand chopped tomatoes. I also used a cup of the juice from those and only 5 cups of water. Thanks to TLYONS!

So simple, yet sooooo good. It was just what I was looking for. I used a bulb of garlic and some jarred garlic as well. I substituted olive oil for the butter and put in 8 chicken bouillon cubes, used some canned diced tomatoes and put in some gnocci about 10 minutes before serving. Sooooo good. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  It is so pretty looking with the strings of egg and topped with green onion.  I also added a squeeze of lemon.  I'm home ill today and I know that the garlic in this soup will fix me right up.  Thank you for this recipe!

As is, it was a little bland. I added about 5 oz of frozen spinach and lots of other spices, (ome sort of Paris bland and tarragon and parsley.) Then it was good.

Best soup ever! Sauteed garlic and onion, added chicken broth. At the end, added eggs (whisk thoroughly), fresh spinach, pink sea salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Super delicious! Helped me feel so much better.

Pretty good. Maybe a little too much egg. Husband didn't like the tomatoes in it, but I thought they added something unique.  It had a nice flavor.  Not too strong, but definitely not weak.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

I mixed this recipe with French Onion Soup with Browned Garlic By Shonda.  I wanted onion and I didn't have any sherry so I used white wine.  It came out good.

Made mine with chicken stock for more flavor.  Added a herbaceous note by adding chervil near the end of the cooking time.  This was pleasant and not as astringent as I expected it to be.

Have made it several times! Excellent! Especially with home grown garlic!! I simmer at least 45 min. Have made it with  real chicken stock and was good but now I always use Better Than Bullion. That's the best stuff I think!  Oh, and of course I use more garlic than called for, as usual! I double the recipe and use a HEAPING cup of garlic. Also I don't brown the garlic, it just makes it taste burnt to me! Slow simmer for one hour. This recipe is why I started growing my own garlic!!

Very good.  I made this as a "sick" soup for my husband.  I used straight chicken broth instead of water and omitted the bouillon.  He loved it

I liked the taste and the outcome. One thing that was not y favorite was how much butter it contained. It tasted a little too oily greasy BUT I did enjoy the soup . Great remedy for a cold ;)

So, after everyone stopped complaining that I had a dish with Cauliflower in it and actually tasted it, everyone liked it.  I made exactly as layed out. Beware the portions listed in this recipe only yields about four soup bowls about 3/4 full.

Used chicken stock, 2 medium sized potatoes, 6 heads of garlic, and 4 chicken thighs. Also, various greens and a can of mixed vegetables right before serving. And left out the egg.
Was the best chicken soup ever!

This recipe was just too bland.  Although you would think that garlic would have a kick to it, it lacked substance.
