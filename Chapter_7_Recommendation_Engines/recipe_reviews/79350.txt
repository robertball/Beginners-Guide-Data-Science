Yes! Very yummy and easy to work with. I've made them according to the recipe and also with a couple of substitutions. I liked them better with melted butter in place of the crisco. A couple of cups of whole wheat flour also works well. I used 2 cups in a half recipe. And I did the math figuring that a 5 lb bag of flour is about 19 cups. If you halve the recipe it's about 9 1/2.

I just got done making a batch. I made exactly 40 but froze all but 7.. I would suggest making them smaller because 7 took up an entire cookie sheet... if I'd known how much they would rise I would have done 80 instead... I also would recommend mixing by hand... it worked best for me to just use my hands to mix the ingredients and like the lady above said its a little too much dough for a mixer.

These are delish, and very VERY forgiving.  Let me start by saying this is a LOT of dough.  I recommend halving this recipe unless you have enough counter space for 40 LARGE rolls. Once they rise, they look like individual bread loaves. Now the forgiving.  Even though I had to go to the store to get more flour, and wait through a power outage, these turned out perfect.  A little firm on the outside, nice and soft inside with a great mild salty flavor. I'll make these a lot.  I didn't change anything, but I think if I lived somewhere with saltwater that would be great to try!

Ok.....I loved this bread but found it to be very expensive....burned up my stand mixer making it : (.  Mine was a sunbeam and did not survive.  Guess I'll have to go for a higher quality mixer.

obviously more than my mixer could handle.  

Next time I'll be sure and get a few more baking sheets to use.  I'd prefer to make them a little smaller than I did.

I found that spraying cooking spray on my hands helped keep the dough from sticking when I shaped it into balls.

Can't wait to try it again.

scaled this down to a fourt. used 2 tsp of yeast. 1 1/2 cups water,1/8 cup sugar, 1/4 cup shortening. 1/2 tsp salt. and 3 1/2 cups flour. if it's too sticky just add in a little more so it's workable. i added the water to my stand mixer and sprinkled in all the yeast and sugar and proofed for 10 min. till foamy. then added shortening and flour and mixed till incorporated. let that sit for 20 min. then added in salt and kneaded till smooth. followed the rest of the instructions as written. yum

This recipe is incredible! It is very forgiving and it makes a ton of dough. When I half the recipe it still makes two dozen large dinner rolls. These are super simple dinner rolls to make and they always scores lots of compliments. I am very, very impressed with this recipe.

First of all - yum! I scaled down the recipe quite a bit - yielding exactly 12 rolls. I followed the measuring instructions of another reviewer who scaled it down as well, turned out fabulous. The only thing I did different was that I used butter in the place of shortening. I added a little more melted butter than the scaled down recipe originally called for (instead of 1/4 cup, I used about a 1/2 cup). Very easy to make if you are willing to take the time - well worth all the effort it takes! I baked them exactly 20 mins and as soon as I took them out of the oven, I brushed the tops of them with melted butter - amazing!!!

Well I put the recipe on here, but I have to rate it 5*****.  This recipe is fabulous!! It does make a lot of dough, so be prepared for that.  However, these rolls are one of a kind.  Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious!!!
I have never made bread before and it turned out perfect.
I stuffed them with pizza toppings and made pizza buns and they lasted about 2 days.

These are dense, and quite bland.  But oddly, the taste grows on you after that first bite...  I think this might be better toasted, after being made in a loaf perhaps...

These were very good.  Soft and a great taste!  The only problem I had was getting them to brown.  Next time I will add an egg wash to the tops to get them to brown.  For some reason the oil on top did not do the job.  A very good recipe indeed and will be a keeper.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because I scaled the recipe down and therefore the problem might have been my own mistake, but since I have scaled many recipes down, I doubt it. These rolls were bland and boring, they had absolutely no taste. They were also not light and fluffy like I think rolls should be, they would be good with Chile or stew to sop up some of the liquid. But unless I use it that way, I won't be making these again.

I made these today for Thankgiving dinner. I wish I hadn't. They were very "heavy". Not fluffy at all. Not a very good taste. Will not make again.

These. were. AWESOME! I scaled it down, used butter instead of shortening and even added some whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose..and it still turned out.  I have always had problems trying to add WW flour. But this one was awesome!  So, if you consider my alterations as still abiding by this recipe...I say 5 stars, this recipe rocks!

Good recipe. I even messed it up by putting all water in with the yeast (I cut the recipe down to a forth) and they still were great.

My family loves cheese rolls but, I have not made them in years and couldn't find my roll recipe. So I found this recipe and used it. IT WAS GREAT !!!!!! They loved them. So easy and makes a lot. But I had a lot that wanted to take some home.

what is the history of these rolls?  Does anyone know? As a native Virginian, I'd really be interested to know and I cannot find it on the net.

Thank you!
