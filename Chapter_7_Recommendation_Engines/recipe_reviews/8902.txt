very tasty, cider vinegar makes the recipe.  I recommend marinating for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator.  Scoring the breast on both sides prior to marinating deepens the flavor immensely.

This is a GREAT recipe to make.  My daughters could not get enough of the chicken and even asked for it the next day.  A must for everyone to try.  I will make it again and again.  P.S. also makes great chicken salad, if you have leftovers.

This was very easy and good.  I was looking for a quick recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the grill, that did not require marinating.  Of course the cooking time was much shorter, but the taste was very good.  Quick and simple.  I will use again!  Thanks.

Need to make some subtle changes:
1. Add 1/4 tbsp of minced garlic
2. Add 1/4 tsp of hot sesame oil
3. Let sauce cool (30 mins) and add chicken for 30 mins.
4. Enjoy

Surprising! In fact, so surprising that this is the first review I've ever done (wife's account). I used white wine vinegar as opposed to cider vinegar. I fought the urge to cut the vinegar with a bit of sugar because it smelled so strong. Everthing else was done as the recipe was written. Chicken (skinless/bone-in breasts) turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Not vinegary in the least: the right amount of salt/flavor/tanginess. Will do again with cider vinegar to see if it changes the flavor.

This was a decent recipe if you add your own touches. Alone, it is rather bland. 
I spiced up the chicken to my own liking and it turned out really good. I'm going to keep experimenting with it to get it to perfection!

Thanks Vince....  Tried this tonight, and delicious!!!!  I used it as a marinade first, then grilled and basted. YUM!

Used a side of peppers/onions/mushrooms with garlic and marsala and it was a great side.

Sorry, but I'd rather use bottled marinade.  This was extremely bland.  I will not use this recipe again.

This was kind of blah.  I use a brush on that doesn't need to be boiled and I think its better.  Just simple olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and garlic powder that I thought has more taste than this.  The chicken was good it just didn't have any extra flavor.  Sorry :(

I marinated 3 lbs of drumsticks in this for an hour and then grilled.  It tasted good but because the flavor didn't get past the skin, it tasted bland on the inside.

I have been making this recipe for years! The entire family loves it and guests say we make the best bbq chicken. I should have commented as soon as I made it the first time. This does wonderful things to the chicken. Enhances the flavour so much!! The key is to bbq it low and slow. We’ve only ever used bone in pieces. My family prefers drums and thighs and the taste is out of this world!

There is no need to let the chicken marinade for more than 10 min with this recipe. That was plenty for me, and I poured some of the excess over the chicken while it cooked, and some more when I flipped it. It tastes great if you use Old Bay seasoning. Superb! Also I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was awesome!

It was fine. I wanted something easy and it was easy for sure. I liked it . I only made drumsticks and I kinda burnt them (not the recipes fault) so though I gave it a 4 I might have said a 5 had I not burnt them. :)

Very good, added a dash of chipotle chilli to sauce for extra Heat, put slits into the chicken, brushed on sauce and let marinate for 10 minutes before putting on barbecue.

My husband and I both loved it.  I added some extra salt after reading the other reviews and some garlic powder.  Tasty and easy. (it also gave us an excuse to grill!)  Thanks!
