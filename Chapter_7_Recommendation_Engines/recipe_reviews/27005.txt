This was excellent - the flavors blended very well.  I coursely chopped the turkey so it was a bit chunkier and used as filling in sandwiches.

We had smoked a turkey and used our leftovers.  The smoked  meat upped the anty!  We also used fresh chives as I did not have the onions on hand. As I am not a fan of "sweet", I left out the sugar but used rice vinagar which is naturally sweeter.  This would make a great party spread and seems to be very versitile.

I thought this tuned out rather nice considering I had no cider vinegar(used regular instead)or dijon mustard.  

To start, I left out the red bell pepper because I don't care for it very much & I only used 1 celery stalk as my husband doesn't really care for it. In place of the dijon mustard, I substituted 2 teaspoon regular mustard & 4 teaspoons more of regular vinegar + the very smallest of horseradish.  I also 2 tablespoons of sandwich spread & 1 chopped boiled egg.

This is delicious! I used more than 3/4 lb leftover turkey (incidently this is great for chicken too). I coarsely chopped the turkey. I hand chopped the celery, fine, I finely minced red onion(no green on hand). To my mayo I added a small amount of spicy brown mustard, a dash or two of liquid smoke because GilDavid is right the smoke taste sings! The only thing added that was processed in the food processor was a tiny bit of my sofrito. (This way you can sneak in bell pepper and onion etc. on those that do not care for it)! Sofrito can be used any any dish or food where you would use bell peppers. I used Mrs. Dash in place of salt, no sweetner, just a dash of rice vinegar. If you want to play with sofrito...you place in your food processor  I good sized onion cut in medium pieces. 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper , five med to large cloves of garlic smashed well, 1 big bunch of cilantro. I chop the stems of the cilantro into about 1" pieces or they'll wrap around the chopper. I also add the items one food at a time to make sure that they all get processed fine. Do not have water on any of your foods as it will make it too runny. Place in large jar in fridge and use in cooking according to taste. It makes almost a quart. I go through a batch a month minimum. Don't taste it alone, it's very strong & bitter but in food it's great! I do not wash the cilantro ahead of time, they spray it every few min. at the grocery store. Try it you'll like it!

Yum!  I used a small red onion as I had no green onions.  This went together very easily.  I couldn't wait 8 hours for full flavor meld, but waiting only 10 minutes, it was delicious.  I think this would be an excellent post-Thanksgiving recipe.  Thanks!

Great on crackers as suggested by submitter.  Makes a lot, because you can
add extra amounts if desired.

OK, I have used this site for years but so far I have not rated anything, until now that is. I don't particularly care for these kind of salads but I had a lot of turkey left over so I gave it a try (mainly because it didn't call for eggs!). This is more than a keeper, it's EXCELLENT! I will make it again and again. I made it pretty much the same but I didn't use red peppers and I didn't blend mine. I like it a little chunky. I also added about a tbsp. mor of the mustard and also added about a tsp. of cayenne pepper and some louisiana roasted garlic hot sauce for some kick! You have to try this recipe it is very tasty! Thank you for posting an truly awesome recipe!

"Yumdillyicious!"  were my husbands words about this one.  I used Thanksgiving leftovers but will definitely do this one again with canned turkey for ease later.  Hope it works...

I used a little more mayonnaise than what was called for and white wine vinegar only because the Grey Poupon mustard I used also was made with white wine. I added a good amount ground black pepper. I did not run my ingredients through the food processor, I just coarsely chopped the turkey meat and vegetables and just mixed it with the dressing ingredients. Nice basic turkey salad. This made enough for four sandwiches.

This is good, but a little heavy on the mustard for my taste. It was a bit dry, so I added extra mayo. I would suggest mixing the mayo, mustard, vinegar, and sugar FIRST, and then add the mixture to the other ingredients.  I enjoyed this on buttery round crackers (Ritz).

What a great surprise. I wanted something new to do with my leftover turkey and am happy to have come across this recipe. I made it exactly as written then seperated half and added some course ground dijon and a big spoonful of Italian giardiniera that I pulsed in the food processor first. Delicious both ways. Can't wait to try with roast chicken. Next time I'll try some Franks red hot to change it up some more. This can make a great sandwich or even a dip if you process enough in the food processor. So many possibilities. I'm hungry now! Thanks for sharing :-))

This was one of the best Turkey salad that i've ever had. I made sandwiches for my husband and a few of his buddies and they went crazy over this salad. Definitely a keeper.

Basic, but very good, Mine had an extra zip, because I use leftover turkey that I had grilled over hickory wood and coals.

This is one of the few recipes I've made with no tweaks at all, and all the other reviewers who loved it were spot on! This is amazing right after making it (who could wait 8 hours?).  Like others, I diced the turkey and veg by hand, tho I can see how the food processor prep would be helpful if you were planning to serve this as a cracker topping; it would be more like a tuna-salad consistency-more conducive to spreading. IMHO, the key to the difference that makes this stand out is the red pepper, which lends a lovely sweetness to the salad that one normally would get only from fruit. The only changes I might consider in the future would be using chicken if I didn't have turkey, and maybe adding some toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds for some added crunch.

Excellent recipe!!  I did change it a little because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used red onion instead of green onion and I used Mrs. Dash instead of salt.  I did not use the bell pepper (didn't have one on hand).  When I tried it the next day I was very surpised.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was delicious. The only things I did differently was to cube the turkey meat instead of blend in blender used about a cup more meat than called for since I prefer my turkey salad dry and chunky. I left out the red pepper simply because I didn't have one. Otherwise, the flavors together were fantastic. I should have doubled the entire recipe. I'm saving this for next year post-Thanksgiving & Christmas.

Made with left over roasted Turkey Breast. Really good! We couldn't wait so we tried it right after making and it was great. Even better the next day! I used chunky bits (did not process) and served with sliced cucumber on wheat rolls, Delish!! Will definatly make again, every time with leftover Turkey.

Delicious turkey salad! I skipped the red pepper. I didn't use a processor, just coarsely chopped the meat. GO PATS!! UPDATE 12/1/19:  I found a similar recipe on another site, so I made several changes. I had turkey thigh meat on hand, so I went with that. I used lemon juice in place of the vinegar. I also added dried dill. A little extra sugar really gives this a good flavor.

Very good on sandwiches as well as on crackers. Nice depth compared to chicken salad.  And a nice way to use left over turkey.

I thought this was good on toasted bread or crackers. It was nice to find a turkey or chicken salad that didn't have fruit. I also liked that all of the ingredients were finely chopped, which was different. I don't have a food processor, so I minced all of the ingredients. Although, it took quite a bit of time to do that by hand. For the ingredients, I didn't have green onion so I used white. I also had to subtitute the red pepper for orange and the cider vinegar for white wine vinegar. I used lite mayo, but found that it needed more like 6 leveled Tblsp. and not 3. I didn't quite understand the refridgeration part on the recipe though? I ate some when it was just made and it was really good. However, the next day it gets watery and unappetizing looking. So, personally I would plan to make it fresh.

Thank you Gloria; very scrumptious!  If you're interested in a varient with a little more zip and tang, try replacing the vinegar with worcestershire sauce and the bell pepper with dill pickles.

I almost didn't make this because I don't like mustard, however, I had all the ingrediants on hand, and lots of left-over turkey, so I gave it a go last night. I doubled it and hand-chopped everything, like many others. Chopping cooked turkey was easier and quicker than I thought! I cut the mustard in half, and substituted honey instead of sugar. I didn't strictly measure any of the liquid ingrediants. It is DELICIOUS. I agree with others- I ate some immediately! Yum! It was also great today cold. Next time I will probably put it the recommended amount of mustard, as I didn't notice it(which is s plus in my book).

Accidentally left out the onions, but no one noticed. In the end I threw in a handful or so of dried cranberries and loved the sweet little kick it gave. Very yummy.

I didn't bother with the food processor, just shredded the turkey with a fork & chopped everything else and made sandwiches.  Love the flavors in this. I wish I had more leftover turkey to make this again!

I made two changes to this:  I didn't let it sit for more than just a couple of hours, and I didn't mince it up into cracker-size form.  I only needed to have a good base for some leftover turkey that I had, and this fit the bill.  I'd make this again.  Thanks, Gloria Burris!

This is mild, yet very tasty. Easy to make. I doubled the recipe the first time I made it and I'm glad I did. I didn't have Dijon mustard on hand, so I used my spicy brown instead.

DELICIOUS.   I prepared exactly as the recipe called for.  Loved the crunch of the celery and red pepper.  I was a little skeptical of the vinegar, but the flavors were outstanding.

Awesome! Forget using the food processor though and finely chop all the veggies. I used about 1/2 lb of leftover turkey breast that I smoked for Thanksgiving cut into small cubes, substituted green onions, added a few sliced grapes, and about 1/4 tsp of tarragon.  Made the perfect sandwich on toast with leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato.

Like Gildavid, I smoke a lot of turkey this time of year so I made a huge batch of this stuff and my people ate it and scraped the bowl! I'm getting ready to make some more just for myself.  :~)

I took this a slightly different way - I chopped the turkey chunky and rustic to make more of a salad then a cracker spread.  I didn't have any celery, but celery salt worked pretty well.  My husband (thinks he) hates Dijon mustard so I was afraid it would stand out, but it doesn't - it just adds perfect flavor.  I thought twice about the cider vinegar and sugar but glad that I added it for something different.
This is the hubs lunch tomorrow (if I don't eat it all now and send him with PB&J) and I'm going to put it on a bed of greens, topped with hard boiled egg, sliced tomato and drizzled with aged Pomegranate Balsamic.  He's going to love it.

Definitely plan to make this recipe again. I did however omit the apple cider vinegar and sugar
 I them added some sweet pickled relish and 2 chopped up boiled eggs. Didn't think that was cider vinegar was needed. I also added in a little bit of Cajun seasoning. My kids and husband loved it on crackers. Needless to say we didn't wait 8 hours or overnight to eat it. Maybe we'll do that next time.

I've been making this for years using boneless, skinless chicken tenders instead.  Also, instead of the red pepper, I've added craisins.   Delicious for a light, cool meal during Arizona's never ending summers.

Great tasting, family loved it. Used lemon juice instead of vinegar and added slightly more mayo. I buy turkey parts year round because they are inexpensive and good. This is a great salad to make with these parts.

I love it!!!!  I didn't have Dijon mustard so used honey mustard instead. This recipe is quick to make and tastes great!!!!  As the reviewer suggests, you can use it after ten minutes, but allowing the flavours to marry is certainly worthwhile.

Ha, didn't read it all the way and just found out I was supposed to wait 8 hours, more like 8 minutes from making it till I spread it on a hoagie bun. Delicious.

Loved it! Didn't have time to let it set & it was still very good. Did substitute celery with finely chopped cucumber. Red onion was on hand & used instead of green onion. Served on sandwiches & will definitely make again.

This was the best turkey salad I have ever had.  My family loved it!  I will make it again.  Thank you for the recipe.

One thing I changed was I used apple cider vinegar.  It was very good.

Overall this was pretty darn good but I may add less vinegar and mustard next time. I used red onion instead of green because that's what I had and also added some relish. It tasted very mustardy right after mixing but after sitting overnight it was much better.

Oh Bubba! This is good! Didn’t have the red wine vinegar so used balsamic. Otherwise, followed recipe. Excellent right after mixing, can’t wait for eight hours. I like it!

I made this with left over T'giving turkey.  Because of family health concerns I omitted the sugar. The salad is a bit acidic for my taste.

Having surgery tomorrow.  Looking for an easy to prepare recipe that would provide food on demand.  I just mixed this up.  It is delicious.  I can't wait for it to chill.
I thought the mustard was odd and almost left it out.  I'm glad I didn't.
The only change I made was to use two-thirds mayonaise, one-third sour cream, which is the same thing I do for chicken salad.

Very good on crackers or as a meat dip.  Next time I will tone down the cider vinegar. I added some craisins at the last minute just for a splash of color and it really enhanced the flavor!

I made this recipe as written the first time  as stated. We did not care for the vinegar thus the 4 stars I have made it numerous times with the following changes.  No vinegar, no red pepper as not needed for flavor . I instead of sugar I use  1/4 cup Marzettis' slaw dressing  along with the Mayo. A trick my  Mother in law taught me  45 years ago was after mixing to heat the mixture ( I use the microwave) just enough to release the flavors the flavor s. I also do this with chicken , ham and potato salad. It makes a world of difference.  As all recipes, every cook makes changes to preference. Thank you for sharing.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe and it was perfect.
The second time, however, I decided to mix it up a bit and add some dried crushed red peppers instead of the regular peppers, and also added a tablespoon of sweet relish, 3 more tablespoons of mayo, and 1/2 cup of Italian blend cheese.

I actually can't decide which version is my favorite.

Was an easy and nice switch from blah mayo recipe.
I also subbed roasted red pepper for reg red pepper/
I also used the Dijon to taste instead of the req'd amount.
It was delish!

Thank you for this recipe. ..for 20+ years i haven't  had turkey salad. .. when I was 18 years old my grandmother had made turkey salad for me after I was sent off to a group home the counselor at the group home through the salad away thinking it was spoiled she thought it was then going to be a good idea to replace it with ham salad I was so heartbroken cuz, it was last time I had seen my grandmother.  I just couldn't eat turkey salad anymore and today I was thinking about her and decided to make the salad and was so blown away by how it tasted just so like hers that I want to say thank you very much

I did change up this recipe a little by leaving out the red peppers (didn't have any) and adding some provolone cheese.  I was looking for a sandwich filling that could be toasted or grilled.  This was perfect.

Made it with a few modifications. I made 3lbs of turkey so adjusted all ingredients accordingly. I also did not add the red peppers or the sugar. In the food processor I pulsed  dried cranberries and walnuts, added spicy brown mustard to the Dijon, mayo mix and also 1 tsp of cayenne. To the turkey meat I splashed about 1/2 tsp of Liquid Smoke. Fantastic!

I was skeptical, but was I ever wrong.,  This is delicious.  I added about two tablespoons of ground walnuts for a little more crunch.  Perfect on crackers!  Thank you for sharing this one.

This may be my favorite way to use leftover turkey. I used regular mustard as I didn't have any dijon. Left out the celery. Made for good sandwiches and on crackers.

Delicious.  I omitted red bell pepper, bc I didn't have any; also sub'd dill pickle brine for the vinegar (just personal preference)I chopped meat into small pieces, hand diced other veggies.   Definitely recommend this recipe.   I know I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing GB.

I used a small yellow onion as I didn't have green onions. I used chunks of turkey but used a chopper for the veggies. Blended all of the ingredients and then added the turkey. Super easy and great flavor.

I didn't have a red pepper so I added in a season salt that has dried red pepper. OMG this is awesome. It's great on crackers, toasted rye bread and wheat thins. My Mom gave me her jumbo Cuisinart and I was making batches all afternoon. I loved it so much I had to share it with other..and cooked a 24 lb turkey so I gotta creatively get ride of some turkey.. The cider vinegar and dijon mustard brought the turkey to life. It's creamy, but I didn't feel like I was eating a ton of mayo..I just read that I was supposed to refrigerate overnight..haha. I ate about 1/4 of before the family returned home. Thank you for sharing!

I added some chopped up pecans and couldn't find the mayo, so I used miracle whip and omitted the sugar. I also added 3 tablespoons of coleslaw dressing.  Great way to enjoy day old turkey.

Too dry for me. I had to double the mayo. Doubling the mayo helped to level out (re: drown out) the strange taste the apple cider vinegar gives it. Overall, I would make this recipe again with changes, but as-written I can't give it more than 3 stars.

I will definitely make this again.  A great way to finish off your turkey leftovers.  I didn't have red pepper so I used green pepper.  I also added some chopped carrots to the mixture for more crunch.

I used used almost all of the uneaten dark meat from our Thanksgiving turkey leftovers for this recipe. I replaced the sugar with diced up dried cranberries, and it was delicious. My suggestion: you'll need some kind of substitute if you leave out the sugar. The recipe needs something sweet to really marry all the flavors together (diced up fresh apple or grapes or any other sweet dried fruit will work).

Very good so far (I test tasted it); it still has to do the 8-hour overnight thing. I used a couple of substitutes based on what was in previous reviews: used only a dash of rice vinegar; used only spicy brown mustard -- will also add a couple of boiled eggs.  This is a really good recipe for using up the leftover turkey.

I always make recipes following the directions.  Admittedly I only waited two hours before trying but it's a good recipe and a good way to use up dark turkey meat, which I'll admit I'm not a fan of.

I'm sorry - we didn't care for this. It has a tuna salad consistency which seemed strange for a turkey salad and the flavor just wasn't for us.

So good! We used smoked turkey, sweet yellow onion and rice vinegar since that's what we had on hand. We also made a version with veganaise since one of us can't eat eggs. Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent base recipe! I omitted the vinegar and sugar and added another stalk of celery and a bit more onion. Mine seemed to take a little more mayo and mustard.... But it has a great flavor! Thanks!

The basic ingredient in this recipe is the apple vinegar, sugar, dijon mustard, and mayo. I think any veggie you put in with the turkey  it would turn out great! The apple idea is a good one too.

I can't express how amazing this recipe is. I've also substituted chicken for the turkey. So delicious with so few ingredients. The vinegar and mustard really give a nice dimension to the salad. Highly recommend this

I needed a recipe for my leftover Cajun Smoked turkey and this one worked perfectly!! Made minor adjustments - halved the green onions, celery, vinegar and dijon mustard, added fresh parsley, egg, pepper and extra mayo. I placed the wonderful mixture on warm croissants with green leaf lettuce, plated it with chips and a nice side green salad and BOOM....a wonderful and yummy lunch, perfect for guests!!  This is now one of my favorites .

I made this today, minus the celery. (We have a family member who is allergic to celery. I added a bit more season to suit our tastes, but it was great on the focaccia rolls I purchased the other day. My daughter in particular, loved it!

I made this without the celery and bell pepper simply because I didn't have any but thought it was perfect without it. Can't wait to try it with the additional ingredients think it would make a good crunch.

Followed the directions to the letter.  Other than having to wait 8 hours to eat it, I loved this recipe.  It was a very easy meal to prepare.  I may try this with ham next time to see if it will be as good.  Will make this again!

I used smoked turkey.  I did not use a food processor.  I chopped my ingredients.  Used pecans because I like pecans and didn't have red pepper.  Everyone loved it.

Made it exactly as written, make them into wraps using Ezekiel wraps, with a little lettuce. They weren't bad, worth trying for sure. I didn't want to wait over night but I do have some left over to try like that. Right away they're pretty decent.. I enjoyed it, not sure if I want to make them again. But they're fast to whip up and not bad in a pinch. Worth trying out!

I loved this...a great fresh taste. We added cilantro, goat cheese, and dill pickel, and put it atop a bed of fresh spinach. next time will also add hard boiled eggs and nuts, but lighter on the mustard. Enjoy!!

What a creative way to use up turkey! To make it a bit healthier, substitute greek yogurt for the mayo. There's so little of it in the recipe you can't even taste it!

Yum! Used leftover T-day turkey and swapped out 1/2 red onion for the green onion but otherwise followed the recipe. This spread was excellent and my kids enjoyed it on crackers as a snack and it was good on bread with tomato, lettuce and bacon slices. The only change I would make would be to add the red pepper with the mayo so that it would be chunkier and have a better texture - but that is just a personal preference! Otherwise this is a go to recipe for turkey leftovers.

Just made this with some of our leftover turkey, and I'm regretting not doubling it! I chopped the ingredients since I don't have a food processor, and substitued white vinegar for apple cider vinegar. I also added some black pepper. Very good, and a great way to use leftovers when you want a totally different taste than your Thanksgiving dinner the day before. I tasted this immediately and it was great, and we'll be eating it in sandwiches in an hour. I will make again and wait the 8 hours.

I agree with the others this recipe is da bomb.  Love it, love it, love it.  The only change I made was substituting honey in place of the sugar.  I ate some right after I made it and I also skipped the processor preferring to chop the turkey manually.  yummo.
