I really liked this one!  I didn't fry the fritters in oil and they still tasted pretty delicious!  Even the 3-year old and 5-year old liked it.  I was a little nervous about the spring onions being too spicy, but they were just fine.

I thought the dill was a little too overpowering and might need more flour than called for.

Great flavour but I found the interior of the fritters very wet. I did sub fresh basil and parsley for the dill as we're not fans of dill. If I were to make this again I would strain the shredded zucchini before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Tasty, but like others who tried this recipe, came out anything but crispy, and that was after spinning the zucchini and squeezing it through paper towels, and adding more flour than indicated and even a few crackers.

I will make these again but when you make them you need to add WAY more flour. The original batter was very watery and I followed everything. So add about 3 total tablespoons of flour.

I followed the recipe exactly, but my batter was a watery mess. I had to add 1 C of flour to get the batter thick enough to make the fritters. They tasted good, though, so I will play with the recipe to see if I can get it right. The first change  will be to salt and wring out the zucchini before adding to the batter and see if that fixes the problem.
