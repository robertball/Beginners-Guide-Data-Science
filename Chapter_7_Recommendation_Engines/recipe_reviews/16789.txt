Excellent recipe!  Instead of grilling the mushrooms, I laid foil on a baking sheet, arranged the mushrooms on there, and then spooned the mixture over them.  I then baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 7 minutes and broiled for another 5.  Very tasty!!!

tasted this recipe and then the same recipe adding a splash of balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar adds a richer flavour to an already fantastic recipe.

I used the recommendation of grilling stem side down for about 5 minutes, and then turning over, adding the spread, and grilling the rest of the time.  Good call, I think.  My 2 year old and veggie-picky hubby both thought this was great.  It did have a great flavor, but I thought it was just a touch too salty.  I'll cut back a bit next time.

I made these tonight for my husband, who mentioned that he was dying for some on the grill.  The aroma was so inviting, that this non-mushroom lover had to taste test it.  I am now sold on portobellos!  My husband said they were the best he's ever had! One thing I did differently was that I grilled the mushrooms stem-side down for about 4-5 min. and then flipped them and added the spread.  Two thumbs up from this family!

Simple to prepare. My grill ran out of gas but they still managed to cook nicely. Great flavor and color. Served with the proscuitto basil chicken bundles from this site, some garlic parmesan bread,  and a nice mixed spring green salad with walnuts, bacon, pear and balsamic dressing. The flavors were incredible. (A white Italian wine was also served.) Also, took a leftover mushroom and put it between two slices of the leftover garlic bread and ate it as a sandwich. WOW! That could be a new recipe in itself. Again, a great one.

Since I don't have a grill, I baked this in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes like the other reviewers suggested.  It turned out great!

These were excellent!  I was so impressed.  Even my husband who doesn't like mushrooms ended up liking them quite a bit.  I thought the filling amount was too small for four mushrooms, so I only used three mushrooms.  That was a mistake because the filling has so much flavor that it could easily work for four mushrooms.  My only complaint is that I down on the amount of salt, but it was still too salty.  Next time I'll use half the amount of salt called for or maybe even less.  I'll be making these again.  So delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I chopped the stems and added them into the pepper mixture and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. Since it was extremely cold outside (hubby wouldn't grill), I put them in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 then broiled until the cheese was brown. A definite hit!

My husband is a meat fan, so when he realized I was using this as the main dish, he was skeptical.  He now loves it and asks me "When are we gonna have those portabella mushrooms?"  These also make a great "hamburger".  Just use portabella instead of a hamburger patti on sliced french bread.

Hubby and I both agree - five stars! Perfect and memorable in so many ways! They're beautiful, so in addition to being a side dish they double as a pretty and colorful garnish to the dinner plate. They're different, not the same ol' veggie side dish. They're also healthy and nutritious. Finally, they're just plain delicious. I rubbed the mushrooms with olive oil before filling and grilling them, and used a mix of yellow, red and green peppers for additional color. So pretty! Sure, these can easily be popped in the oven, but grilling them adds such a nice, smoky flavor. We enjoyed these so much we're having them again tomorrow night. While perfect as is, I'm going to add a little grated Asiago cheese to the mix. Delicious and creative recipe!

This was INCREDIBLE.  I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the topping mixture, otherwise followed it exactly. Then I grilled the mushrooms (which were HUGE) gill side down for a few minutes, then turned over and added the topping. Right before the end, I added a sprinkling of smoked Gouda to melt.  While I made this as a side dish to accompany Marinated Grilled Shrimp by Rachel (also on this site and 5*****!), these mushrooms could easily stand on their own.  They end up with an amazing beefy quality, very juicy and tons of flavor! The bell peppers disappear, so nothing special needs to be done there, just chop them finely. WILL DEFINITELY KEEP THIS RECIPE and use again!!

Watch the Salt!!
I put the red bell pepper and the garlic in the food processor and then added the olive oil salt and pepper and stirred it up. I spread the mixture on the gill side and placed them gill side up in my indoor grill (foreman) for just a few minutes and VOILA!!  I loved them. I served them as a side dish to meaty pasta shells with garlic bread.

Never had Portabello mushrooms before--this made a GREAT sandwich - can't waite to make it for my sister & hubby when they come to visit.  So easy & so good! We did add to it a bit--thin sliced avacado sprinkled with garlic & salt - a thin sliced tomattoe - swiss cheese and thinly sliced onion sauted in butter--yummm! Along with whole wheat bread toasted.  The best sandwich I've ever had--and I'm almost as old as dirt!!!

Yum, yum, yum. I marinated in Italian salad dressing for about 30 minutes, then topped with the red pepper mixture and grilled them on my Foreman. I used roasted red peppers from a jar because I forgot the red peppers when I went shopping. As soon as I took them from the grill, I topped with sliced provolone cheese. Superb.

Wow! Even my kiddo loved it. Next time I will half the salt, as I thought it could do with less. Fantastic summertime recipe. Started off grilling stem side down 5, then flipping, covering with topping and continued cooking.  Very flavorful. One recipe was enough for 9 smaller portobellos.

Yum! I did a few substitutions.  I used finely diced shallot in place of the onion powder, doubled the garlic, added a 1/2 cup of feta cheese and removed the mushroom stubs and chopped them finely and added them to the mixture. We topped this with finely grated asiago cheese. I'm sure they would have been perfect based on the recipe alone, but I adjusted for our own preferences. We doubled the recipe and served it as an entree and opened up the meal with an onion soup. Perfect meatless meal!

I brought this to 'Girls Poker Night' and the response I got was, "Holy heck this is amazing!"  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I had problems with the grill so I put the mushrooms in a frying pan, covered, for 15 min on medium heat.  I added some Havarti cheese and cooked for another few minutes until melted.  Absolutly amazing.

THANKS MY WIFE REALLY ENJOYED THESE! I DID TOP WITH MOZZERELLA AND AMERICAN CHEESES AND USED FRESH ONION IN PLACE OF THE POWDWER. ALSO ADDED ALITTLE ITALIAN SEASONED BREAD CRUMBS TO TRY TO "FORM" THE PEPPERS AND ONIONS TOGETHER.

I enjoyed these as a main meatless course. I used jarred roasted red and yellow peppers and a little sauteed onion in place of the onion powder. I don't have a grill, so I followed suggestions and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. I melted a slice of provolone on top of each cap right at the end of cooking time. That made them better, maybe 4 star.

I love this recipe.   I've made it with and without the gills and you should definitely leave the gills attached because the gills give the mushrooms a better flavor.

I tried this today along with another recipe I seen on here for grilled "bello's".  This recipe won hands down. I used about 1/4 of italian dressing ontop of the ingredients listed. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese and placed a slice of Pepperjack on top 3 minutes before pulling these off the grill. Superb! 

another idea I have would be use this same recipe, slice the mushrooms in slices, add 1/4 cup of Italian dressing, and saute. Place on top of some really good Pasta, and Oh My i bet that would be a treat!

This was the best at my 4th of July bbq.  Everyone loved and and were fighting for seconds!  I forgot how much the mushrooms shrink, so I think next time I will double or even triple the recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and they were great!

Enjoyed this so much I wish I had more.  I didn't use the bell pepper since I didn't have any but thought the recipe was great w/out it.  This was my first attempt at grilling Portobello mushrooms and now it will always be part of our barbeque dinners.  My neighbor who joined us for dinner also loved it.  Unfortunately our husbands aren't mushroom lovers and wouldn't try it- well more for us!!

We did make a couple of changes.  We used both red and green pepper and some fresh onion, toss them in the food processor with some olive oil and minced garlic and chopped it in the processor.  We also cook them gill side down a few minutes, before flipping them and adding the pepper mixture.  We add mozzarella cheese and serve it as a sandwich with garlic bread we also make on the grill.  YUM!

very, very good.  I subbed diced onion for the onion powder, added a tiny dash of basalmic and threw some parmesian cheese on top the last couple minutes on the grill.  Husband said it was the first time he's ever liked grilled portobellos done outside a restaurant.  He liked it so much he called his parents to tell them to try this recipe.

These were quite good.  I took another reviewer's advice and grilled gill-side down for a couple of minutes before turning and adding the topping. I added crumbled goat's cheese to the top about 5 minutes before taking them off the grill.  We though this added a lot to the mushrooms.  We found a whole mushroom like this to be a bit much but thought it would be a great appetizer for a BBQ if cut into 6 wedges.

Delicious!  Not a big fan of red peppers, so I was worried the taste would be overwhelming, but it mellowed nicely during the grilling process.  My husband fixed grilled chicken at the same time & they partnered very well together.

So yummy!  I used jarred roasted red peppers, but that was the only change I made.  Served with a whole wheat roll and a garden salad.  Delicious and healthy!

This was so delicious! I used feta cheese and actual onions in the recipe. Since it's cold I didn't use a grill. I put them in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Yum!

Made these last night w/fillet mignon and buttery carrots.  These are scrumptious!  I only had green bell pepper but still so very yummy.  In fact, my husband wants them again tonight with dinner; also wants me to make them for a small football party tomorrow!

These are delicious! So flavorful! I usually don't have fresh red peppers on hand, so I usually use roasted red peppers and they work wonderfully.  I like to make them on my George Foreman grill and when they're almost done, I'll sprinkle them with some cheese (feta, parmesan or mozzerella) and pop them under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Excellent!

fabulous and a new item to add to my vegetarian diet! I followed the recipe except I had no red bell pepper. And after cooking on both sides, I added the rest of the liquid, mixed in with some diced tomatoes and fresh parsley to the gill side. I then topped with a slice of provolone and served on garlic bread. Absolutely divine and cannot wait for my next one. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!

I love this. I will be bringing these to a cookout tonight because I like them better then hamburgers. I will print out extra recipes to pass out to the other guests. Whenever my husband eats these he says "YUM" almost every bite. I make these on the grill and in the oven.

Very yummy! The recipe seemed to have too much oil for my taste, so I edited it; here are my changes: for 2 mushrooms I used 1 cup diced bell pepper, 1 garlic clove, 1/4 cup onion, splash of balsamic vinegar (a must!), splash of olive oil, salt & pepper to taste. I baked the mushrooms for about 17 minutes and the result was delicious... I recommend trying it.

I had 2 large port. mushrooms to use up and tried this recipe. I chopped up 1 large red bell pepper along with 1/4 cup ch. sweet onion, 1 tsp. minced garlic and sauteed in a very small amount of olive oil till tender. Added the onion powder, some garlic powder and blk. pepper. No salt. Also added about 2 tbls. of white balsamic vincegar (from T. Joes). let sit while I grilled the mushrooms a few minutes on each side (sprayed both sides with Garlic Olive Oil)I let them drain well on paper towels before filling. Put them in a foil baking pan directly on a low heat grill and heated till hot. Before heating sprinkled each with shredded Asaigo/Parm. cheese. Excellent!

I chose to cook these in the oven b/c there wasn't room on the grill.  I followed another's advice and baked at 350 for about 8 minutes and then broiled for 4 or 5 minutes.  I cannot explain how absolutely delicious these were!  The texture was perfect.  Full of flavor and so pretty with the red peppers on top!  I'm already wanting to make these again.  Simple and delish.  You can't get any better than that!**UPDATE** I made these again forgetting that the first time I had added some salad vinegar to the mix.  They were still good, but not as "to die for" as we thought they were the first time.  The vinegar just adds that delicious tang that makes your mouth water.  I won't forget it again:)

These were delicious and so easy. I added in a quarter of a red onion diced with the red pepper and added in garlic powder instead of onion as I had none. Also I added in so basil and a splash of balsamic vinegar. I made these on a grill pan on the stove. Ate them with seasoned brown rice and a spinach salad.

This was an excellent vegetarian dish - even as a main course.  I made a few alterations to kick it up a notch, not that it really needs it, though.  For two mushrooms I chopped 1/4 cup of green onions, 1/4 cup of jalepenos, 2/3 cup of red bell pepper added that to fresh cracked black pepper, a dash of onion powder and a 1/4 cup of olive oil and then lightly blended/chopped it in the bleder to creat a thick salsa like mixture.  I cooked gill side down for 5 min and then flipped and added mixture, cooking for another 12 minutes.  You can top with a slice of smoke cheese and eat on a sandwich or just use a knife and fork!  Excellent recipe.

I made this following recipe ingredients and quantities.  However, it was rainy so I made a last minute change in cooking method and sauteed the mushroom caps, then added the topping and broiled for about 5 minutes.

This turned out good, but lacking the zip to make it great.  I saw from the reviews that a lot of people added cheese, and I think I'd do that next time too, as well as some sauteed onion and perhaps even some crumbled bacon.  This was good enough that I'd like to try it again with some additions, so thank you for the recipe!

This is really a terrific recipe.  I've grilled portobello's a lot in the past, but no recipe has ever come close to the flavor and freshness that you get with this!  I enhanced it just a bit by adding a little finely chopped red onion and a bit of dried thyme and oregano for added color and flavor.  A light sprinkle of shredded parmesan at the end is nice too - any more than a sprinkle though would ruin the balance of flavors!

deliciouso! I used the recipe and added a little more red pepper, black pepper, andminced and added the stems of the mushrooms to the filling.  I topped it off with smoked gouda, and baked it like another poster suggested. WONDERFUL!  Actually will be making it again this evening and will experiment with another cheese (cheddar perhaps? :)

Very good.  I ended up pureeing the red pepper/olive oil/etc. mix before placing it on top of the mushrooms. I also topped it with mozzarella cheese.  It was very good, but a little bland.  I think that if I make this again, I will add more seasonings to it.

Very intersting recipe.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Don't go by the photo that accompanies this recipe with the cheese on top...ugh!  The pepper mixture with the mushrooms is tasty enough without adding extra fat (cheese), but that is my opinion. Enjoy! Made a second time and broiled in the middle of the oven for 12 minutes. It was delicious. I use fresh shallots instead of onion powder.

This recipe was delicious and would rate 5 stars if it weren't so salty! Reduce the salt and you will have it just about right.

I've never been a fan for mushrooms on their own, but these were delicious...I baked for about 15 minutes at 350, and they turned out very nicely.  Will be using this recipe again.

This was excellent!  I added chopped onion and a little balsamic vinegar to the mixture and baked them according to a previous review.  Then I mixed up a little lemon herb mayo and melted some provalone cheese on a whole wheat bun. Added a romain lettuce leaf and enjoyed a wonderful sandwich!

This was EXCELLENT! I haven't always loved portobello mushrooms, but I do now! I made this for my husband and he too, loved it. I am a garlic lover, so I used 1 clove versus 1/2 clove. We paired the mushrooms with a filet  mignon  drizzled with a gorgonzola butter/garlic sauce. Together, this was a delicious meal that any 5 star restaurant would love to serve!

I really liked this dish. I paired it with a gorgonzola and carmelized onion pizza. It was a nice healthy side to match it. Next time I may sprinkle some parmesian on top.

Very good!!  Grilled cap side down for 5 min as suggested & used 2 Tbs butter, 2 Tbs oil.  I didn't have onion powder, so I tried substituting finely chopped yellow onion.  SAUTE them first!!  We'll definitely make these again the next time we grill.

Great recipe that everyone raved about, including the vegan.  Followed directions with the exception that replaced the onion powder with 1/2 cup diced onion that I sautéed along with a couple cloves of garlic before mixing with red pepper etc.  Following advice of another, grilled gill side down for 4 minutes, then filled and grilled @15 minutes.  I won't bother with that extra step next time and will shorten total grill time to about 10 minutes (grilled chicken at same time, so fire may have been hotter).  Definitely plan to make again, great as a side or the entrée.

I read a review and baked it at 350 for 7 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes. It came out Uhhhhmazing! I also cut back to half of the olive oil and half of the salt, and ever the garlic lover, I doubled that up :) delicious!!!

Grilled, simmered in a pan with o.o. and balsamic, or baked.. no matter which way you cook these babies, they are JUICY and DELICIOUS.  I also add onion and make a garlic aioli sauce to spread on them.  Fabulous!

When I read the recipe I thought chopped red pepper was unnecessary but I had some so I tried it as written.  The little crunch of the pepper really made this dish tasty and pretty.

My husband and I just made these for dinner. They were amazing! I had to improvise a bit as I did not have any onion powder so I finely chopped a yellow onion. They are becoming part of our regular rotation.

Great dish!  I added turkey sausage inside the cap before adding the stuffing, I then put blue cheese crumbles on top.  Wow! Such a fabulous dish! I invited my little bro over and a few other friends found out I was making them again and ended up preparing 10 of them.  Made a Orzo and Kale salad with it. What a great social meal!

Break this one out when you want to impress your vegetarian friends!  As an alternative, try a little fresh red onion, top with a slice of cheese and service in a bun.

Wow, great recipe. Only change i did was add shredded mozzarella on top and put in oven @ 350 for 15 min and 5 min broil(to let cheese bubble/brown) like a few others mentioned. My hubby made a grilled mushroom Parmesan sandwich with his. He LOVED it! This recipe is a keeper!!

I followed this recipe, brushed oil mix over entire mushroom.  Then I baked them, gill side up, at 425 for 25 minutes, then sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and baked for another 10 minutes.  Delicious !

I don't use the red peppers because I don't like them, but everything else is really good. This is the recipe I use every time I make portobello mushrooms, which has actually been a lot now that I have found this recipe!

My husband and I LOVED these!  I thought the peppers would be overwhelming, but they weren't!  Maybe a little less oil and salt next time, but definitely will make these again and again!

I've known about this recipe and have been using it as an appetiser recipe for a long time. Occasionally I would toss up the peppers with a bit of pasta sauce. But a real treat would be to grill/bake it with a layer of mozarella cheese on top! HEAVENLY!

Hubby made these and they were excellent. He also grilled sliced tomato's placed them on top of the mushrooms and added a slice of provolone cheese to melt. Outstanding dinner that we all loved. Thanks Michael!

I'm not a big mushroom fan but wanted to try these since im on the atkins diet..and i must say...these were very very tastey.  we didnt want to fire up the grill so we used our George Forman grill, which worked just as well.  Very nice flavor.  We will be making these again but i think we will add some chopped u bacon and maybe some cheese on top for added flavor!

I dont eat mushrooms so I have no idea how to cook them.  I made this for my boyfriend because portobello mushrooms just so happen to be one of his favorite food.  I added a little but of Mozza cheese and some diced sausage.  He thought it was absolutely amazing!

These mushrooms were delicious!  I used 4 smaller Portobello caps and it seemed like there was too much sauce, but they turned out beautifully.  I took other users recommendations and topped with parmesan cheese (which became chewy when cooled, so I will use mozzarella next time) -- the flavor reminded me of pizza.

This was just fantastic as is!  I let them marinade for about three hours and then cooked them in the skillet with olive oil and onions, using the left over marinade to cook with as well.  I wouldn't change anything.  It was absolutely fabulous!

These were very good but there was way too much salt (and I'm a salt lover).  Next time we're going to omit the salt altogether.

I made this for a vegetarian guest who was the only one amongst meat-eaters (we had NY Strips and he had the mushrooms)... frankly, most of us were dying to try the mushrooms!  He raved about them and requested the recipe immediately!

I love portobella mushrooms and they are great anyway you prepare them. Another easy and delicious way to grill them is to cover them with bottled Italian dressing and let rest a few minutes. Then cook on grill or you can bake or put in fry pan. They come out juicey with the most wonderful flavor! I also have eaten them as a sandwich topped with cheese. Thanks!

These are great.  I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil plus 2 tablespoons of melted butter and when they were just about done; I put a slice of provolone cheese on top of each to melt.  Bravo Michael!

I liked this better than my husband but I enjoy mushrooms more.  I omitted the red bell pepper due to family preference (although I think it would be nice for the color). I dipped the mushrooms in the dressing on both sides, baked it at 350 degrees in the oven for 10 minutes, flipped it, & then baked it for 10 minutes more.  Maybe 8 minutes a side would have been better.  It should be even better on the the grill when it's warmer.

Made it for lunch--- I added a chopped sausage link, sautéed with the red pepper and some diced onion, and then stuffed the mushrooms.  Topped with some shredded parmesan cheese.  Next time, I'll try some blue cheese crumbles.  It was really good!

I loved these, but my husband could not get past the consistency of the mushroom.  He said the flavor was good and that maybe he would eat it on top of a burger, but not by itself.  I thought it was delicious and I will absolutely make these many more times!

I made this recipe in the oven as suggested by some of the reviewers. I also added a few things to "make it my own" and will continue to use this recipe and to add other things to it, like sausage or crab, or other finely chopped vegetables. I did saute some fresh onion in place of the onion powder as recommended by at least one reviewer and it was a great idea. I recommend this recipe as either a side dish or, with the addition of some protein, a main dish.

Great recipe.  I made a couple small mods: I took the stems out and chopped them up and added them with the peppers inside the mushroom tops.  I also added chopped walnuts (delicious!).  And lastly, I put grated mozzarella cheese over it when it was done grilling.  Fantastic meal.  I grilled over the open flame and highly suggest it.

Simple and delicious.  Like many others I baked/broiled this. I also changed it to used diced onions instead of powdered and I added flaked Parmesan cheese.

The flavor was good, but there was WAY too much olive oil pooling in the center of the cap during grilling. I made these exactly as the recipe called for with no changes except to grill the gill side first a little, then flip over and fill with the mixture (recommend doing that). Would definitely cut the oil amount in half. There is also room for improvement by adding some chopped onion possibly.

So delicious!!!!! Only thing I did differently was add some diced tomatoes to the stuffing. I followed another reviewers suggestion of how to cook in the oven :Baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 7 minutes and broiled for another 5....divine!!!

Excellent! Used sliced large caps and tossed with sliced red peppers before putting on a stainless steel grilling pan. Continued brushing occasionally as they roasted over low/med heat while the steaks grilled next to them! This would work well for baby port's or as the recipe calls for - whole large ones. Next time will try adding green, yellow or orange peppers and maybe onions or aspargus!

From the reviews I read, I guess I was expecting MORE flavor.  It was definitely good, but I have had better grilled portobello mushrooms through marinating with a balsamic vinegar/oil/onion/herbs - type marinade.  Ideally, we could combine the two.  Or perhaps moreof the pepper/garlic mixture.  I did cut the salt in half, as other reviewers suggested.  Don't get me wrong, this recipe is good, but not so much that my mushroom-wary DH would eagerly eat it!  IF you're a mushroom lover, I do suggest you try it, I'd hate for you to miss out!

So easy and yet so good.  I used full recipe for filling for just two large portobellos.  Next time, I will add cheese at the end.  Served with brown rice -- an excellent veg dish!

I made this recipe last night as a side dish with grilled pork tenderloin.  We all loved this preparation and will definitely make it again.  The only change I made was to add a splash of balsamic vinegar as suggested by another review.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Great recipe!  I added some paprika, bread-crumbs & parmesan cheese, sprayed portobellos with cooking spray on both sides and baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  I took them out of the oven, raised the temp to broil, covered the caps with mozzarella cheese and baked for 5-7 more minutes.  Served over caesar salad.  Heavenly!

Although they looked nice and were simple to make, I found them too oily and not that flavourful. Some herbs (maybe rosemary) and something acidic, as well as a reduced amount of olive oil might have improved the flavour for me.

Not a bad recipe. Instead of grilling i sprayed a baking sheet with some cooking spray and cooked the mushrooms in a oven at 400 degrees for about 15-20. The 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper didnt work well for my four mushrooms. Next time i'll be using 2 red bell peppers.

Yummy! Made some changes...I added about 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar to the marinade and this really made the flavor! I topped mine with sauteed onion and garlic (instead of bell pepper), and covered the top with shredded parmesan. I baked in the oven on foil for about 15 mins on 375 until the cheese was melty. Even my carnivore boyfriend loved them!

BLAND although I poured the onion powder, garlic, and black pepper on the gills and let it sit overnight.  This recipe NEEDS balsamic vinegar and thyme.  I won't make this again unless I alter the recipe to match the Portobello Sandwich recipe on this site.

I followed the recipe exactly and although my family enjoyed it, we all felt that it was way too salty.  

I will definitely make this one again but use maybe half the salt.  

Very yummy dish!

After reading other reviews, we modified by mixing the red pepper mixture with about 1/3 cup of goat cheese. The mushrooms were fantastic!

The mushroom was good. I also baked it in the oven instead of the grill. I would suggest adding feta cheese or the such instead of salt to play more on texture. Also I added onions as well.

Unsure of how this would taste and turn out, I tried it. Let me just say that they were a hit! My cousin, who does not eat mushrooms, ate them and thought they were fabulous! I was asked for the recipe by numerous people. This recipe is a definate keeper. I put them in the oven rather than the grill cause it was just easier at the time. Can't wait to make them again... perhaps I will stuff them with crab or shrimp in the mix...

I've never made portobello mushrooms before, and this recipe was very easy to follow (not much of a cook) and delicious! Although I think I followed the measurements exactly, I didn't have enough filling for all of the caps. I brought a leftover to work the next day and it looked and smelled gourmet! I highly recommend this.

These were absolutely awesome.  I used green and red bell pepper as well as fat free mozzarella cheese.  These were sooo tasty.  We'll make them over and over again.

delicious and easy! the only problem i had was picking out appropriate mushrooms. i'm still new to certain types of produce, so 2 out of my four mushrooms were under ripe and lacked that 'mushroomy flavor' - though they were still delicious.

Very tasty.  I love to find new things to grill out and this is a great late dinner summer dish.  I threw on a mix of shredded mozarella and some parmesan in the last 10 minutes with a little fresh basil on top melted into the cheese.

Yum! I love mushrooms but I've never tried portabello mushrooms until now. I didn't have a grill, so I took another user's advice to bake for 7 minutes at 350 and broil for 5 more minutes. I also cut up one of the stems and added it to the mixture and added a splash of balsamic vinaigrette which added a really nice taste to it. After all was done baking/broiling, I sprinkled some Romano cheese on top of the mushrooms (I wanted to use Parmesan on top and bake it in a little bit, but I didn't have any. I will try that next time!) Can't wait to make it again!

This is ok as written, but it really needs some modifications to make it yummy. Good base recipe, but honestly it's a bit surprising to see all these 5* reviews when it looks like most people have modified it to be 5*-worthy.

Very very good.  My mother-in-law says she used 1 teaspoon salt (I never see her pull out her measuring spoons).  They were way too salty.  Either measure very accurately or wait to put salt on once done.

THIS RECIPE IS EXCELLENT.  I HAVE MY HUSBAND HOOKED ON THESE MUSHROOMS.  THE ONLY THING I DO DIFFERENT IS I ONLY USE 1/2 TSP OF SALT AND THE REST IS ADDED AT THE TABLE IF NEEDED (I FOUND THEM TOO SALTY THE FIRST FEW TIMES)

This was excellent!  This is the first time I have cooked portobello mushrooms.  I added some melted butter to the sauce, and had to use sliced mushrooms instead of the caps (because that's what I had!) but it turned out great!  We will DEFINATELY be making this again!

Very yummy.  This was my first time trying this type of mushroom.  I was a little scared!!!   We had BBQ t-bones with these mushrooms and it made the dinner more elegant.  I followed the recipe exactly but the mushrooms I had were about 4 inches across.  I only had two of them and the mixture covered the two perfectly!!  Thanks Michael!!!    Michele, cambridge ontario

i made just one mushroom and made enough sauce for 2 mushrooms.  it made it really juicy and it was really good.  i also cooked it stem side down for 5 minutes like others suggested.
pretty tasty as i don't really like to eat mushrooms that often.

Great recipe! I absolutely loved it! My 3 year old son even ate some and loved it. The only thing I will do differently next time is to make the mushroom a little more crispy. I prefer mine crunchier. Other than that it was amazing!

I have made this for years.  You can use any toppings on the portobello.  In the summer, I top with a healthy bread slice of eggplant, beefsteak tomato, fresh basil and mozzarella.  Winter time, I use thinly smoke salmon sliced onion topped with homemade pesto.  Once the portobello is cooked, anything can go on top.  I love to experiment with flavor combos.

Awesome Recipe! Have made it a few times in the last 2 weeks! I altered it and used fresh onion, I also added a little goat cheese feta on the top for a little extra flavour. added a really nice little touch.  Absolutely something you can toy with and add your own little flare too! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I used two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Other than that, followed the recipe as written.  Delicious!!!  Will make again!

Did not have red bell pepper, so used green. Grilled 5 minutes longer than recipe called for.  Used dried onions instead of powdered onion. Drizzled olive oil over back of mushroom and over top. Absolutely delicious!!!  Yes I will make again.  This can be used as your main dish also

Insanely good.  I baked them on a cookie sheet at 350 until they were dark like in the pictures.  I also added tomatoes in the red bell pepper mixture and served with rice.  HIGHLY recommend

Very tasty meal! And very forgiving. I added the mushroom stems,  and cooked them with onions, garlic,  jalapeno pepper in some olive oil. Also added basil, tomato, parmesan cheese to mixture. I put mixture on mushroom, added a splash of Balsamic vinegar. We cooked them on the grill and added provolone cheese at the end and cooked until melted. Absolutely delicious, Michael. Thank you for sharing!

These were fantastic! I used a whole pepper, added some red onion and sautéed the filling earlier in the day.  Then I added breadcrumbs and balsamic vinegar to the filling as it didn't look like I was going to have enough filling for the caps. Topped it off with Parmesan cheese before grilling. Everyone raved about these babies. Don't forget to scrape out the gills before filling!

Grill stem side down on alum foil 5 mins., turn & top with sautéed onion & red pepper in olive oil, Italian seasoning. WOW it up with drizzled balsamic dressing. Shredded provolone, feta or mozza plus a little grated Parmesan.  Bake about 20 mins. @ 350. Serve with steak sauce.

These looked good, but we didn't like them. Way too much salt & pepper & hardly any taste from the peppers. I think the Portobellos would taste better with a sweeter taste - say some roasted red peppers, capers, and maybe some goat cheese. I love grilled Portobellos, but won't be making this again.

This was a great recipe. I did not  have onion powder so I used 1 cut up onion and I put Parmesan cheese on top of them. They turned out great.  I will definitely make these again.

Brushed on the oil and spice mixture, placed the portabella on the grill and 15 minutes later it was perfect. Don't change a thing!

This was a very good recipe, thanks for sharing!  I did what others suggested and grill stem side down first then flip over and add stuffing.  Also added the stems as part of the stuffing and a tbsp. of balsamic vinegar for added flavor.  We love cheese so I added shredded mozzarella cheese on top and melted.  This was a different delight than marinara sauce recipes!

Excellent dish.  Cooked for 5 mins on grill with gills down before flipping and adding the sauce.   Came out a little salty, would use 3/4 teaspoon next time

I thought this recipe was great! There is a bit too much pepper but other then that, it is very tasty and I would definitely make it again but with less pepper. I followed what others were saying and baked at 350 for 7 min then broiled for 5min. I also omitted the oil and instead used a good amount of cooking spray and some water. I took a photo but its too small for them to let me upload it. Looks colorful and nice.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I've tried some of the other suggestions here.  Either way they were all good so if you don't feel comfortable experimenting a little feel free to fix it exactly as the recipe calls for and you won't go wrong! We love, love, love this recipe!!  Thank you Michael for submitting this wonderful delicacy.

I grabbed some portobello mushrooms spur of the moment on my last grocery shopping expedition. I wanted to grill them, but didn't have a specific recipe in mind. Allrecipes to the rescue, as usual. I found this recipe and followed a couple of reviewers recommendations: 1) grilling the non-gill side of the mushrooms for five minutes before adding the mixture, and 2) adding some balsamic vinegar to the mixture for added flavor. Then, I added one idea of my own, a little basil from our deck herb garden. And what a great flavor explosion it was. Excellent, and highly recommended!

My family and I really loved these (next time I will use a bit less salt).  I agree that a little grilling with stem side down, after flipping, fill the center with the filling.  I also topped with just a little shredded cheese.  So delicious!!!

I was really prepared to like this recipe a lot, but unfortunately I found that the taste of the red pepper was completely lost in the flavor of the portobellos.  I think marinating the peppers in a balsamic vinegar and seasonings first would do wonders for this dish.

I had never prepared these mushrooms before and decided to try it. My husband and I loved it! I did not have any red pepper but they were outstanding without them. I am making them again this evening.

Very simple yet looks gourmet. I used sliced baby bellas. I baked them on 350 for 7 min then broiled for 5 more. So good! I want to try with a little balsamic next time.

AWESOME!  So simple to throw together and so full of flavor.  Used roasted red peppers out of a jar and did the bake/broil option and it was wonderful.  Next time want to do raw red pepper to begin and maybe add the splash of balsamic like one other reviewer did.  A keeper for sure!

Used the bake on 350 for 7 minutes and broil for 5 cooking method and added a sprinkling of fresh parmesan in the last 2 minutes.  So YUMMY!  You could easily use less oil without missing it.  Cheese probably wasn't necessary either, but I love the extra layer of flavor.

Excellent recipe...we used green peppers as pictured, skipped using the stems, and added shredded cheese(mozz). Yummy and a nice side for pork chops.

These were absolutely wonderful!  My 12 year old son finished the mushroom before anything else on his plate!!  I followed the recipe, but also added a little bit of balsamic vinaigrette to the mixture before spooning onto the  mushrooms.  This gave them a bit more zing!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent!  I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar as mentioned by others and I definitely think it added to the flavor.  Will make again.  Next time I think I will use just a little less salt, but overall, they were great.

the recipe was pretty good. i made a few modifications though just for personal taste. i used green peppers instead of red peppers and added some crushed red peppers for an extra spicy tinge. i also added a splash of basalmic vinegratte. i followed another user's advice of baking at 350 for 7 mins and then 5 mins in the broiler...turned out delicious!!

I made this as an app. while camping.  I was confused about spreading the mixture on the grill side of the mushroom because I wanted the red pepper to be on them while they cooked.  I just dipped them in the oil mixuter and I put pieces of the red pepper on the "gill" side so they would cook up a bit too.  Very yummy!

Excellent recipe! Just cooked and ate. The taste is still lingering in my mouth :-) Used the bake method as suggested by some other reviewers. It was easy and did not make a mess. Personally not fond of too much salt and only used a pinch but it still tasted great. Did not have any red peppers so replaced with some red chilli, minced it up really finely. My mushrooms were really huge (each about 7 inches in diameter) and took about 60 minutes to bake.
