This is a fantastic antipasto recipe!  Easy to make and loaded with flavor.  I serve this as an appetizer with pieces of sliced baguette on the side.  Really delicious!

As per other reviewers, I used kalamata olives instead of black olives.  Also, I used extra sharp provolone cheese in big chunks, and white balsamic vinegar too.  These were my only substitutions.  Everybody loved this salad!

This was really good and an excellent offering to take camping as it holds well in the cooler and does get better upon sitting, even after four days.  I put everything in a zip-lock bag and didn't even bother with turning/manipulating it.  I just left it alone and everything seemed to marinate evenly.  I did use white balsamic vinegar found at Trader Joe's so everything maintained their own lovely color.  I added a chopped fuji apple for added crunch/texture as well as little cubes of calabrese (hot/spicy salami) and dried cranberries as suggested by another user to help balance the tang. To bump it up a notch, it tastes even better if you toast the baguette slices in a skillet with a little olive oil just prior to serving. This is a very adaptable and forgiving recipe that the whole family enjoyed, even the kids.  Thank you for sharing it with us.

Since I was "pot-lucking" this and not serving/garnishing, I added the basil to the dressing.  Because some in the group don't tolerate oregano well, I substituted thyme.  I couldn't find smoked provolone, so used regular and it worked fine.  After dicing 1/2 lb. of provolone it looked like enough, so I didn't add the remaining 1/2 lb.  Everyone loved it!

This is a versatile salad. I didn't use marinated artichokes, I used canned, drained artichokes & so didn't have a problem with excess liquid. I also didn't measure the oil & vinegar, just used my own judgement on the amount needed. I added some cherry tomatoes & upped the oregano a bit but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It makes a great topping for bruschetta & I think it would be really nice served over grilled chicken or fish. Thanks, Chellebelle:o)

Sounds delish, is there anyway to make this "heart healthy", like maybe reduce the sodium?  All suggestions welcome and greatly appreciated.

Substituted marinated Greek olives ( also used pimento stuffed olives) for black olives which we don't like. Made way too much for one loaf of bread,  then had left overs and the cheese in the wet salsa was not good the next day. However it was a raving good salsa for the bruschetta we made if eaten immediately. We tried making bruschetta by browning 1/4" diagonally-sliced baguette sprayed with butter under broiler but burned. So we added olive oil and butter to a fry pan and turned the baguette pieces in fry pan til golden and they were spectacular.Can control beautiful coloring with constant supervision. Serve bread warm and salsa room temp

I really like this and everyone that tasted it wanted the recipe.  I used part smoked and part regular provolone.  Instead of putting it in a jar to marinate, I used a plastic bag and shook it periodically.  That way, everything got covered with the yummy liquid.

This is a very adaptable recipe. I added diced pepperoni, and used white pear-infused balsamic vinegar. As another member said, the white helps the ingredients maintain their coloring. The pear is very, very light and really only serves to take a tiny bite off of the vinegar. I also did not add the artichoke oil (too distinctive in flavor), and added a little less olive oil.

Great hit at dinner party!  I couldn't get smoked provolone, but san simon and rofumo cheeses were excellent substitutions (cheesemonger recommendation). Also, for more visual/flavor variety, I added sliced hearts of palm and kalamata, and green olives. Thanks!

I brought this as an appetizer to a potluck babyshower.  Everyone loved it. I could not find smoked provolone so sub'd smoked mozzarella & smoked white cheddar. Worked out great.

I made this for New Year's Eve as an appetizer and it was a big hit.  Made one change and used green olives instead of black.  One of the eaters commented that it would make a great salad.  Since I had an event that I needed to bring a salad to a few days later, I used this as a salad and it was a huge hit there too.  I couldn't get smoked provelone the second time so I used a smoked mozzarella and it was perfect.

I thought the flavor of this salad was really good, however the amount of liquid is way too much.  I left out the oil and would only use half of the oil from the artichokes next time.  Roasted my own peppers, subbed pepperoncini peppers and cubed pepperoni for the black olives and ended up tossing the salad with fresh spinach leaves just to use up the "juice." Flavors were good though, thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.  I didn't add the provolone since I didn't have any. I substituted green olives.  I used fresh oregano and added extra garlic ... just because.  I took it to a party and brough none back!

Different and easy to make.  I think it would be better to slice up the olives, and be sure to leave the provolone cubed in 1 inch cubes, not diced.

I made this as a starter for a party and it was wonderful. I added chunks of pepperoni and a jar of green olives, and I also used two cans of non-marinated artichoke hearts. I will definitely make this again.

Great if you love olives and vinegar! I also added Sons of Italy marinated mushrooms without the brine. I made this for Christmas. Two days later I made it again at a guest's request. The first time I made it I chopped the ingredients in bite-sized chunks. The second time I chopped the ingredients into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces were better. This permitted more of a variety of items on the cracker and made for more graceful eating. Thanks for the great recipe. It is a keeper!

I prepared this recipe based on my love for balsamic vinegar.  This was extremely easy and fast.  I was a bit concerned about the appearance after I mixed in the vinegar and everything turned brown; it didn't look very appetizing.  I served it anyway and received such rave reviews.  I had to give copies of this recipe to at least 4 people.  I am glad I prepared it and it will definitely go into by "do again" category.

This is very good, and yes--it gets better with time. It makes a TON, so if you dont want a ton of it, you could easily cut it in half. I "pulsed" the artichokes, olives, and peppers in my food processor and added the cheese chunks after. It came out like a chunky tapanade. I also cut out the extra olive oil because the artichokes had a ton of liquid/oil already and I didnt see the point of adding more oil. It was excellent without it. I, too, thought a pound of cheese was way too much, so I used about 8oz of smoked provolone. The addition of the cheese is a must. I served it on warm baguette, but crackers would be great too. All-in-all, this is very tasty.

Delicious!  As another reader suggested, I left out the olive oil since the artichokes contained oil.  Besides that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It definitely is better the next day.

We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. I do advise, as other have also, to cut the cheese amount in half. Also it does not indicate whether one should use water packed or oil packed artichokes. Go for the oil packed, but drain and set aside the oil. Then add the olive oil to the reserved liquid (or the olive oil first and then reserved marinade) and add into the mixture to taste. Some people prefer less liquid, like me. I'd also go easy on the balsamic. I used a cheese with a salt and pepper rind. Yummy. If you want to make Bruscetta, buy sliced black olives instead of whole and cut all ingredients to pea-sized pieces.

This recipe is a good start however I altered the recipe a bit.  I thought 1 lb of cheese was way too much.  And I substituted smoked mozzerella because it's what I had on hand.  I did not use the olive oil.  It's really not needed since there is oil in the marinated artichokes.  And I did not add any basil, salt or pepper.

Great flavor!  I used the left overs for a salad topper the next day.

I should suggest adding 100g of white seedless raisins to balance the salty and peppery flavours in this recipe.

I loved this recipe. I used it as an appetizer with baguette bread. I had to use meunster cheese (could not find smoked provolone.) This recipe made a lot even though I scaled it down for 6 people. It was still good to eat 5 days later. VERY easy and looks special for guests. I will make again!

I served this for a New Year's Eve gathering and everyone liked it.  I think next time I'll use a different cheese; I wasn't nuts about the smoked flavor of the provolone.

I added about 2 table spoons  of capers and sprinkled Feta on top when served. We thought it was fab.
