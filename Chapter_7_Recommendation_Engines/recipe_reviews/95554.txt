This recipe was awesome.  I made the corn balls to go with easy cheesey soup.  We ended up putting the corn ball in the bowl and then poured the soup over it.  It was absolutely outstanding.

I make these, but add the larger (15 oz) can of creamed corn and only 1/2 cup of water.  Additionally, I add 4 TBSP melted butter and 3 beaten eggs.  Once the balls are made, then pour 1/2 cup melted butter/margarine over them before baking.  They are very good and the perfect side-dish for the family who never has enough stuffing.

I baked the balls for about 10 min. longer than suggested because they still seemed very mushy.  I served them like a roll with soup, and they were very good.  Next time I may try adding some other flavors, like garlic, cheese and rosemary perhaps.

I thought these were very good.  I substitued a bag of dried seasoned stuffing mix with the bread crumbs and rolled the balls in butter instead of just brushing the tops. I would make these again.

This is pretty close to my Grandmothers recipe that she put in her local church recipe book in 1991.  I love this recipe, my Grandmothers recipe varied a little with the amounts of food but overall it's a great addition to any Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter Dinner!  We have them every year...the whole family in CO, MD, VA and PA! Must try!

I loved them.  They reminded me of my Grandma's stuffing.  They were fun and easy for the kids to make.
