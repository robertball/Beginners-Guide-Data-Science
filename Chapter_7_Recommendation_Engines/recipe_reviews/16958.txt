The only thing is, you can't drain your cherries. The dough has to have some liquid and the cherry juice will do that for you.

The dough was extremely dry since there was no liquid, BUT with the addition of 3/4 to 1 cup of water the bread turned out perfect.

What a disappointment!  Neither the cherry nor the almond flavor was identifiable in this bread and it had just a vague sort of sweetish flavor.  The color was unattractive as well.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it had a nice texture.

It's a good start, but I agree that it needs work.  The texture was really chewy and pleasing.  It was hard for me because I don't have a bread machine, so I had to guess about cooking time/temp and it came out kind of dark on top.  Also, I mixed with my cuisenart and the cherries got totally pulverized, so when I make it again (I will make it again) I might throw in some dried cherries, so we can get those bursts of cherry flavor.  Anyway, I will try it again!

This was another one that turned into a surprise for me...I changed due to what I had...no gluten,and only a 15 oz can pitted dark bing cherries and pecan "chips" maybe 1/2 cups worth.Set on the sweet bread cycle...and it wasn't looking very promising at all...but I decided to let it go and sure enough,by what ended up seeming like a freak accident it right at the end raised up into a beautiful loaf or bread while on the bake cycly and tasted fantastic!I will make it again.

I made this according to the recipe, without modification, except that I could not find sour cherries at my grocery store, so I used a can of sweet cherries instead. I expected the cherries to stay intact in this recipe, but instead they were mashed in the kneading, so there were no chunks of cherry in the final bread; rather they were incorporated into the bread. The bread came out exceedingly dense; it felt like a brick when it came out of the pan. But even worse--it did not bake all the way through. The flavor was ok, not as cherry-ish nor as almondy as I was expecting and hoped for. I ate a couple slices of this toasted with butter for breakfast, but I got to the middle of the loaf and realized it wasn't cooked all the way through.

This tasted like plain old white bread.  No cherry taste detected, almonds really didn't add any new dimension to the bread.  We ate it as sandwich bread.
