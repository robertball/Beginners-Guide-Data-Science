I made these this morning for my sister who is gluten intolerant. I used Bob's Red Mill 1-1 gluten free flour. I also subbed lemon zest for lemon extract (didn't have any), and unsweetened vanilla almond milk  for the half and half (to help with the carbs and fat), otherwise exactly as written. The recipe made 4 very tasty waffles, topped with sliced ripe summer peaches and a bit of syrup. My sister took the recipe home because we all enjoyed them so much. Thank you, Kim, for a recipe that was easy to make gluten free and lighter for my diabetic granddaughter.
