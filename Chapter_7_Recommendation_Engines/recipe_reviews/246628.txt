This is a classic Italian recipe.  My family is from the Italian Alps and use Dairy products profusely in cooking.  This is a go to for me when I have left over pasta.  Use SALTED BUTTER and FRY pasta in butter until crispy (takes about 10-15 mins) and then add black pepper.  It’s a great stand alone or side dish.  BTW, I freeze our extra pasta over time and when I have enough saved I fry it up. This doesn’t require all of the pasta to be the same (linguine, penne, spaghetti, etc) all marry well and are used in one simple and delicious dish.

Super simple and quick to make! If you're a college student like I am, this is a thousand times better than ramen! 
I just added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes to add some heat and voíla!

This dish is easy to make, and it's delicious! I bought a Kitchenaid Pasta Press, and I have been experimenting with a variety of recipes. This one is a keeper! I added Aleppo pepper at the end for a bit of heat. A good quality olive oil is a must for this recipe. I use extra virgin olive oil from California Olive Ranch.  For this recipe, I used the mild and buttery profile.  I buy a wedge of pecorino romano and grate it myself. The recipe is really good with store bought spaghetti, but fresh spaghetti takes it over the top!

This is a variation on the classic Roman dish except the Romans  don't add garlic. The name is cacio e pepe: cheese and pepper. The addition of garlic changes the dish but it is still tasty. This was a Friday night meal in our house growing up. It is meatless and inexpensive. Thanks for submitting your rendition.

We're Italian. This is the way an Italian recipe should be: simple with the right ingredients. Don't add or subtract anything, just use genuine oil and cheese.  Butter in not in the original recipe.

I made a huge mistake when I made this. I made it with thin wheat spaghetti. I should have used regular so unless you want a mucky mess, use regular spaghetti.

Thank you for this recipe! I'm having one of those, no money till payday what can I make with stuff already in my kitchen, type of days. I wasn't able to make this exact. But it turned out great. I had penne not spaghetti. I didn't have any garlic. I had grated parmesan and shredded parmesan. I added some leftover sautéed peppers and onions to the oil. Then I added in the noodles, cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and more black pepper. I ate this with some leftover chicken and steamed broccoli. I wasn't able to make exact but this recipe saved the day!

Very tasty. Easy & quick to make. Goes good with a nice Pinot Grigio. 
Note: When adding the Romano, add only a little at a time, allowing each addition to melt. Otherwise it melts into a big glob.

Simple goodness on a plate.  I have made this as a quick dinner for myself and wife a few times and it never disappoints.  Sometimes I add some extra vegetation, but as a whole, this recipe is great as is.

Used linguini instead of spaghetti. This is a very simple recipe that demands high quality ingredients, so I would recommend using freshly-ground black pepper and fresh pasta. We both really enjoyed this dish. While it was certainly rich, the cheese sauce wasn't overpowering. I did add some additional pepper at the table.

It's quick, easy, and delicious. I remember making this while I was in a bad mood. Usually cooking while stressed just makes me angrier, but this dish was so simple and easy, it actually made me less stressed. And it's absolutly to die for.

I have to say, though, if you make this, please, please PLEASE use a pepper grinder. The sawdust you buy preground at the store will not to it justice. You can use the cheapest noodles, oil, and cheese if you want. A pepper grinder may be a bit pricey, but it lasts such a long time and you'll save money by refilling it! Just please use a pepper grinder. PLEASE! Fresh pepper is the only way!

Edit: My boyfriend gave this a try, and we found adding a mixture of cornflower and water (to a thick liquid constancy, not a paste) to the pasta with the cheese turns it into a wonderful sauce, especially if you add too much cheese. If you have cornflower laying around the house, and are finding that the cheese is too clumpy, try it out.

Very good dish.  I think it definitely calls for red pepper flake and next time I make it, I think that I will add some chicken.  Not sure if that changes it to be an entirely different dish, but I feel like it needs a protein.

This was easy and very fast. The only change I made was the cheese. I only had fresh parmesean cheese so I used that. It was tasty and fast so what more do you want? When I rewarmed it the next day, the cheese was sticky so I added some water and some marinara sauce to compensate for the extra water. But great!

SO much greater than the sum of its parts! This blew me away. Make sure you save plenty of pasta cooking water, mine needed a lot more than the recipe calls out in order to make a proper "sauce".

A pound of dried spaghetti was way too much!   And, the cheese just clumped up when I stirred it in until I finally broke it apart to make create a sauce (which broke my spaghetti into unappealing shards).  It tasted amazing, though!  I think that the next time, I'll use just 1/2 pound of spaghetti, add the spaghetti water first and then stir the cheese into the hot mixture that already includes the water.

This is a good dish. In stead of just plain pasta water,  add 1 Table spoon of Chicken Better  than Bouillon to 1 1/2 C hot  pasta water, add to the already cooked garlic and pepper, simmer then add pasta, cheese and shredded Basil.  It’s a meal!

This is so freaking good. It’s a great weeknight hack for when you don’t have time (or patience) to make mac n’ cheese. Super easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand. The garlic and olive oil really make this dish (and the cheese too, obviously.) I didn’t have enough grated cheese, so I added some shaved Parmesan and it was wonderful. Next time I’ll add red pepper flakes!

Added venison steak, browned in olive oil with fresh basil and crushed garlic. Had to reduce the pepper, and screwed up the cheese, but it was still delicious!

I made this exactly as written except I only used half the amount of pepper and angel hair instead of spaghetti.  We really liked the flavor but it was tough to use the long noodles.  I will make this again but with a different noodle.

We make it with fresh, chopped parsley as my husband, who lived in Milan for several years learned. Adding the water makes it more moist.

The premise is good.  Recipe states simple is not bland.  This recipe is nothing but bland.  Pasta and olive oil.  Increase garlic from 2 cloves to about 10, add in a little basil, marjoram, oregano and crushed pepper flakes and you will have something.

I think that this was a easy and quick recipe, not easy to mess up, but I did anyways! I added oregano, parsley, pepper flakes, and basil. I added a little too much pepper flakes, so it was a little spicier than I expected. But it was good anyways. I also added a little extra cheese, not that it needed it, just my opinion. Would make again, it was tasty!

This was an easy meal to make. Since the premise is to use what you have handy, I used some rotini and small penne shells. I also added sautéed kale to the pan. This was delicious and I look forward to making it again and adding some other mystery ingredient/s.

I cut the recipe in half, and substituted feta for 1/4 of the traditional cheese.  Added sautéed fresh shrimp just before serving.  My partner couldn't get enough.  Good stuff:-)

My mother made this when I was growing up as one of my favorite comfort foods, but never knew what it was called. 

It's so satisfying on it's own, but is also great with small additions like fresh tomatoes, basil or chicken. 

Makes a great side dish as well.

This is a perfect recipte for Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe.  I ate this all though Italy so have tasted it many times.  This is spot on and really is a nice and flavorful compliment to any entree.  Glad to have found it.   Simple but perfect!

I remember my grandmother making this years ago.  Never used butter, just a great olive oil and used 4 or 5 garlic cloves.  While the garlic was sautéing in the hot oil, she would add   anchovies to the oil.   A small amount is all that is necessary...or more if you like.  All very good.  Great recipe!

Be sure when making this dish, that you add liquid and spaghetti to garlic oil before adding the cheese. I noticed another cook had same experience I had by adding cheese first and it seezed up into a big clump and I had a heck of a time melting it into a sauce. I used angle hair pasta and it was ready in a snap! And yes, it took double the pasta water to make a nice sauce. I also doubled the garlic. It was delicious!

I had a terrible time making this meal.  I heated the oil over medium heat and the garlic immediately burned.  I threw that out and started over.  I didn’t even try to sauté the garlic this time.  I only used half the cheese.  It all clumped together and was impossible to stir into the pasta.  Never again!

I saw this recipe and thought this is easy to cook this morning and have my cooking out of the way. I had a half box linguini, some Cabot Sharp cheese, organic garlic from Wal-Mart that is already chopped up. I did not grate that much cheese because it was smelling so good and I was getting hungry. I added about a cup of the linguini liquid, stirred and ate breakfast. I don't usually do that, but myohmy! DELICIOUS!

The amount of oil is twice as much as you need. If you like the flavor of buttter, you can use it instead, or maybe half butter and half olive oil. You also don’t need but a cup of cheese. It is good with red pepper flakes, and you can add pancetta, prosciutto, sautéed chicken or shrimp, add a salad and there’s a complete meal.

super simple, use this as a baseline for all your creations.  I'm lazy, so I tend to make the pasta, while it's boiling saute the garlic, some frozen onions, frozen broccoli florets, scoop out some water while the pasta is still cooking, throw it in with the other stuff sautéing , drain most of the water out of the pasta when it's done, and throw everything in the pot used to boil the pasta, stir it up, ready to go...if I were cooking for company I would take more time, use fresh, but for me, works great, taste close to the same.  i also throw a scoop of giardeneria in my bowl of pasta...

The problem with the cheese here is it clumps.  I would use mostly grana padano.  Use 1/4 cup of pecorino romano after taken off of heat...  this will make it more flavorful.

Wonderful base recipe.  My husband's Italian family does a little variation.  A combination of oil and butter and black olives, sometimes adding fresh mushrooms.  I'll have to try the Panchetta.  Always good! Thanks

Used whiter pepper and parmesan cheese, with a small spoon of cream cheese to make it a tad thicker. It was absolutely delicious! At first, I thought I had things a bit wrong and had to add a lot more of salt than I'm used to (used pink salt), but in the end, it was cheesy and spicy, everything was perfectly harmonized!  My first recipe from this website and it did not disappoint!

Made it exactly as written and it was great! I actually ground whole black peppercorns in a mortar/ pestle and it was nice and peppery!

This was good.  Served as a side with stuffed chicken breast.  Our guests seemed to like it but I can't see it being the star of the show.  For me the cheese was a little heavy and I feel the red pepper flakes were a necessity.

A simple and delicious side dish.  It does require some vigorous mixing being the cheese kinda gloms up and use plenty of hot pasta water as recipe and reviews suggest. Pasta will suck it up in a few hours anyway.

A tasty, simple, inexpensive dish. My family lives it! I add a little extra garlic and use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter to suit our taste. Add a green salad and you have dinner for 4 under $10. I also like switching half the Romano cheese for Fontina cheese.

This was delicious.  I used parmesan-reggiano and the taste was great.  2 tsp of black pepper is on the money.  I really enjoyed this and never knew it was SO easy.  I used 2 ladles of pasta water and about 2 Cups of cheese.  Will make it again.

Utter Italian comfort food.  You can skip the frying if you roast your garlic and keep it in the fridge -- mash up a few cloves with a fork and toss with the  hot pasta.

Yummy!!! We made this, with a few changes, based on other recipes I had read. I used butter instead of olive oil, just for the creaminess. Then, we used bucatini pasta, instead of spaghetti, for a heartier bite. I also split the cheese and used 1 cup Romano and 3/4 Parmesan. Gotta say this is a keeper and SO much better than the cacio e Pepe I recently had in New York at an “authentic Italian” restaurant. I can also say that, while it’s perfect on its own, you could add any number of things to this dish, like shrimp, pancetta, a little veg, etc just for kicks and giggles.

I make  something similar but for heart healthy and calorie count I used whole wheat spaghetti, sautéed garlic, low fat margarine (to desired sauciness). 310 calories, 5 gm fat, 6 grams fiber. The olive oil overwhelmed the taste and the butter tasted exactly the same as margarine. I use Asiago cheese but essentially the same recipe.

Gave it 5 stars because it turned out perfect and it's super easy.  I used about 1 cup romano and the rest was a shredded Italian blend.  My daughter loved it, but too strong of cheese for me still.  I will try it again with just the Italian blend.  I guess I'm picky, as I don't care for mac and cheese either, that's too bland.

Sounds like you made a quick Roman sauce and used black pepper instead of salt. I make something similar and it's a delicious, quick and healthy easy recipe, especially if you use multigrain pasta (or something like Barilla: Protein plus).

I made it with Penne, and fresh cracked pepper- it was awesome!! And if you are new to cooking, and think parmesan will work instead of pecorino romano - it won't!! I made it nice cuz I made it twice. :)

Pesto is my favorite sauce.  However, I've been feeling guilty about how often I've made the rest of the clan enjoy one pesto dish after another.  So, I was VERY thrilled when I tried this recipe and it turned out to be SO good!  Even the pickiest eaters at the table enjoyed it.

Thank you for sharing what has now become my second favorite "treatment" to do to pasta.  This dish was very good and, even though I was nervous the first time I tried it, it turned out to be pretty easy to make as well.  I made this as directed and served it with steamed vegetables and some grilled chicken with red onions.  This will definitely be in our regular dinner rotation.

Great recipe just like it is,  a light fast  plain version of carbonara.  Will definitely make again, maybe next time add mushrooms or cherry tomatoes. Possibilities are endless.

Super easy but so delicious.  definitely use fresh cracked black pepper and if you like pepper use a larger grind it makes a big difference.  Ive made it more than once and I have even added some grilled shrimp on the side  with the same flavors and yummy a very satisfying meal.  The hubby loves it either way.

Once pan got hot I poured about 1/3 c Chardonnay in pan, reduced then added 1/2 butter 1/2 evoo,5 cloves garlic, some red pepper flakes with the black pepper. Followed recipe from there. It was excellent with the wine adding a depth of flavor. I can also see adding many other items like sautéed veggies or protein. Very versatile.

Simple, yet flavorful, just like the claim. Stirring through a pound of spaghetti and cheese was a little tough, but it was a hit with my family, especially the kids.

Definitely a keeper recipe! Next time I will make 3 adjustments. I will use butter instead of a light oil. I will add Mizithra cheese, sprinkled on top and I might add a fresh herb; such as chopped parsley or a favorite herb.  Delicious!!

Delisioso. This is a more basic version of Pasta Carbonara. For that, add 3 eggs (beaten) while the spaghetti is hot, (instead of water) along with the pancetta or even bacon. One of my all time favorites.

This is a very simple dish to make. I added more Pecorino Romano, 2 1/2 C total, and 2 T lemon juice when adding the reserved water. I have made this with both olive oil and with butter. The butter option went very well with a poached fish entrée.

I make this often, as a side.  But love to add steamed broccoli and carrots for a meatless main dish.

Have been making this for many years.  Usually use butter and lots of cheese instead of olive oil, that is personal preference.  Makes a quick side dish and even picky eaters like it.

Awesome! Added hot pepper flakes. Max likes as well. Make sure to use actual cheese (not grated) Works better using leftover noodles.

It's very easy to make and my son LOVES it. Just a word of caution, if you're just using Parmesan cheese, the cheese tends to clump when water is added to it. To avoid this from happening too much, I mix the cheese thoroughly and just add a little bit of the water. I had to use Parmesan cheese only because that's all that was in the house, but it still had a nice flavor. I made this dish several times using just Parmesan cheese and other times using  Pecorino Romano  cheese and there wasn't a huge difference between the two.

Made it without the garlic to get the more classic feel, and it was still awesome. I think the quality of the cheese will make a big difference since it is the star of the dish!

Quite good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used fresh cracked pepper but only half the amount - next time I'll go with the full amount.  I think it could also have done with more garlic.  Overall, I'd make this again.

I’ve made a version of this gem for my daughter for years. She was, and still is a mac & cheese girl. I was out of regular mac & cheese, so I made the butter version of this. She was 2 years old in her high chair, looking at it. She looked at me, asking for her mac & cheese. I said “It’s macaroni and shakey cheese” showing her the container of grated cheese I’d used. It was a hit. She’s 25 now, and still calls it Pasta and Shakey Cheese, although today, it’s a hand grated blend of Locatelli and Reggiano. I never did the pasta water, but it looks interesting!

This is so delicious and easy to make. It's so filling as well. I just limited the amount of the garlic and pepper without overdoing it.

This is delicious! I used whole wheat penne rigate since I had no spaghetti, and grated parmesan cheese instead of the pecorino. I also added cooked chopped kale into the final mixing with oil, garlic and pepper, and extra pasta water. I also added some red pepper flakes. Very good vegetarian entrée! I will make this again!

Simple, quick and delicious, just as the Italians do! I made it exactly as written and it received thumbs-up from my 3 and 6-year-olds. The flavors really come together if allowed to sit for a day in the refrigerator. Also, I used bucatini spaghetti, Which gave it a wonderful, firm texture.

I loved it!! I've been making a version of this for years and have never thought to add Pecorino Romano. Mmmm my favourite Italian cheese.
