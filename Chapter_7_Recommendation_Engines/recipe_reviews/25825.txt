Good cookie, I will make them again.  We heavily floured the work surface, hands and rolling pin because the dough was a little difficult to work with (sticky) at first.  But my son and I got the hang of it and I don't think the extra flour took anything away from the flavor or texture and I like it!

I think these may  need more sugar. The looked ok, but the dough was ultra-sticky and it was very difficult to make them. I also used a pampered chef cookie press, and the dough was being really difficult, so I gave up and shaped them with cookie cutters.

I really hate giving negative reviews but in this case I have to.  This cookie is not good.  It's almost like a flavorless sugar cookie that doesn't have enough sugar in it.  I followed the instructions with the exception of sprinkling a little bit of sugar on the top for decoration.  The dough is very sticky, I knew it would be a plain cookie and I didn't want to change it by using more flour, so I used a cookie scoop to portion it on the cookie sheet and then used the bottom of a lightly floured glass to flatten it. It's just really boring and the best thing I can say is that it makes a pretty cookie.  Maybe better with frosting. Sorry.

These were the worst sugar cookies I have ever made. They looked great coming out of the oven but once cooled, they are dry, bland, and have absolutely no flavor. I would not serve these to my own worst enemy. Don't waste your time with these.

I really did not care for this recipe.  The dough came out very, very sticky.  Looking back, it probably needs refrigeration before rolling.  However, I followed the earlier reviewer's advice and just rolled in more flour.  As a result, the cookie came out rather bland and tasted a bit like pie crust....just a touch sweeter and puffier.

A good basic cookie cutter cookie dough. I chilled the dough before rolling it out - it's much easier to manage and less sticky.

I made these cookies and they came out great.  I used butter flavored crisco/shortening instead of just plain though.  Another tip may be to refrigerate dough for an hour or over night to make it easier to handle.  I was able to roll the dough out and use my cookie cutters without any problems.  The cookies tasted great, but would be even better with frosting.

This is the cookie recipe I have been looking for!   It has just the right amount of sweetness and I don't want a butter cookie, just one made with plain Crisco. When you top it with the icing, it is plenty sweet!  As far as rolling it out, I had no problem. I roll it out on a floured pie dough mat, flour the top of the dough, put a piece of wax paper over it and roll it out - quite frankly, I was amazed it didn't stick!  I find I need to do this for anything I roll out to keep from adding a massive amount of flour and becoming tough.    These are like the cookies I had when I was a little girl!  Loved them!  Thanks!

the dough was too sticky for me to roll them out. i had to roll the dough into balls and flatten them on the baking sheet. i'd suggest refrigerating the dough. i didn't have time to. once baked, i thought they were dry. the overall cookie was just OK.
