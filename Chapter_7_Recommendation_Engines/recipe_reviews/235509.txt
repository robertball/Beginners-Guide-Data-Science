I really didn't like this recipe, mostly because I was looking for a shoofly cake that was a wet bottom similar to a pie and this one is very dark but no wet bottom. I am not sure if it was the molasses that I purchased that I didn't like or the recipe but between the two I didn't like the taste of this cake.

Good recipe. I substituted “King” syrup for Molasses because my mother used it. Makes a lighter flavor.

This is a favorite of several family members. It is easy to make and is both allergy and vegan friendly - contains no eggs or dairy and sugar can be substituted for something more vegan like turbinado or coconut sugar.m. It’s also economical and can be made without an electric mixer. Makes a great coffee cake.
