These are way too easy and way too yummy!!! I wasn't expecting to like this nearly as much as I did. Great, quick treat for the kiddos (or the adults, after the kiddos go to bed). Get your campfire s'mores fix indoors, anytime. :)

Ha! I've been making these for about 10 years and didn't know other people did it too! No campfire required. It's a yummy snack any time of year.
