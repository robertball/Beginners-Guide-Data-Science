Made this as is and it was OK. Adding dice jalapenos as stated in the footnotes brought it up to 5 stars. The best way to serve this for those that don't like the heat is to make as written and have some hot sauce on hand for those that do.

Made this tonight. It definitely needs the added optional ingredients. On it's own it's not very good but it's a great base. I added buffalo sauce, blue cheese crumbles, & a dash of seasoned salt for a buffalo style cheese dip. So I averaged my rating to 4 stars because on its own its trying hard for a 3 and with added ingredients its a 5.

Needs lots of flavor but i guess it is a good thing because you can go anyway you want with it!
