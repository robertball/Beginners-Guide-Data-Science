Really loved this recipe -- the tamales took about 1.5hrs to cook, a bit longer than called for, but that could definitely be due to how I steamed them.  I also added the shrimp INTO the tamales...right on top of the corn and the masa.  So fantastic cooked into it like that.  Unfortunately, didn't have more sauce to cover them with after I took them out of the husks, but that's OK because I added sour cream and guacamole...the shrimp could totally stand on its own, btw, was such a great use of the Chipotle cooking sauce.  Great Recipe! A keeper for sure.
