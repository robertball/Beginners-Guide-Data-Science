Liked it! The meat was super-tender and loved the heartiness of the mushrooms and tomatoes. Now to take care of that extra wine! :)

This is very tasty. I didn't make the recipe, but sampled someone else's preparation of it. The cloves are the dominant spice, so if you don't like them, you'll want to scale down the amount.

This stew was OK. I wanted to try something different, and it is that. I added carrots and parsnips as well because I had them on hand. Since the wine is really the only liquid I found it too fruity. My husband (think lumber jack farmer) wasn't really sold on it either. It wasn't "beefy" enough for him. Glad to give it a try though! I just probably won't make it again.
