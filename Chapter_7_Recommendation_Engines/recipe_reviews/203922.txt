I was suspect from the beginning when I read there were 24 tortillas jammed into a 9x13 dish, and I was right. And a cup of cheese to divide among 24 enchiladas and still have enough left over to sprinkle over the top of the dish?  The chicken ran out at about 10 enchiladas, the cheese at 7.  The flavor was ok, but don't believe anything this recipe claims about quantities.

I changed the recipe a bit, I used flour tortillas, mixed up white and dark chicken meat and didn't add the sour cream to the casserole because reheating sour cream is no good... lol

I used less tortillas about a dozen and more cheese... They turned out delicious!

Very good! I roasted 2 chickens and made  homemade cream of chicken soup. Added this to the Herdez green salsa, I also chopped up half a dozen Hatch chilies to add more heat. Thank You Sloppy Girl! Keeper:):)

This was the first time my girlfriend and I had ever made green enchiladas, and they came out EXCELLENT! We loved this recipe and will use it again and again. The dipping of the shells into the sauce allowed for them to be soft and moist without being drowned in the sauce. We loved it!

This is a nice way to make a very quick green chile enchilada dinner, but I was hoping for a recipe, rather than a serving suggestion for canned green chile sauce.  I suppose that adding the shredded zucchini makes it at least a glorified serving suggestion, but it hardly seems like a recipe.  We don't need a recipe to open a can of sauce and put cheese on top. I'm not complaining about starting with a can of sauce, but I expect more than this from a recipe.

I cut the chicken breast into thin strips for faster browning in a skillet with olive oil and a dash of garlic. I shredded the chicken, and used one 29 oz. can of green chilies enchilada sauce with 8 large flour tortillas, in a 9x13 Pyrex dish. I also mixed the Mexican fiesta cheese with shredded quesadilla cheese and used the suggested zucchini. It was great and very easy!

Changed the receipe to more of a cassarole to avoid all the time on rolling corn tortillas and hot oil mess.  
Put green sauce in bottom of pan,  corn tortillas over sauce,  breast meat from store bought rotisserie chicken,  shredded Mexican cheese mix,  grated zucchini,  tortillas over it,  more cheeses and sauce. 
375 for about 30-35 minutes because I like bubbling hot food and melted chesse. It was delicious the next day for breakfast.
