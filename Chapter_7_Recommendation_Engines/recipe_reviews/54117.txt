This recipe is great for a crowd!  I liked it so much, I decided to play around a little to make it a LAZY morning breakfast for TWO (or even one).  I sprayed Butter Flavored Pam into small glass ramekins,  placed 2 slices of precooked “ready” bacon into each cup.  I dropped the egg in and MICROWAVED, on high, for 30 seconds.  I then broke a slice of processed American cheese (use your favorite cheese) into quarters and placed two quarters on top of each egg and microwaved for five more seconds.  Served on a warm buttered English muffin – YUMM!.  Easy, quick, delicious.  (Remember, ovens vary; make a test run first and adjust time to get the yolk consistency you like.)  Thank you Shirley Wheele!

I'm giving it 5 for ease and taste. I will say that I deviate by wrapping the raw bacon in the tins, and baking them for 5 min in the preheated oven, then dropping the egg in, making sure to center the yolk. One pan, no splatter, no precooked bought bacon (which is also tasty, but the real thing is better), and no pregreasing the tins. All in all wonderful idea. I bake my eggs for 12 min. then leave them in the hot oven switched off while I make toast and prepare my coffee/tea mugs and when I pop them out they are PERFECT. If I'm including cheese, I put it on in the 9 min. mark, then follow as usual.

Made these over the weekend for my parents while they visited, and they were great.  Cooked them a little longer for desired doneness, but that's up to the cook.  I also cooked mine in a water bath (placed the muffin pan in a larger pan with some water in the bottom) I also cheated and used pre-cooked bacon, making the cleanup a snap. Served over toasted whole grain english muffins. The possiblities are endless with this.. do these with canadian bacon and hollaidaise sauce for easy eggs benedict.. or serve over sauteed spinach.  Put sauteed green pepper and onion in the cups prior to breaking the eggs in.  I can't wait to experiment with these.

Terrific idea!  I used a small porcelain ramekin sprayed with Pam, and only made 1 egg because I am always a little cautious with new methods.  I used my convection oven/microwave (Kenmore) set at 350 like the recipe says and it turned out magnificent.  Mine took ~ 13 min. to cook to sunnyside-up doneness.  So cute when you pop it out of the ramekin!  I don't know that I would ever cook these on the stove again because this was such a simple method (I was able to walk away and get other stuff done) and I like the presentation/neatness.

EGG-CELENT!!!  This worked out great this morning, as I had 9 hungry kiddies (3 being my own, the rest = 4 nieces & 2 nephews) to feed.  I alternated scrambled & sunnyside.  Plopped them out on to an english muffin and the kids were all impressed: "Aunt Mick is the bomb"!  I left 1 tin in the oven a little longer & got a hard yolk (like hard boiled) mmmmm.  Thanks Shirley, for the easy recipe & saving me from being a short order cook!

I love this recipe.  My good friend introduced this to me about a year ago.  I get rave reviews every time.  The only thing I do different is add a bit of dijon mustard, mayonnaise & paprika right on top of the raw egg.  Once cooked, I melt some cheese on top & sprinkle w/ green onions and put it in an english muffin.  Try it this way.  It's so delicious.

This is a fantastic Idea. I also did this with a slice of blackforest ham, inserted into the muffin cup then add the egg and bake the same way as with the bacon. Infact, the hame is a lot neater and if you pln to use the eggs for eggs benedict, the hollandaise sauce stays in the egg cup :)

This is so easy and I had no problem getting them out of my muffin cups! I baked these at the same time as a batch of biscuits, and made Hollandaise sauce while they were cooking. Split the biscuits, topped each half with an egg and covered with Hollandaise sauce for a different kind of Eggs Benedict. I like another reviewer's idea of serving these over sauteed spinach and will have to try that! If you want to save time when you make this recipe next, cook extra bacon and form it into rounds in the muffin tin until they cool and hold their shape, then put the "bacon rounds" in a baggy in the freezer. Next time all you'll have to do is grease the muffin tin, pop in the bacon rounds and crack an egg, then into the oven.

Easy to make and delicious too! Used shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese.  I cook my bacon in the oven on my Pampered Chef Bar Pan.  Then used the Pampered Chef 6 muffin pan.  Forgot to grease one of the muffin cups and didn't have any problem getting the egg out.  Next time I'm not going to grease any of the cups.

Quite tasty.  I get my eggs and bacon both from the farmers' market and make this for my breakfast on the weekends and serve with English muffins.  I use bacon grease at the bottom of the muffin pans (just pour a little from the bacon into each cup) and don't put cheese on top.  I like to cook for 10 minutes at the most so the yolk is still a little gooey.

Ok, well I messed these up a little bit, but they still came out tasting amazing! I forgot to set the kitchen timer, so when I came to check the eggs, they were already hard set. I decided to remove them from the muffin tin immediately, but discovered I hadn't greased them well enough, and so some of the egg stuck. Instead of melting the cheese on top, I split and toasted an English muffin, put a slice of American cheese on each half, topped the cheese with the egg, then microwaved it for 10 seconds. With a little squirt of tomato ketchup, this was a delicious little breakfast. Thanks so much, Shirley!

This was very timely and very yummy.  I baked the eggs in individual silicone muffin cups.  It turns out the eggs bake at the same time and temperature as baking powder biscuits, so they make a very complimentary breakfast duo.  I had some left over sausage gravy (also from this site), so I didn’t use any meat with the eggs, but I did sprinkle salt and pepper on top before baking.  By using the silicone cups I didn’t need to use any butter or cooking spray, they turned out of the cups beautifully.  In 15 minutes, I had a piping hot breakfast of freshly baked biscuits, baked eggs and sausage gravy and very little effort.  There are so many ways that this recipe can be customized, I will definitely be making these again.  Great idea – thanks for sharing!

I used silicone muffin cups sprayed with pam and they popped out with little to no mess.  I also used shredded ham instead of bacon.  Lastly, you can freeze these and they are the perfect size for breakfast biscuit or english muffin sandwich on the go.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I also tried it with a ham slice in the bottom of the muffin tin, a little grated cheese on top of the egg and when cooked, put it on an english muffin with hollandaise sauce on top...very easy eggs benedict!

I always make a new recipe exactly as written, except for this time. I read many of the reviews and made a few, minor changes but nothing I feel that compromised the integrity of the recipe. I keep a jar of bacon grease in the fridge, so I just wiped the bottom and sides of my muffin tins with that. Because I was running low on bacon grease, I did fry my thick slices this time but if the mess is too much for you, you can always bake them in a 400 degree oven on a broiler pan, which is what I usually do. This will also keep your thinner slices of bacon even and straight, not curled up. I dropped the eggs in the bacon prepared tins and then sprinkled Greek seasoning on the yolks. (Because of the references to blandness.) If you haven't used this seasoning, try it. It works with everything and is a staple on our table. We like a yolk that isn't completely set so I baked mine for nine minutes then pulled them out. Put a little square (1/4 of a slice) of American (because, sadly, it's all I had) and popped them back in for exactly two more minutes. Let them finish (set) in the tin on the counter for another minute or two. There was still some runny yolk, not much, but enough and the whites were completely set. Perfect! Because of greasing the entire tin with bacon grease, mine popped out effortlessly. What a great recipe! Thank you so much!

I'm in the minority here as I wasn't impressed with this at all.  A rather bland dish, it's badly in need of some doctoring up; maybe scramble the egg a bit first so you don't have that hard-cooked yolk lump in the middle, add some green onion and black pepper to jazz things up.  A dollop of salsa or sour cream after cooking would not be amiss either.  My husband and I ended up peeling the bacon off, eating that & giving the rest to the dogs.  All in all, this is not something I'm going to make again.

I rate this recipe "loved it", because I didn't even get a chance to try them. I made them for a work brunch and they were devoured. I made them all a little different, scrambling some, adding green onions, swiss, roasted red peppers etc. This is a great little recipe. I saw some people thought that they were bland, but a recipe is a frame work, you have to embellish it to make it your own. If that wasn't the case, we'd all be bringing the same potato salad to the picnic.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I had family visiting for brunch and I wanted to make something impressive but something I could make ahead so I wasn't in the kitchen the entire time. This recipe is great. I prepared it before everyone arrived and placed the whole muffin tin in the fridge then threw it in the oven when everyone arrived. It was a BIG hit and super easy. Will definitely make again.

MY BOYS JUST LOVE UM....  Did them in cupcake liners (much easier to clean up) scrambled the eggs and added small pieces of cheese and taylor ham... when just about done added one more cheese triangle to the top allowed to melt... turned around and they disappeared!!!!  Definately a pleaser in our house.  (P.S. even if you have a couple of these left over - the kids enjoyed them cold later in the day - will be sending as lunch to school this year with a little ketsup packet).

I just did a trial run of these to see if I want to make them for a Christmas Brunch. And absolutely am I making these! Only thing I added was salt and pepper before putting in oven. And I used the precooked bacon slices from Costco which makes it even easier. Delicious and easy. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW!!  I only made 2 to start with and now I'm wishing I'd made more!!!  I did use another reviewers suggestion to cook the bacon in the muffin tin for 5 mins before adding the egg.  Worked perfectly!!!

These are DELICIOUS. The only changes I made were to spray the muffin tin with Pam so it wouldn't stick instead of using the drippings (lower fat). Came out great. Unlike some other reviewers I used real bacon and cooked it, next time I'm going to use the pre cooked store bought just for ease of clean up and time. I also put the muffin tin in a water bath and ended up cooking for 25mins (no one in my house likes over easy eggs) and they came out perfectly done and moist. For the last 2-3 mins I put split english muffins on foil with a little smoked cheddar on the rack under the eggs to melt the cheese. Will def. do again, but maybe with black forest ham instead of bacon - calories :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with a twist. Once done in the oven as everyone else did, I added salsa and chedder cheese on top. Served with potatoes obrien, and torillas, turned out wonderful and super yummy. My little mexican version of this dish. Thinking about adding refried beans somewhere, a new version of heuvos ranchero. I'll be thinking about it and work it out. Should be tasty though!

These were uber-convenient and yummy.  I used two pieces of pre-cooked bacon.  Baked for 15 min. and then added two, one quarter of a slice pieces of American cheese on top, baked again for about 3 min. until the cheese was bubbly.  This cooked the egg to a soft yolk which made a very convenient non messy sandwich.  I think trying a scrambled egg mixture would work as well if not better for a great school bus stop sandwich.  Use a small rubber scraper to pop out.

This was super easy to make and tasted wonderful! It was very filling! Made practically no clean up mess! I can see how these would be a wonderful idea to serve to a house full of guests!

These are good.  It is important to spray or grease the muffin cups because the bacon moves away from the sides of the cups when the eggs are broken into them.  I had to run a knife around the sides and it still left some stuck to the pan.  I added chopped onion to some of them along with chipotle tabasco sauce and we enjoyed those more than the plain ones.  Next time I will add salsa or more hot sauce, more onion, maybe scramble the eggs.  At 15 minutes the yolks were just a little too hard - maybe at 13 minutes they would still be slightly runny.  On top of English muffins with hollandaise they would be really good, especially if you put chopped bacon in the bottom or maybe some browned hash brown potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy and so cute.  Just sprayed the muffin tin with Pam.  Added a slice of turkey bacon and egg.  Put peper jack cheese on a piece of toast with sugar free jelly, salt and pepper.  Your family will think you're Martha Stewart in just 20 minutes.  "You're secret is safe with us"!

These are easy, but lacking overall. I used the precooked bacon, which worked well. My main problem is the egg yolk cooked solid was not a hit at my house. Perhaps beating the egg before pouring it into the muffin tin would be better. Also, it took a lot of work to remove the remnants from the tins after dinner.

I thought these were very good. I baked for 8 minutes, then topped with pepperjack cheese and baked another minute or two. Served on an English muffin, the yolk was soft and slightly runny, perfect.

I tried it tonight, and since it sounded so easy, I was suspicious that it wouldn't taste too good. But they were well enjoyed by the hub and four kids.  I used a silicone cupcake mold because I couldn't find a muffin tin. Advantages were two: first, even without melted butter, they were super easy to take out. Second, I tried the recipe and then made a second batch but with scrambled eggs. I cracked the egg open in a cup, beat it there, then poured it into the mold. That way it was still one egg per mold for sure. Anyway, the scrambled eggs rose higher so I was glad I used a deeper mold.

Everybody in my family agrees the scrambled tastes better. You get a more (for lack of a better word) wholistic egg taste in every bite, unlike in the recipe where you have a lot of bland egg white, then get a chunk of bland egg yolk.

Lastly, recipe calls for 10-15 min in the oven. Twelve min., plus a bit more for cheese to bubble, will give you hard boiled yolks already.

I make these all the time and we love them!  Lately, I've mixed the eggs with a little milk, green onion, and salt and pepper first before pouring them into the muffin cup.  This takes less than one egg per cup.

Great starter recipe - Instead of a whole egg I whipped up mine and added peppers, onion, and some jalapeno pepper cheese diced up into it.  I also used the 'pre-cooked" bacon you buy in the box...was very convenient!  I will make several of these ahead of time and freeze them for quick morning warm ups at work!

This is a neat idea, but I really didn't like the taste and I found it hard to judge when the egg was cooked through.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I'd prefer just to cook the eggs and bacon seperately.  However, it would be an easy way to cook eggs for a large group of people.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect for us.  My kids are eating it right now claiming it is their new favorite breakfast.  I used pam instead of butter.  That was just a personal choice. I think this is the perfect universal recipe, especially since at my house everyone generally eats their food with different seasonings.  I know based on the rave reviews I will be making this again and again :)  Thank you so much for sharing xoxoxoxo

This is great when you have to cook for a group. One glaring problem is the temperature and time. At 350 for 15 minutes the whites were still clear. I upped it to 400 and it was a minimum of 25 minutes to cook it. Next time I'll start at 400 or even 425 and expect it to take 20 minutes or more to cook. Loved them on english muffins and it was so easy to make. Will make again!

Yum, I had a craving for eggs & bacon this morning and this really hit the spot. I think I overcooked mine a bit, I wasn't sure how to tell when the egg was cooked as the recipe states. I pre-cooked my bacon in the microwave and used sharp cheddar. I flipped them over because they seemed really greasy & lost a bit of the cheese. I used silicone cups & I don't really think the butter was necessary. I also wish I had used a bit of spice. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great way to impress your family & friends. I get compliments every time I make this. The fact that it was super easy as well as tasty made me give it 5 stars. HINT: Use turkey bacon to reduce the fat. The bonus is that it is already pre-cooked so one of the steps & your time in the kitchen is shortened. VARIATION: Make this for little ones by using a mini-muffin pan. Spray pan, insert 1/4 slice of bacon (3 total) into bottom. Scramble 3 eggs in a liquid measuring cup. Fill muffin pan cups about 2/3 to 3/4 full. Egg mixture will puff up during baking. Bake for 6-7 minutes then put cheese on top. Continue to bake for another 4-5 minutes (10-12 minutes total). My 3 year-old son loved his pint-size portions.

These were DELICIOUS!!!! I cooked the bacon and threw it in before adding the egg to because I am not a morning person. Also added jalapenos to the adult version. I did use aged extra sharp cheddar. Easy and very savory!

This recipe is as easy. Tried it for the first time today. The only thing I would say is that at 350 it did not take 10-15 minutes to cook the egg. I put it to 400° half way through and cooked in 5 mins.

This recipe turned out great following the submitted directions.  I used the grease from frying the bacon and swirled it around in the muffin cup.  I made some scrambled, and others I just dropped the egg in.  They were really good both ways.  I think this recipe would benefit from adding a little salt and pepper, and for adults it would be delicious with a hollandaise sauce.

This was such a cool recipe!!! I made for New Year's morning after a long night... it was quick, easy, & delicious! I cooked my bacon in advance and I think the bacon being cold helped with flexibility. I used thick-cut bacon and just sprayed my muffin tins well with canola spray (I couldn't quite stomach butter or bacon grease) and they popped right out- no fuss or mess. Sharp cheddar was our cheese of choice. LOVE how the bacon is so crisp. We will make this one again and again... KID PLEASER!!!

Yum!!! Made this for hubbadoodle this morning and it took longer to toast the bread then it did to make the egg!  Did it in ramekin sprayed with Can't Believe Its Not Butter spray, used ready made bacon and popped in microwave for 30 seconds.  Used sliced Swiss cheese (half a torn up slice on each egg) back in micro for 5 more seconds....waited for toaster to pop.  Hubbadoodle LOVED it!!!

This is my new slumber party go-to recipe! The kids lllloved it and it was so easy. I made 16 and only used half of the butter and precooked bacon. Knife around edge made them pop out easy. Thanks so much for sharing this! So glad no more French toast or pancake slavery for me...

Very good. These are poached eggs in the oven. Easy peasy and I made two but twelve would have been just as easy and fast. I used precooked bacon and pepperjack cheese. I sprinkled these with some kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper before cooking. These are simple enough to say Yes I can have a hot meal on a weekday morning!

My family loves this recipe!  It has a very nice, mild flavor.  I often make it with a piece of black forest deli ham instead of bacon.

The family woke up with a hangover, everyone was hungry but to lazy to do anything about it.  I found this recipe and it was the perfect solution, so easy, eye appealing and tasty!

Quick and easy! My friends and I take turns making breakfast on weeknights. I decided to give this recipe a try. Everyone was amazed with the simplicity of it and how interesting the bacon-wrapped eggs looked. It was very easy to feed 10 hungry adults.     I used pepperjack cheese instead of Cheddar for some extra zing and put the eggs on toasted english muffins. I used the oven to cook everything. I baked the bacon at 350 for 10 minutes and popped in english muffins with about 7 minutes left on the eggs.

Seriously...I can't beleive how great these are!!! I cook all of the time, try out new recipes on a weekly basis but I have never even heard of 'baked eggs' like this before! I have been missing out! Made just as directed only I just sprayed the bottom of the tin with Pam instead of using grease or butter (to save on calories) and they just popped right out with no problem and no messy clean-up. LOVE THESE! Served on toast with a little grape jelly, next time I will serve on English muffins with grape jelly. They are SO pretty, I will make for guests for sure! My favorite new recipe!!!

My mother used to make this when I was a child in the 70s.  It is a great recipe and allows you to make each one unique.  If you’re like me and love cheese but half the members of your family are lactose intolerant, you can easily customize it for everyone.  It is very quick and easy!

YUM, absolutely delicious.  I did modify the recipe somewhat.  I didn't use the butter, and opted to use non-stick spray instead.  It worked GREAT! and they popped out of the muffin tin just fine.  I also placed a one half slice of ham in the bottom!  Tasted sort of like an egg-mcmuffin without the carbs from the bread!  We topped it with Tabasco sauce.  The hubby thought it was a 10* recipe!  So did I.  Very, very good - thanks for the great idea!

I put bacon in muffin tin first and baked. Then added egg. This way only using 1 pan. When finished I would set bacon cups on paper towel to soak up grease a little before serving.

Used it for the basis of a new recipe.  Instead of a muffin pan we scooped out leftover baked potatoes and cooked the egg and bacon in the potato shell.  Used smoked cheddar for the cheese and put it under the broiler.  YUM!!!!!  You may have to cook it longer since the potato is thicker than a muffin pan. About 20 minutes did the trick.

Love the ease of baked eggs. Try this for individual servings: I sprayed cooking spray in 6 oz ramekins, placed one slice of canadian bacon in each, top with egg, salt and pepper, bake for 12 min (I used toaster oven) I sprinkled with shredded cheddar, and allowed to sit in oven, until melted. Served on toasted e-muffins. YUM!

Very quick and easy! Baked a single large egg in a silicone cup for 20m at 350 degrees. Yolk was a hard-boiled consistency, which is perfect for our tastes. Also used a precooked slice of bacon cooked at 15s on high, then wrapped in the cup before the egg.

I bake the eggs the same way but then put a nacho cheese topping over. 
Just mix 1 pound velveeta cheese with 1 can Rotel* chopped tomatoes and chilies. Nuke for a few minutes in the microwave and pour over eggs!

I was searching for a brunch recipe and this fits great. It's a good way to blend the flavors of bacon and eggs plus cheese. I decided to use silicone muffin cups instead of metal. Worked great and easier to clean.

WOW! Super easy! I used Ramekins, Parmesan cheese grated on top, no butter-just sprayed the ramekins with PAM cooking spray. Served this on Valentines, had Breakfast for Dinner. Everyone was impressed and LOVED THEM. You know you have a hit when they are asking how while eating! Thanks SPOKES! YOU ROCK!

I tested this,  this morning. My husband and I both liked it and will make it many times in the future. Having a breakfast next week for a group of women . We are planning our next 12months activities. I host this every Jan. . This will go well with other items on menu and is quick and easy. I will serve warmed salsa for those who want to add a little spice. Been looking for a long time for an egg recipe that is not a casserole. Thank you ,this is perfect.

Very good.  I was able to make some scrambled for the kids and some soft boiled for my husband and me.  I added green onion for added flavor.  These were a big hit even for my daughter who does not really care for eggs.

Great recipe!!  Plus, this is a terrific substitute for poached eggs; easier also.  We will try it with my Fancy Poached Eggs recipe (http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63239533/fancy-poached-eggs/detail.aspx).   The only other comment is to NOT rely on looking at the egg yolk to determine doneness.  They could look runny, but be rubbery if cooked too long.  (Yes, short cuts were taken when cooking brunch for a dozen friends.  I messed up the first time.)

Great idea. I added additional items for more zest. In stead of butter, I just used the grease from the bacon at the bottom of the cup and I used 2 slices of bacon that I broiled with cracked black pepper. I added a jalapeño, mushroom and queso blanco mixture to the bottom of the cup and the the egg. Yum! Topped it with more chopped jalepeños and queso blanco.

What a great and easy way to cook eggs!!Every Christmas I make eggs bennedict , and for a family of 6 we always eat in intervals.Not any more.I baked mine for about 18 min. to achieve the consistencey I wanted.Tastes just like a poached egg.Used turkey bacon and 1/2 tsp. of butter in each cup.Sprayed each cup with Pam and they popped out without sticking.I omitted the cheese as well.

This is awesome. I was skeptical since I don't like hard boiled eggs but was still intrigued. Had some pre-cooked bacon and it was amazing. Followed someone else's suggestion of making a dijonnaise and putting it on before baking it, then sprinkled paprika and a few grinds of black pepper after adding the cheese. A spray of Pam is a must - otherwise the egg completely adheres to the sides of the ramekin.  The egg comes out almost steamed, with a soft baked yolk (depending on how long you cook it), covered with the hearty flavors of melted cheddar, tinged with bacon. Amazing!

These are definately a different way to make your eggs.  I did like it, however I did do one thing different.  I wrapped two pieces of bacon around the muffin cup instead of one.  There was room for two so I figured I would add it.  My daughter did not care for them, but her friend did. These are certainly worth the try.

Tasty, fun and easy way to make breakfast. Works well for feeding small or large groups of people. Make sure you don't cook the bacon much, or it will break when you try to bend it into the muffin tin.

I had cheap-o bacon that did not want to nicely remain in strips around the edge of the cup, so the result was not as lovely as the photo...  But it got rave reviews from the kids, and made it possible to have eggs ready for a family of 5 all at once!  We'll definitely be doing this again, and trying out some fun flavor variations...

These were SO easy to make and were a hit with everyone at the house! I followed the recipe exactly as stated on the website. After about 11 minutes, the eggs were cooked perfectly to our liking - slightly runny in the middle. I also used precooked bacon I think it worked great!

I love the fact that this meal makes it possible to feel many people without much effort! This morning I make 8 servings and all were gone in a blink.   I tried the original version a few times and we loved it. However, today I put squares of thawed phyllo dough in muffin cups BEFORE I put everything in there - and this version tasted even better! The eggs tasted a bit too dry for me, so next time instead of plain eggs I will try using the omelet mix (beaten egg with a bit of milk and, maybe, some shredded cheese).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great and easy! I scrambled the eggs and added a little bit of milk, salt, pepper, cheese, onion, and green pepper. This did make them take a little longer than 15 minutes to get done - more like 18. They were like little mini fluffy omelets!

We liked it and would be good for a group.  I used sliced sandwich ham directly in muffin cup and cooked while oven was heating.  15 min was good. I liked the suggestions about spinach bed, and/or hollandaise sauce.

Easy. Great for a crowd.  I plan on making these for ski weekends with friends this winter!   I used smoked bacon and served with rosemary herb toast for yolk dipping.  I omitted the cheese.

This was good, and is versatile as some reviewers have stated. I did mine in ramekins, but forgot to top with cheese. (Oops!) Still, though, we rarely take the time to do breakfast for breakfast, and this went together so quickly (using pre-cooked bacon) that we managed to "get 'er done" ahead of heading out. Cute little circle of bacon-hugged baked egg power breakfast!

Just tried this recipe and it was so good!  I forgot to pre-cook the bacon, but that was fine because my hubby doesn't like runny eggs so I let them stay in the oven a little longer until brown.  It was soooo good!  I only ate 2 with some toast and it was very filling! I would recommend this to anyone I can.

Pretty good, and definitely gets points for simplicity. Be careful not to overcook the bacon in the pan before attempting to fit it into the cupcake mold.

This was really easy. I made a couple of these in order to use two whole eggs and three egg whites. I just measured out a couple tbsp. into each bacon "bowl. I also used turkey bacon. My kids had this with toast and fresh fruit, but I served mine with sauteed red peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms. Very cute way to eat breakfast. NOTE: Make sure if you make yours like I did, give the muffin tins a shot of non-stick spray. Otherwise, you might have issues getting them out of the muffin tin.

Very good.  I added salt and pepper to the top of each egg, and baked for 20 minutes, then put shredded chedder cheese on top (don't have slices) then baked another 5 minutes.  They were mostly over hard as a result, but 10 min clearly wasn't enough when I checked 'em.  These are really easy and really good.  I ate mine on some toast but bf ate his plain.  Thanks for the recipe!

The reason I rated these a four and not 5 was because I like them better without cheese. Although, I did use american cheese and not cheddar, so that could make a difference. Next time I'll use cheddar. Eggcellent recipe, thank you!! I'll be using it often.

**Okay, made them again, this time with shredded cheddar cheese.. YUMM! 5 stars =]**

I made a couple of delicious easy changes.  I used my "popover" baking pan so the cups were deeper.  I lined the cups with one medium slice of Virginia Baked Ham, cracked two eggs in each, sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese and Hormel "REAL" Bacon Bits.  Quick, easy, very tasty and it kept a large crowd raving over it!

We like our eggs hard cooked, so I baked them longer and these turned out great! I took them out once and stirred the yolk to distribute it more evenly. I topped them with a little chedder and swiss. My husband and I really enjoyed this breakfast dish!

This recipe has made my mornings so much easier. The eggs were a tremendous hit with my kids and husband. I made a few according to the recipe and the rest with EggBeaters. Also, I cheated and used the OscarMeyer pre-cooked bacon. It all rasted wonderful. The kids made a smaller mess than with regular scrambled eggs. The "egg muffins" as my kids named them stayed in one piece as they ate it. I made a couple batches of them today and put them in a ziplock container for my hisband to heat and take on the road with him for breakfast. I will be making this for a long time!

I kind of cheat on this one. I buy the bacon that is already cooked, that way I only have to clean the muffin tin. I also scramble the eggs, and add grated cheese to them so it goes through all of the egg.
these are great, the kids love them, the grown ups love them, and when I make them for guests I look Like a pro.

thanks for the idea.

We liked this!  It is a very tasty morning dish that doesn't take too much to make.  The bacon gets nice and crispy in the oven.  Add sharp cheddar cheese on the top and an english muffin and you have a delicious meal.  The only drawback is the fact that you are using a skillet and a muffin pan.  It makes for more work afterwards, but the recipe is good enough for the extra washing!

This was actually real good.  I could easily see making this for a crowd or serving it as eggs benedict.  I did increase the cooking time by 5 minutes or so. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a little freaked at how these looked, but they're wonderful.  Just a little greasy with the bacon grease(which is why they looked weird).  I think these would be great to serve on an English Muffin!!  Thanks for such a simple, tasty recipe!!

Very easy and good. I use the leftover bacon grease instead of butter to grease the muffin tin. I've found that I really need to brush the entire muffin tin with the bacon grease, or it tends to stick. This has become a weekend breakfast favorite in my house. Sometimes even a good midnight snack :) Thanks for the great recipe.

Very easy and delicious!  I've made them with Trader Joe's pre-cooked bacon (microwave for about a minute for some crispiness and put in while still flexible).  I've also made them using deli ham.  Both methods were easy to cook and easy to clean up.

I use large muffin tins sprayed with coconut oil and I drop 2 eggs unbeaten in each tin.  I sprinkle wit salt and pepper and squirt Hellmann's Dijonnaise on top.  My oven takes a bit longer for this or any other recipe.  We like the yolks not completely hard cooked so it takes about 19 minutes to cook the way we like them in my oven.

I made this for a quick dinner for my men. I can say they loved it. The only thing I changed was instead of bacon I used lean ham and added salt and pepper to the egg before cooking. My men also like a little bit of heat so I put on some hot sauce before serving. I was told this was ambrosia in their mouths. I'm sure I will be making this for all family that come by now!!

I make this quite often but use sandwich ham meat in place of bacon, olive spray in place of butter and I put a few drops of siracha on the egg prior to baking. I'll make extras and save them I like it so much!

First time I have taken the time to rate a recipe...This was fantastic! Delicious & the Grandkids loved it! Made it the Friday after Thanksgiving & it was sooo easy! Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer & cook the bacon in the muffin tin first,& then add the egg. Super easy & fun to eat. This is a great basic recipe that you could use to create many varied & different breakfasts.

These are delicious, fast, and easy!  What more is wanted or needed in busy households?  I scrambled my eggs and added a couple of drops of hot sauce as well as a few bits of finely chopped green onion tops, salt and pepper.  I have no doubt this recipe is a five star recipe as written, but don't we all make adjustments to please our families?  We will have this again tomorrow.  Thank you, Spokes, for a great recipe!  I can't wait until we have company and I can add this to my breakfast rotation.

How did I get to be older than dirt without having ever had a baked egg??? I baked these in buttered ramekins (2 eggs in each), cheese on top, and used Kirkland brand real bacon bits (it's what we had) on top of the cheese. We baked a couple small russets, split and mashed them a little with a fork, put on some garlicky sauteed spinach (takes 5 minutes while the eggs are baking) and slipped 2 eggs onto each bed of spinach. It was divine. The DH thought I was nuts when i originally told him I was making these, now he requests them, often!

Simple, easy, fun presentation, and a crowd pleaser for kids and grownups alike. Made them for a bunch of people this morning, and while some ate them as is, others grabbed some bread and made them into sandwiches. I baked them in silicone muffin molds using only a little bacon grease and no butter, which made them super easy to unmold.

These were good. I added minced garlic and jalapeno slices to mine, and topped with pepperjack cheese. I also used the Oscar Mayer pre-cooked bacon, so I eliminated much of the second step. Thanks, Spokes.

Made for my family for Easter. My mom overcooked most of the eggs, but they were still decent. The ones that were cooked perfectly were excellent.  Use lots of butter to prevent sticking and a high quality cheese.  Serve with hot sauces and mustards of your choice.

What a great way to make eggs in the morning!  Adjust the baking time to the degree of doneness that you want your eggs.  There are so many ways you could tweak this recipe to make it more personal to your liking.  LOVED it!

Fantastic! I however scrambled the eggs before putting into the tins. The whole eyeball look wasn't appealing to me! Plus this way I was able to add some of my favorite ingredients!

This is an awesome and easy recipe!  I would have never thought to bake eggs... now I don't know that I will cook them any other way!  Only suggestion I have is using cooking spray on the pan, the eggs were scooped out effortlessly and the pan was so easy to clean.  Can use butter in addition to the spray if you want.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!

Love this recipe.  The thought of a baked egg sounded strange to me but I tried it anyway and I'm so happy I did.  This is definite a keeper and will be used often in my house!

Grandsons (6 and 4) loved them!  I did overcook them a bit, but the boys still ate them all!  I will monitor cooking time closer next time around - and there will be a next time :)

Incredibly easy and delicious!  I used cooking spray in place of butter and omitted the cheese.  Also used turkey bacon (and have used a turkey sausage patty but prefer the turkey bacon).  Served over whole wheat English muffin and whole wheat toast (both are great).  Baked for approx 14 minutes.  A great way to make breakfast for a crowd.  Thanks!

These were great however, I would use cooking spray next time becuase I used the margarine in the bottom and it still stuck to my nonstick pan and I have been soaking it for weeks to get the baked egg off.

Loved the presentation and ease of cooking this recipe. I would cook for less than 10 min, next time, so the yolk isn't cooked all the way through (just my personal preference).

I made this last night for dinner. It was super easy, but I need to find a different way to cook the bacon. It didn't want to cooperate with the muffin pan. Also, make sure the whole muffin cup is greased. All in all a delicious way to do breakfast, or dinner. :)

I am crazy about Parma-ham at the minute and dont have a deep muffin tin, so used a shallower fairy cake tin and put parma ham over the bottom and up the sides, it worked fab and made sure there were no sticky bottoms. Still woking on how to keep the cheese from sliding off! but it was really yummy and fab in an English muffin

Great concept!  I'm always looking for easy meals to serve out of town guests.  I just have to play around with the baking time to get the consistency we like (a runny yolk with absolutely no runny white).  I placed pieces of ready made bacon in the bottom of the muffin cups, then put the eggs on top seasoned with salt & pepper.  I didn't like the consistency the bacon had so next time I'll follow the recipe & wrap it around instead or just sprinkle it on top after the eggs have baked.  They have a nice presentation & I don't have to make a mess on my stove frying one egg at a time!  Thanks Spokes!

My kids just loved these.  I can't wait to make and freeze some as other reviewers suggested. I didn't add the butter/bacon grease, as the bacon was greasy enough that after loosening the cheese they came right out.

Very good and easy to make.  Don't over cook the bacon before you put it in the muffin tins.  If it's too crispy it's hard to assemble the whole thing

pans with Pam in addition to the butter

We made these for Sunday morning brunch. They were a hit. I seasoned the eggs like I would making scrambled or omelot with garlic and onion powder and pepper. They are great with whatever you throw in them. I also use turkey bacon instead. Served over a split english muffin as suggested. Delish!

I've made this before too.  I use the butter flavor crisco in the muffin tins.  I use shredded mild cheddar cheese and sprinkle a little in the bottom of the muffin, then crack the egg on top and sprinkle more cheese on top the egg before and after it bakes.  I also top it on an english muffin and I spoon a little salsa over it.  It's yummy.

Beautiful presentation, and the recipe couldn't be easier. Next time I make this I am going to try scrambling the eggs before putter them in the bacon wrapped muffin tins. I just don't like biting into a whole, fully cooked egg yolk. I, too, melted the cheese on a buttermilk biscuit rather than on top of the egg. I served these with hashbrowns, sausage links, and fresh fruit. Thank you for the recipe!

This was perfect because I thought that I had run out of ways to make eggs. The only changes I made where Pam instead of butter, and turkey bacon instead of normal bacon.

Great recipe.  Easy for large groups or your family.  To cut calories I used egg whites.

easy, simple and tasty!  My 8 year old son made these with very little help from me.  Peameal bacon instead of strip bacon would be nice.  We will be trying ham cut into strips next time!

I've been doing this for some time,  but I scramble a dozen eggs at a time, then mix in the  bacon. I usually add whatever veggies I have on hand as well. They store well in the fridge for a few days so I take them to work with me instead of having to stumble around at 5am trying to make a reasonable breakfast.

I make these almost once a week.  i use a finely diced ham by Hormel.  Also, some family members won't eat egg whites so I scramble the eggs up with a tablespoon of milk per egg.  doing this you can get more than 1 egg per cup.  Top it off with shredded white cheddar, A bit of salt and pepper and bake for 23 minutes.  I use a small silicone spatula to remove them from the muffing tin, so i don't scratch it.  I use White cheddar because my son can't have Annato, which is used to color the cheese the orangy color.  They go faster than hot cakes!

I have been making variations on this for years. They are so easy and delicious. You can also whip your eggs and make cupcake omelets this way. I like them that way with some chopped mushrooms, onions and tomato.

I used my Nuwave infrared oven to bake in little custard cups with Canadian bacon.  Cut the Canadian bacon in strips and lined sides of cups.
Baked at 350 for 10 min, added cheese and baked for 5 min more.  Also placed buttered English muffins in the Nuwave for the last 4 minutes of baking.  Muffins were toasted perfectly, and ready at same time.

Very easy and a big hit with my family.  They prefer that I don't over cook the pan, so that they egg yolk stays a bit soft.  I like to make a bunch and then warm them up during the week for breakfast.  A good high protein breakfast.

Due to expired bacon, I had to use lean tavern ham slices in its place. I also, for color and texture, added some green onion with the egg.   I baked for 10 minutes,  added a slice of pepper jack cheese on top of each egg and baked for 6 minutes more.  Husband really enjoyed this, I, for one, think I want to make it with bacon (as stated in recipe) for some added fat.  Will definitely make again.

We liked this recipe. Each egg was tender and the bacon just right. I used Applewood smoked bacon and smokey cheddar to make it extra special. The bacon and cheese were salty enough. You don't need to add extra salt.

These egg muffins were wonderful. I added some green chilis and pico de gallo to add spice. They are a little difficult to eat because of the bacon around the muffin but well worth it.

A magnificent waste of time. What is the fascination of fare made for children?  This is not novel nor is it something I would care to eat. An unsavory, un-seasoned mash up I wouldn't feed my dog.

Great technique.  This is a little time-consuming, but worth it.  I recommend punching it up with some seasonings.

Possibilities:

*  Dry seasonings on top (garlic salt, chipotle powder, etc.)
*  Diced jalapeños on top of the egg
*  Canned green chili pepper beneath the egg

I ran out of eggs, so I loaded some of these with leftover shredded chicken.  Those were really really good too.

EDIT: I've made this many times now and have a few thoughts. First, the cheese on top isn't quite worth the effort. It doesn't add much to the taste, but it makes the serving much greasier, and this is already a greasy dish because of the bacon. Second, a pad of butter in the bottom of the pan seems to be the best non-stick solution; just make sure your muffin pan is spotlessly clean or else the egg will definitely stuck. My best add-on though has been a jalapeño ring: Slice a thick ring of jalapeño into the bottom of each of the cups. Clean and seed the pepper if you're sensitive to the heat.

These were great and perfect for on the go protein. I overcooked my bacon a bit  (as usual) but just broke the pieces as needed to fit in the muffin tin and it worked beautifully. I think I will experiment with some added flavors like garlic, sweet onion, and/or jalapeño.

Made this for our Airbnb guest they loved we did as well. Some changes I made was shredded cheese over the eggs then in the oven. The second time I made it used pan spray on the pan as they did stick the first time. Recommend highly when feeding a group!

For those of us who need to lose a few L-B's, this is a great snack.  I use prosciutto, spinach, egg whites, salt and pepper.  (sometimes I cheat with a little cheddar on top).  Kids love them too!

I changed this only completely but think it's a great alternative. I scrambled the eggs, added salt, pepper and a little cayenne plus shredded cheddar and small bits of cooked ham. I had leftover yorkshire pudding and put a small slice in the bottom, lined the tin with cooked bacon and fill the rest of the space with egg mixture. A small amount of shredded cheddar on top and poppped in the oven. DELISH

These are so good.  I found the recipe in the Allrecipes magazine.  I showed them to my husband this morning and he said yes please.  I made them exactly as the recipe stated using the bacon drippings instead of the butter.  I cooked 11 minutes then topped with cheese and baked until melted. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

A fun, different way to serve bacon and eggs. They do need some seasoning though. Would work great if you need to feed a lot of people.

I cooked for half the time to ensure a runny yoke, and it was delicious!

Almost too easy with precooked bacon and shredded cheddar. Served with fresh fruit and an English muffin, but condiments like salsa and chopped avocado would make this  special.

Great recipe  !! Easy,  Portable and you can make as many as you need.  They freeze well for later.  I use foil muffin tin liners to make clean up easy.  Try different cheeses,  or no cheese.

This is great for a crowd and so easy to make. I used butter flavored Pam and instead of precooking bacon I used 2 slices of precooked Oscar Mayer Bacon per cup, I seasoned with cracked pepper, paprika, and diced scallions. I topped with melted American cheese and put out hollandaise sauce for those who wanted it. Wonderful for a brunch buffet!

I will be making this often! Rave reviews from the family. I served it with toast and sliced bananas sprinkled with pomegranate rils. Great flavors. The little ones in the family could even pick up the eggs like finger foods to eat them.
Delicious and fast breakfast. I used precooked bacon that is the perfect consistency to bend into the shape of the muffin tin.

I made this one this morning for 18 people. Super easy and fast considering the amount was made. I used the grease from the bacon instead of the cooking spray. It turned out great too. 
Also served this with banana bread muffin. It was a hit with the teenagers in the early morning.
Thank you for sharing the awesome recipe.

Cook the bacon till quite crispy and immediately but it around inside of muffin tin.  The bacon will not cook any more while baking the eggs.  Also a bit easier to cut the bacon in half before cooking.  Incredibly easy, delicious and elegant looking.

Simple & easy! Was so good. I substituted the sliced cheese for grated Colby cheese and added thinly sliced chive & onions to mine right before I added the cheese.

I have been making these for well over a year now....sometimes I scramble the eggs but mostly just drop the eggs in. I mainly use cooked turkey bacon because it's healthier!! Also I add garlic salt and pepper before cooking the eggs then add cheddar or Swiss cheese....I love this recipe :-)

A nice way to serve eggs but lacks "just a little" in flavour. It makes a real mess to clean up in pan.  Will spray pans next time.

We liked these but they were kinda fussy for me to make for some reason. The kids loved the idea of these and gobbled them up but I think this is something they will get on special occasions until I can get quicker at it ;)

Excellent idea!  Store brand thick sliced bacon was not thick at all.  Stick to really thick sliced and it's great.  We have plenty left for brown bagging to work this week!

Only the top of the bacon that was outside of the muffin cup became crisp.  I did like the egg part though and it would be good on top of an English muffin.

Absolutely wonderful! I used precooked bacon (straight from a meat packing plant) sprinkled a little salt on top before baking, and then I baked a little longer than the recipe says (needed proper doneness). My yolks were cooked through to the same consistency as a hard-boiled egg and was absolutely superb with the bacon!!! I liked it better without the cheese though! =)

Made these today using pre-cooked bacon.  Very easy to put together and cook.   I added a few herbs to the eggs to try to get some more flavor out of them.  I can see where these would be great to make in larger quantities.  We made 6 this morning and they came out nicely.  Will try them in the future as well.

Loved this! It was fun and easy to make and tasted soooo good! I did add a pinch of salt and some pepper to the tops of my eggs after pouring into the tin for a bit of oomph, but that was all this dish needed to be delicious!

Love this recipe but I usually make it with black forest deli ham. I use it when making Eggs Benedict on either a English muffin or s Dutch Rusk,  for a crowd.

Very easy to do, great taste and clean up is a breeze!  I used black forest ham because I didn't have bacon, so next time will be with bacon.  Also used shredded cheddar/jack cheese instead of the slice.  I will definitely make these again.

This was yummy! It made our "Breakfast for Dinner" seem very fancy with very simple ingredients. I served them on toasted English muffins and some grated cheddar on top of the egg along with a fruit salad. Really great idea for using everyday ingredients.  Thanks, Spokes, for the recipe. I'll make it again.

What a great and EASY way to fancy up your breakfast presentation!  I used two ham slices rather than the bacon, and it took my preheated oven 18 minutes to soft-set the egg.  Topped with grated sharp cheddar made this a perfect start to my day--thanks for sharing!

Perfect easy breakfast and a hit at our house!
A very impressive and presentable dish!
I will be using turkey bacon next time instead! (Then I'll have 2 'cause they're "healthy"!! :D)

You can’t get any easier than this for an attractive and delicious breakfast.  I had left-over bacon which I heated in the microwave to make pliable, lined the muffin pans, dropped in an egg, and topped with shredded cheese - done. This would be a great dish to make for a crowd.  Easy, appealing and tasty.

These are so much fun!  I personalized each one to the likes of the diner.  I sprinkled sausage bits on the bottom of my husbands, I added peppers to my sons, I used turkey bacon and egg whites on my daughters and mine with chives sprinkled on top.  They make a very impressive presentation- and YUMMY!!!!  Definitely a keeper and so easy to personalize to individual tastes!

I had seen other variations with tomato sauces in them (ketchup, salsa, etc) and I wanted to use what was in my fridge so I varied this a bit.  I used ham to line the cup, then put a large spoonful of pizza sauce down into the cup, then cracked in the egg, then topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

I scrambled the eggs for mine before adding them to the muffin cups. I made a full, 12-cup muffin pan to reheat for breakfast through the week. These are amazing!

I made these over the weekend and they were awesome!!  I was getting impatient with how long it took to cook in the oven so I took them out of the muffin pan and finished them on the stove.  They were cooked enough that they stayed in the cup form when I took them out of the pan.  I served on toasted english muffins and we loved them!!

Last night DH wanted sloppy joes. I wanted something lite. Came across this recipe an thought yes, this sounds really good. Made two. Gave the DH a taste and he ended up eatting one of my two baked eggs. Was lazy about the toast but it is a must have to complete the meal. So easy to make! Recipe is a keeper and will be making again and again. Thank you Spokes for sharing.

was kinda expecting more from this recipe. Would love to figure out how to make it so the yolk is runny but the white is fully cooked, will take me a few tries. We(my boyfriend and I) came to the conclusion that it needs more bacon(like 2 or 3 strips around the cup) and I used a small muffin pan, ands wished I had used a large one. we also agreed that this would be good if you made it with a slice if peameal bacon or a sausage patty in the bottom instead of bacon around it....but....served on an english muffin with ketchup, although the yolk was cooked hard.... it was still really good! we tried making 2 with real grated cheese and 2 with processed slices of cheese....both were great but the medium cheddar gave it a sharp kick!

These were so good and pretty easy.  Made them for my 4 grands, aged 6, 7 and 10 - all fussy eaters.  They scarfed them up.  Their grandpa did too.

Egg-cellent recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I made a mix of scrambled eggs and whole eggs.  It did stick to the pan quite a bit so next time I think I am going to use cupcake papers and spray them with oil before putting the bacon and egg in.  Try this recipe- you will not be disappointed!

These turned out great first time I tried them.  Sprinkled a bit of pepper onto the eggs then topped with shredded cheddar near the end.  I did not put bacon grease into the cups, just sprayed with Pam and they did slide out pretty easily.  New favorite here, can't wait to try all the variations.

This was a really easy way to make eggs.  I used Oscar Meyer pre-cooked bacon so I wouldn't have to fry bacon in a skillet, and this made for a simple cleanup.  Will make again.

Very easy and very tasty!  Used maple smoked bacon and topped some with butter cheese and some with a mild swiss.  Couldn't decide which was better.

I made the Baked Eggs with a slight variation-two eggs in each cup. Used a slightly larger rameken. It took a little longer but came out pretty good. Eggs were well cooked and we like a slightly runny yolk. I'll cook a little less next time but, will try the recipe again.

These were okay for me. My family thought they were so-so. I did fry the bacon until they were almost crisp and scrambled some for the kids. I don't know if I would make these again.

This was just okay in my opinion, but my husband liked it well enough.  It would be great for making a dozen eggs at once.  However, I can only get about 8 slices of bacon cooked at any one time.  I do mine in the oven on a pampered chef stone, which takes about 15 mintues, then I had to bake the eggs for another 20-25 to get them done.  It just took a lot more time.  I could have had bacon and eggs like normal in far less time and with far less trouble.  However, it gets a 4 for taste.  It would have gotten a 5 but for the trouble it took.

BIG hit at Mother's Day Brunch!  So many ways to dress up the eggs.  I used pretty little chive blossoms on some, parsley, parmesan.
They were delish!!!
Thanks for a great idea!

I used the basic idea of this recipe but baked my eggs in ramekins and made Sausage McMuffin-style sandwiches. It turned out great and went together very easily since everything baked in the oven. I melted cheese on english muffins during the last couple minutes of baking. Yum!

Pretty good and quite easy.  You can wrap these in vegetarian bacon, too, but you might have a bit more trouble getting the egg bakes out.

This was super easy to make and very good.  It was very hard to clean the cheese off of the muffin pan however.  I will try to find a way to keep it from sticking next time.

My 3 yr old and I made these for breakfast.  He usually won't eat meat or the yellow of an egg.  He LOVED these! There wasn't a crumb left on his plate! Thanks for a great recipe that even my picky son will eat!

What a clever way to cook and serve eggs.  I also used the ready-to-eat bacon (a great tip from another reviewer!).  I baked my eggs for 12 minutes then topped with the cheese and baked a bit longer.  Unfortunately, that was a bit too long because my eggs were firm, not runny.  Next time I'll shorten the baking time.  Fabulous picture, Caroline C!

The kids loved these and they were so easy to make.  Nice change for a breakfast.  I just sprayed the muffin tins with Pam.  Great for a crowd.
