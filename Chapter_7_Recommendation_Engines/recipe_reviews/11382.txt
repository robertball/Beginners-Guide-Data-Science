these are great! i made mine healthier by limiting the butter to 1/2 cup and compensated by adding in 1 jar of baby food bananas. i also omitted the chocolate chips and instead used craisins and raisins. halfway through the bake time, i removed the pan from the oven and pressed the mixture firmly into the pan again. this helped to prevent them from crumbling. yummy!

We were going through boxes and boxes of store bought chewy granola bars so I searched for a recipe so we could make our own.  This one is great.  I feel better about my kids eating something homemade without all the processing of packaged ones!  We found them a bit crumbly too.  A few changes include whole wheat flour in place of white, have increased the honey & butter a bit, and substituted a cup or two of Rice Crispy's in place of some of the oatmeal to make them a bit lighter and crunchy.  We have also cut down on the chips to 1 cup as 2 cups were much too sweet for us.  They are a favorite by all!

Excellent!  I've made these several times.  These suggestions from previous reviewers worked best:
1.  Increase butter and honey to 1 cup each.
2.  Mix WELL (until sticky).
3.  Press HARD into pan.
4.  Freeze bars to make less crumbly.
I also substitute 1/4 cup Rice Krispies for some of the oats, for better texture.

These were incredible!!! These are the best granola bars I've ever tried, literally. The version I made tasted almost identical to the Quaker chocolate chip granola bars that kids love. I made a few adjustments like using whole-wheat flour, omitting the sugar and creaming together 2/3 cup butter and 2/3 cup honey together instead and everything came together beautifully! I added shredded coconut, pecans and 1/2 of a bar of 70% chocolate that I chopped up. PERFECT! Thank you so much for the recipe Nancy!

These were delicious!!!  I didn't add the brown sugar or the chocolate chips to make them healthier and they came out great.  The honey made them sweet enough without the extra sugar added.

These granola bars are AWESOME!  They held together superbly, and I had no problems with them crumbling at all.  I did add the extra honey, as the other reviewers suggested, and I also used a handheld roller to FIRMLY press the mixture into my pan both before and after cooking.  The recipe indicates to lightly press it into the pan, but I packed it all in there as tightly as I possibly could... The results were great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was a bit shy to try this recipe after reading about it being so dry.  I assure you that mine did NOT come out dry.  I decreased my oats to 4 cups, used one stick butter, 1/2 c. honey, 1/2 c. applesauce, and 12 ounces of trail mix (which I may change out later).  I did not put any brown sugar in it as I thought the trail mix, honey, and applesauce would be enough.  I am keeping this recipe.

I just made these today and Wow! I am always skipping breakfast and worse yet raiding the vending machine when I get to work. Store bought breakfast/granola bars are expensive(the good kind anyway) and I wanted to find a homemade recipe to have a nutritious "grab n go" breakfast.I wanted more of a health bar so I used 3 cups of Vitamin Enriched Bran Flakes and 2 1/2 c. oats.  I put the bran flakes and 2 cups of the oats in a food processor and blended it to form a "cornmeal" type texture.  I also added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and mini chocolate chips to 3/4 cup. PERFECT! Try the tips I used and believe me you wont be disappointed..there's tons of room in this recipe for tweaking and adjusting to your own preference. Thanks for sharing this one Nancy!

This is absolutely awesome!! I always have to have it available to eat!! The first time I made these, they came out crumbly and was the only one that ate them. The second time, i didn't know how much 2/3c was, so used 7Tbsp of butter and melted it. They come out perfect every time and everyone loves them!! MELT THE BUTTER.
So thank you very much!!

I added mashed banana and some apple sauce, as well as using the full cup of margerine.  My bars were nice and chewy and didn't fall apart at all.  Deeeeelish.

Ok, I read some of the mixed reviews of these, but I went ahead and made them exactly as written anyway.  They're awesome!  Chewy and delicious!  Here's what I did that might make them more successful for others: Mixed oats, flour, baking soda, brown sugar, and chocolate chips together.  Cut in the butter really well.  Measured out honey then added the vanilla to the honey, and poured in dry mixture. Blended REALLY well.. for a couple minutes at least until there wasn't a dry crumb to be seen.  Poured into pan, spread out, and patted it down FIRMLY.  Baked for only 18 minutes (until only the edges were slightly browned).  Once out of the oven, pressed it into the pan again and let it sit in the pan until completely cool (30 minutes to an hour I think).  I used a pizza cutter and cut into bars and put them in the fridge to cool even more.  When I took them out of the pan, they weren't crumbly at all.  If you undermix, overbake, and/or cut these too soon - you'll have problems.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  It wasn't  chewy like I thought it would be.  I was surprised at how soft the texture was and it reminded me of a bland chocolate chip cookie bar.  I think I was looking for a bar that has the texture of Quaker chewy granola bars.

I urge everyone to try this recipe as is without using any other suggestion than from the written recipe......This was great as is however I made a few changes the second time I made :,First I added different type of chopped nuts, raisin,dried cranberry, dried chopped tropical fruits found in the health food store along with shredded coconut....I left out the brown sugar and added maple syrup in place of the honey....let me tell u it was soooo good...It is very important to press down mixture in the pan and cut while hot leave in pan to cool this will ensure your bars don't fall apart

I made this with multiple modifications which were as follows:  3 1/2 cups oats, 1 cup Rice Krispies, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup flaxseed meal, 1/4 cup oat bran, omit butter, use 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, use 1/4 cup honey, omit brown sugar, use 1/2 cup turbinado sugar, add two egg whites. Line pan with parchment (overlap sides for easy removal later). Otherwise, follow recipe as written. Press into pan firmly before baking, remove from oven at about nine minutes and press again, and press again when you remove it from oven. Cut into bars while warm (in pan), refrigerate to cool fully, THEN remove from pan by pulling up parchment.   I really like this recipe with the modifications, and hope to further reduce the sugar content.

They taste really good. You should wait before you cut them into pieces as they are too soft right after cooked and they may break, waiting a few hours, they become harder and nicer to eat! Its better to use thinner oats, bur for my recipy i added less oats and practically no sugar because  vanilla and honey do the rest. I make them for my littke kids of  3 and they love it!!

I love these! I will never buy granola bars again! I use 1 stick butter and up the honey to about 3/4 cup. I like to use 1 cup dried berries, 3/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds, and 1/4 cup flax seed. I use a rolling pin to pack the mixture down to ensure the bars are...well...bars! Note: Do not use wheat germ in place of flour - flour is a binding agent and helps to prevent the bars from getting burned.

i absolutely love this recipe!!!  i don't think i will ever buy store-made granola bars again.  the variety you can create is ENDLESS - choc chips, nuts, dried fruits, m+m's, cereal, marshamllows...and on and on!  my only complaint is that i think the 2 cups of add-in's is too high - when i make them with chocolate chips, 1 cup is plenty (and i love chocolate!).  otherwise i think they turn into a dessert bar.  but my kids enjoy them, i love them... i will be making these regularly for a very long time!

These were delicious!!!! I know some people dislike when reviewers make changes, but to me that's one of the best parts of this site---seeing the variations and changes people made to differ or better recipes--so here's mine:  Used 4 cups oats, 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour, 3 T melted butter and 1/4 cup canola oil.  Some were per others suggestions.  Also, pressed bars down again mid way through cooking--amazing!!!!!

These were great!! To prevent crumbling, I did as another reviewer said about mixing in the oats a little at a time, and it worked. I only used 4 cups oats. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour, only about a 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and a little under 1/3 cup brown sugar because I didn't want them to be too sweet. I also used raw honey - and I highly recommend that for GREAT honey flavor! Oh, and I accidentally forgot the vanilla. I took a pan to work and they were gone in less than 2 hours. They were very good and not crumbly at all. Oh, and I mixed by hand, too, to prevent crumbling.

Well these are PERFECT. I have been looking for a long time for the perfect granola bar recipe that I can add tons of delicious nuts and fruit to and this is it. I did take the wise advise of others and put in 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of honey. I added tons of whole almonds, dried cranberries, and pumpkin seeds. Every bite is chocked full. These are very tasty and pretty. I only used 2 cups of oats only because I ran out. I highly, highly agree with Kaley Rae-MELT THE BUTTER.  It makes it so much easier to mix and I let them sit 5 minutes so the oats will absorb some of the moisture. These are truly so full of flavor. When hot they seem like the are going to fall apart- when cooled they will not. The texture is perfect too. Thanks you BURSTEIN. My search for the perfect granola bar is over.

Very good.  Yes, a bit crumbly, as others have noted.  I used the 1/2 c. honey as written.  I halved the butter to 1/3 c. and added 1/3 c. peanut butter.  Also replaced one cup of the oats with 1 c. rice krispies.  Instead of the chocolate chips I added 1/2 c. sunflower seeds and 1 c. raisins.  They are very healthy tasting.  Do freeze them, individually wrapped, so they stay fresh and tasty.

I've made this recipe a number of times, both as bars and as granola.  The quality of honey and butter that you use is important.  It's also important to use a slower-cooking variety of oats, like old fashioned or rolled oats - if you use quick oats there just isn't enough honey to make things stick together.  Also as noted in other reviews, if you want your bars to stick together, you don't want to 'lightly press' it into the pan, press as hard as you can!!  You're always going to get a certain amount of crumbling and you just have to be OK with it.  The good thing about this recipe is that it's quick, easy, and tasty so just go with the shortcomings.

As a granola recipe it works great.  It's pretty sweet so I leave out the sugar.  I do raisins, sunflower seeds, and minced almonds and walnuts instead of chocolate chips.  Maple syrup subs in great if you're out of honey, and seems to stick together better - might work well for bars, maybe someone will try this.  It does make the recipe a bit more expensive though.

i tweaked the recipe a little and they turned out tasty.  I snuck a bite and they seemed a little dry when they first got out of the oven, but by the time they had cooled, the honey had worked it's magic and they had just the right amount of moistness.
    Here's the ingredient list I used:
    * 4 cups quick oats
    * 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
    * 1 teaspoon baking soda
    * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    * 3/4 cup whole milk yogurt
    * 1 tablespoon oil
    * 3/4 cup honey
    * 2 tablespoons light molasses
    * 3/4 cups dark chocolate chips
They were not crumbly at all.  Following the instructions on when to cut and when to move the bars, might help those who have problems with the crumblies because 1. hot bars seem to like to stick to the pan more and 2.leaving them to cool for a couple hours gives the honey time to do it's magic, so they're moister than when they first come out of the oven.

Fantastic! These are so tasty, easy to make and do not fall apart as some have suggested. I also love the fact that the base recipe is so versatile, and because of this I did make a few changes. I halved the recipe and used a great deal less butter, only about a table spoon. I used a bit more honey and compensated the butter by adding applesauce, which turned out wonderfully. I also added a bit of cinnamon and chocolate chips. Great recipe, and I can't wait to try more variations!

Very good recipe.  Altered it a bit, used ww flour like other's had, melted 1/2c no salt butter with 1/3c peanut butter, 3/4c honey and 1/4c corn syrup  1/2tsp salt and 3/4tsp cinnamon, omitted the sugar. Instead of 4c of oats I added 1cup and also a cup each of special K, corn flakes and natures path organic flax granola. Also added 1/3c each of dried cranberries, coconut, chopped pecans,mini choco.chips, reeses chips and 3/4c of mini marshmallow.  Pressed it into a rimmed cookie sheet (instead of 9x13 pan) and halfway through baking pressed it down like one other review had said and then pressed it again after baking was complete, came out awesome!

Okay, I have tried a ton of granola bar recipes lately.  And like the many other recipes I have tried this one fell apart and crumbled too much.  However, the taste was good and I think with a little tweaking it may have a lot of potential.  It may not be the healthiest bar recipe but at least we will probably eat all of these where as the others I have tried just went to the trash can.  If I try it again I will mix the wet ingedients in a sauce pan and then add it too the oat mixture just to combine the ingredients better.  The softened butter just didn't incorporate well with the oats as written.  I will also consider adding more honey or maybe an egg white to hold it together better.

Easy and the kids love them.  So much better that the processed store bought ones.  To keep the bars from falling apart I place bar mixture on one cookie sheet lined with parchment paper then cover with parchment paper and place a second cookie sheet on top and stand on the cookie sheet to really compact the mixture.

I made these granola bars today and they were really good. They are chewy, I did increase the honey and melted the butter (from another review). Melting the butter worked great. They were really tasty and the family loved them! Thanks for the recipe- I'll definately make these again. UPDATE- I froze about half of the granola bars and I just took the rest out of the freezer- they are fantastic frozen! Also, when cutting the granola bars, I cut them into 36 pieces instead of 18 because they are quite thick. The smaller serving sizes are perfect for the kids lunches.  UPDATE: I made these again yesterday but instead of chocolate chips, I added dried cranberries and they are absolutely fantastic. I also changed the type of honey I used, this time I used amber honey which was a little stronger than what I had before and I like the darker honey better- it has a litte more flavor. And, as always, I used 3 1/2 c. oats, 1 cup rice crispies and increased the honey.

I have made this recipe many times.  You definately need to up the honey and butter content though.  Otherwise way too dry.  I substitute whole wheat flour for the white and Becel margarine for the butter.  just to make a little healthier. I also include Craisins (cranberry raisins) which adds a bit of colour and taste.  Very Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

everybody loves this recipe! I used 1 cup of honey and found that the back of a large spoon was sufficient to mix together the butter, honey, br. sugar, vanilla . I did not have to use my hands . also I used a plastic bag as a glove to press the granola into a 9X13" pan. came out great. i used choc. chips, puffed amaranth, peanuts, coconut, and half a cup of wheat germ instead of the extra half cup of oats. it is a real winner!

We loved these bars!  As others did, I used 1 cup of honey and 3/4 butter.  I also think they came out much better when I made them in my jelly roll pan as opposed to the 9X13.  We've made them several times and my 4 year old loves them.  We have added rice cereal, chips of all kinds, mini marshmallows, and after decreasing the amount of butter, I added peanut butter.  I have given this recipe to all my coworkers and family and we, too, will be eating these instead of store bars.

This is a great recipe! I started to sell several trays of these and a successful hit in the office. Since honey is a little pricy, I compensated 1/2 cup honey with about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup evaporated milk/ fresh milk. To sum it up, I made use of 1 1/2 cup brown sugar. Then, I omitted the baking soda in the recipe that calls for honey. From my researches, baking soda is used to take away the slight acidity form the honey and is unnecessary with the use of sugar. 
Since I am a choco lover, I added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder. I also chopped 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of nuts. Then I reduced the choco chips to 1/2 cup of white choco chips. Lastly, I greased my pans with butter then dusted it with flour so I could remove the bars on the pan nicely. Hope this helps!

These are awesome!!! I only substituted applesauce for butter, since I'm trying to eat healthier and was the main reason I made these.  They come out perfectly chewy and hold together (unlike another recipe I made where they were dry and crumbly and fell apart).   I have packaged them individually so I can grab them as snacks on the go, and I will definitely be making them again once I run out :)    Thanks a for a great, easy recipe!

Excellent.  Nothing short of a Mouthgasim. The only change I made was that I added dried cherrys, I should warn you its easy to leave them in too long, the first time I made them I waited untill they were golden brown and found them crunchy, but if you pull them out while still soft they will be much chewyer.

Wow. I decided to try this based on a friend's recommendation and I'm so glad I did because it instantly became a favorite. I read a few reviews and decided to press the bars into the pan as hard as possible and I liked the results. Yesterday, I used a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of Craisins, and since they are almost gone, am making them again today, this time trying another flavor combination. Thanks for such a great and easy recipe! Since my son is allergic to peanuts, we never buy the store bought bars, this way I can control the ingredients and the whole family will happily eat these!

A complete hit! Everyone loved them, I tried these with a picky crowd and they all loved them included my mom who had problems with granola in the past.  Few tips: add more honey instead of the sugar to keep them off the crumminess of the original recipe, other than that these a real treat for snack time throughout the year!

As according to the other reviews I added 1 c honey and 1 c butter. Also I found if you don't cook it the full amount, just until the top is slightly brown, that they stay moist. I have added rice krispies, mini m&m's, mini choclate chips, Kashi go lean cereal and everytime it comes out great. I also have substituted the flour for whole wheat flour and it still works! Thank you for the perfect granola bar recipe that you can do just about anything to.

Tasty, but now chewy, and definitely not "extra chewy". I read the reviews before making and decided to reduce the oats by 1 cup.  Still, pretty dry and crumbly. Sigh.  I really wanted a CHEWY granola bar.

This recipe is delicious.  And the bars are so pretty.  I am trying to cut back on sugar so I did as others suggested and doubled the honey.  I only had wheat flour so that is what I used.  It must have contributed to the golden color.

Just amazing! I took some advice, and cut out 1/4 cup of oats, and added 1/4 cup applesauce. The applesauce was really necessary to make it moist enough to bind. We used dried cranberries, chocolate chips, and slivered almonds. And it certainly has to cool COMPLETELY before cutting, or it  will fall totally apart (which is when you use it for breakfast cereal, hehe!). My kids ate two batches in three days, I had to hide them! I'll be buying oats in bulk from now on, thank you!

These are sooooo good. I added 3/4 c. of honey. The first time I made these, I just used the 7 T. butter recommended by another reviewer. The second time I made these (the same day...they were so yummy!) I melted the 7 T. butter. This did seem to make the bars more firm. They were still fragile but if you follow the directions about when to cut them and how to cool them, they are fairly easy to handle. I wrapped them carefully and froze them. I made them for a road trip we have coming up but at this rate, none will be left. They are good frozen or thawed. They are firmer thawed than they were after baking.

These are wonderfull. I have made them two times now. I cut down on the brown sugar a little though, because the first time they were too sweet. I will continue to make these. They are a great snack for my little ones and much more economical and healthy than store bought. Thanks for the recipie

These bars are AWESOME!!  I made a few modifications after reading reviews, but I don't know that they were nec.  I "eyeballed" 1/2 c of honey, BUT, I added 1-1/4 c. of butter(2-1/2 sticks)...I used only 4 c of oats, but it seemed to wet...so I added another cup (5 c total)...I think that 1c of butter with the 4-1/2 c of oats would be fine for next time...Basically the only change that I would make is increasing the butter to 1 c.  I added pb and milk choc chips to 1/3 of my batch, yellow raisins to another 1/3, and semi-sweet choc chips to the remaining...I shaped mine into granola bars before baking...when they come out of the oven they ARE crumbly, allow them to COOL COMPLETELY to soften and be removable from the pan(or you will end up with a crumbly mess!!  Have fun and ENJOY!!  They are GREAT

These are good. I was looking for a simple granola bar that comes together quickly and doesn't have a long ingredient list. This recipe does just that. I've used oil in place of the butter with good results. The combination of honey and brown sugar compliment each other.  Nice recipe.

My family absolutely LOVES these granola  bars! I did make some changes though, I omit the brown sugar. The first time I made them I forgot to add it, but after tasting them, I didn't think they needed the extra sugar. I also use 4 cups of oats and a cup of honey. I've made several different varieties, apple cinnamon, banana chocolate chip and cranberry white chocolate chip.

These are perfect!  My family has them gone within a week.  Although I have made a batch and frozen it with good results. It was a bit drier but not enough that it bothered me or the family...Good Job this one is a keeper!

I tried to make them exact, but I did need more honey about 1 cup, and more butter probably about 3/4c.  I also took suggestions and used the 1/2 cup of rice krispies.  But I used just rainbow chocolate chips to suggestion.  The sugar probably wasn't needed because of so much honey.  I loved the taste of them, but my son did not.  They're very thick...I even cut them thin making 19 of them.  However, i think the only thing healthy about this granola bar is the fact there is no perservitives in them.  They're still quite unhealthy.  On weight watchers at 19 they worked out to be 8points each...which is a meal in itself.  I could have 1/2 of one for 4 points.  Thanks for sharing...they did taste pretty darn good!.  I much rather have half of one these then the store bought kind.

After reading all the reviews, these are the changes I decided to make to the original recipe: 1) Decreased butter to 1/2 cup.  2) Added 1/2 applesauce.  3) Pressed the mixture VERY firmly into the pan.  I didn't have any problems at all with crumbling.  The texture is quite perfect for my family (husband hates crunchy granola bars).  I used chocolate chips on one side of the pan and raisins on the other.  Next time I think I'll add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I can't wait to try different throw-ins.  Yummy and versatile recipe.  (I gave it 4 stars because of the changes I made.)  I just realized what these remind me of!  Those really yummy Quaker oatmeal bars that are soft and tasty.  Drizzle some icing on these babies and they're basically the same thing at a MUCH lower price.

These were good, but not what I was looking for.  These are definitely a cookie, not a granola bar.  I worked the dough with my hands to make sure it was well blended and used wet hands to firmly press it into the pan.  My kids really loved them.  I'm still searching for a true granola bar recipe like ones I would buy in the store....

I've made these twice.  The first time, I followed other reviewers advice and added 1/3 c. extra butter/margarine.  I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 c. and added some trail mix.  I found the resulting bars to taste more like the bottom of a date square than the "granola bar" I was seeking.  Also, they were too thick for my taste. However, they did taste very good. So, I tried them again.  This time, I added 1/3 butter + 1/3 margarine so they wouldn't be as rich.  I added 2 c. of trail mix and 1 c. chocolate chips. I added one egg to help it stick together and (I hoped) to add a bit of crispness.  It seemed effective on both counts, but will actually try again with 2 eggs and see what happens.  The flavour was excellent this time too.  Though I ususally find many recipes too sweet, I found this one to be just the right sweetness.  I would add less sugar if the ingredients I was adding had lots of sugar (i.e., marshmallows, choc. chips, etc.)

Very satisfying and chewy.  I used 1 generous cup of mini semi sweet chips and 1 generous cup of mixed dried fruit including raisins, cranberries, apricots, figs and cherries.  I used a slightly bigger pan, and was careful not to overcook them so that they would stay chewy.

I have made these bars several times and they turn out perfect every time. The only reason they make fall apart is if you take them out of the pan too early. I use a jelly roll pan and it works very nicely. Everyone that has eaten them can't get enough. I have played around with several different add-ins but the favorite so far has been chocolate and peanut butter chips. I haven't changed a thing about how I make them and they are fantastic! THANKS!

This is an excellent base recipe that I will definitely use again!

I made a bunch of tweaks to suit what I had on hand, including swapping 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter for the butter, adding extra honey (as suggested by other reviewers) and a lil' molasses, and reducing the sugar. I also only used 4 cups of oats and subbed the last 1/2 cup with coconut instead. In addition to chocolate chips, I also added dried cranberries & mango, toasted almonds, sunflower seeds, and hemp hearts. 

I pressed the granola down mid-way through baking and once again before it cooled. The end result was not crumbly at all. In fact, they are amazing!!

I love this recipe; it is very quick and easy. The first batch I made, following the recipe, were a little too crumbly for my taste. On my second try, following suggestions from other reviewers, I used 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of butter. This batch was a hit with the rest of my family. As soon as I buy more oats, I will definitely make more!

I made these tonight and they turned out great! They aren't very much like the store-bought kind, but I actually like them much better. I took these suggestions from other reviewers: Add more honey (after the original measurement, I just kind of poured it in until the dough seemed properly moist), and replace some of the oats with Rice Krispies cereal (I did 1 cup which seemed to be a pretty good amount). I also used about half mini chocolate chips, half peanut butter chips. It's good that way but not overwhelmingly so; I probably wouldn't do it that way next time (I just wanted to use up my PB chips). I also liked the pan with foil which made it easy to remove the bars. Great recipe! I bet you could put almost anything in them.

This is not only easy and delicious, it is also easy to customize. So far everyone who has tried the bars I've made from this recipe (and personal variants) have loved them.  I like to shop at Bulk Barn for my granola bar supplies, and I've found all sorts of options as to partial to total replacement of the chocolate chips: from almonds and cranberries to sweet and salty sunflower seeds to even crunchy caramel bits, the variations are endless. 

I have found, though, that making them without the chocolate chips (like a cinnamon raisin variety) would have required more "glue" to hold things together since there was no melted chocolate, so upping the honey a bit for the no-chocolate variations might be a good idea to prevent them from crumbling too much.

This is a great basic granola bar recipe. it's much better than the more popular "playgroup granola bar" recipe on this site, which, in my opinion, is kinda gross.

These were fabulous. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Instead of rolled oats I used Special K granola and added dried cranberries and pistachios.  They are fabulous!

These are super easy to make! I make them to take to work for my breakfast. Much better than boxed and cheaper. I melted the butter as another suggested and had no problems with them falling apart. I used one cup of chocolate chips and baked for 18 minutes. Great recipe! UPDATE: To make these healthier I now use whole wheat flour, one stick of butter, 1/2 cup of applesauce, less brown sugar and 1/2 cup of choc chips. Still great with these changes and makes me feel better about eating them!

These granola bars are AMAZING!!! Please don't waste your money on the store brands and make these instead. You can throw in whatever you have at home and it is healthier for you too!
I made these without the chocolate chips and brown sugar as I wanted a healthier version.
What I've done:
-grind a total of two cups all bran flakes with Quaker oats
-grind together raisins, cranberries, unsalted sunflower seed, unsweetened coconut, almonds
-add to 1 cup organic whole-wheat flour, baking soda,vanilla, 1 cup butter and 1 cup honey.
Enjoy!!:)

I printed this recipe about a year ago, and make it every other month or so. It has been a huge hit with family and friends and as a result have given this recipe to almost everyone I know!

I only use 4 cups of rolled oats and often use regular cooking oats instead of rolled oats because they are cheaper. I also add just about anything to them in varying combinations: peanut butter, raisins, dried blueberries  and cranberries, craisins, marshmallows, apples diced into tiny pieces, dried fruit.

I mix the wet ingredients together and then add them to the dry, and add the extras which seems to cause them to be less crumbly. I've also started to keep them in the fridge-which seems to help them from crumbling as much.

These were really easy, soft, chewy and delicious. I love the idea that I know exactly what I'm feeding my kids. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little more butter and honey. The second time I made them I added less chocalate chips and to give it a lighter texture I crumbled cheerios in the mix (1 cup of cheerios substituted 1 cup of oatmeal).

I had been looking for a chewy granola bar to make for meal replacement bars and thought I would try this one. I made several changes though: I took 1 cup of rolled oats out and subbed in 1 cup of grape-nuts, didn't use any brown sugar, no choc. chips, added 2 scoops of protein powder (GNC Total Lean powder, Vanilla Bean flavor), and added 1 egg. I also used raisins and dried blueberries (this is really what made them taste and smell so good!), almond slivers and walnuts. Bars turned out perfectly chewy. Made for one very delicious and filling granola bar! Will definitely be making more

These are amazing!  I read the reviews before making them and with a few adjustments they are perfect.  I increased the butter to 3/4 cup, add @ 1/4 cup Nutella and @ 1/4-1/2 cup peanut butter and increase the oats to 5 cups.  Use the butter wrapper to grease the pan.  I squish them down good with a flipper before baking.  After 10 minutes I pull them out and re-squish.  I bake @ 8 more minutes until the edges start to brown, re-squish and let cool.  They turn out great!  My 2 year old calls them "tooth buddys"...

This is a GREAT recipe! I too, increased the amount of honey (added 2/3 cup). Added about 1 1/2 c. of rice krispies instead of all oatmeal. I would also suggest that after you cut them in the pan (which I did after about 15 mins after taking them out of the oven), to pop them in the frig so they set. That seemed to help them "stick" better! I have breakfast for myself for a couple of weeks now!

Changed a few things: 2 1/2 cups rolled oats instead of original recipe amount; 1 cup choc. chips instead of original amount; added 2 1/2 cups raisin bran cereal and 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  More nutrition (from cereal and nuts) less sugar because less chocolate.

I love how you can add or subtract what you want and it still comes out delicious. Kids eat these faster thatn store bought. I do use 1 cup butter and honey. I only use 1/2 cup chocolate chips. The other 1 1/2 cups is other stuff. Otherwise way too sweet. I also use rolling pin (daughter's smaller one) to skwoosh together before cooking. I also roll it again as soon as it comes out of the oven. Wait 10 minutes, cut it and then let it cool completely. Easier to cut that way.

These are the best.  I need nut free granola bars and want them to be preservative free and low in sugar.  Good luck finding them in a grocery store.  I used 1/2 butter melted, no sugar, 3/4 c. honey and 1/4 c. applesauce.  I pressed them into a pampered chef large bar pan (similar to a cookie sheet), covered them with waxed paper and rolled them with a rolling pin.  The first time I made them I took them out 1/2 way to roll them again (covered with waxed paper).  I let them cool partially in the pan, cut them into 32 and wrapped them all indiv. and then put them into a large freezer bag and popped them into the freezer.  They are delicious frozen and are perfect for popping into the kids lunch boxes in the am (the schools are nut free...hence my quest for a peanut butter free granola bar).  They also make a healty breakfast choice when you are in a rush to get out the door (of course this depends on what you add for accessories....I tried craisins, white chocolate chips and sunflower seeds the first time....and semi-sweet mini choc chips with raisins and sunflower seeds the second time).  I will be making these weekly during the school year FOR SURE!!  Thanks SO much for this recipe!!

These bars are AWESOME!!! They have become a staple in our household. I have followed some of the other suggestions and experimented on my own... I omit the brown sugar, use wheat flour, up the honey to 1 cup, use only 3 1/2 cups of rolled oats, and add 1/2 cup each of ground and whole flax. I also cut back the chocolate chips to 1 cup, and make sure to pack everything down FIRMLY... otherwise it will fall apart! Also, if you refrigerate it right after it cools, the cutting goes a lot smoother. It is also good with cranberries or dried apricots!

This recipe is great. You can also substitute almond or peanut butter for some of the butter. I recommend adding coconut. They taste like a dessert bar. Use non-hydrogenated margarine and no honey and these will be vegan. Yummy!

The recipe needs more honey as it does not stick enough. I added a nutty all grain cereal. The best option in most desserts like this is to use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan. You can easily remove the recipe out of the pan

I modified the recipe and people are raving about how delicious. Very similar in taste to the Cosi Break Bar. I used  6 cups rolled oats, 2 cup rice crispy, 1 1/2 c wheat flour, 2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 2 c butter softened, 1 1/2 c honey, 1 c splenda brown sugar, 1 bag white choc chips, 1 bag dried cranberries, 1 c. raisens, 1 med jar sunflower kernals, handfull of chopped pistacios, handful chopped cashews.  The only thing I did different was to mix the butter, honey, and vanilla before adding it to the first dry ingrediants.  You can bake in a square pan, or make large cookie sized individual patties and bake as directed.  I wrapped them individually in the Glad cling wrap and they were very handy snaks.  Made about one dozen individual large cookies and 2 doz bars.

Wow, didn't think this would turn out as good as it did, since the recipe was so quick and easy to make.  I didn't even have time to take a picture, as they were eaten so fast...I was so impressed with these that I gave some to my Mom, mother-in-law and sister in law for them to taste.  I'll be sure to make some, very very soon...  I am si glad this is a home made option instead of those store bought bars.  On top of being economical, they are ecological too ! ( Think of all those printed wrappers and boxes that you save this planet from !!  Why didn't I think of this sooner ??  I love this site, period.

I can't keep these in the house! My boys gobble them up before they even have a chance to get completely cool.

I have modified this a bit. Reduced the amount of Oats by 1/2 a cup. Included 1 cup of peanut butter. Increased the butter to 1 cup and added raisins. No trouble at all with dryness with the modified recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips.  They turned out great!  I wrapped them individually in cling wrap so they are an easy snack on the go.

This is a great basic recipe that you can add lot's of variations to. One of the few w/o peanut butter for all the PB restrictions at school these days!
I'm also going to try to increase the butter and honey so they are a little less crumbly. I think I will also try putting this in a bigger pan for flatter bars...this made a lot!

These are great!  I followed the advice of others and added 1 cup butter and 1 cup honey.  Our add-ins were coconut and cranberries-yummy!  You can also add 1/2 cup peanut butter and only 1/2 cup honey for more protein for those summer picnics!  Great energy bars for the kids and healthy too!  Thanks again for the recipe!

VERY YUMMY!  I added corn syrup to bring the honey up to 1 cup, then sub'd rice krispies & puffed wheat for the last cup of oats, and added coconut & raisins with a splash of applesauce.  delish.

These things are great! I did use 1 cup honey and 3/4 cup butter. I also added 1 cup powdered milk (for nutrition) and added 1/4 cup corn syrup. This made them extra chewy and moist. My sons (who are very picky) and I love these we use all sorts of variations, like dried apple,walnut and cinnamon chips.

AWESOME!  Instead of adding more honey for moistness, I added 1 mashed banana and reduced margarine to 1/2 cup (or less).  Nice texture, not crumbly, and just the right sweetness.  Also added cinnnamon & nutmeg, mixed raisins & nuts - anything goes with this recipe.  Thanks!

Great recipe. If you use a mixer, use a dough hook on the lowest setting for the least amount of time possible (and still mix adequately) or your oats will break up and the granola bars will resemble 'bran' bars. Heat the honey (slightly) to increase its viscosity to reduce mixing time.  I like this recipe because it is a good 'base' to which you can add nuts, dried fruit, or other healthy ingredients.

Fantastic recipe. I felt this one was healthier than others I had tried. Came out chewy but was less crumbley than other version. I used 3 suggestions others have mentioned; increased butter to 1 cup and honey to almost 1 cup, reduced chocolate to 1 cup. Can't wait to start experimenting with this!

They came out greata! I made these with my daycare kids and it was super easy to make. They taste good and they hold their bar shape well. They are a bit softer than quaker granola bars. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal for rice krispie cereal and added more honey. I also separated into two batches and made one with Halloween sprinkles and another with almond slivers, m&m candy and Halloween spirnkles.

I loved this recipe with modifications. The original recipe was dry and too crumbly. Modifications: Used Whole Wheat Flour, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 cup of butter, 3/4 cup honey, 1/4 brown sugar(lightly packed), added one cup of wheat germ and used 2 cups of dark chocolate regular sized chips. I'm actually going to post a recipe up for this modification. Happy Baking Everyone!!! :)

I've made these a dozen times for school lunches and they are a hit! My son is a granola bar sneak and buying them premade is too expensive.  He likes these for his lunches, but,, they are not so full of sugar that he craves them all the time! Thank you!

I love this recipe! I actually omitted the choco chips and just added choco powder and peanut butter and cooked it longer. Put it in a cookie pan and it turned out better than those crunchy granola bars that you get from the store!!! Yum!!! Thank you for sharing, we are never buying store bought granola bars again!

I won't rate something unless I follow the original recipe first. Then if need be I will tweek it until I like it. The first time I made these I knew they'd be too dry. There isn't enough moisture in the ingredients to hold it all together. It was tasty though. We ended up eating it with a spoon over yogurt.

The second time I made it I used 4 cups quick oats, 1 cup flour, an entire cup of melted butter and 10 ounces of honey. Finding that it was still a bit dry I used 1/2 c of water. I used the same amount of vanilla, brown sugar and baking soda. Then I used 4 ounces of pecans that I processed in the food processor along with about 4 ounces cinnamon and 1 1/2 Cup of raisins. Baked at 18 minutes, took them out, cut them and left them in the pan to cool.

I felt I had to chagne this recipe too much from it's original form to give it any more than 2 stars. Sorry, I just hate rating something so low.

having trouble with them being super crumbly, but the taste is excellent.  I am still working on get the right amount of honey to get them to stick together.  I did add some wheat germ for health kick and added a 1/2 c peanut butter for fun!  I could eat the whole pan they are so good.

I will try some suggestions to add more honey & reduce brown sugar & butter to decrease crumbly-ness.  Maple syrup is an excellent option if you don't have honey, or don't have enough honey for the recipe.  I often make two batches- one for granola bars & one for straight up granola.  My husband eats these up so quickly I can't keep them in the house!  Also, I use 1 cup dried fruit & 1 cup crushed miscellaneous nuts instead of the chocolate chips.

Pretty good! I made some changes and they were a little dry, but still tasty. I used 31/2C oats plus 1cup crushed cinnamon cheerios, 1/2C marg, 1/2C applesauce (one small container) 1/4C chunky peanut butter, 1/4C honey and 1/4C brown sugar. Also I used assorted nuts, fruits, etc instead of all choc chips. Will definitely try these again and play with the liquids to make it moister (maybe I'll try adding an egg)

My family voted this as the best granola bar recipe we tried and we've been making them for years. Edited: This time we added 1/3 cup applesauce (one jar of baby applesauce) to the mixture due to dry crumbliness. Thanks!

These were awesome, as is.  I have also made them subbing some of the honey with agave nectar and some of the brown sugar with succanat, and both subs worked out great.

The flavor is good. I added additional ingredients such as nuts and dates, but like many others, I had trouble with the bars sticking together. I think next time I will increase the honey.

Though the taste was great, these came out more like oatmeal raisin cookies (I used raisins instead of choco chips) than granola bars. Probably wouldn't make them again.
UPDATED: The next day, these were definitely more granola bar-like; I am going to try them again, adding the full 4 1/2 cups of oats next time, which I think will make them nearly perfect!

Excellent basic recipe for granola bars!  I have made several versions of this and my family loves them!  Big hint:  "Press down in pan" is underrated.  Use a meat tenderizer to smash it down well both before and after baking.  I always add in flax meal and wheat germ (to make it a little healthier).  Last night, I added some rice krispies, and dried cranberries and mango.  We've also had peanut butter and choc chip, and going to try pineapple coconut next!

Very good.  My one-year old LOVED these.  I wish they stuck together a little better, though.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips, and that was a perfect amount for us. I ran out of oats and used some rice krispies to make up the difference.  Next time I'll also add a litle coconut. Very flexible recipe.  Thanks!

Really good. I had to add extra honey to get it all to mix in together but overall really good. I was worried when they were baking how they would turn out but they ended up turning out well! They stick together and to not break apart at all! Really tasty and a good alternative to store bought.

I loved these granola bars. I used the suggestion to melt the butter. I did add extra honey and about 2 tablespoons more of butter. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. These bars are great.

These are great! I have all used this recipe as a guide line to make homemade granola. Follow this exactly except take away the chocolate chips. Instead of packing it into the pan crumble it around the pan. Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Cook for about 20 minutes on 325 degrees or till golden brown. Must let cool to make them crunchy!

These were great, really chewy. I added slivered roasted almonds and dried apricots. i followed the previous review and substituted half the butter with banana baby food. I also used multigrain flour rather than white.

These were really good, a big hit with my family and friends. It was quite crumbly we found, but got tighter after a while. I used half of a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips, half a cup of walnuts, and a cup of white chocalate chips. Next time i will probably use sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, because then the kids can take them to school, and they were slightly bitter in the sweet mixture. I will definaltly make these agian!

I am gluten intolerant so I substitute GF oats and GF flour and they taste great! Most other GF granola bars are pretty bad so I have enjoyed making my own! Thank you to the creator of this recipe!

Great recipe!  I added honey and used a full stick of butter, ww flour, omitted the chocolate chips and used 1 c. of mini M&Ms instead.  A huge hit with my kids, we'll definitely use this recipe often.  
Thank you!

This is the best granola recipe... Bye, bye to all the store granola bars.. I am definitely going to keep making it.. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and completely skipped the brown sugar and used only honey and half the chocolate chips.. I wonder if I can substitute butter with canola oil... Any suggestions??

Great recipe! They turned out great, the only changes made were omitting the sugar and the chocolate chips instead we used almonds, cranberries, hazelnuts and raisins. These bars are way better than the store bought kind and also cheaper.

LOVE this one! I was a little nervous b/c I'd never heard of chicken in chili and especially my husband who is in love with beef. But he raved about it! Even asked to have it for dinner the next night! I used black beans and frozen corn with a can or two full of water to make it more chili like. Otherwise it would have been more like meat for  tacos instead of something you eat out of a bowl. I had it with toritilla chips and my husband (who does this with everything) put it in tortillas. :D  Overall an excellent and easy dish to make!

These tasted great but were so crumbly. I failed to read other reviews before making these so I wonder if all the suggestions such as packing them tighter and adding extra honey would have worked. I also used craisins and a mix of dried fruit instead of chocolate chips plus some sunflower seeds.

Very good granola bar!  I used 3cups old fashion oats, 2 cups rice krispies, and used whole wheat four.  I also used Craisens, coconut, & chocolate chips!  My Kids loved them!!  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because they were very crumbly.  But all in all tasted great, and would make for great granola for yogurt!

This is the first time I've given a recipe this low a rating. It was dry, raw and fell apart.  It most likely needs double the butter/margarine and double the honey.  It needs more cooking time for this quantity as well. It looked nowhere like the picture. And I am an awesome baker.  I make my own granola to eat as cereal or with yogurt. It comes out brown and moist.  Sorry folks.

I make these with 1/2 c butter, and I don't add any sugar at all. The honey is plenty sweet. I also add wheat germ. I found that pressing them down in the pan as soon as they're out of the oven is very helpful in preventing them from crumbling.

These did not turn out for me, they crumbled.  We had granola crumble.  I made a batch with marshmallows and chocolate chips and another batch with sunflower seeds and crasins.  I was pretty dissapointed but atlease we have a nice crumble to put on yogurt and cereal.

Wonderful! I didn't have mini chocolate chips, I used the regular. I made a half batch, cooked for 15 minutes in a 8inch square pan. I did squish them down as hard as I could before baking and they held together quite well. Thanks for the recipe!

I crave these granola bars! I use to get store bought granola bars weekly and now I make them and put them in snack size ziploc bags and they are great for quick snacking and breakfast.  I love chocolate and I only use half what the recipe calls for. I also use a pizza cutter to cut them in a bar shape!

This was a great recipe :) I ended up adding more honey and butter...total 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 3/4 cup honey...simply because it seemed to need more glue.  I also did 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 C. coconut and 1/2 C. raw slivered almonds...they are great! Thanks for the recipe, I will make this more!

These turned out really great! I did make some changes to the recipe though. I used 3 cups of oats, 1 1/2 cups rice krispies, and whole wheat flour in place of white. I did 1/2 cup butter and 2 tbs. coconut oil. I kept the honey but used 1/3 cup of pure maple syrup insead of the brown sugar. I used 1 cup coconut and 1 cup raisins instead of the chocolate. They were really good and the kids loved them. I will make again!

This recipe is very tasty.  I modified it slightly and it still needs a bit more work but I am still giving it 4 stars based on taste.  I used 3 cup oats and 1.5 cup rice krispies.  Also cut brown sugar back to 2 TBSP, cut the choco chips back to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup raisins, also used the called for amount of butter.  It definitely DOES need more butter, mine turned out crumbly but I will still eat them.  Next time I will add the full cup of butter as mentioned by previous posters and hopefully the texture will be better.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!  Edited:  I made it a second time with 1 cup margarine, melted, and the consistency came out MUCH better!

These were good! The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because they had a really strong honey flavor. Still good though. I put half of the mixture in a 13x9" pan, then a layer of raspberry-peach jam, and then the rest of the oatmeal mixture. I made it for a snack for my daughter's preschool, they really liked it!

These are excellent! I took the advice of others and doubled the honey. My kids eat these up as soon as I am done getting them out of the pan. My husband loves them too. I think this is great. I have made them 3 times varying the add in ingredients. (Dried cranberries, apples, raisins, choc chips, or pecans, etc...)

This is delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1c.  butter, 1/2c. Honey, 1/2c. Applesauce.  Omit the brown sugar! They are way sweet with the chocolate chips already! Instead of just choc. chips, I used 2c. of "additives".  Which included choc. chips, shredded coconut, and craisans.

Definitely follow the directions on how to cut them or they may crumble.

Love these they were more the quaker chewy granola bars than any other recipe I have tried. I did freeze them after I cut them up and just pulled them out as needed. 
UPDATE: i have now made these several times and they are not quite what I want. They are too dry and I have tried everything to fix it and have not come up with a solution yet. I do keep trying because I like the idea of them.

These were SOOO good. I have two children and a daycare, ALL THE KIDS LOVED THEM!! And so did I!!
I used whole wheat flour, 1 cup butter, 1 cup honey and 1/3 cup splenda (instead of brown sugar). We didn't have choc chips, so I crushed up some m&m trail mix I had and they tasted so good. That was yesterday, they were such a hit, that I am making them again today with raisins... This is the first granola bar recipe I found that actually works - all of the ones in the past either fell apart or had a cake like texture... These are wonderful!!

These were a little bit crumbly, but overall a very good granola bar!  I like to make my own so that I know exactly what I'm eating, and the crumbles were worth it.  Next time I might bake a few minutes less for a softer texture.

Taste was fantastic, absolutely yummy, a tad sweet for me personally, but I eat non-sugar granola. My only concern...mine didn't really firm up, this could be eaten by the handful, or even as cereal...not bar like at all. :( also next time I will add some cinnamon, think it would compliment it a lot!

These are awesome.  We have been making these for over a year now in double batches.  We go with 1/3 cup brown sugar NOT firmly packed and they are sweet as can be.  For the double batch we bake it in a 15x17 pan just until the edges barely start to brown.  The kids cut out all the edges and crumble them to make cereal.  Sometimes we'll substitute some applesauce for all or part of the oil and they turn out great.  We have taken these on family vacations and other outings and undoubtedly everyone who has them wants the recipe.  This one is a real winner!

Very nice.  I read many reviews.  Although I didn't closely measure anything, mine turned out great.  I used the melted butter/marshmallow technique (1/3 of a bag of mini marshmallows).  I did measure the oats/crisped rice (2.5 cups oats, 2 cups rice).  I used no sugar other than maple syrup.  Added some coconut, a couple of big handfuls of chocolate chips, some trail mix, the last bit of craisins (about 1/4 cup maybe?) a good bit of peanut butter (maybe 2/3 cup?), and enough whole wheat flour so that it would bind everything together without making it crumble.  As one reviewer suggested, I gave it a good mash half way through baking.  These are terrific.  I may try olive oil next time to make it more heart healthy.  I fail to see how any halfway experienced baker could go wrong.  Next time, I think I'll drizzle some dark chocolate (antioxidants!) on the top.  Mine are not too sweet I think due to use of maple syrup and no extra sugar.

I tried this last night but with a few changes. I added 1 cup of regular chocolate chips, melted 6 large marshmallows with 10 tablespoons of butter, added a dash of cinnamon, a small box of raisins and 1 can of condensed milk (warmed it in hot water, about 1/2 cup of honey and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I took aluminum foil and lightly sprayed it with canola cooking spray placed it on top of the mixture and used a rolling pin to make it flat (works well because the foil didn't stick to the bars). Then I baked it for about 30 mins. My bars are golden brown and they are really soft but they also stick together. NO CRUMBLING OR FALLING APART... I think the melted butter and condensed milk did the trick!!

I read the reviews from people who have previously made this recipe and in general, everyone said the add more honey and butter so I did, but it was still very crumbly, they weren't "bars" when I served them, more a pile of granola, chocolate, raisins.etc with a few attached pieces here and there. It didn't quite impress as much as i expected it to.

Yummy!!!  Kids love these and they don't even realise I used whole wheat flour.  Great recipe that does not use peanut butter (allergy).  I used 1 cup choc chips and 1 cup marshmallows, very tasty.  Loved the oatmeal consistancy, i.e. not cake like.  I cut them after they had been out of the oven for approx 10 min., if not careful when taking out of the pan they broke in half.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will line pan with parch. paper.

I currently live in Tanzania, Africa and you cannot get granola bars so this recipe is fantastic!  All the ingredients are readily available and they are so easy to make.  My 2-year-old loves them!  I found that 2 cups of raisins was WAY TOO MUCH!  I only use one half cup and it is perfect.

After reading some of the previous reviews (re: the crumbly bars), I 
decided to add 1 cup of mini marshmallows and melted them down in the butter before I added it to the dry mix.  I also reduced the oatmeal  and chocolate chips and added cranberries, slivered almonds and coconut.  They turned out great and my kids love them. (eating and making them!!)

I don't have time to read all the reviews, but made these once following the recipe and they were a little dry.  So the second time I added 3/4 cup butter and about 3/4 honey.  They were much better and I like  the bit more sweetness.  Also the second time I added 1/2 cup wheat bran for added nutrition.  I'll probably stick with the 2/3 cup butter, but keep the extra honey.  Added walnuts, pecans and mini choc. chips.  They are so good.  I love them and so do my kids.  We were spending a fortune on store bought chewy granola bars, now I'll make these more.  I also love that there's no egg.  You could just bake this as granola and it's yummy.

Great recipe!  Thanks!  I made it twice:  1st with 1 1/2 cups chopped hazelnuts and 1/2 cup raisins.  2nd with 1 cup peanuts, 3/4 cups chopped hazelnuts and 1/4 cup raisins.  No chocolate chips so far; maybe next time.  Anyway, both came out very tasty -- and I didn't even have to change analogies of ingredients.  Kids loved them.  Thanks again!

good, chewy, sweet! I think next time I will try raisins and nuts, though, as opposed to choc chips. It was maybe a little too sweet as a snack, but made a good dessert-type cookie!

I, too, had crumbly bars the first time.  Rather than just doubling the butter, I add 2/3 Peanut Butter.  It helps things to stick a little better.  Still falls apart pretty easily though.

Pretty neat stuff. I didn't have enough honey, so the dryness was my own fault.  I added "craisins" and put melted chocolate on top

I make this recipe all the time for my kids.  They love it.  I too though change a few things.  I add more butter, sometimes peanut butter, more honey and if I am low on honey, I will add light corn syrup.  I always use about 1/2 of dried milk, as I am always looking for a way to sneak in calcium.  I also always add a variety of sweets, chocolate chips, m & m's, peanuts, raisins, and peanut butter chips.  Even if it crumbles, we eat it in yogurt and right out of a bowl with a spoon.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Was horribly disappointed in the recipe! They were bland and crumbling, a waste of perfectly good ingredients as I tossed the entire pan after sampling...of course I read all the reviews AFTER making them and see that everyone has increased the honey and butter. (maybe the recipe could fixed with these changes??) 
I am a gluton for punishment and will try the recipe again with the suggestions everyone made. Hopefully my second batch will turn out better!

I used half a cup of butter and 1/4 cup peanut butter.  Used about 3/4 cup of honey and I was low on chocolate chips.  I probably only got half a cup worth in the recipe.  Had intended to throw in raisins and some nuts but it smelled very good as it was.  They turned out very tasty.  It could have used the additional chocolate or raisins or something else to make it perfect.  The texture was perfect though, no crumbling and they were just chewy enough.  However, they're still amazingly good even with the lack of ingredients that I used.  A great recipe and much better than store bought granola bars.  Husband scarfed most of them down in just a couple of days.

These were good, but I think they can be improved. I made them using about 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup honey, as some had suggested (due to crumbliness), but they were extremely sweet and much more like cookies than granola bars. I put in half chocolate chips and half craisins.  Next time I make them I will try substituting applesauce for some or all of the honey. This is definitely a recipe worth some experimentation.

These bars were very tasty, however, I followed the advice of others and increased the butter and honey to 1 cup each.  I feel this was unnecessary for that much butter, next time I think I will make with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of honey.  They were very sweet with chocolate in them, I think next time I may go with dried fruit and less chocolate.

This recipe was great! I omitted the butter completely to make them less fattening, and upped the honey to a whole cup. To make stirring a little easier, I heated the honey in the microwave for 20 seconds. Also, I used 2 cups of oatmeal and 2 cups of KASHI GO LEAN CRUNCH, in place of the 4/1/2 cups of oatmeal, then used 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top. They turned out excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Unbelievable!! I took everyone's advice and added about 3/4 c marg. and a full cup of honey.  I wrapped these individually and froze them to put in my kids' lunches.  They are a hit! I will never buy a box of granola bars again.  After they have been frozen they are not even a little crumbly!  Every morning, I just stick one in each lunch box, straight out of the freezer.

This is a great basic recipe.  I made changes as per the recommendations of many others, such as doubling the honey and omitting the brown sugar. Increased the butter to a cup.  Subbed one of the cups of oats with a cup of rice krispies. I added sunflower seeds, chia seeds, and hemp hearts for protein and fibre.  Packed them into the kids' lunchboxes today, so the final verdict will come from them after school.  The piece I tasted was delicious!

I made these today. Followed the recipe exactly.  They are very very tasty. I used a 2-cup combination of dried cherries, pecans, chocolate chips, and coconut.  My only issue is they aren't holding together very well.  I'll still make them again, though, they are so good.

These are great! My daughter's chomping one now. I made them exact to recipe except I only had 1 1/2 cups of oats so I broke up 1/2 a cup of pretzels and adde that. Other then a few pieces that crumbled off when I cut them they're perfectly chewy! My daughter said "we gotta make these all the time!"

I feel bad rating this as a "like it" because it was a great starter recipe, but the original just didn't turn out as soft/ chewy as I wanted. I wanted a bar that would hold together but have the softness/ chewiness of a Cliff bar (but with oats). After reading other reviews, I upped the butter (melted) and (raw) honey both to one full cup each, replaced 1/2 cup oats with 1 cup brown rice crispies, decreased the brown sugar to a scant 1/4 cup, used all fine-ground whole-wheat flour instead of AP, and added 1/4 cup each ground golden flax meal, red flax seeds, and wheat bran. To the dry ingredients (which I mixed together thoroughly before incorporating the wet) I added 1/8 tsp fine sea salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I stuck to the 2 cups add-ins (dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, chopped whole raw almonds, and a small sprinkling of chopped dark chocolate). Pressed it HARD into a 9X13 pan and baked for about 16 minutes, pressed firmly into pan again, and baked another 3 minutes just till the sides looked like they were barely starting to brown... it will seem too soft at first but hardens as it cools!!! Cool 10 min, sliced into thin bars (I got 24 pcs) using a plastic fork (it doesn't stick this way) and then let it continue to cool for another hour in a cold kitchen... then re-sliced them, squishing slightly to keep their shape, and wrapped into individual bars with plastic. SO GOOD! Perfectly gorgeous, chewy and delicious!

Very tasty! I took some advice from previous reviewers and made my own additions. Instead of 2/3 c butter, I used 3/4 c margarine and 1/4 c peanut butter. I also increased honey (no more than 1 c of honey total), replaced 1 c of rolled oats with unsalted sunflower seeds, and used whole wheat flour. I used Rogers Porridge Oats (which also contains flax seed and wheat bran), and 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips instead of the recommended 2 cups of choc chips.  I also recommend freezing them for a bit.

I have made this recipe a few times now and each time it turns out great! The first time I added Raisins and walnuts and this past time I added dried apricots and dried pineapple and a splash of lemon juice. I also changed out 1/2 flour for 1/2 c whole wheat flour and they turned out great!

Amazing bars! The recipe is simple and you can add in bonus goodies (currants, cranberries, flax seeds, etc) with no issue. I've made this substituting the butter with applesauce, makes it lower fat and a bit softer. Yum!

So this sounded like an awesome start for making something usable out of all those cereal boxes that were sitting in my cupboard.  I took all the kashi, granola, cornflakes, steel-cut oatmeal, etc that had been opened but not eaten in the last 3 months and dumped it into a VERY big stainless steel bowl.  20 cups worth!  So I somewhat randomly quadrupled/pentupled(?) the recipe for the liquids.  I added in molasses, corn syrup (trying to empty my cupboards!), lots of brown sugar, NO flour - I figured there would be plenty from the cereal, some egg whites that I needed to use up (and would help bind the recipe).  Blended it all up, then split it up into 3 batches.  Added peanut butter to one batch (YUM!), chocolate chips to the next (YUMM!) and craisins to the other!  Its all cooking right now, but it smells delicious.  I expect some falling apart, but hey it's homemade.  Going to let it cool, cut into bars and serve it up!
...
Came out wonderful!

Oh my, gooey, chewy granola love!
Based on other comments, I made the following changes: substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat in all purpose flour, increased to 1 cup of butter, and added 1/2 cup of molasses to the 1/2 cup honey. Then I divided the batter in two: 1 for chocolate chips (I used 3/4th cup) for the kids, and 1 for fruits and nuts (cranberries, walnuts) for me. It came out darker than the pictures because of the molasses, but oh, so rich & delicious. Also, gooey in the first half hour, but chewy later. I'm looking forward to trying this with dates and cashews and other combos. Loved the simplicity of the recipe -- thank you and bless you!

Very good. rather than 2 cups of choc chips I used 1/2 c raisin, 1/2 c chia seeds. 1/2 c hemp hearts, and 1/2 c choc chips, YUM! I also ground half the oats for a finer texture and used brown rice syrup rather than honey.

Great and easy recipe. I added bits of dried apricots and used about half the chocolate chips. Next time will try with a bit less flour to reduce crumbliness which is not too much anyway.

I thought these were great!  I did use recommendations to use a little more butter and honey.  And 1 cup of chocolate chips are more than enough unless you want them very sweet.  I didn't have any problems with crumbling.  When they came out of the oven I pushed down on them a little more and came out fine.  All granola/snack bars crumble a little, even the store bought ones.   I'm going to make these with toffee pieces today, can't wait to try!

I had so much hope for this recipe , but it turned out so dry , i baked it for 18 minutes but it didnt cook and it didnt hold , so i pured a can of condensed milk evenly on the top and baked it for an extra 10 minutes for 325 and it turned so tasty and moist

after i put in all the basic ingredients i split the batter in half and in one half added chocolate chips and peanut butter and in the other half craisins and chocolate chips to make my entire family happy. they were a hit! gone in a matter of hours!! though i was looking for something slightly healthier and these tasted sweet.. but my siblings loved them! i guess they will be just a healthier alternative to a dessert! try adding rice krispies.. they add a nice crunch!

This is a great recipe. It is not overly sweet and easy to put together. It can be a little crumbly. I love how you can add so many of the "treat" ingredients. I have not made the same granola twice yet! A granola you can customize easily!

Very good granola recipe and I like that it's easy to add other ingredients to change up the flavor.

Just made these and was very underwhelmed.  I did skip the brown sugar based on some of the other reviews and only did a 1/2 c. of choc chips.  It was sweet enough, but I also subbed canola oil for the butter b/c we're trying to cut back on saturated fats...I guess it needs the butter.  :)

I followed the recipe, they came out very dry and crumbly.  The family did not approve.

The taste was great, but I found they were very dry. I would agree with the others about upping the liquid content, but instead of honey perhaps corn syrup would also be a good alternative. I also found them quite sweet, so I would likely take out a few of the chocolate chips, particularly if I upped the honey/liquid in it. Making them a little thinner (using a 9x13 and a smaller pan) would probably help a little more as well.

I thought these tasted good but mine came out extremely dense!  I would probably do what some of the other reviewers recommend and add some rice crispies when I make again.  Also I halved the chocolate chips, 2 cups was ALOT!!  All in all a good basic recipe that can be modified to most individual tastes.

My kids love them! SUPER EASY! You do need to add more honey and butter though. Oh, and I added peanut butter. You also need to press hard in the pan before cooking. DON'T over cook or they will get hard and crumble.  They to me are more like a cookie, but I KNOW what is going in them and we too rip though the store bought ones that are packed with junk!

I just made these and they are still warm. I omitted the br. sugar and they are still sweet. I used applesauce for some of the butter. I added coconut, peanuts and raisins along with the choc. chips. They are so good.

This is an excellent recipe!  Very tasty!  I used gluten free oats and gluten free baking mix, and for the two cups of chocolate chips, I substituted a cup and a half of diced apple and a half cup of cinnamon chips.  They turned out great!  Chewy, moist, and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I added 1 c. coconut, half cup of nuts and only used a half a cup of chocolate chips. Hubby loved them and suggested maybe adding peanut butter next time because I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I've successfully substituted cereal for the rolled oats.  When there's a handful of cereal left from the many boxes in my cupboard, I just dump them all together and reduce the rolled oats accordingly.  I always have a new recipe.  I add dried cranberries and nuts, seed too.  It always works!

nice and chewy. I used less than 4 cups oats and 1/2 cup butter and added nuts and raisins and about a teaspoonful of cinnamon as I did not have chocolate chips. Because the mixture was dry, I added about one tablespoonful of creamer dissolved in half a cup of water. Note: I rolled the mixture before placing in the pan, very good advice. However, I pressed it about 5 minutes before it was done, which I think caused it to lose its fluffiness. Next time I will definitely skip this step.

These are really good, I changed the recipe a little with great results!  I like crunchy and chewy, so instead of mashed banans as others have suggested, I put some dried banan chips in a baggie and pounded them to smitherines with a meat tenderizing hammer to make fine crumbles and stirred them in too. Also, I used a little molasses, which makes it different and extra good.  I agree, you need to melt the butter, and can add liquidy ingredients separately (vanilla, molasses), it's easier to mix this way.

As other reviewers noted, the taste is excellent but they were way too dry and fell apart.  I am praying a night in the fridge does them some good because they are for my daughter's first grade class snack tomorrow!  Very bummed on this recipe...think I'll go back to my old I was using that were way more moist.  Truly can't figure out how so many people raved on this one.

Great start for whatever you like to add!  I added peanutbutter, flax seed, and chopped almonds.  Also added an egg and a little milk to help it hold together.  Took the advice of another reviewer and pressed firmly half way through baking.  Family really likes this.  I'm sure we will use it for a variety of variations on Granola Bars - thanks for the recipe.

Great! The kids were unsure about these at first, but they are so much nicer than store bought. I added mini M&Ms to entice them at first.   Tap down at least once or twice during baking to help compress them. I also substituted in 1 cup of rice crispies in for some added crunchiness.

Great base recipe!  I add a few T. of ground flax seed, cut down on the butter to 1/2 c. & add creamy organic peanut butter.  You can add raisins, nuts, etc. and change the add-ins each time! My kids love these!

Delicious! i think these are wayy better than the store bought chewy granola bars. i didnt have any miniature chocolate chips so i just chopped some regular chocolate chips up in my nut chopper and they were great next time i'll add nuts too! UPDATE: I have made this recipe a boat load of times-love it! i have tried them once with mini i choc. chips which was much easier than chopping regular size choc. chips. either way i think they are fantastic

These were excellent.  I made them with my kids.  I was able to leave out any nuts, due to my son being allergic, and they went over great.  Better for you and cheaper than buying.  Plus they don't have any of those preservatives.

These are fantastic.  To make them a little healthier I substituted most of the butter with apple sauce, used half whole wheat flour and exchanged about 1/3 cup of oats for ground flax.  Then for the 2 cups of mix-ins I used a little bit of everything in the cupboard.  Coconut, raisins, crasins, almonds, walnuts, chocolate chips.  Mmmm, so good!

First time I had made granola bars and did these for my Sunday School class.  They were a hit.  Excellent basic recipe to change around with different add-ins.

These were good. A little dry, but a great base recipe to mess around with. Kids gobbled them up!

I've made this recipe several times for my family.  I've even substituted one cup of oats for one cup of rice crispies.  I like to add dried cranberries and substitute the chocolate chips for butterscotch or peanut butter chips.  The possibilites are endless.  I do firmly press the mixture in the pan before and after baking to keep the bars from being crumbly.

These granola bars are great! After I moved from America, I initially had a constant craving for store boughten peanut butter granola bars! So I found this recipes, and simply exchanged the butter for peanut butter. It's great! I make it for car trips or fun summer days.

Great granola bars.  I used some of the suggestions from others (3cups oats, 1cup rice crispy) and cut butter to 1/4cup and added 1cup of apple sauce.  This helps to keep bars moist and chewy....yummy!

These are a huge hit in our household!  The only change I made to the recipe was to cream the honey and butter together before adding the dry ingredients.  I had been looking at other recipes and several recommended this.  I also subbed whole wheat flour, but otherwise made them exactly as indicated.  Healthy?  Maybe not, but better than the store bought kind!  Now to try dried apples and cinnamon instead of chocolate chip!

Fantastic recipe.  I've shared it with so many friends and it keeps getting passed around.  I love to try all different combinations.  One of my favorites is craisins and white chocolate chips.  Just be careful, the pan disappears quickly.

The first time I tried it I added 1 c raisins instead of choc chips. I mixed everything according to directions and it was so dry when i put it in the pan. I rolled it with a rolling pin in the pan to pack it down and then after 6 min of baking took it out and rolled again. I tried to cut the bars but it was just a crubly mess! I put it back in a mixing bowl and added 1 c peanut butter, 1/2 c oil, 1/2 c vanilla coffee syrup which was heated to smooth. I put this new mixture into the pan and rolled with a rolling pin. Then I had an idea of taking another jelly roll pan and sprayed the bottom with cooking spray and put it on top of the bars to help flatten them. I even stepped on them to help them flatten. These new bars are definitely chewy and have some flavor!

These were amazing. i did add a bit more butter as others suggested, and I had to substitue 1/2cup of oatmeal with rice krispies because I ran out of oatmeal, but they were so good. We made one batch with mini m&m's and one batch with raisins and chopped dried apricot. Both were a huge hit. Mine didnt crumble, but i pressed them down really hard before baking and gently after baking. We are baking around dairy and nut allergies, so this recipe was perfect for us.

I was looking for a recipe that would be healthy and delicious - this one is it!  My alterations were: 1/3 c. flax seeds, 1/3 c. sunflower seeds, 1/3 c. pumpkin seeds.  I omitted the chocolate chips except for at the very end of the baking, I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top (maybe 1/4 cup minis) just to add some sweet.  They came out really good!  Thanks!

I made these one day and they turned out phenomenal! I read through the tips and did the following: I added less margarine and more peanut butter, added dried cranberries.  Mixture was still dry so I used a bit of water and packed down in pan. Once it was almost done baking (4 mins) I used spatula to press down mixture once again, and it worked great! Once it cooled I cut into squares and wrapped individual pieces in saran wrap and froze them, wonderful snack and breakfast on the run!

Fabulous recipe.  I changed the 4 1/2 cups of oats to 3 and added 1 1/2 cups rice krispies. I also changed the reg flour to wheat flour.  And cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup adding 1 cup golden raisins.  My kids can't get enough of them.     The 2nd time I made them I cut the sugar & honey in 1/2 then baked them on a cookie sheet.  they were thinner and crispier.  Still amazing!!!  They seemed to last a bit longer since I had more of it to cut.

My daughter LOVES these as does my hubby.  It is a great basic recipe where you can mix and match the "flavor" combinations and totally make it your own.  I've already made this a few times and since I'm not a big fan of chocolate chips in my granola bars I substituted raisens, cranberries, chopped walnuts, slivered almonds, diced dried apple and cinnimon (not all at the same time mind you).  I also opted to use a sheet pan instead of a 9x13 and pressed the  mixture down into it with my rolling pin.  My bars don't fall apart but aren't hard either.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful, user friendly recipe.  Bye, bye quaker granola bars, I've got something better in the house :)

These are awesome, and the possibilities for variations are endless, we've made them many times now, and I'll continue to do so.  It makes me feel good that I've cut the chemicals/processed  out of another one of my families' staple foods, and saved money doing so!!  Highly recommend these!

If there ever was an ideal recipe to use my Pampered Chef measure all cup, this is it.  It's the best tool for measuring the sticky ingredients(I also add PB) as well as the dry.  I only have to wash one cup rather than several.

I adapted the recipe by cutting raisins to a half cup and adding a half cup of chocolate chips. I avoided the sticky bar problem by using a silicone sbaking liner. I cut the bars before putting them in the oven and then compacted the bars when they were still warm. This is a good recipe.

This recipe is very sweet.  Definitely cut back on the sugar as the honey adds a lot of sweetness on its own.  A great starter recipe on granola bars.  Thank you.

I was very disappointed in these, not at all what I think of as a granola bar. The Ingredients seem good but both my attempts turned the bars into mush. The first I used quick oats & WW Flour & added strawberry bits. They came out very dark and mushy,(assumed fault of the strawberries, quick oats, and overcooking) The recipe is rated well so I gave it another try this time with long cooking oats, and used dried fruit & nuts. I also added a dab of peanut butter for flavor and used less flour They still ended up crumbly but not as mushy--to my dismay the nuts and crispies still lost their crunch. :( These looked & tasted better before baking. After two failed attempts I'm moving on to look for a better cooking method.

These are FANTASTIC!! I have made these about 6 or 7 times now in the past 3 weeks. So easy and good. I make them because we try to cut back on buying snacks at the store due to costs. The changes I made to make them fit my household were these: instead of 1 cup of flour I used 1 cup of my house flour which is: 1/3C of wheat germ, 1/3C whole wheat flour and 1/3C of unbleached all purpose flour. Then I added dried bing cherries, some chocolate chips and pecans. The batch I am making now have craisins, chocolate chips and almonds. My children can't stop eating these and they are perfect for their lunch snacks and after school and sports snacks. Thank you!!!

I've tried several different recipes, and with the advice of other posters, I think I've hit it right and my recipe search is over!!  The bars I made were chewy, stayed together, and tasted great.  I did one thing differently than any other posters, and that was to add some loose granola that I had previously made to the mix.  So, my recipe was 2 c. oats, 1 c. granola, 1 c. flour,1.3 c. brown sugar, 1 t. b. soda and, 1 t. valilla. I melted 1 stick butter, 1 c. honey, 5 marshmallows together.  Then I threw in raisins, choc. chips, rice crispies, and wheat germ.  The mix was wet but not soupy before baking.  Next time I will make a double or triple batch!

this is a really good recipe they end up nice and chewy! And just for gas cooker users the temperature is gas mark 2-3. the rice crispies worked great in it and i melted the butter and honey in a bowl in the microwave 30 secs at a time and then added vanila, sugar, flour and oats in that order. when you mix all the ingredients in that way and leave out the oats it makes a brilliant ice-cream sauce!!

These are delicious bars, however I would describe them more as cookie bars rather than granola bars.  I substituted applesauce for most of the butter, and added craisins, raisins, and pecans as mixins.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and made a few changes:  Increased butter to 2/3 c; Increased honey to 3/4 c; decreased chocolate chips to 1/3 cup; Used 2 cups rice crispies and 2.5 cups quick oats.  These are awesome!  I have tried multiple variations: added peanut butter chips once.  My favorite variation was to substitute dried dates for the chocolate chips and add cinnamon and nutmeg.  This recipe is very fun to play with.  A consistent crowd pleaser.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good and easy. I was looking for a healthy homemade snack for the kids and was happy that I had every ingredient on hand. Came out great and everyone loved them. We cut them smaller as they are rich and filling. Will make again and again with more variations. Thanks!!

I have to be fair...this is the best granola I have ever had.  True, it is a bit crumbly, but I add extra honey to ensure it sticks together sufficiently.  I made it once, and then the next day found myself making more.  THE WHOLE 9X13 PAN WAS GONE IN ONE DAY!!!  Rave reviews from my other guinuea pigs as well.  Great present.

I've made these twice now and they've come out well each time.  I played around with many of the suggestions people made (adding a bit more honey and butter, using some wheat germ, using oats...)
I used all whole wheat pastry flour and oats.  The biggest trick seems to be really PUSHING the suckers into the pan.  They came out pretty solid.  A bit fragile when first cut but since I store them in the freezer once cut they keep great and frankly taste good right out of the freezer.  So far they are a hit in lunches too.  Yay!  Just don't tell my kids they have wheat germ and other "healthy stuff" in them. :-)

This recipe made more than what I thought was good for a 9 x 13 pan, they were too fat for my liking but my husband ate 4 in the 1st 2 minutes of having found them, then asked for 2 more right after. He loves them.  
I will be making these often, but when making them for me I will try a 9x13 and a 8x8 I think.
I put chocolate chips on one side and sunflower kernels and raisins on the other.  My 4 year liked them too, thank you :)

I originally made this as a gift but it turned out so well I immediately made another batch to take on our vacation.  They stayed nice and chewy for days even though they weren't kept very well.  As good as store bought (better than some) and not a bit crumbly!

These are pretty tasty.  I added Cheerios and Rice Krispies for "Added Texture".  I also used a few mini M&M's and mini choc chips.  Used less honey and about 1 tablespoon more brown sugar.  Use good oats, b/c you can taste the difference.  I use thick cooking rolled oats.  Baked about 20 minutes.  Good.  Cant wait to try diff fruits or white choc chips.

Tastes good and homey. I substituted vegetable oil for butter, used more honey instead of sugar, and subbed 1 cup each of raising and almonds/walnuts for chocolate chips. I also used half the amount of flour lister, and processed some 2-3 cups of branflakes and quaker squars in the blender, instead of some of the oatmeal. All in all, turned out more like dense oatmeal cookies, rather than granola bars. Still good though, even if it's too sweet and heavy for my idea of a bar. Good recipe, will make it again with some more alterations.

Not bad - but we found them way too crumbly - it needs either an egg or more honey etc.. to bind it better. Also a bit too many choco chips.

I subbed a cup of the oatmeal with a cup of raisin bran cereal.

This is such a great snack.  It's healthy and sweet at the same time.  The bars really taste like chocolate chip cookies to me.  It's easy to make.  I usually have all of the ingredients on hand to make it.  One of my favorites!!

Well, I didn't taste any since I'm one of those following the low carb thing.  Anyway, everyone at work loved them & they smelled wonderful.  I too added the 1c.butter/1c.honey...wanted to make sure they stayed soft..and they did! For the 2c.choc chips, I did 1c.choc.chips, 1/2c.sunflower seeds, 1/2 raisens!  Combinations are endless, thanks!

I thought these were great. They were exactly what I was looking for. I've made them 4 or 5 times now and I've had NO complaints. They are typically gone within the day. I normally cut back the oats to 4 cups and add 1/2 cup of ground pecans. I substitute raisins for chocolate chips and add peanut butter chips. Depending on what I add, it may be necessary to increase honey and butter to maintain the soft texture.   So they are a hit with our family and my 19 month old LOVES them.

YUMMY!!!  My daughter inhales these and she doesnt care for granola bars too much.  I used less butter and more honey and they still turned out fantastic.  This is a very tasty way to get some fiber into your diet.

Did as others recommended, increased honey and butter. Used a jelly roll pan also, these are very good, dough hooks make adding the nuts and chocolate chips easy, also I decreased the oats by 1/2 cup. THANKS for the recipe.

Excellent!! Easy and very yummy...add whatever you prefer. We added toasted chopped almonds and walnuts and mini m&ms. I increased the honey to 3/4 c. and decreased the butter to about 6 tblspns. These came out great. Will make again and try new additions like peanut butter. Thanks Nancy for a tasty snack!!

Wow! I used 1/4 c. honey and 3/4 c. maple syrup.  I substituted 3/4 c. chopped walnuts and 1 1/4 c. raisins for the chocolate chips.  These bars were a HUGE hit with my family.  Next time I will sub 1/4 c. coconut for some of the raisins. Gonna make these for Christmas.  Definately!

Fantastic recipe!  I find the best way to get the ingredients thoroughly mixed, is to use clean hands to moosh it all together.  It's difficult to really accomplish this otherwise.  I made these bars with a kids cooking class that I teach - the kids loved them and the all the parents requested the recipe!

I really liked the flavor of these. I added the extra honey as many suggested, but they were still quite crumbly, which is messy with a 3 year old.  He helped me make them, they are quite easy.  I used mini choc. chips and a bit of coconut...perhaps the coconut made it drier?  I will try these again, but leave out the coconut as see what happens.  I wrapped them up individually and they stored well in the fridge for quite awhile.

Good, but misleading. This is not a recipe for granola bars, but a recipe for oatmeal cookie dough. We liked it, though.

This came out really great on my first try.  I subbed applesauce for the shortening and used 1 cup of honey as suggested.  I think it is really critical to mix thoroughly after each addition and not to press the mix into the pan until the dough has a gooey texture all over.  I used a regular baking sheet with 1/2 inch ridges and I got 36 perfect looking bars.  I used raisins, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg to have bars which tasted like oatmeal raisin cookies.  Thanx for the recipe!

The bars taste really good, but you have to add a lot more honey than the recipe calls for, and you have top make sure that when you mix it, the honey gets distributed evenly, otherwise the bars crumble.  I found that it was a kind of messy thing to make, but it was very easy and fun, and to help with cleanup-- it tastes great uncooked, too!

Wholesome and good. The granola bars are even good if you substitute applesauce for the oil! Chocolate chips, peanut butter, and nuts are good additions.

My fussy 7 year old cannot get enough of these bars!  We definately like these better than the ones from the store.  I have tried many others but this is the one we all like.

These granola bars are similar to oatmeal cookies and should be baked in a similar manner (i.e. under cooked and allowed to cool and set).  I ensure that I really press down when I put them into the pan to get a good solid base to start with.  They will fall apart a bit, but that's because they're soft and gooey!  Instead of chocolate chips I usually add raisins and/or sunflower seeds and. or pumpkin seeds , etc to give it a bit of a healthier profile.  I bag them in the little zip lock snack bags (don't worry, I reuse them over and over and over!)  and store them in my cookie jar for the kids as a healthier alternative to actual cookies.

These baked well and the instructions were clear. Next time, I will be cutting the sugar and honey back a little... very very sweet.

Wonderful recipe! Simple and to the point. My suggestion much like the others who have tried this recipe is, YES; add another 1/2 of honey and just make it an even 1 cup of butter. The granola will be very dry and crumble without. I added only 1/3 cup chocolate chips (wanted healthier, not sweeter). Along with that though I went with a mixture of Brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, and walnuts. For my dried fruits I did blueberries, cranberries, and cherries. Delightful!

My family loves these. I use coconut oil to grease the pan and coconut flour in place of all purpose. Also add some water due to using the coconut flour. Store great in freezer as well.

These granola bars are great and aren't just eaten by the kids around here!  The only change I make is to change out two cups of oats for two cups of Rice Krispies.  I love by-passing the boxes of granola bars at the grocery store!

Very disappointed with the texture. It was so crumbly that it fell apart. The flavor is good the recipe is flexible (nuts, fruit, etc.) The problem is with the base syrup it seems. Perhaps adding a nut butter like peanut butter or almond butter might help the texture. If it would have held together as a bar I would have given it high marks. Its easy, good tasting, and flexible in add ins, but with its falling to small crumbles I'll be looking for a different recipe. After all I was looking for chewy granola bars not chewy granola crumbles.

These granola bars tasted good, but like other people, they fell apart when it was time to take them out of the pan.  I will try this recipe again, but I will try other people's suggestions to moisten them up.  Lucky for me, my kids don't care how they look as long as they taste good.  I think I would let them cool a little longer also before cutting them.

I loved these! They may have sugar, but homemade granola bars are much healthier than store bought ones with preservatives. The only modifications that I made were that I added whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, I added one stick of butter and three tablespoons of margarine because I didn't have enough butter, and I reduced the chocolate chips to one cup. Next time I will press as firmly as possible since these ones came out crumbly. Other reviewers also suggested increasing the butter and honey to one cup each. It sounds great to add other "toppings" like coconut, raisins, and chopped pecans, walnuts, or almonds. It may also be good to add some flaxseed, wheat germ, or protein powder for extra nutrition.

Loved the recipe: a nice alternative to cookies.  Used maple syrup ins. of honey and left out the br. sugar.  Have tried various combinations of dried fruits/nuts/chocolate and they are always a hit. Enjoyed the video version - helps a lot in getting it just right.

These granola bars are pretty good as written, just a bit too sweet. I made them a second time, substituting 1 cup of crispy rice cereal for 1 cup of oats, cutting the amount of chocolate chips in half, from 2 cups to  just 1, and decreasing the brown sugar to 2 T. This was the perfect recipe for our family, a wonderful balance of ingredients.

I've made these plenty of times always doubling the recipe for my large family. I always find I need to increase the butter to 1/2 cup.  Add some more honey, and I also add almonds, flax seed, craisins, coconut and sometimes white chocolate. I find that dates make them chewy as well and add some sweetness.

I have been using this recipe as a base for about 3 years, I substitute 1 cup of Rice Krispies and 1/2 cup granola for 1.5 cups of the oats and I have used raisins and butterscotch chips and even fresh fruit instead of the chocolate chips. The key to keeping them chewy is to make sure there is a good serving of honey in there. If it's crumbly going into the pan then it will be crumbly coming out, also pack down into the pan well to cook.

I make a batch and a half of these at least once a week on a Pampered Chef lg bar pan. To take them to the next level, use local honey. It adds so much more flavor than the store bought. I follow the recipe except for increasing honey to 2/3 cup and decreasing choc. to one cup while adding 1 cup of dried cherries, cranberries, sliced almonds, or other nuts.

This was a bit dense so I only add 2 1/2 cups oats & then add 2 cups rice crispy cereal. It makes the bars lighter without losing flavor. Also I really like to add 1 tsp cinnamon & about 2 tbsp peanut butter to the mix. I found that it mixes better when u combine the butter, honey, & peanut butter separately and mix it with the dry ingredients. wonderful recipe!! I make this weekly for my kids!! :)

I made these and did a bit of tweaking, as did some of the other reviewers I've seen. I used whole wheat flour instead of AP, used shortening (vegetable) instead of butter, and agave nectar instead of the honey. They were DELICIOUS.

I used quick oats b/c thats what I had on hand - big mistake! But the flavour is still good. They turned out brownie like instead of granola bar like. Used 1/2 of applesauce, 1/2 butter and 1/2 honey and I added a couple handfuls of s/s choc chips and mini marshmallows. Will try again with rolled oats!

I made these today and agree with others who say the mixture was too dry and crumbly.  I managed to cut some into squares, but they were not nice and tight, and falling apart.  The taste was terrific, I added walnuts and dried chopped apricots, as well as mini choc chips and even a little bit of rice krispies and though the mix seemed wet enough, they did not hold together.  Wondering if a beaten egg or two might have helped, but I will research other granola bars to see if they ever add an egg to it.

Excellent. Chewy and moist, just as promised. I had to add 1/4c corn syrup to mine because the dry ingredients just wouldn't stick with only the butter and honey and a little splash of canola oil for the same reason. Other than that, I used the recipe exactly as is.

They turned out great.....My family and grandchildren loved them.....I wanted to make it more healthier by using all- purpose wheat flour instead of white flour....I also used sunflower seeds, walnuts and raisins instead of chocolate chips. Now that I no how to make them it  will save me a lot of money then buying them at the store

Great recipe, will use it over and over. I read the other reviews before making, I omitted the brown sugar and increased the honey to just under a cup (I only had cinnamon honey) and they turned out a tad too sweet for my liking, I did increase the butter only to help mixture stay together. I added chocolate chips and crasins, I may only add half a cup of each, since they turned out sweet from the honey and chocolate. I will try different variations to find the perfect recipe.

These taste really good, but they ended up very crumbly, I almost needed a bowl to eat them.  I will try making these again but adding an egg to try and hold it together.

Very good however they just kept breaking apart.  I am thinking if I use an egg next time it would help them stay together instead of just crumbling.

I made these once and adding peanut butter chips also; they taste good. But my only critique is that they break up to easily.  How do keep them from not breaking up so easily?  What can I add to the recipe? If anybody knows please tell me. thanks!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. First, I used 5 cups of old fashioned oats, since it was what I had on hand. I used about a stick of butter, melted and a mashed, ripe banana to make up for the rest. I kept the rest of the measurements the same but did not use chocolate chips. Instead I added some shredded coconut and cinnamon.I think it's really important to separate your wet and dry ingredients and melt the butter to make sure your bars don't come out crumbly. I do think the final product did come out a bit drier than I expected but next time, I'll be sure to adjust. I might add a bit more sugar or honey as well.

Very tasty and customizable!  I patted it down really hard before and after baking it and it held together great!  Next time, I may try it without the brown sugar to be healthier.

These were really good. I didnt have honey so I looked online for substitutes and ended up using water and sugar mixture.  I pressed them hard into the pan with a large plastic spatula then when they were fresh out of the oven, I pressed them done firmly again.  They were not crumbly at all and they were perfect for school lunches. I will add less sugar next time as they tasted more like an oatmeal cookie than a granola bar. 
The kids loved them!

lOVE THIS RECIPE.   I used the substitutions as suggested (1 cup of honey, Melted butter).  I also used half cup white and half cup wheat flour.  Came out a little dry so I may decrease the oats the next time

i subbed 1.5 cups of oats for 1.5 cups of rice crispies. they came out very good but there is too much chocolate chips. i would recommend cutting the chocolate in half. when they were done (18mins), i took them out and pressed them flat with a metal turner to compact the granola sheet. i let them sit out and cut them after 30 mins. i then wrapped them and put in the refridge. stayed nice and together.

I cut the ingredients of this recipe in half because its only me and my daughter.  After making them, I'm so glad I did! LOL, they were so good I wouldve eaten them all.  Its not exactly a good thing to oo while dieting.  I made a vegan version by using Earth Balance Butter and no chocolate chips.  I used glazed walnuts and dried pecans for my 'filling'. I added a dash of cinnamon too! I also smashed down the mixture once it came out of the oven.  I just ate 2 and is nearly 1am...!  Can't wait to cut these up and make more for my friend on Saturday!

Okay don't use left over cereal bags to line your pan, but otherwise these are GREAT! I tried to be thrifty and luckily I only bake them half way, pull them out to press and that is when I noticed my bag was kind of melting :)  A great way to use left over cereal.  I used 2 cups cereal 2 cups rolled oats, 1 stick butter (1/2 cup) and 2/3 cup honey and only 1 cup mini chips.  I have picky kids and they love them, kind of sweet but its a lot cheaper than buying them.  I made two batches, one for home and one to give to my son at college.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Worked for us!  I read the reviews and used 1 stick of melted butter and 3/4 cups of honey to keep it from being dry.  I didn't have all the chips required but used what I had and it was still a big hit at our house with the.  I loved them too!  My only question is: regular rolled oats or quick cooking.  I used regular but I wonder if quick cooking would not have worked better?

Good.  I made it as is, except used only 1 cup choc. chips and added in some craisins and a little flax.
Better than the store kind, but I'm not much a granola bar lover anyway.

This recipe is decent at best. If you have to change a bunch of things to get what you want, it is a good first step but not a great finished product, hence the three stars. Needs work and several tries to get so it's good.

We love these at our house!  I always add some flax seed powder and decrease the butter to 1/2 c. and compensate with a little extra honey.  Our favorite mix-ins are mini chocolate chips, raisins, or dried blueberries or cranberries.  So good!

Followed the recipe and used homemade chocolate chips. My son wanted to eat the whole batch! These are perfect; I did add a couple minutes to the bake time because I used a stone baking dish.

These are good but not chewy like I thought.  I took some of the other tips and decreased the butter and added applesauce - maybe this made them more like a cookie bar instead of a granola bar- I also added a teaspoon of goji berry powder and chia seeds to up the nutrition. They were still yummy- just not the texture I was looking for

It could've used a little more butter, so I added a TBS more. IT was great.

SOOOO good! I followed recipe exactly how it said! I already had everything on hand! We are making again today but have lined up different options for the kids to each make their own batch. My daughter wants chocolate candies and raisins. My son wants lots of raisins, craisins (cranberry raisins) and nuts! fun and easy and oh so yummy!!

These were pretty good.  I did think initially the mix was too dry so I added 1/3 c. peanut butter and they were perfect.  I smashed them down prior to cooking & then twice while they were cooling.  Lightly press into the pan is an understatment.  I also only used 3/4c. of mini chocolate chips because the recommendation was too much.  Other than the minor adjustments they were great!  I will make these over & over! Next is craisins & cashews then coconut & mini choc. chips!

My family loved these. I loved them because I know what is in them and can control how much sugar is in them.

These were good but WAY too crumbly. I might try this a couple more times with more sticky ingredients. Maybe peanut butter and more honey will solve it's problems? There is hope.

Delicious but the recipe needs to be rewritten. They are way too crumbly. Next time I'll try more honey and butter.

i made this recipe with my 3 year old, and it was really fun and stress-free as it's pretty easy and foolproof. i replaced the a/p flour with whole wheat, and replaced the butter with olive oil. the mix seemed a little dry so i also added some maple syrup, too. i baked it on a large sheet pan to make thinner bars (it made two dozen). they aren't chewy, but i don't mind. they are kind of like nature valley bars, but sooo much better. delish!

I love eating the Quaker Chocolate Chip granola bars, so I decided to try to make one of the homemade ones, and this recipe was it. I followed the exact recipe, EXCEPT for the rolled oats one. I changed the number of rolled oats from 4 1/2 cups to 2 cups and a half. Always put little then stir the batter, then add more until you have enough. Why? Because if you add too much and stir you won't be able to get the oats out and it when you start to bake your granola will crumble! But overall, it was a very good recipe!

Awesome recipe! They turned out delicious, chewy and flavorful! I upped the honey a bit because like others have said it was a bit too dry. I split the "dough" (for lack of a better word) added regular sized choc. chips to one pan, and peanut butter chips to the other. Both are great. I'm going to try cinnamon raisin next time. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is very tasty. I used choc. chips, raisins, a bit of shredded coconut and some roasted almonds. My hubby & I love it.   Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because I just couldn't get it to stay in bar shape.  it stuck together, but wasn't really firm enough to keep it's shape. It still tastes fabulous so I'll definitely make again.  I did melt the butter per another posters recomendation...mabye next time I try it I will just soften it instead, it might help it firm up a bit more.

Really not impressed with these at all. Nobody ate them, if you decide to make them, definately add more sugar or lots of chocolate, they were very bland.

I'm allergic to nuts and coconut oil, so I can't really buy granola bars from the store.  These are a great replacement!  I didn't have any problems with them crumbling or anything, and they have a really good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty yummy, but I think I didn't cook this long enough as it's all crumbles and not really bars. I think this is a good base recipe, so I'll be trying it again with more flavorful ingredients and a longer bake time.

I really like this.  I took the advice of another reviewer and packed the bars into the pan before baking, and then again halfway through the baking time. I used a combination of chocolate chips, dried fruits and nuts instead of all chocolate chips, but that was all I changed.   Awesome!  Thanks for posting.

I like the fact that they isn't a lot of added sugar in these, unlike other recipes I've tried.  I might experiment with using a substitute for some of the butter next time.  This is a great bar to vary the add-ins depending on your tastes!

Of course these are good! They are basically chocolate chip oatmeal cookie bars. Even my kids said so. I want to try a version that's maybe a bit healthier. I trie dusing half whole wheat flour, less brown sugar and a bit less light butter.

These taste incredible; I'll never eat the store bought ones again.  Also, the aroma is out of this world.  My house smells like a mixture of roasted nuts and cookies.  I increased the butter from 2/3 cup to 1 cup and also added a pinch of salt, and my granola bars kept their bar shape and didn't crumble.  Instead of all chocolate, I did 1 cup mini-chocolate chips, 3/4 cup dried cherries, and 1/4 cup sliced almonds.  These are fabulous.

Excellent base recipe - lots of room for variation! If you're having trouble with it being too crumbly, make sure you are using regular rolled oats and not quick oats.  I had to sub quick oats for a second batch because I ran out of the regular kind, and they did not hold together nearly as well.

These are great.  I've added a dash of cinnamon, raisins, diced prunes, crystallized ginger and/or a few tablespoons peanut butter.  We really like the raisin, chocolate chip, peanut butter combination.

We love these! I'm a Vermonter so I was tempted to replace the honey with maple syrup. Don't do it. The bars wind up dry and crumbly -- the honey is perfect in this recipe. I do sometimes replace the veg oil with coconut oil -- it adds a great mild coconut flavor that everyone loves! We add diced dried apples, cranberries. cashews, or whatever we have on hand. As long as you stay relatively close to the amounts called for in the original recipe you can't go wrong.

These were great.  I made them and put them in the freezer and my husband has been eating them on his weight loss competition.  I cut the fat -by only putting 1/2c butter, and added squash for extra moisture-since I had some in my frig.  I think I will try leftover sweet potatoes next.

Everyone in my family liked these bars except for my 2 year old, who would not touch them.  They taste more like a heavy, thick oatmeal cookie than a granola bar, though.

I was disappointed after reading all of the great reviews. It was more like a very thick cake/brownie like bar. I don't know if it was the softened instead of melted butter or too much flour. I don't know if I'll make again...no one in my house enjoyed it.

My kids absolutely love these granola bars! I use it as a base for a variety of flavor combinations.  I do suggest you use a good quality oat for this. In a pinch I used some 'instant oats' and while they tasted fine, the finer oat 'particles' all but disappeared in the final product.

These were pretty good. I made some alterations though, like others to make them a bit healthier. I used 1/3 cup of applesauce, and 1/3 cup butter. Added a 1/3 cup of PB, subbed whole wheat flour for all-purpose, completely left out the sugar, and used only 1 cup of regular chocolate chips. They taste amazing, but like other reviewers have posted they are a bit crumbly. I'll definitely make them again though and maybe add some more honey or applesauce.

I made this recipe to the letter and it turned out very dry. I gave it three stars because my oldest son didn't mind them (but he has a pretty hearty appetite these days).

Loved them!  Even my husband liked them and that's a feat.  I increased the butter and honey as others had recommended as well as added some rice krispies in place of some of the oats.  They turned out great.  I made one batch with dried cherries and almonds - yummy!

They were delicious, even my picky 8 year old ate them as well as my picky husband.  I will NEVER buy store bought granola bars again, these couldn't be any easier to make.  Mine came out beautifully, i packed them in tightly before baking...i also packed them midway through with a baggie on my hand but theis smeared the chocolate all over the top which wasn't necessarily a bad thing but i thin they would've looked prettier with the chips in tact.  i am going to try dried apricots, wheat germ and sunflower seeds next.  i love that this recipe uses real butter and no oil, that's the exact reason i tried it and you can really taste it...yummo!

Yummy!  Great snacks to go or just a quick breakfast with healthy alternatives.  I added flax seed for an extra boost, whole wheat flour and a bit extra butter as well.  Do plan on pressing them firmly in the pan, they hold together better that way.

These were absolutely fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly, only leaving out about a 1/2 C of oats and they're a tad soft so I probably could have left them in. I also made sure to press them firmly into the pan and took them out half way through baking to do so again, and pressed them yet again right after I took them out of the oven. The kids love them, I plan on wrapping them individually for the kids' lunches.

I added more butter and honey per other reviewers and I think I should have stuck with the origninal recipe first. Mine were a little too soft, but still taste great. I did substitute one cup of rice crispies for one cup of oats and only used a cup of mini chocolate chips, which were plenty, almost too much - may cut back on those next time. I pressed them very firmly in the pan before baking and then again when they were done. Mine stayed in bar form pretty well. Thanks for the great recipe!

these taste great. I added a little more hone and butter because it was too dry.I also cut down on the oats and replaced some with puffed rice. It was still pretty heavy so I think I will cut it to 1/2 & 1/2 next time. And, I had to put them in the freezer to 'harden' them up since I couldnt get them out of the pan. Then I wrapped them individually in saran wrap. YUM

Granola bars can come out dry and mine did. I recommend putting more honey in to act as a binder, but other then that this was Delicious (and sinful)!

My 8yr old son was just diagnosed with a sugar allergy. I made this recipe but without the chocolate chips. I then divided the mixture in half and put raisins in one half, and coconut with dried apricot pieces in the other, then baked each half in a 9x9 pan. the kids LOVED them. Thanks for saving my sanity in our new sugarless diet!

Fabulous! I did what others suggested and omited the brown sugar, and I am so glad I did, it would have made it way too sweet. I also used wheat flour and unsalted butter.  I agree the chocolate chips are not needed, because the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, nuts, cranberries, raisins and other goodies were enough.  I took these to my office and the woman loved it, I had to copy the recipe for them all.  Thank you so much, this is a keeper, I can't wait to make it for my grand-daughter.

This has become a staple in our house.  We'll never go back to the store bought ones.  We made it as it is written adding various combinations of chips, nuts, etc.  Make sure your butter is soft, you pat the mixture down in the pan and follow the cooling instructions - cool 10 minutes before cutting then cool completely before removing from the pan.  That helps keep them from falling apart.  In our house they never get completely cool before they start disappearing though.

Used 1/2 cup butter plus 1/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup of honey, and omitted the brown sugar.  Perfect texture, and delicious.  Next time I will add 1/2 tsp. salt.  I'll never buy granola bars again!  Wonder how they freeze?

I used 1 cup of salted butter, and could have probably reduced that.  Great with cherry craisins, yellow raisins, and sunflower seeds.  Will try with some applesauce next time.  Will make again and again.

My family loves these.  I used a little less oats, and added coconut in it's place.  I also cut back on the amount of butter and increased the honey a little to make up the differene.  I packed it into the pan as firmly as possible then immediately after removing from oven I took a spatcula and pack it down again-it did puff up a little while it baked, but after smashing it back down to look like a granola bar, it was perfect!  They cut into bars easy and kept there shape.  My hubby requests that I add peanut butter to it next time.  Yum, I will try that and update my review!

Great starter recipe for me, as I needed a base. I changed it a bit too 3 1/2 c. of oat, and added a mix of whole grains. I also didn't add the brown sugar, and lessened the butter with banana. I used walnuts and raisins. Sweet enough for all including the kids.

These were okay. I pressed them down half-way through cooking time, and then after they were finished, but they still turned out crumbly. I think they would have turned out better if I used more honey.

Of course with a few alterations this is the best ever most moist and chewy granola bars i have ever had. These are way better then store bought and cheap and easy to make.

This recipe is great, I make these all the time and individually wrap them and store them in the freezer, then just pull them out for lunches as needed, by the time the lunch hour hits they are thawed and ready to eat.

I started making these during my sons swim season because he was eating so many of the store bought ones and I thought these would be less expensive and more filling.  BOY WAS I RIGHT!!!  I now make them for him and the swim team and for meets and lots and lots of moms are asking for the recipe.  So thanks this is a GREAT snack for hungry swimmers and during swim season they are always hungry.  They have given them a name: YUM-YUMS!

Very good - better than the boxed kind because these actually fill you up!!  Halved the butter and used natural peanut butter.  Used less flour and added 1/4 cup wheat germ.  Half white and half wheat flour.

My variation for this wonnderful and easy recipe was to substitute 1 C of puffed rice for the rolled oats( added a bit of crunch). Used wheat flour instead of all purpose flour,used 2/3 C honey and skipped the brown sugar and replaced the choc chips with raisins,slivered almonds and 2 tbsp of peanut butterand flax seeds each. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers by pressing the mixture down mid way through baking and after it was done so was able to get nice and firm bars. These are highly addictive!Thank you for sharing a wonderful healthy and easy to make recipe!

I made the recipe as is, and alas, it was crumbly (although very, very good!)  Next time, I will use some of the suggestions from the reviewers (add applesauce or peanut butter, increase the honey, pack it down, etc.)  Nevertheless, my picky, picky eater kids still ate the crumbly result over vanilla fat free yogurt without complaint as a snack and asked for seconds.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Very nice! I like that these work out to be about .15c per bar! So much better to make your own, no artificial ingredients or preservatives.

Very tasty! I did leave out the sugar and increased the honey. The only thing I had on hand were butterscotch morsels but it turned out good. I noticed today they make sugar-free honey & semi-sweet morsels. I wonder how that would taste since my husband is a diabetic? We shall see!

This recipe was difficult to use, even after reading reviews: texture like a cookie and crumbly. Next time I will increase maple syrup and honey, skip sugar, add whatever I want, isn't that where the fun is in making granola? You guys have great tips! Thanks

I read the reviews about them coming out to crumbly, and the mix looked really, really dry.. so I added some rice bran oil-- they were delicious, but still kind of falling apart (though not too bad)-- next time I would add the rice bran oil (for moistness) and I would double the honey (and skip the sugar) to try and have them stick together better.  I also added chopped dates.

Pretty good, It was a little to dry for me so I dropped a few things and added a few things to make it work for my taste.

These were pretty good, a little more like a dessert bar than granola bars.  I added craisins and white morsels.  Next time I will add pecans.

I love this recipe!Made a few changes:Had to use instant oats,and used puffed rice as per suggestion from other raters,omitted sugar,added a pinch salt, increased the honey and (melted)butter and even drizzled a little of both ontop just before placing in the oven and was feeling happy, so I sprinkled a little more rice too. No nuts or choc-chips were used, but I did add about 1/2C raisins, also I used wheat flour instead of white and  2tsp maple syrup. Came out very good and just the right sweetness. I tested as a cold cereal also...Yum, This was a gr8 substitute for mom's recipe who is not avail. to give me hers, will make this often

These turned out really good. I was afraid they would turn crumbly but they held together really good.  I used karo syrup instead of honey, added cinnamon, and used peanut and choc. chip mixture.  I let them cool completely before cutting or removing them from the pan.

This recipe was excellent.  They smeeled so good that I couldn't wait for them to cool! After reading a few reviews, I increased the butter and honey to a full cup and added a 1/4 cup of crispy cereal and they held together well.  In place of the semi sweet chocolate chips, I added no sugar added chocolate chips and they were a perfect sweetness.

made this and it was gone in 24 hours. When I looked at the cost comparison vs. quantity - it was acutally much cheaper to fix my kids the healthier/homemade bars.

These granola bars were DELICIOUS! I did add a bit more honey than the recipe called for to make it chewier, but I didn't add any more butter than 2/3 a cup and it came out fine. And I didn't even use chocolate chips. This recipe is definatly a keeper! Thanks so much!
EDIT: I tried these bars with gluten free Coconut Flour and they were delicious!

Made these exactly as directed for my daughter's 3rd grade class.  She tells me the kids pretty much liked them.  We had the leftovers at home and they were pretty crumbly, as others have said.  They were not particularly tasty (seemed just mildly sweet to me), but I think I was surprised at the bland taste in the face of the "not so great" nutritional profile, in my view.  If they had a healthier nutritional profile, I might have been happier with the taste.  But the nutritional profile makes them seem like a bit of an indulgence, and they don't taste like an indulgence, but a healthy snack!

These were really good, I will never buy store bought bars again!  I took the advice of another person and added about 1/2 a bag of mini marshmellows and melted it with the butter.  I did have to add a little more than 2/3C.  I thought that 1C. of chocolate chips was too sweet so next time I will try 1/2C. and 1 1/2C. of raisins.  After I let them cool I cut them and stored them in the fridge.  They stayed together perfectly.

Would have been great if I had gotten the final product to stay together. Unfortunately, they just crumbled! I was rather disappointed. But, the taste was really good. They had great flavor, just not a good consistency. I even went as far as throwing them in the fridge for 2 hours, thinking that might help them stay together, at least long enough to cut them up, but it didn't work.

The 1st time I made these, they weren't too good, they fell apart. I made these today, and used a different honey - I used a set, white honey that was more expensive. I think that was the key. The nuts i used were ground down almost to a paste, and i omitted the chocolate chips. I also used raisens. This was a little crumbly, but no where near as much as the 1st time i made it. They are good.

Excellent texture and is definitely chewy, but as others stated a little bland. Not sure how to fix it, maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to counteract the sweetness and give it more interest. We added some chocolate cocoa powder and the kids loved it! Very good recipe, with the changes. I will most certainly make it again.

These were fantastic! I substituted dark corn syrup for the honey, and they worked out great! I cut them in strips, wrapped them, stuck them in a zip-lock and threw them in the freezer. Kids love em as do the big kids. Oh, I also added craisins and chopped up choc easter bunny. Perfect.

These didn't work out for me.  I used mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. They were too crumbly and fell apart.  I probably should have used more butter and packed them more firmly, as stated by others.  The taste was okay, so I ended up using the crumbs over ice cream.

These are so good.  I have tried other recipes for granola bars, but this one is a keeper!  I did as another had suggested and added applesauce, approximately 1/2 cup.  I did put the whole bag of Chocolate chips in and I added cherry flavored Craisens.  WOW!  These are awesome. (oh, I also didn't have any honey, so I used a little maple syrup)But, these sure are good.  More of a dessert than a healthy snack (at least the way that I did it)

I used 2 1/2 cups oats and 2 cups of rice crispies instead of the 4 cups of oats, and an 8 oz jar of honey instead of 1/2 cup. I would advise cutting the chocolate chips at least in half. I used about 1 1/2 cups and it was too chocolately. They were a little crumbly, so I put them in the fridge and they were excellent.

These granola bars are excellent. The first time I made them they were a little dry, so I added 1/3 cup applesauce, and they held together well. Sometimes I substitute dried cranberries or coconut for the chocolate chips for a healthier variation.

Perfect.  We have this on a regular basis, but be sure to use enough honey. I did less one day because we ran out and i thought it would be fine...nope, crumbly and dry but yummy granola.  Oh yeah almost forgot, I added 1/2 c. coconut, about 1c, nuts and brought the choc. chips down to 1/2 c. healthier and very yumy.

These tasted good, but they were not chewy at all.  I should have read other reviews before I made them.  I followed directions exactly.  They were crumbly but still tasted good.  My son loved them.  I will probably take some suggestions from others when I make these again.

Great recipe that allows my kids and I to custom-make granola bars to our taste.  We used chopped golden raisins, rice Krispies, sunflower seeds, walnuts, and mini chocolate chips.  Delicious!  I didn't want them to be crumbly, so I pressed the mixture firmly into the pan before baking.

My husband was almost afraid to try these because he hates the tasteless bars he's bought from the store. His reaction? "Wow! This is actually really good!" This is on our camping prep list as a basic kitchen item now.

I wish I had read other reviews before trying . . . I usually do.  I will make again using more butter (used only smart beat and butter flavoring this time) and honey to hold everything together as they were VERY crumbly.  The cominations are endless, which is the best part of this recipe.  I am partial to adding nutmeg and chopped dates.  Thanks for the recipe, I look forward to trying again.

Pretty good.  I added 3/4c butter, 3/4c honey, 3/4c flour then my raisins and chocolate chips.  Also I cut baking time to 15min.  Turned out chewy...still fall apart relatively easy but good none the less.

Very good. Yes, they were crumbly but I found that baking them a little longer helps them keep shape. 
I have used cranberries/pecand and apricot/walnut. 
I always add cocnut as well.

Very easy to make and very yummy!!  My one year old daughter loved it as a snack in the car-beats Cheerios!  Stays together nicely.  And you can add any dried fruit or nuts to spice it up.

These turned out great! I did use 1 c. butter and used about 1/4 cup extra honey. I used chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, they turned out delicious!! :)

I think JennBatt is right on when she says that this recipe has lots of potential, given that you can add just about anything you want to it. I liked the chewy texture of the bars, but I thought they were a bit too sweet. I used 1 3/4 cups chocolate chips. Next time, I think I will use just 1 cup chocolate chips and then add in 1 cup of peanuts too.

I used 1 cup of honey and 1.5 sticks of butter and stored them individually wrapped in the freezer, as suggested.  They were really good.  Actually, too good.  They are sort of wreaking havoc on my diet...but I'll make them again after a while.

these were great- they tasted alot like the granola bars you buy at the store under the name brand 'nature valley'. these aren't hubbies idea of a good granola bar- too dry for him-hence the 4*,but he liked them in the morning with his coffee- 
after reading the suggestions i decided instead of using more butter i'd use low fat peanut butter and a little more honey,i packed them in the pan really tight and they turned out wonderful. i also sprinkled peanut butter chips over the top. i will definately continue to make these trying different chips and such. thanks for sharing the great recipe!!!!!

These were very easy to make, and we liked the taste alot, but they were very crumbly.  We tried adding a little more butter per other suggestions, but that didn't seem to help.

These were good, but not very wet. Every time I've made them they haven't turned out right. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but they're always too dry and crumbly. Thanks though!

A very good recipe which allows creativity and variety.  I used more honey than indicated because I found that the granola didn't stick together if i didn't use enough honey.  I made 3 batches them with mini white chocolate chips, sunflower seeds, sweetened coconut flakes and dried fruits.  They were delicious, my friends loved them!

These were very good. I followed the previous reviewers advice and decreased the butter to 6 TB and increased the honey to 3/4. My first batch were a little dry so I added even more honey to the next batch. (Although my first batch may have been dry from overcooking.) I have the best pan for these. It's a pan with eight mini loaf pans in it. I pressed some granola into each loaf and it made the bars look storebought. I cooked my first batch with chocolate chips and the second with coconut and mixed nuts. Yum!

Like others I did add more honey to this recipe, but OH MY are they great!  My kids love them too, and they are so much better for them than the store bought ones.  They are very easy to make.  I put them in a jelly roll pan and get 24 bars out of the reciepe.

Made with 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup toffee bits.  They turned out very tasty - it probably would have been too much to add a whole 2 cups of chips.  I'm excited to send these to school with my children tomorrow!

Very good and easy to make.  My kids love them, and so does 'mommy'.  I made them just as the recipe says.  I pressed the batter down with my hand, putting a baggie on my hand first.  I made sure it was pressed down firmly.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are wonderful!  I added a cup of honey and did everything else like the recepie and they were moist and chewy and even better frosen.  I can't wait to make them again.  After baking them I cut them and wrapped them individually in saran wrap and gave some away and froze some and kept some out just to munch on but I loved them frozen. My daughter loved them.

These were great!  I made exactly as recipe stated.  My husband really liked them.  I think next time I'll adding more honey though (like others suggested) to make them just a little more chewy.  The possiblities are endless as what combinations you can make with these!

These are fabulous! I added 1 cup of honey and 1 cup of butter. They needed to cook for 30 minutes with these changes. They came out perfect and are not one bit crumbly. I added peanut butter chips and honey roasted soy nuts. I will try all sorts of things because I will be making these often! Thank you for your recipe!

There was nothing chewy or bar-like about this recipe. I even added a little more butter and honey to make it stick together the little that it did. So I ended up with loose and soft oats, basically. But it DOES taste really good. We're using it as a topping for yogurt.

My kids absolutely loved these much more than store bought!!  I read the reviews and added 1 cup of honey and they were perfect.  We've made them twice and each time, they were foolproof!  I've added shelled sunflower seeds, mini-chocolate chips, peanuts, walnuts and pecans and they were great!!  I just let the kids add the ingredients and mix it together.  I won't buy store bought again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

So glad I found this recipe!! Super good and I’ll be making these again and again.  I changed recipe by adding 1 cup butter, 1 cup honey, 1/3 cup flax meal, 1 cup chocolate chips, and some walnuts, cranberries, pumpkin seeds, salt.

Good, but not great.  A little too sweet, and the bars didn't stay together well.  Will tweak the recipe and try again.

We tweaked the recipe and we added 1 cup butter and 2 eggs.  We also cut the chocolate chips down to 1.5 cups.  It tastes like a cookie. It was the best granola bar ever!!! I recommend to this recipe everyone.

I have made these many times, each time different.  For gluten-free, substitute rice flour for wheat, and go forth and eat'em.  I add cranberries, coconut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, white chocolate chips, etc.   Sometimes I use maple syrup and flavoring in place of honey and vanilla.  
 We love these because they are chewy, tasty, healthy and travel well.

Super easy to make with amazing results. I toasted almonds, crushed them then combined coconut, sunflower seed and pumpkin seeds. Dried cranberries were an excellent addition and to top it off we added 3 tsp vanilla. Making it again for sure!

These are great. We just made them a second time. The whole family loves them. Changes: 4 cups oatmeal and 1/2 cup Rice Krispies. 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup coconut.  We pressed them down with a potato masher 1/2 way through baking and right when they are done. They stay together well and are so much better than anything you can buy.

I had a ton of instant oatmeal packets, so I made several batches adding protein powder and extra butter. My kids love these. Instant apple cinnamon was their favorite, I added vanilla protein. I also used chocolate protein with chocolate chips. I made them for out 6 hour road trip so the kids could have something the snack on that wouldn’t have to be refrigerated.

My first batch came out tasting more like raw flour than oats,   And I am guessing that’s because the cook time is so short. Upon making my second batch, I decided to dry cook the flour until golden brown. After baking the second batch , there was no more raw flour  taste, just delicious oat granola bar taste.

Not chewy at all  - just a mess of crumbles. These did not hold together as bars, and were not chewy. Dry crumbles only. Not even cookie-like, let alone chewy bar-like.I've never been so disappointed in a recipe (and I cook a lot). I was trying to save money because we are without income, so I used up what I had instead of buying store bought. We had all ingredients for these, so I tried them, but so sorry I did, as we now have to find some way to eat this crumbled mess because we can't afford to throw it out.

Great Granola Recipe, I will surely try in my home. Until now I am eating granola bars for weight gain. Rine Bars Granola Bar is one of the best Granola Bar. I like it much. Hope I can copy that and try Rine Bars Granola Bar in home. Let me know if anyone can suggest me about this.

Terrible! Absolutely awful. Nothing like a chewy granola bar. I made the recipe exact and had a bowl full of dry oats and dry flour. There was not enough liquid in this for it to mix at all. So I had to add a bit more honey. Still dry. Added more butter, still dry. Added peanut butter and that made it JUST wet enough to mix properly. The end result was just like another reviewer said, a bland cookie bar that was dry, crumbling and generally unappealing. I would NOT recommend trying this one out.

These are REALLY good!!!  I live in Guatemala and while we do get some granola bars here, they are very expensive.  So I tried these as part of a new low-salt diet.  I filled mine with sliced almonds, a small handful of chocolate chips, dried cherries, sunflower seeds and added to the recipe a little molasses.  The whole grains make them very satisfying,  the honey and molasses make the sweet enough for guests, and the fruits and nuts make them as healthy as possible.  I cut back on the butter, but can't imagine more would make them any better.  I took advice from many others and pressed these hard into my pan, and then half-way through the cooking process pressed them down again.  They are NOT dry nor crumbly.  Highly recommend them to one and all.  enjoy! ******Update******  I made these for a friend with wheat allergies, swapping out the wheat flour for rice flour.  I wasn't sure how it would work out, but no one could tell the difference.  Next time, I want to make them apple cinnamon, but I can't always find dried apples.  These really are great.

I tried this recipe just in time. We needed to evacuate due to Hurricane Irma.  We were four adults and two toddlers traveling in two cars.

I had just made these when it was determined we should get out of Irma's way.  I had cooled, cut and individually packaged each little bar and kept them in gallon size storage bags. Easy to keep a bag of these in each car.  My family and I loved these.  Even the little toddlers were crazy about them.  I added chopped walnuts which I lightly roasted and the chocolate chips.  We were away from home for 5 days and the bars stayed fresh the entire time.  I know that individually packaging them was a factor in their freshness so I would recommend wrapping them well to keep them chewy.  Very tasty recipe.  And so much better than snacking on salt and chemical laden chips while traveling.  I'm making another batch today.  Sharing with the family so the preschoolers can pack these in their school lunches.

This recipe is a great inspiration.  Change it to suit your tastes and make it your own.  I recently bought a box of store brand granola bars and they were horrible!  So I thought, "I wonder if I can make granola bars?"   I started looking for a recipe and found this one.   I did not make them exactly as written because so many reviewers had such great changes. 

Instead of AP flour, I made my own almond flour by toasting almond slivers and grinding them up in my Ninja!  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 coconut oil (might try all coconut oil next time);  3 cups of oats and 1 cup of rice krispies.  I used a scant 1/3 cup each of honey and brown sugar and only 1 cup chocolate chips.  I thought they were sweet enough like this.  

I baked them for 20 minutes and then used a silicone cutting mat to press them down as they came out of the oven a bit puffy.  After they cooled completely, they were just the right consistency; firm, yet  still chewy, not crumbly, and absolutely delicious!   

I cut the 13 x 9 brick into 24 servings.  I will never buy granola bars again.  I love that I can pronounce every ingredient in these bars and I have total control as to what goes into them.

UPDATE:
I made these again and pressed them down with the silicone mat before baking and they came out great.

I followed the the recommendation fro the other reviewers and added more butter and honey but my bars still came out too crumbly... the taste is really good but the consistency was not. If any other suggestions to make these bars more like bars and less like granola pleases let me know.

The first time I make these chewy granola bars, they didn't turn out like I expected. The second time I made then I substituted 2 cups of oats for rice crispys, then  1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup raisins. They turned out delicious.

Very delicious recipe.great for school or work lunches. To make chewier, cook for less time and the longer you let them cool the easier it is to take them out of the pan.

This recipe was good, but I won't be making it again. My bars didn't bind together like they should, and came out like chunky granola. On the plus side, the dish disappeared within two days standing on the kitchen counter, which means everyone must've liked it. Tastes great, doesn't bind.

These are the first granola bars I've ever made, and I really enjoy them! They are really crumbly so it makes them a little awkward to eat, but they're tasty. They're super simple and don't have a ton of flavour, but overall they're great for first timers!

The first time that I made these, they turned out bland and sweet. Not chewy at all. The second time I tweeked the heck outta them and no surprise they turned out pretty good. I added a bunch of things like roasted sesame seeds, an egg, extra tsp of vanilla, tsp of cinnamon powder, 2 tbsp coco powder and 1/3 cup of peanut butter. I also only added 1/2 cup of butter since I added peanut butter. I omitted the chocolate chips only because I didnt have any handy. This is a good base recipe for non-chewy granola bars.

Made it as-is the first time with modifications:

1c of Craisins
1c of Semi Sweet Chips
1/2c of Honey
1 stick of butter

After reading other comments that recipe as-is was too crumbly, I drizzled another 1/2c of honey and baked another 3 minutes.

I then pulled out and it looked very dry still and added another stick of butter and brushed on to the granola bars and baked another 3 minutes.

I let it sit for 15 minutes and cut up. My wife described it as a great yogurt or ice cream topping and tasted like an eggless or flourless oatmeal cookie.

I put in the fridge a couple of hours to set and cut up and bagged individual bars.

I will be sure to double the honey and butter to make the batch stickier before it goes in the oven.

I modified the recipe so I can't give it 5 star.  I put two cups of rice crispy in lieu of some the oats.  And I reduce the brown sugar to 1/8 cup, plenty sweet with that.  I increase the honey to 3/4 cup to insure everything sticks together.  You can eliminate the brown sugar but I think it gives some flavor to the granola.  Instead of two cups of chocolate chip, I put two cups of random nuts and dried fruits.  My husband loves Kind bars so I try to replicate it by putting in similar nuts and fruits.  My kids loves them too.

Only  changes that I made where I added a teaspoon of cinnamon  and pressed it down with a spatula before I cooked it and after it was done. It stayed together just a few crumbs.

These are excellent!  A bit fragile.
I used 1 C.chocolate chips and 1 C. dried cranberries.
They will not last long.

It's a keeper.??                                                                                             2 & 1/2 c oats plus 1 c Rice Krispies & 1 c All Bran. Omit all but 3 TB butter, melted plus 1/3 c applesauce, unsweetened. Omit sugar, honey and raisins. Instead: 1/3 cup agave syrup plus 1/2 c chopped dates. 1/3 - 1/2  c shredded coconut, sweetened, adds chewiness and sweet. No more than 1/2 - 2/3 c dark choc or semi-sweet chips. 1/3 c chopped walnuts just gets lost in the mix, but they're high in omega threes...  Don't forget to press press press before, during and after baking - I drizzled 1/3 c maple syrup over the baked, cooled pan letting it sink in before cutting  to reduce the inevitable crumbling. With a banana and glass of liquid calcium these bars serve as an excellent on-the-go breakfast or nutritious midday/evening snack. Thank you! (Used Robin Hood Nutri-blend Tastes Like White flour vs whole wheat or all-purpose.)

I made these today and added raisins, flax seed and dark chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe and they turned out great! No crumbling at all, I made sure to put parchment paper on the bottom of a jellyroll pan and spray it with cooking spray.  We all love them even my husband liked them and he is picky . Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I will be making these a bunch!

Theses were a hit especially for breakfast.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, made some with chocolate chips and some with butterscotch chips.  I also made them with my brownie pan.

I needed something my sons could grab as they ran out the door that wasn't junk, so I put apples in it (finely diced with peel on) and put the mixture in muffin pans. The recipe makes about 18 muffins. My sons loved them, and now I know they're not skipping breakfast.

This recipe was fine, but wasn't great. The bars were a bit mushy, and all the ingredients just wouldn't come together until I added more honey.

I actually used less oats since I thought the large quanitity would make them dry, but they still came out dry and crumbly. Is there any way to thicken up the recipe so they stick together like a real granola bar? They were chewy and sweet, but it might as well be cereal.

I added  caramel instead of honey, because i did not have any. This recipe was  AMAZING!!! It was very easy and i could make it in quite little time.  It was a bit crumbly but the taste made up for it.

These turned out the best of all the granola bar recipes I've tried.  I substitute Corn Flakes for some of the oats (1 1/2 cups), and also add raisins/craisins/sunflower seeds/coconut and a little fewer chocolate chips.  I agree with another review that said to press the mixture hard into the pan before baking, and I also freeze them before cutting to make that easier.  These are a hit at home and with the kids' friends.

Not a bad recipe at all. Instead of all honey, I used 1/2 corn syrup. Also added 30 ml chia, 250ml of peanut pieces, 60ml sliced almonds, about 5 ml of cinnamon and 125 ml raisins.  I drizzled chocolate on top because why not? :-)

Thank  you for the great recipe! I want to be more self efficient and less buying store bought items. So the things I have  changed is 4 cups of oats,  1 cup of honey, 3/4 cup of butter, no salt,   1/3 pure maple syrup, 1/3 brown sugar.  The key is to make sure you MELT  the butter. Mix all wet ingredients and dry ingredients seperately. Then mix altogether then add just 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of mixed nuts and dried fruit. I used mixed nuts and dried cranberries and raisons.  If  you add more then that then the  ingredients wont stick together. Only bake for 18 mins or until the edge is golden brown. You must press mix FIRMLY  into the pan before and after baking and let it cool completly before taking out and cutting. Absoloutly will never buy granola bars again in a store this is SOOOO much better...Thank you again for the super recipe

The taste was super (i added cinnamon and a little salt), but they didn't hold together very well. I let them totally cool before cutting them, and a few pieces hold together, but overall I couldn't cut them into bars to send with my children to school like I wanted to.

I also modified this recipe to 1 cup honey and 1 cup butter to help the bars keep better shape. I found them a bit too crumbly otherwise. Overall, great recipe and one that I use regualrly. I left out the chocolate chips and added blueberries, cranberries and almonds instead.

Tried this today and it's a hit! I stuck to the recipe given, using choc chips, raisins, craisins and a little coconut. I followed the advice on melting the butter which made it easier to mix everything together. I lined the pan with wax paper and pressed the mix into the pan very firmly.

Excellent! Made according to recipe, only change was margarine instead of butter. I used a combo of white/butterscotch/dark chocolate chips. Traded 1/2 of oats for rice krispies for texture.

It was way too crumbly and did not hold together.  Tasted good, but needs more honey or less oats.  I should've have read the other reviews before I jumped head first. My bad!  I'll try again with a different ratio

Delish! And so easy to make! I melted the butter for 2 reasons...1)I read another reviewer did the same and 2) I didn't want to wait for my refrigerated butter to soften :/.

I'm still waiting for them to cool completely but couldn't resist trying a piece now...yum yum yum. You can really taste the honey. Hubby loves them so 5 stars from us!

Yum! These granola bars are so much better than the Quaker Oats granola bars plus a lot healthier. They are soft and chewy, though they aren't the same consistency as the store bought kind.  That's okay though because these are so much better.  I had my son, niece, and husband all give them a big thumbs up.  I made mine with some chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and walnuts that I had leftover from some other baking I had done earlier.  I will be making these again!

I love this recipe! Like others I adjusted some of the ingredients. I added a bit more butter and honey, a little less flour. I substituted about half the old fashioed oats for quick oats and added some ground flax seed(we like the nutty flavor). For add ins I chopped some almonds, added some cherry flavored craisins and coconut with about half of the chips. I added some almond extract with the vanilla. The flavors together are amazing!

These granola bars, while tasty, did not hold together at all. I mixed up the add-ins a bit...I just couldn't imagine these with a full two cups of chocolate chips! Basically good, but definitely needs quite a bit of doctoring!

This recipe was good- just like a bought muesli bar. I had to add two eggs to bind it all together and next time I will use less butter and add more seeds and healthy things. I love the quantity in whcih it yields- great for the freezer!

These are fabulous!  The assorted mixture I used was: semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, sweetened coconut, sunflower seed and sliced almonds.   I only made half the recipe and used an 8x8 pan and it made 8 fairly large bars.  They taste so much better than store bought granola bars.

These are really good!  I subbed real maple syrup for the brown sugar and added sunflower nuts.  Then after cooling I loosened the edges and flipped the entire granola piece out, added a layer of melted dark chocolate on the bottom, placed in the refrigerator to cool completely.  The layer of chocolate helps keep the bars from crumbling.

Maybe I did something wrong but we didn't care for these at all.  They were too dry & the texture was crumbly at first then hard when they cooled.

Absolutely delicious as is!!! I did find they taste 100x better the next day. I will try some modifications next time just to make them healthier and lighter, but try the recipe as is first. They're delightful.

DID NOT LIKE THIS RECIPE!!!
They hardly stick together - totally fell apart when cutting them.  I added more nuts than chips - perhaps that's why, but I wanted to make them healthier and less sugary - way too crumbly.
The recipe need something to bind it together.
I won't make it again.
sorry!

Made  them yesterday, GREAT STUFF, but how long will it store in sandwich bags? I would like to take it to work instead of my nature valley bars. I rate the bars at 9 on a 10 scale.

The recipe is missing the necessary step of putting the bars in the refrigerator after baking--this step solves all the crumbling and taste problems.

I made this recipe using several suggestions from other reviewers. I added chopped dried apricots, honey, coconut and toasted pecans. So mine were a bit sweet without being over the top. Pretty good! My granola bars are a bit crumbly, so I think if I make these again adding more honey and melted butter might help, or just reducing some of the dry ingrediants. It was nothing too horrible, but I can see that this is the type of thing that might need to be made several times in order to really learn the proper ratio.
All in all, great recipe! And what a great breakfast treat to mix things up a little bit!

These tasted great (I used a two-cup combination of mini chocolate chips, chopped almonds, and coconut), but they were too dry and crumbly. I wish I had read the reviews saying to increase the butter and honey. I will use more next time and hope they stay together.

I thought it was very easy to make. I only made half the recipe and added slivered almonds instead of chocolate chips. Not to sweet I think I will add butterscotch chips next time. I like that it is versatile with what you can put into it.

I made these this morning but instead of adding the 2 cups of chocolate chips, I put one cup choc. chips in, 1/2 cup shredded coconut, and 1/2 cup almonds in.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of flax seed.  They were good but a little crumbly.  Gonna see if there is something I need to change...they taste awesome though.

I followed the recipe closely, but I subbed quick oats and light corn syrup because that is what I had on hand and also a small bag of sliced almonds. I also used 1 c. of the corn syrup instead of 1/2 per what another reviewer suggested. Pressed down hard in a jelly roll pan. Baked at 325 for 18 min and then another 3 min. to get them to golden brown. Delicious!

These granola bars are amazing! I followed the basics but also added in some dried cranberries and coconut. To say the least, they were delicious! The bars are chewy and easy to make. They are a great snack and I loved how I could experiment with different ingredients!

This is my first attempt at making granola bars. I did not have any butter so I left it out. I used 2/3 c creamy natural peanut butter instead. I also used about 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce. Used only 1 cup of chocolate chips. This would be better with mini chocolate chips! Oh, and I could not get this to mix with a utensil. I had to use my hands! LOL Thanks for the recipe. =)

My kids and I made this tonight. My kids devoured it and my husband, who claims to not be a granola fan went back to scrape the crumbs from the pan. We used chopped pecans and raisins instead of chocolate chips and we added two heaping teaspoons of chocolate powder. We also added a squeeze more honey than called for. Yummy!!!

The only thing I did different was using the tiny candy coated chocolate chips simply because it is what I had on hand.  The last granola bar recipe I tried was time consuming and hard to stir due to the marshmallows this recipe is much healthier and easier.

These are really wonderful. I have made them several times. I have found that baking a half recipe and adding 1/4 cup applesauce.  These are a lot more like a breakfast cookie than a granola bar but regardless they are delicious and my kids love them.  I tried using wheat flour but they were a bit crumbly.

These were easy and delicious!  I didn't change a thing except I added a bit more honey just to help it mix up a bit easier.  I also added only 1 cup of chocolate chips.  The family went crazy for them and they're really not into granola bars.  Great recipe!

These were a bitt sweet for our taste, but an easy recipe to tweek.  Next time we'll add 1/2 c. peanut butter and not use brown sugar. I was surprised at how easy  this was. My 5 year old was able to easily help.

I left out the brown sugar and used vegetable oil in place of butter.  They were sweet enough with just the honey and oil is cheaper than butter.  They got the seal of approval from the kids so we are done with store bought granola bars!  Thanks for the recipe.

I can't rate this recipe as is since I really changed things up, but I WILL tell you what I did differently. I only used 4 cups of oats, used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, omitted the brown sugar (the honey and chocolate chips make them sweet enough), reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup (also, I used regular sized chips as I didn't have minis). I also added one egg to the batter at another reviewers suggestion, and it worked wonders in holding these bars together. Also, press them down into the pan halfway through baking, this also keeps them from crumbling. I cut mine into bars while they were still warm and then immediately wrapped the pan with foil and placed in the fridge. I've kept them in the fridge since and they are still yummy! I agree with other reviewers- definitely more of a bar cookie, but still a great snack!  **Edit** Made this recipe again and omitted the chocolate chips in favor of 3 tablespoons cocoa powder. They came out great! Just enough chocolate and sweetness :)

Very good, but VERY sweet!  Much like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie or a dessert bar.  The second time I reduced the brown sugar to 3 Tbsp. and the honey to 1/3 cup, and they were still quite sweet.  I prefer to limit my sugar intake, so next time I will omit the brown sugar altogether.  I added chopped almonds, and it was delicious.  I pressed these HARD into the pan and baked for only 18 minutes.  I then froze them.  They were a bit crumbly, but overall stayed together pretty well.  (They were possibly more crumbly since I reduced the honey and sugar.)

I made this for my boys as they love the chewy, chocolate covered store bough granola bars that are way to expensive.  So they like the peanut butter kind so I made the recipe as it states (other than the fact that I ran out of honey and therefore had to use syrup in its place) and then spread peanut butter on top and added chocolate chips.  I put it back in the oven until the chocolate melted and then froze it.  I think next time I will listen to the others and use more honey, maybe butter would be better than maragarine too.  But it is such a good base recipe to start from.

These fell apart. I used more honey than called for and pressed them down multiple times. They were good but I had to eat them as granola, not as granola bars.

These were great.  I have Celiac and I was able to substitute with GF oats and GF all purpose flour.  I added a bunch more stuff, like dried fruit, flax and almonds.  Thanks for this recipe, its been a long time since I had granola bars!

Amazingly yummy!  I love that this recipe doesen't include tons of things that I never have around and don't like such as sesame seeds and dried fruit.  I replaced one cup of oats with flaxseed meal and wheat germ and added 1/2 cup peanut butter to help it stick together.  I will try repacking in the middle of cooking time to make these less crumbly next time.  I also decreased the chips to 1 cup.  2 cups is much too sweet.  My kids love these!

I tried this recipe exactly as stated and everyone in my family thought it was great! I plan to make it at least once a week and will add goodies like raisins or other dried fruits such as cranberries or blueberries. I'm so pleased it was so easy to find a decent granola bar recipe so quickly!!

These granola bars are delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and increased the butter and honey to 1 cup each. I also added a few butterscotch chips that I had laying around. It took me about twice as long to bake them than the recipe instructed and one other problem I had was getting them out of the pan when they were done. I waited for them to cool about 10 or 15 minutes as instructed, but they just fell apart. So, I let them cool completely before trying again. Unfortunately, that made it nearly impossible to get them out of the pan since they were essentially baked to it. All that to say: make sure you grease your pan REALLY well beforehand. I will definitely make this recipe again, but will make some adjustments to what I did this time. I suggest: using 3/4 cup each of the butter and honey, greasing the pan REALLY well, and only putting 1 cup of chocolate chips in (since 2 cups yield very sweet, cookie-like bars).

So yummy. My kids love them.

Crumbled and followed the recipe as is. Never had a recipe fail me before. The mix was a little dry and probably could have used more honey. I'll try this again with more honey and hopefully they turn out.   So disappointed to have to throw this all out!!! :(

Update: I made a second batch and added a full cup of margarine and a full cup of honey. Full thumbs up from all of the family including the hubby!

I made these this morning for my fiance for work. They turned out a little dry. I'm sure it's because I didn't add the brown sugar. Is there anything low calorie I can add that will moisten them a bit?

It's a bit too sweet that I didn't cut down the brown sugar. Used applesauce instead of butter. It's chewy! But too sweet.

awesome bars!  They were so easy to make and are very delicious.  Cut into perfect squares rather than "bars".  Maybe I will try a longer pan next time.  Also, will not add as many chocolate chips.  All in all I will continue to use this recipe!  Thanks!

We make these a couple times a year. They've never turned out "chewy". They're crunchier but not hard, if that makes any sense. I use mini chocolate chips-only half the amt called for.

These had great flavor and were very easy to make.  I made them for my daughter's kindergarten class and the container came back empty!  I cut down the amount of the chocolate chips and also put in a box of dried fruit pieces that I found at the dollar store.  They were a little bit more crumbly than I would have liked them, so I will have to experiment with more honey and packing them down tighter as suggested in other review.  I look forward to making them again and changing out the ingredients.

these were pretty good. i only made 1/2 the batch and did not use honey, as I am allergic to it. i used a honey substitute that i found online made of white sugar and water, but i also used a little more water to keep from getting dry and crumbly. i pressed the mixture onto the pan, then after baking, i pressed it once more and it came out really chewy and it kept its shape.

These are great! firmly pressing down does help keep them together. I froze half of them and they freeze well. Next time I'm going to take out the chocolate chips and replace them with apples and raisins!

I have been looking for a granola recipe since I saw Emeril featured on Jon & Kate plus 8.  I used tips from many of the reviews along w/the actual recipe and I think 1/2 cup of honey is entirely too much! It was overbearing so I toned it down by adding a mashed banana and thining the thickness of the mixture with splashes of orange juice until it was a nice consistency almost like cake batter. I had fun making this because I couldn't mess it up it only got better! Thanks

This Granola Bar recipe rocks! It tastes just like the Cascadian Farm Chocolate Chip Granola Bars! Except the fact that the ingrediants are very basic. It's stuff you can find in the pantry. I'm very glad somebody came up with a excellent idea like this. They taste better than ones in the store. It's the recipe I've been waiting for!

I Love them, my kids love them, my husband loves them!! I did press them down again half way through the bake time. Once finished baking turned my oven to warm, spread a bag of peanut butter chips on top, put back in the oven for 5 minutes and then smoothed out. Delish!!!!

This recipe is really good!  I make it exactly as the recipe says to and it is great.  Honostly though it reminds me more of a healthier version of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies than an actual granola bar, but they are definitely good!

Fantastic!  Everyone loves them!  I find 2 cups of chocolate chips a bit too much, so I just make it 2 cups of "additions", which my kids generally like ask to be marshmallows, chocolate chips, and unsweetened coconut.  I also add a bit more honey to make it stick a bit better.  I found waiting 20 minutes before cutting makes the marshmallows stick less to the knife.  Thanks a million for this recipe!  I make it about once every 2 weeks!

It's my own fault that I didn't print out the reviews for some help with this one.  I made these just using the recipe and they were way too crumbly.  I used the crumbs for a topping for a berry cobbler.  Next time I'll be sure to read all the reviews and I'm sure they'll turn out better.

Not as good as I'd hoped, these were crumbly even though I followed the advice of other reviewers suggesting to press the bars down before and during baking process. Maybe some added peanut butter might be helpful in keeping everything together.

I used rice krispies for some of the oatmeal.  Didn't need as much choco. chips.  Press them down before and after baking.  They didn't crumble and were very chewy.  Everyone liked!!

These were very good. Everyone loved them the first time I made them (they were nice and chewy). The second time I overbaked them so they were crunchy, but still good. I would have given it 5 stars if it were healthier. I think next time I will see about making my own, healthier version of this. Granola bars are still so good when they are healthy, why not do them better?

I have to give 5 stars for taste but these were so moist, we could not each them like a bar.  We scooped a bit into a bowl and served with ice cream, yogurt or sliced bananas.  I did not add the sugar and these were sweet enough.  I would really like to know how to get these to harden!

I thought this was very good, too good to be healthy, haha. It was more of a oatmeal bar cookie rather than a granola bar. I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter instead (since I only softened that much) and added about 2 and half tablespoons of applesauce to make it 2/3 of "butter." I also added about 1/4 cup of wheat germ and white chocolate drizzle on top. Next time, I will cut back on the sugar and add more peanut butter and dried fruits in place of the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

THis was great my kids loved it and i have one who is a very picky eater. I did follow some of the suggestions. I did not up the honey but added 1/3 cup of apple sauce. Melted the butter and i had to cook mine a little longer than 22 minutes to firm it up.   They came out great still chewy the next day. This is a keeper for our family.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly even added a jar of soy butter which should have helped it stay together but did not. Melted the butter, used my hands to combine it properly and pressed down in the pan.  Even when totally cooled they did nothing but crumble, I have a huge pile of crumbs not bars.

I used sprouted wheat flour for the white and pressed down hard when putting the bars in the pan.  They were great!  And are now a staple at our house!  Much healthier than store-bought and best of all, free of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup)!!!!!

Really Good.  I am giving it 5 stars because I did use whole wheat flour instead of regular.  I will use more butter or add some applesauce next time to make it more moist.

These are great!! This is my first time making granola bars since I'm not that great of a baker (I can't even make cookies!) But these came out fantastic and I did what everyone else said and added more honey. I added about 1/2 a cup more and mine were not sticky but they did not crumble. I added sunflower seeds, raisins and chocolate chips and it was fantastic. I would recommend these since you know what is going into them. Plus it's going to save you money in the long run.

UPDATED*** tried the other reviewers sugg. and made the mixture "wet" with more honey and butter and pressed, pressed, pressed. Now holds together, Yummy!!!!

I made these last night and they were wonderful.I took the advice of others and increased the honey,melted the butter and pressed them firmly in the pan.I baked mine on parchment paper to aid in cutting them into bars and they turned out great.No crumbles!This is a great foundation recipe as it easy to add/subtract ingredients to make them suit you!Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this three times, first exactly as written and I was happy with the texture and it did seem to be a granola bar not just a bar cookie however true to everyones review it was very crumbly and did not take shape at all and way too much chocolate if that is possible. The next time I added applesauce, increased the butter and honey it take shape was able to cut into bars but it lost the appeal of seeming like a true granola bar and was more like a bar cookie. The third time I omitted the brown sugar with the inc honey and butter and changed the oats to 3c and 1c of rice crispies and added wheat germ and again the consistency was of a bar cookie and not a granola bar. The taste was good just too sweet looking for a healthy snack for me and the kids I will keep looking.

This recipe needs to take the "chewy" part out of the title. It taste good but it's not chewy, it's very hard and more like tuff granola bar.  Great if you are looking for a hard type of granola bar.

These came out ok. I was not impressed, neither was my husband. I plan on trying a different recipe next time. Feels like it was missing some zing, can't quite put my finger on it.

These were okay, and the kids didn't like them.  My husband and I ended up eating the last of them crushed over yogurt, and that was pretty good.  Overall, not one of my fav's though.

very good, but this recipe needs an egg, or something else like a banana to hold it together better.  I added some walnuts, choco chips and rasins and followed the 2 cup max rule and it just does not want to stay in nice bars, which is not good for kids, too messy!
I am going to try this again but I will add an egg or two in hopes that it helps keep it all together for little fingers.

My family loves this recipe and we make it often.  I do have a problem with the bars crumbling, but do not know what I am doing wrong.  They are still good no matter what.  I would like to know how to keep them from crumbling.
thanks

I thought they were excellent and really tasted like a granola bar.  Mine were a bit crumbly but I thought that might be due to the chocolate chips; I used full-size chips instead of the mini chips.  I may try some of the recommendations of other reviewers but I'm definitely going to make this recipe again!

These were just okay. They are kinda "cakey" and my bars won't stay together. I baked for 25 minutes and they were slightly browned but maybe they needed longer in the oven. I was looking for a granola bar inbetween a nature valley and a quaker type. I won't make these again.

This recipe was ok.  The flavor was pretty good, but as other reviewers have stated, these do not hold together well and are very crumbly.  In my opinion, these are just a very high-calorie cookie.  I'll keep looking.  Sorry.

Yummy!  I love these!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, using a tad less butter, adding dried cranberries and blueberries and only a bit of chocolate chips.  I used clover honey and added some sesame seeds as well.  Turned out great!

Good recipe! Tastes better than a store-bought granola bar. However, I thought it needed a little salt though---oats are too bland and need a tad of salt added into the mix.

These came out pretty good but we wanted more like "Nature Valley" granola bars. These were more like blondie brownies maybe because I used dark corn syrup instead of honey. I'll try honey next time and see how they come out.Thanks

This was a pretty good recipe actually. It was my very first attempt at making granola bars. I think that this recipe could easily be tweaked to suit anyone's tastes. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also used carob chips in place of chocolate chips. The next time I make this I will cut the brown sugar and hoeny in half. While all 3 kids and my husband liked them they all said it was more like a dessert than a granola bar. One other thing... you MUST let it completely cool before you attempt to remove the bars from the pan. I let my cool over night and that was perfect! Today we are dipping them in the chocolate that you use for candy buckeyes. Maybe even throw a bit of coconut on top to dry into the hardened chocolate! YUM!

Having never made granola bars before I think they turned out quite nice. I made a smaller batch, using an 8x8 baking dish which made 16 nice sized squares. I melted the butter which I think helped make them come together well. I also put a 1/4 cup of wheat germ in and lessened the oats by that amount. I too think they are sweet, but that is probably because of the choc. chips. Next time I think I will add/substitute almonds and craisins. I found them only to be crumbly a tiny bit. Mostly when my 3 year old was gobbling it down. I have added it to my saved recipes. Thanks!

The texture was very good - very chewy, but stayed together, kind of like a soft oatmeal raisin cookie.  I used a mixture of chocolate chips, raisins and butterscotch chips and next time will probably use mostly raisins or other dried fruit and a  little bit of chocolate - these are very sweet even before chips are added.

This recipe is awesome! My one year old will even eat it. I agree with previous suggestions increase butter and honey and decrease the amount of chocolate. We took the chocolate chips down to 1 cup an added dried Cranberries approx 1 cup. The next time I will actually decrease the chocolate to about 1/2 to 3/4 and add more cranberry. Other wise this recipe is spectacular! Thanks for the recipe. We also have food allergies so this recipe is great becuase it eliminates all of our allergens and lets me customize it.

This recipe is very good and tastes all natural. The bars dont stay in shape as well as I wanted them to, but more honey is the key. I thought they tasted very good, especially with the peanutbutter I added!

I was nervous with all the comments about these not sticking together, but I had no problems at all. I did 2/3 cups honey, 7 Tbs. butter (melted), and 1 cup chocolate chips. I mixed the melted butter, vanilla, & honey then added to the other ingredients (I had already mixed the other ingredients together in a bowl). Press down firmly when putting in pan. I let them cool for about an hour then put them in the fridge for another hour. After that I cut them into bars and wrapped them in plastic wrap. I'm also storing them in the fridge. The reason I only gave the recipe a 4* is they are so sweet. I can't imagine using 2 cups of chocolate chips. Plus they aren't as chewy as I would have liked. I think I'll try adding marshmallows and peanut butter next time. It's still a wonderful recipe that I will use again.

I added a scant 1/2 cup applesauce to the mix.  I think this helped them to not be so crumbly.  Next time I'll add 1/2 tsp salt and maybe try decreasing the flour a bit to make it more like my idea of a granola bar.

Very good bars.  Followed advice here and made it with 2/3 cup of butter and the same amount of honey.  Great flexibility for substitutions; I try to use spelt flour instead of wheat.  Easy to make and dissappear fast!

These bars were so dry and fell apart.  I will not make them again. I will use them crumbled up in my yogurt.

These were very good with a few changes like many other people said-more honey and melt the butter. I added 2 cups Rice Krispies and also decreased the oats to 2 1/2 cups...I also added some dried berries and cherries, these were very good. This is a 5 star recipe with the changes, but it would be a four star without the changes. Thank you for the great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!  With the butter (I used 11 T), I made sure it was really soft, and ended up using my hands to mush and gush the batter to make sure that EVERYTHING was covered in the mixture.

This is a healthier way to get my chocolate fix - I'll never go hungry at work again!  Thank you!  (I think next time I'll add some coconute shreds too, mmm!)

Great flavor. I added dark chocolate and dried cherries. But too crumbly.  I couldn't cut into bars and even still they fell apart.

These are pretty good but the lack on flavor.  I think they need a little more butter also, but not much more.  There is also alot of sugar in these. I'll have to play with this recipe

In order to give this recipe a fair review, I followed the recipe as it was written (except I only added 1 cup of chocolate chips). They turned out very crumbly. I could not cut them at all. I thought that the taste is only OK. (although my 2 year old is screaming for more!) Overall, I was quite disappointed.

Pretty good.  I still prefer baking with a oaty energy bar mix from Matisse and Jacks - www.matisseandjacks.com - take a whole lot less time and may be even a little tastier.  Still these were good, but yeah.

I think the name is misleading.  They don't taste like store bought granola or granola bars.  They are more like a  semi-sweet oat bar.  That is why I rated them a 3.  I wasn't "wow-ed", but they weren't bad.  If you want a treat that is not too sweet, this one fits that description.

These were okay.  I took some of the suggestions and used WW flour, raisins ILO chips etc.  However, I found that these are way too sweet for my family.  I might make again but only with no sugar they are too much like a dessert with all the sugar.  I also will try using wheat germ for some of the oats.

I was afraid of them being dry, so I added applesauce.  I had to bake them much longer than recommended, but they were delicious!  I only added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.

I really liked this recipe.  It is very versatile in the fact that you can add whatever your preferences are.  I added 1/2c. of coconut, 1/2c. of rice krispies, and a 1/2c. of cinnamon flavored applesauce to my mixture.  I used the 2 cups of mini chocolate chips as in the recipe but next time I will use half as it was too chocolately for our family.  I used a large cookie sheet and lined the bottom with parchment paper.  Mine held together just fine.  I baked until they were golden in color.  I will be making these again.  Great recipe!!!  Did not think I could make my own granola bars and taste this good.  Thanks!!!

Tastes very good, I read most of the other reviews, so I changed it a bit, still was a bit crumbly with my combnation, and more cookie like, now we could have mistaken her from the "cookie" bar from a substance like the granola/chocolate bar (more candy like).

My recipe was:
2 CUPS of Oats (old fashion)
1 CUP of Flour
1 1/2 CUPS of Gramcracker powder/crumbs
4 TABLESPOONS of Vegtable Spread
1/8 CUP of Peanut Oil
2/3 CUP of Brown Sugar (Splenda)
1 TEASPOON of Cinnamin Powder
1/2 TEASPOON of Baking Powder
1 TEASPOON of Pure Vanilla
1/2 CUP of Honey
4 TEASPOONS of Maraschino Cherry Juice
Almonds ( didn't measure, maybe 1/4 cup???).

I pulled the bars out after 15 mins, a very different recipe from above, but very good, I will make them as one of my treats in the christmas baskets this year. Thank you.

Wonderful!  and so easy to make.  Finally a recipe I can make that is as good as the brands that we love.  Easy and versitile.  I have used the dried fruits, different nuts and even butterscotch chips.  My kids love all the variations.

Darn!  I should've read the reviews before trying.  This recipe as-is is waaay too dry.  I will try again and up the butter or add other moisture, though.  The taste was good, but more like a dessert.

I added coconut and some smooth peanut butter to the recipe. The peanut butter to make it stick together better--it seemed a little crumbly at first. Next time I will also use a little more butter and/or honey.

This recipe created bars that just fell apart.  They did not stick together and were not chewy.  The flavor was good, but that was due to the cranberries, almonds & white chocolate chips I added. Sadly, I'm going to try to save these bars by re-cooking them today using another recipe.

I guess I should have read the review and added butter and honey.  I liked it okay but my husband said it was too dry and made him thirsty.  I will try adding more butter and honey next time after I try other recipes.

Hmm, well I personally am not a fan of granola bars myself, but I made these for other eople in my family and the texture was a little iffy. They did not all get eaten. Then again, it may have been my own fault.

I could not get these to stick together, even after increasing the honey, adding peanut butter, and cutting back on some of the oats. My husband, normally a sucker for granola bars, wouldn't eat these at all.

Same problem as everyone else- turned out crumbly, I agree it's more like an oatmeal cookie dough bar, not a granola bar, maybe try again minus the flour. 7 year old didn't care for it at all.

This is a good starting point, but I had the same problem as others with the fact they were so crumbly. My son loved these and I wrapped them in tin foil and decorated with stickers so he would think they were just as special as the store bought ones he tears through. I didn't use any chocolate chips, just dried cranberries and slivered almonds. I think next time I will use the applesauce suggestion and see if that helps. Still a great starting point.

I tossed in a few crumbled walnuts, raisins, and a little coconut to the recipe. Also, i followed the suggestions by putting in the 1 cup butter, and reducing the chocolate... However, the bars were still very sweet and crumbly. The crumbling may have been due to the fact i had to use a pizza pan for baking. A smaller surface yields thicker bars- the bars may not have been toasted properly. They still taste great though. Thanks!

I originally made this recipe exactly the way the recipe asked and wasn't very impressed. Not enought flavor for me. I added craisins and peanuts the second time hoping to better it and I liked it better. My husband loved both times I made it. Make sure when you make this recipe you add lots of "Extras" for added flavor. I will make this again! Thanks Nancy for submitting this recipe.

My kids and I love this recipe.  It was fun for use to make together.  It did turn out rather crumbly for us to.  So I crumbled the bars up and toasted them for about 5 min. at 375 degrees. This made them crunchy and a perfect tv snack for the kids.  We also put the toasted crumbs into a bowl with a little milk and made a good granola cereal. We will deffenatly make this recipe again.

Very tasty, instead of chocolate I used almonds and cransins. A little crumbly despite using the suggestions listed, but they held together well enough to store. I will use this recipe again with other additions. Thanks for the submission.

I loved these bars.  They weren't that crumbly to me.  I used raisins and craisins in mine instead of chocolate chips.  I also drizled some vanilla icing on top to add a little more sweetness to them.  The recipe is so versatile, I can't wait to try it with other ingredients.

I tried this recipe as written, except I used 2 cups coconut instead of chocolate chips, as I didn't have any.  It is a very good base recipe.  However, I will add more honey next time. Maybe with chocolate chips they would've had the hint of sweetness I was looking for.  I will definately make these again and again.  My 4 year old was very pleased.

This is the most versatile granola recipe ever.  I have used all sorts of things in these bars, from chocolate chips to grape nuts.  I also tried using boxed cereal (Honey Bunches of Oats) for a unique twist on a cereal bar.  Fantastic for wee kids because they're easy to eat, and because I control what goes into them.  Will make again and again.

I was looking for a healthier alternative to "Nutrigrain" bars and did a comparison. While these were a hit with the kids (they taste great), I didn't find them 'chewy' at all - they were more like a bar cookie, not a granola bar.

Turned out very dry but taste great. I added more honey and less oats and they turned out fine after that. They are a big hit with the kids.

Yum! These are so good.  I also used a full cup of honey to make them nice and soft.  Instead of 2 cups of chips, I got a 2 cup measuring cup and did 1 cup of chips, and filled the rest with coconut and sliced almonds.  Next time I will do only a 1/2 cup chips and more coconut and almonds.  This is a great base recipe to tweek up with your favorite fillers!

I used a full cup of honey like others suggested, but I think I'll try even more next time so it's even more chewy and sweet. It turned out really good with M&M's, rice crispies cereal, and some other additional ingrediants I found in my cupboards.

This is a great after school snack.  It only takes a couple of moments to fix then you just pop it in the oven and before you know it they are ready.  The kids love it and I like adding different extras to it.

I made these bars and they were not "chewy" at all.  Just dry as a bone and too crumbly!  A waste of good ingredients!  Easy and quick to make, but not worth the time anyway!

Tried these today and they were quick/easy/and delicious!  Per previous reviewers I went ahead an added 1cup honey instead of 1/2 cup and they turned out just right. Dont think I'll be buying Granola bars EVER again!

These where great!! Picky eater kids like them, I do daycare and I prefer these over cookies. I'm glad I used 1 cup of honey like others suggested. They are messy but good!
