I made these for the second time and I want to write my new review deleting my original review from Sep 16, 2009. Actually we loved them but, in my opinion, the recipe need modifications. I used just 4 corn for this amount of other ingredients and this was enough. The previous time I used 8 corns as the recipe says and the corn overpowered. We felt just corn. Be sure to grind corn in a blender, it makes the difference. I added more basil and cilantro too. Delicious, but it is a time consuming recipe.
