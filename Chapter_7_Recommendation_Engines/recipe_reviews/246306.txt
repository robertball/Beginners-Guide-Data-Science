Took a chance and made this even tho no prior reviews! I did make several adjustments (sorry...) given what I had on hand. Used 5 large chicken thighs that I browned first.  Used sliced fresh mushrooms, a coarsely chopped bell pepper, a coarsely chopped onion, 14 oz can of Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes, a big splash of red wine and just 8 oz of chicken broth. Did not add the cheese  or cornstarch. Crockpot on low for 8 hours. I sat at work, worried it was going to be too soupy and not enjoyed by my crew. Served with ziti and italian bread. Luckily, hubby loved it! Stepdaughter had seconds (shocker!) and I ate the left over veggies over pasta the next day. Very good!

This recipe was a mess, I am afraid. I cook nightly with recipes from AllRecipes.com, and have enjoyed almost all of them. I followed the recipe to a "T". But this recipe was watery and lacked flavor. I wound up just mixing in jarred pasta sauce just to make it edible. 

In addition, the recipe was strange. It seemed to have combined two steps that should have been kept separate into one step, and I almost wound up dumping the cup of tomato mixture into the cheese the way it read.  Plus, it didn't specify how to serve the bone-in chicken and the recipe seemed to have forgotten that it was in the slow cooker when it directed us to stop in the pasta and top with cheese. Plus, 2 cups of cheese was way, way too much cheese.

Live and learn.  And I learned never to make this recipe again.
