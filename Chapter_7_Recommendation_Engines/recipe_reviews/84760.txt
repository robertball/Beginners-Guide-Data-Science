Fantastic recipe!  The hot chocolate is the secret ingredient here; it flattens the heat curve, allowing the full flavour of the chili to present itself before the heat comes on in a satisfying finish.  I made only a couple of changes to the recipe; being a red meat kind of guy, I used 1 lb of lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground moose, and added about a cup of pinto beans.  The only other modification was using one red bell pepper and one green pepper.  The finished product was absolutely stellar, and wound up easily winning first place at the company chili cook-off; it was the first pot to empty and people coming for thirds were disappointed to see it gone.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  To anyone considering deleting the hot chocolate or subbing pure cocoa: if you do, consider trying with the hot chocolate as well.  The effect of the cocoa and the sugar on the heat of the habaneros and hot sauce is pure magic.

Best chili I have ever eaten!! I have GERD so I need to watch my spice level -so I substituted the habanero for a jalapeno.

After cooking the turkey mixture, I put everything into a crock pot (minus Kidney Beans and Corn) - and slow cooked it for 6 hours (add the corn and beans last hour of cooking so it doesn't get too mushy).... now that's gooooooood!!

Great stuff.  Everyone I know who tries this thinks it's made with beef.  I leave out the seasoned salt and habanero, no complaints yet.  Don't be afraid to throw in half a Dove bar or a few Hershey's Kisses if you don't have the coco mix, it works!

This is really, really delicious! I added an extra half of an onion, used two habaneroes and left the seeds in half of one, made all dry spice measurements heaping, used one can of original and one can of undrained extra-hot tomatoes with green chilies, 2 cans of kidney beans, used scotch bonnet pepper hot sauce (but only a tsp), and added the corn earlier. Almost too hot but I won't ever use another recipe! Serve over Frito's, top with Mexican shreeded cheese blend, garnish with chopped onion and you've got a Texas Frito Pie!

That's some spicy chili! I am usually not a fan of spicy foods, but its the kind of spicy that creeps up after you put it in your mouth, then gets milder as soon as you swallow, so you aren't frantically gasping for water. I used the exact recipe except for two things: I added two whole jalapenos in with the veggies to sautee, only because my boyfriend likes to eat them whole. I also added a full can of corn, oh, and because I only had 1.3 lbs of turkey, I added an extra can of kidney beans. I used both light and dark which makes for pretty colors. Thanks so much for this!

This was one of the best chilis that I have ever had.  My whole family enjoyed.  It was just spicy enough but not too spicy.  Never heard of putting cocoa mix in chili before but I'm game and the taste was fantastic.  Could not even tell that this was chili made with turkey.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is by far the best chili I have ever made. My husband continues to rave about it and has requested that I make it again ASAP. The flavor of this chili is simply outstanding. I wimped out a bit and used a jalape√±o pepper rather than a habanero, but it was still outstanding. Wonderful recipe! Highly recommend!

I've been making all kinds of chili recipes for a while and this is the best.  The hot chocolate mix is the secret ingredient giving it a mole type flavor.

Okay...I am a total foodie!  I grew up down south and I love spicy foods and soul food.  I lived in Chicago for many years and that's where I really developed my tastes. 

This chili is SOOO freakin' good!  One of the best chocolate bars I ever had was chili chocolate, and the combination is stellar!! I would've never thought to add it in with chili, but why not?? So great!!

The only changes I made was a slosh more of beer and an additional can of beans.  I followed everything else exactly, and it just came out so wonderful!

I am making this for the second time upon this writing but plan to make, eat, share, and love this recipe for the rest of my life.  It just don't get no better y'all!

This chili was outstanding for a large crowd of people watching the Super Bowl!  The only thing differences to the written recipe were the following: hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes with chilies, salsa instead of tomato sauce, 2 jalapeno peppers instead of habanero pepper, and 2 bell peppers worth of diced red-yellow-green bell peppers...  The liquid smoke and the hot cocoa mix is superb in relaxing the heat and acidity of the chili at first bite.  It really makes for a second, third, and fourth helping as many did on Super Bowl Sunday.  Best I've ever made! Thanks for a great redcipe!

My friend made this while improvising a few of the ingredients, since we were in Peru and couldn't find everything listed. She also replaced  the beer with coffee, and WOW! i am definitely making this when I get back to the states!

This is my favorite chili recipe ever.  I've made it several times and it always delicous.  The only change I've made is not to add the extra pepper.  We top it off with sour cream and fritos.

This is one of the best chili recipes ever.  I rarely write reviews, but this dish has such a complex flavor (for a turkey chili recipe). All of the ingredients meld perfectly.  No need to change a thing.  Has a great level of heat.  Thanks for this awesome recipe..

Very good spicy chili. I used 1 lb lean ground beef and added 2 extra cans of beans (pinto and black). Everything else left the same. It came out great!

Made this one for my boyfriend's parents after a day of snowboarding. And they loved it! It was the perfect hearty, snowy-night dinner. I used two habanero peppers instead of one... We are all spicy food fans. Everything came together quickly, too! Great recipe!

Delicious.  Only substitutions I made was using ground beef instead of turkey since that's what I had on hand and used 1 hot green pepper along with 1 dried habanero (since dried is all that's available in my area).  Since I used the dried habanero, I didn't need to add any hot sauce at the end.  This made a very thick and filling chili.

Holy cow this chili was good!  You can't even tell that it is made out of turkey - I made my husband guess what it was and he never did. This chili is even better than the boilermaker chili on this site, which was our favorite until we found this one.  The only thing I changed was the type of chili pepper - I couldn't find the one needed so put in an aneheim pepper which is a little more mild. Thanks for a great recipe!  YUM!

This recipe was excellent.  The only changes I made was substituting Northern beans for the Kidney beans and I left out the corn and hot sauce at the end.  The flavor was great.  Very simple to make.

Great chili I just ate it and broke a little sweat.  I used 2 habanero's, and instead of all the meat, I used one can of white beans and two kidney.  I used one lb of strip steak instead of the turkey.  I also added three green chili peppers since my tomato sauce doesn't come with them.  Next time I'll add one more habanero.

Yum yum yum.  I used fresh corn on the cob, just shucked it and sliced the corn off and then threw it in.  Used one cob this time, will double it next.  I will probably also add more onion and maybe some mild green and red peppers to increase veggie content.  GREAT recipe as it stands, and really lends itself well to modifications to fit your own needs.   I did mine on the stove and let simmer for several hours, just added more beer (good stuff, not the cheap) to keep the moisture where I prefered it.  Definately a keeper and will be used over the winter as a ready meal or snack.

I‚Äôve been making this chili for about 7 years or so. I actually won a chili contest with this recipe. Tweak nothing. It‚Äôs perfect. Thank you! I usually quadruple the recipe, it freezes well.

Followed this recipe exactly as written. It was delicious! My husband who only likes MY chili, told me he couldn't decide which one was better. The cocoa added a wonderful surprise flavor, and he enjoyed a new and unusual chili...go for it!

This was really good!  I didn't have any tomato sauce so substituted pizza sauce (figured it was close enough) and left off the corn for my diabetic pal.  It was a hit for sure!   Yum!

This was awesome. I had to use two serrano peppers instead of the habanero because the store I shop at doesn't have habanero, but we will be trying it with habanero next time! I used ground deer meat instead of turkey and I omitted the corn because we only like corn on the cob. You have out done yourself my good sir. Thanks for sharing!

Made it exactly as written with these exceptions: didn't use the liquid smoke, only used one and a third pounds of ground turkey, and used 1 oz of 65% cacao dark chocolate instead of the hot chocolate mix. My boyfriend loved it, I loved it ... this one's a keeper!

My family LOVES this chili! I don't eat chocolate so I left out the instant hot chocolate mix. I take it down a notch in heat by leaving out the habanero pepper. Its even better when left in the fridge over night! Its worth the effort for sure. Thanks!

Great Chili.  Ended up slow cooking for around 4 hours on high.   Mistakingly used 2 tablespoons of crushed red peppers rather than 2 teaspoons.  Oops.  It really didn't need any more spice.  :)  Great with some fat free sour cream and low fat cheese!

My chili is not quite done...but is bubbling away in the crock pot and I have tasted it and can I just say YUMMY.  I only made a couple of changes to suit my family's taste.  I used a couple of pablano peppers instead of the hot peppers and bell peppers, I was out of red pepper flakes, I left out the corn and used 3 types of beans, and used a large can of crushed tom. and a can of fire roasted diced tom.  I didn't really measure the beer...just dumped in enough to get the consistancy I wanted and added about a cup of strong coffee to the mix.  I will have to try your spicy version and make it for my dad who loves his food spicy.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I never thought of adding cocoa, worchestershire, liqued smoke...they add the flavor my chili was always missing before.  LOVE IT!

Fantastic!! I added a little more liquid smoke and Worcestershire, and the heat level from two habaneros was just right for me. I served it with a dollop of Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce, which was awesome for offsetting the fire.

Made this tonight and got rave reviews! Definitely one of the best chilies I've ever had/made. I substituted the habanero for jalapeno, omitted the hot pepper sauce and it was still spicy enough for us. I'm generally a mild spice eater but even with my changes I thought it was more of a medium heat so watch out it you're not a big fan of heat! A great chili overall!

great recipe! I substituted sorano pepper for habanero due to the fact I couldn't find any at the store. I did how ever use habanero tobasco hot sauce. I also used kindney and pinto beans. I forgot to grab tomato sauce but found pizza sauce in the fridge and it worked great as a substitute.

I thought it was way too spicy but my boyfriend and his friends seemed to love it. I ended up adding lots of sour cream to my bowl just so I could eat it. Def. a different take on chili from what I was used to growing up, good mix of ingredients. Served with Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread from this site.

First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. The chili was great except it was too hot. I like a little heat but this was too much.  The next time I made it, I substituted jalapeno for the habanero pepper, added a can of pinto beans and left out the hot pepper sauce.  I also made it the night before.  Everyone said it was the best chili they ever had.   It was gone in 20 minutes with people coming back for seconds and thirds. Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this at least a dozen times now and it's the best chili recipe EVER. Don't worry about the heat of the habanero - if you cut out the seeds/pulp, it is very bearable. I even forgot the hot chocolate mix and used another reviewer's tip to throw in a couple Hershey kisses - you can't even tell! I also use a couple of cans of Campbell's tomato soup in place of the tomato sauce, I think it makes it more creamy and that's how my mom makes chili. This goes very well with cornbread!

I was skeptical about the chocolate but this is great.  I do add extra beans, usually pinto and I omit the corn.  I'm sure it's excellent as written, I just prefer my chili with a lot of beans.  Thank you!

Absolutely delightful! Full Five Star recipe. I substituted 2 lbs of dried pinto beans for the Kidney beans and omitted the meat to save $. Just threw all ingredients in pot skipping the saute part for about 2 1/2 hrs on simmer. Additionally,  I am not satisfied unless I use copious amounts of Rooster Hot Chili products so I substituted 2 tbs of Rooster Paste for the tomato sauce and used 2 tsp of Rooster Sauce for the hot sauce. I am personally convinced that the liberal consumption of beer enhances the endorphins that this  5 star recipe will produce and adds the finishing touch of ambiance to the overall experience making a very memorable meal, indeed!

Wild winter weather last night up here in Northwest N.J. and a perfect evening to make chili. Hubby and I made two pots; he did his own thing with beef and I made this recipe just for me. I used unsweetened cocoa powder and also put in about a half a cup of strong coffee. I used pinto and black beans instead of the kidney. One reviewer asked what the chocolate was supposed to do for the chili. All I can say is that it just adds a another layer of flavor. Jim, this is truly the best turkey chili and I thank you for submitting this delicious and hearty recipe!

This was very good, but a little too hot for me and I like hot stuff.  Next time I will add alot less of the hot pepper, omit the habanero and no hot sauce.  I will try with only 1/2 of the seasoned salt next time, since there's alot of sodium in this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  My stepson had 3 bowls!  I couldn't find the habanero so I used a jalapeno and ommitted the hot sauce.  It was plenty warm enough... just on that edge.

I really liked this. I did make a few minor adjustments... used less heat with a jalapeno because I am a wimp, used less turkey and added some fresh chopped spinach. I cooked this in the crockpot for I think about 3-4 hours on low. Had this with some homemade savory cornbread. yum

This is the best chili everrr!!  I only used 1 pkg. of ground turkey (20oz) 1 can of pinquinto beans, 1 can of black beans, did not have tomato sauce...so I did not drain the diced tomatoes. I also used  1 jalepeno pepper instead of the habenero. Only had 1 tablespoon of chili powder...did not miss the other and I  used a whole can of mexicorn. I would have never thought to put hot cocoa mix ...in chili....Wow....what a great recipe!!!

This was the first chili I ever made, and it is awesome! The supermarket didn't have the habenero, but I used a jalepeno to much success! I also doubled the kidney beans and used a whole pack of chili powder seasoning. Perfect, with a kick!

I made this tonight and the only change was that I didn't put the hot sauce in at the end.  I got rave reviews from DH and stepson.  What a great flavor this had and yes, it was spicy, but it was tasty!  Thank you for a great turkey chili!!!!!

This was good but I thought it was going to be like really really spicy. I added an extra habanero & a jalapeno. It was spicy, just was hoping it woulda been hotter.

Not knocking this recipe.  Just seemed like a lot of effort for a pretty good chili.  I reduced the cumin & red pepper (I used crushed), but other than that, pretty much followed the recipe.  Still hot enough to make your nose run, but not have your tongue burn/tingle.  'Glad I tried it. Doubt I'll make it again though. Second day:  Identified the taste.  It reminds me of Brunswick stew.  Well, if had more vegs; but that's the taste.

I won 1st prize the chili contest at my work with this recipe. I added a small bar of 70% chocolate bar in stead of choc.mix. My coworker voted it for tastiest, no oily after taste. Must try..

This was absolutely delicious!  Full of flavor.  Only changes I made were to use yellow and greens peppers, 2 jalapeno peppers instead of habanero, used a 0.71 packet of hot chocolate mix. one teaspoon of seasoned salt and added a can of black beans.  Everyone really enjoy it!

This is a GREAT chili recipe.  I followed as is except increasing the seasoning amounts slightly and using 1lb of ground sweet Italian sausage paired with 1lb of ground turkey.  I think this combination works wonderfully in this chili as the Italian sausage adds even more distinct flavors to this already delicious chili.   This is my first rating/review on allrecipes.com because this is the only recipe I have found that I thought deserved my time to review!  Awesome recipe Jimbolya!

This is outstanding chili, most everyone raved about it. I did tone down the spice a bit, as I always keep a spice mix on hand for those, like me, who like it hotter than hell.

VERY GOOD!!! BUT VERY SPICY!!!! I even cut out the Habaneroa and used a Jalapeno instead and NO HOt Sauce. Next time I will use Half of the jalapeno and half of the red pepper flakes and no hot sauce. It is a very tasty chili though. I also added a can of pinto beans, which is a good addition.

Best Chili recipe I've ever found and I won't be looking anymore for the perfect recipe - it's this one.  Before this recipe, I'd make chili every few years with various recipes and was always disappointed because other recipes produced chili that was too runny, not spicy enough or didn't taste all that interesting.  THIS ONE has a perfect amount of spice, is not runny, and is very delicious and is quickly eaten up.  I did eliminate the habanero pepper (way too spicy for me) and the liquid smoke (couldn't find) but the resulting recipe packs quite a spice punch anyways.  Thank you  and enjoy!

This is some good chili - don't omit the hot cocoa mix or beer!!!!  I did use ground beef and serrano peppers instead of the habanero - it's all I had.  My favorite part of the recipe is following the directions - "crack up a beer."  Great commentary (I finished the beer by the way, not throwing that down the drain).  Thanks for sharing!

This was very tasty.  I used two packages of Trader Joe's Empire brand ground turkey (very reliable).  Because we have a problem with GERD with some members of this family, I cut back in half the chili powder and red pepper flakes and left out the chili pepper, the liquid smoke (personal preference), and the hot pepper sauce.  I only used about half the packet of chocolate mix (just couldn't make myself add the whole thing).  For myself I added medium hot salsa.   I could have added more corn.  We served this with cilantro, sour cream, and chopped green onions.  My family said that this is a "GO" for a second time around.  This is the first time my family liked ground turkey in a chili!

We followed your recipe to the T, and it was FANTASTIC!  This is coming from a chili fanatic  :)  The ONLY thing I will do diffrent next tim, is double or triple the habanero amount..  I was excited to get my mouth burnt off, but it was actually pretty mild. (but we like HOT HOT food).  Thanks alot for sharing this recipe!  Will make it again real soon.

Followed the recipe exactly, except for the liquid smoke.  To be honest I was dissapointed - had a sweetness to it that I don't like in a chili.  Must have been the coco-powder.  Too much meat in my opinion too - would probably reduce to 1.2-1.5 lbs.  Perfect level of spiciness though - might even consider adding 2 habeneros if you really want it hot.

Very tasty, hearty and spicy chili.  I even used ground  turkey breast and it tasted good!  I did make a few changes -- I did not add the hot chocolate mix or the liquid smoke.  I also didn't have chili powder so i subbed cajun spices, which made it very spicy so I omitted the hot sauce.  Finally, I used chicken broth instead of beer.  I'm not convinced it has to be simmered for 50 minutes.

Wow!! What a great recipe! This would be great for a Superbowl party. Or any cold day for that matter.:P After having some without any additions, try it Frito Pie style with a dallop of sour cream, some Mexican cheese mix, and some fritos tossed in. Delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Awesome recipe! The hot chocolate mix added a nice touch although it sounded wierd to me at first. I left out the habanero from the recipe but added some to my own plate so my wife could eat too. This recipe makes a lot, probably more like 12 servings, so nutritional info is probably overstated since it's based on 8. Thanks!

i wanted to try something different today and was worried half way through b/c all i could taste was "mole".. then reading the reviews comparing this to mole just made it worse.. but once i had let everything simmer for the full 50 minutes it tasted more like chili.. didn't have any habaneros so used 3 baby jalapeno's from our little plant.. seeds/veins and all.. had a nice heat on the end.. ty for the recipe

I have made this chili over and over again for 3 years, I think. My peeps -- friends and family -- LOVE IT. I nix the liquid smoke and 1/2 the Worcestershire sauce (salty stuff). I use 2 onions. I add some (2 TBPS) green chilies (love hot). I trade the habenero for jalapeno. I also use frozed corn at the end instead of canned. I add 2 cans of pinto beans too. Easy to make (somebody commented it was a lot of effort and I completely disagree) and just DELICIOUS!  This is how we do chili in my house - awesome recipe!

I always tend to use ground turkey in lieu of ground beef - it's healthier. After relentlessly searching I found this. There is NO turning back. The first spoonful is full of flavor - a cornucopia of taste. It truly drags you back for another spoonful. The heat kicks up. But you can't stop. The flavor. It pulls you back in. This chili has done the rotation. My father-in-law requests it during the winter. My pals ask for it when we watch the games on Sunday. The boys ask me to bring it on our hunting trip. Even got rave reviews around the office. The daughter (8) loves it. My dog sits and oogles me as I eat. 
THE ONE AND ONLY WORK OF CAUTION. You will have "issues" the next day - it has got to be the all the spice - but  it if it isn't worth it. With all due respect to Dr. Scoville, we really should rename this, Devil's Revenge Chili.

Very good turkey chili! I added 2 jalapenos instead of a habanero, omitted the kidney beans and added a whole can of corn. Also added some celery because my bf likes it that way. Really tasty! It was spicy but, not too spicy. You wouldn't miss the beef. I would definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe! I made 2 double recipes of chili for my Super Bowl Party...this one and Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili.  My preference was this recipe and it was was preferred by the majority (60% - 70% ??) of the guests, although the beef chili was really tasty as well.   I prepared both chili's the day before and warmed them in a crockpot for serving the following day.  I was leary of the hot chocolate mix, but it was a nice touch.  Knowing it was there, I could faintly taste it, but none of the guests could tell. The only alterations I made were to use the chili seasoning mix recipe from this site and to omit the habanero peppers as I didn't want to make it too hot since I was serving a large group with varying tastes.  This is going in my regular rotation!

I made this for the first time and the chocolate was overpowering‚Äîit tasted sweet! I think my mistake was running out of Worcestire sauce (so I didn't get a full tbsp) and I couldn't get my hands on any liquid smoke. To counteract the chocolate I had to dump in a jar of salsa and try to temper it with extra hot sauce, chili powder, cumin and oregano. I'll try this again with all the ingredients on hand, but use caution with the chocolate and make sure to have enough tomatoes in your pantry.

This chili was incredible! My boyfriend didn't even realize it was turkey and not beef! Melted some cream cheese in at the end and topped with shredded cheddar. Just be careful when chopping and cooking the habanero - it gives off a lot of heat! So yummy though!

This turned out great! We took a couple of liberties (used 2.5 lb of turkey, cocoa powder & sugar instead of hot cocoa mix, jalepeno instead of habenero, etc.) but it still came out with a really complex, well-balanced flavor. It's definitely making it into the monthly rotation.

Made this recipe as my first time making chili.  It was a huge hit!   I don't like real spicy so I used a serrano pepper rather than a habanero.  My husband likes a more watery chili so I also added more beer but other than that made it exactly as suggested.   Will definitely make again.

So glad I decided to try a new chili recipe! The combination of ground spices and hot chocolate is absolutely perfect. I omitted the habanero cause I'm a wuss, and I didn't have any liquid smoke. I also had to find a sub for the beer, so I used coffee. Loved this chili!!

I agree, one of the best I have tried. And I am working my way through a chili cookbook. Had never had ground turkey and you could not tell. No beans for us ever and I added the whole beer since I used 3 lbs instead of 2lbs of turkey.

I love this recipe.  This has become my go-to recipe for a tasty, warming, winter chili. I also love the fact that it calls for ground turkey rather than red-meat. The first time I made it I was a little wary of putting in the hot cocoa mix, but it really does work! Thanks JIMBOLYA for a GREAT recipe.

I substituted turkey meat from leftover Christmas dinner instead of ground turkey.  It still turned out awesome.

Great chili! I topped mine with sharp cheddar, sour cream and cilantro, and served it with quesadillas. Also served with fried grits (that were leftover from breakfast) and it was delicious :D

Oh yummy yummy!  I altered it some as I used what was on hand and I couldn't have handled it as hot as it would have been anyhow.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 1 hr on high and 6 hrs on low.  I used leftover thanksgiving turkey, diced, a red and a green bell pepper, a sweet onion, small can of diced green chiles, 10 oz can of chile verde salsa, about a half a small can of diced jalepenos, a 14 oz can of tomatos, most of a 14 oz can of corn, half a can of beer, the worstershire and smoke and all the seasonings except the rep pepper flakes, 8 oz tomato sauce, smoke, and hot chocolate, no beans as I didn't have any.  Just dumped it all in the pot, no precooking.  Really good, spicy enough for my spice loving husband, and right on the edge of what I can handle.  Topped with cheese and sour cream, some sourdough garlic bread on the side.  Yum.

Hot and sassy but depth of flavor lacking. For all the ingredients, I was expecting a bit more flavor. We prefer a thicker chili than found with this one. I would make this again if craving something spicy hot. Thanks JIMBOLYA!

Seems like a lot of ingredients, but really gives it a complex flavor. My husband asks for this all the time. It makes a lot and I often serve it to guests. We love it. It's always well received by our guests. I use a jalepeno instead of habenero. I serve it with a cheddar/green chile corn bread. Delish!

The first time I made this was right when my father came home from the hospital and I took a week and a half off of work to stay home with him.  He requested this for lunch every single day until it was gone, and then asked when I'd make more.  He's only even liked one other dinner dish I've EVER made.  My family likes corn and beans so I put in extra of both, but otherwise I don't really change anything.  Sometimes I do all turkey, sometimes half turkey and half ground beef, depending on what I have and what's on sale.  Always delicious.

This recipe is pure genius. The liquid smoke combined with the habenaro combined with the hot chocolate mix makes for a chili unlike anything I've ever had before. The garlic just adds to it as well. Just don't eat it right before going to bed. The hotness might give your insides a run for its money.

It worked great to cut this recipe in half to feed 4 of us.  I wish I made the larger serving because it is SO delicious!  I put in the full amount of peppers, which was a perfect balance of spice and flavor. I also added extra portions of the veggies, plus celery and roasted green chilies which gave it a very fresh addition. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a huge hit! The cocoa really helps develop the flavor and give this depth that many chilis lack, so don't skip it. I left out the liquid smoke (not a fan) and used a red chili pepper and a jalapeno instead of the habanero. I also used half dark and half white organic ground turkey, and fire roasted organic tomatoes. So yummy! A keeper.

This was the best chili I've ever had! I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except I halved it to get 4 servings (though it didn't make quite 4 servings, probably closer to 3). My only complaint was that it wasn't quite "liquidy" enough--maybe next time I'll add more tomato sauce (and thus a little more spices). Will definitely make again.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I made it for a party and it was a huge hit.  Since I was worried about it being too spicy for some people, I used 2 jalepeno peppers instead of the habanero and I omitted adding the pepper sauce at the end.  It still had a really nice kick to it and the flavor was unbelievable.  I will definitely make this my one and only turkey chili recipe!

This recipe was quick and easy to make. I had most of the ingredients on hand too! I added an extra habanaro pepper and one pablano for heat but the main seasonings really give this chili it's flavor. It was terrific!!!I will definitely make this one again!!

This is the most amazing chili I've ever eaten.  It might take a little extra time to make but the end result is well worth the effort.  I used ground turkey breast which probably always makes a difference in any recipe.  It really was not too hot, but rather, just right for a truly awesome and perfect scratch, authentic southwestern chili.   By the way, what in the heck does cocoa mix do?  Obviously I'm not a gourmet. Thanks for sharing!

The hot cocoa got me all intrigued and I am thankful I gave it a shot. Very good turkey chili! Excellent combination of flavors. I only had jalapeno so used that instead of habanero and omitted liquid smoke because I didn't have any but added extra 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin. Thank you!

I was extremely skeptical of adding the cocoa mix. I doubled the recipe but just added cocoa per single recipe.  After tasting, I ended up adding the second packet of cocoa.. Delicious!!!!  Will definitely make again.

I will preface this review by acknowledging I am a novice when it comes to cooking.  I decided to surprise my wife with a prepared meal and chose this one based on the reviews.  Wow!!!!  This turkey chili was a home run with the both of us.  Easy preparation, great flavors, and not too spicy...I even added an additional habenero.  I will keep this one in the recipe box!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1lb. hot italian sausage and 1lb. grass fed beef. One of the best chilis I've ever made. Next time I'll make sure to have turkey on hand to up the healthy factor a bit.

Oh wow! I love this chili because I love spicy food. This is by far the spiciest chili I've ever made and I loved every bite. Some recipes sacrifice flavor for spicy, but this recipe had both! I accidentally only purchased one can of the diced tomato and green chilies, but it tasted fine with just one. Next time I'll read the recipe more carefully and try it with two!

Amazing recipe! I make as is except I do a jalapeno for the habenero. I make this for our Sunday family dinner and everyone loves this. It doubles well also (We have lots of people on Sunday!). Has that perfect heat level and has some great depth with the hot cocoa and smoke so it's not just hot that you are tasting. Love this stuff!

This recipe is SO good. Everyone who tries it loves it, especially my husband (He only learned it was turkey and not beef a week ago, and I've been making it for a year :)).  I've made it with jalapenos and no habanero before; it turns out great both ways. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This turned out great!  We had grown peppers in our garden this year so I was excited to use them in this chili.  I used red bell pepper instead of green, and in addition to a habanero, added a cayenne pepper and 2 bird's eye chili peppers also.  We did not seed our peppers, but cut down the amount of chili powder to about 1 tbsp (ran out).  Added a can of chili beans with sauce and omitted liquid smoke (didn't have any).  Also put in a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot at the end instead of a whole tbsp.  This turned out spicy, but not scorching.  I really enjoyed the flavors and it tasted even better the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I use this recipe every year for an annual get together party and it's always a huge hit that has people coming back for more. I don't like corn in chili so I substitute it for a can of black beans. Also since there's never any cheap beer in our house, I find the expensive kind works just as well. Thanks for a great turkey chili recipe for my spicy-loving friends and I!

This was AWESOME chili!  I love turkey chili, and make it somewhat often.  It's hearty, has alot of kick, loved the hot cocoa in it, not too noticable.  ( I used Starbucks hot cocoa, it's all I had!)  Didn't have the liquid smoke, so I used a chipolte Tabasco instead.  Delicious!  Will make again!  And over the recipes I already have been using.  Glad I got bored and looked up some recipes!

Awesome! And I don't usually go for turkey chili, but I had 2 lbs in the fridge and came upon this recipe. I didn't have a habanero, so I added another bell pepper and bit of extra habanero sauce instead. Very spicy and tasty. 

This might be my new favorite chili recipe. I've made it several times. If I don't have turkey, I've substituted beef. I've also used whatever kinds of peppers I happened to have, and/or added other kinds of hot peppers in addition to the green bell and habanero, but other than that, I've kept the recipe the same. The mixture of spices is just delicious.

MMM!! So good. Just spicy enough and plenty of flavor! I make it in the crock pot and let it cook overnight. My boyfriend likes to take it to work for everybody in his squadron and they all love it.

My husband and I have had this 2 days in a row now (dinner and then lunch the next day) and it has been friggin AMAZING each time! I'm usually a weenie with spicy stuff but this was great! Not unbearable, but still left a tingle on my tongue. Used a green and a red bell pepper, and didn't have corn, but either way it was DEEEEELISH! My husband says I should use 2 habaneros next time, not sure I'm brave enough for that! LOL I felt weird putting the hot coco in, but honestly if I didnt know that I put it in there, I wouldn't have detected it. Served this in heaping bowls with shredded sharp cheddar and a dollop of sour cream on top along side cornbread. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN! :)

Awesome! This is the best chili I have ever had, hands down. I actually went out and bought the ingredients I didn't have, so you're not going to read about how I substituted this for that or altered the recipe one bit. It was spicy- the way I like it, extremely hearty, and as a fan of putting healthy spins on traditionally unhealthy meals, very satisfying. You will not be disappointed by the lack of hamburger meat. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe that translated well to the crock pot. After sauteing the veggies and meat I transferred to a crock pot, added the rest of the ingredients and simmered overnight. However, even after spending 12 hours in the crock the chocolate tasted exactly like what it was... hot chocolate mix. A better option IMHO would be some Dove chocolate squares or similar. I also added an extra 14 ounce can of tomato sauce as it had more of a gravy feel than I like. I prefer a more tomato based sauce in my chili.

Excellent flavors!  I made this last night as written, tasted it and really liked the heat level, the flavor and the texture.  However, knowing my husband prefers a more beans to meat ratio than this recipe provided, I ended up doubling most of the ingredients with the exception of the tomato sauce & habanero (didn't have) and added an extra can of red, cannelli and 2 cans of black beans.  Same great flavor as when tasted before doubling and served with grated cheddar and diced sweet onion.  Yum! The heat level was perfect, I don't think I would add 2 habaneros when making again. When I told my husband what was in it, specifically the hot chocolate mix and the liquid smoke, he was wowed!  This is now in my file box and I will be making it again!

Fantastic chili and you would never know it is turkey. I cannot wait to make this again and play around with the recipe a little. Maybe some more types beans and another veggie? I also used jalapenos instead of a habenero to bring down the heat just a little.

I was really skeptical about this chili but the spicy is perfectly balanced out by the little bit of sweet. It is one of the best I have EVER had! And I am pretty picky about chili.

This is by far my favorite recipe for chili.  I have trouble with heartburn, so I used a jalepeno pepper instead of habanero.  I had NO heartburn, and more importantly, the chili did not lack flavor or a kick.  I also cooked dry kidney beans instead of using canned.  That is only because I have been cooking beans for so many years that it has turned me into a bit of a bean snob.  :-)  For me, canned beans just don't have the same flavor, but I do understand some people don't have the time to cook them.  I also used Mexican oregano instead of Mediterranean.  Will be making this many times!

Made this for a family dinner and it got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe, left out the corn and hot pepper sauce. It came out a little too hot for our tastes so I added three times the beans to counteract. I will certainly make this again but I will cut back a bit on the smoke flavoring. Thanks for sharing!

This has become our favorte chili recipe ever.  We love the habanero pepper in it.  Perfection.  For those weekends we are with family, we tone it down and use a little jalapeno instead.

SOOOOO Good!!!  Left out habanero, jalapeno and corn, added a couple squirts more Sriracha sauce and it was AMAZING!  SO much flavor and the right amount of heat.  Made my face damp with sweat but didn't make me want to put my face in a snow bank.  This will be a hit if you make it for a group or your family of chili lovers.

I thought this chili was awesome! I following the recipe almost to a T, except that I let out the liquid smoke because I didn't have any, and used a jalapeno pepper instead of the habanero because that would be a little too spicy for us! It still had plenty of kick without feeling like you were going to cry from the heat! Excellent recipe, I'll be making this again soon!

This is an excellent chili recipe and the best turkey chili I've ever had. I have already made it 3 times. I have to use beef broth instead of beer because of a gluten intolerance and add more tomatoes/tomato sauce because I like more tomatoes. It is still quite delicious.

Absolutely Amazing!! Husband said it was the best chili I've ever made. I did turn this into a crock pot meal just because I wanted the house to smell like chili all day until it was time to eat. I cooked all the veges and turkey on stove, then just threw it all in the slow cooker. On Low for 4 hrs. This chili had a perfect amount of kick!

Good Chili. I love Worcestershire sauce in this. I didnt add corn or liquid smoke. and I used ground beef...I was hestitant about the hot chocolate powder, but it was actually great. I could have done without the beer.

It was kind of watery and had too much meat.  I prefer my chili thicker.  I didn't think the hot chocolate really added anything either.  However, I liked the spice combo.

Just made this last night. I omitted many of the spicy things (habaneros, red pepper flakes, etc.)and the beer because I was not too sure if it would be safe for my 10 yrs old cousin to eat. The biggest issue is that it NEEDED SALT! I followed everything else exactly but that lack of salt ruined all the flavor behind it. After adding it, it was greatly improved but I still felt it needed something. I won't discard the recipe because the chocolate was interesting, I'll just play around with more seasoning in search of that missing puzzle.

This is one of my favorite things to make in the winter. It is so warming because of the heat, both temperature wise and flavor wise. I love it over rice, it is the perfect meal. When I make it it lasts for days and I do not get sick of it AT ALL. Soo yummy. I pretty much follow the recipe exactly (even the hot chocolate)..although i tend to scale back just a bit on the seasoned salt because it can seem a little too salty if you use all 2 tsp. I usually use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and add in 2 small cans of tomato paste just to thicken it up a bit. I have never used the smoke flavoring b/c I cant find it at the store when I go and dont add in the corn or hot sauce, as I don't find either necessary. BEST CHILI EVER if you are a spicy food fan like myself. It's definitely only for those with tastebuds that can take alot of heat!

Amazing recipe. I followed the ingredients spot on except i added two very small green jalapenos to yhe mix with all the other veggies at the sauteing portion. The flavors go so well together and really compliment each other. What people say about the turkey being mistaken for beef is true and you would never know unless you were the one making it that this ever had cocoa mix inside. This recipe is pure genius! My husband cant get enough!

Great chili.  It is a bit spicy; so I added two tablespoons of honey.  Since tomato sauce was not in my cupboard, used some marinara (had to improvise).  When the chili was just about done, added fresh parsley.  Had with shredded cheese; chopped chives and fresh corn bread.  Great football food!

We are from Texas where chili is judge harshly and this recipe is great!  We make it at least once a month and my husband loves it.  We add a little spice by doubling the red pepper flakes.  My husband also has a bad habit of drinking the beer if I put it on the counter so I wait to get that last.  Hook 'em Horns!

I've only cooked about two dozen times in my life and I love easy recipes like this.  Not only easy but tastes great too.  I'm not sure why people are saying it's too spicy, I put 4 habaneros with seeds in and it wasn't spicy enough, and I'm not a spice fiend either.  Here are the changes I made: 1.25 lbs turkey, 2 cans kidney beans, can black beans, whole can corn, big can diced tomatoes, big can crushed tomatoes, one big red & green bell pepper, no onion, no liquid smoke, teaspoon cayanne, a bit of vinegar.  Browned the turkey in crock pot, dumped everything else in and got drunk.  4 hours later BOOM, done.

Very good! As a warning though, this chili is quite spicy as written. I left out the red pepper flakes and half of the hot sauce and it still had a good kick.  Don't leave out the cocoa (I substituted 1 tbl cocoa powder and 1tbl sugar) it definitely adds to the recipe.

I made this for a "Chilli Cookoff" and it was the first crock pot empty!!  I used beef instead of turkey and omitted the hot pepper sauce and habenero peppers as my children had to eat it!  It didn't win but everyone still loved it!

Used 1 1/2 tablespoons of diced jalapenos instead of the habanero pepper. And, before adding the hot sauce, I decided to give it a taste and it was plenty hot enough, so I left out the hot sauce. I also used extra lean ground turkey. This was an excellent chili. You could not tell it was made with ground turkey. I will definitely do this one again.

Hands-down, my favorite chili recipe ever. I've made it following the recipe (except for the beans - I leave those out), for that nice hot and spicy flavor, and also toned it down for the kids. The last time I made it, I only used half the red pepper flakes, and none of the habenero, yet it was still too spicy for my kids. Next time, I am going to leave out the red pepper flakes, and only use one can of Rotel and then two cans of regular diced tomatoes and see how that turns out. GREAT flavor!!

I must say the hot chocolate packet ruined it for me.  Maybe a teaspoon, but not a whole packet.  I could taste the hot chocolate flavor.  Great recipe other than that.

This chili was awesome! This is the first time I've ever made chili so I was really impressed with how great it turned out. I love extra heat so I used 3 Habanero peppers and it went so good with the extra beer I had. It was a little sweet though so I think next time I won't use the hot cocco mix or use less.

This chili is fantastic! It's so rich and delicious. I did omit the harbanero chili and it was still plenty spicy. I also cut the turkey down to one pound and that was plenty. I'm going to try it in the crockpot next time. Yum!!

This is the best chili recipe EVER!!!  We make this at least monthly and more in winter!  We use jalape√±o pepper, omit liquid smoke, and can only find diced tomatoes and green chiles in separate cans, which is fine.   We sometimes make it just for freezing in lunch portions to take to work.   People always ask us for the recipe and we give it freely!   Thank you for the best chili recipe ever!!!

My husband can't handle spicy, but I really wanted to try this, so I just cut all the spices in half.  It was still too spicy for him, but perfect for me!  Oh, and to make it vegetarian, I added two more cans of beans and left out the turkey.  It was by far the best chili I've ever had in my life :)

As far as chili recipes goes, this is as close to perfection as you can get! I think I've found the missing ingredient that should have been in all the other chili recipes I've tried.. hot cocoa mix! It definitely eases the heat, which is good because I am kind of a spice wimp :) The recipe is very adaptable, too, so you can kind of make it with whatever you have on hand (I use only 1 pound of ground turkey and an extra can of beans, 1 orange pepper, 1 jalapeno instead of habanero, etc.). What really makes this recipe is the hot cocoa mix, the liquid smoke and the spice combination (though I use "heaping" measurements..) so don't for get to add them! I'm not sure what the beer adds but I love beer so I always include it.. I've got a pot simmering on the stove right now!

I omitted the Habanera Pepper thinking that it would not make this recipe so hot. I was wrong; ‚ÄúAs Is‚Äù this recipe is WAYYY too hot. With the red pepper flakes, and the Hot pepper sauce at the end this recipe is almost unbearable. I do want to give this recipe another chance though; I like the ingredients used so I think I will omit more of the Spicy ingredients next time and see how it tastes. AS IS though, way too hot to the point you almost can‚Äôt enjoy it! We put Sour cream in our chili and everything and it was too spicy.

Excellent turkey chili recipe!  I've made it twice so far and it's amazing.  I use 2 cans of tomato sauce, do not drain the diced tomatoes, and add an additional can of kidney beans for consistency.  By sauteing the turkey with the spices gives the meat so much flavor.  I tried another turkey chili recipe and it was bland b/c the recipe didn't season the meat prior to adding the liquids.

Typically I'm not a huge fan of chili, but this recipe is delicious. WARNING: Do not dice the habenero pepper without gloves. My fingers were burning all night! The chili is plenty spicy for me, but the heat/spice does not overpower the flavor... it's just perfect. I like chili equally balanced with meat, beans and tomato. So, in addition to the kidney beans, I added a can each of white & black beans, the full can of corn, and an extra can of diced tomatoes. Let it sit overnight before eating. The spice calms down and the flavors blend together nicely.

Well this recipe is smokin' and no pun intended. I was serving this for company so my hubby suggested I lay off the habanero and substitute a jalapeno just incase the rest of the world isn't as brave as our spicy family... that's the only change I made and spice was NOT lacking in the least. This is a very good chili as is with the Turkey but I am sure one could use beef if that is your taste preference. Great Autumn meal here in New England!

Rating now so I don't forget what I've done.  Superb.  No green peppers, no corn, no oregano.  1 can pinto, 1 can chili beans both drained.  2# ground turkey browned with garlic and onion then all in the crockpot.  Cannot believe how fabulous this recipe is!  Who thinks of these combinations?!  Thank you for sharing.

Very spicy! ..and I left out one teaspoon of the crushed red peppers.  I thought the whang of the habenero pepper overwhelmed the dish, but the next day, the flavor had mellowed out and I enjoyed it more.

This really was the best chili I ever tasted...the other reviews were right! I subbed 2 seeded jalepenos, 2-3 chipotle peppers in adobe sauce plus an extra tsp or so of the sauce to give it that nice smokey flavor (instead of liquid smoke) and used 1 tblsp unsweetened cocoa powder with 1 tblsp brown sugar, 1-28 oz can diced tomatoes and 1 14 oz can pinto beans. Anything can work in this recipe provided there is some form of chocolate to make it sing. I don't like sweet chili, so less sugar works for me. I didn't find the spicyness of these ingredients to be overwhelming as I could still taste the chili!

Oh my goodness. This is, quite possibly, the best chili I have EVER had- I can't believe I made it myself. I followed the recipe exactly, and wouldn't change a thing. With the list of ingredients, I was worried this would be a lot of work, but it couldn't be easier. I threw the onion/garlic/pepper/habanero in the food processor, and the rest is spices or canned. I love how wonderfully smoky and complex the flavors are. Un-buh-lieveable.

I was a first time chili-maker.  My mom would make it at home and I had a craving.  THIS IS NOT YOUR MOTHERS CHILI.  But it is amazing.  It sounds like a lot of measuring, but it's worth the effort.  You will enjoy!

Update from original review from 2008: This is still my favorite chili by far and still my go to recipe so many years later. Still not huge into spicy so I alter the pepper flakes, jalape√±os, and hot sauce to the liking. I occasionally  use a tablespoon of cocoa powder in place of the instant hot cocoa if none is available. Must try and sure to win at the office chili cookout. 
Original review:  WOW!!!!!!! Now I am not a super fan of the spicy so I omitted the red pepper flakes, used seeded jalapenos, and 1 can diced tomato w/ green chiles and one regular can diced tomatos. This recipe is sooo delicious!!!! You must try it, the hot chocolate and the beer make this recipe perfect. Note: I used the Mexican Bean Salad recipe from AR in place of the kidney beans and corn because I didn't want to waste it...perfect way to use left overs!

One of the best chili recipes I've tried. I added another can of kidney beans and some black beans. Also used two habaneros - it was spicy but it wasn't a painful spicy where you couldn't eat it. The cocoa seemed to tone it down. It was a little hard to cook the turkey in the same pot on just one side though. I will probably cook the turkey in a separate pan next time and then mix it in to the veggies.

if i coulda licked the pot i would've! =P delicious and easy. i did use 3 jalapenos with seeds in them b/c after superbowl sunday a lot of chili items were out of stock but mmmmm. i also used 1Tbsp of cocoa powder and 1Tbsp of brown sugar instead of the packet of cocoa that i didn't have. I didn't even consider myself a chili fan but this definitely changed my mind.

DELICIOUS!!  I made just a few changes.  I used 1 lb each lean ground turkey and lean ground beef.  I also used the seeds from 1 habenero and added an extra half of another without seeds.  Mine also reduced quite a bit, so I added an extra can of tomato sauce and about a cup of water.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup or so of corn.  The spiciness was well balanced and had a nice complex flavor.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe and it was fantastic. I cooked it for my FIL, who doesn't like spicy food, so I omitted the habanero, red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. Substituted two 300g packages of veggie mince for the turkey and pinto beans for the kidney beans. Used red pepper instead of the green pepper, and substituted smoked paprika for regular paprika as I couldn't find liquid smoke. Used regular tomatoes (undrained) as couldn't buy ones with green chilies and doubled the amount of corn. The best chili I've ever made or eaten! Thanks for the recipe.

This is fantastic chili! My husband and I were trying to recreate (and make healthier) our favorite chili fries from a restaurant where we used to live. I made a couple changes based on what I had (or didn't have) on hand. I only had one pound of ground turkey so I added two cans of kidney beans. I omitted the liquid smoke and the habanero pepper(didn't have any). I used one green and one red bell pepper. I like corn in my chili so I used a whole can of corn. I don't have beer in the house so I used some red wine. I only used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and didn't use hot sauce because my husband doesn't like spicy food. It still came out pretty spicy. I liked the little bit of sweetness from the hot cocoa mix, but wanted a bit more so I added a couple tablespoons of honey. It was great served over potato wedges with cheese, sour cream, crumbled bacon, diced tomatoes, chopped green onions and pickled jalapeno slices on top. I will make this again and again. Be sure to have lots of water handy!

Very Spicy tasty chili! My little girl doesn't like food to Hot, so I omitted the habanero pepper and it was still plenty spicy. I don't think my family even noticed it was turkey.

This chili was excellent, although I made a few changes based on personal preference. I used jalapeno pepper instead of the habanero, cut the crushed red pepper flakes by half, omitted the liquid smoke, substituted black beans for the kidney beans, and just threw in the whole can of corn. The chili came out a mild-medium spiciness, and was a real crowd-pleaser. Sadly, there were no leftovers for me to take to work. Guess I'll make a bigger recipe next time!

My son (and I as the silent partner) made this recipe for our church's Men's Chili Cookoff.  He got 3rd place---behind store bought and 'dump in cans of stuff'chili.
Rather disappointing, but WE like it lots, hence my rating.

I have to admit that I made some large changes to this recipe - but thought it was great for a base to add ingredients that I did have. I didn't have any of the peppers, but substitued a hot homemade salsa that had all the peppers in it. I also used cubed turkey with great success. Didn't have chocolote packets but did use unsweetened cocoa powder and a little splenda. I made this a little thicker and served it with corn torillas as wraps. Very well received by all.

Awesome hearty chili!  I added strips of fresh zuccinni also since I had it on hand.  Make sure you put a dollop of sour cream and cheese melted on top!  So good!

Really nice. I expected to be burnt alive by the habanero's, but as a previous reader said, the coco mix took care of that, albeit I used chocolate syrup in it's place and left out the corn. I will add this recipe to my collection as it is an alternative to my own beef chili recipe.

Skipped the tomato sauce and used black beams instead of kidney beans. Also had no fresh hot peppers so used a sweet red pepper and went heavy on the chili flakes and hot sauce. Tasted wonderful even with the substitutions.

Fantastic! I used two jalapenos, one without seeds, instead of a habanero. Gives it a little kick but not too much.

Other than subbing a Jalape√±o  pepper for Habanero and using 1/2 the recommended red pepper flakes - made with exact other ingredients and measurements and I am very happy with the results - spicy, but not whoa and tastes great - thanks for sharing - its a keeper - Happy cooking

Everyone loves when I make this chili! I sub the habanero for jalapeno peppers, and add a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of green onions at the end. I also like to serve over white rice. Awesome recipe!

By far my all time favorite chili recipe! I usually cut the recipe in half for my family of four. I do make a few minor changes/omissions. I use grass-fed ground beef instead of ground turkey, gluten free beer, pure cocoa powder, leave out the liquid smoke, habanero pepper and kidney beans since we follow a more traditional Paleo diet. The result is an amazingly flavorful chili!

Wow!  This chili was so good, I'll never make another chili again. I am a bit of a wimp with spiciness, so I used a jalape√±o instead of a habanero. I also opted not to use hot sauce. It was still plenty spicy, and the combination of flavors is simply outstanding. It was a hit with the family and they've already requested I make it again. It was easy to make, so this is going to get made again and again.

This is a great recipe but I found it was a little too dry for our taste.  Consequently I used 2 15oz cans of tomato sauce, added 1/4 C Ketchup (for more tomato flavor) and 4 undrained 10oz cans of Rotel Hot diced tomatos with habanero (I used 1 jalapeno instead of a habanero pepper because of this).  This is our new favorite, thanks for sharing!

This must be the best chili I've ever made.  I took notes from Elfman 42 and made his changes with the red & green bell peppers.  It made for a colorful chili!  And I only had an expensive beer so that worked fine.  The only heat I used was the chili powder and ONE teaspoon of chili flakes.  And then used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey.  Wonderful recipe!

Great recipe.  Worked well with ground beef as well.  Needed about 1 tablespoonful more chilli powder than stated in the recipe, in my opinion.

Dee-lish! I usually prefer to leave my chili for 24 hours to let the flavours meld but didn't feel like making two meals tonight so we ate it right away. The beer made it more watery than I like so I added an extra can of kidney beans.  My trick is to mash the extra beans up quite a bit first. They really thicken the pot. I wanted to skip making a side salad (must be REALLY lazy tonight!) so I threw in a couple of handfuls of shredded carrot. 
I'm looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow night!

Pretty good chilli, I used Blair's ghost pepper for the hot sauce and didn't happen to have any beers left for this. Didn't ad the corn either. Instead of liquid smoke I had smoked chipotle powder and I used cocoa and brown sugar instead of hot chocolate.  I'd like to try it using beer next time.

My hard to please husband loved this chili.  He said he would never have known it was turkey instead of ground beef.  I followed the recipe except substituted a couple jalapenos for the habanero and 3 dark chocolate Hershey kisses for the hot chocolate mix.  Very good recipe- I live in Texas and am making it two weeks in a row - in April - at hubby's request!

Awesome!  Nobody can believe its turkey!  Only little tweaks:  I use a heaping TBS of cocoa instead of the hot choc packet and I halve the liquid smoke.  Put it in the crockpot for football season---winner.

Very good , in almost every way.  Hot chocolate was a very good idea, but I used the blender to mix the beer, the sauce, the smoke flavoring, 1 tsp cinnamon and home grown hot peppers (aji amarillo and cascabel to taste, with one tin (1 1/2 cup) of black beans and 1 tin (1 1/2 cup) kidney or pinto beans for a richer flavor.  There is enough salt in the canned goods we never add any extra.

I knew this was going to push my hot tolerance so I left out the habanero and the hot sauce and it was about perfect for me (w/ some sour cream) - I could still taste at the end of my bowl, but my mouth was pretty firey!  I left out the hot chocolate and beer because I didn't have them...other reviews have said the hot chocolate mix tames the spices a bit.  It was also a bit watery for me - and I even added an additional can of black beans because I had them.  All in all- not quite perfect for me, but I liked the spice mix.

Great recipe!  The only thing I did different was to add two habaneros. We like things very spicy. Has great flavor in addition to the heat. This is going to be my go to recipe in my school's annual chili cook-off.

Wow best Chili I have ever made and had, my husband said it was the best he's had. After cooking the turkey and  veggies I put it in the slow cooker for 5 hours adding the tobacco and corn in the last hour. Wow it was good cant wait to have leftovers today.

I've made this so many times I've lost count. It's a great recipe. I made a few changes some might find appealing. 1) I substitute two 10-oz cans of habenero green chile tomatoes instead of the regular tomatoes and omit the habenero pepper. I reserve the liquid in case it needs some later. 2) I omit the corn and add one 15.5 oz can of white hominy when I add the beans. 3) I omit the seasoned salt. 4) I cut back just a bit on the liquid smoke.  
If it's a bit too watery, I make a small cornstarch/water slurry and add it to the chile.   Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this recipe for a chili cook-off and won 1st prize!  The only change I made was to substitute 2 discs of Mexican Chocolate for the hot coco & WOW!  The most amazing flavor combination.  I'm making it for another chili cook off next month & I hope it at least places in the top 3!

Made this for Super Bowl and it went over amazingly!!! I made a double batch and it fit perfectly in a 6.75 qt French oven. Looking forward to making this many more times! It was also a great alternative to ground beef tacos!

This chili is so delicious!!!  I left out the habanero and it was perfect!  I was skeptical about the hot chocolate mix, but it turned out great.  I ended up only putting in about one pound of turkey.  It had plenty of meat and my pot was getting full.  I will definitely be making this again!!!!

We didn't have the liquid smoke but otherwise followed the recipe. It wasn't for us, we didn't like the chocolate taste, it was very different.

This was fantastic. I do not usually like chili and I love this, as did my husband. Only changes: omitted hot sauce and decreased red pepper flakes to 1 1/2 tsp (it's still HOT!). OH, and I cut the cumin WAYYY down b/c it is the reason I usually hate chili. :) Did one red and one green pepper. It is so good, will save this one for the future!

LOVE this recipe!  I've made it three times already!  Only difference is instead of the habanero I'm using hot peppers that I harvested and dried from the garden!  I let them simmer in the sauce and remove just before serving.  With this recipe I'll be sure to make good use of those peppers all winter!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I alter it by using ingredients with more spices , add jalapeno & anaheim peppers, and use good beer.

Delicious!  I made this on a camping trip to Mt. Lassen.  It was a hit, and helped us stay warm on the 35 degree nights.  Adding this to my recipe arsenal.  Thanks!

This is amazing chili!!  I'd give it more stars if I could.  I'd put this up against my husband's chili any day.  Very spicy, but you don't just taste the heat, it has spectacular flavor.  I made it exactly as written.  Definitely doing this one whenver I want to make chili.

Holy smokes! This was HOT!!! The thermometer reached the upper 50's today (brrr!). This chili was perfect cool weather food. :) I like spice but this is too hot for my liking (on the contrary, my fiance thinks this is mild...). This isn't "ouch" hot... there are just too many spicy layers going on, ea. building on the other, leaving you with a VERY spicy afterbite. My mom sometimes served her chili over pasta with a dollop of sour cream or ricotta cheese (to tame the heat). I have enjoyed chili this way ever since and sometimes serve mine the same way to change things up a bit every now and then. Tonight, I served my chili on top of whole wheat penne with a dollop of goat cheese (don't knock it till ya try it - strange as it may seem, it's deeelicious!). My fiance ate his chili plain. I got the "man of the house" approval to make this again sans the beans / corn. My fiance isn't a fan of beans (and his hatred of them is getting worse...) and thought the corn was out of place. I give kudos to Jim for finding an ingenous way to incorporate healthy ingredients in a manner that masks, well... their healthiness lol! You cannot detect in the least that this is made with turkey! Thanks for sharing your recipe, JIMBOLYA. Unfortunately, I won't be making this for my parents as planned (this would be perfect for my dad's heart-restrictive diet, but the spice factor would give his intestines a run for their money haha!). Oh well! I hope this is a keeper for you. :-)

This is my favorite chili recipe to make.  I love that it is slightly sweet and just spicy enough.  The liquid smoke adds great flavor and the corn adds a nice touch and texture.  This is a keeper and something that makes a great meal year-round.

Excellent recipe!  It has the perfect amount of spice.  The spice combination is pretty much perfect.    I gave it four stars because I didn't feel like the recipe had enough vegetables for the amount of meat.  Next time I will add more.  Probably an red bell pepper, some carrots and celery.

WHOA! it's not called chili for no reason! it was very spicy, which I like, but because of this, I have GERD. It sucks that I can't always have spicy food because of my condition but this is a delicious recipe. I definitely recommend and will make again for my hubby's friends.

this is by far the best chili i have ever made. I made a few changes though. I used smoked paprika to give it a depth of flavor and substitute two jalapenos for the habenero. I top mine with sour cream and make sure i have a cold glass of milk to help calm the heat.

This was absolutely delicious!! I made minor changes. I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us, but I used the entire can of tomato sauce and added an additional small can (soda size) of tomato juice as it was too thick for me. I also threw in some chicken broth, but not much. I also used black beans instead, as that was what I had at home. This was AWESOME!

Very good!  Was a tad spicy for my wife, so if you don't like too much spice may want to cut it back just a little bit.  I thought it was the perfect spice level though, so other than that perfect!!

WOW!!  This recipe definitely lived up to the rave reviews.  I love spicy food but the rest of my family doesn't so I skipped the habanero and just added a little more hot sauce.  I used red pepper instead of green, added a few stalks of celery for extra crunch, used frozen instead of canned corn, and used a mix of dark kidney and black beans. Delicious!  Thank you JIMBOLYA :)

This is by far the best Chili recipe I've ever made. My husband doesn't eat onion, but I just added extra bell pepper, and it was still delicious. Also, I cut some of the spice because I do not like it too spicy, but it was still great. The flavors and textures were delightful.

Thanks JIMBOLYA! Excellent chili! WARNING: It is spicy hot! Next time I'll cut the pepper flakes by 1/2 and no habanero! For those who want HOT! follow Jim's recipe. This is a keeper.

WOW  Followed it to the letter (almost) and this will now be my chili until I have to eat thru a tube!!  So spicy and flavorful!!  I added a 3rd can of tomatoes, 1 1/2 teaspoons of liquid smoke instead of 1, and added 2 jalepenos--one chopped and one whole.  Turkey took more like 10 min to brown but no big deal.  Also used Tony Chacheres creole seasoning in place of season salt.  Really, the reviews arent wrong on this one.   I spent nearly $30 to get all the ingredients...but now that I have the base, can make this for under $10.    Thank you Jimbolya, but from now on, This is Creflo's Chili!! :)

I made this last night and it was awesome!   I ended up not adding the red pepper flakes (forgot to buy them) and substituting two seeded and chopped jalape√±os for the haba√±ero. I also used a large can of corn as well as a full bottle of beer. The end result was a little more mild than we would have liked (both my boyfriend and I love the spice) but it was still extremely tasty. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Even the chili fanatics that I know love this recipe.  Reletively easy to make.  Frozen corn definately.  I like to add in extra beans, usually black or pinto.  Pabst blue ribbon is my favorate beer to use in this recipe.  It's a bit to spicy for some so I like to leave out the hot sauce at the end and just let people add it to their taste.  I forgot to get the diced tomatoes with the green chilis once.  Ooops!  Still turned out fabulous.  This is chili cookoff winning stuff here.

This chili is DELICIOUS and has become a regular staple in my house. I use a combination of ground turkey and lean ground beef, and add extra tomato sauce because it turns out pretty thick otherwise. It's still great if you don't add the extra sauce. I just prefer my chili to be slightly soupy. Make it. You'll love it!!

As good as they say! I had to do a lot of substituting because I didn't have the ingredients but it was still great.  Used about a quarter cup of mini chocolate chips, left out the green pepper, used tomato paste instead of sauce and simmered for just 30 minutes because i was so anxious to eat it. I'll do it again and follow the directions but it  was fool proof even with lots of substitutions.

The best chili!  Flavorful, some heat, and very rich!  I use navy or great northern beans (2 cans drained) and sometimes add a sprinkle of cayenne for extra heat.  Sometimes I also add crushed tomatoes in addition to what is called for.  I use habanero flavor tabasco sauce at the end.  Yummy!

This chili isn't just for the boys! This girl thinks it is delicious. I made very minor "changes". I used red and green pepper instead of just green. I also used a few jalapenos instead of habanero (store didn't have them) and the result was plenty spicy. Oh, and I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of tomatoes with chiles. So no real significant changes. It was spicy, but not the kind of hot that is hard to eat. The first time I made it, the chili got really dry. So the second time I took a small glass of water and put the seasoning in it, then dumped in the seasoned water. I didn't drain the tomatoes, and I added a little more beer. I thought the consistency was perfect! Not too dry and definitely not too soupy. I'm surprised that people got soupy chili with the original recipe. Anyway, we will be making this a lot, and I can't wait to share it with my friends! Anything I make twice in one week deserves 5 stars!

My tweaking made this perfect for our family. I omitted anything spicy (peppers, red pepper flakes, hot pepper sauce), used diced tomatoes without chiles, ground beef instead of turkey, and 1/2 Tbsp of the chili powder, paprika, cumin, seasoned salt.  I used only a pinch of pepper.  I also used almost the entire can of beer.  To offset this, I added about a teaspoon or 2 of sugar.  At the end, I stirred in one carton of plain yogurt.  Everyone thought it was really good.

So after looking up this reciepie for the upteenth time to make it, I  decided it time to write a reivew. This recipie is now the only chili I will cook. My boyfriend thinks I am the best cook in world after making this. My friends think i should enter it in a chili cook off. Anyway - I felt guilty always making this and not reviewing it and paying my complements to the chef. I only change a few things -   Use a red and green pepper Use red and white kidney beans More garlic and add it with the corn so the garilc falvor doesnt cook off Add a 1/2 cup red wine when boiling 3 fresh tomatoes cut up 1 can fire roasted tomatoes instead of one of the diced can tomatoes with the chilies

First, I gave it four stars because I didn't make it exactly as-is.  I adapted it according to the ingredients I had on hand.  I left out the peppers, cumin, liquid smoke and hot pepper sauce.  I substituted the turkey for beef, Worcestershire sauce for steak sauce, and the tomato sauce for tomato paste, but added more beer.  The result was delicious!  I let it refrigerate overnight, which I think helped the flavors blend together and keep the corn from tasting like, well, corn.  The hubby raved, and he doesn't usually have much to say about my cooking.  Will definitely use this (adapted) recipe again!

Great taste!  I haven't had a bowl yet, but took a few tastes after I finished making it last night, and I am very excited about eating it tonight.  It has just the right amount of spice that I was looking for.   MODIFICATIONS: Didn't add green peppers - I don't like them Used half of the hot pepper sauce - chili still had some good kick to it.

i made this exact except for used 2 jalepeno peppers, no habanero on hand. I will make it again! So delicious, I ended up adding more tomatoes and sauce when i reheated (some family members said it needed to be a bit milder) still superb!

Very flexible recipe with a fantastic base mixture of flavor!!!  I always change a bit here and there to alter hotness or because I don't always measure precisely, but the core flavor is always great!  Added to my recipe box today!

This is a really decent chili recipe. I thought it needed more acid so I added some vinegar and a little extra beer. I also added roasted (broiled in the oven) tomatoes because I thought it was lacking the authentic chili taste that comes with roasted tomatoes. The hot cocoa mix is an excellent idea (like a mole sauce) but I don't think it adds enough deepness to the sauce so I also added a 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I'll do this again for sure and will probably fiddle with it.

I live in France, so we dont have liquid smoke, habenero peppers, hot chocolate mix, or tomatoes with chilis, and chili powder is hard to find. I made chili powder by mixing garlic powder, paprika, oregano, and cayenne pepper. I used just canned stewed tomatoes and a jalepeno pepper. I added cocoa powder and sugar to sub for the hot chocolate mix. I was going to add red wine, but the beer idea was too interesting to pass up. I don't know if this is right or wrong, but with any chili recipe I try, I just use whatever meat I have in the freezer, this time sausages and ground beef.

I won the Church Chili Cook-off today with this recipe!  I made three changes...I replaced the habanero with a jalepeno, I used black beans instead of kidneys and I ommitted the cumin - personal thing.  And most importantly my husband loved it!

I've made this recipe three times now.  First time I made it per the recipe except that I had to substitute diced jalapenos for the habanero and I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp.  We liked it but it wasn't quite right.  Second time I used frozen cut peppers and onions and the moisture from those made the ground turkey crumble pretty much on its own - talk about a time saver! Instead of the habanero AND the tomato sauce I used a 16 oz jar of P@ce salsa verde and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (no chilis).  I used a whole can of corn and two cans of beans and in place of the ground black pepper I used white pepper.  I also subbed the paprika for smoked paprika.  Now THAT was the trick!  My guys (38, 12 and 4) LOVED it!    Making it again according to my second try to take to a potluck and also some extra to freeze.  Can't wait to see what everyone thinks!

I made this Chili for a Chili Cook-off at work and got 2ns place!  It's awesome, very spicy and also very colorful, which I think makes for a better eating experience.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

This chili is delicious.  I didn't have hot chocolate powder so I used some Hershey Kisses as another reviewer suggested.  Definitely taste as you add them so you don't add too many.  Tastes great with Baked Tostitos for a low fat meal that's high in protein.

I loved this!! The only thing I kept out was the beer (beer's for my belly, not my chili!), the habenero and the hot sauce. The habenero I left out because that'd be too hot for hubby, although I'd like the hotness. I left out the hot sauce because I find that it makes dishes bitter tasting.  This is a keeper!

This chili is soooo good!!!  Granted you had better like it spicy!  I did add a large can of tomato sauce to the recipe and an extra can of chili beans - and I cut the turkey back to 1.3 lbs.  This was delicious!!!

While I'm a big fan of the "Chili Rick's" recipe on this website and won a chili cookoff using that recipe, that's not a chili that you want to make too often seeing as it is totally unhealthy and fatty. So I gave this one a try so that I can have a more sensible option and I was not disappointed!!! I followed everything except I omitted the corn. I did find that it was VERY thick so I threw in an extra 15oz can of tomato sauce at the end. It's not a huge batch so it didn't last long, but it is certainly guilt free.

SOOOOOO GOOOOD!

First suggestion--double the recipe.  We loved it so much, there was not enough left for left-overs for 3. 

I only changed 2 things.  First I added two packets of hot chocolate.  Secondly, I used frozen corn and only added it in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  We all agreed that the corn really didn't add much to the flavor, so you could omit it.

Note of caution--as always, wear food gloves when working with habaneros.

Absolute chili! Hubby's likes chili and always the one who cooks. But when I found this recipe and cooked it, he refused to cook anymore and let me make this all the time. I put our fav vege, yellow zucchini. Yumm. Thanks so much!

I just made this last night for a chili cook off and I WON :)!! I did modify it a bit -- added some low fat turkey sausage, garlic, more beans and a bit of sour cream... everyone LOVED it. Really spicy!! ALSO -- this was my first time cooking with habanero peppers....OOUCH!! I touched my face and my skin was burning the rest of the night!!!

I have been using the same old same old chili recipe forever and I wanted to try something new; boy this was a GREAT choice!  I had all intentions of using turkey but the store was out of ground turkey so I used ground beef.  I did only make half of this recipe but I did use the entire can of beans and tomato sauce.  They also had no habanero peppers so I subbed 2 jalapeno pepppers leaving the seeds in one of them.  The only thing I am not so sure I really liked was the liquid smoke so I may leave it out next time so I can compare.**REVISED** 10-31-08  Ate this as leftovers and didn't mind the liquid smoke nearly as much.  I think in the future I will make this a day ahead of time.

We. Love. This. Chili.

I always make it in the crockpot. I brown the meat, and then throw all the ingredients into the crockpot on low for about eight hours. I have never used habanero. Once I used jalapeno, and it was still pretty spicy. Now, I make it either with or without jalapeno, depending on my mood.

Last time, I didn't have any beer, and so put in the equivalent amount of water. Still tasty. It's a fantastic, easy, healthy chili that I recommend to everyone.

I never should have waited this long to rate this. It is far and away the best chili recipe I have ever tried and I'm celebrated every time I make it. I don't use the habanero pepper and occasionally omit the beer if I haven't any (but its so much better when I do). Otherwise, I follow it precisely and its mmmmmmmazing.

Great flavor and so easy to make.  I had most of the ingredients on hand and was looking for another use for ground turkey.  Definitely wouldn't know it's turkey.  I used less than half the amount of red pepper flakes and the result was still fairly spicy.  I like a little "kick" but not too much so it was just right.  I might try using a bit of dark chocolate or unsweetened cocoa powder instead of the cocoa mix next time which made it a little sweet.

I recently moved out to the country and a friend gave us some ground Elk, what to do with it? I added the Elk and Turkey and didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and beans and tomatoes with green chili's and jalapeno's. It turned out pretty hot, but absolutely delicious.

Excellent, what more can I say?  Used smoked paprika instead of regular, added some chipotle seasoning, and used a large can of Rotel.  Also added a small can of tomato paste for extra richness.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  Yum, Yum, Yum.

HOLY MARY MOTHER OF HEAVEN.  Thank you so much for sharing this heavenly dish!!  I made this for my family of four and the only disappointment was that there wasn't that much left for the next night!  I'll definitely double the ingredients for next time.

Fantastic!  I've made this a few times already, once with beef, and I have to say I actually prefer it with turkey.  I always halve the recipe but keep the whole can of beans; otherwise I follow the recipe to a T and it comes out perfectly seasoned and spicy every time.

WOW, WOW, WOW... And did i mention WOW. I used a jalape√±o pepper because the local grocery was out of habaneros and i simmered it in a crock pot on low for 5 hours and then added corn and hot sauce for an additional hour.  I would also recommend using the green Tabasco sauce with this recipe because the flavors compliment each other so well.  THANKS JIM

This was pretty good, but not as hot as I would have assumed it to be.  I used 1.35 lbs ground turkey, so added a can of black beans, and used a whole can of corn.  I did not add the 1 Tbs of hot sauce at the end.  It was good & the hot chocolate does cut down on the sweetness, but I was surprised that all people that tried it said it was sweet, not hot.  It had a good taste, but not what I was going for since I was entering a hot category in a chili cookoff!

A note to pepper virgins:  wear gloves when dealing w/ a habanero pepper or you will literally burn your fingertips.  Learn from my mistake :)

This was the best chili I've ever made!!  It was a little 'hot' for the kids, but my husband and I LOVED it!  It's definately a keeper!  I made a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand and personal preference.  I used some little red hot pepper we grew in our garden, left out the beer and corn, and reduced the red pepper flakes a little.  I added another can of beans and tomatoes (big family to feed).  The fun part was having the kids guess, after dinner was over, what the 'secret ingredient' was......of course they had no idea it was Hot Chocolate!!  Delicious, we can't wait to try it again, and again, and again!!!  I highly recommend it.

A great chili recipe! I made a few changed based on what I had on hand. I used ground beef instead of turkey, and since I only had 1.25lb of beef I added an extra can of (pinto) beans. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Almost made one inadvertant addition...but I remembered to picked the marshmallows out of the cocoa mix before I added it! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

YUM!!!  Agreed, turkey is a wonderful foil for beef.  Cocoa powder substitutes nicely for the mix, and various dried peppers can pinch hit for the fresh hot ones.  Thanks!  This is a keeper.

I made this chili for a cook-off we were having at work and came in first place in the hot category.  Everyone that has tried this chili loves it.  I changed a couple of minor things but overall great recipe.

Really good! Subbed large jalape√±o pepper for habanero and only used 1 tsp red pepper flakes and did NOT add hot sauce and it was plenty of heat for me. I expect it to taste even better the next day!

I never follow receipts exactly (unless it's baking which is more science), I found this one a good base to use. I added Sizzlin' Cilantro Spice Mix from (Cup n Kettle in Leavenworth WA, they ship),  Smoked Paprika, two large Pablono's, 2 Jalapenos (1 half of pepper with seeds), a couple large carrots, 1 very large Red Bell Pepper, even amounts of Coriander and Cumin, no Hot Chocolate, although I could see adding a 1/8 tsp of unsweetened chocolate. I also used raw beans which I cooked first in my Mexican Clay Bean Pot with left over liquid, best way to cook beans.

This is the best recipe! I don't use the liquid smoke and often use 3 jalape√±os instead of the habanero because that is what is available.

I was intrigued by this recipe because I always add unsweetened cocoa powder to my chili con carne. I used the hot chocolate mix in this one wondering how the sugar would affect the taste. It was excellent. I was making this for a small group so I didn't add super hot peppers, but I did add about three roasted Anaheim chilis that weren't quite as hot as jalapeno or habanero. I didn't add hot sauce, but I did add a tsp. of cumin. I also used one lb. of ground turkey and one lb. of ground chuck, knowing that some people don't like the taste of ground turkey. I plan to make it again sticking closely to the recipe. It was excellent and I really didn't modify the recipe all that much. It's unfair to review recipes that we totally change up, so I want to be clear that my modifications were mostly to cut down on the spiciness, and not take a chance on solely using turkey for the meat.

Loved this recipe!   I did make minor changes due to what I had on hand.  Used a can of mild chili beans instead of kidney beans.  Used fresh cooked corn instead of canned.  Didn't drain the cans of chopped tomatoes.  Omitted the tablespoon of hot sauce because  it was just the right amount of spice for me without it.  Will definitely make this my go to chili recipe in the future.

Very good combination of flavors; more robust than other turkey chilis.  I did make some simple subs - cannot have beer/gluten so used a little vermouth and chicken broth.  Don't have hot chocolate packets so subbed a little less full fat Penzey's cocoa.   I also downsized the heat, easy to do.  Great recipe, thank you!  Has a lot going for it.

My daughter and her husband liked this and we like hot, spicy but only need 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, not 2.
I used 2 cans of beans not 1

I think this would be good with 1 pound of turkey instead of 2

I used 2 cups of frozen corn to 1 cup of canned

I used plain diced tomatoes instead of tomatoes with a chili pepper

I added a jalapeno pepper

I skipped the hot chocolate mix

I skipped the beer

0.50 of red pepper flakes

2.0 beans

Fantastic. We swapped the habanero for jalapeno and kept the rest identical. The flavor is insane and the warmth is slow and comforting. LOVE IT!

Best chili I‚Äôve ever made. A friend from out west came over and we cooked this for him. He was blown away, he‚Äôs entered competitions before and swore by his recipe. He only cooks with this one now!

I‚Äôve made this chili several times now, and it is always a huge hit.  I‚Äôve made substitutions and used ground beef instead of turkey, I‚Äôve made it exactly as directed, and it‚Äôs awesome every time.  It is spicy, but add a little cheese or sour cream and some cornbread, and this is a winner!

I have been making this for years.  The only thing that I don't really like is that sometimes it's watery.  I reduce it when its complete to remove the excess moisture.  I also have never made it on the stove.  Always in the crockpot.

Hot, hot, hot the way it is written, and if you enjoy the heat, you‚Äôll love it as written. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit less heat and a great tasting chili, try omitting a few ingredients. I‚Äôve made it both ways and the compliments came immediately either way. Yesterday‚Äôs version omitted the habanero pepper, the red pepper flakes and the hot pepper sauce. I used original recipe Rotel diced tomatoes (which is spicier than the other brands with green chilis). Served at table with a bottle of Franks Red Hot, a bowl of sour cream and some grated sharp cheddar cheese, it couldn‚Äôt have been more delicious. Nice heat, but not overwhelming. This is a great recipe.

The only change I made was adding more corn (and that was by mistake -- I added about 1.5 cups instead of 0.5 cups). Good stuff.

This was a great spicy chili!  I didn't add the habanero pepper because I knew it would be too spicy for us.  A few modifications that I did for how we like our chili.  I only used 1 lb. of meat per the full recipe, doubled the tomato sauce, and added about 1 cup of water, since we like our chili a little soupier.  I was using my instant pot for this, so I went ahead and pressure cooked it for around 35 minutes, then simmered a few more minutes with the lid off.  But this would be great to simmer on the stove for several hours to develop that deep flavor.  Even without the habanero, it had a great spice to it and we garnished our bowls with a dollop of sour cream and some parsley.  I served corn bread muffins on the side and this made a delicious meal!  Thank you for the great chili recipe!  It was a nice change from our usual!

We reduced the number of habanero peppers to tame it a bit and did a 3x recipe.  Went over well with a crowd.  Adding sour cream or cream cheese helped.

My go-to for years now. Sometimes I use ground turkey, sometimes ground beef (brown and drain beforehand) and both are great. I usually only use a little (like 1/4 tsp) red pepper flakes and leave out any jalapeno if I'm making it for the family, which includes kids who don't like spicy. I also leave out corn-just not our thing. Big hit in our house. We eat it over spaghetti noodles with some sharp cheddar, sour cream and oyster crackers. Fiance is a big chili fan and even won a local cookoff in Green Bay  (with his own recipe..although maybe I'll need to challenge him next time ;), so he knows his chili, and he LOVES this. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is now my go-to chili recipe, minus the habanero pepper.  It's flavorful and healthy.  I use Legacy ground turkey (from the frozen section at Whole Foods), perfect for this recipe and for convenience.

The smoky hot flavor was a big hit with my husband and six friends. Of course the touch of chocolate didn't  hurt it's popularity with my women friends ??. I will make this again for Super Bowl Sunday. Rise Up Falcons !!!

I'm no fan of turkey.  I think it's the worst of all meats, especially cold and slimy on a deli sandwich.  However, this recipe taught me to love it.  I'm not really a fan of barbecued flavor stuff or paprika in general.  But this chili is divine.  Use some smoky paprika, and you get sweet and smoky chili with a slightly barbecue flavor.  It's the best new chili I've made since beanless standard beef chili seasoned with oregano and cumin but with sweet potatoes added (which I don't typically care for either).  Since trying this, I opted to make some paleo minestrone but with substituting ground beef and beef broth with ground turkey and chicken broth, and it's even better than with the beef.  If you're no fan of turkey but a fan of chili, this chili will let you respect America's favorite bird again.

Great!  First time I made this and followed recipe almost exactly with a couple of exceptions.  I didn't have habanero so used jalape√±o, only had a red pepper instead of green, added a can of northern beans and instead of hot coco mix used pure cocoa. Turned out yummy and spicy as I hoped.  Will definitely make again!!  Thanks

Fantastic! My boyfriend was skeptical because, in his words, "I have never had a good chili that took less than 4-5 hours to make." He loved it so much that he wanted 4th's before running out of room, and then we had it again two days later. I only used half of a habanero, and we thought that that or maybe a little bit more (like 2/3?) would have been perfect. Loved it though!

So good. I add more beans and use beef but otherwise everything else is spot on. I have made a big mixed batch of the dry ingredients and use that every time I make this. Favourite dish at potlucks all the time!

Loved it!!!! Best Chile I've ever tasted and made.  Only addition added was a bottle of the Heinz 57 Chile Sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  Have with a bottle of Bordeaux and your good to go!

Great chili recipe as written.  Can't really understand why anyone would find it watery...there's only 1/3 cup of liquid added to it.  I generally just eyeball the amount of beer I put in and I don't drain the tomatoes.  Love this stuff!

Excellent Recipe!  Just made a few minor changes ~ used 1 jalape√±o pepper instead the Habanero as I was making this for a family gathering.  In addition, I used 1 can red, and 1 can of white kidney beans.  Also, I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I used smoked paprika.  I will definitely be making this again!

So I make a lot of chili and am always trying different recipes.  This is now my go to recipe and its the only one I make.  however there is one HUGE change that I made that takes this recipe way up.  The submitter states to add one half can "cheap beer" .  Beer like any ingredient is different by the quality.  I first used any old American light beer and it was okay.  I then started experimenting with other beers and was blown away with the difference it made.  

My favorite to use is a Samuels Smith Stout.  I find Stouts add to the complexity.  I invite the submitter to try it this way side by side with a coors light or whatever he is using and see the difference it makes.  If you can find it and you want even more heat you can add a few ounces of "Billys Chili" beer.  It is pepper infused and about 3 ounces is all you need of it.

Love this. The heat is perfect, though I like to use two medium spiced chilis instead of the habanero. If you're lactose intolerant, you can substitute 2 tablespoons cocoa powder and a bit of honey for the hot cocoa mix.

We are addicted to this chili!  We can't go more than a couple of weeks without making it.  We use Serrano pepper instead of the habanero, it is not quite as hot. Regardless of which one you use it has quite a kick so if you not a spicy lover you may want to consider using a bit less of the red pepper flakes, pepper sauce, and use a jalape√±o pepper instead of the habanero or Serrano.  This would definitely make a great superpower chili as well!  Enjoy!

I have made this twice now and it is delicious. The first time I prepared it almost EXACTLY as specified (I accidentally forgot the hot pepper sauce at the end and substituted yellow bell pepper for the corn as a way to incorporate more nutrients and keep out what gives nothing but a starch with no positive nutritional payoff). The second time I used beef instead of turkey, I remembered the hot pepper sauce at the end and subbed a yellow AND orange bell pepper for the corn. I seriously don't see how one can possibly go wrong with this recipe. My only complaint? It takes for blessed ever to prepare and make (maybe I'm a slow chopper??). Nonetheless, I'm hooked. Not sure why I would ever need another chili recipe when I love this one so much. I noticed many choices in SIZE of habanero pepper so although I loved the medium heat that I got by choosing a small sized pepper, I would be open to going for a medium to large sized one; there is such great flavor that I doubt more heat would diminish that fact. LOVE LOVE LOVE this chili. I recommend trying it!!

I made this recipe following the directions completely. I personally found this to be an extremely hot Chili recipe, and I think I like my Chili a bit spicier than most of my friends and family do.   As the creator states, "this chili recipe is guaranteed to satisfy even the most sadistic spicy food lover..." I would have to agree with them, as my mouth was on fire, in a good way, just overly so.  I happened to have made It's Chili by George!! on the same day; I found that recipe to be way too sweet for my tastes. So in order to salvage both Chili recipes, I tried the two mixed together. Turned out to be a really tasty, spicy Chili! Since that day, I have made the two recipes again, but modified the directions slightly in order to be able to make them in one large pot. Guess I will have to try making this one again and maybe use  Cayenne or Tabasco peppers  instead of using the Habanero. That way my family can have a chance at enjoying this recipe. Thank you JIMBOLYA for a recipe that can definitely be called "Smokin'", as this is not one for the faint of taste bud as written. I will definitely try making this again, just tamed down a bit. Thanks

Love this recipe.  It's my go-to.  I add lots of extra beans and if I don't have hot chocolate, I toss in a small handful of bittersweet chocolate chips.  Always fabulous.

I have prepared this chili a bunch  times, and it never fails to get rave responses from my family and guests. It is chock-full of robust flavors! The beer and the chocolate are the "secret" ingredients in this winner. Around the 5th time I cooked it, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Good God Almighty!!

I've got a pot going right now, and I'm excited to taste it when it's done! I made these changes:  instead of  a habanero (not sold at my store), I bought a package of various "hot" peppers, which contained some red chilis and jalapenos, as well as some light yellow-colored peppers that might have been either a "yellow caribe" or a "hungarian wax" according to the package - I'm still not 100% sure which they were... but since they were relatively mild, I used two of them, one jalapeno and two of the red chilis, and only one green bell pepper. I used 1.5 lbs of turkey and added a can of cannellini beans. I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 T instead of 2 T because my bf won't like it if it's *too* hot. I was skeptical about using "milk chocolate" flavored hot cocoa mix (the only kind I could find that didn't have marshmallows) so I only used a dash of it, and then put in 2 t of unsweetened cocoa powder/baking chocolate, and a couple of dark hershey kisses. After adding the herbs and spices, before adding the tomatoes and beans, I put in about 1 T of tomato paste for about 1 minute, then added about 1/3 to 1/2 of a yuengling.  As other reviewers suggested,  I didn't drain the diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato sauce.  Right now, it seems kind of "wet."I hope that some of the liquid either cooks off, and/or that adding the corn will work it out. I also will probably only add a dash of hot sauce to my own personal bowl, again, since my bf doesn't tolerate as much spice. I am

I made this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't love was that most of the liquid was absorbed, which made for a very hearty chili. But regardless, I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I do not make any changes to this recipe, and it is my go-to chili recipe.  I make a double batch every year for the neighborhood Halloween party, and it gets rave reviews (better than the beef chili!).   Turkey needs a LOT of help, and it gets that help here.  You would never know that this is a turkey chili.  I think the secret ingredient is the hot cocoa mix.  And I do use the habanero pepper.  Absolutely highly recommended!!  Enjoy!  It's a truly brilliant recipe.

I can not eat chili this hot, but this recipe is the perfect basis for making any chili ever. Onion, garlic and bell for depth, the cocoa for richness and sweet, and alcohol for rendering flavor. I usually half the chili powder and skip the red pepper flakes. It still packs heat with flavor to back it up.

Hands down best chili, every time, even if you swap the type of meat or beans. I think you could throw an old boot in it, and it would still be good.

Made it with most ingredients (w/out the beer) and it was very good.  I would say one of the best ever...but I also do not like really hot spicy so I put in less of those ingredients.  The nice thing is that with Chilli you can spice it the way you like it.  I would make this again.

This is the chili I always make and it's always a huge hit every time I make it I do something different but the main point is the beer, hot chocolate, and habanero pepper. Those are the keys one time I used a ghost pepper and it came out just as good will more of a kick! Love this chili!

This is my go to chili recipe - has phenomenal flavor and I always get tons of compliments!  As is this recipe is very spicy, I usually cut down on some of the spices so it will be more kid friendly and the flavor does not suffer at all.  It's perfect with some sour cream and cheddar on top!

This is the holy grail of chili recipes! DELICIOUS chili with a wonderful, complex depth of flavor. I used jarred sliced jalapenos that I diced up and two cans of RoTel tomatoes with green chilies, two cans of beans because I'm a bean lover and 1/2 tsp smoked paprika in place of the liquid smoke. I also used Hersheys unsweetened cocoa powder(1 oz.) in place of the hot cocoa mix and a little bit of sugar.  Next time I make this recipe I will add more cocoa, maybe by half, and see what happens. I do see how the cocoa augments the flavors but I think I could've used a little more. Thank you Jimbolya! Excellent recipe that I will make again and again.

I like that it didn't have as much fat.  Too many canned ingredients so the flavor wasn't that intense. Seems like it was missing something.

I added Negra Modelo for my beer. It was perfect! As an ingredient and as beverage! It served as a delicious match!
This was full flavor with a bit of spice at first taste, then an extra pop of spice hits you. I am not a huge fan of spicy food, but my husband is, however this is perfect for it to be a favorite of both of ours now! I didn't even tell him it was turkey!

Made exact to recipe with the exception of a jalapeno instead of habanero as they didn't have it at my market. Lucky me! I gave five stars because it was awesome turkey chili and it's called smokin' for a reason but It was a bit too smokin' for me although I ate it all(way too spicy for my hubby). I think maybe if I use one can with green chili and one without or cut back the red pepper flakes it would be better for us. Really though, Best Chili EVER! Try sprinkling a shredded cheese blend over the top with a nice dollop of sour cream, YUM!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count over the years, and it remains a huge favourite in my house. I don't modify it much; sometimes I leave out the beer, if I don't have any on hand, and I substitute the kidney beans for black beans (unfortunately my other half doesn't like kidney beans). I love it the way it is. However I think this recipe would be a cinch to modify to your tastes. I think I'll try adding more veggies and less meat next time!

Followed the recipe except for these changes: heaping measurements of spices; added extra beer and liquid smoke and worcestershire sauce; used nesquick "less sugar" variety chocolate milk powder to taste instead of instant hot cocoa since that's all I had at home; used less red chili pepper flakes; omitted hot sauce at the end. Love the ratio of turkey meat to beans. Enjoyed the sweetness of the corn in there. The flavors are complex and layered. The cheese, sour cream and scallions juxtapose the heat from the chili. My husband does not love super spicy foods like I do, but he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. A hearty, relatively healthy chili that will remain in my rotation. I can't wait to taste it tomorrow again!

I use jalape√±o instead of habanero because I'm a big chicken.  But this chili is my favorite!  I love to add other spices like nutmeg and ground cloves, and let all the spices cook a little with the meat and vegetables, before adding the liquids and tomatoes.  I've made it quite a few times this winter, as we have had so much snow.  Great recipe for hibernating by a cozy fire.

Spicey, even without adding a habanero pepper. I had to add a 48 oz jar of Prego because there wasn't any liquid in the dish at all. If you want to eliminate the sodium used in the canned tomatoes and corn, there was appx 2.5 cups of chopped tomatoes after draining the liquid. For the corn, you could use frozen instead of canned. I'm on the fence with this recipe, since I feel like I didn't experience the full flavour since I had to add so much Prego. Update: The next day, this was very good with the changes I described above. So, I'm giving this 3 stars for the original recipe and 5 stars with the changes I made to salvage the original 3 star recipe

This had so much flavor, I was so impressed that turkey could be this flavorful in Chili. My husband was so ecstatic when he tasted it and also found out I used turkey. So awesome, Thank you so much!

Wow!!  This chili was delicious with the right amount of heat and taste. I have never felt compelled to rate a recipe before until this one. Definitely will make this again!  The only change I made was to use a jalape√±o pepper instead of the habanero, only because I had it on hand.

This is my new 'go to' chili recipe. My 11 year old picky eater even liked it! The only change I made was to omit the hot peppers and half the 'hot' spices as we don't all like heat in our food in this house. I still added all the spices, I just tempered it to suit all taste buds. I loved the addition of liquid smoke and beer, in my opinion it made this recipe.

All I omitted was the liquid smoke because I didn't have it.  This recipe makes the best chili I've had in a very long time.  I will definitely be making this again.  And yes, use the hot chocolate mix.  I can't imagine the taste without it.

Vegetarian Version:  Used a meat sub, though would be fine without this, just add more of your bean of choice.
For the non-"sadistic spicy food lover" version:  halve the red pepper flakes and chili powder, omit the habanero/jalapeno and hot pepper. It was still very spicy to me.
Didn't have liquid smoke, used "Gravy Master"
Quite a lot of flavor!

This is one of my favorite allrecipes recipes. Fast, easy, and most importantly awesomely tasty!

I do like making a few modifications though. First, I use two habaneros and leave one whole. It still isn't terribly spicy like that, but I think it's nice. I also like adding a cup of chopped mushrooms (sautee them with the onion). For the meat I don't usually have ground turkey, but I find 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound finely chopped boneless skinless chicken thighs are a really good alternative.

Finally, I like to top it with a bit of cheddar and some plain greek yogurt (which I use as a healthy substitute for sour cream). Overall, I definitely recommend you try this recipe!

This chili will definitely have you breathin' fire. I cut back on some of the spices and it was still plenty hot. Next time I will omit the habanero pepper all together. It does have excellent flavor and the choc. mix is a must.

Just finished eating this after letting it simmer for a few hours. Hubby loved it, nice spice and the chocolate is that secret ingredient that made the finish so smooth. Followed the recipe very closely, did 1/2 habenero, 1/2 jalape√±o and used Guiness beer instead of 'cheap'' since I didn't have any.. Thanks for the great recipe, even my 10yr old loved it!

Best chili ever! I have to tone it down a bit for most of my family so I substitute two jalapenos for the habanero. Other than that I did not change a thing.

The cocoa is such a great idea!  I added two cans of tomato sauce and it was much better.  I used a jalapeno instead of a habanero and it was delicious (still spicy but not horrible).  Frank's RedHot was great in it.  I used every spice it called for and the flavor was perfect.

I must have tried a zillion chili recipes but NONE have amazed me as much as this one!!! I am tossing all others aside and THIS will be my new secret weapon and go to for ALL pot lucks, gatherings and ANYTIME comfort cravings! It's loaded with big time flavor and yet so basic on the ingredients! I LOVE it hot so spice it up as little or as much as you can hang... I added Flaming Hot Fritos for a killer crunch along with good chedder cheese, green onions and of course sour cream.... mmmmmm TY TY TY who ever posted this FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!

Wow!! This is absolutely amazing! Hands down the best chili recipe I've come across. I did make a few changes. I omitted the habanero peppers and the tomato sauce. I also only used 11 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with chiles rather the 14.5 oz. cans. The heat is perfect! Not overpowering; allows you to enjoy all the flavor here! We Loved it!
I served this over pasta with sour cream, cheddar cheese and frito scoops. So good! Also good the next day! Will do again!

Really delicious. I cut back a little on the heat, because I wasn,t sure how much my guests could take. Only used 1 Tbs of red chile flakes, 2 small jalopenos instead of the habernero pepper, and skipped finishing it with the hot pepper sauce. It had enough heat to make us sweat a bit, but didn't overpower. Best chili I've ever had!

Great complex flavors. An excellent chili that excites the palate. My very fussy 13 year old who hates "hot food" even loved it. Better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to mingle.

Wow!  This is really good chili.  I substituted the habenaro with a large poblano pepper in order to reduce the heat and add an earthy element to the flavor profile.  My son has a gluten allergy so I omitted the beer and added two shots of tequila which I believe imparted a wonderful roughness to the background flavors.  I didn't have liquid smoke so I diced and sauted two pieces of bacon with the onions and peppers.  I didn't add the corn.  Served for Christmas lunch to high praise.

Impressive.  I really dislike smoke flavoring and although this was on the verge of being too 'smokey' it turned out really good.  The little bit of sweet was such a nice addition.  I used a Pam in my pan instead of olive oil.  I left out the habenero thinking the kids would be more likely to eat this (which they didn't eat anyway, b/c it was still too spicy) and I had to use salsa instead of tomato sauce as that is all I had.  Next time, I will be sure to have everything chopped and/or measured beforehand b/c I feel like a lot of the liquid was simmered away since it was taking me forever to get everything in the pot.

Loved this but was super spicy and I didn't even add the habanero! Very tasty though, thanks for sharing!

I think this is the best chili I've ever had!!! I thought about substituting the turkey with ground beef but decided to try the turkey.  It was amazing.  I omitted the habenaro peppers and the hot sauce because of my kids.  It had just the right amount of kick with the red pepper flakes so I was not disappointed.  The hint of sweet from the hot chocolate packet was perfect.  Highly recommend this chili on a cold winter day.

This is the best chili I have ever had - period.  I am making it for the company annual chili cook-off and I am very excited to see how I do with it.  The flavors that come out with all of the ingredients are so vibrant.  It is truly wonderful and will be the new recipe in our household from now on.  No more relatively dull chili for us!  Try it if you truly want mouthwatering flavor.

We loved this! I didn't have the hot chocolate mix or liquid smoke so I compensated with some smoked pepper flakes and sriracha sauce, as well as chopped roasted green chile which is local to us in New Mexico.  Taco seasoning is a good substitute for the spices, if needed. I made it a second time using saut√©d tofu instead of ground turkey and it still rocked. I love a recipe that is "tweak-able" and works with variations. Thanks Jimbolya, for a keeper!

Chili was okay, lots of heat but surprisingly bland. Expected much more based on all the fantastic reviews. A lot of ingredients and very involved for a recipe that wasn't better than the chili I already make. Was concerned about the inclusion of "hot chocolate", but (thankfully) you don't taste it at all. I substituted "Club Soda" for Beer because I don't drink and don't like the taste.

I made this recipe for my fiance and I after craving some "fall" comfort food.  I made some substitutions: used a habanero and a jalapeno pepper, used 3/4ths of a beer, 2 teaspoons of chocolate syrup as I didn't have hot chocolate packets, and fire roasted some fresh corn from the farmer's market. I simmered for an hour and half and it was the perfect consistency, not too thick or thin.  My fiance, an excellent cook in his own right, said it was the best chili he has ever had :)))) We both thought it was amazing.  Made some Jiffy cornbread with it. It was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. GREAT SUCCESS!!!

LOVE THIS CHILI! Thank you Jimbalaya, you are a genius. The only changes I made were to use chicken stock instead of the beer, and 2 cans of pinto beans. The flavors in this chili are outstanding. Topped with shredded Monterey Jack is my favorite way to eat it, and my husband loves it on top of spaghetti. Either way, it's amazing!

I personally looooovvvvvvvvvvve this recipe thank you for sharing!  I must have made this recipe at least 7 times since I first found it. The heat is just right!  I do use green and red pepper for color... some small adjustments here and there to our taste like peas instead of corn to accommodate a food allergy but overall this is marvelous!

Loved it!  I've been looking for a good chili recipe and this is what I was looking for.  Being from Texas, I like my chili spicy.  I even tried to cut back on some of the spicy seasonings and didn't add the pepper so my kids could eat it and it was still too spicy for them.  My husband, who eats everything with fresh jalapenos including spaghetti (wierd I know) loved this recipe.  He went back for seconds and told me I have to keep this one.  I'm thinking about making this for a chili cook-off later this year.  Definately a keeper.

Someone call the fire department!!! Fantastic recipe, and the heat surely did not disappoint. I left out the chocolate powder though, and I used 1 Long Hot pepper and 2 Jalepenos in place of the Habenero since I couldn't find one. I did however use Habenero pepper sauce where it says to use hot sauce, and boy, did this recipe kick! I'm putting it at the front of my Chili recipes!!

AMAZING Chili, made it for the Superbowl and everyone loved it.  It was all gone in no time.  I only got to have a small bowl of it so next time will make twice as much.  Other than omitting the habanero I followed the recipe exactly. It was just enough heat for our taste buds. Delish!!!!

So, due to winter's gruesome chill, I decided to NOT be daunted by the extensive ingredient list/roughly 2 hour time block devoted to this thing.  A serious Smokin Scovilles Turkey Chili has developed between me, my boyfriend, and our two cats.    This was the most delicious thing ever.

Awesome taste.  My substitutions were:  Red peppers instead of green, added a little sweetness 1/2 white wine instead of beer, was perfect cajun seasoning instead of salt I served with a dallop of sour cream and shredded Cheddar cheese on top.  Everyone had seconds and said to keep this as a family favorite.

Family favorite! A few changes of course. Whole can of corn. One can of white kidney beans as well as the dark red. Only 1 teaspoon of the pepper flakes. Youll stretch your dollar and have a meal the whole family loves!

Yummy!  I didn't have a few of the ingredients (beer, paprika, cumin) but it still turned out great. I also added about 1 tablespoon of oat flour to thicken it up a bit at the end.   Liquid smoke was my secret ingredient in potato slad when I made it as it tends to add depth to some dishes.

Absolutely delicious I did add sweet Italian turkey sausage  (My hubbie loves a hearty meaty chili).   I may omit the hot sauce next time since I think the habaneros did the trick.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!!!

I made this without the habanero pepper, and it was EXCELLENT!  Living in Texas, I make a lot of chili, but my husband claims this was one of the best I've ever made.  And you couldn't even tell it was made with turkey rather than beef.  He eats his over fritos with melted cheese on top.  Very good, flavorful chili with a slight kick!

This chili is fabulous and I really monkeyed with it...it allows lots of freedom. No beer but I had some ginger ale and I used that. Still delicious. Changed the spices....still delicioius. Turkey was so tender...yum and thanks for this recipe.

My husband LOVED this. I used about a pound and a half of chili ground beef instead of the turkey. I also used two 10 oz cans of Rotel by accident, but I'm glad I used the smaller cans or it would probably be too tomato-y.

Delicious! However, I am a weak sauce when it comes to spice so I use jalapenos instead of habaneros and reduce chili powder to 1T.  I also do not add Worcheishires sauce or smoke flavoring. I also substitute the pack of hot chocolate, for 1 to 2 pieces of dark chocolate (preferably belgium chocolate). Hope this helps those who cannot handle things soo spicy like me.

LOVE this and it's still cooking. It's very flavorful. I didnt use a habanero, because the store didnt have....but i used 2 cans of diced green chilies and added a little ancho chili powder for heat.Next time i will make it like the recipes calls......because i bet it's really good with a hababero. I did add an xtra can of kidney beans and corn. My son couldnt wait for us, so he is having a small bowl with cheese and sour cream and tostitos. He really likes it. Great recipe!

Great rich, satisfying texture to the chili. I didn't have fresh chilis so I substituted 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp of New Mexico chili powder. I prefer the flavor of fresh chilies, but I think it worked out fine.  I don't like kidney beans, so I subbed in a large can of black beans (undrained). We really enjoyed the end result: it starts smooth and a little sweet, then the heat slowly builds. Fantastic with sour cream and a slice of cornbread crumbled on top. This made a LOT of chili and I was happy to have plenty to freeze afterwards. The trick to freezing? Measure out portions for 2 hearty servings into gallon freezer bags, lay flat on a paper plate and freeze until hard. The frozen chili is super-easy to keep organized and can defrost in a couple minutes in the microwave.

Loved the heat of this chili, but overall didn't think it was worthy of 5 stars. Definitely NOT the best chili I've ever tasted. Needed way more tomato taste, along with more beer and definitely some vinegar. I have used cocoa in several Mexican dishes (not hot chocolate mix) so that was not an unusual or unexpected addition for me. 3 stars: wasn't the best, yet I've  have had far worse...this recipe was "okay".

This was the best chili I ever made. I left out the habanero since I sort of forgot to buy it :) I also omitted the liquid smoke. This was so good. Has excellent flavor. I will totally make this again :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I was so excited to try this chili recipe and followed the directions to a tee (except I used jalape√±o instead of habanero).  But, I have to say I was disappointed with the result.  It seemed like all I could taste was the jalape√±o and hot spices.  Don't get me wrong, I like spicy foods but I also think chili should have a taste to it.  This simply tasted like "jalape√±o soup" -- I couldn't taste anything in it that gave it any flavor.  I can't imagine the "flavor" I would've gotten if I'd used a habanero pepper! I did, however, "doctor up" the leftovers with some more tomato sauce, cumin, chili powder, sugar, brown sugar, onion powder, and salt and it did improve on the chili flavor a little.

Oh Man, I really enjoyed this! I used 1 each of jalapeno & cayenne from my own garden instead of the habanero, & it was JUST spicy enough, any hotter would have been too much for the family.  I was also able to use fresh corn just steamd & then cut off the cob, put it in the last hour, & for beans I used romano & chick peas because those were what I had, & they were terrific.  Wonderful flavours!  Even better the next day!

In my opinion, it is the best chili I've had yet!!!  Be careful when handling the habanero pepper - it IS the hottest pepper in the world and I foolishly cut the peppers without gloves and burned my fingers!  But wow, the way the chili tasted, the burns were worth it!

Full flavored even with Turkey. Homerun on all ingredients. We did substitute Jalepenos for Habeneros just to keep the heat in check. Either way, the chocolate is brilliant for masking the spice-o-meter!

This recipe is pretty good but not exceptional.  I reduced the heat by using chili powder and used regular diced tomatoes.  I do think the corn was a nice addition.  I'm not entirely convinced that I will make this again.

This is good, but spicy! I even omitted the habanero, and still found it spicy, I added a whole can of corn instead of 1/2 and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (all I had) to try to cut the heat.

This was a nice thick hearty chili that served as a good base. Some reviews talk about the recipe missing something...but it could be because of it being a relatively low-fat chili.   We ended up omitting the onion (allergy), habanero, hot chocolate, and liquid smoke flavoring (allergy).  We also used some "cheap wine" for the cheap beer, a pound of ground pork for a pound of turkey. There was also a carton of mushrooms that needed to be cooked up - so those got tossed in to the pot also. My husband is one of those "sadistic spicy food lovers" and gave this a "4 or a 5". My son gave a "4". Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper!

I omitted the beans. The first time I made it, I swapped the beer with beef broth.   I made this dish again, this time with the beer.  It's better with the beer. Also, I didn't drain the tomatoes.  This recipe is friggin delicious.

This was really tasty and very easy to make. My boyfriend liked it, but said it was missing something though, and for me it was really good, but not outstanding chili. If I could I would give it 4.5 stars! I will make it again though, but next time with only 0.5 oz of cocoa mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

AWESOME!!  I am not the best when it comes to following a recipe, but this one is so easy.  I was a little skeptical of the instant hot chocolate at first.  My grocery store was all out of Habaneros so I used a Hot Cherry pepper instead.  My husband and I enjoy making this recipe together.  Who knew turkey chili could be this good!

I enjoyed this. It seems to be missing something. I used the leftovers to make burritos. Very economical!

My family is not really big on chili, but my husband and I both liked this recipe, and so did one of our kids.  I used chipotle diced tomatoes and chipotle hot sauce since that's what I had on hand, and it enhanced the smoky flavor of the chili.  I also omitted the habanero pepper and red pepper flakes and halved the other spicy stuff because of the kids.  I would make this recipe again.

I was a litte heavy handed with the chilli powder (according to the rest of the household, not me!).  Also I used just plain Fry's cocoa not the packets of instant stuff, I'm sure it makes a difference.  I'll do that next time.  We loved it, and the boys took leftovers for work 2 days later - even better!

This is by far the best CHili I have ever made.  My husband told me to toss all other chili recipes and only use this one.  The habanero pepper and hot chocolate were perfect otgether.

Awesome! This was *very* tasty. I did omit the habanero because I'm a wimp, but the chili still had a good amount of spice to it (in my wimpy opinion. hehe!). I halved the recipe, but still used the full can of kidney beans. Since we really like alot of both beans and tomatoes in our chili, I also added a can of pinto beans and a can of chili-ready tomatoes. The only other change I made was to use red bell pepper instead of green, as that's what I had on hand. Very good, thank you!

Wonderful flavor!  Served over penne pasta for a smokey chili mac.  I made some substitutions, simply for the fact that I was out of some ingredients and it turned out great (kidney beans=black beans, tomatoes and sauce=fire-roasted tomatoes, hot cocoa mix=cocoa powder, habenaro=pablano)

Really good recipe. I used japeno instead of habanero. I just wasn't brave enough for it. It's really tasty and yield a lot!! Fairly easy to make except for all the chopping but it wasn't bad. Next time I'll probably do half habanero and half jalapeno because it's not as spicy as I was hoping. Good luck!

I love chili on a cold winter night.  I am on a diet and thought I would have to give it up.. not with this one.  Used lean ground Turkey and there was very little fat and low in calories.  I couldn't tell it wasn't beef in the chili.  Tasted great!  (I had to use jalapeno pepper because my local store was out of habanero peppers-  It was still PLENTY spicy!)  We used the left overs the next day for chili dogs.

YEEHAW! I stuck to the recipe pretty much except I did not add a habanero, and it was plenty spicy. Also, I cooked this in a slow cooker for 6 hours as others suggested. I did add the corn in the last hour but I put the kidney beans in before slow cooking and they didn't get too mushy.

at my job, we were having a chili cook off for fun. Everyone LOVED this chili! There wasnt any left for me to take home. Some people did say it was a little too spicy but they loved the flavor. Also, Noone could have guessed it was turkey.

Didn't have a particularly unique flavor, but a very good standard chili recipe.  I used half the amount of turkey and double the beans.  Didn't add the habenero and still thought it was spicy enough from the pepper flakes.  Ended up adding a lot of extra salt and a big splash of red wine vinegar to bring out the final flavor a bit more.

I am just getting around to rating this, but have been using it for years! We and everyone we make it for LOVE it, we live in Philly PA and when it gets cold all our friends ask me to make this. The only changes I make is after the pan I put it all in a crock pot for like 5 hours...it makes it all come together in a thick sauce

This was a great, easy to make recipe. DO NOT skip the cocoa! I think that is the key. The only changes I made were to use unsweetened cocoa, and a lot more hot peppers (we like things very spicy). This recipe really brings out the heat of the hot peppers in a way you can enjoy, without leaving your mouth on fire. The only reason I give this four stars (I wish I could give it 4.5 stars) is that there's nothing terribly unique about the flavor.It's basically your perfect standard chili. Definitely the best standard chili I've made.

As one reviewer noted this chili is best to age a day after first cooking. Fresh I found the chocolate and smoke flavor to be overpowering. After a day in the refrig and warmed up these flavors were not as dominate. Which brings to mind, why add the chocolate at all, I don't taste a benefit.
There is a good bowl of chili in here and the spices make for some pleasent heat. I will make this recipe again but w/o the chocolate and perhaps I'll use half the liquid smoke, again otherwise a good bowl of chili.

Very delicious! I love my own chili and so does my family. We tried this tonight and laughed about the hot chocolate...don't leave it out! It was so perfect. Used jalapenos for the kids. Can't miss with this one.

Unbelievable.  Hands down the best chili I have ever had...and it's made with Turkey!  I added one extra can of the diced tomatoes and let it sit on low for about 3 hours after adding the corn.  YUM.

I've made this twice. My husband prefers beef so I used extra lean. It is awesome. I left the seeds in the habanero to get the extra kick, followed the recipe exactly, just omitted corn since we're not used to it in chili. 
The flavor is excellent after an hour of cooking, it's nice not having to wait until the next day to really enjoy it. Absolutely the best chili recipe I've 
made so far.

I have made chili most of my life and wanted to cut some of the fat and use turkey. This is the best I have ever tasted bar none. My son in law, who loves chili, said this was the best he ever had. I added grated cheese and tortillas to serve on the side. Will make none other now. Thanks so much.

WOW, the reviews were not kidding, this chili is awesome!!  I made a few additions (zucchini and red bell pepper) and found I needed a little extra tomato sauce and beer (oh darn) but otherwise left it as is and will be making this again and again!!

An awesome twist on a chili recipe.  I've made this recipe multiple times and everyone loves it.  It's great as-is, if you want to turn the heat down don't chop the habanero, just drop it in and pull it out when it's done cooking and cut the red pepper in half and possibly cut it out entirely.  Using beef instead of turkey is also a nice alternative.

Very tasty and has an excellent heat to flavor ratio. It was just the right thickness, and has a wonderful blend of spices followed with a slow and satisfying wave of heat that made this unique but not overpowering. I didn't add the beer, and had to substitute Smokey Chipotle Tabasco sauce because I didn't have liquid smoke, but followed everything else exactly. Excellent with a little cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.

I subsitute the ground turkey for ground beef. I also don't like my foods nearly as spicy as my husband, so I opt for jalapenos instead of habaneros. 

The recipe has become the family's favorite chili-con-carne!

It ended up being a little spicy for most of us, but it was still really flavorful.  My husband loved it.  Next time I'll cut down on some of the chili powder.  I didn't even add the habaneros!

Yum! Yum! I used a Jalapeno instead of a Habanaro since my grocery store didn't have any in stock. I also cooked my own sweet corn instead of canned....this recipe was delicious!! I'd definately make it again and I loved the smokey taste! Yum! Yum! I made homemade corn bread as a side! A great dinner for a chilly night!

Very good!  Great flavor! I didn't have a haberino pepper so I used more chili powder.  Also didn't have tomato sauce so I used V8.  Served over rice, a spoonful of butter and chives.  YUMMY!

This was a great chili, complex in flavor. I didn't have habaneros chilis, but I can see how that would make a difference...that chocolate taming the heat of the chili pepper.  My husband liked it, but thought it tasted "different".  That's what made it sooo good!

Delicious....omitted the habanero(cause my family cant stand the heat, unlike me),and omitted the hot cocoa mix. Otherwise, a very good hearty chili. My nine year old loved it! Thanks!

Excellent!  I used 2 jalapenos instead of habanero, 3 cans of Rotel and for the beans, Brooks Chili Hot Beans.  I placed #1 in a chili cookoff with this recipe, and everyone is asking for the recipe!  The hot chocolate packet and the beer are a nice touch.  There is just enough heat but is toned down a bit.

This is the recipe I used for the first time making chili at home and won't use any other one.  This chili has some "kick" to it, so it's not for the meek.  I followed it pretty much to the T, however my husband likes his chili with a little more sauce so I added more tomato sauce than what is called for in this recipe.  I also used canned spicy chili beans drained instead of plain kidney beans.  It's delicious either slow cooked or cooked over the range.  Serve with a scoop of sour cream and shredded cheddar on top with baked pita bread on the side.

Extremely flavorful and simple to make.  Substituted serrano peppers because my store didn't have habanero.  Still spicy, but not unbearable.  Thank you - this is a keeper!

The fourth chili recipe I tried from the site, and the only one I will ever make again.  Everyone raves about how good it is when they try it and everyone wants the recipe.  I keep the ingredients pretty much the same, but make some minor changes:
Celery, Italian sausage patties (browned and crumbled), substitute hot chocolate mix with 1 tbsp cocoa and 1 tbsp brown sugar.  Comes out brilliant every time.

Excellent.  Prepared recipe as written and my husband absolutely loved it.  My temperature shy daughter even served herself up a big bowl to take to school with her.  Will definitely prepare this recipe again.

I made this chili a couple of weeks ago as the turkey option at an annual chili party in a large group of friends. The chili has some interesting flavors that are very good but not for me. I thought the hot chocolate mix was a good idea but was too sweet. If I make it again, I plan on using some dark chocolate to give it that chocolate accent but without the sweetness.

I've made this as directed in the past and whoa, it's spicy, but ohhhh so good!  The past couple times I have had to cut down on the spice significantly due to children eating with us.  It's still fantastic but I like it with all the spice!

Awesome!  My friends went crazy for this chili.  I substituted cocoa powder for the hot chocolate mix and smoked paprika for the regular paprika.  Will definitely be making this again.
