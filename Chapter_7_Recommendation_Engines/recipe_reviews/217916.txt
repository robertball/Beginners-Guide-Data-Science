I have to admit I was a bit leery of trying this out. But I thought, heck I love strawberry and avocado salad so why not? This is really surprisingly great tasting. I just ate a bowl with a spoon, no chips, since it is for brunch after my morning hike. The sweet strawberry mixed in with the buttery creamy avocado, the crunchy onions, zing from bits of fresh jalapeño, and the lime juice mends it all together...I just have to say, WOW...Who'd have ever thought. What a wonderful way to get your vitamins...and to all the 92 that saved this but haven't tried it...give it a try...you might like it. :P

This was a sure fire change from the salsa we all know. To my surprise this combination of ingredients was very good. I would say try this and you might be surprised at how well they blend together.

I served this salsa on top of grilled tilapia. It was simple to make but looked and tasted fancy! A creative variation with plate appeal for those who also like pineapple mango salsas, peach salsas, etc.

Delicious!!! Made this for a family BBQ and everyone devoured it. I would have made the recipe exactly but I did not have jalapeño so I substituted a green bell pepper.   I served this with home made cinnamon and sugar tortilla chips. Excellent combination!! A must make again.

Substituted yellow bell pepper for jalapeno.  It was lovely, transformed some rather fishy baked perch fillets into a lovely and colorful meal.  will be making it again!

I made this exactly as written and served it over 1 lb swai.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Tasty, but not amazing. If you make it, I would recommend using less lime juice, it's all I could really taste.

I made this a couple times and even though I omitted the cilantro (I don't like cilantro) & I ran out of lime, it was still amazing! Even my pickiest eater was all over this salsa! Added to my regular rotation!

Definitely different for salsa, also like the healthy idea for salsa. Would try again, maybe without the onion next time, all I could really taste on top of the cilantro
