I'm curious about a couple of things about this recipe.  First, why did I end up with 24, not 12, of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates?  Could it be an AR misprint?  Mine is a standard, mini-muffin tin.  Second, I really don't like nutmeg much. So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?! And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth?  Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're  small you won't eat as much.  You'll just eat more of them.  And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS, Dianne! That way you get more of that buttery, cinnamony sweetness in every bite!  I did make a couple of modifications, but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine and, because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use, I subbed buttermilk for the milk. This worked beautifully, but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1/2 tsp. baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly! Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up!  (And I already did, with five of them) Your recipe is a beauty, Dianne! ~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around  to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies, sometimes significantly! This explains the variance in yield with this recipe, to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins.

I'm the submitter of this recipe and I'd like to add a few notes!  First, the recipe should read "butter or margarine."  Either one works great.  Second, I finally found out from my mom, who got the recipe from my grandma, that this recipe makes 24 mini muffins.  You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin.  You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish, but "officially" this recipe makes 24.  I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side.  Sorry about the confusion!

Wonderful recipe that's a cross between a mini muffin and a donut hole!  Simple, delicious, sweet little treats that are kinda like a potato chip - I dare you to eat just one.....  With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long. I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out. I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe. Thanks Dianne! Update: Like others, I did get a little more than twelve out of one batch but I was so busy popping these little goodies in my mouth I didn't notice the discrepancy. And at any rate, you just can't get enough of these!

I just made these this morning! They were very good! I put in a little less than 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also coated mine in powdered sugar, vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze. We all like the vanilla glaze best! Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze

2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 TBS milk
1 TBS butter, softened
Put that into a bowl and mix together. I added more milk, but I didn't measure. I just got it to the consistancy I liked. Once I mixed it, I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed. Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry. I double dipped them. Then on the vanilla glaze ones, I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze. Also, glaze them once they have cooled. If you don't wait, they will fall apart.

Great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I noticed the accusation of plagiarism; sour grapes.  This forum is for sharing recipes.  I don't think a single recipe on this site is totally original by the person that shares them.  Who cares except rivercity.  I don't care who created the recipe just keep sharing.  Thanks!!!

okay, my two cents.  i can see where everyone thought these to be a 5 star rating, but i think the nutmeg to be a little over-powering and i am a *bigtime* spice lover!!!  in fact, i am usually heavy-handed in that dept., but followed this recipe to a 'T' and i personally thought it over the edge where the nutmeg was concerned.  also, the batter made 14 of these puppies for me, no matter how hard i pressed on the original twelve trying to duplicate the recipe as written.  it wasn't going to happen unless i was willing to accept huge, sweet, sugar-coated 'shroom-looking muffins.  lastly, the sugar/cinnamon ingredients are way over-kill.  i would easily cut the amount(s) by one third.

Oh my word are these amazing! I would give ten stars if I could. They taste just like little sugared donuts, but without all the guilt. I made these as written, but chose just to coat the tops with the margarine and sugar mixture, so I reduced the cinnamon and sugar topping by half. There was still some left over, so I'll just save it to use on the next batch, which I think I'll just make right now. Make sure you spray the pans well and they will pop out very easily. Dianne, this recipe is outstanding!

Nice recipe when you don't have eggs. I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice and used 1/4 tsp. I halved the butter and sugar and added a tsp of vanilla. For the topping I skipped the melted margarine and tossed them with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 cup of sugar in a paper bag to coat, made 18 mini muffins baked in 18 minutes. *** I have tried it with an egg as well and we noticed no difference with taste or texture. ***

Delicious! I had been craving donuts and this satisfied my sweet tooth perfectly - and presumably at least a little healthier since they're baked (not fried like actual donuts). I made the muffin recipe exactly as listed (I did sub butter instead of margarine), but baked them in regular size muffin tin using cupcake liners. The recipe as listed gave me 8 "regular" muffins. Then, instead of rolling them in the butter & cinnamon-sugar mixture I simply drizzled melted butter on the tops of the muffins & sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over the butter while they were still warm & fresh out of the oven. They were fantastic - great taste and texture - I'll definitely make these again! P.S. Since I made these in a regular size muffin tin I baked them for about 21 mins.

These muffins were awesome! I followed this recipe to a T and had no problems! One thing I found out was, after tasting the batter that this was not gonna be enough for our family! But, no problem... I went right ahead and made another batch! These were so good! I will make them again and again!! :) Thanks Dianne!

These are absolutely delicious! I made a double batch and followed the recipe exactly. They fit perfectly into my 24 slot mini muffin pan, however, when they baked, the tops rose out of the pan, and instead of staying nice and puffy, they spread out over the muffin pan. This was not the look I wanted...so I took the edges off of the finished muffins before rolling them in the cinnamon sugar and butter. This made them look more like donut holes. I was also wondering about the rolling in butter part...I couldn't seem to do it without the muffins being absolutely soaked in butter...I ended up just dipping the tops of the rest after I dipped the first few. The taste of these muffins, however, makes up for these defects...in my opinion, they're even better than donuts. My family ate the whole double batch in about 10 minutes...and absolutely loved them. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Dianne! It's a keeper!

Made these for Recipe Group 5/23/10. I got 24, but they didn't rise up over the top of the pan. Maybe I didn't put enough in. Doesn't matter, they are still mighty fine. I am not a nutmeg fan, I cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. Oh, and I used butter. They are almost gone already and I made them this morning. Just the right 'pop in the mouth' size! Thanks Dianne.

I love the cider donuts that are available in the Fall so I tweaked these muffins to resemble them. Not a huge fan of nutmeg, I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg in the  batter. Next time I think I will add a pinch of nutmeg along with a teaspoon of cinnamon. I also substituted cider for the milk. The result is wonderful! I did have butter left over after dipping the tops so I will melt less for that. In accordance with some other reviews, after dipping the tops, I rolled the entire muffin in the cinnamon and sugar mixture and as a result I ran out just before the last muffin! So I'll be a little heavy-handed with that next time but that's because I altered the recipe, not because the recipe was faulty. I made these little gems so that I can take some with me tomorrow to an interview for a volunteer position cooking at a local hospice. I hope they lke them as much as I do!

Yummy.  I made a few changes.  I substituted soy egg nog for the milk since that was what I had on hand.  I also changed the spices.  Instead of the nutmeg I used 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger.

I want to give this one star for not making enough!!! Fabulous! I gave up dipping the whole thing in butter and dipped the tops. When eating, I preferred the ones with just the tops dipped as they were more firm and not quite so messy to eat. I did double the nutmeg based on other reviews and have a grinder that I love using! I also made a second batch with a lemon twist (see my custom recipe if you're interested) I found mine were nicely done in 10-11 minutes and I got 20 nice sized ones. For the batch I pushed 24 out of they were a bit too small and crunchy, still nice tho

Love this recipe. I did skip dipping the muffins in the melted margarine but the sugar and cinnamon stuck very well.  Great treat for the family but make a double or triple batch or you won't get a taste. Thanks Diane.

THIS WAS FABULOUS!! I made these on a whim for breakfast thismorning and my family LOVED them!!! I didnt follow directions exactly, but this recipe seems failproof. I used butter instead of margarine, and didnt use mini muffin pan. Instead, I used a full size muffin pan (not th cupcake pans, this is a full size muffin pan). It only made four muffins, which is perfect because otherwise I would have gorged myself on them!!! Fantastic recipe, thank you so much for sharing!!

YUM! Yes it is more like a donut than a muffin, hence the name. This recipe hits the donut craving spot!  I've never baked anything like them, and don't have a deep fryer so I've never attempted donuts before.  I have to hide these or I'd eat the whole batch! (I just baked them, they're still warm) I'm so glad I found this recipe.   I had a minor mishap but it was my own fault.  I didn't grease the muffin pans enough OR I didn't let them cool enough (?) because some of them stuck to the pan. I performed muffin surgery and got them out looking okish.  When I covered them in the sugar mixture it hid most of the boo boo's. I think I filled the pans too full, so some of the lids came off when I was trying to remove them too! grrr.   I used powdered sugar for half of them - as advised - I shook them in a bag of powdered sugar while warm. anyways- they were amazing. I'm giving the recipe 5 stars- but I'm giving myself 3 stars for the execution.  Why dock the recipe?!?

These are amazing! I didn't change a thing, except to use butter instead of margarine, increase the nutmeg to 1 tsp and bake in regular muffin pans. The whole family loved them. Thanks!!!

Wow! These are AmAzInG!! I doubled the recipe and baked them in large muffin tins. Made about a dozen. Not enough. I got up in the morning, and the first thing that I was told was; We are not going to buy donuts anymore. These are just as good if not better! Can I have another one?" Lets just say I ended up cooking another batch then and there, AND it took me less than half an hour!! Thanks Dianne!!

These were pretty good, I'm not sure I can rave about them. There was too much cinnamon and sugar on the outside of the muffins, I can't believe I just wrote that! Next time I make these I will try using confectioners' sugar and cinnamon and skip the extra butter, rolling them while still warm should get enough to stick. I liked the flavor of the muffin, cut back a bit on the nutmeg. I definitely will make them again.

9 10 11 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214651/donut-muffins/ ... I had two before leaving for work & came home to a container of powdered sugar & cinnamon sugar - & two dirty minimuffin tins.  :(  :)  Yeah, good!  I guess I had the right size pans because mine made 24 exactly - no muffin tops.  :D  I baked mine about 20 minutes at 350.  They don't get very brown so don't go by looks too much.  They were just barely browning at the edges when they were done - just barely.  Margarine will give these babies a more donut taste.  Not that I have anything against butter, but it would give a more cupcake or muffin taste.  Same with adding vanilla.  Good, but donuts are pretty plain.  Good-good, but not so deep in flavor.  I used 1/8t nutmeg.  I'm not a big fan of it.  It was barely detectable.  'Probably because I knew it was there.  I didn't want to taste it, just to have good flavor.  I tried the cinnamon sugar listed.  Yummy.  Also did half white sugar, half powdered.  Yummy, too.  Gonna try adding a little cocoa to the powdered sugar ones, too.  When I get some jam, gonna try jelly filling 'em.  After that, may have to lose a few pounds.  :D ... 'Tried cocoa, not so good.

AWESOME!  These definitely tasted like a cinnamon sugar donut only bite size.  I used butter as I didn't have any margarine and they were "Oh so good"!  They took such little time to make.  Hubby loved the little crunch they had.  This is the second time I've made these and they came out perfect once again.   I got 18 muffins and baked them for the full 20 minutes.  If you are afraid they will be too sweet, just dip the top and roll in the sugar mixture.  They will pick up less sugar that way.   Thank you Diane for such an AWESOME recipe!

These were absolutely delicious! I'm keeping this recipe! I've made them twice so far. 1st time: I followed the recipe exactly; however, I'll reduce the sugar (the one for coating) a BIT b/c I had some left over. I wanted it to seem like a donut so I used chocolate glaze to pour on top of the muffin. I used the glaze from this site (Sanity Chocolate Glaze). 2nd time: I really wanted to them to look like donuts so I used a measuring cup to form a circular 'cup' and poured the batter into 3 of the foil 'cups'. I didn't pour too much since they puff up. After they were done, I took them out and cut a hole in the middle of each foil muffin cup, then after I coated then, I brushed chocolate glaze! They totally looked like donuts! And were delicious!  I ADDED THREE PHOTOS of THEM to THIS RECIPE, so you can CHECK IT OUT if you wanna see how they came out :) I just wished I had sprinkles and it would have been perfect donuts!

They sounded really good so I decided to make them when I had company for the weekend. There was way to much spices in this recipe. The nutmeg was really overpowering and no one ate any. I will try and make this recipe again and adjust the spices.

I have made these babies at least a dozen times since I discovered this recipe.  They are so moist and delicious! The nutmeg is a must! I follow the recipe to a T except for making them in regular muffin size.  1 batch makes 11-12 muffins for me, depending on how much of the yummy batter I eat! I have added diced apples and that is pretty good, but surprisingly not as good as plain! Have added it to a brunch menu, and it was very well received! Thanks for the unique, tasty and easy recipe!

*** MUST NOTE: these puff way up when baking. I mean like they triple in volume. I was thinking the cups looked too empty, but they PUFFED big time.   To save a big mess, I just brush a decent amount of melted butter over the top of the muffins in the tins while still warm, it runs right down the sides. Then I sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. Finally I just pick them up and dip the bottoms in the cinnamon sugar. Mine were done in like 13 minutes, so watch them closely. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I used butter instead of margerine because that's what I had on hand. I made no other changes. I got 15 mini muffins, using my small cookie scoop to make even muffins. The first batch were slightly overcooked at 17 minutes, so 15 minutes at 375* was right on for me. The kids loved these and I had one with my morning coffee and had to hold myself back from having more. This would be great to make on the weekend as I know my husband would have loved these. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Dianne. NOTE: I plan on making this again soon with the margerine. I think that is essential to get the donut flavor, so I will make this again once I have margerine and update my review.

In a word, DELICIOUS!!  These tasted very much like the mini donuts you get at the fair, only no frying with these.  They are SO EASY to put together.  In under an hour I had the batter mixed up, the mini muffins baked & cooled and coated with the butter and cinnamon-sugar mixture... it could not have been faster!  I thought the nutmeg seemed perfect, but next time I may add a little cinnamon to the batter as well.  I am also curious to try adding a glaze to them.  Such a simple recipe with so many possibilities, thanks Dianne!  UPDATE 7/16/14 - Because my family loves cinnamon so much, I now use 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and only 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also add 1 Tablespoon of Cinnamon to the dipping mixture, instead of just 1 teaspoon.  Perfect for us!  I also started adding about 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the batter - gotta have some salt to bring out the sweet!

I made these miniature muffins for our Sunday School class and the boys and girls gobbled them up. Only one looked at them and said "I don't think I'll like 'em". I said the only way to know is to taste it. That little boy took a tiny bite, then another, then another....he never said if he liked it only the wrapper was left!

Made the recipe exactly how it said and got 18 small ones, also 1/2 cup sugar is too much to dip them in, wasted at least 1/4 cup...taste like a cake donut hole..Used cinnamon in batter instead of nutmeg...Yep it is a keeper.

Add my family to the growing group of people loving this recipe! I just finished the first batch and ate one...oh my wow...they are great. I made them exactly as the recipe stated, but I only dipped the tops into butter and then the cinnamon/sugar mixture. My daughter ate two and said these should definitely be on the menu for her graduation party next week...I totally agree! Thanks for a great, simple, delicious recipe that doesn't require any special ingredients.

Phenomenal recipe by Dianne.  My coworkers now refer to them as "timbits" and the recipe is oftentimes requested.

The recipe is so incredibly easy to put together.  Keep in mind to stir this by hand to avoid over-mixing ingredients.  Working with he dough too much will result in a flat hard muffin.  Stir until just blended and don't worry too much about the tiny lumps.  My only alteration to this recipe is adding a tsp of vanilla.

Thank you Dianne for the wonderful recipe.

Adding 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt to the batter would really make these little gems pop. A really fun, easy and tasty recipe to do with the kiddos :)

Yummm! Yep, they taste just like little donut holes! I love the nutmeg! 

The only changes I made was to add a dash or two of cinnamon and salt to the batter, and to add a bit of nutmeg and salt to the cinnamon sugar coating. I love how just a little dash of salt really brings out the flavor. I also used half whole wheat flour.

In the future, unless I'm making these for a dessert (since that really is what they taste like), I'll skip the butter coating and just dip the tops in the cinnamon sugar. It sticks perfectly fine without the butter and tastes plenty sweet and savory!

These really are amazing! I can't wait to have them on cold winter mornings with a steaming cup of cocoa! Thanks! :)

Absolutely 5 stars plus!  I made these before and I am so glad to see they were approved.  These are an easy and fast way to make "donuts."  The nutmeg adds the perfect touch.  I highly suggest making a double batch--that's how good they are.  My little guy gobbled them up and asked for more.  I can't decide whether I liked them better hot or after sitting for a while, because both ways they were perfect.  Thanks Diane for sharing this delicious recipe!

AWESOME!!! thank you for this delightful recipe - for those who found the nutmeg too strong - freshly ground nutmeg 3/4 tsp.is correct if not freshly ground 1/4 tsp. Also to get nicely uniform and 24 muffins use a proper tablespoon measuring spoon and level off and you should have ample for 24 muffins.  Thank again Dianne terrific recipe.

There wasn't much to this muffin. If you like the taste of flour with a bit of nutmeg, these were fine, but if you like food with flavor and substance, make something else.

Diane, thank you soooo much!!!!  I made them this morning as per the recipe and received RAVE reviews from the ladies.  This recipe is spot on perfect....the nutmeg amt is perfect (and really can't be tasted); it made exactly 24, and the baking time was right on.

Didn't care for these.  I thought they were lacking in flavor and as my 4yo son put it "there is too much sugar"!  These probably could be tasty with some changes but as is -- not so good. Sorry.

I was expecting a lighter texture.  They tasted just like the boxed cinnamon donuts you get in the grocery store- in my house those are the last to go.  I did like the nutmeg flavor but  I was dissapointed with these-with all the awesome reviews I thought they'd be different.  They just weren't for us. :(

Oh.....I really loved these. I don't have a mini pan, so I doubled the recipe with ONLY 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. Because of my spousal unit's diabetes, I used splenda instead of sugar in the muffin. I did however roll in real sugar and cinnamon as directed. I think the key is to lightly mix the dough so they remain tender & let them rest 5 minutes before you roll them. My changes produced 12 med muffins. This is a huge winner at our house. Thank you!

I made these for the first time the other day, they were a heavy muffin very donut like we found them good, i probably won't be making them very often as they are sweet and addictive. If you like a good old fashioned donut then you will probably like these!

These came out great! Made them the morning of new years, and I like that there is no egg in them. I used whole wheat all purpose flour and also didn't have nutmeg. I'm sure the nutmeg would make it taste even better. My boys devoured them and making them as mini muffins are a perfect size for kids to eat. The sugar mixture makes more than necessary so I would halve it next time. So easy and uses ingredients typically in a pantry. Definitely let them cool first before eating, completely different taste. I tried one straight from the oven and topped with the sugar and it did not taste that great.

I'm sorry...but I did NOT like these at all. I usually never fail at recipes, but this one I tried 2 times and both times flopped completely. In the first batch, I followed the recipe exactly. I followed the instructions exactly and that's where it went wrong. I thought that maybe this recipe isn't meant for the vigourous mixing and beater of a KitchenAid in order to result in an airy muffin, so I literally mixed the margarine and sugar in a bowl...with a spoon...a fork...a whisk. I was really skeptical at this point, but I stirred in the milk...with a spoon...and then a fork...and then a whisk...it absolutely did NOT combine and was a mess.  The second time around, I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a hand mixer. It worked great - you should change that in your instructions.  The finished product was a mushy mess that stuck to the pan, regardless of the fact that it was very well greased - I have never had this problem before. In addition, I think there is WAY too much baking powder for this amount of batter - I found the muffins to have a very strange taste...

This recipe seemed like it could have potential, but as it is....no go. sorry!

I only added a dash, but the nutmeg was too strong and I like nutmeg! Light and fluffy, but otherwise kind of a boring muffin. I think I prefer heavier, wheat/oat muffins that can hold more flavors.

I made these as written except added about a half a teaspoon of french vanilla extract and wow are these good!  I didn't grease my pans enough and they all stuck to the bottom of the pan, but I managed to scrape out 5 of them before I made myself stop!  I didn't even dip them in the butter or sugar mixture :)  I will definitely be making these again and again.

15 minutes was too long in my oven.  I'll try them again at a lower temp and add a pinch of salt--they were a little flat tasting.

VERY ADDICTIVE!!!  As others had suggested, I added 1/4 t. of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon to the batter.  After baking and before removing muffins from the tins, I brushed with melted butter and placed in a plastic bag with powdered sugar and shook.  I removed from the bag and sprinkled tops with cinnamon and granulated sugar mixture. Great easy recipe!  Thanks for sharing Dianne!!

Just ok - think it might need something like an egg for some substance. Maybe a dash of salt and vanilla wouldn't hurt either.

These are super easy and my family loved them. I didn't change a thing. The butter and sugar... well hey they are donut muffins not health food. They are a great treat and the small size is nice if you are trying to limit the amount of your splurge. The nutmeg reminds me of the homemade donuts I had as a child. Great recipe.

I made this recipe twice this week using my "Babycakes Cakepop" maker and they were amazing. Just like a donut hole without all the fat of frying.  Also I just rolled mine twice in a combination of powdered sugar and cinnamon and left out the extra butter for rolling in...yummee can't wait to make them again

Pros: Easy to make, delicious.
Cons: Very delicate.

I wanted something I could throw together pretty quickly for breakfast and these looked great, and they taste great, but I ended up destroying about half the pan trying to get them out, and I used cooking spray! These are so delicate when they come out of the oven that setting them on the cooling rack the wrong way will end up causing a very noticeable dent. I had to wait for them to cool before I even tried to roll them in the coatings. Also, I didn't have any nutmeg on hand for the batter so I just used cinnamon. The plain muffins are quite good too, very buttery and light, perfectly good even without the coating.

Made these today with my 2 oldest granddaughters, ages 6 & 9. I accidentally put the cinnamon into the muffin mix but they still tasted delicious. My batch made 15 muffins.  Easy and very addictive.

These were awesome I did however change the nutmeg amount I put in 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and then 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It gave it that great fall taste.  Will make these again and again.

My muffins didn't rise and were like little stones when they came out. I made it twice. Since so many have had success with this recipe, I can't understand what went wrong. Also, most donuts aren't that spicy. If I were to try this recipe again, I would cut the nutmeg in half, add a pinch of salt to bring out flavor and add more cinnamon to the sugar. I really like the idea of a donut muffin and will look for a different recipe.

These are really good and so easy!  Best thing is that if you don't have eggs, you can still make a good dessert.  I made them following the directions first, and then, because I wanted them to taste more like my donut holes that I make and changed the spices a little.  I added equal portions of nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.  I also added a little salt, since that is what keeps you coming back for more!  I made 4 recipes and there are none left in one day!  Crazy!

My family loved these little muffins. I always double the recipe and I use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, because I don't like nutmeg. I have made these at least four times already. Thank you Dianne for a delicious little treat.

these muffins were very easy to make and made me full, which most muffins dont. I think, however, that they have way too much nutmeg...so much so that that was all i tasted! i suggest that you use half a teaspoon instead and add some vinalla. im not sure if ill be making these again.

I've never actually reviewed anything before but made these this morning and felt compelled.  The muffins certainly had the consistency of donuts but tasted only of nutmeg.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cut it back to 1/2 tsp but it was still overpowering.  If I make these again, I would cut back even more... though I am not sure I would.

skip the dipping in butter part unless you really want the extra richness/fat.  shaking them while still warm in a bag of cinnamon sugar works just as well and these are oh so fluffy and tasty!  after the first few I actually skipped the cinnamon too and just shook them in sugar, felt the cinnamon overpowered the other flavors.
also, if you don't have a mini muffin pan, just do a little dollop at the bottom of a regular muffin pan.  they arent the same shape but they're delicious little ovals!

Wow, such a simple recipe, but full of great flavor!!  LOVED them!  I did wonder if there was a mistake in the recipe -- as I was making them I noticed there were no eggs in the recipe, and couldn't imagine a muffin without an egg, so I went ahead and added one.  Delicious!  Will be making these many more times, and have to agree that the idea to make them mini is genius.

Great recipe to have kids help with.  Simple and yummy!  Made them into chocolate by adding vanilla instead of nutmeg and 1/4 cup of cocoa.  Made a glaze of 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1 tbs butter and 1 tbs milk.  Mixed glaze and then heated in microwave for 30 seconds.  Mixed again and then dipped donut muffins in while still warm.  Kids added sprinkles and they looked great and tasted great too!  Will make again very soon.  Thanks for a great recipe Dianne!  (Keep eye on  muffins, mine were done in 12 mins.)

Really good, but the sugar/cinnamon mixture is a bit too much for my taste. Next time, I'll just coat the tops of the muffins with the melted margarine, sugar & cinnamon instead of the whole thing!

These were't bad.  I followed the instructions without any revisions.  I baked in a 12 ct mini muffin tin.  It was like eating a cinnamon/sugar donut hole.  Brought them to my daughter's school Christmas party; no one ate them.  My picky kids liked them, and so did one of the high schoolers who sneaked some, knowing I made goodies.  But, no one in the class touched them.

I only give this recipe three stars because my father liked them so much. These muffins turned out very dense. I followed other reviews and cut the nutmeg down to a 1/2 t. and it was still overpowering. Sorry but I will probably not make these again.

I don't think they tasted anything like donuts . I was not impressed in the least, but husband and kids ate them all.

I made these this morning and they were a HUGE hit! I definitely recommend doubling the recipe because 12 go way too fast!  I followed the recipe exactly...next time I might reduce the nutmeg just a little bit.. maybe 1/2 tsp.   :~)

I wish I had tasted one before I dipped them all in the melted margarine. I think I would have then gone forward and dipped only the tops. We just didn't care for them with all that margarine. Perhaps I dipped them too much but I don't see how I could have done it differently. I just dipped, lifted and then rolled in the cinnamon sugar mixture. I gave my husband and sons a few on their plates and no one finished theirs. I'd like to try this again but dipping only the tops as a few others did. As is, though, we just didn't love these. Thanks for posting, though!

Very good.  My children ate them up in less time than it took to make them, and since they are so easy to make that's saying something!  A fantastic recipe to bake with children.  For my tastes I'd omit dipping them in melted butter and just roll the warm muffins in the cinnamon sugar without it.  I'm anxious to try different spice combinations with these, like replacing most of the nutmeg with cardamom and adding cloves to the cinnamon sugar.

I made these for hubby.  He likes stuff like this- I don't.  He tried one and loved it.  Then I tried one.  They are very good.  I used a brand new mini muffin tray, cooked for 17 minutes and they turned out quite dark (as compared to the photos).  I have an thermometer in my oven and baked them at exactly 375.  They were crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  They are so tasty and cute.  They would be great to serve at a shower, brunch or any tea party type event.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are delicious!!  The first time I made these I thought the nutmeg flavor was overwhelming so I cut it in half the next time but then it didn't taste like a donut anymore so I put in all the nutmeg from then on.  I also tried these with the entire muffin rolled in the butter cinnamon sugar mixture and it was WAY too much butter. We normally love butter but it took the donut flavor away for us.  I then dipped just the tops in the butter and rolled the whole thing in the cinnamon sugar mixture and it was perfect for us.  I only needed to cook mine for 10-15 min.

It's tough to beat tasty + easy! And when all 6 of my household cheer a recipe, I'm a happy mom. The muffins are very sweet -- think Krispy Kreme sweet -- so consider tasting them w/o the butter/sugar coating the first time you try them. (Powdered sugar is also a tasty alternative to the recommended coating.) I'm very glad Dianne posted this. Would not have found it otherwise :) Thanks, Dianne.

I had to review this recipe because I made it last night on a whim and it was FANTASTIC!  I put just a pinch of nutmeg in my batter, added vanilla extract, and only used 2 tablespoons of butter to coat my muffins before rolling them in the cinnamon sugar.  I really love how easy and exceptionally tasty these little muffins are!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe, Dianne!!

I just made these...house smells divine! They were easy to make and so delish!  I made 12 w/strawberry preserves and 12 plain.  While the plain are good just as they are, I really love preserves in them.  Just put about 1 tsp or so of batter in muffin pan, 1/2 tsp jam, and another tsp of batter.   It doesn't matter if it looks messy.  It will bake just fine, I promise! And I AM NOT A SEASONED BAKER!! What an easy dessert for busy holidays or just an after school treat!  If you have young children, they could certainly help with the dipping!  I've already had 4! I had to see if they were done, right? lol

Well first off, these are about the most simplest, fastest thing to make in the kitchen! and no eggs in them either! They were a definite hit - hubs adored them but then was dismayed when I said needed them for my Agents Open House Tour and he couldn't have anymore :) Not to worry, I am sure there will be plenty leftover for him! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe should be re-named to 'Crack Donut Muffins'. I ate the entire batch in an evening! 
While mine didn't rise (like the pics) in my mini muffin tins (I think i may have overmixed slightly), they weren't so lovely to look at, until I popped one of these bad boys in my mouth. Definitely on my fav list. AMAZING.

These were a big hit with everyone!  I would recommend using them as mini muffins though... I made full size muffins and they were good but I'm sure even better as mini's so you can have all that flavor in every bite! yummy

How exciting to find a "doughnut" that my egg-allergic daughter can eat. :) Super easy to make, and delicious. I did not use the extra butter to make the cinnamon/sugar stick, I just rolled 'em around while they were hot and it stuck fine. Daughter and hubby are already requesting a second batch.

I have been wanting to make these since they were published, but didn't have a mini muffin pan. So when I finally got one I rushed home and made these. I didn't tell my husband or daughter what the recipe was called and my husband immediately said after popping one in his mouth it tastes like a doughnut. My daughter thinks they'd be great dipped into different sweet concoctions. I think these lasted about half an hour in total. A big thankyou Dianne.

Your recipe is great!  I tweaked it a little, but only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I was out of nutmeg, so I used toffee chips instead.  I also used powdered sugar to coat the moffin tops and finished them with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips drizzled on top, sans cinnamon.  They were moist and tasty!  Thanks!

Mmmm...yummy! 

I made a double batch so I could do full size muffins, yielding 12 full size muffins for myself. This amount may vary depending on the size of your muffin tin. 

I think next time I might toss in a couple of chunks of Apple Pie Filling, you know, to be all fancy like. ; )

Delicious, thank you for posting.

These are sooo good! I made a batch for my husband to take to work as snacks. He has a few missing..I couldn't stop eating them:) I used sugar in th raw & butter. I also added a dash of cinnamon and pure vanilla extract. For the sugar coating: sugar in the raw & butter. I doubled the batch, but wish I had tripled it! I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!!

These turned out fantastic.  I don't know what some were expecting, I mean, it is baked instead of fried.  So therefore it won't have the expected texture. I used regular sized muffin tins filled halfway, and baked for 15  minutes. they came out moist and light. Next time I may actually use mini muffin pans because I only made 11 regular sized "donuts." The only thing I changed was to add cinnamon to the batter, and brown sugar to the topping.  I rolled the donuts still warm from the oven in the cinnamon/sugar/brown sugar topping after dipping the tops in butter.  I made sure to only melt a quarter of a cup of butter at a time into a bowl, that way when I dipped the donuts, they didn't get soaked, as I noticed some reviewers said that the butter was too much.  I didn't add nutmeg as I did not have any, but the cinnamon was a good substitution.  I will happily make these again, maybe next time using powdered sugar instead. :)

These are pretty tasty little guys. The first time I made them I failed miserably. Don't know why. However, my husband thought the nutmeg was a little too much, so, this time I only used a good 1/4 tsp.  I also used butter instead of margarine. I did, however, find that the tinier the muffin tin the nicer they bake up. And, they don't get quite as crunchy as the 'larger' mini tin. The smaller one seemed to brown much nicer for some reason.

Scrumptious! They remind me of the Tiny Tom donuts that we used to get at the Food pavilion of the Canadian National Exhibition every summer. They made them from scratch on a little donut conveyor belt. These taste just as good, except they're much better because they're not deep fried. These simple and basic recipes always taste great.

These are fantastic!!  The only thing I did differently was to substitute cinnamon for the nutmeg.  Next time I may use a little of both.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Also, double the recipe because they will be gone in a matter of minutes!

YUM-Ol!! I gave it 5 stars ESPECIALLY since I had everything I needed on hand!! These were super easy! Next time, I will have to double the batch!! (I got exactly 24 but the last 2 were not as big) I used the mini muffin tins and put 1 tablespoon of batter in each hole. You have to try!!!!

Yummy!  I got 22 mini muffins and they are quickly disappearing.  It took 20 minutes and they popped out easily.  I'll freeze a few to see if they work in the freezer - and do an update!

Excellent treat. It really does taste like a donut. The recipe makes exactly 24 muffins. You don't need half the topping. Best to make 1/2 of the topping mixture.

I made these in normal sized miffin tins, and found that if you double the recipe, you will get a complete 12 large muffins.  I thought the batter ingredients were unique b/c there is no egg.  Make sure your baking powder is fresh!  Also, I would say that these reminded me fo doughnuts, but more so coffee cake. Really great and perfect for brunch! And I loved the nutmeg amount.  Can't wait to make some for my friends!

Very good and easy to make, with simple on-hand ingredients. Only changes I made were to decrease the nutmeg to 1/2 teas. & add 1/2 teas. cinnamon. Also, instead of margarine for the topping, I just sprayed ICBINB (can't believe it's not butter) spray on the tops & rolled in cinnamon sugar... yum! I made these to take to my neighbors, but unfortunately, they never made it there! :)

Yummy!  The nutmeg flavor in these muffins is wonderful.  I think they taste even better than donut holes...probably healthier too!  They were super easy to make (my 18 month old even helped) and came out nice and moist.

I thought these were pretty good, especially the outside coating. I wasn't a huge fan of the nutmeg inside. I may would try cinnamon and vanilla flavoring next time. I didn't have mini muffin pans, so I made 11 of them in a mini fluted Bundt pan tin. They had the hole in the center and looked like real donuts! Very cute.  Update - After eating a few of these, I discovered the that ones that soaked in butter the longest (getting ready for the sugar coating) were by far the best tasting ones!

I didn't expect too much from this recipe - but, needed something quick to make for breakfast after coming home from vacation and didn't have much in the house.  Yum, Yum, Yum!  What a surprise.  They were so good and everyone gobbled them up.  I will definitely make again.

Yummy! I had a sweet craving in the middle of the afternoon, and these were so easy to make! The only change I made was to add a bit of cinnamon to the batter as well. Great recipe I'll be making often.

These were wonderful!!!  I made these for my son who came home from college.  His comment was, "keep this recipe...they taste like cinnamon toast crunch!"  I did pull out all the stops...used butter instead of margarine, used one tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon...it was wonderful.  I also make the outside powder more cinnamon than sugar...we call these "doe-fins"

These were very tasty little buggers.  They work fine in a normal sized muffin tin- it gives you 6 muffins. I might add a touch less nutmeg next time.  They seem to be the best when you let them get a little bit crispy in the oven and then dip them in the margarine/cinnamon sugar.  Very good and very quick and easy!

The batch is gone--only minutes from the pan!  Hubby ate two, so that means it's a successful winner here.  My son's family did in the rest within moments of my arrival at their house.  I like how easy they are to throw together!  Thanks, Dianne!

These were really easy to make, I like that there were few ingredients and I was surprised at how light they came out.  I used butter instead of margerine because it was all I had.  Next time I make these I will reduce the nutmeg probably to 1/2 tsp because I don't care for nutmeg all that much.  But I wll try these again and maybe even make them with all cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!

I made these following the recipe except I used butter instead of margarine.  I really liked them better the next day.  My teenagers didn't care for them at all.  I think it was the nutmeg.  I was getting bored dipping the tops so I dumped the cooled muffins in a ziplock bag, poured the melted butter in zipped it closed and tossed gently.  Than I poured them out into a bowl, poured in the cinnamon and sugar and tossed.  they didn't break up at all!

These are fantastic!! Easy, fast, ingredients always on hand, perfect flavor and texture...I can go on and on...We love them. I decided to make these in a regular size cupcake tin, so I doubled the recipe and yielded 12, which is perfect for my family of 8. Served as dessert this evening and everyone gave rave reviews. Can't wait until Saturday morning. These are on the menu again. Thank you for sharing!

I was going to send the leftovers to work, but I see there won't be any leftovers.  I used butter and made 24 mini muffins.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will make it over and over.

Oh yes, I agree with the majority of reviews....these are addicting. It's hard to just eat one. I followed the recipe to a T, except for using butter instead of margarine and got exactly 24 mini donut muffins. So easy to make and so hard to stop eating!!

Ten minutes after I made these for my family they were gone, and everyone was begging for more. I think these are best served warm wile the butter is still melty. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe and they came out awesome!  They were so easy to make and I will definitely make them again.  There was a little bit of cinnamon sugar left so I set it aside for future use.

Easy and tasty! Definitely will make these again! I only added a couple of drops of pure vanilla extract because, well, Mom puts vanilla in most of her baked goods and she's fantabulous! So are these muffins.

From all the fab reviews, I was really looking forward to trying these.  I followed the recipe as is, but I was honestly disappointed.  They make an ok muffin.  I do have one kid that liked them, another that was happy to lick the sugar/cinnamon mix off the muffin, and two more kids who just thought they were "yucky".  Not sure what all the hype is about.

I just made these and this recipe is excellent.  Using muffin pans, the recipe donut-muffin was chewy inside, but had crunchy edges outside.  We personally found the nutmeg to be a bit overpowering, and will reduce down to 1/2 tsp or less next time.   I took another reader's suggestion and rather than make the melted cinnamon sugar icing, I put 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in a brown bag.  As I pulled the donut-muffins out of their pan hot from the oven, I tossed them in the brown bag, and let the kids shake them up.  Truly delicious and fast breakfast recipe, thank you SO MUCH for posting this.

Loved these! Followed the recipe as written using my 24 mini muffin pan. I filled them half way and baked 13 minutes as my oven runs hot, they turned out perfect! Thanks for a fast, easy recipe to make when that late night sweet craving kicks in.

I made a few minor changes with great results - I doubled the recipe and made 12 regular size muffins. I divided the batter in half and partially filled the muffin pan, added a half teaspoon of jelly and topped that with the remaining batter. And though I was tempted to do the butter and cinnamon sugar dipping after baking, I knew I would hate the sticky fingers so I just sprinkled the sugar mixture on the batter before baking. Will definitely be making these over and over again!

I have made this 3 times in a week and all I can say is HOLY DONUTS!!! If left to sit in an airtight container for 6 hours or so, these little beauties soften up and taste just like the donuts we get at the fair from the Holy donut wagon. My family really liked them the first time but loved them  after I cut the nutmeg down to 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter. I also cut the melted butter to 2 Tablespoons for dipping, it was more than enough. It only took 13 minutes to bake so watch them closely after 12 minutes.

I made these muffins today and they were very good. Next time I will use less butter. This recipe is very handy, you can put everything together very quick and voila! You have muffins made of staples and you don't even need eggs. As far as plagiarism is concerned, nowdays it's very hard to find out who is the recipe "owner". Some recipes are passed from friends to friends, from mothers to daughters, who knows where the recipe came from? I would not be so severe meanly because it's just a recipe. Let's not be petty.

Followed the recipe and video exactly.  Muffins stuck to bottom of inspite of being WELL sprayed w/ oil.
Didn't have good flavor or texture.  Dipped right out of the pan into butter and then cin-sugar mix.  These are a disappointment.  That I almost wouldn't send into the ER w/ my husband-- they eat everything.

These were great!  I'm not a fan of nutmeg so used a little less and they were really good!  To the poster who complained that this recipe is plagiarism I think that is ridiculous!  I would venture to guess that 80%-90% of the recipes on ANY recipe site are the same as you can find anywhere else.  I know when I compare recipes I find the exact recipe on many sites and magazines.  Or maybe a tiny variation.  This is called sharing.  Nothing on here says the recipe has to be an original.  It would be a very small site if it did.  Thank you, Diane, for sharing!

I thought these turned out great!  I got exactly 24 tiny muffins and I thought it was kind of funny because I bought these tiny tins to make chocolates and never ever thought to put muffins in them.  Probably need to reduce the time by a couple of minutes for my oven as a few of them were a bit crispy on the bottom.  Thanks for a great recipe!

You  don't know how many times I've used this recipe.  It's great, and I like the use of inexpensive margarine instead of butter which works perfectly in this.

Yummy, yummy, yummy, oh did I mention YUMMY??? lol  the only change I made was i used real butter.  Definitely a keeper, my family loved them, I made 2 batches as I didn't get 24, I used my pampered chef cookie scoop to measure batter, that could be what made the difference?  Thank you Dianne for the great recipe!! I think I will experiment with a glaze too?? AWESOME!!

giving these 5 stars. This is the perfect recipe for a busy mother with kids that LOVE donuts. They were super easy, super yummy and super cute as well. I have a normal size mini muffin pan and it only made batches of 18. I made these bad boys two days in a row by request from my 9 year old son. Storing this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it!

Ok, why did I make these?!! I can't stop eating them. It's 930pm and I had every intention to make these for my boys for breakfast. Oh well, they can have cereal. Actually these are so easy to whip up, I'll make another batch for them ;) I followed the recipe except I used butter and got 24 in my mini muffin pan. Also I think I'll decrease the baking time to maybe 12 min. - 15 got a little too brown in my oven.  These are awesome. I will try different topping next. So good! Thanks for sharing the recipe

I made these today and i just I loved this recipe, i did add and extra 2 Tablespoon of milk as i found the batter a little too stiff. I have a mini donut pan and used that. I put the batter into a piping bag with a wide opening and piped the batter into the pan to insure even distribution. They baked in 13 minutes. I did dunk some in the cinnamon sugar but i also melted some chocolate, dipped the tops in to cover and then sprinkled some sprinkles on top of the chocolate. They looked and tasted AMAZING!!! A definite favorite in this house.

I loved these pseudo doughnuts; they fit the bill for a quick  fun delightful treat!!!!
Followed recipe to the "t". And they were fantastic.....I doubled the recipe as I only have standard size tins.....perfect!!!   I myself love nutmeg so added a tad more.....scrumptious .....everyone loved them!   A nice treat for the holidays. Thank you for this quick,  fool proof, recipe.

Sinful, easy, fast - what more can I say?  I, too, used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice for a total of 1/2 tsp of spice; I also did not use the melted butter in the final step for the coating, using just the cinn-sugar mixture.  These are so quick to whip up for a treat anytime! Yumfest!

I tried this because of the excellent reviews. It is very bland. Needs salt??  I added a bit more sugar and it still was NOT enough.  maybe we just like our muffins sweet. I also added vanilla .

Muffins stuck to pan too.  Not sure why.  I sprayed liberally.

The dough for this tastes ridiculously good.  It'll be a wonder if you can get the batter into the pans.  The only thing about these is that they are very tender so make certain they are completely cool and stable before dipping them in the warm butter (I avoid margerine wherever possible as it consists of the chemical compound for plastic).  I tried to follow the instructions as-is and the muffins practially exploded when dipped.  Completely cool makes a big difference.

It wasn't as fantastic as I thought it would be.  From all the positive reviews I figured it would be.  I made it exactly as written and it was nothing special.  I am not at all a picky person and I don't think I will make these again.  Once they were room temperature it tasted like an unflavored muffin :/  I didn't get a donut taste at all.

These were simple and cheap to make.  They were rather tasty, but I agreed with the other reviewer who said that they would cut down on the nutmeg.  It was definitely too strong and overpowered the other ingredients.  I will make these again in the future (because they were tasty) but will use less nutmeg next time.

These were excellent! Mine came out a little crisp on the bottoms - I checked them at 15 minutes and thought they could use another couple minutes.  In hindsight, I should have taken them out at 15, before they turned too golden brown.  Regardless, they are still tasty!  I used butter, and follow the recipe exactly.  After a little rearranging of the batter (remember to fill only HALF way!), I ended up with 24 mini-muffins.  I used a really nice Saigon Vietnamese cinnamon.  Next time I think I will add a pinch if nutmeg to the topping also.  Great recipe!

Very yummy!  These made exactly 24 mini muffins for me.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use soy milk instead of regular milk.  I also cut down on the nutmeg, used maybe 1/8 of a teaspoon.

These were good, not out-of-this-world as I was hoping but definitely good.  Made them as written and they were gone in minutes after removing from the oven.  Would be perfect for a brunch or breakfast for guests but would definitely need to make more.

Pretty fantastic. The nutmeg does add a really unique flavor, but I too felt there was far too much of it. I'm not sure if this is because I used pre-ground vs. fresh ground, as this could make a difference. No worries though, these are SO fast and easy to make, I tried a batch with 1/4 tsp of nutmeg which was just right for me. You could whip up a batch every morning if you were so inclined.... which I just might be.

I used butter instead of margarine to make these, and even though I used 1/4 teaspoon of nut meg and added some vanilla extract they were so bland that was all I could taste was the nutmeg. Very disappointed with the end product.

Awesome!!! I LOVED them and so did my family. Some of the other reviewers suggested that you only dip the tops in sugar so I did some with just the tops dipped and some with the whole thing dipped. Excellent either way. I will be making these over and over again. Make sure to make more than one batch because they will be gone in seconds!!! Thanks for this delicious recipe!!

I really thought these little guys would be a winner, but not so for my family of 5. We love, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg! I found the flavor bland even with the topping. I will prob have to through them out :( Super easy recipe though!

I didn't care for the amount of nutmeg so I may reduce that next time.  That being said, these were good the first day and even better the second!  I removed the muffins immediately from the pan, transferred to a bowl, drizzled with the butter, and then shook them in a bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture.

I'm a very experienced baker and I followed this recipe exactly, although my muffins baked in only 15 minutes. Somehow, I ended up with dry, bland, coarse muffins with a texture similar to corn bread. They also tasted nothing like donuts. I only made one batch and ended up throwing the rest of the batter away.

These are so delicious for breakfast or a quick snack!  Based on some previous reviews, I wanted to share my thoughts:  first, I used some old Mirro aluminum mini pans that I found at a yard sale....the best ever, and they work better than the set of non-stick ones I own.  I used the smalled Pampered Chef scoop and the recipe yielded EXACTLY 24 mini muffins.  About the nutmeg.  If you use a high quality spice (I used Penzey's), you can get away with 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  If you have old or "store brand" spices, use the full amount specified in the recipe.

These muffins were very easy and quick to whip together.  However, I found the taste to be very OK. Overall, I was disappointed. A very sugary muffin that wasn't quite worth the calories for me.

Boy, are these little things yummy! They DO taste like cinnamon donut holes! I used butter, not margarine, and 1-1/2 teaspoons of fresh grated nutmeg (sounds like a lot, but fresh nutmeg is fluffy, and unlike ground nutmeg.)  I made 20 mini muffins. I used 3 tablespoons of butter for the topping, it was too much. I'll use 2 tablespoons next time. I will be making these again soon! I'm also going to try them with rice flour (instead of all purpose) for a gluten-free muffin. I love that they don't have egg in them. UPDATE 5/24/11: made these with (white) rice flour this morning for a gluten-free muffin, and let me tell you, they are GREAT!

AWESOME recipe! I made it in a normal sized pan, and it made about 6 normal sized muffins per recipe for me. All the children (there were 7) loved them and ate them up, I made 24. Will be making over and over!

Lovely, easy, fast.... great recipe!  Definitely let them cool before eating (if you can manage!) as the taste and texture are perfect at that time.  Only thing I changed was they got coated in the margarine/sugar mix rather than just the tops dipped.  Made it more like those donuts you get at the carnivals!   Thanks!

Love these!  Especially good still warm from the oven.  I do recommend storing leftovers in the fridge, as I didn't, and they tasted funky a day later.

The concept is good, I took the advice of one and cut back on the nutmeg by 1/4 tsp, but i think that was a mistake.  While they tastes good, I could only taste a hint of nutmeg and my were a little on the hard side.  Perhaps I over baked a touch, or are they suppose to be that way.  I will try again.

Great after school snack. This isn't a razzle and dazzle recipe it is a good fun snack recipe. We used light brown sugar instead of white sugar in the topping. "mmmm wow"

these were very good. they were a bit nutmeg heavy, i think i'll reduce it to 1/2 tsp next time, but they were still delicious! since i wasn't rolling the whole muffin in cinnamon sugar (i used cupcake liners), i increased the amount of cinnamon in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. they were a hit at my brunch!

I would do 4 1/2 stars if I could, yum!.  Super easy and so, so tasty.  I found that my small mini muffin tins were perfect (I got more than 24 because I wanted them smaller-mine is from Pampered Chef).  You really want to fill them just to halfway so that the donuts are small and do not become mushroom-topped.  This also keeps them nicely bite-sized but watch that you do not bake them too long.  
I actually recommend baking them just to doneness and while they are yummy warm, they are SO good if done a day in advance or atleast let them sit for several hours.  Not sure why but they got better with time.  Thank you for a great treat Dianne!

Hubby just loved these. Said they taste like good donuts used to taste.  I used a regular size muffin pan and ended up with 9.  I messed up the dip by mixing all together and used it like frosting.  Worked out fine.  Thanks for another keeper.

Way, way too much nutmeg!  Cut in half.  Also, the cinnamon/sugar/margarine topping needs cut in half as well.

Made quickly for my kids this morning....think less nutmeg next time. My picky daughter didn't care for them, but my sugar lover daughter had no problem devouring them even the ones I made with glaze (which I think I used too much vanilla). Ok, and similar to cinnamon toast - which I would rather have

Wow, who knew this short list of ingredients could make something so tasty!  I put in the full amount of nutmeg and thought it was perfect.  So yummy!  Thanks so much for sharing, I'll be making frequently.

This didn't taste as good as I thought it would be after reading all these reviews. I was hoping that it would taste more like a donut than a muffin, but it didn't. I should've listened to the other reviews and cut down on the nutmeg. I am a fan of nutmeg, but the amount called in this recipe made it way too overpowering. I felt like I could've cut down on the sugar as well. Also, you can probably cut the cinnamon sugar mixture by half. I think if I make this again, I'll go ahead and roll the dough in the cinnamon sugar before baking - then it'll taste like a snickerdoodle muffin!

I made these using an electric mini muffin maker. Well, I won't do that again! They took forever to make 5 at a time, and the edges were hard. BUT they tasted great. (I did cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. per other reviews, and used 2 TBS. melted butter to coat.)

I followed this recipe to the T and it was surely a success..Made 2 batches of them which dint last more than a couple of hours..Was slightly confused if I should use granulated or powdered sugar.So while coating, I used granulated for one batch and powdered for another..Everybody liked the granulated one better..Simple yet great recipe..Thank you Dianne...

I finally got around to making these yesterday.  My 4 year old helpd - it is a very simple recipe.  I did add a bit of vanilla and I halved the nutmeg cause I find the flavour to be too much sometimes.  that was definitely enough nutmeg for my liking and I'm glad I halved it!  once they came out of the oven, I dipped the tops in melted butter, then tossed them in a baggie with the cinnamon and sugar mix.  these are a great little sweet treat that's easy to whip up anytime!!

Wow, I am not so sure why the rating on this recipe is so high.  I followed it to the T...  I think part of the let down came from the fact that I have used a far better recipe. This recipe has WAY too much nutmeg and without any eggs...wrong texture.  It is more like a soggy pancake than a cake donut texture.  Also, it calls for no salt so it doesn't have a strong, bold flavor...just kind of sweet blah without that dash of salt.  Won't make again, will go back to the recipe that is much better IMPO.  Thought I would give this one a try since the ratings were so high...disappointed.

These donut muffins were pretty good, but i was expecting something more from all the great reviews. The muffins had a nice taste with the cinnamon and nutmeg and came out really cute. For my mini muffins it only took about 10 minutes though.

I really liked these donut muffins.  They were super easy to make and quite tasty.  I will definitely be making these again.   

Based on other reviews, I did make one change to the original recipe, and I am glad that I did.  I reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  It was perfect...if I used 3/4 tsp as the original recipe recommended, I think it would have been a bit too much.  

After my first try at these, I will probably make a few more changes the next time I make them.  I will continue to just use 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I will also reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar to half.  There was just too much - I still had quite a bit left over and felt that they were still way too sweet. The cinnamon sugar overpowered the taste of the donut muffins - I couldn't even taste the dough...just the cinnamon sugar.  Next time, I think that I'll just add it to the tops of the donut muffins, rather than all over.  Or, I will brush the muffins with the butter an sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on top of them.  

Also, watch the baking time.  I started with 15 minutes and it was good...20 would have been too much.  I am glad that the poster of this recipe gave a pretty decent range for the cooking time.

These were pretty good.  5 stars for being super easy and fun to make (my 4 & 2 year-olds did the dipping and sugar coating).  As for taste, prior to the sugar coating, they were a little off.  I'd give them 3 stars.  Way too much nutmeg I think.  The coating mostly masked that in the end.  Without the nutmeg, these would be 5 stars.

They were very good but needed less nutmeg and maybe a little cinnamon in the batter! I also think it needed more baking powder since they did not rise enough for me! But it is a very easy homemade treat!

These are so delicious! The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I cut the nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon, since I am not a huge fan of nutmeg and I love cinnamon. These little treats are so addictive! I made them last night and cannot stop eating them. I do want to add, however, that mine ended up a slight bit over-cooked, and they were only in for ten minutes.

I was disappointed with these muffins.  But, I didn't have mini muffin pans, so I made regular sized muffins.  Maybe it's better with the minis.

These little morsels are amazing!! I will double the batch next time to make more! They are super moist, dense and taste like donuts with out all the guilt. Perfect for breakfast or a late night snack

These were a terrific hit at my parent coffee group at school.  I used grated fresh nutmeg and what a wonderful flavour.  I used my new mini-muffin pan and they turned out great, but the bottoms were a little dark.  Tip: if you have a medium to dark pan, lower the temperature or place muffin pan on a cookie sheet.

Delicious! Make sure that your muffin pan is completely clean if you're baking more than one batch, otherwise they fall apart. I'll be making these OFTEN. Christmas morning for sure.

First of all let me say that they did not taste like any donuts I had ever had but, they were still yummy! I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg because nutmeg tends to over power the taste. Overall the recipe was pretty good. Donut muffins are a delicious little treat to eat.

My rating is for the original recipe which I made the first time. The second time, I added some vanilla (tsp approx) and DEFINITELY CUT the nutmeg, in half. What I really liked about my tweaked version was making them in actual muffin pans as opposed to mini muffin pans. I dont know why but they were SOOO MUCH BETTER I just liked the texture and felt like I was eating an actual donut =P

kids loved them.  Made recipe as stated.  Next time I will probably scale the recipe to 1 1/2 times.  Even making mini-muffins, these turned out super tiny since there didn't seem to be enough batter to go around.

Yeah... these are awesome. Made as directed but did cut down nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. I only got 18 out of this recipe in the mini muffin pan but I am guessing that is due to how I filled them. Took 17 minutes for me. This is a recipe I would make to share at a potluck. Love it! Thanks!

Aloha, I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it came out great.  The only change that I made was to dip and sugar only the top of the "muffin" instead of the whole thing.  I used a small cookie scoop - which made exactly 24.  I had extra dipping butter and sugar left over.  I should have paid attention to the other reviews and made a double batch.  Even my picky husband liked them. I will make these as a Sunday Morning treat for the family.  Thank you for the great recipe!!

Wonderful! I don't have mini muffin pans so I used regular ones. It made 6. So easy! I don't like nutmeg so I substituted cinnimon and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Thanks so much!

Now I don't bake very much but these seemed easy enough. They were very good. I only dipped the top of the muffins in butter and sugar at the end. I love nutmeg but I agree with the others that it seemed a bit much. I will make them again but cut back on the nutmeg. Thanks!

As written the nutmeg flavor is WAY to powerfull for me.  I would cut it down to 1/4 tsp.  I didn't use the butter sugar topping, instead a strinkled powdered sugar over.  I will make these again, but I will not use that much nutmeg.

* Helpful hint:  use a pastry brush to butter the cooled muffins before rolling in cinnamon/sugar mixture.  It puts the perfect amount of butter on the muffin.  Otherwise you can't go wrong with these!  These are sold by Tastefully Simple (Cinnamon Muffin Melt) in a box and are amazingly good.  I'm glad to have found this recipe to make some more much cheaper!  Delicious!!

Fantastic recipe Dianne. You just can't eat just one. I had gotten 23 mini muffins out of the batch so next time I will double the margarine & cinnamon/sugar mixture for the coating. Also, next time I will double the batch.

these "donut muffins" as you put them are more like a stiff biscuit! and they dont taste like a muffin or a donut. they look unappealing as well, almost nothing like the picture, i followed it to the T and was really disappointed with the results! Ecspecially after so many "great" reveiws, i was left unimpressed and uninspired. I wont make these ever again!

I was really dissapointed in these!  With all the good reviews I thought these were going to be fabulous.  I agree with previous reviewer - they're dull!  The nutmeg flavor is way too overpowering but without that they would have no flavor.  The cinnamon sugar didn't even help.  They don't taste like donuts to me!  I won't make these again!

These were so good! To make them more like a jelly donut i filled them with a little strawberry jelly. I used a decorating bag with a round tip and inserted it small amount of jelly into each muffin. Yum.

We didn't care for these when made as written.  Very strong nutmeg flavor, greasy from dipping in butter, and gritty from the white sugar.

This recipe is TO DIE FOR! I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, cream for milk (because that's all I had) and added a splash of vanilla.  These little devils are impossible to resist. FINALLY, a way to make those yummy mini donuts you find at the carnival at home. Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe with us!

Oh my goodness.  This was perfect for me.  I love the fact there are no eggs in this recipe.  I got 24 mini donut muffins that were crispy like outside tender inside and had such yummy flavor for such simple ingredients.  I loved the nutmeg in the donut - if you don't love nutmeg then just sub cinnamon.  There should be no reason to not love this donut!  Thank you Dianne!!

I loved these muffins!  Very tasty, nice "cake donut" texture and the nutmeg is delicious.  I did not use extra butter when rolling these in the sugar, just rolled them while they were still warm and the cinnamon/sugar mixture stuck just fine.

So good and simple!  I used applesauce instead of margarine in the muffins, which made them denser.  Will definitely make again.

with so many reviews in so few days, I felt the urge to try these. Very easy, tasy and quick to make. I dipped the tops of the muffins in melted butter, then in the sugar and cinnamon. They did not remind me of sugared doughnut holes, but they were good, will make again and thanks for sharing

My son said they were "ok" but he kept coming back to get more...4 times! I do think they need a half teaspoon of salt. Great with tea or coffee!

Everyday brought new pictures of this recipe to the voting page, so I thought I had to give it a try to see just what all the fuss was about (even though I really didn't have the time to bake today LOL !!!).  I followed the recipe as wrote although I doubled all ingredients to bake a larger batch.  This made me 36 mini muffins.  I used Butter instead of margarine and reduced the ground nutmeg by 1/3.  These really do taste amazing, a big shout out to Dianne's Grandma for this fabulous recipe.

I thought these were really good!! I had a couple minor problems... when I dipped the first one in butter, it tasted like raw dough dipped in butter and cinnamon sugar!!! So I didn't dip the rest in butter first, and then they tasted great!! I only had one muffin tin, so I tried to divide the dough into 12, but that did NOT work!!! They were overflowing to begin with!! So, when I took them out of the oven, the tops separated from the bottoms when I tried to get them out of the pan!!! So next time, I'll make more than 12, grease the pan better, and not dip them in butter!!! (oh, I also added half of the nutmeg:))

These were super easy to make and so delicious. For those of you in the Toronto area; they are a lot like Tiny Tom donuts from the Ex when they are hot! I will definitely make these again and again; great recipe.

Such neat little treats!  If you can't make it to your local apple orchard for cider and donuts, this is the next best thing.  They are super easy and the ingredients are always on hand.

In mini muffin pans, there will be a yield of between 17 and 24 muffins. I over-filled the cups and still got 17. They are yummy, and terribly easily popped in your mouth, as Paula has warned. So, heeding the warning, I used apple sauce for the muffin margarine, but used butter for the dip and dip topping. These were fast, easy, and are pretty as the pictures. I imagine the butter/margarine in the muffin would be the tastier option (as written). Thanks for posting.

was really excited about these, and I wanted to give them 5 stars, but for me there was just something missing. There were no eggs or salt in the recipe, which i thought was odd, but i don't think that was it. they are very fluffy and I was expecting something a little more 'cakey'. Regardless...a very good recipes, kids will surely love these and not nearly as sinful as a fried donut hole.

I made these the day before the Recipe Group voted on them for their weekly recipe, but I failed to take a picture. I thought about making them again and taking a picture, but I really can't.  They are too addictive!  I would eat the whole batch...by myself!  Since I am on a diet right now, I just can't afford it.  Just remember, I warned you!!!

These are Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (using margarine and I'd like to add that so far, I have Not found a "light" version that works good for baking. I used regular "Gold'n Soft Margarine" (can we mention product names?) and these turned out Sooo Yummy! I made them yesterday afternoon? Gone today and I'm now right back here reading the recipe to make another batch this morning ^_^

Gluten Free version.  These are soooooo delicious.  I practically ate all of them myself while waiting for the next batch to finish in the oven.  I ended up having to make 2 other batches round robin style when my daughter tasted them and then invited all her friends over.  Addictive little buggers.  My GF version recipe is in my recipe box if you are interested.  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic recipe. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg because I didn't have it. I also used a regular cupcake tin instead of a mini muffin tin. If doing so be warned you must double the recipe for 12 cupcake sized muffins. I loved this recipe. Will make again many times.

I liked this recipe, but next time I'm going to reduce the nutmeg. Probably just 1/2 tsp is all that's needed, unless you really like a strongly spiced treat. All in all, though, the kids and the wife really liked them.

I used this recipe to make mini donuts with my donut maker.  Excellent. Like another reviewer did I used pumpkin pie spice because that's what I had and it worked nicely.  I also skipped the last step and instead of dipping them in melted butter I dipped them in powdered sugar thinned with milk to form a glaze.  I then dipped them in a mixture of different sprinkles, confetti sprinkles and finely chopped peanuts.

Turned out great and very easy to make. Next time I will pour melted butter on a plate instead of a bowl. "Dipping" the muffins in butter caused them to have too much of the sugar mixture for me. Also little tip...I cut about a one inch cube of butter and put it on a fork. Use this to grease the mini muffin pans. No mess.

it was a little bland and dry. the nutmeg was kind of a lot (I used 1/2 tsp) and I think it needs vanilla. I didnt need even half the amount of butter and cinnamon sugar for the topping.

I don't have a mini-muffin pan so i made this with a reg muffin pan but these were still super good very crispy and tasty, I assume the little muffin pan gives time real 'doughut' taste...I found this really messy though and too much trouble, they do not sit well either...you have to eat them pretty much right after baking them or they grow soggy or stale. Still a delicious treat for on the spot.

This is definitely a 5 star recipe. Me & my wife just loved these muffins. The only small change we made to the recipe was to use a regular muffin tin instead of the mini-muffin tins (because we don't have one). In our oven with the convection setting on 20 minutes was just right @350F

I baked the first batch for my coworkers as a tester, they were so easy to make that I woke up early and whipped up a second batch before work. I think the batter needs a little more flavor for my tastes but it's yummy as is. 

My changes: I used cinnamon because I forget to buy nutmeg. With the first batch I forget to melt the butter for the batter, that produced the same end result but, the batter resembled more of a normal lumpy muffin textured batter. I have an electric oven, so I had to rescued the baking time to 15 minutes max. I generously sprayed my pan with Professional grade Pam but they kinda stuck a little, a little nudge with the pairing knife popped em right out. I kept the butter warm during the dipping process(10 seconds in the microwave), and I noticed the cinnamon/sugar mixture stuck better to the muffin. I used my mini muffin tin and ended up with 26-28 minis after filling each 1/2 way. My pan makes mini muffin/baby cupcakes(lol). My coworkers gobbled up the muffins & my sons loved them. Thanks Dianne!

These little nibbles were so delicious and easy to make.  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of 3/4t, and only dipped the tops in butter/sugar/cinnamon.  My family couldn't get enough...I couldn't get enough.  And they are better the next day - if you have any left!

Made these little bites of sweetness today for the first time.  I like the simplicity of the recipe.  However, I am glad I read a few reviews first, as I cut down a bit on the nutmeg to 1/2 a teaspoon.  Needless to say the next time I make them, I will double the recipe.  They were a hit!  Would make them again, anytime.

It is a fabulous recipe I especially love the nutmeg in it. They're a great warm breakfast on a cold winter morning. Hope you try them!

These came out great and they were easy to make.  I lightened the recipe by not dunking the muffins in butter at the end.  Instead, I used butter flavor cooking spray to grease the pan and sprayed the tops lightly when they came out of the oven. The sugar and cinnamon stuck and the muffins were crunchy and not greasy.

REALLY GOOD! I am out of most grocery items and my son is allergic to dairy, so I substituted oil for the first amount of margarine. And I used half almond milk, half water for the milk. I skipped the margarine in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and instead shook the muffins in a paper bag with some cinnamon sugar I had on hand. They were excellent! I'm sure they taste even better with milk and margarine/butter, and I am looking forward to trying them with vegan margarine and almond or coconut milk after I do groceries.

These are delightful little dreams. Not that it needs another 5 star review but it really does deserve it. I think Dianne is right when she says the secret is in the nutmeg. I found it hard to stay out of these little buggers. I shared with others and they were gone in no time. I substituted butter as I never buy margarine - gotta have the real thing. Thanks Dianne!

I used fresh grated nutmeg and used real butter for dipping the cinnamon sugar topping for the recipe.  I cold barely even swallow without gagging.  I could taste the margarine in the batter and along with the overwhelming taste of nutmeg made it unbearable. 
I am not a novice baker and I like nutmeg. This recipe just called for too much of a good thing. I guess it could be very different with the pre-ground nutmeg, but I don't purchase nutmeg that way. Even if I used real butter in the batter and less nutmeg, I just don't think it would be worth the ingredients to make it again.

Good recipe.  I used only 1/4 tsp nutmeg and that was plenty. I also cut back the sugar by about a third. Next time I make these, I'll raise the temperature to 375f, and bake them for about 10 mins only.  These little guys shouldn't need 15-20 minutes and that may be why they dry out.

These are absolutely delicious!  The only slight change I made is that I found I needed a little more melted margarine to dunk them in and then roll in the cinnamon sugar.  They were a huge hit!

omg!! a perfect sweet muffin. I followed the recipe exactly except i did back off the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp as another viewer did. My guys are weird about that type of spice. Perfectly flavorful and textured. I did make these in a regular muffin pan instead of the mini, and I got 9 perfect sized muffins. Use a little Pam and they popped right out while hot. The texture is just right that mine didn't fall apart as some others mentioned. They rolled and dipped with no problem. I baked these for 20 mintues and that was perfect for my oven. These are better than bought doughnuts! A wonderful keeper for sure!!!!

I have made this recipe 3 times over the past week and a half....my family loves them!  Made regular-size muffins...a triple recipe makes 2 dozen in my pans.  Added about 1 tsp. salt plus 2 tsp. vanilla extract plus about 3/4 tsp. lemon extract to the tripled recipe - really gives them that great donut flavor.  Used stick margarine (Imperial) in the batter, but used real butter to dip the muffin tops at the end.  Took the muffins out of their paper cups for dipping and coating with the cinnamon sugar, while still warm.  Also rolled some of them in powdered sugar instead....really yummy...taste just like donuts!  So good with coffee in the morning!!

Tasted great, light and fluffy.  I used buttermilk and 1/2 tsp ea baking soda and baking powder.  Used about 1 tsp butter and brushed over the tops only, then dipped in cinnamon sugar. Not too sweet but lots of flavor.  Next time will make as regular muffins and try to eat just one!

I made these in a mini donut pan. I decided not to add the sugar coating,  My husband and I loved these, but my kids were not big fans.... they probably would have liked it better with the sugar coating.

Just made these and they are a hit. I made two batches. I lessoned the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon in first batch and second batch I only put 1/4 teaspoon. I also did a vanilla glaze instead of the sugar cinnamon. I will definately make them again.

I made as instructed a few times, and then tried using whole wheat flour and brown sugar. They were just as amazing. I also halve the amount of sugar used to coat them in, because otherwise they are too sweet for my personal taste. That said, my kids and husband LOVE them. I always make a double batch, and they're gone in a day.

My 4 year old son loved these, and I can't believe how similar they are to donut holes.  He wanted chocolate so I opened a packet of hot cocoa mix and we added some to the coating. A little sweet for me but he was very happy.  Best warm out of the oven or reheated a few seconds in the microwave.  Nice texture and flavor, can't go wrong.

Okay, I don't like donuts as a generally rule, but the other people who live with me do.  These seemed easy, and I felt like baking...and I CAN be nice, so I decided to make them tonight for breakfast in the morning.  They are incredibly easy to make, that is for sure.  So, like any good cook, I had to try my creation.  Now I am typing this with sugary fingers, after just having finished my 4th muffin!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, using butter and also freshly grated nutmeg.  I found that I only needed to bake them for about 11-12 minutes for them to get nicely browned.  I see in other reviews that some found the amount of nutmeg to be overpowering.  On the contrary, I found these muffins to be rather delicate in flavor.  They are light and airy, rather than dense.  Perfectly pop-able!  I think I will try different types of toppings, maybe a glaze.  But these are delightfully tasty just as written.  Thanks for a great recipe, Dianne :)

These were just alright. They're slightly reminiscent of a similar recipe also on AR, French Breakfast Muffins, which I like better. Used only 1/4 tsp nutmeg (a little goes a long way) and added a few shakes of cinnamon right into the batter. Anytime you bake with melted butter as opposed to softened, creamed butter, you'll get a drier, more crumbly outcome, which these muffins delivered. With a rather Bisquick-y texture, these were fine dunked in my morning coffee. My 4 year-old had no complaints, however, these probably won't be a repeat.

I added an egg which for some reason was not in the recipe, a tsp of salt, and 1 tsp white vinegar in the 1/2 cup milk. These muffins were then outstanding. Also, instead of melting butter and dipping in cinn/sugar I sprinkled on a cinnamon / sugar mixture before baking. Just wonderful...

These are tasty AS IS!  I've made these a number of times now and they are great--you don't NEED to change anything.  However, DH is diabetic, so I've made some changes based on this. I use whole wheat flour (Nutri-Blend - looks white with the goodness of Whole Wheat) and Splenda in the mix. I add cinnamon, a pinch of salt, a little vanilla and a 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to cut the taste of the bkg powder/Splenda in the mixture.  When the muffins are baked, we prefer brown sugar instead of white to roll them in.  We LOVE these!

I think the recipe called for too much nutmeg.  It has a strong flavor anyway.  If I made this again, I would cut the nutmeg in half.  Overall, it was easy to put together and the kids enjoyed it.

This is a great easy recipe. Its quick too!  I only used half the nutmeg because I grated fresh.  I also spooned the butter over the donuts in the pat before I put them in the sugar/cinnamon sugar.  I used less butter and cut the fat.  Thanks for sharing!

All of us loved this recipe......if you are craving donuts and don't want to go to the donut shop or don't have a bakery in town.......these muffin-holes satisfy...esp. with a cup of great coffee!  Bonus:  no EGGS for my son who has an egg allergy!

I just love this recipe.  It makes a lot. Super easy to throw together (no bringing out the big mixer ) and easy follow.  I cut the nutmeg down to just 1/4 t or even less, and up the vanilla a tad. Dipping in butter and rolling in the cinn/sugar is a MUST ! Yum !!

I was looking for a recipe that had ingredients I already had at my house. This one was it! I made them in a full-muffin pan and it made six of them perfectly. Used a pastry brush to put butter on them and rolled them in cinnaom-sugar. My family absolutely loved them! Definitely will be making these yummy treats again. I don't have a mini-muffin pan so I just cut the regular-sized muffins into fours. FANTASTIC!

My husband and kids love em'! I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg instead of 3/4 tsp because nutmeg is such a strong spice and I personally do not like it. Will make these again!

I doubled the recipe and made normal size muffins.  I didn't have nutmeg so used pumpkin pie spice and it was great.  i also put half the batter in the muffin pan and then a small scoop of strawberry jam and then used the rest of the batter onto of the jam in each muffin.  Turned out great.  Super sweet muffins though :-)

These were just ok for me...a little heavier than donut holes but not as tasty.

I made 2 versions of these. 

The first, was a simple maple syrup (home made)  substitute to be thematic with spring. I rubbed the warm tops with butter and sprinkled mixed cinnamon sugar over the tops from a shaker. These were a huge hit with the kids. 

For a Vegan version - I again substituted maple syrup for the sugar, but also olive oil for the butter and almond milk for the milk. They had amazing flavor but lost the donut-like consistency. They were a little more scone like, but very delicious.

I made these in my regular muffin tins because I don't have minis.  I think my regular tins are a bit smaller than usual anyway.  I got 7 muffins out of this recipe.  I made as directed except for after they were out of the oven.  While they were hot, I brushed them with 1 T of melted butter and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  They don't have as much sugar topping as prescribed this way but that's okay.  I as making them for a friend who is diabetic so less sugar is good for them.  Thanks!

Delicious and simple, doesn't get any better!  It was the exact amount to fill all 24 cups with no leftover batter.  And, once baked, there were no leftover muffins to store because we ate them all.

Love these! I made these several years ago and (I don't know how) missed the part about mini muffins (or chose to ignore that part) These are best as minis! And, there's no such thing as having too much butter (and please use real butter, don't insult them with margarine) or cinnamon sugar, you're just not dredging them enough! Roll them all around in the butter and sugar, keep re-rolling them til they won't hold any more cinnamon sugar! Yum, yum, yum!  I added about 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla also. Magnifique!!

I was very skeptical at first since the recipe calls for no eggs. I figured eggless muffins would have the texture of cardboard but I gave it a try and absolutely loved the results! The recipe was on point - I didn't have to change a thing. The donut muffins came out super moist and not too sweet. Just perfect.

Just made these with the help of my 4 yr old g'son. I already had a recipe for these but the quanity was more than I wanted. Thought I found the recipe here and decided I would be lazy and let this site calculate the reduced measurements. Well, I did not find it here but I did find this one. They are tasty but I will add an egg next time because I think it needs it. For those that cannot have eggs this is for you.

Really simple and easy. But i have to note that 15 mins @ 375 was way too long.  I pulled them out with 4 mins left and they were still overdone.  Will try 350 next time.  Might cut back the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. and add a little cinnamon to the batter cause these really didn't need the extra butter and sugar on top! Also we made in a 24 muffin tin and there didn't seem to be enough batter.  May fill to 3/4 of the way next time and dust with powdered sugar.  One last thing the measurements for the topping are a bit excessive. I'd cut back the amounts by half or even a quarter next time as i have a bowl full of cinnamon sugar left over.  Thx for sharing!

Very easy, and inexpensive to make.  My kids did not like the nutmeg at all. Going now to make another batch with vanilla.  I got 24, but they didn't rise way up like muffins, bite size like donut holes.  Could be that my baking powder is too old.

So yummy. I messed up in the end and mixed the butter with the cinnamon and sugar for the topping, but I dipped them in that and then another round of the dry cinnamon and sugar mixture. Delish!

This recipe did not meet my expectations. I was hoping and expecting a light air-y texture; however, I should have not expected this because after all these are donut MUFFINS. So the texture is more dense than I expected and the taste was mediocre. I did follow the recipe exact.

Just made these muffins and they are yummy. I did cut the nutmeg back to 1/2 tsp and next time I might switch it out for cinnamon or vanila. But I will be making again.

Made these this morning for breakfast. They are ok. Not sure I like the nutmeg flavor. I would probably sub it out for cinnamon if I make them again. They did not rise like a traditional muffin! My DD said they weren't her fave but she would eat them!

These would possibly be better if they were made into regular muffins, I'm just not sure. Made to the letter and found the nutmeg over powering and no resemblence to a donut. In the recipe's defense no baked item could taste like a fried one anyway. Glad I didn't make for company and will try making as large muffins.

These were something different and they were good. No one really went crazy over them, though. The flavor was good but my muffins came out "heavy" or "dense." They're worth trying, though.

I really loved this recipe.
I used less than half a teaspoon of the nutmeg because its a bit too strong for my taste.
I also added a dash of cinnamon.
With the cinnamon sugar coating I thought it tasted a tad too sweet but I think that was my fault, a quick dip and its perfect!
My boyfriend said its his fave thing I've baked

This is a pretty easy, kid friendly recipe. I made this today to have for Christmas morning & I went ahead & mixed the cinnamon into the muffins just in case I decide not to douse them in the morning. I also doubled the recipe & I tried one fresh out of the oven w/o the butter & topping & it was very good.

I cut the nutmeg down to 1/2 tsp per reading other reviews.  These taste completely different hot than they do after they've sat and completely cooled.  They do taste just like the cake donut holes you buy at the store.  For me personally, I think I would try the nutmeg at 1/4 tsp the next time.  I also put a vanilla glaze over some and also put jelly filling in some.  My muffins didn't rise though, not sure why.

These are super tasty! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little extra fresh grated nutmeg. They definitely don't have the texture of a donut (not that I expected that, but since other people were complaining about that..) but they have a nice, tender muffin consistency. One tip - don't over mix the batter! When it says to mix until just combined, they mean it! If there are lumps and still a little flour visible, this is fine! When you over-mix muffin batter, it gets still and doesn't rise properly.

To "rivercity" who gave this recipe one star because it was "plagiarized" from the Colorado Cache cookbook... Yeah, this is an original Betty Crocker recipe under the name "French Breakfast Puffs."  It's been around far, far longer than the 1990's and that cookbook...it was around by 1979 for sure, and certainly well before that.  Therefore, whoever put that in your Colorado Cache cookbook copied from Betty Crocker.  Being misinformed is not a good reason to give this recipe one star.

Back to the recipe, the original calls for 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg instead of 3/4.  1/4 is definitely the way to go!  Otherwise, great. :)

WHAT am I doing wrong.  I have made this four times, recipe followed to a "t", and every time the muffins are hard as a rock, and do not rise at all.  So I have a bunch of teeny little "muffins" that are like hockey pucks.  I really want to like this because its great for school parties, and lots of other stuff.  I'm going to continue reading the reviews to see if I can get insight.

These are very good.  I used butter instead of margarine, and I halved the nutmeg, because it seemed overwhelming.  I also added some cinnamon to the batter, these were delish.....you won't be sorry if you make these.  I got 24 of them, and they are going fast!

I made this twice. One in the oven and the other time in my donut maker. I followed the recipe as close as possible but did follow the suggestions to cut down the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Glad I did. I melted the butter and brushed the top of the muffins once they came out of the oven the sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon on top. Using my donut maker and didn't turn out as well as having them baked in the oven. The oven made it fluffier and softer. I used a regular size muffin tin and produced about 9 donuts.

I made these for a treat the other night and they were delicious. The nutmeg flavor is just right. I did overcook mine a bit because the end result was a bit tough, so next time I will try baking for only 15 minutes.

This REALLY does taste like a donut - only not fried.  I made a double batch since I have 4 mini muffin pans and I'm glad I did.  I had more than enough to share with neighbors, son in college, and friends.  Everyone loved them.  This is a very quick and easy recipe to pull together.  To quickly coat with cinnamon and sugar I put the ingredients in a large bowl with a lid.  I dipped 6 muffins at a time and put in the bowl, put lid on, and gently swirled the bowl around.  Reuslts:  48 beautiful muffins done in about 5 minutes.  Most certainly will be making these again.  Thanks Dianne for sharing this delicious recipe!

They really tasted like donuts. I was not expecting that. I made half of the recipe and it turned out 6 regular sized muffins (cupcake sized). They were great. I added brown sugar for the topping so it was more of a brown sugar cinnamon type thing, it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch. Great for breakfast :)

So yummy!!!! I have made these several times and I figured it was about time I left a review. I always double this recipe, 24 sounds like a good amount but it's really not enough. I follow the recipe but I use 1/4tsp of nutmeg total. These are so easy and fast to make just remember to grease you muffin tins really really well or you will have trouble getting them out... Mine bake up for 15 minutes on the dot. Love this recipe!

So EASY!  So FAST!  After reading the reviews I doubled the batch and only used 3/4 tsp of Nutmeg.  Wow.  My wife wanted to know what I put in it.  She couldn't believe the batter was that good.  It mad for a great after school snack!  One word of caution: the cook time should be varied to taste.  15 minutes proved to be a little overdone on the bottom for my taste.  but 12 minutes was the perfect time for me.  Making the third batch tonight after finding recipe yesterday.  Good Stuff.

I was disappointed in this recipe, but I think my I was anticipating a more donut-like result. Instead, the donuts were thicker and more muffin-like.  Be careful not to over-bake them as well.

I rank this recipe up there with Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe from this site. I just did not think these muffins would taste as good as they did. The recipe was so simple and I whipped it up in 5 minutes. I made a half  a batch (12 minis) . I read a few reviews and decided to cut the nutmeg in half. I made them Saturday. Somehow, mysteriously they all disappeared! Truth be known, I made them again the next day! I think that I will have to limit myself to making these for the holidays only because I just can't control myself with these. They are indescribably delicious.

I make these in donut pans, both regular size and mini donuts. They taste much more like donuts than the recipes that came with my donut pans. Sometimes I vary the toppings and dip them in confectioners' sugar or glaze them in a thin confectioners' sugar glaze.

Fun to make - fun to eat! A little heavy on the nutmeg imo.
Don't get to hung up in the amount the recipe yields as the size of mini-muffin pans varies. Just fill the pan 2/3 full and you will have cute, mushroom like donut-muffins. Used margarin for the dough and butter for coating as it tastes more.

These are so good and so easy and fast to make.  This could be dangerous!  I reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  I got 22 from the recipe, that was with filling the pan about 1/2 full.  I just dipped the tops in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Also I made a chocolate glaze and dipped some of the donuts in that for a chocolately treat!

Wow, a sure-fire way to take care of a donut craving!!! I used butter, whole wheat pastry flour,  and 1/2 tsp of allspice since I had no nutmeg. As soon as they were done, I popped them out of the pan and rolled them in cinnamon-sugar. I didn't need the extra butter at all. I'll be using this as a new go-to brunch/breakfast treat for years to come!

Very tasty. I liked them more than hubby did. Made 24 in a Wilton Mini Muffin pan and I followed the recipe as written. Will try this in my mini-donut machine next time. Thanks!

We love this recipe! My 11-year-old son has been begging me to let him help cook and I thought this was the perfect way to introduce him to baking. We made them last night. My husband asked for me to make another (double) batch! I reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp and it was too much when they were fresh, but today, they're perfect...and they really do taste like donut holes!

Oh my goodness!! These were so yummy. The nutmeg flavor was pronounced but since I love nutmeg I thought it was great. My sister didn't know what it tasted like but she too liked the muffin. It's not too strong but can easy be subbed out with cinnamon. Some reviewers had issues with the consistency of these but I thought they were great, just like any muffin I've ever had. Believe it or not, my 3 and 5 yr. olds didn't like these. They licked the tops and left the whole muffin. That left me to eat them up. Oh darn. I mean who else is gonna eat them after they've been licked clean? I liked that this recipe came together very easily, the result was delicious, and the amount was accurate. I got exactly 24 mini muffins. I will make this again with cinnamon in place of the nutmeg for my kids.

This is such a good recipe. It's easy, bite sized and delicious (these really do taste deep fried) I doubled the recipe, and got about 35 minis ( filled the mini pans to the top) so my only 'complaint' is that they do not yield the amount stated. Everyone's pan size is different. I used the william sonoma min-muffin pan.

These work out well. Easy and quick. They taste great!
I shook them in a bag with powdered sugar right after they came out of the oven.


edit:
I take everything back about leaving them in too long and them getting crunchy! I just now ate one and they had the chance to sit our overnight, these are fantastic! Just like donut holes. Definitely changed form 4 to 5 stars. One of the best things I ever made I'm pretty sure.

Underwhelmed. The flavor is okay and I definitely don't understand those that say there's way too much nutmeg [unless you generally don't like it]. The texture is a bit dense for my liking [ unless I overstirred?] Anyway, an overall, eh?! Probably won't make these again

I did not have a mini muffin tin so I used a regular sized muffin tin.  I was surprised that they tasted more a muffin than a doughnut hole.  They were more dense than I thought they would be.  But the taste is delicious.  I would not call these doughnuts at all, a little deceiving.

It seemed to me to be basically a snicker doodle in a muffin. I substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour, extra virgin olive oil for margarine, and used fat free milk and about 1/3 less sugar. Also, I didn't have nutmeg, so I used cinnamon in the batter as well as in the topping. It wasn't overpowering, though suffice it to say, it produced a very pleasant aroma as it baked in the oven. For the topping for about six mini muffins, I mixed about a tablespoon of olive oil with approximately a teaspoon of sugar and a sprinkling of cinnamon. (I'm one of those measuring-averse people who likes to eyeball things when I can get away with it). In any case, it's a really great, easy recipe that requires ingredients that most people anyway have on hand.  The only thing I will do differently next time is line the muffin pans with a teaspoon of olive oil for each cup which is what I do when I make biscuits, to keep them moist as they came out a bit dry.

Melt in your mouth little bites of awesomeness.
I made these yesterday and they were a big hit. I increased the nutmeg because the cinnamon seemed to overpower it, but I guess that's up to each person's taste. I will make these again, but only when I have company because I will eat all of them and they aren't exactly weight watcher-friendly:)

These are absolutely delicious!!!  I was wondering how they would be without an egg, but there were so many excellent reviews I just went ahead with the recipe.  I substituted 1/2 cup of lite sour cream for the milk, since I wanted to use it up.  And as a reviewer suggested, who had used buttermilk, I eliminated the baking powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda instead.  These are amazing!!  I used my Pampered Chef cookie scoop and it made 24 perfectly shaped mini muffins.  I also cut back on the topping ingredients by about 1/2 and it was perfect.  Excellent recipe!!

WOWZA these are some tiny bits of goodness! I followed one review and replaced the milk w/ Buttermilk, and replaced the baking powder with only a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. Worked great! Add a sprinkle or two of cardamom in the cinnamon sugar mix :) Ok now someone tell me how to stop eating them~

This is 5 stars in my book with a slight modification - I decreased the nutmeg to a 1/4tsp and added a 1/4tsp of cinnamon. This was easy with simple ingredients and they tasted like mini donuts! My family loved them! Thank you!

I personally did not care for these. I think the nutmeg spice stopped them from tasting like donuts to me. Good texture though and made 24 mini-muffins in my tin.

Pluses; good basic,easy spice muffin recipe. Decent texture.
Minus'; just a muffin, not a donut, was hoping that with the margarine in recipe that the exterier would crisp up like a reg.fried donut. No go, just a muffin.

these are truly THE best thing in the world!!! i ran out of nutmeg so substituted with cinnamon. YUM YUM YUM. i generally triple this recipe because 1) they dont last more then a day or two and 2) i dont own a mini muffin pan, just use regular muffin pans i still fill about 1/2 way and they cook the same amount of time. i kind of wish i hadnt come across these for they ARE addicting! haha. my dad took a bite, shook his head and declared "D@$M, these are good!" i just came across this about 4 weeks ago and have already made them 6 times! easy scrumptous...TO DIE FOR....

I followed this recipe exactly, and these are fantastic.  I got 22 mini muffins out of it.  I used paper liners, because I hate cleaning muffin tins, so they were easy to remove and dip.  I was reluctant to use the full 3/4 tsp of nutmeg because of the other reviews, but I did anyway, and I think they are great.

This is a great recipe, however for some reason this recipe only made 9 muffins not 24. I am guessing that these muffins are not to be regular size but more like bit size...

These are so good! They taste just like a donut hole. I don't care much for nutmeg so I used cinnamon instead and just a dash of nutmeg. I will definitely be making these again.

These are great and tasty!  I just made some today and my kids love them.  The only thing that I changed (since I did not have nutmeg) was that I substituted cinnamon for nutmeg  (I used 1/2 of what I would use for nutmeg).  It turned out great, thanks for the new recipe!

These were good, but I agree with some other reviewers that it calls for too much nutmeg (and I used fresh grated, which is more mild).  I think using less would make it taste more like a donut.  I would also wait about 5 minutes before rolling them in the sugar so that the heat of the donut didn't "melt" the sugar into it.  But overall these were pretty good and very simple to make so I will make them again with the minor adjustments.

Used buttermilk instead of milk, just because I had it on hand.  Would add vanilla next time( took it out and then forgot to put it in), but was quick and easy and a tasty alternative for breakfast besides the old standby pancakes.

Deeeelicious!  My husband loves them too!  A great treat with ingredients I have on hand.  My husband said they are better than donut holes because you get the crispy outside without all of the cakey texture -- the best part of the donut! :)

GLUTEN-FREE option: I made these delicious treats for my kids with all-purpose gluten-free flour and it worked great! We did not do the topping, but just sprinkled with powdered sugar and they were just like the powdered sugar donuts the kids love!

These have an odd texture for a muffin, and were almost impossible to get out of the pan without crumbling.  I wonder if the addition of half an egg or so would help with that.  Unlike many reviewers, I did not find the nutmeg or butter/sugar overpowering.  In truth, I found the flavor of these muffins rather bland.  They have a pleasant taste, but neither the texture or taste is particularly doughnutty or memorable.

I made these yesterday morning for the kids. I was asked to keep these around. I made these exactly as the recipe stated and was very happy I had everything on hand! I doubled the batch and ended up with 12 regular sized muffins. The only thing I will change next time is I will use real butter instead of margarine. Thanks for a super easy recipe with simple ingredients that are staples in a pantry.

These were so good and easy to whip up!  I was reading the recipe last night and jumped up to make them, so they would be ready for the morning.  In the morning, I just set the even on warm and let them sit in there.  We all liked them a lot!  The do taste like the donut holes, but without all the fat and calories!

I did cut the sugar in the batter to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of wheat germ. I didn't have nutmeg, so I used 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  And used unsweetened almond milk. They were really tasty! Everything else, I did as the recipe stated.  Oh, the batter was really thick and used a TBL to put in mini cupcake pan.  I was able to get 20 minis out of this recipe.

Terrible! Terrible! I ended up eating so many of these in one seating, it's terrible for my diet!!! I even used only half the sugar indicated and it's plenty sweet and yummy. Nutmeg really is a good flavor. I didn't have white sugar for the dusting so I used powdered sugar and cinnamon mix which made them taste super yummy. This is the most evil-good recipe I've read/tried so far.

Ok, how come mine didn't turn out like the picture?  Don't get me wrong, LOVE the taste, they are really yummy.  First batch, I followed to the letter.  They never rose up much, very low, and a bit crisp.  For the 2nd batch, I lowered the temp to 350 and did 1-1/2 times the batter and added just a touch of baking soda.  Up they they went over the top but didn't puff up, just spread.  YUMMY, really good, but I really wanted poofy little muffins!  I'll keep experimenting, they are that good to give it more and more and more tries.  My family is not complaining at all, thank you!

At first, I thought these were just ok, but after sitting overnight, they were amazing!  The secret really is the nutmeg!  I used smartbalance instead of butter with good results.

These were good! I love making muffins for the kids and these were so easy to make and everyone really enjoyed them. I am always looking for a new muffin recipe and this one is a keeper. I will be making these for the next bake sale at school. So easy and at the same time very unique! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, these are a nice treat. I had heard that these were originally an Allrecipes "recipe group" pick, so I wanted to try them. I even bought a Baker's Secret 12 cup mini muffin pan to make them. With the full recipe I am able to get about 17 or 9 with half the recipe. I use low fat milk and whipped butter and they work great. I actually tried regular stick butter once and found them to be way too greasy. So, I now stick with the lower fat whipped butter version. Someone mentioned on the recipe buzz that these are also great with apple cider instead of milk. I may have to try sometime. The way I do make them they remind me of a cinnamon & sugar cake doughnut.

This recipe is incredible.  I could eat these all day long.  My wife made them one day for a church activity.  I was not home at the time but when I could home she had saved two for me.  She said I was lucky to have two left.

So good!!!  Can't wait to make again.

These muffins were super easy to bake, but I have to agree with other reviewers...I don't think 3/4 tsp of nutmeg was necessary.  Here are a few things I thought were worth noting:

*Reduce nutmeg 1/2 tsp 
*Baking powder made muffins a bit bitter, will try reducing amount to 3/4 tsp next time
*When doubling recipe, it's not necessary to double the butter/cinnamon mixture.  
*Over-stirring the batter will produce flattened muffins.  Only mix until flour and baking powder are combined.
*The cinnamon sugar on top is key!  It MADE the muffins! :)

These were really yummy! I didn't have nutmeg, which probably ruins the point, but I used cinnamon instead and they turned out really well! When I was coating them with the sugar cinnamon mixture, my sister tasted one and said the sugar was overpowering. For the rest of the muffins I just put them in a bowl, drizzled them with butter, and sprinkled with sugar. That turned out much better!

What a quick little treat to whip up.  Took not time and was super easy.  Great little breakfast or afternoon treat.  I think I will play with this recipe  and add pumpkin or apple spice in the fall.

My review is solely based on the fact that these were gone within 30 minutes of making them.  To me, they were okay, but my kids made them disappear and I guess that is what matters :)

These besically tasted like a cupcake DROWN in butter. I tasted just a plain muffin before dipping it in the butter and then cinnamon/sugar and it tasted great, but if I ever make these again, I will only brush the tops with butter and then just dip the top in cinnamon/sugar. The butter just made this way too rich and oily. An overall great concept, just needs a little tweaking.

Made these for a quick Sunday morning breakfast today. I read the reviews first, and used only about 1/8 tsp of Nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I also subbed half & half for the milk because I had some to use up before exp date. Baked for 15 mins exactly and brushed on the butter while still in the pan. I used McCormick Cinnamon & Sugar in the jar and sprinkled over the buttered tops. They came out of the mini muffin pan quite easily and they were very good.  A very easy to make quick "treat" for a weekend breakfast!  Will make these again, I am sure!

I don't want to rate this badly, because it's actually a great idea. I just personally don't like nutmeg this much, and after making these I realized I should have cut the nutmeg by A LOT. The texture was awesome, and the little edge pieces were good. But make sure you love nutmeg before you try this recipe as-is!!

These are amazing!  Definately not good for the diet but they taste very good.  I only used 1/4 tsp nutmeg which was plenty.  The bake time should be more like 10-15 minutes...at least in my oven!  What a tasty little treat!

Love this recipe!! I doubled it after reading reviews and brought it to my nieces soccer game! Big hit! Hubby loved them too! I got 40 form a double batch. This was one of the easiest things to bake ever! I did add less nutmeg and to me it was still too much, but everyone else loved them as is. I also just brushed melted butter on top and then sprinkled a premade cinnaman sugar from the store on top. Next time I might brush the whole muffin with the butter and sugar - Like I was suppoed too! lol. Other than that - I followed the recipe as is. Thanks Dianne!!

These are fantastic!  How much nutmeg (or cinnamon for that matter) you use is a matter of taste...and the age of your spices.  Personally, I cut way back on the nutmeg and the truth is that I'm sure they would be great with none at all if that's what you like.  I just made these for fun, but plan on making them again next time I have guests over.  I think serving these with fresh sliced fruit would make a fantastic/light way to finish a meal.

I enjoyed these, as did my colleagues at work.  They are better fresh than making them at night and eating the next day (as are many muffin recipes).  I will make them again.    (oh, I did use 1/2 t of nutmeg)

This recipe was super easy and fast.  I liked that you didn't need many ingredients either.  I only used about half of the nutmeg that it called for after reading other reviews.  I also added cinnamon to the batter.  This recipe was very yummy especailly considering how easy it was to make.

These muffins are great as is.  I'm always looking for ways to healthify things, however, so for this recipe I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the butter, used 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and added 3 teaspoons of wheat bran.  I brush butter lightly on top at the end and then dip in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.

I made a mistake of adding the sugar and cinnamon to the melted butter so it was more like a glaze but still very tasty.  I reduced the sugar and butter amount and used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it little more healthier.

These were actually better after I let them sit in a bag overnight. When they first came out the outside was pretty crunchy. After sitting overnight it was soft.

These looked like they might be plain, but they truly taste like a yummy, fragrent donut.  I cut down on the nutmege only because I was nervous of a strong flavor.  One batch makes 6 reg. sized muffins which took about 20 minutes to cook.  I only sugared the tops and that was plenty (and less messy by the looks of the other muffins!).  Thank you for posting this!  Its going into my personal recipe box OFF the web.  :)

These turned out perfect for my mom's birthday breakfast.... only problem was they were gone by the end of the day! *I suggest using less melted butter/margarine for dipping your muffins in, I ended up wasting a good amount. I will definitely make these again, PERFECT WITH COFFEE! YUM!

Kids liked!  Maybe a little more cinnamon and less nutmeg in the batter??  Didn't need all the ingredients for the topping either.  Probably could have gotten away with about half.  Mine made 21 mini muffins.

According to all three of my children these were not good... they were AMAZING!  My 15 year old daughter made these for her bible study group.  They were very easy and quick to make.  She made extras that were gobbled up by her brothers within minutes.
This recipe is a keeper.  Could have used just half of of the butter and cinnamon/sugar mixture for the coating, so we will use that next time.  May try pumpkin pie spice  or apple pie spice instead  of nutmeg for a change, but the nutmeg level was fine as stated in the recipe.
YUM!

Yum!i just made these tonight and they were great!although,when you bake them,go for nothing less than 20 min.,unless you want them a bit doughy and then 18 min. is good.i added 3/4 tsp. of nutmeg in the topping and that gave it more nutmegie goodness! :)

These are delicious just the way they are.  I followed the instructions the first time and the second time I made them I added 3/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp mace. I glazed 1/2 with mapeline flavoring and the other 1/2 with chocolate.  None of them were as good as the original recipe by Dianne.  I will keep and follow her recipe as my favorite.  I give her five stars and more if I could.

Made a recipe similar to this because it included a glaze instead of rolling in sugar. Delicious!

Five stars from me!!  I have never been one to alter a recipe and rate it before even trying the "bare bones" version, but let me tell you, in my opinion, this recipe needs no tweaking!  They are awesome and addictive!  My husband is away from home today, and I'm not sure his share will survive waiting for him with two kids ready to eat them!  They are so good and didn't take anytime at all to make.  That's my kind of recipe!

These were awesome and so easy to make!! I guess I ran out of nutmeg over the holidays and forgot, so I substituted it with some pumpkin spice and i was pleased with them. I told my husband he could take them with him to work and he said, "No. These are too good to share!" So, we've eaten more than we should, but they are great!! Oh, also, my mini tins only made 18. Thank you!

These were very good!  However, I made them for breakfast, which I do not recommend.  Edited to add: I made these again and put the cinnamon sugar on top of the muffins before I baked them and they turned out more breakfast appropriate.

I was skeptical about this recipe since it did not include eggs, but what a surprise! It was a quick and easy late night treat. I recommend scaling back the nutmeg, I used 1/2 teaspoon and it was quite strong. Add a few dashes of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla to the batter for added flavor. The batter can be a bit floury tasting, so up the sugar by at least 2 tablespoons. Overall, very good!

Made this for breakfast today. It was a quick batter with little effort. Other than reducing the amount of nutmeg a tad and adding a dash of salt, I stuck to the recipe. They were very good, and reminiscent of cake doughnuts. I will be making them again!

Had an unexpected snow day with my kids that I was not prepared for.  I searched AR looking for a muffin recipe and found this super easy recipe.  My boys loved them!  The only thing I altered in this recipe was I used 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour to give myself the illusion that I'm serving my kids something healthy.  Thanks for a great recipe and saving my kids from the standard cold cereal breakfast!

These are delicious little muffins and super easy to make!  I doubled the recipe & followed it to the tee, and instead of making 48 mini muffins, I had enough dough for only 30.  If I make them again, which I probably will, I might decrease the amount of nutmeg to 1/2 tsp instead of 3/4 tsp in the original recipe.

While mixing the batter, I thought the amount of sugar called for was too high, but prepared the recipe as directed anyway (can't honestly rate the recipe if I tweak it the first time I make it).  My kids liked them, but my kids also believe sugar is a food group!  LOL!  Anyway, DH and I both thought they were way too sweet, even when we skipped the cinnamon sugar topping.  I'll stick with my original recipe for doughnut muffins;  1/3 C shortening, 1/2 C sugar, 1 egg, 1.5 C flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, .5 tsp salt, .25 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 C milk.  The ratio of sugar to flour is lower, and the addition of salt cuts that over-sweet problem.  I also use POWDERED sugar and cinnamon for the topping, because we don't like that "gritty" feeling of chewing pure white sugar.

These are very yummy.  But like other people, I didn't get 24 muffins, I got 18.  I would definitely shorten the bake time to about 13 or 14 minutes.  I would also change the nutmeg in the muffin batter itself...maybe use less nutmeg and add some cinnamon or just omit the nutmeg entirely and substitute it for cinnamon.

I really don't know why these are called donut muffins. Donuts are defined as sweetened dough that's fried and shaped as a ring. Anyway, these miniature muffins are good plus they're easy to make and bake in such a short amount of time.

These were absolutely delicious and very addicting to eat.  My family and I could not stop eating them.  I made some changes because my husband does not care for nutmeg so I added 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon instead.  I also dipped them in the butter and then a mixture of 1/4 cup of white sugar and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar with the cinnamon.  They tasted just like a cake donut.  Will definitely be making these again!

Fabulous recipe! Thank you! My only concern is that the muffins soak up a lot of butter, when dipping the muffins in the butter, before rolling into the sugar mixture, causing them to be soggy on the bottoms. They still turn out delicious though!

These were great tasting muffins but they definitely didn't taste like a donut. They had the taste and texture of coffee cake. I didn't have plain nutmeg on hand, but pumpkin pie spice worked just fine. They tasted great and were very portable, so they worked well for my toddlers and my husband's morning commute.

Way too much nutmeg!  I might try these again since they're so easy and quick, but will use (at most) half of the nutmeg suggested.

This is a keeper. Definitely easy to make and tastes great, just like donuts. However, I didn't dip the entire muffin into the melted butter, instead, I brushed the top with melted butter and dipped in the sugar cinnamon mix.

I used butter & only 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. Made 22 mini muffins & I added the topping as a glaze instead of rolling them in it.  Next time I think I'll add it before they are done baking so it sinks in. My husband's exact quote, "I could eat about 10 of these"

I have NEVER written a review for anything in my life, but I had to write one for these.  I had made mini donuts, and my family loved them so much.  I went in search of another potential recipe and found this one.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe states (except I used butter instead of margarine).  Everyone loved them.  The second time I decided to add some pumpkin (to add some nutrition for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter).  I used slightly less butter and used 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of pumpkin.  They came out fabulously.  I didn't quite believe when everyone said you can only eat one, but if I only make one batch, they're gone in one day!  The best part is that these are SO easy to make, and they make you look like such a great baker:)

These were the perfect opportunity for me to try out my new silicone cupcake molds! I also used less nutmeg than the recipe called for, about 1/2 tsp instead of 3/4.  Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture, and I'm not sure if there's some high-altitude adjustments that I needed to make, since mine didn't rise as much as I thought they would, but they were still delicious!

I had more than a few fiascos with last minute Christmas Eve baking, and was suddenly left with not enough baked goods for the occasions I was attending and no stores open to buy more ingredients! I did a search on AR for recipes with ingredients I had on hand (not many) and found this - man am I glad!! This recipe is insanely fast and easy to make, and they turn out completely delicious! This is a new favourite recipe that I'll definitely be making again!

LOVED these!! I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out a little nutmeg (I probably used 1 1/4 tsp.) since I saw another reviewer thought there was too much. I think it would have been fine with the full amount. These are dense like a donut hole and I LOVE that! I only had two though because they are SWEET! But I think my husband eat 10. =) I will definitely make these again!

These really deserve a 3 1/2.   In my opinion 3 means bad and 4 means good. These definitely aren't bad, they're just not phenomenal.   Ok this all sounds very negative. They're good muffins. They're just not spectacular.   This could be attributed to the fact that i made them regular sized so they had less cinnamon/sugar coating. But...I'm rating the muffins not the topping.   The consistency was wonderful. They would make a fabulous base.   Don't use margarine-the butter is what makes it.   I doubled it-the regular amounts made a pitiful amount. It made 11 regular sized muffins. And the butter/cinn/sug topping didn't need to be doubled (for some reason there's always too much).   I feel so guilty giving this a three star. They're good. They're just not "wow"! They're perfect if you want a simple muffin or a starting point.

These are very yummy.  Making them in mini muffin tins allows the donut hole taste.  I only gave it four stars because:
1- they need to be eaten while warm, when they cool they get a little hard
2- rolling in the cinnamon sugar mixture was too sweet (for my taste), dipping in butter (yum) and then sprinkling on the mixture would be better (for me)

TIP- to make rolling in sugar quicker, I used the zeppole method: pour melted butter in a ziplock bag, toss in donuts.  Remove donuts, place in a brown lunch bag filled with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar, give a good shake.

Wow these are amazing!! I followed the recipe as written but doubled it (since based on the reviews I knew these were going to be great!) Mine were definitely done in 15 minutes. These taste just like a homemade timbit/donut hole! Will definitely be making these again, yum!

For all of the outstanding review, these are average and they don't deserve to have doughnut in the name because they don't come close to the same texture.  They sort of have the taste, more like a store bought muffin than a doughnut from a doughnut shop.  Like other reviewers, I cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla.

I do all of the baking for a small coffee shop so I am always looking for something different yet fairly simple. These were perfect! I love the simple ingredients and easy prep. I always make extra big bakery style muffins so I had to double the recipe and I ended up getting five jumbo size muffins.

Added a little bit less nutmeg to the batter, and next time I think I'm dipping the muffins in melted butter instead of margarine, for a deeper flavor. Otherwise this recipe is delicious!!

I finally got around to trying these today. We really liked them.  The amount of nutmeg was perfect. The only thing I did differently was to brush the tops of the muffins with butter when they came out of the oven, while they were still in the pan.  I sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar, then took them out of the pan to cool on a wire rack. That saved MANY calories and they tasted delicious.

MMMMM!  very good.  Don't wait for them to get golden brown, they will be dry.  the sugar cinnamon mixture will give them that golden color.  As stated before don't make just 12.  Everyone that tried them couldn't just have one.  Tasty lit'l guys.  TRY THEM! just don't over bake...and I too just dipped the top of the muffins.  First few were waaaay too sugary!  Thank you for a simple and very good recipe.

So yummy, you do not need to change a thing!  For a different coating, try an easy orange glaze: 1/2 cup icinig sugar and 1 tbsp orange juice.  Dip the donuts in the glaze after they have cooled.  Lay on wire rack with wax paper underneath to catch the drippings.  Makes for easy clean up!   My family liked the glazed ones better.  Great recipe!

I'm not sure about the nutmeg taste. I had a few right out of the oven and freshly rolled in sugar/cinnamon but they weren't that great. The next day the definately tasted better, though they'd be better if they tasted more like mini donuts.

I have to admit that when I was mixing the dough, I thought it looked...not so appetizing.  I was skeptical on how the donuts would taste.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least!  These were delicious!  They were moist with a real donut texture and a perfect bite size donut. I think I will go easy on the sugar coating next time.  My husband loves sweets and when he bit into one he said, "holy sugar, batman!"  lol My daughter on the other hand wolfed down 3 and wanted more.  I guess it's personal taste. If you like the fresh mini donuts found at a flee market, you'll love these.

I have been making a version of these for many years. . .they make great christmas goodies for sharing with friends.  For perfection use butter instead of margarine to dip the muffins in before rolling in cinnamon sugar mixture. . .melt in your mouth!

Very good!  I used a bit less nutmeg than it called for and I felt it was a good amount.   I was able to squeak out 24 short mini muffins. I needed about 1 Tbsp more melted butter to roll the muffins in, but the sugar and cinnamon was the right amount for me. I only had about a Tbsp or less left over.

Made these this morning and they were great! It made 24 mini muffins with a tiny bit left over. The only thing that I did differently was use only a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg (they still had a very nice nutmeg flavor) and used light spreadable butter. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

Even with the cinnamon sugar topping, all I could taste was nutmeg. Definitely cut back to 1/2 or even 1/4 tsp. Otherwise, a very good little muffin with a moist texture.

These muffins were... okay. They tasted a little bland to me. My son, husband, mother, and brother all adored them! They are very moist and have a great texture. I did end up baking them in a full sized muffin pan. I also added vanilla to the mixture. While they weren't my cup of tea, I'll make them again for my family. Thanks! :)

What's not to like?  Little bite sized donuts that you can pop in your mouth?  Yum.  I thought these tasted better after sitting overnight (in an airtight bag.)  I realized once I started making these that I didn't have any nutmeg, so I used cinnamon in the batter instead, and they were really good.  This is one of those "I have everything in the house to make them" kind of recipes.  Thanks for sharing!

These were a hit with the whole family! Great for families with egg allergies!   Made exact recipe but I doubled the recipe & made them in a regular size muffin tin (I don't have a mini muffin tin). I baked them for 22 min. They didn't brown on the top but a toothpick came out clean when testing them. Doubling the recipe yeilds 12 regular size muffins. Will make again.

You really have to try these! I only had a regular cupcake sized pan and made 7 so I can't wait to try with the mini. They are just the perfect sweetness and similar to the cake donut I'd say. Kids loved them and wanted them in their lunchbox.

I should have listened to others and cut the nutmeg in half.  I also think I over mixed because the texture of the muffins was too tough.  The cinnamon sugar on top is the only thing that saved my creation.  I hope to make again b/c they look so delicious in the picture!

I fixed these for breakfast and they nwere yummy. I got 24 mini-muffins out of recipe. I dipped half in the sugar/cinnamon mix after dipping in the melted butter and the other half in vanilla glaze which some one else suggested. I also used buttermilk instead of sweet milk and subbed 1/2 tsp baking soda for the baking powder. These will be a regular in my breakfast lineup. Thanks for the post.

OH YEA!!!! These arte the BOMB!!!! My son had some friends over, so I said what the heck, this looks like a good recipe. Not only was it a completely easy recipe to make, The boys DIVOURED these, I was lucky to get one before my fingers were bit off. The best part was, that all of the ingrediants are almost always in my pandtry, so i dont have to run to the store to get any of it. Will sooo be making this one again, infact, my son said I have no chice, and that i better make this again.

These were so good!! I made them for my kids for breakfast and they LOVED them...they were fighting over the last one!! I only made half a batch and that gave me 9 mini muffins. Other than halving the recipe, I made them exactly as written. I will for sure be making these again and will keep this recipe in my "Favorites" file. These are so easy to make too! :)

These where fine, but where quite hard and did not taste of much, except sugar. Next time I'll add more flavourings.

Very addictive and excellent with a large glass of ice cold milk!  I made these after work today, the are so simple to make and all the ingredients are something that you would have on hand.  I subbed out the nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice and they turned out perfect.  Next time I might use a glaze instead of the sugar/cinnamon mixture

I don't think they tasted quite like the sugar donut holes - they were actually better.  They were easy and were good, but too sweet for my tastes.  (Sugar donut holes are even more too sweet and denser.)  I kept eating the silly things, but that's just too much sweet for me.  If I make them again (I think my brother would love them, after the way he was spying the too-sweet baked goods in the grocery the other day), I would only dip the tops.  As it was, there was too much of the cin-sugar, though I accidentally found a recipe calling for some and was able to use it up.  I didn't think the nutmeg was over-powering at all - maybe the cinnamon covered it up.  Really, everything was good except for being just "too much."  Made them exactly as is, using butter inside and a spread for the tops.  Even melted the butter as it says and it worked fine.  I have 2 sizes of mini muffin pans, and I used the smaller, which is the size I see the liners in the grocery, about the size of a donut hole.  Filled them 3/4 full as it says and they puffed over the top a bit (not like a mushroom), and I got 16 of them.  My other pan is bigger, and very old that I got from my mother and I never see that size.  This was the christening of my new mini pan. :-)

THERE'S NO SALT IN THIS RECIPE!!! I had my salt cellar out on the counter, ready to pinch away, but THERE'S NO SALT! You have NO idea how hard it is to find recipes as full of flavor as this one without tons of sodium  -  I am *so* grateful - bless you :).   I too used freshly grated nutmeg, so I scaled down to perhaps 1/2 a teaspoon coupled with 1/2 t of cinnamon.  Absolute perfection.  The Man of the House will be so pleased.  UPDATE & NOTE TO SELF:  *always* used liners and just dip tops - no matter what I use, my muffins always stick

After such praising reviews I was expecting these too be completely delicious...and we thought they were just ok.  I made them exactly to the recipe, don't get me wrong they are good, but not at all what I was expecting.  I still prefer a good deli sugar donut.

These were yummy and very easy to make.  Very cute too!  I also like that the recipe does not make a huge amount. I came out with the perfect amount for 24 mini muffins.

Wow these are so good! And very easy to make. I did only used 1/2 tsp nutmeg and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the batter. I don't have a mini-muffin pan so I used a normal sized muffin pan, filled each cup about 1/3 of the way which made 12 almost-mini-muffins. To cut out a lot of calories I tossed them with the cinnamon and sugar in a large ziplock while they were warm out of the oven. They were coated perfectly and turned out delicious!

I doubled the recipe and made these for a house full of company.  I made half with just the tops dipped in the cinammon/sugar and the other half as the recipe states with the muffin completely rolled in the cinammon/sugar.  The concensus at our house was that the ones with just the tops dipped were preferred over the others, but the overall consensus was that they were incredibly tasty!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Very good muffins, made them twice in a month.  I'm not too crazy about the sugar on the outside; I used white sugar then 1st time I made them, and powdered sugar the second time, and it kind of turned me off.  So... the muffins are yummy and tender, but next time I make them I might add apples or raising in the mixture and leave out the cinnamon sugar that coats them. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I enjoyed these very much. What i did try my second time making these is putting blueberry pie mix on the bottom and pouring the batter over top. Something different. Was wonderful. Minus the cinnamon mix of course.

Yum! We loved these. I cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. for personal taste and just threw the sugar/cinnamon mix and warm muffins into a ziploc and shook and they turned out coated perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was delicious! I made one change though. I didn't have nutmeg and didn't want to go to the store for one thing so I substituted the nutmeg with 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  It still came out tasting amazing. I found that using the melted margarine before coating the donuts wasn't necessary. The sugar seem to stick to the donut even without the margarine.

Fantastic and fun!!! Can't believe how much I liked the nutmeg in these. We used butter, and just dipped the tops. They were very tasty and fun to serve for our company. Delicious with coffee!
Update: Made these again today using fresh nutmeg! Even more amazing. This time I didn't dip them in butter, but instead threw them in a brown paper bag with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon while warm. Amazing!

I thought these were pretty good! Like a few other reviewers I thought it was too sugary on the outside(I know this sounds crazy since they are supposed to be like cinnamon sugar donut holes!), but I think if I dipped them in the cinnamon sugar without the melted butter it would be better for my tastes or just dip the tops only. I will make these again and I wonder how they would be with powdered sugar or a glaze? I might try that next time! Thanks for sharing!

These should be OUTLAWED!!! They are that good and you will eat them 5 at a time. My only tip is I used a 24 mini muffin pan. I used a teaspoon to drop batter into the cups. I scraped the bowl and had enough for 24. IMO the smaller the better. For some reason some cups overflowed (thought I had them even). The smaller ones were alot better. These are super fast and easy and uses ingredients on hand.  Great recipe for kids learning how to bake. Thanks Dianne! (Although I think we may now have a love/hate relationship!)

These got too sugary and buttery for us.  I would like them better without dipping them in butter, but not sure how the sugar would stay on then.

Oh my, these are so YUMMY!  I just made a batch and I'm hoping I won't eat them all before my husband gets home.  The great thing about this recipe is you don't have to have any special ingredients, it uses things you already have in your pantry. It's also very easy and quick to make.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't think I have ever seen a Recipe Group selection generate this many reviews before!  I don't have a mini muffin pan anymore so I used the foil mini cups.  They must be somewhat larger because I only got 10 muffins.  I used butter and the full amount of nutmeg.  I dipped the first few muffins in butter before rolling in the sugar mixture, but I thought it made them too heavy so for the rest I just dipped the top but rolled the whole thing.  Great recipe, but these are addictive!!  Thanks Dianne, her Mom and Grandmother!

Made this for Recipe Group and, well, there is nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said, but these muffins/donuts are truely AMAZING! I can't even believe how simple they were to make with ingredients I always have on hand. I just mixed everything by hand and it came together in a snap! I made the recipe exactly as written and feel that no changes are necessary. I got exactly 24 muffins out of the batter. Thanks, Dianne, for such a wonderful, simple and delicious recipe that I will be making VERY often! :)

These muffins or donuts are AWESOME.   I think the reason why this recipe is so popular so quickly is because it produces great results with ingredients that literally every cook has stashed in their pantry.  I only made a couple of changes: added 1/2 CARDAMOM because it's my all time favourite spice for baking, a small pinch of SALT, and a 1/2 tsp of VANILLA.  This recipe would taste just as good without my simple additions, but I just thought I'd share what I did.  Also, for some strange reason I yielded 9 average size muffins.   Thanks for submitting!

I wish we could give 1/2 stars!  I would probably give this a 4.5.  These are tasty little things.  I got 18 mini donuts out of the batch.  They are very tender and I LOVE the nutmeg in the batter.  I used fresh so I used a little less since I was grinding it off the nut.  These are sweet and I think I would add a little more cinnamon next time.  My kids will love these and they do taste like a cake donut.  These are also so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.

We really liked these but will definitely reduce the amount of nutmeg in the batter next time (or might even try replacing it with cinnamon).  I'll definitely be making these again!

Wow. People were not kidding-- I made a batch yesterday to take to a meeting and they disappeared. Had to make another batch today just for me! These are ridiculously good and simple to make, which is a huge bonus. I substituted whole wheat flour (cause it was all I had) and almond milk (cause I'm vegan). I had the best of intentions to eat just one. but they're so good I had to cut myself off at four.

I suspect that whoever wrote this recipe doesn't have much of a background in baking. It's a cool recipe, but has some fundamental baking 101 no no's. I made them & they turned out AWESOME but only because I made the following changes. First, with such a sweet baked product like this, you gotta have some salt for balance: 1/2 a tsp to the muffin batter is perfect. Second (& this was my biggest pet peeve) in a recipe such as this where you "mix until just combined" (overmixing really messes things up), always separately mix your dry ingredients and then SIFT them into the wet. They omit these steps in the recipe which is a big mistake unless you like uneven clumps of baking powder. Other than that everything else was fine. In the batter, I decreased the nutmeg to 1/2tsp & added 3/4tsp cinnamon & felt the spices were perfectly balanced :)

This original recipe comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook published in the 50's or so. I don't  know the exact date. Anyway,  they are called "French Breakfast Puffs". My mom made these for special occasions.  Now, I make them for my family most Saturday mornings. I like to use a mixture of cream and milk to make them a bit fluffier. The nutmeg is crucial! It gives a subtle flavor. Leaving out nutmeg    will give you a "just ok" muffin. I make 12 regular sized muffins. Don't overcook! To get a light, fluffy muffin cook for 20 minutes.  Don't let the tops brown or the muffin will get tough. Yummy!

These are amazing! I've made them twice already just because my kids went crazy for them. I didn't have nutmeg so I used cinnamon in place of that and added some vanilla. I made them as big muffins and the time for cooking was around 20 minutes. The butter at the end is what really makes these amazing! This is def a new family favorite for us!

I love this recipe, as it is it comes out perfect everytime I make it. I made the mistake of listening to the top reviewer today, I used buttermilk, added the baking soda.... well, these ended up in the trash, they sunk in the middle, over flowed, got hard and burnt around the edges and stuck to the pans. Never again will I alter this! I wish you could thumbs down a review.

Made several batches of these for Easter brunch. Taste tested while they were still warm and had to resist the urge to eat several (dozen) more. They are SO GOOD. The only change to the muffin recipe I made was to reduce the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon because I find nutmeg to be overpowering. For the last step, I melted butter and used a grill brush to brush it onto the muffins and then dropped them into a large ziploc bag with the 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon mixture and shook to coat. It was easy and mess free that way. That amount of cinnamon sugar easily coated 2 batches so the original recipe amount is definitely overkill.

I rate it 5 stars! But it should say margine OR butter! I used butter and they were great. Also I baked them for 15 minutes instead of 20. Great though.

This is a delicious recipe but don't make the same mistake I did. After reading one review I decided I too wanted to use buttermilk and have them taste more like my home made donuts. So as suggested, I eliminated the baking powder and used baking soda. I could not get them out of the muffin tins! I threw the first batch away because all I had were crumbs left from digging them out of the pans. (yes, I did grease the pans!) I even tried some in a regular sized muffin tin, but had the same bad luck in getting them out. I tried loosening them  around the edges, I tried letting them cool. Nothing worked! Had I used papers I would not have had this problem, but I suspect the muffins would have stuck to them as well. So I began again and used baking powder. They came out much better. I made a double batch and make a small cake and 6 regular muffins. I was so frustrated by this point that I didn't take the extra step of dipping in butter and then sugar. I just sprinkled a mix of cinnamon and sugar over the tops. They are good and worth making, but if you mess them up like I did, beware!

I doubled the recipe, put only 1 tsp of nutmeg in but all else kept the same.  Did again and added vanilla and 1/4 tsp of salt and they were even better.  thank you for this KEEPER!!!!

I tried these because of the rave reviews and simplicity. Plus I had all the ingredients. Was dissapointed with the outcome. Very bland. Even my son who luvs cinnamon did not like them. Sorry just didnt thrill us. Good base but needs more flavor.

Oh my goodness! I had guests staying who were allergic to eggs and these were the perfect snack to have on hand for them. The only change I made was to add the cinnamon straight to the batter instead of topping with cinnamon sugar. They were gone before I got them out of the muffin pans! 

I have also made them with the topping and that is also delicious!

I have made these as written ( 5 Stars ) I just made them using pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. Yum! This recipe is solid on its own but is so easy to play with as well! Thanks for sharing!

Holy woooow these are sugary.  The nutmeg in the muffin is a nice touch, but I could barely taste it over the cinnamon/sugar coating, even when I had brushed about half of it off.

I just tried this recipe.  It's super easy to follow!  Just make sure your margarine (or butter) is completely melted because it's MUCH easier.  And fill your mini muffin tins a little lower than half full or they will overflow.  Oops.

The first time I made this, it was because I was out of eggs and needed to bring something to a breakfast. I have made it several times since then, and always get compliments. I make it with butter, and use the full amount of nutmeg. They go well with coffee, and since they are small and easy to eat, they go fast!

These are great and exactly what I was looking for; quick, easy and delicious! I made this vegan with margarine & almond milk and my wife could not tell the difference :). It's a great base recipe to play with and adjust to your liking. I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 cinnamon in the recipe and sprinkled powered sugar on top. This recipe is a definite keeper, thanks so much Dianne.

Tried this recipe this morning for my son and his friends. Used half white whole wheat flour and half AP flour. Dipped the tops of the muffins in the melted butter / cinnamon sugar mixture.  A hit!  Think dipping the whole muffin and then rolling in cinnamon sugar would have been too sweet for us. Made 20 muffins using 1 level tablespoon of batter per mini muffin.

These lil guys are AWESOME! Quick, easy, affordable and a real crowd pleaser!

I'm no baker by any stretch of the word but I wanted something simple and sweet  for brightening up the weekend shifts at work.  But this recipe is super simple and so perfectly detailed even I couldn't screw it up!

I love that most of the ingredients are super inexpensive and can be used multiple times before running out. 

And to top it all off they are delicious. My coworkers simply start drooling the second I pop the lid and cinnamon sugar starts wafting through the air. Best if served slightly warm but delicious even if made the night before!

Only reason for 4 stars is that I used 1/2 the called for nutmeg and once baked I brushed the tops with butter and dipped in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I also 1 halved the coating ingredients and had too much., but that's ok! My husband adores those cinnamon donut holes from the store.  These got two thumbs up!  Yeah! I can make these for pennies!

Having followed the recipe exactly, i recommend using half the nutmeg and replacing the other half with cinnamon. But otherwise it was very good and I'll be making these again

Fantastic!  Only problem is that I do not have mini muffin tins, so chose to make regular sized muffins, but still only got 6, regular sized muffins out of it.  No matter, they were really delicious.  I only coated the top with butter and rolled in sugar and it was plenty.

Awesome, I used butter in place of margarine and cooked them in a paper lined mini muffin pan. After I took them out I brushed the tops with butter and dipped the tops in cinnamon sugar.

I think these little donut muffins are awesome so  yummy, those that underrated these must of done something wrong. ( that's just my opinon) I only butter and sugared the tops other wise I think they would be too sweet

It is very true to it's name. In taste and texture it is like a donut, in the shape of a muffin. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't make the recipe as written, I would've given 4 1/2 if I could. For one, I only have large muffin tins, which yielded me 6 delicious muffins, though not that large at all... Second, for the cinnamon-sugar topping, as some suggested, I only did the tops. After removing from the oven I lightly spread margarine on the tops of the muffins with a spatula, then lightly sprinkled sugar, then cinnamon on top. Any more than that would've been too much! Also I did cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, was plenty for me, and I wouldn't dare cut it out entirely, that is what made the taste so donuty (sp?) All in all it was different, but altogether a good, interesting recipe. I wish I had the mini muffin tins!

Updated Review:  While my initial attempt at this recipe was nothing special, I decided to try again.  They were hugely popular this time.   The major change was less baking time.  Mini muffins in my pans are done in as little as 9 minutes depending on the recipe.  Also, I sift all dry ingredients now, and only use White Lily flour.  (*original review: 10/14* The taste was good, but the texture was off-putting for some reason, probably a mistake I made in preparation somehow.  One comment I got was "Is this cinnamon cornbread?"   I was so excited to make these because of all the positive reviews, so I am disappointed at my failure.   Perhaps I will try again to see if they turn out better next time.)

I made these using a double batch and used a regular 12 muffin pan and then still had enough to make about 6 mini muffins. For the large muffins I just did the tops with the butter and cinn & sugar mix. With the mini muffins, I did as instructed. I will say that the way it was written was way better and I did really like how they are just the right size to pop in your mouth! I really enjoyed these but my family weren't so receptive on them which is why I gave it just a 4 star.

Everything about these were perfect! I only added some vanilla because, well, I love vanilla. These really did taste exactly like donut holes you'd get from the store, but I liked them way better! And so easy! And not time consuming!

I would have LOVED this and given it 5 stars except I found I had to modify it slightly. My first batch yielded about 20 very small (1-bite) donuts. I filled mini muffin tins half way as instructed, cooked for 17 min @ 375 but found them to be a bit too crunchy and way too small. In the next batch I added a 1/2 tsp salt to the batter and filled the mini muffin tins almost all the way. This yielded about 16 total muffins. I also baked them for 15 in stead of 17 min and they're amazing!

"These are like bite-sized heaven." Direct quote from a slumber party guest. I didn't  anything planned for breakfast, so I searched for kid-friendly recipes and came across these marvelous muffins. I made it exactly as described, with the exception of tripling the recipe because I had 3 mini muffin tins. There were only 4 children + myself, and oh my word, they're ALL GONE!! These are simply amazing. Stop reading reviews and go make these!

They were too soft and definitely didn't taste like doughnuts, they tasted more like a sweet corn muffin or corn bread without the corn. Which was nice but not what the intended outcome. So I had to just make them into cupcakes and chuck a little bit of frosting on them and salvage what I could.

Love these...just made them but will be curious to see what they really taste like after they are at room temperature.  Thanks for sharing.  Edit:  Just tasted another one at room temperature...still absolutely delicious!  We did only dip the tops in the butter and cinnamon and sugar, not the whole muffin.  Perfect!

I just baked these using my donut pan and I'm really happy with how they turned out. I tried two other baked 'donut' recipes before and was very disappointed with the texture--like rubbery sponges. Not these. Their texture and taste is pretty close to a proper deep-fried donut minus the huge vat of oil. I'm not a big fan of nutmeg, so following another reviewers suggestion, I only used 1/4 tsp (pre-ground from a jar, not freshly grated) and I added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The recipe only made 8 thin-ish donuts, so next time I'm going to double the recipe and add more batter to each well, to see if I can get them a bit plumper.

Sooooooo good! Loved the cinnamon sugar donut taste, but in the form of a muffin! Genius! Wonderful crunch on the outside with fluffy muffin on the inside. Definitely will make again! Maybe next time add a little vanilla... Very very very good!

This was a nice recipe to make on my b-day. I love baking and so I said to myself, well how about I look for a muffin recipes that has two of my favorite things: muffins and doughnuts! The recipe was very sweet and the recipe said that it made 24 muffins?!? I could only get 12 because that batter was so thick, and that was even after adding more milk. It had way to much nutmeg. I would say that it only needed 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoons of nutmeg. Over all, the recipe was delicious, it was a nice treat. I will make this again, but next time I'll make some adjustments.

Good! Rolling them around with a spoon is cleaner. Don't overfill since these tend to rise. Makes about 18 minis.

I've made this over and over again. Everyone loves it! There is only one thing I do differently. At the end, instead of dipping the muffins in the butter and then rolling them in cinnamon sugar, I mix the butter and cinnamon sugar, dip them in that mixture, and then let it drip down the sides of the muffin. Either way, this is an amazing recipe. And I'm not kidding, I make these for birthdays a lot and EVERYONE love them!

These were tasty and easy to make. They really do taste just like little cinnamon doughnuts. I love that they're baked rather than being fried. My husband couldn't get enough of them. We'll definitely make these again.

I really enjoyed this delicious recipe! I used butter instead of margarine, pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg (didn't have nutmeg) and 1/2 the sugar/cinnamon mixture and it came out perfect!  They have a donut consistency and are really easy to make.

These are just cute, like donut holes, and delicious! Definitely a 5 star-plus!  Quick and easy too. I made 22 mini donut holes. I don't care for nutmeg so I used cinnamon instead. Then when they were done, I let them cool for 3 minutes and then loosened them a bit with a knife but left them in the pan. I melted the butter, put it in a small tiny bowl and just dipped the top of the donut hole in, then immediately dipped it into the sugar/cinnamon mix and sprinkled some of the sugar around the rest of the donut hole - it stuck to the sides/bottom even without butter! I let them sit on a wire rack while the kids got dressed for school, then put them in mini ziplock bags for their morning snack.  They LOVED them and I loved having a couple with my coffee, too!  This weekend I may make more and dip them into melted chocolate and sprinkles....or glaze some too! Perfect for a healthy donut craving substitute. :)

So I started cooking before I checked which spices I had.  I ended up foregoing the cinnamon bit at the end and creating my own mixture of instant diabetes (sugar, butter, and vanilla extract).  Fortunately, no one died, but it was a bit too sweet.  I'm going to buy more cinnamon and take another swing.  Everything else is pretty awesome.

I made these a couple of hours ago.  I ate one warm and thought it was quite good.  I am waiting for hubby to come home for his opinion!  I followed the recipe, but used less sugar in the batter and almond milk, hoping to make them a bit more nutritious!  I also would not use melted butter to top them when I make them again.  They are tasty enough that all they need is some cinnamon and sugar or splenda mix.  I got 22 mini muffins, but they did not puff up as so many said.

I loved these! If your not a nutmeg fan keep that in mind and replace it with something you do enjoy. These were moist and the coating is just yum yum yum!

These are really good even if I did substitute some things. I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour and used half and half instead of milk. I didn't use as much nutmeg as it called for. And since I baked these in a cake pop maker, it took me 30 minutes. I don't know if my substitutions made a difference in the taste but I'll probably continue looking for more recipes like this.

These really taste like snicker doodles not donuts and I don't care much for snicker doodles. So only 3 stars. Also the nutmeg @1/2 tsp is over powering.

I'm 8 months pregnant and can't sleep so I made these at 2am for my kids for in the morning and they are Amazing! Because of my own tired mistake, I forgot to melt the butterin the recipe an ended up creaming it with the sugar and they still turned out great! Very addictive. It was hard to save some for the kids and not eat them all myself.

Amazing and quick! We use a 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour blend and they are very tasty. My 4 year old son loves making these with me. We reduce the nutmeg (to fit our personal taste) and they are delicious. They don't last long!

They stuck to the pans. We ate them out of the bowls with spoons.  The flavor was delicious.  Maybe if I make them again I'll put them in the mini muffin paper cups.

Simple and delicious.  The nutmeg in them is great, but we found 1/2 t to be enough.  We shook half of the muffins in a plastic bag with powdered sugar and cinnamon- this was also good (and lower in fat).

AMAZING! I substituted milk with Almond Milk (unsweetened vanilla flavored) out of personal preference only. (I don't drink cow milk) So with that you can call them: lactose free, non-dairy, even vegan! There is no difference really when using almond milk IN something. I use it any time a recipe calls for milk. Must be unsweetened though. Anyway, these were awesome! My family loved them!!! Will definitely make them again and again! Thank you for posting it!!!

I'm 15 and not a extremely good cook. I made this recipe for myself and my family. I doubled the recipe and made a dozen full sized muffins. This is one of the best recipes I have ever tasted, I think if you have a problem with too much sugar do what I did because it was absolutely perfect! I don't care if this is plagiarism from another fancy french cookbook because not everyone has access to all those recipes and also why would you even look at it if you already had a recipe! lay off the poster because they have added an amazing recipe to a lot of peoples cookbooks.

Made the recipe exactly as shown.  Only change was tossing in the cinnamon and sugar without the butter.  Just enough of the mix sticks without the greasiness.

They are delicious

I tried this recipe and we really liked it. I am not usually a fan of nutmeg, but it was really good in this recipe. I've  will make it again and use a glaze topping next time. Good, very simple recipe.

These tasted just like my aunts fried donuts! I made them in a cake pop pan, it made 20 donut holes. I did reduce the time to 11 mins. I also rolled them in powdered sugar, also a big hit!

Don't need 1/2 cup sugar for dipping.  Use a bit less.

I have made this many times. I made a mistake this morning and used cinnamon in place of the nutmeg. I noticed it too late so added 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice along with it. They were great. Then I made a second double batch using the apple cider suggested by another person and wish I had cut the sugar in that batch. It is still good, but would have been better with less sugar. I take these to a weekly church coffee corner and they are always a big hit.

Bet you can't just eat one !  It took about a tbsp. of batter for each mini muffin.  I made half with the sugar-cinnamon topping and half without.

I just made these and they are great! Nice thing is that they mix up easily without a lot of mess. The amount of mini muffins I got was 24... perfectly! Next time I might go lighter on the final step without using as much margarine & sugar.. maybe just a little and I would like to try them with powdered sugar instead. Great base recipe though!!

this recipe is great but I think with the sugar coating, it's too sweet. I would recommend cutting down the sugar in the batter because the coating will make the whole thing sweet enough. I also cut down the nutmeg powder and used only 1/2 a teaspoon. They were perfect like this!

I was looking for a new, easy muffin recipe and this was perfect! It was absolutely delicious and so quick and simple. I made it twice in a couple days. I only rolled the top of the muffins in the cinnamon sugar, and that seemed to be sufficient for the extra sugary kick. :)

I made these with a regular-sized muffin pan and used butter instead of margarine, but kept the recipe and baking time the same otherwise. I only ended up with 8 regular-sized muffins. On its own, the muffin tastes rather bland, though I think the nutmeg is a nice touch--albeit not the first thing you think of when it comes to "donut". The finished muffin did come out nice, moist, and had a pleasant texture, so props for that. With the cinnamon-sugar topping, these turn out quite tasty, but if you coat anything like this in cinnamon and sugar, it's already going to taste much better. They're very simple and easy to make and overall, not bad.

This is a wonderful recipe and these little gems are a great tiny bite to go along with a healthy breakfast!  I didn't change much, it is a perfect recipe as is, but I did use coconut oil instead of margarine and I don't believe it changed anything, however, I did add a pinch of salt to make up for the missing salt.  I also didn't use margarine for the dipping, I used butter, but only 2 tbsp and only dipped the top but I did roll the entire thing in sugar and it stuck fine with only the tops dipped.  There was still half of the butter still in the bowl, next time I will only melt 1 tbsp at a time.  I love the nutmeg flavor of these, they really do taste like little donuts. . .I wonder if powdered sugar would be good to dip into next time. . .Thanks Dianne, you made our scrambled egg breakfast much sunnier this morning!!

Do I even have to say how amazing these muffins are? 4 stars simply b/c you MUST REDUCE THE NUTMEG! 3/4 tsp is OVERKILL. 1/4 tsp for 24 muffins is PLENTY. And also: make sure melted butter is piping hot so the cinnamon sugar adheres and does not get "chunky". One of the best recipes I've found- so simply, easy, & delicious!

I made the mistake of making actual muffins instead of mini muffins and they didn't turn out well at all. They might have been better if they were miniature, but I doubt it because the dough just tastes weird.

I met up with a friend and I told her that I was bringing a treat along. I decided to try this recipe and it was a HUGE hit. She loved them and my kids couldn't get enough of them. I doubled the recipe and used only 3/4 tsp of nutmeg (I thought 1 1/2 tsp would have been too much and over-powering). I baked them in the mini mini muffin tins and got 47 muffins (I did a little taste testing, otherwise, I would have had 48). I then dunked them into butter and then into cinnamon sugar (I used a lot more than what is called for in the recipe), and let me tell you ... these are the best donut muffins I have ever made! These were gone in day and my 5 year old asked me to make them again. This is now my go-to recipe for donut muffins. Thanks for sharing, Dianne!

I made these yesterday, didn't have nutmeg so just sprinkled a little cinnamon in the batter. They were so good and my picky son loved them! He loved them so much that he made them again this morning but he altered them a little. He made a cream out of powdered sugar and peanut butter, poked a hole in the center of each and filled them with the peanut butter cream. Then he topped them with a chocolate icing. YUMMY!

I have made this recipe several times and it is one of our favorite breakfast treats.  The only change I made was to add some finely chopped walnuts. A great recipe!

My mom used to make these on weekends for breakfast when I was growing up.  I get great reviews every time I make them. They are moist, not crumbly, and they taste yummy with any or no topping!  I add butter and cinnamon sugar most of the time.  I also like to inject jam or preserves into the middle just before the cinnamon and sugar.  I thought I'd never find this recipe!  Thank you so much!

Okay,these are great... I did change a couple things though... I decided to fry them, since I had the oil in the pan anyway, and I didn't dip them in butter and follow with cinnamon and sugar, because, 1. too greasy, and 2. my kids don't like the cinnamon and sugar... I dropped them in the oil by the teaspoonful and they were the perfect size for my three under 5'ers... Very yummy, very very yummy!!! We'll be doing these again soon I'm sure!!!

Amazing! I usually double the recipe to make normal sized muffins. I made these for my bf and he loved them so much, he said I could crash his car and he'd forgive me if I gave him these. They have since been renamed "car crash muffins".

Very good!  My boys really liked them, too.  Since they were so small, I didn't bother to coat the entire muffin in the cinnamon sugar mixture at the end, just dipped the top half in margarine and cinnamon sugar.  I made them the night before and they were still very good the next day.

These are absolutely AWESOME!!! I followed the recipe exactly - the only change was that I didn't have mini-muffin tins so I used 12 regular size, and I also baked them for 10 minutes in a convection oven, I also used butter instead of margarine - and they went in one sitting between my husband and I. Personally, I think it was just the right amount of nutmeg.  I couldn't get enough of these, and will be making them often!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised how these turned out. I was a bit skeptical how they'd turn out because they didn't have any egg in them, but they were yummy! The only thing i would complain about is that i made them in regular muffin tins and it only made 9 (they weren't huge either) when i was expecting to get around 12 (since it's supposed to make 24 mini muffins) Apart from that i followed the recipe (left out the nutmeg though coz i didn't have any) and they were well received by the kids. I would make them again, they are very economical and great for school lunchboxes. They also freeze fine.

This is the easiest muffin recipe you will ever meet! To make it healthier, I substituted wheat flour and decreased the sugar. No one noticed a difference, and it was a lot less fattening. I'm so happy I found these muffins!

If your oven runs hot like mine, recommend adjusting temp to 350 and start keeping a close eye after 15 minutes.

I made these for our school drama production "At The Circus Big Top".  They were a huge hit.  I made the muffins a couple of hours ahead of time and kept them warm in my crock pot.  In order to serve them to order like real mini donuts, I transferred the warm muffins to a large bowl, drizzled with butter and then tossed them in the cinnamon and sugar just like real mini donuts. I put them in paper lunch bags, so it was just like the real thing.  The kids loved them, and this was so much safer then deep frying.  I made 216 donuts and sold out! ( our school is only 24 kids!)

Made it exactly as written. They were OK.  Made another batch with a few changes. Oven temp was reduced to 350 for 15 minutes.  Used 1/2 cup plus 2 TBSP sugar for the batter. Decreased nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. I got around 30, filling the mini cups halfway. Much better. I only dipped the tops in the melted butter and sugar.

This is nice, easy, but kids thought too much nutmeg.  Used donut baker instead of even, came out perfectly.  Skipped Butter on outside, just used sugar and cinnamon to coat.

These are awesome. I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg in the batter, and only used about 2 TBS margarine, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the topping (I just rolled the tops in the margarine, then cinnamon sugar). My boys devoured these in no time flat! Will definitely make these again for a breakfast treat or weekend snack.

They are heavy, and just too much spice. All we could taste when we bit into them were nutmeg and butter. It's a shame because the other reviews made this sound so good.

I absolutely love this recipe.   Saw it yesterday; made it for a thank-you gift and then had to make it today for my husband and myself before Lent starts.  So easy to make and all ingredients were in my pantry!   It will be used whenever we have houseguests!  No mixer required so I can quietly prepare it while houseguests are still sleeping.

Way, way, WAY too much nutmeg. So turned off by the taste of the recipe as written, I don't think I can bring myself to make it again, even cutting the nutmeg down. =(

My 10 yr old daughter & I made these this a.m. We followed the recipe exactly & they were very tasty. We coated the entire muffin with cinnamon suger, which was a bit too sugary for me but the kids loved them. They do taste like little donuts. Very good!

These are awesome muffins. The nutmeg makes them. The only thing I did differently was to make full sized muffins and sprinkle the tops with cinnamon and sugar BEFORE baking. They don't need the extra grease and mess. I tried them as originally written first and they are good, but they really soak up the butter, and I found them much more greasy than I cared for. Still 5 stars for a fantastic taste.

I thought this would be a fun breakfast when my daughter had a sleepover.  It ended up being one of those times when you wished you didnt try a new recipe on guests. Sorry, this just wasn't a good recipe for us.

So good!  I received a mini donut maker (Babycakes) for Christmas and have been looking for a good batter.  This is going to be my new go-to recipe!  Only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon.  So light and fluffy!  Filled each cup about 2/3 full and waited for light to turn green.   Made about 15 donuts.  Didn't use butter/sugar coating.  Delicious!

I didn't have nutmeg so I substituted with pumpkin pie spice . I also cooked them in my donut maker machine. I enjoyed the taste but thought it was overly sweet. I liked the light and fluffy texture. I also liked that there are no eggs in this recipe so my niece who has an egg allergy can enjoy it with us too. I am going to try these again but cut some of the sugar out and try it with the nutmeg.

Awesome recipe!  My mother used to make a recipe similar to this one when I was a kid and I was looking to make them after all these years.  This recipe was pretty close; I just added a teaspoon and a smidge of cinnamon to the batter along with the nutmeg.  Very tasty and sweet!

It was definitely easy to make and good. Mine were a little dry and that might have been because I brushed the top with butter, but did not dunk in the whole muffin in the butter as some reviewers said it made it soggy then and hard to keep in one piece. I left out the nutmeg and put in cinnamon because I did not have nutmeg. I used my 24 mini muffin pan and while I doubled the recipe, I only got 24 plus a bit more batter left for maybe 4 more which I did not make. I don't know why this happened. The size of my muffins looked like ones people posted, so not sure why I did not get 48. That is a huge difference and I double checked to make sure I did, in fact, double recipe and I did. 
I am not sure if I will make these again because as I said, they are kind of dry, but to be fair, I should make them again and roll the entire muffin in butter as it says.

A-MA-ZING! I tried one of these hot out of the oven, and I was completely blown away. 

Made only two minor changes from the original recipe: added just 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I think it gave just the right amount of spice without being overpowering. And instead of dunking in the melted butter, I only dipped the tops in. Afterwards, though, I still rolled the entire muffin in the cinnamon/sugar. (This made for a better coating on top, but still some coating on the sides/bottom.)

What I love about these is they are crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. In my book, that makes them better than donut holes! Caution: these are horribly addicting! If you're making them to serve more than two people, I would really consider doubling the batch. MOST DEFINITELY will make these again!

OMG!  These little muffins are addictive!  I have seen reviews and comments on the buzz about these donut muffins and I finally got around to trying them.  They are so little and cute that it is easy to pop four in your mouth before even thinking about it.  I can't make these often but for a special treat, these are great.

These are just okay as written and the only thing that makes these edible is coating them in cinnamon/sugar.  However, the batter is ripe for improvements.  Next time, I may add more spice (maybe apple or pumpkin pie spice) to the batter and increase the sugar but use brown sugar instead or a combination of both.  Then I would create a spice glaze and swirl the glaze into the batter before baking and glaze them afterwards.  As written, the batter after baking is not very pleasant until rolled in sugar/cinnamon.  Plagiarized or not, the recipe needs vast improvement.  I would give it only 1 star but it is very easy with very few ingredients.

I just added a few sprinkles of cloves and ginger to make it more like pumpkin pie. They were all gone in a half an hour among 5 girls. We really liked them. Just a note: if you don't have mini muffin tins, and you use regular size, they're going to be puffy disks, like the bottom of the muffin tin. If you cook them the recommended time, because disks are thinner, they'll be crispier on the bottom, which my friends didn't mind, but if you want lighter ones, just watch your timing. Although they look light and maybe still baking, they're probably already done. Thanks for the recipe! I don't care if it's in a cookbook that I'll never read somewhere. If you didn't post it, I wouldn't have it to share with my friends, so thank you very much.

Absolutely wonderful! My husband loved the crunchy outsides and tender middles. Made exactly as written and got 24. Just can't see the need to coat in butter before rolling in sugar/cinnamon, however. Adds unnecessary calories and they are fabulous without the butter...

These turned out a little tough for my taste--maybe I was really looking forward to a more "donut-y" texture that just didn't happen.
I used butter instead of margarine, so maybe that's where things went wrong.  These were good, but not great--the base dough recipe is a little bland with the blandness covered up by slightly excessive nutmeg and cinnamon.  They are easy to make, but I don't think that I would make them again.

These were awesome! I needed to make some cupcakes on the fly, but was missing Baking Soda, so I searched for a muffin recipe, and lo and behold! I made these little muffins, slapped some frosting on top, and voila! Perfect little cupcakes, and these are perfect for the Fall with the nutmeg. I used a regular muffin-sized pan, and it made seven.

Personally, I think the recipe called for too much nutmeg, and I am a nutmeg fan.  Next time I'll try cutting the nutmeg down and adding some cinnamon into the batter too.  I actually think with a different spice ratio, the muffins wouldn't need the sugar coating on the outside!  But good, and easy to make.

These aren't an amazing culinary masterpiece but I for what they are I have to give them 5 stars.  They are so simple, quick and tasty.  I can whip these up in just a few minutes and I think they would appeal to anyone.  My kids love them and I've made them for company when I was out of groceries and they enjoyed them as well.  crazy simple with only a few everyday ingredients.

I liked these a lot, but with significant tweaking. I uses a scant 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and I think any more would've been overwhelming (and I love nutmeg). I also found the all-over cinnamon/sugar coating too sweet. Next time I make these (and there will SO be a next time!), I think I'll just dip the tops in the butter and cinnamon/sugar mixture.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe as written and they were great!  My experience is they worked better in tin mini muffin pans over silicone mini muffin pans.  After you eat 4 or 5, you'll wonder why there are so few left and you'll have to make another batch.  They're quick to make so not a problem!

Since I try to be a "healthier" cook, I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup of Splenda for the batter part. It did not look like it would blend when you added the milk as it was very lumpy, but went ahead anyway. I used FF milk and 1/2 C. whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. They cooked perfectly in my Wilton 24 mini muffin pan in exactly 10 minutes. I rolled half of the muffins and cinn/sugar mix and the other half in powdered sugar. My kids loved both versions and they had no idea they were "Healthier".

I've made these muffins many mornings for my 4 kids.  We all love them!  They are quick to make with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I especially appreciate that they are egg free, which is necessary for my youngest son who has many food allergies.  I usually add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter for a little more of the fall spice flavor.  I double the recipe and they still only last a day in our house!  Wonderful recipe!

I got 20 out of one batch and 19 out of another, and I have the standard Wilton mini-muffin pan. I thought that they were good, and the dipping mixture was just the right amount for one batch. 15 minutes was a bit long for me, though, and I'd recommend 13 minutes or so. taking a star away just because I thought they were a bit sweet, though everyone else liked them.

These are easy, cheap and so yummy  Better than donuts.  As a personal preference, I did half the nutmeg.  This will be a "go to" recipe for me.

This recipe is awesome, but I was once baking these with my mom and we didn't have a mini-muffin pan, so we used a 9x13in. pan instead. After that we cut it into small squares, and it was still good!!!

Pretty good. Easy on butter. Actually just sprayed tops of muffins with butter and put cinnamon only on top so it wasn't do rich.

These were great!  My kids and husband loved them!  Furthermore, they are so simple.  I liked them so much that I tried them with a simple glaze: 2 cups confectioners sugar mixed with 6 tbsp milk.  Dip them in when warm and let them cool for a couple of minutes.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks!

All these glowing reviews . . . believe 'em. These little muffins really are incredible, and super easy to make. I used the amount of nutmeg indicated (freshly grated which usually packs more of a punch) and did not find it overpowering. Next time, I may add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter. More of a good thing is always a good idea!

Good recipe. We were out of nutmeg, so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead, and it really gave it this nice, autumn-y flavor. We also didn't have any mini muffin pans, so I just used the size that makes larger muffins and, although it made less, (about 12) they were larger and lasted longer. We also doubled the recipe, so they ended up being larger of a lesser quantity. They are also very easy for little hands to make. I should know: Me and my friend are both ten and it was a really easy to follow and do recipe. c:

My teenage son found this recipe and made it.  He follows it exactly and they are so marvelous.  He has to make a couple of batches, otherwise they are gone the minute he sets them out.  He often makes them to share with family friends and neighbours and gets rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for this one!

I am so glad this recipe came up on the AR homepage. I had been making these for years and lost mine! I found one an a different site but it wasn't the same. This one is it and yes these are easy and fantastic. Taste just like sugar donuts, better in fact than the ones you buy because these are trully fresh.

I really enjoyed these!  Very east to put together.  I used a min muffin pan-i barely got 18 muffins and mine did not rise above -but they tasted great!  They are very rich once you roll in butter, sugar mixture-so mini size is perfect.

The house smelled wonderful while they were baking!! I'm not a big donut lover but these little bites are YUMMY! I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp., which gave just enough flavor. I do think next time I will reduce the sugar as well.....just a little. Thanks so much for sharing! My family loves them!!

These are the best eggless muffins I have made but I do not use the nutmeg or roll them in the cinnamon sugar. I  add mini chocolate chips instead and my granddaughter who is allergic to eggs is thrilled each time I make them.

Great recipe. I hate nutmeg so I used cinnamon and a lil allspice.  I also used a mini bundt pan, so I was only able to make eleven.  Came out light and fluffy.  Will make again.

These are delicious. Family gobbled them up. Made exactly 24how in my pampered chef mini muffin pan. Also some reviews say its too much nutmeg. I think it depends on the nutmeg quality. I had store brand nutmeg thats a few months old so I used the full amount. If I had fresh gourmet quality nutmeg I would cut it in half. I used whole wheat flour and real butter. The whole wheat added a nutty flavor but also made them crumbly. Love how easy they are. In one hour they were made, eaten, and the dishes washed! Thanks! I will make these again.

This is a simple and good dish. The nutmeg seemed a little heavy. Used margarine but think butter would have been better. Also, for the dip, ran out of margarine so used an extra 2 Tbsp and it was perfect.  Will make it again with some modifications (including maybe trying cinnamon in place of nutmeg).

This is the easiest thing to make. It's actually easier than making pancakes from scratch - and without the cholesterol from eggs - probably a little healthier. And it's so delicious! We don't have mini muffin tins so we used traditional muffins. 

We also used white wheat whole grain flour because it's the only thing we had on hand. Delicious and "heartier" than a donut. 

My husband and I both feel like it's wiser to treat this as a muffin because the consistency is muffin-like. But, as such, this opens a brand new world of possibilities. Adding brain and cinnamon apple chunks! Blueberries! Fiber powder mix!

This is our new breakfast food and it's something I intend to wow the in-laws with the next time they're in town.

I didn't make any modifications (except the type of flour used) - and this was amazing.

This is very good!  My kids loved it and my neighbor wanted the recipe as well:)  was wondering if I could speed up the part of dipping in butter and covering with cinnamon sugar....  I am curious to try it with soy milk instead of milk and maybe glazed chocolate and just plain glazed the next time:)

these were great but I did have to make a few changes the first one which I would say everyone has to try is add molasses they were unreal and then when you go to the add sugar topping step just find a paper bag or big ziplock bag put the sugar and cinn. in the bag and then add mini muffins and shake

I call these "Can't have just one muffins."  So delicious and easy! I double the recipe and cook longer for regular sized muffins.  I also did some topped with powdered sugar glaze, and powdered sugar that were also delicious.  I love that these are made with ingredients we always have so I can make them whenever I get a craving!

I liked these because they weren't too sweet. Nothing super fancy about them, just simple and delicious. Exactly enough batter to make 12 regular size muffins.

Made great recipe even better by using homemade spiced applesauce for 1/2 margarine and nutmeg.  Didn't need as much butter for the top, as long as you had the spices when the muffins are still hot.  Had luck using 2nd half of the batter the following day for more.  Thanks.

Made them full sized instead of mini. So delicious, used whole wheat flour and offered them as a breakfast option at our school.  Made them at home for my family and they were a huge hit.

Used half whole wheat pastry and half all-purpose flour; 1/4 tsp nutmeg; reduced the topping sugar to 1/4 cup but left the cinnamon at 1 teaspoon and should have cut the topping margarine as well, as had about half left.  Got 18 mini's out of this.  Had sprayed the pan with PAM and they plopped right out when done.  15 minutes cooking time was perfect in my oven.  Thanks for sharing!  (No one guessed about the substitution of ww flour!)

I am nearly 6 months pregnant, and this afternoon, I NEEDED something sweet. These were prepared, baked, and ready to eat in 30 minutes... and very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written except for one thing: I used regular-sized muffin tins and made 6 medium-sized muffins instead of 24 minis. The baby and I approve of this recipe ;)

My family and I LOVE this recipe! Very good. Although, please note - you do not need as much butter as it calls for, even if  you cover the entire muffin! I'd say just go by feel and melt however much you need

So here's the thing: I don't bake.  At the very most, I bake two times a year.  But this recipe made me want to bake these, because I love those cinnamon donuts and it makes me sad I can only get them at fairs.  So after months, I finally bucked up and did it.  And they are INCREDIBLE.  I don't know how, but they really do taste just like cinnamon donuts.  It's uncanny.  And they are so easy to make, it's ridiculous.  The only change I made was I had to use sour cream because I didn't have any milk.

This is almost the same as a recipe I've been using for over 20yrs. The changes are...1/4 tsp nutmeg, use shortening instead of the butter or marg, in the batter(the batter stays whiter) and before you bake, drizzle the melted butter (use butter for this part) over top of each muffin and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar mix, then bake.

Sifting the flour and baking powder will lend a better texture as well as adding a pinch of salt and the grating (using a microplaner) of one lemon for its zest.  A more complex flavor can be had with some high qualiy vanilla and use half of the nutmeg.  Many kudos for a no egg recipe.  I liked the simple quickness of this recipe, but would choose to only sugar coat the tops  Sometimes less is more

Made exactly as written.  Child tested.  Child approved.  Son ate one and said to make another batch and to replace his daily after school and lunch chocolate chip cookies with these from now on.  That is good enough for me.   And so much quicker than the cookies!  Thanks for the recipe! (my mini muffin pan size made 18 muffins - it is a toaster oven muffin pan)----edit----I just mixed the butter into the sugar with a fork and did not use a whisk or mixer at all.  They are muffins, not cupcakes and a whisk or mixer would likely overwork the batter.

WARNING!!! You will NOT be able to stop eating these!!! Followed the recipe to the T & they came out AMAZING. Never imagined such a simple recipe could be so good. Only thing is that I only used about 1/3 of the sugar/cinnamon topping. So I will just make less next time, and there will definitely be a next time!! Thank you!!

YUM!! And super easy.....I substituted pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any nutmeg.  I would recommend doubling the recipe as I only got about 20 mini muffins out of the recipe as written.  They are gone already......thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

Definitely delicious but not completely memorable? I'm not sure I'd remember to make these again. Other reviewers are right, it's more like a dense donut hole.  Very sweet.

I followed this recipe to a T.  They're good, but nothing wowed me.  they are very east to make and really make sure you don't overfill your tins.  I did on a few, when I dipped them into the butter they fell apart.  And they are cuter without the crown. I'll still make these again, but they're just okay.

Very fast and easy. Taste pretty good. I took them to ladies' bible study and everyone said "oh look donut holes!" I think the key ingredient is definitely the nutmeg. I wouldn't leave it out!

These were ok.  I thought that the nutmeg was a little overwhelming (although I do not like nutmeg, so that may just be my preference).  They also came out a little dry.  I would recommend cooking them for slightly less time.  I also made a glaze for them instead of coating in butter and sugar because I didn't like the idea of soaking them in butter.  Not bad, but I would make a few tweaks

Wow! Just close your eyes and you'll swear it's a donut! As written, however, the nutmeg is over-powering. I like nutmeg, but it's the first and last thing you taste.  Hubby even said..."these are awesome! But can you make it taste not so much like egg nog?" So the second time I cut back to 1/2 t. and perfecto!  The only change I made otherwise was to use butter instead of margarine.  Thanx Dianne!

these are fantastic! made them for my parents this morning and they loved them! i may mix a little bit of cinnamon into the muffins too next time, just because it may add some more flavor to the muffins themselves, but they're still delicious otherwise! thank you so much for submitting this recipe! i will definitely use it again, most likely very soon!

These were not good. I did not like the texture, and they tasted nothing like donuts. If you called them Cinnamon-Sugar Muffins, then I might give them a better rating, but I was really expecting a much lighter texture. Sorry.

So this turned out ok. It is overly nutmeg flavored. I like nutmeg but this was a little over the top. I used a standard mini muffin pan and only got 20 they were only in for 15 minutes and they got hard. They didn't burn but as soon as they cooled they were rock hard. I liked them ok. they didn't really taste like doughnuts. I only give 3 starts because my picky toddler loved them.

Yummy!  Just finished a batch of these delightful little muffins and couldn't wait for them to cool before trying one.  Our church has an annual bake sale and I will be making these to take.  Quick and easy recipe.  I only dipped the tops in melted butter and sugar mixture and that was plenty of sweetness.  Thnaks for a great recipe.

Could not resist trying them. I used vanilla butternut extract in mine & powder buttermilk. I used Tassie Pans. I basted the warm muffins with melted butter. Then tossed them in a plastic bag with sugar and cinnamon. Next I'm adding pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices. We all agree they taste like cake doughnuts. 
I must have read 50-60 reviews. Can't imagine how they wouldn't come out for everyone. EASY TO MAKE !!

The texture is great, easy to make, wonderful to eat, but I found the muffin to be lacking in flavor a little. I think added pumpkin or an extract would really help. Other than that, it was GREAT!

I made these - LOVED that the recipe is super quick and easy - I am not a fan of nutmeg and wish I had cut back on the 3/4tsp - I didn't quite put the full amount as it was but in the future I will most likely omit it altogether - AND two words people - CINNAMON SUGAR - fabulous topping!

Little bites of deliciousness covered with sweet cinnamon!  What's not to like?  I used fresh grated nutmeg, probably about an eighth of a teaspoon and they are delicately flavored, crisp on the outside and tender in the middle.   YUM!

I have not made these yet because I have a question.  They sound wonderful but what if I only have a regular muffin tin of 12 and don't want to buy a mini muffin tin for just this one recipe?  Will it still work?  After I find out the answer then I will make them if I can use a regular muffin tin and rate them.
Thank you.

Should not have given this a 5 star rating.  Made them with the 1/4 brown and 1/4 white sugars and also 1 tsp vanilla.  They did not thrill my husband.  He said they were "OK" but would be fine if I didn't make them again.  Oh well!

This recipe had a very bland flavor to it. I used mini cupcake pans and greased the pan as directions intended to do so. I then baked the cupcakes for the minimum amount of time and the "doughnut cupcakes" were burnt on the bottom. Will not make again.

These are super yummy. I made them way back in the day when they were the recipe group pick, and I forgot to review them. But, I would definitely recommend these. Thanks for sharing, Dianne!

I will make these again but with less nutmeg. Would have given 5 stars, but they were quite heavy on the nutmeg for our taste.  Easy to make!

I literally just made these for my boys.  they are going fast!!  I followed the recipe exactly but made them in my "babycakes donutmaker". Takes only 4 minutes to make 6 mini donuts.  I think I got @ 18 out of this recipe.   yummy!

These are FANTASTIC!!!!!!! "Cake like" donuts are the only ones that I like, and these are just like them!! They are PERFECT!!!!  I also experimented with a quick glaze, and also with coating them in powdered sugar!  All are good but, cinnamon is the best!!

Ok, I love this recipe! I make it all the time but I always double it. I never dip in butter then cinnamon and sugar. I just add a crumb topping. This time I wanted to try something different so I didn't double the recipe. I messed up and added twice the butter and thought they were ruined but it made them lighter! I sprayed the mini muffin pan and then covered the bottoms of the cup in cinnamon and sugar, then put about half a tsp of batter in and covered the tops with cinnamon and sugar. They came out  great!! I don't know why anyone would dip them in butter, it is so much easier to just add the cinnamon and sugar before you bake them! With the crumb topping and made as small muffins, they are great too!

Yum, yum, yum! I just made these and followed the recipe to the "t" and they came out fantastic. Really do taste like little donuts and how can that be a bad thing?!
I think my oven is a bit warm so they were mildly overdone but still tasted amazing so I'm going to re-do the recipe again tomorrow with a few less minutes on the timer. Can't wait to bring these to a friend's party tomorrow night....don't think I'll be bringing any leftovers home that's for sure. 
Thanks for the great recipe

These are a little piece of heaven!  After reading a few of the reviews, I doubled the recipe (I knew I would have to "taste-test" a few).  I can't wait to take these to work tonight!  Thanks Dianne.

super recipe, just the right size too ! Gave it 4 stars because it was just a little too sweet for me, followed the recipe exactly.I used butter and it made 10 muffins, my pan must be a larger mini muffin one. Plus, it is eggless , too good ! Next time though, i will add less sugar. I also used a pastry brush to brush butter on top, instead of dipping them in butter. Everyone loved these !

I made these this morning . They turned out quite well . The muffins were very tasty and had a nice texture . But , I felt they were lacking something like a filling or a frosting . Any suggestions for something of the sorts ? Thank you ! :)

Very easy and good.  I rolled mine in the butter and was generous with rolling them in the sugar mixture and it ended up being a little too much sugar.  Next time I will dip the top half only.  They probably aren't company worthy but worth making again when looking for something more than your typical weekday breakfast.

I made these as directed, only subbing in butter. They tasted delicious, but the topping/coating is overkill; just sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar.

These are fabulous! I didn't bother with dipping each muffin. Instead, I brushed the melted butter over the tops of the muffins and sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar. I'll definitely be making these again! Also, be careful of the cook time since mine were done pretty quickly.

Awesome!  Was still great when I subbed my fave gluten-free flour mix and subbed light coconut milk for the milk.  i also reduced nutmeg to 1/2 tsp as i'm not a huge fan, but i couldnt even taste it.  I thought the butter (sub) was rather heavy, and will probably try some alternate toppings next time - but so good my 15 yo got in trouble for eating 15 of them by himself .. . leaving 9 for the other 4 of us . . .. oops.

DELISH!!!  I made these little gems to go along with some fruit and other muffins for my 9 year old's sleepover with his friends - they were a hit!  I too cut the nutmeg down to 1/2 tsp and when they were done baking, I just dipped the tops in the melted becel, threw them in a baggie with the cinnamon sugar and tossed to coat!  YUMMY :)

I loved this recipe! It is soooo simple and there are so many things you can do to switch it up a bit! I did only use 1/4 teas. of nutmeg though, because im not a huge nutmeg fan. Other then that I it was great and very cheap to make!

These little muffins are amazing!!!  Wow!  I couldn't believe only a few ingredients turned into this!  They totally tasted like donuts-in my opinion, similiar to the Hostess Cake glazed donuts.  These were snatched up before I knew it.  Easy, quick and really good recipe!

These are really good but i would use 1/2  to 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg its to strong of a flavor and 1/2 a cup of butter to dip them in as i ran out but other then these few things they were great.

Tasty but the sugar/cinnamon mixture is overkill. Found it better to just dip the tops...rolling the whole thing in butter or margarine then in the mix was wayyyy too sweet. Also, maybe powdered sugar would taste better. Will try them again. Good recipe, though, with many options for adjustment.

These are yummy balls of joy!  I think the recipe should be doubled automatically.  I made 24, but a serving is 3 at the minimum.  Thanks for the recipe Dianne.

I was disappointed in these muffins.  Tastefully Simple has a product called Cinnamon Muffin Melts that are similar, but OH so much better than these.  I was really hoping that these would be similar to the Tastefully Simple ones since they are like $6/box of mix.  However, these reminded me more of a refrigerated biscuit dough.  I'll try some others on the site to try and find a similar one.  Oh, we still ate all of these, though!

These are just WONDERFUL.  Thumbs up from all my kids!  I was skeptical at first; wondering what made them taste "donut" but gosh darn the name is right!  These darling little muffins are so yummy and easy.  I followed some advice of others and didn't dip my muffin in melted butter.  I brushed the tops and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over them while they were hot and that was just enough taste.  They didn't rise at all and so I would definitely fill them more than 1/2 way.  I would definitely double if not triple the recipe as the first batch went so quick.  Also based on recommendations of other reviewers used 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg which was just enough (I hate nutmeg anyhow).

I found these to be a little on the dry side straight out the oven but became more moist after being packaged up for a day or so. Next time I will use oil instead of margarine or replace 1/2 of the milk called for with oil as my family enjoys moist baking. Flavour was perfect - exactly the donut hole flavour I was expecting! Since I was baking for spice enjoyers, I used a mix of 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves in place of the 3/4 tsp nutmeg called for in the batter for a nice spicey flavour. This worked well. Thank you for a great recipe!

A big hit with everyone!  I coated half the batch (I got 24) with another reviewer's vanilla icing and some sprinkles and coated the other 12 with the cinnamon sugar mix. People said the vanilla iced ones tasted just like sprinkle donuts!

the only change I made to the batter was to use less nutmeg. I used just under 1/2 tsp. The batter tasted good prior to baking. Used a Pampered Chef mini muffin pan, made 24. Put about 3/4 TBS of batter in each well. Used confectioner's sugar, chocolate ganache, and cinnamon/sugar to coat muffins. it was alright, but won't make again.

I made these muffins for a snack at the preschool where I teach.  90 percent of the children commented how great they were and how they were "the best snack ever."  100 percent of the children ate them and loved them.  My co techer even asked for the recipe.  This is a keeper!

I thought these were delicious! I couldnt believe how fast they were to prepare! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as well which gave them  more flavour. The cinnamon and sugar topping makes these fantastic! Will be making these again for sure =)

These are so quick and easy and my grandkids loved them!  Just like popping in a donuts hole in your mouth from the bakery.  Delicious and simple to make

I made these this morning and everyone loved them!  It made 24 little muffins, 2 Weight Watchers points each.  I cut back on the nutmeg a tiny bit - I have a Pampered Chef adjustable measuring spoon and I put it between 1/2 tsp and the 3/4 tsp called for, and I thought it was perfect.

These are awesome! I do not have a mini muffin pan, so I just used my regular sized muffin pan and ended up with 8 muffins. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as well. Next time I make these, I will probably double the recipe.

Good recipe. The only thing I'd change is the nutmeg. I used 1/2 tsp  as suggested by reviewers. I will use even less next time. I made 1/2 cinn sugar and 1/2 glazed. I didn't dip them in butter either. I will definitely make again. This time with less nutmeg, lol.

These are so yummy.  My husband LOVES donuts, but doesn't eat them often because he's always watching his weight.  These are a healthier alternative.  I rolled them in powdered sugar and cinnamon without using any melted butter and they were so good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe (almost) exactly. I didn't have nutmeg so I substituted the pumpkin spice in the same amount. I also followed the baking times and they were a little well done after 15 minutes. We loved them. I love to bake but typically, the baked goods get sent to work, school or neighbors because we don't eat them that much. These stayed in my house and lasted 2 whole days before they told me to make some more. The first batch I used butter. The second batch, made today, I used margarine. No difference in flavor. I also cooked them for 12 minutes and they are perfect. Based on the butter/sugar/cinnamon add on at the end, I did cut it down so I wouldn't have as much left over. I quadrupled the batch I made today and only tripled the topping. It was perfect. I will be making these again and again. Loved them!

OMG!!!!
What is wrong with me????  I made this recipe and cut the nutmeg back like everyone said and put a little cinnamon in the dough.  I used butter instead of margarine like someone suggested.  I was able to divide the dough between 24 mini muffins (Yay me!).  The dough tasted yummy by the way!  I baked for 10 minutes while I was sitting here reading other recipes, reviews, etc.  I was smelling this wonderful aroma and getting all cocky--I was thinking I should get on Amazon and order my son some mini muffin pans because he loves cinnamon sugared food and doesn't mind cooking.  Then the timer went off and I looked in the oven......
Some of my muffins looked kind of rugged and sort of raised and some were just totally over running the cups and flat flat flat!  I let them cook a few more minutes before taking them out of the oven.  Guess what!?  they were so stuck to the pans even though I had sprayed each cop with Pam.  24 mini muffins turned into 17 muffins.  I guess I ate the other 7 crumb by stuck crumb!  These are so good but I need to work at making mine look like the pictures.

I doubled the recipe and it made 12 regular size muffins. I tried dipping the muffin in the melted margarine as stated in the recipe, but it didn't seem to work too good for me. Instead, I used a pastry brush and brushed the muffins while they were still in the muffin pan. I then sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon mixture on top. I had some of the sugar mixture left over. Everyone in my family loves these.

Because anything with flour usually needs some salt and these desperately need that at least.  I think they could be fluffier.  Perhaps using half brown sugar instead of straight sugar.  Its important to cook only until lightly golden brown, that is what makes them softer and moist.  Also fill the cups to the rim and they will puff up like a muffin, also pull down the temp to 350, baking for closer to the 15 minute side of the 20 minute top range.  20 is too long.  These probably wont taste like you think they will.

These were wonderful- a perfect little snack! Even my little brother likes them and he only eats hot dogs and pizza! My father does not like nutmeg, though, so I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg and they came out great.

I just baked these an hour ago and they are very good! After reading some reviews, I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the batter instead of the 3/4 tsp of nutmeg it calls for. Make sure you add a generous amount of the coating because the muffin absorbs it pretty quickly. :)

So yummy! This is a great recipe to stir up quickly.  I used less nutmeg, to make a bit more child-friendly.  I also baked at 350 for only 18 minutes in a dark mini-muffin pan.  I think what makes these muffins "donut"-ish is being careful not to overbake and rolling entire muffin in butter and sugar.

Delicious! I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of the full 3/4 tsp and thought they were absolutely perfect. Mine didn't puff up, but I don't care-they tasted fantastic. I did 1/2 in the cinnamon sugar and the other 1/2 in a glaze-both were awesome (if you glaze them, set them on wax paper so they don't stick and rip). Now I just have to go buy another mini muffin pan so I can double the recipe :)

these are really good. I got twenty mini muffins out of it. After reading alot of reviews i reduced the nutmeg to a scant 1/2tsp. could probably do a full 1/2tsp. The muffins had a nice flavor and very close to a donut hole. Which is really nice since i don't get donuts often.

Wow a great quick and (big) versatile recipe. Taste like donuts (more like Tim Horton's not Krispy Kreme) and so adaptable to changes as obvious in the reviews. The list is endless as to what you can coat these donut bits, glaze icing is my favourite. Heck I like to make them a bit larger and using a piping bag squirt jam or pudding in center.

These were OK, but just not really much more than that. The family wasn't thrilled with the strong spice flavors, will try to modify the basic recipe (which I think has a lot of potential) to make a version my guys will prefer. Thinking about a chocolate version...

Easy and just as it says, tastes like a donut and a muffin! Be careful not to use too much nutmeg!

Like others I used 1/2 the nutmeg, and used a regular muffin pan.  These were soooo good!

Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with 24 wonderful little mini gems! YUMMY! My son said through a stuffed mouth that they were really good, so there's a kid's perspective, too. Definitely one of those easy recipes that makes people think you are a whiz in the kitchen. Love that. :o)

These are fantastic.  My husband got a sweet tooth at the end of a busy day, so I looked for a recipe that was quick, and didn't require any eggs (I ran out that day). And since I was qoing for simplicity, I baked this recipe in an 8x8 glass pan. FANTASTIC. After baking for about 20 minutes, I brushed the top (liberally) with melted I Can't Believe It Not Butter (it's pretty much all I use), then sprinkled with the sugar/cinnamon mix (you only need half of what's called for if you make them this way) very liberally.  We ate just about all of them.  I found the nutmeg to be a perfect contrast to the sugar and cinnamon. For a Thanksgiving twist, I'm considering making this with pumpking pie spice.  I'll check more reviews and see if anyone else has tried making them that way. All in all: THIS IS A FANTASTIC TREAT.When you're in a hurry or when you're not!

These muffins are so good my three year old was so upset this morning that we did not have any more 'cinnamon muffins' because grandma kept them all at her house for her company she loved them so much.  He begged to helped me make more so we are off to do so.  I did cut the sugar and nutmeg amounts a bit as we try to watch our sugar intake and are not big spice fans but they were fabulous!   Definately going to be made many times and share the recipe with family and friends!

Oh my. These are amazing. I will be making and sharing these often. They tasted and felt more like a doughnut hole the day after I had made them, as opposed to fresh out of the oven.

Very good! My 11 old son loves them! The first time I made them as directed and they were so good! I have made modifications since. Whole wheat flour instead of regular all-purpose, applesauce instead of butter, and halved the sugar, reduced nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, added 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I did brush the tops with 1 tbs of butter and lightly sprinkled w/ cinnamon and sugar. A lot heathier and just as good for us. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were just okay. The muffins without the topping were pretty good, but the topping didn't really work with the muffins, in my family's opinion. Will keep the muffins recipe as we did like their taste; we'll just leave the topping off.

Very good, but I highly recommend you "up" the servings, because as is, it makes such a little batter.  Granted, I made the regular size cup cakes, the batter only filled 9.  I would double or triple the recipe.  We enjoyed ours without the cinnamon topping, and the taste is still very reminiscent of a donut!   A keeper!

There is no way you could mess this recipe up if you follow it right. Just don't bake them too long. I took mine right out the pan and dipped them in the butter and then into the sugar and cinnamon. I would rather eat these then the store bought donut holes. These are totally awsome!!!

Delicious! I add a little less nutmeg (but they do need some nutmeg- it's necessary whether you think you like nutmeg or not!), and I also add cinnamon to the batter.

Next time I will halve the nutmeg because it was a little too nutmeg-y for my taste. Since my husband is allergic to cinnamon, I had to omit it for some of the muffins. It still tasted good with or without cinnamon.

The first batch of these I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious and devoured that day!  I made a double batch on day 2, and, following suggestions from other reviewers, I kept the nutmeg at 3/4 tsp for the double batch and added a tsp of vanilla.  I didn't think these could get better, but they did!  Thanks for the great recipe.

These turned out very good.  I changed the recipe to make it more diabetic friendly ( only 1/4 cup sugar and used Sweet & Low).  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I didn't like it with the topping so I left it off.

I made these donut muffins last night because I had about a half hour to spare and thought my daughter would like some home-made goodies to take to work for her break.  I thought I had nutmeg but I didn't so I used some pumpkin pie spice (less than a half teaspoon)and they turned out really good.  My daughter tried a couple when they were still warm and gave me her ok. I think it's because she loves anything that has sugar and cinnamon on it.  She can be pretty picky about things so her approval of these donut muffins meant they were ok to make again.  The recipe said to start off using a large bowl which I did but then I ended up doing a lot of scraping of the bowl to use up the last few little muffin tin spots.  Next time, Ii'll use a much smaller bowl.  These donut muffins do kind of taste like donut holes and they're a great snack to make when you don't have a lot of time to fuss with a recipe.

I made these for a potluck at work. Instead of melting the butter and dipping them, I put them in a large ziplock with the cinnamon and sugar. They were good, but I think they could use some vanilla or something in the batter.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out perfect.  I don't understand the donut reference because there is no similarity in taste.  Maybe because they look like donut holes rolled in sugar.

My daughters and I enjoyed these.  We found that more melted butter rolling and less cinnamon/sugar rolling was better.  If there is too much cinnamon/sugar on it, the flavor is lost.  Overall, a great brunch item with a great texture.

These were really great and easy to make! However, I did modify the recipe. I used a scant half teaspoon of nutmeg and that was plenty--I might even go with a little less next time. I also have to find a better way to coat the donuts in the cinnamon sugar because it came out too thick and sugary. Maybe superfine sugar would work? Anyways, these were a hit and I'll definitely be making them again. Thanks!

These turned out perfectly!  I followed the directions exactly.  At first I thought the nutmeg would be too much but I was wrong it was perfect!  They are a new family favorite.

Very Good recipe! I changed it a little by using 1/2 tea. of nutmeg and 1/4 tea. cinnamon, instead of 3/4 tea. nutmeg. And I made a vanilla glaze instead of rolling it in the cinna-sugar mix. This is a recipe I will make again!

I made these to take to the beach today as a snack for the family..To say the least they are amazing and everyone loved them. I made them exactly as suggested except I made 12 big ones instead of 24 seeing as how I did not have the mini muffin tins and they turned out perfect.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Yummy!!!!! I used butter and they were delicious. I also decreased the Nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and it was perfect. Thanks so much for the recipe.

These were very good! I didn't have a mini muffin pan, so I used a regular-sized muffin pan and it made about 9 muffins. I dipped the tops in butter and then rolled the whole muffin in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I would love this in the mini size. The only change I made with the ingredients was to use 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. I feel like I might even reduce it to 1/8 teaspoon next time, as I'm not big on that flavor. Great recipe!

My family really enjoyed these. I think it's the coating that makes it so good. The bare muffin itself was just okay. They were easy to make and VEGAN! I reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp as others suggested. I did not dip them in melted margarine (actually used Earth Balance) at first and the sugar/cinnamon adhered nicely. After about 16 muffins, they had cooled down to the point were I needed the melted margarine to get the sugar/cinnamon to stick. We liked the non-margarined version, so I will have to work faster next time. I used my OXO small cookie scoop/disher to portion the batter and got 24 mini muffins. They're very pretty too, so they'll add some sparkle to a holiday table.

I just made this for my co-workers and family. Quite the hit, everyone loved it! I didn't dip the entire finished muffin in the butter, just the top, and dipped the top in the cinnamon sugar. It made it look adorable.

I followed this recipe exactly but it didn't have the taste I was expecting. I was hoping for a donut-y kind of muffin but mine just tasted like muffins. My boyfriend loved them though. I used a regular sized muffin tin because that was all I had. I made 3 separate coating options of the cinnamon sugar, white frosting (found on this site) and chocolate frosting. I also had some plain, but i liked the cinnamon sugar one more.

These are really good! I give them five stars even though I feel there is to much nutmeg.  I love nutmeg but it kinda of even overpowers the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Next time I will cut the nutmeg in half.  Otherwise moist and delicious and who knew even without an egg.  Thanks for the fun recipe!

Yummy!!  Hubby rated them a 4 of 5, which is pretty spectacular since he isn't a huge fan of nutmeg.  Instead of dipping them in butter, I simply put the warm muffins into a freezer bag with the suger/cinnamon mix and shook.  Dipping them in butter sounds wonderfully delicious, though.  I might have to try it that way the next time I make them.  Thanks for a delicous recipe!

Well so much for my diet. Haha. These were fantastic. Easy to make. I think dipping the doughnuts in the butter before the cinnamon sugar is not necessary. I ran out of butter so about 7 doughnuts didn't get dunked in the butter just the cinnamon sugar and it still stuck to them and was perfect and I actually enjoyed more than the ones dipped in butter. Try it, see what you think. Well, I am now going to go run around the block to burn off the calories.

These are absolutely delicious.  I asked my husband to make them for me while I was busy and he did.  I had to tell him where to find the mini pans and paper cups.  Other than that he did great.  Rather then grease the tins we used the paper cups.  I can't stand having to clean out the tins from greasing.  As a result,  just the tops were dipped into the butter and sugar/cinnamon and they were perfect.  Tasted just like donut holes.  They will not last the day.  Thanks bunches for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

Yum!  We really liked these!   I used 2 T melted butter and 2 T coconut oil, only 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, and subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour.  I also cut the sugar back a little bit - next time I'll only use 1/3 c.  I sprinkled them with cinnamon and demera sugar.  They were awesome!  This made 18 mini muffins for me.

We loved these!  I am not a huge fan of nutmeg, so I did reduce that down to about 1/4 (didn't measure, just eyeballed it) and added a little cinnamon to the mix, and it turned out great.  I didn't add the butter and cinnamon/sugar to the tops this time (trying to shed a few pounds) but they were great without it, I just know how good they would have been WITH it!  YUMMY!  Will make many more times!!!!!

These are very good.  I only added 1/2 t. nutmeg as others suggested.  It would have been too strong if I had added the full amount.  I did not dip them in butter after they cooked...only the cinnamon and sugar.  I love how the bottoms and edges had a crispy texture.  Like another reviewer said, they really taste nothing like donuts.  But they are very yummy mini muffins!  In fact, I plan on giving some in baskets at Christmas!  Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this recipe!!  Made it for the grandkids and they loved it!  Said it was their new favorite muffins.  So quick and easy to make that I made two batches in about 20 minutes.  I made one batch in the regular muffin size and baked it for 20 minutes and they turned out perfect.

I used 1/2 t nutmeg after reading everyone's comments, and they were great. For some reason it only made 10 regular muffins and didn't quite make it past the rim. Still amazing and so easy.

These were disappearing before I had them all sugared, and they didn't last 10 minutes in my family!  My mini muffin tin must be REALLY mini, as I filled the 24 spots halfway/three quareters full and I had batter left over.  I have a dark nonstick mini muffin tin, and I think I may need to reduce the temp just a little, as they were just slightly browned on top but quite done on the bottom and sides, and ended up somewhat crunchy, which I didn't consider a plus.  I also used only half the butter/sugar/cinnamon topping, and just dipped the tops.

Great recipe!  The first time I tried these I doubled the recipe but instead of doubling the overpowering nutmeg I used 3/4 t. nutmeg and 3/4 t. pie spice.  Also, I used 1/4 c. melted butter and 1/4 c. applesauce to reduce the fat but still have some rich flavor.  I omitted the butter in the topping and placed 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 c of sugar in a sandwich-sized zippered baggie and tossed 2-3 right out of the oven muffins and shook to coat.  Placed them on a cooling rack and zipped up the leftover sugar mixture for the next batch.  My kids and husband loved them!  A double batch yielded exactly 3 dozen muffins for me.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

THESE MUFFINS WERE AWFUL if you follow the recipe to a T. We did however really LOVE the flavor of the muffins WITHOUT all the butter and cinnamon sugar mixure. To eat these first thing in the morning will give you a sugar high for DAYS!!!!!  No one in my family liked these with the topping, but loved them plain! Plus look at it this way, your saving yourself a LOAD of calories and sugar by eliminating it.  I give it 3 stars because we did enjoy the muffins, just not the donut part. Still trying to figure out how everyone could eat more than one.

They would be better with LESS nutmeg. Too much of a nutmeg flavor---it overwhelms the muffin. I am going to lower to 1/4 tsp next time.

Wow these really do taste like a mini donut! I used half/half instead of milk because I was out of it. Next time I make these I may reduce the cooking time a little, and mix up less of the cinammon sugar topping, I had quite a bit left over.

these were DELICIOUS!!  my kids loved them (my 14 yo even declared he was making these for breakfast tomorrow himself!). I did not have mini muffin pans, so I made them into regular size muffins.  To do so, I doubled the recipe & cooked at 375 for 18 min's.  This made 11 muffins (I filled muffin cups 1 inch from top). They came out PERFECT.  thanks for posting this recipe!

I was expecting a lot more from this because of all the great reviews, however, I thought they had no flavor and just wern't very good. My boyfriend ended up eating them all just because they were there, but he wasn't crazy about them either.

These donut muffins were amazing!! After reading the other reviews,  I couldn't wait to bake. Followed the recipe exactly. This is great for when you don't have eggs at home. But try eating just one...

THESE ARE WONDERFUL!  I don't usually post reviews but these are sooooo good.  I had saved the recipe awhile back and just finished them.  Not the best thing trying to diet!    I used real butter.  Then dipping it in cinnamon made it almost fried like.  I will be making these again very soon and will take some for our youth group!  THANK YOU for the recipe!

My muffin hating husband loves these! They definitely have the texture of and similar taste to a cake donut hole. I had cinnamon/sugar mix left over but I think making less would have made it difficult to get the muffins fully coated easily. These would get 5 stars but they're so sweet they make my teeth itch a bit. I will be making these again.

I made these with whole wheat flour and they turned out okay...with white they would have been MARVELOUS! I have said before that nutmeg can make or break a recipe..don't change the amount on this one its perfect. I also would half the cinnamon sugar as it yields a massive amount waaay more than you need for this recipe. I'm gonna try this next time with pumpkin pie spice, white chips, and some cream to moisten the batter a little. Guess we'll see what happens. Thanx for sharing.

Tasty!  A couple of quick things:  I don't have a mini muffin pan, so I used a regular one and made twelve of these.  They had to cook the full twenty minutes.  Also, I thought I'd make things easier on myself and use paper muffin liners--big mistake, the muffins stick to the liners like crazy!  So I wound up leaving the muffins in the liners and only putting the butter and cinnamon-sugar combo on the tops (a pastry brush came in handy for this).  The only other change I made was to reduce the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon, as a personal preference.  They were excellent, thanks!

My kids love this and always ask for these when they have sleepovers.  I usually just add some cinnamon or pumpkin spice and do not do the butter and sugar over-top.

Very good, the only reason 4 stars is because we will be changing the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. & 1/2 tsp. cinn. We made it exactly as written with the following options on the topping, 1) rolled completely in melted butter & cinn/sugar topping 2) dipped top in melted butter & cinn/sugar 3) sprinkled cinn/sugar on prior to baking. The votes came in the same best was #1, next #2, next #3.  Thanks, this will be a nice addition to our recipe box.

I'm not a big fan of cake donuts, but one of my co-workers loves them, so I made these as a surprise for her.  Turns out I really liked them, too!  By scraping the mixing bowl with a silicone spatula, I had just the right amount of batter for 24 mini muffins.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to dip the whole muffin in the butter and cinnamon sugar or just the tops, so I started out doing the whole muffins.  When I realized I was swiftly running out of melted butter, I switched to dipping just the tops.  I'll definitely make these again, but I'll need to double the recipe because 24 wasn't enough once we realized how delicious they are!  Thanks for a great recipe, Dianne!

Uh oh. These are so good and so easy - I predict making many more in the near future and eating most of them myself! Next time I will use unsalted butter to dip them in before rolling in sugar, as the butter really overpowered everything else. I also won't roll the whole thing in sugar, as other reviewers said. Thanks, will make over and over!

Wow! These were extremely easy and quick to make. My only change was substituting cinnamon applesauce for the margarine. And, I only needed to bake for 12 min.

My kids seemed to really like these. I used regular sized muffins and after they were cooked I tossed then around in a plastic bag. I thought It had too much sugar/cinnamon on it. I think next time I'll just coat the tops so I can enjoy it as well. This was a good recipe and I know I'll be making these again.

these were pretty good.  i did toss in cinnamon sugar when they were still warm, therefore i did not use the extra melted butter.  to me they were kinda dry on day 2.  i also thought the batter was very thin,  i did double the recipe, so i'm not sure if that is what the problem was.  i will make again, but also cut back on the nutmeg.

These are really yummy and a fun little sweet treat!  I didn't dunk them completely in the melted butter, rather, I just brushed it on and then rolled them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  They turned out to be a great fix for my sweet tooth!

These are AMAZING!!! They taste just like a donut, but without the extreme guilt of eating a fried, sugar dough.  I used half whole wheat flour, but followed the directions otherwise.  I made them and they were gone within a half hour with me, hubby, BIL, and 2y/o DD. Oink, oink!  I want to try them again (maybe right now) with applesauce replacing the margarine completely and reducing the sugar slightly and adding a little vanilla.  For rounded muffin tops, bake 25-50 degrees hotter for the first 2 mins, then reduce to correct heat.  These will be made over and over in my house.

These are great! I cut back the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon because I'm not a huge fan and I read reviews that others thought it was rather strong. I ran out of butter for the coating so I went ahead and melted some more. I dipped mine while still hot from the oven so they absorbed a lot of butter. The cinnamon sugar coating stuck great and I don't think these taste quiet like doughnuts, but they are really good. These are going to make our breakfast rotation for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great but I got tired of dipping the tops in sugar and butter so I just drizzled the butter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking and they were even better!

Very easy to make! I did use butter, and agree that this much melted butter to dip was more than I needed.  It is also more sugar/dipping mixture, but I always freeze this type of thing if there are leftovers for other muffins and the like.  The recipe did make 12 mini muffins for me.

These are so easy to make and fun to eat. They remind me of the French Breakfast Muffins from this site which we love. I used canola oil instead of margarine and slightly less nutmeg. I also halved the topping and it was plenty. I got 14 mini muffins and will definitely double the recipe next time.

I made these for breakfast this morning because I didn't have all the ingredients for my favorite pancake recipe.  These are really good!  I doubled the recipe and got 24 mini muffins (filled to the top).  I followed the recipe and it was perfect.  Next time I'll add a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt.  Yum!

Oh geez I knew I didn't want to make these! They are really good. And I've been sitting here popping them in my mouth. They really do taste like a donut hole. I did skip the coating in butter part, instead I just popped the muffins in to a ziploc bag with the cinnamon sugar mix while they were still hot from the oven. It stuck perfectly to them. I was feeling a little lazy and didn't want to sit there dipping in the butter. Thanks for the recipe!

I had heard so much about these on the Recipe Exchange that I had to make them this morning.  What a pleasant little surprise.  I used butter instead of margarine and skim milk.  For the topping I used only 2 T of butter melted and it worked perfectly on 24 mini muffins.  I dipped the top in the melted butter and then into the bowl with the sugar/cinnamon (also cut in 1/2).  Perfect amounts.  You have to work fast as the little buggers are hot right out of the mini muffin tin but they are worth the danger!!  Oh, I also used only a dash of nutmeg and added a dash of salt also to the batter.

These mini muffins were delicious! I followed the recipe except for the nutmeg part, just because I didn't have any. I substituted it for 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I sprayed the bottoms of the pan with Pam and once they were done, I inverted them onto a cooling rack and they popped out. I was able to make exactly 24 mini muffins baking for 14 minutes. I dipped the tops only in butter but rolled the entire muffin in the sugar/cinnamon mix. These were so fast and easy to make...and I only had to wash one mixing bowl! Will definitely make again!

This made 6 regular size muffins. I used rice milk instead of regular, and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Even without the topping these are good (slightly bland but not without some flavor), but I only put the butter and sugar/cinnamon on the top and it was great. I will certainly make this again and try the basic recipe with fruit because its so simple.

Sorry to be one of the only voices of dissent, but I didn't have such great results with these.  Firstly, I was (rather crazily, I admit) expecting them to look a little more like donuts but obviously, baked in a muffin tin, they looked like muffins.  Also they were really soft and crumbly, and tasted really rich - I guess kind of like donuts, but not in a good way, or maybe just not the kind of donut that I like.

Wonderful Treat!!  I doubled the recipe and it made 48 mini muffins.  I added about 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and I did not double the nutmeg.  Will make again!

My kiddos devoured these in just minutes - didn't even leave any for Dad. :)  I adjusted the recipe just slightly by using less nutmeg.  I ended up with exactly 24 muffins - will DEFINITELY be making again...probably today. :)

I had my mother taste this, since I'm on a diet and I couldn't eat it today (when it was fresh out of the oven). I freaked out because the dough had the consistency of a snot and seriously wondered if it will rise, but voilà! Beautiful mini-muffins that tastes EXACTLY like cinnamon munchkins. Since I used low-calorie margarine and skim milk with no margarine for the topping (I just sprinkled sugar while it was still baking), most definitely lower-calorie too. Love this recipe!

These were delicious and quick.  I used Cardamon instead of nutmeg, only because I was out of nutmeg...so instead of a donut they reminded me of an Indian sweet.

These are fabulous!  The texture is just perfect, light & moist.  I actually liked that they weren't heavy & cakey.  They tasted like a donut without the heavyness.  I doubled the batch and after reading the reviews decided to use just 1/2 tsp nutmeg total, which I thought was perfect.  Nutmeg is a potent spice and I think using the recommended amount would have been way too overpowering.  With this change they are definitely 5 star.  I let them cool for almost 15 minutes then put them in a ziploc with the melted butter then another ziploc with the cinnamon sugar.  My whole family loved them and they disappeared fast. I will definitely make them again!

These are too good and easy to be true!  I'm known for creating kitchen disasters, but this one didn't fall victim to that!  The ingredients are simple/probably in your kitchen pantry already, the "one bowl" preparation is quite welcoming (unless you want to include the small bowl you'll use for melting the margarine used for dipping them in later), and they taste fantastic as a treat by itself or with a hot drink or milk.  I baked mine for 17 minutes and they were perfect.  I also reduced the sugar in the batter to about 1/3 cup total.  Remove them from the pan a couple of minutes later and begin the "dipping/rolling" process.  That is the only part that takes time, but the ease of the entire recipe makes this one final step very much worth it.  They're not exactly healthy treats, but they're also not as harmful to your health as a traditional donut hole that has been fried. :)  I plan to use whole wheat flour next time..  and maybe even add maple extract to the batter, or pure maple syrup to the margarine used for the dipping.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

These were delicious! I didn't use nutmeg because I was out.  I got 20 mini muffins.  I tried dipping some in chocolate for a chocolate donut taste but they definitely didn't taste like chocolate dipped donuts, more like cake dipped in chocolate (which was good too).  I think the butter dip really gives them the donut (fried) taste.  Thanks for this quick recipe!

I was really looking forward to these muffins when I made them this morning.  I was quite disappointed at how they turned out.  Mine are chewy and even though I cut the nutmeg by 2/3 it was still the first thing I tasted.  I would leave it out next time.  These did not taste like cinnamon sugar donut holes.  I wish I could say they were great but I cannot.  They were ok.  I might try one more time and cook them less.

Wow!  They do taste just like mini donuts.  I took others advice and cut back on the nutmeg just a bit.  I tripled the batch but only got 48 mini muffins, when after reading reviews I expected more.  I used my Tbsp to fill the cups, sprayed the pan with Pam and they popped right out.  Let them cool 10 mins and then put all 24 in a ziploc added butter and shook. (If I didn't let them cool long enough they broke apart a bit) Then 4-5 at a time into a paper lunch sack with the sugar mixture and shook.  Delicious. Just as good cold as they are warm.  Will definitely make again!  Super kid friendly recipe too!

I did cut back the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. I did not need nearly the topping either, as I only dipped the tops not the entire muffin. I got 24 mini muffins.

I made this for Recipe Group, my first one:)  I thought these were really nice, but not exactly what I was expecting.  I think in order to taste more like the doughnut holes they need to be "cakier" if that makes sense.  And I did make a second batch splitting the nutmeg in half and adding cinnamon for the other half, this was better for me and the hubs pallet.  So overall, I think this was a great idea and they taste nice, but the Nutmeg is a bit overpowering and the texture could be more dense.  Thanks Dianne for this quick yummy recipe!!! ATTN: UPDATE!! ok, if you don't like these right away you HAVE to try them again the next day.  the texture was better and the nutmeg wasn't as strong, i think because the flavors were able to "mingle".

Woe! to these Doffins!  Excellent texture, taste and ease!  I used buttermilk/powder&soda and baked for 15 mins in regular muffin tins.  Yields 12 small doffins.

I can see what all the hype is about! I followed the recipe exactly. One tip: you really should get 24 mini muffins out of this. I filled most about 3/4 and some were hard to get out because they were overfilled. If you use a standard mini muffin tin, shoot for 50% full.

I made this as the Recipe Exchange group recipe for the week of May 24th. Wow, I was surprised how much I like these! I didn't expect to because I'm not really a fan of nutmeg, but I really like it in these muffins! The texture of this eggless muffin also surprised me; I didn't realize they'd still be tender without an egg, but they are. Not much else to say, except that I look forward to making these again sometime with white whole wheat, because I'm sure this recipe will hold up wonderfully! Note: This recipe made 12 mini-muffins and 5 muffin-tops for me, made as written with no changes (well, butter instead of margarine). Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing. I doubled the recipe (but I should have trippled it!) for my regular sized muffin pan and I used fat free milk, half butter, half apple sauce as well as half splenda and half regular sugar for the muffin. I also cut back on the nutmeg a little because I'm not a huge fan of it. I think because I made regular sized muffins I prefer just the tops to have the cinnamon/sugar mix, rather than the whole thing... but either way they're fantastic! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are simple and delicious.  I realized as I was putting the batter in to the pan that it was meant for mini muffins but I only have a regular pan.  I divided it amongst about 9 cups and followed the exact recipe.  They came out great.  I might cut cown to 1/2 tsp of nutmeg next time and see how that comes out.

After reading some suggestions from other reviewers I replaced the milk in this recipe with buttermilk. The result: nutmeg muffins with a sour tinge to them. I've used buttermilk in other recipes and never had negative results, but I really think it ruined these. They're edible (what isn't, dipped in butter and rolled in cinna-sugar?) but I can't help wishing they were better. Thank goodness they were quick to make! I am giving this four stars, as benefit of the doubt, they're probably awesome and some bites are almost tasty. Made with buttermilk I'd give it two stars. I will probably try making these again someday (right now I have 24 sour ones to eat), but next time I will STICK TO THE RECIPE!

Wow! Needed something fast and easy for a Bible study group who will be in a few hours. This was SO fast and easy- and GOOD. I followed the recipe exactly and got 29 mini muffins. I just tasted the first one and loved it.  I will be making these again and again.

The first time I made these I did the recipe as calls.  It was way to much nutmeg.  (btw, nutmeg can make you sick) And I got a headache after eating them. And the nutmeg was overpowering  This time around I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract to the recipe.   Also, I cooked them only 15 mins.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS!  My husband loved them... and so did my kids. Will make again

This recipe, as written, won't even come together. It has nowhere near enough liquid.

I have absolutely no idea how it got this many 5 star reviews.

Doubled the milk, and ended up with something still fairly biscuit-like, and bland.

They good! I made them in a big muffin tin, but I find them still really tasty... I think the muffins could turn out better if I finally use a smaller muffin tin. 

I recommend this recipe for a party snack or a dessert for a family.

I’d make them again but with less nutmeg. Cooking time for me seems to be around 17 minutes. Nice base recipe if you want to change the flavor or coating. I did have to substitute milk for almond milk which turned out fine. Fun for kids to dip and roll in whatever you fancy.

I’ve made this recipe many times, and I always double it. I love how easy it is to make, I even stuffed them with jam. They are excellent when you eat them right away. My only minor issue is if you eat them 1-2 hours later, they become hard and not as good. I don’t know how to solve this without having to microwave them. It’s a recipe to serve fresh but not to bring over to guests.

Yum!! These tasty little morsels were a big hit at a fellowship coffee. I made 2 batches following the recipe as written. I did run out of butter & cinnamon sugar for dipping...no big deal, I just mixed up a little more.

way too much nutmeg! i suggest adding only 1/4 maybe a little extra but nutmeg is very strong and there is way too much.. also add some vanilla :). the muffins turned out alright otherwise.. a bit on the drier side though.

I have made these little gems over and over, esp when it's cold out. My family estd them up. Absolutely love the nutmeg. 
I saw the Pioneer Woman make these one day, exactly as written. She made 12 big donut muffins and stated that she got the recipe from her french teacher. Thank you OP, these are simple and go together quickly, after all these years we still love em!!

I did make 2 changes by necessity. I had to use a full-size muffin pan. It made 6 large muffins. I had self-rising flour so I used 1 cup with no additional baking powder because the flour already had it. They turned out perfect at 25 mins on the second to the top rack. The outer edges were crispy and the inside was soft. I will make this again.

I made these ahead for our Christmas morning Grinch brunch and called them “Little Cinnamony Lou Who muffins.”  Used butter instead of margarine and reduced  the nutmeg because it was fresh grated and would have overpowered the cinnamon.  They were a hit!

If this called for less nutmeg, these would be great.  I made 6 regular sized muffins instead of the mini-muffins.

Taste great but I only baked mine for 25 minutes, and that was for 12 mini muffins on the large size.

Very good!  I also reduced the amount of nutmeg to 1/2 t.  I did need the full 1/2 c. sugar and cinnamon mixture to cover all 24 mini muffins.  I also had to melt another 1/4 c. butter to finish all of the muffins.  I would make this one again.  It would be fun to change up the flavors, maybe to add pumpkin to the mix.  Or to make savory ones with vegetable bits and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

I really liked the base of this muffin! I switched things up a little bit and squirted some jam in the center of each muffin before baking.  Very good and will definitely make again.

Made these for my son instead of a trip to the donut shop.  They were OK.  The dipping in butter and then cinnamon/sugar was what made them good.

It was pretty good, but I like others found the nutmeg to be s bit overpowering.  I will try it again with less nutmeg, but overall they were not bad at all.

This is an awesome recipe, however, it was a really dominant taste of nutmeg when I followed the recipe exactly how it’s stated. It made me think of fall and I love fall! My kids on the other hand were expecting a more cinnamon roll type taste so it muffin. I wonder if you could substitute cinnamon for nutmeg? Has anyone tried it like that? Might try this next time. If you love nutmeg this recipe is perfect for you!

The sugar coating was way too much and the nutmeg was way too strong.  maybe if I hadn't dunked them in butter before the sugar coating it may have been better.  Just didnt care for them and cinnamon sugar doghnuts are my fav!

Meh....I'm one of the few I guess.  The nutmeg was overwhelming .  If I make these again, I'll definitely cut back. I also liked them better NOT dipped in the butter and then rolled in the sugar combo.  The butter was over kill, I'll just roll them in the sugar/cinnamon.

This is my REVISED review (disregard my negative review from July 2).  When I first tasted them, they were not quite cooled.  I made them in the morning, by evening, they were delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I will definitely make them again, and cut down on the sugar.  Even when I tasted the batter, it was too sweet for my taste.  But they are delicious!  I would recommend allowing them to settle for a while after taking out of the oven before consuming.

Simple, easy, and delicious! I adjusted the serving size to 6 and it was the perfect amount to fill 2 donut molds. I made it for my son and my husband. I love that I could whip up 2 baked (not fried) donuts for my family. My husband and son loved it!

These are yummy & super easy!  I used butter, as opposed to margarine.  I also decided to coat the whole mini muffin in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  My main (minor) change that I highly recommend:  When it came to the cinnamon-sugar that the donut muffin is dipped in, I used bakers, sugar, which is extremely fine, almost like a powder.  It made a HUGE difference!  Crave-able!  In fact, I think I’ll go make some right now!

Yum!  I had to double the cinnamon and had to remake some more with a good 9 left still to coat. So next time I’d double the whole cinnamon dipping mixture as a whole. Other than that it was super easy to throw together and was a delicious breakfast treat!

Lovely muffins. These make a wonderful breakfast(and even dessert!!!) and though I sometimes opt out the topping on my mom's request, they are still the most delicious muffins ever. Better than store's. I changed the serving size to 48 because it makes MINI muffins. This was nice, since I have a family of eight. Thank you, Diane!

It’s rare that both kids like something, but these were a hit! I left the nutmeg out because we don’t like it. Experimented with dipping just the top vs the whole muffin in butter and we voted on the whole muffin....just use a light hand so you don’t run out. Will definitely be a staple recipe in my kitchen.

These were very good and froze well.  I had some left over and put them in the freezer.  They were in the freezer for a few months and were still really good when I took them out.

I've made these a few times before and they are honestly the best way to make donut-like pastries without needing to fry anything.

Wow, now we know the secret ingredient to the mini donuts on the fair grounds -- nutmeg! Loved these, be careful not to add to the baking time as that will harden them. No deep frying!

Very good.  I brushed the butter on then dipped in cinnamon sugar mix.  Lightened the butter taste which my son preferred.

I love this recipe! I’ve made these several times and they never disappoint. I’ve done both with a mini muffin pan and also a donut pan. So good! The nutmeg is the key to the donut taste. Definitely don’t skip that ingredient. I add the batter to a pastry bag, which makes it much easier to pour into the pans, especially if you are using a donut pan.

Excellent with one small exception - DON'T cover the entire donut with sugar - reserve for the tops only. We tried both ways and covering the entire donut was definitely overkill, way too much sugar.

These were great! I was leery of the nutmeg, so I split the batter into three parts: plain, nutmeg, and blueberry. They were all wonderful! I was pleasantly surprised the nutmeg was not overpowering, only gave a nice warmth to the muffins. I got 22 muffins using a Wilton standard mini-muffin pan...My husband and I ate all but 10 of them! This is definitely a recipe I will keep and use again. Would be great for brunch or to give as a gift.

These were very easy and the whole family including the kids loved them. I used Almond milk instead of regular milk and they came out great.  We all did think there was a little too strong of a nutmeg flavor so I will cut the nutmeg in half next time.

This recipe is DE-LISH!  I substituted ingredients, to use up what I had in stock:  quinoa and whole wheat  flour instead of all purpose flour,  1/2 cup plain, full fat, greek yogurt instead of milk,  1/4 c. stevia and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. of sugar and about 1 tsp of water and one egg. The cin-sugar topping isn't necessary, they're great as is.   I also used a regular muffin tin, and baked in a toaster oven.  Taste is unreal!

I made these and followed recipe exactly. They were amazing. All I had was a standard size muffin pan. Will purchase a mini muffin pan so next time I can get 24 small muffins like some of the other users.

Great recipe!  I decided to treat them like cinnamon sugar donut holes so I used 3/4 stick of melted butter and rolled the entire muffin in it. Then I placed twice as much of the cinnamon sugar mixture in a paper bag. After rolling the muffins in the butter, I placed them in the bag and shook cinnamon sugar in them. In addition, I made a powdered sugar glaze for dipping. Just a few more calories, but it was quite the decadent treat.

I made this recipe as is with the only substitution of butter for the margarine. The yield was 24 mini muffins. Now, as Naples34102 mentions, it is correct "mini muffin tins" vary in size. I have two of these tins and I can see the difference in size by brand. Still, the recipe yielded a solid 24 mini goodies despite the size difference. Fill the tins halfway up. A tiny bit more will make them into little mushroom looking pieces of heaven. Cute too by the way! I do however think that the discrepancy in size did not help when I had to dip them in the spiced sugar. I had to add a bit more because it was not enough for my batch. Maybe it has to do with the amount of butter that each little muffin absorbs. The more butter the more sugared spice will stick to the muffin. Watch for that! Other than that, I am very happy with the recipe. Will make it again. It is very good to bring to a small gathering. I will also try other toppings. It suits itself to so many kinds of simple toppings.

These are pretty easy to make and tasty.  I'm not a huge cinnamon sugar fan, so that's probably why I didn't love them.  I think they may taste good if you let them cool, then roll in some powdered sugar instead of cinn/sugar.  I may try that next time!

I made these this morning. A very simple and easy recipe. My husband and son like them. I am not a donut eating person that's why  I gave it a 4 star. I will make them again. I will try sticking some strawberry jelly in the middle.

The bread itself was fantastic just a little too much cinnamon and sugar at the end for my liking. I think I’ll make the cinnamon sugar mix and sprinkle it on instead of roll it

These little mock donut holes are quite yummy and addicting. Such a simple recipe. I'm thinking of trying to make a chocolate donut hole with a glaze next, using this recipe as a base.

I baked mine for eleven minutes and they turned out great so don’t leave them in too long, they bake fast! The reason I gave these only four stars is the nutmeg is strong. I’m not a huge fan of nutmeg, and you can definitely taste it. The texture is perfect and this recipe is really easy to make.

When I made these, my dog was sick and I had just had minor surgery. I decided that the recipe might need a flavor boost and added some salt and a splash of vanilla. The vanilla was great but on the other hand, I added a few to many grains of salt. I will make these again because the whole family thought they were fabulous. They are delish even the next day

I’ve made these twice in one week, they kept disappearing. 
Easy and simple ingredients you have in the pantry. I added vanilla and double the recipe, more to go around. These are a new family favorite.

Loved them. Delicious. Made 8 full size muffins instead and added few drops of vanilla to batter. Big hit with the family! Will need to double recipe next time as they were ready for more.

Followed the recipe to a T except followed reviewers about dipping the top half in butter & sugar mix vs. the whole muffin.  Thought  they were pretty good but not as great as most reviews.  A little dry.

These were delicious. My husband popped them in his mouth whole. I tried them with powdered sugar also. (Must be stone cold or the sugar will run. I used 1/2 cup in a ziplock bag and shook until coated.) He preferred the cinnamon sugar coating, although he liked them both. I will use a bit more melted margarine next batch because I ran out before I was able to coat all 24 minis. I found that no other changes were necessary.

It was very good, but nutmeg definitely over powered the donut. This tastes more like a egg nog donut, if you are looking for a regular cake donut.

This one is a keeper,  I made two minor changes 1. just a little less nutmeg because my granddaughters aren"t crazy about spices and 2. I dipped the tops instead of rolling them to cut down a bit on the sugar. They were a huge hit with my 10 and 4 yr old. After trying one the 10 yr old ran up to me and was jumping up and down and told me" grandma these are amazing'", the 4 yr. old hugged me around my legs and said " I love these grandma". You just can't get any better praise than that. They cleaned up 24 in about 2-1/2 days and wanted more.

I'm always looking for a quick and simple snack and this one was both, even though I'm not a nutmeg fan. I did not add the amount of nutmeg the recipe had asked for. I used less and the spice was still a bit much for me. The cinnamon and sugar coating was good but I might've added too much. Over all I enjoyed making them and eating a few. Thank you for sharing.

These came out really good!  They really do taste like donuts.  

A few comments / changes for next time...

1) I only had a regular muffin tin.  There is enough batter to fill each of the 12 cups a little less than half way.  It actually produces a good "crust" to soft inside ratio.

2) Next time, I'll double recipe because the 12 muffins went really fast.

3) The sugar / nutmeg ratio is good.  If you don't like nutmeg, you could probably reduce it a bit.

4) I had a fair amount of leftover cinnamon/sugar after rolling the butter coated muffins.   I'll reduce the amount by about a third next time.

I wanted to make something different for breakfast so I decided to try these. I didn’t have nutmeg but did read someone use pumpkin spice and I decided to substitute for that. These muffins came out great! Very addicting, will definitely make again!

These are very good but sweet, which I guess they're supposed to be! I didn't want a strong nutmeg flavor, so I only used 1/4 tsp and it was fine. They were getting too brown too soon, so another time I may try lowering the oven temp to 350. Someone mentioned not dipping in butter, just putting them in a paper bag with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. That would probably work, too.  I also like the idea that someone suggested about using pumpkin pie spice. That would be a good sub for the fall, either in the mixture or adding to the sugar dusting at the end. I'm placing a few of these in cellophane bags tied with ribbons to bring to a Kielbasa Fest at my church. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good - I didn’t think they’d taste like donuts but the taste and texture is pretty close to cake donuts! I’m not sure they’re healthier with that ratio of butter - but no frying in oil is a plus.

Wow these are unpleasant. I was looking for a morning no-egg recipe as I have ran out. I tend to prefer recipies that treat sugar as a functional ingredient rather than a main one. I have trained myself to weed out recipies where the sugar to flour ratio is greater than 1:4. I was in a hurry today and didn’t check. This recipient features sugar very prominently and if you do not like overly sweet baked goods ( like  me) you will hate this one.

I couldn’t even bring myself to add the topping as I could not imagine adding any more sugar to these. There is so much there already the crust is... well, very crusty.

These will get dumped unfortunately- I will keep looking  and stick to my go to muffin recipe for now.

I made these 2 ways, according to the recipe and with added cinnamon. I would say without cinnamon they definitely need a frosting glaze. Still very good.

Very tasty. I used butter instead of margarine. The kids tried to eat them all in one sitting! My only issue was that it was just a little dry in my opinion, but still really good. Will definitely make this again!

I cooked for 16 mins seemed enough. Made no other changes. I think 20 mins would make them to dry.  I have ordered a pan  that makes donut holes rather than a muffin style pan. I love the recipe and look forward to making again as donut holes. I feel will be more interesting when putting on the sugar/cinnamon final mixture.

These should be renamed delicious sugar bombs.  Have eaten 4 without trying.  A great snack for not a lot of effort.  DOES NOT taste like a donut to me, more a cinnamon-sugar muffin.  Having said that, they’re great.  For those who said they’re too sweet, just cut back on the sugar.  Not sweet enough?  Add more sugar on top.  Ditto on other ingredients.  I’m happy the way they are, reminds me of cinnamon toast.   And for those whose kids said they’re too sweet, that’s just weird ;).

Made 10 large muffins. Used Penzey’s pie spice instead of nutmeg.  Sprinkled with Penzey’s cinnamon sugar without brushing with butter. Baked 20 minutes in pans coated with baking spray (flour and oil). Made outside a little crispy which my husband loved. Figured calories as 130 without topping. 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon sugar would add 10 calories.

Like another reviewer I made these as regular sized muffins and just brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar very generously.  These are amazing. Definitely satisfied my donut cravings.  I used fresh nutmeg and just eyeballed a good amount.  Still could taste the nutmeg without it being overpowering.  I would not leave out the nutmeg.  It definitely is a secret ingredient that sets these apart from just a cinnamon sugar type dessert.  This is a great recipe too for people following a vegan diet.  I didn't miss the egg at all.

This recipe was absolutely awesome! I only made one change instead of adding nutmeg I added pumpkin pie spice. It was fabulous! It tasted just like one of those donuts you get from a pumpkin farm in the fall! It was so yummy and tasty and very moist!

I made a double batch exactly as written. My family gobbled them down with not a single one for later. The only thing I might change is the amount of nutmeg. It was more than I cared for but no one else thought anything of it. I would like to buy a doughnut baking pan and try using this as an actual doughnut. Kudos!

These are awesome!  I've made them at least half a dozen times, and my husband and I can't stop eating them!  Perfect size, sometimes I add more cinnamon.  Kids love these too!  And so easy to make with ingredients always around!

My daughter requested mini donut muffins for her birthday treat at school. This was a dry run to make sure we liked the recipe, and thank goodness I didn't just make them and send them, because they were awful. all you can taste, even with all the cinnamon and sugar, is the nutmeg. It was so strong it made us physically sick. I retraced my steps thinking I must have made a mistake and put in too much nutmeg and I didn't. I guess nutmeg is probably just not for me, and if you like these that's wonderful! I just wanted to serve a warning to anyone who doesn't care for strong spice taste - especially nutmeg.

After reading the reviews and everyone stating they disappeared so quickly, I decided to double the recipe and bake in 12 regular size muffin cups at 375 for 18-20 minutes. It is an amazing recipe without any alterations. Took only a couple minutes to prep and I always have these ingredients on hand! I will keep this recipe readily available for any overnight guests or for a quick breakfast surprise for the family!

These are heavenly, if you make them with butter and not margarine. The ones with butter were lighter and more like a donut hole. The ones made with margarine were still tasty but heavier .

OMG YUM!!! These were delectable and eaten up in minutes! The only changes I made were changing the nutmeg to 1/4 t, and cooking them for 12 min, rather than 15. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Made these exactly as written and added a shake of cinnamon to my batter. These had great flavor and just the perfect snack size. Quick and easy to satisfy everyone. Next time I may try a little vanilla drizzle on top, but keep the rest of the recipe the same.

I didn't have milk, so, I used almond milk. (I'm lactose intolerant, but I live with 3 other people) it came out amazing. I did some with powdered sugar, and some with cinnamon sugar. DEFINITELY MAKING AGAIN! Btw, GREAT with coffee.

I would like to start by saying that these are very good!  BUT, I am not a huge fan of nutmeg and there is a lot of nutmeg in this recipe!  Next time I make them I will either cut back on it or (most likely) not use it at all.

Easy, fun, and the smaller you make them, the more they resemble cake donut holes. Definitely popular with younger eaters.

These are DANGEROUSLY good! Warning: This recipe will make it very easy to over indulge. I used butter instead of margarine. Threw in a tiny bit of cinnamon into the batter (although, not needed.) FYI- They will soak up the melted butter at the end, if you leave them in longer before dipping in the cinnamon-sugar topping. However, the soaked butter ones probably tasted the best so make sure you have a little extra butter in the fridge, just in case. This recipe made 20 mini muffins...

A keeper recipe ! Easy and irresistible by all . Adjust the amount of sugar coating to your liking. I dunked the entire mini muffin in the butter, drain slightly and then rolled into the sugar,this provided a nice 'crusty' sugary coating once cooled off.  For some I dipped just the top  and only sugared the top portion.  Both equally nice!!

My first response: meh.  I agree with another reviewer that the nutmeg was heavy handed.  And I reduced the cinnamon sugar to half.  I think they would rate higher if I could've made them really mini.  As for trying it again, I think yes, the recipe lends itself to all sorts of additions.

We make these quite a bit as is and the family loves them!  Sometimes we will have some with a powdered sugar icing in stead of sugar cinnamon for variation since we make them a lot.

So good! I made these with butter and buttermilk and substituted the baking powder for 1/2 tsp baking soda as suggested by another reader. I baked these in my nuwave air dryer for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and they turned out outstanding!

Go easy on the butter bath but heavy on the cinnamon and sugar dip!  Yum!  Make a little extra cin/sugar dip!  If you're a sweets fan!
Very tasty and easy.

My boyfriend and I wanted something sweet, I wanted easy, fast and not terribly messy. Literally just finished eating the delicious morsels. Only took 25 min tops, I used a regular cupcake pan and bake time was 12 min. Didn't used a lot of butter for dunking the muffin for the cinnamon sugar topping, I didn't even use all that.  I hope everyone gets a change to make and try these!

Perfect simple recipe.  I've made these twice now, first time as is (wonderful) second time I made two separate batters, one with a dash of cayenne, the other with 1 tsp unrefined honey.  Both turned out very well.  These are a new morning favorite for my house, thank you!

Literally just made 2x amount of this. I got 36 mini doughnut muffins but it's fine since it does depends on how much or how little of the batter you put in. I only butter and sugar the top and they are delicious! My kids are eating those like crazy. This is really easy to whip up and doesn't take much time.

This is the best donut/mini muffin recipe ever. It's like a cinnamon roll, or pretzel. It's so delicious. My butter didn't melt for the dip, so I just mixed it and buttered the tops of the muffins. Soooooo good. Serve with vanilla ice cream for the best desert you've ever had! ??

Very simple and delicious! One thing I did was cut down on the nutmeg by adding a little bit of cinnamon, but I felt there was still way too much nutmeg in the final product. Still very yummy though!

I made these, and the only change I did was I used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  I used the full 20 minutes of baking time because I was concerned about them being undercooked.  I found it was tricky doing the butter dip then cinnamon/sugar dip using forks/spoon/tongs, next time I might get some plastic gloves for that step.  They tasted amazing, and my husband is talking about making future adjustments (like adding a dipping chocolate after the cinnamon/sugar, or adding mini chocolate chips to the batter)

The texture was a little off, or at least not what I expected. May try to substitute for cake flour to get a lighter donut.  I didn't use as much nutmeg as the recipe called for but all else was the same.

I was disappointed in these. There is a possibility my nutmeg was old or i just don't care for the nutmeg. I had some cream cheese frosting that helped.

I tested these and after rave reviews made about 10 dozen for a graduation party, in place of buying donut holes. They were very popular and the first thing gone!  I followed the recipe exactly - can't go wrong with these. And they are (somewhat) healthier than deep-frying donut holes.

Nutmeg is a bit strong for my preference. But the donuts are easy to make, mix really well, and bake fluffy and nice exactly as written. Maybe need 5tbsp butter to roll in at the end instead of 4. Overall I was happy with them but will reduce to 1/2 tsp nutmeg next time I think.

I made these as directed and they were wonderful! I took them to a ribbon cutting ceremony and they were gone within 10 minutes. They are very moist and the amount of nutmeg and sweetness in the flavor is on point!

My husband is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet and does not like anything overly sweet.  I prepared the muffins per the recipe but omitted the last part after cooking.  He loves them :)

These muffins are delicious! I made them for a brunch and everyone raved about how good they were. I did substitute butter for the margarine, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make them again! Tip: Serve warm if possible!

I really like this recipe because it's so simple and quick to do.  the changes that I made are that I added a little bit of almond extract, and I only used 1/2 tsp instead of 3/4 tsp of nutmeg.  For next time, I plan to use icing sugar instead of granulated sugar for the outside because I didn't like how gritty the texture was.

I really liked this! I'm only fourteen and I'm just learning how to cook, and these were easy and fun to make. My dad and I love them!
Just a heads up though, if you're like me and you only dip the tops of the muffins in margarine/butter, I wouldn't use as much sugar and cinnamon. I'd reduce it to maybe 1/4 cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. 
Thank you for sharing this great recipe! This is now a family favorite!

These little donuts are delicious and were a big hit! They are so easy to make and will disappear before your eyes! My grandkids loved them and asked me to make them again. Even my husband liked them. I didn't change anything in the recipe and will definitely make them again! Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to love these, I even bought a Calphalon mini muffin pan so I could make them...I followed the instructions and thought they came out a bit dry, even making sure to not overmix the batter.  I think they would taste good with a hot cup of coffee or tea, versus eating alone.  Bummed...

I made these pretty much as written. I used gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular all purpose and added a bit of vanilla bean paste, just because. These were gobbled up by my kids  and after tasting them I can see why, they were addictive, tasty bites! I also ended up with 22 mini muffins but I think my mini muffin pan is a little bit bigger.

So tasty! I used almond milk as that is all I had, but followed the recipe otherwise. They were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. I had a little leftover raspberry sauce (also from this site) in a squeeze bottle and filled a few of the duffins (easier to say/write)--yum. I may try dipping them in chocolate, Nutella, or a simple glaze (instead of sugar mix) for variation next time. And there will be a next time.

When you wake up and you want donuts, but you're too lazy to get in the car? Problem solved! Everything was in my pantry for 24 mini muffins. Oh so good! They have that sweet sugary taste. I am sure you could even get creative to make these different flavors. Will make again.

I loved the donut muffins, however, I did double the recipe, because I thought that there wasn't enough for my family, and made it into a bread. These were delicious and my family enjoyed it.

These are super cute to look at once they are done. I loved everything about them except there was too much nutmeg flavor for me. My husband gave them four stars, and I gave them three or three and a half.

This was a great little homeade breakfast snack that was just as easy to make as pancakes.  I like that the recipe is simple and is only for about 12-16 mini muffins. I used butter as per the cooks note & did not change any of the recipe except for on the mixing technique. In order not to over stir the batter:  I sifted all the dry ingredients together in one bowl (dry team), and in a seperate bowl I throughly mixed only the wet ingredients together (wet team). Then when I was ready, I combined and folded them together with as little stirring as possible, and put them right into the oven.  A toothpick was clean in about 10-15 minutes. Used 2 pie pans for the melted butter & sugar cinnamon mix afterwards. Perfect, easy, and husband loved it. Can serve hot but I thought room temperature was better. I think it could probably could even be made a day in advance. Could make a yummy dessert and even go with ice cream!!  Very nice recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Perhaps using butter changes the baking time?  Or perhaps it was the dark muffin tins I used.  I doubled the recipe and found that the first batch...baked for 15 minutes...was much too long.  They were hard on the bottom.  I baked the 2nd batch for only 13 minutes and they were amazing.  I also found that the amount of butter suggested was nowhere near enough for dipping prior to sugaring these.  I had already doubled the recipe.  I melted another half a stick, 2 tablespoons at a time, because I kept running out.  I don't know if the problem was that I used butter rather than margarine, which I understand was the original ingredient suggested in the recipe, or that my butter wasn't sufficiently liquid.  I made a mess in my microwave trying to heat the butter to the right consistency, as it kept exploding.  I also appreciate it when ingredients say, "divided" when they are used in 2 or more parts of a recipe.  I didn't dump without reading this time, but I have in the past.  The 2nd batch I made was great and I may try these again. Hopefully I'll remember to subtract a few minutes of baking time the next time!

These were delicious!!! Made exactly as recipe called for and they turned out so great I made a second batch with one slight modification. My kids love chocolate chip muffins so I subbed the nutmeg for chocolate chips and they were a huge hit! Sprinkled with a little sugar on top and they were super yummy like the original recipe! Both will be a staple in our kitchen now ??

Followed recipe, substituted butter for margarine.  Brushed the tops only with melted butter while still in the pan then rolled them lightly in the sugar mixture.  OMG perfect with our coffee.  Thanks for sharing.

Reviewed 4/9/17.
Amazing sweet mouthfuls of deliciousness!!
The DH and I could not stop devouring these this morning. I followed the recipe exactly except substituted butter for the margarine. Half of the muffins were dipped in the butter before rolling in cinnamon sugar and while these were sinfully awesome, the amount of cinnamon sugar clinging to the muffins was a bit much for our tastes. The second half of the muffins were not dipped in butter, but were rolled in the cinnamon sugar mixture while still warm and turned out absolutely perfect!  The lovely flavor of the muffins wasn't overpowered by the quantity of the sugar this way.  We LOVE the contrast of the earthy nutmeg flavor in the muffin with the spicy cinnamon in the sugar, it is so yummy and warm in a back home in Mom's kitchen sort of way.  The muffins were light and had excellent crumb.  These won't turn out dry if you determine your baking time by the look of the muffin, not by a time given in this recipe or another post - as mentioned before, there are a myriad of sizes of muffin pans. My mini muffin pan creates muffins a little larger in diameter than a quarter and I started watching mine at about 7-8 minutes.  I think you could use this recipe as a base and it would also be excellent with variations like eliminating the nutmeg and adding vanilla, almond, lemon or other extracts and changing up the coatings like subbing the cinnamon for cocoa,  pumpkin pie or apple pie spice, lemon-flavored sugar, adding lave

Followed the recipe exactly as stated. They were ok. I think it calls for way way way too much nutmeg and it only produced 18 mini muffins for me. Also, the sugar cinnamon---you don't need as much. Kiddos had fun with it! Will def make again but greatly reduce nutmeg for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made 5 batches in 2 days. The latest was from my friend who is Gluten Free. I used Bob's Red Mill G.F. Baking  Flour and did not make any changes. They came out perfect and taste  wonderful.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Oh my.... I've been wanting something just like this for the past week.  Mine is a one person household and most recipes make too many.  Well, 24 is too many, but unlike many of the other recipes, this can be easily halved without affecting the outcome.  May be a little too much nutmeg for this old cowgirl, but that's personal preference.  I did like the idea of one reviewer using pumpkin pie spice as a substitute.  Anything dipped in butter then rolled in sugar and cinnamon can't be bad.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made them twice already.  My family ate them as fast as I made them.  The first batch I made I used nutmeg but, when I made the second batch, I took another rater's suggestion and substituted allspice.  We all voted that we liked the allspice batch better.

Excellent recipe! Tastes just like a cinnamon doughnut. I used a 12-cup cupcake pan, and it barely made 10 small muffins. Follow the instructions and use a mini muffin tin.

They are very easy and quick to make and I love the cinammon and nutmeg taste. However I did not like the texture that much; it lacks moisture and softness. Any suggestions on how to make it more moist?

These were so good! I used butter instead of margarine, and it turned out great. I did not have access to nutmeg while I was making these and used cinnamon in the batter instead and it still was awesome! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

This is an excellent muffin recipe with a tender crumb.  I didn't have milk, so I used almond coconut milk out of necessity.  I wanted to make them less messy for the grandkids, so I just sprinkled a teaspoon of cinnamon sugar on top of each of the six extra large muffins before baking.  I was afraid that they might not be sweet enough, but they were.   Grandsons devoured them, even though they thought the nutmeg was a bit strong.  But that fades nicely as they set awhile, and to my liking, I would not reduce it.  Thank you!

My husband is a great man and I love him dearly but he hates cinnamon!!! (I know...this is one of the questions you should ask your boyfriend before you say "yes I do": honey, do you like cinnamon?) Anyway, I would LOVE to make these babies but I am wondering if I could replace the cinnamon with anything else (coco powder perhaps?) Any suggestions?

Very easy- good - but like many reviewers said way too much nutmeg... i ended up doing 2/4 instead of 3/4 and still was very strong. Overall yummy.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make a double batch when trying out this recipe for the first time. I'm glad I did because my kids devoured these!  Such a quick, easy recipe.  I always use a cookie scoop so the muffins are all the same size and bake evenly.  I'll definitely be making these again...

We loved these. I doubled the recipe and made them in a beignet pan. Nicely browned on the bottom, but light on top. Have to adjust temp. I added cinnamon sugar on some, and others I filled with raspberry jelly/preserves. Made them with margarine and they were great. Hubby said they were better than store bought donuts. Will be making these again for sure.

These are SO good! Everyone loved them. I split the batter and added purple, green, & gold food coloring (for Mardi Gras) to it and baked them in a cake pop pan instead of the mini muffin pan just so they were actually round like donut holes! Came out amazing! Definitely a recipe to keep on hand

Tasted just like a donut! My family loves them, and I couldn't keep my hands off them! I did use unsweetened coconut milk instead so it was a LITTLE bit healthier, but still delicious!

I added diced apples sprinkled with cinnamon and rather than roll in butter then sugar I simply took 1 tbsp brown sugar and mix in some cinnamon and sprinkled lightly on top before cooking, lowered temp to 350 and baked longer- just till they looked golden.    Delish

These are tiny little bundles of sugar.  Flavor was good, but these were way to sweet for me.  I was out of nutmeg so I mixed 1/2 tsp cinnamon, pinch of ginger and pinch of all spice to try to replicate the flavor.  These were easy to make but I felt the butter/cinnamon sugar topping was too much.

Made this recipe but followed suggestions to decrease nutmeg. I used a ratio of 2:1 for cinnamon: nutmeg. I also cut the sugar in half and did not make the topping as  I wanted to use this as an afternoon snack. Also I added a 4oz cup of applesauce. (I made it without the applesauce initially and thought it was too dry. Next time I would like to change up the flour trying a mix of whole wheat, oat and almond flour.

These were so yummy that my kids fought over the last one.   I only sugared the tops of the muffins.  That was plenty.  Super easy recipe!!  With my convection oven they were done in 8 mins!   From start to finish in less than 20 mins!

Because of previous comments about the nutmeg, I opted to use ginger (2/8 tsp) and cinnamon (1/2 tsp) in the batter. I also did not coat entire donut muffin in cinnamon sugar, just the tops. They turned out wonderfully, my husband loved them and I will be making them again very soon!

So good! I made them at a sleep over, and I highly recommend. Very easy and simple to follow. Next time I make them, I'm going to add less nutmeg, because it really overpowered the dish. Other than that, amazing!

Excellent recipe!  I made this during Christmas and my family loved it!  It made about 22.  I followed Giada's recipe and rolled them in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar and cocoa.  Definitely a keeper!

I used a regular size muffin tin. We won't talk about the state of my mini muffin tin. I used the lesser amount of nutmeg. It was plenty.  Very good though. Now I need to go work them off!

These are very tasty! I had trouble the first time baked because I over baked them. One thing to know in advance is that they don't brown like other baked goods. Nutmeg was too much for my taste. I don't like nutmeg so tried without it and added cinnamon the second time. Was good but might try a pinch of the nutmeg with the cinnamon next time. It seemed like a lot to dip in butter after baking so just popped out of pan and rolled in sugar and some in powdered sugar. My boys really enjoyed both ways. These are good and tasty, just need to work on baking time.

This recipe was easy and you if you bake regularly, probably have all the ingredients.  I will agree the amount of nutmeg is a big overwhelming.  I decided to opt out of dipping in butter to not make this as decadent - and will try vanilla per some of the other suggestions, next time.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

I made this recipe as written and it was a quick and easy treat.  I liked that they tasted a lot like donut holes with a crispy outside and soft inside,  but they were a little bit too sweet for me and I could taste more of the nutmeg than I liked.  My husband, however, really liked them, ate what I didn't and asked me to make them again soon.  Next time I will use less nutmeg.

I liked them OK, I just thought they would be more donut-y. They definitely were not like regular muffins, though. It's a solid recipe, but I won't be making it again. I made larger muffins from a cupcake pan and got 9. Baking time was around 19 minutes.

Followed the instructions exactly and was very pleased with this recipe. I've actually made it about 4 times..just forgot to rate.  I'm making them now to take to a social gathering.  They are so tasty! They were moist and no complaints.

They're awesome! After reading the other reviews, I cut back on the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. Made these a few times and will make again and again! Thank you Dianne for posting this yummy muffin!

A bit too much sugar in my opinion, but that can easily be controlled by lightly sprinkling it on the muffins instead of coating them fully  :) overall, great recipe!! I've made it 3 times!

I made this w Bobs Red Mill gluten free all-purpose flour and  xantham gum.  I also used fresh grated nutmeg.  The flavor was amazing.   Can't even tell they are gluten free.

Not a fan of these.  I found them to be too heavy and the nutmeg had too much of an aftertaste.  Too bad they were so easy to make!

These do taste like cinnamon donuts but I thought they were overly sweet. For some of the muffins I dipped  fully in the melted margarine & for some I dipped only the tops. For some reason, the sugar will stick to the bottoms of the muffins without using margarine but it won't stick to the tops unless they are dipped in the margarine.  In the end I was happier with the one where I only dipped the tops in margarine.

Delicious!  Everyone in the family lives them and it's hard to eat just one!  The only issue I had is that the cook time didn't work for me.  375 degrees and 15 min resulted in light brown tops and burned bottoms.  I reduced the temperature to 325 and cooked for 12 min and they came out perfect.  Also cut the cinnamon sugar topping mixture in half and still had plenty.

The only change I made was to divide the recipe in half since I only had a 12 mini muffin pan. These were so easy to make! Also, they are so good! I'll definitely make these again, but I need to buy a bigger pan!

Without telling my family what these were called they all announced these mini muffins tasted just like donuts.  As soon as the first batch (and I doubled the recipe) was gone I had to make another!  Thanks for an incredibly easy and tasty recipe.

They were good except the nutmeg gave off a funny taste.  Next time I will try either just vanilla or mix in some more lemon juide to give it a better taste.  Tip:  If you use  the 24 min cupcake papers, definitely spray the inside of the papers!.  I didn't and they stuck to the bottom.  But it was easy and the grandkids loved to make them and sprinkle the sugar on them.

Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I immediately doubled the recipe, which gave me exactly 36 mini muffins.  I did fill the cups about half-way, and they more than doubled in size.  The batter took less than 5 minutes to throw together, which was fabulous.  I set a timer to check on them in 15 mins but they were quite over-done by that time.  I'd suggest setting a timer for 10 mins and  watching them closely thereafter.  Despite being crispy on the bottom, these were very tasty, especially after the addition of the cinnamon sugar.  Great recipe!

These donut-muffins are SO good and so easy and fast to make.  The first time I made them I just dipped the tops into the butter as it was easier and less messy.  Today I took another reviewers suggestion and shook them in a bag (right out of the oven).  I did this as I am trying to cut back (where I can) on things like butter.  It worked quite well.

I followed the recipe  pretty precisely, only reduced the amount of nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  I made these in hopes that we could have them for breakfast for a couple of days.  Honestly, I don't know if they're going to last the night.  So good!!!

Awesome!  Made these tonight and my kids ate them up.  I had to make a second batch.  I made a few substitutions to make them "healthier".  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, butter, whole wheat flour, and brown cane sugar.  Instead of coating in butter, cinnamon and sugar, I just sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on the tops before baking.  A new favorite!

Really does  taste like a donut hole! I don't have a mini muffin tin so I made regular sized ones. Recipe makes about 8 of those. Made these with almond milk and light margarine and they still turned out great (and even lower calorie!). Will make again.

I made this as per recipe only substituted pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg and cinnamon  and only added a 1/2 tsp to batter. They are sooooo delicious!  The whole family loved them. I made them in my "babycakes" cupcake maker. It made 9 medium sized muffins in the maker as they normally are this size coming from there, just grease,  pour batter straight in babycake maker and 7 minutes later they were perfect!

The muffins turned out very moist, and tasted fine. I didn't really think they tasted like donut holes at all.

I think they tasted good, but I over cooked them a bit so they were a bit dry. Fill them up more than half way. The cinnamon sugar was ok, but it was way to sweet so I only did the top and it was fine. Also add less nutmeg bc that was all I could taste, nothing else. Overall though it was pretty good.

I made the muffin exactly as written, used unsalted butter but probably would use salted if I were to make agaim because they were a good texture but kind of tasteless by themselves.  Maybe needed to add some vanilla extract or something? Instead of rolling in the butter/cinnamon sugar I made a vanilla glaze.  By themselves,  the flavor wasn't that great but maybe I will make next time and roll in the cinnamon sugar and it might be better. I  baked 375 for 11 minutes. 15 or more would have left them burned in my oven

I loved how this barely took any time because I was in a rush to go somewhere and didn't have any eggs so I googled eggless muffin recipes and this popped up. The nutmeg was perfect though a little less for the people that like it bland a little cinnamon in the batter is good. I made 24 mini muffins. I am also not a very experienced cook or baker but they turned out really well. I suggest adding a little more milk if you like them less dry. And more flour to make them dryer.

This is a great and easy recipe to make a little ahead for brunch guests.  I've made it twice and everyone loved it.  Only alternation I made was to increase cinnamon to 1 tbsp.  But, then I love cinnamon.

I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Turned out really good.  I got 24 smaller mini donuts/muffins.  We're a family of five so I'll double the recipe next time.   I liked them a lot - just not quite enough for 5 stars.

my family really liked it - but i was expecting a bit diffferent texture of the donut muffins so i personally was a bit dissapointed...and even though i used small mini muffins tins it was barely enough for about 20 not 24... i used butter-  ... my family wants me to make it again so i will make it again but i was just expecting a different result from this recipe .... I made before a different donut muffin recipe  and the dough texture was amazing -for me personally -this was not my favourite unfortunately

Definitely a keeper recipe. Easy to make...just be sure to remember to mix like advised. Over mixing muffins tend to create unappetizing results.

made these with my four yr. old granddaughter.  they were great and we had so much fun!  she got to dunk the donuts in the cinnamon sugar and I`ve never seen a happier little girl! 

the taste of these little gems was nothing short of sheer delight.  they just melted in my mouth.   this recipe is a keeper  and one I want to share with my next granddaughter when she is four!

I did not like the taste of the nutmeg in the muffin. Also I ran out of the melted butter when rolling them to coat and then in the cinnamon sugar, so I just rolled them in the cinnamon sugar while still warm and it was just fine. So the next time I make them I won't roll them in melted butter. It will keep the calorie  count down. I didn't have a mini muffin pan, but I did have a pan that makes cake pops. The pan made the muffins round and they were very CUTE. The amount of the batter was perfect for amount of this cake pan size of 18.  I definitely will make them again.

I loved the Donut Muffins because I finally have a recipe with
nutmeg that stands out.  I have very few like that.  They were
delicious.  I'm sure I'll make them again.

These don't taste just like donut holes, but they are tasty. If you want a less sweet and healthier option don't roll them in butter after baking but go straight to the cinnamon sugar, you MUST do it while they are hot or the cinnamon sugar won't stick. 
I added some vanilla extract to mine. I also think that one could use powder sugar instead of cinnamon sugar at the end, that dip the tops into melted chocolate.

I love this easy awesome dessert snack. I made the first batch as is..so yummy. The second time around I added some lemon juice ( 1tsp ) to the batter and it added a different dimension to the sweet. I love this recipe!

I made this exactly as written and LOVED it!  My husband calls them "mini cinnamon flavored gluten bombs."  My kids couldn't stop eating them.  Will serve them for brunch for Mother's Day next weekend too.

This is a five star recipe for what it is - an easy, no-fry (therefore somewhat healthier) version of a donut hole. These are a weekly tradition at our Sunday brunch table. I do only one thing differently, and that is to cut back on the nutmeg. I use freshly ground nutmeg, and a little goes a very long way. I use perhaps 1/4 of a teaspoon and it seems absolutely perfect for us. You can't really go wrong with this one. Just tweak the spices (add some you love, leave out those you don't, adjust the amounts and types called for, whatever), or the topping. We love cinnamon sugar on ours, but my sister loves to make a thin icing to create a glaze. Yummy either way!!

VERY GOOD!!! Delectable! Soft and fluffy with just the right amount of crisp around the edges. Doesn't taste like donuts, but very delicious anyway. I used regular sized muffin tins, and they make eight total, because a mini muffin tin is 1/3 of a regular muffin tin. I consider myself a picky eater, and this completely satisfied both me, my family and my neighbors taste. Love it, Dianne!

I made these gluten free, so I would imagine that the original ones are better. But they came out pretty good, nice sweet little snack, easy and fast.  Id like to try these with frosting and sprinkles next time.

I made these wonderful little muffins.  If you closed your eyes and I placed one in your mouth, you would swear it was a donut hole.   I will be making more and bringing them into work.  I'm sure they will not last too long!

Me and my siblings love these! Whenever we want a treat, they are so easy to whip up. We have experimented with many different flavors and have even made a chocolate version. Our favorite thing to do is make plain batter (no seasonings) and top them with bubblegum flavored glaze! I have also rolled them in powdered sugar and stacked them in order to achieve a Regency Era dessert look. :)

These were nice and simple to make. The batter was thick, so I was nervous that something had gone wrong (my eight year old was reading the recipe for me), but they turned out fantastic. My four year old loved rolling the mini muffins in the butter and cinnamon sugar. We'll definitely be making these again!

great recipe! mine turned out the way I wanted it to be (which is milky in taste). Although I got confused by the serving part because I wanted to make 12 muffins, instead I got 5 1/2. I guess that's my mistake for not reading the reviews first. haha but anyway, still a great treat for the family! ????

I made these just as written and they tasted great! 
I had a tiny problem getting them out of the pan even though I did grease the pan. I wasn't sure how long to wait before removing them, while still warm ? Until cooled? This is not reflective  of the quality of the recipe, but rather an inexperienced cook! I'm glad to have this recipe!

I've made these twice, once with cinnamon and sugar on the whole thing and once with just a dusting on top.  I found that covering the whole thing in c and s was too sweet.  They have a pleasant crunchy texture on the outside.

These were really good! My only problem was the baking time was too long. I baked them for 15 minutes, and the bottoms of the muffins were very dark brown. Any longer and they would have been burnt. Next time I'll take them out a few minutes earlier. I was skeptical about the "donut" flavor, but was pleasantly surprised! They even smelled like donuts while baking in the oven! My family loved them. My one complaint is that 24 doesn't go very far divided between my family of 6, so next time I'll have to double the recipe to prevent a riot!

Made these with my granddaughter; they were a big hit.  Easy to make and very tasty.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  Only had 12 mini-muffin cups, so did a couple larger muffins.  Granddaughter liked bigger ones, husband like small ones.  Will definitely by using this recipe often.

Turned out AWESOME .Made changes used melted coconut oil in the batter, unswesweetened almond milk and whole wheat flou and brown sugar. Dipped in meltted margaarine- the one made with olive oil. SO GOOD!!!     5 STAR IS BASED ON THE CHANGES. Never made it the way recipe called so can't  rate it.  :-)a

These are great if your craving doughnuts, that taste and texture are very similar, i added 1\4 cup more sugar, and 1\2 teaspoon more nutmeg. Unfortunately, even after spaying the pans generously with non-stick spray, they still thoroughly stuck to the pans. They had great flavor though!

I have made these many times. I use butter instead of margarine. They are so good. Very addictive as they are just so easy to pop into your mouth. Thank you for this tasty recipe!

These need no changes, none.  There is no way you can make just one batch of these little things.  They go fast!!!! Easy to pop in your mouth as a snack or warm up for breakfast.  I used a mini muffin tin and it worked perfectly.  Will triple or more than triple the recipe to make larger muffins next time I make them.  They're a lot of work and while rolling them in cinnamon sugar, your family will snatch them up.  They go fast!!!

O.M.G. These are amazing. Truly one of the best recipes I've tried from this site. I used butter rather than margarine (yuk). I found that the recipe does indeed make 24, rather than 12, little muffins. When I make them next (and I will ... soon!), I will try shaking the buttered muffins in a bag with the cinnamon sugar rather than rolling them in it. Would be much quicker, and probably a little less sugar clinging to them. Which was GREAT. But. :)

Yummy! Glad I made a double recipe. Only thing I changed was I didn't roll them in the butter before rolling them in the cinnamon/sugar.

Ok so these are pretty good i doubled the recipe to make 12 regular sized muffins as i don't have a mini muffin pan. I did not double the nutmeg tho and i am glad,  they were very strong at first but did mello out the next day! This is a very easy to make muffin i made them with my 3 and 4yrs old boys.  The batter was a little crazy at first when we added the milk it made the butter mixture clumpy but it did end up ok! I do think these would be better as mini muffins but that is no reflection on the recipe!  I think i will try them again as mini muffins and maybe swap out some of the white sugar for brown and review again!

I have made this twice this week it was so good!  I made these exactly as written the first time.  They were so well received that I was asked to make them again- what better to make on a day with 24+ inches of snow?  This time I made the recipe as written and did two more batches - one with powdered sugar that I did not dip in the butter.  Second was rolled in white sugar that I had sitting with vanilla beans in to flavor it.  I also used a pastry bag with a large piping tip to inject some strawberry jelly into some of the muffins.  So good!  Next- will try Boston Cream and other variations.   Nice recipe to have younger kids help with, too.

Delicious! Definitely not for ppl on a diet!  :) i used Epicure's mini donut silicone mold instead of a muffin tin since I don't have one (yet). Baked them for 11 mins only and they're perfect! Thanks Dianne!

I just got a mini-muffin pan and tried these.  They are good.  A few comments.  They barely made 22 muffins and I sort of scrimped on filling them.  I would double the recipe next time.  I also will cook on 350 as the bottoms were too brown.  A little dry so I'll add more milk or maybe an egg.  I think I will cut back on the nutmeg by 1/4 and supplement with cinnamon.  I only used about half of the cinnamon coating but had separated it so I can use with the next batch. I'd also like to make these as regular size muffins.  It seems like a lot of changes but I like to write these notes for others and so I will remember them.  I will definitely make again!  Thank you.

I rate tis 5 starts for ease and taste.  These were quite tasty.  I did use eggnog, though, in place of the milk.  And I made an eggnog glaze (I was looking for a way to use up some eggnog).  Everyone loved them.  I also did not have a mini-muffin pan, but my muffin pan is on the small side and this made 12.  Will make again, they were so easy.

These are very good, but don't do what I did!  I rolled them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and thought more has to be better so I scooped up more of the cinn/sug mix and patted it on them after rolling them.  Not a good idea!  Turned out too sweet and too cinnamony(is that a word?).  So make them just the way the recipe says and there will be plenty of cinnamon/sugar on them when you roll them.

These are really good! They taste like those mini donuts you get at fairs. The only thing that I did was accidentally add cinnamon to the batter, will try without it next time and see the difference. My family loved these, thank you!

Definitely double this recipe, soooo good! Used a regular muffin tin and just dipped the tops with the butter and cinnamon sugar. These were gone within minutes at my house, my family loved them!

I didn't like these at all. There was way too much nutmeg, and my first batch burned at 15 min.

I made three batches for my daughter's class. The first batch barely filled the muffin tin but I made it stretch. I used butter to grease the cups and they turned out sort of chewy on the outside in not so great a way. The other batches I used paper liners but if I wasn't careful, most of the muffin would have been left in the liner.  It wound up taking me like 3 hours to make 3 batches. I wouldn't do it again for a class as mini muffins. They tasted good though and didn't last long.

The muffins turned out well but the butter and sugar was too much. Next time I'll brush just the top with some butter then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on instead of dipping and rolling.
I made these by mixing all the dry ingredients first then adding the butter and milk on top, this made it so much easier to mix without lumps.

I didn't have mini muffin tins so managed to make 11 regular muffins. I agree with reviews to reduce the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp - it was almost perfumey! 
Will try next time without nutmeg actually.

I cooked mine for 15 minutes, but they could have come out of the oven a minute or two sooner.  Overall, I think this was a pretty good base recipe that will allow for playing with different flavors and fillings.  Thanks for posting!

This was so easy and really good. I got 24, just good for my mini muffin tin. Just a bit too much nutmeg for me. I used whole wheat flour, it's all I had. I used the suggestion of another reviewer and tossed in a bag with the sugar and cinnamon. I also dipped a few of the tops in melted chocolate. They were good either way. Thanks Dianne for a really nice recipe. I will be making again.

These are fine but I probably won't make again. Tasty out of the oven but seem to get denser with age and less crispy.  They do taste like a donut initially though!  One batch is pretty small- won't impress a crowd!

These were okay. Very simple to make and made 24 perfectly shaped mini muffins. The nutmeg didn't seem over-powering to me at all and really, they could have used more flavor...vanilla or something. They didn't taste like donuts at all but are cute little muffins. I did some with cinnamon/ sugar, some with chocolate icing and some with vanilla icing.

I have been making these for over 40 + years.  My family calls them "cholesterol bombs".  Now when the grand kids come for a visit this  recipe is what they want me to make first for them.  They are the best if eaten immediately.  I always use butter

This recipe had potential. Im sure it is my fault, but after adding the milk, my sugar became hard and clumpy and stuck to the spoon. It made the muffins have sweet spots and bland spots after baking. Overall, a decent flavor, just a little off with the sugar.

Wow, these r good...like I mean reeeeally good! The instructions were fantastic and the measurements were perfect right down to the last grain of sugar cinnamon! The only change I made was to use stevia baking blend instead of sugar and these little,balls of goodness didn't seem to notice the difference. These will b making it into my fave recipes. Thank u from the bottom of my tummy!

As stated, cream the sugar and the shortening me don't sift,  I use butter, not margarine, much better flavor,  I also kick the cinnamon up a notch for the coating as we are all crazy for it,  I use mini muffin tins, back for about half the time called for,  everyone thinks this is a superb substitute for donut holes!

Wonderful recipe! Easy and delicious.  After the muffins were done, I brushed on the melted margarine and then rolled in the sugar and cinnamon.  I only needed about half of what the recipe calls for.  Yum.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved this, I subbed  the milk for sweet cream and added  one teaspoon of vanilla into the milk. I had to melt the butter to add in the mix but it came out perfect.  The inside was a bit dry but I think next time I am going to try subbing some applesauce in place of the butter to retain moisture. These were a family hit, gone in the same day I made them.

I followed the recipe to the T. The kids love them. Next time I think I will use my vanilla sugar for the muffin part and only dip them in the butter and cinnamon sugar on the tops.

Made these exactly as written. They remind me of the mini doughnuts you get at the fair. These were very tasty fresh, i can see them drying out quickly though..(like they last that long) if you're not planning on serving them right away maybe try oil in place of the butter in the batter.

These turned out great!   I didn't have a mini-muffin tin so I made these full sized (a double batch makes a dozen).  I took another reviewers advice and reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 a tsp because I didn't want it to be too overwhelming...they turned out nice but next time I will use all the nutmeg called for!   A great recipe to be followed as written!

These were delicious. The only problem I had with it was the cinnamon. It didn't stick very well, and the muffins by themselves needed a little flavor. Otherwise, they were great!

Taste like some of the Tim Hortons timbits (if you were Canadian you would know what those are). I will indeed make them again!

The taste was really excellent, but I think I may have fudged the texture by changing the milk to almond milk in an attempt to make it vegan. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and used a mini muffin pan, which produced almost 24 cute little muffins. The cinnamon-sugar mix at the end is really the best finishing touch.

I really liked the taste of these, but didn't give it the 5 stars because they were a bit dry.  They were good enough that I want to make them again, and I think I'll try adding a bit more milk to moisten them.  I did get 24 mini-muffins out of the batter.  I would try minimally reducing the nutmeg next time, as it did give it that "donut" flavor, but was edging on a stronger "eggnog" flavor by being a wee bit too much.  Funny thing is I completely missed step 4 with the sugar coating.  Bummer!  I will try a reduced version of that next time, as I thought they were pretty tasty without and might just do with a sprinkle of brown sugar on top before putting into the oven.

I made these for the first but not the last time tonight. I followed the recipe exactly except for dipping them in butter at the end. I only used the sugar and cinnamon and they were perfect in our estimation.  I also doubled the recipe and got 15 regular sized muffins. They're delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

These little muffins were a huge hit with my two kids.  They ate them all in 1 day!  I already had a bottle of cinnamon-sugar combo so I used that for the coating to save time.  I also used colored sprinkles to coat some and my children really liked them like that too.

I made this rand it turned out horrible!  I used butter instead of margerin. And I used normal sized muffin trays so that might have been why. They were bubbly and burnt.

We make these quite often.  The kids love them and request them all the time!  It's also handy to have a muffin recipe that doesn't contain eggs, just in case we're out.

Just made these for my boys. They ate the entire batch. I asked if I should put these on the "make again" list? Their answer was clearly a yes! They wondered how long it would take to make more :) I should mention so simple and easy and we had all the ingredients on hand!

My family loves these!  I mistakenly; however, didn't read the recipe all the way through and put the cinnamon in the mixture (so that might be the key as to why they love them too). I also only use butter.

I've been making these with children and grandchildren for 50 years. The original mini muffin recipe is for "French Breakfast Puffs" from a Betty Crocker cookbook.  Our local bakery makes the "full size" version, calls them "Dirt Bombs" and they sell out every Sunday. The minis are a family tradition every time we gather for a brunch celebration.

I was looking for a non-fruit muffin recipe for my kiddos and came across these.  We decided to try them, making just as directed (for me they made 16 mini muffins).  Here are my thoughts...  They take just like donuts, but without the frying.  Yumm!  I did think the nutmeg was a little on the strong side for my taste (not bad...we still ate them all fairly quickly ;), but next time I may try 1/2 tsp just to see the difference.  The only other thing I noticed was that there was barely enough butter to roll them in before dipping in the sugar/cinnamon.  So, maybe dip very lightly, or make sure you have extra butter just in case. 

All in all, when we're looking for a special treat, we'll definitely make these again!

These are amazing. I am not a huge fan of nutmeg so I substituted the nutmeg with cinnamon and did a couple of sprinkles of the nutmeg instead. They taste like Munchkins!

Awesome!  Tasted like donuts, but not deep fried!  My recipe ended up making 20 instead of 24, and they needed only 12-13 minutes to bake.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made these for a Sunday brunch and they were a hit! I followed the recipe exactly for the first batch. AWESOME! For the second batch I added lemon extract and some grated lemon to the batter and frosted them with a lemon glaze. AWESOME again! Any flavor, really, would be yummy. I filled the tins about 3/4 full and was rewarded by 21 mini-muffins. I found the baking time to be spot-on so be careful not to overcook as I did in a subsequent batch. They are rather hard and dry if you do; not nearly as good as if you do it correctly. Also, I had to use half & half in one batch because I was out of milk. I noticed no difference in the outcome or taste. This will be a standby quick treat for unexpected guests & relaxing breakfasts.

Where have these been all my life??!  Wow, these were delicious.  I found that they came out of the pan the easiest if I did it right out of the oven and didn't overfill the tins. But I found they dipped in the butter and sugar the best, if they cooled a bit and solidified.  Otherwise, some crumbled and broke and made a mess.  I quadrupled the recipe as I was baking for my daughter's school blood drive.  It made a little over 3 pans of 24.  Also, I cut back the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp per batch, so 2 tsp total and it was perfection.  PERFECTION!

An easy and delicious way to make Mini Muffins that taste like Donuts.  My batch made 17 Mini Muffins and that was plenty.  We Love the Nutmeg and the Ground Cinnamon touch.

I made this following the recipe exact except using gluten free flour.  The batch was perfect for 12 muffins.  Super easy to make and so delicious!

We've made this numerous times and have to double it.  They are the right size for kids and snacking.  I usually have to melt more than 1/4 c. butter for dipping before rolling in sugar/cinnamon mixture. If you aren't into nutmeg, you can always scale back the amount to meet your taste buds.  They are worth making!

Muffins were very dry.  The recipe should be re-worked, perhaps using sour cream.  Way too much topping, I cut it in half.  Not as spicy as real doughnuts, maybe the types of spice and the amounts should be re-jiggered as well.

Recipe made 11 full-sized muffins and they slid easily out of the muffin tin.

I was looking for something quick to fix for a Sunday morning treat for my husband. We enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I followed the directions as written. I had a little bit of the sugar cinnamon mixture left over. I will cut that in 1/2 next time.

I used butter as it was what I had on hand, and used 1/2 c whole wheat flour & 1/2 c all purpose flour. Amazing! I can't wait to try these with a little diced steamed apple to make apple donut hole muffins!

I love this recipe! Today we had school cancelled and hubby working from home because of bad weather. These were a hit with everyone! Best part is I always have all the ingredients on hand. Today I tried this recipe in my mini donut pan instead of the muffin pan and it was just as good. :)

I have made this recipe about 20 times and loved them every time.  I made them today with whole wheat flour vs. white and they didn't rise.  Just a warning to those of you trying to make them healthier: stick to the original recipe!  :)  Also, I don't use the butter when coating them with cinnamon sugar, and the flavor still sticks to them.

I was excited to make these muffins with my kids. I saw how much nutmeg the recipe called for and questioned it, but since this was my first time making them I followed the recipe 100%. The amount of nutmeg is completely overwhelming.  While the muffins looked great, they were not good. My children and I took one bite and couldn't finish them. The kids just licked the sugar topping off. I will attempt to make these muffins again with way less nutmeg or no nutmeg at all; substituting in cinnamon instead.

Five star for sure!  Great recipe!  Used butter instead of margarine.  I also brushed on the melted butter before I place them in the cinnamon and sugar.  It seemed easier and didn't soak up as much butter. Definitely will make again.   mew

I absolutely love these mini muffins however when I made my batter I added half teaspoon vanilla to the batter. My husband suggested I coate them with powdered sugar and cinnamon instead of granulated sugar as the recipe suggests. They turned out so much better! My family insists I always make them that way.

Made this exactly as written.  My pans are the mini "WearEver" brand.  I used my smallest scoop (maybe 1 tsp size?) and it made exactly 24.  Baked for only 10 min. and they were done. The pans are dark, so that's probably why they baked a little faster. Used margarine - next time I will use butter.  I just like the taste better.  My husband thought there was too much sugar on the outside - I thought they were perfect.  When it comes to sugared donut holes, I like them to have that crunch on the outside.  I just kept popping one in my mouth here and there as I cleaned up the kitchen.  I finally stopped after 8.........even then I wanted just 1 (or 2)more.   : )

So delicious. My husband are half the batch (and he is not usually a sweet tooth). I left the muffins in the oven for 20mins which was a bit too long so next time I'll just bake them for 15mins. Highly recommend this, unless you're on a diet!

Would of been even better if I had taken them out before the 15 minutes was up(even though I was using a standard 24 mini muffin pan), as they were a little too dry, and had used salted butter instead of unsalted to dip them in the sugar-cin mixture. Good tho!

This is a great and simple recipe!  I highly recommend you NOT deviating from the recipe.  The first attempt I tried with other recommendations and they did not turn out and the second time I decided to stick to the recipe and directions and they turned out perfect!  Made these for a tea and got lots of high remarks and my kiddos loved them too!!

These were just ok. I was excited about them because I thought they'd taste like donut holes, but alas...they did not. I made them with all 3/4 tsp nutmeg the first time and found the flavor to be too much. I guess I really don't like nutmeg and my family didn't care for them either. Used margarine and decided to use butter the second time as I don't like the margarine flavor as much. Tried them again with butter, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and they were better. Still not great, but better. Texture was perfect and we liked the cinnamon-sugar topping, but the rest is so-so. I probably won't be making these again.

I changed the flour to 1 cup gluten free flour and 1/2 teaspoon Xanthan gum.  Baked for 16 mins.  Dip tops in melted butter and dip in cinnamon sugar mixture.

I just made these. I got 24 little gems of delicious! The first couple were too sugared but after eating a few I got them just right. House smells great and the Hubby gobbled them up. I saw them on a tv program where people were talking about "the best thing they ever ate". That's a little broad for me, I think Jeff Smith's recipe for Italian ragu is the best thing I ever ate. These are simple to make with staple pantry ingredients. I'll keep this as an easy quick go to for pop in guest and holidays. Great recipe and thanks for sharing it.

These little gem of a donut were delicious! I was a little concerned about the amount of nutmeg , like some other reviewers, but once they were baked, sugared and ate, my concerns were no more. I used my little Bellini mini donut maker and they turned out perfect. Next time I might baked for just a little longer to make the outside a little more crunchy, but these were very tastey.

Quick and easy recipe for something sweet & different. I bought a standard pan from Walmart for mini-muffins & ended up with enough batter for 30 mini-muffins. These were really good the night I made them while still warm. I would not advise making them for the next day as they hardened considerably overnight. My only complaint would be to cut down just slightly on the nutmeg (1/2 teaspoon instead), as it overpowered the topping in my opinion. I'll be making these again soon!

Nothing resembling a donut whatsoever.  Don't get your hopes up.  These should be called Nutmeg Mini-Muffins.

These are so delicious!  I had to make them without the nutmeg since I was out and added a little vanilla extract instead.  Yumm!  Good luck with them lasting more than a couple of days :)

A wee bit too much nutmeg for me.  Overall process was easy and I will try this again, maybe just substituting cinnamon for the nutmeg.  Thanks!

They were dry and had a sour taste.  They don't at all taste like donuts, either; more like sweet-ish muffins with cinnamon sugar on the outside.  Made once, won't make again.

Very good.  Kinda tough to get out of the pan without breaking.  May have to let them cool for 7 minutes or so in the pan before getting out.

Made a double batch of these last night, and I'm making another batch tonight. These were really good! The batter comes together quickly, and they bake up fast. I didn't get 24 from my batter- I got 17 on the first batch and 14 on the second (but my 8 y/o filled the pan on the second batch and overfilled them) I think the cinnamon sugar coating was a bit much at first-it was like getting a mouthful of sugar. But I put all the finished muffins in a large ziploc bag and took them on a picnic, and all the excess sugar fell off and they were perfect. Very cute, very yummy little muffins!

Make as written and thought it was a four.  Made a couple of substitutions and thought it was a five star.  Change nutmeg to cinnamon.  Added vanilla (didn't measure, probably 1/2 tsp) to the batter and to the melted butter than i used to coat.  Not sure why the recipe says to let them cool, they are really good still warm.

Amazing, I ate the whole batch (with some help from my co-workers) in 3 days! I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituted with some apple pie spice I had on hand.  They tasted like fall!  I will certainly make these little guys again.  MMMM!

made these with butter instead of margarine and they turned out ok. maybe I just don't like nutmeg so they were a little too overwhelming for me. if I ever make them again, I will be browning the butter that they are dunked in before rolling in cinnamon sugar. that might really take this to another level!

just didn't like the combination of flavors.  I greased the muffin pan well and they still stuck.  I only cooked 15 minutes and they burned.  I will probably try again with some adjustments in ingredients, cooking time, and adding muffin tins.

Very good! A tad too much nutmeg for my tasting, but overall yummy. I didn't have mini-muffin pans and this made 11 small muffins. I also didn't have milk on hand and used almond milk instead. We will definitely be making these again!

The end product is essentially the Bisquick French Breakfast Puffs.  It was a bit drier than mine, but that was probably due to my brushing on the butter (a first for me) instead of dipping them. Much healthier, but not as moist.

Great recipe. Everyone that tastes them wants the recipe. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter as well as the nutmeg. I liked the taste much better with the margarine instead of butter. The butter flavour was overwhelming whereas the margarine was subtle. Just scrumptious. Taste even better the next day. Make them, you wont be disappointed.

These were very good. We didn't have nutmeg but it was just as good without. I did have trouble with them sticking to the pan but I will definitely make them again!

Also, make glazed donut muffins by mixing 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Delicious!

Out of this world and super easy.  I made two double recipes and got 24 regular size muffins for teacher's appreciation week at my som's pre-school.  Teachers have been thanking me all week!  I added a little more milk to the second batch because it's very dry here in LA and it was easier to work with and the muffins were a little lighter.  Overall, delicious and will make again...often.

Yum!!! I'm more of a visual learner, so the video really helped me see how to dip/roll the baked little muffins.  I am not the biggest fan of nutmeg and the first time I made them, that spice was a little strong for me, so on the 2nd batch I used only 1/4 nutmeg and 2/4 cinnamon...much better, for me!!!  These are perfect little munchies and so easy, quick and simple to make!  Will make these again...and quite often!

i gave it 5 star because it looks like a great recipe but i have yet to try it, i do have a question though, i do not have a mini muffin sheet so i was wondering if it would work the same if i made more dough and used a regular sized muffin sheet?

Delicious!!!  I, too, slightly decreased the amount of nutmeg to around 1/2 tsp.  Very similar to a recipe my mom made for me and my sister when I was a child. Now I made this for my kids and they loved it too!!  Light, sweet and I love the mini size!

Just made these this morning.  Was looking for a quick breakfast item with what I had on hand.  These were simple to make and absolutely delicious.  Dipped just tops in butter and sugar/cinnamon as others suggested and they were perfect.  I will definitely be making these again.

Thought these came out great. I did do as others suggested in that I used less nutmeg. In fact, I used a little less than 1/4t.

These were just okay for me.  The nutmeg was a bit overwhelming and I only used half of what was recommended. Not a bad treat, but they did not have the donut taste I was hoping for.

Perfect!! I made these not even 15 min ago and all 24 are already gone! I few things I did differently: I added just a hint of cinnamon to the batter (nothing more than 1/8th tsp) and added a bit more milk because the batter seemed a bit dry for muffins. Be careful not to ever over mix muffin batter, as that'll give the gluten more time to form in the flour, making your muffins tougher. Defiantly going to make again, and they're perfect with an ice cold glass of milk!!

Delicious! But you don't need so much butter & sugar at the end for the topping; ended up wasting most of it. In fact, these are so good (and have so much sugar baked in) that they don't really need topping.

Great recipe!!!! This is fast to make a very tasty. I highly recommend using the mini muffin pan in order to get the full effect. I would imagine this recipe would be even better made with real butter instead of margarine.

I can’t get enough of these. I made them 3 days in a row because we ate them so fast! I can’t ever just have one. The hubby loves them bc they keep well and he can snack on them on his way to work. My 4 year old thinks they are “awesome muffins” Very pleased.

Eating these delicious mini donuts as we speak! I used to recipe but cooked them in my Babycakes Mini Donut Maker -- so good! My little sisters love them and I can't stop eating them. The nutmeg really adds something special and the recipe wouldn't be the same without it. Yum!

These were delicious! Just be careful with dipping them into the margarine after cooking. Too much makes them taste way too buttery!

I made this recipe because I was craving donuts but didn't want to go though the hassle of making real donuts. This recipe was amazing! It was so simple and easy. I had all of the ingredients and whipped these up a a second. They are so yummy and so easy!

Made these with my daughter.  They were just OK.  I kept thinking that the recipe was missing something to give it some oomph.  I think a pinch of salt perhaps.  My daughter said that the finished result had too much butter and sugar.  I doubt we will make these again.

I absolutely love these little suckers and I can never eat just one. I've used this recipe many times now and I always end up doubling the recipe to have enough. I don't think the nutmeg is overpowering, but I'm rather fond of the taste to begin with. When I dip them in the margarine I usually find that I need about 1/2 a cup instead of only 1/4. Also, as I am not in possession of a mini-muffin tin currently, I found that I can just as easily use a regular muffin tin and only put enough dough in each divot to cover the bottom. You'll have little muffins (if a bit wide) that won't be under cooked in the middle and are still bite size!

The reviews and the idea of homemade donuts had me so excited for this one.  It was good, just not up to my high expectations, I guess.  I will say that these were actually better a day or two later, if you seal them in tupperware (do not refidgerate).

This Recipe is sooo awesome, my mom asks me to make it all the time, who cares if it's plagiarized as long as it tastes good. I like to make a vanilla frosting and pipe that in there before I put the coating on, that way everyone gets a sweet surprise on there first bite and the coating keeps it in the muffin instead of letting it spill out.

This is a great recipe! I even added a little cinnamon to the batter and I used a Bella cake pop & Donut hole baker to make donut holes.   I rolled them in powdered sugar for one batch and cinnamon & brown sugar for the other batch and we gobbled them up. My picky kids said they were delicious! I am going to make these over and over again!

the donuts rose nicely, but too much nutmeg and when coating them, there is too much butter and sugar.  We coated the last half with only the sugar and cinnamon mixture while the donuts were still hot and the sugar stuck so that was much better.  Otherwise, it tasted like we were eating a sponge of butter and cinnamon sugar with a huge douse of nutmeg.  will look for another recipe.

This recipe is great, I tried it as soon as I seen it! The only thing I did different was make regular size and 1/4 tsp nutmeg by accident, but it was still delicious! I'm officially hooked, so simple and decadent. Thanks for sharing!

These weren't that great. I followed the recipe exact. The muffins themselves didn't taste too great and the only saving grace with the kids was the cinnamon and sugar. They soaked up so much butter and were quite the PITA to coat, very time consuming. I won't be making these again.

This is my family's favorite muffin recipe.  When my son was in kindergarten in 1993, they made them as part of their math curriculum.  We affectionately call them Kindergarten Muffins!  I like them because I usually have all the ingredients on hand and they make up really quick.  I was looking in my recipe box for this recipe and couldn't find it this morning. Thanks to the internet, I found the recipe again!  It's now in my recipe box.

I found these to be seriously lacking in flavour.  I'd add some cloves and ginger, and probably a tsp of vanilla.

Very good!! I will be making them again. I did not have nutmeg so I used cinnamon in both areas, I can't wait to try them with nutmeg. I do not have a mini muffin pan and I got 9 regular ones out of the batch so I doubled to make 18.

I give it a 3 because my family adored them. However I found them to be too sweet & oily for my liking. It's an OK recipe. I will adapt it next time to make it fit to my taste. :)

The muffins have a strong taste of nutmeg maybe it is better to put 1/3 of it and it will taste better.  Still looking for a good recipe for muffins...the search goes on. - LISA

Great recipe except I made a few changes. First of all I don't like nutmeg that much so I substituted vanilla and I made them in my 'Babycakes' cake pop maker and they turned out awesome. I got 24 'donut holes' by doing it this way.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  They tested like the donuts from the grocery store, which I often buy.  So I am going to substitute my donuts shopping with this recipe.  The ingredients are simple, and everyday-use ingredients.  Easy snack for kids and casual girls get-together!  

PS: I used regular muffin tins, and this recipe yielded for 8 regular size.

This is a great recipe! I made them for the kids and the first thing they said "Did you make these Mom? They are even better than the donuts at the apple orchard!" They taste the same and so much lighter than fried donuts. A new family favorite.

I made these this morning and we enjoyed them so much!!!  Made them exactly to the recipe.  I didn't use any melted butter but made a cinnamon glaze of 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 c milk, 1 1/2-2 c powdered sugar (my favorite).  I rolled some in the glaze and then rolled them in the cinnamon sugar (My hubby's favorite).  Will definitely make again!  Recipe made 24 mini-muffins.

They fell apart and didn't taste the greatest, but i used cinnamon in the whole recipe because I didn't have nutmeg, it over powered other flavors.

I love these! They remind me of a nutmeg donut hole! They are very good as a delectable autumn treat! 
Instead of coating them in the margarine and cinnamon-sugar mix, I mixed those ingredients together while the donuts were baking, and I iced them once they came out! I think they're better that way!

Why this recipe doesn't have a solid 5 star rating is beyond me.  They are exactly what they say they are.  I agree with another reviewer in saying that I only wish I had made more batter.  At least 3 times the amount.  Won't make that mistake again! :) Delicious and easy for kids to help with!

I just made these for my son who is allergic to peanuts and nuts.  He can't have donuts from a bakery so I thought I'd make these.  They were good.  I used the suggestion of glazing some with a vanilla glaze because glazed donut holes are my favorite kind.  I actually preferred the cinnamon sugar ones.  With the nutmeg in the donut, the cinnamon sugar ones were better tasting. I guess all that matters is that my son was happy that he got to eat some donuts!!

I made these in a mini donut maker. Used 1/2 tsp nutmeg and needed to add a little more milk cause it was too thick. They turned out very good. Very easy.

Off the hook good. Just decreased the nutmeg a little, but a necessary ingredient for the overall flavor. You could roll these in powdered sugar as well. Yum!

Very simple to make in the morning.  I had to make a double batch because my kids ate them so fast. I did use cake flour instead and they turned out great.

These were wonderful...personally, I used freshly grated nutmeg, b/c that is all I buy, and used about 1 1/2 tsp. We LOVE nutmeg, and didn't find this too much, but then that is just us...we are spice nuts.  There are The Spice Girls, so I guess we would be The Spice Family!

I used this recipe because of the simplicity - made 3 double batches - one of the batches I used cinnamon in place of nutmeg...think I like it best. Also for toppings I use the cinn/sugar - another the powdered sugar glaze and lastly Chocolate Sanity glaze. The all look so cute - just dipped the tops. Made for a breakfast my daughter is having for a bunch of teachers. I bet they will enjoy them!! Thanks for saving me a lot of time!!

I thought this was okay in a pinch but kinda dense.  I used regular muffin tins since I don't have mini's, maybe that made the difference.

If you like doughnuts, you have to give this recipe a try.  It's had 1,300+ reviews, and all I can say it is they're outstanding!  I baked in mini-doughnut pans which I think added to the "cuteness" factor of these mini doughnuts.

There were some flaws in this recipe but it was still delicious. The batch actually ended up serving (barely) 9 instead of 12 (or 24 mini). When I finished the coating I had over half of the sugar & cinnamon left over. The muffins turned out to be a dry so next time I'll put in 1/2 cup of melted butter or maybe 1 1/2 cups of milk. However, for being 88 calories they're very delicious.

These were great!  The title is perfect because it tastes exactly like a donut and a muffin together.  I didn't have my mini muffin pan, so I used my larger one and just filled them less.  Next time I will for sure use my mini because these are like little donut holes you can just pop in your mouth.  So good!  Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE I have made these in the mini muffin pan and they are just to die for!  They are like mini pop-able donut muffins that you can pop in your mouth and the recipes is super easy and fast to make at any time.  Great for a dessert or a side for breakfast!  LOVE :)

I think I made a mistake making these... I did gluten free, and have a hard time from not eating them all!! Very easy and fast recipe.

very good and very cheap to make! No eggs...perfect for a time when money is tight...! I added a little cinnamon to the sugar, margarine, and nutmeg mix.

These were ok.  It needed a less nutmeg and a little extra in the batter but I still can't pin point what, maybe add a little cinnamon to the batter.  I used butter for both, it's fine in the batter but way too heavy to dip the muffins in.

Just made these for the first time and they were really good. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the nutmeg was just right. The potency of spices can vary a lot, though, based on their age and even the brand. I was doing a test run of these for an upcoming bake sale and I'm going to experiment with the next batch. Mine browned a little too much on the bottoms before getting golden on the top. The muffins seemed pretty wet after dipping them into the butter and the cinnamon sugar coating started lumping up after rolling the first few. I'm going to try reducing the heat to 350 since I'm using dark pans. I'll turn the baked muffins onto a baking pan, spray them with melted butter, toss and spray again. Then I'll put them on a rack, sift the cinnamon/sugar over them, toss and repeat.

These. Are. DELICIOUS! I had accidentally doubled the butter in the batter (*cringe*), but they turned out perfectly anyway! They're soft, moist, and have just the right amount of nutmeg to be irresistible smelling. My sisters agreed with me that coating the entire muffin would be a bit much, so we only put the cinnamon sugar on the tops. These are definitely being mad again and SOON! Xxx

the recipe wasn't too good. the muffin that was supposed to be dipped in the butter was too soggy. if i were to do this recipe again, i would spread the butter with a brush opposed to dropping it in butter. the final product was deceiving. it looked amazing, just like the pictures, but the bite was soggy. then the tastes didn't mix. it wasn't that good. i wouldn't recommend this recipe, it wasn't easy to understand.

Oh my goodness, these are delicious! And they are so fast and easy to whip up. I made them, let them cool down, put them in the fridge, after about ten minutes pulled them back out, and then my husband and I ate them all. Couldn't resist. I'm going to make another batch today so the kids can try them too.
One word of advice, watch the baking time! I pulled them out after 15 minutes, and they were a bit too crunchy. Still delicious, but not as soft as I would have liked.

Too much nutmeg! Also, I doubled the recipe and got 24 mini muffins. However, I did not double the cinnamon/sugar mixture and had just enough for the muffins. I brushed the muffins with margarine instead of dipping and it worked really well.  The proportions seem to be a little off in this recipe and will need to be altered to your personal taste.

The outcome was really good except we added extra sugar which made it a little but to sweet by overall it was good. When I was taking the donuts out of the oven it was not as circular as it was suppose to be and I think thats because it hasn't rised well enough because it came out flat and small. The recipe was easy to make and easy to follow but I made some mistakes, I would totally recommend this ingrident and recipe to other people because it was easy and good, if you follow all the instructions correctly. I would for next time add a little less sugar then we used but otherwise I loved it.

I tried this recipe after I couldn't find my go-to recipe for these that seems to have disappeared from allrecipes. It was named "coffee puffs", or something similar. Anyone know this recipe I am talking about?  Anyway, these are excellent and LOVED by my family. The only difference I noticed was that these did not rise as well, which actually could have been an over mixing error on my part, since there is no other mention of this in the reviews.  Very good! I made sure to save this, and may print it as well to avoid losing it in the future!

Disappointed!  I was looking for a similar recipe I used to make when I was younger.  This was close, but didn't hit the mark.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize what the recipe was missing until the "muffins" were in the oven.  There are no eggs!!!  The batter was odd, something wasn't right and I couldn't put my finger on it.  Then as I slid the tray in the oven, I realized there were no eggs.  The "muffins" were okay straight out of the oven, but became hard as rocks within 10 minutes.  Weird.  Not a favorite!

I'm not a fan of nutmeg but despite that, these turned out really good.  One downfall is trying to use splenda...big oops.  They turned out with a harder exterior and not muffin like at all, but still tasted ok.  When I used regular sugar, that turned out much better.

I really liked this recipe and so did my family. It was so simple and quick. I also loved the fact that there was no eggs in this recipe. The only thing I changed about this recipe was to add a little more nutmeg that was only because I used fresh ground nutmeg. 

I also doubled the recipe because I don't have small muffin tins. I just used a 2 oz ice cream scoop so I could get medium sized muffins and they were still small enough to coat with the same amount of topping.

Over rated... Easy to make but the taste is just OK.  The texture feels like more like muffin.  I do like nutmeg and cinnamon and have used them frequently for other recipes.  However, this recipe's base ingredients are so simple, I taste nothing but sugar and nutmeg and cinnamon.

Texture was great, but the flavor was not. Even with a scant 1/2 tsp nutmeg, it was still too much. Maybe I would do cinnamon instead of nutmeg next time. I filled the muffin tins about 1/3 full and they rose nicely, but I just got 9 large muffins.

Love the taste of this muffin. Its wonderful sweet alternive to donuts. I however had a hard time getting them to stay whole. Mine broke apart and crumbled. They stuck to to the pan and an i had a hard time getting them out whole. I dont know if its my pam the spray i used or what but i tried two of my pains and used more spray and it still happened. Will make it again just might use liners next time and sprinkle on the sugar on top. Despite the muffin falling apart i love them and will make them again trying to keep them whole.

OMG, these are so good! I made these without nutmeg and used applesauce instead of butter to make them a little healthier. We can't stop eating them.  So quick and easy!

I made these and my grandkids luved them,I also rolled some in powder sugar without dipping in the butter and they sure do soak up the butter but that is what makes them taste so good!! everyone always wants to eat healthy, but you only live once so sometimes you just gotta splurge,for tomorrow you might not be here.I will make again and again!!
I'm not big on nutmeg either,so I used just cinnamon..very good!!

These are great! Soft and fluffy, and great flavor too.  Didn't find them overpowered or anything, they were perfect.

Followed the recipe as written except used butter and 1/2 tsp allspice in place of nutmeg (had none). Baked 24 little beauties perfectly! Instead of dipping in melted butter I placed the muffins in a large bowl and "stirred in" the butter using a silicone brush, making sure the muffins were lightly coated. Next I tossed in the cinnamon sugar mixture and removed the coated muffins to a serving plate with a slotted spoon.  In the end I used a lot less butter and achieved the same result.  Thanks for a great recipe, definitely a keeper!

So simple and good. I couldn't find my mini muffin tins but they were still great using a regular size. I did use cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the mufiins because my family prefers it.

Yummy! I made it with butter, next time I'll try margarine to see which way I like best. Also, next I'll only butter the tops before I roll in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I thought the butter flavor was a bit overpowering on the bottom, but still very good!

This were so good! I made them this morning, and everyone loved them! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, the only problem I had with them is I wish I had more! :) This is a AWESOME recipe, I would give this 100 stars!! They DO taste like donuts, thanks Dianne! :D

I did really like these muffins however for the time and ingredients involved, if I'm craving something cinnamon-y, I'll make cinnamon rolls in my breadmaker or go to my local donut shop.  For the amount of butter and sugar I used, I could have made an entire pan of cinnamon rolls.

Overall, they were very good.  They were just a little too time consuming for my liking.

I love doughnuts, and said to myself what the heck.  I was already baking some corn muffins, and was in a baking frenzy.  The recipe was simple, and they were in the oven in no time.  After they had cooled enough to taste, I thought uh oh....   They were like the cake doughnuts you would get at a shop, and my waistline was in trouble!  UMMMM

These were easy and quick; however, I found them to be too sugary, dry, and bland. It's worth experimenting with it to get it just right.

This was fantastic.  I made tiny mini muffins and then slightly larger mini muffins.  The tiny ones were a bit over baked, but still super yummy!  I will definitely make again.  Very easy, and all the ingredients are readily on hand.!!

Yum!!  Love these little things.  I used buttermilk but I wasn't brave enough to deviate from the recipe totally by switching out baking powder for baking soda so I did 1/2 a tsp of each and they came out perfect.

They were really tiny muffins (didn't rise well) so the dough didn't taste "done" after baking. Also too much nutmeg and topping ingredients.

I tried it and my family loved it, but I do have to say that I also changed the amount of the Nutmeg to 1/2 tsp and some of the muffins I decided to make a design with frosting and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on top. Another thing that I did different was keeping the muffins in the baking cups and just dip the top in butter and then into the sugar mix.

My son gave this 5 stars for taste. I give it 5stars for being so quick and easy! Great for a winter morning, they smelled great while they were baking! I used half whole wheat and half white flour, and half white and half brown sugar. Instead of dipping I spread a little butter on top of each muffin with my butter knife before I popped them out of the pan. This gave it the needed salt to round off the taste. Shook them in powdered sugar/cinnamon sugar mixture but only needed about 1/4 cup total. Delicious.

These were pretty good! I think I'd use a little less nutmeg next time, just because they were  bit too "spicy" for my taste buds. For some reason, even though I followed the recipe exactly for the muffins, I was only able to make about 15 muffins...maybe my muffin tins were a bit bigger than usual? Idk. However, I would make these again to go with coffee. I do like that these taste like donuts, but aren't fried like a donut!

Okay, so I made a batch, didn't quite make 24, but I could have put too much in each muffin spot.  I have to say, they were gone almost as soon as I got them done..  Thanks for sharing these!

EXCELLENT!!! Will definitely make these many times over.  I followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with the results.  My kids and I ate all of them up in one sitting, and the boys were asking for more.  The perfect hint of nutmeg with a soft inside and crunchy outside.  The only changes I would make next time is needing more margarine melted for dipping.  I did realize though, for those who want it a tad bit healthier (ha!), is that you really don't need margarine to dip it in.  The sugar mixture will stick to warm donuts without it.

I just made these, and even though I put in too much nutmeg (measuring error), they were wonderful. The best part, other than the taste, is they are low fat and low cholesterol.  A real keeper and easy to make.

We made this recipe using all the ingredients except one, the margarine at the end. When the donuts came out of the oven, I immediately rolled them in Cinnamon Sugar, delish!!! Thanks for one awesome recipe!!!

This are great. And great idea for parties. I tried them with cinnamon and sugar but by seeing other pictures I will try them with powdered sugar and with chocolate glaze.  Thankx for the recipe

Tried this recipe and LOVED it!  The kids went hog wild on them!   The only change I made was a bit less nutmeg!  They turned out fluffy and moist!  Fantastic!

I just made these and I've already eaten 2..They're delicious. The only changes I made was adding a little vanilla extract like other users suggested, I used a bigger muffin pan, but still filled only halfway and I didn't need 1/4 cup butter to dip them in at the end.. I maybe used 2 TBS. They are sooo good...Thanks for the recipe.

I simply sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture on top before I bake them. Less mess and work, but just as yummy.  These are also known as French Breakfast Puffs.

I just made this recipe and my Husband said they were awesome!!! I couldn't believe how easy they were to make. I started at noon, and he was eating his first of many by 12:35. I'll be making these a lot for the girls at work. I used my Wilton mini muffin tin and the batter was exactly the right amount to make 24. Thanks sooo much for such a simple recipe that really turned out perfectly!!!!! I forgot to say that I followed the directions as written with no changes.

These were great!  I halved the batter recipe and got 12 perfect mini-muffins.  I only dipped the tops in butter and sugar-cinnamon to be less messy, and they were still outstanding.  We ate them warm.

SO good!  I used buttermilk instead of milk and it worked perfectly.  Just make sure to omit the baking powder and add ½ tsp baking soda instead.  Wish I made a double batch!

I did not have a mini muffin pan so I used a 12 cup muffin pan and they turned out just fine. I only added the sugar mixture to the tops which resulted more like a muffin than a donut but they were still a hit with the kids!

These muffins are delicious! I didn't roll them in butter and the cinnamon sugar mixture at the end and they are perfectly sweet without. Making mini muffins didn't help because I still ate too many. Its hard to stop eating them!

I asked my daughter what her friend and she wanted for breakfast.  Afterall, the best part of a sleepover is to have a fun breakfast.  She told me to surprise them.  Thanks to this recipe I did. The girls loved them.  I made them in a donut pan and it made 8, so I doubled the recipe so that I had enough to make 15 donuts. They are light and go great with fresh fruit.  I liked them just as well without the sugar/cinnamon coating.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. I actually doubled the batch. :)  I did find that I didn't have to melt butter at the end step to get the cinnamon/sugar to stick. Perfect, less calories!!  Passed the kid test, which as we moms know, is the most important test there is. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly and everybody gobbled them up. I got about 18 with my mini muffin tins, but I know these tins vary in size so that's not a problem. Definitely a keeper; next time I know I'll have to make a double batch because these do not last long in my house. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy! I wanted something to bring in the car for a weekend trip, and these seemed like a good idea. I used a Pampered Chef mini muffin tin and got exactly 24. I love the nutmeg, and I also like that there isn't egg in it. The only change I made was that I didn't want these *so* dripping in butter, so I just dunked the top in butter. Then I put them on my cooling rack and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar - less waste and less mess on my fingers!

Made in donut pans because I did not have mini muffin pans.  Came out looking great.  Taste good.  I cooked them for the 20 minutes, that was a little too long for my oven.  Made 9 donuts and they were all eaten.  Could get away with half the butter and cinnamon sugar for the top, had half left over.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  I did cut back on the nutmeg, and I like to take mine out of the oven at around 13-14 minutes.  I've made these several times now and receive rave reviews each time!  Quick, easy, and yummy!

Very good recipe but I'm confused about the size. It says 24, I resized the recipe for 12 but I hardly got 5 mini ones. (And I used even a bit more baking powder than the recipe told me to.) Not a big fan of nutmeg so I only added nutmeg to one of the muffins -- both nutmeg version and nutmeg-free version turned out good. I used butter. My mom also ate them with me and she said it would have been better if I've added a little vanilla powder because she doesn't like tasting butter that much. (I love the taste of butter so it wasn't a problem for me at all. Just in case you're like my mom :-)

Pretty good.  I liked them best with cininamom sugar.  I cut back a little on the nutmeg and did not coat in butter after, just rolled them in the sugar mixture when warm and it was great.

I just tried these I used a "cooking spray" wonder if they would have turned out a little differently using different method of greasing cups.

great recipe! I used cupcakes cups from paper so you need to peel them off while the Donut Muffins are still hot! or some of the paper sticks to the muffins...

This recipe was pretty good! there was a little too much nutmeg for my liking so if i make this again i will reduce the amount to 1/2 teaspoon. also when i was dipping the donuts into butter, i ran out of butter so i ended up doubling that amount. that may have been because i didn't have mini muffin tins and ended up with 9 medium sized muffin/donuts. besides that they were very good!

Loved these!  Made a double batch and had just enough batter for 48 mini muffins.  Kids devoured these.  Sending 1/2 to school for snack tomorrow. YUM will be making these again!

Tried this recipe today. It came out really great. The only thing was that the serving size was wrong. I only got 11 muffins rather than 24 as listed. Never mind that, they are good!!

I used butter instead of margarine, and instead of the 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg ((I realised to my dismay, after getting out all the other ingredients, I didn't have nutmeg on hand)), I just added almost 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon in the hopes that the recipe wouldn't be thrown off too much.  

I also only had full-sized muffin tins, but I managed to fill ten of them, bake for fourteen minutes, and they came out wonderfully.  This recipe is definitely going to be used again.

We were testing different recipes because my daughter has to bring treats to school, this is what we decided on bringing. So delicious. Mine were done in 20 minutes, made 24 pieces. The only think I did different was to double the cinnamon. I was pleased with how easy and fast it was to make and that I didn't need eggs.

Little bitefulls of happiness...lol I doubled the original recipe due to the boys in my house not stopping at just 1, and I did 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2tsp of cin in the batter since I'm not a huge nutmeg fan... these are an easy simple yummy treat! :)

Tried this one for breakfast this morning. I doubled the recipe and only got 24. According to the recipe I should have had 48 by doubling. (the kids wanted some in their lunch boxes)But other than that it was enjoyed by all. Thank you for sharing it.

Very good!!! I just made them today! However  think next time I will not dip them in the Marg/ butter and roll in sugar mix...I will slightly pour and spinkle. I think it takes too much away from the "DONUT" taste. But very good!!!

Mine didn't turn out as nice as in the picture, but they were pretty good.  There was an odd mouth feel toward the end... probably from the butter, wonder if you could cut that down, probably not.  My family loved these, they only lasted a few minutes, next time double-batch.

Despite it being a Colorado Cache Recipe (and that's ok honey, because it's a goody), I just love these donuts. I remember one night, I was getting the batter ready for baking the next morning and I was completely out of nutmeg! *Gasp!* (and gasp you should). So in a pinch, I substituted Pumpkin Pie spice and everyone just fell head over heels for them. So now I make them at least once a month and I substitute different spices for the nutmeg. A time before that I did a sun-dried tomato herb I had and instead of the butter and cinnamon sugar glaze, I did a sour cream and chive spread.

These are pretty good. The amount of nutmeg in my preference was too much. I didn't even put the whole amount and I thought it was a bit overpowering. But still good! My son helped me and I made a double batch, used the cinnamon/sugar and also did a glaze. Nice with a cup of coffee. Next time, I'm using a bit less nutmeg.

Love this recipe!  My neighbors always mention how much they like these "donuts" too.  I use butter rather than margarine but otherwise keep the recipe the same.  I know the sugar would coat without the extra butter but they're not an everyday food for me so I like the added luxury of dipping in butter before the sugar.

I made these by the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  They were good, but I prefer the French Breakfast Puffs found elsewhere on this site.  They taste more like cake donuts and the recipe is very similar, but baked in regular muffin cups.  I probably will go back to my Breakfast Puffs - so good!!

I really liked the texture although I think of it more like a very fluffy and soft muffin not really like a donut hole.  The only thing I would change is I would cut the nutmeg in half.  I will try the recipe again and tweak to make lemon poppy seed.

Pretty good :)  I should have greased the pan more, and I think 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg would be plenty.

I just made these for the first time and they are almost gone. Great taste and so easy to make from ingredients that everyone should have in the house. Only one thing I changed... I replaced the margarine with butter since that's what I have.

I followed the directions almost exactly. I decreased the amount of nutmeg because I'm not a big fan of nutmeg. I decided to try the recipe because after reading the reviews it sounded like other people who disliked nutmeg liked this recipe. I still didn't like it. The nutmeg was too strong and I just wasn't impressed.

Its been a long time since I had homemade doughnuts, my mom used to make them and these babies are pretty good considering.  They are a close second to moms.  Will be making many many more!

Love that no eggs are required! They are really delicious. I am cooking from a high altitude and did not need to make any adjustments to the recipe. Looking forward to sharing these with weekend visitors :)

First off, I am no muffin maker, so I had my doubts that I could even pull off this five star recipe. Saw this recipe on a number of food blogs but some had a long list of ingredients and that in itself was intimidating. Was out of nutmeg so I subbed a half teaspoon of apple pie spice and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon for my spices and did add a half teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. Sprayed my pans with Pam and baked for fifteen minutes - had twenty four mini muffins that popped right out after three minutes cooling.They do have a donut texture, amazing. I think I could have pulled them out at a little less time but that's just my oven. I can see where some thought the taste was very mild, it's all in the texture and the toppings. I think an icing and sprinkles would really make them special. What a great, simple recipe with which to add your own touch, thanks Dianne!

Loved these.  I thought it was good with only 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  And, as someone else did, I only coated the tops with cinnamon and sugar.  Very addicting!

OK - so they do taste yummy but they never raised completely.  I made them exactly like the recipe said, then I made them again with buttermilk and soda - they were concaved too. what did i do wrong?  Seems like they are missing an egg?

Okay! The first time I made these they turned out fantastic! The second time was a big disappointment I doubled the batch and was so excited for them to come out but they would not rise, and I can't figure out why. I will try again though and will not be doubling the recipe.

I realize these are supposed to be like doughnut holes and therefore not very healthy, but I thought the amount of butter that these soaked up when dropped in the butter before rolling in the sugar mixture, was a little much. I think next time I'll brush the tops with butter or just make a powdered sugar frosting to drizzle over the tops.  Great nutmeg taste to the muffins though!

I don't mind nutmeg but the amount in the recipe leaves it as the predominant flavor; it overpowers the cinnamon, sugar and butter. I will make these again but use about 1/3 of the nutmeg. It is a quick and simple recipe and I believe with that adjustment, a fantastic one.

Well I just got finished baking these followed the directions exactly, not too impressed really. I like that the recipe was easy and great if you don't have eggs but in my opinion this tasted nothing like donut holes, they were pretty bland actually, I think that this recipe could be fantastic with some additions. Thanks for a good base recipe.

First off let me say that I am not a fan of nutmeg, therefore I didn't have any and made this with cinnamon to replace it.  I used real butter. I thought with the ease of this recipe it would be over the top, but I found it, just  o.k.  I would and intend to make this again when I do have nutmeg and will re-evaluate.  With just the cinnamon it did seem to be missing something.  Also I dipped the whole muffin in butter then in the sugar and cinnamon mixture and it was a little bit overwhelming with the butter flavor.  Next time I will just do the tops and see how that turns out.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I am giving these 5 stars however I altered the recipe with whole wheat flour and used larger muffin cups because that was what I had. They were super tasty and my family loved them although i'm sure they would have been better if I made as directed. Thanks for sharing!

We were not a fan because the nutmeg was too overpowering even when I listened to reviews and cut the amount in half.  Maybe one day I will try without nutmeg altogether.  Very easy though and requires few ingredients that you'll have on hand.

Made these as part of my husband's breakfast in bed for Father's Day.  The kids and I had a few before serving them ;)  They were great!  Even though it's tempting, don't overmix the batter! You'll have a lighter donut muffin that way.

Followed this recipe to a 'T' and it yielded 30 perfect mini muffins.  Since my pan only holds twelve, I had to bake in batches.  My husband & children devoured the 1st batch and were looking for more before the 2nd batch was done.  Perfect sweet treat without too much hassle.  They even taste fine without the sugar/cinnamon coating.  I've got to get myself a larger mini muffin pan!

simple AND simply awesome!!  i personally felt that 1/2 tsp of nutmeg was enough.  make 2 batches--you'll eat half of them as soon as they come out!

Followed the recipe, using unsalted butter (what I had on hand)and 1/3c. whole wheat pastry flour for some of the all-purpose. My daughter thought they lacked flavor beyond the sugar-cinnamon topping. Mine also stuck to the pans despite liberal spray of Pam

Although these were tasty they are too sweet. I cut down the sugar to about 2/3 of what the recipe called for and it was still too much.

I would give these 3 and a half stars they were good, but I wouldn't say that they tasted like donuts. There also was a bit too much clove taste. I tried just dipping some in butter and then coating but I think they taste much better if you dunk the muffin in butter and then coat with the cinnamon/sugar mix.

I am giving these 3 starts because even though the taste is really good once you reduce the amount of nutmeg by half (otherwise it overpowers the batter), the recipe does NOT yield 24 mini muffins as the ones pictured. In order to get 24 as puffy as those, you probably need to 1 1/2 the recipe, if not double. We do not use white sugar or white flour at home, so I used whole wheat flour (King Arthur's) and Sucanat. The kids loved them, and so did we.

GREAT recipe! First time, I followed the recipe exactly even though I don't care for nutmeg. Another reviewer didn't either, but loved the muffins. Nope, I still don't like nutmeg, so the next batch got a little cinnamon, allspice, and ginger. Perfect! Also, we wanted to eat them as warm as possible, so I brushed the tops with the butter while still in the pans and then generously sprinkled the tops with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. That worked great and was much less messy than the rolling approach. My mini muffin pan makes 24 muffins and the batter filled them all with none left over. Baking only took about 12 minutes, but my oven tends to be slightly hot even with a temperature gauge inside. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the recipe!!

These were pretty good.  I do not keep margarine on hand, so I used butter.  I didn't like them much out of the oven, but I loved them after they cooled.  I also added a little cinnamon in the cupcake/doughnut.  Hubby really liked them.  My almost-4-year-old didn't eat much, but if it's not chocolate, he doesn't like it.  This may be a new Christmas morning treat for us!  Thanks for the recipe!

What?  Of course I'm not going to eat all of these addictive delicious little gems by myself! *crams one more into mouth while you're not looking*

This recipe is fabulous, Diane.  Thanks!  But because all cooks have to have the last, narcissistic word on any recipe, I will offer that a pinch of salt added to the sugar (I used superfine) in the topping is a nice offset.

I made two batches, one with all-purpose flour and one with high-gluten bread flour. Can't decide which I like best, but the texture and chewiness of the bread flour batch gained more raves from family.  For each batch I used a 1:1 combo of coconut oil and melted butter (both in the dough and for the topping).  The nutmeg is subtle, but genius in this recipe.

These were fantastic! I didn't have any nutmeg, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice, which has nutmeg in it amongst other things. My 6 yo was my taste tester and he loved them!!

These are very good and my family LOVED them! I made a double batch and there already asking if I can make more. I will say that there is to much nutmag and I love spice. Next time I will use less. And also use less butter and sugar mixture to coat them. It doesnt need all that sugar! But otherwise really good!

These muffins are divine. I am Canadian, and live very close to the Arctic circle where there are no donut shops (Tim Hortons for all those other Canadians out there!) and miss getting a tasty treat now and then. These are such a good replacement! I stuck to the recipe, used butter instead of margarine and used vanilla-flavoured soy milk.  Instead of dipping the muffins in the melted butter, I used a pastry brush so that the muffins wouldn't be to saturated. I gave them each a quick brush on the top and bottom and rolled them in the sugar and cinnamon. I doubled the batter but not the sugar and cinnmaon and I had plenty. Simply delicious!!!

Not only are these yummy but they are adorable and soooo easy.  Made them in the morning for a very small, chic baby shower brunch for a new neighbor/friend.  All the girls wanted just one--but polished off most of the plate! Thanks

Excellent!   The only thing I changed was to add a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and used butter in the batter and pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg.  Will be making these often..kids gobbled them up!

i made 22 mini muffins, they were yummy!  I did not use the whole amount of nutmeg, i only used a 1/2 tsp thinking that my kids wouldn't like the taste.  My son (an aspiring chef to be) decided to glaze his muffins with melted butter and honey!  Delish!

Bad bland gross.  It would take too much work on the recipe to make them have any flavor--have to adjust the butter to oil, add an egg, up the baking powder.  Just re-do all around.  Very disappointing.  The worst part is now I have to wash out those little muffin pans for a recipe that wasn't even worth it.  My husband, who will eat ANYTHING, agrees.  Sorry...!

Very sweet with the coating....Doubled it, but it only made 30 mini muffins. Everyone liked them, but we could not eat many b/c of the sweetness. I will probably not make these again.

just made these with my daughter.  Oh my goodness, these are so yummy!  Followed recipe exactly, but with the butter.  I will try these with half almond flour and half whilte flower next time.  I had very little cinnamon-sugar mixture left and we like that on toast anyway.  thanks for the wonderful recipe.

After making these the first time and took them to a gathering, people were asking me to make them again. I also put a vanilla glaze on them. I double the recipe and do half & half toppings.

I made these over the weekend and everyone loved them. I am definitely keeping this recipe handy. As far as people saying it does not make enough, the recipe is for mini muffins not regular ones.  If you want to make regular ones, double the recipe and it works perfect :)

My toddler had donuts at Nana and Papa's and now it's all he asks for... I don't feel so bad about these though... they do taste just like your basic cake donut... thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Thanks Dianne for an amazing recipe!  The muffins turned out great, first batch were a little crusty, 2nd batch at 350 turned out PERFECT!  Only other change I made was that I did not have nutmeg, I used Apple Pie Spice, worked for me :)

Made these today for Easter brunch and they were fabulous! Easy to make and turned out perfectly. Not a huge nutmeg fan but it wasn't too much. They absolutely do taste like little donuts. This is a keeper recipe. I made them in a four cup measuring cup so it was easier to pour into the muffin cups.

Fantastic recipe.  As per other reviews I cut back on the nutmeg and used only 1/2 teaspoon.  I also only dipped the top of the muffins in melted butter (but still rolled the whole thing in the cinnamon/sugar mixture).  These are quick to make and incredibly tasty to eat.  My mom loved them so much I had to make a batch for her.  Thanks for a great recipe.

OMG! These are delicious! Just like little donut holes but not as bad because they're baked, not fried! I found that using a basting brush and brushing the melted butter on top of the muffins before they came out of the pan helped a lot. Then I popped them all out into a gallon zip top bag and shook. I ate about 5 and sent the rest with my husband to work or I would have finished them off. I think one of my favorite things about this recipe is how easy and quick they are to make!

I've made these with applesauce instead of the butter/margarine. It comes out so good! With the nutmeg, they end up tasting like apple donuts, then the sugar or cinnamon sugar on top just adds that extra sweetness. They are very loved in this house!

These were ok. I made them exactly as the recipe was written & I found the muffin part kind of bla tasting. The sauce was the only thing that saved them & made them edible. Even still we've hardly touched them.

AMAZING! I make these often and everyone loves them! They are perfect with coffee! I followed the recipe word for word the first time and there was way too much nutmeg. So, the next time I used cinnamon instead of most of the nutmeg (about 1/2 a teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 a teaspoon nutmeg).

Really really yummy...the family gobbled them up and I even made a double batch. Next time however I will cut the nutmeg back just a tad...but that is just my own personal preference.

Awesome.  Reminds me of Dunkin D's.  I used Smart Balance Whipped for the mixture and real butter to dip (I have no margarine!).  Kids love them.  The kids wanted sprinkles on theirs and soon discovered that the cinnamon sugar were the best and sprinkles were not.  I saved this to my recipe box after the first bite!

I really like the taste of the muffin, but thought it was a little too sweet with the cinnamon sugar coating. It might have been better if the muffins were a little bigger.

when ever my boyfriend and i are bored we bake and since we found this recipe "mini muffins" are just about all we make. We both love them so much that we make at least two batches at a time! I find that i prefer to cook them a little less than 15 minutes so they have a more doughy (or doughnutty) texture.

Made these for a brunch. They were served alongside several more "sophisticated"/complicated dishes, but were by far the most popular. Everyone went back for more. The nutmeg really makes the difference.

The second batch is in the oven...that should tell you how yummy these are!  I agree with everyone else, cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tea and add cinnamon and vanilla.  Making them into mini muffins is part of the charm of these!  When out of the oven I tossed in big ziplock with spiced sugar (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, ect (from The Spice House)), shook them a bit and put them on a rack to cool.  Also topped some with glaze of powdered sugar, cinnamon and a few drops of milk.  Both are yummy, thus the reason for the 2nd batch!

This would'e been a 5 star, but to me they were too sugary on the outside.  I just halved the sugar mix & just sugared the tops of the donuts.  My family LOVED these!  Very addicting!  My second time making this I didn't have enough white flour so I used wheat flour & you couldn't taste the difference.  I will definitely do it that way from now on.

My husband MUST HAVE something sweet in the morning for breakfast.  I made these for him and his comment (many times over) was "These are delicacies!"  I did have to omit the cinnamon sugar coating because he doesn't like it but the vanilla sugar and chocolate glazes were a major hit.  Apparently his Krispy Kreme Donut Holes are out of the picture now - this is his new treat.

These are good.  I think coating them in butter and the sugar mixture was a bit much for my taste.  Next time I will probably just dip the tops and see how I like that. I really want to taste the muffin rather than the coating.  I will try these again.

Updated 10/23/10 - everyone in the house tried these.  The grown ups liked them, the kids did not.  The flavor is lovely but coating them entirely in butter/sugar/cinnamon is overkill.  Next time I will only dip the tops and let the nutmeg flavor be the star.  Nice recipe

These are the best in the morning with coffee. I have made them 6 times in 3 weeks! My neighbors and my husband can't get enough! The only change I made is; I used 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg instead of 3/4 teaspoon. It was perfect!

Wow, these were yummy!  I chose to make them b/c they were simple and I had the ingredients readily available.  They were quick.  And they were gone quick too!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.

They were very good and the small mini muffin size is dangerous. You just keep munching. When I made them today they didn't brown evenly in the oven but that could be due to our weather here.  One you dip them in the butter/sugar mixture they look nice. Will be making these again!

These  muffins were great. I did get 20 mini muffins out of the recipe, so I thought I did pretty good. Mine took only 12 minutes to bake. I am usually very careful not to overbake my cake/muffins,etc .I thought the ingredient proportions were just right. I did cut back on the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp as someone had suggested. Definately will make again! Thanks Dianne :)

These are so good!  I quadrupled this recipe for a family get-together and ended up having to whip up another quadruple batch halfway through because we ran out.  These taste just like mini doughnuts!  I followed the recipe to a T and they were just perfect.

This recipe was great! My kids ate them all up in one night! I did add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and vanilla extract since some reviews said that the muffins were bland. I also reduced the amount of nutmeg. I agree that if I put the 3/4 teaspoon it would have ruined the whole thing! I will surely save this one to make again. It's the perfect little spice cake! You can have it for breakfast or dessert that's why I love them so much.

Followed exactly to the recipe minus the mini part....only because I only had a regular muffin pan.  These were EXCELLENT....even being a little bigger than they would have been still came out great.  Taste just like a sugar donut and so easy to make.  I say stick to the recipe, no need to change it.

Made these today!! They were so fantastic. Had just enough batter for the 24 mini muffins with none left over. Gave some to neighbors for them to taste.  They loved them.  Next time I will use some apple pie spice to try that out.  These are so GOOD!!

I have not tried these yet bue will soon. Looks like alot of happy customers. i have one thing to say about a review. Nutmeg could be a powerful spice!! When i use it, especially fresh grated, I always use 1/3 of what the recipe calls for. It is one of those spices that you like or dont like. I do have to say also that the plain donuts at dunkin donuts, nutmeg is the sutile ingredient. So next time you have one. you will see....

Simple, super easy and of course DELISH!  Be sure not to over bake - which is very easy to do with the mini muffin tins.

These were so easy and kids loved them! I might put a little less nutmeg next time. Rolled in cinnamon and sugar, and for the kids I dipped them in vanilla glaze and added sprinkles! Yummy! They were gone quickly

Way too sweet and almost all of them stuck to the muffin pan. They didn't taste like donuts, maybe more like a coffee cake. Probably will not make again.

Dense and not really tasty.... My children (who generally love ANYTHING with sugar) said it tasted like noodles.  I think maybe an egg would have helped?

I doubled the recipe and made twelve regular sized muffins. I didn't end up doubling the topping though and had enough for the twelve muffins.  These were easy to prepare and great for when you're out of eggs.

I doubled the recipe, but did not double the nutmeg to make 12 normal sized duffins. I baked for 22 minutes.   Instead of cinnamon for the topping I used apple pie spice for 6 of them and pumpkin pie spice for 6 of them. Very yummy with a glass of milk!!!

These are oh so yummy!  I tried them right of the oven and they are okay but once they have cooled all the way they are fantastic.  Definately going to add this one to my permanent recipe box.  I actually had to use pumpkin spice instead of the nutmeg because I didn't have nutmeg.  Yummy!!!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

These are awsome!! I made them in a mini bunt pant to make them more like donuts. I didnt want to dip them in butter, so instead I sprayed them with a little fat free cooking spray and them shook them in the cinnamon and sugar. I also covered some with powdered sugar. Yumm!!!

This recipes is so good.  I loved it. I did tweak it some, i added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice to both the muffin and the coating. Made them into a spiced muffin. This is a great recipe for the fall time.

These were good.  I think they would have tasted better had I not been expecting it to taste like donuts - which it does not.  It takes like a sugar coated muffin...probably won't make again.

Simple and delicious! Next time I think I'll skip the part where you dip them in the melted margarine...too many calories and I think they would be just as good if just dipped in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Everyone loved them, this one is a keeper!

These were really good, they are similar to a mini donut definitely, but not a substitute in my books. They are more like a snickerdoodle if anything.  I will make again though as they are incredibly easy and require basically all hands on ingredients, I will not dip in melted margerine next time as they made them kind of soggy and I really tasted the margerine over sugar mixture.

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make and the flavor is fantastic. These smell so amazing I almost couldn't wait for them to cool to try one. I did make a few modifications to make the recipe more healthy though:  Substitute all whole-wheat flour for all purpose flour. Substitute sugar free applesauce for margarine in muffins, reduce white sugar in muffins to 1/3 cup. Brush with olive oil instead of margarine and reduce sugar topping to 1/8 cup (and you probably won't even use that much - I didn't!)

Great recipe! VERY YUMMY and perfect little size for a sweet treat without feeling too guilty! I did add a ew things: 1 egg,  1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also baked mine in paper baking cups (I couldnt resist the cute mini cups I found!)  Even with just the tops coated with the cinnamon suger, theyre still very YUMMY! great recipe, this ones a keeper.

These were delicious and easy enough for the kiddos to help. I'm rating this 4 stars only because you will need more than 1/4 c. margarine/butter to dip the baked muffins. I had to melt 3 more Tbs. On those last 3 Tbs, I subbed Smart Balance and it worked just as well, so next time I will sub that for the butter completely. Great little breakfast treat!

Sooo tasty!!! I whipped these up a couple nights ago and there are none left! I did follow other readers and cut down on the nutmeg. I did also double the recipe and came out with only 24 muffins, but i filled the muffin tin about 3/4 of the way full. The next time I make these I will roll them in butter then only put the cinnamon and sugar mixture on the top instead of the whole thing. Came out really sugary to us. I might also try fine chopping some walnuts and put those on top. Delish recipe!!!

I tripled the recipe as another reviewer mentioned because I had to use regular sized muffin pans.  I probably only needed 2x the ingredients because my muffins were too heavy and the tops ended up breaking off resulting in crumbly donut holes.  The flavor of the recipe was fantastic.  It looks like I will need to go buy some mini muffin pans just to make this the right way.  It's THAT good.

These little muffins are really good and easy to make.  The only change i made was i cut down on the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  I could easily eat 5 or 6 and not stop.  Remind me of the cinnamon cake donuts at the cider mill.

These were quick to make and they taste awesome. I took advice to only use a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, but should have gone with the original amount. The taste of the muffin was great, but when you bite it was more of a 'memory' of what a donut tastes like (it doesn't taste like you were eating a real one, but with it being muffins it should be expected). I think maybe with the original amount of nutmeg the donut flavor would be more prominent.

LOVE these!  Though I didn't have nutmeg so I put in cinnamon and ground cloves, which was very yummy.  I also opted to make these big instead of mini, I had to triple the recipe to get 12 medium muffins.  And I only dipped the top of the muffin in the cinnamon and sugar.  I love that the outside of these were crispy (in a non-burnt way), while the inside was moist and yummy.  I will be making these often!

These muffins are pretty good.  They have the texture and taste of my favorite donut.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was expecting the lightness of a glazed donut.  Didn't quite meet that expectation but they were very good.  I only dipped the tops in butter, cinnamon mixture.  My husband LOVED them.  Next time I am going to play with the topping. Chocolate, powdered sugar, etc.  Worth the make, enjoyable.

These are terrific!  I used a wooden skewer to dunk the muffins in melted butter and then coated with cinnamon sugar.  I ended up doubling the sugar mixture to have enough.Our family loved them!  Mine made 18!

Muffin pan sizes seem to vary quite a bit... I consider my pan I use often to be regular-sized but since I used muffin cups (makes clean up a breeze) the size says "jumbo". So I got four good-sized muffins. I used nutmeg to "taste" (rather, whether the fragrance seemed to be satisfactory in the batter) and added a tablespoon of cocoa powder for a light chocolate taste. I think these would taste fine without the dipping and rolling in sugar... The doughnut flavour isn't very pronounced, but it's there. These were simple to put together, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's really just your average muffin. I would make it again though if I needed a sweet treat in a pinch.

These do not dissapoint!  I do not like the flavor of nutmeg so I decreased it to 1/4 tsp. But it is still very strong.  Next time I will elminate it or replace it with cinnamon.

Real easy to make and very delicious.  The only thing I changed, because of other reviews, was I cut back the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon.

A little messy to make but soooo worth it! Like having little mini donuts fresh out of the oven! They are healthier too since they are baked and you can roll them in low fat margarine instead of butter and the cinnamon sugar will stick just the same. This was something different and delicious, I will be making these again. Thank you Dianne!

Absolutely delicious!!  Cant believe you dont find these in the bakery. I made them for the first time and between me and the three kids we ate them all. So then i went right away and made another batch. Delicious out of the oven warm. Not sure how they would be the next day, but i dont think you would have to worry about that.  I halfed the topping recipe and it was the perfect amount.

These really did taste DELICIOUS! Even my boyfriend who isn't a big baked goods fan liked them and the first thing he said was " they taste like those cinnamon donuts!"  The only thing I changed is I cut back on the nutmeg, after reading other reviews, and I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter.   In hindsight, I really should have doubled the batter. I read reviews saying so, but I decided to just try it. I don't have mini muffin tins so I used my regular ones, and only filled them 1/3 of the way. It is just not enough of these tasty morsels! Next time I will be doubling and making them full sized ;-)  Oh ALSO, I found the easiest way for me to get them coated was to brush a little melted butter right on top while they were still in the pan, then pull them out, pop them in a ziploc bag and give them a toss in the cinnamon/sugar. They came out beautifully coated!

Yummmmy, I loved these muffins. Didn't really remind me of a donut, but a cinnamon roll. I used a 1.5 tbs scoop to portion these muffins and ended up with 16.

Very nice and so easy to chop and change to suit. Change the spices or leave them out. I left out the spices added grated lemon peel topped with lemon drizzle and voila lemon muffins....so nice to have a recipe you can easily modify.

They were pretty good. I made 6 large muffins. I unfortunately did not have any nutmeg to use, but it still was nice. The only thing was that I thought they were a bit dry and would add a very little bit more milk next time. But overall nice recipe.

These are fantastic. Very quick and easy.. I was out of milk so I had to substitute milk for condensed milk. I am sure it made my muffins a little more dense than milk but it didn't change the fact that they were so delicious and addicting. Thank you for sharing this recipe. try this recipe you won't be dissapointed.

These do taste like donut holes, even though I was skeptical.  Plus they are a lot more healthy than a fried donut.

These were really good, and very easy to make. I was a little unsure when I saw that there were no eggs or salt or baking soda in the ingredient list, but these little muffins are delicious!  They do taste like doughnut, too!  This is a great recipe if you want to do some baking, but don't have a whole lot of ingredients hanging around.

The greatest thing about this recipe is that it is made with "normal" pantry ingredients and can be put together quickly before work and school.  I made these this morning, and my kids were in heaven.  They all loved them.  This recipe also gave me a good excuse to finally purchase a mini muffin pan.  I have been wanting one, and when I saw this recipe, I went out and bought one.  It makes the perfect bite-sized treat.  My kids requested that I make another batch for their after-school snacks.  Thanks!

Loved these!  They were fast and easy to make.  The only thing I noticed was they seemed to soak up a lot of margarine when I was rolling them prior to adding the sugar coating.  A 1/4 cup was not enough for the 20 muffins the recipe yielded. UPDATE: I made another batch and this time I rolled the muffins in a thin powder sugar and water icing.  They were perfect.

these were great!  I replaced the ground nutmeg with grated fresh nutmeg (about 10 scrapes over the grater) and followed the simple recipe to the end.  Cake donuts are my favorite and these are every bit as good as a cake donut hole.  The next batch I'll glaze and I'll also try dusting with powdered sugar.  This is definitely a keeper!

i just got done making these for breakfast..... and oh wow so yummy! i cut back on the nutmeg because it isn't my favorite spice but i still wanted to add a little for some flavor, also i just quickly dunked the tops of the muffins in the butter not the whole thing and then rolled it in sugar and it still stuck to the muffin! i guess its a good way to cut a little fat in these oh so bad for you muffins!

Wow!  Mini muffins, big taste, very addictive! The first batch of these I screwed up and even as "rejects"  my kids were eating these as fast as I could dip them.  My second batch (in the picture) turned out perfectly.  These literally took a whole five minutes to throw together and it took 15 minutes in my oven.  I followed the directions and used the Wilton Silicone Mini Muffin Pans filled 3/4 full and got 16 perfect muffins.  I only dipped the tops in real butter and put them in a bag filled with the cinnamon sugar mix and this worked great.  Just for the record, I am not a huge nutmeg fan but loved it in these muffins.  Thanks for sharing, Dianne!!

So yummy!  We have to double the batch.  We also skip the extra butter and cinnamon/sugar mix.  We roll them in powdered sugar after they have cooled a bit and they taste just like powdered donuts!!  We didn't like the nutmeg so much when we used the cinn/sugar topping, but with the powdered sugar it was perfect.

Good.  I'm not sure they tasted exactly like a donut but they were good.  Ireplaced the nutmeg with cinnamon.
2nd Review-I made these again and covered in icing and rolled peanuts for a "peanut donut".  Excellent!

They taste exactly like their name.  I made half with the butter, sugar, cinnamon and then the other half I rolled in powered sugar.  I definitely prefered the one that the recipe states.  Not to mention they are EASY!

I am giving these 4 stars because my son ate so many of them.  I guess I was expecting a lot more due to all the rave reviews.  There were very easy and pantry friendly but I felt the flavor was just off a little bit.  I followed the recipe exactly except I sprinkled the tops with the cinnamon/sugar blend instead of dipping them in margarine and rolling.  I am not sure I will make these again.

I made this recipe, because I had seen a similar version on TV, made "only" at a famous restaurant in New York. My husband is not a "bread" lover and after eating one bite, couldn't stop raving about them.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe, it's perfect. I also told my husband "NO, we will not be opening a doughnut muffin shop".

These are fantastic!  I've made them both as normal sized muffins (makes 6), as bigger mini muffins (12) and as little mini muffins (24) and they're all great.  I only use 1/2 t nutmeg because I'm not a big fan of it in excess.  That amount works well for this recipe though.  The muffins are great warm, room temperature, and even the next day if they make it that long.  These muffins are so easy to make and are an extra special treat I like to surprise my husband with some mornings :)  The only thing I'd like to note is that I've found 10 minutes to be spot on if you make 24 mini muffins (like what the recipe submitter says to do in her review) and 15-20 minutes will probably give you burned muffins, so keep an eye on them.

REALLY goood! Although I don't like the name; "muffins" has a healthy connotation. I made these exactly, except it gave me 16 baby cupcakes. Next time I'll double it! Super easy, delicious, and look impressive!

Beyond belief delish. The only thing I did different was I brushed margarine on the tops and then rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture. This did cut down on the calories and they were still really good but the ones that I did dip and then roll tasted more like donuts and were soo yummy.

My 31/2 year old son and I just made a batch of these, so yummy. My son really like dipping the tops in the butter and sugar. They taste just like those little donuts you get at the fair, only the texture is better. Thank you so much for this recipe.

AMAZING!!! they taste just like tim hortins timbits! i have never had anything with nutmeg in so i only putjust over 1/2 tsp in and filled my mini muffin tins to the top to make sure i got a good muffin top on it since that is always the best part of the muffin. i also loaded on the cinnamon mixture before baking minus the butter so i didnt had to dip them after they came out and mine only needed to be baked for 13 min

Really good. This recipe makes 24 mini muffins, not 12 (Pampered Chef pan and small Pampered Chef scoop).  You only need to bake for 12 minutes.   I used 1/2 cup butter to roll them in.  Let them cool really well.  Then roll in butter, put in a paper bag with sugar/cinnamon mix and lightly toss-the butter absorbs into the paper bag so they're not too greasy.

As soon as I tasted the first muffin, I started all over again and made a second batch.  They're that good!  I made them dairy-free for allergy reasons by subbing almond milk for regular milk and using dairy-free margarine.  So delicious!

Very good.  We did not have any nutmeg on hand so we used Pampered Chef Cinnamon plus blend and these were so good.  Next time I will try with the nutmeg, but if I still don't have any that will be ok too.  We enjoyed making these and will be making again soon.

THE BEST! A+!!!! Loved this recipe. Simple, fool-proof and takes literally no time! I ate, and ate, and ate these all day yesterday. Gone in a few minutes. They taste great right out of the oven. Put the sugar (and cinnamon if you wish) in a brown bag and put the hot donut muffins in the bag, give it a shake- dump them into a plate and they will be gone in seconds. So yummy and tender. My recommendation: Add more nutmeg than suggested- about twice as much as recommended as this is what gives the donuts much flavor. Without the strong nutmeg taste- it kinda just taste like cake muffins. Thanks SO MUCH for this recipe! Will use again and again. BTW, this is a good one for potlucks too! :)

These are great! I didn't have any nutmeg, so I used cinnamon as a substitute and it was great. I didn't fill each muffin cup to the top and I got 24 out of the batch, and they were still wonderful. My husband and I found that they were way too sugary when we rolled the entire muffins in butter and the sugar/cinnamon mixture, so we started just dipping the muffin tops instead. Additionally, I made a chocolate sauce (1 C. chocolate chips, 1 C. butter, melted and mixed together, then added 1/4 C. heavy whipping cream) to simulate a real chocolate-glazed donut. It's a great sauce and cools/firms nicely on the muffins.

First off I do not have mini muffin tins, so I used my regular muffin pan, which I am sure makes all the difference in the world. You need the buttery cinnamon sugary flavor in each bite otherwise these are just plain muffins. I also wanted to let reviewers know that I subbed canola oil for the butter in the batter and my muffins turned out fine. I doubled the recipe, but only added 3/4 tsp of nutmeg do to what other reviewers said, and I wish I had used the whole amount. But, I will try these again when I have a mini muffin tin to see if that will make it a 5 star recipe. EDIT: I have been drizzling these with maple syrup and then microwaving for 15 seconds. Taste similar to a coffee cake. Yum!

This is such a perfect recipe,  like others commented, the only thing I would do differently is make way more of them. I was able to get 24 mini "two bite" muffins using my mini muffin trays.  These were an absolute hit.  I posted a picture of my batch with a link to your recipe on the Food Network Canada (photo gallery, community).  Everyone was wowed!  It even got chosen as pic of the week!  Thanks Dianne, for sharing this recipe.

There are not to bad. I added 1/2tsp of nutmeg instead of the full amount and that was just enough. My room mates thought they were great, I thought they were okay.

OMG!!!! Delicious beyond belief!! I absolutely tried this recipe on a fluke solely becuase I ran across it on the site and happen to have all the ingredients needed... well definitely a great surprise!!!!! I ate 2 of these little things before I could even get the cinnamon-sugar on it! I will say for next time that I will decrease the nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp. but thats just a personal preferance. And I didnt have a 'mini' muffin pan I only have the 12-cup regular one and I filled each cup half full and still baked for 15 min and they came out PERFECT! SOO EASY and  SOOO GOOD!

We loved these!  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, and they were delicious - not too much nutmeg at all. Next time I will experiment a little, and try adding vanilla, and maybe try them without dipping in melted butter after baking (just to try to save a few calories, so it will be a little more guiltfree). Thanks so much for sharing.

These are really yummy.  I used margarine and I didn't have nutmeg by itself so I used some mixed spice instead.  I don't think I was dipping them well enough because the last few were a little gooey.  My only change was to use less sugar, they were quite sweet for me.

AMAZING. I love these muffins! SO easy to make and super tasty! Mine didn't turn out bland at all! I didn't use nutmeg, though. I used cinnamon instead. Doubled the recipe and got 16 decent sized muffins. I will be making these again.. and again. Maybe next time I'll play around with it a little bit (like adding choco chips and vanilla extract). Thanks so much for the superb recipe!

these were so yummy. I couldn't stop eating them. I was able to get 18 mini muffins. Next time I will double the recipe since they were gone in in less time than it took to make them!The kids are already asking for me to make more! Thank for the recipe.

These do really taste like donuts.  They came out a little heavy and the nutmeg was a bit much for me.  Tasty but I am not sure if I would make them again.

This is awesome!  Easy, with ingredients right on hand.  Did sub cinnamon for most of the nutmeg.  Just a sprinkle of nutmeg.  And, rolled the warm muffins in a sugar/cinnamon mix.  They are really, really yummy.  My kitchen still smells so good!

I love this simple but tasty recipe because you have all the ingredients on hand.  I used butter and it was fine.  I noticed the later remarks from the submitter that this actually makes 24 mini muffins (You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin.)  I am not a lover of nutmeg but I did not find the flavor overwhelming.

The words from my not that easy to please daughter were, "These are so good, oh my Gosh".  We all loved them.
