I added minced clove of garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp chili pwd & 1/16 tsp red pepper (avoid if you don't like heat).  I also added 2 tsps of chicken base (I love Minor's.  When the soup was done, I removed 3 cups and pureed with my immersion blender then returned to the soup.  Excellent results

Very quick and easy, but is lacking any SPICES!  It needs some chili powder, cumin, red pepper!

My husband and I both love this recipe, but I made quite a few changes.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I added 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves to the recipe, chopped into very small pieces (pinto-bean size).  I sauteed the onion & bell peppers along with 3 minced garlic cloves over medium-high heat in 2 tablespoons oil, and added the raw chicken when the veggies were tender.  When the chicken was done, I added 2 1/2 cups water, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and ONE 15-oz. can of each of the following: diced tomatoes, refried beans (as one reader suggested), navy beans (drained), pinto beans (drained), and light red kidney beans (drained).  I brought the whole mixture to a boil, then turned the heat down to low, covered and simmered for 30 minutes.  We wouldn't have liked it without the chicken, but now it's one of our favorite soups!

I make this and my family loves it.  I call it Fiesta Chili - I add more seasonings and sometimes chicken as stated in another review.  You can do it hot or mild adding cummin, garlic, chili powder, jalapeno or other green, yellow or red pepper along with the bell peppers, and a handfull of frozen corn.  It really looks nice and colorful and tastes like a fajita in a bowl.  If you want to make it richer add a can of cream of chicken soup to the stock.  You can also cut down on the sodium if you cook the dry beans instead of adding canned. You can top it with sour cream and/or shredded cheese and scoop it using corn chips as a spoon.

This soup has great flavor and it is so easy to prepare. My husband loved it. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream, grated cheddar cheese and green onions. Wonderful!!!

Yummy soup! (although I used dry beans and over cooked the kidneys and black beans, and slightly undercooked the pintos... arrrgghhh) This soup is yummy just the way it is... however, I added spices to it anyway.. (hubby is a spice hog.. ;p ) I followed others suggestions and added cumin, chili powder, cayenne, a bay leaf, garlic cloves, oregano, red pepper flakes (also, I didn't have a green bell, so I used an orange, yellow and red bell pepper... topped with cilantro and wedges of lime... and served it with cornbread.. mmmmmm  Thanks for a really good recipe.

We increased the ingredients to serve 60 at a church meal and made it spicy! Worked wonderfully for us:  simple, nutritious and satisfying. I give it only 4 stars because recipe did not call for spices (chili powder and cumin), which really made it delicious. Could easily be made vegetarian by substituting vegetable stock. Very well received.

I tried this last night and it turned out great! I did dice up about a pound of pork and browned it with the onion & bell pepper. I also used pinto beans with jalepenos in them - YUM. Also served it with cornbread. VERY GOOD RECIPE

As it has been mentioned in other reviews, this recipes has no spices in it so use it as a base/ starting point to work with- be creative- use different spices to create "character" for your soup

Great base recipe, prob. good as is to feed picky people or children.  I added my own spices (1 tablespoon of chili powder plus one teaspoon cumin), which hit the spot on this wintry evening.  I also pureed the softened vegetables (with the tomatoes).  Those changes made the broth sing!

I served this over rice with cheddar on top. It was great!  The only reason that I did not give 5 stars was it was lacking spices which I added myself....cumin, chili powder, ceyenne, season salt, and garlic powder (a little of each)

This soup is just the best year round, but mostly during winter and spring on cold and rainy nights :) The only difference between how i make it and how its listed is that i use fresh beans, and it makes a little difference, but not enough to brag about! However my home smells of delicious beans all day long and it makes the soup THAT MUCH BETTER :)

This would have been a 3-star recipe, but it gets 4 just because it was so unbelievably easy and fairly tasty for so little work. I think this would be good sprinkled with cheddar and served with tortilla chips. I had it with some pita bread and it was good. Needed a little salt, but that's easily fixable. Thanks for a good, easy recipe!

Super quick and easy meal- perfect for weeknights. Definitely add some spices- I threw in a bunch of minced garlic, cumin, cayenne, tumeric, and paprika in with the onions and pepper, and it was amazing! Makes quite a bit too- we'll have enough for a few days. And if you used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, it'd be vegan.

I substituted a can of refried beans for one of the cans of kidney beans and added cummen, chili powder, chili pepper as well as 4 cloves of crushed garlic. Topped it off with grated cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions. Very good, I will be making this again.

Sadly (or maybe not), one of the best soups I've ever made in my entire life. You know it's good when the 17 month old is going "MMMM...MMMM..." while he's eating! My husband and 9 year old raved about the soup , my husband even begging I make this again and again. 

Following suggestions here, I sautéed the onions and 3 cloves of garlic before added the rest of the  ingredients. I added 1 tsp of cumin and a few generous shakes of smoked paprika, used orange and yellow bell peppers, added 1 can cream of chicken (+1 can water), and accidentally added 1 tbsp of chicken base. The soup got very salty with that mistake so I served with rice, which balanced the saltiness perfectly. I would use 1tsp next time. Blending some of the soup, as one reviewer suggested, and adding it back to the rest makes a huge difference. Definitely recommend that technique. 

Thanks for all the reviewer suggestion guys; I was the dinner super hero tonight! This one is a keeper.

Great soup.  I added some fresh garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp chili powder and a can of refried beans. "souper" easy and delicious!
