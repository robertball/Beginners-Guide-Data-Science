made this punch for a dinner party and it was a hit! even though I had to replace half the sorbet with a bag of frozen raspberries, because the store had run out. I made several pitchers. When it was gone everyone was begging for more.

I served this wonderful concoction for a bridal shower of 15 women. Everyone was wild about it and I had to make another punch bowl full. A real hit!

I personally didn't care for this (way too sweet for my taste) but I made this for a group of folks at Christmas and they all RAVED about it.  Two of the girls went home with the recipe and made it for parties they were having over the holidays.  They are STILL talking about how good it is.

I initially liked this a lot better with Sprite instead of ginger ale, but have since discovered that the soda and the sherbert aren't necessary ingredients at all. Use about 2/3 sweet red wine with 1/3 spumante champagne to make a wonderful punch by itself.

I made this for a baby shower.  It was the only thing people drank!  I sent everyone home with bottles of soda and wine.  Not a drop of the punch was left!  The best part was when we caught the  mom-to-be drinking it - She didn't realize it was alcoholic!  :)

This punch was fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  It made me a little tipsy though!  I only used 1 bottle of Asti Spumante because that's all my punch bowl could hold after I added everything else.  Would highly recommend.

This punch was a hit!  I accidently put in strawberry sorbet, but the bits of berry were wonderful.  You've gotta try it! I'll make it again. Thank you!

Made as is! It was the hit of the party! SUPER easy!  I would say the serving is accurate. I made a double batch for 18 ladies and it was too much. i'm freezing the rest and will use for Christmas this year!

I made this for my daughter's murder mystery dinner party. I don't usually drink alcohol, so I wasn't sure if it would taste good. Everyone loved it. For the Champagne, I used a bottle of Asti from Trader Joes, and 2 of their sparkling red wines. It was delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I made two batches of this for my mom's retirement party (about 30-40 people) and all of it was gone before the party ended. We couldn't find raspberry sherbet and used rainbow instead, which still turned out great.  It's a really nice balance of flavors between the ingredients to make it sweet, but not overly so.

This was really good! We were surprised at how long the sherbet kept it cold! It looked really pretty in the punch bowl too!

I wasted wine and champagne to make this. I was really excited and eager to make this recipe because it sounded so good. But I was extremely dissappointed when I sampled some. Try a different recipe!!!!

We made this punch exactly like the recipe says and our guests raved about it. We went through two batches in no time! We floated frozen strawberries and fresh lemon slices on top. I will definitely be using this one again!

Made this for a holiday party and it was a huge hit - had to make a second batch! After reading reviews, I went with a brut champagne and a light, but not sweet, red wine and it turned out perfectly - just the right amount of sweetness from the sherbet!

This review is long overdue, but I made this for Memorial Day Weekend last year--it tasted absolutely amazing! I used a bottle of red wine (don't remember what kind, but it was definitely not sweet) and also threw in a bunch of frozen berries to keep the punch cold. I think the sherbet and berries were enough to sweeten up the drink, and eating the alcohol-infused berries later on was a nice treat. I plan on making it again this year!
