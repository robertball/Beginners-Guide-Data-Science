Really nothing special.  I think the ingredients together had potential, but the dish would be better done on the stove top.  Next time I'll brown the chicken, add the wine, then sautee the onions / mushrooms along with it.  I'd add the soup / sour cream mixture afterwords and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through.

This recipe was a huge success at a dinner party that hosted.  My husband and I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers.  I premade the sauce, so that when my guest arrived all I had to do was combine it with the chicken and cook.

One month left until my girls' dance recital and my part time job at the studio ends for the summer! Until then, I have to rely on easy and quick dinners. This hit the spot Jacki! This recipe is fast and really good. I took Darla's advice and used sherry instead of wine. I love sherry in dishes and this was no exception. Thanks a heap!

Hate to be the first to give a negative review - - the wine / chicken flavor was good, but served over rice, it just didn't do it for us.  DEFINITELY better once it sits a while and cools off.  Although it was very easy and all ingredients were readily available, I won't make this one again.  Sorry

FANTASTIC!!! We made the following changes to feed our family of four. We reduced it to 6 chicken breasts but kept the ingredients the same. We sauted the onion and threw it and the mushrooms (canned) right in with the sauce that I whisked together cold and set aside.  We pre cooked the chicken to about 2/3 done in a chicken fryer. then put it all together in a 9x13 as specified and baked 400 for 30 min.  We served it over whole wheat penne pasta. So it was a pasta dish! We all had more than enough and their were leftovers!

Great recipe!  I used sherry instead of wine - like others suggested.  I also used a red onion and spread it in the bottom of the pan, loaded on my favorite seasonings, put the chicken on next, then topped with the mushrooms.  I then covered with the sauce and baked.  I only used 4 chicken breasts - that way there was a ton of "gravy" so I could serve all in crusty bread bowls.

The whole family really liked this recipe.  I did use sherry instead of white wine which was fantastic!  Usually when I cook a recipe that uses sherry my kids won't touch it but this one they devoured! Thanks a million :)

Cut the chicken breasts large chunks to cook quicker.  Sauted the onions and mushrooms before adding them.  This was tasty the first day, and even better when reheated the next day.  Great over noodles, rice or spaetzle.  My husband thinks this would make a great dish to try in a larger quantity (next church lunch), using chicken tenders.

Great recipe! So tasty! I have a convection oven, so I knew that mine would cook up MUCH faster then this recipe said. So, I added the onions and mushroms right away. I'm glad I did, cuz within about 25-30mins, my chicken was cooked. I served this over buttered egg noodles. YUM! :)

I split the breasts in half again and cooked it with the sauce for 30 minutes and then only 20 minutes with the onion and mushrooms. This was plenty of time.  Chicken was delicious. Next time I would add more mushrooms.

i thought this recipe was good!  I would use less onion next time it was kind of overpowering.  My roomate made the suggestion to use vegetables plus the mushrooms.

Loved this!!  Had to make a couple of substitutions; didn't have sour cream so I used alfredo sauce, mixed white wine with marsala, and used a package of onion soup mix because I didn't have an onion.  So easy and so good!  We will be having this one often.

I have made this twice now and I love it. I put some rice in a bowl then pour the soup mixture and a chicken breast on top. You can use low fat cream of chicken and mushroom and it still turns out just as great! I also used cooking sherry and love the taste! It can't be beat!

Very good and easy to make!  I made it tonight and my fiance had seconds!  I did not have cream of mushroom so substituted it with cream of celery. I also added more spices to the chicken such as basil, lemon pepper, and parsley.  Also, I thought one onion was a little too much and will use half or a small onion next time.

I was looking for something simple based off what we had in the house. We loved this chicken recipe! I know some people said it wasn’t but we found it very flavorful. I skipped the mushrooms since myself and daughter don’t like them - but kept everything else the same. We all enjoyed this and husband and daughter were asking me to make this again soon!

This was pretty good.  Not one I'm used to.  It was alittle tangy.  I'm not sure if that was the wine or the sour cream.  It was ok over all

We recently had a Cream Chicken Cookoff Marathon at our house. This one faired well. For the sake of my family's areteries I used low fat and reduced fat and sodium ingredients.

Delicious: some minor changes- I sauted red onion in olive oil before placing it under the chicken.  I substituted cream of celery for the mushroom; and using fat free sour cream and soups tasted great w/o the fat.  A little less sherry for my taste, but SO GOOD!!! A keeper!

Wow!  That was awesome!  I was going to save half for the next day, but couldn't resist devouring the entire thing.  What a recipe!

Very easy to prepare. I served with brown rice and green beans. The kids loved it. I found that the flavor mellowed and the dish was much better the next day--will prepare a day ahead next time.

This recipe was good, although I wold have added the onion at the start as they weren't cooked enough.  Also the cooking time for the chicken was too long so they it was slightly overcooked at the end, so cut down on the cooking time.

Easy. Tasty. Common ingredients. Low-carb. WINNER! Even better the second day. I tasted it over rice -- delicious! -- but ate the sauce on toasted low-carb bread which was tasty as well. This one's a keeper with such ease of preparation. Very tasty too. Thanks a million!

Pretty good, but unfortunately my chicken was overcooked, perhaps check the chicken when you're about to add the mushrooms/onion after 40 mins. The sauce was yummy. I marinated the chicken with the garlic powder, poultry seasoning,salt/pepper AND some oregano- which adds even more flavour to the sauce.
