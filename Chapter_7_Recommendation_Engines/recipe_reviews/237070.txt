The sweet potato and seasonings compliment the lentils! Instead of the wrap you suggested, I made tortillas to put the mixture into.  This was the 2nd time I made the recipe, and hope to have it many more times!

I loved these! Any people thought that they were so fancy when they were relatively easy to prepare. I cut out some of the spices that I didn't have (like ginger), but for the most part I followed the recipe to a tee. The only note I'd like to make is I wasn't quite sure when to add the apricots because they were mentioned in the ingredients but not the directions. Maybe I just lack cooking intuition, but I ended up just making my apricots my "during cooking" snack instead of an ingredient in my samosas. All in all I loved them and will definitely be making them for a party!
