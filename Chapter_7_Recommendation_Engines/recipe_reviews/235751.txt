I don't know what went wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly. The dropped cookies melted into one giant crunchy sheet of gross. My teenager wouldn't even eat it. I tried to be creative and present it as chocolate bark, but no one fell for it.

Tried these tonight and they were super easy & yummy! Great for gluten-free diets since there is no flour. I added a pinch of salt and splash of vanilla to pull all the flavors together. I used half nutella and half peanut butter. Be sure to leave enough room between the cookies since they expand quite a bit. Will definitely make these again!

Taste great.   Way too much egg? No flour?  Not cookies. Flat dark brown pan huggers.  Will try to pass this off as chocolate nutella bark.   Shall see who eats it

It was terrible! I don't know what went wrong but they turned out to be these flat crispy chocolate rounds. 8-10 minutes is WAY too long on 350.

Total disaster. Didn't puff up at all, melted into large pieces of flat nothing.

VERY EASY AND WELL LIKED!  THE ONLY ADDITION WAS A 1/2t SALT.  IT BROUGHT OUT THE HAZELNUT BETTER AND CUT THE SWEETNESS A TAD.
