I had to use whole wheat bread only because I did not have rye. The mayonnaise I used was reduced fat. I made no other changes. I did cook the sandwiches in the cast iron skillet. Each sandwich needed more butter than what was called for, I like to butter the whole piece not just schmear a bit and call it good. All of the boys thought that there was WAY too much chilies in this sandwich--I did not try it myself, I'm going on their reactions. They liked the sandwich, though. I will make this again but I will cut the green chilies back next time and maybe up the mayonnaise and mustard.

Very good sandwich - I wasn't crazy about the green chilies for some reason but I loved the roast beef and swiss grilled.  I made mine on rye and my husband's on white.

This recipewas enjoyable and easy to make. However, it seemed to be missing something. Maybe it needed something fresh in it or on the side aswell.

Very tasty and extremely easy!  Loved these for a different twist on sandwiches.  The only change I made was to substitute the swiss for provolone.  Thanks!

Very good sandwich. I only made two so I cut back on the recipe, just kind of eyeballed the mayo and mustard and used half a 4oz can of green chiles. I never have rye bread so used whole wheat and was out of swiss so used peperjack (I think the pepperjack was nice with the green chiles). Yummmy!! I wish I had more roast beef so I could make another one!!

These were pretty good, but I like a ham & swiss combo better, but this is certainly a good thing to make if I have sliced roast beef around.  Since "thin slices" isn't real definitive I used about 1 oz per sandwich.  Couldn't handle the idea of chilies on a sandwich but I added a bit of the convenient powdered stuff in w/the mayo to get the kick.  And I believe I used a 5 grain bread.  And it was working for me like this, so I didn't even try the salsa.

Really yummy!  The salsa would have been great with this too if I had any.  Great mix of flavors.  Thanks!

I used jalape√±o cheddar bread so I omitted the chilies and added grilled onions.  I think the onions is what really makes this sandwich so I couldn't rate it better.

These were really good and easy sandwiches to make.  We skipped the green chiles though.

I made these for a small meeting at my home, using a swirled pumpernickel-rye bread and everyone loved it!  Nobody felt the need to dip it in salsa - they said it was great just as is - I'll definately be making these again, thanks!
