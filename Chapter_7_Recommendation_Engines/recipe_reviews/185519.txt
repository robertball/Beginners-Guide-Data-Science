Great recipe! I grew up with my mother making wonton soup on cold days.  One tip I can offer is boiling the wontons separately from the broth in just plain water, 3-5 min. The reason being, the wonton wrappers are dusted with flour and it can cloud the broth or slightly thicken it.  Wonton broth is supposed to be clear and thin. After boiling the wontons strain and add to the soup. If you want a more filling meal you can add egg noodles (refrigerated section of asian market) to the dish for wonton noodle soup. Boil noodles separately as well then add to soup. A little more work but so worth it!

Absolutely wonderful. I altered the recipe a little b/c I didn't have all the ingredients, but it was still fantastic. This is also a wonderful base recipe, as you can add more vegetables or seasoning to get exactly what you want. The ONLY thing is, the recipe itself makes A LOT, and I would actually suggest halving it. oh, and if anyone is reluctant to try this b/c making wontons sounds difficult, its really SO easy.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful treat!

From the author. I have seen a few people say they have seen this on a won ton roll wrapper. After I saw someone post this the first time I searched them out and lo and behold there was my recipe EXACT with I think one minor change.  I created this recipe from scratch and apparently the won ton company took it off of AllRecipes. It is too bad you give up all your rights to your recipes to AllRecipes once you post them. I am curious if All Recipes sold it or if anyone can just copy them? Anyhow, hope you are enjoying it :). UPDATE: for the person who said the sesame oil was too much... a few drops of sesame oil goes a very LONG way, too much sesame oil will ruin the recipe. For the entire pot of the soup just a few drops of sesame oil is all you need. Light hand with that!

Excellent! I love this soup, it's my new favorite!  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand:  I used mild Italian sausage, casings removed.  Therefor, I didn't use the egg or salt and pepper (they didn't need it, sausage is bound and seasoned already). This slightly changes the flavor of the wontons, and I think I will try it again using only the ground pork.   I also halved the recipe, and further reduced the sesame oil, which I find very pungent.  I can still taste it (I'm eating this as we speak) and enjoy it, but I think the full amount might be overpowering to me.  As for assembling the wontons, here are some tips: there is a learning curve...1tbsp of filling was way too much to try to squeeze in there, I used a biggish tsp. and even then they are large to get in your mouth.   Use VERY little water to moisten the edges, or they just slide around.  Stop caring about trying to make them pretty shapes, and just do triangles if you're all thumbs like me.  For those that aren't seafood lovers, leave out the shrimp entirely instead of just not adding it to your own bowl...I can certainly taste the shrimp in the broth (which I love!).  I didn't have the peas, so I added extra greens from the bok choy.  And extra green onions.  Over all, this is a delightful dish, thanks for sharing!  PS- thank you to the reviewer who advised boiling the wontons in their own pot...BUT if you do this step, do not leave them sitting in a wire colander...they stick, lol.

Oh My!  This was good!  I did substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have the Ground Pork, but I did have bacon bits (don't laugh, it worked!!!), so I used 1/4 cup bacon (any more than that and it would have been too salty).  In other recipes I saw on other sites, the broth was made using pork bones and shrimp shells, so I wrapped the bacon in cheese cloth and steeped it in the broth for 10 minutes.  I threw my frozen shrimp in the broth to defrost and pulled it out after about 5 minutes.  I also added 1 small knob of fresh ginger, sliced into 5 pieces, and let that steep for 45 minutes.  The broth ended up having a full, rich complex flavor that is amazing.  I then ran the bacon bits through my Magic Bullet to make the pieces less chewy and it gave it a great texture.  I coarsley chopped the shrimp, put it in the green onion and bacon mixture, and kept everything else the same, except I didn't need to add salt due to the saltiness of the bacon.  I found that I could barely fit 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture onto the wonton and still fold it without tearing.  As a result, I ended up with 50 wontons!!!  I also cooked the wonton's separate from the broth, then added them when done.  This ended up being a phenomenal comfort food!  Sure it took a while to make the wontons, but I sat and listened to good music while making them so it wasn't a chore!   Thank you, Starry Night for a wonderful base that can even be modified to what's on hand.  Now, back to my soup!!!

Wow. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using Morningstar Farms burger crumbles instead of pork (please note I let them thaw and then used them just like meat). I also didn't use shrimp. The soup was amazing. I'm making my second batch tonight. The flavoring is absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was easy and amazing.My husband said it was the best won ton soup he's ever had and we live in a city with a lot of great authentic Chinese restaurants. That said I did make some changes. When making the won ton filling, I add the shrimp to the won ton instead of the broth. Just our preference and it didn't get lost in the soup. I also added some dried garlic to the filling. To the broth, I used both chicken and vegetable broth to add more flavour. I also added sliced ginger, carrots and broccoli. Next time I will add slices of BBQ pork. We also cooked separately some long noodles and added them to the bowls before adding the won ton soup. Another reviewer stated that this recipe made a lot of won tons and its true. I froze mine on parchment paper before putting them into a container. I now have them on hand to make another batch of soup quicker. Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as written except I made a half recipe and it was perfect for two as a main course with a side of Chinese ribs.  You can adjust it with different vegies but the recipe is a real keeper. MSO said it was better than we get at our favorite Chinese cafe.  Thanks  Starry Night.

I did not care for this recipe. Sesame oil was a bad thought on this recipe. We were all so excited to make this being wonton soup is my family's favorite soup. The flavors were all wrong. This recipe winds up costing more that buying it from your local restaurant. I was extremely disappointed and we will not be modifying this recipe or making it again.

This was my virgin voyage in making homemade wontons and I'm thrilled to say that this recipe was a huge hit with my family. The pound of pork made more than enough filling so I froze what was left and will use it to make egg rolls next week. Took love2cook's advice and simmered the wontons separately from the soup. Great suggestion. Thank you Starry Night for a great recipe!!

This is my first try at wontons and I had mixed success with it but I'm giving it five stars because I'm pretty sure any problems I had were operator error and it was flat out delicious no matter the glitches.  I first fried them as an appetizer with a Thai style dipping sauce.  I stuffed the wontons as full as I thought I could and still seal them but after I removed them from the hot oil either the filling had shrunk or the wonton had expanded and there was a large pocket inside the wrapper that was only half full of filling.  Still, we all loved them as an appetizer.  I next made the soup and that's what I'll probably stick to in the future.  Absolutely delicious.  I added some fresh grated ginger, a little fish sauce, and a little more tamari to the broth.  Once again I had a little issue with the wontons as they wanted to disintegrate before I was ready to serve.  Maybe I cooked them too long?  Still, I won't hesitate to make this again because the flavor combo of the cabbage, filling and seasonings was out of this world.  I am considering just turning the filling into small meatballs, browning them and adding them to the broth along with some soba noodles next time.  No matter, a great recipe!

Easy to make and super tasty.  My husband orders wonton soup with every take out chinese meal and said this had the best flavor. Makes a lot so serve a crowd or be prepared to eat it again for lunch and lunch and lunch...

Wonderful, amazing, delicious soup! The filling made 48 wontons for me, definitely using less than a tablespoon of filling per wrapper (maybe more like 1.5 teaspoons), using a little less than one 14-ounce package of wonton wrappers. Served this for dinner with some steamed edamame. I made a couple of small changes too:

(1) I left out the shrimp (my husband is allergic) and was still thrilled with the flavor. 
(2) I cooked the wontons separately in boiling water in batches, then when a batch was finished I just added it to the broth+vegetables, repeating this until all were cooked. 
(3) I found that 8 cups of broth wasn't enough for 8 servings of soup, since there were so many wontons and veggies, so I ended up just adding some extra broth until it was more like the wonton soup I'm used to. I probably added an additional 2-3 cups total. I know that seems like a lot, but the leftovers needed it especially, since the wrappers drink up some of the broth.

I will definitely be making this again!

I actually like the other recipe for wontons on this site because of the shrimp; I think that the addition of shrimp makes the wonton taste so much better.  Also adding a package of preserved mustard tubers makes it taste delicious.  Some suggestions on how to make the wontons more authentic-looking: 1. Place 1 tsp. of the meat in the center of the wrapper, 2. Place water on the edges of the wrapper, 3. Fold the bottom of the wrapper to match the edges of the top of the wrapper to form a rectangle, 4. Fold the top part of the rectangle (the part that's not wrapping the filling that's stuck together) over the filling part, 5. Turn the wrapper over so that the folded part is folded upward in the back, 6. Bring the top 2 edges of the rectangle together, and use water to stick them to each other securely. It takes me roughly 1 hour to wrap 150 wontons, but for some it may be longer or shorter.

I think this turned out fabulous.I would use less won tons though and add more water or broth.Be gentle with the cooked won tons which tear easily.

As stated by many, this recipe makes a lot.  Instead of freezing the prepared wontons, I divide the filling into three separate batches:   I prepare one batch, and freeze the other two batches in separate ziploc containers.

Sooooooooo good!  I was afraid it would be bland.  It wasn't, it was excellent!  I cooked my pork mixture first.  It didn't really specify and I had watched a few videos on, you tube, on how to wrap the won ton and they cooked it first, so I did too to be safe.  I added water chestnuts for my husband because he loves them.  Other then the water chestnuts, I did everything else by recipe and it was awesome!

this was really really good. i subbed DRIED shitake mushrooms for fresh. they are alot stronger and add much deeper flavour to the chicken broth so you can add a little less if  you go this route. also, i used napa/chinese cabbage instead of bok choy. it turned out really really delicious.

We have a favorite Chinese restaurant that we moved away from 8 years ago, and haven't found a good one since.  We loved their wonton soup.  I used to request it from my husband everytime I was sick.  Well, this has got to be it!  It is fabulous!  The only thing different is they had sliced pork in theirs.  That's it!  The only thing I am going to try different next time, is to put the wontons in at the end so they don't over cook.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This was very tasty.  I substituted ground shrimp in the wontons instead of pork, but it still had full flavor.  Better than I've had at any restaurant, and great reheated for lunch the next day.

Excellent recipe!!  DEFINITELY a keeper - the only alterations we made were pretty basic - we used 12 cups of broth rather than 8, and we had some leftover baby portabella mushrooms that we used, it called for 6, we had 9.  It was wonderful...and we'll be making it again!!  :)  THANKS for the recipe!!

!! Wonderful !! I halved recipe and only ended up making 8 wonton to go into the soup ... (4 each for hubby & I) ... outstanding flavor!  Note to self:  remember to a) make sure peas are in bite size portion and that the cook very quickly and b) cut the tails off shrimp (I forgot which made it awkard to eat).  A new family favorite!

DELICIOUS soup!  I left out the mushrooms, shrimp and snow peas as I didn't have any.  This is the first time I made wontons so I had a little difficulty folding them.  I'm still not sure if I did it right.  I watched a video on "YouTube" for extra help.  Because I had never cooked with bok choy, I wasn't even sure what it looked like.   I asked the young man in the produce  department and he helped me find it.  I should have asked him, "What part do you cook?"  LOL!  The recipe says "torn into 2-inch pieces" so I used the leaves.   I don't know if that was right either.   I read some reviews for help and saw that some were cooking their wontons separate.  I wasn't sure what to do.  My thinking was that the sausage flavors would be lost in the water that you throw away.   I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great. This soup was DELICIOUS!  Thank you Starry Night for sharing!!

Made this for the first time today and it is awesome!  Followed another reviewers advise and boiled wontons in seperate boiling water then added them to the soup.  It kept brother clear and pretty and not murky from the flour of the wonton wrapper.  Other than that I changed nothing and it turned out great (and I'm usually a tweaker).  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

A very tasty and comforting soup! I grew up eating wonton soup and I love chinese dumplings. I always use fresh ingredients and lots of freshly grated ginger. I love the ginger-y and garlic taste in my wontons and that is what I added. I always include chopped shiitake mushrooms, shrimp and water chestnuts to the meat mixture for added flavor and texture. I season with low-sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper for taste (just eye-ball, never measuring). I omitted the bread crumbs. Once I place the meat filling onto the center of the wonton wrapper, I moistened the edges of wonton wrap with water and seal the edges. I boiled them in a pot of water until they floated to the top then set them aside while I heated up my 3 cups of chicken broth. I was only serving three people so I had to cut back on the servings amount. I added sliced char siu to my soup along with some (blanched) baby bok choy. Lastly, I garnished my soup with sprinkles of chopped green onions. This is a nice balance of flavors of the wonton, veggies and the hot chicken soup. We always enjoy this hearty, delicious and comforting soup!

Perfect as is! You have to like the sesame oil or you are not going to like this recipe because the flavor definitely comes through. Next time I might throw some chopped water chestnuts in the pork mixture and then throw some bean sprouts on top just for fun.

Delicious! Very easy too. I've made this twice now with only one modification. I added about 2 tbsp of ginger (the kind you can buy in a jar) because I really like the flavor. Just be sure to mind your cooking times. When it says "let the soup simmer for 2 more minutes" after the addition of the bok choy, mushrooms and shrimp they mean it. Don't do like I did the first time and think you can leave it simmering until dinner is ready! Be sure you take it off the heat after you add in the show peas and green onions or else the bok choy, green onions and snow peas will get all mushy. The soup will still be edible but not quite as tasty and it won't present quite as nicely.

This soup is EXCELLENT.  I made some changes, but nothing significant except adding oyster sauce (1 tbsp). I used baby bok choy, oyster mushrooms, extra green onions (because I love the flavor).  I added sliced water chestnuts, used vegetable broth and chicken broth and panco crumbs. I took the advice of another and boiled the wonton's separately.  I can't rave enough about this soup!  Thank you SOOO much for posting it!

These were fantastic!  I made just a few changes...I omitted the mushrooms becaue I didn't have them.  In addition to the filling ingredients, I added about a tsp. of finely chopped fresh ginger, 1 tsp. brown sugar, and a tbs. of sherry.  After making the wontons, I boiled them in plain H2O.  I then heated up the chicken broth and added the bok choy.  Right before we were ready to eat, I added the wontons back to the soup.  I didn't add the shrimp, snow peas, extra soy or sesame oil.  This recipe really takes little effort but produces a big tasty result!

Wonderful soup! I will hold on to this recipe forever. I did omit the shrimp and snow peas and added more mushrooms. This soup honestly beat out any soup I have bought over the years. I will be making my wonton soup from now on.

This recipe is amazing, I have made it 3 times now and it is very forgiving, The first time I made it I made it as is, the second time I didn't have the veggies except for green onions and it was still amazing, Third time I made it I had everything but instead if the whole pound of pork I used a 1/2 pound and halved the seasons for the filling, It was amazing that way, This will be something I cook for the next 50 years for sure, thank you 100 times for this recipe :)

Delish!  Used kale in place of the bok choy and didn't use the snow peas cause I forgot.  Sesame oil is so delish!  We added soy sauce cause we love salt.  This is a very good soup.  Takes a bit of work but if you have the time then it's worth it.  I am lucky I have the time on my hands to make time consuming recipes.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will put this on my menu in the winter months cause we live in AZ...

Great soup, but a lot of work. I used sage sausage (on accident), and it turned out really yummy. I'll probably only be making it for really special occasions because of the time needed to fill all those wantons.

This recipe is phenomenal. Great as is and versatile enough to make changes. I added carrots, ginger, garlic and omitted the mushrooms and shrimp. The only thing I would urge is NOT to skip the sesame oil it really gives it something.

The wontons were great, BUT, the soup really needs something... I added a little ground ginger to both the wontons and the broth... it helped, but not enough to make this great.  Just "pretty good", so I probably won't make it again since it took about 2 hours.

I really liked this.  I always wanted to make my own because the soup from the stores are VERY salty.  However, I did make one change.  Instead of JUST chicken broth, I added about 2 tablespoons of MISO paste.  Gave it a really good flavor.

This is awesome soup!  I did add some chicken bullion because I like mine a bit saltier.  I also left out the shrimp but only because I have never had wonton soup with shrimp.  It does make a lot of wontons but I love them so I added them all.

Allow yourself plenty of time to make this - rolling the wontons is a slow process. A couple of NOTES: I followed the suggestions to boil the wontons in water separately, then add them to the soup once cooked.  This was a good idea, but I let my wontons sit in the colander too long & they stuck together & some tore open - Just a warning.  Also, although the recipe doesn't indicate it, I cooked my sausage on the stovetop before filling the wrappers.  It didn't seem to me that the filling would have cooked in the 5-minute boil, & I didn't want to risk raw meat.  It worked great -- I wonder if pre-cooking the sausage is a step missed in the instructions??  Overall, it's worth the labor as it's a very flavorful soup.  Only ingredient change I made was to sub 25% of the broth with beef as that's what I've seen used in Chinese restaurants.  The family LOVED it (even little ones) & I'll make it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I think it's kinda of a pain to make, but because it tastes so good I will make it again.  My mother-in-law said she would like more broth and I do agree.  I will make it with 12 cups of broth next time.  Also, I halved the sesame oil, only because of my family.  I personally love sesame oil!  Will make again, definitely.

very bland, the snow peas were hard as rocks, and the only real flavor came from the wonton filling, which is bland too.  I would not recommend this.

Loved making the wontons, didn't love the flavor. I'm thinking a little tweaking to my family's tastes won't be hard though, and we'll have to give this another try sometime soon.

I just enjoyed the Best Wonton Soup I ever ate!!!  I will be making this soup again...and often.  My son-in-law doesn't like Wonton Soup but loved this and ate 2 bowls full.  I omitted the snow peas because they weren't available at my local store but did not miss them.  Thanks for sharing this keeper.

The wontons were wonderful and the shrimp were also excellent in it.  The only thing I would change is to add the bok choy with the snow peas at the very end instead of before hand.  I like the bok choy for the crunch.  And also...the soup seemed to taste better the next day.  So for you busy people out there this is a good soup to make on a rainy sunday and to eat during your busy work week.  Wonton wrappers are in the produce section btw...it took me a couple grocery stores to figure that out!

These turned out fantastic.. I, like other users boiled my dumplings separately. I used ground turkey instead of pork or chicken and added some cayenne spice. They were super yummy, I'll probably add more veg to my soup next time. Thanks for the recipe ??

Added 1/2 can of baby shrimp to the pork stuffing, probably not necessary.  Next time, just use egg noodles and make the meat into meatballs, cook in the broth, as the wrappers mostly fell off of the meat while cooking anyway.  Note to self:  DO NOT DOUBLE.

I am new to the won ton game..but my man loves won ton soup and was bugging me to make it...I finally gave in and looked at several recipes..This one seemed easy enough..I prepared it as exactly written..I was a little skeptical but made my little won tons..which was a little time consuming but my boyfriend helped and it was fun! I boiled the won tons in water before adding them to the broth and the end product was AMAZING! I have never tasted such wonderful soup like this.It was so filling and tasted so fresh! My boyfriend thinks I'm a professional cook! Thank you starry night for sharing this recipe!

Wow!! Yummy!!! I added carrot, ginger, and a lot more broth. Also took quite a bit longer to do the wontons for me, but it seemed like the wonton wrappers that I bought were very little (about 2.5" by 2.5" box) so they held less meat in each one. If I wasn't the one that made it, I would have sworn it came from a restaurant! Will make again and again! (I  also had way too many wontons so I left a bunch out and fried them the next day as an appetizer. Delicious!!!)

This recipe was phenomenal! So easy and it was a huge hit. Before I heated up the chicken stock, I sautéed 1 tbsp each of minced garlic and ginger in 1 tbsp vegetable oil and a splash of sesame oil, then added 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions. Then I just let the broth simmer for 30-40 minutes or so. And I used 12 cups chicken broth instead of 8, because I also cooked noodles separately, and then had guests add them to their bowls before ladling the soup in. I also agree w/ other reviewers that the recipe made a ton of wontons - I definitely froze some of the wontons on a sheet pan then put them in a ziploc bag. Can't wait to make this again, it was so yummy!

My son introduced me to allrecipes.com.  I've always wanted to make my own wonton soup! Using this recipe as a guideline, I omitted the shrimp and mushrooms ( not my idea!) and added some ginger and some garlic to the broth.  Also added some slivers of carrot.  Oh, and I added mini baby bok choy, instead of the medium head of bok choy. It was delicious!

Amazing!! I made a few changes: for the wontons-  I only used half the amount of pork and green onions, added savoy cabbage (a few handfuls as I did not have bok coy), and omitted the mushrooms, snow peas and shrimp (I served it with coconut shrimp...); for the broth, I boiled the chicken broth with a few splashes of soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, garlic, and shrimp tail shells. The wontons are easy to make - they are time consuming but that's to be expected; I folded a few to save time and that method worked fine too. One additional change I made was to remove the wontons after cooking them and to stream in two beaten eggs- I love egg drop soup and with they are generally not combined, it turned out great! If you want to use all the pork mixture, I'd recommend making more broth - I used 12 cups of broth to 1/4 of the pork mixture. Overall, this is a keeper and so much better than most of the take-out places near me!

Perfect! We love this recipe as is! I do use less than a tablespoon of filling in each wrap otherwise I can't get them closed. Makes for twice the wontons but that my family's favorite part : )

I made it! I added ginger, carrots,mushroom, and watwer chesnuts to the pork mixture.. I also added oyster sauce to both the mixture and broth...

I also included a bag of stir fry veggies (carrot, broccoli, snow peas)And used Napa Cabbage instead of bok choy.. 

I had alot of fun with this recipe and loved it!! I think if I hadnt added a few things the won tons would have been a lil bland.. But seriously I bet even as is it was delicious! I loved it!

Another suggestion to freezing the soup, you can freeze the wonton's separately and then just throw them in the broth to thaw/warm them up!

Made to recipe standards. Only made half of the wontons which seem to be enough for this recipe. Froze extra sausage to make into wontons next time. I didn't find their was tons like other reviews. With 5 adults we made this our main dish with bread on the side.

This recipe was amazing!! I also halved the recipe due to the fact that I did not have any pork. I used fresh raw shrimp and bacon chopped up in a food processor together and added a little garlic as well as the other stuff the recipe calls for.  I boiled the wontons separate as other reviewers did and they came out fantastic!

I am so happy with how this turned out. I forgot to get mushrooms, so I left those out, but the recipe was still very good. Also, I added carrots for a little color, and they went well with the soup. Next time I might try adding some more flavorings to the pork filling, it was a little bland. But overall, a really good recipe.

This was missing flavor. The only flavor that stood out was the sesame . It didn't taste like authentic wonton. I did give it three stars because I think it may have promise with some tweaking. I saw alot of recipes with rice vinegar and ginger so maybe that is what was missing. Due to the amount of time involved I won't make this exact soup again, sorry.

This is VERY good.  I tweak it by eliminating the ingredients we don't like, but that's just for personal preference.  The filling is great, but be careful not to fill the wontons too full (like I did the first time).  I'm making this again tomorrow with fried rice...makes a great meal and helps to use up some leftovers too!

For my own info after making these many times now: I don't use mushrooms or shrimp.  I add a few extra snow peas and sometimes a little extra bok choy.  A 12 oz package of wonton wrappers only needs about .5 lb of pork, but I usually make a whole batch and freeze half for later.  Do as someone suggested and heat the wontons first in plain water to keep my soup nice and clear.  I only leave them in the water for ~30 seconds, then move them to the boiling broth.  I also add a lot more broth, because I like my soup "soupy."

This recipe is SO yummy. Better than at a restaurant. The only thing we changed was to use a cuisnart to blend the mix a little finer. Thank you so much for sharing. We've had it twice in two days !!!!!

I've made this several times exactly as stated minus the optional shrimp.  It is soooooo good.  Now I make it using half chicken broth and half wonton soup broth that I purchase from the asian market.  It comes in powder form in a packet.  My DH says this is better wonton soup than the restaurants.  I'd have to agree with him.

This was amazing! Wontons are a little work, but so worth it!!  I added some sliced carrots and a kaffir lime leaf (sold by Epicure).  Even a very picky 5 year old ate the wontons!! Yeah!

Oh my goodness!  This is so good!  I have two little boys, and they both love restaurant wonton soup, so I thought I would give this a try.  This soup is better than the restaurant version!  It tastes so healthy and homemade...wow!  I followed other reviewers' advice to boil the wontons separately and just added them to the broth when they were cooked.  I also did not put the mushrooms, peapods, or shrimp in the broth since it was enough of a shock for my boys just to see the bok choy in there.  I will make this again, perhaps once a week!

This was delicious and had the flavor of a Chinese restaurant soup. My family loved it! My father, who is a pro at cooking soups, raved at the recipe. I followed the directions to a tee and only added baby corn since I had them. I will make it again...when I have the time! The dish makes a lot and the won ton prep is a bit time consuming.

This was amazing.  I used chicken cubes and the paste to make the broth to my taste.  I enjoy saving money.  I used probally 12 cups of water by the time it was done.  The wontons turned out very delicious.  Not hard to make at all just time consuming.  I also used dried shitake mushrooms which gave it more of that deep earthy taste, I really was not a fan of that.  I will use traditional mushrooms next time.  I also used shrimp that made it taste yum!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Oh. My. This is delightful!  I used ground turkey to make it healthier, and ground Ezekiel toast for the crumbs. The wontons are great alone with a little soy sauce, too! This made so many, I was happy to have the extras. I cooked the wontons in water before transferring, perfect! Thanks for sharing!!

Oh my gosh this soup is amazing!  It is time consuming but worth it. I have never made wonton soup before. The filling was so good, had a lot of flavor and a little heat to it. I will definitely make it again. I followed the recipe to a tee.. Thanks for sharing!

This really is a solid recipe. It was as my husband calls it "tasty." It had a really good flavor. The reason I took one star away was for 2 reasons:

1. the wontons were really tricky to make (I may have smaller wrappers) but 1tbs was a lot for my wrappers so I just reduced it to about 1/2 tbs. They also started to tear as I was serving the soup. I cooked them in hot water before I put them in the broth which really helped make sure the broth stayed clear.

2. Also the pea's were really good at first but when we reheated the soup they got a little slimy :P. So next time we will nix the peas.

Other than those two things it was great and we will def. make it again!

Just made this soup and it tasted great! Even my 4-year old loved it (and it was simple enough he could help). Very tasty and similar to the ones I would order at a restaurant. I added minced garlic and ginger to the pork mixture, about 1.5tsp each and omitted the shrimp (not a fan of shrimp). Added some carrots to the broth and dash of kosher salt (used low sodium broth). Will definitely be making this again!

My first time making wonton soup. Wish I had known wontons turn to mush quickly. I let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes while I prepared other food. The wontons turned mushy and the filling came out of them :-( 
Also meat mixture was kind of bland.
I will probably try again, but steam the wontons separately and add them to the individual serving bowls. Also will add season salt or something to filling.

LOVED this soup!!  My husband and kids loved it as well.  I will for sure make this soup again.. it's worth the time to make the dumplings!  I did add a little more broth and used 4 cups of my homeade broth I had in the freezer. I did not add the shrimp as I made this to go with my lettuce wraps and chicken satay. I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Like the recipe submitter, I'm also not one to measure things, so I used my own amounts and added a little ginger, garlic powder and soy sauce to the chicken broth. Since I used chicken base instead of broth (which results in a cloudy broth) it likely wouldn't have mattered had I just went ahead and boiled the wontons in the broth (I boiled the wontons in water per popular review advice). I used slivered cabbage in lieu of bok choy and omitted the shrimp. It was flavorful and I'll definitely be making this again. Next time, I will decrease the sesame oil a bit and add more garlic, but overall, a very "tweakable" recipe, which is just up my alley. However, I did notice this recipe is nearly identical to the Nasoya brand wonton wrappers, so I found myself looking at the AR specifications and also looking at the directions on the Nasoya package. No matter, it's still good.  My 4 1/2 DD and I are HUGE fans of this soup. DH....not so much. I will freeze the leftover pork filling and the wontons, but separately so I'll be ready for another batch the next time the craving arises.

It was ok, there is no standard way of making wonton soup in china and each region has there own way. bread crumbs is not a normal ingredient in china, flour is often used with ground pork instead of bread crumbs.

This recipe is fantastic! I used ground turkey instead of pork to cut some calories, and omitted quite a few other ingredients because either I didn't have them on hand (like shrimp) or didn't like them. I used panko breadcrumbs, EggBeaters for the egg (helps to get that 1/2 egg serving easier) and low-sodium FF chicken broth. All I added to the broth after the wontons were in was the bok choy, and it turned out great! If you want a soup with "more stuff", definitely add the shrimp and maybe some BBQ pork.

The broth doesn't taste exactly like the stuff from the Chinese restaurant, but the wontons are spot on, even using lean turkey! I may play with the recipe a bit in the future to find that good broth flavor (beef stock, maybe?). I only made a half batch because I wasn't sure I'd like it, and it made a good 2-3 bowls of soup with plenty of wontons in each. Definitely making this one again!

The broth tastes exactly like the broth at my take out restaurant.  Thank you.  However, I'm not liking the taste of the pork.  I will use baby shrimp in my won ton wrappers next time.

This was a great soup.  It's important to note that this is a very thick soup.  The filling as made fills at least 20 wontons and we got 30 out of it.  To compensate, we added 1 more cup of chicken broth and doubled the onions and green onions..

I really liked the wontons but not the broth.  I like sesame oil a lot but for me, it was too much.  Next time I will omit it from the broth and instead work with a combination of fish sauce, majji, oyster sauce and a touch of sweetner..perhaps a splash of soy..

These were excellent.  Makes a lot of wontons. I froze the leftovers as suggested..wax paper..then put in zip lock bag. I chopped up some water chestnuts for the filling and added extra plus frozen peas to the broth. I too boiled the wontons in water first then added the amount I wanted, to the simmering broth.

Not only was this the most delicious wonton soup I have ever eaten, it was alot of fun making it. I boiled the wontons in water prior to putting them in the broth as previous reviews stated. I am looking forward to making the soup again. Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

Amazing!  I added some fresh ginger and garlic to the wontons and used 4 cups of mushroom broth and 4 cups of chicken broth.  Don't worry about how the wontons look because once they go in the soup all the imperfections go away.  This is a new favorite.

This was an awesome recipe. I/t got rave reviews from my family. I made a few changes though. I omitted the shrimp (most of my family don't eat/like it). I couldn't find snow peas so I left those out as well, but I did add water chestnuts and shredded carrots to the filling and the broth. So yummy! This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!!

Awesome recipe!  I did leave out the bok choy and the shrimp and peas and it was still amazing.  I also cut back the sesame oil significantly because I agree with another reviewer who stated that it can be overpowering. It did make a large batch of filling so I separated the remaining filling into 3 separate portions and put it in the freezer for another day. I will definitely make this again!

the BEST wonton soup i've had. Better than the chinese take-outs! Definitely a keeper. I recommend adding a cup or 2 of chicken broth coz the wontons like any pasta would absorb some of the broth after it has been cooked.  I like my soup to be soupy than thick. LOVE LOVE it!!

Our family LOVES this soup. The only thing I do differently is fry the wontons in sesame oil for a few minutes before adding them to the broth - also I omit the shrimp. The wontons are a little time consuming but all other steps are very easy. :) Thank you for sharing...this is a new family favorite!

here's what i did. i took the meat mixture and baked it in the oven like i would with meatloaf until no longer pink (but not entirely done), i was a bit leary putting raw meat in the wontons and having them cook for that little bit of time. i assembled the wontons like sandwiches instead of folding it over itself and that may have made it kind of "heavier" because once i boiled them in a seperate pot, they were almost falling apart when i scooped them out to put them into my soup. Luckily, only 1 fell apart so i was lucky they didnt ALL fall apart. We loved this soup indefinitely! what a difference from plain old chicken and dumplings :) aside from the wontons mishap, they were very flavorful and awesome! (btw, i only did 1/2 tea seasme oil, omitted the mushrooms and shrimp). will be making it again! thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Pretty delicious, and yes, it does yield quite a lot of soup! I changed a few things, including putting the shrimp inside the wontons with the ground pork, and I left out the egg and bread crumbs. I assume that those are there to keep the wonton mixture together, but it held well without them. Great flavour, great soup!

Pretty good.  Cooked wontons separately and then added to soup.  Add at very end otherwise they'll get overcooked.  Even better, keep on side and let individuals add to their own broth.  Mine got totally overcooked in the hot broth.  The 30 min. prep time is a joke!  It took FOREVER (for two of us!)  to make 60 wontons!   Also, wonton meat mixture could have used more spices as it was quite bland .. to the point that my husband complained.  Thats why 4 stars instead of 5.

So I gave this recipe 5 stars because my husband and kids loved it.  I wasn't a fan, but I've never been a fan of wonton soup.   I didn't use bok choy, or the shrimp.  But I did add a can of those chopped baby corns.   It was fun to make.

This was amazing!  I couldn't believe I made this myself!  I used shitake mushrooms, and followed the advice of the most helpful review, and boiled my wontons separately.

Very good taste, but I must have cooked the wontons too long because they became mushy.  I'll be more careful next time.  Also, I had to add extra chicken broth because there were SO many wontons.  I would maybe halve the wontons next time.

Very tasty soup.  I added some finely chopped fresh ginger into the meat recipe and it gave the wonton a little kick.

Holy wontons! So yummy!  Even my picky 4 year old gobbled it up and asked for so many helpings I had to cut her off since I was afraid she'd make herself sick! A little time consuming to make the wontons but very worth it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was very good!!!  Next time I might do the buillon powder with water just to see if I can get the flavor even closer to the wonton soup at my favorite Chinese restaurant.  This one was a tad bit saltier but still very close and very good!  Thanks!!

It takes far longer than the 40 minutes stated and there are far too many veggies, perhaps the submitter meant a baby bok choy. I had to add an additional  5 cups of broth to get this to a soup consistency.  After reading the reviews I cut the sesame oil back to 1 tsp for the meat mixture and it was still overpowering. It's probably not something that I will make again.

The recipe  and directions were very easy to follow.  I made this with my daughter, an aspiring cook, and she added freshly grated ginger and cilantro to the pork filling for the wontons, and it was delicious. We also used some Thai Ginger flavored chicken broth. We had about double the amount of wontons we needed for this pot of soup, so the rest are in the freezer ready to use again.

This soup is the best soup ever! It tastes so authentic.  Make  sure you stick to the recipe and don't improvise on the ingredients.  The first time I made it, the won tons blew up with air and then deflated causing some of the wontons to lose their stuffing but its like anything else new to you.... It just takes practice.  The second time I made this soup, it was perfect.  It freezes really well and I advise doing so since this recipe is pretty labor intensive, it is helpful to make extra and freeze individual portions for later use.  I like to place in freezer bags laying flat until frozen, then they stack nicely in the freezer.  When you want to use them, take out desired portions and drop bag into a pot  of boiling water and heat up that way so the soup doesn't get diluted during the reheating step. Delish and now my staple go-to" recipe for Asian side dish.

This was really good wonton soup the only reason I gave it 3 starts is first off i set it for 12 servings and it gave me way way too much ingredients for the amount of broth that is used. It was extremely difficult to make. The soup was 90% wontons and veggies with 10% broth. It took about three hours in total to make including the prep. It was my first time making won tons so I did have a little trial and error while putting them together and the recipe asked for way too much ground pork for the amount of wonton wraps. I had to deconstruct the wontons and redo them cause they wouldn't close from being overstuffed. In the end it tasted great despite the difficulty. The stuffing was a tad tough as well though I should add. Wont make again.

Wow! Prego is in love with this!! I boiled the wontons in a separate pot then added them to the broth as others recommended. After trying it, I quickly decided it was missing a little something. I added a little dab of chopped ginger to the broth. *bam* And there you have it. I had thirds and I'm not ashamed. ;-D Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

No bread crumbs or sesame oil, I cooked the wontons in water the added them to the broth when they were finished. I also added Slices of beef, chicken and ham and more shrimp. My daughter loved it. She likes broccoli so I used lots.

Awesome recipe! My friends and family think I'm some kind of culinary Guru because of this recipe! I didn't put mushrooms (girlfriend hates them) and no shrimp (I'm allergic) other than that I only changed the ground pepper to course ground. I have made this five or six times and only have one piece of advise. Get help wrapping the won tons. It takes forever to do a double batch when it's just you. Again awesome recipe!

We've made this recipe many times. The wontons are a bit time consuming, but it cooks up quickly after the initial hands-on portion and it is well worth the effort. I almost always replace the ground pork with sausage, and we tend to leave out the bok choy and snow peas. The wontons are excellent hot, or even as cold leftovers. I'm about to whip some up right now.

WOW! My new fav soup. I was missing two of the ingredients (shrimp and Bok Choy) but plan on making this again with those added. This soup is great for cold WI weather or I could see when your not feeling so hot. Wrapping the meat did not take that long - I learned that laying the wrapper on the cutting board and placing the meat into it DID NOT WORK. I ended up grabbing a wonton wrapper dipping each side into water and then holding it in my hand adding the meat to it - then squeezing the sides in almost a wave pattern. Took me about an hour to make. Husband was very impressed.

First time making Wonton soup and have now made this one a few times. I was so impressed with the flexibility of the recipe. I made a couple batches of the Wontons and froze them in a single layer before putting them in a large freezer bag so I can make small batches of soup very quickly using whatever vegtables I have on hand. Thank-you so much for this recipe!

This was good. The tricky part is wrapping the filling in the won ton. All the wontons stayed together and didn't open when I boiled them.! And they looked like the ones in the restaurants.

This was delicious!  I added sliced carrots into the broth with the other veggies.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon grated ginger into the meat mixture.  We will be making this lots more!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous and was a huge hit with te whole family, was even asked to make it again later this week.  I did make a couple modifications, but the method and process remained intact.  The wontons do take time to make, but once you get going it goes by quickly.  I set them up as an assembly line, 6 at a time:  put down the wrapper, fill, wet, fold, place on cookie sheet and put in refrigerator, repeat until all are filled.  I have made wontons in the past and found that if you refrigerator them prior to cooking, they hold their shape better for boiling.  For those that had problems with filling leaking I suggest 1 tsp and when sealing, push out all the air and make a tight seal around the filling.  This made perfect wontons for me.  I also served this with sambal olek, soy & sesame so people could season to their own liking.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Surprisingly easy and delicious!  I used low sodium chicken broth, and omitted the salt.  I also put two times the amount of green onion and mushroom into the wonton mix in hopes of a lighter more flavorful wonton.  Really pleased with the end product!

We have a Chinese foreign exchange student came to our house for dinner. His eyes lit up when he saw this dish, he took a picture of it, and when he tasted it he said it was: "Delicious." We had him in our house for almost a year and have him over to dinner sometimes. He is brutally honest, so I was so happy this recipe turned out like it did. Delicious.

This recipe is awesome. My family of six eat every bit, and I only get about 1 bowl for my lunch the next day. My only recommendation is extra broth just to give everything a little more room

Super easy and tastes great.  I recommend reducing the sesame oil as a dash goes a long way.  Also, added garlic and onion salt for more flavor.  To the broth, I doubled the peas and bok choy and added water chestnuts.

This was soooo good. I used 3/4 a pound of pork to make less dumplings and tried to compensate the spices accordingly. It was perfect except there was a little too much sesame oil taste. If making a smaller batch watch the sesame oil.

This was very good. I used ground turkey only because my grocery store didn't have any ground pork when I went. I ended up freezing half of the !wontons because it made a lot. The leftovers  weren't great as the wontons fell apart, but the initial soup was very good and comforting. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time eating (and making) wonton soup, and wasn't sure what to expect. As a first timer, I think wonton soup is in its nature a bit bland, so I'm sure for wonton soup this is a great recipe. Next time I will add a little of my favorite spices to give it some kick.

I do cook my wontons separately in boiling water as it allows my broth to be less cloudy and mor flavourful. The wontons freeze well. Do not cook before freezing.  I freeze in a single layer then transfer to ziplock bags. This prevents them from sticking together. Wonderful to have on hand. Great recipe !

Due to allergies, Used a soy sauce substitute, no shrimps, no mushrooms, no peas, olive oil instead of sesame oil and no bokchoy. Added a few extra seasonings and homemade wontons. I need to practice my wonton shaping skills  but otherwise it turned out with excellent flavor!

Added broccoli, celery, carrots and baby corn for more of a wor-wonton affect.   Also added a TBSP of maggi sauce for extra flavor.

I made this recipe, as written, and found it to be very bland.  It also took quite a while to stuff/seal all the won tons.

This was delicious! I doubled the stock and used frozen potstickers I had to make it doable on a weeknight. There were no leftovers so I take that as a win!

Easy and so delicious. I use ground chicken only because my family doesn't love pork. It's great either way.

I’ve made this soup twice exactly as written. I like this soup but I will make a couple of tweaks next time I make it. I think the sesame oil is very overpowering in the wonton meat mixture, so I will reduce the sesame oil to a teaspoon. I will add garlic to the mix as well. I will also reduce the amount of bok choi so that there is more broth and less vegetable. I want the wontons and broth to dominate. I also cooked the wontons separately in boiling water and added them to the hot broth afterwards, to keep the broth from becoming cloudy from the wonton noodle dough. Very tasty dish!

I made this soup, omitting the shrimp and snow peas, and substituting ground turkey for the ground pork. I cooked the wontons in boiling water in a separate pot, then added them to the hot soup broth. This method worked out well.
My family all liked this wonton soup; I will definitely be making this recipe again!
It took me a total of about 90 minutes to make this, including making the filled wontons.
I only used about half of the wontons in the soup, and froze the other half for later use. I am glad that the recipe made so many wontons, because it does take time to fill and fold the wontons, so having some ready-made in the freezer will be a timesaver for the next time I make this recipe.
Yum yum - great wonton soup!

This turned out really yummy. We graded it a B+. The won tons were amazing and turned out great! Next time, I will double the broth, and all ingredients except the won tons i.e. green onions, mushrooms, bok choy, shrimp, and snow peas. There were plenty of won tons but not much broth. This is a good size recipe so if you want a smaller recipe maybe just do half a package of won tons with the same amount of broth.

I don’t consider myself to be a creative personality. So when a simple straight forward recipe works out great on the first try, I am ecstatic! I was unsure about the nutmeg and I did it and it made the recipe even better. I would definitely recommend to all. Heads up make sure you have a big enough pot before you start cooking! ?? Thanks Joe!

Our family tradition is "money bag" soup on New Year's Eve. We double the chicken broth to 16 cups which helps dilute the sesame oil. The only other variation is replacing shrimp with seasoned chicken sauteed in garlic and onions and adding a dash of Asian fish sauce Patis. The 2 chicken thighs makes up for the added broth. Wonderful recipe!!!

I'd like to know how necessary the breadcrumbs are to this mixture?  If i add an egg in place of the breadcrumbs, will that work?
Please also respond to my email:  slsmith23@aol.com.

Simple and flavorful.  It took a bit more time than I expected to make the wontons, but it turned into a fun project to do with my daughter.  3/4 Tablespoon seemed to be the perfect amount of meat.   I'm always looking for good soup recipes without garlic or onion (green onion is fine) since the wife has Crohn's.   Will make again.

Absolutely delicious.  Only changes we made were to use a breakfast sausage we had on hand and it took about 12 cups of chicken broth to have enough liquid for the soup.  A new family favorite.

Wasn't adding shrimp or snow peas, so ramped up the broth with 4 smashed cloves of garlic, the bok Choy root, mushrooms, green onions and a sprinkle of ginger. Discarded the garlic and bok Choy roots and cooked the wontons in the broth. Did a low sodium, low fat option by subbing no sodium broth, low sodium soya sauce and ground chicken. Very good, will make again!

I made this, it was awesome! I didn’t add the shrimp though. The other reviews are right, it makes A LOT. Look at my pictures of all the wontons it makes. Btw, the wrappers I bought had this exact recipe on the package. Pirates! They stole your recipe! Lol.

Pretty easy recipe. My only problem was air in my won tons, will have to press the air out to avoid floaters. Also froze half of the won tons for next time.  Definitely a keeper.

Recipe was easy, results were delicious.  The only thing I left out were the snow peas.  I just shared a bowl with my son who loved it too.  I will make this again.   L Wojick

Tasted delicious but the wonton wrappers didn't stay closed. I think another user said to make them and freeze them before boiling probably would have been better.

Very good flavor .  I used hot pork sausage,  a pound of shrimp and red pepper flakes instead of black pepper.  almost all of the wontons fell apart, maybe the soup sat too long before serving.  When making the wontons, I found it better to use about 1/2 a TBL of the filling.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  Won Ton soup is a favorite for us and most Chinese food restaurants fall short of Asian flavor (that is why the sesame oil is so important). The only changes I made was added more onion and mushroom to the won ton filling. They are the best won tons we have had in a very long time and are looking forward to the leftovers today.  I had extra filling and wrappers, so I made fried won tons as an appetizer!  What a hit!, thank you!

This was freaking awesome, I mean I was seriously impressed! I have never made wontons before and it was surprisingly easy. It tasted SO good. I had Campbell's Pho broth so I used that and chicken broth, worked great. Vegetable broth would work equally as well. 

I did not use the whole package of wrappers though (about 3/4) so next time I would use  1 1/2 pounds of ground pork and slightly adjust the other ingredients to use all of the wrappers. 

I also found that the broth to ingredient ratio was low, so next time I would increase to 12 cups or 3 cartons of broth for the whole batch of wontons (especially if using more pork) OR freeze half of the uncooked wontons on a parchment lined cookie sheet for another batch and stick with the 2 cartons of broth. 

I did follow the advice to boil the wontons in plain water before adding to broth in order to keep the soup broth from clouding.

How ever you do it, it is such a workable and adjustable recipe. Delish!

Thank you for the recipe. I have made this a few times and the whole family loves it !!   I have to double the batch each time and NEVER have leftovers hahah. For any left over pork mixture, I make small meatballs out of it and throw those in.

Broccoli, cauliflower and any other vegetable i have that needs to be used, goes into the pot. 

Making this again tonight for a full house :)

I omitted the shrimp, and added 2 cups of water. Turned out excellent.....a little time consuming, but worth it. Next time I will add a bit of freshly grated ginger.

I have a gluten allergy so I can't order wonton soup at a Chinese restaurant. So I found out have to make the wontons from scratch n used this recipe for the soup. Me n my husband, who has never had wonton soup, were very happy with it. It was really good. Couldn't believe how the pork inside the wonton flavored the broth n I liked the addition of the book choy.

I make this recipe at least once a month and the whole family loves it. If you boil the wontons in a separate pan of water for 3-5 mins then add it to the soup pot your chicken broth will not get cloudy and the wontons won't taste funny from boiling directly  in the chicken broth. Knorr chicken broth cubes works perfectly for rich broth. This makes makes it taste just like wonton soup from a restaurant.  Goes great with the beef lo mein recipe from this site.

Tasted great. Followed someone else's advice and booked wontons in water and not broth. Seems you really need boiling water to seal the wonton. Some of mine fell apart during the simmer after I added to the broth. Wontons are a lot of work!

Mmmm. I'm so full right now. I made this today and having 3rds felt necessary. I made a half batch but had to add more chicken broth than listed. The rest worked out well. I can definitely see myself making this at least once a month from now on.

The wontons take time to make but if you make them ahead of time the rest of the recipe goes really fast. It's our favorite meal for a cool night.

If you use bouillon cubes add 1 or 2 more cups of  more water (knorr brand) & use the bigger wrap from an Asian store & follow the cooking time or ur soup will become thick because the wraps have a thickening agent in it....I got so many compliments even though I thought it was too salty I'll make this again it's inexpensive & ez!!

Followed this recipe and made wontons with ground chicken instead of pork.  Added a bit more scallion and mushrooms for flavor.  Threw in some water chestnuts and baby corn into broth.
Impressed myself and my family with how good it turned out!

These are sooo good! This recipe was extremely easy; kids could do it. It took me about an hour from start to finish and most of that time was spent stuffing the wontons, but nothing about it was difficult. As I get used to it I'll probably cut that time in half. It does make a ton, so I only cooked half and will fry the other half for dumplings. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I omitted the shrimp, I don't care for it.  Everything else was to the letter.  Will definitely make it again.  Think I will try freezing some of the wontons separately and save for a quick meal another time.

This was a great wonton soup, I did follow the tip about cooking wonton's separately.  I did add more soy sauce, just cause I really like it and wanted more flavor.  When I made the wonton's  I put them in the freezer  immediately.  Once frozen, I packaged them for two servings of four.  Turned out great each time.  I am looking this up again, as I am making more.  Oh, I did leave out the shrimp as I only wanted to use port.

This recipe is fantastic. I was cooking just for myself as I'm a student living alone, so I halved the recipe,  made about 10 wontons, and froze the remaining wrappers/meat.  I wasn't exactly sure how to measure half a pound of the ground pork, so I just guesstimated. I think I used a bit too much and failed to adjust the other ingredients... which might be why the meat didn't stick together - it was still crumbly inside the wrapping, but it was delicious irregardless. 

I left out the bok choy and snow peas because I didn't have any on me, and because I've been feeling sick for two or so days now and was craving a kind of vegetable-less soup. 
I did use mushrooms though; it really made a difference in the broth! I added egg noodles as per the suggestion of another reviewer, to make it more filling.

Would highly recommend this recipe. It also helps that it didn't result in me having to do many dishes at all: I mixed the meat in one bowl, and cooked the soup in one pot. So easy :)

Starry Night do not feel badly about seeing this on the wrappers. I've been making this soup long before Allrecipes came into existence. AND I got the recipe from a wrapper and a wonderful Asian friend. One slight difference can mean a whole new recipe. No One has exclusive rights to any recipe with that. Add seseame oil or not, use mange-tout or bok choy, all slights that make it yours. I also boil my wontons separately so as not to cloud the water with the cornstarch that is on them.(this makes them easy to peel) Plus I too find that 1 heaping teaspoon is perfect for the stuffing.  -  I tried with the oil and I liked it but others did not. LOL, to each their own!  Thank you for posting with YOUR version.

This was the recipe on the back of the wonton wrappers I got!  Very easy and I added sesame oil and soy sauce as needed for taste with salt and pepper.  For my wonton filling, I also added toasted sesame seeds with the meat and I used panko bread crumbs instead.  If I made again, I would even do a little heat in the meat to add depth, maybe even a flavored sausage.  It was a hit.

GREAT basic recipe to adapt to your family's needs. I made TWO versions. I substituted ground chicken for pork and also made a vegetarian pot with chopped Shiitake in the wontons and a mushroom broth. HAPPY family tonight...even the teenagers.

I love it. I didn't add the shrimp or bokchoy as I don't like that in my wonton. the sesame oil makes it . No restaurant can compare. now I am spoiled forever to make my own.

This was good, but very bland, even with the addition of lots of fresh ginger.   Great base, but definitely needs some seasoning.  Thanks for sharing

This is not your average Chinese take-out Wonton Soup! I made it and it came out excellent! The vegetables and shrimp really kicked it up and add so much to the flavor of the soup.

Love it! My wife couldn't believe I made this soup for her. I couldn't find the wonton wrappers locally so I cheated and added store bought wontons. Can wait to make it again.

Hey Starry Night, I made this recipe a year or two ago and loved it. This time around when I pulled out the Nasoya brand wontons I discovered your exact recipe, minus the breadcrumbs! It looks like this company is a fan  of your recipe!

One of the best recipes of any kind I've pulled off this site, and I've tried a lot of  them.  I couldn't get ground pork so I used ground chicken. This will be a regular on our menu. It did make a lot of wontons so I've freezing some for next time.

I have been searching for a good wonton soup that tastes similar to an authentic wonton soup you would get at the Chinese food store, AND I FOUND it!!  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!!!  I did make several changes, only b/c I didn't have certain items on hand.  I omitted sesame oil, snow peas & shrimp altogether, AND THIS RECIPE STILL TURNED OUT AMAZING!!!  Will never buy take out wonton soup ever again.  Thank you Starry Night for sharing this recipe with the world :0).

this was delicious, I did make a few changes though, I omitted the sesame oil, added a few tsps. of worchestershire sauce to the broth, and to the filling I added a tsp. of minced ginger and about 2 tbsp. of brown sugar. (combining the recipe with another one) I will definitely be making this again!

Very good soup!  I didn't have time to make the wontons from scratch so I followed another suggestion and bought frozen dumplings.  Turned out great. The broth was particularly tasty.

This is an excellent recipe for wonton soup. The pork filling is really tasty. I followed the directions exactly and added some crushed red pepper for spice. Next time I will add more broth because the soup was a little crowded. I will also chop the all of the veggies into smaller pieces. I didn't think the shrimp added much to the soup so I will omit those next time. I got rave reviews from my husband who loves Chinese food.

Made if for the second time ever when my boyfriend's parents came over for dinner.  They wanted the recipe!  Turns out great!

I found that there was a lot of food to broth ratio, and that I was sort of cramming stuff into the soup (but it all came together great!  The first time I made the soup I over boiled the wontons in the soup, also over cooked the shrimp.  Still had people complimenting it!  Great recipe!

So glad I tried this recipe! I am a soup lover, and I love wonton soup but have always been intimidated by it...figured it was too much work and that it probably called for ingredients that were hard to find/too expensive. I was so wrong! This soup was so good. Super easy to make. Tasted just like a wonton soup you would get at a good Chinese restaurant. We always have soy sauce and sesame oil in our pantry and shrimp in our freezer, so I only needed the pork and bok choy. This is a pretty inexpensive meal, and is done rather quickly. The wontons were so easy to make. Looking forward to making this again and playing with the ingredients!

I did not change any ingredients in the recipe, the only thing I did differently was to boil the wontons in water before adding to chicken broth as the other reviewers suggested. The soup had a nice taste but seemed a little lacking in flavor to me, felt like it needed something to put it over the top (MSG?), the soup I buy from restaurants seems more tasty.

The filling of the wontons lacked flavor and the sesame oil just didn't go well with it. With everything added to the broth it was good. My husband loved it. I won't be using the filling recipe again. The other reviewer that mentioned to boil the wontons separately was a great idea as it did leave a lot of flower in the water.

Great. I used finely chopped rotisserie chicken(instead of pork) and added 1/4 tsp ginger & 1/2 tsp chopped garlic to filling and skipped the bread crumbs....marvelous.

This was my first time ever making wonton soup and did I ever pick the right recipe! It truly tastes like take out and was far easier and faster than I thought it would be. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out delicious, I wouldn't change a thing!

Just made this.  I didn't veer from the recipe and I thought the result was amazing.  I would add that I must take forever to fold wontons because it took me much longer from start to finish than the time given in the recipe.  I think you must get faster the more you do it.  Well worth the time and effort!

This was so delicious! Even my picky kids loved it, I've always wanted to make this at home but I thought it would be really difficult. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't hard at all (and even if it was, it would be totally worth the effort)
