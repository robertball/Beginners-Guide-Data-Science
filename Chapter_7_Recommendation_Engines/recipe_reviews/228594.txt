Love the dressing mix! A versatile recipe that can be easily modified to suit your taste.  I like to use regular mayo, add 1/4 tsp old bay and 1/8 tsp cayenne and omit the salt and pepper for the dressing, top with sliced cherry tomato and crumble 6 strips bacon for the four servings.  Thanks for posting!

I drizzled the mayo combination over and added Pico de Gallo before rolling up the tortilla.  Next time I would either grill the shrimp, marinated in garlic or add bacon for a bit more flavor.

Loved this!!  We didn't use the hot sauce because I was making it for myself and my three girls 5 and under.  It was a big hit for all of us, though I did add a little more avocado because my two youngest are huge avocado fans.  We also did not add any salt, just a little black pepper, and it had plenty of kick for our group.  :-)  We didn't use the Boston lettuce because we can't get that locally but Romaine worked just fine.  I was using frozen uncooked shrimp so I saut√©ed them with a little butter just before adding them to the recipe, and the warm shrimp were great in this recipe.  There's probably a lot more experimenting we'll try with this basic recipe, thanks!

This was pretty darned good but it did need a bit more seasoning. Next time I might use raw shrimp and cook it up with some bacon. Nevertheless this was still a good dish that didn't take much time to put together.

These were pretty good.  They would be very nice for a luncheon.  I would consider adding some diced tomato for color.  Thanks for a easy delicious recipe.
