Alright, I got daring and changed things up a bit. Others commented on how they like red sauce on their pizza, so I thought I would give it a try. Well, it was great! I used Hunt's Garlic and Herb Spaghetti Sauce. I changed a few other things a little too. I made my own pizza dough using my bread machine, but the refrigerated pizza dough works fine too. I like to put the dough on my pizza stone and make breadsticks with the excess dough, but have also used a rectangular pan if I need more pizza. I then spread the herb butter over the dough. As per other reviews, I also added another 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, 1 tablespoon butter, and another garlic clove. This mixture barely covered the dough. After the thin layer of the herb butter mixture, I spooned on a layer of the Hunt's sauce. I then sprinkled some parmesan cheese and even some mozarella cheese (which I recommend) over it. I then added some chicken strips (Tyson's Fajita Chicken Strips because I was in a time crunch - it was fantastic and I have used it every time since!) and also added three Roma tomatoes instead of two. I found that chopping the tomatoes instead of slicing made them easier to eat on the pizza. I topped it with a sprinkle of cilantro. I'm a cilantro fan, but I agree with others, it was overpowering. I didn't even put in 1/4 cup. So, the next time I made this I put in even less. I would not omit it all together - it does add to the flavor. This pizza was so good! My husband absolutely LOVES it!!!

I think the "secret" is the sauce - sort of like a pesto, but not quite.  I have to admit, I didn't have all the ingredients specified, so used leftover roasted chicken, feta instead of ricotta, and regular tomatoes instead of roma.  I also made my own crust. But, this was an excellent recipe for the ideas and, as with most pizza recipes, it was pretty much adaptable for what was on hand in the kitchen and what we like.  Thanks for the ideas!

I liked the flavor combination, however 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes was not enough.  I would next time have the temperature up to 425 for 15 to 20 minutes.  Also, treat the pizza pan to prevent sticking.  Otherwise, very good, and could be great with broccoli or other veggies.

Personally, this is the best pizza I ever had. It is very different from the traditional tomato-based, cheese-laden pizza. I made my own whole-wheat pizza crust, and grilled the chicken with cumin, paprika, chilli powder, onion powder and garlic and black pepper salt to give it more flavor. I used more garlic than required (since I love garlic!) and even added garlic powder into the butter (I used light margerine) mixture. It turned out fabulous. I also sprinkled on dried oregano and italian seasoning to give it a more herbie taste. You would like to add fresh sliced white mushrooms too! My husband and I love this pizza and I would definitely keep this recipe as long as I live! Thank you so much for this worthy recipe!!!

Excellent!  I used 2 chicken breasts and cooked them in the butter/garlic pan.  Also added a little mozzarella cheese.  Would make a great appetizer if cut into smaller pieces.

This recipe was more delicious then I expected.  I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms.  I recommend adding 1.5 chicken breasts instead of one.  Next time I think I am going to grill the chicken instead of boil it.  I cooked this at 400 degrees as well and it turned out perfect!  Thanks for an awesome recipe that I will make often.

Update:  This has become a regular in our household.  Don't listen to reviews that say to add red sauce.  The pesto-like basil-green onion sauce is one of the best things about this pizza.  It also takes great on a homemade wheat crust.  YUM!  This is AWESOME.

This is a very tasty recipe!  The herb butter adds a great flavor to the pizza.  It’s a nice change from the “traditional pizza”.  You can really personalize this with any topping you like.

This was a great, light pizza!  Next time I make it I'll double the herb butter because it only covered 1/2 my crust.  I did add an extra clove of garlic and an extra 1/2 tsp of dried basil.  I grilled the chicken rather than boiling it and I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash table seasoning.  It was very good that way.  I also sliced the tomatoes rather than dicing and I used mozzarella cheese instead of ricotta because I just don't keep ricotta on hand.

We loved this easy recipe!  I bought DiGourno pizza crust at the store instead of making my own. It turned out fabulous and I will be making it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I used with bobboli. Maybe it would be better with the refrigerated dough. I also should've seasoned the chicken, the pizza was bland. Will probably not make again.

I doubled the sauce as suggested and it was a good amount.  Next time, I will flavor the ricotta with something because it made the pizza rather blah.  I like the concept, but it needs some work.  Will definitely keep trying with new ideas.  I did add fresh mushrooms, red bell pepper and sliced banana peppers.

Yum! I doubled the herb butter, substituting dried parsley flakes for the dried basil and vegetarian chicken strips for the boneless chicken breast. I also used halved grape tomatoes instead of chopped roma, mozzarella cheese instead of ricotta, and left out the cilantro. I added some sliced mushrooms and made the whole thing on a homemade pizza crust. This was absolutely delicious and incredibly versatile. Will make again for sure!

I used probably double the margarine and did all dried herbs, subbed mozzarella for the ricotta. Very tasty.

I used a homemade whole wheat dough w/ herbs, which attributed to the flavor of this pizza - regular dough may be too bland. The only thing I wish was different is the flavor of the chicken; it needs a little something. My husband didn't care for this b/c he's a "sauce guy", but I loved it. I recommend 3 T butter, 3 cloves garlic and sliced (instead of diced) roma tomatoes. Will make mini pizzas just for me next time!

Next time I will make more of the butter garlic sauce for this recipe.  Also, I will try a homemade pizza crust - we didn't really like the taste of the Pillsbury ready-made crust.

Delicious!  I just mixed everything together with the herb butter and then put it on the crust.  My family loved it and we had no left-overs!  UPDATE: I wanted to make stromboli out of this, so I mixed the herb butter, tomatoes, and chicken together, put them on top of the thinned-out dough, and then topped with the cheeses (I added a little gorgonzola too).  I rolled it up, put it in the oven (at 375 degrees) for ~30 minutes, and my family thought that this recipe was even better as stromboli.

I've made this several times and my husband and I love it (my 5-year-old likes it, too, IF I omit the tomatoes on a few pieces for her).  It says it makes 6 servings, but we can eat the entire pizza ourselves.  Here's what I have done differently:  1)  I have used ricotta and cottage cheese and both work fine.  2)  My husband is not a fan of onions, so I leave those out.  3)  I treat the pan w/cooking spray  4)  I cook and de-bone a whole chicken, and use shredded chicken instead of a chicken breast. I always have enough chicken left to make another meal.  5)  I double the butter sauce.

We have found this recipe to be a great alternative to the regular, tomatoe-sauce variety pizza.

This was really easy and good. I skipped the cilantro and used a regular onion instead of green.  My pizza dough was store bought and turned out to be much too thick and doughy with a sour taste, so I would suggest a nice thin dough instead.

I melted the butter, garlic and herbs, but didn't wait until it hardened in the fridge.  I just let it cool off and then spread the (liquid) butter onto the dough.

I also used red onion, omitted the cilantro and sprinkled with fresh basil.

Everyone loved it.  Thank you.

This recipe was awesome!! We added sun dried tomatoes which were great. I would change the temperature to cook the pizza to 425. 350 was not hot enough and ended up taking too long and dried out the pizza.

I omitted the cilantro - didn't like the idea of it on a pizza - and used a lot of regular red onion instead of green. Husband said he prefers red sauce-based pizza, but I loved it! Thanks!

I used the suggestions given by the other posters but this just was not good.  It was very bland.  I may make it again, but use Mozarella cheese and use a spice with the chicken.

This was good, however, I thought it seemed a bit lacking without a sauce or some cheese under the toppings.  I would try it again with a layer of either provolone or mozzarella. Thanks.

WOW! This is the best pizza I think I've ever had! I added garlic powder and salt, green onions, small brocolli chunks and sundried tomato. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added a bit of mozzarella cheese. Delicious with a glass of cold iced tea.. use a store bought premade crust tho! Also I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I made another chicken pizza with half of the chicken. both were great, but this was better. thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

Delicious!!!  My family enjoyed this and now it's a family fav.  

I did tweak the recipe a bit....I used 1.5 chicken breast, doubled the butter and garlic mixture, nixed the green onions, added oregano and mozarella.

I think the next time I make this (oh, because I will be making it again very soon) I will add red bell peppers.

This was a great healthier pizza!  The flavors were great!  I did double the butter sauce and used light margarine.  I also seasoned the chicken breast well with mrs dash sun dried tomato basil seasoning and sauteed it in a skillet instead of boiling.  I didnt have fresh cilantro so I added in some dry with the ricotta mixture along with some extra italian seasonings.  I made my own fresh dough and grilled the pizza instead of baking it.  I added fresh chopped spinach as well to the pizza.  It turned out great and I loved the addition of the spinach.  Next time I will make sure to buy fresh cilantro because I know that would change the flavor a lot.  I loved the butter sauce on this.  Next time I may make one with the butter sauce and the other with a nice homemade marinara/pizza sauce because I love my pizza with red sauce as well!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will for sure make again!

I used Pillsbury Thin Pizza Crust. I prebaked the crust according to the package directions and then prepared the pizza according to the recipe directions. This was amazing!

This was pretty good.  I made it following the directions, and it was enjoyable.  I prefer my lazy version, though, in which I rub the crust with olive oil and then just throw a ton of basil, cilantro, garlic, and green onions on top.  Then I toss on some Parmesan and ricotta and drizzle it with more olive oil (so the garlic won't burn).  That version is good if you aren't a huge fan of tomatoes and chicken but enjoy spice and don't mind having wicked awful breath.

This is o.k., a nice change from the regular red sauce pizza but seemed to lack something.  I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site as the crust(which is amazing!), other than that I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  It was a little dry as others have pointed out and I'm not sure I liked the cilantro with the other flavors, maybe parsley would work better?  I probably would not make this again but it was fun to try it.  Thanks for sharing.

This pizza was a hit!!! I made two, a thin crust and a thick crust. On the thick crust pizza I added about 3-4 Tbs of Garlic Alfredo sause to the original recipe. I also added fresh spinach and sun dried tomatoes to both pizza's. This is our new "Pizza Night" pizza!!!

I made this as written and thought it was very bland.  If you read the good reviews, most of them say they've changed the recipe substantially.  The recipe can be a good jumping off place for your own variations, but don't rate it as something it wasn't written to be.

This pizza was delightful.  With my changes, I thought it was amazing. In a pinch, refrigerated dough is fabulous.  I wouldn't put it on a recipe, though... it is much better with homemade crust. Instead of boiling the chicken, I sprinkled it with garlic salt and cooked it in a little bit of oil in a pan on the stove.  This browned it and gave it a nice color and flavor that would have been missing otherwise. I used homegrown tomatoes that were very juicy... I think this helped the pizza not be too dry, although doubling the sauce would do the trick, too... I used fresh basil in the herb butter and it was amazing.  I also subbed fresh mozzarella for the ricotta.  I added some greens to the top before baking.  We had swiss chard, so that's what I threw on there but any green would work.  

YUMMO! Thanks for the inventive pizza idea.

Everything together makes it taste so good...the only things I can think of to make it even better is this:

Increase by one chicken breast and marinate it in italian dressing.

Use more butter, garlic, green onins, and basil.

Mix it in with the ricotta cheese and let it chill as the paste.

Very good!  I was scared to 'boil' a boneless breast, as I didn't want it to be dried out then baked.  I gently poached the breast instead.  Used EVOO in lieu of butter.  Warmed the oil in micro w/the garlic and herbs for 30 seconds and let it set for several hours.  I also set the cooked breast in the oil mixture to marinate.  Didn't bother chopping onion, just sliced some red onions and put on pizza.  Also used feta, and combo of mozzarella and romano shredded.  I loved the ricotta!  I made homemade crust(Valentino's)  I was leary of cilantro, as I didn't want a mexican flavored pizza, so used parsley instead.  Also took advice of others and added 1 more clove of garlic,1/2 tsp. more of basil, and 1 more tbsp. of olive oil.  This made a lovely pizza, and even if a crust is bland, you'd never know it with the garlic infusion brushed on the crust.  I made this in a sheet pizza, and would love to try it with sundried tomatoes instead of fresh.

This smelled so yummy while baking I didn't even care if it tasted good but it did!  The Pillsbury pizza crust makes a rectangle cookie sheet so I would definitely increase the amount of garlic/butter combo...next time I would also probably season my chicken.  Was a little skeptical about the ricotta but I was pleasantly surprised.  Just like a gourmet pizza!

First of all, I am a vegetartian, so I substituted Quorn tenders for the chicken. My husband, who is not a vegetarian, loved it and insisted I make this on a regular basis. I made my own pizza dough and used extra butter and garlic as suggested. 
Super Yummy!!

We really found this recipe lacked something.  I did make some changes; I used 3 T. of butter, 3 cloves garlic and a large green onion to make the garlic butter.  I grilled the chicken and used Montreal steak spice to season it.  lastly, I omitted the cilantro because my DH and I don't like it.  We found that there was way too much ricotta on the pizza and that it really lacked in flavour.  In fact, we both said that had I followed the instructions and poached theh chicken, that the pizza would have no flavour at all.  In the end, we might make this pizza again, but we would make some major changes.

I thought it was pretty good, but my 3 children (1, 3 & 9)hated it. Definately more of a grown-up pizza. I doubt I will make this one again, atleast for my family.

This was outstanding! My husband (who is picky about pizza without red sauce) absolutely loved it.  I brushed a little egg white on the crust to make it a bit crispier, but we will definitely be making this again!

This was an excellent pizza, however it could use more garlic sauce.  I made my own crust in the breadmaker and rolled it very thin.  I may add some mozzarella and feta next time.  Will definitely make again.

We really liked the flavor combination of this recipe!  Per other reviews I doubled the butter sauce and added a bit more garlic to the sauce.  LOVED how it tasted on the pizza!  I already had shredded chicken from another recipe I had made and we added a little bit of mozzarella cheese with the ricotta because....well we just love cheese!  This is a great recipe if your looking for a different type of pizza.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this exactly as written. My family has asked me to never make this again. It was not good. I make pizza every Friday night and was getting sick of the usuals so i wanted to try something new and this looked so promising. It was dry and so very bland, even after I seasoned the chicken (which the recipe did not call for but seemed common sense). It was just garlic, no "oomph".  There was not enough butter sauce to cover the pizza and besides the compete lack of overall flavor, the ricotta just ended up mushy and blah. Not even the cilantro could save it.

This is the best pizza recipe I have found! I made this a few weeks ago and my husband loved it. I am making it again tonight. I usually use mozzarella instead of the ricotta and it turns out great! I also like to add spinach just to sneak in a few more vitamins.

This is such a great recipe. I used fresh parsley, basil and cilantro. Red bell pepper, left over grilled chicken and yellow onion (in addition to the green). The options are limitless!

This pizza is great. I use the garlic butter on the crust of all my pizzas! For this specific recipe I added my own tweaks.. the most important of which is the addition of mozzerella cheese. So yummy!

Really good! Do not add red sauce you'll ruin the whole idea! I did double the garlic butter mixture & was glad I did! Love the cilantro as well!! Added a couple other toppings like mushrooms & red crushed peppers, oh also I had mozzarella cheese on hand instead of parmasen & it was delicious! For sure a keeper!!!

This pizza was such a hit. I kept to the original recipe but added some fresh mozzarella and mushrooms to top it off. The flavor was great and we gobbled up the whole pizza in one night! Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!

It was a bit bland to me and the hubby so I had to add some extra herbs in the end. I think this is a great base though. I definitely love alternatives to red sauce. Thanks!

Yummy and easy! I used the Pizza Dough 1 recipe instead of refrigerated dough and I used mozarella since I didn't have ricotta. Feta would be yummy too. Very, very good for how easy it is. I cooked it 20 mins (in a convection oven) and the crust was cooked but just barely. Next time I would cook it for probably 30 minutes because my husband likes a crispy crust.

This was a pretty good pizza, but it was missing a little flavour. I made exactly as written other than adding mushrooms and using my own homemade pizza crust. If I make again I will add some mozzarella cheese and I will grill the chicken with spices instead of boiling. I will also add some basil or other herbs to the ricotta as it is a little bland on its own.

This pizza sure was different but good. I think next time i'll try alfredo sauce.mmmmm! I doubled the sauce and added mozzerella cheese and mushrooms. I used the pre cooked chicken strips and chopped. Next time I will skip the riccotta because it does not melt very well and has a weird taste. After eating I decided to add bbq sauce, that made it way better and took away the riccotta taste, which was a good thing.

Soooo good! I would have given it five stars, but I didn't make the exact recipe. I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough, doubled the butter sauce, added fresh mushrooms, sliced my tomatoes instead of dicing them, and I added a layer of mozzarella cheese on top of the butter sauce BEFORE I added the ricotta,parmesean, and other toppings. Also, I used shrimp that I cooked in lemon juice, butter, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes instead of chicken. I added the cooked shrimp including butter sauce the shrimp was cooked in during the last five min of cooking, topped with more mozzarella, and finished the whole thing with diced green onions. My family LOVED it! There was only one teeny slice left for me! Lol!

This is a really tasty recipe.  There are a few things that I would change.  I didn't like the ricotta dotted on the pizza.  It doesn't really have a lot of taste and it didn't melt down when baked.  Next time I am going to just cut it out and use a little mozzarella cheese.  The cilantro was very strong as well.  I will cut back on that because there are a few people who didn't like the strong taste of it.  Otherwise I am definitely going to make this again

I tried to make this recipe a bit healthier.  I made the crust using another recipe from this site for wheat crust.  I did not use the ricotta cheese, and substituted the extra virgin olive oil for the butter.  I liked it.

The sauce for this pizza is great. I omitted the ricotta and added mozerella and     gorganzolla. I also added roasted red pepper and made my own crust

This pizza is great - the whole family loved it! My husband said this was the best pizza I'd ever made!! After reading other reviews I did up the butter and garlic amounts and I didn't cool the mixture before putting it on the crust. This pizza also looked as great as it tasted. I can't wait to make it again!

GREAT pizza! Use the garlic cheese flatbread recipe on this site as the pizza dough. You'll need to cook the dough a little longer than with the store bought brand (total cooking time of 20 min.) but you won't be disappointed. Some of the very best pizza I've ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great as is or you can add your own slant to it. I put the "sauce" on while it was still warm. This is also good with chopped bacon and shredded mozzarella cheese. I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. Thank you for the recipe!!

Not a bad pizza, it's definetaly an adult pizza, the boyz (6 & 3) were not fond of it. I found that 2 tomatoes diced to be too much - had quite abit of diced tomato left over after completely covering the the pizza (an I love tomatoes), also this is taste thing, didn't add all the cilantro. Our local grocery store did not carry ricotta cheese, so I substitued with cottage, not the best substitue. Loved the garlic butter sauce, will make it again, will try to get ricotta cheese and use less cilantro. 3/11/08 - My son (age 6) decided to try this one again, but this time we did not use any cilantro and added canned mushrooms and diced green pepper & used ricotta cheese this time - he absolutly loved it - ate 2 big slices --guess it helps to have them help make it...

I just made this for a group of Red Sox fans as we watched a play off game.  It was a hit!  I did make a few minor changes:

1) I made my own crust.  I prebaked it for 6 minutes at 425 degrees as I like a crisp crust.

2) I added 1 T. olive oil to the butter/garlic mixture.  Instead of chilling it, I poured it right on to the crust and spread it out while still warm.

3) I sprinkled a handful of mozarella cheese over the other toppings.

Yum!  What a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good, I am giving it a 3 cause I made a lot of revisions.  First I used Jay's Signature pizza crust.  I have NEVER used yeast before and was rather intimidated by it; however, it was really quite easy.
OK, I used a skinless boneless chicken thigh, and satueed it in olive oil and garlic.  Also, I mixed equal amount non fat cream cheese with the ricotta cheese.  Also, I used fresh basil in the butter mix, and topped with chopped fresh basil along with the cilantro.

Final product was pretty good.

The lack of mozzerrella and tomato sauce make this much more like a hearty foccacia than a pizza but it is really delicious.  I made the pizza dough and the only other thing i changed was to leave out teh cilantro adn add carmalized onions but it was absolutely delicious. Make sure to use enough of the butter so the dough doesnt dry out, (putting the tomatos on the bottom layer also helps) and give the garlic butter time to sit and absorb the flavors.  Fantastic recipe but not really pizza.

We found it to be lacking something.

The butter/garlic mixture definitely wasn't quite enough.  I would *at least* double it next time.  

I think it would be good with caramelized onions, and I would definitely season the chicken the next time I make it.

All in all, it wasn't a complete bust... just needs something to give it a bit of extra zip.  I will DEFINITELY make it again, so don't underestimate it's potential!

This was okay, I wasn't as impressed with this as I thought I was going to be. I doubled the butter-garlic sauce which helped and used chicken, cottage cheese, tomatoes, red onion, green pepper, and mozzarella as toppings.  I also used Jay's pizza crust which may have been part of the problem, it was okay but kind of thick and doughy.  I will probably try this again either on a Boboli crust or with Jay's pizza crust but just using half of it.  My husban really liked it but I was looking for more of a creamy butter-garlic sauce I guess.

Everyone loved this pizza, and I even forgot to add the parmesan! Can't imagine how good it will be when I add it next time. I did double the garlic butter mixture, but other than that, followed to the letter. It did need to be baked a bit beyond the stated time as the crust was not nearly done when first checked. This one is certainly a keeper!

This pizza was great!  A wonderful change of pace from the traditional pizza.  I happened to be at the local farmer's market today and picked up a premade pizza crust made with italian herbs.  For the sauce I doubled the amount recommended but tripled the garlic (to keep the vampires at bay).  I marinated the chicken in garlic herb seasoning before cooking.  I also took the suggestion of other members and used cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, and I used shredded Italian blend cheese.  The only thing that we thought it needed at the end was some red pepper flakes which just made this pizza over the top!  Next time we will also add mushrooms.

Very very good. I used a Boboli crust and added Mozzarella, but kept the onions out. I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the butter mixture. I will definitely make it again.

It was very tasty.  I used premade pizza crust and the crust was a little too dry.  It's important to have good pizza crust.  The butter/garlic sauce was delicious but I think I'm going to double it the next time so I have a generous amount to use all over my pizza.

First I used white onion instead of green onion and spinach instead of cilantro.  I also added mushrooms.  It tasted great.  I agree with others about the blandness, so I sprinkled some salt at the end.  That helped a lot.

Very fresh tasting!  We added calamata olives and some mozzarella/provolone shredded cheese.  We also skipped the refrigeration step and just spread the butter on the Boboli crust.  One person thought that the cilantro was a little overpowering, but I enjoyed it!

I made this with the pizza doughIII recipe, and it was a spectacular hit with three out of four of us who had it. The fourth believes chicken doesn't belong on pizza anyway, what does she know? :)


Thank you for the recipe ksimone

Fabulous alternative for a healthy pizza.  I used a Boboli pizza crust from the store, and instead of dabbing ricotta cheese on the top, I made a layer of ricotta cheese on top of  herb-butter spread.  Then put the chicken down and a thin layer of ricotta on that, and then put the tomatoes, cilantrao and parmesan on top. Very tasty.

Very tasty but I would omit the cilantro next time. I do like cilantro but it overpowered all of the other flavors.

This is great.  I did follow someone else's review and put about a cup of red sauce over the top of the garlic/herb butter mixture.  Everyone loved this.

I made it exactly like the recipe with the exception of using grape tomatoes instead of plum.  I really didn't measure the toppings either, I just put them on until it looked right.  Absolutely loved it, it was so yummy...and my one year old ate it right up, she kept asking for more, I will definitely make this again!

Not a fan of the ricotta cheese on pizza.  I also doubled the butter mixture for the crust, and it worked out well.  Fresh mushrooms were also a plus.  I think I will make again, only using alfredo sauce as the replacement for the ricotta, and spreading it on just like you would pizza sauce.  It would be too dry without it.

I thought this pizza was very good. Based on other reviews, I doubled the butter/garlic sauce, and I'm glad that I did. I also added some shredded cheddar and mozzerella cheese to the top. A nice change from the greasy pepperoni pizza we are used to.

I used a pre-made whole wheat thin crust, subed ricotta for feta. I added mushrooms and spinach and marinated and grilled the chicken. I came out great my boyfriend and I loved it.  I ended up making it again the next day.

I didn't care for the ricotta on pizza. Substitute the herb spread with a garlic cream sauce, add mozzarella, and make your own crust in order to salvage this recipe.

This pizza topping was great (I made my own crust).  I used fat-free ricotta and added artichoke. Without my additions/changes the pizza would have been delicious too.  I liked that it was a healthier alternative to meat and red sauce pizzas. I will definately make again.

This is a very good recipe. One of my favorites. As others suggested, I added mozzerella cheese and some mushrooms... and to the sauce, I added more butter and garlic. Something is missing in the sauce and am yet to figure it out. When I do, I'll post about it. Overall, this is the best though.

I am a cheese pizza kind of gal, but this pizza was great! The flavors were wonderful. The only reason it's missing a star, is because the infused butter made the crust a little greasy. I'll probably roast my own garlic and spread it onto my crust next time, omitting the butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

As written, this isn't anything to write home about, pretty though! Mine came out super dry, even with a thin layer of mozzarella. I suppose I'll try it again with more butter and we'll see.

We really enjoyed this pizza! My husband didn't really like the ricotta cheese though...but I think it was more of a texture issue than a taste issue! I was in a bind and didn't have what I needed for dough so I used a Boboli thin crust which was pretty good. I also spiced up the chicken breast as I cooked it.

This was good but quite dry. We made it exactly as the recipe stated but I think that if we were to make it again we would follow some of the other reviewers ideas of doubling up on the sauce or adding red sauce to it. Good flavors though.

Turned out great, but was indeed a little bland. Next time I will double the butter sauce stuff and add much more garlic. I also put in 1.5 chicken breasts and mozzarella cheese.

I was so looking forward to making this, but ended up a bit disappointed.  We couldn't really taste the garlic..., in fact, we found the whole pizza rather bland.  It certainly wasn't "bad", it just didn't have that kick we were looking for.

Good pizza! Made this for dinner last Fri. My sister & her family were in town this past weekend (arriving Fri.) & my bf & I were meeting them at my parent's house. We needed a "quick fix" beforehand & this fit the bill perfectly! I pretty much followed ksimone619's directions to a T, except for a few minor changes. I doubled the amt. of butter mix. (good choice IMHO). Since I made this part earlier today, it had a long while to "set." When ready to assemble my pizza, I realized that the mix. was waaay too hard to spread so I zapped it in the microwave for ~ 20 sec. which seemed to do the trick. Instead of boiling chx., I bought a 6 oz. pkg. of Perdue roasted chx. strips which I chopped into sm. pcs. I wanted to use up what was left of my shredded mozzarella (1/2 c.), so I spread that on top of the garlic butter layer & then topped w/ a sliced roma tomato (only needed 1 BIG tomato), chx., Parm., "dots" of ricotta & 1/4 c. of choppped cilantro. If I were to make this again (it was good, but not WOW -  it also doesn't help that my bf didn't like it...), I'd omit the mozza, add a bit more chx. & save the cilantro for garnish. I think I'd also pre-bake my crust for a few min. (we like crisper crust) b4 adding the toppings. Oh, & I think a homemade or store bought crust is necessary (I purchased pizza dough at my local Italian market) as well as upping the oven temp. to at least 400 (I set mine at 425 for 20 min.). Thx. for sharing :)

An Italian Resturant here in Virginia called Lucas makes a pizza just like this, but with artichokes and onions, so I added those with this pizza and I always use lots of garlic. Awesome Pizza!

Very tasty!  I used boboli and cooked to directions on package.  I needed to use 4 times the butter sauce to cover crust!Sub. artichokes insted of chicken (ash wednesday) and fresh mozz. insted of ricotta and fresh basil.  I then sauted garlic in olive oil with some more fresh basil and drizzled over pizza. I gave it four stars because I would like it a little creamier and will look for a creamy white sause to use with garlic and fresh basil.  If you perfer red sauce, this recipie isn't for you.

I'm not going to lie, I have this pizza literally once a week. Probably because like most said, it's so versatile, as long as you have the basic ingredients for the garlic butter sauce, it's a winner. Sometimes I used fresh spinach instead of cilantro, leave out the chicken if I'm feeling vegetarian, mozeralla instead of parmesan (I don't care for ricotta), add mushrooms, etc. One thing I always do is make it on "Pizza Dough I", a VERY easy pizza crust recipes from this site. Go for it!

Recipe was great! I did, however, make some adjustments. I nearly doubled the amount of butter garlic sauce in order to cover the entire pizza crust (about 18" crust). I also added extra garlic in the sauce AND cooked the chicken breast in a pan with olive oil, minced garlic, and garlic salt to give it more flavor. I then thinly sliced two more cloves of garlic and put that on top of the pizza before it went in the oven. I also used the suggested cheeses and added shredded mozarella as well. The ricotta was excellent (I was weary of using it after reading other reviews). Also, I baked the pizza at 450 degrees for 15 minutes as per the refrigerated pizza dough instructions and it turned out wonderfully. I'd highly suggest using this recipe!

This was fantastic!  I didn't let the sauce cool long enough, so it  was kind of runny but it still turned out great.

I really loved the flavor and for that it deserves 5 stars!  Next time I think I will use a little mozzarella instead of the ricotta.  I didn't think the ricotta added much to it.

ok, i was really expecting this to be quite flavorful and to my surprise it wasnt as much as i thought? i used fresh garlic (always do) and even added crispy bacon, but was kinda bland, for my tastes anyway. maybe i will give it a 2nd chance and use more garlic and possibly a different/another kind of cheese like fresh mozz. it definitely looked amazing!

Different but not much better than standard homemade pizza. Used spaghetti sauce over herb butter layer. Would probably do it again for something different - with shrooms and minus the tomato sauce.

Yummy! Doubled the garlic butter.  I had to use dried parsley, but it was still really good.  Next time I'll use fresh and I'm sure it'll be 5 stars.  15Mo Old and DH LOVED it - only left 1 slice for me!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! You definitely need to double the sauce (I left 2 tbl and mixed in w/ the chicken) and season the chicken w/ some salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder. I used baby bella mushrooms and a fontina/ parmesan cheese mix instead of the tomatoes and ricotta. But it's all what you prefer. Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make this again and again and again.

Here's my variant, which has a bit more spice, and slightly different cooking order:

2 chicken breasts | 2 tbsp butter (unsalted or salted) | 4+ cloves of garlic | 2-3 green onions | 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (or 1/2 tbsp ground coriander) | 1/2 tbsp dried basil | 150g sun dried tomatoes (or 1/3 lb) | 1/2 tbsp ground cayenne pepper | 1 red, orange, or green bell pepper (capsicum) | 1/3 cup parmesan cheese | store crust, store dough, home made dough, etc.

pre-heat oven to 400F (210C).

mince garlic, put in bowl.
mince cilantro, put in bowl.
chop green onions, put in bowl.
chop sun dried tomatoes to size, put in bowl.
slice up pepper and cut slices to half size, put in bowl.

cut chicken into small slices and add to saucepan with
butter, cayenne pepper, and basil. sautee only until
tender, but not fully cooked.

use a spoon to spread remaining butter in pan onto
pizza crust, coating entire surface. spread chicken
pieces all around pizza.

distribute remaining bowl of garlic, cilanto, green onions,
bell pepper, and sun dried tomatoes evenly over top
of pizza.

place pizza into oven for 15-20 minutes. 5 minutes before
removal, distribute parmesan cheese evenly over top of
pizza.

I'm reviewing the pizza base sauce/spread part of the recipe. It smells and tastes really fantastic. I would suggest doubling the spread for one large size pizza. It really reminds me of garlic bread and I definitely prefer this spread over the usual tomato-based pizza sauces.

This is a great, simple, healthy alternative to "pizza" pizza.  Instead of using dough crust, I used the South Beach Diet wraps (olive oil, garlic and herb) so I could make pizzas for a group.  It was great to bring to a party.  Just chop the tomatoes ahead of time and seal them in tupperware with the chicken and cilantro.  Bring along the cheeses on the side and have everyone put their pizzas together themselves.  Works great, the colors look great together and is quick and easy if you want a fast meal.

looked so good and smelled great but it was way too sweet, I think the basil is way too much or maybe it needs a different spice, but I won't be making this again.

Four stars because I didn't love the pizza but my husband did.  I didn't like it because: there was too much cilantro, not enough garlic, and I didn't like the ricotta on it. Husband liked it because it "tasted healthy".

This pizza was very good. I'm not sure if it's a five-star recipe, but it's definitely going to be on repeat in our house. My husband really enjoyed it -- and he loves pizza, so that was the true test! He doesn't eat tomatoes, so I left them off of his side and I don't eat meat, so I made my side with just tomatoes. We also added mozzarella on top with the parmesan with much success.

This was a good pizza, but I think a few needed adjestments would do the trick. Baking at 350 was not enough, I would have gone with 400+ degrees. I would swap ricotta with feta, 1/2 cup paresan vs 1/4 cup and I would have added more garlic (For garlic lovers). I will make it again for round 2!

I thought this pizza was wonderful. I made it for a party and got nothing but complements. I did use a lot more ricotta cheese then the recipe called for, to give the pizza more of a sauce texture. I also added mozzarella cheese.

We were pretty dissappointed in this pizza.  All of the toppings just fell off, the butter garlic sauce made the crust wet, even when it was completely cooked.  I'm giving three stars b/c the taste was pretty good, but needs maybe a sauce or mozzerella chese to hold it together.

Very, very tasty. After listening to the feeback of other cooks, I decided to double the garlic-butter sauce, and I was very pleased I did. Also, I used a 1/2 cup of red onions and cooked them in a saucepan over medium heat with olive oil--these were also a great touch. I just used Oscar-Mayer pre-cooked chicken strips and cooked them in the same pan I made the garlic-butter sauce, and added a little soy sauce, salt, olive oil, and garlic powder. In the future, I might use mushrooms, but an overall great recipe!

A couple of notes: after reaching the boil for the chicken, I let it cook on low heat for 20 

minutes. I was guessing you didn't mean to imply that the chicken should be *boiled* for all 

that time. Also, I used unsalted butter because it was what I had on hand. I also noted a 

discrepancy between "diced" tomatoes in the ingredient list and "slices" in step 4. I opted for 

diced tomatoes because it's the way I like tomatoes on pizzas.
Now, I never even knew you could buy refrigerated pizza dough like that. I was surprised that it 

opened into a rectangle of dough, not a circle. I had a new circular pizza pan to try, so I 

tried to reshape the dough a bit, then gave up and used a rectangular cookie sheet, re-reshaping the dough. The resulting crust was a bit of a mess, shape-wise, so I didn't take a recipe photo like I almost always do.
I thought this recipe was fairly good - 3 stars out of 5 - not great or fantastic. (For anybody 

reading this, I find I tend to rate recipes a star or so below many other reviewers, so you may 

rate this recipe even higher.) The herb butter preparation was interesting - a new technique for 

me. But I didn't especially like the use of ricotta on the pizza - just my personal tastes, maybe. Also, I thought this recipe could have used more of the herb/butter mixture, like a few other reviewers have suggested. All in all, I may try this again.

This recipe was really good.  I used green onions, more butter than called for and added mushrooms.  I also grilled my chicken instead of boiling it.  My husband raved and raved about it.  I will make this one again!

This is a great alternative for those who don't care for typical tomato sauce pizza.  I didn't have any ricotta so I substituted with mozzarella.  We're looking forward to making these again.

This recipe turned out very well, especially considering this was the first pizza I've ever made.  I took other reviewers advice and doubled the herb mixture and used only a bit of cilantro.  I also added a bit of spaghetti sauce and some mushrooms.  Didn't really like the ricotta cheese as much, but that's just me.  A definite success!

I expected more from this recipe, especially since it had received such good reviews.  My husband rated it at only 2 or 3 stars.  Changes I made were: I seasoned and stir-fried my chicken, added some green bell pepper that needed using up, used dried cilantro, red onion instead of green, and added some mozzerella on top.  None of those changes were substantial deviations from the original recipe though.  (Also tried a Jiffy crust for the first time, which we didn't care for, but tried to evaluate this recipe apart from the crust).  All in all, it was just OK for us.  I won't make this recipe again, but may try to build on the concept.

Loved it! Made a few adjustments (and completely forgot the tomatoes!)--doubled the butter mixture, used lots of fresh basil, omitted the cilantro, used grilled marinated chicken, added mushrooms and fresh mozz. I'm anxious to make this again w/ the tomatoes!  Yum!

I thought this was way yummy, and pretty simple. I used an already made pizza crust, and added some black olives and spinach leaves. I also put mozzarella and parmesian cheese on top. I will for sure make this again.

Very, very good!  We will definately have this again!  I took the others' advice and used 3 Tbsp. of butter and 3 cloves of garlic, along with using sliced tomato instead of diced.  I also put about one cup mozzarella cheese on top since I was out of Parmesan and grilled the chicken with spices.  (I used my own crust, too.)  My one year old liked it, too.  Awesome recipe, thanks!
