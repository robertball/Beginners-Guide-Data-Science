This is really a good cheese soup. Overlook the "expert" words and use your common sense on what to skim off, etc. A local restaurant makes this soup, so I looked here for a recipe. This was better when I omitted the carrots and pureed the mushrooms in a food processor the second time. If you've tried and enjoyed Brie Soup, don't bypass this recipe!

I didn't use the celery, added a few peas instead. I also didn't use all of the cream just a tbsp really felt it didn't need it. Considering there was quite a bit of brie in this it was surprisingly light. We all enjoyed this and I would definitely make this for company. Thanks.

I love this.  It freezes good also. I added leeks, onions, and garlic.  I also puree everything togther and strain it several times.  My chicken stock is home made also. This is a great basis to make your own. I have now made this 5 times.

I made this for Christmas just as the recipe says except instead of skimming off the impurities, I just ran it through a sieve after melting the cheese....it was silky smooth and the BEST creamy soup my family has ever had!  Definitely a keeper!!

I followed Cheryn's suggestion and omitted the carrots and pureed the mushrooms and celery. I also figured out the hard way you are supposed to remove the rind before you put it in the pot. The soup is good, but I thought it was missing something. I am not good at figuring out how to make a recipe better, but if I make it again I'll try garlic or onion or more seasoning or something.

What a great soup! I used only peas (instead of all the veggies listed) which really simplified the recipe. While browning the flour I added two sliced cloves of garlic. I didn't want to share this soup with my husband, it turned out so well.

Very good, easy to make. I choose not to strain it. I didn't add the mushroom or wine, and had to substitute 2 cups of milk for some of the Chicken stock. Finished product is different, but GOOD!

Recipe seems a bit off. The sieve seems like it should come after you add the brie. And based on the review comments, I did add 1/2 the white part of a leek (which i think was a bit too much) and one clove garlic and ran all veggies/fungus through a food processor. Pretty tasty though. This is a probably a great base recipe to add and subtract from and make your own. I'd also highly recommend service with toasted bread of some sort.

WOW!   This soup is beyond awesome.    We licked the bowls and brie is right back on my shopping list.   I pureed the veggies per other reviewers, otherwise made per the recipe.    It has a delightfully creamy & velvety texture and a wonderful mushroomy & winey taste.    THANK YOU.
