I didn't really like the taste, so I added some vanilla ice cream, which made it a little better.

This is the last time I will try a recipie without reading the reviews! The 2 1/2 cups of water was way too much! I only started out adding 1 cup and found that it was already too runny. Then with all that apple juice concentrate, it barely tasted like pumpkin! I had to doctor it up quite a bit to get the flavor and consistency I wanted. I added cool whip, ice, more cinnimon, nutmeg, and 1/2 of a vanilla soy yogurt. It turned out great after that!

We love smoothies and pumpkin flavor and thought it would be good but it was horrible. The texture was gross. Maybe some vanilla yogurt or something might help, but would not suggest making as is.

I made this with the ingredients listed but the changes I made was 1 med. banana and 1/4 c. vanilla ice cream with 1/2 c. 1% lowfat milk.  I read the reviews from other comments.  I adjusted it to  a taste with the really fresh pumpkin pulp and it was DELICIOUS!  Adding just 1 banana and cutting the spices in half with the other ingredients.  I felt it was thick enough for the smoothie and you could still taste the fresh pumpkin with the banana flavor.  I will make this again.  Since I always can my own fresh pumpkin pulp.

It was good. But too sweet for my taste. I would sub the apple juice for milk to make it thicker. But was good. Just not great with apple juice. But will definitely make it again.
