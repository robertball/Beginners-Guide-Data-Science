I invited a neighbor girlfriend for an early lunch today since she's having some dental work this PM and dinner will be jello for her. I had all these ingredients except the whole wheat pita.  I have regular pita's (wish I had purchased the WW ones, now).  I made this recipe because of the ease and speed in prep and it just sounded good.  This is really, flavorful.  Will make an excellent hurry up dinner and would be great with a cup of hot soup during the cooler days ahead.  Definitely a keeper and I appreciate you taking the time to share!

This was a good starting point but a little bland. Next time I will try making this with an asian flare by using ground pork, ginger, garlic, soy sauce and a bit more onion.

Love this recipe!  Easy and usually have all ingredients on hand for a quick "go to" meal.

Very enjoyable, shared the shredded cabbage and carrots between minced beef and shredded chicken for more variety. Enjoyed by all.

Good, but it ended up a little dry. I used feta cheese rather than mozzarella, and since it was dry I added some plain greek yogurt as a sauce.  It was also a little bland, so I added some fresh cilantro and it made it quite good with these changes.

I've made this stuff for years.  My kids beg me for it.  
I've made the following changes to the original recipe.  I brown the hamburger along with some Italian sausage.  
I caramelize the onion along with the carrots and some of the cabbage.  I add some sugar, vinegar, garlic and basil.  
I serve it in pita bread with some sour cream.  It's even better the next day, if you have any leftovers.
