I am a mother of 6 children and often have 7+ little ones at the table, not to mention a hungry father.  This is an ideal dish.  It mixes ease, nutrition, and child appeal all in one package.  It can be served as a main dish or a side dish. I also took it as a dish to the Synagogue and not one macaroni was left!!!

This recipe was very easy to make.  My mother, who normally doesn't go for mac and cheese loved it.  It does taste better the next day also...  The only thing that I would change on this is to add more sharp cheddar cheese.  I love cheese, and to me, it didn't have enough sharp cheddar in it.  I also didn't put in the 16 oz of sour cream, and it wasn't soupy... very tasty tough and will be adding this to my recipe collection

I took everyone's advice and added more shredded cheese than the recipe called for. It definitely helped, but would have been even better with less cottage cheese, maybe just 16oz. The taste and consistency are better the second day. Overall, a good recipe.

I grew up in the South and this is not the mac&cheese I remember.  I thought this was pretty bland and it didn't look appetizing at all.  We ate it because that is what I had made for dinner but the remainder got tossed.

This was very loose when it was first made.  Definitely better the following day because it held it's shape.  Next time I plan on using 16 oz. cottage cheese and 16 oz. cheddar cheese because I prefer a stronger cheese taste.

This is very close to a favorite recipe from a diner in Western North Carolina. I did not find it dry at all. I used large curd cottage cheese so maybe smaller curds make a drier dish. I thought it was delicious and I'll be making it again soon!

It pretty much doesn't get any better than this mac and cheese. Once I was given this recipe by a friend, I've never gone back to any other way of making it. My family LOVES it, it's the perfect comfort food! We like to eat it with Sloppy Joes. Only thing I do different is omit the spices on here & use garlic salt to taste, and I only use 2 eggs. If you want to make it healthier(ha ha, as if mac and cheese could ever be healthy!!!) use whole wheat macaroni, lowfat cottage cheese, lowfat sour cream, reduced fat shredded cheddar....you seriously will NOT miss the extra fat, it is just as yummy! Nothing better than a bowl of warm, gooey, good ole' mac and cheese!!!

Living in South Carolina, for awhile, I've come across SEVERAL "Southern" Macaroni and Cheese recipes- none of which compare to this! This is what I remember as a kid! Although, I didn't use the full 16 ounce cantainer of sour cream- maybe about half and like other comments before mine- I am a cheese lover! The more the merrier! I used 2 cups of cheese as my starting point and added more as desired. Caught my Aunts husband scrapping the side of the dish to get the remaining fork full.  Nothing was left over.

Good basic recipe- easy to change to suit your family's taste buds!  I use 16oz of cottage cheese and double the amount of cheddar.  I also use a dash of garlic salt, a bit of onion salt, some parsley and regular ground pepper for flavor.  This is also good if you add fresh green onions and celery.  If you want it as a meal, add some chopped up ham or johnsonville brats!!!  My family loves it EVERY time I make it...never the same way twice.

Super easy and super yummy.  This was a big hit with the kids and adults alike.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so used Cajun seasoning instead and also went with the suggestion to only use 16 ounces of cottage cheese.  I definitely plan on using this for potlucks and as a staple at family dinners since it's comfort food that even the pickiest eater will love.

Very good I made this on the stove top, didn't have the time to bake it. Will try next time. I did add some Louisiana hot sauce, splash of Worcestershire, and black pepper.

This was ok.  Since I like cottage cheese more than cheddar, I made the recipe as stated.  I guess I was expecting something a little creamier, this was very solid when it was done.  If I ever make again, I might leave out the eggs and bake just enough to heat it through.

This was not very good. I am from the South and I understand what it was trying to achieve, but it did not make it. I will be using my regular method with ricotta, cheddar and eggs next time. As with the other reviews, maybe it will taste better tomorrow. Live and Learn...........

This was an excellent dish! To be honest, when something carries the word Southern in the title you always have to take that with a grain of salt (pun intended). There are so many variations of recipes in the south. I am sure this is one variation.
It is good and everyone wolfed it down. My sister thought it had too much red pepper but I liked it fine. Will probably make again.

My family loves this version of Mac and Cheese. The cottage cheese and sour cream lend a nice twist to the boxed versions. I did add extra cheddar as my family loves the cheese half of Mac and Cheese. I've found I can add many kinds of cheese to this recipe, not just cheddar. This recipe has given a new life to the typical (boring) version of the recipe, thank you!!

So so so so good! My kids plowed their food back in minutes! 
I added sautéed peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, onion, garlic and chicken. Eventhough there is a ton of cheese to begin with I still added extra garlic and herb cheese on the top. One casserole I added buffalo sauce. All turned out great!! Will definitely make this dish again!

Easy, quick, simple, and tasy mac-n-cheese option. Way better than pre-made stuff at the grocery of heaven forbid the box stuff. My family of four loved it. Reheat during the week for a quick dinner side.

Made this today for my family and they loved it. I changed a couple things by using only half of the sour cream and I doubled the cheese the recipe called for. Added some garlic powder, salt and pepper for taste since it was pretty bland when I sampled it. Topped with colby the last 5 minutes and took the foil off. Overall, it was good but the next time I will use more than one cheese. Sharp cheddar was okay but it would have been off the charts with a combination!

Eh.  Just ok.  It didn't have much cheese flavor (I even used extra sharp) and was overall bland (I even used a little extra cayenne).  I don't recall ever having 'southern' mac and cheese so perhaps this is representative of what that dish should taste like.  But if that's the case I guess I'm not a fan of southern macaroni and cheese!
