I made this according to the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  The onion and celery add complexity to the overall flavor which sets this cranberry condiment apart from similar recipes.  Thank you for sharing this!

A nice change from "your usual cranberry sauce". I found it works best with sweet white onions, and I cut the sugar in half, which came out just right for my taste.  To reduce the "sharp" onion taste (if you are concerned about the onions), a little more work is required: start roasting the onions in about 1 teaspoon of oil first in the pot, then, when the onions are light golden brown, add the white sugar and lightly caramelize. Then add the water and the other ingredients as the original recipe calls for. That way, the onions release their full sweetness, while the edge is taken off.  I also think, adding about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander would spice it up a bit, but I have not tried that yet myself.

Really, Really Good!!  BUT... I think it works best as a cranberry sauce.  I was looking for an actual chutney to serve as an appetizer and this was a little too over the top alone.  I DO think it will be great with Thanksgiving dinner & I will definately on making it again!!

UPDATE:  OK so my bad!!  It really does need to sit over night to chill and firm up a little.  Next day = 5 Stars!!  YUM-O

Wow!!! This is great stuff!!! With fresh cranberries in hand I started searching for the perfect recipe and I believe this is it. I almost skipped over it because of the onions and celery, but I am so glad I took a chance.The flavor and texture is wonderful. The only things I changed is that I didn't have fresh ginger and had to use powered and instead of water I used orange juice to add a bit more flavor and I love nuts so I threw in 3/4 c. of pecans. I will be making this as long as I can get my hands on fresh cranberries. Thank you for this flavorful chutney.

I just made this to serve with rosemary chicken the other night. It is delicious, different and so lovely with poultry. Will make again. I did as written. Don't be afraid of the minced onions and celery. It is a wonderful flavor and balance. You will love it.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was by FAR the best Cranberry Sauce I ever had. As I was making it for the holiday I thought I would go for more sweet, and less savory, so I skipped the onion and celery. But I followed everything else to the letter.  The cloves & fresh ginger were a wonderful addition! Thank you so much for the recipe. I will use it every year

Very good. I did leave out the onion and celery though. Next time I will only make half as it makes quite a bit.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving meal. A very refreshing alternative to "typical" cranberry relish. I did not have celery, so I added a little extra apple instead. Delicious! I may leave out the celery in the future because I'm not crazy about it anyway. Think I may add some walnuts instead. Yum!

I'm a vegan so I served this with smoked tempeh and it was AWESOME. It would be a perfect entree for a vegan Thanksgiving celebration. I am not a big fan of cooked fruit, but something possessed me to buy fresh, local, organic cranberries when I saw them at the store. I'm so glad that I came across this recipe and I wouldn't change a thing (except that I briefly processed the berries prior to cooking, rather than cooking them whole).

I made this last Thanksgiving and impressed my entire family.  I had never made a chutney before, but this was easy and really good.  This chutney is sweet, tart, spicy and delicious.  I will be making this every year on Turkey Day.

Delicious!  I actually cut back on the sugars by about half, and my family said it was just perfect.  I served it on the Actually Delicious Turkey burgers, and added about 3 TBSP of the chutney to the meat mixture.  Had a time keeping my daughter out of it before dinner!  I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this today, with the thought of using it instead of traditional cranberry sauce. I love it! This recipe is a winner. Update: Since I wrote this review almost one year ago, I have found that this chutney enhances the flavors of any meat. Add it to a cracker or toast with any spreadable cheese, and it makes a tasty appetizer. Adding my favorite hot sauce to it gives it an entirely new and wonderful dimension. I have halved the amount of onion and celery and used it atop a whole cheesecake, to add beauty and flavor. It's great warmed and served over ice cream, or as a crepe filling with Nutella and whipped cream. Thank you for sharing this versatile and delicious recipe. I look forward to continuing to enjoy  it for years to come.

I loved this!  Nice change from regular store bought cranberry sauce.  Now that the canned stuff has High Fructose Corn Syrup (like all food manufactured in the US these days!), I'll be making my own cranberry relishes, sauces, and chutneys.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe. I have not tasted chutney before, but this was fresh, crunchy, sweet sour goodness. Great on turkey sandwiches and mixed in my chicken salad recipe. Thank You! I will be making this for the holidays for now on.

Made as directed.  My husband wouldn't eat it because he could  taste the onions.  I think next time I will omit onions for him and it will still be excellent.

It is good, but the cooking instructions were off. It needed more time to simmer than the recipe instructed. I think all the ingredients could have been added at once. The apples especially took longer to cook, so why add them later? Good flavours though, and we'll see if it's a hit with the turkey.

Believe it or not, this chutney is great with a bread pudding! I had this combination in a small restaurant in the Smokey Mountains where the owner made all her own dishes from scratch. I couldn't believe the chutney had onions in it, but it was wonderful with that bread pudding!

I've made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas for a few years now, and simply put it is wonderful. It has become known as 'my' cranberry sauce that my family now expects every year (with due credit to you folks of course!). The only modification I make is to not add cloves since my father hates them, and I think it's nice either way. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years now and we enjoy it year round ( great on waffles instead of syrup ).  Like the others have mentioned, the sugar amounts should be adjusted to taste.  My spice amounts are always more generous than the recipe specifies.   This is still one of my most repeated dishes from Allrecipes.

I really liked the combination of flavors represented in the list of ingredients, but for my taste, there was way too much sugar.  With the sweetness of the raisins and the apple, I cut out the white sugar entirely and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and some pecans and walnuts to the mix.  And, I thought it lacked acid, so I added juice and zest from one orange.  I am making it again today to go with Easter ham, and thought I might try apple cider vinegar for the acid.  My husband and I love it!

We've decided that this is a new tradition for our Thanksgiving Turkey. Most of us love jellied cranberry sauce - but were won over by the wonderful complex blends with ginger and raisins and cinnamon.

Yummy! Didn't add the celery and onions. Used oj instead of water. Wasn't exact with the spices. I will definitely use this recipe again. It was a favorite at Thanksgiving - no leftovers, and several requests for the recipe.

Absolutely outstanding. The only change I made was to replace the water with apple cider and the onion with shallots. As good as it was alongside the hot turkey, where it really shines is in a cold turkey sandwich with Miracle Whip. A keeper for sure.

The aroma was delicious as it simmered! Kept going over to stir it just because of it's smell : )  I served this with brie and crackers for an appetizer.  Also substituted the water for orange juice and added 1/4 c chopped pecans.

Made exactly as written and LOVE this!!! And I cannot say that chutney is ever really on my radar, so I am super happy that I gave it a try! I was just looking for something a little different for Thanksgiving. I haven’t even served it yet, but my husband and I both loved our taste test, and cannot wait until our guests get here so we can try it with the whole meal. I am surprised that no one has mentioned how great it smells while simmering (of course more so before adding the onion ;). Thanks for this recipe!
**post dinner update:  Everyone really liked this, including the older teens and early twenty-somethings!! :) we even had some fun guessing the “unexpected” ingredient (celery). The one that finally guessed it does not like celery, but asked to take some of the leftovers home....I call that a winner!!**

I grew up eating cranberry goo from a can and thought I'd have it for the rest of my adult life. However, now that I have a toddler, I wanted to try something healthier and unique. I'm so glad I tried this! My toddler loved this, as did my husband and I. I was nervous about the onions in it but the flavors turned out incredible. It was easy to make as well. Thank you so much for sharing this!

I made this without adding any sugar because I could not find fresh or frozen cranberries, so rather than ditch the recipe I bought a can of whole berry cranberry sauce as a substitute. Knowing that canned cranberries are sweetened already I figured I would omit the sugar and then adjust it if I found it too tart. It was not too tart and I did not need to add any sugar. I made it a day ahead in case it was awful and I had to make something to bring instead. Not only did it turn out, it is outstanding and I could just sit here with a baguette and some brie and stuff myself. I plan on serving it in a baked brie in phyllo.
Next time I hope to have fresh cranberries but seriously this was delicious even with the substitution and I would recommend this to anyone. A 5 star recipe for sure.

This is a unique chutney. It would be a great accompaniment to sandwiches, roasted poultry, or even as a quick appetizer with a cream cheese block and crackers. If your are looking for a sweet/savory twist on a cranberry riff...this is your recipe.

I made it according to the recipe and doubled it for 6 people. By the end of the Holiday weekend there was only a small amount left. I had planned on canning the remainder but guess I’ll have to make a new batch. I’ve had good success in water bath canning chutney and then we have it available all the time.

This is a great recipe. The first time I made it exactly as written, and we enjoyed it immensely. It was just a little too sweet for it to be perfect though. The next time I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also made a little change to the water. I used 7/8 cup water and 1/8 cup spiced rum; sensational. This has now become a staple, and we don't wait for a holiday to make it. Even my cranberry hating son loves this dish. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my 3rd Thanksgiving making this - the first was for something fun to do with cranberry since the majority of our family does not eat jellied cranberry sauce. Now, it is THE requested side dish FROM the family. I make it as is, though I made 1.5 recipes this year - one to take to the dinner and one off

Made this today smells and looks wonderful.
Only question I have is if all the whole cranberries are supposed to pop or are some supposed to have just cracked? I have never used fresh cranberry before so I wasn't sure.
Will update with a taste test after the holiday!

Great flavor! I halved the recipe, cut back the sugar and used  powder ginger since my fresh ginger root was used up in another recipe. I agree with a previous reviewer that this is more of a cranberry sauce than a chutney. Will make this again as my go-to cranberry recipe!

I was concerned about the onion but don't be - this turned out great.  It sets up over time.   My cooled in frig for 7 hours rather than overnight - consistency and flavors were fine. Everyone at the table loved it.

I have made this for the past 3 Thanksgivings.  Was just trying to add something new to the mix.  Am I glad I did!  This was made exactly as written.  Absolutely delicious .  Nice balance of flavors.  Had purchased a nice creamy  gorgonzola cheese last night, made the chutney this morning.  Toasted up some baguette today with a smear the gorgonzola and a dollop of the chutney!  It was a big hit!  Think I'm going to end up making a new batch for Thanksgiving.  Thank you Foodelicious

I made it pretty much as directed but the package of cranberries was only about 3 cups so I reduced the ingredients slightly.  I only had whole cloves so I put some in my coffee grinder and it worked well.

Everyone loved it, except one stubborn person who prefers canned!  I did sub some asian pear I had from my sister's orchard once; it was fine that  way too!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It sounded like a lot of sugar so I cutback the white sugar to 1/4 cup; it's a bit tart so some may not like it but it's still excellent! To accommodate those who will not eat onion in any way, shape or form (and who will find the minutest piece) I left out the onion. I love a bit of crunch in my chutney so added chopped pecans to half and left them out of the second one.

Very good, but it was too sweet and a little bland for me.  The second time I made it, I cut the sugar by half, added the juice of one orange and a tablespoon of orange zest.  I also added cardamom powder, a pinch of mace and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the cranberries as they cooked down.  I preferred it this way, but it is an individual thing.  Thank you for the base recipe!

I used a combo of fresh squeezed orange juice and apple juice in place of the water and added the zest of none orange. I recently made a batch of Masala Chai so rather than measureing out the spices, I just used a couple heaping tablespoons of that. I was super skeptical of the onions but decided to trust the recipe. It turned out fantastic! This recipe is easy to tweak and scrumptious. Definitely will be making it again.

I'm giving this a 5 because so many people like it. I ,of course, had to change it for my taste. Didn't use raisins, onions or celery. Did use some orange and the zest. Its cooking right now but it taste really good. Am having to cook longer to get apple done.

Made this last year for Thanksgiving, everyone loved it, even the kids. In place of water I used orange juice and added  orange zest after cooking. Made a double batch today. Used canning jars and processed in water bath for 10 minutes. Now we can have it even after cranberry season.

Great chutney! I know the ingredients don't sound like they would be great together but they really are! They all balance perfectly and make a great chutney. I highly suggest making it as written, you won't be dissapointed.  I sauteed the onions until golden then added the sugar then added the rest of the ingredients.  I found the cinnamon to be a little too much.  Will make with half the amount next time and maybe a little more ginger for my taste..

Made this at Thanksgiving and am making it again to go with my holiday ham.  Love it!  I used only brown sugar and decreased it to taste.  Also added some chopped, ripe pears which adds to the taste and crunch!

Luscious! I didn't have Granny Smith apples or celery, but did add about 1/2 chayote squash for the crunch factor. A little sweet, so I added about 2 tsp. of pomegranate balsamic vinegar, which made it the just right blend of sweet-tart that I like. Wonderful!

Added a little more vinegar. Otherwise followed recipe. Then put in small canning jars and processed  it in a water bath 30 minutes. Everyone who tries it loves it.

thanks! i loved this recipe and modified it to be more like a chutney.  I added minced super hot chiltepin peppers fresh from my garden, minced candied ginger, plus more powdered ginger, instead of water I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and I used half the sugar, using coconut sugar instead of white or brown sugar.  coconut sugar is lower glycemic index and a lot like brown sugar.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was requested again for Christmas dinner this year. My whole family loved it. I served leftovers with French bread and brie, and my guests really enjoyed that too. Thanks for the recipe!
