Give boring potato salad a very fine kick. If you like blue cheese, you will love this one.

Everyone raved about this salad. We took it to a July 3rd fireworks show and then served the leftovers at a July 4th family gathering....those that raved about it on the 3rd said it was even better on the 4th. It was gone in no time. We did reduce the salt by about half and I sprinkled a little celery salt into the mayo/sour crm mixture because I had no celery seed at the moment.  Great salad.

I've made this recipe for 2 different parties lately.  It disappeared fast and I had tons of people asking me for the recipe.  They said it tastes like the potato salad from Red Hot & Blue

I am not a huge potato salad fan, but this was the best I've ever had!  Even my picky husband liked it.  I would make it again for company.

I love blue cheese dressing & crumbled blue cheese in salads but I just wasn't crazy about this combo.  The blue cheese taste just seemed overpowering in this dish.

Excellent twist--even the "plain janes" in my family liked it!  Iincreased the vinegar slightly, but otherwise kept to the recipe. Very subltle taste of blue cheese.

This is my favorite potato salad recipe. One reason is because it's lighter due to the use of sour cream vs mayo. I add some salt to the water when I boil the potatoes to season them sightly. Don't overcook the potatoes or they will fall apart when you mix in the dressing. It's a good idea to stop cooking the potatoes about a minute or two before they are perfectly tender. This potato salad tastes even better the second day!

This potato salad is incredible!  I made it just tonight for an upcoming Labor Day party and I couldn't resist have a bite to test it out.  My boyfriend suggested I make something else to take to the party so we could keep all of this potato salad to ourselves!  We're both blue cheese lovers and I used a high quality Danish blue, which is generally very piquant, but the flavor of the blue cheese did not in any way overshadow the potatoes or the green onions.  I left out the celery because I usually find that the celery flavor is overpowering and makes everything it touches taste like celery.  The little bit of celery seed is just enough to add some flavor but not make everything taste like celery.  I hope that the other comments are correct in saying that this potato salad is even tastier a few days after it has a chance to sit.  I purposely made it today so it would have 48 hours to refrigerate and blend the flavors.  I have to compete with my dad's excellent "secret recipe" potato salad and I think I have the edge this year.  

I would suggest mixing the sauce ingredients first so the spices get evenly distributed.

We enjoyed this - found that it got better the longer it sat in the frig - so it is a good make ahead of time salad - two or three days ahead of time would do.

A real treat for bleu cheese lovers.  Got rave reviews when I made this for a crowd over the 4th of July weekend.

A terrific twist on an old standby! For fun, we made this dish for a Memorial Day event with red, white, and "blue" (actually, they were dark purple) potatoes. We also added some crumbled, cooked bacon to the top. Next time, we'll probably reduce the salt just a bit, but it was otherwise perfect.

i am not overly fond of mustardy potato salad, so this was just perfect.  the combonation of blue cheese and onion provided a great, unique flavor.  it was well received at the barbeque i made it for.
