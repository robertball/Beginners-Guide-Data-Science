I used this recipe for a Brunch baby shower. I omitted the bacon. (veggie group) I was a little nervous when I took it out of the oven and started cutting it. It was watery in the center. But once it cooled a bit the water absorbed back into the pie. It was so tasty!

This was Amazing!! A keeper for sure.  I used mozzerella and cheddar instead of feta. My family really enjoyed it and it was gone in no time.  Also for a crispier crust I recomend popping the pastry in a preheated oven for about 5 mins

This was a great recipe. I made the recipe exactly as written. I didn't personally like the bacon, and would probably use a milder cheese instead if the feta. My husband loved it!!

Amazing! This had a ton of flavor. The only thing I did different was that I sauteed the onions & mushrooms in leftover fat from the bacon. Will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe - was a big hit with all my friends.  The only thing I did different was make it with a phyllo pastry crust and mozza cheese.  Making it for girls weekend soon

I had some asparagus, mushrooms and bacon leftover from the other quiches I made for Easter brunch so I threw this together too.  It was very tasty, not a slice was left.

MMMMMM!  The mushrooms and feta cheese make this taste amazing. 3 of my 4 kids devoured it and asked for seconds...that says something. My son even had it for lunch the next day reheated in the oven. I did add extra feta and cheddar. My husband says its a keeper!

This quiche was great. Easy to make and tasted wonderful. I have also experimented with adding different veggies, herbs and spices to the recipe. Great as-is or as a starting place for gastromic adventures. Thanks, Larry

Absolutely delicious! We made it with vegetarian bacon because I'm a vegetarian, and my omnivorous boyfriend enjoyed it. The only problem we faced was that the mixture with two eggs didn't seem enough to fill our pie-dish, so we doubled up on the egg/cream mixture. This gave us a nice, deep, light quiche. We may have needed more because we went crazy on the vegetables (yay for asparagus season!), but I felt the filling was a bit skimpy. Maybe three eggs?

Absolutely wonderful quiche. I took one to work weeks ago and I still get comments about the wonderful brunch I brought. I had to copy the recipe to everyone.

Awesome recipe, making it again while typing this review.  Really easy to make 2 because most of the quantities sold at the store (bundle of asparagus, 2 cup bag of cheese, 6 oz feta etc.) can be devided into two perfectly, and after you make it once, you will make it again.

This was my first quiche ever--making or eating. Awesome. Delicious. I'm making again this week! A few changes because of what I had on hand... I used fresh shallot shoots instead of an onion, part 2% milk and whipping cream, added an extra egg, and extra bacon. I also threw all of the veggies in the bacon grease and cooked that way. I left out the salt, and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Trust me, you won't even know it's in there.

Meah, kind of watery, and the egg mixture was scant when I poured it on before putting it in the oven.  Try 3 eggs and 1 cup half & half instead.  I used cremini mushrooms, frozen wheat pie crust (pre-baked for 5 minutes) and added truffle salt and it was still just average.  The cheddar & feta made it tasty, but I will try another asparagus quiche recipe next time.

This is unbelievably yummy! Everyone I make this for loves it including my husband. If you do not have mushrooms or asparagus, keep in mind that it is still fabulous when substituted with other veggies from your garden.

Super recipe.  I've tried it as written and modified it occasionally based on what I've had on hand.  Most of the time I use 1/4c milk instead of the half and half and I increase the feta to 1/2c while decreasing the shredded cheese to 1/2c.  Hubby likes about 1 tsp of red pepper flake mixed in and then french fried onions sprinkled on top the last 20 minutes of baking so I usually throw those on there too.  However, this recipe as written is excellent as well!

SUPER GOOD!  Definitely will make again.  Cut the butter by 1/2. Used less oil. Fresh garlic is not overpowering when browned.  Wonderful as leftovers as well.

This was delish. I did make a few changes. I only had sliced button mushrooms,added several more pieces of bacon,did not use the egg white wash but did pre bake the pie shell,used shredded swiss cheese with the feta, and added an additional egg as mine were of medium size. I did add some thyme for additional flavor. Good for snack or a meal!

Really great, simple recipe! I made this for Mother's Day lunch and it was my first quiche ever so I didn't want to mess it up! Luckily this recipe was super easy to follow and quick to make. I did not add bacon (don't like it) and added some garlic salt to the veggies as I was cooking them. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the T and it came out so delicious, and is even better the next day! I'm excited to try all sorts of varieties of this recipe now that I've made my first quiche!

I made one as written and 2 mini ones without the bacon. Either way this was delicious. I finely chopped the onion just because that's the only way my youngest daughter will eat it. Even my husband enjoyed this and he says he doesn't like asparagus. Thanks for a great recipe Grits Girl.

This was my first time making quiche.  The pie crust came out mushy and without the bacon, I don't think it would have any flavor.

Amazing!  Other then using a large shallot instead of a small onion I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.

Well, I was rated "gourmet" breakfast maker by my friends! It was delicious! I did increase the eggs though- I used 4. Aside from that, kept it pretty much to what the recipe said and well, "gourmet" says it all!

Just awesome! I did as other suggested and baked the empty pie shell for 5 minutes before filling. I also sautéed the asparagus with the other veggies, versus boiling. Omitted the bacon as I didn't have it. Substituted milk for cream. Even with all this, still delicious!

Ever since I made this the first time, I only double it from here on out because we always want more when it's done! The best quiche I have ever had. I sauté the veggies in remaining bacon grease but keep everything the same! I can't wait until mine gets out of the oven! Yummy!!!

This was a "man's" quiche - full of lots of good bacon, cheese, and other good stuff!  My husband loved it and so did I.  I had everything I needed, except I was short on feta cheese, having only about 1/8 cup, so I shredded some smoked gouda and sprinkled that over everything.  I served a chardonnay with this along with fresh strawberries and blueberries - it made a perfect dinner!

This is AWESOME!! I wanted to use up the asparagus before it went bad, grabbed some sour cream and ricotta (in lieu of the feta) and made it for dinner last night. We also skipped the bacon, to lessen the sodium and nitrates that neither one of us need. My wife LOVED it, (actually, she pronounced it divine) and so did I!

Very easy to assemble and bake. Let it set for about 10 minutes to firm it up. Have a small salad to accompany it, and enjoy!

as always I am looking for ways to use up leftovers. So here I took this basic recipe and added 1/2 lb homemade sausage instead of bacon. I did not have any onions so I added extra mushroom and onion powder. I also took the other reviews in mind and added 6 eggs as my pie plate was a deep dish. Added cheese on top. Smells great!

What a great quiche and easy to make. Just a little time and love. This is my second attempt at making this. The first time followed the recipe and it turned out so good that I only shared 2 slices with my wife. This time we will share it equally. I kept the spirit of the recipe and added to it with a little ham, pepperoni and spinach.

I upped the seasoning with chopped fresh thyme and rosemary, a couple tablespoons of dijon mustard, and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a double recipe. Cooked mushrooms, onions and asparagus in bacon drippings per other reviewers. Prebaked the crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling. I also used more feta and less cheddar per personal taste, and our guests loved it as much as I did.

I love this recipe and have made it several times with one big change - Brussel sprouts cut in half instead of asparagus.  the taste is less bitter and the texture is less stringy.  Just boil for 2 minutes so they bake to softness.  I also use turkey bacon to be healthier and it tastes so good with the mushrooms and egg mixture.  This is one of my go to recipes and leftovers as just as good!

This was delicious -- I've made quiche before, but the addition of the asparagus was inspired.  I did change it up a bit: instead of bacon, I used bits of shredded boiled ham (less grease), left out the mushrooms (too heavy a taste for me), and my cheese was gruyere, my favorite for a quiche.  I also added a dash of grated nutmeg, so good in egg dishes.  It was Yummy!  PS:  It's good to let the dish sit for 10-15 minutes after baking, to let it "set".  Brought this to work and people swooned.

Made this AS IS and was surprised how delicious is was. The little bit of feta made such an amazing additional tangy flavor! I also liked that it didn't call for a lot of eggs - it turned out a nice, delicate texture and flavor instead of a dense, scrambled egg dish - leftovers for breakfast were to die for! The only changes you could say I made were that I used sliced baby bellas and instead of blanching my asparagus (they were a bit large), I fried them along with the mushrooms and onions. Since the filling was so warm to start with (from the frying), this had the pleasant affect of the dish being done after only 15 minutes of baking. Definitely wouldn't "change" a thing!

I have made this quiche many times, my husband and I both love it. We have vegetarian friends and make it without the bacon also, you never know the difference. This is great for any occasion from a company brunch a party or dinner for two. Left overs are delicious the next day!

Omg good! Omit crust. Lightly sautéed Red Pepper subbed for Asparagus. White shrooms, on hand. 5 whole eggs. 3 Green onions, needed using.. Butter vs oil. 1/4 - 1/3 c Real* bacon pieces. Italiano cheese mix. 1/2 c extra thick home-made skim milk (from powder) works great. Garlic, sautéed, optional. Forgot the cheese so  it was sprinkled on top of the eggs. Will do the same from now on! Served with flaxseed bread, toasted. Delish!

Of course I made changes... used white mushrooms and Swiss cheese instead of feta.  Sauted asparagus with other veggies.  Substituted half evaporated milk and half whole milk for cream.   It turned out well and my real man ate it!

I made two of these.  First one, I forgot to put the cheese on before put the egg mixture on.  It still came out well and was easy to put & serve.  The second one, I mixed all the ingredients together and put it in the pie shell.  That one did not go well--the pie basically had no structure.  The taste for both was very good, but not outstanding.

My only changes to this recipe were adding more pepper and a bit of cayenne pepper to the egg mixture.  It was delicious and my husband loved it.  Next time I will go lighter on the onions.

Very easy recipe and a great way to use up asparagus. I used swiss cheese for the shredded cheese variety.  Using thicker cut bacon meant I didn't have to use as much.  I just used 3 slices cut up in chunks. A basic tart recipe for the crust made it even better.

Loved this. A few changes: I  left out the bacon, sauteed the onions, mushrooms and steamed (for 2 minutes) asparagus in butter.  One more change: I always use Carnation Milk in place of half & half in quiches - it gives it a wonderful flavour. Other than that, I followed this recipe. It was outstanding! Will definitely become part of the quiche rotation!

I used lizzie's idea and used phyllo pastry when I couldn't find, and didn't want to make a pie/tart crust. Such Flaky Goodness!  :-) I didn't use feta cheese, and I used mozzarella... I'm sure your favorite cheese will work well in this. I added about a half-cup of sour cream with my cheese, 3 eggs, 1 egg white, mixed that all together and topped that on the veggies, and I added a few sliced black olives.  Make sure you place a cookie sheet below your pie, it will bubble and drip a bit while cooking.
