My husband and I cooked this tonight and it was so good!!! The burgers turned out juicy and tasty. We didn't cook them for 5 minutes on each side, like the recipe said. We did 3 minutes on each side on 450 degree grill and they came out 140 degrees. We will definitely be making these again!

This is my recipe... Looks like cooking time got changed somehow... not sure how but my original recipe says 3 mins per side... 5 will tend to dry them out so be careful when grilling Bison... it is very lean and should be cooked much like turkey. Take care and enjoy.  ;  )

I didn't have a grill so they are pan fried in a little olive oil. Added sweet and spicy BBQ sauce in place of the hot sauce and muenster cheese.... Delicious!

First time cooking with bison so thankful for this great recipe. I've heard bison can get dry because it's so lean, but the egg, Worcestershire, and breadcrumbs seemed to bind it together nicely and keep it from drying out. Made just as described except added some salt to the formed patties. The burgers were super flavorful. Turns out I like bison so look forward to making this again.

We made these on the grill. Based on a review from another reviewer who reported that the burgers tasted heavily of bread and fell apart when grilled, I cut the breadcrumbs to 1/3 cup. They tasted great, but unfortunately also fell apart on the grill for us.

I've never had this issue before when making bison burgers without bread crumbs and will probably leave them out next time.

I did not add Tabasco (as most people in my family don't like spicy), and I used unseasoned breadcrumbs as that is what I had.  Everyone enjoyed them.  They were moist and flavorful.  Stayed together very well.   Would definitely make again.

I used this recipe to make bison sliders. The meat was so juicy! I had never cooked bison before, I was afraid it would be hard to work with. But this was great! Can't wait to do it again!

But this recipe is too good not to rate just because I used regular bread crumbs. 
It was THE best bison burger we ever had. It was tasty, juicy and with just enough of a  kick. This is our new go-to recipe. I think it will be great on ground beef as well. 
Thank you so much for sharing.

Very tasty burger. I used 24 oz of ground bison and 7 dashes of Tabasco, but will add more next time. I didn't have panko, so I left it out. We didn't miss it. Will make again.

I normally overcook lean meat but this recipe was easy and delicious. Followed recipe exactly apart from cheddar cheese. Grilled at least 3 mins per side, burgers were very juicy and I preferred them to beef.

Amazing burgers!! I've never seen my 2 & 4 yr old eat their dinner so quickly lol. I made 2 changes, unintentionally: at the last minute I found out we were having guests for dinner so I added 1/3 lb of ground beef 80/20%, but didn't alter the amount of other ingredients. Also, a storm blew in & grilling wasn't possible so I threw them in the oven for 15 minutes. It made 8 medium sized patties. I can hardly wait to make them again! Super juicy & delicious, 2 thumbs up!

Just made them for my son and I. Very moist and juicy. I added a little minced onion, needed no extra salt or seasonings but may try different spices next time.
I pan fried them in a little olive oil then put some provolone cheese on top. DELICIOUS !!!!!

This was deliciousl I used only a tablespoon or so of bread crumbs and maybe a tad more  pepper and garlic powder. Also substituted cheddar for the American cheese and served it straight (with no bun). It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. We definitely will make it again! I know the originator of this recipe has posted that it should only be 3 minutes a side, but we needed the full 5 minutes on our grill (though I also made only 3 burgers, rather than 4, which might have affected the cooking time).

I have replaced ground beef in my rotation with bison. Most of the time thought I make it into meat sauce, because there's so little fat that you can't make a meatloaf and/or a burger. This recipe called for the addition of an egg and Panko. Couldn't find Panko in the pantry so I use an equal amount of Matzoh Meal; which has no seasoning in it an I left out the hot sauce. They were delicious and I made them on my grill pan following the rest of the directions. Thank for submitting this. I've saved it to my recipe box.

We used 2 lbs ground bison and the egg and seasonings, but skipped the bread crumbs.  Also added in a chopped piece of bacon to the meat mixture (my husband got creative).  These were outstanding.

Made these for a family cookout. They were wonderful.
Love that they didn’t dry out on the grill. Everyone loved them, even the kids. We left out the hot sauce, but will probably add it next time.

I did not add quite as much panko as the recipe suggested after reading the reviews. The burgers were low in fat and very tasty. I let the patties rest in the refrigerator for an hour and they did not crumble. We will make again.

The flavor was good, but I had to add some salt, and it had way too much Panko. I would recommend trying 1/4 cup instead.

I love this recipe...the bison burgers came out so so juicy. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I added some Dijon mustard like someone mentioned and I added a few extra dashes of tobassco sauce. I would say it needed a tad bit more seasoning but it's ok... we still scarfed them down.

This recipe wasn't good at all.  Tasted too much of bread and was soggy.  The burgers fell apart on the grill.  Not to our liking.  Was a waste of good and expensive bison meat.

This did come out juicy.  I would change couple things.
Unfortunately it lacked flavor. I would add some salt as whatever salt from sauce wasn't enough. 
I did use mince garlic which helped but I will add chopped onions to the mix as that always makes my regular burgers incredible with infused flavor.

My go to  recipie for bison burgers. Very easy to follow or improvise seasonings. The bread crumbs and egg are the trick to making bison moist & hold together well.

YUMMY!!! I now use this recipe for ALL of my burgers. It is particularly good with Buffalo and Turkey because they come out so moist every time. It works well with lamb and beef as well but the higher fat content can cause flare-ups so they are best grilled with indirect heat.

It's also easy and fun to add a different sauce to the mix (e.g. Dijon mustard) to give a different flavor.

Make this recipe almost as outlined except used dairy free cheese and thinly sliced red onion and lettuce leaves.  So good and definitely will make again.

I see why it's 5 star rated. I usually tweak everything. Not this one. GOOD stuff!

I used regular, homemade breadcrumbs, omitted the Worcestershire sauce since we cannot have fish, and did not toast the buns. I also cooked it in a pan because of the freezing outside temperatures. With everything else the same, this was the most flavorful and juicy burger I have ever had. I made everyone at the table a believer in bison meat!

Recipe was good. But cooking time was a bit long for bison.  Bison should be pink inside and not over cooked.  I did five minutes a side and that was too long.  Next time I'll do four minutes.

No changes. It was moist and perfect.
Just make sure you use an oil  or cooking spray top and bottom of the patty when grilling.

We have been eating bison almost exclusively for over well over 3 years. I make our bison burgers very similar to this recipe. The differences are that I use seasoned bread crumbs instead of Panko crumbs, add more onion and garlic powder, skip the hot sauce, and make 3 burgers from the mix. I cook them in the NuWave oven at 420 degrees on the 3" rack for 3-4 minutes per side depending on the temperature of the meat. After the burgers are cooked, I add the cheese, and close the oven without turning it on again. When the cheese is melted, put the burgers on the bun halves and add preferred embellishments, i.e., onion, tomato, lettuce, etc. This is a great way to make juicy bison burgers. You may have to alter the cooking time  depending on your cooking method.

I didn't have garlic granules so used garlic salt.  The burgers were very flavorful and moist.

I added finely chopped shallots and a touch of seasoned salt. I cooked it for 4 minutes each side for medium to medium well.  This is a winner!

Good stuff. Season it well and bison will not disappoint you.
I did 2 eggs and put it in the fridge for 15 minutes before grilling.

Great base recipe. Added 1 tbls maple syrup and 1/3 c minced onion. Subbed cayenne for hot sauce and crushed crackers for bread crumbs as I didn't have either of the recipe items on hand. Tasty, moist and a hit at our BBQ - with adults and young kids alike!
