The rest of the non asparagus lovers loved this!  I, who love the stuff, didn't care for it at all. Also I found a lb of bread far too much and only used about 1/2 called for.  If I make it again I would slice the asparagus into 2-3inch pieces for easier scooping.

I made this sidedish because I needed a quick vegetable for a dinner pary I was having.  The guests really liked it!   The water chestnuts add a nice crunchy touch to the cassarole.  The 2nd time I made the recipe, I tried adding cubed bread crumbs without as much butter, but it didn't turnout as good as the original recipe.  So, I don't recommend any alterations to this recipe.  It is great just as it is and reheats nicely too!

It's awesome, I used fresh and cut some fat with the following:  Ingredients  1 pound of fresh, cut up asparagus or 1 (15 ounce) can asparagus, drained and cut up 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup 1 sm. can mushrooms 1/4 C dried onions or 1/2 C fresh onions chopped 1 cups shredded Cheddar cheese or what ever cheese you have on hand....I had pizza cheese 1/2 stick butter melted 8 oz. cubbed bread - I used about 4 stale hamburg buns 1/2 teaspoon pepper Directions  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray pan with oil.  Layer asparagus in the bottom of a medium baking dish. Top with drained mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup.  Add pepper and stir. Melt butter in a microwave safe large bowl for a minute or less. Slice bread into 1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes, and toss in the butter. When butter has been absorbed, layer bread in the baking dish on top of the veggies. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven 35 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.

I've tried this recipe a couple of times and modified it the second.  Both variations are delicious, but I find it makes the casserole a lot less heavy if you cut the amount of bread and butter in half.  The soup is still enough to pull it all together and keep the dish moist.  Overall, a delicious recipe either way - the asparagus and two cheeses are the best part!

I made this recipe with fresh asparagus for a Thanksgiving dinner at our club.  We served about 60 people total.  Everyone raved over this dish and I have had several requests for the recipe.

This is definately a mixed review. I made this for company and it was GONE! They absolutely loved it, but I didn't. Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and all I could taste was the butter. I recommend halfing the amount of bread and butter...it was just too much. I also recommend using fresh vegetables. By the time the casserole came out of the oven...the veggies were very soggy. So I didn't enjoy it yet, but this recipe is a good start and definately has potential!

This recipe is good but the vegetables need to be fresh to really taste great and take advantage of all the vitamins in the vegatables.  

I used fresh vegetables and added fresh mushrooms and it tasted great.

My husbands family has been making "asparagus casserole" for years.  Their version uses shredded american cheese, 1 1/2 cups crushed Club crackers, 1/2 cup of butter and no parmesan.  It's my favorite holiday dish and I don't even like canned asparagus.  Give it a try.

I don't care for asparagus but I live with a bunch of asparagus-lovers so I figured I'd give it a try.  I couldn't believe how much I liked this dish!  It was great and a super hit at dinner time.

I make this all the time, esp on holidays. But I short-cut this recipe and use pillsbury garlic bread strips, instead. They puff up niceley and make a wonderful crust! AND it's easier!

This is so good!  I made it for 50 people for a birthday dinner and it was the first thing to go.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I substituted another can of asparagus for the peas, since my family doesn't care for peas.  Delicious!

I made this but made a few changes!  First instead of using cream of mushroom I used cream of chicken (dont like mushroooms).  I left out the chestnuts.  Instead of using bread I used italian and regular bread crumbs, and sprinkled melted butter over bread crumbs.  Still used cheese.  Over all turned out great!!

Very good!  A little too much butter for my liking, however, it was easily adjusted.

This recipe truly is amazing!! I did make a few changes, however...I used 2 cans of asparagus to line the bottom of a 9x13 pan, and I added 2 (4 oz.) cans of sliced button mushrooms on top of the peas. Following other reviewer's suggestions, I also halved the amount of butter and used half the amount of english muffin bread from Safeway(I did not trim the crusts), and it was the perfect amount that way. The taste was excellent, a great combo of flavors, thank you so much for sharing the recipe!! I will definately make this again!

My cousin Kerri makes this recipe for all of our family gatherings and it is the most popular side dish of all!  There is never enough to go around!!  My husband who doesn't really care for most asparagus dishes loves this recipe!  It gets more than "two thumbs up" in our family!!

I don't know what to say about this but YUCK! Maybe if you used fresh asparagus instead of canned it might and I stress might taste a little better but why even chance it. YUCK!

This was a tasty sidedish.  But, I do not like canned asparagus.  Next time I would make it with fresh asparagus.  The canned became too soggy and soft to really enjoy.

This one won my husband over by surprise.  He swore he wouldn't touch it when he saw me putting it together, then he helped himself to seconds ate the table and warmed it up as leftovers!!  Kinda reminds me of Green Eggs and Ham, Sam!

This is a very good recipe. I liked it more than my wife (who doesn't like can peas). I did use fresh asparagus and only half cup of butter.  The topping was excellent.... but also remember that it is LOADED with butter!

This was pretty good, but it needs "something" to really take it over the top.  I used fresh asparagus and frozen peas to avoid them becoming complete mush during the baking process and this worked perfectly.  I also subbed cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom, because we don't care for the flavor of canned C.O.M. soup.  I think some sauteed garlic and onion layered directly on top of the asparagus would have been a big improvement, as well as perhaps a pinch of red pepper flakes.  We really enjoyed the crunch added by the water chestnuts and the crunchy, buttery, cheesy bread pieces on top were fantastic.  I followed a couple other reviewers' suggestions and cut the asparagus into 2-inch pieces and cut the bread into 1x2-inch strips to make it easier to scoop everything out onto our plates.  I'm sure we'll have this again, with the addition of some onion and garlic and possibly using cream of chicken soup next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I think this recipe would be better without the buttered bread crust as a topping. Letting the parmesan and cheddar brown and crust might be really good.

My wife really enjoyed seeing water chestnuts in a warm food for a change, they added a nice texture to the dish.

Maybe I cooked this wrong.... canned asparagus is awful compared to fresh. Umm the bread was too soggy and all in all it tasted like a bad goulash.. I might try again considering it had potential. Next time I will use fresh almost all the way cooked asparagus, use french fried onions mixed with butter on top instead of bread. Omit water chestnuts and add maybe zucchini or snap peas. And put cream of broccoli or cream of onion. But thats IF I make it again

I make this every year for Thanksgiving & just love it! I have never used Parmesan, just very sharp shredded cheddar & I no longer use buttered bread on top, though. I now use crushed crackers. I prefer a buttery-tasting cracker such as Ritz rather than Saltines. I also (doubling or tripling the recipe) use one or two cans of asparagus pieces & one or two cans of long spears with tips. The asparagus pieces help fill up the dish but are only a fraction of the cost of the whole spears. When increasing the recipe I also use another can of soup. I should add, I never use butter anywhere in this recipe.
