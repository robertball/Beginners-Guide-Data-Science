This is amazing! Served it as main appetizer at dinner party. My friend Michelle made it (can't take the credit) and used toasted walnuts and dates instead of pears & almonds. Also, we added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and used brandy instead of white wine. Delicious! Try it!

Thanks for the fab recipe, this was absolutely delicious! All the flavours complemented each other so well. My partner got sliced sourdough by mistake, but we still managed to make it work by gently squeezing it into a pan to hold the slices together. Otherwise, I made the recipe as posted and the four of us ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes!!

Edit 04 Jun 07 - Last two times I made this, to serve a couple more people, I used two brie, side by side with a little gap in between them, still in the one loaf of bread. I doubled all the other ingredients too, so there was more pear topping to add to the extra cheesey goodness!

This recipe was enjoyed by all at my party last night.  The only change I made was to use Hawaiian sweet bread, because I couldn't find a loaf of round sourdough at the store.  I would recommend puttng some foil on top about 30 minutes in to the baking since the bread did get quite dark and crispy on the outside.  It was still lovely, though.

This looks impressive and tastes divine! I made this at work so substituted the pear filling for half a jar of chutney - this made it a lot quicker to prepare. Everyone raved about it!

This was OK.  It did not knock my socks off.  Not sure why...it had all the ingredients to be a wonderful appetizer.  I have to say that eating the bread that the cheese is baked in is far better than any crackers.  THe sourdough bread toasted and was crunchy and good.  Maybe I should have used a larger round so I would have had more toasted bread to enjoy it with!  Oh and baking 45 minutes is way tooo long.  I did 20 and that was plenty.  Otherwise it is very runny, Had to let it set a bit before we ate it.  I will still search for more exciting appetizers in the future.

I tried to do this with puff pastry, rather than bread and the Brie “exploded” and melted all over the cookie sheet. So then, I remade the pear mixture and just heated a new wheel of brie and spooned the pear over top – it was really good! Also, I used dried thyme instead of fresh – a little less than 1/4 tsp. I will try this with the bread very soon!

I wrote the review on 1/12/09. If you use the puff pastry idea, it works best to bake in a Pyrex pie plate as one reviewer noted, it may "explode" on a baking sheet. Just let it cool for say 15 minutes before transferring to you serving plate and it will be fine. Still one of our favorite appetizers! Bon Appetit!  944TURBO

AWESOME RECIPE!!!  This was soooo YUMMY.  Bought it to a friend's house and it was GONE in no time.  Did not make any changes to the main ingredients, but I did use a puff pastry instead of the bread.  This one is a keeper!

This was good, but not as good as I thought it would be.  I wrapped the brie and the filling in puff pastry.  With the thyme and the pear flavors, tastes very much like an apple stuffing at Thanksgiving.  I did find that the flavors got a little muddled.  Have to say, the baked brie with rosemary and cherries is by far the best baked brie on Allrecipes.

This was one of the best recipes I have tried off this site. I used raspberry reisling for the wine because it is what I had on hand and it gave the pears a great sweet flavor that balanced well.  This was gone fast!

This was pretty good. Maybe I'm not a huge fan of thyme as a spice, that's all. The bread and brie were delicious and caramelized shallots and pears are always tasty. (If you don't have shallots, you can totally use a regular spanish onion.)

I've made this a couple of times now, and it is absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I changed was I wrapped the brie in puff pastry to make a brie en croute, and I think I used chopped walnuts instead of the almonds.  Delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  But I made some changes:  I increased the amount of thyme and didn't put it in the bread.  It turned out delicious and saucy.

It had good flavor but I wasn't crazy about the bread. I would go with a puff pastry next time. Also, I didn't feel like the pear gave enough sweetness to compliment the brie.I think it would be good with some apricot preserves. All in all it was good but will surely experiment some next time.

This is the first time I have made this recipe but the third time I’ve had the pleasure of tasting it. I doubled the amount of wine therefore it was on the stove top about 3 minutes longer. 
I also baked the mixture in a clear casserole dish as my home baked sourdough was still too warm to slice into. I personally know how this dish tastes when melted inside the bread. Next time I’ll make my sourdough bread a day ahead. 
The party guests are still talking about the “Brie” dish I brought to the party.

Really good.  I made without the bread and served with toasted french bread slices.  Looked very elegant and was not sweet at all.

This was crazy good! I didn't have shallots so I just used some slices of red onion. I used walnuts because that's what I had on hand. I used a loaf of chiabatta and sliced it so it would be pull apart bread, brushed it with olive oil, minced garlic, and herbs. I placed it in a casserole dish and baked covered for about a half hour. The flavor were so complex with the white wine and butter. The whole thing was gone in 10 minutes!

This was a lot of work to end up being just ok.  I felt that the brie and filling were overwhelmed by the bread.  The ratio was off; I would suggest using the puff pastry instead.  We couldn't figure out how to eat it, so we just sliced it - extra bread/crackers definitely weren't needed.

The pears were too sweet and I think it would have been the case even if less sugar was added.  The suggestion given to me was maybe try it with something else, even canned potatoes, or put the pears with something else.  I"ll pass on this one

Love this recipe! Served it at the holidays and it was a huge hit. It is very mild and creamy. It appealed to everyone at the party from kids to adults. I made it slightly sweeter by increasing the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon, and added some dried cranberries to give it a more festive look. I cut the top rind off of the brie to remove some of the musty flavor that can sometimes be present. Finally I reduced the baking time to about 25 minutes. Delicious!!!
