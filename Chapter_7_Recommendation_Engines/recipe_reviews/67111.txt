Itâ€™s a great fall recipe.  Excellent, moist and delicious I bake this in a 10-cup bundt pan.

I made this bread according to the directions, adding about 3/4 cup of chopped nuts as well.  The result tastes good, but be warned that it is VERY dense and heavy.  More so than a normal banana bread or pumpkin bread.  I was thinking of giving these for gifts, but  I have to say that I don't think they're good enough for that.  Time to try a different recipe!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  We had some persimmons that our grands had picked from a friend's tree and had no idea how to use them.  The recipe you shared with us turned out great...we added a banana since we were just shy of the 2 cup suggested amount of persimmon.  Everyone loved the results.

Persimmons on their own didn't have much flavor but the bread was moist, hearty and yummy!  I loved it.

I used this recipe to use up pulp I had left over from making fresh juices.  I had been looking for a good recipe to use it up and this one called for quite a bit of pulp.  The pulp I had used consisted of apple, beet, celery, and lots of carrot.  It worked great!    it was a little heavy on the all spice for me - but it is still really delicious.  half went into a loaf, the other half went into muffins which I baked for around 30 min. The taste great!

Instead of making my usual persimmon cookies and persimmon pudding I tried this one and it turned out great.  I did substitute another 1/2 cup persimmon pulp for the 1/2 cup applesauce.  This bread isn't too sweet and I like the use of whole wheat flour and oatmeal.

This bread is delicious. I used 1 1/2 c. sugar, 3 tsp. Garam Masala Indian spices blend (instead of the other spices),  1 c. persimmon and 1 c. banana, and added walnuts. Wonderful and unusual. Great with Tetley Cardamom Tea.

This was my first time making persimmon bread and I think it turned out well, although I couldn't really taste the persimmons. I halved the recipe because I only had a cup of puree and it worked out fine. I did add only 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and it turned out plenty sweet. I also cut the allspice a bit too. I cooked them as mini muffins for approximately 15 minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great! I baked two loaves for an hour and I think I could have gotten away with 50-55 minutes, so check your bread after 50 minutes and adjust accordingly.

Super moist and fluffy. I added ripe banana mash instead of applesauce and chia seeds just for fun. The spices really make the bread flavorful and unique. This would be perfect for Thanksgiving brunch.

A friend gave me some persimmons and I've never used them before so came to Allrecipes for some ideas. I chose this recipe and everyone in my family liked the end result.  My kids and husband both said it was better than they thought it would be. Based on the picture, I chose to do one Bundt-shaped bread instead of two loaves (mostly because I thought my kids would be more likely to eat it if it were shaped like a cake). Anyway, I sprinkled some raw sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter, so it had a sweet, crunchy top to it. I really liked the seasonings that make me think of fall/winter holidays. I baked for 1 hour, but probably should have taken it out 5 minutes earlier using the Bundt pan, but still it was was moist and yummy. I probably would not seek out persimmons for the purpose of making this, but if someone gave me some again I would definitely re-make this one.

The bread is good, a little dense, but not unbearably so.  The only thing that If ind lacking is the fact that the persimmon flavor is very subtle.
