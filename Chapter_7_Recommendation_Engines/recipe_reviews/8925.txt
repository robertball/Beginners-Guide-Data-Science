I enjoyed it but my husband thought
it was just OK, and my son picked the chicken
out of it.

Great change of pace from traditional lasagna, and even better the next day!  I grilled the chicken which added a subtle smoky flavor.

This one is ALWAYS a hit when  I make it... It's always the first thing finished at potlucks!  A couple of changes - (1) I use up to a third cup of chicken broth to increase the volume of sauce (even more if you use oven-ready noodles), and (2) I often substitute reduced fat cheddar (part-skim, NOT processed) -  it still melts nicely, but reduces the grease and gooey-ness

I added a little more seasoning, like some chopped garlic instead of mushrooms, oragano, and red pepper flakes.  I also had a little mozzerella cheese that I combined with the cheddar, and I used a little more parmasean then called for.  It turned out great, and I'll make it again.

I did not care for this recipe - there wasn't enough sauce or flavor.  My kids didn't eat it either.  But my husband (weirdo) loved it.  I will not make this again.

A good kid dish.  Easy to make.  I really cheated and used no boil noodles and frozen chicken breast.

This is very good.  I used more onion and 2 cloves of garlic in the sauce mixture.  Next time when I baked it, I would cover it for the first half so the noodles would stay moist.  I will definately make it again.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner using leftover roasted chicken.  (I also used more broth as another reviewer stated - about a cup - along with 2 cups fresh mushrooms and a clove of garlic.  This allowed the noodles to cook in the oven.) It was just OK.  I agree with another reviewer that it was missing something, but had potential.  I warmed up some for leftovers today and sprinkled a bit of rosemary on top.  Much better!  I think I'd make it again, but stir in seasoning with the chicken to give it a more well-rounded flavor (rosemary, thyme, etc.).  Not a bad recipe to use for leftover chicken and ingredients that I had on hand.

Good.  Go easy on the noodles.  Ricotta is hard to spread over the chicken.  Don't skimp on the onion.  It needs the seasoning.

The final product was very good.  I cooked an entire box of lasagna noodles, though.  6 was way too few.  I also used garlic powder and sprinkled a fine layer over the ricotta cheese on the final layer - my husband and I are garlic fans.

My family liked this, not our favorite recipe, but a good one for things I usually have on hand.  

Here is what I did different:  I used oven ready lasagna and increased the broth to 1/2 cup.  I used 2 boneless chicken breast halves and cut them up and sauted in olive oil with the onions, some salt & pepper, and garlic powder (will use real garlic when I have it next time).  I didn't have mushrooms, but I would use fresh and sautee with the chicken next time.  

It was a little funny layering it because it is not like normal lasagna, but it turned out good!

Not great...I even added some garlic and spinach for some extra kick and it still tasted like something was missing. I wish I could figure it out, because I think it could be delicious.

I used a whole box of lasagna noodles and added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic when I saut√©ed the onions and mushrooms, along with some thyme and oregano in addition to the basil.  I also substituted shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese for the cheddar.  It‚Äôs a very nice change from traditional lasagna.  Oh, you can also use ground chicken!

I normally love the chicken and cream-of-something soup recipes, but this was just ok. For my taste it had about twice as much ricotta and half as much seasoning as needed. I might try it again with some changes.

My boyfriend and I make this recipe at least once a month.  We cook the chicken first and then decrease overall cooking time to about 30 minutes.  Somebody doesn't like mushrooms... (hint, I love them) so we leave them out and it still tastes great!

I really enjoyed this recipe. To me, it's very much like tuna noodle casserole (one of my favorites), but fancier and with chicken. My family enjoyed it as well. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

We used 10 noodles (1 bottom layer and 1 top layer). Next time I will probably use more noodles and double the stuffing for the layers. It was tasty but lost the lasagna feel because of the lack of layers. Needs some tweaking, but a nice spin on lasagna.

This wasn't too bad.  Easy enough to put together but terribly bland.  It tasted like every other chicken/mushroom soup/cheese/noodle casserole out there.  I was hoping the ricotta cheese would add a depth to the dish and it just didn't.

This recipe is a good change of pace from the traditional lasagna.  I have made this recipe a few times now and everytime I find that the chicken is a little dry.  Otherwise very tasty.

I tried this recipe last night and I made a few variations after having read a number of the reviews.  Before browning the chicken season with garlic powder and onion salt.  I like chicken so instead of two cups i had three cups of shredded chicken.  I went from six lasagna noodles to nine.  I added with the cream of chicken mixture fresh garlic and finely chopped spinach.  The key to this turning out as well as it did and to avoid it being dry was as I layered the the chicken cheese and soup mixture is to also spoon in ample amounts of traditional spaghetti sauce.  This turned out much better than I had expected and my children really enjoyed the labor of love.   Outstanding!  This will definitely be in heavy rotation.

I wish I could say I liked this recipe as much as the other reviewers did, but I can't.  Too much ricotta, too much basil, too gooey and messy.  Didn't like the taste at all.  Thought it would be a great change of pace, but I'm going to stick to the traditional lasagna.

I get so tired of fixing the same old recipies, I really enjoy finding new ones that make a hit with my family.  The Golden Lasagna was a hit with everyone.  I enjoyed it too and it was simple and the ingriedients were things I keep on hand.  Thank You,

We like this recipe, but I do not like basil, so made it without.  I used parmesean, cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, mozerella, cheddar, and monterey jack cheese.  The monterey jack gives it additional flavor.  Other additions that are very good are crumbled bacon and spinach.

I blanched about 10 oz of spinach and added in between the chicken and cheese gave it a nice touch...saut√©ed garlic with the onions and mushrooms...also doubled the batch and used a can of progreso portobello mushroom soup without adding more milk in order to increase the amount of sauce making it more proportionate

Absolutely delicious! I had to do a little subbing just to use what I had on hand so that's why it's 4 stars and not 5. 

I used fresh chopped red/yellow/orange bell peppers in place of the mushrooms. 

I also had to use half ricotta and half cottage cheese since I didn't have enough ricotta. 

I added a bit of milk at the end to the top to mix with the soup mixture (more than what is in the recipe b/c I was using some leftover cream of chicken soup from another recipe and I wasn't sure exactly how much I had-since it was a family size can. 

This recipe is definitely a keeper and something I will continue to make over and over. My husband loved it and he doesn't like peppers. My two year old daughter was very fond of it as well. Yum!
