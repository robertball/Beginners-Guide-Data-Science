Used ground turkey instead of beef, omitted the cilantro, as we don't like it. Otherwise fixed as written. They didn't stay together very well. Maybe needed an egg mixed in. We never  have our burgers on bread, so just served them up.

These burgers were great. 
Flavorful and not dry at all!  But the way we had them was slightly different from this recipe.
I had my brother cook them because I had a headache.  He's autistic and not that great of a cook... but I figured this recipe would be simple enough for him to make.  He didn't measure his ingredients... I believe he used about a half cup of mayo, and he used the entire can of peppers and sauce.. which I figure was about 4 peppers and about a half cup of sauce.  Instead of making the chipotle mayo as the directions calls for, he mixed everything together (the mayo, ground beef, garlic, peppers, sauce, etc).  He also cooked them in the oven instead of the grill.  The burgers still came out great.  I was worried that using all the peppers would make the patties too spicy but they turned out to have just a slight, nice kick.
The only downer was that we used cheap ground beef (73/27) so the pan was full of grease when they were done.  Next time I will use leaner beef and cook them on the grill so that the fat can drip off the patties while they cook.

4/19/12 update:  I made these burgers again myself a few days ago and they were great.  I doubled the recipe, used ground turkey instead of beef, mixed the mayo w/ the meat, added 1 egg, used the whole can chipotle and sauce (small can- I think its about 4 oz or so).  I added more cilantro... maybe a 1/2 cup & cooked patties in oven.  The burgers were great & not dry thanks to the mayo in the meat mixture.

I have been making this before this recipe was added to the site. I have a few modifications. First, you can used fresh grated garlic (grate as finely as possible) or use garlic powder or dried minced garlic which seems to work better and not have as much of a bite as the fresh garlic. Also, don't use their special seasoning as it is basically salt and pepper with artificial filler. Add a dash of onion powder if you want, but skip the filler and control the amount of salt yourself. ALSO add chipotle chopped and the adobo sauce as needed, tasting as you go along. Everyone has a different heat level and this is the only way to ensure you don't make something you can't handle.

Very good recipe. Didn't make the chipotle mayo (don't like mayo). Topped with avocado in addition to the other veggies. Also subbed ground chicken for the beef.

these burgers were delicious and easy to make. i made them in a skillet, but i bet they would be absolutely amazing on the grill. the cilantro mayo really brought all the flavors together. i even made extra to dip fries in :) thanks for sharing.

Great!!!! This is 2nd time to cook 'em YUM! Hubby, 18 y-0, his buddy & 7 y-0, we loved them again! Used purchased flavored mayo and Picante brand chipotle sauce plus chopped onion in burger mix (No Goya brand found). Thanks for the fast simple summer flavor:)

These were a winner in our house and everyone loved them including my picky eater. I did make some minor changes. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used fresh garlic instead of the minced and dried cilantro since I could not find fresh cilantro locally. I did not have any issues with the meat mixture falling apart but I did not cook these on a grill but an electric skillet. I am normally a mayo hater but i really liked the chipotle mayo. It really added to the burger.

We really liked these burgers and will make them again next time we're in the mood for a spicy burger. May want to leave out the peppers in kids' burgers.

I am glad the recipe only asked for ONE chile pepper!  It gave it plenty of kick. Honestly did not bother with the mayo hoping the burger was flavorful enough without it and it was.  Plenty moist without it.

We loved these! Restaurant quality burgers at home! Very flavorful with just a slight bit of heat in the mayo. I think I will double the mayo dressing next time because it was only enough for 3 burgers! For the adobo seasoning it says 'to taste', but I don't want to taste raw ground beef. I used a pinch of adobo seasoning in the mayo and 1/2 tsp in the burger mixture! Great recipe Goya!

FANTASTIC! Made exactly as written, and would not change a thing. I made them earlier in the day, and put them in the fridge to allow the flavors to blend. These were very moist and flavorful w/ a spicy kick.  The chipotle mayo just puts this over the top, and is a must, IMO. This is another keeper from Goya(R) ~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't like these. I think it is the chipotle. I guess I'm not a fan of that pepper. My husband thought they were okay, but I will not be making these again.

Great recipe as is! I usually make it with a little more adobo and I use pepper jack cheese. As written this recipe works amazingly! I also usually make a few extra pounds and freeze them. They work great on the grill or on the stovetop.
