Very good dish. Nice flavor. Thought it needed some liquid at the end so added some chicken broth.

I also thought that there was something lacking, but it was good. Fit perfectly with the ingredients I had available.

This was pretty good, but it was missing something.  I tried adding canned tomatoes,which helped, but didn't make it great.

This was really good.  I suggest saving the water/broth and boiling the chicken (with or without the spices - I did it with)and then using that as the liquid.  It saves a step and makes a really tasty rice.  I also took into account what others said - "it was missing something".  Two words - 'shredded cheese' !

I have to agree that this was only ok. It is gorgeous though. Beautiful colors on my red, orange, and yellow dishes.....And then I had some more the next day and it was even better than the first day. Hhhmmm. Who would`ve thought it would get better but it did.

Pretty good.  I didn't have all the veggies called for, so used a frozen Normandie Vegetable blend, which worked well.  I added a cup of water and bullion to the veggies so they would cook in the skillet, tossed in some kielbasa sausage, and baked the chicken instead of boiling.  Worked well; it was pretty spicy, although I think that might've been my fault; I think I put in more cayenne than I meant to.  Still tasted pretty good, though.  I halved this and it was plenty for dinner with enough for a good size serving leftover.  Thanks for the recipe.

It had nice flavor, but we also thought it was too dry. I added about 1 cup of salsa, which helped.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  Like others have commented, it is a bit bland but some shredded sharp cheddar helped tremendously.    I did not use okra nor add near the hot pepper seasonings called for as I like things a bit on the more mild side.  I shared this meal with two other people they both agreed it was "5 Star good".  I will be making this again this coming winter for sure.  

Thanks for posting the recipe   =pip=

I seasoned and grilled the chicken instead of boiling it. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and I added a little cumin.
