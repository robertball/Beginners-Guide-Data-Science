I had very high hopes for this recipe because it sounded SO good and I followed it to a "T". I think this recipe should just be listed with the pesto on it's own. I think I would've liked the pesto better on another type of protein. Perhaps a seared beef on some orrechiette pasta. Really, you could use the Pesto on anything. I would make a couple changes to it though. Unfortunately, I couldn't find macadamia oil and I wish I had because I think it really is essential to this recipe. There was something about the raw taste of the garlic that I didn't enjoy (and I LOVE garlic)...next time maybe I would use garlic powder or roasted garlic. But overall, Thanks for the recipe...it really was an amazing combination of flavors...so many flavors!

I was hesitant about making a pesto that was not the traditional basil/parmesan pesto - but WOW this pesto was incredibly refreshing and delightful. I wanted the salmon to have more flavour, so I added a pinch of black pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and oregano before searing it.  I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil to sear the salmon and scallops b/c it has a higher smoke rate. I really enjoyed this recipe!!!  I found that using a microplane grater w/ the ginger was extremely beneficial.

Pretty good! I made some changes - I used shrimp instead of scallops and served it all with linguine and halved cherry tomatoes.

Very tasty, fast and easy to make. The cilantro-maca pesto is a recipe worth knowing on its own.

Very tasty. I didn`t use ginger in the pesto and it was delicious too. I agree you may use this pesto on anything.

Used the pesto on salmon. Skipped the ginger and poached the garlic to cut the sharpness. Delicious! Would be great on many proteins or pasta.

This salmon was flaky and flavorful. I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I couldn't get the large scallops so I used a bag of frozen mini scallops (thawed) instead. I just sauteed them in one of the pans with a little salt and garlic powder. Unfortunately, I used up ingredients making the pesto because my family didn't like it at all, but I think it was worth the try.

The salmon tasted divine - yumm!! The pesto was over-powered by the lemon juice & zest, so going to try it with only a squeeze of lemon juice next time.
