I gave it 5 stars but I did adjust several things as others had suggested.  I covered bottom of pan in 1/16" water, sealed tightly with foil and cooked ribs 2 hrs. at 300.  I then opened foil and drained all juices off.  I covered ribs in 18 oz of BBQ sauce and 1 tsp. dried onion flakes. I then replaced foil and cooked at 275 for another 40 minutes. I used 3.5 lbs very meaty country style ribs.  They were the most tender and moist ribs I'd ever made! They were falling off the bone and very moist still. I got the foil idea from another poster and also the bit of water as I did not want lemon.  I also mix about 3-4 different bottles sauces to come up with the one we like best.  We don't care for the one most posters mentioned.

Try baking them at 350 degrees in a foil covered pan for 1 1/2 hours. Drain the fat, add your bbq sauce and continue cooking for another 1/2 hour uncovered.

I use this, particularly in the winter
when the outdoor grill is off limits.
It is fantastic.  For those of you who
may not know the difference, "country
style ribs" refers to the cut of meat not
the manner of preparation.  There are 
three types of "ribs".  Spare ribs which
come from the belly, baby back which come
from the loin, and country style which
are no actually ribs and are cut from
the blade end of the loin.  Country 
style ribs have by far and away much more
meat and very little if any bone.  And it
is precisely the extra marbling and meat
that allows them to cook so long.  If 
you tried this and the meat was too dry,
you probably used the wrong cut.  If you
are dead certain you used the proper cut,
you might try a simple light to moderate
brining solution for 12-24 hrs.  But I've
never had this method let me down.
And don't reserve this for BBQ.  Use it
with any sauce you like... cranberry,
marinaded asian, etc...
The important ingredient in this method
is the proper cut of meat.

Okay, can I just say...Y-U-M?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  These ribs were absolutely delicious!  My local store had the country style pork ribs on sale, so I stocked up my freezer, and boy am I glad I did now that I have this great recipe!!!  My husband absolutely loved them as well!  Instead of just the ribs with BBQ sauce poured over them (which isn't a bad thing!), the tender meat had this subtle taste of garlic and lemon going all through it!  I used a large non-stick roasting pan, so that each rib wasn't touching.  I rubbed them generously with kosher salt and minced garlic (from the jar, gotta love convenience) all over.  I ended up using about 3 or 4 lemons, and layed lemon slices so that they covered the ribs completely.  Baked at 250 for about 2 and a 1/2 hours, then took the lemon OFF, poured Head Country BBQ sauce (the absolute BEST!) all over them, and baked for a little over an hour at 225 degrees.  I cannot express how delicious they were, and I am VERY much looking forward to the leftovers tonight!  This is now the only way I will prepare pork ribs!  Oh, and make sure and serve a little extra BBQ sauce warmed up on the side...especially if you LOVE it as much as I do!!!

Good Lord these ribs were awesome! Everyone in my house loved them.
I had 2 pans so I cooked them at 325 for 2 hours covered with aluminum foil. After 2 hours I drained the juice and covered the ribs with BBQ sauce. I turned the temp down to 275 and left the foil on for another 30 minutes. I then removed the foil for 20 minutes to let the sauce thicken. So a total of 2 hours and 50 minutes. 
The ribs fell off the bone! I also used tenderizer, minced garlic, fresh lemon (which I squeezed over the ribs) and sliced onions.
Oh, I did not add water. If you use the right ribs and keep them covered, you should not have a problem with dry ribs. The amount of juice that I had to drain was more than plenty to make a gravy.

This is a nice, easy recipe that will yield tender meat. I did not have lemon - so I just sprinkled ribs (liberally) with garlic salt, and baked in a shallow baking pan (uncovered) for 2 full hours at 250 degrees. I drained the juice off, added the bbq sauce, and continued cooking for another full hour. The meat was delicious and VERY tender. Really good recipe!

My family is CRAZY about these ribs.  I've made it three times now and suggest you bake an hour longer at 250, remove the lemon slices and then bake for the final hour w/bbq sauce.  Perfection!  They were then fall-off-the bone tender!

I did these in the crock pot adding a 1/2 can of diet coke with lemon.  I KNOW, it sounds odd, but EVERY time I add a coke to meat, no matter what the cut, it turns out tender.  And for as cheap as these ribs were (got em' on sale) they turned out sooooooo good.  I put them on high in the crock pot (I have a 5 quart) at 2 p.m. and they were falling off of the bone by 6 p.m. (my crock pot cooks faster for an unknown reason).  Thanks Glenda, I will pick up this cut a little more often!  :)

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I seasoned my ribs with garlic powder and salt & pepper first.  I also let them cook an extra half hour.  They were SO tender, my husband was surprised.  He doesn't usually like country ribs because they end up so tough....now I know the secret.  Thank you!

I've been preparing this dish for probably 30 years and they turn out perfect as long as I COVER them tightly with aluminum foil the first 2 1/2 hours @ 250 deg.  Uncover and turn oven up to 400-425 deg. for the last half hour and coat with the bbq sauce a couple of times.  It gives the bbq sauce a nice glazey finish.  Such a guilty pleasure these ribs are, lol.  This recipe is very good as is but sometimes we like these a little bit spicier and I will coat the pork ribs with good blackening spices and brown sugar before covering and baking.  This also gives the bbq a nice flavor.

Really good..after reading many reviews before preparing this recipe I would only comment that if your ribs are very large or thick cut, it is going to take longer to cook than the recipe states.  My ribs were very large so I allowed an extra hour for the initial baking time and they turned out great.  Check them before you put the sauce on.  If they are still tough and the juices look reddish....recover and continue to bake awhile longer.

These were great! At last, a rib recipe that really works! Mine always came out dry, chewy or greasy. In my version of this recipe, I baked the ribs with the garlic and lemon covered at 300 for 2 hours, drained off the juice & removed the lemon, added the BBQ sauce. Back in the oven for 1/2 hour then remove foil cover and increased temp to 425 for 15 minutes to make 'em sticky. Two lbs of ribs fed two people. Next time, will double that.

Simple, and very, very good!  I was asked to make it again the following week.  I covered the ribs in garlic powder, salt and pepper. Then I added 1/2 cup water mixed with a tsp liquid smoke.  Covered with foil and baked them at 275 for two hours.  Drained, then smothered them in BBQ sauce, (we like Sweet Baby Ray's Honey & Brown Sugar)  then baked them for another hour uncovered at 275.  PERFECT!!!!

Absolutely delicious! I decided to put my own spin on this recipe combining multiple suggestions from other reviews. Here is what I used: 1.5lbs country style ribs, 2 TBS Worcester sauce, 2 TBS soy sauce, 1 TBS lemon juice, 2 TBS minced garlic, 1 TBS garlic/onion grill rub. I combined all of the ingredients and then baked the ribs in a glass container for three hours on 250 with 1/4" water and 1 TBS coke in the bottom of the container wrapped tightly in foil. I then drained and covered them in sweet baby rays and baked at 450 for about 20 mins which gave the ribs a nice thick glaze.

Those that rated this 5 stars and then said they covered their ribs with foil are not rating the recipe as is.  I thought these should be covered but the recipe did not say to do so therefore I didn't...I just checked and it looks like we are having extremely dry ribs for dinner.

If you can't get 'em in Memphis (my favorite place on the planet for ribs) and you're not about to fire up the charcoal grill on a week night when Hubs doesn't feel like it, these ribs can somewhat satisfy the urge.  Not the real deal, but it works.  I used neither the lemon, nor the garlic or water, choosing instead to just slather the ribs with barbecue sauce, then covering the pan tightly with foil before baking them.  I removed the foil, then finished cooking them as directed in the recipe.  I swear the kitchen smelled just like the Memphis airport when I hop off the plane  - mmmmmm. (I used Jim Neely's Interstate Barbecue Sauce straight from Memphis, which might have had something to do with that)  I won't hesitate to make these again! (Lining the  baking pan with aluminum foil makes clean-up a breeze!)

This yielded the most tender ribs I've ever had!! I seasoned the ribs first with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder and then I baked very meaty country style ribs for 2 hours covered with foil. Drained off the grease and then poured a WHOLE bottle of Bullseye Barbecue Sauce and covered with foil.  Returned them to the oven and baked another 70 minutes.  The meat was soo tender-it was falling apart in the sauce.  This is an AWESOME way to cook an inexpensive cut of meat that yields such tender results.  I will definitely fix this one again.

These were really awesome. I made a rub to start using brown sugar 2 spoons, chili powder 1 spoon, kosher salt 1 spoon, cayenne just a bit, and garlic powder 1 spoon. I didnt use the lemon or garlic since i used the rub, and I covered the pan. After the first 2 hours I used barbque sauce then drizzled a bit of honey over them. Amazing, and even making the rub only added about 5 min to the prep, if I had the option I would of let the rub sit on them for a couple hours or overnight, but worked great even though I rubbed them about 15 min before they went in the oven.

I used a combination of several of the suggestions in the reviews.  I seasoned the ribs with celery salt salt and pepper.  I used the worschester,soy sauce, lemon juice marinate I saw on one review.  I used the minced garlic and also used minced onion and lemon slices, cooked in a covered shallow glass baking dish at 300 degrees for three hours and then poured off the juice, pour on the barbeque sauce and recovered and cook for another 20 minutes and then uncovered and cook another 30 minutes.  The ribs were delicious, and very tender.  I will definitely make this dish again.

These ribs were absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe just as written (how can you rate a recipe if you make a lot of changes to it?) and they turned out so moist, tender, and delicious! I'll be making this one again!

I've never had luck when making ribs. They always came out so tough. My husband would never finish his food when I would make ribs.
Tonight, after trying this recipe, he wiped his plate clean! He freaked upon the first bite! He told me that I have to use this recipe from now on. 

Thank you so  SO much for posting this. We love ribs, and now we don't have to go out to get some. We can now have them at home. =)

PS, I broiled them for 10 minutes at the end to get that "grilled" textured.

Awesome!  I always boiled the ribs first, then baked with BBQ sauce but decided to try something different since I had time.  I also covered the bottom of the baking pan with foil and a little water.  Instead of lemon slices (had none), I rolled the ribs in lemon juice, then smothered with some minced garlic, pepper, and Montreal Steak seasoning.  Baked @ 250 for 1-1/2 hours, then removed foil, slathered with Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce,and baked another 45 minutes at 250.  Very tender and moist, too.   

I wonder two things about those who had problems:  First, did your ribs have bones?  I've always heard that boneless pork is very dry and sometimes tough.  The second is that perhaps they were packed too tight in the pan.  I spread my 4 ribs out so they weren't touching and they cooked just fine.  Just a couple of thoughts.

The recipe as it's written does NOT work. You *need* to cover the ribs, otherwise they will be extremely dry, and you need to cook them at a higher temp for the first hour or two (300ish) otherwise they will be raw in the middle, not a pleasant combo. I'm a fan of brisket (which is a good 5-6 hour commitment), so I am familiar with slow cooking in my oven. I was wary about not being told to cover the ribs, and after the first hour I checked. The ribs were not cooked...at all...even the slightest bit, but there was a thin dry crust that was forming. I immediately added some water to the bottom of my pan, covered tightly with foil, and cooked at 300 for an additional 2 hours (total of 3 for the first step). After that, the ribs were resurrected and I was able to sauce them up (Stubbs Hickory Bourbon)and finish cooking, eating and enjoying them.

When I read this recipe, my first thought was uhh, lemon?  But, I wanted a way to cook my ribs and then just finish them off quickly on the grill outside, so I cover them with chopped garlic and lemon slices, cover the pan with foil, put the ribs in the oven for 3 hours at 250 without touching them, then take them outside and grill them for about 5 minutes on each side. Then I quickly brush with BBQ sauce and let them go another minute or so on each side.  Fabulous.  Love the subtle taste of garlic and lemon which still comes through, even after putting on the BBQ sauce.  And, they are extremely tender and I don't have to run in and out in the heat to keep turning them.  Love em!

I've followed the directions exactly on this, and I've used the following alternate mehod: no lemon, but covered bottom of large roaster w/ water. 350 degrees, covered for 1.5 hr, then drain fat and add bbq, cook another 30 min. uncovered. 

Both methods worked well. I think I prefer no lemon, but it was fine with it. I like the alternate cooking temp and time because it gets done faster, and is plenty tender.

As with any recipe calling for bottled BBQ make sure to use really good stuff, makes a huge difference! :) I love my sweet baby ray's. :) This was a great recipe that was very well received tonight. I didn't have lemons so I sprinkled on some lemon juice along with the minced garlic in place and they came out great! :)

Really good recipe and so simple.  Please don't leave out the lemon... it makes the dish.  The pulp disintegrates and the softened peel is left.  I eat the peel with the meat and it creates a tangy sweet contrast that is wonderful.  Yum!  I did have to cook mine longer for it to break down and tenderize... another 30 minutes at an increased temp of 300.  That probably is because I kept a lid on mine the entire time.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.

This did not turn out well for me at all! The recipe specified 10 country style ribs but not really the size, thickness, or weight, which is important. The first time I had to cook them about twice as long and the second time even longer than that after adding the sauce, as they were not done in the middle in the time specified. I bought the boneless ribs at a bulk store and they were quite large. They also had about 1/2" thick piece of fat on the bottom of each piece I did not see when I purchased it. I don't know if that is normal? But, they were still country style ribs, which I have made before. My meat ended up being like "dry pork chops," with "large unedible rubbery pieces of fat," and a sauce that did not seem to get absorbed into the meat. I expected tender pork from the recipe and loved how few ingredients were listed. But, the end result was pork to dry and hard to eat, and it ended up a waste of money as it was unsalvageable and unfortunately got tossed out.

I've FINALLY found the PERFECT and most EASY recipe!  Wanted fall-apart ribs cuz I got home late, have too many people that like different sauces - UGH!  I made these meaty, country-style ribs but changed just a few things; heated oven to 350 degrees F, sing-layered ribs in glass pan, topped with minced garlic & thin slices of lemon but ADDED about 2 capfuls of vinegar at the bottom of pan.  Did NOT use salt or pepper as I didn't want the ribs dry.  Covered tightly w/foil. Baked for 2.5 hrs and lifted foil to bake another 30 minutes.  Ribs were tender, juicy and fell apart with a fork.  Served "naked" to my children who decided to use their own favorite sauces.  The most popular being the white bbq sauce on this site.  The meat was stand-alone AMAZING.  Will use this again and again.  Thank you!

Man, these were great!  I had country spare ribs and no idea what to do with them.  I only had 1 lb, so I had to alter the recipe a bit.  I seasoned them with salt and pepper, rubbed the minced garlic in and squeezed some lemon juice on top since I didn't have actual lemon slices.  I covered with foil and cooked 2 hours @ 250 degrees.  Removed foil, decreased to 200 degrees and added about 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's sauce on each piece for last hour.  Tender, moist and delicious!!

Slow cooked and very tender.  I was leary when I read put the lemons over the ribs.  Well, the results were wonderful.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using homemade barbeque sauce (Grandpa Crotts BBQ Sauce - from AR) instead of a bottled brand.  We have ribs quite often and I will be using this method again.  I did bake the 2 hours at 250 degrees, drained the grease and baked another hour at 200 degrees.  I served this with 'Healthy Potato Salad' and 'Asparagus w/Cranberries & Pine Nuts', both AR recipes.

I followed the ingredients and cooking times as written.  I asked our butcher to select the best ribs..... ribs that he would take home to cook.  The lemon imparts the perfect flavor (not to strong) into the ribs.  I liked the mild garlic flavor, too.   I covered the ribs for the first two hours, then uncovered them for the last hour.  These were the BEST  and EASIEST ribs I have ever made.  I will throw away all the other recipes that I have and just use this one from now on.  Bravo to Coolundrprsr!

These were great.  I followed some of the review suggestions.  I baked 4 large bone-in country style ribs at 250 for 2 hours with tin foil covering.  I then scraped off most of the garlic and poured all the drippings out.  Put on 18oz of Sweet Baby Ray's Original over the top.  Covered about for about 1/2 hour after turning up to 275.  I then removed the tin foil and baked, turned a couple times, for about another 45 minutes.  These were so delicious and will make these again and again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Not a big fan of lemon meat but the acid helps to tenderize.  To achieve the same result I marinated country style pork ribs in a shot of whiskey and a half can of beer for a full day.  I cooked them a little lower and slower.  250 for 2 1/2 hours, drained them and bbq soaked them and then cooked them for another hour.  Ribs were perfect

After reading 2 hours worth of reviews, I cooked the recipe as it is written except I used lemon juice over the ribs (didn't have lemons) and covered it - no water in the pan.  Because my oven is not properly calibrated, I cooked at 300 degrees for 3 hrs, added the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, recovered the ribs and cooked for another hour at 250.  Fall apart delicious!  My husband (who doesn't care for sauce on his ribs) loved it!  Thank you for posting!

These turned out GREAT! I used the jarred minced garlic and fresh lemon slices to cook them on 300 for 2hours! I did cover the pan in foil and I did put a little water in the bottom as well. After 2 hours I removed the foil, removed the lemons, and drained the pan of its juices. I then covered them with sweet baby rays and cooked them on 275 for an additional hour. These were large country ribs and came out good and tender!!

I wish my experience was the same as the 5-star reviewers.  I looked forward to these all week.

I cooked them for 3 hours and they weren't even close to tender.  I gave them another half hour, but then it was time to eat so I had to just go with it.

Very tough, had to be cut into cubes...unappetizing. I estimate they probably needed a minimum of 5 hours.

I cooked these tonight and one thing is for certain, it took more than 3 hours for me to attain that fall off the bone tenderness. More like 4 1/2 and I cooked them in a roast pot, bottom covered in foil, with the lid on for the first 2 hours at 260 degrees, then took the lemon off and added the bbq sauce and cooked covered for another hour at 260 and then uncovered for 30 minutes at 300 and they were tender, but not enough. It was 30 minutes past dinner at this point, so I had to take them out. 
After dinner, I put them back in the over, covered and cooked for another hour at 350 and they were falling off the bone tender. 
In the past I have absolutely HATED this cut of pork because it was always prepared baked in the oven with a gravy and I just didnt like the taste. But now that I have this recipe, I love country style pork ribs and btw they were delish! A real winner with everyone in my family, even with them not being really tender the way I expected after reading the reviews. So I give them 5 stars for showing me a better way to cook and enjoy this simple and inexpensive cut of meat! 
p.s. I added my usual house seasoning to this meat: paprika, mesquite seasoning, garlic powder, reduced sodium salt, pepper, meat tenderizer and for this meat, added a touch of brown sugar, to sweeten the taste of the bbq sauce.

I make these every year you New Years dinner. My family loves them.  In case you're not aware, there are two cuts of country ribs.  Those that are cut from the shoulder and the ones cut from the loin. I use "country ribs" from the shoulder since it's fattier. Hence not dry. Loin country ribs are better for slow cooker.  I hope this helps some of you. Happy New Year!

These Ribs are GREAT!!!...I did make an adjustment to this recipe. I boiled my Ribs on the stove top for about 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350 degree or on medium. I placed them in a large pot and cover with water. I reserve the water that I boiled Ribs in for cooking my Rice and it also speeds up the cooking time. I then removed the Ribs from the water and placed them in a baking pan and covered with BBQ sauce. I then put them in a 300 degree oven for 1 hour uncovered. They turn out just perfect!!! YUM..YUM

I followed the recipe exactly and after 2 hours my 6 country style ribs were almost raw.  I had wrapped them in aluminum foil, and there was plenty of liquid from the lemon, but the ribs were no where near done.  I won't make this again.

Baked at 300 for 2 hrs.  Drained water.  covered with BBQ sauce.  re-covered with foil.  bake at 275 for 20 minutes. removed foil.... baked for 20 more.   YUMMY!  Served with Steakhouse White Bread from this site!  Fantastic!!!!

WOW!!!  They were absolutely FANTASTIC.  I will make these over and over again.  I served these with homemade mac and cheese and it was out of this world.  I don't give five stars to very many dishes unless I really feel like they are over the top delicious and this get a well deserved full five star. I did use water and (covered 2 hrs uncovered 1 hr) cause I just wanted to make sure they were super moist, which they were.  I also added liquid smoke to give it that smokey BBQ taste.  This is the way I will be cooking my ribs from now on.

this recipe was so easy and so fantastic!  i baked it at 225 (tightly covered, w/ a touch of broth in the pan) for 3hrs, then another hour (uncovered) basting w/bbq every 15mins or so.  i also stuck them under the broiler for the last 5 mins to get them a little brown.  i didnt even have the lemons on hand and its still my favourite rib recipe :)

Gotta say that I love the taste of this very easy to make recipe.  Although instead of just putting sliced lemons on top of the ribs I like to take another lemon cut into halves and squeeze the juice over the ribs.  I also use the minced garlic from a jar that has that juice and I sprinkle some of that juice on the ribs as well. The taste is savory.

Original from 4/25/2012: Wonderfully simple and delicious. I did follow other suggestions of covering with foil, then I baked at 300 for 2 hours, then another hour uncovered with sauce.  I also seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and garlic before laying the lemon on top.  Definitely will do this again!
Update on 2/21/2017: I did not have any lemon, so I sliced an apple. I cooked it for two hours at 250, then removed the apples, the grease, and the juice. Covered the meat with a sweet chili sauce and cooked for another 20 at 250. I then added a pan of potatoes to bake, so I turned the temp up to 350 for another 40 minutes. Still deliciously tender!

I made these when I found country ribs on sale.  Didn't have a recipe but always go to allrecipes.com for anything I don't know how to cook.  These were the best ribs I've had in a long time.  My brother in law was practically licking the plate.  This is the second time I made them & just as yummy as the first time.  Thanks for this easy delicious recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight, they came out pretty good. I didn't have a lemon, so I used adobe seasoning and rub them down with garlic. I added a little bit of water at the bottom of the pan, covered them with foil. Cooked them at 300 for 2 and a half hours. Then I removed the foil and added the BBQ sauce. I put them back in the oven for another 30 min.

This could be good recipe but for a person that does things to the T or by the book there are key elements missing. I tried cooking this recipe but guess what they dont mention that you should boil the ribs in vineger first before baking. So my experience was a pretty tough experience and wasteful one at that. So remember BOIL the ribs first to make them tender brfore baking.

I used boneless country ribs and they turned out super dry. I usually cover my ribs when baking them but it didn't indicate to do so so I didn't. bad move. If you're going to make these please tightly cover with foil after the first 25 minutes of baking. you'll be glad you did.

These were great! I don't usually have any luck with ribs of any variety, so I'm so glad these turned out how they did! 

I took the advice of others and put a bit of water on the bottom of the pan, and covered the ribs in kosher salt, minced garlic, and fresh ground pepper before cooking in the oven at 300 for 2 hours sealed in a large roasting pan with foil. Then I drained the pan, covered the ribs in bbq sauce, and put them back in the oven for another 45 at 250. They were falling apart, it was great! 

Next time, I'm thinking about putting the sauce on and throwing them on the grill, just for that flavor. 

Great recipe, will definitely make again!

These where sensational!  I followed the advice of another and cooked at 350 degrees(mine where still slightly frozen) for 1 1/2 hours and covered with foil seasoned on one side with a little garlic powder and salt then uncovered draining the juices and added BBQ sauce for another 40 minutes.  They just fall apart can't stick a fork in then without it falling apart.  Delicious. Thank you!

This recipe is amazing with various changes (adding water and onions, omitting the lemon, etc...) But I've noticed people's comments of picking the right meat for those who's meat came out too dry...and another thing to add to that is to make sure that the bone goes across almost all of the meat. The first time I made these, they were absolutely phenomenal! The meat was so tender I couldn't believe it! I was ecstatic to make them again...only to figure out that the ribs barely had a bone attached, so when they came out of the oven they were dry. I'd have to assume that is the problem people were having with it coming out dry.

While these ribs take awhile to cook, they are easy to prepare and are oh so yummy. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked them covered for and hour and a half at 350,then I drained the grease, added honey barbeque sauce, and cooked uncovered at 375 for another half hour.  I used boneless pork ribs, and they were the most tender ribs that I have ever eaten. Thanks for sharing; Mm husband was impressed and even my toddler liked it!

YUM!  This turned out a lot better than I thought it would.  They were so tender and the taste was great!  I did it a little different.  Didn't have any lemons, so I just brushed on some olive oil and rubbed in some garlic and salt.  Baked in the oven for recommended time for 2 hours, covered with a glass lid.  Then I took them out of the oven and put them in a cooker, covered with a bottle of Montgomery Inn BBQ Sauce & a little water and simmered them for another hour.  They were so tasty!  I really think that the BBQ sauce could make or break this recipe, so choose wisely.  All in all, it was great and I'll definitely make it again!

I have tried this recipe three times. Here is how I got the best results:

First I brine the ribs for a half hour using 1 tbsp salt and 1/4 tsp sugar per cup water.

Place in a rimmed baking sheet, sprinkle liberally with your favorite seasonings or BBQ rub (I do recommend going easy on the salt here because of the brine). Add about 1/4 inch water in the bottom and seal with aluminum foil. (I don't personally care for the lemon; I think it is really only there for moisture any way.)

Bake at 300 for 2 hours.

Drain grease and liquids, add BBQ sauce (I like to mix Sweet Baby Ray's Cola-Q and Jack Daniels BBQ sauce), loosely replace foil and bake for another 30-45 minutes.

Enjoy!

I have tried this recipe without the brine, and the ribs turned out somewhat dry. I also have brined them for multiple hours and it was too salty but moist and tender. A half hour for the brine I suggest is about optimum.

Food is a mixture of art and science: recipes are suggestions, not hard-fast rules (unless perhaps you're cooking a French dish). I rated this recipe highly because it was the base I used for my own version, even though I dont follow the directions to a "T." Experiment and have fun! Next I am going to try using Dr Pepper instead of water when I make these ribs.

I give this a 5 for method and results..I have been trying to make these ribs taste yummie and now i know what i wasnt doing..slow bake,and rebake with the  BBQ sauce..I did marinate in liquid smoke over night and then added some to the water in the foil wrap..Ive always like this cut for its meatiness but up to now it has been a challenge getting them to that yummie stage..Also a good dry rub before the first baking if you like an intense flavor like i do..

I made these exactly as instructed.  My adult daughter who hates lemon was very skeptical, however, she was overly complimentary about the ribs.  Next time, though, I will probably up the heat a bit at the end for 15 minutes or so as we like more of a sticky sauce.  Great recipe - the meatier the ribs the better.

There are so many differing reviews on this recipe that I had a hard time deciding what to do. I used 4 lbs of boneless pork country style ribs. I skipped the lemon and rubbed them with dried garlic, dried onion & pepper. I covered them with water in the bottom of the pan and baked at 250 for 2.5 hours. Next time, I'd cut that down to 2 hours max. I then uncovered & drained and put them back in for 1 hour with BBQ sauce. They turned out really well but just a bit dry because I cooked them too long. I will absolutely make these again. I think that I would cover them again for the first 2 hours but reduce cooking time and to the recipe specs. This recipe is a keeper. To those reviewing - please be sure to specify what type of rib (and bone in/out) that you used since this info is important to those weighing the cooking methods. Cheers!

Loved it. Followed the recipe but did what some of the others did by adding a half hour to both cooking times and also used 5 country ribs (about 4 pounds). The hint of lemon in the pork was great...family really liked it. Try this with 'A very popular BBQ sauce' submitted by J.R. Neumiller. That sauce was worth making. Thanks for sharing. Will be making this again for sure.

Ok, so i just snuck one of these waiting for my boyfriend to come home. Delicious! I didn't have a lemon so I used a lime, and I covered them for the first 2 hours. After draining the ribs, I raised the oven to 275, and cooked uncovered for another hour and a half. My ribs were thick cuts, so this seemed like a better option. They fell right off the bone, and were perfectly seasoned. Would make these again definitely. Hope I can hold off long enough for my boyfriend to come home before I eat them all!

There is no better way to make these big Meaty ribs. I do like to add part of a beer since my bbq sauce tends to be thick. I have done these in the oven on a very low 275 for 4-5 hours. Wow are they finger lickin GOOD!! Thank You Coolundrprsr!

I just elected to use a good quality bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar) and didn't worry about the lemon or garlic.  I adapted it for my crock pot, and basted the ribs w/ the bbq sauce, covered and cooked it on high for 5 hours, and turned to low and cooked another 2 hours.  Simple and doesn't get much easier than this.

used Bottled "Sweet Baby Rays /w brown sugar" It was a little too rich, I baked it first to get some off the fat off  and then put in the crock pot (with the sauce ) for rest of the day, cant remember how long, Easy and good . If I were going to be home I would have fixed whole time in oven. I could have added a little water since baby ray is really rich.

Loved these.  First time ever cooking ribs and worked beautifully.  I didn't have a lemon so as another reviewer suggested I used a little water in bottom of foil lined pan.  I also added minced garlic (3 cloves) when I added the BBQ sauce, and luckily I tasted the BBQ (Jack Daniels master blend - new to me) so I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar also - sprinkled over the top of the sauce.  I changed the oven temp (300 deg. 2 hrs, added sauce+ and then 275 deg. 40 mins.).  The ribs were falling apart tender, and using foil certainly made cleanup easier.

Turned out GOOOOOD!!!! For me being a first time rib cooker and complete amateur at cooking this was a simple recipe to follow and soo YUMMY when done. On a whim I picked up country style ribs then googled a recipe.I read a lot of the reviews from this recipe and decided to try it with out adding water. I only put salt, pepper, and freshly grated garlic( I did not have a lemon) on my 8 boneless country style ribs. Then I covered the dish with tin foil like others had suggested. I cooked it at 275(my oven has a gap and loses heat)for 2hr30min. I poured generous amounts of Country Bob's sauce over the top of each rib, cooked for 1/2hr then poured the rest of the sauce over each and cooked for another hour. 
My husband wants me to make more ASAP and my 7yr old even liked them!!
Thank you so much for the easy recipe Coolundrprsr. Next time I will make sure to have lemon.

I followed directions, except I used lemon juice instead of sliced lemons. I also covered with foil for the first two hours since the lemon sliced would have probably kept it more moist. I found them to be a bit less tender than everyone says, but it was probably because they were more meaty than most country style ribs. Will try again and cook for longer as some folks suggested. They still got rave reviews, even if they were more work to eat. Will try other sauces as well.

Loved this recipe and so did my husband and three kids. I followed the directions exactly except I didn't have fresh lemons so I used lemon juice.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! I used teriyaki sauce instead of bbq sauce and everyone in my family thought it was amazing. (I used about 1/3 of a bottle total on about 8 large pieces, put it back in the oven for 15 minutes -- at 350F now since everyone was getting antsy to eat -- turned them, then in for only another 10-15 minutes and they were perfect!) We will definitely be having this again.

DELICIOUS!!!! I cut down the cook time to 1 1/2 hours by increasing the temp to 350. Fall off the bone, and it was absolutely wonderful!

FINALLY - I have found a keeper recipe for this type of pork ribs.  These ribs will be part of a weekly meal from now on.  I used Greek seasoning instead of the garlic and bottled lemon juice.  Unbelievable how tender these turned out.

So I just made these ribs (bone out) for the first time and can I just say they are AMAZING! Some of the reviews state their ribs were tough and dry, etc.. I don't know what they did differently than I did but mine were tender and juicy which actually says quite a bit since the cuts I got were less than ideal (oh well live and learn) The only things I did different were to cook the ribs covered with foil for the first two hours and then cook the remaining time uncovered with the bbq sauce on it. I will most definitely be using this method of cooking short ribs from now on with many different styles of marinades and sauces as suggested by other reviewers. Thanks to Coolundrprsr for posting! Happy eats everyone! :)

very good recipe...but I added my own twist to it..which I have been doing for years...I seasoned the ribs with my own dry rub then poured bbq sauce covered with foil and cooked for 2 1/2 hrs...then drained the juice and poured more bbq sauce and cooked for 30 mins with foil..then I took the foil off and cooked it for another 30 mins uncovered...The meat comes out so tender and juicy and full of flavor!!

It can't get any easier or delicious as this recipe makes a very moist and flavorful country rib.I used a Cajun seasoning salt as a rub to add a bit of spice.

I know I followed the steps and I've cooked ribs several times before, but I thought they were under-seasoned (and I added more of everything called for in the recipe) and very tough and dry, even though they were dripping in BBQ sauce.

What a great way to slow-cook ribs! This was so easy to prepare and cook. When I make this again, I will definitely remove the lemon slices before covering the meat with the barbecue sauce.

I cooked this UNCOVERED for 3 hours then added sauce and cooked for another hour then I tasted it.I then had to cover the pan with heavy duty foil and bake at 275 for 3 hours to really get it to "fall-off-the-bone" tender. The recipe really should have included the fact that COVERING up the pan is very important unless you want your ribs to be chewy.

Best and easiest ribs I have ever made!   I followed the recipe for the most part...I covered the ribs in a mixture of minced garlic, adobo seasoning and onion powder, then i put them in a pan and covered them with lemon slices.  I also poured about a cup of orange juice and some water in the bottom of the pan just so they wouldn't burn and rolled the ribs around in the juice before going in the oven.  Cooked the ribs at 250 for 2 hours, drained off most of the liquid and covered them with sauce, re-foiled them and cooked at 300 for 45 more minutes.  When i tell you they were falling apart but not mushy, I had to lean against the counter after the first test bite.  Definitely a winner!

This is a great recipe that I've made many times. In fact I have it in the oven right now. As others suggested, my only changes were to add water and cover in foil for the first one and a half to two hours. I also adjusted cooking times and temperatures for cooking at 8000 feet altitude. I don't know why so many people are suggesting so many other changes… I think this recipe comes out perfect the way she wrote it, with a few exceptions I noted above. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe "as is", with the exception of powdered garlic as I am allergic to fresh unless it is cooked 5-6 hours.  They were great.  The second time around, I made a few changes.  I used lemon juice instead of sliced lemons.  I have starting using lemon juice on chicken and pork because it seems to sear it and hold in the juices - even on the grill I no loger have dry meat.  I also used Paul Prudhomes BBQ rub and then covered with foil.  After taking off the foil and pouring off the juices, I use my family's recipe for BBQ sauce.  1/2 cup plain bbq sauce (I use kraft), 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup Kikoman's teriyaki glaze (make sure you get the glaze not the marinade, big difference in consistency). Super easy and makes it taste more homemade.

I tweaked the recipe slightly by adding a dry rub to the ribs before putting them into a 300 degree oven in a shallow dish of water, covered in foil.  cooked for 2 hrs, removed foil, added 18oz home made bbq sauce, covered again & finished cooking at 275 degrees for 40 minutes.  Soooo good!

Followed recipe exactly and the meat was really tough and unappetizing.  Think this would be better as a real braise.

This recipe was great!  The lemon and garlic kept the meat juicy and delicious, and the BBS sauce did not drown out all the great flavors of the meat and seasonings.  

I had never made country style ribs before and was wary - but this recipe made me a believer.

I followed the recipe exactly (cut in half for the two of us), and after three hours of slow cooking the meat was dry and tough.  I had to add more sauce to my portion to eat it, and then it was too sweet.  I think it would be better to boil the meat and just bake it with the sauce for the last few minutes.  I don't like dry or tough meat.

Pretty good recipe with a few modifications.  I did as others suggested and used water as I had no lemon slices.  I cooked it for 2 hours at 300 with tightly wrapped aluminum foil on it, i seasoned with celery salt, salt, pepper and ground mustard.  I then put the bbq sauce on and left foil on for another 20 min and removed for the last 40.  Turned out pretty darn good for my first time!  Hubby liked it said only one was a little tougher to eat and it was a thicker one so it may of needed cooking longer not sure.  But overall good!

Not a big fan of ribs cooked this way. They weren't nearly as "fall apart" tender as when they are in the slow cooker all day. In fact these weren't tender much at all. I needed a steak knife to cut them. I wouldn't make country style ribs this way ever again.

Great recipe! I did stick with the garlic & lemon slices but I added water to the bottom of the pan. The 1st 2 hours I cooked it in a glass cake pan cover in foil @ 300 degrees. Then I drained off the liquid & put the lemon slices off to the side of the meat, smothered the ribs in Bulls Eye BBQ sauce & put back in the oven for 45 minutes @ 250 degrees. The lemon took everyone by surprise at 1st but the guys gave it a chance & ended up saying the meat was wonderfully tender & the lemon was... different. I would make this recipe again but am curious to see how orange slices would taste rather than lemon slices.

This method was the absolute worst! After 3 hours and following the recipe to a tee, the ribs were completely raw in the middle. I had to crank the oven up to 350, cover them and put them back in for another 45 minutes and then they were drier than dry. Not sure what the lemon was supposed to add because no one could taste it.

Good flavor - lemon and garlic is a nice combination, but neither overwhelms the final product. The ribs were very moist and tender thanks to the slow cooking at a low temp.

I MADE THESE RIBS ON YESTERDAY AND THEY WERE TERRIFIC! I DIDN'T HAVE A LEMON ON HAND SO I OMITTED THAT PART OF THE RECIPE. I SEASONED IT WITH SEASONED SALT, BLACK PEPPER, GARLIC POWDER, ONION POWDER, ONIONS, & WORCHESTERSHIRE SAUCE. I COVERED IT WITH FOIL AND LET IT MARINATE ALL NIGHT AND THEN COOKED THEM IN THE OVEN AS SUGGESTED. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!

These are sooooo, good you can't get enough of them you want to make them for everyone. I have made them 3 times in the last month. The only change I made was to use more lemon slices and I added 1/4 cup water

Loved it!  I also covered with foil & used about 3 lemons to cover the ribs, lots of kosher salt & lots of pepper along with the garlic to rub over the ribs.  No water was needed at all.  After the 2 hrs were up I went to turn the ribs and the bones fell out already.  There was so much liquid to drain I actually sloshed a little out of the pan.  Be careful!  I put them on the grill with homemade bbq sauce for another 20 mins & they were to die for.

Great Recipe!!  If you are questionable on the lemon, give it a try.  It really adds freshness to the recipe.  I covered the ribs and they seemed to be more tender.  A good BBQ sauce to add is Sweet Baby Rays or Jack Daniels.  I serve it over rice and a nice green salad.  A really easy and delicious dinner

I liked the use of garlic & lemon slices in this technique!  Our ribs didn't turn out quite as tender as I would have liked, but they were still good overall.  I do recommend covering the pan with foil as others have noted, as I started the baking w/o foil as directed and the pieces were looking a little dry after 1.5 hours.  So I covered them then and continued baking for the specified times.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, chopped the meat to serve, made mashed potatoes, and a side salad.  It was a very tasty dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and turned out great! I would emphasize to add plenty of water to the first baking, and then drain most, but leave a little in for the second baking. You can't get too moist, but it's easy to get too dry, especially with cooking uncovered for so long.

The ribs were tough and yes, I used country style and cooked as directed.  They smelled great but tasted awful.  Next time I will try the "Simple BBQ ribs" recipe from this site which boils them first.  These ribs really need some more time or slow cooking/boiling to break down the meat to where they are tender.  Very disappointing.

This literally fell apart.  I have never had pork this tender before.  I did increase the temp to 320 and reduce cooking time by about 30 minutes.  Next time I think I will cook it the full time at 300.

Really good! I cooked the ribs for 3 hours and grill them afterwards. Outstanding. They were very moist. I would add water in the bottom of the pan while cooking and cover with foil. 

Those of you who had dry or over cooked ribs really did something wrong!

Very easy basic recipe.  I used boneless country style ribs and cooked them about 2 hours total.  They were good if anything the BBQ sauce that you use is going to make or break the recipe.  It is a good "winter" type rib meal though.

Did change a bit and it was delicious. Cooked with garlic, no lemon. Covered at 350 for 1 1/2 hours then drained juices, added favorite sauce and broiled on low 6 inches from top for 5 minutes, added more sauce and broiled at high for 3 minutes. I like the sauce sticky and a touch crispy but not burned. Came out perfect.

Outstanding! Salt and pepper the ribs before spreading garlic over the top. Don't for get the lemon slices. Also increase heat to 350 for last 15-20 mins to get the bbq sauce to thicken and get sticky.

Very good.  Be careful with the lemon slices. Will make it have a strong lemon taste.  Other then that very very tender.  Used my own BBQ sauce and it was very good.

I've made this recipe several times! I do some easy modifications such as a bit of lemon juice (like in the bottle kind, not fresh b/c I hardly ever think to buy lemons lol) in the bottom of the pan. The lemon juice and bbq sauce (MUST USE ORIGINAL SWEET BABY REYS ON THESE!) make a great combo taste! I slow cook them like the recipe says when I can, but you can also cook them faster if you just turn the heat up. I also salt, pepper, and greek season and rub into the ribs before I put the garlic on. I use a good amount of garlic and rub it in also. Then I fold up the aluminium foil (before I lay the ribs in I make a T of aluminium foil for easy cleaning and more flavor locking too), and pop in the oven! they always smell so good cooking, even without the bbq. add in the bbq and uncover and cook for about 30 minutes more and BAM! awesome dinner that even my 5 year old and 2 year old LOVE! never any left overs here

Loved em! This recipe makes oven baked ribs super simple, juicy and tender. I always worry about ribs drying out in the oven but not anymore! Thanks

Yummy, I rubbed with minced garlic and ground pepper and wrapped in foil, baked at 250 for 2 hr 20 min, unwrapped foil and slathered on BBQ sauce, baked at 425 for 30 min. Ribs could have been a little more tender, I think I should have baked it longer at 250 and applying a more complex dry rub recipe produces tastier results.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out dry. I used this recipe because it specifically listed the country style ribs in the title and because it was simple and explicit. I opted not to use the "Simple BBQ Ribs" recipe because it didn't seem to use the exact cut of meat I had and gave me no time frame as to how long it takes to "[boil] the ribs until tender". I am going to try that one next time though.

This was so disappointing, after seeing so many great reviews I made this last night when we had company for supper. The meat was not tender at all but tough and dry. I'll go back to using my crock pot and maybe finishing in the oven.

Wow, excellent recipe. They are so tender and flavorful. I used orange slices instead (I didn't have any lemon) and it turned out great. I will never make ribs a different way!

Delicious!  A real crowd pleaser :-)  I added water on the bottom of the pan, baked for 2 hours at 300 and grilled the ribs for 20 min.

These ribs were tough and full of fat.  I used the country style cut pork ribs from Costco so I don't know what I did wrong.  I won't be trying this again.

This recipe is hit and miss... Sometimes it comes out delicious and other times the meat is tough. A great way to do BBQ Ribs in the oven instead of having to use the grill.

The key important factor for me in this recipe is the lower temp and long cooking time-- leads to super moist super tender ribs!  In the past I always cooked them at 300+ and ended up with crisp and sometimes hard edges. This keeps that away!

I am not a huge fan of country syle ribs, I much prefer the baby backs. However, steaming them and then adding the sauce was so easy. The meat falls off the bone and is delicious.

This is just like my recipe for country ribs but with lemon.  I also like to add a thinly sliced red onion during the first bake, before the bbq sauce.  I haven't tried this with lemon, but everything else always produces a winner at my house.

Thank goodness I found this recipe.  My husband loves country style ribs, but I have always thought they would make better dog food than people food.  Following this recipe (foil covered for the first two hours) was so tender, that I have revised my opinion of this cut of meat.  I did half with BBQ sauce and half with steak sauce.  Both were great .

I skipped the lemon, cooked covered in foil, with a little bit of water at 300 for 2.5 hours, then removed the liquid, basted with BBQ sauce, covered with foil again and baked at 275 for an hour.  The whole family liked it.  A good change of pace when country style ribs are on sale.

Very good recipe..I will use again and again.  I followed the recipe as stated.  However, The first two hours I covered with foil.  Then I uncovered and poured on the bbq sauce.  This recipe turned out great.  Country Style ribs make there own juices (perfect for gravy)...no water needed!

This was very good and easy.  I didn't have fresh lemon so just sprinkled a little lemon juice over the ribs.  Husband really like it so will make again.  Thanks for an easy, yummy recipe.

followed the suggestion of other reviewers to add the 1/16" of water on bottom and cover w/foil. Otherwise they were prepared according to recipe. These ribs were very tender and fell right of the bone while trying to flip them over. The lemon wasnt for me though. Perhaps I will try onion next time. Thanks for sharing!

These ribs are very good. I realized after cooking for 2 hours that there was no barbeque sauce in the house so I made my own from a recipe on here  called "Bar-B-Que Sauce".  It was so good.  Only change is that I broiled the ribs for a few minutes to get a nice carmelization of the sauce.

This was an easy weeknight recipe!  I didn't have any steak sauce, so I skipped it. I used bonless country ribs, and cooked them in my dutch oven. When they were done, I topped them with some Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  They were delish.

I have used this method for years.  For those of you who may worry about reviews saying the ribs are too dry or too tough, Watashi's review (23 Feb 2007) is a must read.  (Pg 5 in reviews at present.) And I agree w/Watashi, use any marinade/ basting sauce you like.  Don't limit this wonderful method to BBQ.

It was a good basic recipe.  I made this awhile ago and I still remember the lemon really being overpowering.  I think the next time I make it that it would be better if I just squeezed some lemon on instead of baking it on the ribs.

I made this recipe just as it is written and LOVED them.  I wasn't sure what the lemon would do to the ribs, but it was subtle and wonderful!  I use Sweet Baby Rays sauce.  I would like to try to finish these on the grill sometime.  They are just as tender as I like them.  Many times my ribs turn out too tough...these were perfection.  Thank you for a great simple recipe!

These turned out dry, tough.  They were not cooked nearly long enough to tenderize, and didn't care much for the lemon flavor.

There is no way cooking these large ribs at 250 degrees for 3 hours is enough time. I made them today.....they were not done in that time and they were not one bit tender. Won't ever make them again.

Very good way to make countrystyle ribs. I used the slow cooker on high for 5 hours, we had to leave house. Put 2 onions in bottom, cut very thick, to hold ribs off floor of slow cooker. Then put ribs in oven for final hour at 250. Followed recipe exactly for the ingredients. Totally yummy!

I didn't really care for this recipe.  I was all excited to try it after reading the reviews, but my ribs were tough and not tender like I was expecting.  I even baked them longer than I was supposed to.  Maybe I bought bigger ribs than normal. Also, I splurged and bought our favorite BBQ sauce from a local restaurant, but the taste we love was ruined by the lemon and garlic.  I would like to try to make this recipe again because I love BBQ style ribs, but next time I will probably either leave out the lemon all together or just use a cheap BBQ sauce from the grocery store.

The meat itself came out wonderful. It fell apart easily and was quite moist. I would probably skip the lemon, or maybe try substituting with orange instead. Overall, I'd definitly use this recipe again.

excellent recipe.....

I modified it by mother's standards, use what you you have and improvise! ADD!

I used the 350degree recipe for first
2 hours, then 250 for an additional 30
minutes.

I also used a cheap bottle of yuck bbq
sauce I had left looking lonely in the fridge, added 1oz of liquid smoke, 1tbs
brown (not packed) sugar, and shook the heck out of the bottle of bbq.

This way, the ribs were sticky good. stock up on the paper towels.

WOW, best ribs I've had in quite awhile.

Don't scrimp on the fresh lemon with this one......better really is BETTER.

The best for indoor oven bbq.....

Absolutely the best ever! Falling off the bone tender and super moist and tasty!  Followed the recipe with the exception of time/temp.  Baked for 1 1/2 hrs at 325 and another 40 min. at 250 after adding the BBQ sauce.

We love this recipe...ribs are tender, moist and flavorful! I too, cover mine with foil for the first two hours.
A great recipe to use often as the country style ribs are always reasonably priced!

very good..per suggestions of other reviewers, covered ribs for most of cooking time...don't omit lemon, strange, but it really adds a subtle taste to the ribs that is really delicious.  used jack daniels's hickory brown sugar barbeque sauce..really good.

When I first read the recipe I was intrigued with the use of the lemon.  I prepared this recipe as posted except that during the last half hour I turned the heat up to 325.  It was very near fall of the bone juicy and tender.  I used Cattleman's classic BBQ sauce.    At first when you bite into it you get the kick of the BBQ sauce, then after a few chews, the subtle flavor of the lemon comes through.  Very very tasty!  A keeper.  The BBQ sauce I used has a bit of it's own tartness so next time I might try a sweeter, less tart BBQ sauce, to allow the lemon flavor be more prominent.

I have learned to read as many reviews as possible before I try a recipe, and so I opted for the ease of THEFAMILYCHEF1's changes, but I added an extra 1/2 hour to the first round of cooking (because of others' comments) and I kept the meat covered at all times. It came out perfect, perfect, perfect. As with any recipe calling for BBQ sauce, be very picky about the sauce you choose.  It'll make or break the dish. I will make this over and over again. Inexpensive meat, , expensive taste, and so incredibly easy. YUM, YUM, YUM.

I wanted something easy for these ribs, but a little different.  I put non-stick foil over my pan and it was a cinch to clean!  I was very happy with the outcome of the taste and I kept getting compliments from everyone.  I did use LOTS of fresh garlic and lots of lemon.  I left the lemon on and it made a nice presentation with the sauce over them. I look forward to making these again with some of the variations recommended here... Thanks!

The 1st time I made these, I rated them a 2.  This time I followed the recipe exactly (used my homemade barbecue sauce) and my family ate all of them.  They are a little fatty, and we do prefer babyback ribs, but these were good.

This was easy and a hit with the hubby!The meat fell right off the bone.If you are pressed for time, follow the recipe. If you can spare a few minutes, dust the ribs with flour and brown on both sides before baking. It will also cook down some of the fat. The longer you cook these the better they get! YUM!

The lemon was such an interesting flavor.  It delivered a bite just before introducing the BBQ sauce flavor.  They could have been a bit more tender.  Although, the texture was not bad. . . .about like steak.  Would make again and cook longer!

These ribs were fantastic.  My husband was skeptical when I told him I was making ribs as mine are usually tough and dry.  These were so tender they were falling off the bone.  The kids also loved them.  I will definitely be making these again real soon.

This is a good base, but technique is wrong- if I would have followed as written vs reviews they would have been really dried out. Not rating 5 stars for that. Rubbed w s&p & brown sugar. Did 2hrs COVERED @250, drain, sauced & covered @400 for 1/2 hr then 1/2 hr uncovered. Got a good crust. Husband, 8yr old son, and I all really enjoyed these.

These ribs were AMAZING! Tender and juicy and just awesome. I decided to remove the lemon slices before adding the bbq sauce, and the flavor was just incredible. :)

Such an easy recipe!!  I did make some changes. My ribs were BIG.  I did not use lemon.  I did put a little water in the bottom of the pan.  I made a rub of garlic powder, onion powder salt and fresh pepper.  I marinated the ribs in this rub for about an hour.  Baked in a 325 oven for 2 hours covered in tin foil.  After 2 hours removed foil and drained all the liquid.  Slathered with BBQ sauce and put back into oven lowering temp to 275 for 45 minutes uncovered.  Delish and so tender!!

We really liked this recipe. I had to change it a bit. I followed recipe until the end. I turned the temp to 350 and added 40 minutes. Perfect after that. BBQ sauce glazed onto ribs.

I tried this recipe, and they are very tender. I used orange slices, instead of lemon, and I put some apple juice in the bottom of the pan, under a roasting rack. AWESOME!

This was the easiest recipe and my family LOVED it!  I sprinkled a little meat tenderizer and garlic powder on the ribs before baking too. Best rib recipe ever! will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it as written except I didn't have any lemons, so I sliced up an orange instead.   I did use a tiny bit of water in the bottom, and covered with foil the first two hours.  Then I drained the liquid and covered with sauce, recovered with foil for about 30 minutes, then took off the foil and finished the last 15 minutes or so uncovered.  These are the best ribs I have ever had!  My husband has passed the "rib torch" to me permanently!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good.  I made a LOT of ribs - about 8 pounds on 2 trays.  I had to increase the temperature to cook them just to be sure and they came out great. The juices spilled over in my oven - not fun- and they weren't done cooking so I had to drain them early. Next time, I'll keep a closer eye on them and drain them halfway through.  My ribs were a little fatty and I wish I had take the time to trim them prior to cooking.  That would have helped with juice and presentation. Still, it was very good.  I followed recipe exactly except the cooking temperature.  The lemons seemed strange to me but the worked and I didn't notice a strong lemon flavor to the meat either.

My ribs turned out wonderfully cooked.  I was short on time so I cooked them for 2 hours at 325 covered, added BBQ sauce and cooked for 30 minutes at 275 and then 20 minutes without cover. I also cooked them in the little bit of water.  They were wonderful and not in the least dry... thing is I've never had county style pork ribs before and I don't really like them.  I bought them because they were on sale (and I've never cooked ribs before,) and then found the recipe.  My son enjoyed them but these are not the ribs I'm used to.  The recipe was wonderful and thank you!

Ok flavor, basically depends on the B-B-Q sauce used I guess. But unfortunately not tender at all. Was very disappointed as I was just looking for an alternative to my tried and true crockpot method, which I think I'll post for others. I made this exactly as the recipe said, and cooked the full time at 250. Hubby will eat it since he actually LIKES to pull and chew on ribs. I however, prefer them to be to "fall off the bone" tender, which these were not. Sorry

Amazing. I used the foil, water in the bottom of the pan and baked at 300 for the first two hours. I used Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce - and they turned out wonderfully tender. My boyfriend is still making yummy sounds!

Very good!  We couldn't taste the lemon that much - but I think it did help add an extra depth of flavor and helped balance out the bbq sauce.  Will use again!  Thanks!

perfect & easy- followed directions exactly & they came out even better than I expected! It's a keeper! We used less than half a bottle of bbq sauce, just brushed & coated the ribs and they were great! You can totally taste the garlic & lemon infused in the meat, so good! My 3 year old loved them too!

I took reviewer Sande's advice - I covered bottom of pan in 1/16" water, sealed tightly with foil and cooked ribs 2 hrs. at 300. I then opened foil and drained all juices off. I covered ribs in 18 oz of BBQ sauce and 1 tsp. dried onion flakes. I then replaced foil and cooked at 275 for another 40 minutes.

These weren't as tender as I thought they would be and we cooked them longer than the recipe stated. I followed another reviewers suggestion and had my mom cover them for the first part of baking, then she poured the juices out and topped them with bbq sauce and recovered for 40 min. then left them uncovered for another hour or so. I will try other country style rib recipes. Thank you....

These were great.  The only change I made was to add a little bit of orange juice to the pan during the first baking.  They were very moist and delicious.  We will definitely be making these again.

I didn't follow the recipe as submitted. I added 1/16" of water and skipped the lemon. I prepared the meat by seasoning ribs as I do for baby back ribs: salt, garlic pepper, garlic powder, paprika. I baked them as written and used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque sauce. It was delicious!

I made this for dinner and my husband loved it.  I may cook it for another hour and cover the ribs as well, but it was great all around.  I will use this recipe again!

I followed the last reviewers procedure for the recipe, except that I only had boneless country ribs,and I think that makes the difference in the result being more a 4 star than a 5 star.  Some of the ribs were better than others.  Some were somewhat dry, so I'm thinking the bone makes all the difference.  Next time I'll try the bone-in and see if it makes the recipe a 5 star.

My husband loved these ribs.  I cooked them covered for 2 hours at 300 degrees with a small amount of water and apple cider vinegar.  I uncovered them, drained the liquid and added the BBQ sauce and cook at 250 for additional hour.  Great.

I baked with lemons for 2 hours at 300, then added sauce and baked for 40 more minutes at 275, as another poster had suggested.  Beware that this is an extremely fatty cut of meat, but awesome!  The only thing I would change is the lemon slices.  It kind of gave it a cleaner like flavor.  Picky BF LOVED them though!  Used homemade sauce from what I had on hand.  (2 C. Ketchup, 1/2 c. apple cider vinegar, dash of A1 and balsamic, 2tbs. prepared mustard, 1tsp each paprika, chili powder and garlic powder, 1tbs. worcestershire and half an onion minced and cooked until translucent)

This was an excellent recipe.  I did not change a thing.  What a great way to cook an inexpensive cut of meat, and I think the lemon is key to the tenderness of the meat.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Every time I've made this it has been highly praised.  I've used lemon juice in place of the lemon slices and haven't had any ill effects from it.  My fiance LOVES it, and my two sons actually sit down at the table long enough to eat this too.  This is certainly going to be some thing that stays around for a long time.

Yummy!  I was skeptical about this recipe, but the ribs came out so yummy and tender.  There was not enough for everyone.  For BBQ Sauce I use two, 3/4 Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar and 1/4 Kraft Honey Hickory.

This recipe is the best!  I did add a thin layer of water to the bottom of the roasting pan with a small amount of Liquid Smoke.  I didn't have any lemons, but will use them the next time.

I have two a 4 and a 5 y/o that I have a hard time getting them to eat meat of any kind. I did this recipe and they LOVED it! The meat (as they said) was juicy and tender, not chewy. It was so good! Just like it melt in your mouth! I love that it is so easy. With the two kids it's hard to cook a good hot meal like this one! I love that you just put it in the oven and walk away for a few hours! Very tasty and made the house smell great!! Thank you; I finally have something that they love!!

I followed the cooking times exactly, but found it to be tough and not the fall off the bone kind like I like.  I noticed alot of people increased the cooking temperature.  I probably should have too because I was really disappointed.  Maybe it was the meat itself.  Next time I think I would try the crock pot.  I seem to have the best luck with it.

Delicious, moist, fork-tender ribs! One of the best recipes I have found. I used country style pork ribs, lemon juice (instead of fresh lemon slices), jarred minced garlic and regular Kraft BBQ sauce. Based on other reviewers, I added a bit of water to the baking dish (and covered w/foil), increased initial cooking time to 2.5 hours, then cooked 1 hour at 300 to finish them off. Can't wait to try this with regular baby back ribs, and perhaps a different BBQ sauce.

Thank you! These turned out amazing. I did put on a little dry rub and let them sit for a few hours before cooking. I forgot to buy a lemon, so I just used a little lemon juice and then we grilled them for a few minutes to finish. Nice Work!

so yummy and tender!  We loved them!  I did add famous dave's rib rub to them the day before I made them. I put them in the oven on 350 for  1 1/2 hours and then threw them on the grill to sauce them and finish them up.  This was the way to do it!  They were a major hit!

My husband bought beef back ribs and had never done anyhting with them.  Finally, as they were the only thing left in the freezer I braved attempting to cook them (felt like Wilma Flintstone!). I was hestitant to try because I wasn't sure how these would turn out.  But I'm glad I went ahead.  I did add a little water to the simmering process but otherwise followed cooking directions as stated.  They tasted sooo good.  Thanks for a great simple recipe idea. Oh and I now have a ton of room in the freezer :D

These were amazing!  I did do a few things differently.  Hotter temperature to start them.  I covered with foil for both cooking times.  After spreading the garlic on, I sprinkled on some oregano and cayenne.  They were great!!

My family LOVED these ribs!  I only gave it four stars though, because I did need to adjust the cooking time.  I cooked for 3 hours on 225 degrees, then after adding the sauce, I cooked for another 1.5 hours.  They came out really tender though!  (we tried the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce for the first time and have a new favorite BBQ sauce!  Thanks for those who suggested it!)

wonderfull!!  my husband loved it!!  i will be making this dish often!  i didn't have any lemons in the house so i put an 1/6" water on bottom of pan and sprinkled ribs with some lemon juice.  next time i will use real lemons though, i bet it adds an interesting flavor to the ribs.  our favorite bbq sauce is "sweet baby rays".

These were absolutely delicious!  I rubbed some creole seasoning mix on them along with some fresh chopped garlic before putting the lemon slices on top.  I also cooked them 3 hours before taking the cover off and cooking them the additional hour.  I'll be using this one a lot!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm so glad to have this website.  Any time I want to try a different type of recipe, I just look it up and I found this wonderful recipe for these ribs.  They tasted exactly as I wanted as I used my own sauce of ketsup and HP sauce (love that combination).  They were as tender as they could possibly be.  I'll be making this recipe a favorite.

WOW sooooooo good!!   I changed it just a bit-  I used garlic cloves instead of the powder- also I put less sugar and cayenne in in the marinate sauce.  Put in the fridge overnight. Sauteed onions in olive oil and put on top of the ribs for extra flavor-  added a little water (just barely filled bottom of pan)  so the it would steam the ribs and they wouldn't dry out. Baked in covered clay dish.   Took ribs out 20 minn before eating- drained access water and covered them in KC Masterpiece "Honey Smoke"  BBQ sauce.  Put back in the oven on low temp till ready to eat.   Sooooo delicious!!!   They had a little bit of kick mixed with a sweet smokey flavor. Will  be making these again lots!!

This recipe was fantastic!  I was a little skeptical-thinking the the meat would be dry, but it was very tender and juicy!  Much better than some crock pot recipes that I have tried!  Will make again for sure.  I did have to bake a bit longer.

I used the cooking method is all. Pepper the pork, cooked for 2 hours, then put the BBQ sauce on, then cooked for the other hour. Great, keeper in this house.

These simple, quick-to-prepare ribs turned out delicious. I made my batch with eight ribs instead of ten, and took the advice of others and cooked about 30 minutes longer before adding the sauce. I also used lemon juice instead of lemon slices, but I wish I had done the slices because the lemon flavor didn't really come through; the garlic worked out wonderfully, however. The leftovers are just as good (maybe better!) As the fresh product. Thanks so much!

Thank you Glenda this makes wonderful tender ribs. I had been boiling then grilling but thought they were just too hard and not quite right and this makes them wonderful. The king of the castle loved them (a tough test to pass I tell you) and even though yes it takes more time this way it is well worth it. I didn't have the lemon so used another review idea of basting w/little olive oil and then sprinkled seasongs over it and anyone can use their favorite BBQ sauce. You have changed my rib cooking ways......

This is a great recipe!!  It was very easy, and my husband raved about it.  I read some of the reviews where it did not turn out tender.  I used really good thick ribs, and it was very tender.  And it was infused with just the right amount of garlic so you tasted more than the BBQ sauce.  I will definately make this again.

I changed this recipe up a bit because I did not have any fresh lemons at the time.  I made a dry rub out of barbecue seasoning and the garlic.  The ribs were tasty and tender.  The end pieces were a little tough and dry, but next time I'll just take those out before they dry out.

I thought it could use more seasoning but the over all flavor was good. I'm not really big on country style ribs cause they seem to be like rubber even though they were cooked for a long time. I would use this recipe again but on spareribs or baby back ones.

My country style ribs were really lean (from Walmart, if you can believe it) so I should have covered them with foil for the first 2 hours.  It took forever to get them tender and I will never use this particular method again.  I knew they should have been covered but I thought I'd  go by the recipe.  Big mistake.  They took over 6 hours to get to the tender of stage of 190°-200°.  Be warned ... you must cover them first, especially if they don't have much fat on them.

Country style ribs aren't all the same. They either are from the front or rear portion of the loin. The boneless ones are from the rear portion (most all the time). They don't need low and slow. Just cook them until 130º and let them rest. You can stove top them in a pan. Save yourself some time.

We added garlic powder along with the fresh since we LOVE garlic. We'very made this several times and it always gets raved about. Sometimes we do the final barbq step over charcoal.  We'version never bothered to cover the pan and they always turn out melt-in-your-mouth good!

Was tender and I liked the lemon flavor. I cut the lemon very thinly and before I put the BBQ sauce on I added some very thin sliced onion. Would make again.

O.M.G!  READ THE REVIEWS. Because of the reviews, I put the heat at 300, added a small bit of water, and covered the ribs with foil. After 3 hours, I added the bbq sauce and lowered the temp and cooked another 45 minutes. We ate them with a fork!
Next time I'll reduce the beginning time. Oh yeah, there will be a next time!

I have made this twice and my husband loves them.  I followed "Sande's" cooking method. (First review).   We particularly like slathering  our ribs with regular mustard, sprinkle with soy sauce and liquid smoke and then seasoning with dry rub from Germantown Commissary  (a local BBQ joint here). Also use the Germantown Commissary BBQ sauce.  They came out perfectly moist and falling off the bone.

Looking for a sure fire way to cook my ribs and this was perfect. I seasoned ( seasoning salt, garlic and parsley.. and used Wegmans Asian BBQ sauce) to my liking and cooked at 300 for 2 hours covered and 40 min uncovered. MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!

Fantastic as written, have made this multiple times now.  Can just sprinkle liberally with onion/garlic powder/lemon pepper if you don't have or don't want to use minced garlic or lemon.  Other sauces work, too, we really liked steak sauce and teriyaki sauce (not together, LOL) instead of the barbecue.  Easy to customize flavors!

I had a large portion of mostly boneless Country Style ribs.  There was 8 or 9 slices.  I bought three small lemons, and layered the ribs in a 6qt dutch oven with lemon slices.  I rubbed my ribs with McCormick's slow cooker rib spice packet.  I added a bit of water, but that wasn't necessary.  I cooked at 275 for 2.5 hours, drained the juices (they were almost covering the ribs), added one bottle of store brand Kansas City style sauce and cooked another hour.  The ribs totally are falling apart in chunks and pretty great!

I made it again, 5/2015.  So, I only had three ribs and one lemon.  Put the three ribs in a 9x9 glass baking dish.  Covered with thinly sliced lemon.  Also, quartered a whole onion and put that it as well.  Covered with Aluminum foil and cooked 2 hours  @ 250f.  un-covered, drained liquid, removed lemon, added 1883 steak sauce because no bbq sauce.  Re-covered pan, and cooked another 1,5 hours.  very tender and tasty.  No salt or spices except what's in the sauce.  Very good.

I also changed it up some and they were enjoyed by everyone.  I browned them first all over and used a dry rub of garlic powder, rosemary, season salt, black pepper, smokey paprika, brown sugar and chili powder. Covered for first two hours and used Sweet Baby sweet and spicy for last hour uncovered. They came out super tender and moist. Probably the best non smoked ribs I have done. Think the lemon does something special to the meat!  Enjoy!

The kids said they were okay. They liked the sauce, but didn't ask for seconds. Part of it was the cut of meat (too fatty), but overall I didn't get rave reviews. Worth trying again though.

Made this for the family (including picky eaters) and they loved it! I followed the recipe and before topping the ribs with lemon I sprinkled them with kosher salt, minced onion, and minced garlic. Turned out fabulous and this one will be added to our dinner rotation.

This was delicious! I featured it on my blog FoodToTheMax here: http://foodtothemax.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/bbq-country-style-ribs/ Seriously, good. I didn't change the recipe other than to use lemon juice instead of fresh lemon slices, and dried garlic instead of fresh garlic. So good!!

I omitted the lemons and scattered lots of sliced onions in the pan, also poured in a little beer.  Good, but I think I will stick with pork back ribs from now on.  Thanks.

So good.  Instead of lemon rings, I added lemon pepper.  I also added the minced garlic and some garlic powder and season salt.   I put Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce on.

My family loved this recipe!  I did what one user suggested and put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan and closed it up tightly with foil and cooked it at 250 for 2 hours. Drained the liquid and covered the ribs with Sonny's BBQ sauce.  Covered it tightly with aluminum foil again and cooked for one more hour.  It was AMAZING!  The meat just fell off the bone.  I will never cook them on the gril again!

This recipe was sooo good. This will be my second time making it within one month. The only thing I did different was to use a homemade barbeque sauce that is found on this site. Its called Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce. Incredible. I like these style ribs better cause you get more meat for your dollar, but you still get some bones in there for flavor.

These ribs are the best!!  I often buy them when on sale in the store and make a delicious treat for the family to enjoy!  My husband and I rave over them!!  Can't begin to describe how succulent and flavorful these ribs are!  Highly recommended!  (I am very generous on extra lemon slices and garlic for lots of flavor)

This is a great way to cook country style ribs, they came out perfect. The ribs were on sale this week, plus it was the end of the week and they were in the clearance bin, so for $2 a pound, I got 6# (a GREAT price for Anchorage, AK).  Great recipe and method for this cut of meat.  Thanks!

I made these ribs for dinner today. My grocer had country ribs on sale last week for so I decided to try these. They are delicious! Not at all dry or tough-in fact mine gort almost too tender. I actually had tocut down the cooking time. I went with 325 for 1 1/2 hours then added sauce and turned down to 225 and cooked for only 30 min more. Try these and you'll love them!

These ribs were absolutely delicious.  And so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I did not use the lemon slices as I did not have any on  hand.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce.  These were so tender and juicy cooked this way.

This recipe was AMAZING although I did change it up some. here are my changes -I used 'KC MAsterpiece marinade Caribbean Jerk' covered ribs w/marinade and let sit wrapped foil over night in frig. I used 2 sliced oranges with peel in the botton of crock pot, placed ribs over top with 1.5 cup marinade. let cook 3hrs on low. removed ribs from crock pot placed on cooking rack, GENEROUSLY cover ribs with marinade-bake at 200degress for 30 mins -this time in the oven will coat ribs and make more appealing for serving. Wonderful flavor with a mild hint of orange to the pork.  YUM will make again!!

These tasted good, but didn't think they were anything special.  I didn't notice any difference with the lemon; just tasted the bbq sauce.  I usually slow boil ribs in homemade bbq sauce  for 2 to 2 1/2 hours depending on the thickness of the ribs, then stick them in a 250 degree oven for 1/2 hour with some more sauce.  This makes the sauce stick to the ribs AND the meat still falls off the bone.

We always make baby back ribs but decided to try the country ribs.  This was easy to make and I agree with others that the lemon really does add a lot to the dish. All said I done - we prefer the baby backs and will use this recipe cutting back on the cooking time when I am in a rush.  Really did enjoy that lemon flavor in it!  Thanks submitter.

Even my pickiest eater loved these.  Cover them with foil or they will be dry.

Excellent!  I covered the ribs and upped the temp. of the oven to 350 for 2 hours.  Added sauce (locally made apple butter bbq sauce - awesome) and dropped the temp to 300 for another half hour.  Incredibly moist, flavorful ribs.

I loved this recipe...as did my husband.
For the first time my ribs were moist and tender. I used lemon juice and two cloves of garlic freshly minced.

With trying to get ready for Christmas, I'm always on the look out for "simple."  We really liked these!  I did cover them based on the reviews & won't do that next time.  They had plenty of liquid, & I think they might have a little better "crust" if not covered (or at least not the whole time).  I also just eyeballed the garlic & used enough lemon to pretty much cover the ribs.  My husband asked "what's the orange flavor" :)

Good Flavor....I liked the garlic and lemon flavor on the meat.  I also used Durkee's Chicken and Rib Rub, which I highly recommend if you can find it. I will remember this recipe in the future, but will still try other recipes.

I grew up eating a similar dish regularly and it's simply amazing (although I never tried it with lemon).  

The sauce we used was KC Masterpiece original with added cayenne pepper and light karo syrup to taste. So delicious!

The flavor was good but I must of done something wrong. I followed others suggestions and covered the dish. I also baked longer than stated based on the others, but Mine came out slightly dry. Will keep looking for a recipe that gives consistent results.

This was a pretty easy recipe as it promised to be but I wasn't so excited by the garlic.  I wish I would have either put on less, or none at all.  Also the ribs needed to be baked a little longer than the recipe called for.

This was my first attempt at ribs, I thought they were very good.  I followed the recipe exactly using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I had 2 half full bottles, one original and one hot and spicy, so I used them both up.  Very tender and lemon added nice undertone.

if you are not a huge fan of lemons, replace with another ingredient, lemon was kind of overpowering on this one, and also use a good bbq sauce

Very good recipe... loved the addition of garlic and lemon. I baked these at 250 for 2 hrs., drained them and baked for 1 more hr. w/ bbq sauce. Next time I'm going to try 225 for 3 hrs, just to see if I can get them more tender... mine still weren't falling off the bone!

Used boneless ribs.  Maybe the bones would have made these more juicy but they tunred out a little dry and garlicy for us.  However, mother and father in law did enjoy them.  Definitely use a good BBQ sauce- no cheapies.

Great! Oh so tender! I did leave out the lemon, and for the second baking, I put them on the grill and basted them with the sauce. Our family enjoys the char-broiled flavor.  On the grill on medium/high heat, they were totally done in 30 mins. Served them to guests during the Colts football game and all raved!  Thank you!

This is great!  My neighbors are from up north and hadn't been subjected to southern BBQ in the winter (oven). They asked me for the recipe - said they had never tasted anything like it.  Wonderful for those cold days when you are inside.  Thanks Glenda U.

I was so disappointed in how these turned out. I even made a great sauce from scratch. My ribs were bone-in and I baked them as directed, but I should have paid attention to the reviewers that baked them longer. They were just not tender. Next time I will stick to my reliable indoor method of steaming them first then baking with sauce.

Just wanted to update kn this. I replaced the lemon slices with sunkist naval orange slices. I also used a spicy buffalo bbq sauce for people who like spicy food. I however, do not love spicy foods. I did try them, but by the time I had finished that 1st rib My eyes and nose were both watering!! Hahahha

I prepared this using the ingredients as written and we really enjoyed the ribs. I wasn't too sure about the lemon but my husband declared it delicious. I used the listed heat but did cover the ribs in foil for the first 2 hours and then left them uncovered. They were cooked well and juicy. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This one is always a winner in our house.  Only changes I made were to not use the lemon (just didn't seem to bring anything to the party) and use a custom BBQ sauce rather than store bought.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! The ribs were falling off the bone and when no leftovers remain it's a hit! this is how I will always cook these!

I made these according to the directions, and at 2 hours, when I removed the foil, I could tell they were done and moist. I should have doused them in bbq sauce and let them go another 15-20 minutes, but I left them almost the entire hour. They were a little dry. Next time I will know better.

I didn't have time to bake mine quite as long so I baked at 300 for one hour, added sauce and then another hour. Baked in my enameled cast iron with lid on. Quite tasty.

I followed the recipe as stated. Unfortunately the ribs were very tough. For me they need to bake a lot longer.

Moist and flavourful and so easy.  Made as written in recipe but used less barbeque sauce as personal preference.

Gave it 4 stars because I made some changes in cooking this. I had 2.5lbs pork ribs. Added 1 cup water with 3 tbsp lemon juice and diced garlic on top. Covered it with foil.  Set the oven at 375 and it was cooked at 1hr and 45mins. Mixed 1 cup of coke with 2 cups of bbq sauce and poured it  all over the ribs, placed it back in the oven covered for another 30 mins. You will have extra for the sauce, you can warm it up for those that want some dipping.  Don't forget to check the internal temperature, preferably to hit 180. It was super delicious!!!

Pretty good. Kind of dry. It would not have had much for flavor if not for the bbq sauce. I think I’ll go back to dry rubs and try some of the other suggestions in the comments.

I've made this a couple of times.  I'm not very good at cooking meat, so I thought the first time was a fluke, it was delicious.  The second time was just as good.  I did modify the temperatures and cooking times, but it's still consistently good.  This is a keeper, one I'm going to be rotating into my regular dinners.

I thought the lemon was an odd addition, when I made them for family that came up from Florida they were a big hit. So big that my sister-in-law texted me a couple days after she got home asking for the recipe so she could make them for her husband!

First recipe from this site that was a complete and utter disaster wish I'd gone for a 6 hour recipe at least then I wouldn't be sitting round waiting for a meal that should have been on the table hours ago. 2 hours at 250 then the third hour at 250 as well then another hour at 300 now having thrown out what was going to be served with it, came into contact with raw pork before I realized still not done, have put it back in the oven at 400 to try and get something edible this evening.

Baked at 275 for 2 hours and then put in slow cooker on low for 4 hours with the bbq sauce.  Next time would add more bbq sauce but otherwise it was great!

These were delicious.  I did cover them with foil (no water or broth added) and cooked them at 300 because they were really meaty and I didn't have any extra time in case they weren't done.  I slathered them with BBQ sauce and lighty covered them & put them back in the oven at 350 with a potato dish I made for the last hour.  Tender, and delicious, and all of the fat melted away.  Will definitely make again.

2 hrs at 250  dried them out terribly.  Wish I had done the covered/stewed method others mentioned.

Personally I liked these. 4* from me. My husband rates it a 3 (he's not a huge pork fan so a 3 isn't too bad), but my kids weren't interested in this and just ate the baked rice dish I served alongside it. Won't be making again since the family weren't keen.

Made these as directed with the tip  in the footnote (ribs with garlic and lemon slices wrapped in aluminum foil and baked at 250 degrees for two hours. Removed lemon slices and drained liquid, added barbecue sauce and rewrapped in aluminum foil and baked for another hour). Turned out tender and delicious. P.S. I used a digital meat thermometer to check that they were cooked to the correct temperature. (The acid from the lemon slices helps tenderize the meat and provides moisture too).

Fabulous and simple. I wasn't sure what the lemons purpose was, but the scent alone was great. I think it tenderized the meat. Absolutely going in my favorites to make again.

I am so glad I found this recipe in here!  This is the way my mom used to do the short ribs, except instead of lemon she used orange slices.  That is the only difference.  Comes out tender, moist and ummmm ummmmm good!!!

I followed the recipe but added salt and pepper to taste.  I usually make my country style ribs like this but have never put lemon slices on them before and wasn't sure what they'd taste like but thought I'd try it anyway since I did have a couple of small fresh lemons in the fridge so I used one of them sliced very thin.  Baking country style ribs in the oven covered with heavy duty foil always makes your ribs tender and moist with or without the added lemon.  I found that adding the lemon did add a lemony taste to our ribs which I liked but hubby didn't care for otherwise I would have given this dish a 5 star rating. I used a store brand bottled BBQ sauce which we like.  I will be making these again and again but not adding the lemon. I myself found them very tasty with the lemon which added a unique flavor to the meat.

This did not turn out as tender as I  would like, although the flavor was good. I covered the ribs with foil, cooking it at 300 at 2.5 hours, the last half hour did help tenderize the neat. The lemon added a great flavor. Use Sweet Baby Rays.

I followed the original recipe perfectly. It went together quickly and it smelled great. After the 3 hour cooking time I pulled it out and it was not done. It had to cook another full hour until it was done. I am not sure what I did, but after delaying an already late supper to extremely late, we did not really enjoy these ribs. I might make it again and par boil the ribs first, leave off the lemon and be prepared for extra cooking time.

I loved this recipe.  Very simple, and the  meat was tender when it was finished.  The only modification I made was for the last 5 minutes, I turned up the heat to 425 F so that the BBQ would be sticky.  YUM!  I'll make this again.

End flavors were perfect! However, I braised them covered instead of using an open baking sheet. Slow braising or (or baking, as in the recipe) makes the pork super tender and flavorful- you can't rush it or the pork fat won't render as well  (I braised them longer than the recipe) . The garlic and lemon balance well with the fat and a popular sweet BBQ sauce. The last hour at 250 lets the sauce slowly breakdown into the meat and thicken. I used an enamel coated cast iron pan and lid and seared the meat on the stove top with salt and pepper in the same pan. Then I added the garlic and lemon (I also added a half a can of cola for a braising liquid). I covered it in the oven for the first 2-3 hours. Then I removed the lemons and added the sauce and finished for another hour uncovered. Served it with homemade mac 'n' cheese and steamed asparagus. Simple and delicious.

Loved this, even daughter who isn't fond of BBQ loved it so it's a keeper at my house. My only critique is a little less sauce, did love the Lemon flavor, good counter point to the sauce. I didn't have regular lemons, had several Meyer Lemons and that's what I used but I don't think it would matter, this is just a good, quick and easy recipe.

I had a small amount of boneless country ribs that I completely sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I also topped with some minced jarred garlic. I skipped the lemon because it didn't appeal to me. I lined my 9" square pan with foil. I then followed the suggestions given by the top reviewer, added 1/16" water, covered with foil and baked at 300degF for 2 hrs. Drained off liquid at this point. I had some Trader Joe's Korean BBQ sauce that needed to be used up, so I topped the ribs with that (delicious, btw). Then lowered temp to 275degF and baked another 40 min. Very moist ribs. Had with Easy Bok Choy  from this site (great) and a baked potato. Good recipe that I will repeat. Thank you!

I personally am not a huge rib fan.  However, I  prepare and cook them for my family from time with mixed results...but never great results. I prepared and cooked  the ribs exactly as the  recipe  recommended. They  turned out  perfect! My family loved them. I even enjoyed a few. All leftovers were gone the following day!

Best Recipe for BBQ country ribs!
I had no lemon, so since the recipe needed the acid I sprinkled rice wine vinegar instead.  I used our family's favorite bottled bbq sauce also.  Other then those changes I followed the recipe.These turned out so moist and tender and delicious!!! this is such an easy recipe!! I will do this again!

I moved to an apartment with no area for a bbq grill, and this is the best recipe I've found for indoor ribs. I've made this a few times in a crockpot, and it's amazing. The lemon sounds odd, but works. It keeps the ribs moist, while adding a bit of acidity to help tenderize. Love it.

Great ribs! Instead of twice baked I seasoned with salt, pepper and some dry Kansas City  Barbecue BBQ seasoning and browned ribs in  little olive oil. Lined the baking dish with aluminum foil and placed the ribs on BBQ sauce then covered them with BBQ sauce and water. Covered ribs and baked for 3 hours. They melted in your mouth good.

the inside juicy as all heck.

This is an excellent recipe! I didn't deter at all from the recipe. I used sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce and baked the last hour at 200 degrees as suggested. The only thing I would do different next time is add more fresh garlic. Thanks for sharing!

Hard to go wrong with this.  Very good, easy to prepare.  A lot depends upon the BBQ sauce you use.  Use the sauce you like and what meets the requirement of your pallet.  Since the oven temp is so low this is not  bad indoor recipe for summer.

Excellent flavor and fairly easy to make! Came out juicier than most pork ribs I've tasted. We combined techniques listed to maximize flavor and moisture. Used the garlic and lemon as in the original, but cooked covered it at 300 with water in the bottom of a broiler pan for 2 hrs, then drained and added sauce and recovered at 275 for another 40 minutes. The lemon adds a nice flavor combined with the garlic and it's super juicy, falling off the bone delicious!

I use this recipe everytime i makes these except i leave out the lemon slices.  I use open pit BBQ and the only thing i do different is, after the 3rd hour i broil them for about 5 minutes just to give them a crisp outside!

Even though I followed the directions, my meat was dry. I believe that had more to do with the cut of meat I had as opposed to the cooking instructions so I will try again. The flavor was good.

This the easiest way to make the most tender, fall apart ribs ! Takes a little time , but its so worth it.
Boiled for 45min, baked @ 350 in foil with salt, pepper, fresh onion, garlic and bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece... i know i cheated..lol) for 45min, topped with more bbq sauce and broiled with foil open for 25 min, 
this was only a meal for 2 (about 6 ribs)so times may vary for yours.
excellent results without a lot of work!

After reading the reviews, I decided to bake them with a tiny bit of water in the bottom of the pan and covered with foil.  I sprinkled liberally with garlic powder and some salt & pepper, then sprinkled lemon juice over them (I had no fresh lemons on hand, which wasn't a surprise to me).  Baked at 300 for 2 hrs., then upped the temp to 350, covered them in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and baked uncovered for another half hr. or so.  Served with buttered noodles and green beans on the side.  Made for a simple and delicious meal, that my kids scarfed down!

This meal has become a beloved staple in our household.  Not just for the taste (which is amazing), but for how simple it is to prepare.  The prep time is  admittedly somewhat of a wait, but well worth it.

I browned the ribs, then covered with sliced onions and sliced green peppers, when the ribs were cooked and tender I added the bar be que sauce and cooked for about another 1/2 hour then broiled the ribs until they glazed.

Very good taste but I would cover this as I cook it. I think that would make it more moist.

Slap your momma these were so stinking good!! I bought a family pack of pork and these ribs were part of the package. I honestly had no clue what the difference was or how to prepare them. I followed this recipe to the T and my entire family raved about them. Very easy, quick and extremely delicious. I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and basted the ribs a few times during the last hour while the baked at 225. I'll definetly be buying this cut of meat again!!

This technique resulted in a fantastically tender country pork rib!!  I put the ribs on a shallow roasting pan, put about a 1/2 cup of water in the bottom and tightly covered the pan with foil. I didn't have the full amount of time the recipe called for so I turned on the convection feature on my oven, set the temp to 275 and cooked the ribs for 1.5 hrs. I then slathered the ribs with a homemade BBQ sauce and put them back in the oven uncovered for 30 mins. Delish!!!

I made these this evening delicious!!!!! I added head country seasoning salt, brown sugar, Lipton onion packet, garlic powder, and McCormick Bbq seasoning. I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I put a little water at the bottom of the pan. I slow cooked in the oven as suggested at 300 for 2 hrs and cooked another hour with (head & country)bbq sauce at 275.  They were the best EVER!!!! Great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe I use this model, no changes other than I use some cola or some Ginger ale when I marinate the meat.  It is perfect for when it is too cold outside to grill.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I usually cook my ribs on the grill but it was raining last week and tried this recipe.  Excellent flavor and tender.  I made "Big Al's Barbeque Sauce" from this site and the ribs were killer.  I brined the ribs overnight before continuing with this recipe which I've found makes many cuts of meat more tender.  When I warmed them up for leftovers, I put them on the grill for 30 minutes on low and they were even better.  Great job!

I substituted limes for lemon, and cooked half with BBQ sauce and half without. They all came out tender, but there was no detectable citrus flavor. Good cooking method, but I'll look for different ingredients next time.

These were pretty good. Next time I'll season the ribs more and sear then before I out them in the oven. Also, these taste much better the next day.

Love it.  The ribs just fell apart.  I think I'll just experiment with different sauces to try to please the kids.

This was a good recipe, but I much prefer ribs done on the grill.  I applied the BBQ sauce after the first hour, and it was completely burned when finished.  If I try again, I'll wait and put the sauce on with just 1/2 an hour left to cook.

Wow!  Great ribs.  We made sure to use a high quality BBQ sauce.  Ours was hot and spicy with little bit of sweet.  The best thing about these was it was a great dinner that was super easy to prepare.

Very very good ribs. Just a bit dry, but still very good.  The sauce will definately make or break this recipe. I will definately make this one again!

Made these for a group get together on a rainy afternoon and there were none left. It was a perfectly easy and yummy recipe with the added benefit of making the entire house smell great. I will make these again. I did cook an extra half hour on each end though.
