YUM! Very satisfying, and rich. I have to fight my kids to get one!) I only had regular-sized M&M's, and they worked just fine. I also used the fat free condensed milk and it didn't change the outcome at all.

I don't think I will be making these again.  when I tried to cut them, it was hard to get them out of the pan without them falling apart and most of the topping fell off.  After reading the other reviews, I guess I could have done something wrong, but with such a simple recipe, I am not sure what I could have possibly done to make them turn out that way.

This is such a good recipe, and using regular sweetened condensed milk works great, too. Also, instead of m&m's or other candies, try 2cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, it tastes great!

Great & simple recipe! I used reg. sized easter colored M&M's for the 7th graders I work with, for easter, & used no coconut or nuts, & they loved them!  I crushed grahmam crackers, but it would have been even easier with bought crumbs. Thanks!

Preeetty darn good! I loved the butter/graham cracker crust. What troubled me is that I found no such thing as chocolate condensed milk in the store. Perhaps this was obvious and I'm an idiot for saying it, but I just used chocolate syrup, and perhaps a bit too much. I'd make'em again, but you have to be careful with this one.
