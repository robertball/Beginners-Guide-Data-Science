This was delicious!  Of course I made some changes:
First, I doubled the recipe and...
*I sauteed all the veggies together in olive oil and when tender removed from heat
*Substituted half of the milk with heavy cream
*Used 2 tsp "Better than Boullion" chicken stock dissolved in 2c. boiling water instead of the water and granules and chicken stock
*Only added 1c. cheddar cheese for the doubled recipe
*Omitted the marjoram, thyme, and salt
*It was super delicious!!  Will make again and again!

Delicious!!!  The taste is great, I did add about another 1/2 cup of milk because it was a little too thick for me.  I also added another cup of diced ham just because I had leftovers from Christmas dinner and I thought it could use a little more.  I will definitly make again.

I was looking for something to make to use up the leftover ham and corn from Christmas dinner and this fit the bill nicely.  It's simple and tasty!  I didn't have any chicken bouillon, celery, marjoram, or even creamed corn (I just tossed in about a 1/3 cup of half and half to make it a little creamy).  I doubled the recipe and realized I only had about a cup of cheddar cheese... so monterey jack was a good stand-in.  I don't have a dutch oven, so I just whipped it up in my stock pot.  

I really appreciate a "base" recipe and this one proves versatile enough to switch up the players.  I'm looking forward to trying it again with whatever else I have leftover in my fridge!  :)

I followed the recipe as written, but family wasnâ€™t overly enthusiastic about it. I liked it but I think the problem may have been that I used leftover ham which had a cinnamon flavored glaze on it. Cinnamon was not a good addition to this chowder. May try it again with a plain ham steak in future.

Oh my goodness it was so good! Variations I made: I didn't have the celery,  I added a half a can of regular corn and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also used fresh thyme instead of ground (makes all the difference to me).  10/10 will make this again.

I was torn about giving it 4 stars because the flavor  was great!!  But ...  it wasn't thick enough to be a chowder, more of a creamy soup. Next time, I will add more corn and make it a lot thicker

Baseline recipe was good, but recommend some of the following changes. I used ham that I sliced myself but browned slightly. This is important because you want that texture/taste. I melted the flour mixture and milk as mentioned, but added cheese to it so it created an actual cheese sauce. Adding the cheese to soup mixture will distribute unevenly. Good recipe!

Yum! Substituted celery for red bell peppers.
