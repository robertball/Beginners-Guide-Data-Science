I used nonfat greek yogurt and Truvia sweetener. I served this with sliced apples and chunked bananas. It was a little sweet for me but that could be because it's an artificial sweetener. That said, my son and I thought this was very good. I think next time I might add a little vanilla extract but other than that, I think it's pretty spot on. It really reminds me of a lemon icebox cake!

When I made this I didn't like the sugar flavor, so the next time I made it I used 1 tsp; vanilla and raw honey, just enough to give it a light sweet taste. Love the lemon in it and I used the zest from the lemon. YUM! With the changes a 3 star. With the changes 5 stars.

This is a very good addition to the fruit of your choice. I also use plain greek yogurt add 1/8 cup sugar or sucralose then add a bit of Cinnamon and nutmeg. This is sooo good with cantaloupe and watermelon and strawberries.

This is great! It's sweet and tart. My kids and husband LOVED it! Thanks! 
Just play with the amount of sweetener to make it to your liking. Start off with less and taste it - it's easier to add more than take away!

Used 1/4 cup of splenda and it was a very nice balance of sweet and tart. Thanks for sharing.

I used vanilla low-fat Greek yogurt, juice and zest from one fresh lemon & 3 tablespoons ‘Nellie & Joe’s famous Key West Lemon Juice’ and 1/4 c ultra fine pure cane sugar (not powdered sugar). I prefer the taste of “real” sugar. Tastes great!

Very easy and very good for dipping chunks of fruit.
