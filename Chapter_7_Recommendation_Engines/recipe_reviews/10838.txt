I am a professional baker and have tried many, many bar recipes.  This recipe is simply delicious.  The basic brownie flavor brings comfort while the white chocolate and macadamia nuts add a unique twist so it's not just the same-old dessert.  I would recommend this recipe when entertaining.  As with all cookies, bars, and cakes, it's better to leave them slightly undercooked than to overcook them.  If you are concerned about overcooking, try taking them out a bit early and covering the pan with foil while they cool.

This is one of best cookies I have ever tasted!  Too bad macadamia nuts are such a fortune.

These were excellent.  They were gone before anything at the Easter concert at church.

Um.  Great idea.  And super cute name.  I almost gave it two starts...just for the name.  However, it was so sugary tasting (not 'sweet' tasting, it literally tasted like sugar with a hint of chocolate) that I couldn't eat it.  If you have left over white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts from making cookies and you want to use them up...use this idea but use your favorite brownie recipe or a good box, then follow the rest of the directions accordingly.

The brownies weren't as chocolatey as I like and the white chips on top gave it a weird taste, can't quite put my finger on it. I do love the taste of macadamia nuts in brownies.

These were really good, but took a lot longer than 20 min. to bake, probably closer to 45-50 min.

My mother-in-law greatly loved these brownies and they WERE excellent.  She's getting them for her birthday.  I did underbake them a tad and that seemed to make them extra-fudgy and extra-yummy.

Gooey and tasty.. took them to a church potluck and right as I put them down, two women grabbed one each before lunch.. because they looked too delicious. The only reason I didnt rate this as 5 is the baking time..  at 20-25 minutes the pan was still sloshing and my oven is calibrated fine.  I put it in for 5 more minutes and then ten more.  They were still very fudgey and gooey
