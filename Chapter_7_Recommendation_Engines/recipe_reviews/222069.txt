This is very easy to throw together! It is very basic, yet my favorite punch recipe...great for any party or scale the recipe down to just make enough for yourself as a treat.

I've been making this punch for years. It was always a special treat for the kids on Christmas Eve. Now that they are adults thay still expect it at Christmas! Try different flavor sherbets. We like rainbow and I don't scoop it but put in the pint as a whole block.

I made this punch for our daughter's high school graduation party. I was a little leery about it since there were only 3 ingredients but it was a BIG hit. Everyone loved it! I would make it again.
