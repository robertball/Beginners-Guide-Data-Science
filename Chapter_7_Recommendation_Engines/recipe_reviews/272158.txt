This recipe is trying to use sweetener and butter as a crust? Is that a typo; because that is not a crust.
Using this much alternative sweetener is a bad idea. My sweetener is a combination of stevia, monk fruit, and erythritol. Erythritol has a cooling property so when you use this much you end up with a lemon soup that makes a person's mouth feel cold. Not to mention the effect that will have on the digestion.

DO NOT TRY THIS RECIPE! It is way to sweet, and tastes way to much like almonds.

Tasty, especially if youâ€™re on a keto diet and familiar with the sweetness of this kind of sugar substitute, but difficult to cut without breaking a lot of the pieces.
