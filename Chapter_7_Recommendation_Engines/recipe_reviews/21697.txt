Good! Not too sweet, nice texture. Be sure you whip the egg YOLKS only to add to the pudding. I doubled the recipe and it worked out well. Odd to put a towel in the pan, but it seemed to work great. This is especially nice eaten cold with whip creme on top. Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I made it with splenda instead of sugar and it was still awesome!  A bit of work for pudding, but very tasty.  I also really liked the contrast between the thick pudding and the light meringue.  Definitely a keeper!

I am not sure if the recipe needs clarification or if I did something wrong...because when I added the milk to the chocolate it immediately seized...I thought it sounded wrong, but I did it anyway...

I made this as directed, replacing sugar with Splenda and heavy cream for the evaporated milk. I was needing something lower in carbs and with my swaps, it came in nice and low.

Once the chocolate was melted, I added the cream and had a very hard time incorporating the chocolate into it. Once the cream was hot, I put it in a bowl and used a hand blender for a few seconds at a time, until the chocolate and cream were thoroughly mixed. I'm not sure if heating the cream first and then adding the chocolate to it would help, but my improvisation worked.

I used two 10 oz ramekins and it was so rich, that next time, I'll do smaller portions. Plus, there was so much extra meringue, I piled it into another 10 oz ramekin and baked it along with the puddings. I did bake my meringue-topped puddings for at least another 10 minutes and it may have been a bit longer.

Overall, this was a great treat and I will make it again.

At first I was confused with the eggs that were supposed to be separated, because in the first half it does not say whether to use the yolks or whites. So when making your pudding, use 3 egg yolks and when doing the meringue use the 3 egg whites. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with the whole egg thing... But I was confused at first. But this recipe looks delicious! I cant wait to try it!:)Thank you for putting this recipe on this website! :)
