I used the premade pie crusts from the store, and it turned out great.  I also made a couple sauces to go with them.  A vanilla sauce, and a cinnamon sugar sauce.  Both yummy over the apples!  No leftovers.  I also made them for breakfast when I had some friends over.  I served them with scrambled egg crescent cups, and they were a huge hit!

Oh my gosh these are just like grandma used to make. The sauce is awesome!! I used about 1/2 cup less water because I boiled the sauce in the microwave and didn't want it to overflow. It will if you don't watch it carefully --so make sure if you do it in the microwave you use a big enough glass bowl. I added about 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar to the sauce instead of light brown and it gave it a rich flavor. What can I say but yum?!!

These are the true old-fashioned apple dumplings!  The sauce is awesome.  They aren't difficult, and were kind of fun to make.  I think you could even use store-bought pie dough if you aren't good at making your own.  I think these are a true comfort food.  Try them!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  I made this last sat nite and it turned out wonderful!  The only thing I could say to make it easier and taste better, is when making the crust, you can use those ready-made pie crusts from the store, and you can make 2 (half an apple per dumpling) dumplings per pie crust, OR can use a whole crust if you want to use a whole apple per dumpling.  I only used 1/2 of green apples (gave great tart flavor with the sweetness) per dumpling, with 1/8 stick of butter and added brown sugar/cinnamon, and nutmeg to personal taste.  I cooked this for 50 mins at the stated temperature, and it all cooked thoroughly well.  When you serve this, don't poor more juice over the dumpling, this makes it too rich.  You do want to poor the juice over the dumplings before cooking, but not after.  The crunchiness at the top and cinnamon softness at the bottom with vanilla ice cream gives a perfect tecture of a warm & cold treat for the mouth.  Great for having friends over!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I've made these a couple of times w/ a ready-made crust & homemade. A little involved to make but both looked impressive and were DELICIOUS. 

Sauce could be improved, instead, use the following caramel sauce from another recipe on this site: 
1 cup packed brown sugar 
1/2 cup butter 
2 tablespoons light corn syrup 

Heat brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter until melted. **Remove from heat** stir in corn syrup. (Add crushed pecans w/ sauce for a beautiful presentation!) 

Great Recipe!

First, I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings. I really wanted to take this one step further and make as close to my Nanny's recipe as possible. She always used canned biscuits. So I substituted Pillsbury Buttermilk Golden Layer biscuits for the pie crust. I used 2 1/2 rolled biscuits for each apple. Wrapping each apple and gently closing the tops. Then I cooked in a 350 degree oven for approximately 50 minutes. The real secret is to keep basting the apples with your sauce about every 10 minutes to keep the crust nicely glazed, which will bake to a beautiful golden crust. I served this with homemade vanilla ice cream.  My husband says it is the best ever! This is definitely a "MUST HAVE" recipe. Thanks!

These were excellent! I had a lot of trouble rolling out the dough out all at once. Next time, I will divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll each out individual circles. As I cooked it, I thought the sugar-water sauce seemed way too thin and there seemed to be way too much  so I only added about a third of it to the pan. In the end, the sauce cooked down and I wished I had added it all to the pan. Next time I will follow the directions exactly.Thanks!

This had an OK taste to it. I used the recipe for Buttery Flaky Pie Crust (which was great) for the shell. I tried it with granny smith apples but I liked rome apples better. So did everyone else. End result was everyone really liked the shell just not the apple part. So still looking for grandma's apple dumplings.

It took a bit more prep time than I had expected, but boy, these are decadently delicious, as if you ordered dessert from the 4 Seasons! Thank you for the recipe!  You can add 1/8-1/4 cup of your favorite alchoholic beverage to the cinnamon syrup which will add even more depth and nuance to the flavors. You can add chopped nuts to the syrup which will gently caramelize them as you heat them (via stove top or microwave). Diabetics? Splenda worked on one batch - just cut to 1/2 the amount of sugar called for, or else too sweet.  I cut the apples into halves since whole ones are too big and too much for one serving size after a meal - and it was still plenty. I sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture all over the  apple halves, put a a small pat of butter in the cored out center, then put the 'flat side' down onto the dough before wrapping and sealing it up. I gently pressed the dumplings into a smooth rounded shape (so looked way more pretty than the original pic :) I sprinkled more sugar/cinnamon over the outside. I used the tines of a fork to poke a few holes on the tops to prevent cracking. I even used the home made crust recipe found on this site which also had 5 stars - so can't go wrong! TOTALLY worth all the effort! Make it even more pretty? Cut out leaves from leftover dough, then gently lift them and lay down on top of the apple forms! Coolio, huh?

These were wonderful as promised, just as the recipe calls for.  I'm sure playing around with the caramel sauce would be a nice change to though.  HELPFUL HINT:  These can be made at least 1 day in advance if you need to.  First, swish your peeled apples in a bowl of water and 2 TBSP lemon juice to stop them from browning.  Then wrap as directed.  Place dumplings in the pan and cover tightly with plastic wrap so no air is touching the pastry.  Make the sauce as directed, and pour into a container and place in the fridge when cool.  When you are ready to bake, just pour the sauce over the dumplings and bake as directed!  MMMM Good.    I make these before we leave to go camping and have them the first night.  We cook them in the toaster oven.

VERY GOOD! I made this as a dessert to try out on everyone today as I'm looking for that special recipe to win an apple baking contest I will be competing in. I changed this recipe a little, first I diced the apples and added the sauce to the apples. I used a double pie crust which I rubbed with cinnamon and sugar on both sided. I then used a slotted spoon  to fill the crusts with the apple filling spooning a slight amount of sauce in the center. This made 12 dumplings which I put in foil muffin liners (to save my bake ware). I added cornstarch to the sauce and cooked on the stove to thicken into a syrup and added a little caramel after tasting.  After baking the apples for 20 minutes I topped them with some syrup and baked for another 20. I was afraid of having a soggy bottomed dumpling but it turned out great. Next time I will thicken the syrup and add it to the inside of the dumpling as well as the outside.

This was the very best recipe!  I will be making this again and again.  I made it with large Granny Smith apples but cut them in half.  That was large enough in itself for each serving.  I also used ready made pie crust.  They were delicious.  I was a little leary at first about all that water in the sauce but it cooks up wonderfully and turned out nice and sticky, not too watery.  It was perfect.

These dumplings are totally delicious!!!! I've made them three times in the past month, no one can get enough of them!!! I use premade pie crust for the dumpling crust, one apple per pie crust. However, these are so sweet and rich, it's difficult for a person with a sweet tooth to finish even half of one... so if you care about presentation, use one half of an apple and one half of a pie crust per serving. The sugar/water/vanilla mixture will seem very thin, but after cooking it turns into a delicious caramel sauce, so don't worry about it. Out of preference, I only make and use half of the sauce. If you make the entire amount, it nearly covers the dumplings and disintegrates the dough part, leaving you with cooked apples in a lot of delicious sauce, instead of apple dumplings. This recipe is not difficult at all and well worth the wait!

This recipe is amazing!  I made it using lura red (slightly tart) apples, and it is my husband's new favorite!  :-)  I made it pretty much as-is, except with store-bought crusts.  I also replaced some of the white sugar with brown sugar in the sauce.  As per the recommendation of another reviewer, I poured the sauce over the dumplings multiple times throughout the cooking, which I think really helped them soak up all the flavor of the sauce.  Overall, DELICIOUS!  A wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

I made these today, and they turned out great! The only thing I did differently was to substitute a cup of apple cider for one of the three cups water, just because I had it in the fridge and thought "why not?" It made the syrup a little darker, which was nice-looking. I divided the dough into 6 portions before rolling it out, to make it easier. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

I use the Crisco crust recipe, which always turns out good--Note that it is important to make sure that, when you pour the sauce on just before placing in oven, the sauce is boiling and the oven is already preheated to 400.  This prevents soggy crust.  Yummy yummy dumplings, and very impressive to serve to guests!

best recipe I have ever used for these! Taste just like moms! I was out of white sugar for the syrup so used brown sugar, came out perfectly!  Wrapped them in Basic Flaky Pie Crust By: stephanie  found on this site was perfect.  Will make them again and again! Don't be leary about adding the syrup. My first reaction was it was way to thin and was going to turn the pastry to mush. I was wrong, as it cooled it made this wonderful buttery caramel flavored topping for them!

I only used the sauce portion of this recipe (I already had frozen apple dumplings). It was absolutely wonderful! I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 c. and added 1/2 c. of brown sugar. I also added about 1 tbsp. of cinnamon.

I used 6 small apples. That is more practical as a single serving after a meal. I cooked them only for 50 minutes and only at 350. But I baked them in glass, which does cook hotter and faster than metal. I do not like mushy apples. The texture of the apples came out perfect. Soft but still with a little tooth to them. I used a little less butter and brown sugar to make up for the smaller apples. I also used the butter flaky pie crust recipe like another reviewer. I did not use half of the sauce because I thought the apples should not be more than half covered by the sauce while cooking or they would be mushy. I did not boil the vanilla in the sauce. Instead, I added the vanilla immediately after the sauce was done boiling and then immediately poured the liquid over the apples. I would do it this way again. I cooked two batches to experiment with covered versus uncovered. The covered batch I uncovered only when there was 20 minutes left at which time I basted them with the sauce. The other batch I cooked uncovered the entire time. The covered ones were more successful because I did not like how brown and crunchy the uncovered ones got on their tops. I put homemade whipped cream on top of them before serving. I would definitely make these again.

These were the best apple dumplings I've ever had! I used a prepared double crust from Trader Joes. Each crust made 4 dumplings. I followed the recipe exactly. My family and friends raved about them!

Better than my Moms...sshh..don't tell her. I used ready made pie crusts. Rolled each one out as much as I could and cut in half. Made 4 big apple dumplings. Used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for sauce...yumm. Sprinkled top of dumplings with cinnamon. Basted dumplings only once, near end of baking. It does look like a lot of sauce..but it's not really. Put leftovers in fridge. When ready to eat..just put in a bowl, spooned some sauce over top and popped in microwave for about 1-2 minutes. DELISH!!!

My family and my boyfriend's family thoroughly enjoyed this dessert for thanksgiving! I doubled the recipe. I used 6 northern spy apples and cut each one in half. I then cored and peeled them. I bought pie crust at the store (for 12 dumplings, I ended up using 3 boxes of Pillsbury double crust pie crusts). I took a pie crust and cut it in half. I put an apple half on each half of crust and put 1/16 cup of butter on each (cut butter into 8 pieces, then cut each in half). On top of the butter, I sprinkled two palmfuls of brown sugar, some cinnamon, some nutmeg, and some ginger. In four of them, I added craisins on top and aroung the apple before folding it up - I marked those with craisins on top. I placed 6 dumplings in each pan and kept them in the fridge overnight (I made them the day before thanksgiving). I made the sauce (doubled and following all of the directions - I used one stick of butter) the night before and refrigerated that, as well. The next day, the butter in the sauce had become solid again, but that didn't matter. I brought it to a boil again and after 5 minutes, divided it between the 2 pans, and put them in the oven for 50 minutes. They turned out perfectly, and I served them with vanilla ice cream. My family only ate 6, so I brought the rest to my boyfriend's family the next day. They were actually wonderful reheated, too. Great recipe!!! I got many compliments!

This recipe was just too yummy looking, I HAD to make them for Thanksgiving! 2 small changes not because I didn't like the recipe but because I have an affinity for Mace & whiskey in apple dishes :) I put a pinch of mace in each dumpling and replaced 1/2 cup of the water in the sauce with whiskey, just enough to give it a more full bodied flavor.  I also added a dash of each spice to the sauce as well :) Will def be making this again!

I made this recipe and everyone LOVED it. I did a few things different. 1 I used store bought dough. 2 I used macintosh apples because that is what I already had.3 I missed a step when making these and instead of putting the cin and nutmeg mixture on the apples before pinching the dough I did it after already sealing the apples in. It was still AMAZINg and I will definately make these again.

I also used the store-brought pie crust and I didn't have Granny Smiths so used Gala apples.  This is THE best apple dumpling recipe and a huge hit with my family.  No need to adjust anything in the recipe.  I did double the recipe and made 1 1/2 recipes of the sauce for my 10x15 pan, seemed like a lot, but turned out yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Very, very sweet.... they tasted great though... I made this on an extremely hot and humid day so it was hard to keep the crust together because it was mushy. I used 6 small apples and halved the recipe putting it in a 8 in. square pan.... But over all they tasted great... will definately make again..

These are wonderful! Exactly like my grandma's. To the person "Beginner Cook" who reviewed these before me - it sounds like you may have used the wrong type of apples. Granny Smith are best for baking. Did you use an "eating" apple?

This was pretty good, I am a beginner cook. And somehow messed this up, my apples tasted good, however; they had the texture of like chewed up mike n'  ikes. That gel candy. Kinda very gel like. Anyway, I cook at 400 degrees for exactly 1hr. at the middle shelf. Where may I have gone wrong? Can anyone give me a pointer??

OMG were these GOOD!!! Please don't use the "biscuit or cresent roll" ones!! I did -  two weeks ago - last week I made these----to die for! Beings I knew we would overeat I decided to freeze some - so I put them in bread pans and poured the cooled sauce into a sandwich bag to stuff inside the pan - cover the pan with wrap and foil and stuck'em in the freezer.  Can't waite to have them again tonight!! Oh yes - I baked them for 20 minutes then poured the sauce on and finished baking them.  THANKS!

I botched the crust on this one.  Next time I will make a double crust and make sure it is moist enough to roll out big enough.  Besides that it was great.  More sauce than needed.  I'd make more apple dumplings and leave the sauce amount the same.

This is great! I made my own crust (1 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup salted butter, 3 tbsp cold water, all in food processor) and made the recipe "almost" :) to a T, what I made different, is that the brown sugar/spices mixture that I was supposed to add to the apples... I add to little to each apple, so I end up with about 1/4 cup left, so for the sirup I put 1 3/4 cup of white sugar and the 1/4 cup of the brown sugar/spices, did not cut on the water, wich was perfect, and add 2 tablespoons of butter and like 1 1/2 cup of pecans, wich turn out in deliciously caramelized pecans.  The brown sugar and spices gives the sauce a rich deep flavor and a yummy smell! I did give a "bath" to the dumplings with the syrup after 20 minutes in the oven, and then after other 20 minutes more, gives a nice candied crust. Used Golden Delisious apples, wich I liked because they gave a slightly tang.  Read other reviews about this beeing a very filling dessert, wich is true, but for one of my guest did not applied, asked secons and a couple of dumplings to go! This is what I called a succes! Served with vanilla ice cream (a most) and a generous amont of sauce poured over. A last thing, plan to bake this so that you serve right out of the oven, hot and bubbling.

Loved it, made this twice already.  The first time, I changed nothing and it was very good.  The second time I omitted the white sugar syrup, served with a scoop of vanilla-bean ice cream and spooned warm Butterscotch Sauce II over it and dessert went from "very good" to "I think I just died and went to Heaven."

Strangely, my store bought double crust was enough for only 2 apples. Those two were delicious. I'm going to go get an apple corer for the next time. For, there will be a next time! I served them warm with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Yummy!! Had some extra champagne apples from new mexico, so used those instead of granny smith. Very tasty and not too difficult to make, just time-consuming.

A+++++ Fantstic recipe! Every once in a while you come across a recipe that ends up being passed down through the family for generations to come. This is one of those keeper recipes. I used "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" recipe from this site. I needed a serving for 8 instead of 6, so I used 8 small Granny Smith apples and it turned out perfect. I added one half teaspoon more cinnamon then recipe called for. Since I used homemade pie crust, I divided my dough into 8 same sized dough balls and rolled them out seperately and then followed the recipe as directed. For me it took about an hour to roll out my pre-made dough, core and peel apples, make sauce and assemble the dumplings. I think a 30 minute prep time is an underestimate. Also, I basted apple dumplings several times throughout the cooking time. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!!!

This recipe was delicious but I found that two pie crusts were not enough to cover the apples completely.  Three would have been better.  Also, baking long enough to brown the dough made the apples cook almost to an applesauce consistancy.  I would suggest baking at 425 dregrees.

Well, I'm only thirteen and thought I'd try something that not even my mom has ever made. I made homemade pie crust, and used fresh apples from our tree. They were pretty simple. I baked them in a round casserole dish and poured all the sauce in and the sauce almost completely coverd the dumplings. I was worried about that. Though, when they came out my mom said that, "Oh, Oh, that is the best thing I have EVER eaten! Never give me apple crisp again!"

talk about sugar overload!  This was a bit sweet for me, but good.  I would make half the water/sugar suace next time.  I only poured about a cup of it over the dumplings.  I ended up using 4 apples, each cut in half for the dumplings.  I also used a box of pilsbury pie crusts....each crust cut into quarters.

Well, my postpartum weight loss has come to a screeching halt because of this recipe! It's very, very good!

I use gala apples instead of granny smith (just because galas are my favorite). And like another reviewer, I slice the apples up. For us, it's just easier to eat this way. The only other change I made was to cut the sauce in half: 1.5 cups water, 1 cup sugar, 1t vanilla extract.

I serve these warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I also spoon the sauce over the dumpling and ice cream. Wonderful, wonderful dessert. The prep is a little involved, especially if you make your own pie crust (I use Perfect Pie Crust II by Kira Hultsman, cut in half), but it's well worth it. Trust me...you won't be disappointed!

I thought this recipe had a lot of potential... I loved the basic idea of the dessert, but it was way to sweet for my husband and me.  Also, we didn't taste much spice.  I would make this again because it was so unique (and the apples came out so tender!), but next time, I'm going to add a lot more cinnamon and nutmeg and cut back on the sugar.

I also added about 1/3 cup raisins (pre-soaked in warm brandy) to the brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mixture inside the cored apples.  I liked the tartness of the Granny Smith because the syrup was sweet and the apples helped it not be too much so.  This was delicious and I will make it again for special occasions (in the fall/winter, most likely).   I did cut the recipe down to only two apples/servings and it was still wonderful.  Highly recommend!

Great! The first time I ever had apple dumplings was at an apple cheese festival. I wouldn't have even tried them if I wasn't persuaded by my family who raved about them. They were delicious and of course went home and began searching for a similar recipe. I did not have to search far! I was very impressed because I thought I would have to play around to duplicate the great taste I discovered at the festival, but this recipe is perfect!

Perfect! I made these for my husband's birthday and the whole family loved them! I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the sauce before boiling and it turned out great!

Well, these were loved by everyone at Thanksgiving & have replaced apple pie on our table forever!  They are time consuming to prepare, but I did mine the day before and baked 15 - 20 minutes longer while we sat down to dinner & they came out perfectly.  I used small(ish) Granny Smiths and because my butter was so small, I just added the spices to the softened butter and stuffed the hollowed cores with the softened spiced butter.  Again, a really delicious recipe that was made ahead and loved by everyone in the family.

I made a lot of mistakes with this recipe (never made them before) but they still turned out fabulous!  I made my own pie crust but I think next time, I'll separate it into individual portions before I roll it out.  I will also make smaller portions (1/2 an apple)overall.  The whole apple portion was HUGE!  I forgot to put the cinnamon with the apple and just added it to the sauce instead but it came out great anyway.  Also, I reserved about 1/4 of the sauce and added half and half to it to make a caramel sauce which was heavenly!  I highly recommend this recipe.  I don't think it's easy but I'll try it again.  My husband wouldn't shut up about it!  I guess it definitely has his endorsement too!

I made these dumplings. They are wonderful. I will also cook them on 425 next time. The apples get a little too soft. I used granny smith, and they were tart enough to balance out the sweet sauce. Excellent

Wow! I was a bit afraid of the amount of water for the syrup you pour over the dumplings. When I took mine out of the oven I quickly placed it in the refrigerater, 20 minutes later I went to get a dumpling. The syrup wasn't runny at all. This is the best Apple Dumpling recipe I have tried. I like sweeter apples more than I do tart apples, so I used Ida Red apples in mine, it was done in 55 min.

I think this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Seriously, and I make a lot of good desserts. I used small gala apples & store bought, pillsbury pie dough. I just cut each pie crust into 6 strips, wrapping 2 strips up & around opposite of each other on each apple. It worked out great. I think I'm going to make this a lot now. My family couldn't believe how good these were. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

The BEST!!!! Absolutely delicious.  I used the Best ever pastry recipe from this site and the crust was so light and flakey.  This was served to friends at dinner and was a real hit with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream.  I can't wait to make it again although I will now invest in an apple corer!

As an apple pie afficionado, I wasn't sure if I would be as enthusiastic as the other reviewers for this recipe.  I was wrong!  This recipe was clear and wonderful.  I would suggest using at least 1.5 times the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe (which tastes just like my grandma's), rolling out 2 squares at a time, and being extra sure to pinch the edges of the pastry closed.  Everyone at the potluck I brought these to is still raving weeks later.

I made these and we loved them! I cut the water mixture in half and it was plenty. I only made 6 and I used the premade pie dough! My husband said they were so good and didn't even need ice cream if you can imagine that! Well worth a try.  Thanks Micki for a great recipe

These are better than apple pie!  I made these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved them and SO DID I!  I absolutely love the way they were individual and the sauce was excellent!  Although, mine cooked in approx. 45 minutes.

These came out great.  I cheated though and used a dairy case ready-made piecrust.  I added a tablespoon of raisins, and about a teaspoon and a half of chopped pecans into the center of each apple.  My husband really loved these apple dumplings, especially when served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

If I could give this 0 stars I would. This recipe was great up until the sauce. 3 cups of water is a rediculous amount of water and I knew better. I thought to myself just to do what the recipe says, with this being my first time making them. I followed everything exactly and when I pulled them out of the oven, the sauce was boiling over and my dumplings were nothing but mushy pie crust and sauce. Absolutely awful, everything went into the trash.

Omg this recipe is amazing! I was a little nervous to try it but it was super easy and actually very fun to do! I did struggle with the crust part though. I've never really baked so I wasn't sure what the "pastry for a double crust pie" meant so I ended up buying some Pillsbury 2 pack crust. I tried using just one but that didn't work out so I ended up taking the second one out and using a cup to cut circles to go over the tops of the apples that didn't get covered with the first one. I was nervous about the sauce too because mine was super thin but trust me follow this recipe exactly because that sauce after it comes out the oven is divine (well even before it went it I was tasting it off the spoon...a couple times haha). I will definitely be keeping this recipe thank you so much for sharing!

I didn't have time to make the dough from scratch, so I took an idea from another chef on here and used Pillsbury's crescent rolls (someone else used biscuits but same thing). They were excellent! Yes, very sweet - something like a Cinnabon - and I had to put foil on the top and bake longer than an hour (at 350). Can't wait to make these again, with dough from scratch! Excellent sauce and as everyone says - don't mind how watery it is; that will change as it cooks.

These were fabulous! I made them for a family dinner and they were a big hit with everyone. I did mix the spices (adding a dash of ginger) into the brown sugar and then use ~1Tbsp. sugar mixture per apple. I also only used 1/2 Tbsp. butter per apple. I also added a few dashes of the same spices to the sauce/syrup to tie all the favors together. I used my own crust recipe. For those stating their apples became mush, it has to do with the type of apple you used most likely. Granny Smith are good baking apples and mine were perfect at one hour baking time. I followed the majority of reviewers suggestion to make & use all of the sauce or syrup on the apples while baking. I will not do that next time. I will make half and use enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Then I will use the remainder to 'baste' the apples every few minutes. The syrup was excellent, but, even though we spooned it over them again when serving, there was a lot left and wasted. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I too used premade pie crust. Rolled out dough and cut into 4 pieces.  I used frozen apple sliced I put up this fall, and added a fresh pear to it (was needing to use it up). Let the apples thaw and drained off juice, added the rest of ingredients and filled.   As for the sauce, made as direct, only used about 1/2 to 3/4 of it.  will cut in 1/2 next time...but it sure was good.   The pan was licked clean before our heads hit the pillow.  Will make again, and again.  Oh, don't forget a scoop of vanilla icecream on top!  Would have added a photo, but forget until the pan was empty!

I like my sauce more like syrup. :) I only used about 2 cups water but used the same amount of sugar and added cinnamon. In each apple I used only 1/4 of the amount that it called for. Sooo delicious!

This recipe is a definite winner!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he can't stop talking about how good they were.  I didn't use quite as much butter in each apple as suggested (about half), but everything else was exactly as suggested.  Just perfect with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and some of the sauce on top.

It is Awesome recipe!!!! Super delicious!!!! 
I didn't use white sugar instead: splenda and it works perfectly, also as a pastry I used the croissants dough and a rectangle for each apple. Garnish with pecans! Mmmmmm!!!

these are great.  i ended up mixing the brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg and sugar all together before reading the directions.  but it came out more caramelized and great.  i added chopped pecans to the mixture too.  yum.  i didnt use all of the sauce and only made 4.  i basted them twice with the sauce throughout baking and only left about 1/2 inch of the sauce in the bottom.  i baked them about 10 min. more to get the sauce a little thicker and the tops crunchier.   yum, as they sat to cool, they flattened.  fantastic.  i originally wanted turnovers but made these instead. definitely a bakery delicacy.

WONDERFUL!!! Made them with my daughter for my dad... he said, "They're the only apple dumplings I've ever had that were better than your mom's.  But don't tell her!"  That says it all!!!  A MUST make again and again!

Absolutely divine. I made these for my husband and kids, they devoured it and my 4 year old asked for 2nds (and was denied of course!) I felt the recipe was fairly easy. I followed it to a T. Thanks so much for posting, this will be a regular around here!

Since the market didn't have large Granny Smith apples I bought 8 smaller ones.  I also bought pre-made roll out pie crust, and cut them into 4 pieces.  Roll them out into triangles and it was easy to wrap the apples in them.  It was my first time making apple dumplings and didn't really know what to expect,  I can tell you this...This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this dough!It's much nicer than just plain pastry dough. The vanilla butter sauce is so much tastier than the ones made with the red cinnamon heart candies. I added less sugar to this to make it a bit more friendly to my family members who are diabetic.

Very easy & delicious!  I used 3 store bought crusts & reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup.  I think next time I will reduce the sugar 1/2 c-to 3/4 c, because the sauce was just a little too sweet.  I used 1/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar.  I cut the apples in half which was a much better serving size.  Served warm with with vanilla ice cream.  They were a hit with my dinner guests.

YUM!  I made these today and they were a huge hit.  I cut the water/sugar in half as suggested in reviews and it was the perfect amount.  I also added some of the extra brown suger/spice mixture to the 'sauce' (as also suggested) and would do that again.  I sliced my apples and had a hard time wrapping all the  apple slices in the pie crust square.  Next time, I will wrap the whole apple per recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I use this recipe with Pillsbury pie crusts (ready made), but I did cut down on the brown sugar & butter (by about half)--and it still turns out wonderful each time.  Great recipe.  One of the best I've found so far!

wow!these are really good:-) I've made apple dumplings before and for some reason never thought to use nutmeg--the nutmeg makes a difference.These tasted like my recipe with the addition of nutmeg.absolutely delicious!Very easy to make,but a little time consuming.Very worth the time and effort though!:-)

These were the absolute best apple dumplings! Took a bit of time to prepare, but very easy and soooooo worth it. I used french pastry pie crust recipe on this site and this turned out amazing! My apples were med/lg sized and could have cooked a little longer, next time I'll use smaller apples. I used Fuji apples because they were on sale and they came out just fine. Great served warm with vanilla ice cream. Very rich, very filling, almost a meal in itself if served with coffee and ice cream. Neither hubby nor I could finish ours. Only our teenager could devour the entire dessert. I am definitely going to fix these over the holidays when all the family is here!

These were excellent, I print out recipes and put them in a plastic insert, When I try them they go in a book called KEEPERS. All of our kids where over this weekend and they just loved them. My son-in-law told our daughter to check out my notebook. This one got a big A++++++

These were very good.  I used pre-made pie crust & rome apples (because other viewers said the granny smith were too tart).  It turned out nicely and cut down on the prep time.  Next time I might try to roll the dough a little thinner to make more apples.

This recipe was easy to make, although really time consuming.  It was my first time making apple dumplings but it took about 45 minutes before I even got it in the oven.  However, the result was amazing.  Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like desserts, ate the whole thing and talked about it in in the car on the way home from a dinner party.  Everyone gave it rave reviews, and I was even told that was the very best apple dessert one guest had ever had- and they're his favorite type of treats!

I have never made Apple Dumplings before, but had some great looking apples and thought I would give it a try. I just got them out of the oven and tested my first one... These are so wonderful! and beautiful.  I cut the water by a half cup and added more butter than called for.  I also used premade pie crust, so it was so easy. I also basted the dumplings a few times with the syrup while they were cooking, gave the dumplings a nice glaze.
These are gourmet!

I made the dumplings following the recipe exactly as written. I made the pie crust by hand and used Granny Smith apples. I boiled the sugar water for exactly 5 minutes then poured the mixture  over the dumplings and placed the dish in a pre-heated oven. The outcome was the dumplings “boiled” in the syrupy liquid, the tops browning nicely and the bottoms having a texture of noodles. The syrupy fluid was still very deep in the dish after it was finished. After sitting for 30 minutes, the fluid thickened and reabsorbed  into the dumplings. These were super sweet. I will not make these again- I disliked the texture and watery, overly sweet syrup.

I was hoping for something close to what my mother always made, but (forgive me) this recipe blows anything she ever made out of the water! I ran short on butter and it was still perfect. One of those apple peeler/corer gizmos is key.

Sorry, but this recipe has several flaws, baking time, amount of sauce, failure to recommend  apple size to coincide with dough requirement just to name  a few. As some other reviewers I ended up with applesauce bursting out of  half over fine half underdone dough saturated with a sickening sweet sauce. Should have known something was wrong when I first read the recipe.

what am I doing wrong? I make this recipe and they're so much sauce in the dish that the bottom half doesn't back thoroughly. So I made the recipe again using 2 baking dishes instead of one so the sauce didn't come up so high on the dumpling and still the bottom half of the dough did not thoroughly cook

I have to say this was a great recipie. These apple dumplings turned out fabulous!! I used a basic butter pie crust and I added a spoon of cinnamon to the sauce when I heated it up in the sauce pan. I topped them with homemade whipped cream at serving time and they were just so delicious!!

I had never even heard of an apple dumpling but ohhh my goodness i'm glad I have now!  When I first came across this recipe I was kinda nervous dumping all the liquid in with the wrapped apples but it made the best sauce!  This is really worth making...again and again and again :)

Very good. worth making again for sure! The only things I changed were substituting 1/2 c of brown sugar and then 1 1/2 c. of white sugar for the syrup. I also put in an 8x11 pan and it filled it nicely. Basted the apple dumplings with the sauce about once every 10-15 minutes, which helped create a nice, crusty, golden crust- mmmm mmmm!! :) I also topped with a few chopped walnuts. will make again!

This is one of the best dessert recipes I have ever made. Very easy, very delicious--and unbelievable when served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Like others, I made each dumpling with half an apple, instead of a whole--the whole is too big for one serving. I also saved the left-over incredible syrup to use for ice-cream topping. A real treat!

This recipe is amazing.  This was the first time I ever tried to make apple dumplings and this recipe was so easy.  It was so tasty.  I use the butter flaky pie crust recipe for the dough.  I will  be making these over and over again. Can't wait to eat them again.

Wow this was really good.My whole family loved this.Other than using a bigger roasting pan to bake the apples in I made this as directed. The bigger pan allowed more of the apples to stick out than other people were saying. We really liked it this way. I don't think I would baste the apples while cooking. I meant to baste them as some people suggested but forgot to. The homemade pie crust was very flaky and was sweetened just right with the sugar in the apple center. This was my first time making or eating apple dumplings. I sure have been missing out on a lot. My kids loved helping me make this. They peeled the apples for me while I made the pie crust. It wasn't very pretty but will,I think,improve in looks with practice.

Very good. Next time I will cut back on the sauce. It took too long to thicken. I used the french pastry pie crust from this site and it totally fell apart while I was wraping the apples, but it was really yummy. Also I recommend basting during baking and then while it rests.

WOW, I made these just to use up some frozen pie crust that I wanted to get rid of, and some granny smiths that aren't getting eaten fast enough.  I am not a fan of apple desserts but I thought I give these a try; maybe someone in my family would eat them.  Looking at the picture, the sauce made me a bit queasy.  Looks pretty syrupy sweet, but the reviews intrigued me.  I had to give it a go.  I made them tonight and tried 1/2 of one just to see.....OH MY !! These are EXCELLENT!  The flavor of the syrup isn't sickeningly sweet like I was afraid of, it's got a nice vanilla taste, not too heavy. My husband was raving about the one he ate too!    They are really rather easy to make...except for peeling and coring the apples...torture for me; but otherwise, basic and easy and SOOO worth it.  My dad loves apple dumplings and I can't wait to make some for him soon.  For those of you who may have to wrestle with the pie crust (kept breaking, etc.)  I finally just wet my hands and squeezed around the apple and plastered that crust on the best I could.  They didn't look beautiful, but they were pretty well encased.  This was well worth the experiment after all.

DELICIOUS! I used store bought pie crusts and it came out great with Jonagold apples.  If your apples are really sweet, you may want to cut the sugar a little.

I had never made apple dumplings, and am deathly afraid to make any kind of pie.  So, I was timid going into making these.  But, they turned out FABULOUS!!!!  Quite a bit of work involved in preparation, but well worth it!  SO yummy!!!

These were amazing.  My cooking crew mistook "cored apples" as making holes all the way through the apples, but it still came out amazing.  I used all brown sugar (it was all we had), and mixed it with the cinnamon before sprinkling on the rolled-out pastry dough first.  Just to make things easier for me.  Definitely would do again.  :)

I too cut way back on the sugar and used only half the water because I thought the pie crust would get soggy.  The sauce thicken on it's own and next time I would use the 3 cups of water but cut way back on the sugar.  They were GREAT!  Will make these often for an impressive dessert.  I want to try a scoop of ice cream on them too.

This recipe was fantastic!  I make my own pie crusts and I used cut up apples instead of whole ones.  I also sprinkled white sugar on top right before baking.  It turned out delicious and I will definetly make it again and again! BRAVO!

I made these with my 4 yeare old and 2 year old.  So easy!  I used sotre bought dough and just eyeballed the measurements.  They each smashed some butter in the middle of the apple and then packed the center with brown sugar.  A few shakes of allspice and we closed them up.  I was thinking about skipping the sauce but I am glad I didn't. It truly makes the dish complete.  Everybody loved them!  We made just 2 a few hours ago for afternoon snack and now we are going back to make more for a special after dinner treat.

I got rave reviews on this recipe for a dinner Party I hosted.  I add pecan pieces to the caramel sauce and served with ice cream.  My only complaint is that the apples were almost too tender.  Next time I might not bake them as long...

These really do come out wonderful. I always wanted to try to make this and found it fun to make. I do think the sauce is extra extra sweet. I would definitely make this again and suggest serving with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe- Great Flavor. Worth it for the time! 
SUGGESTIONS: 
-1/2 the amount of water for the sauce...

-Be careful not to spill the sauce on the pan or the bottom of the apples- will burn.

Took a long time even though I used store bought pie crust.  Tasted great.  Definitely do not need all the sauce.

This recipe is my absolute favorite! The recipe says 6 servings but if you add ice cream, it can feed up to 12.  Definitely recommended.

My husband ate 3 in one day. When you make these, you'll understand how amazing that is. These dumplings are very filling and depending on how big your apples are - they can be huge! I couldn't even finish one (and I can eat!).  I won't use granny smith again, used some rome and those were better, not as sour.

These were excellent. I used ready pie crusts and my family wolfed them down. I am not an apple pie person, but loved this! Would use for company with caramel drizzled over the plate for looks.

Very, very good. I was a little short on pie dough (I made my own) but the recipe was very good. The apples were nice and tender and the crust was not doughy but crispy and browned well. I topped it with some hot buttered rum batter from this sight. Excellent.

I followed the instructions to a T and I used the ready made pie crusts. I made 6 apples and only 2 of the 6 didn't crumble all apart. Would anyone know why they would crumble? They tasted delicious but presentation didn't go over well. Thank you!

Wellllll, the apples were so large, that the pie crust was not reaching up around the tops, leaving a gaping apple.  So I would not use ready made pie crusts again, like I had to today. I’m very new at things with CRUST but love to eat them! I love that there are very few ingredients, and they taste delicious together. No company coming, so I guess I’ll just try again,,,

To start I'd like to say if you don't happen to have an apple corer and like me think it must not be that hard to just cut a circular hole out of the center with a pairing knife ... think again, IT IS ! Some of my apples split in half and it's difficult getting all the core : /  Having one handy gadget makes all the difference. I'll be getting one for my kitchen . The recipe itself isn't difficult .The reason for the two star rating is because even my kids who love sweets thought it was wayyyyyyy tooooo Sweet.  None of us could finish our dumpling.  With the natural  sweet flavor from the apples I'm thinking half the amount of sugar would suffice.

Wonderful. Great taste. But instead of folding dough up over the apples from below. I cut a roll out pie crust in fourths and draped each over each apple (I just made 4 apples).

This is very similar to the recipe my Mom would make me for  my birthday.  Delicious, but we would slice the apples, like pie, and roll up in the dough.  Here in Ohio, we liked to use the Jonathon apples--a sweet, tart apple that is great for baking.  Granny Smiths aren't reliable.

Delicious. I used the Perfect Pie recipe from Simply as the pastry.  I used Golden Delicious and Red Delicious. I goofed up the sauce, but it didn't need it. Cooked turkey at the same time and had the oven at 350 for 30 minutes then 15 minutes at 400. The sauce part was on top as a sorta sugar crust and it worked. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Probably going to be making it for family a lot more due to how scrumptious it is.

Yes, I made my crust using Alton Brown’s recipe—one on Food Network’s from 2004 approximately. Wow, yes it’s very time consuming but well worth the time/work. Firstly, I peeled & cored my apples (used Gala), then I sliced them & stacked. When I made the sauce, I added Caramel Extract—yummy! You’d think you’re eating a Carmel Apple! Overall this should be 5 stars!!!

I agree with the negative reviews.  Soooooo much water and sugar.  I used to make apple dumplings years ago but couldn’t find my recipe.

Easy, delicious, and an instant favorite. I used Pillsbury Pie Crusts rather than homemade for less mess and less time.

Really good, but need to cut the sweetness. Maybe less inside the apples? Especially if you don't use GS apples (which I don't like) I like the idea of using brown sugar and cider for the sauce. I made a vanilla custard recipe from this site and put some of that on too, because that's how we served it at a restaurant I used to work at. (The  'n' Bull, Peddler's Village, Lahaska, PA)

I’m lactose intolerant and this is the first dessert I’ve made in six months that I’ve really LOVED!!!!! I just used 2 Great Value brand deep dish pie shells, thawed them, and used that dough. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly (vegan butter though), and everyone in my house loved it!

AWSOME!!!! I have been looking for a recipe with a good topping and I found it. I did make my crust that I use for pies and it was perfect. I used Jonathan apples instead of granny’s and the taste was super good. This will be the only recipe I will ever make and I will be making it again and again.

Its too sweet, use less white sugar and a cup less water.  Dont have any open areas of pie crust dough!  I think it would be better with half the butter in the apple, only 1 tbls of brown sugar and sprinkle some cinnamon over the peeled apple before closing.  Next time I will make pie crust out of 1.5 cups cold flour, salt and 1/2 cup of lard 2 times to make sure I have enough dough.

DON’T DO THE SAUCE!!! Even after cutting the “sauce” (simple sugar) recipe in half (no way it would all fit in the pan), these are just mush. I useful my favorite tried and true crust recipe and the dumplings are delicious on top, where the crust is flaky and amazing and the apples are tender, but everything below the “sauce line” is just an unbaked sugar and crust goo. I’ve put them back in the oven after removing one dumpling and trying to scoop out some of the sickly sweet sauce, and I hope they’ll crisp enough to be edible.

I used this recipe simply for the “sauce”. I used canned crescent rolls and canned apple pie filling. This was a super quick and easy desert. I baked mine for 40 min on 400 degrees, and they’re now a staple desert at my house!! Oh and they’re great if you have to stick them in the fridge and reheat in the oven.

THis did not work at all. There was no way a double pastry recipe could fit around 4 apples without tearing to bits, much less 6 like in the recipe. I ended up baking the apples with cinnamon, brown sugar, and raisins in a pan without the pastry.

Amazing recipe! I used the buttery flaky crust recipe. I sprinkled brown sugar in the outer crust before baking. Then basted with the sauce at 30 and 50 minutes. The last 5 minutes I turned on low broil and basted with the sauce to brown a bit. My kids did a magic trick of making them disappear lol. I did also boil the sauce in the microwave as another reviewer mentioned.

Easy enough recipe. I made the crust from scratch. I would change one thing that would make it a lot better--use less sugar.  It was way too sweet.

I had huge Granny Smith apples, so I used my apple slicer and put about 3/4 apple on each pie crust.  Otherwise followed recipe as written.  Was delicious but I thought the pie crust was a little gummy on the bottom and a little overcooked on the top. An idea: use some of the apple slices on the bottom to elevate the crust-covered apples.  Foil sheet just laid over tops for 7-10 minutes may prevent dryness. Will also back off on sugar; was very sweet.  Will try again.

Next time I'll try the caramel  sauce  another reviewer suggested.  Cut the recipe down drastically  to 3 apples. But this recipe is a keeper!

This was a very delicious dish but a bit finicky to prepare.  I used big apples and some small ones. Think I would go with small-medium sized apples as you can eat a lot less pastry.   I added pecans to the recipe but didn't make the sauce. It just sounded like too much sugar to me.  I guess the dumplings leaked a bit while baking so that made some sauce with not as much sugar content.   They were very tasty though and would make them again.

We loved them! I wouldn't change a thing. I made these Christmas Eve, we actually had them with vanilla ice cream for dinner. I think I started a new, delicious tradition!

I do not cook but was able to make this, and if I do say so myself (which I do), it was phenomenal!  I followed comments on crust recipe that said use very cold water and add slowly and crust turned out great.  I followed other parts of recipe pretty much exactly and, wow, it was good.  The only thing I might change is to add less sugar to the sauce;  it is definitely on the sweet side.  That said - I will absolutely cook these again!

I was curious about some of the reviews stating this was "too sweet" but I took a chance because most old fashioned desserts were sweeter than those of today. Yes, they're sweet - yes, they're old fashioned -- yes, they are awesome! I rolled out only part of the dough at a time to make it easier to work with. I also used Granny Smith apples, as they are nice and tart, and worked to balance the sweetness. These are very reminiscent of heirloom apple dumplings.

I used store bought pie dough, and stuffed pinches of allspice, nutmeg, and clove into the apple cavities along with the butter and brown sugar.  The sauce is very sweet: I think next time I make it I will use 1/3 cup less sugar.  Overall, a tasty dumpling, perfect á la mode.

This was good, but I ended up substituting my Mother's sauce because it only had a Tbsp butter and less sugar.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These have been made for generations in my family.  I do have these suggestions based on person preference..
(1) I slice the apples and put them in a plastic bag with the spices (and I add some apple  pie spice)  and shake, thus  coating each apple piece.  
(2) I then place several slices onto each pastry  square rather than an entire apple.
(3) I put the seamed side down in the pan and pour the sugar water over.
(4) About midway during baking I also  spoon the sauce over the tops.  
The first time I made these for my grandmother she stopped and looked at me and said appreciatively "these taste just like mama's!"

This is my all time favorite recipe!  Simply delicious.  I used premade pie crusts and an apple peeler-corer-slicer machine.  Makes it super fast!  I also like to put mine in individual ramekins.  Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I'm surrounded by apple orchards, so when Honey Crisps come in, I do fried apples, then apples for lunch, then this. So far I see no point in making dumplings any other way, and the only change I make to the recipe is bumping up the spices a bit. (I do use premade pie crusts.)

These were just like my grandma use to make .  The only thing I did differently is I sliced the apples and then put them the microwave for a few minutes to help them start cooking,  But other than that I didnt do any thing different.

It is VERY sweet. I only used 1 TBS. Brown sugar in the apples,  but next time I won't use any. I loved the sugary crispy crust. I won't be spooning any extra sauce to serve though - it's just too much.

Peach cobbler has been my husbands favorite dessert for the last 7 years! UNTIL I made these apple dumplings!  Move over Cobbler, you've been replaced by a Dumpling!!  And it is easily adapted to become Peach Dumplings, or Strawberry-Rhubarb, or PICK A FRUIT!

I made this recipe for friends at a dinner party last night.  Everyone loved them.  I made a minor change that turned out perfect.  I boiled the water with the apple peals for 5 minutes then removed the peals with a slotted spoon.  I used the flavored water instead of just plain water.  I was absolutely delicious!  I also used homemade pie crust made from an AllRecipies recipe.  All together it was fantastic.

Oh,  my. These were amazing. I used only half an apple in each dumpling,  and they were still huge and so rich that I could barely finish a whole one.  I might try to stretch the dough to 8 in the pan next time. This is going straight into my standby favorites file. Thanks so much!

These are great!  I have never made dumplings before but I've made apple pie many times.  These are easier than apple pie, less messy, and everyone has their own. Even my friend who doesn't like sweets said these were perfect and my son, who is a hard critic, ate two! I used a premade pie crust and they still turned out tasty.  I didn't serve it with any ice cream or whipped cream.

I used store bought pie crusts and made these just as the original recipe says. These were delicious.  I read the reviews after I made them and next time will try the biscuit dough instead and baste with the sauce to make them look even better.

My family loved this recipe. I do have one suggestion: please change the "preparation" time to be more accurate. Unless you're Martha Stewart, it takes way longer than 30 minutes to mix and roll pastry, core and peel six apples, wrap the apples and make the sauce. This is more like an hour prep, at least, and that's if you bake a lot and have a good space to do it in.

I made this recipe for my grandfather's 80 (something) birthday. I used store bought crust and used organic Fuji apples. I was in a hurry making them and only put 1 tablespoon of dark brown sugar and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in the core of each apple before sealing them with the crust. The amount of sugar in the sauce made me a little nervous, but with new recipes I mostly follow the recipe the first time around.  The sauce tasted good but I think next time, I will boil it down a little more. Besides that, the naturally sweet apple paired with the brown sugar and butter was delicious against the crunchy/flaky crust.  I am glad the sauce wasn't too sweet. It was a light caramel sauce.

Absolutely delicious!! I made these two weeks ago and I just made them again at my husband's request for his birthday. I made my own crust and added brown sugar and cinnamon to the sauce. Thank you!!

First time I made these I followed the recipe. They were fantastic, albeit a bit too sweet.  Subsequent times I reduced the total amount of sugar and adjusted the ratio of white to brown sugar to create a more caramel-like sauce.  It was trial and error, but we settled on 3/4c light brown sugar & 1/4 c dark brown to 1/2 cup white. We mix some cinnamon and nutmeg with the dark brown and stuff that into the apples. These are a new favorite dessert in my house, and so quick when using pre-made pie crust!  Like any recipe that calls for sugar or spice, measurements can be adjusted to suit individual tastes.  Also, like any recipe that calls for fresh fruit, baking times and temps may need to be adjusted based on fruit size, ripeness, oven, and location. Made these at least a dozen times and never had the same cook time.

I used the brown sugar sauce mentioned in previous comment and added cinnamon oil and vanilla. I basted every 15 minutes. My hubby said he likes it better than Apple pie!  The caramel sauce was killer!

I actually cut the apples in half and made 12 of them. Not traditional maybe but a more reasonable and convenient portion size. I cooked it for the same amount of time because I wanted softer apples but if you're into a bit more bite cut down on the cooking time by a few minutes. Seriously though these were amazing.

I used frozen store-bought pastry and scaled it down to three apples.  I don't have a coring tool so I used my slicer that also removes the core. It meant the slices cooked a bit faster too. I also tried these stuffings: fresh thyme with shredded mozzarella, pistachio and honey - should have added cinnamon and vanilla to the pistachio mix. For the sauce I heated butter and honey together - that's it! Poured it over the dumplings and then poured a half can of lemonade - made for a great sugar syrup!

This was AMAZING!!! I used basic flakey pie crust off this website for dough. It make enough for 4 apples. I had to run to the store after one bite to get some vanilla ice cream. It paired so well together. I loved the gooeyness the sugar water makes. Great great dessert.

I use to make these when I was younger, just getting into my cooking experimental stage, for dessert!  I'd start them just before dinner, then take them out and serve them warm and delicious!  My dad loved them!  And so did everyone else! Thanks for bringing back warm memmories!!

I was searching for a recipe just like what my mother made from time to time that I loved. This recipe looked to be the same as hers and I tried it myself by using this recipe.  Spot on! I've had different variations of apple dumplings, but there's nothing like old fashioned.  Super easy and delicious. If I had to add anything next time was maybe a little brown sugar to the sauce.

this is what my Mother used to cook for us children when I was a small boy but always remember this treat during the fall months, I regretted being able to get this recipe from my mother before she passed. I have fixed this for my grandchildren and their reaction was the same as mine when I was young, we make it often now and has become a favorite fall treat and all the daughter in laws have copied the recipe for them self's. I have not changed anything to this recipe it is perfect the way it is.

Takes a little time but results are well worth it. Don't skimp on the sauce. It does seem like its too much but after basting during the cooking process and pouring over the scoop of vanilla ice cream that compliments the dumpling...delish! Everyone raved over it.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Wanted to try and make "dumplings like Mom used to make" and this was it!  Have made several times now. Sometimes you have to cut the sweetness with a little vanilla ice cream:)

This was not good at all. It was way too sweet, my daughter wouldn't even eat it.  I only baked it for 45 minutes, and it looked like all my apples exploded. When we tried to eat this, the apples were mush -think chunky applesauce. and the only edible crust was the very top, and it wasn't that great. Everything else that the "sauce" touched was an unbaked gooey mess.

Prepared this recipe exactly as written.  Like other reviewers, I was skeptical of the very watery sauce but made according to recipe directions.  These dumplings are to die for!  Everyone loved them.  They turned out beautifully with a delicious caramel sauce.

My sauce was more like taffy, very thick and chewy.  We also decided we like to have the apples sliced and coated with sugar and spice, so that each piece is sweet.

Great recipe, I made it with a home made crust and it was great. Only thing I did differently was add glaze to the final product, which I would not recommend doing as I felt like the sugar was overkill.

Awesome recipe! I made it with my own home-made pastry, used Honeycrisp apples, replaced the white sugar with brown and added some ground clove. At first, I was a little afraid the sauce would be too sticky or make the pastry too gummy, but it turned out great! I've made it with whole apples and half apples (for slightly smaller servings). I will be making these often! Thanks so much for the recipe.

this recipe was so awesome. I used the recipe for "French Pastry Pie Crust" on this site. I kind of messed up the sauce because I ran out of butter, but it still turned out delish!! Will be making these for my thanksgiving party!!

Recipe is a keeper. There is a problem with the butter though. It does not state how much butter to use in the sauce or how much to use in the dumplings themselves.So you have to guess at it. Also suggest that you make six portions of dough and role them out individually for each apple. Also depending on the size of the apples, you should make a minimum double crust recipe for a 10" pie. I used medium sized apples, not large as the recipe called for and had barely enough dough for the crust. Less than that you will not have enough.crust for the dumplings. that would be 2 &2/3 cup of flour or 374 grams; 1 cup of shortening; 1 tsp salt; and 7.5 tbs of chilled water.

these were delicious! I used a premade pie dough because I did not have time to make my own. 
I thought that the caramel sauce would get a little thicker and might try thickening it a little next time but still delicious. Served it with vanilla ice cream.

These are wonderful. The sauce is a little on the sweet side so instead of serving with Vanilla Ice Cream we served with half n half or cream. The non sweetness of the cream balanced everything out. I will definitely be making these again!

This is the first time I have ever made or tasted an apple dumpling.  I had some apples I needed to use up so I thought I would try to make them.  I used McIntosh because that is what I had on hand.  I will try with the Granny Smiths the next time I make them.  They are a little time consuming but totally worth it.  I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg on the top before baking.  They tasted wonderful.  My husband liked them too.  I will be making them again.

they may not be the best looking dumpling on the block, but they sure taste good. used store bought pie dough(mrs. smith's) and added more brown sugar and cinnamon. served warm with vanilla ice cream and they were great.

This is yummy. I took the suggestions from the other reviewer's and chopped the apples. I prefer red apples. Also, I used margarine. Came out too salty. Will use unsalted butter next time.

These were good.  I used store bought pie crusts and followed the recipe.  I only used 1/2 the sugar stated and the syrup was a bit runny.  The family didn't mind and ate them all!

These turned out delicious!  I added some red hots inside the apples and in the sauce to give them more flavor.  I will definitely make these again.

The taste was wonderful!  A little too much liquid.  Will cut back to 2 cups of water next time.
