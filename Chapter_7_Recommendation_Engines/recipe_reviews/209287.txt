Had to use boneless skinless chicken breasts so I skipped the boiling step.  I used a cup or so of chicken broth to replace the water.  This was Delicious, a great break from the usual rotation of chicken recipes!

This has become a new favorite in our house.  it is easy and so delicious.  I just let it cook much longer so all of the flavors meld and the prunes totally degrade.  Yummy!

Loved it. Used chicken tenders: since no pre-boiling I used 2 c broth. Only used  1/2 T paprika since I'm not so sure it's "sweet" and was afraid to spice it up to much for the kids (2 and 4 yr). Sort of tastes like French Onion soup. So delicious.

OMG! Seriously, this was a big hit at my recent gathering! People raved how good it was! I doubles the meet and reduced the chicken stock to 2 cups, and only used 2 onions instead. But I followed the rest of the recipe.  I Cooked it a little linger and didn't serve it right away.  We didn't start eating till about two hours after and it was delicious! It was so good my boys wanted to it it again the next day!  I served it hot and it didn't taste the same! So I think letting it sit for a whole or cooking it longer will make it taste so good.  Promise!

This was delicious !!!. One thing I did change was the feta cheese. I did not have any !!! So.... I added blue cheese. The kabobs were as moist as could be. We loved them.

incredibly rich blend of flavors from such a simple few ingredients, go for it!  I had a whole chicken i was baking anyway so just combined the remaining ingredients as instructed sans the chicken, making the sauce separately to pour over the chicken (and stole a bit of the grease/gravy from the chicken while it was cooking and added it to the sauce so the complete flavors could all blend together).

I took a chance and served this dish at a dinner party without testing it. Doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly. It was a huge hit! Perfectly balanced spiciness. I'll definitely make this again soon.

I followed the recipe but with only two large onions. I agree with other reviewers on two things--better the next day and surprisingly complex flavours for so few ingredients. This is going to be a favourite--have to use thighs for the flavour though.

I was looking for something different, I loved the simplicity of this dish yet the complexity of the flavors! My son didn't love it,  so I shredded sharp cheddar cheese on his... But my husband LOVED IT! Thanks for sharing :)

Really enjoyed this dish, how ever it seems to taste better when it sits in the fridge over night, rather than right after it is cooked.

This is delicious. I am a chef. The crunchy potato issue is because of the vinegar not the microwave. Vinegar inhibits some vegetables from cooking.

This is a delicious recipe! We paired it with the Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad from this site and a boxed rice pilaf. We used the remaining liquid, from cooking the chicken, to make the rice. We really enjoyed this recipe.

Used chicken breasts instead. Overall seemed a little bland. Might make again with some changes.

Based on several other reviews, I used chicken broth rather than water.  Broth adds an abundance of flavor.  Because I used the broth, I reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp of celery salt.  Otherwise, I made no changes and was amazed at the flavors.  Oh, and I simmered the meal for at least 90 minutes.  Like any stew, the longer it simmers, the better the taste.  I rated this meal four starts because i used the chicken broth and not the water.  I will definitely make again.  I was easy, delicious and quick.

I followed the recipe to the letter using thighs and breasts.   I even let it sit overnight because of someone saying it was better the next day. However, I don't feel it was anything fantastic. My guests said it was just okay.

I made this and loved it. There is a correction that needs to be made to the recipe tho: it calls for SMOKEY paprika, not sweet paprika.

Made this for dinner last night and it was delicious.  I made no changes.  I was concerned that there was a LOT of paprika when I measured it out on my kitchen scale, but it was perfect!  Easy to prepare and delicious.
