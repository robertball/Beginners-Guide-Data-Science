I have made this numerous times for parties; I always leave with an empty bowl.  Guests comment on the feta as a different but delicious twist on salsa.  Definitely use 4 avocadoes instead of one.  Don't use parsley or oregano, but in their place use fresh snipped cilantro.  I also add 1 - 2 finely chopped jalapenos (depending on the amount of heat wanted).  This recipe is easy to make and sooooo delicious!

At first I made it as written, with the following exceptions as per other reviews:  1) Used 2 avocados, not just 1  2) Used cilantro instead of parsley.  I also used about 4 cloves of garlic that I roasted the other day instead of one raw minced clove.  I let it marinade...the flavor was good...I liked the taste of the red wine vinegar.  But something was lacking, there wasn't enough "bite" for me in it.  And I don't really see what the feta added besides calories; it added no extra flavor or texture that was necessary.  So I added about 1/2 can corn and 3/4 can black beans.  Now I have something to munch on!  I will make it again, but with corn and beans in place of feta.

This recipe rocks! Added cilantro instead of the parsley and a bit of fresh squeezed lemon. In my opinion, you can't have salsa without cilantro. Much much more tasty that guacamole!

I made this for a 4th of July gathering, noting the numerous 5-star reviews, and received a unanimous thumbs-up.  I would probably never have come up with this combination of ingredients on my own, but it works!  Definitely go with the cilantro over the oregano/parsley.  The beauty of this recipe is that you really don't have to follow the ingredient quantities too closely.  I just kept adding (and tasting, naturally!) until I had the desired amount, adjusting the seasoning accordingly.  This one's a keeper!

Great salsa!  I added cilantro (about 1/3 c)instead of parsley.  I also sprinkled a bit of lemon juice.  The oregano and red wine vinegar were suprisingly tasty in this salsa.  Will make again!!!

This stuff is awesome!!!  I make it for almost every gathering I go to.  It is ALWAYS requested.  The only change I make is omitting the parsley and oregano and adding cilantro instead. It gives it more of an authentic salsa taste.

YUM. I made this for the girls and work and it was devoured. I used 3 avocados, minced garlic and fresh lemon juice instead of the olive oil. I also added a fresh finely chopped seeded jalepeno pepper. It was a very nice change from the ordinary salsa!

LOVE THIS!! I make it way too much, but can never get enough. Some nights my husband and I pop open a bottle of wine and just have this for dinner. Instead of the fresh parsely and oregano, I use fresh basil.

I love this recipe!  I do not have fresh parsley or oregano on hand usually, but works fine with bottled seasonings too.  The fresh taste of the avocado and feta together is wonderful.  I get a long baguette bread slice it thin, baste it with olive oil and garlic and bake on 400 for 10 minutes, this is how we like to eat our avocado feta salsa!

This is one of the best and most flavorful salsas I have ever had. My husband, who is not a huge feta, or avocado lover, was crazy over it. No one had room for dinner, as we ate all of this. Great recipe!

I took this to a lake party and everyone liked it and wanted to know "what is in this." Refering to the feta cheese.  Good flavor and a fun new spin on salsa.

This is one of those diamond in the rough recipes. You are not sure what the end result will be. I first took it to a mexican theme beach party and was swarmed by all men and women asking for the recipe. I didn't change a thing.  I have made it at least 20 times since then and still getting swarmed . I love the fresh taste of all the ingredients together. If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!!!

This is soooo good! Do NOT change the avocado to feta ratio it is perfect (this is not guacamole it is completely different).  Parsley is not completely necessary or can be substituted for cilantro which in my option is way better.  I went really fast at my football party.

LOVE this. We make this all of the time. I often bring this when I need a dish to share and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I always double or triple the recipe though as it doesn't make very much as written.

This is the BOMB!  Wow!  I made this on Thanksgiving to share with the family and it was an instant hit!  It's even better the next day (even though the avacados start turning colors)  Such a nice change from traditional guacamole and the feta cheese is what makes it a 5 star recipe.  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent.  Everyone at the new years party enjoyed this.  Wonderful burst of flavors and so easy to make. Only had about 6 hours to refridgerate  so I was worried the flavors wouldn't have time to blend but it turned out great.

This appetizer was delicious!  I did what many reviewers suggested and used cilantro instead of oregano and parsley.  I also love avocado, so I used 2 or 3 of them.  To make it more colorful and hearty, I added corn and black beans as another reviewer suggested.  A fast, delicious appetizer to bring to any gathering!

I give the original salsa about a 3.  I used 4 avocados, 4 oz. of feta cheese and 3 plum tomatoes.  Then when I added the lemon juice and cilantro it still just didn't have enough taste.  I happened to have a packet of salsa seasoning mix around for when I make fresh salsa, I added that and it turned out delicious!  It didn't last long!

I used a jumbo avocado and thought it was the perfect amount. I used dry seasoning because that was all i had. I would not change a thing! I serve it with Wheat Thin Multigrain Toasted Chips. YUM!

As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is better with more avocados. Also, this recipes make a lot of salsa - for 4 people, half of the recipe would probably have been fine.

AMAZING! I substituted cilantro for oregano. It tasted incredible as soon as I made it- after it set for 2 hours... it blew me away! A must make! I will add this as a staple in my home and share it when I have company.

This is awesome as a side dish, as it is more of a salad than a salsa imo. I skipped the garlic and used dried parsley and italian herbs, but whatever you do, don't skip the feta, that's what makes this good. Super tasty, very healthy, easy to make

This was really good. I served it at a party and this one was gone while the other dips were hardly touched. Per other reviews I used 2 avocados and cilantro instead of parsley. I also threw in a bit of blue cheese crumbles for extra zing.

I followed the recipe accept for the items that I didn't have on hand.  I used a yellow onion and dried spices in lieu of fresh to save myself a trip to the store. It was delicious, but after tasting a little, I decided to add a little pepper and a small minced jalapeno to give it a little bite.  My husband couldn't wait the 6 hours to eat it!  We will definitely make this recipe again!

This is SO good that my 10 yr old who never would eat avacado actually tried and liked it!! These are great flavor combos. Took to a pool party and was gone before the first round of people ate! Yum! I could make a meal of this with a bowl of scoops.

I originally saw this Southern Living, which it says to avoid putting it in the refrigerator with the tomatoes, as they will soften.  I mix all but the tomatoes and avocado then refrigerate.  I mix the feta mix with the tomatoes and avocado right before serving.  Very popular in my family.  Yum!

Yum!  I bring this to work for lunch, and it's great.  I use fresh mozzarella with basil in it instead of feta cheese.  Bring some nuts along and you've got a nice, healthy, well-balanced lunch.

This was like a magnet at a party. It's a beautiful plate of green and tastes healthy. It ended up being the first appetizer gone even though it was the last opened.

Thought I created this myself....added a little balsamic, made it a bit saltier.  But all in all, this is a great recipe.  Should've looked here first.  Friends loved it..very flavorful, refreshing and great to eat as a salad without pita. So much for thinking I was creative...hahaha

This is just over-the-top delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted cilantro for parsley and oregano; I also used three avocados and three plum tomatoes.  Do yourself a favor and give this a try!

I made this last weekend for a party and it was a huge hit! I took the advice of other reviews and used four small avocados instead of just one. The first time I made this dip I didn't have any fresh oregano on hand, but made it again last night and was able to include it. It definitely added some more flavor, but it was plenty tasty both times I whipped it up. This one is a keeper!

Ok as is...my changes:  3 avocados, cilantro instead of the parsley and oregano, 1 jar (either 8 or 16 oz depending on your preferred taste) medium chunky salsa instead of the tomatoes, olive oil and onion. The salsa has all the veggies and extra flavor this recipe could use. And if it is your taste, use hot salsa.

I can’t even say rookie mistake…it was just a plain old mistake not to read the reviews before making this.  I had fresh oregano in the fridge so I went with it.  As soon as I tasted the salsa I knew it was a mistake.  Cilantro, as reviewers suggested, would have been the way to go.  I must say, though,  it was not ignored on the appetizer table.

This was a real hit! I added more tomato, avocado and garlic. I did as others suggested and used cilantro opposed to the oregano and parsley, I also added a few jalapenos. It was gone in no time, even a person who doesn’t like guacamole liked this. I will definitely make this again.

I substituted cilantro for parsley & used 4 or 5 avocados.  I didn't measure anything, I don't think ingredients need to be exact for this recipe.  It was delicious!  A wonderful twist on guacamole. Everyone that tried it, loved it! The feta really adds great flavor.  I may add a little jalepeno next time for some spice.  Definitely a keeper!

This stuff is sooooooo good! I am in love with it. I even added it to some rice and had it as a meal all by itself. The first time I made it I toasted some French bread brushed in oil and topped each piece with the salsa for guests. I did not have fresh parsley or oregano so I just used dry. This recipe is staying in my recipe box for a long time.

This was really good! However, I doubled the recipe and it still only made a very small batch.  I would triple or quadruple if making this for a larger group of people.  Will definitely make again - very addicting.

I don't know if it was the brand of feta I used or not, but this had a odd taste to it, we didn't particularly enjoy it.

The feta cheese creates an AMAZING contrast of flavors with the tomao, onion, CILANTRO (not parsley) and avocado.
WE ADDED: 2 or 3 TBS of V-8 Juice and about 1/2 TSP of hot sauce. MUCH better!

LOVE IT! This is a nice mix between salsa and guacamole. The cubed avacado is a nice change from ordinary guac. I made a double batch but used three avacados. I think the feta cheese is vital to this recipe so don't leave it out as another reviewer suggested! I did have leftovers since I made so much and put it in a chicken burrito which was fabulous!

I loved this Mediterranean twist on salsa!  I added a bit more vinegar--but that's just because I LOVE vinegar!  Very tasty and easy!  Thanks for sharing this!

This is a great recipe.  Just a little tweeking.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, diced up on jalapeno and added the juice of one lime.  The feta gave it an interesting tang and creaminess.  A keeper!!

Huge hit!  It was the first appetizer to get completely devoured and I was asked for the recipe several times.  This one is a keeper.  Nice change from regular guacamole.

Made it last night and lets just say my husband and I had it as our dinner.  We finished the whole bowl!!  Goes great with Tostitos Hint of Jalapeno Scoops for a bit of a kick.  Making for a House Warming Party I'm going it's so delicious

This is fantatastic. I have made this several times entertaining at our house. Note-- this does not keep well-- it starts to get pretty soggy and gross. I only keep it for that day and then just pitch the rest. A truly fabulous and unique dish!

A little too bland for our taste. We added diced jalepenos and that helped a little. But still, I wouldn't make this again. ...not appealing to the eye ....and not enough texture.  I agree with another poster that you can't really taste the feta cheese.

Excellent. I have tried several variations.  I have settled on using 2 avocados, half a red onion, more garlic, and chopped fresh cilantro instead of parsley and oregano.

Absolutely delicious salsa.  I did switch out the parsley and oregano for cilantro, because I felt it went better.  I also added a little jalapeno for heat and a squirt of lemon.  The avocado and feta make it so creamy.  It is definitely a refreshing salsa, any time of the year.  Thanks for the keeper!

In all honesty, 5 stars is too low for this recipe! I was in the mood for a light dinner: filling, healthy, fresh, but still light. This hit the spot! Like others, I omitted the parsley and oregano and used only cilantro. I also used 3 avocados, but 4 would have been great, too. Also, I didn't have any plum tomatoes, so I just used half of a large hothouse tomato, seeded, and that was great. And I, too, threw in a seeded, minced jalapeno. Overall, this was absolutely wonderful. I actually ate it as a meal because it was just so delicious, but it would also work as an appetizer, served with corn tortilla chips. This was just over the top! TWO THINGS: 1. It doesn't keep well, so make only what you're sure to use. Once refrigerated for a period of time, the avocados start to brown, of course. 2. The first time I made it, I did so with red wine vinegar and I was sold. The second time I made it, I did it with white wine vinegar, and I was HOOKED! The white wine vinegar gives it a smoother, slightly sweeter taste, and it is absolutely wonderful! If you've got white wine vinegar on hand, use it!

This was awesome!  Made it for a party and it was gone.  This one is going in my list of regular recipes.

Changes made:  Used three avocados and 3 tomatoes, fresh cilantro instead of parsley/oregano.  Reserved a small amount of tomato, feta and cilantro and sprinkled on top of dip to make it look nicer.  Served with tortilla chips.

This is one of my favorites!! I am definitely making it again - perfect for a party appetizer.  Try adding an extra avocado and some diced red or yellow peppers. It goes great with guacamole-flavored tortilla chips too!

This was great!  I used tomato basil feta cheese since that's what I had and it turned out fabulous.  With the basil it tasted more italian than mexican and would be great as an appetizer when serving italian food.  That's what I plan on doing this weekend for a gathering we're having.

I was really hoping to like this recipe, based on the others' reviews and because it had the potential to be really unique.  I just wasn't wowed.  It could partly be because my avocados were slightly under-ripe, but overall, I wouldn't make this one again.

Amazing!  Always a big hit and can be used as a dip, in fajitas or tacos or even a side topping to steak or chicken done with a citrus or cilantro marinade.  Yummy in my tummy!

First Rate!! I have yet to have a better dip/salsa with avocado...this is truly fantastic...I love garlic so I used about 4 cloves...had no red onion on hand so used sweet spanish and had to use dried oregano and parsley...after about 5 hours in the fridge it was heavenly...we ate the whole bowl...after dinner!!...Can't recommend this enuff..

We loved this. I added cucumber and served with chips and crackers one time. Then I added shrimp, mango, cucumber and lime juice and served it over a bed of spinach as a salad. Again, it was a big hit with the family!

Three words for this salsa - yum, yum, yum!  I made this on a whim as I had all the ingredients.  It was far better than I was anticipating.  I took this to work and served it with bagel thins and it was gone in no time.  The flavors of the avocado, tomatoes, onion, garlic, parsley, feta and spices work so well together.  Definitely let this meld for a few hours and it just enhances the flavors.

My goodness....this is just the absolute best summer dip ever.  The blend of all the different flavors is so unique and delicious! I struggled to find the right food to dip and settled on some light wafer like cracker/ crisps with very little flavor that simply added that crunch.  Pita chips are good also.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This was awesome! Like earlier reviewers, I used cilantro instead of parsley and oregano. I used 2 avocados and added a can of drained black beans. I would have added frozen or fresh corn if I had any. I also used olive oil in place of the vinegar and cherry tomatoes (yellow and red) in place of the plum tomatoes. The cherry tomatoes add a beautiful color. My one presentation suggestion would be to add everything but the avocados and add then last- gently stirring them in. If you mix them early, they put a slight coating on everything else which doesn't look great. But the taste overrides any of those issues. Great recipe! I took to a party and everyone wanted the recipe.

Amazing!!!  I did change it a bit, did the cilantro instead of parsley as I love cilantro and that's what I had in my fridge.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  It is the best salsa I have ever eaten!!

hands down the best dip I've ever had. My boyfriend was CONVINCED he didn't like avocado, and he's begged me to make this for him almost every day. 

Made this for my family for a trip home, everyone raved about it and my mother licked the bowl clean. Clearly a great success.

Wow!  This was amazing.  I'm now calling it "guaca" because it's a blend of salsa and guacamole and pure heaven.  Although, I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of parsley, I substituted cilantro.  I also used a little cayenne pepper and cumin, instead of the dried basil.  The end result...over indulgence because it tasted that good.  My husband could not stop eating it, nor could I!

I've never made guacamole without using the instant powder mix that goes in it. This was soooo good!! Took readers advice & used fresh cilantro instead of parsley & oregano. Used minced garlic to save time & used two tablespoons of lemon juice. Perfect!

I have not personally made this but did eat it!! By far one of the best dips I have ever had. I prefer a white corn chip with it. Also, there was cilantro in the one I had, seems odd for this recipes to not have cilantro. Excellent recipe, must try!!!

It's delicious. Very yummy combo I wouldn't have put together. I also used half a lime's worth of juice and cilantro instead of parsley and oregano. I like that kind of flavor- but it's great both ways. It was gobbled up in no time, with requests for more next time :)

Everytime I make this dish for a get together it practically disappears in what seems like moments. I always have to quadruple the servings if everyone is to have a chance to try it. This was the first recipe I tried from this site and has been the catalyst for me trying new things out in the kitchen :)

Turned out fantastic! Wonderful dip. Only thing I changed was I didn't have fresh oregano so I just sprinkled a little in. I also put in fresh cilantro in place of the parsley. Loved it! Perfect if you want a dip that will impress everyone!!!

Definitely Add Cilantro instead of parsley and also we added a couple of Jalapeno chopped.  Its hard
to wait for it to chill.  We were ready to eat it right
away. Also Lime squeeze. YUM!

Great summer dip to eat with corn chips or pitas. Very easy to make and full of flavor.  We made a batch tonight and before our guests arrived had to make a 2nd one! I'll make this again!!!

This was SO good.  The only changes I made were to use two avocados instead of one and replace the parsley/oregano with cilantro. It was super light and tasty. Will add to my arsenal and use frequently.

It was great!  I used 2 avacados, dried herbs (teaspoon of each) and I had sun dried tomato feta.  I made my own pita chips.  I came home with an empty bowl

I made this for a babyshower and it was a huge hit. I used more lime juice and avocado than it called for but also threw in a green pepper for a little more crunch.

Loved this salsa! I did two avocados instead of one, and used 1 tsp. dried oregano since I couldn't find fresh. It was delicious! I may try it with cilantro instead of parsley next time, but only for curiosity's sake--not because it didn't taste great this time. I liked it better on whole grain pita chips than on tortilla chips. Will definitely make this again!

Everyone could not get enough.  I was asked to give the recipie.  I will definitely be makeing this again.  I did not put the oregano but instead put double the cilantro.  Next time I will add more jalapeno to kick it up a bit.

Oh my word is this good!!!!  I made it exactly as written (except for using onion powder in place of fresh onion and 1tsp. dried parsley and 1tsp. dried oregano) and my husband and I are about to eat the entire thing instead of sharing with friends tonight!!  Addicting!  Although I'd definitely say this serves 4, maybe 6, but definitely not 12.  I'd say that scaling it to 18 is perfect for 6 people.  Also-I cut the garlic in half, as it always seems way too garlicy.

I loved this. But I love garlic.  I don't think you will like it if you don't like garlic.  I skipped the onion.. not a fan. 

I actually ate it as a salad. I think would be a good bruschetta.  Will be making this again for sure.

This recipe is great, but as many others have mentioned, I add fresh Cilantro instead of Parsley and Oregano. I leave out the vinegar and onions. I also coat the avocado in lemon juice before I add it to the mix. It keeps them from browning and adds to the flavor. I also add frozen sweet corn (thawed), rinsed black beans and seasoning salt to taste.   People always ask for the recipe. I eat it with chips, but some just eat it as a salad.

I've made this at least 10 times since I first found this recipe, and since I'm munching on it yet again I thought it was time to leave a review. This recipe is delicious! It has officially become my replacement to guacamole.  I only made some slight changes-- using 2 avacados, and adding a bit of salt/pepper and paprika.  I've used both cilantro and parsley, and while my preference is for the cilantro, the parsley is also delicious!  I also suggest using the red wine vinegar (and whatever you do-- don't leave out the feta!).  I get regular requests to bring this to parties-- it's definitely a keeper!

I made this for a party last weekend and it was gone almost IMMEDIATELY! I added a whole diced jalapeno and served it with pita chips. Delicious. A bunch of 20 year-old dudes were asking me for the recipe.

Great and goes like hot cakes! ADJUSTMENTS:  Needs 2 or 3 avocados instead of 1, cilantro, AND some seasoned salt and then it is absolute perfection.  You will not be disapointed!

Great recipe! All the other reviews were right on the money. I made a few changes - used 2 avocadoes, left out the olive oil (couldn't make myself add oil to avocadoes!), used garlic powder, used cilantro instead of the parsley/oregano and lime juice (1 lime) instead of vinegar. This is a very strong, very heavy dip, high fat (good fat) dip. Easy to overdo - pace yourself! Took it to work and got several requests for the recipe.

Made with 2 Roma tomatoes, as they were on hand, 2 avocadoes, 1 bunch green onions, teaspoon minced roasted garlic, 1/3 cup cilantro, tablespoon oil, tablespoon red wine vinegar, 2 oz feta, juice of 1/2 lime and about a tablespoon of orange juice.  Everyone loved it!

I don't know why I expected this salsa to be mediocre (I only attempted it based on the reviews)...well, I have to say it is SO simple and twice as delicious.  I make it just as is...but as others have suggested, I have substituted cilantro, and that is just as fabulous...either way you can't lose.  I usually serve with trusty old tortilla chips, and it always gets devoured.  Thanks for such an easy, delicious recipe!

This is the first review I have written even though I have used many, many recipes.  This is an excellent salsa dip and is so easily adaptable to your own taste.  I served it the first night with tortilla chips (pita toasted would be good too) and would use "scoops" next time.  The next day I grilled up chicken (pounded thin), put it on toasted cibatta rolls halved, and topped with the salsa.  My family raved and this is very unusual.  Great summer meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has become a staple for me for parties or whenever avocados are on sale; the blend of flavors and colors is just too good to resist.  Often when I make it I have everything on hand except feta cheese, and I make it anyway.  It turns out great without, though if you have it on hand, you should use it.  I also use all dried spices and garlic powder - saves time and money.  I know double checked, and basil isn't in the recipe, but it fits in perfectly with the other flavors.  I suggest eating it with wheat thins (tr) or on a salad (it makes a great dressing, just add a little more oil and vinegar and stir until avocado is smooth).

AMAZING, it gets eaten up first at every party.  Definately make the same day, the basil wilts it you do it the day before and doesn't have the same taste.  SO GOOD!

YUM.  I thought this would need salt and pepper, but it didn't.  So much for chilling it first - we had it gone within minutes of mixing it up!  Didn't change a thing. (Well, except oregano - I can't get fresh here, so I used dried)

I took this to a party and it disappeared before I could even taste it.  Every time someone saw me they said "wow, that salsa is great."  It's that good!  I added a lot more tomatoes and substitued cilantro for the oregano as someone else suggested.

This salsa recipe is the bomb. I live in Texas and have a passion for Tex-Mex food and this rates as one of the top on my list.  I added 1 finely copped jalapeno for a kick. Afterall, if you don't break a little sweat, it ain't salsa!

I brought this to a party and it was gone within 20 minutes!  I cut the feta in half and used goat cheese, which I found to be a delicious variation.

This is one of the best salsa dips I have ever had.  I entered it into my company salsa contest and won for the most unique.  I highly suggest this wonderful recipe.  Everyone I have made it for loves it!  I put cilantro instead of oregano and it has a much lighter taste.

This was really good.  i didn't have fresh parsley or oregano so i used dried.  I thought there was to much feta, however my husband thought it was perfect.

Simple + healthy + flavorful! This is something we enjoy eating with a fork and it's versatile enough that I can put some on a warm tortilla.  I added green onions but otherwise make this recipe as written.

I made this as written with the exception of adding dried oregano instead of fresh.  I think fresh oregano would have made it better.  This style salsa was good to try for a change and had a nice zip, however the conventional is still our favorite.

Add one more five star rating to this fabulous recipe!  I only had time to let it chill for about 1 hour and it was still delicious!  I subbed cilantro for the parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, SRICE_53098!

This is AMAZING. I would knock down my own grandmother to get at this stuff. I hear a lot of people omitting the oregano and adding cilantro. I'm a cilantro fan, but the red wine vinegar and oregano go SO WELL together. Also, I agree, needs more avocado. I usually use three instead of one, and one tomato instead of two. Serve with pita chips.

So Yummy! I have been making this for years,  I just switched it up by substituting Garlic Expressions Vinaigrette Salad Dressing and a 1/2 of lemon juice. Omitting the garlic, onion, vinegar, and olive oil.  Of course use cilantro and 2 avocados. This was the best version so far!! And easiest!

I was searching for a good salsa recipe for a salsa cook-off party I was invited to and this is the one my husband and I decided on.   We won the contest!  It is a great combination of flavors--so fresh, cool, and yummy!  I did make the change that many others did--I swapped out the oregano and parsley for fresh cilantro, and I added a squeeze of fresh lemon.  In my mind, it is more of a chunky guacamole than a salsa, but no matter--it's delicious whatever you call it!

It is hard to make this a "salsa" as the avocados need to be very firm, so mine ended up more like a chunky guacamole with feta, but still good.  The onion has to be very finely chopped.  I used cilantro instead of the other spices, 4 avocados, some kosher salt, and a little extra vinegar and garlic.

This is an award winner as is. We serve it at every competition tailgate and the judges go crazy for it. Use ripe but not overripe squishy avocados to make chopping and assembly easier. If you want to stretch it, add another avocado. There is never leftovers.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use dried parsley.  I will use white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar next time, personal preference.  Thanks for a solid recipe I can add to my regular rotation!

OMG..... I whipped this up for my mother's 50th birthday bash. Huge hit, I regret not making more as the whole dish was gone within the first hour. Had many request for the recipe, and more salsa.

Great, simple and mouthwatering yummy!

I have taken this appetizer to a few functions and it has been a hit.  I use a little more vinegar than the recipe calls for.

I think I'm in love.  I used 3 avocados (instead of 1) and fresh cilantro instead of parsley and oregano.  I also added about a couple of ounces of lime juice.  Wonderful with baked tortilla chips. Highly recommend and a definite keeper.

I agree with using cilantro instead of parsley and oregano for sure!  I used cojita cheese instead of the feta YUM! or even just Mexican queso, which also has much the same texture as feta.

Was a real hit at dinner party. Super easy. I do agree with other chefs who suggest adding cilantro instead of parsley.  I also added some Morton's Hot Salt for a little kick, next time will add a couple jalapeno peppers.

WOW. I made roasted garlic and spread it over my home made pizza bread after it came out of the oven for dipping. This salsa rocks. My family went crazy for it. Will be making it again soon.

I made a variation of this for a side dish to go with chicken. I added chopped cucumber and corn. Didn't have feta but I'm sure it'd only be better with it. Nice textures and a variety of flavors with this! Yummy and healthy.

Very easy to make, refreshing and delicious!  I served this salsa on a Tostinos Scoops (the kind with a hint of jalepeno) and gave it to my husband as a taste tester.  He was impressed right away and wanted more!  We particularly enjoy the kick that comes from the feta and red wine vinegar.  This will make a great salsa fo a summer BBQ.

A great twist for guacamole lovers.  I did find that I had to drain some of the tomato juice once it had set in the fridge for an hour to chill.

I love this salsa I have made it many times- the only thing I would change is use Cilantro, The Feta cheese makes a great salty addition. I use Roma and Grape Tomatoes to this salsa it makes a great combination.

This is wonderful!  Added a pinch of red pepper flakes and did not have parsley on hand.  Served with triscuit thin crisps and it was fantastic!  Probably only makes 2 servings though, not 12.

Gave this 4 stars since I added lime juice and would be better with cilantro instead of parsely like others said. I used real Bulgarian feta too, not the cheap kind you buy at grocery stores.  You have to go to a european store to get the Bulgarian Sheep's Feta. It's worth the money

i added in way way way too much onion b/c i'm still a beginner and thought i could measure it with  my "eye". yea, no. i put in half a red onion so don't do that! but i give it a 4 because you NEED more avocados. i used 3 and thought it could have been better with more.

This is requested by my 15 year old daughter every weekend that we are home. My sister Colleen tells her company that the salsa isn't that good so that she can eat more of it.  I didn't change a single thing to the recipe.  It is outstanding!!!!

I'm almost a total novice when it comes to cooking, but this recipe was so simple.  I'm basing my 5 stars on the freshly prepared product (after it rests for a few hours in the refrigerator, it should be amazing).  I added a roasted garlic, some lime juice, and cilantro, instead of oregano and parsley.

This is with out a doubt the BEST salsa I have ever tasted! It combines the two things I love most...feta cheese and avocados! It never occurred to me to blend the two together. Simply fantastic!!  The few changes I made were: 4 avocados. Chopped fresh cilantro instead of parsley. 2-3 cloves minced fresh garlic. A splash of fresh lemon juice. A dash of fresh ground pepper and half a jalapeno pepper, finely chopped.

This was an excellent twist on salsa.  I used 2 avocados instead of one and substituted 2 tsp of lime juice and 1 tsp lemon juice for the lemon juice.  I also substituted cilantro instead of oregano and parsley.  Thanks for sharing!  I have already passed this recipe on to two others (giving credit to allrecipes.com, of course).

Made this for a party and it was a big hit.  I didn't have fresh oregano on hand, so I used dried.  Served with corn chips.  It was fresh tasting and delicious.

I made one change to it - My avocados were rather small, so I put two instead of 1.   This is soooo awesome!! Such a lovely, refreshing twist to guacamole! The feta adds to the creaminess and also adds a little tang to it.   This was the second time I made this - first for my family, and then last night for my friends. Both groups loved it, and it disappeared very quickly!

I tossed the avacado in a little bottled lemon juice before adding the other ingredients, and it prevented it from turning brown even hours later.  You do have to let this sit at least 2 hours for the flavors to blend.  It was pretty good---my guests liked it.  I thought it needed a little more zip, but I would make it again because it tastes fresh and is very healthy, especially for a dip.

I make something a lot like this but I just use tomato, avocado, red onion, cilantro, feta and lime juice. Maybe cumin if I feel like it. My husband loves this stuff. :)

I have made this a few times now and it always goes over great. I tossed the avocados in lemon juice and they stayed green through the party. I served it with Whaleed's Pita Chips. Because we had so many people over, I doubled the recipe. It was too much. The original recipe is just fine.

Wow, this is really tangy!  It's a lot like guacamole with feta and the tomatoes and vinegar give it a lot of zip.  Oh, but make sure you don't have any plans for kissing anyone after you eat this. :) Very yummy.

We love this.  The last time I made this I only had dried oregano and didn't care for the dried pieces of spices..I like it much better with the cilantro.  My 15 month old son could not stop eating this.

This is really tasty...so fresh and the flavors go together so well. I made some pita chips (cut pitas into 6ths, split and put rough side up, spray with olive oil and dust w/Greek seasoning) and it was fantastic with those. Will be making again, it will be a hit at parties (if I can stop eating it!)

This is a nice alternative to regular salsa.  We love to make guacamole at our house, so my husband wasn't too convinced with using the avocadoes for somthing different.  However, in the end, we both really liked it and I would make it again.  I did change some things.  I added an extra avocado, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, omitted the parsley and oregano and used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro instead.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party tonight. It was gone so fast, I oouldn't believe it. I too subbed cilantro for the parsley and oregano; I also added chopped yellow pepper for color. I squeezed a fresh lime in before serving and did not use the vinegar. I served this with oven-baked naan brushed with olive oil. Seriously good. This recipe would have been delicious as written; I made my subs to complement the rest of my menu. Thanks for this!

one of my favorite things in the world. i literally have the recipe memorized i've made it so many times.  my roommates DEVOUR it whenever it's made.  i cook a lot and this is the one recipe that regardless of tastes, preferences anything people ALWAYS love.  Sometimes i sub cilantro for the parsley which gives it a really awesome flavor as well, but seriously, the recipe is perfection as is. make it now!

This is an awesome recipe!! I made it chunky and I ate it as a salad instead of a salsa. It was great even with the blend of lettuce.

Another great salsa from this site! I had to try this one as it had feta and  avocado, both which I love! Some modifications I made were adding in half a jalapeño pepper, using dried oregano,adding in cilantro, adding in 1/2 a tsp of black pepper and squeezing 1 lime on top at the end.

I eat this for breakfast almost every morning... slather a piece of whole wheat toast with it and mmmmm! A nutritious and tasty breakfast. I leave out the oregano and usually use whatever onion we have around, and it's always delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I used previous suggestion and added cilantro instead of oregano.  Then grabbed blue cheese instead of feta by mistake.  After a slight panic, tried the recipe and it was fantastic.  Recipe is very flexible.  Took to tailgating party with baked pita "chips" and was a big hit.

Wonderful!  I brought this to a work function and everyone loved it.  I did not add garlic and it was still great.  I also think that next time I might try cilantro instead of oregano...although the oregano was very good.

This has become one of my standard summer recipes that I crave all the time.  It is great exactly as written, and also really good if you substitute basil for the oregano.  I usually leave out the garlic if I am making this for others, and it still has lots of flavor.

This was a big hit at my party, but I put an extra avocado in and I felt it could have used even one or two more in order for the feta to not be overpowering.  Yummy, though, and different.

I didn't add the onion, and used garlic powder and dry herbs, but it was still the most fabulous snack ever. I'm sitting here right now eating it with crackers. I'm sure with all the fresh ingredients its even better... if that's even possible!

Fantastic. No changes necessary, although we've found that cilantro makes a good substitute for the parsley. This has quickly become a favorite dip at parties.

Made this for a get together last night.  After letting it sit and tasting it I added salt, pepper, the juice of a half lime and some cilantro.  Thought it perked up the taste alot.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Used fresh oregano, parsley and cilantro, not having enough growing of the first two. Had it as a side dish with a baked salmon patty and pilaf.

I'm obviously in the minority here but I don't see how this gets 5 stars.  I thought the taste was very bland.  No spice to it, even though I added a jalapeño as some reviewers suggested, and I also tried cilantro instead of the oregano, which many suggested.  Still meh.  Then I added some green chili peppers.  Still too bland for my taste - and I'm not just saying it had no heat (which it didn't), it was just such a nothing flavor.  I agree with some others about the feta, there is way too much of it.  So disappointed, I doubled the recipe for Super Bowl. :(

I love this recipe.  I make it without the feta because it is not needed.  The recipe is so good without it and that is saying a lot because I am a cheese lover.

5 starts as is - the feta is a nice touch.  This is also a great topper for tacos, burritos, etc.  I added another avocado as recommended by other reviewers and about a cup of seeded cucumber to give it a more summery-fresh appeal. Thanks for sharing!

I love this! Also family and friends at work love it! and many have asked for the recipe or ask me to make it again.  I usually use 3 plum tomatoes. And I double the entire recipe because everyone loves it, with chips or just by itself (for the people cutting carbs). I also use cilantro instead of parsley and oregano (a generous 1/2 cup of fresh) because I like it and grow it myself. This is a salsa, not guacamole, so don't add more avocado.

Delicious!  I served to my women's game group and everyone raved.  This is one of my go to recipes now when I have to take a dish that's quick to prepare for a potluck.  Always popular.  the avacados give it a nice twist.

I loved this even before it had a chance to chill and meld together.  I had only cilantro, so substituted that for the parsley.  Loved the feta.  It added the perfect finish.  Think next time I will add a splash of lemon.  Didn't read through all of the reviews, but kept thinking that salad shrimp would be a fun variation.

I'm not going to lie... this stuff does not look tasty.  Especially if you opt for the red wine vinegar.  We had a bowl of it on the floor once to snack on while watching tv: the cat took a look at it and tried to bury it in the same way he tries to hide where he's been sick:)  But it is really, *really* tasty.  I actually like it best just as written, but as others have said, cilantro works fine as a sub for the parsley.  

Bring it to your next potluck.  It's funny to watch everybody glance at it suspiciously, take a timid sample, and then scarf it all up.

My family would give 20stars for this!!! It is very very tasty. The only thing is - we really doubt the number of servings. In my opinion, it's maximum 4 servings! Unless it is a starter for 5 dishes dinner :)  Bravo for the recipe!

Rave reviews as expected based on the previous reviews!  I doubled recipe, added an extra avacado, substituted cilantro for parsley & oregano, added lemon juice, and served with tortilla chips.  Spectacular and a huge hit!

I have made this recipe on numerous occasions and receive rave reviews from all who taste it!  Everyone is always asking for the recipe.  Have even turned non guac lovers into guac lovers!  I usually use 6 avacodos though because 1-2 is just not enough, so then I double the amounts of everyting else. (basically, I taste test as I go along). I also use cilantro as suggested by other reviewers and add lemon at the end for that extra zing everyone loves!

Made it unchanged and then as reviewers suggested with extra avacado and subbing cilantro for parsley and oregano, 4 stars as written 5 stars when changed. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Yum!! This is a really great enhanced guacamole with a lot of awesome flavors. I served it at a party and it doesn't look as appetizing as guacamole does, so I'd recommend serving it only at a smaller gathering or putting a note telling what it is to entice people.

This was pretty good, I used canned tomatoes instead and red wine vinegar.  Just difficult to mix, starts to turn into guacamole instead of salsa.

I love the combination of the tomato, feta and avocado.  This recipe is easy to make and perfect for a summer party.  I also snipped some cilantro in the salsa for a fresh flavor.

This recipe was delicious!  I followed other reviewers advice and used fresh cilantro rather than the other herbs.  I also used feta with garlic and herbs, which really enhanced the flavor.  Next time I will probably add some fresh lime juice for a little more acidity.

I was the only one eating and it was gone almost instantly!  One of the spices (parsley or oregano) was a little strong for me, but I don't have the skills to recognize which one, so in the future I'd probably experiment with using less of one or both.

This recipe was phenomenal. I'm a vegetarian and love Mediterranean foods - this hit all the right spots. We followed the directions to a T and it turned out perfectly. I wouldn't have changed a thing about this recipe - for all those who love a good (and pretty healthy) recipe, try this! Loved it.

I omitted the parsley, olive oil, vinegar and oregano, to make a more traditional guacamole type dish, and added the juice of one lime. And i found this delicious!!! I added black beans and canned corn kernels to make it more hearty. I also think that the feta added a nice flavour and texture to it. We ate it with mini pita's to cut the fat which was good but I think multigrain tortilla chips would have been better. Yum! Will definitely be making again.

I debated whether or not to try this one because everyone seemed to think it needed cilantro. I personally think cilantro is the most horrible green thing on the planet. For those of you who feel the same way, it's great without cilantro too. I left out the olive oil, added everything else, but measured nothing, as per usual. I also added 2 jalepeños and the juice of one lime. If you plan on serving 12, like the recipe states, you will have to use A LOT more than it calls for. I used 6 small avocados and 3 large tomatoes and still seems to be a small amount for 12 appetizers.

Added more avocado, fresh lemon juice & cilantro.  Omitted the oregano but kept the parsley because I personally love the flavor.  This is always a favorite and even people who tell me they don't like avocados still love this salsa.  I always serve this with multi-grained tortilla chips, I feel like it compliments the ingredients in the salsa more than just the regular flour tortilla chips.

It seems like everyone likes this.  Easy to make and a nice alternative to traditional tomato salsa for those who can't eat a lot of tomato based foods.  Definitely use the cilantro!

I substituted garden tomatoes, used dried herbs and added fresh cilantro and garlic.  Really a delicious snack recipe.  Great for those raw food eating plans.

Perfect just the way it is. I usually double it. But I use dried herbs since that is what I have. I just use a tbs of dried herbs when I double it. I also squeeze in half of a lime juice.

Delicious Twist! My family memerbers are guacamole connoisseurs and they loved this. I made this the night before without the avacado and then added the avacado right before serving. I also used a plastic knife to cut the avacado - it browns slower this way. I used CHERRY tomatoes instead. The FETA is a MUST.

This was a hit at my book club. Substituted cilantro for parsley/oregano, used 2 avocados, it was delicious. Hubby was super sad when I took it to book club and asked that I make more for him to eat. I am tempted to use this to fill a pita and eat it like a wrap.

I didn't realize that avocado and feta went along so well.  I'm planning on making this dip for 3 different parties this week.

I have made this many times to take to parties and get-togethers, and people tell me every time how much they love it.  I use cilantro instead of parsley, but everything else is the same.  It's delish!!

YUM YUM YUM!!! This was incredible. I made it for a girls night on Friday and it was gone in seconds! I made it again for a family get together Saturday and my family devoured it! The only suggestion I have is to squeeze lime on the avocados so they don't turn brown. You don't taste the lime though. Oh and I also followed the other suggestions of substituting cilantro for oregano/parsley. The feta was perfect but I think feta makes everything betta!

Yummy! Followed the recipe exactly and served with thinly sliced French baguette bread. Be sure to use fresh parsley and oregano as opposed to dry as this added alot to the flavor of the dip.

It was great, however, a little bland. I added 2 Tbsp of lime juice and a bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up. Excellent for a creamy salsa with only good fat rather than saturated!

This was very good.  I doubled it for a party, adding extra tomato and some red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I refrigerated for about 5 hours and the avocado was a little mushy. Next time I'll make it an hour or two ahead of time.

I tried this recipe with several of the recommendations made by others. My biggest concern was the recipe not being able to serve 12 people. So I used 3 avocados, 3 tomatoes, lemon juice instead of olive oil and cilantro instead of parsley and oregano. I also added chopped jalepenos. The additional tomatoes and avocados overwhelmed the 4 ounces of feta, as did the jalepenos. If If I make the recipe again I would use the lemon juice (to keep it fresh looking), one additional avocado and the cilantro. If you add too many avocados and tomatoes, you should consider increasing the amount of the feta.

I decided to try this only because the reviews raved about it. I had my reservations about the feta, but OMG! I loved this stuff. My hubby is not a salsa or Guac fan. I made this and gave him a try before I put it in the fridge to sit for a couple hours. After that bite it sat for no more than 5 minutes before we ate the whole batch. I shared this with my mom and her husband and they raved about it as well!

Pretty good, but add more lemon juice because it turns brown pretty fast. I added a mango, and it was a perfect contrast.

I first tried this recipe over two years ago. It's still something I make atleast once a month, and several friends have taken the recipe and used it as well. I think overtime I've also added more avocado, onion, and even extra vinegar and turned it into more of a guacamole instead of a salsa. Same idea though. Great recipe.

Wondeful!  I followed the recipe except I had basil feta on hand so I used that with a little less spice.  Everyone loved it.  I served it at a christmas function and it was very festive with the green, red, and white.  I had several comments on how it was great to have something fresh and light with the traditional christmas appetizers.  Keeper!

Absolutely delicious and addicting (a comment from one of my guests).  I used fresh cilantro instead of the parsley.  I LOVE cilantro.  I served with light pita chips.

I really loved this recipe. When you're making it though, be certain not too accidentally add more of the vinegar than it says. It produces a lot of heat if you do.

This was a great appetizer - I made it for Mother's Day, and again for a graduation party and it was a hit each time. Now I have people making special requests for me to bring it along to all parties!
I think I once omitted the Oregano and Paresly and just added Cilantro - it was still really tasty.
Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I highly recommend seasoning to taste, though. It can be a little bland when you follow the recipe exactly, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. All in all, great idea and very nice combination of flavors!

This was really good. I think it would have tasted even better a slightly less ripe avacado, as mine got pretty mushed up while stirring everything together. I also think it needed just a little salt. I took other reviewers suggestions to replace the parsley and oregano with fresh cilantro. Yum! I will definately make this again. One thing - there's no way this serves 12 people. My husband and I ate it all in one sitting.

Fixed this over the weekend for a camping group. As others suggested, I used fresh cilantro because that's what I had on hand. Added freshly ground black pepper too. I never got to taste it because it was gone so quickly. Everybody asked me for the recipe.  Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this twice this weekend.  I needed to bring a dip to a "Mexican inspired" dinner party.  First tiime I made as directed.  It was good, but bland in my opinion.  Second time I made it I changed some things.  Mainly went by taste:  Used cilantro as others had instead of parsley.  Used dried oregano, since that is what I had on hand.  Left out garlic, b/c I am not a fan.  Didn't measure red wine vinegar, used lime juice and some pepper.  I also added some extra tomato.  With those changes it was so much better.  Everybody raved about it at the party. Will make again.

I found this recipe the other day and having never tried avocado decided it would be a good spring thing to take to a dinner party.  Wow is all I can say!  It's spectacular!  We did take everyone's advice and leave out the parsley and oregano and added cilantro and lemon juice.  I'm making it again for an event this weekend.  Try it!!!  You won't regret it and it will be gone in no time.

PHENOMENAL!!! This recipe is excellent!! I did as others have suggested and substuited cliantro for the parsley and oregano and it turned out perfect. Of course I didn't have much to serve because I stood over the bowl and ate half of it with a spoon! Will definitely make this many more times!!

I have made this many times and I just love it. I do make a few adjustments though, instead of parsley and oregano I use fresh chopped cilantro. I substitute the juice of one lime for the vinegar and add a bit more feta cheese than called for.  Chilling overnight makes all the flavours come out. This is the BEST dip ever!!!

This recipe is AMAZING. My family asks me to make this for everything! Definitely double or triple when you make this recipe, it'll get eaten.

I spoon this over grilled chicken that soaks all day in a tequila lime marinade. My mom also spooned this over quesadillas. Whatever you don't use can definitley be finished with chips!

This recipe is so fresh and delecious. I make this whenever we go camping and it does not last long. We prefer more tomatoes than the recipe calls for and I leave out the parsley and oregano, using fresh cilantro instead.

This was really good.  I will make again, however, next time I will make sure I dice the avocados instead of just chopping them up (the larger bites were a little too overpowering, but when I had smaller bites they blended in nicely with the other flavors).  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic. It's very flavorful and it's definitely a "party pleaser."  Just don't expect it to taste like Guacamole.  It's more of a salsa/dip.

I made this recipe for a baby shower that I threw in early November and it got rave reviews.  It was the first appetizer to dissappear and everyone wanted the recipe.  Now I am going to be doing some visiting at Christmas time and I have been asked by four people to bring the salsa along.  I put black olives in it one time and it was great also.

I've have received so many compliments before on a recipe... had to print copies of this recipe for my co-workers because everyone loved it so much!  I also mixed up some more and wraped it in pita bread wraps as an alternative lunch.  Very tasty!

This one tasted great.  I made it without the feta though.  Still tasted great.  I left the house for an hour and when i came back everyone already ate it all

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have any oregano and I also added more tomatoes and it was quite tasty. I served it as a salsa with Pita chips, and have also tried in as a filling for an omelet. Quite tasty!

Excellent-- I agree this is more of a guacamole than a salsa. It's really good, I think the cheese is the kicker. It turns the recipe into something more than ordinary.

This was VERY good, however, I would not consider it a salsa, as it was more like a guacamole with a kick, we thought.  But we all LOVED it!  Maybe next time I'll try adding another tomato and a jalepeno to give it some spice more like a salsa.  But it was very good the way it was....as a guacamole. :-)

This recipe is so awesome! I made it this past weekend for a family bar-b-que and it was gone in 20 minutes, with many requests for the recipe! As suggested by others on this site, I substituted cilantro for parsley and it was great. I would really recommend trying this one out.  AWESOME! 10 STARS!

I made this switching out the oregano and parsley for cilantro on Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! It was gone within 5 mins and I DOUBLED the recipe! If you’re making it for large groups I suggest making it at least x4.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I did not "chop" the ingredients into small bits - instead, I cubed the tomatoes and avocado because I chose to serve this as a side dish - more like a salad than a salsa.  It was beautiful and tasty served with pan fried turkey breasts and fresh steamed green beans.  Wonderful!

This is a tasty refreshing (easy to make) salsa that I made for a recent gathering of friends.  They loved it, and two asked for the recipe!  I changed nothing in the recipe.  It needs no salt, because the feta cheese adds just the right amount of saltiness to round out the flavors.  Next time I could see adding a just little kick to the flavor but will stick with using parsley, as I am one of those peeps who hates cilantro as some others do.  Safer that way.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used it as a topping on arugula for lunch salads. I will definitely make it again. I used fresh basil instead of parsley because that's what was on hand.  I will continue with it next time too.

So good with tortillas! I did as others said and used 2 avocados and used cilantro instead of parsley. The rest I did as is. Next time I'll double it

I've made this several times, and it is always a hit!! I followed the recipe except I used dried parsley and oregano rather than fresh.

Like many others, I used cilantro.   Be sure to add a bit of lemon to the avocado to prevent it from turning brown.

So good, but with some changes-like most others, I used cilantro and no parsley or oregano. I also use 2 or more avocados. ( I've even had to punt and use canned tomatoes. Although the diced are more convenient, it is easier to take out the seeds if the canned tomatoes are whole. ) Also, sometimes use less olive oil.

I love this recipe. I used dried oregano and parsley, adding the same amounts that the recipe called for without thinking, but I still thought it was amazing. A little high calorie for a side salad, but super tasty and totally worth it.

I saw the suggestions and used 2 large avocados, 3-4 cloves of garlic  and cilantro instead of parsley (probably less feta). Delicious, and fed three hungry adults generously as a salad with dinner.  Will make this regularly!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. I used this as a side dish with steak and potatoes.  Its hardy taste stood well with the rest if the meal. I am not a fan of traditional salads made with greens. This is a great alternative for me.   I used the paper bag method to ripen the avocados.

This recipe was awesome.  I made it with a couple of suggestions from reviews.  I used more  avocado, cilantro instead of oregano and parsley, and a squeeze of lemon juice.  It was the best!! I will definitely do this again.

AWESOME recipe!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I made one change when I made it, that I felt was necessary to be a 5 star (but that's just my opinion - some may prefer it the way it's written).  Instead 1 tbsp. each of fresh parsley and oregano, I used 2 tbsp. of cilantro. Everything else, I used exactly as written and I LOVED it!!

I was looking for a nice healthy after school snack, and this was perfect! I am a big fan of feta, tomatoes, and avocados. The red onion was a little strong for my taste, but other than that it was delicious!! This is a great snack especially when it is hot outside. :)

This is an amazing salsa if you love avocado. I didn't have any oregano or red wine vinegar so i used balsamic instead, and it turned out wonderfully. I'll have to get some oregano for next time as other reviews say it's a significant taste.

I'm going with 2 good sizes small avocados as 1 large isn't enough and and 2 would be too much.  It's so good you can eat it as is.

Tasty, fresh, and healthy.  I served mine inside toasted pocket pitas, so the salsa was more of a sandwich filling.  This recipe keeps for several days, so if you don't mind the avocados turning brown (as they always do), feel free to make ahead.

Delicious, scrumptious and so refreshing. Made this for a party and the salsa was gone in a snap. The freshness of the ingredients and the creamy texture of the avocado and feta cheese, make for a perfect combination. 
I added a fresh jalapeño , basil ( in place of the oregano), and parsley from our garden. Do give the salsa a good squeeze of lemon, it just adds another level of freshness. Thank you for sharing.

Made this a couple of weeks ago to take to my sisters birthday party.  Everyone LOVED it!  I did go with what other reviewers suggested and used basil instead of oregano but that was the only change I made.  Will make again for a 4th of July get together.  It's awesome :)

This recipe is fabulous. When in a pinch for an appetizer and you don't have fresh tomatoes, I have used canned tomatoes that are seasoned with green chilies, garlic/basil or whatever I have on hand. It still turns out very tasty. It's a winner every time!

Fantastic salsa recipe. The feta and avocado get the attention, but you can also use fresh cilantro or even basil to change it up. I always get rave reviews and recipe requests when I take this with me to social functions. 5 stars indeed.

This was really very good. I added an extra avocado and about a half cup of fresh corn, cherry tomatoes instead of plum, sweet onion instead of red, and some fresh basil. Put everything together the night before and a few hours before serving I added the avocados doused in fresh lime juice. I don't like the taste of cilantro so this was perfect. If I were making this for myself (and I will), I would add more garlic and some minced jalapeño pepper. Thanks for posting.

This is fantastic!.  I hate cilantro and nowadays finding good salsa is more difficult without it.  This is positively delicious exactly as written.  The only slight difference I changed was to increase the olive oil and vinegar then whisk them together by drizzling the vinegar in with the oil.  I also added the juice of one lime to prevent browning.  I'm on a strict diet so this worked perfectly for a lunch treat and wrapped in cabbage leaves.  I'm sure this would be great with chips or tortillas too.  It does become almost like guacamole but if you love avocado, this is terrific.  One less star because it does need lime or lemon juice but otherwise, awesome!

What a huge hit!  Definitely use 4 avocados and some cilantro.  The biggest suggestion I can make is to not put the feta cheese in until you serve it or it gets soggy and milky and ruins the brightness of a fresh salsa.  Also, use the block feta instead of crumbled. The crumbled has an acidy powder on the outside I assume to keep them "fresh" longer but it leaves a bad taste on the cheese.

I just started eating avocados recently. But this recipe has turned me into an avocado addict!! Oh this is so good! I took the other suggestions and added cilantro and lemon juice. I even added a bit of basil. Make sure you chop up the oregano finely because it is a strong herb. I ate mine with a breakfast burrito. I'm going to eat the rest with pita chips. This is a keeper for sure!!

Added a little lime juice and chopped coriander instead of parsley. Served with Key West Chicken (also on this site) and it worked perfectly. Very tasty and easy to make.

I would call this, "Italian Guacamole"... You're basically taking a classic dish and replacing cilantro with parsley and oregano and adding in a nice addition of feta cheese.  It is nice to have another dish to use up our plentiful avos here in Maui.  I used two decent sized avocados for this instead of one and felt it suited our tastes better.

Great recipe. Feta adds such a unique flavor so I use more than what is called for. Not sure how some posters thought it did not add a special flavor because to me it totally changed the taste. I loved it. I don't like vinegar so I left it out. This recipe is so amazing and a great snack. The first time I made it I loved it but thought it could use more feta cheese. It adds such a unique taste to the dish. Next time I added 50% more feta than what is called for and thought that was perfect.

Made this for a party last night, it was GONE in a short time.  I don't really like feta cheese but made the recipe as written (except subbed cilantro for parsely.) It was really really good. You know it's a keeper when 5 people ask for the recipe... Thanks for sharing this, SRICE!

Served this at a party. RAVE reviews. My Mother-in-law kept saying - "this is delicious, and I don't like guacamole". My mother, who has probably never eaten an Avocado requested this as a pre-Thanksgiving appetizer. Didn't change a thing!

Great recipe! I tried it for the first time at a potluck party, and the first person who tried it came up to me and said it was "beyond awesome." I love it! I substituted fresh parsley and oregano for dried, and added a little cilantro. Either way, it's the combo of the feta, tomatoes, garlic, red onion and avocado that makes it so good!

I made this for two socials now and have been asked for the recipe several times.  I, too, substituted the cilantro for the italian spices.  I own a blooming onion chopper (as seen on TV) and use this to chop everything (even the avocado!) and it makes it uniform - like a salsa.  Also, this is wonderful on grilled chicken the next day!

I made this to go with chicken tonight and I will do this again. I had no red wine vinegar so I used cooking sherry. My daughter who is a vegetarian enjoyed this with tortilla chips.

So yummy!!! Always a crowd pleaser!! I have tried it with super ripe avocados and pretty firm ones.. Both were very good but I think the less ripe is better. It looks prettier and it's nice to distinguish the different ingredients on each bite.

I liked the the recipe in its original form, though I REALLY liked the recipe after I made some changes based on preference. As recommended by many reviews, I subbed cilantro for Oregano/Parsley. I added the juice of 1/2 a large lemon. I used an ratio of tomato:avocado. So, 2 tomatoes and 2 avocados. Omitted the onion to make more potluck friendly, 1 large clove of garlic,DO NOT omit the olive oil, it gives this dish a creamier consistency and it's good for you. However, I did cut back the amount of olive oil by a smidge. Same amount of redwine vinegar. 3.5 oz Reduced-Fat feta, lightly salt & pepper. It was delicous!

Loved it. I swapped the parsley for cilantro, and used fresh lime juice instead of the vinegar.  I also added half a jalapeño for a little kick.

This recipe is one of those that make you feel great when people eat it!  Everyone loves it.  I used 5 avocados, 1/2 cup red onions, cilantro instead of parsley/oregano and lemon juice instead of olive oil.  I also removed seeds from the tomato to ensure it wasn't too juicy.  Went together quickly and I am sure I will make this regularly in the future.  It has replaced my guacamole recipe!!!

This is delicious and a hit with my family. I've made it twice in a week so far! I used three avocados, three plum tomatoes, 2 tablespoons cilantro for the spice, left out the olive oil, and squeezed half a fresh lime over all. I also added 2 finely chopped seeded jalapeno peppers and used light feta cheese.   I serve this with "Scoop" tortilla chips and it's irresistable. Thanks for the great recipe! It's more like guacamole the way I make it but terrific!!

Fantastic!  I took other's advice and used cilantro in place of parsley & oregano.  Also, I had a large hot house tomato and a large avocado.  I used red wine vinegar and reduced fat feta.   I gently stirred everything together and let it chill for 6 hours.  I felt badly for the hostess of the party.  She sat the bowl down, turned around to talk to someone and the salsa was almost gone.   I will absolutely double this from now on!

They should call this "disappearing Salsa."  I brought this to my wedding shower, and by the time I went up for seconds, it was already gone!  I omitted the spices and used fresh cilantro as others have mentioned.  Also used two avocados, and what amounted to about a cup of chopped tomatoes. Only had white vinegar; I'm sure balsamic would be tasty as well.  I got adventurous and threw in "garlic and herb" feta instead of regular. Next time I make a batch, I'm keeping it for myself and throwing it into some pita bread!

This is the best salsa ever! My husband, who is not prone to give spontaneous compliments, took a couple bites and stopped and said "This is the BEST salsa you ever made!" I didn't have enough red onion, so put half red and half sweet white onion. Doubled the avocado and followed otheres and used cilantro instead of the other spices. I did let the chopped tomatoes drain in the sink for a bit. Turned out perfect. This is a dish I will definately bring to gatherings!

At first, I was a little hesitant to try this recipe (the feta threw me off). But oh my gosh, I am so glad I did! The flavors blend so well together. Whether I'm making it for a party, my family, or just myself, it's sure to be a pleaser. A great healthy snack alternative. Almost guaranteed at least one person will ask for the recipe.

This was very good.  I didn't include the feta cheese, and I took other reviewers advice and skipped the oregano and parsley and replaced them with cilantro.  It needed plenty of salt and more vinegar.  I also added extra avocado and a can of corn and 2 jalapenos.  It was wonderfully fresh and cool.  It made a very nice light dinner with fresh tortilla chips.  (it was a light dinner, so we had ice cream too!  :))

Very good. I omitted the oregano and added cilantro per suggestion. Also added one more avocado and a squeeze of lime juice. It’s like a better version of guacamole, and doesn't brown nearly as quickly as traditional guacamole.

My husband says this recipe is 6 stars.  I use 4 avocados and omit the garlic.  I usually don't measure the red wine vinegar either, but I know there is more in mine than the recipe calls for.  So refreshing!

Wow, this was really good, and different! I had some feta I needed to use up, and this was perfect. I didn't add oregano, because I didn't have any, only parsley. I squeezed half a lime into it too. Very good!

This is definitely yummy -- lots of compliments, if only there was a way to make it look more attractive! I had to encourage people to try it, which is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Once they tried it, they loved it!

I followed directions except I omitted fresh oregano (i just don't like oregano in non-italian dishes).  I did think it needed a little salt and pepper however.  Next time I'll add a little cumin, paprika and fresh cilantro instead of the parsley.  Overall, a really good recipe - fresh and lighter than your usual guacamole.

this was very good but i wouldn't call it a 'salsa' but a chunky guac.  I made it for my book club and it was all gone - and I doubled the recipe!  I used clintro instead of parsley and green onions instead of red.

Wow! I just made this salsa and it is so great! I don't even know how it tastes after chilling in the refrigerator because it didn't make it that far.

I took this to our New Year's Eve gathering, and had to promise to email the recipe to everyone there!  Delicious, and an unqualified hit.

I added some chopped cucumber and baby spinach and put it on a whole wheat wrap for lunch. It was very good. I think the fresh oregano made it a little overpowering though for a wrap...I think next time I will use oregano from the jar or just go without.

I made this for girls night and everyone loved it! It is a definite crowd pleaser. I didn't have fresh oregano- not a big deal since dried worked fine.

I'm not a fan of fresh parsley, but I enjoyed this. Husband preferred it with fresh cilantro. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Husband couldn't stop eating it.  Increased tomato and added a hot pepper.
