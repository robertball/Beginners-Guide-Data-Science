Delicious, light and refreshing. I didn't use the pie filling, just combined fresh berries with fresh whipping cream and used that as filling. I frosted the cake with a simple whipped cream frosting and decorated it with fresh berries, mint and lemon zest. It was AMAZING! So so easy...  love it. This will be coming along with me to every picnic this summer. Thank you for sharing! :)

I live in a somewhat rural area and was never able to find raspberry pie filling. I did however try this cake once with strawberry filling and once with blueberry filling. They were both great. I baked the cake as directed, but afterword, I poked holes in the top of both layers and squeezed some fresh lemon juice over them. It kept the cake very moist.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't have a lemon cake mix, so I used yellow with 1/4 tsp lemon extract. I left the seeds in the raspberry cream. It looked as good as it tasted. This recipe is a keeper.

My co-workers loved this cake when I made it over Easter.  The cake turns out more dense than a typical box cake, so that was great.  This was my first experience with canned pie filling, and the kind I bought was a little bitter, so I think I will try jam or plain crushed berries next time. Also, make sure you check out the canned filling you use, since mine had stems in it!  To serve, I used 3 packages of yellow Peeps chicks and spread them around the edge of the top layer to make a flower.  Very cute!

Great springtime cake, will make it again.  I couldn't find any raspberry filling so I used Raspberry Jam (the seeded kind) and I kinda stink at making iciing so I bought the Betty Crocker Whipped cream topping and added the raspberry to that.  Came out awesome!!
