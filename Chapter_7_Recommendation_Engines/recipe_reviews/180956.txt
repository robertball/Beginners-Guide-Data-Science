I went less on the oil, more on the whiskey, and more on the garlic. Boiled the left over marinade and put mushrooms and onions in it for a steak topping. The guys are still talking about it today! Very good recipe!!! Will be making again!!!!

I used this marinade last night with just a few changes. Used 1/4 cup oil with 2/3 cup of the whiskey. I also added fresh herbs as I have them growing in my garden and a low sodium soy. I chopped 2 green onions and used 2 cloves minced garlic. I was in a hurry so I could not marinate for long...so I let it sit in a freezer bag for an hour at room temp. Perfection!! The meat was tender and very flavorful. The extra whiskey really gives it a buttery soft taste and you can actually taste the whiskey. I hate recipes that use so little of the liquer you never really taste it at all. This way worked best.  I then took the left over marinade and used it to deglaze a pan of sauteed  mushrooms and onions to make a side dish. It was awesome. Will be using this all the time now for flat iron steaks. Thanks so much!

This recipe was great . . . getting the Flat Iron Steak was KEY.  I think next time I will reduce the oil a little bit and increase the whiskey.  Thanks for sharing!

I marinated this for about 4 hours in the fridge.  Unfortunately, I overcooked the meat to well done.  Expecting the meat to be a little tough, I was pleasantly surprised that it was quite tender.  Will make this again, but I will watch the time on the grill.

Has a bite to it!  People who don't like spicy food probably won't enjoy it as much as those of us that do.  Very good and different option because I was looking for something different from sweet-salty or tex-mex.

I loved this and have made it twice.  The changes I made were to use a lot more whiskey, marinade it for a day or two, and to use the oven (since a grill was not available.)  I cooked it at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.  I also used Flank Steak since I did not have Flat Iron available.  I am hoping to try this with Flat Iron the next time I cook it.  Everyone loved this, I used it for Christmas.

I think I heard "WOW!!" about 8 times from my family of 4 before I even had a chance to taste it.  This is GOOD!!  The steak melted in your mouth, the flavor was spot on.  Per another review, I sauteed some mushrooms in butter & garlic until the mushrooms were a little brown, then added the reserved marinade & brought it to a boil for a few min.  I highly recommend the mushrooms...it brought out a gourmet flair to the dish.  Restaurant quality, can't wait to make it for guests, thanks! :o)

This is our "go-to" recipe for flat iron steaks.  Thanks, Alta.  This is a wonderful recipe!!!  We usually buy 2 steaks, each about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2lbs,  place in separate plastic bags with marinade for each and put one in the freezer for later use.  Then, just thaw and throw on the grill - it's already done marinating!  We've also varied the amounts of whiskey  - and have used up to 2/3 cup for 2 steaks.  Try adding a little honey to the marinade for a hint of sweetness.  Once cooked and rested, slice the steak against the grain or it won't be tender.  I usually serve this with roasted potatoes (using small red potatoes leaving the skins on, cutting in half or 4ths depending on the size, garlic powder, kocher salt, black pepper and chopped, fresh rosemary - roast @ 400 degrees ~ 20-25min on a non-stick pan).  This is so yummy. Our company loved it!  Oh, and if there are any leftovers, this steak is delicious on a romaine lettuce salad with tomatoes, feta cheese, thin-sliced red onions, greek olives and dressing.  Heaven on a plate!!  Try this steak - you won't be disappointed.

The BEST steak/beef marinade I've ever had. My mom (who doesn't like to cook) asked for the recipe she could hardly contain herself!! I've made it a few different times, and I always add a little bit more whiskey :)

I never write reviews but this recipe was a HUGE hit with guests and family - they loved it.  The left overs weren't around long.  The only change I made was to use good Kentucky bourbon because I didn't have any Irish Whiskey.  I will definitely make this again.

Thank you Alta for sharing this wonderful recipe. I used Bushmills Irish whiskey and marinted the steak for 6 hours.  Only thing I see that might be a problem is that this will be habit forming, thanks again.

Outstanding flavor! I used bourbon, for there was no Irish whiskey in the house, and omitted the rosemary - it tends to overpower. The meat was juicy, flavorful; 
my husband, teenaged son & 10 yo grandson fought for the last piece!

Flat iron steak is a staple in my kitchen but this was the least flavorful marinade I've ever used.  I will not make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This marinade is fantastic!  I let the steak marinate for 2 days then cooked on a gas grill.  I also took the marinade, boiled it with 1/2 an onion sliced, drained the oil and added a packet of brown gravy. It was a nice addition, but really do not think the steak needs it, it is just that tasty!

This is a fabulous marinade! I only used a tablespoon of olive oil -- I'm not at all sure what the remaining amount is supposed to do, as 1 tablespoon is plenty to coat the outside of the meat. I recommend using fresh thyme & rosemary if you can get them, as dried herbs don't always shine in marinades. (This is a good place to use your frozen herbs, if you've got any!) Flatiron steaks are so tender anyway that they hardly require anything extra done to them, but I always love to marinate them anyway -- and this is a great one! Thank you for the recipe :=)

my boyfriend loved it, I thought it was ok.  I trust his judgement given he's a chef and has better knowledge than I do.  I just found it was a little bland.  The peppery taste was nice, but still.... was missing something.

Very, very good. I'd cut back on the Thyme just a bit but other than that I wouldn't change anything. Keep the bottle handy. For regular product quality checks.

This was very good and tender, but that may have been due to the fact that something unexpected came up and the meat wound up marinating for two days.  It was very tasty but next time I will add more whiskey.

This turned out GREAT!  Good flavors, a little spice to it but not too much, a little sweet but not too much.  I also followed others' idea and cooked the marinade into a sauce with some sliced mushrooms and onions (cooked them down first, then added them to the marinade and let it boil for the duration of the steak grilling).  Will have to do this again SOON!

Seemed to be lacking flavor. Too sweet for my taste anyway. I'm not going to bother making it again and changing the recipe.

The first time I ever cooked steak, I used this recipe. They were so magnificent, even my FIL - who is a big food critic :/ - had nothing but good things to say! And the only Irish whiskey I will use is Jameson!

good but nothing that stands out from the rest of the steak marinades ive tried. I used bourbon whiskey because thats what i had. I would probably use this one again.

I'm sure this is more stars had I been able to marinate the steak longer. I used 5 spoonfuls of olive oil, (canadian) whiskey, and soy sauce. I pan-fried for 4 minutes on each side for a medium steak -- delicious!

Rating is for the MARINADE which is excellent, no matter the steak.  But if you cook a flat iron or other similar steak, or even a ribeye or tenderloin --- PLEASE cook it HOT and FAST... and only to medium rare, preferably RARE.  Past that you can just nail it to the bottoms of your shoes because it is going to be tough no matter what you marinate it in or how long.  Just sayin'.  This is from a steak-loving Irish girl!

We loved this!  It does have a distinct whiskey flavor, so be sure that everyone eating is ok with that.   For example, I would not make this for my kids as they would not like the flavor.

I have used this recipe dozens of times and love it!  Use on stew meat for great kabobs and marinate roasts for added flavor and tenderness.

Very good!  I marinaded mine for about 12 hours and the flavors were really good and the meat was not tough.  I grilled fresh pineapple to go with this along with grilling beans.  I also had some fresh mushrooms and onion in the fridge I needed to use up so I boiled the leftover marinade and then cooked with mushrooms and onions. This was a great meal and would make again.

Excellent! I brought this to a St. Patrick's Day party b/c I am not a big fan of Corned Beef.  I too dialed down the oil to 1/3rd cup, and upped the whiskey to about 5 Tbsp.  I also tenderized the steak with a needled tenderizer since I only marinated for about 4 hours. I will definitely make this again!
