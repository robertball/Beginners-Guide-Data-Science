Easy and tasty!  One thing... I assumed from the ingredient list the mustard was to be a jarred type mustard, however the instructions say dry mustard ( mustard powder? ) I certainly wouldn't use 1/2 cup of dry mustard, so I think the instructions are a typo.  I used the jarred kind.  The glaze was yummy, even used on a pre- cooked ham that I just heated and poured the glaze onto.

This was perfect. I doubled the sauce recipe so there would be plenty left over. Everyone loved it. Will make again.

Really good! I used gingerbread kahlua( just sitting in my cabinet getting lonely) and a smaller precooked ham.  The sauce was sweet but the dominant flavor is from the mustard.           I was nervous about taking a chance using my gingerbread kahlua but everyone loved it including my 8 yr old son ( any alcohol gets cooked off). Even better the next day.... try it!
