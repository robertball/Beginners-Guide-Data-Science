pretty good for my first quiche. I made some changes, omitted the mushrooms and added 1/4 cup shredded carrot, 
 I used 4 eggs, sour cream instead of yogurt, about 6 pieces crumbled bacon and a splash of milk. I also switched the cheddar for 5 cheese italian blend. I mixed all the ingredients together before putting it into the crust. It turned out incredible!

Also made a couple changes, but an excellent quiche resulted, so that's what counts! Combined this recipe with "Spinach Quiche" (by Bailey) for a winner. ...Combine 6 strips crumbled bacon, 9oz. fresh spinach (wilted), browned onions & garlic in a 9"crust; top with 1c. cheddar; mix 3 eggs, 1c. yogurt, salt & pepper - pour over spinach; bake 15 min.; top with remaining cheddar; bake 30 min. till done.  YUMMY!

I think that this is a great recipe... though i would encourage people to mix the cheese in with the yogurt mixture so that it spreads throughout the quiche.

It was perfect!! I used fresh spinach (cooked down) and substituted half the yogurt with cottage cheese (for protein). I also added some parmesan cheese. YUM YUM YUM--We wanted to eat the whole pan between just two of us, but managed to restrain ourselves.

This was great tasting and also fairly easy to make. I think it can still use some changes (like additional spices to give it more tang). I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: I made it crustless (it held well and was lower in fat); I used mozarella instead of cheddar cheese; I added a pinch of salt; and I crumbled some feta cheese on top. It came out great, and the leftovers taste good too (hot or cold). Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

Wow, my first experience with shortcrust pastry was a disaster! While prebaking, the sides collapsed (I used spring pan as it's the only one I've got) and the beans I put at the bottom to prevent it from going bubbly managed to mix with the pastry. Took an hour to fish them out. But the quiche turned out lovely! My mate who almost never has seconds is still munching it in the kitchen. I used a small brown onion instead of green onions and saut√©ed it in butter with 3 cloves garlic and mushrooms. I also used half yoghurt half cream and added 2 extra oz of Cheddar cheese to the top 20 minutes before the end.

I thought this made a good quiche. First, I omitted the mushrooms and onions and added tomatoes because I had some left over from another quiche I was making.  And I used reduced-fat sour cream instead of yogurt.  The spinach mixture was so thick that it just sat on top of the rest of the ingredients.  Next time, I will mix all of the ingredients together before putting them in the shell instead of layering them.

A good, light quiche recipe.  I took others' advice and used 1/2 c. yogurt, 1/2 c. sour cream.  Next time I will use fresh, wilted spinach and increase the amount of mushrooms.

The yogurt gave this recipe a sweet/bitter taste.  I chose this because it had fewer calories.  Next time I will use sour cream.  It tastes too low cal. This may be all right if you have never eaten quiche.

This is a great alternative to classic Half and half quiche!  I made it my base and changed up the ingredients.  One was butternut squash and cheddar, one asparagus, ham and Swiss.  I think I will try a crab one next!

It was pretty good for a healthy quiche but not very good for someone wanting a really yummy quiche.  I think I will make it again using this recipe as a base mixing everything together and possibly using crab meat instead of mushrooms.  I think it could be made without the crust to save on calories and fat.

Tonight's dinner ... This is one of my favorite recipes and so EASY, I usually make two at a time. I've served it to company several times to rave reviews. I once had a vegetarian guest who loved so much she ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was all gone. If I owned a B&B this would definitely be on the menu!

This was AMAZING! I substituted small curd cottage cheese for the yogurt and added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I also subbed the mushrooms and added diced green peppers (only b/c my BF doesn't like mushrooms). I lined the pie crust with a thin layer of shredded cheese and the results were incredible. I will definitely be making this again soon!

The taste was very good, but when I followed the suggested baking time, the outer crust became a little harder than I wanted it to be.  The next time I make this, I'll probably reduce the temperature.

Made this one without mushrooms, added extra cheese and sauteed white onion instead of scallions. Turned out great but may try it with sour cream instead of yoghurt, the yoghurt tasted slightly gluey...if that's the right word. Easy to make and good tasting, though.

This was tasty. I also made it without the crust, with an extra egg and it stayed together nicely. I agree that it could use some seasoning. I tried savory but either not enough or it wasn't the right seasoning. I'll definitely fix this again.

I prefer crustless quiches in general, but the recipe I usually use ("zucchinni pie") does not call for spinach, and I had a ton of fresh spinach (and mushrooms, incidentally) from the farmer's market, so I decided to try a spinach quiche recipe. I couldn't find any crustless ones, so I went ahead and made the "Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust," which came out fine, like any other ordinary pie crust. I used my microwave steamer at 2 minutes. It took 3 times filling it up to steam all the 10 oz of spinach, since fresh spinach has such fluffy volume to it, but it came out fine. Except then the recipe says to dry it out with paper towels. I am not rich so I used 6 paper towels and then gave up and dumped the still pretty wet spinach in the mixture. Not completely drying didn't seem to make a difference though, and I didn't notice a "strange" taste due to the yogurt. I did consider using sour cream instead though, since I have been stocking my fridge with it constantly ever since I discovered from the "BREAKSTONE'S Classic Sour Cream-Banana Bread" recipe that it makes any baked good taste deliciously moist! Oh I also added in garlic to the bottom of the dish with the mushrooms and red onion (because I have no scallions), because I LOVE garlic and think it makes a delicious addition to tons of dishes that don't call for it, especially eggs!

I tried this quiche looking for a lower fat option but the yogurt really gave the quiche a strange taste.  I prefer the higher calorie option.

I used cooked fresh spinach and shredded carrots insted of mushrooms. I drained the spinach  and carrots as much as possible. The result came to the fluffy and moist quiche. For using yogurt, it tasted light. I liked it personally though my family said it was OK. Tha's why I give 4 stars.

I've never made a quiche before so I was a little unsure but it turned out great. I used a can of leaf spinach and a can of corn instead of mushrooms. I also added some onion and garlic and a whole bunch of seasinings. When I make it again I most likely will use sour cream instead of yogurt. All in all, a great recipe!

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. Since I'm not a mushroom fan, I substitute broccoli or asparagus and plain or even herb seasoned feta. YUM!

Only the 2nd quiche I've made, but I loved it. Made it again substituting broccoli and cauliflower for the spinach.

I was asked to make a vegetarian quiche for a brunch and found this recipe. I made a couple quick alterations because of ingredients I had handy using 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup heavy cream in place of the yogurt. I used a small diced onion instead of the green onion and mushrooms. I wrapped the edges of the crust in tinfoil to prevent burning. It baked perfectly and was delicious!

Just tried it.  Not enough moisture - the spinach on top dried out.  Next time I'll add a couple more eggs and maybe some milk along with the sour cream instead of yogurt, and maybe bake it at only 350.

Meh, this was okay. I didn't really care for the consistency of the sour-cream and egg mixture, but maybe it'll be better when after it sits in the fridge. I like my quiche to be just a little more dense. Maybe mixing the cheese in with the egg mixture would help.

try this use italian sausage out of skin so its bulk only cheddar cheese low fat 1/2 cup onions, try shredded carrots only if you and family like them they still stay crisp and i can of cream of mushroom, instead of plain mushrooms continue with your recipe must mix that spinich and lowfat yogart together and cheese it really does work . My grandson loved it you will I hope also remember try any other soup it will work also. cook the same amount of time. Good try it.

I'm joining the chorus in praising this recipe. I made my own pie crust and blind baked it in a deep dish pie plate. The filling did not overflow. I used 1/2 cup fat free yogurt and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream, and the baking time was not affected. Other changes: Asiago cheese instead of cheddar, cooked fresh spinach in a pot until it started to dry and stick to the bottom (shy of 1 bunch - added no oil), sauteed the mushrooms with 1 clove garlic, and placed sliced tomatoes over the top (1-2 small tomatoes), 3 eggs plus 1 egg white (used the yolk to glaze the crust). This was my first time baking a quiche ever, and I brought it to an Oscar's party. Everyone complimented me on both its appearance and taste. A very trustworthy recipe.

This was really tasty! I accidently used 3 eggs instead of 2, and I used about 1/3 c of sour cream, the rest yogurt. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so used a small can of them and I substituted red onions for the chopped green onions. Lots of substitutions, and it was still excellent!

Made this last night.  Liked the flavor very much, but it was a little dry.  I added hot sauce to the eggs.  It could have used some salt.  Will probably make again.

Wonderful quiche! I used low fat yogert and a whole wheat crust, very yummy.  We were fighting over the last piece. Next time I'll add a bit of salt.

WOW! I thought this recipe was GREAT!!  It tasted like a something you would get in an expensive cafe. My husband, 4 year old and extremely picky 1 year old ate it.  I should have made 2.  I did a few things differently...added one more egg and used 3/4 cup yogurt and 1/4 cup milk (really had no reason, just thought I would do it)no mushrooms and accidentally used 2 TBS flour. BUT it was the best quiche I have ever made.  This will be replacing my old recipe!  Thanks for the post.

Delicious!  I used fat-free sour cream.  I also added 2 more eggs.  It required cooking 15 minutes longer, but came out perfect!  I recommend Pillsbury ready pie crust.

I love how versatile this recipe is. I usually change up the vegetable ingredients every time i make this & it always turns out great. This time i substituted the mushrooms for broccoli & added fresh diced tomato to the egg mixture (took out most of the seeded part because of how much water that would add). Also, since i didn't have scallions, i used green bell pepper & sweet yellow onion in its place. Feta instead of cheddar & sprinkled some granulated garlic on top when turning the oven down to 350*. Healthy & delicious!

Delicious!  I omit mushrooms (I love, kids don't) and add a little salt and ground nutmeg.  About 10 minutes before oven time is up, I cover edges  with foil to prevent over-browning.  I love this with full-fat greek yogurt--but works with 2% as well.

I used the recipe as a foundation, but heavily adapted it to what I had in the kitchen. I used 5 eggs, 1/2 cup of homemade whole milk yogurt and about 1/2 c. Whole milk.  Then I decreased the spinach to 1 cup frozen, thawed so I could add more mushrooms, leeks,garlic, and asparagus. I saut√©ed all the veggies separately first to intensify the flavors, then mixed them together and kept them warm. 

 To avoid gluten, I made this in a cast iron skillet and put a layer of very thinly sliced raw potato in place of the crust, which I had go up the sides of the very hot skillet, and then seasoned. I used a mixture of cheddar, meunster, and mozzarella over the potatoes, layered in the saut√©ed veggies, and then poured the egg mixture over all that. I added one finely diced plum tomato on top for color, and with the iron skillet still very hot from saut√©ing, I put it in the oven and followed the author's cooking instructions. Despite using a much larger deep skillet (mine was 11" diameter and about 4" deep) it cooked perfectly.  
Oh, I also used 2 tbsp gluten free flour in the egg mixture. Worked like a charm.

Made this according to the recipe and it turned out great! With pre-prepared pie crust it was easy enough for a weeknight meal.

I love the idea of using yogurt instead of cream or half-n-half.  It gives the quiche a tangy taste; have used it alot and shared to many of my vegetarian friends.

I definitely screwed up somewhere. This one didn't turn out so well. I made it with yogurt, but didn't know how to cut the yogurt tang that I suspected it would have. I tried adding garlic powder, black pepper, chili powder, and curry. The curry was a mistake. UGH! 

I also didn't drain the frozen spinach after thawing it (I didn't want to lose the vitamins, but the quiche came out solid). And I didn't have any mushrooms or cheddar cheese. But I did have some parmesan cheese mix that I sprinkled on top. I didn't have the green onions either, so I subbed a quarter cup of red onion. 

I'll definitely try it again, as the other reviewers seemed to like it. And definitely will leave out the curry!
