This recipe is really easy to cook, it takes 30 minutes in doing everything and it is creamy and soft. I really recommended if you are in a hurry and want something fine to eat.

My husband and I really liked this soup! Instead of bread, I threw some homemade garlic croutons in with the parmesan - very delicious!

Awesome! I could tell the seasoning wouldn't be enough as written so I added a cube of beef boullion. Best comfort food ever...

This is a good base soup, but it needs a bit of help in the seasoning department. First, I added garlic powder to the onions. Second, I don't do raw eggs, so, when I added the yolk mixture, I turned the heat up a little more, constantly stirred for about 8 more minutes. I added a little sea salt, lots of ground pepper and a heaping 1/4 tsp of allspice. After the soup was in bowls, I added shredded cheese and grated parmesan. My hubby & I found this to be tasty. I will make this again.

Excellent low-fat alternative to the heavy cream-based soups.  I found it a little bland, however, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice, which gave it an interesting flavor.

Needed a recipe to replace store bought cream of onion soup (since I didn't have any) for scalloped potato and pork chop casserole.  Worked wonderfully!  Wasn't sure how to cut onion since recipe didn't state so I just diced them, making it harder for my kids to pick them out of the casserole!

I was concerned with taste after reading some comments. I ended up altering the recipe as follows: After sauteing the onions and adding the milk as directed, I simmered the soup for 10 min, stirring occasionally. At the 10 minute mark, I added seasoning, half a tsp of minced garlic, and the beat egg mixture, then simmered for 10 more minutes, Stirring occasionally. I'll have to try this with the parmesan cheese topping because I didn't have any on hand tonight.  With my modifications, A hit with the family!

I did not care for this recipe. It tasted like flour. Bland. Maybe it was something I did but I am pretty sure I followed the recipe exactly.

i liked this recipe alot although I agree its a bit bland. its really a good soup for a cold day :-) I just add a little more salt and serve it with parmesan toast on top, sort of how you'd do with french onion soup. (put the soup in crocks, w/toasted sourdough slices on top, sprinkle with coursely grated parmesan and stick it under the broiler).

This sounded interesting so we gave it a shot.  Not sure that we'll do this again, though.  ha!  Note that this is VERY BLAND.  We had never eaten a milk-based onion soup.  Like many of you, I'm sure, our family is more familiar with the Lipton variety!  But we enjoy exploring the recipes on the site and we like trying new things....

Overall, this recipe lacks spice.  Adding more salt and pepper helped but it was still, by no means, a savory soup.  Any advice in this area would be appreciated!  

Personally, I didn't finish my bowl...I moved on to the main course.  My family, however, did finish their helpings  (I can't help but feel that they were simply being polite!)

For my taste, this is a wonderful idea that didn't score high in this Southern household.  I would recommend to keep looking for another soup unless you enjoy experimenting.  If you do go forth, make sure you have other options on hand!  ha!
