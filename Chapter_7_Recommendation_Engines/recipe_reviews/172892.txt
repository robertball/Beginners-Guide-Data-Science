Made this for a holiday dinner serving it in large martini glasses and it was spectacular.  I just put a few torn spinach leaves in the bottom then added the mozzarella/tomato mixture.  I added a dash of the oil mix that was left and put a basil leaf on the side for garnish. It was very festive with the red and green.  A very elegant start to a holiday dinner party.

Delish!  easy recipe to double or triple for a potluck.  I add extra garlic.  It is a big hit, and the best part about it is that it's heart healthy!

I made this for a potluck and it turned out very nice.  I received many compliments on it.  I added pine nuts just before serving.  The lemon dressing was great!
