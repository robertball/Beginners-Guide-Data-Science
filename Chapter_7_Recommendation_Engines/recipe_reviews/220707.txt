Using a boxed cake mix and a cupcake corer made this soooo easy.  Switch out the cake mix flavor and jams (or maybe with lemon curd) for a totally different cupcake.  Perhaps dip the top of the cupcake into some melted butter and then into a cinnamon-sugar mixture for another version.  Thanks Mermaid Smoothie for a simple recipe with lots of options.

I've made these before in non-stick MINI muffin pans. I didn't need paper liners.  I put 1/2 batter, then about 1/2 tsp different jams and/or lemon curd, then batter. I sprinkled them with granulated sugar, then baked them.  My family loved them!

These are easy to make, pretty to look at, and delicious.  Good for potluck dinners.  PS: I used my strawberry huller to take out the middle part; it works like a charm.

This is such a great recipe!!  So good and so easy!!  I made half  with my homemade apricot jam and half w/cherry pie filling that I put in my food processor.  I also didn't want to throw away the "plugs" of cake so I put those on a sheet pan and put it in the oven for a few minutes and crumbled them on top - SUPER YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe and will definitely be making them again.  The possible combinations are endless!

These are delicious! 5 stars were given to this by friends we shared these with.
They are a great "muffin donut" with huge flavor and so easy to make.
I made a glaze and drizzled it over the top.

These didn't send me "over the moon," but they were good, pretty, and easy.

Also, I've been prescribed a gluten-free diet, and it was easy to make this gluten-free by substituting GF cake mix. I often find these cake mixes come out dry and grainy, but in the case of this recipe, I think the pudding moistened and smoothed out the  batter nicely. 

I used the idea of some of the people who commented here, filling each cup 1/3 full with batter, scooping in a spoonful of preserves, and covering the preserves with more batter, filling the cup to about 2/3 full.

I didn't have paper or foil baking cups that day, so I sprayed the cups of the pan liberally with cooking spray and then brushed the insides with vegetable oil. When the cupcakes were done, I flipped the pan and the cupcakes fell right out. This caused the preserves to break through the top of a few cupcakes, so next time I'll hold a baking sheet over the cupcake pan before flipping it, so the cupcakes don't have as far to fall.

These cupcakes were very easy to make and pretty good. I was hoping they'd taste a bit more like donuts, but they just tasted like cake.

Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing!

These are really delicious. The only change I made was to use buttermilk in place of the whole milk. Presentation means a lot to me. I like the fruit jam showing in the middle of the cupcake vs. others who used the layering effect. If you change your jam types, you can also see what the filling is at a glimpse. (The little plugs that you pull out of the cupcakes are surely a nice treat for the baker. No one will ever know!!!!)  I will definitely make these again.

This was a fun recipe, made a beautiful presentation, was easy to prepare, delicious but on the cusp of being too sweet.  The raspberry jam helped to counteract the sweetness so it was quite pleasing.  I used a melon baller  and that seemed to work well.  The jam does stain the cake after a day  so for appearance sake only, best eaten same day.  Otherwise lasts a good couple of days.

Made it exactly like the recipe. Used a hollow corer to make a 1” deep hole and filled with a baby spoon the fruit preserves. Not sure why you need to spray PAM plus use cupcake papers. The papers soaked up the Pam and became greasy. I had to line a carry container with 2 layers of paper towels to soak up the oil. Nobody complained but I will try it without the spray next time. They were well received and enjoyed!

Delicious and very easy to make.

Try it using Lemon cake mix and a quick and easy blueberry jam with lemon zest.  Amazing!

Good cupcakes. For some reason the ones in my silicone pan came  out as flat as pancakes but the ones in my metal  pan rose nicely. They are very sweet and could be eaten without the jelly or any icing and still be good. Filled the cups about 3/4 full and made 17 cupcakes.

These were fantastic!!!  I will for sure be making these for holiday desserts. The only thing different I did was used homemade raspberry jelly with seeds. My daughter made it and was a perfect match. Next try will be with homemade apple jelly and fireweed jelly. Thank you for the great recipe.
