I submitted this recipe with a slight mistake.  1 tsp. of almond extract might be too strong, so I suggest cutting it down to a 1/2 a tsp.  Thanks

This recipe is delicious!  I used Dannon cherry yogurt and absolutely loved it.  Tried it without the banana and using Breyer's light vanilla ice cream and 2% instead of the half and half, and that was excellent too.  This will be a favorite in my kitchen from now on.

Really, really good smoothie. Orange-cherry-almond flavor. Better than Orange Julius makes but I never liked them that much anyway.

What a nice flavor!- A little too fatty for me, so  I did change a couple things- I used Fat Free yogurt and instead of half & half used 1/4 cup FF whipped topping- still thick and delicious!

Not enough flavor!!!  All you could really taste was almond extract.

This is definitely our favorite - voted #1 by all my children.  I did take into account the 1/2 teaspon of almond extract.  I added a frozen banana and a little more ice to make it a little thicker for our tastes.  We've already shared this recipe with our friends.  Definitely a keeper!

This was just okay. My kids drank it, but weren't overenthused.

I made this with strawberry yogurt as I couldn't find cherry. I liked the almond taste but wasn't crazy about using canned mandarins (the flavor was just ok for us; a little too subtle). I'll make this again when Colorado peaches are in season.

I love the taste of almond, so i excitedly went out and bought each ingredient to this smoothie, and unfortunately it was a complete letdown.  I made it for 2 friends and they wouldn't even finish theirs!  I tasted mostly the banana and the consistency was lacking that smoothie feel.

This was good.  I forgot to only add 1/2 the almond extract as suggested by the recipe submitter. and one whole tsp was a little too much.  Still good and will make again

Hey Josie girl!! Loved your smoothie and the fact that the oranges gave it a nice twist. Used raspberry yogurt with this and left out the half and half. Miss you three clowns and thanks for a wonderful breakfast treat! Love, Lin

It was ok. My husband drank it but when asked if he'd have it again, he said he'd rather not.

Good, but I would like more cherry flavor and less orange.
