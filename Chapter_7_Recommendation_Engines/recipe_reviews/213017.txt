Made this today and it was very good.  I was a surpise at the great flavor.  I would recommend adding a few veggies like carrots or celery.  And I did add a little seasoning salt, cracked black pepper and a small amount of ketchup.  Very good, will make again

This is extra easy and very flavorful & filling! The perfect Super Bowl food--start this in the morning and by game time--it will be ready!! I only made a few changes. I used 16 oz of frozen black eyed peas because that is what I had and used one can of white kidney( cannellini) beans instead of garbanzo, again because that is what I had on hand. I didn't drain any of the canned beans.I also diced up 4 carrots and 3 ribs of celery and sauteed them with the onion and garlic--which I increased to 4 cloves. I also added 6 slices of browned and crumbled bacon with a few tsp. of the drippings to the stew plus 1 tsp. of chili powder and some fresh ground black peper. The ham & the bacon added enough salt. It simmered all day on low and was perfect for supper with the sweet cornbread recipe ( found on this site) and cole slaw. Even my VERY picky 10 year old daughter loved this stew. My parents happened to stop by,& since this makes plenty, they stayed and enjoyed it too!! My dad said this is the best bean soup he'd ever had so my mom took the recipe home! Hard to believe something so simple made with common ingredients could be this tasty! For a little extra kick--some of us added a few shakes of green jalapeno hot sauce. This is a winner--just like the Indy Colts!!

I really liked this recipe and it was super easy. Before putting all the ingredients into the slow cooker, I sauteed the onion and about 1 tsp of minced garlic until the onions were transparent, then I added finely chopped celery.  I also added chili powder, cumin, and chipotle chili powder to taste.

The first time that I made this recipe was last winter when I needed to use up some leftover ham.  I loved it then, but somehow didn't save it to my recipe box.  I am happy to find it again and can't wait to make it soon.  I followed the recipe exactly...the dollop of sour cream takes this soup over the top!!!

Sorry, I just was not that impressed. Tasted pretty much like some canned beans and ham, even though I added in 1/3 cup ketchup, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/4 tsp season salt. And I so love using my crock pot; really wanted it to be wonderful.

My husband and I love this receipe!!!  Our children said, "What is that smell and do we have to eat it."  Last time I made it, I cooked the carrots in a butter/brown sugar mixture before adding them in.  I sauted the onions and celery together, and put in some whole peppercorns.  I like this because it is so easy and and husband pleasing!!

I added chili powder and cumin. Surprisingly had a really great taste considering there are so few ingredients. Would be awesome with some veggies and will try with ketchup like previous comment.

Loved the taste and the texture.  I added carrots as suggested by others and also some vegetable stock.  I did not use the slow cooker but put the pot into the oven instead until it is bubbling hot at about 180 degrees. Healthy dish as I also served it with black rice.  My husband loved it and finished the whole pot.

Tastes more like soup than stew.  Mine came out watery. Had to drain out most of the liquid.  Made great veggie burritos.  Wouldn't eat it any other way.

Quick and easy.  I followed the advice of others and added carrots, celery and onion.  Also chopped up a jalepeno pepper.  Seasoned with cumin and a little chili powder.  It seemed a little dry, so I added a cup of beef bullion thickened with a tablespoon of flour.  Delish!  Will definitely make again!

Easy, delicious, and makes enough for 6-8 people...great way to use leftover ham.  I used black-eyed peas, pinto beans, and Great Northern beans, sauteed chopped onion, garlic, and celery in hot oil before adding it to the pot.  I also used a seasoning salt.  The flavor was great and I even forgot to dollop some sour cream on it.  Served with buttermilk cornbread.

I didn't like the syrupy can juices from the beans, found it unpleasant eating this just as a stew. Eating the leftovers over brown rice helped a lot. Also, I thought it needed more spices, and added chili powder, cumin and a lot of black pepper. Glad I did. I added some chopped bacon, but I'll skip that next time. It becomes chewy after being the slow cooker. Maybe could top with the bacon after it's done. I do really like this bean and ham combination. So, next time I will drain the beans (except the chili beans of course) and make some other kind of gravy thing. Not sure what yet. Hot peppers and/or bell peppers would be great in this. This would also be good as a soup, with chicken stock and some dark leafy green like kale.

My whole family really enjoyed this soup. I used smoked ham to give it some added flavor, and threw in a handful of fresh spinach leaves for color and extra tang. Will use again! Thanks!

I added some carrots and celery. I also used Great Northern beans instead of Garbanzo Beans. I added some chili powder and cumin as others had suggested, but even without draining the cans of beans it seemed to not have enough liquid for the slow cooker, so I added some water just to give it more liquid. This is really flavorful. Its not at all like a plain bean and ham soup. It is really good, and makes A LOT for leftovers. :)

My entire family loved this bean dish. I added canned tomatoes but left off the green bell pepper I saw in the photo.

Super easy, had most things in the pantry. Did not have black eyed peas so substituted navy beans, drained the liquid from chickpeas into a dish & ended using about a cup to add so it wasn’t crazy thick. Once cooked added salt, pepper & a little cayenne pepper for a little bite... OMG fabulous, will be making again for sure.
