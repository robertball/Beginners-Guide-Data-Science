This was pretty good but could be stepped up a notch.  The quantity of the vinegar is so small that it doesn't seem to really help the flavor, it was instead lost-next time I will cut out the water and use all champagne vinegar instead.  I think sweet onion would be a nice addition to the flavors, too.  Update: This is just fabulous with the addition of a little minced red onion and by omitting the sugar.

So yummy! I was short on time and ingredients, so substituted craisins for dried cherries, walnuts for almonds and red wine vinegar for champagne vinegar. I also didn't have poppy seeds. However was very easy and quick to make (made 1 hour before a potluck). I will definitely be making this again!!!!!

I used Greek yogurt instead of mayo, and agave nectar instead of confectioners sugar. I also added red grapes. Great recipe!

Very good recipe - will definitely make again.  Used what I had on hand and needed to use up; added 1 yellow pepper and a small red onion.  Didn't have almonds so used pecans.  Used 3 T red wine vinegar instead of the 2 T water & 1 T. champagne vinegar.  Didn't have poppy seed as well.  Will make again.

This was so delicious.  I used some left over chicken from the night before, so it was incredibly simple to make.  I had many, many compliments.

I had high hopes for this salad, but even after modifying the dressing to include 2T champagne vinegar and only 1T water, as one reviewer suggested, the dressing was bland.

Made this today, only substitution was rice vinegar instead of champagne vinegar since I didn't have it. Also, cooked up a chicken breast to add rather than using frozen chicken (don't like the over processed frozen stuff). Even my vegetarian daughter who was sure it wasn't going to be good...she thought it would be a 2 at best "with all the weird stuff" I was putting in it. Well, she had to have her own separate bowl (sans chicken of course), and gave it a 5!
