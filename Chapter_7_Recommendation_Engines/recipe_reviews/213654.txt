This is a quick, easy and very tasty dish. I only gave it 4 stars because I had to add a lot more lemon juice and wine. The liquid cooked down really fast so I used a total of 3 tbl wine & 3 tbl lemon juice. Just kept the ratio equal. Just know that you can't add the extra liquid until later or the chicken won't brown it will steam. If it is too thin, add another tbl of butter to thicken or resv one of the tbls the recipe calls for until you add the extra liquid. I used 1 Tbl fresh parsley because I had it on hand. I did use 2 cups of mushrooms per the suggestion. I have been looking for a new simple but tasty chicken recipe and this is it! Thank you Grneyedmustang; this must be the next best thing to being in your kitchen :)

I made a few modifcations - onion instead of garlic, subbed olive oil for butter and upped the cooking wine and mushrooms.  It was exactly what I wanted.  Light and tastey and perfect for spring.

Very nice Italian-ish recipe.  I lessened the cholesterol by 60 mg by using only 1 tblsp butter and 4 tblsp olive oil.  Also took 130 calories off the total by using only one chicken breast and cutting it into bite-sized pieces.  And, for personal preference, I browned the chicken in the skillet then added the liquid after the browning was complete.  Otherwise, no changes in ingredients - served with angelhair pasta and some good parmesan and a lot of pepper.  Next time, I will add onion.  Very good, grneyedmustang - thanks so much!

This is a very tasty dish, however anytime I see lemon butter and white wine I usually add capers. Will definitely do this again.

Five stars, ten if I could!  Didn't change a single thing the first time...the second time I substituted broccoli for the asparagus because that's what I had on hand...equally as delicious...thank you for sharing.

I liked the flavors very much and the combination of ingredients (I just happened to have mushrooms, asparagus, and chicken breasts on hand so was looking for a recipe to combine them). It ended up way too dry and too watery. I browned the chicken first in the oil/butter because I couldn't understand how you can brown chicken in liquid as stated in the recipe. Then cooking the chicken with the vegetables resulted in very dry chicken.

I will try this again with the following changes:
* saute chicken and remove from pan
* saute vegetables and remove from pan
* make sauce and reduce to one half
* add back chicken and vegetable to rewarm

Maybe those who gave this a not so shining review- don't like to eat healthy. Honestly as written- it's 4.5, it could use a little more zip- fine. That isn't hard to do.
I have made this as written and a little doctored. The best part is you can tailor this to  your pantry.

I have a Diabetic child and a husband who loves low to no carb and this dish fit the bill. 
We love it around here. My children both love veggies and this is so easy. 

I generally make it with Asparagus, Colored Bell Peppers, Vidalia's, sometimes mushrooms. I leave the wine out and use Chicken Broth. I can't drink white wine. :( But we don't miss it. 

This is such a beautiful presentation and so easy to do. We love crisp veggie's so I saute them only a bit.
It's such a vibrant and colorful dish- the flavors are amazing. It's delicate- even more delicate if you use fresh herbs. It's also so good for you.
I serve it with Jasmine or Brown Rice- you could do garlic pasta. I don't usually double my sauce though- I don't think it's supposed to be saucy though the sauce is great and flavorful. Fresh lemon juice makes it. 

I will make this again and again- it's a great dish.
Thanks for sharing.

This dish was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning to keep it light.  I made it without the wine however (non on hand) and just topped with some parmesan cheese.  Will keep this one!

Great recipe, I only made one change - used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, which made the chicken more moist. This would have been fantastic with cashews.

Really enjoyed this! I did not use butter and only 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Cooked the chicken with the asparagus (16 oz) and garlic. Added the seasonings (also added herbs de provence )as well as some chopped sun dried tomatoes. Added about 1/2 cup of wine and a small lemon after cooking about 5 minutes. I also sauteed the mushrooms separtely and added them after the wine and lemon. Last few minutes added about 1 oz of goat cheese and some shredded asiago. It was delicious! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great, easy weeknight meal!  Even my picky 3-year old had seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great, but I think that next time I will add onions, snow peas, and red peppers as another reviewer suggested.

Excellent! I doubled the herbs and added a little thyme, added some fresh ground black pepper and I had no lemons so I just doubled the wine (I think...I didn't really measure!) I also used leftover cooked chicken so I added that last, just to heat through. Served over whole grain pasta - simple and delicious!

I doubled the recipe to serve 4 and followed it as written.  The chicken poached in so much liquid and the big slices didn't look appetizing.  It also cooked through much faster than the recipe indicated.  The flavor was good and was liked by all but our picky eater.  I'll try it again but adjust as some others suggested, and I'll slice the chicken in small (think Chinese) strips.

This is a very good recipe!  I did, however, make a few changes and hope this will be helpful to everyone.  I did not have asparagus, so I used zucchini (about 2 cups) cut into half inch chunks.  I also increased the lemon juice and wine to 2 tablespoons each, and I doubled the herbs (parsley, basil, oregano).  This goes very well with rice.

Great Recipe!!! The changes I made were doubling the butter and olive oil and since I an an ex smoker, double the spices ( taste buds are slowly coming back). I have been looking for a good asparagus recipe for my girlfriend to taste,, since she has never tried asparagus before and this is it!!! thanks again

This was delicious!  I added a little more white wine and lemon for more sauce as one reviewer said, and took away a tsp. of butter and replaced it with olive oil.  I also added more asparagus to it and a bit more salt.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Made the whole house smell delicious.

I was pretty disappointed with this meal.  It may just be my picky tastebuds!  I made this exactly to the directions, but had to cover the skillet for the asparagus so it could steam cook b/c it was too hard.  I am a person who loves flavor & this recipe was too bland.

My husband really liked this, but it didn't particularly appeal to me as much, I don't know why. Second attempt I doubled all the spices (not the butter and olive oil), plus added 3T of white wine and lemon juice.  I added red pepper and steamed the asparagus separately; this all improved the taste and look.

Really delicious.  Used 2 tbs cooking wine rather than the amt suggested to make it even with olive oil.  Flavor was fantastic.  Might do it with just the vegetables next time or at least less chicken. Also--more mushrooms!  Cannot get enough of the veggies!  Served over linguine.

This was excellent! The only change I made was that I was (gasp!) out of olive oil, so I used lemon olive oil that I happened to have from a stocking stuffer.  I actually think that improved the dish. Between than and the lemon juice, it had a wonderful light citrus flavor. I, too browned the chicken in the olive oil and butter first to brown them. I also removed the chicken while the spices, garlic and vegetable cooked, then I put the chicken back in and covered the dish and removed it from heat and let the flavors soak into the chicken. I served it with salad and egg noodles. Very yummy! I'll be keeping this one in my arsenal.

This was very nice.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a bit more liquid, both lemon juice and wine.  Next time I think I would cook the mushrooms separately in butter so that they brown a bit.

The recipe sounded so good, but it turned out really bland.  I followed it exactly & ended up having to add a lot more spices & salt.  Even with that it wasn't all that great.

Only acceptable if you like a very bland meal.  Needs too much doctoring up to be the same recipe.  The mushrooms, asparagus, and chicken are a good start but needs much more flavor umph.

Very good! I omitted the butter and found that I needed more liquid during the cooking process, so I added a little more wine. Served over brown rice. Thanks :)

I used leftover pork tenderloin and fresh herbs but otherwise followed directions.  I think asparagus should cook 6 or more minutes before adding shrooms.

Have made this several times the good thing about this dish is you can add what ever else you want as long as you keep the main ingredients.Try adding red onion and different colored peppers. We just love it over rice!!!!!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I needed to use up the asparagus and mushrooms I had.  Changes I made (only because it's what I had on hand): I subbed the wine for chicken broth, and margarine for butter.

I substituted green beans for asparagus and added 3 minutes to cooking time.  I also added 1/4 cup of white wine at the very end to deglaze the pan.  It was wonderful!  Husband and kids loved it.

I love all the ingredients.  This dish was flavorful!  Cooking the vegetables at the end added more liqued to the sauce for those who rated that there wasn't much liqued to the sauce.  My chicken pieces were too thick, next time I will look for smaller pieces, pound the chicken, or slice.  This will make for  tender chicken. Will try again!

such a good simple recipe.. i only used 1.5 T of butter and nixed the olive oil.. used 3/4 t of italian seasoning in place of the herbs.. upped the garlic cloves to 3 and crushed them.. upped the lemon juice to 2 T and used 2 T of chicken broth b/c i didn't have any wine :( .. waited until the chicken browned a bit before adding the lemon juice and broth.. then continued on with the recipe.. i used what i had on hand.. which was about 6 oz of cut up chicken breast, 1/4 lb of white and green asparagus combined, and about 1 1/4 c of sliced mushrooms.. i'd love to try the recipe with the wine so there will definitely be a next time.. ty so much for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: 
this time i stuck to the recipe more than the first time i made this.. i adjusted the servings to 3 (my math) and used some marsala cooking wine for the white.. added a little more salt and used about 1.5 T margarine total for the butter/olive oil mixture.. otherwise i followed the measurements.. served this with Simmered Italian Rice (with my modifications).. so good! ty again for the recipe

We LOVED this!!! Had some chicken, mushrooms and asparagus to use up and this was perfect! I followed some others lead and melt the butter with the olive oil, add the herbs then the chicken, allow to brown on both sides then add the sauce and veggies. We will definitely make this again and again, part of the regular rotation. I served mine with cheese filled tortellini and it was spectacular! This is one of those dishes you should make extra of, the leftovers will be fought over! I did 2oz. each of white wine and lemon juice, 3 chicken breasts, 1 package mushrooms, 1 bunch asparagus, served over 1 bag (frozen) cooked tortellini with some parmesan cheese at the table. Absolutely amazing! A local restaurant has pasta night every Thurs. and is all you can eat pasta made with your choice of meat, sauce, veggies this may keep us home Thurs. nights from now on! Thank you for sharing grneyedmustang!!!

What a great starter recipe!  Can't give it a 5 star because I didn't have exactly these ingredients.  I used the fresh herbs I had available which were basil, rosemary and oregano.  Didn't have fresh asparagus or mushrooms, so used canned.  Smelled fabulous cooking!  I served over gnocchi, with a salad dressed with red wine vinegar and garlic infused olive oil.  It felt like we were right back in Italy!

Very flavorful! I added in 1/2 small onion, doubled the oregano to 1/4 tsp, and increased the cooking wine and lemon juice a little. With those few changes, I will be making this often.

This dish is so easy and so tasty.  I used 'No Salt - Zesty Blend' which had all the spices and added a pinch of extra basil.  Fabulous!  I've already made it twice and cooking again tonight for me and hubby. Hope there are leftovers; it's even better the second day!

I LOVED this recipe! I used margarine added a bit more wine and used the left over lemon I had to squeeze it over the pasta as I ate it but it was fabulous. The chicken turned out perfect and I drank a beautiful Chardonnay with it. I will probably scale back the  margarine and olive oil next time I make it so it will be a little less fatty but it was wonderful and would recommend it to anyone!

This has an amazing amount of flavor for such simple ingrediants.   Fresh basil made this pop, and I loved that it was a perfect 2 (generous) portions -- no leftovers on this one!  This is now on our regular menu -- really simple to make, but tastes elegant!

All I have to say is YUMMY! Can't wait to make it again! I served it with spaghetti w olive oil and garlic and it was perfect! Hubby and kids loved it to. I added a little of the wine and lemon juice toward the end, and used broccoli instead of asparagus. It is super easy!

I found the asparagus not cooked enough with that alloted time and it was still really dry.  Although I do not believe this was suppose to be a recipe that yielded a sauce base.  Also do not try to make the chicken and a whole breast, I did and that burned the seasoning.  The mushrooms saved the day.

Yum! This was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly other than adding a little extra garlic and mushrooms.  Served over angel hair pasta and topped with good shredded parmesan.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent dish!  Very flavorful, while really easy to make.  Went with other reviewers' suggestion and added 3T of lemon juice and 3T of white wine.  Next time I will also double the asparagus and mushrooms.

Definitely an easy and yummy recipe. Needs WAY more liquid (lemon juice/olive oil) like other posters have suggested. I think way more asparagus too.

Very disappointed after having high hopes for this recipe. The mixture just didn't appeal to me.

This is fine if you like light seasonings.  It was too bland for us, though.

This is an excellent dish.  I browned my boneless skinless thighs before adding the oil and butter.  i also added the onions others have suggested.  We loved everything about is and will definitely make again.  It was necessary to double the "sauce".

I just used fresh herbs instead of dried.  Served over whole wheat bow tie pasta coated in a little olive oil and balsamic and fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano. Big hit. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband cooked this for supper tonight... SOO YUMMMY!! I couldn't stop eating it! One change we would make it to try it next time with less butter. It was a bit oily. He also said that he kept adding lemon juice as the liquid in the pan dried up. Excellent flavour... my children also devoured it (3 yrs and 1 yr). Thanks for the recipe, we'll be making this one again!!!

Delicious! I realized at the last minute that the mushrooms I had were past their prime, so I had to substitute a bag of frozen stir fry veggies. I had to add a few dashes of salt & pepper to this dish. I used double the wine & lemon juice. The liquid was all was absorbed by the time the dish was done. I also used only 1 tbsp. butter to cut down on some fat. Delicious when served over jasmine rice! Will try again with mushrooms :)

Delicious!!  I followed the advice of others and doubled the amt of sauce with a little less butter and more EVOO -- note that the original recipe is for 2 servings -- and it was perfect!  The only other change I made was to add parmesan cheese at the end, right before serving over egg noodles.  Thank you so much for an easy, healthy dish!!  :)

After just beginning a low sodium diet for my husband, this one was a winner in taste.  I cooked the chicken in the oil with the spices and garlic for the recommended 10 minutes.  Then added the butter, lemon juice, and a little extra wine (I like wine!)  when cooking the vegetables.  Served over pasta, it was very tasty.  I was given the "go" to make it again.

Sorry guys...I love all the ingredients but all we could taste was the asparagus.  It just didn't have any "zip" at all.  I added onion and a little extra wine to it also.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Made this for Sunday dinner and boy, did this go over big! The only thing I added was fresh zucchini cut in chunks because I had it and wanted to use it before it went bad.  Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. Wonderful recipe!

I followed the ingredients but changed the method. I sauted the mushrooms in EVOO and then put them in a bowl. Then sauted the asparagus in EVOO for a few minutes and added in the bowl with the mushrooms. I then took the remaining ingredients, whisked them together and poured into the warm skillet. I added about 1/2-3/4 cup of extra broth. Once heated thru I added cooked rotisserie chicken and the mushrooms and asparagus and folded them in and heated for a couple minutes. Served over cooked brown rice. Superb!!

I absolutely loved this and so did my family. I made it exactly as the recipe stated the first time and it was great. The second time I added quartered baby carrots and a little more wine. I also cubed the chicken breast so it was more of a stir fry. I think it would be good with any veggies. Will definitely be making this over and over again. .

Delicious and easy dinner. It looked beautiful. It was a little greasy so I'll probably experiment with the butter and oil to make it a little healthier, as others have advised.

This is a good basic start for a meal. It has just enough flavor but there is nothing extraordinary about it. However, it allows for a lot of versatility. I look forward to playing with this one and putting my own little twists on it.

This was easy to make, even with kids running around my feet. I didn't have lemon juice and ended up substituting for orange juice. I was worried it wouldn't turn out, but it ended up being amazing. Put it on top of butter noodles. Amazing!

this was fairly easy and very good!! I added just a little more lemon juice, wine and an extra pat of butter to make just enough “sauce” to coat the angel hair pasta I served it with. I topped it with fresh ground black pepper and a little parmesan to finish. I did blanch the asparagus for 3 minutes before adding to the skillet to avoid overcooking the chicken while the asparagus cooked. I would recommend doing this if you do not care for crisp asparagus. great recipe that also provides for the addition of any veggies you like – I think I’ll try it with broccoli next time as another reviewer suggested!

Yummy! Increased the olive oil just a little and didn't use butter. Added extra wine and lemon juice-about 3 Tbls each. Pounded chicken tenders to tenderize. Turned out restaurant quality! Thank you for a delightful recipe!

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!!  I can't wait to make it again.  I didn't have wine so just used water and it was perfect!  I would add more veggies if i had them on hand, you can use so many variations for this one.  I also had fresh oregano and basil so I used it. I wish I took a picture because it was beautiful.  I also am cutting back on my salt intake so I omitted it and my husband said if I didn't tell him that i didn't use salt he would have never known.  Did sprinkle with Parm cheese.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will, however, add more wine and lemon juice next time.  The men had it over pasta.  I had it over spaghetti squash.  Yum!

This is delicious.  I think you have to increase the wine/lemon juice and I put in 3 tbsp of each.  I ended up adding a bit of extra wine also.  Lots of great flavor.

I'm giving the basic recipe 2 stars because it was too bland for my taste.  If you like a pop of flavor be prepared to ad lib on the seasoning.  To get more sauce, I used 1/4 cup wine and at least 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I added substantially more herbs, crushed red pepper plus a tablespoon of a garlic & Parmesan seasoning mix I had in the cupboard to bring out some flavor.  Served it over whole wheat pasta.

One of my favorite chicken recipes ever!  It was so yummy, even without the asparagus it would be good although I loved the asparagus. I highly recommend young thinner stalks. I don't use wine and usually substitute chicken broth instead. It worked great! I would add more mushrooms next time.

This was so great! Doubled the sauce as other reviewers recommended and used some thyme instead of parsley as I was out. Served it over wild rice pilaf, and DH and DS both really loved it!

Delicious flavors. I've never had my chicken turn out so well. Also didn't have a problem with the sauce drying up in the pan like I usually do.

Pretty easy and yummy. I'm giving it a 4 because the chicken was dry...probably my own mistake. I will make thsi again...my father in law loved and my hubby said it was alright. Next time (hints) I will use a much bigger skillet so that asparagus and mushrooms aren't piled so high and have roon in the skillet. I did double the sauce but they wanted more...MMMM more wine. =) I think I'll be able to make this to my liking next attempt. USE LARGE SKILLET FOLKS!

This had great flavor!  I decided to use pork chops instead of chicken with great results.  As suggested by some other reviewers, I added some onions and capers to the dish as well as more lemon and white cooking wine (a total of 3 Tbs each).

This was an excelent recipe and the chef needs to be complimented for her expertise.  The subtley of the spices brought out the vegtable flavor like they were fresh-picked.  My wife and I send our greastest thanks to the chef- grneyenmustang -One question though, where did you get the such  skinny asparagus?

This was wonderful!  I doubled the amount of herbs, lemon juice and wine because I had double the amount of asparagus and mushrooms.  It was better than I anticipated and I will definitely make it again.

I steamed the broccoli prior to adding to the chicken so the chicken was very nice and moist.  We served with Couscous and it was delicious.  Will make again.

This dish was excellent!! I did tweak it a bit by using fresh herbs from my herb garden instead of dried, fresh baby bellas and only used the tips of the Asparagus.  I also doubled the recipe and used bone in breasts and baked in the oven for about 45 minutes at 375.

This recipe is very good.  I have made it several times. I normally add about a a 1/2 cup of cream at the very end and cook for an additional 2 or 3 minutes.  This is great a great recipe.

This is a simple, healthy recipe. I've made it twice now and it just tastes fresh and nice. It isn't the most flavorful dish, but the flavors combined well and I felt that it had a wholesome quality.  It was easy and inexpensive to make.  

Like other reviewers suggested, I did add more liquid (equal parts olive oil, lemon juice, and white wine). I served it over pasta. Adding cheese, like Parmesan, would enrich this.  

You could also use the base and swap out the vegetables (I could see summer squash, zucchini, and peas working too).  You could easily change up the spices as well, to taste. This will be a go-to staple because of the ease and flexibility of this recipe.

Packed with flavor and so easy. I used fresh herbs from my garden, using less than if using dried because fresh herbs are stronger. I had leftover home made chicken tenders so I sliced them on the bias and added them last until warm. Delish!

Great healthy dinner and not too filling. I added more lemon juice and butter. Served it over brown rice.

This turned out really good for us.  Guess I got a little generous with the oils at the beginning..... Used more garlic, baby bella mushrooms,  and generous measures of the spices..... Also some white wine I already had open.  Turned out yummy!  Was thinking that it was restaurant quality as I enjoyed it.  Along with it served some boiled carrots and a creamy pasta dish.  Good stuff!

The dish is ALMOST perfect! I made it last week and, while delicious, it felt like it needed something more to be complete. I ended up serving it over some handmade fettuccine and grated some aged Parmesan over the top. It was utter perfection. Even my finicky 6-year-old went back for seconds!

We absolutely loved this. Simple to make but SO flavorful. We didn’t have dried basil so I used more oregano and it was great. Also, we wanted more sauce so I added more wine and lemon juice plus corn starch to thicken it. Make sure you have some good bread to mop up

This is so tasty and healthy!!!!  Even my asparagus hating son didn’t complain.  I doubled the garlic, mushrooms and asparagus.  I cooked the mushrooms first, then set aside and browned the chicken with seasoning before adding them back with the liquid and rest of ingredients.  Thanks grneyedmustang, this is a keeper!

3/10/19: I followed the recipe and instructions exactly, and the flavors were very good, but the chicken was a bit dry. It didn’t brown much during the first 3 minutes, but it did brown during the remaining cooking time. The mushrooms and asparagus were perfect though. There was very little liquid remaining in the pan at the end of the cooking time. Next time I will try adding the asparagus after the 1st 3 minutes of cooking with just chicken, continue cooking 3 minutes before adding the mushrooms, then cook just 3 more minutes, maybe covered, for a total of 9 minutes cooking. If it still looks like the pan is getting too dry I’ll add a bit more wine.  3/22/19 Update: I tried this and did not need to add any more wine and the chicken was juicy and tender this time, and still thoroughly cooked.

This was really delicious and easy to make.  I cooked the mushrooms separately in olive oil and added them and the uncooked asparagus at the same time, cooked 3 minutes. Otherwise I did everything the same.  Great recipe! Thanks!

I rarely make a recipe as is.  I always use it as my base and go from there.  In this case I used leftover cooked chicken and added after the asparagus was almost done.  I also added a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick.   It was good and will make again.

Very simple, light, and tasty. I thought it lacked some oomph--I might add extra seasonings (including a little salt) next time. However, it was a great base recipe, perfectly enjoyable as it was, and a combination of ingredients I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Thanks for posting this one!

This came out really well. I’m usually a real stickler when making recipes the first time but I could see all the opportunities to adjust this recipe to your liking and ingredient availability and just sort of followed the framework of the recipe. I did have the main ingredients but fudged the herbs and garlic a little. It was awesome. Maybe the final product was a little oily (also served it over buttery pasta) but I didn’t mind. So many possibilities with this super-simple recipe. Definitely a new staple meal at our house.

Think I'll increase the spices/herbs next time.  Not as flavorful as I had hope.  It was an easy dish and came together quickly. I didn't serve it with any pasta but might try spaghetti squash next time.

I wanted something special for my fresh farmer's market asparagus and this filled the bill!  We've been a little "chickened" out this week, so I used sausage instead.  Worked out great.  Will,definitely make this again!

Made this dairy free by using vegan spread for the butter and a bit more olive oil - it was fresh & vibrant served over angel hair pasta.  My nearly adult sons don't normally like asparagus as a side dish but scarfed it up made this way - my older son claimed the leftovers for his lunch at work the next day!

Will be making this again for sure!  I used more asparagus and mushrooms than called for. Amazing flavor. Husband wants it added to the regular rotation! Even my kids ate it!

I substituted carrots for the mushrooms and used balsalmic vinegar in place of the cooking wine. The result was fantastic!

Based on other reviews, I amended as follows:
Added red onion 
Doubled lemon juice, wine & spices (added even more wine toward end as I cook heavy on the wine)
Cooked chicken & set aside
Cooked asparagus a bit longer prior to adding mushrooms, braised In the extra wine with lid on. (Asparagus stalks  I had on hand were rather thick)
Served over wild rice mix.
It turned out absolutely perfect.

Ran out of parsley so used more basil & oregano. Had to cook asparagus longer as the stalks were huge. Next time I’ll steam them a bit first if I can’t get small stalks. Also used more wine as per the other reviews. Served it with zucchini noodles. Would taste great with peppers too.

Good base but not enough flavor. Needs way more seasoning. More acid ( we added lots of lime) and pepper to save it. Could work with stronger spices also, instead of the acid.

I added onions, sun dried tomatoes and a bit of vegetable broth and served it with spaghetti.  My guests said it was delicious and each had two servings.  I wish there had been a little more sauce.

Don't wait until the chicken starts to brown as the recipe states. My chicken took a while longer than three minutes to brown and ended up tough and a bit dry after everything else was finished.

Otherwise, this is a great dish! The taste and the balance of the meal are wonderful. I paired it with orzo pasta.

I had to doctor is up quite a bit to be to my liking.  I amped up the salt, pepper, added cayenne and garlic and went big on the acid - lemon and white wine (I used vermouth).  Without it, it would have been bland. I added cooked egg noodles at the end.

I made this as is.  It was ok but not by the author's fault.  I'm not a huge asparagus fan.  My husband likes asparagus and it was a little much for him.  I probably will not make this again.

This was delicious!!!  My family loved it!!!  I added more lemon juice and white cooking wine and added red peppers.  Also, I cooked mine differently.  I baked my chicken breasts in the oven before hand and chopped up two of them.    I sauteed the mushrooms and onions together in butter.  Then, I roasted the asparagus and red peppers in olive oil, a pinch of sea salt,  and a pat of butter.  Next, I added the chicken to the asparagus and red peppers, added all of the herbs, lemon juice and white cooking wine.  Added the mushrooms and onion mixture last.  Served it over brown rice.  Topped it with Parmesan cheese.  So yummy!!!

I really liked this dish.   I did go about it a little differently than the original recipe.  I cooked the mushrooms with the chicken with olive oil along with the herbs.  I added the butter when the chicken was browned and the rest of the ingredients.  I did wait to put the asparagus in until just before it was done so it wouldn't get soggy.  Turned out great!

I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs, a large bunch of asparagus and a box of baby Portabella mushrooms.  Because I didn't follow the proportions, I think my spices were a bit off in the recipe, but even so, the recipes was good and easy.  I will definitely make again.  One thing that I did on a whim was to grate lemon rind onto the dish in addition to the lemon juice called for in the recipe.  I will make this addition again.  It was a nice flavor boost.

Thanks for the recipe.  Warning!  Have everything ready and on hand before starting.  Our herbs burned quickly.  Next time I will add the herbs a few minutes after the chicken cooks.  Also use less butter and a pinch more salt. (and we are low sodium people).  Will definitely make again!  Thanks again for sharing.

I made some slight modifications based on reviews.  I increased the olive oil and wine and decreased the butter and used Italian Seasoning since I didn't have basal.  I also added capers.  Family loved it!

This was pretty good, but I had to double the spices, lemon juice, and wine to make it taste good. I will be looking for a way to give it a bit more kick.

Good starts, terrible finish. You are better off cooking the vegetables before adding or else they dont get tender.  unless you like raw fiberous asparagus. This is a base for what could be a good recipe

I loved how simple, easy & healthy  this recipe is. I added more sauce so I would have enough for my rice. The liquid does cook down fast and I had to keep adding but I kept all the liquid ratios the same. I also didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth. Next time I will try it with wine just to taste the difference.This is now a one of my go to recipes for weeknights!

The only change I made to this recipe was I used tenderloins instead of breasts, and cut back on the cooking time.  The meal came out perfectly as far as the chicken was tender, the sauce was the right amount, and it appeared delicious.  Only problem, very bland, almost no taste!!!

I will try this recipe again because I believe it has potential.  The next time, I will use capers as another reviewer suggested, as well as more garlic, and my favorite seasoning.  

I'm not a spice girl by any stretch of the imagination; more like a sugar baby... lol... however, I do like some taste!   This recipe definitely deserves another try.   I wish I could give it 3.5 stars because I didn't dislike it and it was a little better than OK.  Bon appetit!

After reading reviews of a bland dish, I changed it up! First I sliced mushrooms, sauteed them in olive oil and removed from pan with juice. Then I sautéed 2 clove of garlic minced with two thinly sliced shallots. Once they softened, I added thin, snapped asparagus pieces. I added rotisserie chopped chicken to the asparagus.  The mushrooms and juice were added back into the pan with 1/4 cup Madiera wine,1 Tblsp. capers and one of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, salt and pepper to taste. Served over Orrechiette and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese..

Very simple but tasty and easy to prepare. I did add black pepper and extra white wine and lemon juice (about 3 tablespoons each) as others suggested for more sauce.  My husband and I loved it over jasmine rice. Next time I might try capers or sun dried tomatoes and serve over pasta. Will definitely make again!

This turned out really well- instead of adding asparagus to the chicken to cook, I blanched it, then incorporated it- served over risotto - delicious

To bland for my taste.  Added fresh ground pepper to spice it up a bit.  Also, I get my chicken breasts from a butcher, so they are big.  I had about 2 pounds of meat.  Doubled the vegetables and spices to get a healthier balance.

This dish needs more of everything to be really flavourful. 
My chicken wasn't browning and my pan needed more moisture so I added another squeeze of half a lemon, a huge glug of wine, a big pinch of salt, basil, oregano, and pepper and upped the cloves of garlic to a total of 3.
Followed the cooking method. After cook time everything looked grey.. And not really pretty.. Although it tasted good after the addition of more liquid and flavours. 
I garnished mine with lemon zest.

I only had limes so substituted lime juice. I added some sliced orange bell peppers for color. Everything else is the same. I served with brown rice. It was a great way to use our garden asparagus!

Delicious! I made it according to recipe but had to drain some of the liquid while cooking the chicken to help it brown better. next time I might marinate the chicken shortly before cooking, as it could have used a tiny bit more flavor. served it with white rice and I added a bit of teriyaki sauce at the end :)

Quick, simple, healthy and delicious meal!! My husband loved it and so did I. I did use a little extra lemon and garlic but it probably didn't need it I just happen to love lemon and garlic. Will definitely be making this more often..

Very tasty!! My chicken didn't brown in the liquid,  so next time I will brown the chicken in olive oil first, then make the sauce and saute the veggies, and add the chicken back in at the end. Served over whole wheat spaghetti.

This is bland. Will not make again. Easy enough, but  just sauteing the veggies and chicken in butter would have had more flavour. Very disappointed.

Very easy, tasty dish! I was looking for a way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken and this was the perfect recipe for that.  Since my chicken was already cooked, this dish came together in no time.  I cut down on the butter and oil a bit, and substituted chicken broth for wine - I ended up using more chicken broth to keep enough liquid in it while it cooked.  I added a little red pepper and a few capers.  Will be making this again!

We really like this. I completely browned the chicken before adding the lemon juice and chicken broth (which I used instead of wine) then added the asparagus. I didn't use mushrooms because husband is allergic. Topped the whole thing with lots of freshly grated Parmesan. Served along side of rice pilaf.  Will definitely make again.

This was very tasty, although I used less butter and olive oil and added zucchini.  I didn't like the method of adding the chicken after the oil, wine, and lemon juice as it just seemed to boil in there rather than brown.  Next time I will sauté everything in the olive oil/ butter and add the lemon juice and wine near the end.  I used fresh basil which I added at the end.

Chicken Asparagus Mushroom Skillet Haiku: "Sauce was AMAZING. Chicken dried out too much though. Ate over pasta." After the high heat browning and 10 additional minutes, followed by sitting the 6+ min. for the asparagus and mushrooms to cook, the chicken dried out a bit more than we would've liked, so when I make this again (yes, it IS a keeper - elegant, colorful and healthy), I will remove the chicken and cover it to keep warm b4 mixing back in. Also, the sauce was absolutely scrumptious and as some other reviews mention, probably worth doubling. Doing so also may have combated the dry-ish chicken. I served ours over linguine w/ a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and a grind of black pepper.

Very good, I follow some other suggestions. Added Herbs de Provence and used fresh Basil. Should have followed the suggestion about adding liquid after browning, the chicken simply poached, but it was tasty and tender. Very little liquid left, so next time (and I will make it again) I will double the wine/lemon juice, and also add it after browning the chicken.

Loved the base recipe! Breaded the chicken in Italian bread crumbs and garlic powder first, and added half an onion to the seasoned butter mixture first. I also substituted the wine with chicken broth because I was accidentally out. Husband loved it!

Very tasty. Nice blend of flavors.  Next time, I will wait to add the lemon juice and wine until the chicken is browned.

I love this dish! It is so quick and easy. I forgot to add the white wine but it was still delicious! I used Cavenders Greek Seasoning on the chocking and added it to the veggies along with all the other spices and it was so good. Cavenders Greek seasoning is a must have in your pantry! You can use it on anything.

This was absolutely delicious.  I doubled everything so that we would have lefftovers for lunch, and we almost didn't.  I was a little worried, since I didn't serve this with pasta or rice, just as is, but it was still plenty, and filling for us.

This was a really good recipe. I had green beans on hand so I used those instead of asparagus. Easy, quick, good, pretty basic but my two year old loved it so it's hard to argue with that!

Really liked this 1 skillet dish!  Like others, increased the lemon/wine to 3 Tbls each.  Added a 1/2 chopped onion.  Will make again!

Great recipe without the chicken! Added a thinly sliced onion and sliced a yellow & an orange pepper, more lemon juice and wine and had a wonderful vegetarian dish! Oh yes also eliminated the butter entirely!!

I made this adding some pearl onions and cayenne.  It was amazing.  My three teenage boys kept telling me how good it was.

Easy and delicious!  I made it according to the recipe except for the wine, which I didn't have on hand, so I just used more lemon juice.  Easy prep and great fresh taste!  I covered it during the 10 min cooking time to preserve the liquid.  The chicken came out very tender and flavorful!

This recipe was good, love the fresh veggies in it! I would add more lemon juice and wine next time I make it--the flavor was a bit bland, and I've made other recipes similar to this that have a lot more of that lemon sauce flavor to it.

I doubled the seasoning (except for the salt), mushrooms, asparagus, and olive oil and after browning the chicken, I tripled the wine (I used yellowtail moscato) and lemon juice. I also added 1 white onion (because I love onion). I served on top of thin spaghetti noodles, which I boiled in water (duh) with 2 chicken bouillon cubes then strained. It was not bland as some reviewers said, but the seasonings were mild. The dish had a good flavor overall. The lemon was not overpowering as I worried it would be. It seemed the seasoning somewhat brought out the flavors of the asparagus/mushroom/onion. Overall a very good dish that was fairly easy to prepare. Oh, and I cut the chicken thin similarly to how beef is for broccoli beef. The way I made it was more of a 4 star dish, but I didn't make it exactly as instructed, so I gave 5.

The flavors of this dish were subtle but good. The only complaint I have was that after I melted the butter with olive oil and threw in the chicken, the skillet got filled with a lot of liquid for some reason (the chicken I threw in was not wet. Maybe I overcrowded it in the skillet?) Therefore, the dish got watery and I think maybe that's why the flavors got watered down which I didn't mind anyway. I was just hoping it would thicken somehow and turn into a nice sauce for presentation. Oh yea, the mushrooms tasted really good so next time I would double the amount.

This was a great recipe idea to jump start a chicken dish.  Loved the flavors of the seasonings and ingredients.  I added more liquid as in I used 1 cup of wine (instead of cooking wine)  and the juice of 1/2 of a large lemon.  Used a little corn starch in water to thicken the sauce and served over pasta.  Great recipe and thanks for sharing!

This was one of my favorite recipes from this site! Simple, quick and super delicious!! Didn't use quite as much olive oil as it called for but that was the only change I made.  It's going into the dinner rotation for sure.

Tried it.  Tasted great.  I used less butter and more olive oil.  Also added sliced celery and extra portobello mushroom to make it a one dish meal.

Loved this recipe! I used regular drinking white wine that I had on hand and topped over spaghetti! Other then the wine I made no modifications and it was perfect! Great fresh spring dish!

Delicious! Did sub olive oil for some of the butter, but other wise kept to the original recipe. It's a keeper.

Instead of the dried parsley I used 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley and added it at the end. I also added one half of a chopped onion along with the asparagus when I was cooking that. It could have used a pinch more salt for my taste.

I thought this had a nice flavor and will make it again.  I only used the olive oil and did not have the wine or mushrooms on hand.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried but otherwise followed the recipe the best I could.
I put this over a green salad and it would be great over rice as well.  I'd like to try it with all fresh herbs instead of the dried next time.  I had a little too much liquid in the pan this time but I think it was because the chicken was still on the frozen side when I sliced it.  I would recommend completely thawing and patting dry the chicken before slicing and adding to the pan.
