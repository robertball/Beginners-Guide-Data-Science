These meatballs are the best EVER!  I've been making them for over 3 decades and they have always been a hit.  Always the first appetizer to go!  The vibrant color alone make it a perfect appetizer for the holidays. If I could, I would give them 10 STARS!

I thought these were fantastic and everyone at the party raved about them. The only changes I made were fewer bread crumbs-about 1/2-3/4 of a cup in the meatballs-always depends on the fat content of the meat; I did add the can of chopped pineapple to the sauce as another reviewer suggested and I think that is a great add-in for this recipe. I put the meatballs in the crock pot when they were done-about medium and I cooked the sauce longer on the stove-about med. heat for 10 mins. or so, stirring continuously. Then I poured the sauce over the meatballs in the crock pot and had them on low for about an hour before serving. These are going to be my go-to appetizer for work parties and other events like that. They are just a bit different so it's not the usual cocktail meatball. They taste great and are pretty easy to make.

These were great! I would never have thought to use canned cranberry sauce for a meatball sauce. Glad I did!

Jazzyrobn was so right! I brought these to our Christmas party last night and they were devoured in minutes! People were upset that I didn't have more and I brought about 60 of them. Many asked for the recipe and loved that it uses jellied cranberry sauce for the glaze. The only thing I do differently is that I put the drained meatballs into a crock pot and pour the sauce over them and heat on high for 1 hour. The crock pot stays nice and hot and they are easier to transport to wherever you maybe going. This will definitely be my go-to potluck dish from now on. Loved it!! Edited on 12-18-15 -- I brought these cocktail meatballs to another Christmas party this year and, again, the crock pot came home empty. :)

This was a Recipe Group selection. I made these meatballs larger and served with white rice for dinner. I really liked the sauce and would give it a 5; I used whole berry sauce. However, my whole family thought the meatballs were rather bland and would give them a 3. So I'll call the total recipe a 4. Next time I would double the garlic powder and onion and add some salt and pepper to the meatball mixture. Someone else suggested half sausage, which would also be better.

I made the meatballs larger so I could serve it as a supper and it was very good. Very moist meatballs, sauce just had a touch of sweetness and was very good served with rice. I would definitely do this as an appetizer at a party or potluck!

I really didn't like them.  It was a disappointment as I took them to a buffet for Christmas.  People said they were good tho'.  I won't make them again.  I did make them as written in the recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group...LOVED these! So simple to make and so yummy...they were gone in a flash! To save some time, I made/baked the meatballs the day before, then made the sauce the next day and poured it on right before I was ready to bake them the second time...worked perfectly. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a good basic recipe that can be made much better by adding different spices especially Italian herbs and sausage in the meatballs. I also use the whole berry cranberry sauce by Ocean Spray. This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for the last week of December, 2013.

Used 4" deep dish for splatter (see pic)! Follow recipe for size of meatball. I made mine size of golfball (made 40 cnt). The ratio of meat to sauce for the bite is too much meat. Make 1/2 to 2/3 size of golf ball (large grape?) I used half Italian sausage and beef, next time chorizo and lean beef (50|50) for more flavor. Added Italian seasoning. Added heaping tablespoon minced garlic in addition to garlic powder. Reduced to 3/4 cup bread crumbs b/c adding sausage. Total of half onion used for shredding could use a little more. Eyes were screaming in pain too!

These meatballs were delicious, although I like a little sweet and spicy myself, so I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and a little bit of smoked paprika to the sauce while it was simmering on the stove top! very delicious this way!!

I have also made these meatballs for 30 years and they are always a hit at potlucks and family parties. Once made I put them in a crockpot on low and they are good to go for all day snacking. :)

I have made these for to separate family functions and each time they have been a huge hit.  I did use precooked/frozen meatballs to speed up prep time due to limited cooking space.  I also added 1TBSP of either hot pepper jelly or hot cranberry jelly per batch of sauce.  It gave them a little more kick for those that love just a little spice.

Recipe Group Selection for December 28, 2013 –  I thought they had good flavor and looked very appealing.   You know that others thought they were very good because there was none left.

This is a great recipe. The changes I made were slight and my preferences only.

* I used a a mix of beef, veal, and pork for my meatballs, 1/3 each for the 2lbs. 
* Rather than grate the onions, I chopped mine fine and sauteed with a touch of olive oil. Then mixed in with the meat mixture.  Otherwise,  I followed the meatballs recipe. 

For the sauce, I just added a small cup of O.J. and a little extra splash o f lemon juice. to kick up the citrus. 

I will likely make these again.

these are very good with a few minor adjustments.  The meatballs as written are bland.  I pinched off a tsp of it and microwaved just to check the amt of flavor.  I adjusted to taste and must say that the texture was very fluffy, so the ratio of meat to breadcrumbs is spot on.  The sauce again had to be tweaked.  It was a bit one-dimensional as written and I could taste the ketchup a bit more than I would have liked.  I added a bit of orange zest to the sauce, and added a can of crushed pineapple.  The other reason I added more liquid was that it seemed like there would not be quite enough sauce for the amt of meat; especially if one wanted to keep these warm in a crockpot; would be too afraid of scorching or burning.  With tweaking, this is a nice recipe and again, the ratio of breadcrumb to meat produces a nice fluffy meatball.  I don't however see how this could be eaten as a main course 'over rice', as it is very sweet.  I may even cut back a tad on the amt of brown sugar next time.

These meatballs are a little bland in my opinion. I wouldn't make them again. Maybe you could add a spice/herb to brighten the flavor.

These meatballs are amazing.  I make them for work pot lucks and everyone goes nuts. I make them at home with mashed potatoes for my meat and potatoes husband. I didn't change a thing. Great for the crock pot too.

This is an excellent recipe. I enjoy it followed as is. I ALSO think it tastes great when cutting corners/saving time using a bag of frozen meatballs.  Have gotten positive remarks and requests for the recipe whenever I bring it to a 'covered dish'/pot luck event.

This was delicious but we found it a little on the sweet side, so next time I will cut the brown sugar down to 1T. (there's lots of sugar in ketchup and cranberry sauce!). I also added some salt and pepper to the meatball mixture.   I had leftover sauce, so made another l lb. of ground beef into meatballs and added the sauce and when the meatballs were cooked I reheated in the sauce in the micro just till hot.  Delish - so next time I will use 3 lbs. of ground meat and the same amount of sauce.  My daughter cannot eat gluten, so I used 2 slices of gluten free bread and made it into breadcrumbs.

These were easy and flavorful. I received quite a few requests for the recipe. 
Personally, I did think they were a tad sweet and ketchupy tasting, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.
They worked great as cocktail meatballs. Not so sure 
I would like these as a main dish.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I added 1# of sweet Italian sausage, 1 -1/2 cups of shredded parmesan cheese, and used panko instead of bread crumbs and then increased all ingredients by 1/2 due to the addition of the sausage.   Cooked the meatballs for 30 minutes in the oven and then in a crock pot for 2 hours on high before taking them to a Christmas party.    They were a big hit and all gone by the time we got home.  Loved the sweetness of the cranberry sauce and the overall taste of the meatballs.  Definitely 5 star and will be making again.

Excellent recipe as is.  Needs no changes.
I was concerned that the sauce would be too sweet.  I added 1/2 can of crushed pineapple as suggested by others, but I also combined that with 1/3 cup fresh cranberries and processed smooth.  This resolved any issues with sweetness as the fresh cranberries are a bit sour.  This came out very nice.  
I also added 1/3 cup Parmesan to the meatball mix, reduced bread crumbs to 1 cup, and bumped up the parsley to 1/2 cup.  I made 55 cocktail meatballs.  Next time I will increase the amount of sauce, but it was perfectly fine as is.

The sauce was a bit sweet so we decided next time we'd add some red pepper to the sauce. Otherwise very good.

Really good appetizer or even as a meatball sandwich. My family enjoyed them.I cooked these in a slow cooker instead of on the stove.  There was a delightful aroma in my kitchen as they cooked. I would make them again.

Not a hit with my family, the cocktail meatballs from this site remain the favorite. Recipes are similar, one has ketchup and other uses chili sauce.
