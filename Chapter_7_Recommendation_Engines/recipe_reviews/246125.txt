PLEASE READ PRIOR TO MAKING: These rolls are better than the store bought kind and quite easy to make. I’ve made this recipe several times now, making adjustments along the way. I would agree with the former reviews that step 8 needs to be altered to 20 minutes total with the turn 10 minutes in and a re-spritz of the water. When I did not alter it the two times previous, the crust was too hard for my taste, but never did they burn with the additional time. Please do not listen to the one review that says it will bake in 6 minutes total- it’ll be raw and inedible.As for why this calls for ounces (which other reviews question) rather than cups is quite simple- it creates a more accurate bake. Chef John did a solid by adding the approximate amount in cups in the Cook’s footnotes, right under the instructions and in plain site. Also, if the dough is too sticky initially, then the instructions clearly state to add additional flour as needed. Furthermore, it says very sharp knife for a reason; it will deflate if you don’t use one. That said, it doesn’t affect taste just the presentation. If you run into any other problems, watching the video provided is quite beneficial.

I used the bread machine to mix this. Dough setting. Then followed instructions for cooking as is. Will definitely be keeping this recipe and using it often. Thanks!

These were great for philly cheese steak sandwiches, and pretty good on their own too!  

I did make one *minor* change. When letting dough rise I always use a damp towel instead of a dry towel, and had no issues with any 'skin' developing.  Turned out great!

I had all purpose flour and no bread flour so I used the all purpose  by weight. I also don't have a mister so I just dipped a pastry brush in water and flicked it over the top.....DELISH!

Perfect for 2 of us ,Made 6 rolls 2 of which I formed into Hoagie rolls and 4 into round rolls, We had them over a 6 day period and the last 2 we had were just as good as the first day, I held the rolls over a faucet to get them wet and popped them into a 350 degree oven for 6-7 minutes, this makes them crisp and soft on the inside. It's a procedure I do to any store bought rolls as well. next time I will add some caramelized onions to the top.

This was quite possibly the worst written recipe for directions I have ever encountered. First, we had to figure out what 19 ounces of flour was. Who uses ounces when it should be written in cups? Especially when 19 ounces only amounts to about 2.37 cups. In the end I added about 3 and 1/2 cups of flour. So that was totally off.

The directions for  how long the bread was to bake was also way off. My first batch was burnt. My second batch I put in for 10 then I spritzed them and then put them in for another ten. So if you have a good oven do not put them in for 20 minutes, spritz and then 10, or they will burn.

I am not sure if it was the spritzing or the pan of water but these also turned out far too crunchy and chewy. 

Won't do this one again.

Hopefully next time I make these rolls, I will be able to give them 5 stars. I had a problem with the final rise, and they dried out a  and developed a "skin". When I went to slash them (with a razor), they deflated a bit. However, they tasted great! Will keep trying! Thanks Chef John, for another  WONDERFUL recipe!

Really hard to mess these up! Perfect for novice bakers and pros! If you've never made your own homemade sandwich rolls, you've gotta give these a shot! I don't have a bread maker and this is the only white sandwich roll recipe I use.

I made 6 rolls tonight and they were excellent and well-received by my 4 adult family.  This recipe could make 12, or more,  smaller  dinner rolls following the same recipe/technique that also would be well-received at a larger gathering.    Thanks, Chef John!

I make a lot of bread and this is one of the easiest recipe ever! Wonderfully crusty on the outside and very soft and airy on the inside. The only change that I made was to weigh the dough balls, I wanted them to be uniform in size so the baked properly. Another great recipe by Chef John, thanks!

Step 8 of the recipe is wrong. Should read "Bake 20 minutes until golden, turning halfway though the baking cycle and spray with water." As written, you over bake the rolls 10 minutes, causing the bottoms to burn.

The recipe was a disaster.  I felt when I warmed the water 
for the yeast that this was far too hot (100F).  Went ahead anyway.  The dough was far too sticky.  I added flour and put in warm area to prove.  The dough trippled in size, very sticky.   Once it was made into rolls it immediate flattened.  So I scrapped the idea.  What went wrong?  Star rating 0

Perfect lean bread. If converted to baker’s percentages, it can  be  easily scaled. I used 450 grams of bread flour as my starting point. Recipe is “standard”  so water is 62-65% of  flour which results in  a manageable dough- I am 100% hands mixing.  Yields 6,  4-5 ounce rolls. A little pan of water on the bottom rack, spray when placed in the oven and in 10 minutes, Key is bake to an internal temperature of 200-210 degrees F. 

No hurries, no scurries , No worries, y’all

I make bread and rolls all the time.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't work.  I had to keep adding flour because it was too wet.  The amount of flour I had to add was quite a bit to get the dough to the right texture.  The bake is way too long and/or the temperature was way too high.  The result was inedible.

Watched the tutorial. Cut the 60 minute rise times to 30 because I was short on time and still turned out great. Will use again!

This recipe works very well. I rarely bake, but this is easy to follow and the results are very good. When I do it again I'll add some flavor elements.

Taste okay but the crust is tough and chewy. I did use bread machine dough setting. Perhaps it mixed too long? I did follow other people’s tips and had water in the bottom, spritzed twice and only baked 20 min with turn at halfway.  Might try again and use damp instead of dry towel. Maybe the surface dried out too much during rising. I’m in FL so perhaps the AC took too much humidity out.

I've been making these rolls weekly for a few months now, and they are awesome! Perfect and easy for newbie bread bakers or people new to working with yeast
The only place I deviated from the recipe was in the cooking time. 
I know people are complaining about the flour measurement being in weight. That's because flour is so fine that it compacts very easily. 19 ounces is perfect. You start adding more and you're going to get a more dense roll. And don't forget to put the water in the bottom! Very important. 
Take the time, read the recipes completely, read reviews. Most importantly, have fun with it. Very doubtful this recipe is so great for so many, but only a handful have anything really negative to say.

I’ve made this several times and the whole family loves it! The sharp knife is definitely important as my first batch deflated because my knife wasn’t sharp enough.   Once I remedied that.... VOILÀ ! Beautiful every time!

I usually LOVE Chef John's recipes. This bread tasted rather bland and I found the bread too heavy. I was very surprised. I have made this three times now, so I do not believe it was due to any error.

These are good! Not a ton of flavor but we’re a good vehicle for steak and pepper sandwiches. I used all purpose flour and brushed them with water instead of spraying. I baked them at 425 for 13 minutes and that was plenty. Very crusty on the outside

The recipe was really easy to make, although I had to add about 100 g (3,5 oz for you Americans) of flour. Also, the baking time had to be adjusted in my case (I've got a convection oven so no surprise here). The family just loved it so definitely will do it again!

I followed this recipe and it was a disaster. Are you sure it's 450F for 20 minutes? I tried it that way and burned the bread at the bottom. I will give it another try with less time or a lower temp. 

Not all ovens are created equal.

I did make these and they tasted great. For the first time baking these, they didn't quite look the way they should.

Made these today. They look great but the final rise after shaping the sub rolls didn't happen much. I ended up with sub rolls that are about twice the size of a breadstick. Not sure what went wrong. Maybe I made to many out of a batch? I made six 8" sub rolls. Any advice?

This was my first time making sandwich rolls, and I'm glad I took the time to do it because they turned out amazing! My oldest son asked me when did I have time to go to the store - he thought they were store bought! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and left them in for only 20 mins, turning halfway, and they browned up quite nicely. I used a brush to brush on water before putting them in the oven (and only then), and the crust didn't come out super hard. Overall, a great recipe :) Thanks again, John!

Crunchy on the outside and a soft delicious center.  Super easy and yummy.

Superb. I'm not a baker, I usually end up with little bricks when I try. But I knew if I follow Chef John's recipes, I would be good. Especially after watching the video! He is thorough and leads you step by step. I made this exactly as said, and they came out delicious. The only differences being... My dough didn't rise quite enough the first rise. I'm thinking maybe it wasn't warm enough in the house, OR my instant yeast (that was sealed in the packet) was somehow a dud. I also cooked them in a Breville Smart Oven Pro (a 'toaster' oven with convection and better temperature control than most home ovens), so because of this I had no room for the water tray. I sprayed the water a bit more generously and they were fine. The cook time was shorter, about 12-14 minutes, and I ended up taking the rolls off the pan and putting them on a plate covered with a clean hand towel to soften their crusts a bit (the first three I did on the middle rack and it cooked the tops a bit more). They softened beautifully, and now this will be a staple in my house. So easy!

Note: They might be a little salty for those who are sensitive, my advice is to cut the salt down a bit. Also, the flour is in weight because that is the proper measurement, not cups. Look at the note on the recipe for it in cups.

Excellent taste however cook time was too long resulting in very hard crusts. Next time I will watch more closely and take out when golden brown. Probably my could have cut name time in half.

Very easy recipe to follow. My only issue is when I score them they deflate. Lol. I’m not sure why but they rise in the oven and taste great.

I am just starting out at making homemade bread, since I realized that the stand mixer could do the kneading for me. We had leftover meatballs and red sauce, and my son suggested we make meatball subs with them.  We made this bread and it was very good. Better then store-bought.  I didn't make the ends pointy just because we wanted the ends to be fluffy inside too.  The bread cuts easily, and made great crostini. Also  delicious plain with butter.  Watching the video was extremely helpful, taking out the guesswork .

I'm not much of a bread maker, but I was looking for a roll or bun recipe that would be good with our homemade pulled pork. This was my first time with this recipe. I did use all-purpose flour and made 12 smaller rolls instead, as I have younger children. I followed the recipe and agree with other reviewers in that the total bake time should be 20 min with a rotation and Spritz halfway through. The rolls turned out beautiful and tasted great! My husband and dinner guests loved these, also. Thanks for the video... that helped a lot for an amateur like myself!

I am still in process of making but am on the last one hour rise. 4 and a quarter cups is definitely too much flour so I do not know if these will double again as they should.  The too much flour is also what causes the odd skin someone else mentioned.   Next time I will add the flour a little at a time instead of all at once.

A nice, simple recipe that produced crusty delicious rolls. One note: measure the flour by weight, not measuring cup. I did the latter and my dough was way too wet. Also you need a super-sharp knife to slash the top of the rolls before cooking. So mine look a bit amateurish, but they are very tasty.

Very easy and turned out great! Add a (oven-safe) bowl of water to the oven with them to help improve the crust! It mimics a dutch oven environment.
