I found this recipe when I was looking for a recipe I had lost from my grandmother.  Hers used oil and were crunchier.  We used to make a pot of tea to enjoy with our cookies.I just whip up a batch before making dinner and put them in the freezer and after dinner take them out and bake.  They got A+ reviews from the guys at work too!  They don't last long to worry about storage, they are too good!

These are great cookies! I didn't use walnuts in the cookies. I also used half of the recipie and subsituted 1/8 of the sugar for splenda. The cookies have a little but of caramel tast but when you bite into them you don't think caramel. I loved these cookies though and will make these again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Not very caramel at all.   I'm going to try adding some caramel frosting to see if that helps.

Love these! They don't taste very carmel-y but they are a great base cookie dough to add to! I added about 3 Tablespoons of extra butter (just personal preference). I separated the dough and I added coconut, pecan, white chocolate chips, or left them plain and added a chocolate icing (semisweet Baker's chocolate, milk, and powdered sugar) after baking.  I didn't refrigerate overnight so I baked them for about 8 minutes and they turned out great!
