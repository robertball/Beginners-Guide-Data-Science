I have made this several times for friends who have mentioned no longer being able to find this type of pie-always to rave reviews.  Some tips I would pass on would be: 
1) ALWAYS have your cream cheese at room temperature before attempting to mix. Otherwise your cream filling will come out lumpy, and just not have a good texture.
2) make sure you cook the lemon filling long enough. It needs to thicken on the stove or it will just be runny and not set right.
3)add the food coloring sparingly! Too much will make the pie filling part look very fake. I find with the lemon zest added in I usually only use one drop of food coloring.
Enjoy!

I liked the combination of the cream cheese and whip cream. I used real whip cream and whipped it before I folded it in and it was good. I love the rich taste more then cool whip. I found it to be a little too sweet so next time I make it I may not put so much sugar in the Lemon mixture. 
But overall it was very good and I will keep it in my recipe box! Thank you

I made this for Easter too, and unfortunately it did not turn out the way it was suppose to. Pretty easy to do, however the filling is a bit much for the 9-inch pie pan, and sad to say , but the sauce on the top didn't set.... Everyone said they liked it, and said it was very good. I didn't like the way it looked, but it really did taste very good. I was surprised myself !!! .. any hints on the sauce ???

Terrific.  I changed a few things.  I used a 10" graham cracker crust, brushed it with slightly beaten egg white and baked it for 10 minutes at 350.  Let it cool.  This kept it crisp.  2nd change was using 3 oz Jello cook type lemon pudding mix. Let it cool before putting on cream cheese layer.  Everyone enjoyed it and my husband who is neither a pie or a lemon flavor fan liked it very much.  Thank you.

I've actually been looking for this recipe for some time, and this is perfect! The first time I made it, I actually just used Comstock Lemon Pie Filling instead of making the pie filling (had a taste for it, and no lemon peel or cornstarch), and it turned out just fine! Great way to speed up the process!

This Lemon Pie was to die for! I first tasted this pie at Bob Evans this is the same pie. I made this pie for a church dinner and everyone fought over getting to it. This recipe will be used as a family favorite.

I've been looking for a recipe such as this since trying a "Lemon Supreme Pie" at a restaurant called Village Inn.  I was hooked the day I tried it and this recipe hits the spot!  Thanks from Lori in Kansas

My family always bought one (or four!) of these from Baker's Square for holidays!  I am so glad I found this recipe.  I decrease the sugar in the cream cheese layer to 1/2 c, and prick the crust and bake it in the usual way, but other than that, this recipe is perfect.  Thanks!

My niece referred me to this recipe after making it for the family. Everyone LOVED it. I made it for myself & found it so easy & yummy. Got to thinking about the ease of adding the flavor & thought I'd try it with peach. Used a can of frozen Bacardi peach dacquari mix instead of the lemon juice plus 2 tbsp. of peach schnapps & added a tbsp. of peach schnapps to the cream cheese mixture. Also layered in thin slices of peaches between the layers. It was a MAJOR hit. Can't wait to try it with orange or other flavors or in mini tarts for the holidays. Love this recipe, but especially the lemon, OH triple WOW!!!!

Great recipe! My husband said he wouldn't believe I made it, if he didn't see me in the kitchen working on it:)
Suggestion: if you are not leaving cream cheese filling for garnish, use only 8oz of cream cheese (no need for extra 3oz) Just to ensure that all the lemon filling will fit on you pie.

I made this pie for Easter and wow! it was great!  I used a Nilla Wafer crust, and the combo worked really well. I was scared the lemon sauce would be too runny like the other readers mentioned, so when I added the lemon juice, I stirred the mixture a few times and poured off the excess juice before letting it cool. It came out perfect! I will make this one again for sure.

Yum! I followed directions exactly and it came out perfect.  I think next time I'll try graham cracker crust, for a different taste.  It was also really quick to make.

So good!  Similar to Village Inn's pie - but better!  I use real whipped cream instead of cool whip - it gives it a fresher taste

Wonderful tangy lemony flavor!  I am diabetic, so I made this recipe with Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out wonderful! I also used a little less lemon juice than it called for because the first one I made was a little too tangy.  Made me pucker!  If you use less lemon juice, make up for it with more water.

This pie is delicious.  My husband can't stop eating it.  It is very easy to make also.  I actually didn't add the lemon grate and it came out just as good.  Also, if the top layer is not thick enough after you cool it down, just reheat it until it gets thick and bubbly.

This pie is waesome as is! Wouldn't change a thing. I doubled it for alot of company and put it in a 9x13. I did follow other reviewers and just prick the crust as usual, skipped the foil. I had extra lemon and cheese filling, but it probably would have fit if my crust hadn't shrunk so much (I made my own). Great pie!

I just use lemon pudding from a boxed mix for the lemon-y part to save time, but this is a great recipe that makes a light, sweet ending to a heavy or spicy meal.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars.  If you like the taste of tangy lemon, then this recipe is for you.  I used low-fat cream cheese and it still tasted wonderful.  Next time, I think I would only put 2 or 3 drops of food coloring in, the pie had sort of an unnatural yellow color to it.

I divided all the ingredients in half to fill one regular 9" pie crust.  The fillings fit perfectly, and the whole thing firmed up nicely.  (I did use 3-1/2 Tbs. of cornstarch, as I live at 4600 ft. in elevation.)  The only problem I had: the recipe says to gently stir the lemon juice into the lemon filling.  Well, I REALLY had to stir and stir (and sometimes not so gently) to get the juice mixed in.  I did not reserve any cream cheese filling for garnish because it would not have shown up well on the lemon topping, since I did not add any yellow color to the lemon filling.  Loved how easy it was and that I only got 1 bowl and 1 saucepan dirty (beat the cream cheese mixture with a wooden spoon).  You will LOVE the fresh, lemony flavor of this pie.  Do try it.

it was hard to rate this recipe because I changed it so much, but I did "slimmerize" it by using splenda instead of sugar, used fat free cream cheese and low fat ricotta cheese blended in my processor and omited the crust and the whipped topping....BUT, it came out still very tasty and even my man and my kids loved it.

The taste of this pie definitely deserves five stars!  It is wonderful!  However, there is way too much filling for a 9-inch deep-dish pastry shell.  I could have used a 12-inch deep-dish pie plate and it would have been just right.  That's what I'll do next time because this recipe is a keeper.

This is a great recipe that I've made a few times.  I live at 5,300 altitude and have found that adding an extra tablespoon of cornstarch helps the topping set up better.  It's such a nice change and although rich, not as sweet as some desserts.

I only changed the crust to a graham cracker crust and it was fabulous.  Everyone loved it and we are usually a chocolate dessert household!

This pie tastes just like one I had as a kid from a popular restaruant. It beats all other pies hands down!

OOPS!  I tried this recipe and the lemon filling did not thicken enough.  After a second try, I checked for similar recipes and found that there is usually 3 beaten egg yolks added after the filling is removed from the heat and then it is cooked over low heat, stirring constantly until it boils 1 minute before it is cooled.  Since we are watching cholesterol at our house, I cooled the lemon mixture, then stirred in 1/2 cup egg substitute and brought it to a boil, stirring constantly, and boiled 1 minute while stirring and it thickened to an appropriate texture for pie filling.  It is a delicious pie.

THIS PIE IS SOOOO GOOD! I was recently in a place called The Village Inn, and had a pie like this, but didn't have anything like that around where I live. The only suggestion I have is a graham cracker crust. It's good with a regular crust, but I think the graham cracker will be GREAT! I am going to go have another piece right now! Enjoy!

Just make it! You will not be sorry. I have made it about 10 times and have tried to tweek it on several occasions. Even though it is always incredible, this is one of the few recipes that I suggest that you don't change a thing.

Very, very good.  I think I'll prick the uncooked pastry pie shell then bake it. For some reason with the foil method, it almost took flight! This is a great pie and I don't even like lemon pie. I do now!

I tried this recipe.  I really like the tart lemon filling.  I received much praise.  My mother and grandmother complimented me, which is nice because they are the pie pros.  I used regular sized unbaked pie crusts.  I am an amateur in the kitchen, so I didn't know where to get deep-dish.  This recipe was more than enough to fill two pie shells.  I will make this recipe again.  It will be great this summer.  Hope this helps. Enjoy!

Wow, this pie turned out great! We had a big Easter dinner with three different desserts, and this is the one that got the raves. The tart lemon topping is perfectly balanced by the creamy filling. Please note that it has to chill overnight. Luckily I happened to make it early in the morning, so it had time to set up before dinner. I used granulated sugar in the filling rather than powdered, and it still turned out fabulously. We will definitely make this one again; it's the perfect dessert to celebrate the spring season.

This is a wonderful recipe! I'm not a lemon lover but thought I'd stray from the usual chocolate desserts so I made it for the family Easter dinner and it was the most popular dessert on the table. I have requests to make it again for another dinner this week. Highly recommend this recipe.

I give it 5 stars for taste & 4 stars for ease of preperation.  My lemon topping did not seem as thick as it should be but tasted great.  I also used graham cracker crust but should have taken out more of the cream cheese mixture since it is not as deep as a traditional pie crust.

Used a standard graham cracker crust recipe with an egg white mixed in and prebaked.  Used whipped cream instead of whipped topping.  Left out coloring.  

All eight of us enjoyed it.  My children won't eat the lemon supreme  pie from a famous pie restaurant, but they loved this one!  Easier than I imagined.

Excellent recipe.  I made a couple of changes though. I used a springform pan and a graham cracker crust instead of the pastry shell.  The graham cracker crust can just line the bottom of the springform or line the bottom and sides about 1.5 inches up - both work great.

Made this for Christmas.  Everyone RAVED about it.  By popular demand, I'll be making 2 more for New Year's.  This is possibly the MOST FABULOUS pie I have ever tasted (and I know pie)! The only thing I changed was to add a tiny bit less lemon juice in the cream cheese part - but that's a personal preference thing b/c I don't like cheesecake that is too lemony.  Loved this pie!  Would give it 10 stars if I could!

Spectacular - fresh lemony zing mixed with sweet cream cheese layer.  I didn't use any of the cream cheese mixture on top so I only used 8 oz. of cream cheese and cut back on whipped cream.  Used less food coloring for more appetizing look.  I am craving this pie now and look forward to making it for the holidays.

This pie is spectacular! I've made it several times for everything from easter dinner to summer cook-outs and receive raves everytime. I always end up with extra that won't fit in my pie shell so I have a little stash of the filling to enjoy myself before serving. Yum.

This tasted very good, but just a tad sweeter than I would prefer. Also the presentation wasn't that great... the top looked slimy and messy and not smooth. But the overall consistency and taste was very good. I also had a hard time decorating this because the cream cheese mixture had a few little lumps in it, so it was hard to squeeze neatly through my decorating bag. Therefore remember to beat the cream cheese mixture for quite a while.

To prevent the messy look on top, make sure that when you spread the top mixture on the pie, that you make it as smooth as you can at that point, otherwise it hardens a bit and you cannot re-shape it later.

Very Good. Was a bit time consuming and you really needed to pay attention. Not a good thing to make if you have multiple things happening at once. I had enough filling for two pie shells.

I made a graham cracker crust and used a springform pan.  I didn't notice the instruction to chill overnight, oops...my lemon sauce wasn't setting so I popped it in the freezer for a bit before serving.  FABULOUS taste and presentation.  Can't wait for an occasion to make this again!

Great! Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I did make a boo boo and use sugar instead of icing sugar, where was my head? and it was still fabulous I also used real whipping cream.

Yummy!  We loved it.  I did add a bit more of the lemon juice then was called for because I love tart things.  This is definately a keeper.  Quick and easy!  Oh, and I used a graham cracker crust because that is what we like.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband and co-workers! I use a grahm cracker crust instead of regular crust. The lemon topping is also great on regular baked cheesecakes!

Made three different lemon pies, this one was GREAT, it was gone within minutes.  I will definately make this one again.
