2.17.20  I checked at 11 minutes, didn’t think they were quite  done (very soft when I touched the center of the cookie), baked for another four minutes,  and ended up with over baked cookies.  I baked the next batch for 12 minutes, which in my oven, was just about perfect.  The second batch was 100% better than the first.  As instructed, look for the browning around the edges, and do allow them to sit on the pan for  5 minutes before removing to a rack, at which time they will firm up.  Just DON’T overcook.  My first batch cookies are so dried out and hard (my bad, not the recipe's)  that they probably won’t get eaten.  These cookies are soft, chewy, fudgy, chocolaty, and a bit decadent.  I was very low on all types of chocolate chips, so I had to use  a combo of white, mini chocolate, and even a few butterscotch to get 1-1/2 cups (all was good, worked fine).  I also used a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop and ended up with 25 larger cookies.  These were good, would make again.
