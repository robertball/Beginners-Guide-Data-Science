Discoved that "mystery fruit" tree in my yard is a quince tree! This is the first quince recipe I've tried and it was pretty tasty. It even received Mom's approval for Thanksgiving this year!

Delicious! Served at a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, this chutney added a spicy dimension to cranberries that complemented the turkey, gravy, and stuffing. A great way to use quince--they kept a firmness that apples probably would not. You can adjust for your personal taste by decreasing the sugar and adjusting the spices.

I made this following the recipe exactly and LOVE it!  I’m so excited to serve this along with our Christmas Goose this year!  Now I’m torn between using the rest of my Quince for a crumble or making more of this to give out as gifts.  I saw the note about adding onions, if you want more savory than fruity, I could see that working well.  Personally I love this just the way it is.  The spices are a wonderful warm blend!  I don’t cook with allspice often, so I grind whole allspice as needed.  I think it, along with the quince are part of the magic in this recipe.

I had no idea what quinces were until a co-worker gave me a box full just before Thanksgiving. I came across this recipe, got some cranberries and voila...a tasty side for the upcoming feast. I'm not big on cloves so I left it out. This is pretty yummy and I will be gifting jars of it.

Waaaay too sweet and more like jam. Also a little too watery to my liking. After adding onions, more vinegar and doubling the quinces it turned out lovely (thought still on the sweet side). Very good with meat/poultry or Spanish /Italian white cheese on toast.

This is more like a jam but it is really good. I added another cup of sugar. It was a bit too tart and we do like it sweeter. Still nice and tart. Perfect for meat or squash. It yielded five half pints.
