With one cup of simple syup this is easily a 5 star recipe. And so easy. I'll never throw leftover watermelon away again.    Tip, go ahead and make your simple syrup as instructed, but only use 1 cup in the sorbet.  Save what's left in the fridge for mojitos or whatever strikes you.  We always keep some on hand.

Well, this was totally hard to rate. I looked at this recipe a few times before deciding to make and seriously read all the reviews. I started out with the 1:1cup ratio water and sugar, the 1/4 lime juice and I hard packed my watermelon in the measurements of 4 cups. I strained the pulp because my watermelon had seeds. I found that my melon was not that sweet...And the lime juice over powered the watermelon flavor. So I had to increase another 1:1cup water and sugar. Still tasted lime juice above the watermelon. So I added another 1:1cup water and sugar and then it wasn't sweet with watermelon flavor....Bottom line was this. I did the exact recipe but I ended up increasing the watermelon to 8 cups of packed watermelon to get the desired flavor. I think if your watermelon is to sweet, then adjust(decrease) your simple syrup ratio to accomendate, if your melon was like mine, you'll have to increase. This recipe is one you need to watch soley because of the watermelon. If I had realized my melon wasn't sweet, I would have just decreased the lime juice. My kids liked it, but my son said he liked it better as juice then frozen. I thought it was spot on the watermelon flavor when the recipe was done, but I would totally wait 24 hours before serving to make sure it's nice and firm. It melts way to quickly after a couple of hours and that was after I used an ice cream maker.

This recipe was way too sweet. I would suggest trying this with about 1/3 of the simple syrup, or less if you have a sweet enough melon.

Made this using the 1/3 cup simple syrup.  Huge, huge hit with my husband.  I still thought it was a little too sweet.

Just an addition--I bought two large watermelons at the end of last summer, made the simple syrup and added the blended watermelon.  Then I froze it in one quart containers (the same size as my ice cream machine).  We were able to have watermelon sorbet in the middle of winter simply by thawing the mixture and placing it in the ice cream machine and preceding with the recipe as follows.  Made my first batch for this summer today and my hubs is a very happy man.

I agree that, written as is, this sorbet would be terribly sweet. I used one cup of simple syrup and almost five cups of watermelon, and it's still pretty sweet, but also really refreshing. I didn't use an ice cream maker, just poured the mixture into a shallow dish and froze it. Then, once it's frozen, you can either scrape it with a fork or put it in a food processor. (Keep in mind that it melts very quickly.) Also, after combining the watermelon pulp with the simple syrup and lime juice, I pressed it through a sieve to get rid of the solids. Because, even though the watermelons say they're 'seedless', they still have those pesky white seeds that would make for an unappetizing final product.

Awesome!  Decrease the sugar a little or try some Agave Nectar instead.

as is three stars. i tasted the mixture before i froze it and as is TOO SWEET. to remedy it and not waste it i added double the watermelon which i just smashed with a potato masher and didnt do the whole food processor step. i just smashed the watermelon ( 8 cups for the amount of simple syrup specified) and kept the lime juice the same and froze it in those popsicle maker things and dixie cups. my daughter loves these and we didnt waste any watermelon. i think this would also work with canteloupe or peaches its a good starting point.

II ended up with a dud watermelon from the grocery store- it was basically pink and not suitable for eating as a snack- I came accross this recipe and was able to salvage said $6 watermelon! I also cut the syrup ration by half and it was a hit! Will make again!

Definitely decrease the syrup content and it is plenty sweet.  I used 1 1/4 c simple syrup and added an extra Tablespoon of lime juice for tartness.  I did not strain this as others suggested and it was fine.  The few white seeds I missed were floating at the top of the food processed watermelon, and I simply skimmed them off.  For best consistency, make in an ice cream maker, then freeze in a tightly covered container for 2-3 hours, opening to stir a few times while freezing.  Plan to eat that day.  If you freeze this overnight it becomes fairly hard and the texture is that of italian ice.  Overall a nice inexpensive and simple recipe and a great way to use up extra watermelon!

Very nice and refreshing! It feels like you're cheating! I would have rated this 5 stars but I added a few things. I used a little less water for my simple syrup, 2 1/2 cups instead. Also, I added a dash of salt. It really brings out the watermelon flavor! YUM!

It was very good and very refreshing.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 beause you do have to change the recipe some.  After reading the reviews I did cut the water/sugar to 1 cup to the 4 cups of watermelon.  And at 1 cup it was still very sweet, I can't imagine if i would of used the 3 called for in the recipe!  I also cut the lime juice - I did not want a tart sorbet so I only used one Tablespoon of the lime juice.  With those changes it was wonderful.  Made it in my ice cream maker and the texture was perfect.

1cup of sugar, not 3. I could not imagine using 3 cups if sugar, especially with a really nice, sweet melon. I made it using one cup of sugar (thanks reviewers) and it is delicious and refreshing. Family loves it! Have to give it 4 stars because the way the recipe is written.

I was amazed by how simple this recipe was! It's a great thing to make on a hot summer day, however, the only minor detail was it turned out more like a slushie, but still very refreshing! It was also sweeter than expected, but in my opinion, it complements the acidity of the lime, so overall it was really good and I WILL make it again!

It's mostly been said already but this is how I made it:

1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 4 cups of watermelon, a generous squirt of lime and I added Salt.  

It got rave reviews, I think the salt really added to the flavor.  

And, I think I'll use less sugar next time.
