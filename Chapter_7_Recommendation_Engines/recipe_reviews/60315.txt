1.  Rather than grinding, I prefer to start with a whole fresh filet and separate the meat from the fascia by scraping it with the edge of a sharp knife. There is no comparison with respect to texture, presentation and flavour.
2. I prefer Pikapeppa Sauce or Cholula to Tabasco; both have superior flavour and complexity.  For a nicer presentation a food mold can be used.
3.  Adding brandy is an excellent idea, especially something interesting  like Calvados.
4. The quality and freshness of the ingredients cannot be overemphasized.
5. The basic recipe can then be taken in a number of flavour and presentation directions with garnishes and condiments.
6.  Scallions, minced cucumber, bell pepper (any colour), capers, duxelles, chopped hard boiled egg (if you are leery about using raw eggs), etc. can be served on the side.
7. An assortment of red, green and black cornichons (peppercorns) can add colour to the presentation.
8. Greek Tzatziki (a mild dressing of yogurt and cucumber), or a light horseradish sauce will add additional zest if desired.
9.  As with Sushi, however, be careful not to overpower the basic delicate flavour of this dish.
10. Flatbread, lightly oiled and pan-fried, makes a nice alternative to the usual toast points or crackers.

If you love steak Tartare and cannot not find it in restaurants any more, this is the answer. Eggs and beef do have to be fresh. I buy the freshed beef and have the butcher grind it.

This is a once in a blue moon treat for my hubby and I. I'm not a meat eater, but this is the exception. I will only buy the meat from our German butcher and have him grind it. There were a couple of ingredients in this recipe that I normally don't use and I must say that they were nice additions. I don't care for egg in this so I skipped it and added finely minced onion. We served this on buttered Russian rye bread. Most German restaurants and Oktoberfests will no longer serve this, so it's nice to be able to make it at home. Delicious and thanks, Itsi.

Not sure where Steak Tartare originated, but what I do remember is how much I enjoyed it at the Russian Tea Room and Buzzy O'Keefe's Grand Central Cafe when I worked in midtown Manhattan back in the 70's.  To my recollection, neither recipe included brandy. But both had tabasco, a couple of anchovies and capers....which I include whenever I make it.  Even back then ordering raw beef with raw egg raised eyebrows, but it was delicious, especially with a cut of beef that had some marbelling (but not too much).   I know some think you should stay away from supermarket eggs, but I think the whole raw egg fear is overkill. Yeah, you're taking risks, but you're also taking risks with raw beef.

I've been looking for a recipe for Beef Tartare. This is excellent. Use ONLY ground tenderloin and make sure it is VERY fresh. You are risking illness with eggs, but if they are fresh the chances are pretty remote. This is delicious and 100% authentic.

My husband made X rated noises while eating this, so I'll have to assume it was awesome, as I'm way too much of a ninny to try it. I'm making it again for him on father's day so long as I can get some more yard eggs (don't trust grocery store eggs for this recipe).

Just outstanding! I will write-out and post the recipie on my kitchen wall, till I "own" the formula.

I scaled back to a single, carnivore's meal.
Except; no hot pepper, and I drank the brandy.
Oh! I ground lean, well trimmed 1" round steak, thru a 3/16 grinder screen. The rest was saved for beef stew. 

I raise and butcher my own Holstien Beef. The tenderloins were cut as Porterhouse Steaks.

After separating the meat, i used my kitchenaid meat grinder to grind the tenderloin on the fine setting.  Then mixed in ONLY the mustard, warshishire, capers, salt and pepper.  I am allergic to eggs and don't care for onions. My husband had finely chopped onions on the side for his and we also had the hot sauce on the side to try.  after mixing all the ingredients in, we put it back in the freezer for about 10 minutes to cool it and let it rest.  we served it on lightly toasted baguettes and it was DIVINE!

As is, this recipe is just ok. I doubled the condiments for the same amount of beef and still thought it was just ok. It seems as though it is missing something-like capers and a bit of garlic. Thank you for your recipe.

I only used ground tenderloin, 1 beaten egg, salt and pepper and a half finely chopped shallot, mixed it all together, put into the fridge for 30 minutes. Toasted a slice of vollkorn bread, spread it with unsalted butter and then added the steak tartare. Totally delicious

Chopped the organic tenderloin, but not too finely. In addition to the recipe added a tiny amount of diced onion and garlic, plus a half-dozen capers. A++

The store's butcher (of one of the most celebrated chains in the business) advised me to select the vacuum-sealed fresh meat from a national distributor and not the store's beautiful cuts on display, as the meats are not mixed in slicing and the standards are always high.
