Easy and tasty recipe!!  The soup has great and is even better the second day.  The fennel is not overpowering.I used light half and half and it turned out well.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  This was absolutely delicious.  I haven't had a meal this good in a while.

I had to make a couple of adjustments from this recipe due to not being able to find the exact ingredients. It's still extremely close! 

Because bulb fennel doesn't seem to be in season, I used about 3 celery stalks & 2 tsps of crushed fennel seed. They also didn't have crimini mushrooms so I used baby portabella mushrooms instead. I also used 1/2 cup cream sherry instead of 1/4 and a bit more red bell pepper than the recipe calls for. Oh and no butter. Just olive oil. :) 

I can't wait for lunch tomorrow. (leftovers)

Amazingly quick soup.  My husband adored the buttermilk taste.  I added sauted celery and onion to increase the vegetation of the soup.

I found this to be fast and tasty.  Be advised that it is very hardy and filling.  I served it with fresh vegies and a dip.  We were stuffed, without eating too many vegies.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it is awesome!  The only change I made was adding a little grated parmesan cheese on top before serving.
Thank you!  This one's for company.

Greatly disappointed. After reading the reviews here I thought I'd found the master vehicle for my fresh organic fennel. Instead I was underwhelmed by this thin, earthy-tasting soup. The flavors blend strangely. The tang of buttermilk is interesting but I'm not impressed with this dish in the least. It reminds me of a poor attempt at the famous Thai soup Thom Kha.

This is a good start, but I wasn't completely happy with it.  I made it while trying to get rid of some extra fennel.  The directions on what to do with the chicken are a little confusing.  Your best bet is to sautee the chicken in a saucepan with butter, onion, garlic, and a bit of sherry, mix the other ingredients in a separate stock pot and build the soup from there.  Also, instead of soup base and water, why not just use chicken stock, so you can skip the water and avoid additives like msg?  The broth was a bit bland at first, so I added black pepper and red pepper flakes.  Also, instead of buttermilk AND half & half (which seems unnecessarily complicated), it might just be quicker to use heavy cream.  Or just half & half.    I also saw this question: Cream Sherry is a type of sweet sherry blend that is available in the booze aisle.

This soup is sooooo good!!! The nice thing about it is that you can change a few things & it still won't lose it's "purity". I used celery instead fennel & didn't have "cream sherry" so used Marsala. It was still very, very good. Definitely a repeat!! Thanks

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe and I followed  it to the 'T' which is unusual for me.  Maybe I didn't simmer the fennel long enough as it was pretty crunchy.  The flavor was nice enough, however not like I thought it would be after reading the reviews.  I would like it to be a bit thicker too - hubby  asked if it was supposed to be this watery.  Will try it again with a few adjustments for our tastes and review it again.  Thks for sharing.

Made a couple of changes due to personal preferences - omitted the parsley and red bell pepper (not a fan of either) and used marsala wine instead of sherry as that's what I had on hand. Like another reviewer, I topped the soup with a little Parmesan cheese. The soup could have done with being a tad thicker, but it tasted great nonetheless. Thanks, Linda!

Simple fast and delicious. I had some ground chicken that needed to be used, so I substituted that for the chicken breasts and it worked out perfectly. This is my first time using fennel and I was impressed by how mild it tasted. It's got just a hint of flavor that leaves your mouth feeling clean and your tummy satisfied.

Amazing!  Light, rich, creamy all at the same time plus I get mushrooms and sherry.  I traded the fresh parsley for tarragon and everyone who's tasted this has fallen in love.

This is an easy, delicious soup!  For a first time fennel user, I am glad I picked this recipe.  I followed the recipe all the way to the cooking of the veggies where I cooked them longer, till they were done, before I added the cream & buttermilk.  
I used a heavy bottomed dutch oven to brown the chicken breasts & browned them well on the outside, they were a little pink inside yet when i tore them up, but cooked with the veggies later.  then just continued in that pot to get all the flavor from the bottom.  Fantastic! 
It is even better the next day as the lemon pepper seems to come forth more giving it just the slightest heat.  Some reviewed it as too thin,  I think the thinness is partly what makes it such an elegant soup.  I will make this again & again and I will not change anything!   Thank you for a wonderful recipe :D

Wonderful rich soup.  Only changes I make are to sear the chicken in oil and about 4 cloves minced garlic, and to double the water/chicken stock because we all love the broth. Healthy, hearty, and delicious.  I've never served this to anyone who has not asked for the recipe.  Thanks so much for posting it.

To the person who wondered how this recipe came out - well, wonderful is the first word that comes to mind.  It was my first time cooking with whole fennel as well as wine.  I got Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry - might as well get the best to create the best.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It will make you feel like you graduated from Le Cordon Bleu!!!

This soup was awesome!  My 2 year old could not stop saying yummy yummy while he inhaled it and then asked for more.  I did make a lot of changes though.  It seems to be a very forgiving recipe.  I doubled all of the liquid ingredients and the soup base.  I added the water and soup base with the sherry to cook the chicken.  I left out the red bell pepper and added diced carrots, celery and shallots that I had sauteed in garlic and olive oil.  I also used fresh lemon zest and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper.  I served it with cooked wild rice that everyone could add to their liking.  Had I known it would be so good, I would have made more!

Not a fan, the chicken was too dry. Otherwise the flavor was good, but if I were to try this recipe again I would use dark meat and not breasts.

Excellent.  I made a few additions:  1 onion, diced; 1 carrot; 1 potato; sliced thin; and 1/2 c. brown rice.  I substituted bouillion cubes for the soup base and doubled the sherry.  I simmered it all on very low heat, covered, for about an hour and ended up adding about 50% more buttermilk, half&half, and water since the potatoes thickened the broth a bit.  Definitely a winner!  My brother, who is not the most adventurous eater, said that this was amazing.  Will be making it again!

Delicate and subtle. I used a little less fennel than called for, used dried Chanterelle mushrooms that I had in the house, and a bit of garlic salt. As I had no sherry, I substituted white wine. I look forward to making this again with the sherry. We loved it!

I can't really rate this recipe. I totally changed it into a kinda creamy stir fry over rice. 
Used cubed chicken, mushrooms, red pepper, celery, lemon pepper
Then sherry ... A little corn starch in the cream  and presto. Sherried chicken over rice. 
Just sharing, I'm sure the soup is great. I wish I had fennel on hand. Maybe next time.

I made this soup and served it with chicken salad sandwiches.  My husband and I both loved it!  I did not use the cream sherry and I used baby bella mushrooms but otherwise followed this recipe.

My husband and I got fennel in our CSA box had no idea how to use it...Thank goodness for this recipe! This was my first time cooking with fennel and I was really scared of the licorice taste. Surprisingly once the fennel was cooked it was extremely similiar tasting to cooked onion or celery-- super easy to eat! I can't do bouillion because of the MSG, so I ommitted it along with the 1.5c water. This resulted in more of a stroganoff effect which I anticipated and served over some fancy brown rice. I also simplified the cooking process a bit. I used a saucepan and sauteed the chicken (used 5 drumsticks) with the butter&oil and when it was about half cooked through I added 3 cloves chopped garlic, lemon pepper, regular sherry (1/2c), sliced fennel, diced onion and cooked it until chicken and veggies were near done, then added mushrooms and red bell peppers. Cooked it until they were al dente. I then removed the pan from the heat and took the drumsticks out, removed bones and skin (saved for stock making later) and reintroduced the meat and other remaining ingredients (buttermilk, 1/2&1/2, parsley). I cooked it only long enough to heat it through, but not boil it. 

I would definetly make this again, but next time use more mushrooms because it definetly wouldn't hurt this dish. I would like to try it again with white meat because deboning drumsticks is a bit labor intensive. It is loaded with calories, but we're healthy eaters otherwise and didn't mind the splurge. :)

Great start.  I added asparagus and kale.  I also made a bit of a reaux w/ the chicken which I cooked in garlic and onion chunks to thicken it a bit.  Added a lot of spices and it was very good.
