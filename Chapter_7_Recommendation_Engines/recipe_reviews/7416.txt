Tastes like chocolate cake from a mix - no one knew the difference - it was moist and tasted even better the next day. I did increase cocoa to almost 2/3 cup (and could have added more), used only 1 cup mayo (definitely does not need more than this) and increased vanilla to 2tsp., also added 1/4 tsp salt (I find chocolate flavor is always stronger with a little salt in recipe). Hope this helps.

When I was young my Great Grand Mother used to make a chocolate mayonnaise cake that I couldn't get enough of. I read reviews about this recipe being too gooey. That is the way they are supposed to be. This was as close to my Grandmas as it gets. I fixed this about a week ago. Their are only two of us and my wife doesn't really like chocolate much. She had one piece and liked it. I finished it up this morning and I am contemplating baking another for Sunday and asking my grown kids over. I think everyone needs to try this. It is fantastic.

Not exactly like my grandmothers used to be ( was kind of a cross between and cake mix and mayo cake) but this did bring back memories, thanks for sharing. I did use miracle whip instead of mayo because that's how my grandmother always made hers, followed the rest exactly but cooked in 9x13 pan for 45 mins.

I made this for my mothers birthday as she hadn't had a Mayo cake since she was a little girl. I used coffee instead of water and I used cocoa powder to coat the pan. I also used the Whipped cream cheese frosting from this site. EVeryone who tried it said that it was the best cake they had ever had! THank you!!

I increased the cocoa to 2/3 a cup, decreased the mayo to 1 cup, and used coffee instead of water. I baked these at 375 for 20 minutes to make 24 cupcakes total. I topped them with a swirl of vanilla glaze (also here on allrecipes) that gave them that edge of sweetness without overpowering the taste. Delicious! Thanks for sharing- like a little taste of childhood.

I make this cake for all occasions and people always LOVE it, even my husband that isn't a big fan of chocolate cake.  I think the big difference in this recipe is that it calls for Mayo and I have always used MIRACLE WHIP.  There is a big difference between the 2 so next time you try this recipe try with Miracle whip instead(use the exact same amount as you would for mayo).

I added about a tablespoon extra of cocoa powder and just a dash of cinnamon and topped with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe...one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had!

This recipe reminds me of a chocolate cake recipe from my childhood except this one is lighter and moister!  I used Dukes light mayo and two tsp of vanilla and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes.  It was an easy, easy recipe I quickly made with my 5 yr old!

It was very light and fluffy, almost like a store cake mix.  My son has allergies and he can even have this cake.

Very, very good! Moist texture was the star. The lack of deep chocolate flavor can be fixed by 1) increasing cocoa to 1/2 cup and 2) adding 1/2 tsp salt to the recipe. Without the salt, the chocolate flavor lacks the complexity and depth that our palates associate with true chocolate taste. The first time I made it, we felt something was missing. That something was salt. Once those two measures are put into action, this recipe becomes darn near perfect. Any frosting/glaze will work to finish it. I used the glaze that I usually put on my Texas Sheet Cake. I baked it in a 11"X17" jelly roll pan, and it was done perfectly at 23 minutes. Big enough to feed a crowd. Super easy to throw together, almost as easy as a cake mix, but worlds better. Helped me to meet a promise I made to someone to make "something chocolate" when I found myself disappointingly eggless the night before I was supposed to deliver on said promise. And, thanks to this recipe, I did so in spades! It freezes well. Because of the need for adjustment, particularly because of the omission of necessary salt, it narrowly misses a 5 star rating. Will now be making this on many occasions, even when I have eggs in the fridge. It's that good.

we could taste the Mayo.  It was very soft and moist though.  Maybe a different brand of mayo would have tasted better, but I'm not going to try it again.

I increased the cocoa to 1 cup, like others have recommended, but 1 big difference is to NOT use water.  Use milk!  Naturally brings out a richer chocolate flavor.  I added a little more milk to get the usual cake consistency & to offset the extra cocoa powder.  Decrease the cooking time slightly as I noticed milk cooks faster.  I also made my own mayonnaise using Allrecipes instructions (1 egg yolk beaten with 2 tables lemon juice and slowly whisk in 1 cup extra virgin olive oil).  I don't eat soy so store bought mayo just won't do! :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

delicious !   I had a similar recipe that I used for 30 or so years.  I quit making so many sweets, with the children grown & gone & somehow lost my recipe.  My son & family were here for his birthday & he requested his favorite cake, you guessed it  !!!!  Looked on Allrecipes & this looked like the closest to what I used to make.   I used Miracle Whip, since that's what I remember using & increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup plus 1 tble.  It was fantastic.  I frosted with the recipe on the back of Hersheys cocoa & it was  perfect.  This cake is moist & delicious !!!

I found this recipe about forty years ago in a magazine and used it for many years.  Lost it along with many of my treasured recipes when my home was taken in a tornado and was glad to have found it, my husband loves this cake, thanks for sharing.

This cake is so moist and a very yummy chocolate taste. My mom used to make this when i was a kid. I loved it then and i love it now. I made it with coffee instead of water as another reviewer suggested. Made mine in a 9 by 12 pan. I used the "whipping cream cream cheese frosting" in this site, also as another reviewer suggested and this is the best frosting, the frosting is light and goes well with this cake. Going to make another cake this afternoon.

I followed another reviewer's advice and reduced the mayo. I made this recipe into cupcakes, and was really impressed by how beautifully they rose with nice dome tops. Also, they were at the perfect moisture! I frosted them with my favourite fudge frosting recipe, but I recommend you choose a lighter frosting than I did as the cakes themselves were very heavy--combined with the rich frosting I used it was hard to finish even one. The next time I make this cake I'll experiment with increasing the cocoa (could have used a bit stronger cocoa taste) as well as adding a bit more sugar and vanilla for flavour.

Edible. I reduced the mayo to 1 cup as recommended by others (to avoid gumminess), used extra dark cocoa powder, and a mix of cake flour and white wheat flour. Used Hellman's regular mayonnaise. (Would be good if all future reviewers would include type of mayo used, since they do vary widely.)

Results: crumbly (but moist) cake with a somewhat... odd flavor. Definitely not the best tasting cake I've ever had. Perhaps the white wheat flour didn't go well with the mayo... that's all I can figure.

I'm currently soaking the cake in a rum syrup to try to improve the flavor.

Oh, also added a few chocolate chips, which really seems to help.

We were worried this would taste like MAYO but it didn't at all even though the batter did. We used Whole Foods 365 Mayo(expeller pressed canola oil. However we only used 1 cup mayo instead of 1 and a half. We also added another tablespoon of cocoa and baked it in two 9" glass pie dishes for suggested time. It was moist but somewhat dense. Absolutely delicious with butter icing!

This was a very good chocolate cake.  I increased the cocoa to 1 cup, and used 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and used 1 cup mayonnaise. The cake was moist, and yet would be great to work with in the way of carving.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent. Made this in a pinch when I had no eggs but wanted a choc cake. I was afraid it would taste like mayonnaise because the batter has a pronounced mayo taste...but when baked there is no trace of mayo flavor. No one will know you used mayonnaise! I also added  3/4 c mini choc chips before baking, and a chocolate glaze to pump up the chocolate. Thank you!

This cake had a tight crumb but was airy, like something made from cake mix.  The chocolate flavor was also light and creamy, but not bland.  However, this cake isn't good enough to justify all the fat and calories.  I'm going to stick with other cakes that have a comprable taste but less fat.

This was my first Mayo cake.  I found it to be very rubbery and quite heavy.

Not a typical chocolate cake

My family often uses Miracle Whip instead of mayo. The Miracle Whip has a little bit sweeter taste. This is my favorite birthday cake!

This is an awesome cake, although it was a little heavy, so I used 1 cup of mayo instead of what it calls for.  But other than that, it's wonderful alternative to regular cake!  My kids love this cake for their birthdays!

I wasn't the biggest fan of this recipe, but I only made it cause I had mayo to use up.  It tasted a little bland, so I did increase the cocoa to one cup and added some sugar.  Still not my favorite.  I topped it with a sweet peanut butter frosting which helped a little.

First time I made this cake. I have added mayo to cake mixes before. I knew it would be good. Followed the recipe exactly and added a handful of chocolate chips, as someone had suggested. Cake came out great. Thought the chips might get hard, but did not. Something different to add, if just for fun. Excellent, simple cake for those who can't handle eggs, or don't have butter etc... Loved it. Frosted it with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting". Also a first. Delish!

Followed the exact ingredients and this was the dryest cake I have ever made!  We were so dissappointed since it had great reviews and a 4.5 star rating!  Made the cake for a birthday.  If  you are going to take this cake somewhere or making it for a special occassion, test it first-don't be surprised by the outcome before it's too late.

My cake came out dry and crumbled into bits.  The flavor was horrible; no one finished their piece.  The rest is going in the trash.  I'm known for baking great desserts but this wasn't one of them.

This was SO good. I doubled the cocoa, and it came out wonderfully. It hit the spot, for sure. I make an easy powder sugar frosting to top it was and was surprised how well it worked since it would not have been my first choice as frosting. There is no way that I am not making this again! Your family recipe has become my family recipe! Thanks!

I grew up with mayo cake and always loved it.  This recipe is just like my mom used to make!  Mayo cake is rich and dense, that is how it is supposed to be.  Mom used to frost with peanutbutter frosting, but I used store bought cream cheese frosting and it was great!  Thanks!

i don't usually make cakes, but i felt like a little dessert one night when i was overdue to go grocery shopping...  didn't have much in the fridge, but i DID have mayo and JUST enough king arthur's traditional whole wheat flour to whip up a half batch o' this here cake (thank you serving changer tool).  actually i didn't even have all the EXACT ingredients... but the cake turned out fluffy, tasty and super moist nonetheless.  (didn't have all-purpose flour, baking soda, or cocoa powder, so i substituted in whole wheat flour, carob powder, and used baking powder all around) baked my half batch in two mini bread pans that i got from wholefoods (in a set of four)

not everyone may need/want to "botch" the recipe as much as i did, but a healthy addition for all would definitely be using whole wheat flour; the cake's got chocolate in it, so the color won't be a dead give away like if it were white cake, and the robust wheaty flavor will also be masked by mr. chocolate.

-- keep baking and get creative

I loved mayo cake as a little kid and so glad I have found another great recipe for it.  I did make a few slight changes to make it my own.  I added a bit extra cocoa, and only used about 1 1/4 cups mayo.  Instead of water I used coffee.   I also added my own spin by mixing about 1/4 cup peanut butter with coffee(enough to make peanut butter the consistency of a batter) and then swirled that throughout the cake.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday because it was the recipe her mother used to make for her as a child.  Everybody loved it!  I added a little more cocoa just because I love the flavor of cocoa in a cake, and I might even add a touch of cinnamon next time when I make it.  I used the "Perfectly Chocolate" icing recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa box and it complemented it perfectly and looked great on it.  Definitely give it a try.

I love this cake!  My grandma used to make a mayonnaise cake, and this recipe is just what I was looking for.  It tastes incredible with the Chocolate Frosting I recipe submitted by Tia the Baker.  So dense, rich, and moist!

I have made other cakes with mayonnaise and they all turned out great!  This cake is no exception...it was easy to make and tasted great!  I opted for the cream cheese frosting as I am not such a chocolate cake/chocolate frosting fan and it was delicious!  My husband is not a cake fan but even he liked it!  Thank you for this great recipe!

I didn't like this at all. The cake was bland and not flavorful. I made a mayo cake when we were living overseas and I didn't have access to ready made cake mix and it was amazing. I am sure that recipe called for coffee. I will keep searching until I find it again.

This beats my old recipe by leaps and bounds!!  It is the best chocolate cake in the world.  It is so moist! Someone said it tasted like a "cake mix"..come on..I've never used a boxed mix that was this good. My old recipe was my mother in laws..this is way better than hers...hee..hee!

This is such a great recipe, my family loves to make cupcakes with it. But I usually only use 1 cup of mayonnaise for the cupcakes, otherwise they just fall apart. They are so decadent with real chocolate icing. I have recommended this recipe to all my friends. Let's keep it going.

Gummy was a good word that someone else described this as.  Yummy, but mainly b/c I haven't had chocolate cake since my nursing daughter started having a reaction to dairy in my diet.  Update: I'm not sure why, but these have a baking soda taste. Will have to try cutting that amount in half.

This cake is the most moist cake I have ever had! And, it was delicious!!!! We recently had a dairy allergy appear in our family and this cake is a great alternative to the many sweets containing butter or milk, which we can no longer have. We sprinkled a little powdered sugar on the top of the cake after it had cooled, and it was wonderful!

Mayo has become my secret add in ingredient with chocolate cakes. It really does make them much more moist and fluffy and people who dislike mayo in general don't even mind that it's in there.

Great recipe.  Used miracle whip and cut back on the sugar a little.  extremely moist, and I disagree it was heavy.  It was dense like mayo cake should be.

Quick and very easy. This cake is moist and has a lighter chocolate flavor. The taste is different yet hard to stop eating. You can't get enough (especially with ample amounts of chocolate frosting) yum

This was my first time making a mayonnaise cake, and I made it exactly as written, but I thought it was dry.  The only thing saving it was my chocolate frosting, but I wouldn't make this again. The Wacky cake is moister than this. I'll stick to that.

This is incredibly moist and delicious. Chocolate flavor benefits by increasing the natural unsweetened cocoa powder to 1/2 cup.  After adding mayonnaise, the dry ingredients need to be worked to incorporate the mayonnaise, until all dried ingredients are uniformly moistened & all leavening clumps are "smushed" and well-distributed into the moistened mass. It is not a batter at this point, but a "crumbly" mass, barely moistened. Use 3 teaspoons instant coffee granules in the 12 oz water, adding all liquid at one time to bowl. Stir, scraping bowl, to thoroughly distribute liquid and create a batter. Trade scraper for whisk, and beat ingredients for 2 minutes with whisk. Scrape whisk wires. Pour into prepared pans and bake as directed. Each pan will use approximately 1 lb 8-1/2 oz batter.  Cool 5 minutes in pans, then invert on racks and place in freezer for 30 minutes to speed cool before frosting and filling layers. Handle gently when removing from pans, as cake will crumble easily if handled without support of racks.

I remember my grandma making a mayonaise chocolate cake. Granted, it says to frost the cake, but I remembered it being a chocolaty cake. I tried this recipe. I even added more cocoa. Definitely not flavorful enough without frosting.

This is the exact recipe I requested for my Mother to make for me every birthday growing up. She has been gone many years, so now I'm making it for my 53rd birthday. Each bite will bring back precious memories of my wonderful Mother and all the Mayonnaise Cakes she made for my birthdays.

This recipe made a very thick batter, almost like brownie batter.  Next time I'll mix it with a wooden spoon instead of a whisk!  I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup (only to finish up what was in the container), but I think the original recipe amount may have been alright.    Otherwise, I used milk instead of water as suggested by another reviewer.  Baked in a bundt pan, which took about 45 to 50 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean.  Flipped it out of the pan about 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven, then waited another 15 minutes or so then covered it with plastic wrap (this helps retain moisture as it cools and helps make extremely moist cakes - I've made this a habit with my bundt cakes).  The look of the cake was dark and beautiful.  It was extremely moist and tasty.  As for the people who claim they could taste the mayo, I'm not sure what they're doing.  I used Kraft Real Mayo and could NOT taste it in the uncooked batter nor in the finished cake.  Served to a small group with cream cheese icing on the side (I find icing too sweet) to allow others to get the amount of icing they desired.  This recipe is a keeper.

This cake is moist and super delicious! The video was vague on coating the cake pans with the powdered cocoa amount.  My first cakes failed- theybroke apart trying to get them out of the pan. On the second attempt I increased both the greasing of the pans and the cocoa powder. It worked much better. All in all a wonderful cake

I made 22 cupcakes. i used gf baking flour, 1 C vegan mayo, so i used 1egg. raisins for sweetness, erythritol and coconut sugar, but less than 1 1/2 C. anc coffee instead of water.   it would have turned out better however I stirred it too long and the gluten-free flour did not like this, so I had to add a bit more water. They turned out well and I’m sure they will be much better when I follow the exact recipe next time except still using vegan mayo, and maybe even chocolate chips.

I've made this cake for years and when making wedding /special occasion cakes, I use milk instead of water and double the cocoa powder.  Trust me on this.  My specialty is to make this rich cake with peanut butter fudge between layers.  Folks can't get enough of it!  Try it!

To me, it needed more sugar, so I added half a cup more sugar and baked it longer, on 350 degrees F for 45 minutes for a bundt pan. It turned out delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

I always find this to be a very moist cake...i have been making it for years and it was always a favourite for birthdays....I only use Hellmann's mayonnaise...maybe a cheaper one is why people are tasting the mayo, because i have definitely never tasted it....make sure you are using MAYO and not miracle whip...that cr*p you would definitely taste I would think.

On the day of baking I found it to be dry and having a very bland taste. I had thought that maybe I had over cooked it but having read the reviews and trying it the day after baking , it is much better. I will try again.

I have been making a chocolate mayonnaise cake for nearly 50 years!  I am sure this is a good recipe, but if I may be so bold, I am also quite sure it is not a great recipe!  My recipe is identical, except for the fact that it contains 2/3 cup of cocoa, instead of 1/3 cup.  That makes all the difference in the world!  If you look at the picture, it is clear that this is not a very chocolatey cake.  Why not try adding 1/3 extra cocoa to this recipe?  I think you'll like it very much.

very dense  the texture reminded me of moon sand (kids playdough). while very moist when you go to slice it, it sort of smushes. never had a cake like this and i even followed some of the advice found here. i used coffee, added 1/8 salt and increased cocoa to 1/2 c.

If the best the most positive review  can say is, "tastes like chocolate cake from a mix - no one knew the difference", as if the goal is to taste like a box mix, then why bother?  Box mixes are cheap and fast.  I don't want my cake to taste like it came out of a box.

I have my mom's recipe for this; the amounts in my recipe are less and the biggest difference is I dissolve the cocoa in the water; it helps so you don't get an overwhelming taste of the unsweetened cocoa.

This cake and the one bowl buttercream frosting work well together my family just loves this cake. It is easy, moist, delicious, and just the right amount of chocolate( I still add a little more, chocolate fan). This is one cake that the family will love every time its made.

I made this for my husband who had fond childhood memories of the "mayonnaise" cakes his mother used to make.  I used mayonnaise, and cut the amount to 1 cup as many of the reviews suggested.  BIG MISTAKE.  The old-fashioned mayonnaise cakes were made with Miracle Whip, which (I had forgotten) we used to call "mayonnaise".  I do not recommend cutting down on the amount, either, as the cake was too dry.  He said you are supposed to slightly taste the Miracle Whip in the cake, and they are supposed to be dense and very moist.  One change I made for the better was to use 2/3 cup cocoa instead of 1/3.  I'll have to try it again, practice makes perfect!

This cake is so good that even my sister-inlaw love it, and she hates cake. She makes me make her this cake on her birthday every year. I like to use cake flour instead of all-purpose to give it a nice fluffy texture.

I was very fond of this cake, but my hubby, who doesn't like mayo, said it tasted too much like mayo. It seemed a tad greasy, too. But definitely a tasty cake. Next time, I may do some experimenting and drop the amount of mayo a little bit.

I also doctor this up a bit but I do think the basic recipe is quite good. I would not be without a container of cocoa powder in the house since finding these sorts of recipes.

This sounds like it came from my Mom's "old standby's!" She said the reason she wrote it out for me as 1 1/2 C. of the main ingredients was that she didn't have a measuring cup! So she used a pint canning jar (Also used as drinking glasses then!) and filled it to the brim. It was great to see it here, virtually uncorrupted. Thanks! Great recipe!

Enjoyed this cake!  I added pecans to the batter from my mother-in-laws trees and it was delicious with a dollop of fat-free whipped topping.  It rose nicely....good recipe.  No need for a boxed chocolate mix.

First time trying out this recipe and with the changes annie111 suggested, my cake come out really soft and fluffy. Tasted good too and no one could even tell there was mayo in there. It was just a teeny weeny bit dry and yes it was just a weee bit crumbly too but it was good chocolate cake. Two thumbs up for a chocolate cake recipe I can use when lacking eggs and butter :D

This makes a wonderful moist cake, tastes like a chocolate bar! I lost my copy of a similar recipe, which calls for 2 tablespoons of grape jelly (don't know why!)so thanks for this one. My daughter has been nagging for a mayo cake, so this is the recipe she will get!

Very good. I needed something for my son who cannot have dairy products. This fit the bill. Now I just need to find a decent dairy-free frosting!

This a great moist cake! I divided by two to make one 9" round cake. Used 1 cup mayonnaise, 2/3 cup cocoa and 1 1/2 cup coffee+water mixture, it turned out heavenly! Everyone could not believe there was mayonnaise, not a single sign of sourness from the mayo!

Looked good but maintained a "mayonaisse-y" taste even after baking.  Even smothered with frosting it was not our favorite.

Very good cake - light and fluffy.  I used fat free mayo and thought it came out quite nice.  Thank you.

Excellent Cake....I thought that this is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  I made a cooked chocolate fudge icing. I will be making this one for years to come. Thank you for the recipe. God bless you :)

Disappointing, I didn't care for the consistency or taste of this cake.  The texture was a little gummy and the chocolate flavor was lacking.

I had higher hopes for this cake.  The color was nice and dark, but the cake wasn't sweet enough.  I found the texture to be a little gummy.  Tasted better the second day.

The Cake was good but it cracked. Think next time I might try cooking it for only 20-25 mins.

I really liked the taste of this cake but found it extremely heavy and dense.  I don't think I would make it again.
