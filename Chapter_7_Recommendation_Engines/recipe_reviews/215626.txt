I saw this and HAD to make it right away. What I did is threw everything in my blender, ran it through to a even consistancy and dumped it in a flat freezable container, let it firm up, then blended it again. When it firmed up the second time, it was ready to go. I used my own homemade sugar free maple syrup and one teaspoon of my homemade pumpkin pie spice. This is MONEY. My kids and I LOVED it. Thank you so much for sharing this low-calorie treat! NOTEL You can get away with using half the amount of syrup and still have it be sweet enough. If you aren't a fan of maple syrup, you could substitute honey of agave nectar and have it taste really good, too.

As this is written, it is only okay. I think a lot hinges on the brand of Greek yogurt and the kind of maple syrup (real or Aunt Jemima) you use in this. I'm not sure what the submitter used but on hand I had Fage and Spring Tree maple syrup. I ended up having to smooth out the Fage taste with half and half (to taste) and extra maple syrup. I love my Fage and I eat it for breakfast with strawberries and hardly any added sugar; for some reason, the combination of packed pumpkin, spices and Fage just left a strange aftertaste. I blended everything to the same consistency in my blender before pouring it into my ice cream maker. It only took 10-15 minutes to set up.

Loved this recipe! I'm a sucker for anything that involves pumpkin (especially this time of year), and I was so excited when I came across this recipe. I actually used non-fat Greek-style yogurt; the texture is a little icier than intended, but it still tastes great and is nearly entirely guilt free! I also don't have an ice cream freezer, so I took the advice from another reviewer (who used a blender) and mixed it three times over the course of a few hours, keeping it in the freezer in between. It worked beautifully! I can't wait to make it again and experiment with the spice/sweetness ratio. I'll be bringing this to holiday celebrations in the very near future for sure!

Despite mixed reviews, I was excited to try this.. especially since I love all of the ingredients listed. Sadly, it's something that I won't make again. I used pure maple syrup and followed the instructions to a "t".

Replacing half of the nonfat greek yogurt with the full fat version kills any bitterness. Adding a dash of cardammon and black pepper gives makes for a nice chai flavor.

We all loved this.  The kids were dying over the fact that it tasted like frozen pumpkin pie!  I used one and a half teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinn, nutmeg and cloves.  Ours was not bitter, but did taste a bit yogurty (but, I like that flavor).  Used genuine maple syrup.

this would be a 5 star recipe for me if a vanilla Greek yogurt was used.

We love pumpkin in various forms. First made this per recipe. Tried again adding more syrup, then half & Half. The Greek-style yogurt was just too tart and "yogurt-y". Sorry, we didn't care for this.

This was pretty good!  I love the combination of the pumpkin and syrup and the tangy yogurt.  I don't have an ice cream maker so I used the blender/freezer method recommended by another user, but I wasn't completely satisfied with the texture.  I might get an ice cream maker just for this recipe!

Waaaayyy too bitter - even added 1/4 c sugar and it was bitter.  My wife eats Fage Greek Yogurt often and loves it, so it wasn't the yogurt, but this combo was just very tart.

I did not care for this recipe - it was nothing like the frozen yogurt I'm used to.

This recipe was super easy to make and utilizing leftover yoghurt. I liked the flavor because it reminded me of a custard but it needed a tad bit of sweetness not much but a tad. And a little more vanilla.

This recipe is missing SALT!!! I added about 1 teaspoon of salt!  Without it the taste was very bitter and yogurt-y. I used pure New York Maple Syrup, and whole milk yogurt that I made with milk from our cow. I also added a 1/2 cup of fresh heavy cream. I mixed up everything as the recipe states and decided it needed a bit more cream. It was still lacking something, and it was salt! I also added  1/4 tsp. ground cardamom.
