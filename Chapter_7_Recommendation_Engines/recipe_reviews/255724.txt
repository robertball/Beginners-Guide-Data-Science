I altered the ingredients to make this a vegan meal but stuck to basic idea. I used vegan mozzarella cheese in place of ricotta and used about 1 cup. I used quinoa in place of rice because it has more moisture. I omitted half and half. it came out great and is very flavorful. It  also presents nice and impresses company.
