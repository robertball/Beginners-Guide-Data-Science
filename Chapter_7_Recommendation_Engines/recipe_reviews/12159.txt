I left out the pie crust and put this into a square baking dish to make into a cranberry apple crisp instead of a pie and it was fantastic!  The topping is really to die for.  I liked the tartness of the cranberries, they will certainly make you pucker a little, if you like more sweet than tart add more sugar or a drizzle of maple syrup.  I brought this to a family gathering and everyone loved it, lots of people commented that it tasted like a rhubarb recipe.

I saved this recipe in 2004 and made it many times. It's this time of the year to dig it out once again. Simply one of my favorites! :)

My family loved this pie!  It had the perfect blend of sweet/tart taste.  Based on others reviews, I used only 4 apples & 1/2 pkg (6oz) of cranberries, and it was plenty!  It filled one 9" store bought deep-dish pie crust, and had enough filling leftover  to fill 6 tart shells.  I added chopped walnuts to the streusel topping which tasted great.  Before baking, I wrapped foil around the edge of the crust so it wouldn't burn during the baking which allowed the topping to get nice and brown & crisp.  Excellent.  I will be making another one for Christmas using the other half package of cranberries I have waiting for me in the freezer.  Thanks Blythe!

For Christmas Dinner, I made a chocolate cream pie, pumpkin pie, Grandma Opal's apple pie and this!  My family is full of great bakers and we all agreed, this is the best dessert of all!  I made it as a crisp, using a 9 x 13 pan, no bottom crust, and reduced the butter by half.  No need to chop the cranberries.  Great recipe!!!

This has become my husband's favorite dessert.  It was fairly easy to make.  I didn't prebake my crust and it came out fine....I just brushed the crust with egg white before I added the filling to get that pretty golden brown and crispy appearence after baking.

I had a piece of Cranberry Apple pie that I loved from a restaurant and wanted to make one for my family.  This recipe was easy and very good, especially the streusel topping--my kids (ages 7 and 4)ate two pieces and wanted more!  But something was a little off for me--it was too sweet.  I sprinked a tiny bit of salt on my second piece, and it made all the difference.  It toned down the sweetness a little and made the taste richer.  Next time I make this, I will add 1/4-1/2 tsp. salt to the fruit mix.  Thanks for a great recipe, though.

Oh My! It's just doesn't get any better than this! This is absolutely the BEST apple pie I have ever had.  It is such a dense pie and the sweet/tart taste is not only irresistable but downright addicting!!!!

Great holiday pie!  I made 3 for this Christmas and everyone loved it, even my Dad who is an old-fashioned apple pie lover!!!  I did change the recipe however and only put in 1/2 of the bag of cranberries which made it not so tart!  Thanks...Great Pie!

Pretty good. I followed the recipe loosely. Just wanted to use up some cranberry sauce which I had made for Thanksgiving. Used about 2 large granny smith apples, which i sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar. Then my cranberry sauce (the oranged cranberry sauce from this site), which I had put some chopped walnuts in. Had a little trouble with the putting the top crust on, b/c it kept breaking on me, but i tried my best. Then I brushed on some beaten egg and sprinkled with a little more cinnamon sugar. It turned out a lovely golden shade. Was more delicious after a day or two in the fridge, and the walnuts from my sauce made all the better.

I just love this pie I got to do it in my culinary class. I love how unique the pie is since you really dont see stores selling it. The only diffrent thing I did was that I added crushed walnuts for texture. It really took the pie to a new level. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

A huge hit for Thanksgiving!!!  My husband requested an apple and cranberry pie for dessert and I tried this one out.  I used a ready made crust for ease and that was a great choice.  I also didn't not use the crumble topping as my mind was in fifty different places that day but instead just covered the top with a another pie crust layer and that worked perfectly as well. We served this pie with homemade egg nog ice cream and it was a festive and wonderful dessert!

Fantastic!  I used 3 jonagold apples, 6 oz. of cranberries sliced in half, and 3/4 c. white sugar for the filling.  I thickened with the whole 1/3 c. tapioca, but will reduce that next time to 3 Tablespoons.  I didn't know if the filling would seep out, so didn't pile it to high (about 1 inch above the rim).  I had no problems with seepage, so would heap more filling in next time.  This time even though I had halved the filling called for in the recipe, I still had enough to make a small crisp with the leftover filling and streusel topping.

Only changed a few things: I used a couple store bought pie crusts (baked for 10 mins & then filled)- after pie was filled I placed aluminum foil around edges to prevent burning, did NOT use the egg, and bumped up the temperature to 350 for about 80 mins after reading the reviews (glad I did!). Everything else was as written and WONDERFUL! Got RAVE reviews from all the guys at Elk Camp! It heaps up in 2 pie crusts but does bake down so don't be scared of using the whole bunch of apples. I used 6 LARGE granny smith apples and it was just delish! In fact this was my future daughter-in-law's 1st pie she ever made (with just a little help from me) and she loved it so much she made it again for an early Thanksgiving dinner! I am going to make this tonight, but I am omitting the pie crust & adding Oats to the topping for an apple crisp! Can't wait! What a versatile recipe! Super easy & YUMMY!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got RAVE reviews-absolutely wonderful. I followed other reviews and baked it at 350 for about an hour, then turned off the oven and left the pie in the oven for about another 30 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

To die for! Love the apple cranberry combo. My only changes were adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and half teaspoon of salt to apple mixture. I think it made it slightly more rich. Also, I didn't have any tapioca on hand so I tossed 2-3 tablespoons of cornstarch with the apples and this worked well to thicken with the gummy texture some reviewers said the tapioca gave. Unlike other reviews I was able to fit ALL of the filling and topping in the pie even with using the whole bag of cranberries. It definitely makes a big pie but obviously not too big because nothing ran over in the oven. Using all the filling made the pie big and rounded which actually made it quite beautiful if you want an impressive looking pie. Will make again.

I used the filling in the recipe to make 12 little individual apple crisps that you bake in 1/2 pint glass jars. I added 1/4 cup of flour instead of the tapioca and also added 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspooon cinnamon. I'm glad I read the reviews and followed the advice to use only half the amount of cranberries, it would have been way too tart. And there is no need to go through the hassle of trying to chop them. For the topping I added a 1/2 cup of quick oats. I baked at 375 for 30 minutes. It turned out to be a cute, little, rustic dessert. cute,little, rustic dessert.

AMAZING. Made this for Thanksgiving last year. It is a great twist on traditional apple pie. I really appreciated the less sicky sweet taste than other apple pies, the cranberries added great taste and color. I used 6 large granny smiths in my pie which was also a contributing factor to taste. The pie was sweet, but still tasted somewhat light and fresh.

WOW! This is really yummy. Not sure if I am loving the walnuts though. I think pecans may go better. Also, the filling is enough for almost 2 pies. Next time I will use one 9" "deep dish" pie crust or cut the recipe down if I use a regular 9".

Made this a few years back and it was good but thought it would be better as a crisp. Made it last night as a crisp and it was excellent! I used 8 Granny Smith apples and followed the rest except no pie crust of course. Oh, I also sprinkled in some cinnamon with the apples/cranberry mixture. Turned out great! Thanks for a yummy and quick/easy recipe!  :)

Very Good.  Brought it to work and it was devoured!  I thought it had too many cranberries in it which made it tart, but if that is what you like then this is your pie.

Like others, I found that this recipe made a ridiculous amount of filling.  I made one deep dish pie, and just threw the rest of the filling into a casserole dish to make a very large crisp.  I only ended up using 5 apples and still had this much filling.  Way too much topping too.  Another thing...chopping the cranberries was an unneccessary pain, and I think it would have turned out nicer if I'd left them whole.  But, complaints aside, it did taste really great.  I have to say though that the crisp tasted better than the pie.  The pie crust almost seemed to get in the way.  Will make again as a crisp.

This pie was great.  I get rave reviews everytime I make it.  I did have enough filing for two pie's, which is always welcome in my home!  I found that I had to watch the pie as it approaches one hour, sometimes it needs a bit more time and sometimes a bit less, depending on the apples I use.

This is wonderful and easy.  I used my own pie crust, which was fairly deep, and I had too much filling.  Next time I will scale back on the applies a bit (maybe the cranberries too).  And the crumb topping could be cut down too.  But, it was wonderful.  Definitely use the cookie sheet under the pie.  It does run over.  Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out excellent.  I added a little less sugar because we like tart pies.  Never used tapioca for thickening before,was quite easy.

Came across pie this looking for a way to use my fuji apples.  I did have extra filling & topping that I baked as a crisp.  Both were very good!  I added chopped walnuts to the topping for a little texture but changed nothing else.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe but used less sugar as my husband is diabetic.  Also, used a little more tapioca ... definitely a keeper!  Julie

This came out very nicely for Thanksgiving - I like the tartness of cranberry and will probably add a little more next time. Topping was yummy, but got a little too hard - maybe I just overcooked it. Anyway - I will make this again! I made this again for A GIRL SCOUT BAKE SALE - KEPT A CLOSER EYE ON THE STRUESEL CRUST THIS TIME AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT. I LOVE THIS PIE!!

I was excited about this pie when it was baking the night before Thanksgiving. I typically only use 5 star recipes when I'm trying something new for a public occasion. Unfortunately, my pie turned out VERY watery. I ended up having to stop at a grocery store on the way to dinner to pick up a pie. I have made various pies before and they have turned out well, but since I can admit I'm no Betty Crocker, I tried it again last night, making sure that I followed the recipe exactly. I had the same problem. It does make a great cobbler though! It tastes great, I just couldn't get it to stay as pie slices due to the liquidity of the filling.

The pie tastes delicious (I like tart pies, like rhubarb), but I definitely recommend AGAINST inverting the pie shell to bake it, as described in step 1.  All this did for me was rip my crust so that I had to start over again.  Makes a lot of filling, but that was a good excuse for me to make a second pie.  Yum.

I used no crust, but a bit of the topping under the filling. WOW! What a combo. Loved the flavor under vanilla ice cream.

I thought this pie was pretty good.  It turned out very red due to the cranberries.  Mine was also a little dry.  I guess I prefer more filling in pies.

My husband loved it! I'm not a big fan of cranberries but this pie was great.  I followed a different crust recipe that used frozen butter and shortning.  What a diffrenece, the crust was so good.

Very tasty!  I would recommend either having two pie shells ready or making the remainder of the filling into a cobbler.  I just put the remainder of the filling in a cake pan and used the topping and popped it into the oven with the pie and it was just delicious!  I'd make this recipe again in a heartbeat!

Once I started making this pie, found that partially baking the crust did not work, threw it out and started over. Prebaked it without inverting. I had too much filling for the crust as well as the topping. Could have made 2 pies! Didn't figure out that the oven was not hot enoungh (at 325) till 3/4 of the way thur baking, it does need to be baked at 350. Directions are not very specific. We'll find out tomorrow if it turned out OK!

Delicious! I only used half a bag of cranberries as suggested by other reviewers and was glad that I did or it would've been too tart. I then adjusted the sugar to only 1 cup since I wasnt using all the cranberries. Fantastic! This works well as either a pie or a crisp. Great for thxgiving or xmas.

Pretty good recipe.  I agreed with a lot of people that it would be easier and just as good to make as a crisp.  My only suggestion would be to make the topping sweeter, it was a little bland.  And maybe do something to bring down the tartness of the cranberries... maybe if I used a different kind of apple (I used granny smith like suggested).  Overall it was pretty good though.

This was great. Much more exciting than plain apple pie. I will definitely be making it again. I was also glad this called for fresh cranberries, since most others I found called for canned cranberries. I think I added more apples than the recipe called for (6 apples is not very descriptive as apples come in all different sizes) so it looked like a 50/50 mix of cranberries and apples. After the pie was filled I baked the leftovers as you would an apple crumble and it was also great. This was more than enough strusel topping, and that next time, I will add some chopped  walnuts

This pie was great!  Has a slightly tart taste to it (cranberries), but is certainly not overbearing.  The cranberries and apples were a great mixture, and the brown sugar topping added just the right touch.  It took a little longer to make than most pies, but was well worth it.  This was the first time I tried a cranberry pie, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good new pie to try.

This is not the prettiest pie but it's deeeeelicious! Brought it to thanksgiving and everyone loved it. MIL even said it was the best pie she'd ever had. Made with a 50/50 mix of honey crisp and Granny Smith apples, subbed corn starch for tapioca, same amounts (had corn starch on hand). Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delish! pie. I've been making it for several years with 3 exceptions: 1/4 cup flour mixed with the sugar to tighten it (I never have had tapioca in the house); a teaspoon of cinnamon added to the apples to carry that wonderful flavor throughout; and half a bag of whole cranberries - no chopping cranberries for this lady anymore! I usually use a mixture 3:2 sweet apples, like Gala, with two Granny Smith's thrown in for good measure. Thank you for reminding me what a good pie this is. My daughter insists on it for her birthday (around Thanksgiving) and at Christmas too. The whole family devours it when I make it.

Perfect combination of sweet with a mild tang- the topping is incredible!  Well worth the effort of apple peeling, which usually dissuades me from cooking anything like this. I did cook it for approximately 15 minutes more than called for to be sure my apples were tender, and that did not make them overdone.  Definitely a holiday favorite from now on!

Too much filling for one pie so I divided it.  I added some cinnamon and a pinch of salt to the filling.  I didn't have any tapioca so I added 2T corn starch to filling.  I also replace 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup oats.  That was a great change!  Would make again!

I had enough filling leftover for a crumble, my family just ate this pie (and crumble) up. I would skip the pie crust next time or make a HUGE deep dish.

I'm at a high altitude, so maybe I'll bake it over an hour next time. It was very soupy, though it tasted good. 

I'll skip the crust and make it a crisp next time. I might cut back on the cranberries a bit too. It was piled high, but it baked down. Next time I'll slice the apples and not cut them into smaller chunks. It was hard to tell if they were fully cooked to softness.

Also, what exactly is quick-cooking tapioca? Is it the instant pudding mix that comes in Jello-sized boxes? That's what I used. 

Thank you for the recipe! I bet it would taste great with real whipping cream or vanilla ice cream.

I did not get to try this recipe as I made the pie to enter into a pie contest. I followed the recipe as closely as possible. It did make too much for my pie tin and I did HEAP it full.As the pie cooled it settled back into the crust and was just nicely filled. It won FIRST place in the pie contest. Now I am going to the kitchen and making another pie for me.

I was looking for something to do with an extra package of cranberries and this was perfect! I used Golden Delicious apples and they turned out tender and not mushy at all. The recipe did make more filling and streusel than I could fit in my deep dish pie pan. The finished pie got rave reviews from everyone who tried it, including my 3 year-old and almost 2 year-old. This is a keeper!

I liked the combination of apples and cranberries, I also added chopped pecans. I only used 4 apples and half a bag of cranberries, that was plenty for one pie. I found it was not as flavorful as I had hoped and the tapioca made an odd gel consistency that I didn't think fit well with the pie. I think I will try another recipe next time because I do like to combo.

This is the best apple pie I've ever had.  I normally don't like tapioca, but this is great.

Delicious and beautiful pie.  It made enough for my large and small Pampered Chef round pans (I added 1 extra apple).  Will make this many more times!  Great flavor and special presentation!
