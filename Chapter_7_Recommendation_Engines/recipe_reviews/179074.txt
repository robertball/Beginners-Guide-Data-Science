This recipe was perfect!  My family ate it up!  It was so flavorful and tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly except i replaced all the ingredients with new ones and called it meatloaf!  I will definitely make this again!

I mean, come on people.  This is only a small exaggeration of what goes on on this site with the reviews.  Not only is it just dumb to rate a recipe that you didn't even follow, i find it to be disrespectful to the person posting the original recipe.

Simple and delicious - although I used leftover grilled chicken vs. canned chicken. I cut back on the onion a bit and used mild green onion. I added a little garlic powder and salt along with the pepper. I used Hellman's light mayo and threw in some chopped black olives. I mixed everything together and let it chill for a couple of hours. Very good on toasted whole grain bread.

I follow this recipe pretty closely, but I omit the onion since we don't like it and I add 2-3 TBS relish to it for a little sweet. I use low-fat mayo. Delicious!

simple and good! I used Veganaise, a mayo alternative and just added a little bit of salt & sugar.  I didn't measure so when it still "needed something" I realized it just needed a smidge more onion then "presto" perfect!

I used leftover grilled organic chicken.  Added Veganiase like the 1st reviewer.  Added onion, stone ground mustard, s/p, very small sugar and capers, no celery.  I don't eat meat, but my 2 kids said it was delicious.  Hopefully my hubby will agree.  I plan to serve it on homemade whole wheat bread as a sandwich.

Delicious!!!! I have never made chicken salad before and was a little nervous because I have tasted some nasty ones. Wanted to make something fun and new for a luncheon/baby shower, found this very basic recipe and thought I'd try it. I omitted the onions (might add them another time) and added garlic and onion powder and fresh lemon juice. So so yummy and easily doubled/tripled. Will definitely be making this again. And again and again!

This is delicious!  I didn't have celery, so I used celery seed.  I took another person's advice and added chopped fresh jalapenos.  I also added some fresh cilantro.  We like things hot.  This is a winner and I will definitely make this over and over again.  This is a fun recipe because you can add whatever you want to suit your own taste.

Used leftover chicken that I shredded. Skipped celery and added capers. Added a dash of sugar. Delicious! Simple, yet tasty. And oh so very easy.

I added a little Worcestershire, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Might be obvious, but I used a red onion. Really awesome for Atkins.

Nothing special and is pretty bland. This would work though if you were in a hurry. Great for people who don't like mustard and relish in their chicken salad. I'm not one of them though.

I like the simplicity of this recipe. Great on a hot summer's night.  I did add a little fresh tarragon and dill and a tad of dijon.

This was my first time making chicken salad and I followed the recipe and my family loved it. I think next time I will add some crushed pineapples, I had it that way at a restaurant before.

Simple and delicious just like old school, traditional chicken salad is supposed to be. I didn't have celery so I left that out, and used a bs chicken breast that was previously boiled in water. I will be using canned chicken often for quick snack, lunch, or even dinner in the summer time!

This was the first time I ever used canned chicken breast and I was pleasantly surprised. The recipe was delicious. Next time I will add a dash of Wasabi (as one reviewer suggested) for extra zing. It's a keeper.

I stay away from canned chicken as it's much too salty.  Since I've purchased a food processor (very inexpensive), boiling chicken breasts and then putting in processor is so easy.  I also add sweet pickle relish, chopped walnuts, cashews, or pine nuts, and raisins/craisons.  In pita bread = bon appetite!

This was simple and easy to make. I had never made Chicken salad and I always wanted to try it. I don't like the look of store brought. I also only ate my mothers. I tried this and it came out so good I used Chicken breast instead of canned.

This was a nice basic chicken salad.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken, the celery, green onions and a little more mayonnaise, and the pepper.  I did think it needed some salt, so I added that to taste.

Didn't have any celery, used chopped water chestnuts instead. Added wasabi for extra flavor. Will be taking for lunch at work.

I have been looking for a great chicken salad recipe and sadly this was not it. I found this recipe to be very bland when made as directed. A friend suggested adding mustard and pickles which helped a little. The next time I make chicken salad I will use fresh chicken versus can which I thought was very dry even with mayo as well as expensive.

GREAT RECIPE for my family.  I doubled the ingred. and made a bowlful.  I followed the directions to a T, except i used white pepper, just the way a huge dept store used to serve in their Tea Room.

It was decent enough, but seemed to be lacking something that we couldn't quite put our finger on. But thanks for the recipe!

EASY AND YUMMY!! I will admit it was a little bland but ill just add mustard and a bit of relish next time to see what happens then.
